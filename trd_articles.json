        "content": "Four years ago, I\nhelped a friend in Austin\nlook for a place to buy in the Dallas metro area.\nDallas was cheaper than Austin, where he was renting an 800-square-foot apartment for $1,400 a month. The rise of remote work meant he was free to move anywhere.\nIt was an eye-opening experience for this lifelong New Yorker, because we have normalized the astronomical prices we pay for housing here.\nShopping in Dallas\nwas like going back in time.\nMaybe you\u2019re one of those people who reminisces about what homes in New York City cost 30 years ago, and wish you had bought more of them, or not sold what you had. \u201cIf only we had snapped up that fixer-upper that went for $600,000. It just sold for $6 million!\u201d my wife said once. (We couldn\u2019t afford it at the time anyway.)\nI recall house-hunting in 1993, when one-bedroom co-ops in Park Slope were as little as $75,000 and three-bedroom condos in landmarked brownstones went for $220,000. Everything is about eight times more expensive now.\nBut in Arlington, Texas, in late 2021, homes were trading for what they did in New York City in the early \u201990s. My friend was on a tight budget, had zero savings and owed thousands of dollars on his credit cards, so I tried to get him to buy a\n793-square-foot one-bedroom\n, newly remodeled with stainless steel appliances, for the preposterous price of $85,000.\nThe mortgage payment, insurance, property taxes and homeowners\u2019 association fees would have been $782 per month. The condo had a pool, too. It was so cheap, I thought about buying it myself.\nBut my friend had delusions of grandeur, which is how he had ended up in his sorry financial situation at the age of 56, despite being gainfully employed and having no family to support. He wanted someplace better, with more resale value, even though he expected to never sell.\nIn early 2022, he lost a bunch of bidding wars in the $130,000 to $150,000 range. Without my knowledge, he eventually bid $195,000 (which he couldn\u2019t afford) for a condo in North Dallas, a \u201cnicer\u201d (read: wealthier) neighborhood with \u201cbetter\u201d schools (even though he had no kids).\nFortunately, the deal fell through because the Biden administration\u2019s new rules for Fannie and Freddie required the condo to have more money in reserve than it did.\nI talked some sense into my friend, who then bought a similar unit in Arlington for $128,000. His mortgage, property taxes and insurance today are $793 a month. For the first time ever, he could save for retirement without repeatedly raiding his 401(k). He has since paid off his credit cards and put away $67,000.\nHe was able to achieve life-altering financial and housing stability because homes are so cheap in Arlington. Obviously, Texas is different from New York City in many ways, but it\u2019s noteworthy that Arlington achieved low-cost housing without rent regulation or subsidies. It simply let developers build basic, three-story complexes.\nThe state that most famously did the opposite, California, now has such high housing costs that many of its non-rich\nresidents are moving to Texas\n.\n\nBut there\u2019s a sad ending to this tale now developing: Texas localities are\nbanning apartment development\nby adopting some of the same restrictive rules that have made homes so costly in California (and New York, for that matter), as Jay Parsons\nrecently explained\n.\nHere\u2019s hoping state lawmakers manage to stop them before they learn California\u2019s lesson the hard way.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nMayoral front-runner Zohran Mamdani has said he was earning only $47,000 a year when he signed his first lease for his $2,300-a-month, rent-stabilized apartment in Queens. \u201cI was looking for an apartment that I could afford on my own,\u201d he\ntold\nthe New York Editorial Board. He omitted that landlords typically require tenants\u2019 annual income at lease-signing to be 40 times the rent, which would have been more than $90,000. How did he get the apartment? Send guesses to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Of the 191,000 apartments built over the past decade that received a city subsidy, only about 3 percent had three or more bedrooms, the New York Times\nreported\n.\nElsewhere\u2026\nGov. Kathy Hochul on Thursday signed legislation that, in her words, \u201cbans collusion using algorithm-enabled rent price fixing.\u201d The Real Estate Board of New York had asked Hochul to make some chapter amendments to the bill, S7882/A1417-B, but she didn\u2019t.\nThe measure didn\u2019t seem like a high priority for REBNY, though, because it doesn\u2019t outright ban software programs that help landlords price their rentals. Assembly sponsor Linda Rosenthal had\nalready amended the bill\n.\nThe bill summary says the legislation \u201cprohibits a person or entity from knowingly or with reckless disregard facilitating an agreement between two or more residential rental property owners or managers to not compete with respect to residential rental dwelling units, including by operating or licensing a software, data analytics service, or algorithmic device that performs a coordinating function \u2026 among such residential rental property owners or managers.\u201d\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$4.75 million\nfor a 3,443-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at 323 Bergen Street in Boerum Hill.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$20 million\nfor a 27,020-square-foot auto body repair facility at 127-48 Northern Boulevard in Corona.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$29.5 million\nfor a 12,250-square-foot townhouse at 11 Gramercy Park South. Adam Modlin and Andrew Nierenberg of the Modlin Group have the listing.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "The City of Beverly Hills is preparing for a showdown with\nMax Netty\n\u2019s\nSoundview Investment\nover a proposed builder\u2019s remedy development on Rodeo Drive.\nThe city has received \u201ca written threat of litigation\u201d over a proposed development project at 145 South Rodeo Drive, according to an\nagenda\nfor the City Council\u2019s closed session conference with legal counsel Friday afternoon.\nThe site is just south of Wilshire Boulevard, about a quarter-mile away from Rodeo Drive and the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.\nThe saber rattling on the proposed development, which would replace a two-story office building, came in an email from Netty\u2019s lawyer in May, shared with\nThe Real Deal\n. The looming showdown comes as Beverly Hills has\nbegun signing off\non some other projects in the tony enclave.\n\u201cThe attached letter is a denial of the project because it takes away the ability to proceed under builder\u2019s remedy,\u201d Ryan Leaderman of Holland and Knight wrote in the email to the city. \u201cWithout a modification to the City\u2019s position on this issue, litigation is highly likely given the denial of the project as proposed.\u201d\nBuilder\u2019s remedy allows housing developers to skirt local zoning\nin cities such as Beverly Hills\nthat have failed to certify their state-mandated housing plans. Beverly Hills was subject to builder\u2019s remedy for several months but is now in compliance with the state\u2019s requirements, known as the \u201chousing element\u201d on plans for housing development.\n\u201cPlease let me know if there is going to be a change in the City\u2019s position,\u201d Leaderman wrote. \u201cI assume that you might need to go to City Council for a closed session discussion.\u201d\nThe proposed development on Rodeo Drive would replace a two-story office building. Soundview wants to construct a new mixed-use development, per a May 1 email the city sent Leaderman. City officials said the latest application differs significantly from a previously approved plan, and has been deemed ineligible for processing as a \u201cbuilder\u2019s remedy project.\u201d\nThe city claims the preliminary application was submitted in February 2024 as all rental units.\nThe more recent plans include a subdivision that now includes condominiums as well as rentals.\n\n\u201cCity staff has determined in good faith that the 145 South Rodeo Drive project is a different project than the [preliminary application] project because of the omission of subdivision information,\u201d the city wrote.\nIn addition, the letter says the 180-day deadline to resubmit an application expired on Aug. 24, 2024.\nThe latest proposal does not comply with the city\u2019s zoning ordinances in its height and density, and therefore needs builder\u2019s remedy to override city rules.\n\u201cIt is not a valid builder\u2019s remedy project, and thus can no longer rely on the builder\u2019s remedy provisions of Government Code Section 65589.5 to insulate the Development Application Project from the general plan and zoning consistency requirements,\u201d the letter says.\nTo proceed with the development application project, the developer would have to seek general plan and zoning amendments for non-builder\u2019s remedy projects.\nLeaderman was \u201cout sick\u201d per an email, and a city attorney didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nThe cases could be impacted by Leo Pustilnikov\u2019s\nvictory in superior court\nin August. A judge ruled that Beverly Hills violated state housing law in its attempt to block his proposal for a 19-story apartment building with a hotel and restaurant at 125-129 South Linden Drive. Pustilnikov\u2019s projects got a greenlight from the Beverly Hills Planning Commission.\nNetty\u2019s Soundview, meanwhile, also has proposed a\n27-unit condominium development\nat 140 South Camden Drive, a block south of Wilshire Boulevard, which appears bound for a showdown with city officials, too.\n\u201cPlease also be aware that we are preparing to litigate for the 140 S. Camden project as well,\u201d Leaderman wrote.\n",

        "content": "Prolific Chicago investor Stuart Handler recently sold a three-property multifamily portfolio in\nHyde Park\nfor $23.5 million.\nThe transaction came out to roughly $113,000 per unit. Records of the sale have not been made public yet, and Kiser Group brokers Aaron Sklar and Noah Birk, who represented Handler, declined to identify the buyer.\nThe sale is welcome news for the South Side, where a recent\nfederal raid drew nationwide controversy\n. Amid an immigration enforcement\ncrackdown\nin Chicago, federal agents arrested 37 people for a variety of charges at a South Shore apartment building on Sept. 30, leaving residents shaken and local officials questioning the federal government\u2019s tactics.\n\u201cThat obviously isn\u2019t a great look on the South Side, but there\u2019s a million other buildings where things are going great and the neighborhoods are feeling vibrant,\u201d Birk said.\nHandler, who is the namesake behind the University of Illinois Chicago\u2019s Handler Department of Real Estate, was a longtime owner of the portfolio and has been actively\nbuying\nand\nselling\nChicago multifamily properties throughout the past year.\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably one of the most-respected operators without a doubt in Chicago, but probably nationally as well,\u201d Sklar said.\nLast spring, Handler\u2019s firm TLC Management sold a 136-unit apartment building on the South Side, at 4817 South Drexel Boulevard. Jeremy Bronfman\u2019s Lincoln Avenue Communities snagged the property for $31 million or about $227,000 per unit.\n\nAround the same time, Handler bought a 192-unit property in the northwest suburb of Mount Prospect for $60 million or about $312,000 per unit. Local developer Wingspan Development Group was the seller.\nThe Hyde Park properties, near the University of Chicago, have 207 studio and one bedroom units and 127,000 square feet. Rents range from about $1,100 to $1,200 for the studios and about $1,400 for the one-bedroom units. The three buildings bring in about $1.7 million in net operating income, according to the listing.\nThe studio and one-bedroom properties are located at 5326 South Cornell Avenue, 5417-25 South Harper Avenue, 5210-14 South Woodlawn Avenue in Hyde Park and 661 West Sheridan Road and 434 West Wellington Avenue in Lakeview.\nWhen Handler listed the Hyde Park portfolio,\nhe also listed a pair of North Side multifamily buildings\nat 661 West Sheridan Road and 434 West Wellington Avenue.\nChicago-based J&amp;J Equities bought The West Wellington Avenue building in Lakeview for $10.8 million this August. J&amp;J Equities made the purchase, which came out to about $150,000 per unit, as a part of a 1031 exchange.\nThe other Lakeview property is under contract, Birk and Sklar said.\nHandler\u2019s transactions are part of a busy streak of\nmultifamily\nsales in Chicago as the market continues to outperform the Sun Belt amid historically low new supply coming online.",

The chamber is working to help Vanderbilt get settled, said Rodney Fong, CEO and president of the chamber.\nThe study considered other locations downtown, including\nSalesforce Tower\n, the Embarcadero and Jackson Square, but \u201cit really sort of arrived at the Fifth and Mission corridor for the core reasons of transportation,\u201d Fong said.\nOther opportunities in the area include the Old Mint building, the\nbeleaguered San Francisco Centre mall\nand the Fifth and Mission Garage.\n\nThe 5M Project\u2019s un-redeveloped properties include Hearst\u2019s 110 Fifth Street, which has been\napproved for a 400-unit condo tower\n, as well as the San Francisco Chronicle building at 901 Mission Street.

Its planned $520 million campus in West Palm Beach received a\n$50 million donation\nfrom power player Stephen Ross of the Related Companies this year.\nAnd in New York, it received approval last month for a\n99-year groundlease\nwith the General Theological Seminary in Chelsea.\nMeanwhile, Vanderbilt is expanding in its hometown as well.

That metric lagged behind 2024 for most of the year; before September, only January and June had year-over-year increases.\nConcurrently, sales volume increased 5.6 percent year over year to $1.3 billion, making September the only month besides June to exceed the previous year\u2019s volume.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the strongest sales growth we\u2019ve seen in 2025,\u201d said Brandy Wuensch, CEO of Unlock MLS and the Austin Board of Realtors.\n\nInventory growth is slowing, and parties are negotiating lower deals.\n\u201cBuyers are returning to the market, they\u2019re gaining confidence, knowing that they have more negotiating power. And sellers are also understanding that, if they want to move, they need to be flexible in negotiating in these terms,\u201d Wuensch said.\nWhile some agents say the\nAustin\narea has become a\nbuyer\u2019s market\n, Wuensch considers it a balanced market.\n\u201cWhen we see our inventory go over six months, that\u2019s where you\u2019re in a true buyer\u2019s market,\u201d Wuensch said.\nThe Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos area has exceeded six months of inventory just once this year, reaching 6.1 in July. September had 5.7 months of inventory, a year-over-year increase of 0.6 and a month-over-month decline of 0.2.\nSellers weren\u2019t eager to enter the market. New listings in September trailed last year for the second month in a row, decreasing year over year by 5.7 percent. That\u2019s the widest negative margin all year, and a thorough correction from July, when new listings increased by 13.4 percent year over year.\n",

        "content": "Bexar County voters are lukewarm and divided on two major ballot measures that could reshape San Antonio\u2019s\nentertainment landscape\nahead of a November vote on proposals for $503 million in bond funding.\nA survey from the University of Texas at San Antonio\u2019s Center for Public Opinion Research\u00a0 found that 44 percent of voters back Proposition A, which would\nexpand the San Antonio Stock Show &amp; Rodeo grounds\non the East Side, while nearly 40 percent support Proposition B, which would direct venue tax funds toward a\nnew arena for the San Antonio Spurs\nat Hemisfair.\nThe ballot items are part of Project Marvel, a broader proposal for a downtown sports and entertainment district that could\nreshape\nthe city\u2019s urban core. When asked about the overall project, 45 percent of respondents supported it, while 40 percent were opposed.\nIn August, Bexar County Commissioners voted to send the ballot items to voters in a proposal that could provide $500 million in visitor tax revenue for a new Spurs arena and renovations to the Frost Bank Center, the current home of the Spurs, should voters approve the measure.\nVoter-approved funds could also go to work on redeveloping the grounds of the Freeman Coliseum, a concert venue and home of the stock show and rodeo. Bexar County would contribute 25 percent of the cost and no more than $311 million to the project.\nSpurs Sports and Entertainment Chairman and Managing Partner Peter J. Holt has pledged $1 billion toward the projects: at least $500 million for the new arena, $500 million for adjacent development and $60 million for community incentives.\nThe Spurs also pledged to cover cost overruns. In late August the San Antonio City Council approved the continuation of\nCity Manager Erik Walsh\u2019s negotiations\nwith Spurs Sports on a term sheet.\n\nOpposition in the polling was stronger for the NBA team\u2019s proposed arena, with 46 percent of respondents saying they would vote against it and 15 percent undecided. About 41 percent opposed funding the rodeo expansion, which includes redeveloping the Frost Bank Center, the team\u2019s current home.\n\u201cSupport for ballot propositions is always very fluid,\u201d in a news release outlining the findings of the poll. \u201cThat said,\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that the effort to secure venue tax funding for a new Spurs arena faces an uphill battle,\u201d said Bryan Gervais, UTSA political science professor and director of the\nresearch center\n.\nThe poll surveyed 660 likely Bexar County voters between Oct. 1 and Oct. 3 using computer-assisted, self-interviewing software in English and Spanish. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percent.\nThe findings come as city leaders and Spurs ownership make their case for the new arena, arguing it would anchor a revitalized downtown district and attract more events year-round. The prospect of the project getting off the ground also renewed interest in downtown San Antonio\u2019s office market despite high vacancy rates near\n27 percent\n.\nCritics\n, meanwhile, question using public venue tax revenue for a facility that could primarily benefit the team.\nGervais said campaigns on both sides \u201chave plenty of room to move the needle.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Housing earned a brief mention during the first general election mayoral debate on Thursday, largely focused on Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani\u2019s plan to freeze rents for stabilized tenants.\nDebate moderators pushed Mamdani on how he could promise to freeze the rent for four years without seeing the annual analysis produced by the\ncity\u2019s Rent Guidelines Board\n. Mamdani pointed to data released in previous years that showed landlord profits on the rise.\nThe\nauthority\nto set annual rent increases for stabilized rents lies with the nine-member board, though mayors have\ninfluenced\nits decisions.\nThe board releases a report every year that suggests different potential rent increase ranges, based on different financial considerations. The final rent increases do not have to, and often do not, abide by those ranges. Landlord groups have long\ncriticized\nthe board\u2019s reports detailing rises in buildings\u2019 net operating income because those calculations include market-rate units.\nOne of the moderators, Politico New York\u2019s Sally Goldenberg, twice asked Mamdani if he was making a determination based on data he has not yet seen. Both times, he pointed to previous data.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the data year after year, of the fact that salaries are stagnating, costs are up, New Yorkers can\u2019t actually afford their apartments,\u201d he said.\nHe added that he would take action to help landlords with insurance, property taxes and water bills.\nFormer Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent, repeatedly noted that Mamdani lives in a stabilized apartment and criticized the rent freeze proposals.\n\u201cFreeze the rent only postpones the rent because then you have to have an increase to cover the costs,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, the building is going to go bankrupt.\u201d\nWhen asked what he would do for renters who do not live in stabilized housing, Mamdani pointed to plans to build 200,000 units of \u201ctruly affordable homes.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make it easier for the private sector to build housing in this city, because what we see today is, it\u2019s not labor, it\u2019s not materials, it\u2019s the wait that is often costing so many, so much to actually build the housing we need in this city,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite this promise to build more housing, Mamdani has not taken a position on three controversial\nballot questions\naimed at speeding up approval of affordable housing. Though moderators didn\u2019t ask about the measures, Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa noted his opposition to and pointed out that Democratic leaders of the City Council also oppose the measures. He also said he is the only candidate who opposes zoning changes approved as part of the\nCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity\n.\nWhen asked how he hopes to bring down costs in the city if he doesn\u2019t support the construction of new housing, Sliwa said office buildings in Manhattan should be converted for residential use.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to go into the outerboroughs, you don\u2019t need to use wetlands or parklands,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you build a new building, it takes five years. If you convert an existing building, it can be done in a year.\u201d\nCuomo was asked about his proposal, dubbed \u201cZohran\u2019s Law,\u201d and\ncriticism\nthat it would require tenants to pay too much of their income toward rent. Under the proposed law, when a regulated apartment becomes vacant, a landlord could only rent to someone who would spend at least 30 percent of their income on rent. Both tenant and landlord groups have criticized the proposal.\nCuomo, who repeatedly referenced that he served as secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, said the proposal is meant to ensure the units are reserved for the city\u2019s most rent-burdened.\nLater in the debate, the moderators asked the candidates how they would enforce the city\u2019s emissions law, Local Law 97.\nCuomo and Mamdani agreed that some owners will opt to pay the fine for non-compliance rather than invest in the building upgrades required to meet the law\u2019s requirements.\n\u201cYes, I support the law, yes, we have to implement it, but we have to implement it in a way that is feasible,\u201d Cuomo said. He has\nreportedly\ntold a coalition of co-op boards that he is open to modifying the law to make compliance easier.\nMamdani said the city could help condo and co-op owners by buying green building technology in bulk. Sliwa indicated that he would slow the law\u2019s implementation.\n",

        "content": "Developer Michael Shvo is no longer involved in the Raleigh Miami Beach, the trophy asset he planned to redevelop into a luxury condo and hotel project.\nNew York-based Nahla Capital paid about $270 million for the three-acre property at 1775, 1757 and 1751 Collins Avenue, sources confirmed to The Real Deal.\nBloomberg\nfirst reported the sale. Nahla, a private equity firm with $2 billion in assets under management,\nwon a bid\nto purchase the project this summer, though Shvo had a right of first refusal and was reportedly working on raising new funds to pay off his partners and the debt backing the property.\nThe sale largely marks Shvo\u2019s exit from the Miami Beach market, where he made a splash when he and his partners, Deutsche Finance America and a consortium of German pension funds,\npaid $243 million\nfor the Raleigh assemblage in 2019, which includes the Richmond and South Seas hotels.\nShvo hired Peter Marino and Kobi Karp Architecture &amp; Interior Design to design the Raleigh.\u00a0 The developer gutted the original buildings and secured approval for a 17-story luxury condo tower on the beachfront site. The project includes 44 luxury condos, a private members\u2019 club and a hotel component. The Raleigh, an iconic Art Deco hotel known for its pool, was designed by L. Murray Dixon.\nMost presales were in the $5,000-plus per square foot range, though the Wall Street Journal reported that a unit was under contract for nearly $8,500 per square foot. The Raleigh struggled to compete with Witkoff and Monroe Capital\u2019s nearby Auberge-branded condo and hotel redevelopment of the Shore Club.\nLast summer, Shvo\ncut ties with\nOfficial, the former Side-backed firm co-founded by Oren and Tal Alexander, after the Alexander brothers faced allegations of rape and sexual assault. Official was previously handling sales of the Raleigh. One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Anna Sherrill took over sales.\n\nIn 2023, the partners secured\na $190 million refinancing\noriginated by BH3 Management, and the firm had repeatedly extended the maturity date for the loan. A spokesperson for BH3 said that the loan was paid off in connection with this sale.\nA spokesperson for the Raleigh said that the partnership \u201chas chosen to sell the property to Nahla\u201d following its repositioning of the project.\nNewmark\u2019s Adam Spies and Marcella Fasulo arranged the sale.\nIn September, Shvo\nsold his Alton Road assemblage\n, where he planned a luxury office and apartment project, to Infinity Collective via a deed-in-lieu-of-foreclosure.\nShvo still owns a portion of the development for his One Soundscape Park office project at 1665 and 1667 Washington Avenue in Miami Beach.\n",

The property is at 9703 Collins Avenue in\nBal Harbour\n.\nThe lender, San Francisco-based Column, is reviewing a request by Al Rayyan, led by CEO Tarek El Sayed, for an extension, Morningstar states.\nThough Al Rayyan maintained an above breakeven debt service coverage ratio, its 2024 net cash flow reportedly fell to about half of 2021 levels, potentially triggering tighter scrutiny from bondholders, the report shows.\n\nAl Rayyan\n, whose chairman Sheikh Faisal Bin Qassim Al Thani is a member of Qatar\u2019s ruling Al Thani family, obtained the loan in 2021, records show. The firm used the loan proceeds to pull out $44.5 million in equity and pay off a previous\n$132 million\nmortgage that had been acquired by London-based Reuben Brothers, led by billionaire siblings David and Simon Reuben.\nSt. Regis Bal Harbour is a condo-hotel completed in 2011 consisting of three 27-story towers with 192 hotel rooms and 205 condos. Al Rayyan acquired the hotel portion, which is housed in the complex\u2019s center tower, for $213 million in 2014 from billionaire Barry Sternlicht\u2019s Miami Beach-based Starwood Capital Group.\nAl Rayyan also invested $40 million in renovations, loan filings show. Last year, the\nSt. Regis Bal Harbour Residences condo association\nsued Al Rayyan, alleging building defects, health and safety issues and financial mismanagement. The association is seeking a comprehensive assessment of the building and remediation for a laundry list of alleged issues in the complex, the pending complaint in Miami-Dade Circuit Court states.\nAlso in 2024, Al Rayan sold the ownership entity for the\nW Miami\n, a 50-story, 148-key hotel in Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood, to a joint venture between Aventura-based BH Group and S\u00fczer Group.

        "content": "After years of work, a West Village megamansion is finally making its public debut with an asking price that could upend local records.\nThe 13,000-square-foot townhouse at\n105-107 Bank Street\nwas listed for $75 million, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. That works out to $5,769 per square foot for the Robert A.M. Stern Architects design.\nThe home features six bedrooms. The primary suite includes dual bathrooms, dressing rooms, a sitting room and private terrace. There\u2019s also a six-story floating staircase and a roof skylight.\nRoundSquare Builders acquired the separate walkups in 2021 and 2022 for a combined $18 million, though the firm didn\u2019t disclose how much construction cost over the succeeding years.. The company needed approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission before gutting the century-old properties.\nThe townhouse is revamped, but its history remains present: John Lennon and Yoko Ono lived at 105 Bank, while composer John Cage lived at 107 Bank. The rear of the house includes a spiral staircase refurbished and lifted from Lennon\u2019s apartment.\n\nThe downtown townhouse record fell only last year, when Slack co-founder Stewart Butterfield and Away co-founder Jen Rubio bought a double-wide townhome\nfor $72.5 million\n.\nLeslie Garfield\u2019s Matthew Lesser has the listing. He refused showings and visits to the 40-foot-wide property until it was complete, reluctant to display anything less than a finished product.\nThe process of combining properties into a megamansion is controversial and can draw local opposition. Buildings that once housed multiple families become singular residences for a select few, seemingly in contrast to the housing shortage the city faces.\nCombining apartments or replacing small-unit multifamily buildings with oversized townhouses or large duplexes has cost the city\nmore than 100,000 homes\nover the decades. At one time, it was far more common for developers to convert single-family row houses into co-ops or multifamily rentals.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A city of Miami board voted to approve a rezoning of a portion of the Jungle Island property, which Terra and ESJ Capital Partners\u2019 Ecoresiliency Miami plan to redevelop.\nMiami\u2019s Planning, Zoning and Appeals Board voted to amend the existing Jungle Island special area plan and rezone about 5.4 acres of the nearly 19-acre site to T6-36 from T6-12. The rezoning still requires first and second reading approvals from the city commission at later, unspecified dates.\nDespite unanimous approval, board members raised concerns about parking, traffic and green space. The approval includes a condition that a parking study be completed.\nLast November, 62 percent of\nvoters approved\na charter amendment to redevelop Jungle Island. The joint venture between\nDavid Martin\n\u2019s\nTerra\nand ESJ will acquire the 5.4 acres that are currently part of the 13.3-acre Jungle Island property at 1111 Parrot Jungle Trail in Miami. The developers plan to build two up to 48-story luxury condo towers on the land they\u2019re buying from the city. Much of the existing waterfront Jungle Island theme park will become the $37 million public park paid for by the developers.\nThe assessed purchase price for the land that the developers are purchasing is $160 million, but the developers will provide much of that\nvia public benefits\n. At closing, Terra and ESJ will pay $10 million. They will also make annual payments to the city for 99 years, provide $20 million in public benefits, and $22 million to pay off a HUD loan to the Jungle Island property, according to a previous city meeting.\nAt Wednesday\u2019s meeting, board member Arthur Porosoff, a broker and developer, called the proposed 50 parking spaces \u201cfrustrating,\u201d and the larger discussion around parking a waste of time. He also said the planned public park was really a park for the 800 residents of the planned condominium component. He said the developers are \u201ctaking advantage of the people.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s be real,\u201d Porosoff said. \u201cThe reality is that it\u2019s a joke\u2026.This is an amenity for the building. I understand everybody gets paid a lot of dollars. I get paid big dollars. I\u2019m a developer. I like the story. I would hire you to tell the story, and I would hire you to convince them to agree with the story, but the fact of the matter is that this is not for the public. Am I going to vote for it? Yeah, I\u2019m a real estate guy. But the fact of the matter here is that this is a joke, and everybody knows it.\u201d\nPorosoff sought to extract more parking from the developer, but realized that the city no longer had leverage to do so.\n\u201cNow that I think about it, that\u2019s a moot point. You can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThe deal was already struck, and it\u2019s a bad deal that we did, in my mind.\u201d\n\nThe developers\u2019 attorney, Iris Escarra, said the city\u2019s parks department will dictate the design used to build the park, as well as how much parking to include. But the parking will cut into the 13-plus acres of park space.\nBoard member Joseph Corral also pressed the developers\u2019 team on parking, as well as how people will access the park.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to be skeptical,\u201d Corral said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard, because if you would have told the people they were voting for a referendum to build [up to 48]-story towers, it would have never passed. But the park is really all we saw. We all saw the beautiful renderings.\u201d\nThe park\u2019s designer, Daniel Vasini of West Eight, called the park a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a great bicycle lane so you can come here by bike,\u201d Vasini said.\nCorral interrupted him: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m being very serious,\u201d Vasini replied.\n\u201cHave you been on the MacArthur Causeway?\u201d Corral asked.\n",

        "content": "Less than a year after securing a trio of high-end tenants for a Gold Coast retail space, Fred Latsko is putting the property on the market.\nThe Chicago developer tapped Newmark brokers to sell the 4,200-square-foot building at 900 North Rush Street, which sits at the base of a 17-story condo tower at 40 East Delaware Place, CoStar\nreported\n.\nThe space is fully leased to international\nfashion brands\n: California-based Rails, Danish label Ganni and Toronto jeweler Mejuri. The leases, announced late last year, marked a notable reactivation of a former Intermix boutique in one of Chicago\u2019s priciest retail corridors.\nLatsko declined to disclose an asking price, but a Newmark marketing brochure shows the tenants have a weighted average lease term of nearly 10 years and collectively generate more than $1.5 million in annual net operating income, the outlet reported. The offering is being marketed by brokers\nKeely Polczynski\n, Conor Lalor, Kyle Minter, Brian Schneiderman, Eric Williams and Mat Adler.\nPersistently high borrowing costs have kept many investors sidelined. But the property\u2019s timing could benefit from renewed leasing momentum across Rush, Oak and Walton streets, where brands including Kith, Skims, Cartier and Brandy Melville have recently taken space.\n\nGanni\u2019s deal at 900 North Rush marked the brand\u2019s first Midwest location, while Latsko has also drawn Bottega Veneta to his nearby property at 41 East Oak Street. He refinanced that building, along with 900 North Rush and two others nearby, with a $34 million loan from JDI Realty in 2023 \u2014 less than a previous\n$43.6 million Loancore loan\n.\nLatsko\u2019s latest listing adds to a small but active pool of\nGold Coast\nretail trades, where strong tenant rosters have helped sellers push through interest-rate headwinds.\nInstitutional capital has largely retreated from the market, but long-term investors seeking trophy retail exposure continue to hunt in Chicago\u2019s luxury shopping areas.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A unit in a church-to-condo conversion dubbed The Abbey has blessed Fort Greene with a new price record.\nOriginally asking $3.85 million off-market, a bidding war pushed the purchase price of unit 9 to $4.07 million, with the buyer agreeing to cover $83,000 in transfer taxes, according to Douglas Elliman\u2019s Jessica Peters, who is leading sales at the building with Daniel Fried. The purchase price includes a $20,000 storage unit.\nThe final price, including concessions for the 2,023-square-foot home, puts the deal at $2,052 per square foot, a new per-foot record in the neighborhood.\nThe three-bedroom home retained several original Gothic revival-style arched windows in the living room and bedrooms, with the bedrooms featuring circular stained glass above lancet arches.\nThe open-concept great room features a 20-foot vaulted ceiling that looks up to a hexagonal dome overhead. The side-by-side 36-inch Sub-Zero fridge and freezer are paneled into the wall, and the home comes with a library ladder to reach upper-level cabinetry.\nCompleted in 1888, the church was converted into rentals in 2016 before KSR Development scooped up the property for over $12 million in 2024 to turn it into luxury condos. Peters and Fried have sold eight of the 12 condos, including unit 10, which sits in the church\u2019s original bell tower, which was priced at $4 million. The building has a projected sellout of nearly $27 million, with studios starting at just under $1.4 million, one-bedrooms starting at $1.6 million and two-bedrooms beginning at $1.9 million.\n\nThe building also boasts some new-fangled amenities, including a fitness center and a sauna in the basement.\nPricing The Abbey proved to be a challenge in a neighborhood mostly filled with historic townhouses and brownstone condo conversions. Two units in the building couldn\u2019t even be appraised, according to Peters, who got an exception through one of her preferred lenders.\n\u201cNone of the comps showed us anything higher than $1,675, $1,700 a foot,\u201d Peters said. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare that you get to see something like this. So I think just our gut instinct was to price it the way we felt it should be priced, and it worked.\u201d\nThe previous record-holder in terms of price per square foot appears to be unit 4 at 242 Adelphi Street, which sold for $3.4 million in 2023, or $1,946 per square foot. The top-floor duplex in the converted townhouse went for nearly 30 percent over its asking price.\nEarlier this year, an unfinished five-story townhouse at 39 South Portland Avenue\nsold for $8.75 million in an all-cash deal\n, marking the priciest residential sale in Fort Greene. The $1,365 price per square foot of that sale still falls far short of the per-square-foot prices at The Abbey.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen in Fort Greene is that buyers are willing to pay the price points for special things,\u201d Peters said.\n",

They will be relocated under the proposal, according to a filing in Delaware\u2019s bankruptcy court. The Seaquarium has been operational since 1954.\nTerra\u2019s Resilient Aquarium LLC plans to pump up to $100 million into renovating, modernizing and redeveloping the Seaquarium. That plan includes adding restaurants, retail and a new marina with wet and dry boat storage for up to 350 vessels. Court filings show he plans a new accredited aquarium, aquatic experiences, wellness spaces, a fisherman\u2019s village, and an education, conservation and research center. The historic Buckminster Fuller Seaquarium dome and the Flipper House would be preserved and repurposed for event space.\n\u201cThis ruling affirms that our team\u2019s vision, track record, and ability to execute is the right path forward for the Seaquarium,\u201d Martin said in a statement.\n\nThe current operator, MS Leisure Company, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April. Miami-Dade County moved to evict the company last year, but the\neviction proceedings\nwere stayed as a result of the bankruptcy filing.\nThe county, and activists, have alleged the current operator failed to maintain the property in good repair and clean condition. Miami-Dade alleged that MS Leisure violated the federal Marine Mammal Act and Animal Welfare Act, citing substandard animal care. In 2023, the orca Tokitae, also known as Lolita, died in her tank of renal failure, following a decades-long effort by activists to retire her to a sanctuary.\nMS Leisure\u2019s parent company, the Mexico-based Dolphin Company, is developing a plan to transfer animals to alternative locations.\nThe actual sale and transfer of the lease has to occur 30 days after the final county approval, and no later than May 15, 2026.\nMartin\u2019s other projects include the\nplanned redevelopment\nof Jungle Island on Watson Island in Miami. This week, the city\u2019s planning, zoning and appeals board\napproved a resolution\ntied to the rezoning of a portion of that property where Terra and its partner ESJ Capital Partners plans condo towers.\n",

Listing sites show the deal has closed, but the deed has yet to appear in public records.\nLawrence A. Moens\nwith Lawrence A. Moens Associates had the listing, and Marley Overman with Illustrated Properties brought the buyer.\nMondre is co-CEO of the Menlo Park-based private equity firm Silver Lake. Forbes estimates his net worth at $2.3 billion. He sits on the boards of GoodRx, Fanatics, Vantage Data Centers North America and media firm Red Ventures, according to Silver Lake\u2019s website. Ric Elias, the billionaire Red Ventures co-founder and CEO, sold his Palm Beach mansion for\n$73 million\nin March.\nIt\u2019s not Mondre\u2019s first Palm Beach purchase. Sources confirmed he was the hidden buyer in the\n$31 million\npurchase of the house at 1160 North Ocean Boulevard in March. Overman, along with Serhant\u2019s Gary Pohrer, has the listing for the home, which is being advertised as a teardown for $39.5 million, according to Zillow.\n\nRecords show Mondre also owns a home in the exclusive Lost Tree Village community in North Palm Beach. He bought the house at 11739 Lost Tree Way for $7.2 million in 2018, according to property records. That brings his total spend in Palm Beach County to at least $96.2 million.\nThe 1.2-acre lot at 965 North Ocean Boulevard has 150 feet of waterfront. Stock, who heads Naples-based Stock Development, bought the site for $34.2 million in 2021, according to property records. His efforts to build a spec mansion on the site stalled out after Palm Beach\u2019s Architectural Commission rejected proposed designs.\nMondre\u2019s neighbors on either side of the North Ocean Boulevard property will be Phillies owners John and Leigh Middleton, who bought their home at 947 North Ocean Boulevard for $19.3 million in 2010, and chemical heiress Nicole du Pont Limbocker at 977 North Ocean Boulevard, property records show.\nDeals are ramping up in Palm Beach as the island\u2019s busy season approaches. Earlier this month, billionaire SC Johnson heiress Winifred Johnson-Marquart dropped\n$30 million\non a landmarked home on the island.",

At stake is $185 million in funding, which would make up about 13 percent of the Chicago agency\u2019s 2025-26 budget.\n\u201cThe HUD certifications cite several recent Executive Orders but provide no additional information or clarification on these requirements beyond the language in the application,\u201d according to the press release.\n\nThe CHA is also anticipating similar restrictions to future HUD allocations which could affect up to $1 billion in funding for the agency, which serves 135,000 Chicago residents. Local housing authorities typically get the majority of their funding from HUD.\nThe local agency is seeking a temporary restraining order.\n\u201cWe are asking the court to step in and provide guidance on the lawfulness of the conditions HUD is seeking to impose,\u201d said\nCHA Operating Chairman Matthew Brewer\nin the news release. \u201cThis intervention is a necessary last resort since our discussions with HUD have been limited due to the government shutdown.\u201d\nThe press release also noted that a similar case is ongoing in Rhode Island and requests that a judge consider the outcome of that litigation, as well.\nThe lawsuit landed amid leadership flux and political crosswinds for the CHA. Brewer, a commercial litigation attorney and longtime CHA board commissioner, was appointed as the agency\u2019s operating chairman in September after months of turbulence.\nMayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s pick to lead the CHA, former\n27th Ward Alderman Walter Burnett Jr.\n, has been sidelined from assuming its CEO position, at least temporarily, since Brewer asked HUD to review Burnett\u2019s potential conflicts of interest tied to his three decades as a Chicago City Council member and ownership of three properties rented by CHA voucher holders.\nThe leadership churn comes during heightened scrutiny of the CHA board due to revelations that one of its members,\nDebra Parker\n, has family members and a boyfriend with businesses that have scored nearly $22 million in contracts with the agency in recent years.",

Opponents warn it could overwhelm neighborhood infrastructure and sideline residents in future development decisions.\nThe new zoning map reclassifies most of Broadway between Winona Street and Montrose Avenue to allow buildings up to about 80 feet tall and a variety of uses including bars, dispensaries, tattoo parlors and salons. A new pedestrian-street overlay will prohibit curb cuts and surface parking and require drive-thru businesses to maintain a walkable streetscape.\n\nMost of Broadway will shift to mixed-use community shopping district zoning, following community feedback about the larger lot sizes there. Their designation permits ground-floor retail with\napartments\nor condos above but restrict liquor and bar uses to cases approved through special-use permits.\nThe final version of the ordinance followed a heated neighborhood battle. One group,\nSave Edgewater\n, hired a lawyer and paid for billboards opposing the changes, warning they would usher in out-of-scale density. Pro-upzoning residents launched their own online campaign, petitions and even tongue-in-cheek flyers mocking resistance efforts.\nUnder the new rules, any\nproject\ntopping 80 feet or exceeding 100 residential units will still face a full planned development review, requiring public input and city approval. City planners framed the policy as a balance between enabling growth and preserving character.\nOfficials said the rezoning should make it easier to add housing and amenities near transit without piecemeal negotiations for each site, allowing for more predictability in development planning.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "SummerHill Homes\ntook a major leap in its plans to redevelop Los Gatos Lodge.\nThe San Ramon-based developer purchased the 8.8-acre property for $78.4 million, the Silicon Valley Business Journal\nreported\n. The seller was Los Gatos Lodge LLC, an entity managed by Half Moon Bay resident Keet Nerhan. The price works out to $8.9 million per acre.\nThe 128-room Los Gatos Lodge, at 50 Saratoga-Los Gatos Road in Los Gatos, was built in 1936 and spans more than 46,000 square feet. The owner had an asking price of $100 million, or $781,250 per key, in 2022.\nThe town of\nLos Gatos\nsigned off on SummerHill\u2019s development proposal in March, which includes the demolition of the vintage motel and construction of a 155-unit residential community.\nThe development is planned as 28 three-story attached buildings with four to six for-sale townhome-style condominiums per building. Each unit would span between 1,300 and 2,200 square feet.\n\nSummerHill Homes will take advantage of the state density bonus, granting the developer the ability to skirt zoning restrictions and receive waivers for certain regulations if their developments include affordable units for very-low-income to moderate-income households. The firm will build 26 below-market-rate condos to meet that requirement. A household of four people in\nSanta Clara County\nis considered very-low-income with $100,450 annually.\n\u201cIt meets that state law requirement, and this is one of the better state law requirements that\u2019s coming to us,\u201d Los Gatos town councilmember Rob Rennie said of the plan.\nOn the other side of the Bay, in SummerHill\u2019s home city of San Ramon, the developer is building another residential community as part of\nBishop Ranch\u2019s transformation\nfrom office park to mixed-use community.\nThat development, a 404-townhome community called City Village, began construction in 2022 and will open next spring; units at the community have already been pre-sold.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The $1 billion Sapphire Bay development on Lake Ray Hubbard is once again in troubled waters.\nThe Rowlett City Council voted this week to issue a notice of default to Sapphire Bay Land Holdings I, the developer behind the long-delayed mixed-use project that was once billed as a resort-style game-changer for the suburb east of Dallas, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe vote followed a month of council meetings and years of growing frustration over stalled progress on the\nproject\n, which was approved in 2019 after\nRowlett\ncut ties with its original development partner, Bayside Land Partners.\nMayor Jeff Winget said the city \u201ccan no longer tolerate the absence of progress\u201d on promises first made to residents a decade ago.\nUnder the city\u2019s development agreement, Sapphire Bay Holdings was obligated to pour about $1 billion into the 117-acre site, building 1.4 million square feet of commercial space and 1,600 residential units. While parts of the peninsula now house a marina, single-family homes, a restaurant and an apartment complex, the central section \u2014 which included plans for a hotel, conference center and man-made lagoon \u2014 remains largely untouched.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just nothing else that\u2019s happened,\u201d Winget said. \u201cThat heart of the development that was supposed to drive our tax base hasn\u2019t come to fruition.\u201d\n\nSapphire Bay\u2019s president declined to comment to KXAS, saying only that the company\u2019s attorneys were preparing a response to the city\u2019s notice.\nThe default marks the latest in a series of setbacks for the high-profile project. In 2023, a fire damaged the\nView at Sapphire Bay\n, a 400-unit apartment complex from Dallas homebuilder Zale Properties that was nearing completion, though some units have since opened.\nDespite the standoff,\nRowlett\nofficials insist the city\u2019s vision for a regional entertainment destination on Lake Ray Hubbard is intact. The area\u2019s zoning caps further residential development, forcing any future buildout to lean heavily on commercial and hospitality uses.\n\u201cWe still believe the peninsula is incredibly valuable,\u201d Winget said. \u201cWe want to see something really great go in there \u2014 whether it\u2019s with this developer or a different developer.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "RFR\u2019s Michael Fuchs is in danger of losing yet another home as the financial fallout of his high-profile divorce drags on.\nCity National Bank filed a foreclosure lawsuit against him and his limited liability company that owns 797 Meadow Lane in Southampton, Newsday\nreported\n. Fuchs is listed as the borrower on loan documents tied to the property on the famed Hamptons street.\nThe developer landed a $4 million adjustable-rate mortgage when he purchased the property in 2014 for $6 million. As of a week and a half ago, Fuchs owed $3.7 million, according to the bank.\nFuchs has been looking to sell the property for months. In March, he listed the property alongside a larger 4,700-square-foot estate\nfor $44 million\n. The larger property at 809 Meadow Lane ultimately sold in the summer for $26 million, but not 797 Meadow Lane.\nAfter that sale, HSBC, which provided a $20 million loan to help pay for his multimillion-dollar divorce settlement, alleged Fuchs failed to pay off the loan when it came due in December.\nThe London-based bank\nfiled a motion\nfor a summary judgment against Fuchs and a limited liability company tied to the estate, which guaranteed the loan. It is demanding just over $20 million in unpaid principal plus interest, according to the filing in state Supreme Court.\n\nLast month, meanwhile, the smaller 700-square-foot cottage on Shinnecock Bay reappeared on the market with an $8.5 million ask.\nFuchs and Alvina Collardeau divorced in 2020 after eight years of marriage, putting homes in the Hamptons, Manhattan, Paris, Miami, Cap d\u2019Antibes on the French Riviera, Capri and London into play.\nTwo years later, a British High Court judge granted Collardeau a $44 million judgment. Another judge ordered the sale of the cottage last month after Collardeau alleged Fuchs was missing mandated payments.\nIn the spring, Citibank \u2014 which provided a $3.26 million mortgage to Fuchs for a prewar condo at 302 West 12th Street in the West Village \u2014 filed a\nforeclosure suit\nafter the RFR co-founder stopped making monthly payments in May 2024, according to the complaint filed in New York State Supreme Court.\nThe lender is calling for the sale of the 1,000-square-foot pad, which Fuchs bought from comedian Seth Meyers in 2018.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Bastion\u2019s other South Florida concepts are the two-Michelin-starred L\u2019Atelier de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon and the Michelin-starred Le Jardinier in the Miami Design District.\nThe 178-seat Seia restaurant and the Seia club, with interiors designed by Zervudachi, Roberts and Macadam, are expected to open next year, the release says. The venue also will have an exclusive caf\u00e9 for tenants.\n830 Brickell tenants will receive Seia club invitations, with membership costing a $25,000 initiation fee and $5,000 in annual dues, according to the Bastion spokesperson.\n\nOKO and London-based Cain International, led by Jonathan Goldstein, finished development of 830 Brickell last year at 830 Brickell Plaza in Miami, after a roughly two-year completion delay. It is the first standalone office building in the Brickell Financial District in more than a decade.\nThe tower reaped a\nleasing bonanza\ndue to its fortunate timing: It was under construction during the pandemic-era influx of out-of-state companies to South Florida, many of whom sought top tier office spaces and signed up for space at 830 Brickell. The tower is fully leased.\nTenants include law firms Kirkland &amp; Ellis and Sidley Austin, Microsoft, insurance firms Marsh and A-Cap, and financial services firm Corient (previously called CI Financial). Also, billionaire hedge funder Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel and Citadel Securities have offices at 830 Brickell, after Griffin moved the firms\u2019 headquarters from Chicago to Miami in 2022.\nThe Seia restaurant and club announcement comes after a previously planned hospitality concept at 830 Brickell fizzled out.\nIn December, OKO and Tao Group Hospitality said they will open a Mediterranean restaurant and\nclub with a members-only loung\ne on the top two floors. At some point after that, the firms nixed the project. Tao is led by Noah Tepperberg and Jason Strauss.",

        "content": "Austin planners are scrambling to recalibrate downtown development rules after a new state law stripped cities of their power to regulate density.\nSenate Bill 840, which took effect in\nSeptember\n, bans local limits on floor-to-area ratios for residential projects \u2014 a change that upends the city\u2019s long-standing system for shaping growth in the\nCentral Business District\n, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nBefore the\nlaw\n, Austin used FAR caps to control size and density downtown, requiring developers to join the Downtown Density Bonus Program if they wanted to go bigger. The program traded extra height and density for public benefits such as affordable housing units or financial contributions to housing funds.\nWithout FAR restrictions, planners say the density program could lose its leverage \u2014 unless the city imposes new height limits.\n\u201cWe have to put in a height limit to make the Downtown Density Bonus Program continue to work,\u201d city planner Alan Pani said during a Planning Commission meeting.\nCity staff proposed a 350-foot height cap for Central Business District projects, with anything taller required to go through the density-bonus program.\nBut the Planning Commission recommended doubling the limit to 700 feet for projects in downtown\u2019s core and the Rainey Street area to maintain developer flexibility and avoid stifling growth. The final decision will rest with the City Council.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see us miss out on additional density, more riders for transit, more tax revenue and more neighbors,\u201d Commissioner Danielle Skidmore said.\nAustin\u2019s skyline already soars well above those thresholds.\n\nOnly three towers top 700 feet. The 74-story Waterline, a Lincoln Property and Kairoi Residential project slated to deliver 352 luxury apartments next year stands at 1,021 feet. Meta\u2019s\nSixth and Guadalupe\nreaches 875 feet.

The Coca-Cola Building, built in 1939, was designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1975.\nReyes Coca-Cola Bottling, which operates out of the building and distributes the soda to the West Coast and Midwest, plans to restore the exterior of the nearly century-old structure and remodel the interior for continued use.\nThe building will also receive a new rooftop deck ahead of upcoming international sporting events in the city. An existing patio will be redone so Coca-Cola and Reyes can host events there during the\n2026 FIFA World Cup\nand\n2028 Summer Olympics\n.\n\nReyes Coca-Cola Bottling is looking to restore the building\u2019s windows to the original design from architect Robert V. Derrah. It might also update the building\u2019s paint scheme. Mechanical equipment that would be added to the rooftop in the future would be relocated to avoid visibility from passersby. The rooftop deck will boast additional privacy by being set back from the exterior to avoid visibility from the street.\nThe interior of the building, converted into office space years ago, will get a makeover as part of the endeavor, with plans calling for a phased redesign with a more open floor plan. Gensler is designing the building\u2019s new look, while Chattel Incorporated and\nRyan Companies\nare handling project planning.\nDerrah originally designed the building in 1936 and construction was completed three years later. Derrah designed the building to look like an ocean liner, complete with porthole windows and decorations like life preservers on the inside that read \u201cS.S. Coca-Cola.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The man who made\nJamie Dimon\nworry about a wave of commercial mortgage fraud is a California multifamily player and big-time Republican donor,\nGerald Marcil\n, who is now facing serious legal allegations.\nMarcil was among the defendants named in a complaint filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court this week accusing the investor of manipulating loan structures that left Zions Bancorporation and\nWestern Alliance Bancorporation\nout in the cold when properties tied to their financing went bust, Bloomberg\nreported\n.\nZions subsidiary\nCalifornia Bank &amp; Trust\nclaims it lent more than $60 million to an investor group that listed 16 properties as collateral; six of those assets were investments under Newport Beach-based limited liability company MOM CA Investco, which filed for bankruptcy in February.\nWhen California Bank &amp; Trust underwrote the loans in 2016 and 2017, the company ensured it enjoyed lender protections, namely that it would be first in line for repayment if the borrower defaulted and liquidated its assets.\nSan Diego-based California Bank &amp; Trust said it later discovered other lenders actually held liens on several of those same buildings, thus rendering Zions\u2019 protection obsolete when the assets went into liquidation.\nPhoenix-based Western Alliance Bancorp filed a similar complaint in August, saying the same investor group, led by Gerald Marcil, Andrew Stupin and Deba Shyam, owes it nearly $99 million. The bank alleges the group hid the fact that some of the collateral properties were already in foreclosure, in turn undermining the bank\u2019s repayment rights.\nMOM CA Investco was launched in 2021 by Mohammad Honarkar and Mahender Makhijani. At the time, Makhijani acquired and managed distressed real estate for investors through an entity called Continuum Analytics. Marcil and Stupin were among Continuum\u2019s largest investors, while Shyam is its legal owner.\n\nThe relationship fell apart after Honarkar accused his partners of fraud. Makhijani at one point used armed guards to take over some of the properties and reportedly hired mobile billboards to drive around\nLaguna Beach\ndisplaying pictures of Honarkar and accusing him and two city employees of corruption.\nThe firm\u2019s Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, which covered a hotel in Laguna Beach and a $65 million apartment complex in Redlands, was dismissed in August after the parties failed to reach a restructuring deal.\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is keeping a close eye on the market as regional banks are tied to borrowers accused of fraud.\n\u201cMy antenna goes up when things like that happen,\u201d Dimon told analysts on a call this week,\nper\nCNN. \u201cAnd I probably shouldn\u2019t say this, but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more\u2026 Everyone should be forewarned on this.\u201d\nMarcil and Stupin contest the charges.\n\u201cMy clients vehemently deny all the allegations of wrongdoing,\u201d Brandon Tran, an attorney representing Marcil and Stupin, told Bloomberg. \u201cThese claims are unfounded and misrepresent the facts. We are confident that once all the evidence is presented, our clients will be fully vindicated.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Morgan Asset Management\nand Harrison Street Real Estate Capital, has been marketing the 320,000-square-foot building along the North Branch as a turnkey opportunity for a major tenant. But so far, no takers.\nThe potential seizure would mark another blow to Sterling Bay\u2019s $6 billion Lincoln Yards vision, which won City Council approval in 2019 but has since stalled amid shifting market conditions.\nEarlier this year, Sterling Bay surrendered the northern portion of the project site to Bank OZK to settle another outstanding loan. The bank has since sold that\n28-acre tract\nto JDL Development and Kayne Anderson Real Estate, which plan to redevelop it as\nFoundry Park\n, with nearly 3,300 residential units.\nSterling Bay declined to comment.\n\nThe Concord building was conceived as a biotech hub meant to anchor the southern half of Lincoln Yards. Instead, it sat vacant for more than a year as Chicago\u2019s fledgling life sciences scene has clustered in more established neighborhoods like Fulton Market and the Illinois Medical District.\nMarketing materials from Eastdil Secured and Savills tout the property as a \u201cblank slate\u201d for an anchor tenant seeking modern lab or office space.\nBank OZK\nexecutives have hinted they\u2019re open to repositioning the property.\n\u201cGetting a user in the space to pay rent is what it\u2019s all about,\u201d president Brannon Hamblen told analysts, noting that the bank could repurpose funds earmarked for lab buildouts toward traditional office tenants instead.\nThe lender wrote down about $5.1 million on the debt, which now carries a $59 million balance after applying reserves, according to the filing.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

A formal call for offers is expected next month.\nThere\u2019s no asking price, but the site\u2019s scale and flexibility could attract a single corporate user or a redevelopment play. The Colin Central Appraisal District assessed the building\u2019s\ntaxable value\nat $51 million. It was constructed in 1995 and extensive upgrades were logged in 2007.\n\u201cIn this part of the metroplex, there are not many 300,000-square-foot vacancies available, and there are not any available options that come with this much excess land,\u201d Haworth told the outlet. \u201cThe location is best suited to attract a large single user, rather than a mix of tenants.\u201d\n\nThe sale followed Globe Life\u2019s decision to move its headquarters to\n7677 Henneman Way\nthis summer, a 200,000-square-foot office the firm purchased in July from Florida-based SouthState Corp. That building, 4 miles north of the Stonebridge site, is part of the former Independent Bank campus that SouthState acquired earlier this year for $2 billion.\nGlobe Life will relocate more than 3,000 employees to the new building by year\u2019s end.\nThe\nStonebridge\nproperty\u2019s listing adds to a wave of major suburban office availability across the metroplex. Other large campuses up for grabs include the former JCPenney headquarters in Plano, American Airlines\u2019 previous campus in Fort Worth, and ExxonMobil\u2019s old Irving property.\nThe region now has roughly 62 million square feet of vacant office space, with another 2 million under development, according to CBRE.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Clearly, Marc Holliday wasn\u2019t interested in another defeat this fall.\nSpeaking of casino bids, one of the few to move on to the next round of the process suddenly tossed its cards this week.\nMGM Resorts \u2014 considered a shoo-in for one of three casino licenses \u2014\nwithdrew its proposal\nfor a $2.3 billion expansion of its facility in Yonkers.\nThe gaming giant blamed the decision on \u201ca newly defined competitive landscape,\u201d noting the remaining proposals were clustered in a \u201csmall geographic area.\u201d\nMGM also relied on receiving an initial 30-year license, but based on rules issued by the state last week, the Yonkers proposal would only qualify for 15 years.\nThe Queens Aqueduct, Steve Cohen\u2019s Metropolitan Park in Flushing and Bally\u2019s Bronx project are all that remain. The state does not have to award all three available licenses, meaning the competitors can\u2019t start counting their chips just yet.\n\nIn other news, a lender is\npursuing\ntwo non-judicial foreclosures on equity interests tied to two phases of Fordham Landing, a multi-billion-dollar mixed-use development along the Harlem River in the Bronx. Dynamic Star, led by Gary Segal and Brad Zackson, is developing the megaproject with Namdar and Gorjian Acquisitions.\nA mysterious lender alleges debts are owed on a $55.1 million loan tied to 320 West Fordham Road, as well as $18.9 million tied to a loan for 2371 Exterior Street, 2391 and 2401 Exterior Street and 2444 Exterior Street.\nTwo foreclosure auctions are scheduled for Dec. 2.\nWhile Fordham Landing is facing threats, the Brooklyn Mirage\nappears doomed\n. The East Williamsburg building\u2019s owner filed for a demolition permit for at least part of the live music venue, part of a bigger space called Avant Gardner. The application is for a full demolition of 32,000 square feet.\nThe demolition would be the culmination of a tumultuous series of months, which included canceled shows, bankruptcy filings and overrun renovation costs.\nOn the culture beat, the Metropolitan Museum of Art is getting involved in its own real estate wheeling and dealing.\nThe museum\nsigned a deal\nto sell a pair of townhomes on East 82nd Street on the Upper East Side last asking $28 million. The buyer signed a contract two weeks after the homes went up for sale and plans to convert them into one single-family residence.\n",

        "content": "The gloves are coming off for house hunters in Brooklyn.\nLast month, one in four homes in the borough sold for more than its asking price \u2014 a metric typically indicating a property traded after a bidding war. Of the 10 New York City neighborhoods with the highest share of homes sold over asking, six were in Brooklyn, according to a\nStreeteasy report\npublished Thursday.\nHeightened competition among buyers is a natural next step for the borough\u2019s residential market, where\nprices have been climbing\nsince pandemic changes drove up demand. Brooklyn logged nearly 500 inked deals in September, up 11 percent from the same period last year.\nSome high-profile buyers have even swapped their Manhattan homes for pads in Brooklyn, setting new records. Last year, Glossier founder Emily Weiss and her partner, fintech executive William Gaybrick, paid\n$22 million\nfor a Brooklyn Heights townhouse just five months after buying a Greenwich Village abode for $18 million, which they subsequently put back on the market.\nProspect Heights claimed the largest share of homes selling over asking, at 47 percent. The median asking price was $1.3 million. Earlier this year, Redfin labeled the neighborhood, along with the adjacent Clinton Hill,\nthe most desirable\nin the country. The number of home sales in the enclave doubled in a year.\nNext up was Park Slope with 44 percent of homes selling above their asking prices. A townhouse at 535 First Street broke neighborhood records last month when Jared Vinik, the son of Tampa Bay Lightning owner Jeff Vinik, bought it for\n$14 million\n.\nBoth Park Slope and Prospect Heights ranked higher in homes with above-ask closing prices than some desirable Manhattan enclaves, including the\nWest Village\nand Greenwich Village.\nRounding out the top five on Streeteasy\u2019s list was Brooklyn Heights, long recognized for its pricey townhomes, where 33 percent of homes sold over asking. The other Brooklyn neighborhoods included were Crown Heights, Williamsburg and Sheepshead Bay.\nAcross the five boroughs, the residential market is heading into the fourth quarter on a promising note. More than 1,700 homes found buyers last month, up 10 percent from year-ago numbers, and the highest total for September since 2021.\n\nSo far, it appears supply is keeping up with demand, with roughly 4,600 homes hitting the market last month, marking a 10 percent increase from last year.\nNot so fast\u2026\nJust what the West Village needs: another double-wide townhouse.\nA whopping 13,000-square-foot home in the neighborhood\nhit the market\non Friday with a $75 million price tag. If it trades for that price, it will set a new record for Downtown Manhattan, displacing another megamansion that sold for $73 million just last year.\nBefore the home at 105-107 Bank Street was combined into one, each side of the monster residence housed its own storied residents, including John Lennon and Yoko Ono and composer John Cage.\nThe creation of these massive single-family residences has drawn criticism, especially in recent years, as the city grapples with a housing crunch. In Manhattan, researchers found that for each of these combinations, the borough lost between six and seven housing units.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe priciest deal recorded in the city rolls this week was for a penthouse at 111 West 56th Street, which sold for $12.3 million, or $4,400 per square foot. The condo, which hit the market last April asking just under $15 million, has four bedrooms, four bathrooms and two terraces.\nUnit PHC is one of 99 condos atop the\nThompson Central Park Hotel\n. Amenities at the development, known as One11 Residences, include a fitness center, private lounge and access to the hotel\u2019s concierge service.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Maria Mainieri, Taylor Middleton and Peter Evangelidis are heading sales for the developer, GFI Capital Resources.",

        "authors": "By Elizabeth Cryan",

        "content": "A restaurateur signs a 15-year lease, then has a debilitating stroke. What happens next plays out in two very different versions, depending on who\u2019s telling the story.\nWhen Keith McNally suffered a major stroke in 2016, the famed restaurateur behind Pastis, Balthazar and Minetta Tavern feared his career and his body had collapsed for good. To make matters worse, the man who once ruled New York\u2019s dining scene suddenly found himself trapped in a business deal he could no longer execute. He\u2019d leased a Meatpacking District space to reopen his iconic restaurant Pastis, backed by a $1 million personal guarantee.\nIn his memoir \u201cI Regret Almost Everything,\u201d McNally recounts the episode as a near-tragic twist. Unable to walk or speak clearly, McNally put his daughter Sophie in charge of the business. He says she begged the landlords, Aurora Capital\u2019s Bobby Cayre and Jared Epstein, to release him from the lease. They refused, he wrote, at the urging of a mysterious \u201cthird partner,\u201d later identified as William Gottlieb Real Estate\u2019s Neil Bender. Facing financial strain and depression, McNally describes feeling cornered.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly afford to lose a million dollars, yet I was in no condition to build a restaurant,\u201d he wrote.\nEpstein tells a very different story. In his version, there was no threat to execute the guarantee, no heartless landlord tightening the screws on an ailing tenant.\n\u201cWe were never going to go after his personal guarantee,\u201d Epstein said in a phone interview. \u201cForget it being not a good thing to do as a business person. I believe it\u2019s a terrible thing to do as a human being \u2014 to prey on someone after they had a terrible medical problem in their life.\u201d\nAccording to Epstein, Sophie reached out soon after her father\u2019s health crisis to say she would carry the project forward. But when their investor pulled out, she needed time to find new funding. Rather than push back, Epstein said, Aurora worked with the McNallys to find potential partners. One of those introductions, to restaurateur Stephen Starr, ultimately revived the project. Starr partnered with McNally to reopen Pastis in 2019, to instant acclaim and two stars from The New York Times.\nFollowing the restaurant\u2019s success, McNally and Starr went on to open locations in Miami and Washington, D.C.\nEpstein said he was especially miffed by McNally\u2019s description of him in the book as \u201cobnoxious.\u201d He suspects the jab stems from a later clash, when he privately messaged McNally after the restaurateur posted something \u201cvery insensitive\u201d on Instagram following Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack on Israel, he said.\nFor Epstein, the book\u2019s portrayal of events feels like misplaced resentment.\n\u201cWe saved his legacy brand,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cInstead of vengeance, he should actually be sending us flowers thanking us.\u201d\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Rhode Island-based MCM just\nsold a portfolio\nof four nonunion Manhattan hotels for $489.8 million to a group of institutional investors, the largest Big Apple hotel sale since the\nSafe Hotels Act\nwent into effect in May. Before the bill passed, critics warned that its staffing mandates could cripple many of the city\u2019s hotels, driving up overhead and eroding their value. In the end, was it all much ado about nothing? Send a note to\nelizabeth.cryan@therealdeal.com\nwith your thoughts.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nJPMorgan is requiring employees to provide an iris or fingerprint scan to access its new, $3 billion Manhattan headquarters, the\nFinancial Times reported\n. The bank is also requiring employees to use a mobile app to access the building\u2019s services, giving the bank an unprecedented amount of personal data on each of the 10,000 employees expected to be working at the building by the end of the year.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2013 New York City has halted its plan to add dedicated bus lanes along 34th Street after the Trump administration threatened to withhold federal funding and approvals for other transit projects, according to\nThe New York Times\n. The Federal Highway Administration said the pause was prompted by concerns about the project\u2019s impact on trucks and emergency vehicles. The lanes are expected to speed up service for 28,000 daily riders by up to 15 percent.\n\u2013 Former financier Howard Rubin\u2019s estranged wife, Mary Henry, urged a judge to release the accused sex trafficker on a $50 million bond, describing him as a devoted grandfather, the\nNew York Post\nreported. In a court letter, she said Rubin, 70, should be free to spend time with his three young grandchildren while awaiting trial.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$15.9 million\nfor a 3,251-square-foot condominium at The Greenwich Lane, 155 West 11th Street in the West Village. Noble Black, formerly with Douglass Elliman, had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$231.2 million\nfor The New York Edition hotel at 5 Madison Avenue in Flatiron. The property has 252,109 square feet and 51 stories.\nThe Real Deal\nwrote about\nthis and another recent hotel transaction.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$18 million\nfor a 4,156-square-foot condo unit at 445 Lafayette Street in Noho. Zack Sosne and Craig Roth with NextStop NY have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 24,785-square-foot, seven-story mixed-use project at 172-10 Jamaica Avenue. Mosharraf Hossain filed the permit on behalf of developer Gouranga Kundu.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "As artificial intelligence\u2019s foothold grows in San Francisco, so too do rent prices.\nAI startup Cluely, for example, is\nplaying a part in the rent increase\n, the New York Times\nreported\n.\nAfter landing $5.3 million in seed funding this spring, its 22-year-old founder Roy Lee inked leases for eight high-end apartments in San Francisco\u2019s South of Market neighborhood, steps from the company\u2019s office.\nUnits in the 16-story building fetch anywhere between $3,000 to $12,000 a month and come with concierge and cleaning services.\nApartment prices in San Francisco have climbed an average of 6 percent over the past year, more than double the 2.5 percent increase in New York City, according to CoStar data cited by the outlet.\nAverage rent for a San Francisco apartment is now $3,315 a month, just a few dollars behind the nation\u2019s highest, in New York City, at $3,360. In hot spots like Mission Bay, near\nOpenAI\n\u2019s headquarters, rents climbed 13 percent recently.\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it before,\u201d said Will Goodman, a principal at\nStrada Investment Group\n, which developed the luxury complex where Cluely leased. Half of the 501-unit complex\u2019s units were leased within two months of its May opening, he told the outlet.\n\nLines are forming around the block for apartment showings, with some renters flashing cash deposits on the spot. Last month, rent prices in the city\nsurpassed pre-pandemic highs\n.\nFor service workers and younger professionals, the crush is pushing affordability out of reach.\nRenters like Caroline Roche, a 25-year-old demand planner at Backroads, toured 25 apartments in a week to find a one-bedroom within her budget. Others have resorted to guerrilla tactics, such as posting flyers with their photos and phone numbers on telephone poles, to land a lease.\nIt\u2019s not just renters who are feeling the pinch of high demand and high prices.\nBuyers looking for luxury homes in San Francisco are having a\nharder time than ever to find mansions\n, as sales for those pricey abodes are up 14 percent year-over-year, while inventory is down 4.5 percent year-over-year.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The firm would have to pay the full amount to stave off a foreclosure auction.\nScape bought the SoFA site in 2020 for $16.5 million and landed the Madison Realty Capital financing the following year to build The Fay.\nThe tower opened late last year, adding residences to the district largely known for retail, restaurant, nightlife and entertainment. The project was hailed by\nSan Jose Mayor Matt Mahan\n, who said it would be the first of several high-rises needed to sustain the city\u2019s downtown revival.\n\n\u201cA big part of our success has to be residential density,\u201d Mahan said at the opening last December. \u201cThis is the first residential high-rise building we\u2019ve seen in a few years, and it certainly is not the last.\u201d\nThe foreclosure threat speaks to the troubles that\nBay Area multifamily developers\nhave faced in recent years, including high interest rates and construction cost inflation.\nCity officials are hopeful that completed towers like The Fay will help fuel the pedestrian and retail energy they envision for the South of First Area.\nIf\nMadison Realty Capital\nproceeds with the foreclosure, it would likely take possession of the building, potentially at a steep discount to replacement cost.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The Artificial Intelligence boom is shaping\nresidential\nand\noffice\nmarkets in San Francisco, but Texas has a big ol\u2019 dog in that fight called the\nPermian Basin\n.\nTexas will lead the way in AI data centers,\nespecially in West Texas\n, because of an oversupply of natural gas from the oilfield that created so much of the state\u2019s wealth in the first place.\nThat\u2019s the view of Texas real estate power player Ross Perot Jr., the Hillwood chairman who is also the chairman of the board of directors for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\u201cA stunning revolution\u201d is coming behind AI, and the U.S. can win out over China, Perot said at an\nIrving-Las Colinas Chamber of Commerce event\nthis week.\nThat excess natural gas in Texas is attracting AI data centers and related energy infrastructure development to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars, making it the second-biggest market for data centers behind Virginia.\nTexas and the country are well positioned for \u201cthe economic boom that we\u2019re going to have,\u201d Perot said.\n\u201cNorth America will dominate the world for the next 100 years,\u201d he\nsaid\n. \u201cIf we get immigration reform, energy reform and all the energy in North America brought to bear, no one can touch us.\u201d\nThe visionary behind Fort Worth\u2019s AllianceTexas has proven to see beyond the curve. Hillwood started Alliance 35 years ago as a cargo airport, now owned by the City of Fort Worth, and it grew into a mixed-use logistics hub with everything from a retail town center to soundstages for prolific \u201cYellowstone\u201d creator Taylor Sheridan.\nPerot warned that tariffs and overregulation could hold Texas back from \u201ceconomic freedom,\u201d and he hinted that the U.S. Chamber\u2019s lobbying helped persuade President Donald Trump to put a\n90-day pause\non his initial tariff plan.\nPoliticians aren\u2019t always speaking to reality regarding tariffs and immigration, Perot said.\n\n\u201cThey know the immigration problem, they know the tariff problem, and they\u2019re all working hard to try to get it fixed,\u201d Perot said,\naccording to\nthe Fort Worth Star-Telegram. \u201cBackstage, they know it. Onstage, you might get rhetoric, but our job at the chamber is to really work pure data backstage. And we\u2019re trusted by the elected officials. If we tell them something, they\u2019re going to know this isn\u2019t PR spin.\u201d\nPerot was early on Taylor Sheridan as well.\nSheridan has already filmed scenes from \u201cLandman\u201d in Alliance buildings undergoing a\n$65 million conversion\nto filming studios. Their deal was years in the making as Perot was bullish on Sheridan from the get-go.\n\u201cYou have a Fort Worth citizen, Taylor Sheridan, and his shows really do resonate with the Texas crowd and the U.S. crowd, and it\u2019s just a fluke we have him,\u201d Perot said in a talk to real estate students at\nTexas Christian University\nthis week.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I said: \u2018This guy generates so much activity. How do we embrace him as a city? How do we have filming here? And where will it go?\u201d\nMansion goes to auction\nThe softening luxury real estate market in North Texas led the sellers of a house in McKinney to\nbring it to auction\nto find a buyer. The Collin County house, last listed for $4.5 million, is owned by members of a car club and has a 6,500-square-foot auto showroom.\nHouston office market perks up\nDemand for office is picking up in Houston, which logged positive absorption for the second straight quarter. A massive\nheadquarters lease\nin Sugar Land led the pack recently.\n",

        "content": "Will\nSenate Bill 79\nbe the new builder\u2019s remedy for developers? It appears that it could be.\nThis may be why there was a scramble by the city of Los Angeles to push back on the transit-oriented housing bill after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed it into law last week. Much like builder\u2019s remedy, SB 79 provides the key to streamlined development, pushing through higher density residential developments at a faster clip. In SB79\u2019s case, the law uses proximity to a transit stop, whereas builder\u2019s remedy requires a city to be out of compliance with its housing element (a masterplan for future housing development).\nThe Los Angeles City Planning Department published\ndraft maps\nof the blocks that could be impacted by SB 79.\nThe new law allows for multifamily residential of as high as nine stories and as many as 160 units for parcels closest to a high traffic transit stop, considered a \u201ctier 1\u201d station under the law. In the case of tier two stations, a maximum height of eight stories and 140 units is allowed.\nCity Planning counted 33 stations in Los Angeles that can be categorized as tier 1 and another 117 tier 2 stations.\nCities have until July 1, 2026, when the new law goes into effect, to sort things out.\nSteve Cohen\u2019s Beverly Hills move\nIt wasn\u2019t casino-related news, although there\u2019s a story for that elsewhere on\nThe Real Deal\n. Instead,\nSteve Cohen\nmade news of another kind when his Beverly Hills mansion, which is seeking $35 million, topped last week\u2019s Los Angeles County homes that went into contract.\nThe New York Mets billionaire owner has been in the news cycle for some time with his proposed $8 billion casino complex plans for 50 acres of parking next to Citi Field in New York. The project\u2019s still in the running for a state gaming license.\nHis home at 901 Oxford Way was purchased back in 2015 from spec developer Gala Asher, making Cohen and his wife Alexandra Cohen the Beverly Hills property\u2019s first and only residents.\nThe $10 million haircut on the ask underscores the challenges some are seeing in L.A.\u2019s high end, where price slashing and re-lists have become common.\n\nOn again, off again\nSpeaking of high-end problems, the market\u2019s recently seen a few re-lists of some pricey pads.\nThat includes billionaire Jeff Greene\u2019s 53,000-square-foot estate at\n9505 Lania Lane\n, which is back on the market for $195 million, or $3,679 per square foot. The last time Greene tried to sell the home was in 2017 for the more value-priced ask of $129 million. After it went off the market, it served as a rental.\nCount the\nWinnick estate\n, also known as Casa Encantada, as another boomerang listing.\nThe Bel-Air home at 10644 Bellagio Road re-entered the market last week for $190 million. That\u2019s down from the $250 million listing price Karen Winnick and her late husband and billionaire financier Gary Winnick originally asked back in 2023. The price was later slashed to $195 million and then, late last year, was cut to $165 million for the 60-room estate.\nNicki Minaj\u2019s debt prob\nA Holmby Hills home owned by\nNicki Minaj\ncould soon be on the market.\nChatter over the proposed sale stems from the rapper and her husband Kenneth Petty\u2019s refusal to pay a reported $503,000 award to security guard Thomas Weidenmuller, according to\nUS Weekly\n.\nWeidenmuller\u2019s now asked a judge to compel the couple to sell their home to not only address what he is owed, but also take care of the mortgage and liens on the property that amount to nearly $14 million.\nThe hip-hop star paid $19.5 million for the 11-bed, 16-bath home at 5510 Jed Smith Road about three years ago.\n",

        "pub_date_dt": "2025-10-19T14:00:00",
        "content": "Cook County Board President\nToni Preckwinkle\nis displaying some familiarity with an old real estate adage: possession is nine-tenths of the law. The county owns a lot of land, and she made a move Thursday that could characterize federal agents as trespassers, should they engage in certain immigration enforcement activity.\nA few hours after Preckwinkle signed an executive order banning\nICE operations\non county property, she again touted the capacity of real estate dealmaking to shape politics, albeit in a much different arena.\nThe takeaway: Preckwinkle understands how to wield real estate as a tool for creating, maintaining and checking power.\nWhether she and other Chicago public officials properly use the tool is up for debate, of course. Take\nDavid Doig\n, who shared the stage with Preckwinkle late Thursday night as they each accepted awards in front of over 200 industry professionals at the annual Marshall Bennett Institute of Real Estate gala in developer Jeff Shapack\u2019s Fulton Market office building at 167 North Green Street.\nPreckwinkle lamented that Chicago housing development had fallen to low levels in recent years, which has sent rents skyrocketing to the fastest rates of growth in the nation.\nBut the optics of the event grow more complex when one scans Doig\u2019s real estate philosophies. The developer-activist behind the firm Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives has real estate credentials anchoring him firmly in the trenches where policy meets capital. And he\u2019s been outspoken about what he views as a broken process for financing affordable housing that has driven up costs at some projects\ncloser to $1 million per unit\n, far more than the price at which the private development market can produce.\n\nDoig\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes stints in former Mayor Richard M. Daley\u2019s city planning department, oversight of park district projects and development leveraging New Markets Tax Credits, showcasing a deep and practical engagement with the real estate sector.\nIn a\nCrain\u2019s Chicago Business\nopinion piece, he argued that the city needs a \u201chomebuilding revolution\u201d to offset decades of underproduction. He frames the issue not simply as a lack of subsidized housing but as systemic supply constraints: red tape, zoning inertia, capital stack complexity and developer risk must be rethought. He observes that building more middle-market units (with minimal public subsidy) may help \u201csoak up\u201d demand and ease pressure.\nLikewise, a\nChicago Tribune editorial\non \u201cHow ill-conceived \u2018affordable\u2019 housing becomes unaffordable\u201d critiqued programs that inadvertently drive up costs through overregulation or misaligned incentives. While not authored by Doig, the piece echoes his criticism of subsidy complexity and questions whether government-backed projects can remain affordable under heavy compliance burdens.\nAt the gala, juxtaposing Preckwinkle and Doig was not random. It showcased dueling yet potentially complementary narratives: Preckwinkle as a political boundary-setter, Doig as a policy implementer. But the contrast also sharpens doubts. If Preckwinkle\u2019s sanctuary county order stakes moral territory, Doig\u2019s work reminds us that real change requires negotiating markets, finance, regulation and on-the-ground execution.\nStill, linking them also raises tension: can a leader publicly decry suppressed housing starts while simultaneously endorsing a symbolic anti-ICE order whose enforcement is uncertain? Doig\u2019s presence offers a foil: development pragmatism facing political idealism.\nThe larger question lingers: will sanctuary-style orders meaningfully reshape immigrants\u2019 lived security \u2014 or will they serve chiefly as rallying flags? And can developers like Doig, pushing for a supply breakthrough, overcome the structural inertia that keeps Chicago undershooting housing demand?\nAt the gala, the award winners themselves told a story of converging aspirations \u2014 but whether Chicago gains homes, equity or protection depends on what happens when the impact of rhetoric fades.",

        "content": "San Francisco home sellers\naren\u2019t riding the discount wave seen in other markets nationwide.\nWhile sellers across the country are slashing list prices to attract interested buyers, only 12 percent of listings in the San Francisco metro area saw price cuts in August. By contrast, the national figure is around 17 percent.\nAt that rate, San Francisco claims the third-lowest share among major U.S. metros, behind New York and Newark, New Jersey. Overall, two-thirds of single-family homes ended up selling above list price in August, marking the highest rate in the Bay Area. Sellers in San Francisco who do slash prices usually only reduce by about 6 percent, or $100,000.\nThe median home price hovered around $1.2 million, or $100,000 below pre-pandemic levels. Typical homes spent a median of 42 days on the market.\nLuxury sales\ntell an even more bullish story.\nSales of homes priced above $5 million jumped 55 percent year-over-year in September, while total home sales rose 35 percent. The jump can likely be attributed to the influx of high-paid tech workers and executives, especially in the booming artificial intelligence sector.\nA\n$42 million off-market deal\nfor a 7,300-square-foot mansion in Pacific Heights, for example, blew past this year\u2019s previous record of $30 million. That home was sold to HOS Pacific, a limited liability company linked to Katie Schwab Paige, daughter of famed financier Charles Schwab. The same LLC owns another Pacific Heights home belonging to Katie Schwab Paige and her husband Matt Paige.\nWith limited supply and deep-pocketed buyers, sellers are sticking to their numbers. Even with flat year-over-year prices, the market\u2019s competitive streak and a record-breaking luxury tier shows that in San Francisco, waiting it out might still pay off.\nNeuralink\u2019s new digs\nNeuralink is in the midst of a brain \u2014 or rather, office \u2014 blast.\nElon Musk\u2019s cybernetic implant startup is\nexpanding in the Bay Area\nwith a 144,000-square-foot office at 499 Forbes Boulevard in South San Francisco. The site, vacant since biotech firm InterVenn Biosciences left in 2023, sits across from Genentech\u2019s $5 billion campus redevelopment.\nThough Musk\u2019 moved Tesla and SpaceX operations to Texas during the pandemic, Neuralink and xAI are bulking up in Silicon Valley. Musk\u2019s xAI firm is hunting for as much as 250,000 square feet of new office space in or near Palo Alto.\nNeuralink, valued above $3 billion, is pushing ahead with human trials of its brain-computer interface designed to help people with paralysis. It has 12 test patients globally and a 10,000-person waitlist for its robotic surgical arm.\n\nSchool\u2019s back in session\nThe Bay Area continues to attract attention from the University of California system as well as out-of-state entities.\nUC Investments\nbought the 331-key Residence Inn Berkeley\nhotel from Pyramid Global Hospitality in an all-cash deal for $175.8 million. It\u2019s a tumble from its 2023 appraised value of $218 million, though it would align with the lodging woes that have led to loan defaults, foreclosures, seizures, bankruptcies and complete closures at hotels across the region in recent years.\nUC\u2019s plans for the property haven\u2019t been disclosed, but it could likely turn into\nstudent housing amid a crunch for academic residences.\nThe move follows UC\u2019s purchase of nearly 100 acres in Belmont in July from Notre Dame de Namur University.\nMeanwhile, Vanderbilt University\u2019s\nplans for a satellite campus in San Francisco\nare coming into focus. The forthcoming 5M Project, a mixed-use development in South of Market, has reportedly\nemerged as a preferred site\nfor the Nashville school to plant its flag in the Bay Area.\nNewly affordable\nBishop Ranch is on its way to getting its first 100 percent affordable housing project.\nThe City of San Ramon\ngave the green light\nfor 200 new units at 2453 Camino Ramon from nonprofit developer Eden Housing. The residences will rise on a 2.2-acre site as part of the push to turn Sunset Development\u2019s office park into a mixed-use community.\nThe effort will replace Sunset Development\u2019s former 10,000-square-foot service center with a 120-unit building for working families and an 80-unit complex for residents 55 and older. Households earning 30 to 80 percent of area median income will be eligible.\nIt\u2019s a notable step as Bishop Ranch continues to grow its planned housing projects to ditch the area\u2019s staid office reputation. Other projects in the works include the conversion of 761,000 square feet of offices to make way for 485 units across two developments, one of which will include affordable housing for very-low-income households; the replacement of a 109,000-square-foot office building with 64 townhome condominiums and nine accessory dwelling units; Related California\u2019s planned 380-unit luxury apartment building;\nAvalonBay\n\u2019s 457-unit project across the street from the City Center retail complex; and Sunset\u2019s transformation of\nthe old Chevron headquarters into The Orchards\n, a development consisting of 2,510 homes, 125,000 square feet of town-center-style retail and a 2.5-acre community park.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Florida\u2019s Supreme Court declined to take up the Biscayne 21 condo buyout case.\nA brief recap to bring you up to speed: In 2022, Taylor Collins and Reid Boren\u2019s Two Roads Development acquired the majority of condos at Biscayne 21, an older Miami condo building in Edgewater. The developer-controlled condo association then voted to amend the condo declaration\u2019s termination statute, lowering the threshold to 80 percent from 100 percent. (A termination of the association is a required legal step so the developer could eventually knock the building down.)\nTwo Roads, which financed the bulk purchase with a $45 million mezz loan from Lionheart Strategic Management LLC and a $105 million senior mortgage from Bank OZK, launched sales later that year of an Edition Residences planned for the site.\nThen, the holdout owners sued the developer and the developer-controlled association. All the residents eventually had to move out, and the building is no longer habitable.\nThe lawsuit has moved its way through the courts, and the Third District Court of Appeal issued an opinion earlier this year siding with the holdout unit owners. The court affirmed that the original condo declaration required unanimous consent for termination, invalidating the developer-controlled association\u2019s amendment.\nLong story short, this was very bad news for the developer, and good news for the holdout owners.\nBut the developer vowed to take the issue to Florida\u2019s Supreme Court. Only, the state\u2019s highest court\ndeclined to hear the issue\n.\nNow, the developer has no other way to appeal, and no leverage with the holdout owners. Two Roads declined to comment on its next steps.\nThe attorneys and other experts I\u2019ve spoken to say that two paths exist: the developer settles with the holdout owners, possibly with a new equity partner who can help recapitalize the project, or the developer-controlled association is forced to repair the building and make it habitable again, operating it as a condo building that is primarily rentals. The latter seems less likely.\nDavid Podein, an attorney at Haber Law who is not involved in the case, said the market may guide the solution.\n\u201cAt the end of the day it is an extremely prime piece of waterfront property,\u201d Podein said.\nMost expect the developer to settle with the holdout owners, but how does Two Roads do that with the debt it owes?\n\nGlen Waldman, the holdout owners\u2019 lawyer, said the lenders will be a key part of how this moves forward. Waldman said the case returns to state court, and he will amend his pleadings to go after the developer for more than $100 million in damages.\nTwo Roads, he said, is \u201cin a terrible position and they deserve it. They\u2019ve destroyed [my clients] homes with no right. Now we go after them like there\u2019s no tomorrow.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nHow will Nahla Capital move the Raleigh Miami Beach project forward now that it\u2019s\ntaken the project over\nfrom Michael Shvo?

The mansion, completed two years ago, spans 14,000 square feet.\nCommercial\n: Miami-based\nCofe Properties\u2019 acquired two warehouses\n, the Milam Dairy Commerce Center I and II at 6700 Northwest 72nd Avenue and 7205 Northwest 68th Street in Medley for $26.8 million. Miami-based Prudence Investments, which had bought the properties in the 1980s and 1990s for a combined $1.9 million, sold the warehouses.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nDeveloper Armando Codina and his wife, Margarita, listed their waterfront estate at 50 Casuarina Concourse in Coral Gables\nfor $45 million\n. Their six-bedroom, eight-and-a-half-bathroom home spans about 13,400 square feet on a 1.1-acre lot. It\u2019s listed with BHHS EWM Realty\u2019s Scott Shuffield. The mansion, built in 1997, features a 2,000-bottle wine cellar, hand-painted dining room, and a large owner\u2019s suite. The couple paid $1.2 million for the property in 1995. The Codinas plan to move to a luxury apartment building Codina Partners is building in Coral Gables.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nMiami-Dade commissioners approved new legislation to make community composting easier and cheaper, according to the\nMiami Herald\n. The legislation could help ease the county\u2019s landfill crisis and curb methane emissions by diverting tens of thousands of tons of organic waste from landfills.\nElsewhere in Florida\nThe Florida House unveiled eight bills aimed at cutting property taxes, primarily benefiting homeowners with homestead exemptions, according to the\nTallahassee Democrat\n. The measures, which would appear on the 2026 ballot, are in response to Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 call for property tax relief.\nDonna Adelson, the matriarch of a South Florida family, was sentenced to life in prison without parole after a jury found her guilty of having her son-in-law, law professor Daniel Markel, assassinated,\nInside Edition\nreports.

        "content": "EY Plaza can\u2019t catch a break, or at least its lenders can\u2019t.\nIt wasn\u2019t enough for a deal to purchase the distressed downtown office tower to\nfall apart\n, no, its value also took a hit. It\u2019s now worth about $135 million, down about 10 percent from its last valuation, according to Morningstar Credit. That\u2019s a significant drop from the $446 million it was once worth.\nIt\u2019s becoming more apparent that Adam Rubin and Andrew Shanfeld\u2019s Carolwood dodged a bullet when its $130 million deal collapsed.\nThe 900,000 square foot, 41-story, Class A office building at 725 S. Figueroa Street was placed in receivership two years ago, after owner Brookfield defaulted on $275 million commercial mortgage-backed securities debt.\nOnce the deal drama played out, after\nThe Real Deal\nreported the story, it was announced that Colliers, who replaced Eastdil, was\nmarketing\nthe $275 million non-performing loan connected to the property. Colliers made it clear that it anticipated the note to trade at discount.\nIt\u2019s not unreasonable to think that news further impacted the marketability of the note. Neither Colliers nor the court-appointed receiver responded to a request for comment.\nMum\u2019s the word\nIf it weren\u2019t for two analysts and their prodding, Rexford Industrial probably wouldn\u2019t have mentioned activist investor Elliott at all during its third quarter\nearnings\ncall. But they asked the question we\u2019ve all wanted an answer to since it was revealed Elliott reportedly built an active stake in the industrial real estate investment trust and had become one of the largest shareholders.\nUnfortunately Rexford was very hush-hush and only said it has met with Elliott and has a constructive dialogue with Paul Singer\u2019s hedge fund (that tends to command attention), as it encourages with all its shareholders, but wouldn\u2019t discuss the nature of said discussions.\nNonetheless, the company reported a net income of $87.1 million for the third quarter, compared to $65.1 million a year earlier, an increase of about 34 percent. Revenues increased too, to $253.2 million in the three months ended Sept. 30 \u2014 and the company executed 3.3 million square feet of leases in the quarter and sold three properties (two in Los Angeles County) for $53.6 million. It was an earnings beat, but it did mark a change, in that Rexford is no longer on a buying spree.\n\nKilroy Realty and Hudson Pacific Properties are next to report earnings, so stay tuned.\nReceiver central\nAnother downtown Los Angeles commercial property owner could cede control to a receiver.\nLender Cathay Bank\nsued\na company connected to Laeroc Partners, borrower and owner of 530 W. 6th Street, alleging it defaulted on a $31 million loan that matured in September. Cathay Bank requested a receiver be appointed to take possession of the 13-story, 160,000-square-foot data-center and office property and for it to be foreclosed upon. It appears the property called the Telecom Center was already on the market, according to a NAI Capital brochure, which does not include an asking price.\nTour, tour, tour\nSenior editor Lauren Schram toured Related California\u2019s new 700 Broadway mixed-use development in Santa Monica that just began leasing, so we\u2019re going to give you a little taste of what we saw.\nOn par with the Southern California lifestyle, the apartment complex has not one but two gyms (and one is an Equinox); a 75-foot rooftop lap pool with a hot tub, cold plunge and two sauna barrels because health and wellness really is everything nowadays and if celebs have a cold plunge so should you; a pet spa outfitted with Andy Warhol-designed black and white French Bulldog wallpaper because who doesn\u2019t love a Frenchie; and a Vons, instead of an Erewhon, Whole Foods or Trader Joe\u2019s.\nThat can all be yours for $3,995 a month, if it\u2019s a studio you want.\nLauren Schram contributed reporting.\n",

        "content": "A dispute over a Lincoln Park property has triggered accusations of wrongdoing between the co-CEO of Chicago\u2019s\nlargest residential brokerage\nand a pair of commercial real estate developers.\n@properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate\nco-CEO Thad Wong\nand\nNorth Park Ventures\nco-founders Robert Sekula and Eric Turrin each filed competing lawsuits accusing the other of breaching contracts over the property at 1628 North Wells Street. Both parties are asking that their joint LLC be dissolved and the building be sold, with the proceeds after paying off the debt being split equally between them, and asking the judge to order the other party to pay their attorneys\u2019 fees.\nBut they\u2019re at odds over the structure, price and broker to use for the deal.\nThe dispute came to a head after a plan to develop a seven-story, 48-unit building with retail fell apart and the owners attempted to sell the property.\nWong has accused Sekula and Turrin of entering into a listing agreement for the property, and rejecting an offer, without his approval. He also accuses them of listing the property for higher than market value to coax other investors to sell their shares to Sekula and Turrin.\nSekula and Turrin, in turn, have accused Wong of demanding that @properties be used to list the building, trying to use an associate to purchase the building and backing out after making an offer to buy them out of the property.\nSekula said he and Turrin are pushing back against many of Wong\u2019s claims; \u201cspecifically, we dispute that we breached the operating agreement for 1628 North Wells LLC or violated any duties owed to Mr. Wong,\u201d he wrote in an email to\nThe Real Deal.\nSekula and Turrin\u2019s attorney, Tim Herman, said they \u201cstand by the allegations made in our complaint.\u201d Wong\u2019s attorney, Aaron Stanton, denied the allegations made by Sekula and Turrin when speaking with\nTRD\n.\nWong, Sekula and Turrin formed an LLC in 2018 to purchase the property that currently includes retail and four residential units for $2.4 million. Wong owned 50 percent through his trust, and Sekula and Turin, along with other investors, owned 50 percent through 1628 North Wells NPV LLC.\nThe partnership\u2019s plan failed after the ward alderman, Brian Hopkins, denied their rezoning request. The income from the existing units is not covering the costs for operation and debt service on the $1.58 million mortgage on the building, and the property generated a net loss of $57,000 in 2024, according to the complaints.\nAs they considered selling the building last year, Turrin and Sekula retained two brokers to assess the property\u2019s value. The brokers gave valuations of $1.6 million and $1.8 million, according to both complaints.\nLast month, Turrin and Sekula worked with a broker at Interra Realty to gauge interest in the property, marketing it internally for $2.1 million. Sekula and Turrin said in their filing they did not enter into a fully executed listing agreement. But Wong\u2019s complaint claims they signed a listing agreement without his approval in breach of their contract.\nWong\u2019s attorney denied that Wong insisted on using his firm to market the property. He said he only requested that @properties be used as the broker. In an email he shared with\nTRD,\nStanton asked the partners\u2019 attorney, \u201cWould they agree to have @properties\u2019 commercial list?\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked if they would be amenable to that,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cThat\u2019s hardly demanding or insisting that they be the broker.\u201d\nWong alleges that Sekula and Turrin set the $2.1 million price, higher than the appraised value, because they didn\u2019t expect to receive offers and wanted to use that as leverage to convince another investor in their LLC to sell the investor\u2019s shares to them, based on a conversation Wong had with Sekula. Wong said they had no intention of selling the property at that price.\nSekula and Turrin\u2019s complaint, though, says they believe they can get more than that asking price, because they received such an offer before the building was publicly listed.\nWong\u2019s complaint said that he feared \u201cserious reputational damage\u201d from the alleged conduct over the listing price, arguing the LLC could face a lawsuit from a brokerage for breaching a listing agreement. It also says that he was not aware Sekula and Turrin had other investors in their stake of the property when he partnered with them.\nDuring the marketing process, Sekula and Turrin received an offer to buy the property for $2.1 million from Teo Scorte, a property manager for one of Wong\u2019s properties, according to Sekula and Turrin\u2019s complaint. They rejected the offer and suggested in the complaint that Scorte was acting as an intermediary for Wong, saying the offer was made \u201cunder the guise of being an independent purchaser.\u201d Stanton said Wong informed Scorte of the property being for sale but denied he was acting as an affiliate of Wong.\nIn September, Wong made an offer through his attorney to buy his partners out of the property and become its sole owner. In an email between their attorneys included in the complaint, Stanton wrote that Wong requested \u201cyour client sell the property for $2.1M or sell its 50 percent membership interest to Mr. Wong at half this price ($1.05M).\u201d\nAnother of Sekula and Turrin\u2019s attorneys, Chad Poznansky, replied saying they would accept the offer \u201cto sell NPV\u2019s 50 percent interest in 1628 North Wells LLC to the Wong Trust in exchange for $1,050,000.\u201d\nBut Stanton said that was a misunderstanding of Wong\u2019s offer. The property was weighed down with a $1.58 million mortgage, so each member\u2019s equity at a $2.1 million valuation would be $260,000. He said in a reply to Poznansky\u2019s email that the offer was meant to reflect that, and the amount Wong would pay for their interest would be about $300,000, not $1.05 million, while Wong would assume sole responsibility for the mortgage debt.\n\u201cThe allegation that Mr. Wong agreed to purchase his partner\u2019s interest for $1.05M is false,\u201d according to Stanton.\nSekula and Turrin said in their complaint that Wong breached the contract by backing out of the offer to pay $1.05 million for their 50 percent stake in the property, and they\u2019re asking the judge to order him to buy them out at that price.\nAlternatively, Wong\u2019s complaint says Sekula and Turrin asked for $640,000 for their stake in the property, which was the amount both parties have invested in the property so far. That would equate to a $2.86 million valuation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been seven years, and the property is losing money because the rents versus the costs don\u2019t match,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cSo we just want to move on.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Vanbarton Group landed a $280 million loan to refinance a Sixth Avenue tower where the developer recently\nconverted several former WeWork office floors\ninto apartments.\nRichard Coles and Gary Tischler\u2019s company secured the loan on the 455-unit building at 980 Sixth Avenue from Invesco, sources told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nVanbarton bought the 25-story building\nfor $316 million in 2018\n. At the time, the tower had 320 apartments sitting on top of three floors of office space, which was then leased to WeWork.\nBut when the co-working company went bankrupt in 2023, the 980 Sixth Avenue location was among some 70 work centers it shuttered. Shortly after, Vanbarton decided to convert WeWork\u2019s three floors into more than 100 apartments.\nWith the conversion now complete, Vanbarton sought out new permanent financing with a five-year term. The new loan replaces a $273 million one from Blackstone\u2019s mortgage trust.\nRepresentatives for Vanbarton Group and Invesco could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nVanbarton is one of the most\nactive office-to-residential converters\nin the city, with a current pipeline exceeding 2,000 units.\nThe developer last month secured a\n$300 million loan\nfrom Brookfield to finance its acquisition and conversion of the former Emigrants Savings Bank building at 6 East 43rd Street. Vanbarton purchased the 400,000-square-foot building for $135 million earlier this year and plans to convert it into 441 rental apartments.\nColes and Tischler also recently purchased the home of the Archdiocese of New York at\n1011 First Avenue\n, which they plan to convert into 420 apartments. Last year, they bought 77 Water Street in the Financial District for\n$95 million\n, which will be transformed into 647 units.\nEarlier this month Vanbarton refinanced Pearl House, the 1970s-era FiDi office building it converted into 477 apartments, with $280 million in debt from AllianceBernstein and Brookfield.\n",

        "content": "Being close to Grand Central Terminal is a perk often proclaimed by pitching office landlords, but it\u2019s not a panacea for the ills facing Manhattan\u2019s market.\nClarion Partners and Alchemy Properties are in danger of foreclosure at 209-211 East 43rd Street, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The 24-story, 211,000-square-foot property is only a block from the major transit hub.\nLast week, a Miami-based plaintiff filed a lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court against a limited liability company with apparent links to a venture between the two owners, alleging default on a $57 million loan.\nIndividuals and the owners aren\u2019t specifically named by the lawsuit, but principals for both companies signed documents for a $65 million loan issued by Signature Bank in 2015. The loan was amended to $57 million in 2022, then ultimately passed along to the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff notified ownership of its default in April, claiming they owed $56.3 million, plus interest, according to the lawsuit.\n\nOwnership says it is is charting a path forward; a spokesperson told the outlet that it remains \u201ccommitted to achieving a positive and timely outcome for all parties involved through the successful recapitalization of the property.\u201d\nAlchemy and ABR Partners, in partnership with Clarion, acquired the leasehold on the Midtown East building in 2015 for\n$99 million\n, two years after Meadow Partners bought it for $61 million. Meadow spent $7 million on improvements and turned over much of the tenant roster during its brief ownership.\nTenants at the building include the missions of Bosnia, Mauritius and Costa Rica, Midtown Dental Services and physiatrist Douglas Schwartz. Japanese restaurant Izakaya Futago occupies the ground floor.\nAsking rent for office space in the building ranges from $35 to $144 per square foot, according to CoStar. There\u2019s roughly 30,000 square feet of space available across seven of the property\u2019s upper floors, according to Avison Young.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The City of Fort Lauderdale approved a major Live Local Act redevelopment of The Quay at 17th Street, a waterfront retail and office plaza.\nThe project is a joint venture with Coconut Grove-based The Related Group, led by Jorge, Jon Paul and Nicholas P\u00e9rez; Aventura-based\nBH Group\n, led by Liat and Isaac Toledano; and Boca Raton-based\nPebb Enterprises\n, led by Ian Weiner. The three firms that have partnered on other recent South Florida projects.\nThe development group won administrative approval for the project under the state law that allows qualifying affordable housing initiatives to bypass standard public hearings.\nThe partnership wants to redevelop the mixed-use complex and six-yacht marina on seven acres at 1515 17th Street into\nThe Quay\n, a 33-story project with 521 apartments along with 5,000 square feet of commercial space and more than 750 parking spaces. The developers plan to set aside 217 units for affordable and workforce housing, plans show.\n\nThe unit mix will range from studios to three-bedroom apartments. The developers also intend to demolish two low-rise office buildings to create a waterfront public plaza, while retaining the existing shopping center on the site.\nThe lot is currently zoned for 361 residential units and up to 12,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space, but under the Live Local Act, the city can approve the greater density without city commission approval since 40 percent of the homes will be affordable.\nLast year, the Related-BH-Pebb partnership paid\n$48.5 million\nfor The Quay property. The same group also owns\nOcean Walk\n, a retail plaza on Singer Island in Riviera Beach, and the former\nOffice Depot\nheadquarters campus in Boca Raton, where it plans a mixed-use project with 500 apartments, a large gym and several outparcels for retail and restaurants.\nThe Quay adds to Related\u2019s growing portfolio of Live Local developments across South Florida. Recently, the firm\u2019s affordable and workforce housing division submitted plans for a multifamily and hotel project at\nJackson Memorial Hospital\u2019s campus\nin Miami. Related is seeking to develop a 27-story tower with 460 apartments, a 31-story tower with 382 units and an 18-story, 128-key hotel. The development would also include 4,200 square feet of retail and 714 parking spaces in a pair of seven-story garages.",

        "content": "Just 35 paying tenants are left in the 130-unit South Shore building raided by federal agents in the middle of the night last month, a massive operation that stirred national controversy over immigration enforcement.\nAfter the raid disturbed the residents and left lingering uneasiness over the South Side neighborhood, a Cook County circuit court judge is now considering ordering them to move out due to its hazardous living conditions.\nPrior to the raid, the building had both paying tenants and squatters, though it\u2019s unclear how many. Federal agents, including from the ATF, the FBI and ICE, arrested 37 people on Sept. 30 for a variety of offenses, though information on the severity of the alleged crimes has been limited so far.\nLocal officials criticized the tactics that federal agents used in the raid, including allegedly temporarily detaining residents who were not later arrested.\nThe building, along with several others in a portfolio held by Wisconsin-based investor Trinity Flood, is the subject of a $27 million foreclosure lawsuit brought by Wells Fargo on behalf of CMBS bond holders.\nMore details about the aftermath of the raid were revealed in a Friday hearing regarding Wells Fargo\u2019s request to appoint a receiver to the building. Property manager Corey Oliver of Strength in Management said at the hearing that some tenants have moved out since the raid and about 35 have stayed put. He estimated that there are about 10 nonpaying squatters still occupying the property, as well.\nConditions at the 7500 South South Shore Drive building had been deteriorating for some time.\nThe foreclosure was filed earlier this year after Flood, the landlord, failed to make debt payments on the South Shore building as well as several others in Chicago and across the U.S.\n\nAt last week\u2019s hearing, Cook County Circuit Court Judge Debra Seaton heard from city inspectors, the ward\u2019s alderman and Oliver, who all relayed varying descriptions of the current state of the building. City inspectors tasked with evaluating electrical systems at the building were particularly alarmed by faulty wiring leading out to the city\u2019s utility poles, noting that lines hang low enough to hit the top of a garbage truck.\nThey also pointed to fire hazards caused by extension cords and hijacked meters in the building, likely used to provide power to squatters\u2019 units. Only one of the building\u2019s elevators is operating. A plumbing inspector noted that the boiler room had a strong odor that could be attributed to a gas leak and stated that raw sewage and sewer gases were leaking into the building at various points.\nBut Oliver said that since the raid Flood had already invested $100,000 into repairs to the building, including plumbing and electrical repairs. He also said he was told he needed to re-submit a permit for some of the electrical work that needed to be done at the property. Another new addition is three armed security guards that now patrol the building from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. every night.\nFlood\u2019s attorney attended the hearing on her behalf which was a choice Seaton criticised.\nSeaton said she will not appoint a receiver until she can evaluate the progress of the work currently ongoing at the property. If the immediate dangers are not resolved quickly, though, she said she will not only consider appointing a receiver but will also weigh issuing a court order for all the remaining tenants to relocate.\nThe order would also likely require some form of relocation assistance be provided to the tenants.\nDuring the hearing, 7th Ward Alderman Greg Mitchell, who represents the area, said he is skeptical that things will turn around in the next few weeks. \u201cMy current concern is that I don\u2019t feel the building is safe,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThe building has been broken into several times and it is a target now.\u201d\nJonah Karsh with the Metropolitan Tenants Organization said that prior to the raid, tenants he heard from did not want to stay in the building. \u201cWe had dozens of tenants requesting relocation,\u201d he said.\nSeaton said she wanted to hear from the current tenants herself before deciding if an order was necessary. She asked that current tenants attend a hearing regarding the receivership next month. She ordered another inspection for Nov. 6 and a hearing for Nov. 7.",

The properties spent 132 days on the market, on average.\nForty-four luxury listings were added to the market, for a total of 1,177 listings.\nThe\nprevious week\n, buyers signed contracts for 16 properties in Miami-Dade, asking a combined $124.3 million.\nThe asking dollar volume for the ten single-family homes and six condos under contract last week totals $159.1 million, according to the report published by the Douglas Elliman team led by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes.\nThe single-family homes that entered into contract last week have an average asking price of $10.2 million and spent an average of 127 days on the market. They total $101.9 million in asking dollar volume.\n\nThe priciest single-family home to secure a buyer is the waterfront home at 6380 North Bay Road in Miami Beach. Richard Lane, chairman emeritus of the New York-based\nOlnick Organization\n, and his wife, Barbara Lane, own the 4,500-square-foot, four-bedroom and four-and-a-half-bathroom house at 6380 North Bay Road. It\u2019s on the market with Jill and Danny Hertzberg of the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker. The Lanes\npaid $9 million\nfor the property in 2020. The house was built in 1951 on a 0.6-acre lot.\nThe second most-expensive house to go under contract last week is the waterfront 9,200-square-foot mansion at 16 Palm Avenue. A trust in the name of Tom Sullivan, founder and CEO of Lawrenceburg, Tennessee-based Lumber Liquidators, owns the 0.8-acre property on Palm Island in Miami Beach. It\u2019s on the market with Venetian International\u2019s Luis Bosch, asking $24.9 million. The six-bedroom, six-and-a-half-bathroom home was built in 1930. It previously sold for $11.5 million in 2008.\nThe condos that secured buyers last week have an average asking price of $9.6 million and spent 141 days on the market, on average. They total $57.5 million in asking dollar volume, or an average of $2,3723 per square foot.\nA double-condo at the Continuum South Beach owned by the late Broadway producer Luigi Caiola and his husband, Sean McGill, found a buyer. Bill Hernandez and Bryan Sereny of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Bill and Bryan Team are listing unit 2608/2609 at 100 South Pointe Drive in Miami Beach for $19.4 million. The 3,700-square-foot unit, with four bedrooms and five and a half bathrooms, also comes with a guest suite and two assigned parking spaces.\nLast week in New York, buyers signed contracts for 30 homes, according to the latest\nOlshan\nreport. Their combined asking price is $246 million, and the typical home spent 688 days on the market.\n",

The floating-rate, interest-only loan refinances existing debt on the 1.1 million-square-foot office tower at 60 Columbus Circle and covers roughly two-thirds of its $1.65 billion appraised value, Bisnow\nreported\n.\nIt will carry a two-year term with three one-year extension options and will be co-originated by German American Capital Corp. and Wells Fargo, which will serve as mortgage loan sellers.\nDeutsche Bank, which relocated its U.S. headquarters to the tower from Wall Street in 2021, occupies 93.5 percent of the building under a 20-year lease with an option to renew for another two decades. The property is fully leased, according to Fitch, reflecting resilience in a midtown market still navigating post-pandemic shifts in office demand.\nThe building \u2014\nformerly\nthe Time Warner Center before the media giant decamped to Hudson Yards \u2014 sits within the 2.8 million-square-foot Deutsche Bank Center complex overlooking Columbus Circle. Related retains a roughly 3 percent stake in the office tower, while Singapore\u2019s GIC and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority each hold 48.1 percent.\n\nRepresentatives for the owners didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe refinancing marks a turnaround from a larger $1.5 billion single-asset CMBS deal the same ownership group shelved in 2022 amid bond-market volatility. With financing conditions still tight and benchmark rates high, the successful closing of this smaller, shorter-term loan would signal improving lender confidence in trophy New York assets with stable tenancy.\nThe loan is slated to close Oct. 29.\nDeutsche Bank Center remains one of Manhattan\u2019s premier mixed-use properties, with its office component joined by luxury retail and the Mandarin Oriental hotel.\n",

        "content": "Bill Cosby found a buyer for his Upper East Side mansion, likely staving off foreclosure.\nThe 88-year-old actor\u2019s home at 18 East 71st Street, asking $29 million, was the priciest property in Manhattan to snag an inked deal last week, according to Olshan Realty\u2019s report. The sprawling limestone mansion topped off a total of 30 homes in the borough asking $4 million or more to enter contract, up from 25 in the\nprevious period\n.\nCosby listed the 13,000-square-foot abode in September in an\nattempt to offload it\nbefore his lender, First Foundation Bank, foreclosed on the property. The bank initiated proceedings roughly nine months ago, claiming Cosby had defaulted on a $17.5 million loan and owed more than $300,000 in property taxes.\nThe disgraced former sitcom star and his wife, Camille, bought the six-story townhouse in 1987 for $6.3 million. The home, known as the Luyster Mansion and built in 1899, has six bedrooms and nine bathrooms. It also features an elevator and 500-square-foot rooftop terrace.\nCorcoran\u2019s Adam Schneider had the listing.\nThe second most expensive property to nab a signed contract was a penthouse at 895 Park Avenue, with an asking price of $21.5 million. The triplex apartment on the 16th, 17th and 18th floors hit the market in March asking just under $30 million.\n\nThe co-op spans 6,900 square feet and has four bedrooms and six bathrooms. It also features a library, staff rooms, three fireplaces and multiple terraces. It last traded for $15 million in 2009 and underwent a two-year renovation the following year.\nBrown Harris Stevens\u2019 John Burger had the listing.\nThe Park Avenue co-op is also home to a\nfamed penthouse\nthat once belonged to composer Leonard Bernstein, who in 1970, along with his wife Felicia, hosted an event for the Black Panther Party which Tom Wolfe wrote about for New York Magazine.\nOf the 30 properties, 19 were condos, seven were co-ops and four were townhouses.\nThe homes\u2019 combined asking price was $246 million, for an average price of $8.2 million and a median of $6.1 million. The typical home spent nearly two years on the market and was discounted 10 percent from the original listing price.\n",

The concept calls for an \u201copen-air destination\u201d that could accommodate events too large for the\nSalt Shed\u2019s\n5,500-person outdoor limit.\nGolden, who co-founded Sterling Bay before launching\nBlue Star\nin 2008, estimates the expansion would cost between $60 million and $70 million including land acquisition, infrastructure and construction.\nThe property is being sold by a Labkon family venture that once operated the General Iron scrap metal plant nearby. Colliers\u2019 Mike Senner is marketing the site.\n\nSignificant challenges remain. The riverfront parcel needs major upgrades \u2014 new seawalls, water and sewer lines \u2014 that could add to the bill. Golden hasn\u2019t ruled out seeking public subsidies such as tax-increment financing but said the project\u2019s feasibility is still being evaluated.\nIf built, the venue could host 30 to 40 shows each summer and offer space for neighborhood street fests or a winter skating rink. The expansion would also cement the North Branch Industrial Corridor\u2019s shift from factories to festivals, part of a broader post-industrial makeover that began after the city eased zoning restrictions along the river in 2017.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a natural addition to what we do,\u201d Golden said.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The development is slated to rise seven stories and include one- and two-bedroom units and a rooftop deck.\nIn San Mateo, diminished office demand and heightened need for housing make projects like these increasingly meaningful in meeting housing element requirements. Approximately 20 percent of office space in San Mateo is considered functionally obsolete, meaning more demolitions could come in the future.\nSan Mateo is on the hook for 7,015 new homes by 2031 under its\nhousing element\n.\nOffice-to-residential redevelopments are becoming common across the Peninsula.\nPresidio Bay Ventures\nacquired\nthe former U.S. Geological Survey campus in Menlo Park earlier this year for $137 million. That property includes 17 office, research and laboratory buildings spanning 412,700 square feet on 17.4 acres.\n\nHarvest Properties bought\nthe 22-acre, 379,600-square-foot Clearview Business Park in San Mateo for $102 million last month. The offices at those sites are expected to be redeveloped into housing, in the largest office redevelopment in the Peninsula proposed this year.\nMeanwhile, apartment construction has fallen off dramatically, with apartment starts in the Bay Area dropping from more than 3,000 in a typical quarter to only a few hundred.\nAcross the country, 542,800 units were under construction at the end of the second quarter, marking the\nlowest level in a decade\n, according to RealPage data cited by the Business Times.\nHigh borrowing costs and pricey labor and materials are forcing developers to slam the brakes for projects already entitled or proposed.\nThere are a few Peninsula cities, however, that could provide multifamily developers some hope. In Daly City, developers started construction on the enclave\u2019s first market-rate apartment project in 15 years, which will\nreplace a former Burlington Coat Factory\nat Westlake Shopping Center with a 214-unit residential complex.\nSouth San Francisco, meanwhile, is seeing an increase in construction activity as compact, mixed-use areas become more attractive to developers and residents.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Rasken\u2019s Colette is a five-story, 38-unit luxury condo slated for 1880 Brickell Avenue, with prices starting at $3.3 million, according to a press release. He\u2019s tapped Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund-Gomes Team to lead sales and marketing for the project.\n\u201cBoutique is what everyone wants now,\u201d said Fredrik Eklund, who heads the team along with John Gomes. \u201cThese huge glass towers can take many, many, many years to build and sometimes to sell out. There\u2019s a little more risk as a buyer.\u201d\n\nFloor plans in Colette will span between two- and four-bedrooms. The building will also have two penthouses. Colette\u2019s amenities will include a rooftop pool, wellness facilities, a screening room, children\u2019s playroom, and a meeting room. The design team includes Brazilian architecture group OSPA.\n\u201cWe believe that the next chapter in South Florida is not just height and glass,\u201d Rasken said.\nHe anticipates the buyer demographic for this project will include locals, particularly younger buyers who have been renting in Brickell and are considering a move to Coconut Grove. Rasken and Eklund also expect buyers from the Northeast. They foresee Colette\u2019s buyers making the building their primary home.\nRasken went into contract for the 0.8 acre Colette site for\n$10.7 million\nlast year. His other projects include Opus, a 14-unit boutique condominium project in Coconut Grove. He landed a\n$28 million construction loan\nfor the building from Arixa Capital in August.",

The listing breaks down to $1,643 per square foot of interior space.\nThe eight-bedroom apartment spans the entire 51st and 52nd floors of Museum Tower.

The company is currently seeking entitlements for the project.\nHollywood studio developers and executives are similarly considering adaptive reuse alternatives for film studios that have begun to collect cobwebs as productions flee L.A. for other states and countries.\nAmazon, for example, transformed buildings in downtown Culver City into its Culver Studios facility, while developer\nEast End Studios is building its Mission Campus\npartially at a former cold-storage facility.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Patty McHugh and David Duncan came up with some cash to hold onto a big Hilton-branded hotel complex connected to Chicago\u2019s McCormick Place convention center.\nMcHugh Enterprises, the development arm of Chicago mega-contractor\nMcHugh Construction\n, and Duncan\u2019s firm\nFirst Investors\nrefinanced their Hilton-branded South Loop lodging asset with a $92 million floating-rate, interest-only loan from Access Point Financial.\nThe deal comes out to roughly $20 million shy of the mortgage the landlords secured six years ago, before the pandemic reset the deck for hospitality in Chicago and across the globe.\nIt\u2019s unclear what kind of financial mechanism \u2014 an out-of-pocket paydown or a preferred equity arrangement with an outside party \u2014 allowed McHugh and First Investors to close the debt gap; Walker &amp; Dunlop, which arranged the debt deal, said there wasn\u2019t any subordinate capital involved, pointing toward the borrowers paying down the difference.\nEither way, the smaller first mortgage reflects today\u2019s tighter lending climate and the\nrecalibration of hotel valuations\nsince 2019. Lender\nACORE Financial\u2019s recent $187 million foreclosure lawsuit\nagainst longtime Chicago hotelier Su-Mei Yen for a separate South Loop hotel complex and the\nsame lender\u2019s seizure of a River North hotel\nhave jolted the city\u2019s hospitality industry.\nThe loan was for the Hiltons at McCormick Place at 123 East Cermak Road, the 466-key tri-branded property connected to the city\u2019s convention center, Walker &amp; Dunlop said in a release.\nMcHugh and First Investors developed the 23-story hotel tower in 2018 with a $78 million mortgage from Wells Fargo,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported, when the property was hailed as the country\u2019s first triple-branded Hilton.\n\nThey refinanced in 2019 with the $112 million mortgage from CrossHarbor, meaning they could have pocketed some of the difference with a cash-out deal.\nThe deal with Access Point underscores how refinancing math has shifted for even strong-performing hospitality assets. What once penciled out at nine figures now looks more modest, as rising interest costs and lender caution reshape the post-pandemic playbook for hotel owners.\nPatty McHugh, chair of McHugh Enterprises, stated that the property \u201ccontinues to thrive,\u201d crediting Walker &amp; Dunlop for navigating the process amid volatile capital markets. The company\u2019s construction arm also built the hotel, which combines Hilton Garden Inn, Hampton Inn and Home2 Suites brands under one roof.\nA McHugh spokesperson didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment regarding how the debt gap was closed from the CrossHarbor deal.\nThe fresh capital gives the ownership group breathing room in a higher-rate market that\u2019s throttled hospitality deals citywide.\nEven as Chicago\u2019s convention business rebounds, hotel trades have been scarce, and refinancing packages increasingly reflect smaller principal balances as values lag behind pre-pandemic highs.\nWalker &amp; Dunlop\u2019s Aaron Appel and Dustin Stolly led the capital markets team for the Hiltons at McCormick deal, while the firm\u2019s Jay Morrow and Carter Gradwell advised the borrowers. The firm touted the asset\u2019s strong performance \u2014 120 percent of submarket revenue per available room \u2014 and its positioning next to the 2.6-million-square-foot McCormick Place Convention Center, which draws about 3 million visitors annually.\n",

The asking price equates to $1,400 per square foot.\nBuilt in 2015, the home blends\nPrairie School\ninfluences with a contemporary twist \u2014 a stone-and-stucco exterior gives way to airy interiors with glass-front kitchen cabinets, a minimalist fireplace wall and sweeping lake views framed by floor-to-ceiling windows.\nOutdoor amenities include a cabana tucked midway down the dune and a path leading to the beach.\nLiz Roch of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate has the listing. The Daniels\u2019 could not be reached for comment, and Roch did not respond to inquiries from Crain\u2019s.

        "content": "When Florida lawmakers first approved the Live Local Act in 2023 in an effort to alleviate the affordable housing crisis, developers rushed to seize on its incentives and filed a slew of project applications.\nSince then, they\u2019ve completed nearly 3,200 below-market rental units in 23 projects across the state, according to a Florida TaxWatch, a nonpartisan and nonprofit research institute.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just how long real estate takes,\u201d said attorney Anthony De Yurre, referring to the drawn out project approval and construction process.\nThe law incentivizes developers by allowing them to build bigger projects \u2013 up to the highest density permitted in a jurisdiction and the tallest height permitted within a mile \u2013 as long as they designate at least 40 percent of their apartments for households earning up to 120 percent of the area median income. The apartments have to remain at below-market rents for at least 30 years.\nLive Local\u2019s other perks are that developers can bypass public hearings and only go through administrative approvals and tiered property tax exemptions: a 75 percent exemption for apartments for households earning between 80 percent and 120 percent of the AMI, and a 100 percent exemption for apartments for earners of less than 80 percent of the AMI.\nThe law was tweaked in the past two years, including to loosen floor area ratio and parking requirements. Those who jumped on projects right after the legislation was first passed have been working through site plan approval and construction drawing permitting, De Yurre said.\n\u201cI can tell you from my projects, now is when we are heavily engaged in discussions with lenders for early adopters of the law,\u201d De Yurre said.\nBut developers still are betting big on Live Local. A total of 143 projects with 43,400 units, combined, are in various stages from proposed to approved under the state law, research from the nonprofit Florida Housing Coalition shows.\nNearly half of the planned units are in Miami-Dade County, while 11.2 percent are in Broward County and 6.3 percent are in Palm Beach County, the Florida Housing Coalition data shows.\nQuestions still loom over Live Local. For one, lenders are only now getting introduced to Live Local projects and analyzing their financials. And although developers continue to rush to file project proposals, questions remain whether Live Local will help alleviate the affordable housing crisis.\nAcross Florida, there were 25 affordable apartments available and attainable for every 100 extremely low income households, or those earning up to 30 percent of the AMI, last year, according to the Florida TaxWatch report.\nAI woes\n\nAs South Florida developers feel the sting from higher construction costs and insurance premiums, as well as elevated interest rates, confusion and widespread misinformation about the law also is delaying projects.\nUnder Live Local, Florida counties that have a sufficient supply of below-market rentals that exceeds the demand from earners of less than 120 percent of the AMI can opt out of the property tax exemption. None of South Florida\u2019s three counties, where the affordable housing crisis is most heightened, qualify for this, the Florida TaxWatch report shows.\n\u201cChatGPT and AI has a very bizarre way of rearing its head in the legal world and usually creates a lot of misinformation,\u201d said De Yurre, a Miami-based land use and zoning attorney who helped draft the act and represents developers pursuing Live Local projects.\u00a0 \u201cIt is creating a lot of misinformation with lenders in regards to the statute and property tax exemption.\u201d\nGenerally, private equity is \u201calways going to be more entrepreneurial\u201d and open to Live Local compared with banks, which usually prefer to lend on programs once they become widespread, De Yurre said.\nSouth Florida\u2019s most advanced Live Local projects include Cymbal DLT Companies\u2019 completed\n341-unit Laguna Gardens\ncomplex in Miami Gardens. Completed last year, it was originally planned as market-rate rentals and Cymbal DLT retroactively converted it to Live Local, allowing the firm to use the law\u2019s tax breaks.\nAlso, near North Miami, developer Daniel Abreu scored\n$16.5 million\nlast year to build an 80-unit building, marking one of the first known construction loans for a Live Local project.\n\u201cMissing middle\u201d v. extremely low income\nThe need for below-market rentals in South Florida is high.\nIn Miami-Dade and Monroe counties, there\u2019s a deficit of 143,805 units for households earning less than 80 percent of the AMI, according to the Florida TaxWatch report, which cited a 2024 University of Florida study for the data. The deficit is 85,345 units in Broward County, and 37,699 units in Palm Beach County.\nMany Live Local developers are marketing their South Florida projects\u2019 below-market rate apartments for households earning up to 120 percent of the AMI, but few are dropping rents for the extremely low-income who earn 30 percent of the AMI.\nBut De Yurre argues it\u2019s earners of 80 percent to 120 percent of the AMI, the so-called \u201cmissing middle,\u201d whom Live Local is intended to help. Projects with lower rents generally would have to be subsidized by low-income housing tax credits and other public financing programs.\n\u201cPeople say this [Live Local] isn\u2019t truly affordable. But if you do less than 80 percent [of the AMI], the teacher can\u2019t qualify,\u201d he said, arguing that the workforce such as educators, firefighters and police make too much to qualify for a unit targeting earners below 80 percent of the AMI. \u201cThis is the only program that helps out in that regard. This is the only program that helps out in that regard.\u201d",

The home, which is currently listed for $23.8 million, or $2,633 per square foot, fell into contract last week to become the top pending deal for the period, based on its asking price. That\u2019s according to Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team\u2019s\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n, which is compiled by Marcy Roth.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019\nDrew Fenton\nand Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s\nAaron Kirman\nhold the listing.\nAnthony purchased the property in 2010 for $3.5 million, when it still had the original house built in the 1940s. That was ultimately torn down for a new build in 2018,\u00a0 a project that was completed in 2022, according to a\nWall Street Journal\ninterview with Anthony and his wife, Betim Anthony, at the time of the property\u2019s listing.\nThe new home, which sits on over half an acre, has seven bedrooms and 10 baths across over 9,000 square feet. Dubbed the \u201cBentley House,\u201d the home is shrouded in privacy behind gates and hedges. Inside, there\u2019s a screening room, wine cellar, office and gym.\nLast year is when the couple decided to hang up the for-sale sign, listing the home for nearly $27 million, or $2,986 per square foot.\nSitting in the No. 2 spot among last week\u2019s signed contracts within Los Angeles County is 14952 Alva Drive in Pacific Palisades.\nThe property is listed for $13.9 million, or $2,037 per square foot, and is located in the Palisades\u2019 Huntington neighborhood.\n\nThe six-bed, nine-bath home spans 6,800 square feet. The gated property sits on about a third of an acre, with highlights that include a media room, pool house, pool, cold plunge, outdoor shower and spa.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019 Nichole Shanfeld has the listing.\nThe seller is a trust tied to Jeffrey Mark Hancock and Susan Gregg Renfrew, according to property records.\nOverall, the number of contracts signed in L.A. County last week was flat at 16 compared to a year ago, according to the\nEklund Gomes report\n. Meanwhile, last week\u2019s asking volume fell about 7 percent from a year earlier to $129.1 million.\nRoth called out the activity as another example of Los Angeles\u2019 \u201croller coaster\u201d real estate market, after three straight weeks notching year-over-year increases in volume.\n\u201cWe suspect this is a blip in the market as, anecdotally, we are starting to see properties that have previously sat, go under contract,\u201d she said.\nRoth tempered the point, however, adding that \u201cit is possible the holiday slowdown has begun.\u201d\n",

Builder and pricing details are still under wraps.\nJohnson Development has made refinements to the original plan, expanding the community\u2019s open-space and recreation features, CEO Michael Smith said.\nRoughly 1,200 acres \u2014 nearly 40 percent of the property \u2014 will be preserved as green space, with 26 miles of trails winding through heavily wooded stretches along Hickory Creek. The community will also feature two lakes, a pair of amenity centers, a 50-acre city park and a 55-acre business park.\nOn the civic side, about 206 acres will be reserved for two elementary schools, a middle school and a high school within the Denton ISD. Another 156 acres are earmarked for commercial use.\n\nThe site is just south of Hillwood\u2019s 3,200-acre\nLandmark\nproject.\nDenton Range, managed by Silvestri Investments, is an investor in the project. Johnson Development is already active in North Texas with its\nViridian\ncommunity in Arlington and\nTrinity Falls\nin McKinney.\nPlans for Cole Ranch stretch back to the mid-2010s, when the city first held public hearings on the massive residential proposal.\nThe Texas Legislature approved a municipal management district for the site in 2019. Earlier this year, Denton City Council tweaked the zoning for more than 300 acres from light industrial land in favor of residential and mixed-use development, signaling the city\u2019s shift toward a more community-oriented buildout.\nThe property has deep local roots. The Cole family has owned the land since the 1930s, when Miner Thomas \u201cM.T.\u201d Cole ran it as a working ranch. His great-granddaughter Jennifer Alexander said the family sought a partner that would honor the history and the beauty of the area.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The Dallas Regional Chamber picked a familiar North Texas figure to steer its next chapter of growth.\nBrad Cheves, a senior executive at Southern Methodist University, will take over as president and CEO of the influential business organization in January. Cheves succeeds Dale Petroskey, who led the DRC for nearly 12 years before stepping down this summer for family reasons, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nHis appointment caps a months-long search led by Russell Reynolds Associates and a nine-member selection committee of past, current and future board chairs.\nDarcy Anderson\n, vice chair of\nRoss Perot Jr.\u2019s\nHillwood Development, was the only representative of the commercial real estate sector on the selection committee and is slated to serve as the chamber\u2019s board chair next year.\nThe chamber will introduce Cheves at its annual meeting on Jan. 27 at the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center.\nCheves, 63, has spent the past two decades as SMU\u2019s senior vice president for development and external affairs, where he oversaw fundraising, marketing and community engagement. He led the school\u2019s $1.65 billion \u201cSMU Ignited: Boldly Shaping Tomorrow\u201d campaign, which reached its goal three years ahead of schedule.\n\n\u201cI love\nSMU\n, and there\u2019s never a good time to leave a place you love, but if there is a time, it\u2019s now,\u201d Cheves told the outlet. He said his focus at the chamber will center on education and workforce development, areas he believes are critical to sustaining Dallas\u2019 economic momentum.\nPetroskey called Cheves \u201ca proven and highly respected leader,\u201d adding that he\u2019s stepping into \u201cthe best job in America\u201d at what he described as a \u201csweet moment in time for the Dallas region.\u201d Under Petroskey\u2019s leadership, the number of Fortune 500 firms in DFW grew by a third, while more than 70 Fortune 1000 companies joined the DRC\u2019s ranks.\nCheves\u2019 civic resume runs deep. He sits on the boards of Broadway Dallas, the Circle Ten Council of Scouting America, the Texas Lyceum and the Dallas Council on Foreign Relations. His connections across business, academia and philanthropy are expected to help the DRC continue shaping Dallas\u2019 ascent as a global corporate hub.\nFormer\nDallas Mavericks\nCEO Cynt Marshall, a past DRC chair, called Cheves the \u201cright leader for a new era,\u201d while Cowboys owner\nJerry Jones\npraised his \u201cremarkable record of success.\u201d\nCheves said he\u2019s bullish on Dallas\u2019 resilience and future.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Los Angeles is firmly in the trend of homebuyers walking away from deals at record levels as costs, inspection woes and financing hurdles chip away at the market.\nAcross the country, about 56,000 home-purchase agreements, or 15.1 percent of all contracts signed, were canceled in August, the highest share for that month since Redfin began tracking the data in 2017, L.A. Business First\nreported\n, citing Redfin data. The rate was up from 14.3 percent a year earlier.\nIn Los Angeles, 14.9 percent of sales fell in August this year, down a small tick from 15 percent in August of last year, a\ncontinuation of a trend\nthat goes back to spring.\nThe Los Angeles area isn\u2019t the only market in California seeing home sales collapse. Cancellations in San Jose climbed to 6.9 percent year-over-year from 1.6 percent, marking the largest year-over-year increase in all metro areas tracked by Redfin. In San Francisco, the\ncancellation rate\nrose to 5.9 percent, a 2.3 percent year-over-year increase from 3.6 percent. Notably,\nrents in San Francisco\nhave now\nsurpassed pre-pandemic levels\n.\nThe market is soft on prices, too. Nationally, one in six sellers, or about 16.7 percent, dropped their asking price in August, the steepest share since 2012. Homes sold for an average of 3.8 percent below asking price across the country. As is the case nationwide, the housing market in Los Angeles has been plagued by affordability issues, increasing insurance premiums and overall economic uncertainty.\n\nWith an oversupply of about half a million more sellers than buyers last month, buyers have been using the upper hand to negotiate for repairs and discounts. One agent in Tampa, for example, told Business First they worked with a seller who received 78 repair requests in a failed deal after multiple price cuts.\nInspection or repair issues drove more than 70 percent of broken contracts, though failed financing, slow sales of buyers\u2019 own homes, and shaky economic confidence also played key roles. About 62 percent of agents similarly reported more deals falling apart than a year ago, per Homelight data cited by Business First.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Film director\nTanya Wexler\nparted with a townhouse at\n83 Jane Street\nfor $14.6 million. The buyer was an LLC named after the property\u2019s address. Wexler, who purchased the residence in 1999, put the five-story property on the market in May 2024 for $17.5 million. The townhouse has an elevator, roof deck, 2,000 square feet of outdoor space and five bedrooms. Compass\u2019\nStephen Ferrara\nand\nClayton Orrigo\nhad the listing.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nAn LLC tied to\nAcadia Realty Trust\noffloaded a retail and office condo at\n1035 Third Avenue\n, between 61st and 62nd Streets in Lenox Hill, for $22 million. The buyer was an LLC linked to\nAlbert Rabizadeh\nof\nGlobal Asset Management LLC.\nThe 30-story-tall building is mixed-use, with 113 apartments in addition to commercial space. In 2015, Acada paid $29 million for the two units and another $22 million for a parking garage there. The first-floor retail unit measures about 7,800 square feet, and the office space covers about 12,800 square feet across floors one and two.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Stephen Orlins\n, president of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, and\nJiaying Jiang\ndropped $7.9 million on a sponsor unit at\n15 Hudson Yards\n, which was developed by\nRelated Companies and Oxford Properties Group\n. The unit, when it first hit the market almost a decade ago, had an initial asking price of $11.9 million, but its most recent asking price was just under $8.5 million. The four-bedroom pad spans just over 3,000 square feet, pricing the deal at about $2,600 per square foot. Corcoran\u2019s\nHottinger Team\nand\nArsic Lau Team\nhad the listing.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nIn the West Village, about a block from the Whitney Museum of American Art, a townhouse at\n80 Horatio Street\n, which at one point appeared to be an apartment building, changed hands for $10.3 million. The seller was\n80 Horatio St. Corp\n., whose president and CEO is\nPatrick Monahan\n; the company had owned the property since at least the late 1970s. The buyer was an LLC tied to\nMaurice Regan,\nfounder and CEO of construction firm J.T. Magen &amp; Company. Brown Harris Stevens\u2019\nAmy Herman\nand\nKyle Cooper\nhad the listing.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nAlso in the West Village, journalist\nDavid Muir\nshed his townhouse at\n256 West 4th Street\nfor $6.9 million. The buyer was\n256 W 4th LLC.\nMuir purchased the home via an LLC in 2013 for $4.2 million. The four-story residence dates to 1877 and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms. The property went on the market in April for $7.5 million. Compass\u2019\nHenry Hershkowitz, Britt Blaxton, Christine Rocchio, Anthony Lucia\nand\nJonathan Meiselman\nhad the listing.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nAn LLC linked to\nJeremy Lo Yi Yun\nscooped up a sponsor unit at The Centrale at\n138 East 50th Street\nin Turtle Bay for $6.4 million. The three-bedroom unit spans about 2,800 square feet. The transaction pencils out to roughly $2,300 per square foot. The unit went on sale in June 2024, with an initial listing price of $7.9 million. Douglas Elliman\u2019s\nBertrand Buchin, Joan Swift, Glenn Davis\nand\nConnor Cuccinelli\nhad the listing. The developer of the property is\nCeruzzi Properties\nand\nSMI USA.\nBy the Numbers:\nCiattarelli receives lion\u2019s share of real estate\u2019s donations in NJ gov race\nWith less than three weeks to go to the New Jersey gubernatorial election, the real estate industry has a resounding favorite: Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli.\nThe industry poured about $1.3 million into the candidate\u2019s coffers through individual contributions, or more than double what it gave to Democratic nominee Mikie Sherrill, whose total came in at a comparatively paltry $567,000.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "The ad warns: \u201cYour neighborhood essentials are at stake.\u201d\nThe mailer, paid for by the City Council, states that three of the questions that will appear on the November ballot will take away communities\u2019 power to \u201cdemand the city and developers invest\u201d in neighborhoods \u201cwhen allowed to build.\u201d\nCity Council leadership has painted most of the housing ballot questions as a power grab by the administration, arguing that the measures threaten to deprive City Council members the leverage they need during zoning negotiations to guarantee deeper affordability, as well as investments in their communities.\nThe City Council has declined to reveal how much it has spent or plans to spend on its campaign against the measures. The Council\u2019s budget for postage and printing supplies was increased by roughly $2.3 million earlier this year, though that was before the mayor\u2019s Charter Revision Commission even released its preliminary\nreport\noutlining potential changes to the city\u2019s land use review process.\nMeanwhile, a coalition supporting the measures, Yes on Affordable Housing, has committed to spending $3 million to promote the housing proposals.\nThe questions at issue, if approved, would:\n\u2014\nCreate two different \u201cfast track\u201d options for affordable housing projects.\nHousing Development Fund Companies building publicly-funded, 100 percent affordable housing could receive approvals for zoning changes through the city\u2019s Board of Standards and Appeals rather than going through the full Uniform Land Use Review Procedure.\nThe other track would apply to affordable housing projects proposed in the 12 community districts that have approved the least amount of affordable housing. Starting in October 2026, the city would release a report identifying what districts have permitted the least amount of affordable housing in the previous five years. Such projects will go through a condensed Ulurp: Community Boards will have the same amount of time to review these proposals (60 days), but the applicable borough president will review the proposal at the same time, rather than for 30 days after the community board\u2019s review. The City Planning Commission, which will then have 30 days to review instead of 60, will have the final vote on these proposals, rather than the City Council.\n\u2014\nCreate a new land use review process for \u201cmodest\u201d housing and infrastructure projects.\nThis new review process, dubbed Expedited Land Use Review Procedure or Elurp, would apply to housing projects in medium- or high-density districts that increase residential capacity by no more than 30 percent or to housing projects in low-density districts that are no taller than 45 feet and have a maximum floor area ratio of two. Proposals to put solar panels on public buildings or other land would also qualify. The City Council could also approve additional project categories, though I wouldn\u2019t bank on that.\nElurp would follow the same timeline outlined in the previous question, but depending on the project type, either the City Planning Commission or the City Council\u2019s review is skipped. (Some projects require review by the City Council under state law.)\n\u2014\nReplace the mayoral veto with an appeals board\n. As it stands, Ulurp ends with the mayor, who usually goes along with whatever action the City Council takes (with a\nfew exceptions\n). This proposal would replace the mayor\u2019s power to veto land use decisions with a three-person appeals board, consisting of the mayor, City Council speaker and the applicable borough president. The appeals board could reverse City Council\u2019s rejection of projects that would create affordable housing. Such projects can only affect one borough. The appeals board can also restore such project proposals to the version approved by the City Planning Commission, undoing modifications approved by the City Council.\nAs City Council leaders wage a public campaign against the ballot measures, which has drawn\nallegations of electioneering\nthat the Council have denied, Conservatives in the Council are trying to challenge the measures in court. Last week, a state Supreme Court judge\nthrew out\na lawsuit brought by the Council\u2019s Common Sense Caucus seeking to annul the ballot measures. The group, along with other plaintiffs, have appealed the decision.\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: If the ballot measures are not approved, what will this mean for the next administration\u2019s housing goals? What steps would the next mayor need to take, absent these changes? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The late Diane Keaton was an avid house flipper, having rented, bought, renovated or designed nearly 50 homes,\naccording to the New York Times\n.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 City Council member Keith Powers plans to run for Assembly member Harvey Epstein\u2019s seat,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. Epstein, who represents the East Side of Manhattan, is expected to be elected to the City Council, taking over Carlina Rivera\u2019s former seat.\n\u2014 Gov. Kathy Hochul is considering whether to sign or veto a measure that would permit physician-assisted death for patients with an incurable diagnosis and less than six months to live,\nGothamist reports\n. If she signs the bill, New York would become the 12th state to authorize physician-assisted death.\n\u2014 Billionaire John Catsimatidis thinks Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa should drop out of the mayoral race,\nthe New York Post reports\n. \u201cCurtis would make the best mayor of all the candidates \u2026 but Curtis has to realize that he should love New York more than anything else,\u201d Catsimatidis said on WABC radio Monday. \u201cIt certainly looks like Curtis should pull out right now.\u201d\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$14.6 million\nfor 83 Jane Street. The West Village townhouse is 6,000 square feet.\nCompass\u2019\nThe Hudson Advisory Team has the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$22 million\nfor a commercial condo unit at 1035 Third Avenue. The Upper East Side building has over 245,000 square feet of floor area and is a mixed-use building.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $14.2 million for a penthouse unit at 240 Park Avenue South. The Flatiron condo is 3,900 square feet.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s\nMichael Graves has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 65,392-square-foot, nine-story, mixed-use building at 2054 Walton Avenue in the Bronx. Nikolai Katz is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "A stalled hotel project in Culver City is moving forward after years of inactivity on the planning front.\nThe Culver City Planning Commission is slated to review revised plans from Irvine-based development firm Greens Group for a mixed-use building at 11469 Jefferson Boulevard, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n.\nCulver City officials\ngave the greenlight\nin 2021 to Sandstone Properties\u2019 plans to redevelop a shopping center into a hotel named \u201cThe Jeff.\u201d That proposal called for the construction of a five-story building with 175 guest rooms above ground-floor restaurant space and a two-level subterranean parking garage with capacity for 138 cars.\nThe Greens Group plan keeps the hotel, albeit in a smaller footprint, and eliminates plans for a rooftop and meeting space in the building. The hotel would have 147 rooms and still feature a restaurant, coffee shop, fitness center and parking for 106 vehicles. The building would take the form of a low-rise structure with a central courtyard. It\u2019s expected to take a year and a half to complete.\nSandstone purchased the development site in 2014 for $4.6 million. News of the company\u2019s plans to build a hotel first surfaced in 2019.\n\nOther mixed-use developments are in the works in Culver City.\nThis summer, Dallas-based Lincoln Property Company\ntweaked its plans\nfor nearly 67,000 square feet of offices at 11111 Jefferson Boulevard, opting to build more housing rather than offices as office vacancy in the third quarter ticked up to 23.9 percent,\nper\nCushman &amp; Wakefield.\nElsewhere in Culver City, Los Angeles-based Hudson Pacific Properties is\nlooking to redevelop\na 169,000-square-foot office campus formerly occupied by the NFL\u2019s media offshoot into a mixed-use development with housing and commercial uses. Hudson Pacific\u2019s plans would turn the 6-acre property at 10950 Washington Boulevard into two five-story buildings turned into 508 apartments and\u00a0 14,000 square feet of ground-floor commercial space.\nIrvine-based Greens previously added a hotel near Los Angeles International Airport to its portfolio,\nsnapping up the Wingate by Wyndham property\nnear the airport in 2023 for $23.7 million. The 148-key property at 10300 La Cienaga Boulevard was bought in 1999 for $5.3 million by George and Linda Oh, with trustee Sandra Oh selling the lodging. The hotel has since closed and is no longer in operation.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The multifamily market in the western Chicago suburb of Aurora has been busy this month, with two sales fetching a combined $181 million and 788 units moving to big landlords.\nA joint venture of Chicago-based\nVistria Group\nand Los Angeles-based\nStandard Real Estate Investments\nbought the 420-unit Fox Valley Villages Apartments for $93 million. The deal came out to about $221,000 per unit for the property at 710 South Eola Road.\nSeparately, DRA Advisors this month bought the 368-unit Aurora at Summerfield Apartments for $88 million. The sale of the complex located at 1847 Clubhouse Drive came out to about $239,000 per unit. The seller to DRA was\nNew York-based Cantor Fitzgerald\n, which was formerly helmed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick until he joined the second Trump administration. Cantor had owned the property since 2019, when the firm bought it for $77 million with a $50 million loan from Berkeley Point Capital.\nTogether, the deals keep the swift momentum of Chicago region\u2019s multifamily market rolling as recent new development deliveries suppress rent growth in Sun Belt markets while the relative\nlack of new supply in the Midwest\nhas benefited owners of existing properties.\nThe suburban submarket benefits from Chicago\u2019s strong job base without the\nhassles of Cook County\u2019s complicated property tax system\n. The Chicago suburbs have consistently risen the ranks of the county\u2019s most competitive rental markets, alongside cities like Miami, according to data compiled by companies like RentCafe.\nDRA Advisors, which is based in New York, has previously made headlines for\nselling off most of its $540 million Midwest retail portfolio\nthat was concentrated in the Chicago area. Now, the firm now appears ready to grow its multifamily holdings in the region.\n\nWith the purchase of the Fox Valley Villages, Standard and Vistria now jointly own 836 units in the Aurora/Naperville submarket. Last year, they bought the 416-unit Haven on Long Grove apartments and townhomes in Aurora for $94 million, including a $46 million Fannie Mae loan assumption.\n\u201cThe Aurora/Naperville submarket is among the strongest in the Chicago MSA with a high barrier to entry,\u201d Jerome Nichols, president and co-founder of Standard, said in a statement.\nThe prior owner of Standard\u2019s latest acquisition, Utah-based\nBridge Investment Group\nwhich was absorbed by Apollo Global Management earlier this year, purchased the property for $72 million with a $54 million mortgage from Wells Fargo in 2021.\nThe sprawling complex is made up of 18, three-story buildings across 21 acres. It includes 208 one-bedroom units and 212 two-bedroom units with an overall occupancy rate of 97 percent. Standard and Vistria plan to invest over $8 million on renovations, they said in a statement.\nDRA, Bridge and Cantor didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\n",

        "content": "An Oak Brook mansion has sold for $5.3 million, the highest price achieved for a home sale in the western suburb of Chicago in 16 years.\nThe one-acre property at 412 Fox Trail Court sits on a cul-de-sac in the gated Hunter Trails community, near a forest preserve and golf courses. The contemporary-style house has five bedrooms and seven-and-a-half bathrooms, and 10,000 square feet of living space, with a pool in the back, according to real estate listings.\nSales above $5 million are rare in the western suburbs, and demand has been mixed, with some properties selling relatively quickly and some sitting on the market for months or more. Michael Lafido with LPT Realty, who represented the seller on the Fox Trail Court house, said there was huge demand for the listing, which sold for $105,000 over asking.\n\u201cWe had multiple offers and we had 14 showings in two weeks, and even when we were under contract, we had a handful of agents begging to get in there to see it,\u201d LaFido said. \u201cYou don\u2019t typically see that kind of activity at $2 million, let alone $5 million and up.\u201d\nThe previous owner bought the\nhouse in 2023 for $4.75 million\n. It was listed for $5.2 million in August and went under contract less than a month later. Peggy Sersen with Redfin represented the buyer.\n\nLafido and Sersen declined to share details about the seller and buyer. The home was previously held under a trust, and property tax bills were addressed to Nikola Kozul. Records that would indicate the buyer aren\u2019t yet available.\nThe previous owner paid $38,600 in property taxes this year, property records show.\nThe $5.3 million sale price marks the highest Oak Brook home sale since 2009, when a nearby mansion on Adams Road sold for $5.45 million. The village\u2019s record was set in 2003, when\nChicago White Sox Hall of Famer Frank Thomas\nsold his 27,000 square-foot mansion for $7.95 million. The house has traded a few times since then, most recently for $4.5 million in 2021.\nOnly a few other Oak Brook homes have sold for more than $4 million since 2020, according to public listing services. An 11,000 square-foot mansion on Oak Court brought in $4 million in December, and a 12,000 square-foot property on Breakenridge Farm Road brought in $4.8 million in 2023.\nOak Brook luxury listings are slim: One home is listed publicly above $4 million in the village, an\nornate castle-style estate\nthat went on the market in April for just under $5 million.\n",

In some markets, the increases were sharper: One-bedroom rents jumped nearly 17 percent in Waukegan and Gurnee.\nOccupancy rates are tight at 97.5 percent.\n\nMedian rents increased by 6 percent for two-bedroom apartments in McHenry County and by 5.5 percent in Naperville and Aurora year-over-year.\nThe suburban luxury boom cuts across demographics. Empty nesters and retirees are trading single-family homes for maintenance-free apartments. Younger families are renting in good school districts while waiting out high mortgage rates. And professionals untethered from downtown commutes are opting for suburban properties that blend comfort with convenience.\nDevelopers are taking note.

The total project cost is pegged at $89 million, which amounts to $1.5 million per residential unit.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The $180 million development at 220 Park Road recently transformed a former post office into high-end offices in the heart of Burlingame, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nDostart Development Company and\nSares Regis\npartnered to build 220 Park. Industrious\u2019 lease will take up about two-thirds of the building\u2019s fourth floor, making the co-working company the largest tenant the developers have landed so far. Last year, private equity firm SkyKnight Capital leased about 10,000 square feet at the property. Dostart and Sares Regis could also be solidifying another lease with another firm, sources familiar with negotiations told the Business Times.\nThe 220 Park building, located near the\nBurlingame Caltrain station\n, is also expected to include a restaurant from a Michelin-starred hospitality group. In total, the building has about 168,000 square feet of offices and 17,000 square feet of retail.\nIndustrious views Burlingame as a market ripe for activity between San Francisco and Palo Alto as professionals across the Peninsula who want to work closer to home could have a new place to set up camp\u2013a hybrid model somewhere between work-from-home and return-to-office.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of coworking in San Francisco and a fair amount in Palo Alto, but nothing in Burlingame,\u201d Peri Demestihas, head of real estate for Industrious, told the Business Times. \u201cIt\u2019s a pocket filled with folks who say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to go into San Francisco or Palo Alto. I want to live and work here.\u2019\u201d\nWhile growing tech firms relied on co-working spaces like WeWork offices to expand quickly, they\u2019ve since shifted more to hybrid work in their own offices. The artificial intelligence boom in the Bay Area at large is a prime example of the trend, as companies from OpenAI and\nAnthropic\nto\nGlean\nand\nSnowflake\nsearch for or build AI-focused office space across the Peninsula and South and East Bay.\nIn addition to the new Industrious location in Burlingame, the company is growing in the South Bay with two locations in development near Stanford.\nIn total, businesses and research and development companies sought 4.3 million square feet of office space in the Peninsula, according to CBRE data cited by the Business Times. That marks a 57 percent jump from the second quarter. Leasing activity, meanwhile, was up 76 percent.\nCBRE took full ownership of Industrious\nearlier this year in an acquisition valuing the company at $800 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The contracts had a total last asking volume of over $62 million,\ndown from last week\u2019s $79 million over 24 contracts\n.\nThe penthouse at 17 Bergen Street in Boerum Hill led the luxury market with a last asking price of $6.9 million. The home is part of a four-unit condo project from over a decade ago, in which the sponsors, Hestor and Elizabeth Dominguez, retained control of the units after it was declared effective in 2012.\nThe pair had originally listed the non-penthouse units during the middle of the 2008 Financial Crisis before taking them off the market until this September. Two of the other units are also in contract, asking nearly double what they originally were in 2009.\nThe penthouse spans over 3,800 square feet and includes five bedrooms and four bathrooms. The home comes with three private terraces and a private roofdeck outfitted with an automatic irrigation system.\nA keyed elevator opens up onto each floor of the home. The primary suite comes with a walk-in closet, a south-facing terrace and ensuite bathroom with a stand-alone tub and double shower.\n\nCompass\u2019 Toni Nicolo and Brown Harris Stevens\u2019 Jennifer Cooke had the listing.\nThe second priciest contract last week went to a Cobble Hill townhouse at 339 Clinton Street asking $5.7 million.\nSpanning 4,000 square feet, the home comes with seven bedrooms and five bathrooms. The seller is Lindsey Branca, who owns a residential restoration and renovation firm, Branca &amp; Co. She previously worked for her family\u2019s New Jersey-based commercial real estate firm, Branca Properties.\nBranca bought the property in 2020 for $3.8 million.\nLevel Group\u2019s Christopher Au had the listing.\nHomes put into contract last week had a median asking price of $2.7 million and an average price per square foot of $1,322.\n",

        "content": "Most of the\nnew Texas laws affecting business\ntook effect last month, but a few are constitutional amendments up for statewide vote, plus a few local propositions on, Nov. 4.\nAmong the most consequential ballot measures is a referendum on\nProject Marvel\n, the $4 billion plan for a downtown mixed-use development built around a new Spurs arena.\nProposition B would allow Bexar County to use $311 million of the venue tax money to fund the arena.\u00a0 Proposition A would raise the county\u2019s hotel occupancy tax to collect $197 million to redevelop the San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo grounds.\nThe\nproject\nalso includes a convention center expansion, a 5,000-seat entertainment venue in the John Woods Courthouse and upgrades to the Alamodome. Local leaders have sought funding from a variety of sources, including tax credits, venue taxes and the\nSpurs organization\n.\nNewly elected\nSan Antonio Mayor Gina Ortiz has been skeptica\nl of the project and the size of the team\u2019s contribution.\nA\nrecent poll\nfound middling support for both measures.\nHere\u2019s what is on the statewide ballot.\nProtecting Y\u2019all Street\nProposition 6 is basically red carpeting for\nY\u2019all Street\n. The measure would prohibit the legislature from imposing an occupation tax on financial market operators, such as exchanges, and from creating new taxes on securities transactions. Sponsors filed the legislation in response to proposed taxes in New York and New Jersey which prompted Nasdaq to consider moving to Texas.\n\nProperty taxes\nThree statewide provisions would offer property tax relief. Proposition 11 would authorize the legislature to raise the school property tax exemption for elderly and disabled homeowners from $10,000 to $60,000. Proposition 13 would raise the homestead exemption from school district property taxes from $100,000 to $140,000 for all homeowners. Proposition 17 would authorize the legislature to cap the value of land in Texas border counties if it appreciates due to border security improvements.\nAt the local level, Austin voters will consider Proposition Q, a property tax rate hike. The increased revenue will support programs intended to increase housing affordability and reduce homelessness, according to the city, including $12 million to fund 350 new housing units.\nInheritance tax\nTexas doesn\u2019t have an inheritance tax, but Proposition 8 would permanently ban the legislature from establishing one.\nAn inheritance tax is a levy on bequests. The heir is responsible for paying the tax.\nThe amendment would ban such taxes on the state level, as well as taxes on the transfers of estates, inheritances, successions or gifts from one person, family, estate or trust to another. Estate taxes are similar to inheritance taxes but are paid by the estate or trust itself before distribution to heirs.\nA tenth of recent American homebuyers relied on an inheritance for their purchase, according to\nRedfin\n. An inheritance tax could shrink this share of buyers in Texas, or reduce their buying power.\nFive states have an inheritance tax. There is also a federal estate tax, though it\u2019s only required for estates with combined gross assets and prior taxable gifts exceeding $15 million, or $30 million for married couples.\n",

        "content": "A demolition company has agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle claims that it repeatedly flouted New York\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws, retaliated against injured workers and failed to address reports of sexual harassment.\nAlba Services, a nonunion demolition subcontractor, must pay $1.4 million to nearly 700 current and former employees, as well as $100,000 to a settlement administrator who will coordinate those payments to employees, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced Tuesday.\nAlba allegedly failed to report hundreds of workplace injuries between 2016 and 2024, which allowed the company to lower its insurance costs. The company also threatened employees who tried to file workers\u2019 compensation claims, according to the attorney general\u2019s office.\nThe settlement comes after the laborers\u2019 union, Local 79, launched a public\ncampaign\nagainst the firm in 2022, accusing Alba of offering rewards for information on employees who filed \u201cfalse\u201d workers\u2019 compensation claims as an intimidation tactic. The attorney general\u2019s office began investigating Alba in 2022, after receiving information from the union.\nThe investigation confirmed allegations previously publicized by the union, according to the attorney general\u2019s office.\nFor instance, the firm posted flyers naming workers who filed such claims, accused them of fraud and offered $5,000 for information leading to their arrests, officials said. Andrew Horan, Alba\u2019s owner, allegedly sent text messages to his construction foremen, unlawfully naming workers who filed claims and offering cash for information about them. The attorney general\u2019s office found the company wrongfully disclosed employees\u2019 names on at least 60 occasions.\nState officials also accused Alba of sending company representatives to hospitals and urgent care centers with injured employees, in order to feed incorrect information to medical professionals about how and where workers were injured. The company also allegedly directed injured workers to specific clinics to hide workplace injuries, even in cases where the employee required emergency care.\n\nIn a press release, James\u2019 office also described two women who were sexually harassed by an Alba foreman. When the workers rejected the foreman\u2019s advances, he assigned them more demanding work, and in one case, cut hours.\nAs part of the settlement agreement, Alba must fire the foreman and adopt anti-harassment policies and training. The company will also be overseen by the attorney general\u2019s office for at least three years, and must file biannual reports showing that it is complying with workers\u2019 compensation and human rights laws.\nA message left for Alba, and an email sent to Horan seeking comment were not immediately returned.\nSeparately, in 2023, Alba was one of 26 companies\nindicted\nin a wide-ranging construction kickback scheme. Alba received $2.8 million in inflated contracts and change orders at 250 Fifth Avenue and 189 Bowery, the indictment claimed.\nLocal 79 has targeted other nonunion firms over the years, some of which have resulted in action by the attorney general. In 2020, James\nbrokered\nan agreement with TradeOff Construction Services to settle allegations that the firm didn\u2019t address sexual harassment reported by its employees.\nDuring its campaign against Alba, the union called on developers and even\npension fund managers\nto sever ties with the subcontractor. The union protested Alba\u2019s work at Columbia Property Trust and\nL&amp;L Holding\n\u2019s Terminal Warehouse and Rockrose\u2019s redevelopment of the St. Francis College building.\n\u201cThis settlement isn\u2019t just about Alba, it is about non-union workers throughout the city who suffer under similar circumstances,\u201d Anthony Vita, business manager at Local 79, said in a statement. \u201cThis is an important step in leveling the playing field for responsible contractors.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Fresh off completing the largest known 3D-printed homes community in Texas, Lennar is proposing to incorporate 3D-printed homes in one of its south Miami-Dade County projects.\nMiami-based Lennar, led by Stuart Miller and Jon Jaffe, is proposing 3D-printed model homes at the 31-acre development site where it plans 88 homes in the Redland neighborhood, according to its application filed last week.\nThe development site is on the northeast corner of Southwest 288th Street and Krome Avenue in unincorporated Miami-Dade. Lennar paid\n$16.3 million\nfor the property in September.\nThe 3-D printing applies only to the model homes, but the move signals that Lennar is expanding its use of the efficient construction technology to South Florida. This spring, Lennar completed a\n100-home community\nin Georgetown, Texas, where all homes were 3D-printed. Lennar partnered with Austin, Texas-based Icon on that project.\nLennar has a reputation for its efficient development and sales approach.\nIn 3D-printed homes, a large printer \u201clayers a concrete-like material to form the structural walls of each residence,\u201d Lennar\u2019s attorney, Alberto Torres, wrote in the application. The homes will be \u201cdurable, code-compliant\u201d and \u201carchitecturally comparable in scale and appearance\u201d to the conventional homes already approved for the project.\n\nLennar, co-founded by Miller\u2019s late father, Leonard Miller, in the 1950s, is the second biggest homebuilder in the U.S. and the\nmost dominant one\nin south Miami-Dade. The area \u2013\u2013 home to the municipalities of Homestead and Florida City, as well as the neighborhoods of Naranja, Princeton, Leisure City, Goulds, Perrine and Redland \u2013\u2013 has an ample supply of buildable land that sells for less than sites in Miami\u2019s prime areas.\nLennar holds a near-monopoly on south Miami-Dade homebuilding through its partnerships with land banks, which allow it to stockpile development sites until it\u2019s ready to start developing them.\nSome of Lennar\u2019s other south Miami-Dade projects are a planned\n106-townhome community\non the northwest corner of Southwest 338th Street and Southwest 192nd Avenue near Homestead.\nNear Goulds, Lennar plans Rodan Estates with\n138 homes\non the southeast corner of Southwest 220th Street and Southwest 133rd Court.\nIn its biggest proposal, Lennar, in partnership with developers Ed Easton and Bill Albers, wants to develop\nCity Park\nwith 7,800 residential units that will include single-family homes, townhomes and apartments; 2.4 million square feet of commercial space, including office space, retail, dining and schools; and open space. The project is proposed for a nearly 1,000-acre land tract in south Miami-Dade, outside Miami-Dade\u2019s Urban Development Boundary, the line meant to curb suburban sprawl west toward the Everglades.\nCity Park requires a supermajority approval from Miami-Dade commissioners.\n",

That rate is less than half of what a similar building in Uptown fetched earlier this year.\nIn August, Atlanta-based Cousins Properties bought the 292,000-square-foot\nThe Link in Uptown for $218 million\n, or more than $746 per square foot. The property was delivered in 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, a 2008-built office property in Uptown sold for more than $588 per square foot when German investor Union Investment Real Estate sold 2000 McKinney to Crescent Real Estate. The German investor said in a release that the sale price topped the property\u2019s $291.5 million valuation, putting the price per square foot for the 485,000-square-foot building at around $600.\nThe sales comparison shows even trophy offices in the \u2019burbs aren\u2019t fetching the same prices as new builds in Uptown, which has become the nexus of built-to-suit office development for financial services firms, nicknamed\nY\u2019all Street\n.\nOffice markets in the North Dallas suburbs have performed particularly well as companies look to locate near where employees live.\nThe Allen-McKinney submarket had a vacancy rate of 20.1 percent, the lowest rate on the Dallas side of the Metroplex except for Preston Center, where vacancy was just 7.9 percent, according to a recent report from Avison Young.\nUptown\u2019s vacancy rate hovers around the overall level for the Metroplex, at 25.5 percent. It also has more than four times the office inventory as Allen-McKinney.\n",

Builder and pricing details are still under wraps.\nJohnson Development has made refinements to the original plan, expanding the community\u2019s open-space and recreation features, CEO Michael Smith said.\nRoughly 1,200 acres \u2014 nearly 40 percent of the property \u2014 will be preserved as green space, with 26 miles of trails winding through heavily wooded stretches along Hickory Creek. The community will also feature two lakes, a pair of amenity centers, a 50-acre city park and a 55-acre business park.\nOn the civic side, about 206 acres will be reserved for two elementary schools, a middle school and a high school within the Denton ISD. Another 156 acres are earmarked for commercial use.\n\nThe site is just south of Hillwood\u2019s 3,200-acre\nLandmark\nproject.\nDenton Range, managed by Silvestri Investments, is an investor in the project. Johnson Development is already active in North Texas with its\nViridian\ncommunity in Arlington and\nTrinity Falls\nin McKinney.\nPlans for Cole Ranch stretch back to the mid-2010s, when the city first held public hearings on the massive residential proposal.\nThe Texas Legislature approved a municipal management district for the site in 2019. Earlier this year, Denton City Council tweaked the zoning for more than 300 acres from light industrial land in favor of residential and mixed-use development, signaling the city\u2019s shift toward a more community-oriented buildout.\nThe property has deep local roots. The Cole family has owned the land since the 1930s, when Miner Thomas \u201cM.T.\u201d Cole ran it as a working ranch. His great-granddaughter Jennifer Alexander said the family sought a partner that would honor the history and the beauty of the area.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A decade after a debut that aimed to enshrine it as a gleaming symbol of ultraluxury living, Manhattan\u2019s 432 Park Avenue \u2014 the pencil-thin supertall that helped define Billionaires\u2019 Row \u2014 is cracking, literally and figuratively.\nOnce marketed as the epitome of perfection, the 1,400-foot tower faces a nine-figure repair bill and a wave of lawsuits as experts warn that its sleek white concrete shell is deteriorating, the New York Times\nreported\n. Consultants hired by residents estimate repairs could exceed $160 million.\nEngineers documented hundreds of fractures and spalling concrete along the facade, raising concerns that wind stress and water infiltration could eventually render parts of the 102-story tower unsafe or even uninhabitable.\nInspectors maintain the building poses no immediate danger, but recent filings show missing chunks of concrete and cracks forming in load-bearing sections. Independent engineers say the building\u2019s all-white concrete \u2014 chosen for its pristine aesthetic \u2014 may have compromised its strength.\nDeveloper Harry Macklowe and the late architect Rafael Vi\u00f1oly insisted on a flawless white exterior to distinguish the project from Midtown\u2019s glassy competition. But that design decision set off years of internal warnings, email clashes and rejected fixes during construction.\n\u201cColor or cracks,\u201d one structural engineer for the project cautioned in 2012, after developers refused to use a darker, more durable concrete mix. The cracks appeared anyway.\n\nThe tower\u2019s woes \u2014 from creaking walls to burst pipes and elevator malfunctions \u2014 have since\nspawned litigation\nbetween its condo board and the development team, including Macklowe Properties and CIM Group.\nThe board alleges the developers sold defective units and concealed structural flaws. CIM denies wrongdoing, calling the deterioration claims \u201cbaseless\u201d and blaming the board for poor maintenance.\nMacklowe and WSP, responsible for the tower\u2019s structural engineering, declined to comment to the Times. Vi\u00f1oly\u2019s firm did not respond to requests for comment.\nWhile\nlitigation\nand debate rage on, resident concerns about property values and broader concerns about safety for tenants and the community living in the shadow of the tower press on, too.\nAs one engineer put it, \u201cA 10-year-old building should not be showing that level of deterioration. Nobody can argue that that is not a failure.\u201d\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The future of one of Dallas\u2019 most recognizable landmarks \u2014 I.M. Pei\u2019s inverted-pyramid City Hall \u2014 is up for debate.\nCity Council is deciding whether the city should pour hundreds of millions into deferred maintenance for the aging municipal headquarters or sell it outright, potentially opening the downtown site to private redevelopment, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nAn\narena for the Dallas Mavericks\nis among the plays being pitched for the site.\nThe conversation marks the first major undertaking for Mayor Eric Johnson\u2019s new Committee on Government Efficiency, tasked with reviewing Dallas\u2019 vast real estate holdings \u2014 starting with the seven-story, 1 million-square-foot building at\n1500 Marilla Street\n.\nThe cost to fix it isn\u2019t small. Deferred maintenance has surpassed $100 million, with documents pegging the total rehabilitation bill anywhere between $152 million and $345 million.\nAbout $50 million of that is tied to the parking garage alone, which has leaks and flooding \u2014 problems that date back to before the building opened in 1978. Other fixes include an outdated HVAC system, roof replacement, plumbing and ADA upgrades, and a long-broken cafeteria grease trap.\nCouncil member\nChad West\n, who sits on the new committee, said the issue has been kicked down the road for decades.\n\u201cIt will be an emotional decision,\u201d West told the outlet. \u201cBut we have a responsibility to act like grown-ups.\u201d\n\nWest acknowledged that while the building holds historical significance, maintenance hasn\u2019t been a top public priority amid other pressing needs like public safety and infrastructure.\nPreservationists, however, argue that selling City Hall would be a grave mistake. Sarah Crain of Preservation Dallas said the building is more than just a workplace \u2014 it\u2019s \u201cthe people\u2019s building,\u201d designed to symbolize Dallas\u2019 renewal after President Kennedy\u2019s assassination.\n\u201cThe conversation shouldn\u2019t be about why we are investing in City Hall,\u201d Crain said. \u201cIt should be about why aren\u2019t we?\u201d\nDallas Morning News architecture critic Mark Lamster echoed that view, calling demolition \u201can act of epic mismanagement.\u201d He pointed to Boston\u2019s renovation of its own Brutalist city hall as a model for Dallas.\nStill, others see opportunity in the dirt under Marilla Street. City Hall sits on prime downtown land that could attract a major developer \u2014 even a sports franchise. With the Mavericks\nexploring arena options\n, some have floated the idea of repurposing the site for a new entertainment anchor.\nCity documents suggest relocating City Hall to a nearby office tower, with candidates including Bank of America Plaza and Comerica Bank Tower. The city owns roughly\n5,800 properties\n, and the debate comes as leaders aim to modernize downtown and reassure investors after missteps like the ill-fated \u201c\nLemon on Stemmons\n,\u201d a $29 million permitting-office debacle that ended in a fire sale.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Fort Partners will proceed with its buyout of a West Palm Beach condominium following a legal skirmish with Related Ross that ended in a settlement last week,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nThe legal battle that started with a Related Ross affiliate filing a request for an injunction in April came to a close on Friday, Oct. 17, when\nSteve Ross\n\u2019 Related and Nadim Ashi\u2019s\nFort Partners\nsettled out of court, Ashi\u2019s attorney Glen Waldman confirmed. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Waldman confirmed Fort Partners plans to move forward with a condo termination for Harbor Towers, the 2-acre, two-building, 61-unit complex at 3901 South Flagler Drive.\nRepresentatives for Related did not respond to immediate requests for comment.\nWhile it was the fight for control of Harbor Towers that precipitated the legal battle, the true scope of the developers\u2019 entanglement spans three waterfront sites totaling nearly 4.3 waterfront acres. It\u2019s a sizable swath of waterfront land across the Intracoastal Waterway from Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club, at a time when few waterfront sites in West Palm Beach remain.\nThe sites they targeted include Harbor Towers, as well as the 60-unit condominium Southbridge at 3915 South Flagler Drive and a multifamily complex at 3907 South Flagler Drive and 3906 Washington Road.\n\nRelated and Fort Partners made competing offers to owners at Southbridge last year, with Related\u2019s $42 million bid winning out. The price works out to $700,000 per unit, in a building where the property appraiser estimates market value for most units at about $200,000. Records show Related affiliate Southbridge Acquisitions LLC has closed on 17 units since December. It is unclear if or when Related plans to close on the remaining units.\nAshi\u2019s affiliate WPB S Flagler Owner LLC bought the adjacent apartment complex at 3906 Washington Road and 3907 South Flagler Drive for $20 million in November, records show.\nRelated\u2019s affiliate Harbor Towers Acquisitions LLC and Ashi\u2019s affiliate WPB Harbor Towers Acquisition LLC started inking competing deals with Harbor Towers in the spring. Waldman said Fort had deals in place with the majority of units and had secured control of the condo board when the Related affiliate filed its suit in Palm Beach County Circuit Court in April, requesting an injunction to block Fort\u2019s changes to the condominium declaration. The legal fight escalated in September, when Related filed motions for protective orders to block the deposition of Steve Ross and Related executive vice president Jordan Bargas. Fort\u2019s attorneys responded, accusing Related of stalling under the guise of settlement talks. Two weeks later, a deal was signed.\nFort\u2019s attorney, Waldman, who represents the holdout owners in the\nBiscayne 21 case against Two Roads Development\n, said he was comfortable representing a developer in this case because of the prices Fort Partners offered in its buyout. Recorded sales to Fort\u2019s Harbor Towers affiliate range in price from $1 million to $3.3 million, more than double the market values assessed by the property appraiser.\n\u201cThe amount of money being offered was significantly in excess of what [the units] were worth,\u201d he said. \u201cThese owners were making so much money, there are no losers here.\u201d",

The plan includes $98 million in city funds and historic tax credits \u2014 the kind of public support developers say is crucial to making office-to-residential conversions pencil out.\n\u201cBut for the incentive, this will not work,\u201d AmTrust managing director\nPatrick Kearney\ntold the outlet, whose firm has owned the 45-story property for over a decade.\nConstruction is expected to begin in early 2026, with the first units delivering in summer of 2027.\nThe plan calls for 270 market-rate and 116 affordable apartments \u2014 all priced for renters earning up to 60 percent of area median income. Units will average about 700 square feet, with projected rents in the mid-to-upper $3 per square foot range.\n\nTwo full floors will provide 180 parking spaces, while lower levels will offer retail, event space and possibly a small grocer, caf\u00e9 or fitness concept.\nBuilt in 1934 and landmarked in 1994, the Field Building \u2014 designed by Graham, Anderson, Probst &amp; White \u2014 was once Chicago\u2019s fourth-largest office tower. Its \u201cH\u201d-shaped floor plan and deep setbacks, ill-suited for modern open-office tenants, lend themselves to residential layouts, said Riverside\u2019s Mike Potter.\n\u201cThe very principle that every office had access to natural light and air makes these floor plates ideal for efficient apartments,\u201d Potter said.\nThe building\u2019s fortunes dimmed after Bank of America vacated roughly 900,000 square feet in 2020, leaving a rare block of contiguous\nvacancy\nthat made conversion easier.\n\u201cThis is a really authentic Chicago property,\u201d Potter said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see the Loop reinvent itself \u2014 again \u2014 from the inside out.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The appraisal amounts to $464 per square foot and a drop of 60 percent.\nThe 28,000-square-foot building was valued at $32.2 million in 2015.\nThe loan backed by the property was transferred to special servicing this spring, after Google left the building, out of fear of imminent default due to decreasing occupancy and cash flow at the building.\nThe debt originated at almost $19.8 million and matured in April; the outstanding balance was just shy of $17 million earlier this month.\nThree of the building\u2019s largest tenants had leases at the building that were scheduled to expire by September.\n\nGoogle\noccupied about 20 percent of the building with a 9,200-square-foot lease that expired in April. The Alphabet-owned company has been slimming down its Bay Area office portfolio in recent years, declining to renew several downtown leases last year, including a 342,000 square feet at One Market Plaza.\nCitibank is next to head out the door. The banking giant will close its branch at 260 California in February, in addition to a location at 245 Market Street, in favor of its new location at 1 California Street.\nWith the large leases expiring, the building\u2019s vacancy hovers around 50 percent, David Putro, head of commercial real estate analytics for Morningstar Credit, told the outlet. At the time of its initial appraisal in 2015, the property was 96 percent occupied. Up until the most recent vacancies, the loan tied to the building had performed well.\nSwift Real Estate Partners is working with the special servicer under a pre-negotiation agreement and has submitted a proposal for loan modification.\nThe building was erected in 1910 and renovated in 2009. The property has a penthouse space known as Newhall Nest, which is used as a tenant amenity and private event space.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The debt works out to $355 per square foot.\nThe auction is scheduled for Nov. 4 at 10 a.m. at the Dallas County Courthouse.

In April, the building was just 54.1 percent leased.\nThe foreclosure comes six months after Harwood\nhanded back the keys to Harwood No. 4\nand 10 months after a\nlast-minute recapitalization deal\nsaved Saint Ann Court (Harwood No. 6) from foreclosure.\nThe Dallas-based developer allegedly defaulted on an $80 million mortgage tied to Harwood No. 4, a 20-story, 221,000-square-foot office building at 2828 North Harwood Street. San Francisco-based Spear Street Capital took back that 221,000-square-foot property in a $73 million credit bid.\nSaint Ann Court, a 25-story office building at 2501 North Harwood Street, was set to be auctioned on Jan. 7, but Harwood reached a deal with Life Company to recapitalize the property.

        "content": "The rising cost of keeping New York\u2019s affordable housing afloat has reached crisis levels.\nA new report from Enterprise Community Partners and the National Equity Fund found operating costs for nearly 40,000 government-funded apartments in the state surged about 40 percent since 2017. Insurance premiums more than doubled in that period, a spike that could jeopardize long-term affordability, Gothamist\nreported\n.\nThe analysis covered 428 developments comprising 37,130 income-restricted units that rely on public subsidies to cap rents. Property and liability insurance proved the most volatile expense, climbing so fast that one policy expert likened it to \u201ca runaway train for New York.\u201d\nRent collections also declined, dropping from roughly 95 to 91 percent between 2017 and 2024, resulting in lost revenue and growing expenses.\nFor the nonprofit landlords that dominate this sector (roughly two-thirds of owners), the squeeze is severe. Kieran Harrington, chief executive officer of RiseBoro \u2014 which manages more than 4,000 affordable units citywide \u2014 said his group\u2019s insurance costs ballooned from about $5 million in 2024 to $11.3 million this year. The organization is deferring maintenance and weighing cuts to resident services to stay afloat.\nEnterprise\u2019s Patrick Boyle, who helped author the study, said raising rents isn\u2019t an option for deeply affordable properties. Instead, he urged city and state officials to step in with funding streams for repairs, expanded rental assistance programs like CityFHEPS and collective insurance strategies to counter market volatility.\n\nThat recommendation echoes a broader debate in this year\u2019s mayoral race, where candidates have seized on affordability \u2014 and landlords\u2019 cost burdens \u2014 as defining issues.\nDemocratic nominee Assembly member Zohran Mamdani has championed a landlord insurance collective known as Milford Street, seeded with\n$2 million in state support\n, as a model for stabilizing expenses. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent, has pushed for longer-term subsidies, while Republican Curtis Sliwa has focused on rolling back tenant protections.\nBehind the political rhetoric lies a stark math problem: with costs outpacing revenues, nonprofit operators face the prospect of losing buildings that anchor the city\u2019s affordable stock, threatening tenants.\nAs Boyle put it, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to exacerbate a housing instability crisis, a homelessness crisis and a cost of living crisis in New York.\u201d\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The seller was an entity linked to the estate of the late Dubai businessman Iyer Vaidyanathan Narayan.\nThe 10-story, 75,000-square-foot building \u2014 home to the Chatwal and the Lambs Club restaurant \u2014 sits on land owned by the Metro New York District Church of the Nazarene. Narayan took over the ground lease in 2013 for $115 million, according to\nPincusCo\n, which first reported the sale.\nThe deal comes almost two years after a lender run by the London-based billionaire Reuben Brothers launched a non-judicial foreclosure on the hotel\u2019s debt. The Reubens sought to seize the leasehold after Narayan allegedly defaulted on a $62.5 million loan. The debt was expected to swell to $79 million by the time of a scheduled auction in January 2024.\n\nBut the auction never happened, and the case wound its way through the state Supreme Court for more than two years. Narayan died in February 2024, according to court filings, and the case was recently settled.\nSant Singh Chatwal\u2019s Hampshire Hotels redeveloped the 1905 Art Deco property and opened the Chatwal in 2010. In 2022, Hyatt took over the operations of the Chatwal, along with a portfolio of other hotel brands.\nThat same year, shipping company Astra Global sued Narayan, alleging that he secretly misappropriated $50 million from Astra\u2019s accounts and used it to invest in the\u202fChatwal\u202fand several other properties, according to\nBusiness Insider\n.\nRepresentatives for Ben-Josef Group, Narayan\u2019s estate and Reuben Brothers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",

Among the homebuilder\u2019s other South Florida projects are\na 42-unit luxury single-family home community in Wellington\n, planned for a 22.5-acre site it bought from the Catholic Church for $11.7 million last year. It also intends to build 60 new single-family homes in Davie on a\n$20.5 million\n31-acre site.\nBill Pulte\n, the grandson of the firm\u2019s founder William Pulte, is currently serving as Donald Trump\u2019s Federal Housing Finance Agency director. He and the president have been\nhammering homebuilders for their role in the national housing crisis\nin recent weeks, triggering an industry-wide stock slump earlier this month.",

        "content": "In the course of writing several\nrecent pieces\nabout co-ops, I have learned some interesting things about them.\nThese facts had somehow escaped me despite 56 years of living or covering real estate in New York City, the motherlode of residential co-ops.\nOne that jumped out at me: Co-op unit sales \u2014 which are actually sales of shares \u2014 were not recorded in ACRIS, the city\u2019s property records database, prior to 2003. Sales in HDFC co-ops are exempt from transfer taxes, so they still need not be recorded in ACRIS.\nThis made it difficult for me to investigate the\nbizarre history\nof unit transfers at 123-25 East 102nd Street in East Harlem. Actually, it would have been impossible if not for attorney Gregory Byrnes\u2019 having subpoenaed the co-op\u2019s records, which showed insiders passing units back and forth like baseball cards.\nI asked Adam Plotch, a veteran of co-op foreclosure auctions, how title insurers can verify the chain of ownership if the records are kept not in a public database or municipal office but in the dusty file cabinets of the co-op. The answer was, title companies don\u2019t necessarily rely on public records for co-op deals.\n\u201cAn original stock certificate and proprietary lease is immutable proof of ownership,\u201d he replied. \u201cA co-op will not issue a stock [certificate] and lease to a new owner until the old one is canceled. They also will not allow [them] to be transferred unless their own records reflect that the transferor is, indeed, the sole owner of the shares.\n\u201cSo if you have a stock and lease in your possession, and you couple that with the records of the co-op, it\u2019s as clear a record as any of valid ownership.\u201d\nThe system seems archaic to me. What would happen if fire destroyed a co-op\u2019s records and shareholders\u2019 stock certificates? How would anyone know who owned what?\nBut I don\u2019t want to single out co-ops. Records of real property transfers could also use modernization, as revealed by frequent reports of deed theft and fraud.\n\u201cA nefarious or sloppy owner of real property can, in theory, execute multiple deeds to the same property to multiple persons,\u201d Plotch noted. \u201cThis actually happens \u2014 and there\u2019s statutory and case law that determines how such conflicts are resolved: The first person to record his deed in the land records is deemed to be the owner.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nYiatin Chu and I have had our differences on X, but I couldn\u2019t argue with\nher post\non being a landlord in New York City: \u201cThis is what happened to my relatives. The renter subletted to someone who didn\u2019t pay. The squatter knew how to play the court system to delay. It took 3-yrs to evict. They won\u2019t get the $80k in unpaid rent and the tenant destroyed the place. It cost $70K to gut renovate. Many small property owners fear these situations and rather take their units off the market.\u201d Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\n\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: A Chicago judge is considering ordering tenants relocated from a violation-ridden building. In New York City, tenants aren\u2019t evacuated unless their building presents an imminent danger \u2014 because with the city\u2019s 1.4 percent vacancy rate, there is nowhere for them to go.\nElsewhere\u2026\nAn update on an item I wrote last week about a\nnew state law\nbanning algorithms that allow landlords to collude on rents:\nThe Real Estate Board of New York sent a statement explaining its strident opposition to the bill.\n\u201cAttempting to prevent collusion is laudable, but this legislation goes beyond regulations in other states, to the point of banning evaluation of public data outside of a property owner\u2019s portfolio when considering rents,\u201d said REBNY President Jim Whelan. \u201cWe believe more transparency and market analysis most often benefits the consumer and this bill will lead to unintended consequences like higher rents and reduced market efficiency.\u201d\nThat\u2019s quite a contrast to\nthis tweet\nby Jay Martin of the New York Apartment Association, which represents rent-stabilized owners (and doesn\u2019t always see eye-to-eye with REBNY):\n\u201cWe spent 0 time and energy opposing this bill. Why? We couldn\u2019t find any members that use \u2018algorithms to collude and raise rent.\u2019\u201d\nWith trademark sarcasm, he added, \u201cCongrats though. Eventually we\u2019ll get around to policy solutions that will make housing more affordable.\u201d\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$5.8 million\nfor a 2,500-square-foot condominium at The Caledonia at 450 West 17th Street in Chelsea.

        "content": "Blocking affordable housing is nothing to be proud of \u2014 especially for an affordable building getting public money.\nIt\u2019s certainly not something the state should encourage. But that appears to have happened at Inwood Gardens, a\nMitchell-Lama\nin northern Manhattan.\nShareholders of the co-op at 45 Fairview Avenue voted twice to sell a vacant lot to affordable housing developers for $7.3 million, only to back out. This came shortly after a state affordable housing agency handed the co-op a $2.5 million mortgage from its\nPreventative Troubled Assets Program\n.\nThen this year, the state Assembly awarded Inwood Gardens\n$500,000\n.\n\u201cAt the same time the co-op was rejecting my offer to acquire its land, it was accepting bailouts from the state,\u201d said an exasperated Coconut Properties CEO Adam Zeidel, who partnered with the nonprofit RiseBoro Community Partnership on the proposal.\nInstead of 175 new, affordable apartments for seniors, the neighborhood was left with a garbage-strewn lot. The developers\u2019 six-year effort came to nothing. And taxpayers got stuck with the co-op\u2019s bills.\nIn short, everybody lost.\nCoconut and RiseBoro still hope to build the project, which would sit alongside a similar one they just constructed next door at\n37 Hillside Avenue\n(see photo, above). But the lenders they had lined up to finance the sister project have moved on.\nZeidel had implored the lenders to hang on as he attempted to rescue the deal with increasingly desperate emails to the state Division of Homes and Community Renewal and local elected officials.\n\u201cWe are simply seeking someone to mediate and navigate towards a resolution in which we can (i) give the Co-Op a big chunk of money (capital for present/future needs) and (ii) allows us to build a new, 100% affordable housing project on vacant land that the Co-Op has no use for,\u201d he wrote to a state official. \u201cThis result would benefit all parties.\u201d\nIn one message, the developer warned the state that by giving the co-op money, it was reducing the building\u2019s need to sell the land.\n\n\u201cAny time the Co-Op needs capital, HCR provides it,\u201d Zeidel emailed the agency. \u201cSo, what is the incentive for the Co-Op to make a deal?\u201d\nThe agency told\nThe Real Deal\nthat it has not awarded Inwood Gardens funding \u201crecently\u201d and that Mitchell-Lamas are privately owned and responsible for their operating expenses and maintaining their physical and financial integrity.\nMitchell-Lamas across the state have received\nnearly $500 million\nfrom the Hochul administration. Good fiscal practices are not required to qualify. To the contrary, dire financial circumstances appear to strengthen affordable co-ops\u2019 arguments for state help.\nThe case of Inwood Gardens shows that even when these co-ops make bad financial decisions and block housing that Gov. Kathy Hochul says is desperately needed across the state, they still get public grants to patch budget holes.\nEconomists might call that a moral hazard: The co-ops only get public money if they can show that they need it. Had Inwood Gardens sold its unused land for $7.3 million, it would be able to repair its retaining wall without a handout from taxpayers.\nThe co-op\u2019s shareholders voted overwhelmingly in 2021 to approve the deal, and its board followed suit, but never signed the sales agreement. Zeidel never got an explanation that made sense.\n\u201cEach time we got to putting pen to paper to execute the contract, the Co-Op backed out for some novel, unrelated reason,\u201d he emailed the state in January.\nDavid Baron, head of Inwood Gardens\u2019 property manager at the time, Metro Management Development, told\nThe Real Deal\n, \u201cI cannot speak to the reasons the sale did not go through.\u201d\nThe co-op initially squeezed Coconut and RiseBoro for more money. Two years after voting for the deal, the board asked for 40 percent more cash, plus $100,000 to repair a retaining wall. The developers agreed.\nBut then the board overplayed its hand, raising its price another 30 percent. Realizing the co-op would never get to yes, Coconut and RiseBoro withdrew their offer.\n",

City officials claim the owner has yet to remove ash and debris from the deadly January wildfires. The home was featured in the fourth season of \u201cSuccession\u201d as the luxury estate of the fictional Roy family.\nThe five-member Los Angeles Board of Building and Safety Commissioners said the fire debris at the eight properties, which includes luxury estates, multifamily apartments and businesses, were a public nuisance and could be a risk to public health and safety. Officials say the owners of these properties failed to meet the Oct. 2 deadline to clear hazardous fire debris. With the Oct. 8 vote, owners must either clean up their lots or prepare for a city contractor to do it for them and slap them with a bill.\n\u201cOnce a property is declared a public nuisance, the owner has the right to abate the nuisance until the department solicits bids for the work,\u201d Gail Gaddi, a spokesperson for the L.A. Department of Building and Safety, said. \u201cA process or timeline has not been established for when the department will begin to solicit bids.\u201d\n\nThe six-bedroom, 18-bathroom mansion last sold in 2021 for $83 million. It was\nbuilt in 2020 by developer Ardie Tavangarian\nand is owned by 30-year-old Luminar Technologies founder Austin Russell,\naccording\nto The Daily Mail; in a \u201cSuccession\u201d-like twist, it was once owned by magazine magnate William Randolph Hearst. After the Palisades fire ripped through the neighborhood, the owner withdrew from the\nfederal debris removal program led by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\nout of worry that the government contractors wouldn\u2019t adequately preserve parts of the estate, according to Jon Mansfield, a representative for the owner. After learning that private debris cleanup would cost between $500,000 and $600,000, the owner changed their mind but it was too late to register.\n\u201cThere\u2019s millions of dollars of [building materials] that we were afraid would be destroyed in the process and further degrade the value of the property,\u201d Mansfield said.\nThe \u201cSuccession\u201d house and nearby lots are the latest properties in the Palisades to be declared a public nuisance nine months after the fire. Earlier this month, the Building and Safety Commission declared the 170-unit\nPacific Palisades Bowl Mobile Home Estates\ncommunity a public nuisance. The mobile home park\u2019s owner could similarly see the lots cleaned up and get a bill for the debris removal work.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

After selling out two Highland Park projects with record-setting\npenthouses\n, Fulton Developers is preparing to start construction on a third.\nMark Muller, principal of Fulton Developers, said the firm is seeking final City Council approval for its next project, the Walton, which would feature at least three penthouses priced above $3.7 million, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThat\u2019s the same range where Fulton has already closed six units \u2014 three at Park Sheridan and three more under contract half a mile away at the Wolbright. Rising construction costs could push prices closer to $4 million, Muller told the outlet, though he doesn\u2019t believe it would surpass that.\nThose figures put Highland Park condos in rarefied company, even compared with Chicago\u2019s top neighborhoods. Only a handful of\nGold Coast\nand\nLincoln Park\nunits have sold between $3.7 million and $4 million in the past year, and Fulton\u2019s sales now rival those.\nThe firm\u2019s $3.7 million Park Sheridan closings outpaced nearly all single-family sales in Highland Park during the same period.\nThe five-story Walton, to be located at the 1600 block of Second Street, was approved conditionally by the city council earlier this month, and would rise across from the under-construction Wolbright.\n\nThe site currently holds two houses and a 10-unit resi building. Its redevelopment would continue the corridor\u2019s shift from small-scale residences to luxury condos. The council asked Fulton to refine plans for on-site green space before granting final sign-off.\nWhen complete, the Walton will have 19 units, including multimillion-dollar penthouses and several others expected to top $1 million. Two units will be designated as affordable housing. Fulton aims to start construction in spring 2026.\nThe project marks the developer\u2019s seventh in Highland Park and extends a high-end experiment that\u2019s found surprising traction outside Chicago.\nMuller told Crain\u2019s last year that many affluent\nNorth Shore\nbuyers now prefer local luxury condos over city penthouses, citing concerns about crime and convenience. While other suburbs have struggled to land similar projects, he said Highland Park\u2019s walkable downtown and quiet side streets have made it the right fit for \u201ca penthouse lifestyle without the city.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Firms in the running to redevelop the location include sports businesses and industrial players as well as real estate investors and green tech companies.\nTrammell Crow Company, Pacific Maritime Association, Oakland Roots Sports Club, Industrial Realty Group, GreenCharge Mobility, Glovis America, Deca Companies, Outrigger Industrial and Vistra Corporation are all vying for the job.\nMore than 100 companies expressed interest\nin redeveloping the site, including real estate giants Prologis and Brookfield.\nCBRE-owned Trammell Crow views the\nredevelopment of Howard Terminal\nas an \u201cincredibly significant project for the East Bay,\u201d the company\u2019s Northern California market leader Adam Voelker said.\n\nThe\nOakland Roots Soccer Club\nsubmitted a proposal to build a 25,000-seat soccer stadium at Howard Terminal.

Tariffs, changes in global supply chains and increasing construction costs have already proven to be an obstacle for some, however, with a few proposals becoming financially infeasible and being withdrawn from consideration.\nFor now, Howard Terminal is being used largely for short-term property rental agreements for container parking, depot operations and other maritime uses.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n\\\n",

Furniture is included.\nAlthough Marfa is remote \u2014 it\u2019s a three-hour drive to El Paso, the nearest big city \u2014 the town is a national center of the art world, home to artists as prominent as Boyd Elder, who created the painted skulls for the Eagles\u2019 album covers, and Donald Judd, an acclaimed sculptor.\n\nSentient Jet, the luxury private aviation airline recommended by Sotheby\u2019s, serves Marfa Municipal Airport.\nBeyonc\u00e9\noccasionally visits; once she stayed at Ranch 2810, a 3,000-acre property 6 miles out of town available for rent at a little over $5,000 a night.\nThe Friedman Ranch rents for $1,500 to $2,500 per night, depending on the season; at the moment, a five-night stay costs a little over $9,000.\nAlthough the pressures of breakneck building and waning demand are weighing down prices more heavily in the\nSun Belt\u2019s big cities\n, small-town Marfa is also adjusting expectations.\nThe average home value decreased 3.1 percent year over year in September; nationally, home value increased modestly during the same period, according to Zillow.\nFriedman Ranch previously listed at $3.7 million but didn\u2019t sell, Burke said.\n\u201cIt likely needed a fresh price in the current market,\u201d he said.\n",

Ch\u00e1vez Boulevard from Hemisfair.\nThe project spans 4.7 acres at Lavaca and Matagorda streets, where Oxbow will demolish several small buildings to make way for 275 apartments, 40,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space and a parking garage. The six-story buildings will be arranged around tree-lined courtyards and pedestrian paths meant to echo the area\u2019s eclectic, walkable character, according to the filings.\nThe development marks Oxbow\u2019s first foray beyond its signature\nPearl campus\n, where it turned a defunct brewery into one of the city\u2019s most prominent mixed-use districts.\nConstruction is expected to wrap in 2027 or 2028.\n\nOxbow\u2019s plan includes relocating the historic Muench-Pollock House, a late-19th-century home sitting on the west side of Matagorda Street. Built in the 1890s and later owned by the San Antonio Independent School District, the structure will be deconstructed and moved to the corner of Matagorda and Lavaca pending further approval.\nThe project lands amid a broader city-led transformation of the area.\nSan Antonio officials are advancing plans for a sports and entertainment district anchored by a new Spurs arena at the former Institute of Texan Cultures. The proposed district would also include an expanded convention center, a renovated Alamodome, a second convention center hotel and a pedestrian land bridge linking the dome to downtown.\nNearby, Zachry Hospitality is nearing completion of the 17-story, 200-room\nMonarch San Antonio\nhotel, slated to open in March 2026.\nOther private projects in the Hemisfair area have been delayed, including a mixed-use development now controlled by GrayStreet Partners, which is set to deliver retail and parking by 2027 and apartments by 2030.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Delray Beach\u2019s planning and zoning board rejected a proposal to allow an indoor gun range in an industrial district, but the proposal will still head to the city commission.\nWallace Drive LLC, the owner of a 18,400-square-foot flex office warehouse built in 1983 at 1215 Wallace Drive, sought approval for a proposed ordinance that would allow indoor gun ranges in the Wallace Drive Overlay District. The 1.8-acre site is next to a senior housing community and a church and about 1,000 feet from an elementary school.\nFour out of seven planning and zoning board members voted against the proposal at a meeting on Monday evening.\nThe property owner wants to build an indoor gun range that will allow private members and\nDelray Beach\npolice officers to train with firearms, said Neil Schiller, Wallace Drive\u2019s attorney.\nThe legislation would also allow the owners of 12 other parcels within the same district (bounded by Southwest Tenth Street, Georgia Street, Southwest Ninth Avenue and Wallace Drive) to pursue plans for a gun range as well. Right now, the light industrial-zoned district includes a CubeSmart self-storage space, two additional warehouses, two single-family homes, and five vacant parcels (three of which are owned by the city).\nSchiller said under the proposed regulations, those property owners would have to submit their own plans to the city commission for final approval. All gun ranges in the district would be required to have 24-hour security, submit to the National Rifle Association\u2019s safety regulations, comply with noise regulations, and ban the sale of alcohol on the premises, he added.\nThe overlay district is adjacent to Groves of Delray II, an apartment community for people over the age of 62, and Calvary Bible Alliance Church.\u00a0 The district is also within 700 feet of Pine Grove Elementary School, board member Mitch Katz said.\nNevertheless, minimum distance requirements from homes and schools were absent from the proposed regulations pushed by Schiller and planning consultant Jeff Costello. Schiller said such details can be worked out during the conditional use process, but city planning staff pointed out that most other municipalities in Palm Beach County had distance requirements for gun ranges.\n\nKatz noted that they just had discussions about distance requirements for vape shops. \u201cBut gun ranges? Well, we can just put them across the street from a school,\u201d he remarked.\nSchiller replied that his client\u2019s building is at least 1,000 feet away from the school.\nThat didn\u2019t make board member Dedrick Straghn feel any less apprehensive about allowing a private gun range near a church and a senior residential community. Straghn also pointed out that gun ranges were already permitted in the city\u2019s mixed industrial and commercial district, where the Delray Shooting Center already operates just a quarter mile away.\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t smell right to me,\u201d Straghn said.\nMark Grafton, another attorney representing the developer, insisted that the range would be a state-of-the art facility that will meet the police department\u2019s needs, including training how to shoot in low-light conditions as well as how to breach doors.\nChairman Gregory Snyder proposed adding regulations that would require a future gun range to be 500 feet from a school, park, or church and that no noise louder than 60 decibels emit past the property line. But when the vote was called just Snyder, Katz and Roger Cope voted yes while board members Straghn, Price Patton, James Chard and Judy Mollica voted no.\nWallace Drive LLC, managed by Delia Lalchan, acquired 1215 Wallace Drive for $5.8 million in March from Aram LLC.\nThe property is about 1.5 miles away from where Kolter Group intends to build\nAlton Delray\n, a 386-unit apartment complex that will include 154 workforce apartments, under the state\u2019s Live Local Act. It\u2019s also less than two miles from\nAura Delray Beach\n, a 292-unit apartment community that an affiliate of New York-based Related Companies acquired for nearly $117 million in August.",

        "content": "Two recent apartment sales in Chicago this month point to the highs and lows of investing in the multifamily market since the pandemic rocked the economy, as local firms sold with disparate results to out-of-state buyers.\nNear the Lakeview neighborhood\u2019s border with Roscoe Village, a 95-unit, two-building complex known as the Low-Line Commons sold for $40 million to Utah-based Highland Partners, notching a solid win for its Chicago-based developers. The deal came out to about $421,000 per unit.\nMeanwhile, Chicago-based Origin Investments didn\u2019t fare as well on its $63 million sale of a West Loop complex to New York-based real estate fund LRE Management.\nTogether, the transactions illustrate the pitfalls of investing even with Chicago climbing the ranks of the nation\u2019s strongest multifamily markets, with a significant lack of new supply driving rents up in a trend poised to continue.\nA Chicago-based venture led by\nMatt Katsaros of Wildwood Investments\nand Michael Breheny of Contemporary Concepts broke ground in 2022 on the four-story Low-Line complex at 3431 North Ashland Avenue, which lines almost an entire block. The team refinanced the property for $27 million in January and less than a year later was able to sell it for well more to Highland.\n\u201cIt took us about just under four years to start and finish, which was our goal, and we sold it at about a 6-cap, which I think fits the current market environment,\u201d Katsaros said, referring to the deal\u2019s capitalization rate of about 6 percent. \u201cIt was a fair deal for us and for the purchasers \u2026 and we\u2019re very happy with the outcome.\u201d\nThe team also developed the adjacent 53-unit Topaz Apartments, which sold to local firm KMA Cos. and Property Management for $17.1 million, or about $322,000 per unit, last year.\nIn the West Loop, Origin sold the 120-unit Monroe Aberdeen apartments for a slight discount from its last purchase price to LRE. The property at 1050 West Monroe Street last traded for $65.8 million in early 2020, when Origin bought it from Michigan Avenue Real Estate Group, a developer backed by\nChicago Bulls and White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf\n.\nFor buildings like Monroe Aberdeen, which last traded at the onset of the pandemic, a sharp rise in interest rates and construction costs have disrupted otherwise strong fundamentals.\nOrigin typically invests in Mountain West and Sun Belt markets, but it\u2019s not walking away entirely from Chicago.\n\u201cOrigin will reinvest sale proceeds in select ground-up development projects in markets where Origin believes supply and demand imbalances create greater opportunities for rent growth and value creation on behalf of its investors,\u201d the firm said in a statement.\n\nSince the pandemic, distressed properties have been on\na wild ride to recovery\nas investor appetite for the market, and Chicago in particular, grows.\n\u201cThe strength of the rental market is the driving force behind these deals,\u201d said Interra Realty broker Joe Samzal, who represented the developers in the Low-Line Commons sale. \u201cIt certainly gives me confidence in what to expect in the next couple of years.\u201d\nHighland, the Low-Line Commons buyer, has spent $150 million on acquisitions throughout the U.S. this year, about half of which are in Chicago and its northern suburbs. That includes another project led by Breheny\u2019s Contemporary Concepts at 516 West Arlington Place in Lincoln Park. That sale came out to $10.3 million, or $739,000 per unit.\nLow-Line Commons\u2019 proximity to the Southport Corridor and mix of one- to three-bedroom units, which is unique for the area, were just two of several factors that piqued Highland\u2019s interest. The firm has offices in Chicago; Tucson, Arizona; and Ogden, Utah.\n\u201cWe love the Chicago market,\u201d Highland Partners co-founder Ben Frazer said. \u201cThe demand side has been great and there\u2019s really been strong employment growth.\u201d\nEven those who were previously hesitant to jump into Cook County\u2019s\nchaotic property tax system\nsay it\u2019s worth the risk now.\n\u201cFrom an underwriting perspective, we are comfortable with the uncertainty with the taxes,\u201d said Eric Londa, founder of LRE Management, the Monroe Aberdeen buyer based in Mamaroneck, New York.\nLRE has deployed about 40 percent of its capital in its fund so far, with a focus on not just Chicago but also Atlanta and Sarasota, Londa said.\nIncreased multifamily investor interest is also translating to an uptick in office-to-residential conversions, either subsidized or unsubsidized.\nWildwood, the seller of Low-Line Commons, recently took over a conversion project in Streeterville that was started by\nHorizon Realty Group\n. Horizon bought the property at 230 East Ohio Street for $5.6 million in late 2024, completed some of the interior work and then sold it to Wildwood for $9.75 million last week.",

The dumpling house is expected to open at The Brook in 2027.\nThe length of the lease at the Witkoff and Apollo Global Management-owned property was not disclosed, nor was the asking rent for the retail space. The average asking rent on retail space in Downtown Brooklyn ranged from $115 to $190 per square foot in the first half of the year, according to the Real Estate Board of New York.\nGoodSpace\u2019s Chris DeCrosta represented ownership on the lease, while Newmark\u2019s Ben Birnbaum represented the tenant.\nKnown for its soup dumplings and noodles, Din Tai Fung boasts more than 180 locations across the world.\nDin Tai Fung began as a cooking oil business founded by a Chinese refugee in 1958 before becoming a steamed dumpling and noodle restaurant in 1972. In 1993, the New York Times praised the restaurant as one of the\n10 best gourmet spots in the world\n. In 2010, its Hong Kong location was awarded a Michelin Star, the first time a Taiwanese restaurant ever earned such a distinction.\n\nIn New York City, it\nleased\n26,400 square feet at 1633 Broadway in Manhattan in 2022 for its first East Coast outpost.\nWitkoff and Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance\nscored a $388.4 million loan\nin the summer of 2022 to build a\n51-story, 591-unit tower\nat 567 Fulton Street. The development totals 448,000 square feet, including more than 30,000 square feet of retail across two adjacent sites.\nThe site was once owned by RedSky Capital and JZ Capital, who started creating an assemblage in 2012.

        "content": "A months-long legal battle between Rok Lending and Miami developer Marlon Gomez over a foreclosed development site in Aventura appears to be nearing an end after a slew of bankruptcy filings and failed last-minute court maneuvers.\nAn affiliate of Aventura-based\nRok Lending\n, led by CEO Bryan Morjain, paid $477,800 for the 1.6-acre property at 21291 Northeast 28th Avenue in a foreclosure auction held Sept. 3, court records show. The purchase followed a $19.9 million judgment the lender secured in February against Gomez\u2019s entity, which allegedly defaulted on a $15 million loan issued in 2023.\nThe Rok Lending affiliate received its certificate of title on Oct. 15, court records show.\nThe sale came after months of procedural delays stemming from Gomez\u2019s efforts to stave off foreclosure by filing two Chapter 11 petitions \u2014 filings that judges have repeatedly described as frivolous and in defiance of court orders.\nGomez hasn\u2019t given up though. His entity filed a notice with the Third District Court of Appeals that it will be filing a petition seeking to reverse the auction and the $19.9 million judgment.\n\u201cDuring this case, we have identified several erroneous factors that we believe will come to light as the appeal progresses,\u201d Gomez stated in an email. \u201cDespite the challenges of today\u2019s market we have financing ready and are actively working to repay the lender to resolve this matter.\u201d\nGomez has run out of time to resolve the debt, Morjain said.\n\n\u201cThe borrower defaulted nearly two years ago and has had ample time to refinance our position or sell the property,\u201d Morjain said. \u201cUnfortunately, none of the proposed take-outs materialized.\u201d\nGomez\u2019s first bankruptcy petition in April postponed a planned April 22 auction of the\nAventura site\n, where he has proposed building a 142,000-square-foot medical office building. In May, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Mark dismissed the case and barred Gomez\u2019s entity from refiling for Chapter 11 protection for 180 days.\nDespite the order, Gomez\u2019s company submitted a second bankruptcy petition just minutes before a rescheduled Aug. 4 foreclosure sale, prompting\nRok Lending\nto seek another dismissal in bankruptcy court, and reinstate the auction in Miami-Dade Circuit Court.\nIn its filings, the lender argued the August bankruptcy petition was void, saying continued delays were causing \u201cimmediate and irreparable damage\u201d since the property was underwater and accruing costs.\nOn Aug. 8, Judge Mark dismissed the second bankruptcy case and issued a stern warning: Gomez, his entity, and their counsel were prohibited from further attempts to delay the foreclosure sale without Rok Lending\u2019s written consent. Days later, Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Abby Cynamon reset the auction for Sept. 3, when the Rok affiliate ultimately emerged as the winning bidder.\nEven after losing the property, Gomez sought to delay the ownership transfer. He requested that Cynamon vacate the foreclosure sale and delay the transfer of title to Rok Lending. She denied both requests \u2014 first on Oct. 7, then again on Oct. 14 \u2014 effectively clearing the way for the lender to take full control of the site.\nThe Aventura site isn\u2019t the only troubled property tied to Gomez. On a separate front, a court-appointed receiver is marketing another distressed asset \u2014 a 1.8-acre Miami River development site \u2014 with an asking price of\n$18.1 million\n.

        "content": "Unionized workers at the OYO Times Square received a temporary reprieve, but the fight over the building\u2019s future still\nrages on\n.\nA Manhattan judge blocked the firing of more than 25 unionized workers at the hotel at 157 West 47th Street, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Landlord OYO Hotels broke state law by failing to provide the required 90-day notice before the mass terminations, according to the judge.\n\u201cThat\u2019s completely outrageous, actually, to terminate the employees without the notice to which they are entitled,\u201d New York County Supreme Court Judge Andrea Masley said, extending a temporary order.\nThe saga dates back to the beginning of August, when OYO allegedly blindsided property manager Highgate Hotels with a notice canceling its contract, according to a lawsuit filed by Highgate.\nThe cancellation attempt came four years ahead of schedule and included the citation of issues related to an entirely different property Highgate operates.\nThe issue centers on a 10-year management agreement entitling Highgate to a 3.25 percent cut of the 208-key hotel\u2019s gross revenue. OYO is supposed to provide working capital to the property, which Highgate describes as \u201cwell-performing.\u201d OYO begged to differ on Highgate\u2019s performance in the termination notice. The hotel owner said it now plans to welcome a new, unnamed property manager.\n\nThe fight pits one of New York\u2019s biggest management companies against one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing hotel owners.\nHighgate controls more than 30 New York hotels\nand 500 globally. OYO,\nbacked by SoftBank\n, bought Motel 6 from Blackstone last year for $525 million and is preparing an initial public offering that could value the company at $8 billion.\nThe effort to terminate Highgate\u2019s contract could be a means for OYO to cut expenses and boost earnings before the IPO.\nThe judge issued an ominous warning to lawyers from both parties.\n\u201cEventually you\u2019re going to break up. So figure out a way to do it pleasantly and expeditiously or I\u2019ll find a way to do it.\u201d\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "An affiliate California investor group whose tangled West Coast transactions stoked a regional bank stock slide last week also owns a pair of luxury rental buildings on the Upper East Side now at the center of an unusual lawsuit in New York City.\nThe firm, an affiliate of Cantor Group, bought 227 East 67th Street and 184 East 64th Street in 2019 for $38 million. They refinanced the properties with a nearly $20 million loan from Los Angeles-based Preferred Bank in 2023, but a buyer who entered into a 2024 contract to buy the properties claims that the Cantor affiliate refuses to close the deal. Zions Bancorporation and Western Alliance Bancorporation were the two banks whose concerns about Cantor led to the stock drop (and fears of\nbroader failure\n); the Upper East Side buildings\u2019 bizarre financial saga ties in a third regional bank: Preferred Bank.\nQuestions about Cantor emerged last week when Zions Bancorp announced that it was suing two Cantor Group funds along with investors\nGerald Marcil\nand\nAndrew Stupin\nand their associate Deba Shyam for misrepresenting the collateral underlying the bank\u2019s loans.\nWestern Alliance\nrevealed it had a similar lawsuit, alleging a Cantor fund used fake title policies to hide other bank\u2019s claims.\nZions Bancorp provided $60 million in loans to Cantor Group funds which were supposed to be used to purchase distressed mortgage loans. Western Alliance provided $100 million in loans as a revolving credit facility also to purchase mortgage loans.\n(A lawyer for Cantor Group said it upheld all its contractual obligations to Zions Bank and any suggestion to the contrary is a lie. The lawyer said \u201cthere have been multiple audits and independent reviews of these loans at the bank going back years and there have been no monetary defaults.)\nThe news rattled investors who feared the other regional banks would reveal write-downs on troubled loans. It also came in the wake of the bankruptcies of auto parts company First Brands and auto lender Tricolor, which led to losses at major Wall Street banks.\nOn Oct. 16, Zions Bancorp\u2019s shares slid 13 percent, while Western Alliance\u2019s shares fell over 10 percent. The bank\u2019s shares have recovered and are trading around 3 percent below where the banks were prior to the decline.\nThe flip\nMichael D\u2019Alessio owned the Upper East Side buildings at 227 East 67th Street and 184 East 64th Street, but in 2019, a court sentenced him to six years in prison after he pled guilty to defrauding investors out of $58 million in what prosecutors referred to as a \u201cPonzi-like\u201d scheme. His lender, Preferred Bank, initiated a foreclosure and purchased the properties through bankruptcy sale for a combined price of $32.5 million in February 2019.\n\nTwo months later, Preferred Bank flipped the properties to a firm called Continuum Analytics for $38 million and also provided a $29 million loan on the properties. But the deed and loan were signed by Deba Shyam, who described her position as Cantor Group Member LLC\u2019s managing member. (Shyam was named in the lawsuit brought by Zions Bancorp.)\nIn late 2024, Shyam\u2019s Continuum Analytics found a buyer for the two buildings. Two Switzerland-based companies allegedly sought to purchase the Upper East Side pair for $24 million. The new sale was a 36 percent decrease from the price Continuum paid for the properties. The unknown Swiss buyers made a $1.2 million deposit and put the balance in escrow, but Continuum allegedly wanted out of the deal at the last minute.\nThe Switzerland companies filed a lawsuit in New York Supreme Court alleging Continuum failed to honor its purchase and sales agreements. The buyer also sought to appoint a receiver on the properties, alleging Continuum owes more than $460,000 in property taxes on the buildings. The lawsuit is still pending.\nPreferred Bank\nAt the heart of Western Alliance and Zions Bancorp\u2019s lawsuits is the allegation that the borrowers misled the banks about liens or security interests on collateral they believed secured their loans. In the event of a default, Western Alliance and Zions Bank presumed they were getting paid back first.\nBut Western Alliance\u2019s lawsuit alleges Cantor Group\u2019s fund hid other senior liens through bogus title policies. In many cases where Western Alliance presumed to have a senior lien, documents from title companies show the lienholder to be Preferred Bank \u2014\u00a0the lender on the New York properties.\nPreferred Bank, founded in 1991 to serve the Chinese American community in Southern California, was an active lender to Cantor Group. It had the first lien position on at least seven properties, according to Western Alliance\u2019s lawsuit. These include: 2522 South Grove Avenue in Ontario, California, and 28207 Newhall Ranch Road in Valencia, California, according to the lawsuit.\nWestern Alliance alleges the policies provided by Cantor had no reference to Preferred Bank\u2019s first position on the collateral.\nPreferred Bank did not return a request to comment.",

        "content": "A New York mall\u2019s\ncontinued distress\nhas spelled out bad news for investors.\nA loan tied to the Palisades Center mall in Rockland County, New York, has been settled, but with substantial losses to securities holders. Lower classes of the bonds were wiped out entirely, and first-priority investors also saw some of their investment vanish, according to Morningstar Credit. Occupancy and revenue at the mall had declined substantially since the loan\u2019s underwriting in 2016.\nPyramid Management Group developed the mall, located in West Nyack, New York, in the late 1990s. In 2016, the firm secured a $388.5 million refinancing against the property. That was just a fraction of the mall\u2019s value, then estimated at $881 million, according to Morningstar.\nThe loan was securitized and sold to investors. But the mall couldn\u2019t keep up its performance. JCPenney and Lord &amp; Taylor closed their locations there in 2017 and 2019, respectively. Those anchor spaces have never been filled.\nRevenue dipped precipitously during the pandemic and then failed to fully recover. The mall pulled in more than $80.4 million in 2016, but that fell to $61.8 million in 2022, according to Morningstar. Occupancy fell from 100 percent to 78 percent that same year, as the loan was transferred to special servicing for maturity and monetary default. Expenses, once 40 percent of revenue, rose to 60 percent by 2023.\nThe most recent data, from 2024, shows revenue has fallen more than 30 percent, to less than $56 million. At the time, the mall did not have enough revenue to cover its debt service. Current tenants in the four-story, 1.9 million-square-foot property include Home Depot, Target, BJ\u2019s Wholesale, AMC and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods.\n\nThe mall was most recently appraised at $191 million, a loss of 78 percent of its value, according to Morningstar.\nThe servicer\nfiled for foreclosure\nand was granted a receiver and summary judgment in the case.\nThe loan was resolved this month, after taking a $231.4 million loss. Class B, C and D bondholders were entirely wiped out. Class A lost about 32 percent of its value, to the tune of $72 million.\nPyramid Management Group has had a difficult year, beyond the Palisades Center. The company has\nlost two other malls to foreclosure\nin roughly one year: the Aviation Mall in Queensbury, New York and the Hampshire Mall in \u200b\u200bHadley, Massachusetts, according to\nreporting\nfrom Syracuse.com.\nPyramid Management Group did not immediately respond to a request to comment for this story.\n",

        "content": "Prosper Group is partnering with a Belgian developer on a planned $650 million luxury condo tower along the Miami River in Brickell,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nVersluys Group, led by CEO Bart Versluys and COO Peter De Decker, is a joint venture partner with Miami Beach-based Prosper Group, led by Jay Roberts, on the development of the waterfront assemblage at 99 Southwest Seventh Street, 66 Southwest Sixth Street and 625 Southwest First Avenue in Miami, the partners said.\nThe partners plan a 60-story, 158-unit branded high-rise with more than 300 feet of river frontage. The project will mark Versluys\u2019 first U.S. development, De Decker said. Construction will take about 30 months and the building is expected to be completed in 2028, according to a press release.\nThe joint venture is under contract to acquire the development site next spring for an undisclosed price, Roberts said. Sales are expected to launch in the third quarter. Roberts said he was introduced to Versluys through a mutual connection.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of appetite from European investors, and capital looking for opportunities outside of Europe and into South Florida,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cRegulations in Europe are hurting development and growth.\u201d\nDe Decker said the firm has always been interested in investing in Miami.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the high-end residential market in Belgium, Holland. We have a lot of deals in the top 1 percent of the market,\u201d De Decker said. \u201cIf we want to expand, we must look at other markets. We were looking at London, Singapore, Dubai.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Harvey Hernandez\u2019s Newgard Development Group and Two Roads Development\ninked a contract\nto sell a portion of the site to Prosper. It was part of the developers\u2019 three-tower assemblage site, where they are\ncurrently building\nLofty Brickell and the Standard Residences.\nDevelopers have been increasingly joint venturing on new high-rise projects, driven by rising costs.\nThe Prosper-Versluys project is expected to include about 35,000 square feet of food and beverage retail space. The developers declined to name the brand, but plan to announce that at a later date.\nProsper\u2019s portfolio includes more than 1,300 residential units planned or under construction in Tampa and South Florida, according to the release.\nEarlier this year, Prosper and its partner Forte Development\nsubmitted plans\nfor an 80-story mixed-use condo tower also in Brickell, at\n1040 South Miami Avenue\n. Their application was filed under Miami-Dade County\u2019s rapid transit zoning, which can provide developers with additional density. The site is about a block away from the Brickell Metromover station.\n",

        "content": "Millionaire Stephen Cloobeck, who is running for governor of California as a Democrat, knows that throwing money at a challenge doesn\u2019t always work.\nThe time-share entrepreneur saw the 2020 end of his five-month relationship with girlfriend Stefanie Gurzanski get ugly, litigious and public. Cloobeck, 58 when he met the OnlyFans model and Instagram influencer, spent over $1 million on Gurzanski, throwing her a\n$130,000 party\nfor her 26th birthday, buying her a $200,000 Richard Mille watch, and prepaying her annual rent on a luxurious Beverly Hills apartment. He claimed he didn\u2019t know she was shooting porn on his property and posting it on OnlyFans, and said he broke up with her when he found out.\nBut when it comes to his business acumen and wealth \u2014 which Inside Edition put at\naround $100 million\nin 2021 \u2014 Cloobeck is far more successful.\nAnd he\u2019s willing to throw some big money at the long-shot challenge of becoming California\u2019s next governor.\nThe former CEO of Diamond Resorts has\nthe most money in his coffers\namong all 2026 California gubernatorial contenders, raking in $13.6 million via 172 contributions, according to\nCalifornia Secretary of State records\n.\nGranted, he contributed $13 million of the total, but he got some contributions from real estate executives, including $72,800 from\nWilliam Meldman, chairman of Discover Land Company, a Scottsdale, Arizona-headquartered real estate developer and operator of private residential communities and resorts. Cloobeck reeled in another $20,500 from five Discovery Land Company employees.\nCloobeck, who turns 64 on Sunday, also received $51,400 from family-owned real estate investment firm Randall Realty Group, led by\nJames Randall\n, the airplane rivet king-turned-philanthropist, and $36,400 from Jim Murren, former CEO of MGM Resorts International. Residential agent Josh Altman, co-founder of The Altman Brothers at Douglas Elliman, who shot to fame on \u201cMillion Dollar Listing Los Angeles,\u201d shelled out $1,500.\nBeyond real estate, actress and comedian Tiffany Haddish supported Cloobeck with a $2,500 donation, director Brett Ratner gave $1,000 and actor and comedian Tom Arnold contributed $500.\nThe first-time political candidate, who once considered a run for governor of Nevada, announced his bid for California\u2019s top elected office about a year ago but only recently garnered attention atop the money list among candidates.\nHis slogan is \u201cCalifornia, Get a Cloo.\u201d (He is giving away\nmerchandise\n.)\nHe is one of many candidates competing to succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is term-limited and ineligible for reelection in 2026.\nHow he got here\nCloobeck, who started out as a busboy in a small California restaurant, built his first shopping center in the 1980s in Burbank, California, and others in Bakersfield, Hanford, Hemet, Buena Park and Mission Viejo. He built his first hotel, the Polo Towers, on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nHe founded Las Vegas-based Diamond Resorts International in 1992. The company\nacquired\nthe publicly traded Sunterra Corporation in 2007 for $700 million, helping Diamond Resorts to become the second-largest vacation ownership company.\nBy 2016, Diamond Resorts had a network of more than 420 vacation destinations in 35 countries. Cloobeck sold Diamond Resorts to private equity firm Apollo Global Management in a 2016 deal expected to total $2.2 billion.\nCloobeck was named Nevada Athletic Commission chairman for a two-year term in June 2021. He\nresigned\nin late 2022, saying he would not be able to work with Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican who took office in early 2023.\nThe matter seemed more personal than ideological.\n\u201cHe is not honest nor grateful for the great benefits I\u2019ve given to the State of Nevada,\u201d Cloobeck said at the time.\nAs chairman of the Athletic Commission, Cloobeck pressed for the cause of death in the case of Nathan Valencia, 20, who collapsed in the ring after a University of Nevada-Las Vegas fraternity-sponsored boxing match. Cloobeck successfully pushed the commission to pass \u201cNathan\u2019s Law\u201d which requires trained referees and on-site medical personnel at amateur boxing events \u2014 but noted in his resignation that then Clark County Sheriff Lombardo did nothing to help his effort.\nOther past appointments were serving as the inaugural chairman of the board of Brand USA Inc., a United States government-formed nonprofit corporation to promote travel to the U.S.; and a member on Nevada\u2019s Standing Committee on Judicial Ethics and Election Practices, a board that attempts to settle ethical disputes that may arise over the course of campaigns for judicial office.\nA native of the Encino district in the San Fernando Valley, Cloobeck received a degree in bio-psychology from Brandeis University in 1983. He lives in a Beverly Hills mansion. Twice divorced, Cloobeck has three grown children. After his father went bankrupt, Cloobeck supported him until he passed away, per Vanity Fair.\n\u201cThe internet says I\u2019m only worth $100 million, which is just fine with me,\u201d he told\nVanity Fair\nin 2021. \u201cMy house in Beverly Hills is worth $100 million, and I own a $45 million home for cash in Cabo, and I own my own jet. You can do the math yourself.\u201d\nCloobeck appeared on several episodes of the reality-television show \u201cUndercover Boss,\u201d working low-level jobs at Diamond Resorts International to see a different side of the business.\nIn June, the candidate released his second book, \u201cFacing Hard Truths: How Americans Can Get Real, Pull Together, and Turn Our Country Around.\u201d The book covers topics including immigration, crime and the cost of living. His first book, \u201cChecking In: Hospitality-Driven Thinking, Business, and You,\u201d came out in October 2018.\n",

        "content": "A shuttered Skokie school property could soon be redeveloped by a firm with a heavy presence in Chicago\u2019s Fulton Market into a new 68-unit townhome community.\nSkokie\u2019s Plan Commission gave the project its blessing last week under new developer\nFulton Street Companies\n, helmed by Ross Babel and Alex Najem.\nThe local body voted unanimously to recommend approval of the developer\u2019s proposal to build three-story rental townhomes at 4600 Main Street, near Kilpatrick Avenue, the North Shore Record\nreported\n. The 3.9-acre parcel, formerly home to Arie Crown Hebrew Day School, has sat empty since the school consolidated operations at its Gross Point Road campus in April, said board member Brian Levinson.\nThe\nChicago-based\ndeveloper plans 24 two-bedroom and 44 three-bedroom units, each with a two-car garage, plus a total of 158 parking spaces. The project mirrors an earlier plan approved in 2024 for the same site by developer Luz and Associates, which later folded before breaking ground, according to Skokie planning manager Kate Portillo.\nIf approved by the Village Board, which will take up the matter at a future meeting, Fulton Street would buy the property from Arie Crown and move forward with construction.\nThis is the first project Fulton Street picked up outside of Chicago proper, said Babel, a founder and managing principal at Fulton Street. Babel told\nThe Real Deal\nthat closing on the land sale still needs to go through for the project to proceed.\nUnder\nSkokie\u2019s\nInclusionary Housing Ordinance, adopted in May, the developer would normally be required to reserve 5 percent of units \u2014 four in this case \u2014 for affordable housing. Instead, Fulton Street has opted to pay a $450,000 \u201cfee in lieu\u201d to the village, an alternative allowed under the law.\nThat exemption drew pushback from residents during Thursday\u2019s meeting.\n\n\u201cFour hundred thousand dollars is chump change,\u201d said resident Emi Yamauchi, arguing the townhomes fail to expand affordable housing options.\nAnother neighbor, Thomas Whitaker, objected to the project\u2019s density and height, saying it would \u201coverlook two-story homes\u201d and clash with the character of the area. Babel said the only consideration on the fee in lieu of affordable housing units was to mirror the Luz and Associates approval.\n\u201cThis was a deal the village has already seen and was already approved before, so all we\u2019re doing is following in the footsteps of what\u2019s been done and approved before,\u201d Babel said.\nLevinson, who also serves on the village\u2019s Economic Development Commission, countered that the project would help revive Main Street and expand the local tax base.\n\u201cAll of us would love an open park, but the positives this will bring for the greater village far outweigh the negatives,\u201d he said.\nVillage staff also endorsed the plan, citing infrastructure improvements that would boost water pressure and free up nearby street parking. A traffic analysis found the residential project would generate fewer daily trips than the former school use.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A cornerstone of Houston\u2019s modern real estate scene has died.\nDan Moody Jr., co-founder of\nMoody Rambin\n, died Oct. 10 while on vacation in Woodstock, Vermont. He was 84. Moody\u2019s death was announced in an obituary that said he passed peacefully of undisclosed causes. The Houston native spent more than five decades building and reshaping the city\u2019s commercial landscape through his firm, which he founded in 1969 with partner Joseph Rambin III.\nRambin\ndied in 2024 at 79, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe two launched their eponymous company with a focus on zero lot-line residential townhomes before pivoting to the office sector, where they left a distinct architectural mark. Through the 1980s and 1990s, the firm delivered a string of signature business parks \u2014 including\nPost Oak Park\n, Town &amp; Country Office Park, Dairy Ashford Place and Northwest Park \u2014 known for their airy atriums and energy-efficient designs, features that helped redefine the look and feel of Houston\u2019s corporate corridors.\nIn the 1990s, Moody Rambin took on a more personal project: redeveloping\nTown &amp; Country Village\n, a 400,000-square-foot retail center originally built by Moody\u2019s father in the late 1960s. The property remains under Moody Rambin\u2019s ownership and management, a rare feat in a city known for its churn-and-burn development cycles.\n\nMoody\u2019s son, Dan Moody III, joined the company during that same decade, helping expand its portfolio into industrial, retail and multifamily projects. Under the younger Moody\u2019s leadership, the firm has grown to more than 100 employees and remains a mainstay in Houston\u2019s development and management circles.\nA graduate of Lamar High School and the University of Texas, Moody was remembered as a civic-minded developer with deep Houston roots. He was a founding member of Scenic Houston, a nonprofit focused on urban beautification, and contributed to the Methodist Hospital Foundation, the Brookwood Community and the Houston Parks Board.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The sites are 150 East 79th Street, 152 East 79th Street, 154 East 79th Street, 1135 Lexington Avenue and 1131 Lexington Avenue, according to a\nrelease\non the acquisition.\nGregg Winter\u2019s W Financial was the seller of the real estate. The sale of a sixth parcel, at 1133 Lexington Avenue, is expected to close in June, bringing the acquisition cost of the 100,000-square-foot assemblage to $76 million.\nWith a half-dozen sites in hand, Xin plans to pursue her first ground-up development in the city. She\u2019s planning a luxury condominium building with ground-floor retail, projecting demolition to begin in the first quarter of next year.\n\u201cOur thesis is to develop boutique-sized, luxury condos in historic districts across New York City like the Upper East Side, West Village, Chelsea and more,\u201d Xin said in an interview.\nW Financial acquired the assemblage\nthrough a foreclosure sale\nin February 2023 after HFZ defaulted on a $43.6 million loan. The site offers 71,500 square feet of buildable space.\n\nThe Don Filippo pizza restaurant next door, which has served up neighborhood slices for decades, initially agreed to sell to Macklowe Properties, but the agreement was canceled in December 2022. Its presence was once seen as a possible impediment to development, along with\na First Republic Bank branch\nthat closed after the business was sold to JPMorgan Chase.\nLast year, Xin acquired a townhouse at 45 East 74th Street from Italian developer Valerio Morabito, who absorbed\na rare loss\nin the Upper East Side market.\nShe\u2019s developed more than 54 million square feet across Beijing and Shanghai during her prolific property development career. She and her husband stepped down from Soho China in 2022 \u2014 a year after a scuttled takeover attempt by Blackstone \u2014 but she remains on the company board.\nInvestments in the United States have included the GM Building and Park Avenue Plaza in Manhattan, as well as the Lyrik in Boston. Xin\u2019s family office plans to own, operate and develop in those two cities.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The Lake Geneva luxury market just surpassed last year\u2019s record of homes sold for more than\n$8 million\n.\nA newly-built mansion at 837 Bayview Drive sold Oct. 21 for nearly $8.58 million, after spending just 11 days on the market before going under contract last month. It fetched about 1 percent above its $8.5 million asking price, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The 7,478-square-foot home sold for almost $1,147 per square foot.\nListed Sept. 13 as a \u201ccoming soon\u201d offering, the five-bedroom home quickly drew multiple bids and was under contract by Sept. 24. The deal closed for $80,000 over ask, a clear sign of the competition for\nscarce waterfront listings\n. Agents declined to confirm whether it was a cash deal, though the closing timeframe suggests that\u2019s possible.\nThe home sits on less than half an acre about a mile-and-a-half from downtown\nLake Geneva\n, with 102 feet of lake frontage and two private piers. Built in 2018, the three-level property includes a main-floor primary suite and water views from nearly every room, according to the listing.\nCompass agent Jay Hicks, who represented the buyers, said his clients had been searching for six months to a year before seizing the opportunity. Hicks told the outlet the buyers jumped on the listing. The sellers, represented by @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate agent Gina Nocek, fielded two offers in two days.\n\nThe Bayview sale marks the fifth Lake Geneva property this year to close at\n$8 million\nor more, already surpassing last year\u2019s four, with two more high-end homes under contract. Lakefront listings remain rare, and affluent Chicago buyers continue to treat the resort town about 85 miles northwest of the Loop as their pandemic-era refuge-turned-permanent playground.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a fall sales season like this in a long time,\u201d Nocek told the outlet.\nAt least two additional Lake Geneva properties priced at $8.69 million and $9.8 million are set to close in the next two weeks, both snapped up within days of listing. Whether they\u2019ll join Bayview in closing above the ask remains to be seen.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The artificial intelligence boom is driving a major transformation in San Francisco\u2019s Mission Bay, with Alexandria Real Estate Equities seeking city approval to convert 518,000 square feet of lab space into offices to accommodate growing demand from AI firms.\nThe proposal will go before the city\u2019s Planning Commission Thursday, the\nSan Francisco Business Times reported\n. It involves four properties: 455 Mission Bay Boulevard South, 1450 Owens Street, 1500 Owens Street and 1700 Owens Street.\nMission Bay, once a dormant railyard area, has become the city\u2019s fastest-rebounding office market. Availability of space has dropped 46 percent over the past two years, fueled by AI-driven leasing activity. OpenAI is reportedly finalizing a lease for about 150,000 square feet at 455 Mission Bay, reinforcing the properties\u2019 appeal to tech firms.\nThe AI firm run by CEO Sam Altman has\nnumerous office addresses\nin the Mission Bay neighborhood.\nAlexandria\u2019s Mission Bay Life Sciences and Technology District was originally approved in 2008 with more than 1 million square feet of office space. With nearly all of that now leased, the developer wants to exercise its right to request additional space under the city\u2019s cap, up to a total entitlement of 2.7 million square feet.\n\nThe current request represents a reallocation of existing space rather than new construction.\nJoel Marcus, founder and executive chairman of Pasadena-based Alexandria, emphasized that AI tenants now play a critical role in shaping San Francisco\u2019s innovation economy. The Planning Department has preliminarily recommended approval of the lab-to-office conversion.\nCBRE Investment Management, in partnership with Alexandria, holds a 75 percent stake in five Mission Bay life science buildings, including the one at 455 Mission Bay. Alexandria retains minority ownership and operates the properties.\nThe AI sector in San Francisco is ramping up local office demand beyond Mission Bay, with such leasing\nexpected to accelerate\nin the coming months, the San Francisco Business Times reported in late September.\n\u2014\nJoel Russell\n",

        "content": "Houston condos might be suffering\n, but agents aren\u2019t worried about the luxury tier.\nThe median price of a Houston condo fell 21 percent year over year in September, according to CoStar. The city overall is in a buyer\u2019s market, sharing with Dallas the stark distinction of having the largest percentage of\ndiscounted sales in the country in August\n.\nThose trends seem to be concentrated in the lower tiers of the market, leaving a wave of\nnew luxury condo developments\nin the Houston metro untroubled so far. Agents are working to fill residences under the\nRitz-Carlton, Auberge and St. Regis brands\n. Despite weakening conditions for the overall market, they say demand for high-end condos remains strong.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a big separation in Houston between aging inventory and new luxury product,\u201d said Catherine Lee, president of new development for Douglas Elliman. \u201cIf anything, luxury has gone the other direction over the past year.\u201d\nThe lower tier seems to be running opposite, thanks in part to Houston having\nmore homes for sale than any other city in America\n. The market\u2019s single-family inventory has been setting records this year, and some residents in older, lower-tier condos are seeing the appeal of cheap houses in the suburbs, according to Martha Turney Sotheby\u2019s International Real Estate agent Rosie Meyers.\n\n\u201cIf you take an old building that\u2019s got lots of problems, then yes, just like\nMiami\n, you\u2019re going to have a lot of depreciation right now because there\u2019s work to be done,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cOur overall high-rise market is very strong because there\u2019s no supply in Houston. I don\u2019t see it devaluating this year in high-rises.\u201d\nLuxury residences like the St. Regis probably aren\u2019t competing for buyers who might see condos as a rung on the ladder to the suburbs. Branded developments are banking on a particular demographic \u2014 generally older, downsizing couples, according to Lee.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more locals being open to getting into condo living,\u201d said Adriana Banks, a Douglas Elliman agent selling the St. Regis Residences.\nLuxury condo developments also tend to offer significant points of difference thanks to more varied floor plans. That keeps them out of the sort of pricing competition that hits low- and mid-tier buildings, according to Douglas Elliman agent Misty Meredith, who\u2019s selling the Mondrian and the Sophie.\n\u201cI think part of that is the life cycle of aging inventory here in Houston. There\u2019s just not new product in that price point being built,\u201d Lee said of cheaper condos. \u201cAnd so you are starting to see some of those challenges with buildings that are greater than 15 years old.\u201d\n",

FiServ has invested more than $65 million into its space and plans future upgrades, the memo noted.\nRockwood and its partner, Joe Cayre\u2019s Midtown Equities, bought the building in 2018 for $140 million and then gut-renovated it, redesigning the lobby and building systems and installing amenities like a fitness center and roof deck with views of the harbor.\nThe property has 10 years of average lease term with more than $180 million of contractual revenue and net operating income of nearly $13 million. With those figures, the deal would work out to a capitalization rate around 7 percent.\nA representative for Rockwood declined to comment.\n\nA Newmark team led by Adam Spies and Marcella Fasulo is overseeing the sales process.\nThis is at least the third property Rockwood\u2019s recently put up for sale.\nLast week, the company, alongside partner the Dermot Company, listed their Lower East Side rental building at 250 East Houston Street, eyeing a price of $115 million. And in June, Rockwood listed its office building at 2 Grand Central Tower, seeking\n$270 million\n.\nRockwood last week announced that it would integrate its operations into Harrison Street Asset Management; the two companies are subsidiaries of Colliers International.\nRockwood managing partners Tyson Skillings and David Becker are remaining in place to oversee their firm\u2019s existing investments and will work on new initiatives as co-chief strategy officers of HSAM.\n",

Turns out, there\u2019s billions of reasons to not even consider it.\nThe capital gains taxes that would come with the sale of the franchise are big, the Miami Herald\nreported\n. It\u2019s possible such a bill could\u2019ve played a role in previous failed efforts to sell stakes in the team.\nRoss\n, chairman and CEO of West Palm Beach-based Related Ross, has been the majority owner of the franchise since 2009, but has been selling off bits and pieces in recent years, bringing his stake down to 84.5 percent. In one hypothetical scenario, a $10 billion sale of his share in the team and the Hard Rock Stadium property could result in a bill for Ross totaling more than $1 billion in capital gains taxes.\nLast year, Ross selling off 13 percent of the team to private equity firm Ares and Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai likely resulted in more than $150 million in capital gains taxes.\nHis family could avoid the capital gains tax if they sold the team after Ross dies, due to special consideration by the Internal Revenue Service. But that could instead trigger an estate tax of more than $2.5 billion, which would likely need to be paid within nine months of his death, the Herald reported.\n\nRoss first invested in the Dolphins in 2008. He acquired 95 percent of the franchise for $1 billion and invested more than $700 million into renovating the Miami Gardens stadium home to the Dolphins. He has subsequently signed deals that brought\nF1\n, the Miami Open tennis tournament, and the FIFA World Cup games next year.\nCitadel\u2019s billionaire founder Ken Griffin reportedly made\nmultiple attempts\nto wrestle the Dolphins from Ross, only for talks to dissipate. In the last two years, an unnamed buyer also made a $10 billion bid for the team, without success.\nMeanwhile, Ross seems content to keep the team in the family. Three years ago, he elevated his daughter, Jennifer, to\nbe his successor\nwith the Dolphins.\nRelated Companies president Bruce Beal was previously considered for the role, but was passed over around the time the NFL punished Ross and Beal\nfor violating the league\u2019s anti-tampering policies\nin their efforts to recruit then-Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady and then-New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

There are still three floors there that remained available until earlier this year, when CoStar data showed they were pulled from the market in February.\nIndeed\u2019s shifting office strategy is indicative of broader challenges facing Austin\u2019s once red-hot office market. A flood of new deliveries and persistent hybrid work policies have fueled record sublease supply. Indeed\u2019s retrenchment also follows a wave of tech cutbacks and real estate right-sizing across the\ntech sector\n, from\nMeta\u2019s\nAustin exits to\nGoogle\u2019s\nspace consolidations in other major markets.\nIndeed vice president of real estate, David Rudick said last year that the company\u2019s two major Austin hubs \u2014 downtown and the Domain \u2014 were meant to give workers location flexibility and ease commutes. That dual-hub strategy remains intact for the time being.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

AshBritt contracts with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for disaster response services in 25 states, including all hurricane states. It worked on the relief efforts for Hurricanes Katrina, Sandy and Irma, and has received lucrative contracts for fire cleanup in California, according to\nCalMatters\n. In 2021, Randy Perkins paid the Federal Election Commission a $125,000 penalty after AshBritt donated $500,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC, according to\nForbes\n.

The private, for-profit institution, long known for its bold signage and expansive downtown footprint, is listing 10 buildings totaling nearly 375,000 square feet for approximately $130 million. These properties span key neighborhoods including Van Ness Corridor, North Beach, Nob Hill, Civic Center, and Union Square, and include historic landmarks like St. Brigid Church and a 138,000-square-foot office at 150 Hayes Street.\nThis move follows earlier sales of a student dorm at 825 Sutter Street and a Bayview warehouse, reflecting a broader downsizing trend. The university, founded in 1929 by the Stephens family, has been led by President Elisa Stephens since the early 1990s. Under her leadership, the Academy grew rapidly, doubling its property holdings between 1994 and 1998. However, the rise of remote learning and declining on-campus demand have prompted a strategic consolidation.\nThe university cited changing student needs and the growth of hybrid education as key drivers behind the sale. It also recently announced the end of its intercollegiate sports program. Despite the downsizing, the Academy plans to maintain a strong presence in San Francisco.\nThe school\u2019s expansion has not been without controversy. It faced a $60 million settlement in 2016 over zoning violations and unpermitted building conversions, and critics have long accused it of operating in a legal gray area. Additionally, the Academy settled a fraud lawsuit in 2021 and is currently under review by the WASC Senior College and University Commission for issues related to student success metrics and graduation rates. A follow-up accreditation visit is scheduled for this fall. The university remains confident in its compliance and future accreditation status.\n",

The buildings, at 619 and 701 Ocean Front Walk, were once home to Snapchat when the social media company was headquartered in the Silicon Beach neighborhood.\nThe roughly 45,000-square-foot property, which encompasses 10 beachfront live-work lofts (with outdoor patios and balconies, plus private rooftops) and ground-floor retail, was purchased by a company connected to Stefan Ashkenazy \u2014 who owns the Petit Ermitage hotel in West Hollywood. A BrightSpire Capital subsidiary provided a $27 million loan, according to documents signed by Ashkenazy.\nThe seller was a company linked to DLJ Real Estate Capital Partners. A firm managing director, Timan Khoubian, signed the deed. DLJ Real Estate Capital Partners purchased the property, also called Thornton Lofts, for $40.5 million in 2014. None of the parties involved responded to a request for comment.\n\nSnapchat\u2019s parent company, now headquartered in Santa Monica at 3000 31st Street, was housed in a blue beachfront bungalow at 523 Ocean Front Walk on the Venice boardwalk before it expanded throughout the beach. The company, helmed by Evan Spiegel, eventually attempted to\nsublease\nmuch of its Venice office space when it made the move to Santa Monica, but struggled to fill the space. For years, the company\u2019s rise was synonymous with the funky beachside neighborhood and its becoming part of Silicon Beach.\nThe property was marketed as an opportunity for luxury apartment loft rentals, the sale of individual condominiums or a creative office campus, per a brochure. West Los Angeles offices have a 22 percent vacancy rate, according to a third-quarter CBRE report.\nIn other Silicon Beach trades, earlier this year, Google\u2019s Venice office campus, the binoculars-shaped building at 340 West Main Street, went up for\nsale\n. Clarion Partners\nrecently sold\nits 300,000-square-foot business center in Playa Vista, another Silicon Beach neighborhood, to Barings for about $151 million.\n",

If the debt is non-performing or becomes so, Madison Capital could acquire the building through foreclosure or a negotiated transfer.\nJuul purchased the 29-story, 387,000-square-foot office building in June 2019 for $397 million to accommodate its growing workforce. However, regulatory scrutiny over its vaping products led to a sharp decline in valuation and staff reductions.\nBy May 2020, Juul announced its headquarters move to Washington, D.C., and listed the San Francisco building for sale. Multiple sale attempts, including deals with PGIM and Pimco, collapsed in 2020. Madison Capital, which previously partnered with PGIM on a bid, may now engineer a second attempt to acquire the property, likely at a discount price from the pre-pandemic valuation of $1,100 per square foot, or a total of $400 million.\n\nAffinius, formerly Square Mile Capital, originated a $220 million loan for Juul\u2019s acquisition of 123 Mission Street and has since reduced its San Francisco holdings. It recently sold One Montgomery to Empire and partnered with Fortress Investment Group to acquire debt on 600 Battery Street.\nJuul\u2019s\nleasing efforts\nfor 123 Mission also faltered.\nIn 2021, Align Real Estate and Newmark marketed 266,000 square feet for lease, but no deal materialized. Juul reportedly still leases about 62,500 square feet, though current occupancy details remain unclear. The outcome of the debt sale could determine the future of the high-profile downtown asset amid ongoing market uncertainty.\n\u2014\nJoel Russell\n",

        "content": "Fort Worth\u2019s long-awaited plans for the latest redevelopment phase of Panther Island are beginning to take shape, beginning with a call for help to ramp up commercial activity now that the city has boosted densities with new zoning.\nThe Tarrant Regional Water District issued a request for qualifications seeking a private developer for the island just north of downtown, according to an Oct. 16 announcement. The district controls more than 30 acres of developable land and expects that figure to rise once the\nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers\ncompletes $443 million of work for\u00a0 bypass channel construction and removes existing levees over the next decade, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nMeanwhile, the\nFort Worth City Council\nmoved Tuesday to clear the way for new density, unanimously rezoning 15.4 acres between North Commerce Street and the future\nRing Road\nthat now requires building minimums of 5 stories and maximums of 15 stories, according to\ncity documents\n. Last year, the council raised height limits to 20 stories along parts of North Main Street.\nThe new effort comes as TRWD prepares to begin work on the next section of the island\u2019s canal network, with a goal of creating a \u201cdistinctive waterfront experience.\u201d The $50 million phase \u2014 encompassing canals, paseos and park improvements across six acres \u2014 is slated to break ground in mid-2026. Developers must submit their interest by Nov. 7, with applications due Nov. 26. Susan Alanis, the district\u2019s Panther Island program director, told the outlet that a partner could be selected in spring of 2026.\n\n\u201cThe community has been waiting on this for a long time, and it\u2019s going to be a unique waterfront, trail-connected neighborhood\u2026 neatly between the Stockyards, the Cultural District and downtown,\u201d Alanis said.\nTarrant County College is preparing to list the historic\nTXU power plant\nit owns on the island for sale,\naccording\nto the Fort Worth Report. The eight-acre site \u2014 dominated by a 100-year-old brick structure that looms over drivers crossing the Trinity River \u2014 is expected to hit the market Oct. 23, with bids due Nov. 20. Preservationists have voiced concern, but the property could become a high-profile redevelopment at the island\u2019s southern edge, potentially reusing the landmark structure.\nPanther Island\u2019s last major addition was the 300-unit Encore apartments in 2018.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Eli Karp\u2019s troubled Flatbush development site has gone back to its lender in a credit bid.\nMadison Realty Capital\ntook over the property at 1580 Nostrand Avenue with a $70 million credit bid, according to property records. Karp once planned a sprawling two-building development called\nHello Nostrand\non the site.\nBut Karp only finished one of the buildings \u2014 a 93-unit rental building at 21 East 29th Street. It was auctioned in June, along with the undeveloped Nostrand Avenue property, according to a deed filed with the city.\nThe property had been mired in litigation for years. Karp\u2019s Hello Living bought the site for $13 million in 2014 with plans to build a luxury apartment complex. But as soon as construction started, he ran into trouble with lenders.\nKarp put the property into\nbankruptcy\nin 2021, one day before senior lender\nMadison Realty Capital\ncould initiate a UCC foreclosure process. Madison then sold the $6 million mezzanine loan and $73 million senior loan on the property to another firm, Arch Companies, which then sued Karp to initiate another foreclosure on the property.\n\nIn that suit, Arch alleged the project\u2019s ownership entity improperly entered into a master lease with a tenant that would defer rent payments for months and could disqualify the property from the 421a tax break.\nThen Arch ran into\ntrouble of its own\n, and Karp agreed to the bankruptcy sale. Madison later took back over the senior loan.\nKarp was once a promising developer who bet on building luxury rental apartments in less gentrified Brooklyn neighborhoods. All of his projects had \u201cHello\u201d in their names and stood out for their sleek designs, which appeared out of character next to neighboring buildings.\nAnother Karp property at 2417 Albemarle Road\nwas auctioned\nlast year and went to the lender in a credit bid.\n",

        "pub_date_dt": "2025-10-23T11:30:00",
        "content": "ICYMI, sidewalk sheds are top of mind for Zohran Mamdani.\nBlessedly, the Democratic nominee has not (yet?) introduced his own shed wordplay (however, in a video posted to social media, he did adopt Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine\u2019s call to action, \u201cShed the Shed\u201d).\nBut this week, he rolled out a few proposals to put his own stamp on the issue.\nHis proposals include removing any shed that has sat on a city property for more than three years. To do this, he says he will prioritize funding for the repairs necessary to remove the structures. He also wants to invest in preventative maintenance to ensure that fewer sheds are needed.\nIt is unclear how much all of that would cost, but the\nNew York Post reported\nin March that sheds at 130 city-owned properties had been up for more than three years.\nMamdani also wants to double the amount of time between required fa\u00e7ade inspections for newer buildings. Such inspections take place every five years; he wants inspections at newer buildings to take place every 10 years.\nIf this reform sounds familiar, it is because the City Council made a similar change this year, as part of a\npackage of bills\naimed at clearing city streets of long-standing sheds. The law required the Department of Buildings to study \u201cthe appropriate time period\u201d for such inspections and to recommend a new inspection schedule that shifts the interval from every five years to between six and 12 years. Though the inspection timeline would likely differ depending on building materials and other factors, the law indicated that new buildings should have their first fa\u00e7ade inspection eight years after being built, rather than five.\nThe law gave DOB until the end of December 2025 to provide these recommendations to the City Council. (Notably, if the 10-year rule for new buildings were in place a decade ago,\n432 Park Avenue\nwould be coming up on its first required inspection this December.) A DOB spokesperson indicated that the agency is on track to meet that deadline.\nMamdani also indicated this week that he wants to implement \u201cnew safer, brighter scaffolding design standards.\u201d\nAs part of that\nbill package\napproved in March, the City Council expanded the permitted color palette for these sheds, but not by much. Instead of just hunter green, the sheds can now be metallic gray, white or \u201ca color matching the fa\u00e7ade, trim, cornice, or roof of the building.\u201d The\nlaw\nthat allowed more color also required the DOB to study if changes could be made to shed design to \u201cimprove the pedestrian experience, including designs that are unobtrusive and aesthetically pleasing, without diminishing the safety of such sidewalk shed.\u201d\nThat study was due at the end of September. A spokesperson for the DOB said the agency expects to release upgraded designs soon.\nInterestingly, Mamdani\u2019s announcement didn\u2019t put much emphasis on ramping up fines or enforcement against property owners with long-term sheds, though he did indicate that he would \u201caggressively pursue enforcement.\u201d On social media, Mamdani said the Adams administration barely put the City Council\u2019s bills to use.\u00a0(One law that creates new penalties for owners who do not move forward with repairs in a timely manner, does not go into effect until next year.)\n\nSince the administration launched its \u201cGet Sheds Down\u201d initiative in 2023, 14,593 sheds have been removed from city streets, according to the DOB. Of course, new sheds have also popped up in that time, meaning that the city has seen a net drop of 818 sheds on city streets compared to July 2023.\nFor his part, Mayor Eric Adams appeared unimpressed by Mamdani\u2019s proposals. He reposted Mamdani\u2019s sidewalk shed announcement on X, adding: \u201c\u2018Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, that mediocrity can pay to greatness.\u2019\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Did you watch the second mayoral debate? Send me your reactions at\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nSix groups have joined Yes on Affordable Housing, a coalition that supports the housing-related ballot questions. Asian Americans for Equality, SAGE, Lambda Independent Democrats, Chinatown Partnership, Center for an Urban Future and Eleanor Roosevelt Independent Democrats Club joined the coalition and endorsed the four land use-related ballot questions, the coalition announced this week.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 The scene of a federal raid in Chinatown was largely deserted on Wednesday,\nGothamist reports\n. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers on Tuesday descended on a stretch of Canal Street where vendors have long sold counterfeit merchandise on the sidewalk. Officials said the raid was \u201cfocused on criminal activity relating to selling counterfeit goods\u201d and resulted in the arrest of nine West African immigrants. Another four people were arrested for allegedly assaulting a law enforcement officer, and one person was arrested on charges of obstructing law enforcement by blocking a driveway.\n\u2014 Assembly member Deborah Glick on Wednesday announced that she will not run for re-election next year. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I could continue to dedicate 100 percent of my energy beyond next year,\u201d she said. Glick has represented parts of Lower Manhattan for 35 years.\n\u2014 Referencing a scene in the movie \u201cBraveheart\u201d where Mel Gibson\u2019s character is executed (sorry, spoiler, but come on), Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa said he would rather be impaled than quit the mayoral race and work for Andrew Cuomo,\nPolitico New York reports\n.\u00a0 \u201cIf all of a sudden the executioner would have stopped, and I was on that gurney, and [he] said, \u2018Hey, you can work for Mayor Andrew Cuomo,\u2019 I would say: \u2018Finish the job. Impale me.\u2019 That will never happen,\u201d Sliwa said during a radio interview on WABC.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was a sponsor condominium unit at 53 West 53rd Street in Midtown, developed by Pontiac Land Group and Hines. The buyer was Mansion in NY Corporation, which paid $5.6 million for the pad. The 2,500-square-foot unit, which has been on and off the market for a decade, has three bedrooms and three and a half baths. The unit\u2019s most recent asking price was $7.4 million. Douglas Elliman\u2019s Renee Micheli, Jade Chan, Frances Katzen and Michelle Griffith\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded in the Big Apple was for a 12-square-foot sign. Broadway producer John Gore\u2019s John Gore Organization dropped $12.2 million \u2014 over $1 million per square foot \u2014 to take over signage at the Brill building at 1619 Broadway in Times Square. Gore earlier this year paid nearly $29 million for six other condos at the historic property. The seller was Mack Real Estate Group.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$12 million\nfor a 3,700-square-foot condo at 720 West End Avenue on the Upper West Side. Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 56,662-square-foot, five-story high school building at 111-32 66 Road in Forest Hills. Michael Freedman of MDSzerbaty Associates Architecture filed the permit on behalf of the New York City School Construction Authority.\u2014\nMatthew Elo, Mary Diduch",

        "content": "With Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa heckling him on stage, Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani stuck to his refusal to take sides: \u201cI have not yet taken a position,\u201d he said.\nMamdani was referring to three controversial housing-related\nballot measures\n, which Cuomo supports and Sliwa opposes.\nDuring the second and final mayoral debate ahead of the general election on Wednesday, NY1\u2019s Errol Louis asked Mamdani directly about the measures, which would consolidate the city\u2019s land use process and weaken the City Council\u2019s power over certain affordable housing projects.\nMamdani repeated a response he had previously given, that he appreciates that voters will be able to consider these issues. The answer comes just a few days before early voting starts, when New Yorkers will begin flipping over their ballots and voting on these questions.\nHe also noted the importance of ensuring that ramping up construction creates \u201cgood jobs,\u201d likely a nod to concerns from the city\u2019s unions \u2014\u00a0including 32BJ SEIU and the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council, which\nendorsed\nMamdani after the primary \u2014\u00a0that the measures remove their leverage in rezoning negotiations.\nWhen pressed to state his position \u2014 Sliwa and Cuomo repeated, \u201cYes or no?\u201d and then Louis also asked for clarity \u2014 Mamdani said he has not yet taken one.\n\u201cOh, what a shocker,\u201d Cuomo said.\nThe most contentious of the housing ballot proposals seeks to, in some cases, remove City Council review of housing projects and create an appeals board to reverse the Council\u2019s rejection of rezonings that result in affordable housing.\nThe reference to the ballot measures came up after moderators asked the candidates how they plan to meet the city\u2019s needs for more housing.\nThe candidates largely answered with responses they\u2019ve previously provided. Mamdani said he would streamline the building process for the private sector, ramp up construction near mass transit and scale up the city\u2019s programs for subsidizing deeply affordable housing.\nCuomo said he would \u201credo\u201d the Department of Housing Preservation and Development and\u00a0 \u201cchange the entire organizational structure.\u201d He said \u201chundreds if not thousands\u201d of units of housing need to be built simultaneously by the public and private sectors, a less intense version of his\nprevious calls\nto initiate 500,000 affordable units across 300 sites at once \u2014\u00a0an idea that defies the realities of construction and financing capacity.\nMamdani and Cuomo traded barbs on their respective housing records. At one point, pushing back on Mamdani\u2019s comments that he must have \u201crun an incompetent government\u201d given the pace of housing construction when he was governor, Cuomo said the governor doesn\u2019t build housing but provides financing to the city. However, the state plays a significant role in housing policy, and also steers construction of housing on\nstate-owned sites\n.\n\nSliwa emphasized the opportunities to convert vacant office buildings into housing and confirmed that he believes local City Council members should have veto power over projects in their districts. He said the ballot questions were a gift from Mayor Eric Adams to the real estate industry.\n\u201cHe went wild taking care of his developer friends,\u201d Sliwa said. He also said that Cuomo was in the \u201cback pockets of the developers who wine, dined and pocket-lined\u201d him.\nMamdani\u2019s pledge to\nfreeze rents\nfor stabilized tenants came up early in the debate. Cuomo called the promise \u201cB.S.\u201d because annual rent increases are decided by the city\u2019s\nRent Guidelines Board\n, not the mayor.\n\u201cNothing is going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just more political blather.\u201d\n\u201cIf you want a candidate for mayor who tells you everything that he cannot do, then Andrew Cuomo should be your choice,\u201d Mamdani fired back.\nCuomo also noted that Mamdani cannot immediately appoint new members of the board, who serve between two- and four-year terms. In fact, Adams is\nreportedly\nconsidering replacing six members\u2019 whose terms have ended before he leaves office.\nIn the final debate before the general election, not much new was revealed about the candidates\u2019 positions on housing and real estate-related issues.\nAt one point, however, candidates were asked if they support a casino in the five boroughs. Sliwa said, only if supported by the local communities, and Mamdani said that while he has reservations about casinos, he recognizes that state law allows for up to three licenses to be awarded.\nCuomo said he has not reviewed the proposals, and said he \u201chad no part\u201d in bringing three casinos to the city. That\u2019s incorrect: He was\ngovernor\nwhen voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2013 to expand gambling in the state, and supported the change. Still, on Wednesday, he called the casinos \u201chighly problematic.\u201d\nSuch a comment puts him at odds with the construction unions that\nbacked\nhis campaign ahead of the June primary. While many major unions endorsed Mamdani after the primary, many construction unions have\nheld off\non announcing who they will support in the general election.\n",

        "content": "A newly built beachfront compound in Del Mar has set a record as the most expensive residential sale in San Diego County with a $50 million close.\nThe buyer is undisclosed, while the seller is a limited liability company linked to Sandra Naftzger, whose family has been prominent in cattle ranching across Arizona, California and Oregon for over a century, the\nWall Street Journal reported\n. The Nafzgers have held the Del Mar beach property for decades.\nInitially listed at $75 million in\nNovember 2024\n, the price was reduced to $59.5 million by this June. Even at the discounted rate, the property at 2920 Camino Del Mar remained the priciest single-family home on the market in Del Mar, a coastal enclave known for attracting high net worth residents, including the Bill Gates family.\nListing agent Rande Turner of Pacific Sotheby\u2019s International Realty described the transaction as \u201ca remarkable sale for San Diego coastal real estate.\u201d\nThe compound features a 4,500-square-foot main residence with five bedrooms and an open-air ping-pong pavilion by the pool. It also has two guesthouses and a private beach accessible via a gated entry. The development process spanned over a decade, involving extensive permitting and the construction of a new sea wall, according to the Journal.\n\nSandra Naftzger and her sister sold the N3 Cattle Company ranch near Oakland in 2022 for $68 million. That property covered 50,500 acres \u2014 larger than the city of San Francisco.\nThe previous record residential price for San Diego County was a $47 million mansion sale in La Jolla earlier this year. In the same neighborhood, billionaire Darwin Deason is currently asking $108 million for the Sandcastle, an ornate estate inspired by the French royal palace at Versailles.\nThe San Diego luxury home market, like the\nmarket\nto the north in Orange County, has experienced some jaw-dropping prices in recent years as money\nmoves south\nfrom Malibu.\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "After city leaders lost a summer-long legal skirmish to postpone Miami\u2019s November election to next year, the mayor\u2019s race and two city commission races are back on. Now, all eyes are on the battle royale to replace termed out incumbent mayor\nFrancis Suarez\n, in a fight featuring 13 contenders.\nSeven candidates are new faces to Miami\u2019s rough-and-tumble political scene and are not expected to make much noise. But the other six candidates represent a mix of Miami\u2019s longtime political dynasties and a recent wave of upstarts promising an end to the dysfunctional corruption that\u2019s permeated city hall in recent years.\nOn the real estate front, the sextet all preach about bringing more affordable and workforce apartments to a city that is among the most expensive rental markets in the nation. Given the wide open nature of the mayor\u2019s race, real estate bigwigs are hedging their bets \u2013 in some cases donating to more than one of the six establishment candidates. These candidates are Miami city commissioner\nJoe Carollo\n, ex-Miami city commissioner\nAlex Diaz de la Portilla\n, former Miami City Manager Emilio Gonzalez, Miami-Dade County commissioner Eileen Higgins, ex-Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez, and another former Miami city commissioner,\nKen Russell\n.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the top donors to each candidate, according to an analysis of campaign finance reports:\nThe $100K club\nDiaz de la Portilla can thank real estate investors\nDavid and Leila Centner\nfor helping fill the coffers of his political action committee, Proven Leadership for Miami-Dade County. In April, the Miami Beach power couple donated $100,000, representing nearly half of the committee\u2019s haul in the three months ended in June. The PAC reported zero contributions between July and September, the most recent campaign finance filing period.\nIn an email, David Centner declined comment.\nThe\nCentners\nplayed a key role in Diaz de la Portilla being removed from office two years ago when he was criminally charged with money laundering, bribery and other felonies. In 2023, state prosecutors alleged\nDiaz de la Portilla\n, then a city commissioner since 2019, steered a no-bid deal to give the Centners control of a city park where they planned to build a $10 million youth sports complex next to one of the couple\u2019s Centner Academy campuses. In exchange, Diaz de la Portilla\u2019s PAC allegedly received $245,000 in contributions from a Centner entity via their then-lobbyist, William Riley Jr., who was also criminally charged.\nLast year, authorities dropped the case against Diaz de la Portilla and Riley, citing \u201cunreliable\u201d witness testimony.\nRiley\n, a lawyer, has a pending lawsuit against the Centners alleging they let him take the fall. Meanwhile, the couple is suing the Miami Herald for defamation.\nAside from Diaz de la Portilla, Carollo is the only other mayoral candidate to score $100,000 or more from a single donor. A polarizing figure in Miami politics, Carollo served as Miami mayor from 1997 to 2001, and returned to city hall when he was elected city commissioner in 2017. In 2023, a federal jury slapped Carollo with a\n$63 million\njudgment after finding him guilty of violating the rights of Little Havana developers Bill Fuller and Martin Pinilla. Carollo allegedly mounted a code enforcement\u00a0 campaign against the duo\u2019s properties and businesses because they supported his political opponent in 2017.\nBut his tussle with Fuller and Pinilla hasn\u2019t given other developers pause. Entities controlled by JDS Development Group\u2019s Michael Stern donated a combined $125,000 to Carollo\u2019s Miami First political action committee. Stern\u2019s firm is developing a\nDolce &amp; Gabbana-branded condo-hotel\nin Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood. Stern did not respond to requests for comment.\nMiami First also received a combined $120,000 from entities managed by Nuri Dorra, who is co-developing Essence Miami, a multifamily project with 88 affordable and workforce housing apartments in Little Havana that received $5 million from a city bond program.\n\u201cWhen you are working as a commissioner you do good things and some things that people think are bad,\u201d Dorra told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cI believe Joe Carollo has done a lot of stuff that is very good for the community.\u201d\nDonors spreading out\n\nSome donors are financially supporting more than one candidate for mayor. For instance, David Martin\u2019s Coconut Grove-based\nTerra\nappears to favor Higgins, but also donated to Carollo\u2019s committee and a PAC backing Suarez.\nTo run for Miami mayor, Higgins is resigning her county commission seat less than a year after being reelected without opposition. Suarez, whose son is current Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, served as a county commissioner from 2011 to 2020. Before that, he was Miami\u2019s mayor from 1985 until 1993. He won a comeback bid in 1997, but his victory was overturned due to rampant voter fraud.\nEntities with the same address as Terra have contributed a combined $67,500 to Higgins\u2019 individual campaign account, as well as three political action committees supporting her candidacy, finance reports show.\nTerra entities also gave a combined $10,000 to Suarez\u2019s Community First PAC, and $2,500 to Carollo\u2019s Miami First committee. Terra did not respond to a request for comment.\nThree other Coconut Grove-based firms donating to more than one candidate are\nSwerdlow Group\n, the Related Group and 13th Floor Investments. Swerdlow affiliates donated $50,000 to Carollo\u2019s committee, as well as $10,000 to Ethical Leadership for Miami, a PAC backing Higgins.\nThrough four entities,\nRelated\ndonated a combined $50,000 to Higgins\u2019 committee, and another $10,000 to Community First, the PAC backing Suarez.\n13th Floor gave $25,000 to Carollo\u2019s PAC and $15,000 to Suarez\u2019s PAC.\n13th Floor\n\u2019s managing principal Arnaud Karsenti donated $2,500 to Higgins\u2019 PAC.\nRepresentatives for Swerdlow, Related and 13th Floor did not respond to requests for comment.\nOther donors to multiple candidates include affiliates of Craig Robins\u2019 Miami-based Dacra, New York-based Ashkenazy Acquisitions and Miami-based land use law firm Bercow Radell Fernandez Larkin &amp; Tapanes.\nThe Dacra affiliates donated a combined $10,000 to Carollo\u2019s PAC, and $5,000 to Higgins\u2019 PAC.\nBayside Marketplace\n, which is owned by Ashkenazy, gave $30,000 to Carollo\u2019s Miami First and $15,000 to Suarez\u2019s Community First. Bercow Radell donated $10,000 each to committees backing Carollo, Higgins and Suarez.\nRobins\nand Ashkenazy did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, Bercow Radell partner Melissa Tapanes Llahues addressed the law firm\u2019s contributions to Carollo and Higgins, but not Suarez.\n\u201cAs a Miami-based firm, we closely follow local elections and have supported incumbent officials running for higher office,\u201d Llahues said. \u201cIn addition to our contribution to Commissioner Carollo, we also supported Commissioner Eileen Higgins, recognizing her commitment to Miami\u2019s future.\u201d\nDonors to Gonzalez and Russell\nWhile most of Miami\u2019s real estate titans are lining up with Carollo, Higgins and Suarez, a few have thrown their financial support behind Gonzalez and Russell. Gonzalez is a former city manager who testified against Carollo in the civil case brought by\nFuller and Pinilla\n. Gonzalez also successfully sued the city of Miami to hold the election this year, alleging city leaders violated the city charter. Russell is a former Miami city commissioner who resigned before his second term was completed so he could run unsuccessfully for Congress.\nSix entities tied to Fuller and Pinilla donated a combined $20,000 to Gonzalez\u2019s Mission Miami PAC, while Miami-based\nCMC Group\n, led by Ugo Columbo, gave $10,000 to Russell\u2019s committee, Breaking the Wheel.",

        "content": "Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s plan to declare a record $1 billion tax-increment financing surplus to help cover a new Chicago Public Schools contract set off a rare wave of unified opposition at City Hall this week, with aldermen warning that the move would gut neighborhood development projects across the city.\nThe proposal \u2014 a centerpiece of Johnson\u2019s $16.6 billion\nbudget\nunveiled this week \u2014 would divert $552.4 million of TIF dollars to CPS, with the rest going to other taxing bodies, in what critics described as a \u201cbailout\u201d for the school system at the expense of parks, libraries and economic development initiatives, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n.\nEven Johnson\u2019s allies bristled. Alderman Michelle Harris of the 8th Ward, who chairs the City Council\u2019s rules committee, said the \u201cdrastic sweep\u201d could cripple future projects in South Side communities that rely heavily on TIF funding.\n\u201cUnintentionally or intentionally, we will lose projects in communities of color,\u201d Harris said at the meeting.\nBudget Director Annette Guzman defended the proposal, insisting that no existing or approved projects were cut to create the surplus, and that 83 percent of the city\u2019s 108 TIFs are netting year-over-year growth. Guzman said replenishment of funds was expected as\nproperty\nvalues within the TIF districts continue to rise.\nStill, the backlash was immediate. Alderman Nicole Lee of the 11th Ward said she was blindsided by the plan, calling it \u201coff-putting\u201d that affected wards were not consulted.\n\nAlderman Jason Ervin of the 28th Ward, the powerful Budget Committee chair, joined the pushback, noting that about 70 percent of the TIF surplus would come out of economically disadvantaged areas.\nErvin further demanded that CPS repay the city for a disputed $175 million pension payment for nonteaching employees \u2014 the same issue that prompted the mass resignation of the mayor\u2019s appointed school board and the firing of\nCEO Pedro Martinez\nearlier this fall.\nThe fight over the TIF sweep overshadowed debate on Johnson\u2019s other revenue-raising ideas, including a $21-per-month\ncorporate head tax\nand a 14 percent cloud computing levy \u2014 both decried by business groups as potential \u201cjob killers.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A joint venture of several big-name real estate companies landed nearly $200 million in debt to refinance a shopping center 20 miles from Midtown Manhattan.\nBlackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies provided Jamestown, Taconic Partners, Nuveen Real Estate and a public pension plan with a $198.5 million loan for the Ridge Hill open-air retail center in Yonkers, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The loan will retire existing debt and help to fund upcoming leasing efforts.\nA JLL Capital Markets team of Aaron Niedermayer, Kellogg Gaines and Evan Pariser arranged the debt.\nThe 1.2-million-square-foot property at 1 Ridge Hill Boulevard, which first opened in 2011, features a number of well-established tenants, including Apple, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Whole Foods Market, T.J. Maxx and Lowe\u2019s.\nBeyond the traditional retail options, there are also restaurants, a Legoland Discovery Center, a 12-screen movie theater, an indoor skydiving center and an LA Fitness gym.\nOwnership recently completed work on a 17,000-square-foot activity zone for families and a 25,000-square-foot \u201cTown Square\u201d community hub. In the last three years, tenants have signed deals for 679,000 square feet at Ridge Hill, which traded hands in 2022\nfor $220 million\n.\n\nThis is the second significant refinancing deal on Ridge Hill Boulevard in Yonkers in a matter of weeks.\nAt the start of the month, Azorim North America landed a loan to refinance Mizora at Ridge Hill, a 364-unit multifamily complex down the road. Acore Capital provided the\n$145 million\nloan for the property.\nElsewhere in Yonkers, MGM Resorts recently\ndropped\nout of downstate casino competition, despite being perceived as a leading contender for a gaming license. The news was especially surprising considering a community advisory committee unanimously\napproved\nthe proposal only last month.\nMGM blamed the decision on \u201ca newly defined competitive landscape,\u201d pointing to how the remaining proposals were clustered in a \u201csmall geographic area.\u201d\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The building is part of the 555 California Street complex owned by Vornado Realty Trust and the Trump Organization.\nThe business school will lease the Cube for more than a decade and is expected to move into the building in the next year and a half. The institution\u2019s current San Francisco location at 2 Harrison Street, which it shares with Google, has gotten too small after the search engine company grew its footprint in the two-building office property on the Embarcadero earlier this year. The school has had a presence in San Francisco for about 25 years, and for the past decade, Wharton has leased about 35,000 square feet at the Harrison Street building, known as Hills Plaza.\nThe expansion comes as the school grows its tech-focused offerings, including a new master of business administration degree in artificial intelligence starting this fall. The Trump Organization owns a 30 percent stake in the 1.8-million-square-foot complex, which comprises the 52-story skyscraper at\n555 California Street\nand two adjacent buildings at 315 and 345 Montgomery Street. The Cube rises five stories and will serve as the dedicated building for Wharton\u2019s Bay Area activities. The school will also have its campus next to high-profile financial clients at 555 California like Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Dodge &amp; Cox and UBS.\n\nWharton\u2019s San Francisco satellite campus currently serves approximately 220 students. The Institute of Contemporary Art San Francisco, which\noccupied 26,000 square feet of the Cube rent-free\n, will move out next year.\nThe school\u2019s growth comes as another top-tier university, Nashville-based Vanderbilt,\nnarrows its search\nfor a place to call home in San Francisco. Vanderbilt has been\nworking with Mayor Daniel Lurie\u2019s office\nto determine the best path forward for its West Coast outpost.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "SpaceX has settled a lawsuit brought by Cards Against Humanity in September, ending a quirky\nTexas land dispute\nbetween the rocket maker and the Chicago-based game company known for its dark humor.\nTexas court records show the settlement was reached last month, just ahead of a Nov. 3 jury trial. Terms weren\u2019t disclosed, and neither SpaceX nor its attorney responded to requests for comment, according to the Associated Press, which first\nreported\nthe development.\nThe dispute centered on a patch of land in\nCameron County\n, at the southern tip of Texas near SpaceX\u2019s\nStarbase\nlaunch site. Cards Against Humanity presumably paid more than $2 million for the parcel\u00a0 in 2017 as part of a plan to send a message of opposition to\u00a0 then-President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed border wall. The company raised money from 150,000 fans who each chipped in $15 to \u201csave America\u2019s future\u201d by purchasing and preserving the land.\nIn its lawsuit, the card company claimed SpaceX encroached on its property for at least six months, using it as a dumping ground for gravel, debris and other construction materials as the company expanded its rocket testing operations nearby. Court filings show SpaceX admitted to trespassing during discovery, though the extent of the damage was disputed.\nCards Against Humanity had sought $15 million in damages, citing environmental harm and loss of vegetation.\nWhile the settlement amount remains confidential, the card company told the outlet it likely wouldn\u2019t have recovered much even if it won at trial.\n\n\u201cThe upside is that SpaceX has removed their construction equipment from our land and we\u2019re able to work with a local landscaping company to restore the land to its natural state: devoid of space garbage and pointless border walls,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nThe company hinted that proceeds from the settlement could help repay donors, though it downplayed expectations.\n\u201cWere we hoping to be able to pay all our fans? Sure. But we did warn them they would \u2018probably only be able to get like $2 or most likely nothing,\u2019\u201d it said.\nThe agreement closes another chapter in SpaceX\u2019s ongoing\nproperty disputes\nin South Texas, where rapid expansion around Starbase has clashed with locals.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Chicago investor Bill Silverstein is betting on an adaptive reuse project near Oz Park within the coveted Lincoln Park neighborhood.\nSandz Development sold the\nWebster Square Apartments\nfor $35.8 million, marking the latest turnover at the former Lincoln Park Hospital site, which sits inside one of Chicago\u2019s priciest neighborhoods for rentals, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nSilverstein, founder of\nBeal Properties\n, bought the 75-unit building at 558 West Webster Avenue, according to Triton Realty Group, which brokered the deal for both parties. The property includes nearly 20,000 square feet of ground-floor retail and sits in the heart of Lincoln Park, where rental demand remains among the strongest in the city with average unit leases exceeding $2,000 monthly.\nSandz converted part of the shuttered hospital campus into apartments in 2014, following years of planning and neighborhood wrangling over density and traffic. The broader\nWebster Square redevelopment\nadded condos and single-family homes, as well, cementing the site as one of the more successful examples of an institutional property\u2019s reuse on the North Side.\nThe building\u2019s appeal rests as much on its design as its ZIP code.\n\n\u201cThis transaction demonstrates the enduring value of quality real estate in highly walkable, lifestyle-driven neighborhoods,\u201d\nTriton president Matthew Fritzshall\nsaid in a statement. \u201cWebster Square is an exceptional example of modern adaptive reuse paired with timeless architectural character.\u201d\nRents in the North Lakefront submarket \u2014 which includes Lincoln Park \u2014 average $2,120 per month, according to CoStar data, and are expected to rise amid a slowdown in new multifamily construction. That dynamic has made well-located properties like Webster Square competitive for long-term investors seeking stable cash flow and appreciation potential.\nSandz financed the 2014 project with a $20 million construction loan, though the total redevelopment cost remains unclear. A Sandz executive declined the outlet\u2019s request for comment on the recent sale. Beal, which controls dozens of North Side apartment buildings and suburban holdings, didn\u2019t return a Crain\u2019s request for comment.\nSilverstein\u2019s outfit has recently scooped up several North Side multifamily properties, as he\u2019s active in the mid-market apartment space as well as Chicago\u2019s condo deconversion game. Earlier this year, Beal Properties picked up a 94-unit\nGold Coast\nhigh rise at 1344 North Dearborn Street for $27 million. In 2023 he bought a 60-unit apartment building at 528 West Oakdale Avenue from Chicago-based Horizon for $17.5 million and a 56-unit apartment building at\n656 West Wrightwood Avenue\nfrom JAB Real Estate for $14.1 million in 2022.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A Miami-Dade judge approved a settlement agreement between Tatiana Pino\u2019s family and her brother-in-law Carlos Pino over the multimillion-dollar estate of the late Sergio Pino.\nSergio Pino, the founder and former CEO of Century Homebuilders Group,\ndied by suicide\nlast year as the FBI was closing in to arrest him for\nallegedly orchestrating\nmultiple attempts to kill his estranged wife, Tatiana Pino.\nThe settlement, approved on Wednesday by Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Yvonne Colodny, removes Carlos Pino\u2019s\noriginal claim\nthat he should be the personal representative for Sergio Pino\u2019s estate, the\nMiami Herald\nreported. Carlos also gave up his stake in Sergio Pino\u2019s Key Largo vacation home, and Century Homebuilders, which Tatiana Pino leads and owns fully, will forgive a nearly $700,000 debt owed by Carlos Pino.\nThe resolution confirms that Tatiana Pino is entitled to full ownership of Century Homebuilders, according to the Herald.\u00a0 When he founded the company in 2013, he and his wife were each entitled to 50 percent of the company. It became one of the largest Hispanic-owned homebuilders nationwide and has more than two dozen residential projects in Florida.\nLegal challenges to Sergio Pino\u2019s probate estate remain.\nIn September, Tatiana Pino and her daughters\nfiled a new lawsuit\nagainst Sergio Pino\u2019s longtime girlfriend, Nancy Pastor, and others that Tatiana Pino and her daughters claim were involved in allegedly fraudulent transfers in the days before and after his suicide.\n\nThat lawsuit centers on trust and lease documents, including a 99-year lease, which the plaintiffs claim were created or amended to minimize Tatiana Pino\u2019s ownership and benefit Pastor, without the consent of the bank, project partners or Tatiana Pino.\nSergio and Tatiana Pino were in the midst of a highly contentious divorce when he died. Sergio Pino began dating in the early 2000s, according to court filings.\nSeven of the nine men who have been charged in the murder-for-hire case have pleaded guilty in federal court.\n\u2014 Katherine Kallergis\n",

        "content": "Legal troubles are piling up for single-family home rehabbers Chris and Aneta Urban, who are facing a new string of lawsuits over unpaid loans and ballooning debt tied to a large portfolio in Chicago\u2019s South Side and south suburbs.\nThe brother-and-sister investors have been hit with dozens of foreclosure lawsuits for failure to pay debts across their vast fix-and-flip portfolio of more than 100 properties. Many were\nbrought by individual investors\nwhom they met through a local real estate training school. Andrew Holmes, Chris Urban\u2019s former mentor and the head of the Andrew Holmes Mastery Program, is also suing the siblings for fraud, accusing Chris of taking loans meant for construction and using them to pay off other loans across his troubled properties.\nThe Urbans had been buying and flipping properties in the South Side since 2019, starting with sales and later venturing into rentals. They began having trouble paying their debts last year,\nThe Real Deal previously reported\n.\nFive new lawsuits filed since the beginning of October represent a combined $1.5 million in unpaid debt that plaintiffs want to recover. One was brought by an investor that Holmes accused of being part of the Urbans\u2019 allegedly fraudulent scheme, Shirley Pollock. Through her company Best Funding Solutions LLC, Pollock is now seeking to foreclose on three properties where she loaned Urban money that hasn\u2019t been repaid.\nAnother investor is looking to foreclose on two properties where he loaned the Urbans money. A third is taking a different approach, by filing a breach of contract lawsuit demanding payment for a mortgage on a South Side property, but not seeking to foreclose it. Plus, a business loan company is seeking repayment on a second loan to Urban that went bad in late 2024.\nUrban declined to comment on the new lawsuits, stating he would resolve the matters \u201cthrough the courts, not the media.\u201d\nBest Funding Solutions\nA frequent investor in the Urbans\u2019 properties, Shirley Pollock began investing with the Urbans in 2021 and has loaned more than $5 million through her LLCs to them over the years,\nTRD previously reported\n.\nHolmes and his longtime business partner, Mary Desloover, are suing Pollock along with the Urbans on an accusation that Pollock helped cover up the Urbans\u2019 mounting debt in exchange for higher interest payments. Pollock has denied the claims in court, arguing she had no duty to disclose her loans and that she is also a victim of Urban\u2019s deception.\nPollock is now seeking to seize properties in Chicago, Hazel Crest and Calumet Park where she provided the Urbans mortgage loans. The combined principal for the three mortgages was $475,000, and Pollock\u2019s lawsuit says the amount owed with interest and late fees is over $581,000.\nAccording to loan agreements included in the lawsuit, the loans had six-month terms with 15 percent interest rates.\nAt one of those properties, Urban had given a second mortgage to Homes by MB, an LLC that has purchased a number of the Urbans\u2019 distressed homes.\nPollock didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment and her attorney declined to comment.\nPollock has also received deeds to some of the Urbans\u2019 properties where she had initially loaned them money for mortgages, property records show.\n\nJeffrey Meincke-Reza\nTwo more foreclosure lawsuits were brought by lender Jeffrey Wayne Meincke-Reza, who loaned the Urbans\u2019 LLCs $179,000 for a property in Dolton and $152,000 for a Calumet Park property.\nAccording to those suits, the Urbans owe more than $410,000 in principal and interest fees at the properties. The loans were given with a 10 percent interest and a six-month maturity term, according to the lawsuit.\nMeincke-Reza\u2019s attorney did not respond to a request for comment.\nMaria Bryjak\nIn another lawsuit, lender Maria Bryjak is seeking $283,000 from Chris Urban for a loan that he stopped making payments on in early January. The loan \u2018s principal was $186,000 for a mortgage on a house on South Prairie Avenue in Chicago. She is suing only Chris Urban and one of his LLCs, not Aneta Urban.\nIt appears to be the only property where Bryjak loaned the Urbans money, according to property records. The eight-month loan had a 15 percent interest rate, court records show.\nThe South Prairie Avenue property the loan is tied to has a second mortgage on it from an LLC operated by investor Wendy Valencia, who is also suing the Urbans for foreclosure at multiple properties.\nBryjak could not be reached for comment, and her attorney did not respond to a request for comment.\nOnDeck loan\nBusiness loan company OnDeck has filed a second lawsuit against Chris Urban over a loan that he took out in 2024. The loan had a principal amount of $225,000, and Urban stopped making payments in October 2024, around the time his payments to other lenders stopped.\nLate fees and interest have pushed the debt up to $261,800, which OnDeck is seeking to recover from Urban.\nIn a previously filed lawsuit, OnDeck is looking to recover $87,000 for a separate $155,000 business loan Urban took out in March 2024.\n",

        "content": "Uptown landlord Harwood International is quietly offloading buildings in its namesake district after\na year marred by distress\n.\nDeed records show Gabriel Barbier-Mueller\u2019s Dallas-based firm has sold Harwood No. 2, Harwood No. 6, Harwood No. 7 and Harwood No. 10 to San Francisco-based hedge fund TPG. The sales were recorded in September, a few months after\nHarwood tapped Newmark\nto help it find equity partners and debt for the next phase of its 30-acre Harwood District.\nThe four properties total 892,000 square feet of Uptown office space.\nHarwood No. 2, at 2728 North Harwood Street, is a 10-story, 178,000-square-foot property that was completed in 1996. It\u2019s appraised at $58.3 million.\nHarwood No. 6 (also known as Saint Ann Court) is a 26-story, 320,000-square-foot office building that opened in 2009 at 2501 North Harwood Street. It\u2019s valued at $160 million.\nHarwood No. 7 (also known as Frost Tower), at 2950 North Harwood Street, is a 22-story office property with 167,000 square feet of space. It\u2019s appraised at $83.5 million.\nThe 22-story 227,000-square-foot Harwood No. 10, at 2850 North Harwood Street, was delivered in 2019. It\u2019s valued at $120 million.\nNeither Harwood nor TPG responded to a request for comment.\n\nTPG also appears to be financing Harwood\u2019s latest project, Harwood No. 15. It\nprovided a $100 million construction loan\nfor the 23-story, 340,000-square-foot office project planned for 3008 North Harwood Street. A state filing last November showed the project was expected to cost $120 million, with a projected completion date of June 2027.\nHarwood said Jones Day is committed to a\n73,000-square-foot lease\nat the new building. The law firm has leased space at Harwood No. 3 since 1999.\nHarwood nearly lost Harwood No.6\nto foreclosure in January but saved the building with a recapitalization deal.\nIn purchasing the property, TPG assumed the $105 million loan tied to the building from New York Life Insurance Company.\nIt was the first of three foreclosures Harwood has been hit with this year.\nHarwood handed back the keys to Harwood No. 4\nafter allegedly defaulting on an $80 million mortgage tied to the building. San Francisco-based Spear Street Capital took back that 221,000-square-foot property in a $73 million credit bid.\nHarwood is facing its\nthird office foreclosure\nthis year with Harwood No.1, at 2651 North Harwood Street, heading to the auction block next month, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service.\nHarwood borrowed $37.45 million from First United Bank for the 105,550-square-foot property in 2020. The debt works out to $355 per square foot. The auction is scheduled for Nov. 4 at 10 a.m. at the Dallas County Courthouse. It\u2019s possible that Harwood and First United could work out a loan extension to avoid the sale.\nAs its name suggests, Harwood No. 1 was the firm\u2019s first office development, built in 1984 for Rolex. In April, the building was 54.1 percent leased.\n",

Harris, through his attorney, Adam Leitman Bailey, claimed he had 12 sales under contract when he left, which should have yielded more than $700,000 in gross commissions, $293,000 of which should have been paid to him.\n\nHowever, shortly after he submitted the paperwork to collect, Harris alleges BHS sent him a \u201cclawback letter\u201d claiming he owed the firm more than $430,000 for \u201ccommission splits and expense funds paid in excess of BHS\u2019s standard policies during the three years before Harris left.\u201d\nThe letter stated that the firm would not pay Harris the outstanding commissions considering the amount of money he owed the firm, which he alleges is \u201cvastly inflated.\u201d Included in their calculation was a $38,000 bonus paid to Harris for his performance in 2024.\nHowever, the complaint argues that Harris was actually owed a $75,000 bonus, the full amount of which BHS never paid him, and that it failed to deliver on several of its other promises, including giving him and his team a private office in the firm\u2019s Upper West Side location.\nThe complaint alleges BHS \u201ctook several other actions calculated to sabotage Harris,\u201d including \u201cmaliciously\u201d downplaying his sales volume to RealTrends by reporting he\u2019d only closed $104 million worth of deals in 2024 instead of $138 million.\nHarris also claims the firm didn\u2019t shut down or set up an autoreply to his former BHS account, which he argues is still receiving emails from \u201cclients, colleagues, and other important contacts\u201d and causing him to \u201cmiss potential sales and damage [his] reputation.\u201d\nThe lawsuit seeks at least $8 million in damages as well as a declaratory judgment clearing him from any outstanding balance with BHS.\nHarris\u2019 complaint comes after another former BHS agent, Chris Poore,\nsued the brokerage\nfor failing to pay him commissions on a $4.9 million deal after he left the firm. Like Harris, Poore claimed the brokerage sent him a demand to pay back hundreds of thousands of dollars under its clawback policies.\nA judge sided with Poore and awarded him summary judgment on two of the claims, though the litigation is still pending.\n",

The seller is the Ganger family\u2019s Ganger Miradero Community Property Trust. Pascal and Antonio Liguori with Premier Estate Properties had the listing, and Candace Friis with the Corcoran Group brought the buyer.\nThe sale was\nreported in September\n, but the buyer was not previously known.\n\nTurner is the head of Nashville-based Market Street Enterprises, the development firm founded by his late father, James Stephen \u201cSteve\u201d Turner, who is largely credited with the revival of the Nashville neighborhood, the Gulch, now known as a retail and restaurant hub. The Turners are members of the billionaire family that founded discount retailer Dollar General. They are also alumni and longtime supporters of\nVanderbilt University\n, which is seeking to open a graduate school campus in nearby West Palm Beach.\nThe 0.9-acre Miradero was designed by famed Palm Beach architect Maurice Fatio for Lila Vanderbilt Webb, granddaughter of Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, in 1928. It was last sold to the Ganger family for an undisclosed amount in 1970, according to published reports. The three-building compound totals nine bedrooms, 10 bathrooms and a pool and spans 121 feet of beachfront, records show.\nThe estate hit the market asking $25 million in September, Zillow shows.\nTurner\u2019s purchase isn\u2019t the only pricey Gulf Stream deal in recent months. In September, attorney Henry Rosen bought a\n$22 million\noceanfront home. Last year, Debra Levitetz, the ex-wife of Purity Wholesale Grocers founder Jeffrey Levitetz, sold her oceanfront teardown for\n$39 million\n, making it the most expensive home ever sold in Gulf Stream.",

        "content": "A long-promised affordable housing project in San Francisco\u2019s Tenderloin has been kicked down the road again.\nRather than building new homes at the site, the Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing and Community Development is opting to grant a five-year lease extension for La Cocina\u2019s incubator kitchen at 101 Hyde Street in the\nTenderloin\n, Mission Local\nreported\n. In keeping La Cocina at 101 Hyde, the city will purportedly save hundreds of thousands of dollars in vacancy fees amid a difficult funding climate.\nThe 96-year-old building was once a post office that was meant to be transformed into affordable housing.\nShorenstein\nbought the property, at 101 Hyde Street, in 2016 for $12.5 million in an agreement with the city to build affordable residences and donate the building back to the local government. The proposal called for 85 income-restricted units.\n\u201cThere was a small minority in the neighborhood who thought we could do better on the amount of affordable housing,\u201d Meg Spriggs of Shoreinstein\u2019s multifamily division\ntold\nthe San Francisco Business Times in 2016. \u201c101 Hyde Street had been on the market. [Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation] had their eyes on it, but really wasn\u2019t able to be competitive. They suggested we buy that property and dedicate it to the city.\u201d The building is owned by the City and County of San Francisco, per property records.\nIn 2021, La Cocina, a nonprofit geared toward serving women, immigrants and people of color aspiring to be food and restaurant entrepreneurs, turned the building into a public food hall in a $6 million revamp. The organization served $5 meals with the hope of reviving a blighted block plagued with drug activity. But with downtown workers slow to\nreturn to work post-pandemic\n, the nonprofit shuttered the food hall in 2023 and reverted to running a private commissary kitchen similar to its location in the\nMission District\n.\n\n\u201cThis is not a matter of prioritization, it\u2019s about feasibility,\u201d Anne Stanley, a spokesperson for the housing office, said in a statement, per Mission Local. \u201cGiven limited resources and the competitive nature of affordable housing finance, we must be strategic and responsible stewards of public funds.\u201d\nCritics in the Tenderloin see it differently, as the neighborhood has been promised affordable housing at the site for a decade.\n\u201cThey got the money for having that building based on that premise that they were going to be providing that ongoing benefit for the community,\u201d Kasey Rios Asberry, a community advocate who once helped create La Cocina\u2019s now-closed public street space, told Mission Local. \u201cMost of the time, the metal doors are down. It\u2019s again a blighted space on the sidewalk instead of a free flowing contributor to public health.\u201d\nUltimately, the lack of\nvisitor traffic\nproved too high of a hurdle for La Cocina to overcome.\n\u201cWe were trying to create economic opportunities for working-class immigrant and women-of-color small businesses while providing a welcoming space for the Tenderloin,\u201d La Cocina spokesperson Aniela Valtierra told Mission Local. \u201cPlaces like the Marketplace can\u2019t survive on admiration alone. They require consistent patronage and support.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

The unit on the 121st floor was originally priced at $64 million in the building\u2019s first offering plan, marking a 14 percent fall in its asking price.\nThe 178-unit building is now more than two-thirds sold, according to Marketproof.\nThe Central Park Tower deal marks the second condo asking over $40 million this month at a long-selling tower. Unit 65 at 53 West 53rd Street,\nasking just under $47 million\n, inked a deal at the start of October.\n",

In November, the SEC and\nKapoor\nreached a settlement, but Lee is still in the midst of selling properties in order to pay creditors.\nIn a phone interview, Korge said finalizing the deal was taking too long, and he has shifted careers from real estate to technology. \u201cWe made that offer in what feels like the last century,\u201d Korge said. \u201cI regret that this didn\u2019t move a little more smoothly. I would have bought it, but I just can\u2019t wait.

However, Korge\u2019s purchase was delayed by a series of objections from a lender, the owner of the land underneath the project and a group of investors who have a stayed lawsuit in Miami-Dade Circuit Court against the\nLocation Ventures\naffiliate that owns the project, court filings show.\nLee now plans to enter into a sale and purchase agreement with LDHC Holdings, an affiliate of the lender, Halpern Family Trust, which has a pending foreclosure lawsuit against the Location Ventures affiliate that owns the project. The Halpern trust has also been making ground lease payments to the landowner, David Martin\u2019s Coconut Grove-based Terra, according to recent motions. In April, Terra listed the 0.4-acre parcel with an asking price of\n$18.9 million\n.\nLDHC Holdings agreed to pay the same price Korge offered, consisting of a $27.4 million credit bid, plus $800,000, court records show. The credit bid represents the mortgage principal, interest and fees allegedly owed by Location Ventures.",

        "content": "A once-prolific real estate partnership that reenvisioned retail corners from Crystal Lake to downtown Chicago has collapsed into bitter litigation, with investor Shai Wolkowicki accusing his longtime former business partner\nMitch Goltz\nof siphoning funds and pledging company assets without proper consent.\nThe allegations mark an extraordinary public split for the duo once rising to become among Chicago\u2019s busiest retail developers.\nIn a lawsuit filed Monday in Cook County court, Wolkowicki and his firm Ruby Development Group claim Goltz \u201cengaged in wrongful conduct\u201d to divert more than $2 million in sale proceeds from the Evanston retail property known as Church Street Plaza. An affiliate of GW Properties, Wolkowicki\u2019s and Goltz\u2019s former firm, just sold it to Chicago-based\nContinuum Capital for $31.2 million\n.\nBut the timing of Wolkowicki\u2019s complaint prompts scrutiny, as he\u2019s currently\nfacing a barrage of financial trouble\ntied to distressed multifamily deals on Chicago\u2019s South Side and throughout Illinois, from Rockford to Springfield.\nIt\u2019s at least the\nsecond legal battle Wolkowicki has waged\nin recent weeks against current or former real estate partners. He\u2019s also casting blame on\nChikoo Patel\n, the head of a company that dissolved earlier this year called CKO Real Estate that was in charge of property management for dozens of South Side apartment buildings that he, Wolkowicki and Wolkowicki\u2019s wife Lauren Lampert owned.\nMeanwhile, Goltz, through his new company GTZ Properties, has continued buying real estate since splitting with Wolkowicki and their GW firm. In its most high-profile transaction, GW purchased an\noffice complex in the western Chicago suburb of Oak Brook\nout of distress this summer.\nGoltz declined to comment on this week\u2019s lawsuit other than to say he plans to formally deny the allegations.\nThis week\u2019s lawsuit further alleges Goltz personally enriched himself through unauthorized loans and distributions. The suit names Goltz, his living trust and several entities tied to their joint venture umbrella, GW Properties, as defendants.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the two men spent more than a decade developing dozens of urban infill projects under the GW Properties banner, a partnership that paired Wolkowicki\u2019s capital-raising prowess with Goltz\u2019s construction management. But the relationship unraveled in 2024 and 2025 amid what Wolkowicki describes as chronic cost overruns and mismanagement that left multiple projects undercapitalized \u2014 all of which he blamed on Goltz.\nThe flashpoint came with the Evanston sale this September. Wolkowicki\u2019s entity Ruby says it funded the entire $5 million equity stake for the venture and was owed virtually all net proceeds from the sale. Instead, the filing alleges, Goltz blocked the release of the money from escrow unless Wolkowicki agreed to a $1.6 million \u201cdevelopment fee\u201d for a Goltz-controlled affiliate \u2014 a fee the plaintiffs call \u201cmanufactured\u201d and unsupported by any contract.\nThe complaint further alleges that Goltz had already taken a $450,000 \u201cpartial payment\u201d toward that fee before closing, without his partner\u2019s consent, and later refused to release even the undisputed balance. \u201cGoltz has held the escrowed amounts hostage,\u201d the suit claims, \u201cin a transparent effort to leverage Wolkowicki into agreeing to the development fee.\u201d\nWolkowicki also accuses Goltz of treating a separate joint venture, 4550 W. Patterson LLC, \u201cas if it were his own.\u201d The suit says Goltz or an entity he controls pledged the company\u2019s membership interests as collateral for a loan that did not benefit the partnership and made more than $100,000 in unauthorized distributions to himself. Ruby Development, which owns a 20 percent stake in the Patterson project, discovered the loan only after finding a recorded lien against the property, according to the suit.\nThe complaint seeks declaratory relief and damages for breach of contract, tortious interference and breach of fiduciary duty, along with punitive damages and attorneys\u2019 fees from Goltz and his entities. Wolkowicki\u2019s suit names defendants that also appear to be partially under his own control and ownership, making it unclear how the case moves forward given that it appears the investor is suing his own interests.\nThe new suit paints Goltz as unable or unwilling to inject new capital, \u201crolling one deal into the next\u201d while Wolkowicki repeatedly bailed out projects. It also highlights how the partners\u2019 unwinding has turned personal: Wolkowicki, now based in Palm Beach County, Florida, accuses Goltz of using the fabricated development fee to \u201cavoid having to personally contribute funds\u201d to wind down their portfolio.\nThe case is pending before Judge Joel Chupack in Cook County court, with a hearing set for Dec. 22.\n",

That breaks down to almost $49 per square foot. The auction deal, expected to close next month, marks a steep drop from the property\u2019s mid-2000s value \u2014 and a sign of how far State Street\u2019s fortunes have fallen.\nThe property, located at the corner of State and Madison streets, last traded for $54.5 million in 2004, when a venture led by New York investor Isaac Shalom bought the four-level space. That equates to $320 per square foot.\nLNR Partners\ntook control last fall after filing a\n$50 million foreclosure suit\nagainst the ownership group over missed loan payments, Cook County records show.\nDespite the corridor\u2019s broader challenges, One North State remains 93 percent leased. T.J. Maxx rents the property with 45,000 square feet through early 2027, while Burlington occupies about 53,000 square feet through 2029. Smaller tenants \u2014 including Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Tropical Smoothie Cafe and Raygun \u2014 have recently signed leases, offering some stability amid downtown\u2019s retail turbulence.\nTranswestern\u2019s Paul Barile, who marketed the property, declined to name the buyer but noted increased interest from New York investors in financially troubled Chicago real estate.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a rush of New York buyers coming into Chicago because they think there\u2019s a lot of upside,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cIn time, it should be a moneymaker.\u201d\nThat timeline remains uncertain. More than five years after the onset of the pandemic, retail vacancy still hovers around 26 percent downtown, according to Stone Real Estate. Persistent foot traffic issues, retailer exits and higher interest rates have all contributed to plunging property values along what was once Chicago\u2019s signature shopping corridor.\nNamdar, based in Great Neck, New York, has built a national reputation buying struggling malls and retail centers at bargain prices. In Chicago, the firm has been\nespecially active\n, scooping up distressed office towers at 1 North LaSalle Street and 70 West Madison Street, as well as retail space at the base of the Warwick Allerton Hotel on the Magnificent Mile of North Michigan Avenue.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Dallas\u2019 skyline is set for a\nmajor makeover\nthanks to millions in\ncity tax incentives\n.\nDallas City Council unanimously approved a\n$103 million incentive package\nWednesday to back developers\nMike Hoque\nand Mike Ablon\u2019s ambitious plan to redevelop the 72-story Bank of America Plaza, the city\u2019s tallest tower and one of its most recognizable landmarks, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nThe duo plans to convert portions of the nearly 2 million-square-foot building at 901 Main Street into a hotel with event and retail space, plus a parking garage.\nThe payment will come from the Downtown Connection Tax Increment Financing District, whose boundaries were expanded as part of the same vote. The deal clears the way for Hoque and Ablon\u2019s firm, 901 Main PAHG Partners, to buy the property from Metropolis Investment Holdings, a Chicago-based firm managing assets for a German family investment group.\nThe redevelopment plan calls for a full reimagining of the 1.8 million-square-foot tower. Office space will be trimmed to 1.5 million square feet and fully renovated, while a 275-key hotel and related amenities will be added in partnership with hospitality veteran Dave Johnson of Horizon Capital.\nA glass-and-steel addition across Main Street will house a hotel lobby, ballroom and a 1,115-space parking garage, linked to the main tower by a skybridge. Plans also call for street-level retail, restaurants, as well as a 69th-floor restaurant with an outdoor observation deck.\n\nThe first phase of the $409 million redevelopment blueprint that includes four additional city blocks is expected to wrap in three years. As part of council\u2019s stipulations for the TIF funding, the developers must close on the property and four adjacent blocks by September 2026 and finish construction by 2032, investing at least $395 million and meeting benchmarks for office, hotel and retail space.\n\u201c\nDowntown Dallas\nis at a critical juncture where much of its development has to be rethought and reimagined,\u201d Hoque told the outlet. \u201cToday\u2019s approval paves the way for a transformational change that connects Main Street District with the West End and the new Convention Center.\u201d\nAblon, founder of PegasusAblon, said the project could be \u201ccatalytic for the next generation of Downtown Dallas,\u201d adding that it aligns with the city\u2019s Downtown 360 Plan. Downtown Dallas CEO Jennifer Scripps also endorsed the project, calling it key to maintaining the area\u2019s economic vitality amid shifting office demand.\nCouncil member Paul Ridley hailed the project as a model for adaptive reuse in the city center, while creating hundreds of construction and hospitality jobs.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Rebuilding efforts in Malibu nine months after the deadly Palisades fire have barely gotten underway.\nWhile owners in the Pacific Palisades next door and\nAltadena\nacross town have gotten hundreds of rebuild permits, the City of Malibu has granted just a handful, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n. As a result, burned-out lots across the seaside enclave remain fenced off and overgrown.\nThe City of Los Angeles handles most permits in the Palisades, issuing 833 so far, or about 42 percent of all applications received, according to the state\u2019s\nrebuilding dashboard\n. Los Angeles County, which handles most permits in Altadena, has issued 601, or about 26 percent of the total applications received.\nBy contrast, the City of Malibu has\nissued a paltry five permits\n, making up approximately 3 percent of the total applications received.\n\u201cIt\u2019s depressing,\u201d Abe Roy, a Malibu resident and professional builder, told the Times. \u201cIf this current pace continues,\nrebuilding\nwill take way longer than a decade.\u201d Roy was appointed as the city\u2019s first Rebuild Ambassador in May but publicly resigned last month.\n\u201cOur work is far from done,\u201d Roy told the Malibu City Council as he resigned,\naccording\nto the Times. \u201cTwo permits issued in nearly 10 months is an abomination by any standard.\u201d\nWhile many Malibu residents want to stay, others are listing their homes for sale and looking to start a new life elsewhere. About 75 lots in Malibu have sold since the fire, but sales are slowing, opening up a buyer\u2019s market. Of the 160 lots in Malibu listed this year that are still on the market, 47 have gotten a price cut.\n\u201cSupply is exceeding demand, and lots are selling anywhere from a 20 to 60 percent discount,\u201d Roy said. \u201cThat\u2019s a premonition for a freefall.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemodeling a kitchen or bathroom is onerous for most people. But building a house from the ground up is almost impossible,\u201d he added. \u201cAfter a while, you raise your hand and say, \u2018I don\u2019t know how long I can be on this treadmill.\u2019\u201d\nThe city has purportedly been sending applications back to residents to remedy necessary corrections, further delaying rebuilding efforts for owners. As a result, many are giving up entirely and opting to sell.\nMalibu\u2019s unique mountainous geography and rocky geology present even more issues in rebuilding endeavors. Of the roughly 720 homes in Malibu burned by the\nPalisades fire\n, 50 percent of them were on the water and 30 percent were on steep slopes, according to Yolanda Bundy, community development director at the Malibu Rebuild Center, the one-stop shop set up by the City of Malibu in the wake of the fires to help both homeowners and contractors through the rebuilding process.\n\u201cThese homes require septic systems, sea walls, retaining walls and complex foundations. Those come with restrictions,\u201d Bundy said.\nOne of the biggest factors in applications slowing to a crawl is architectural plans missing necessary notes and numbers. While only a handful of building permits have been issued, about half of the nearly 170 applications have already passed through the planning phase but are still waiting to advance through the building and safety review process, Bundy told the Times.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an oversimplification to say that we\u2019re not making any progress compared to L.A.,\u201d Bundy said. \u201cFamilies are frustrated, but I want every family to know we\u2019re doing our best to get them home.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Two Chicago real estate firms just pulled off a rare Loop office flip with a hefty return.\nA venture of Mike Reschke\u2019s Prime Group and Quintin Primo\u2019s Capri Investment Group sold the 385,000-square-foot former\nCboe Global Markets\nheadquarters at 400 South LaSalle Street for $40 million, or almost $104 per square foot \u2014 more than triple the $12 million they paid for it last year, or just $31 per square foot.\nThe buyer, Arlington, Virginia-based Legacy Investing, plans to transform the six-story property into a 33-megawatt data center slated to go online by late 2026, co-founder and managing partner Daniel English\ntold\nCoStar News.\nPrime\nand\nCapri\nbought the wide, concrete-and-steel building in July 2024 with an eye toward data center redevelopment. English credited the firms with significantly boosting the property\u2019s value through early-phase work, including upgrades to power capacity \u2014 a desirable commodity nationwide.\n\u201cThey played a critical role in assuring that the building has enough power,\u201d English told the outlet. \u201cThere\u2019s a shortage of power throughout the country right now. It\u2019s a great partnership where they created value, and now we\u2019re creating the next stage.\u201d\n\nLegacy, which specializes in data storage, logistics and life sciences real estate across the country, is betting that central locations like the Loop will play an increasing role in the next wave of data infrastructure. English said while most people think of data centers propping up only in \u201cfarm fields out in the middle of nowhere,\u201d the proximity of power and connectivity in urban locations also provides applicable value.\nThe deal stands out in a market still struggling with record-high office vacancies and rising financing costs. While most downtown buildings are currently trading at steep discounts, Prime and Capri\u2019s sale marks a rare profit-making turnaround, albeit with a new use in mind in an escape from workspace. The firms are also leading the $280 million overhaul of the Helmut Jahn-designed Thompson Center nearby, where Google plans to open a major new office.\nDemand for data centers has exploded with the rise of artificial intelligence and cloud computing. JLL recently projected that developers could invest $1 trillion in North American data infrastructure by 2030.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The sublease deal with the tech giant marks one of the largest office leases in the Bay Area in the third quarter.\nMoloco\u2019s new headquarters will come complete with amenities like a wellness center, on-site gym, 76 conference rooms and walking trails.\n\u201cI\u2019m giddy,\u201d Joanne Wrenn, chief people officer at Moloco, told the Business Times of the move. \u201cWe have a lot of action happening here.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s head count in the Bay Area has grown to nearly 200 employees. Founded in 2013, the nearly $2 billion firm has been able to capitalize on the\nartificial intelligence boom\nby helping advertisers use machine learning to better target and optimize their ad campaigns.\n\nAfter signing the lease deal, Moloco reportedly hosted a company tour of its new digs at 135 Commonwealth to introduce employees to the space. The company is planning for up to 400 desks at the site to accommodate its machine-learning teams and to support collaborative work. Moloco plans to relocate at the top of next year.\n\u201cWe have big ambitions,\u201d Wrenn said. \u201cWe just needed a place where we can grow.\u201d\nAI\u2019s meteoric growth in recent years has been attracting startups and tech companies doubling down on AI in the Bay Area. In the third quarter, in San Francisco alone, businesses sought 7.9 million square feet of offices, marking an\nall-time high for office space demand\nin the city, per CBRE data. That includes 2.6 million square feet of net new demand, putting it in line with pre-pandemic averages. CBRE predicted in May that AI office occupancy in San Francisco\nwould reach 21 million square feet\nby the end of the decade.\nNearby in Menlo Park, AI company Snowflake just opened its 30,000-square-foot\n\u201cSilicon Valley AI Hub,\u201d\ndesigned for cross-collaboration between up-and-coming firms in the AI sphere.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "Main Square\u2019s\nTerra Nova\ncommunity is moving forward after revisions prompted by\ncommunity concerns\n.\nThe Terrell City Council approved the first reading of an annexation request this week covering 712 acres for a 1,550-acre mixed-use development proposed by the Plano-based developer, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The project faces a final council vote Nov. 4.\nMain Square President Hugo Morales called the annexation vote \u201can important milestone in the life of this project.\u201d The firm\u2019s plans call for roughly 3,600 single-family homes, 1,200 multifamily units, 145 acres of parks, and a 50-acre mixed-use center called Terra Nova Village along Griffith Road near FM 245. The community is expected to unfold over 14 to 16 phases.\nCouncil also approved the creation of a tax increment reinvestment zone encompassing the entire 2,061-acre Terra Nova footprint. It\u2019s designed to fund infrastructure improvements such as roads and utilities using future tax revenue. The TIRZ, like the annexation, will return for a final reading early next month.\nSome Terrell residents weren\u2019t originally on board with the scale of Terra Nova, bringing up concerns about congestion, rising home prices and strain on schools. The city of about 23,000 people could see its population surge by potentially tens of thousands under the plan. Morales said his team has modified the project in response to feedback.\n\n\u201cMultiple edits have been made to the development agreement to address the concerns brought up by the citizenry and reaffirm their voices have been heard,\u201d Morales said.\nMain Square\u2019s strategy mirrors the suburban\nmegaproject model\nreshaping much of North Texas. Developers are targeting cities\nbeyond Dallas County\nfor large-scale, mixed-use communities that blend single-family, multifamily and retail components with parks and open space.\nTerra Nova would be one of the largest in Kaufman County, part of Main Square\u2019s broader push to expand its footprint. Though this is Main Square\u2019s first project, the firm also controls about 1,100 acres in Cedar Hill and is eyeing projects in Sherman and Royse City.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",
