        "content": "William Ticona\u2019s Grupo T&amp;C won approval for his planned Edge House Miami, a short-term rental-friendly project in Edgewater.\nThe City of Miami\u2019s Urban Development Review Board greenlit the Kobi Karp-designed tower, according to a press release. Lima, Peru-based Grupo T&amp;C\u2019s 56-story, 608-unit project is planned for the 0.6-acre site at 1825 Northeast 4th Avenue, formerly 1837 Northeast 4th Avenue.\nRecords show an affiliate of Grupo T&amp;C bought the site for an undisclosed price in 2012.\nUnits will range from studios to three bedrooms, from 410 square feet to 1,200 square feet, and come fully furnished and designed by interiors firm Adriana Hoyos Design Studio, the release states. Amenities in the building will include a fitness center, spa facilities, two pools, co-working spaces, a podcast studio, a garden, playground and putting green. Ticona tapped Douglas Elliman Development Marketing to lead sales for the project, and prices start at $500,000. Construction is expected to finish in 2028, a spokesperson confirmed.\n\nEdge House marks the latest addition to\na stacked pipeline of short-term rental projects\nin Miami-Dade County, where such projects make up half of all planned residential projects.\nTicona\nis also a newcomer in the ultra-competitive\nEdgewater\nneighborhood, where thousands of condo units are in the works. But he may have found a sweet spot.\n\u201cIn Edgewater, I don\u2019t know anyone else who is doing short-term rentals,\u201d Cervera Real Estate commercial broker Francesco Canestri told\nTRD\nlast year. \u201cWhat William [Ticona] is offering is something no one on the south end of the neighborhood is offering. That is the strategy.\u201d\nIn an interview last year, Ticona said he wanted to be where the competition was.\n\u201cEdgewater is a very hot zone,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere our competitors are is where our customers are. We want to be in areas that have the most development.\u201d\nLast year, he bought another residential development site in the neighborhood for\n$15.1 million\n. The property is zoned for a 36-story tower with either 124 units or 248 hotel rooms.",

        "content": "Related Midwest\u2019s 62-acre South Loop site The 78 is one step closer to approval and with it, Chicago Fire FC is approaching a Soldier Field exit.\nThe Chicago Plan Commission on Thursday approved rezoning for Related Midwest\u2019s 62-acre South Loop site, advancing plans for a $750 million, privately\nfinanced\nstadium at The 78 that would anchor an $8 billion mixed-use campus, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The 22,000-seat venue, targeted for completion by the 2028 season, would be the centerpiece of a long-stalled development that Related Midwest CEO Curt Bailey has been pitching since 2016.\nBailey told commissioners the project is a signal Chicago is \u201cback in so many ways,\u201d predicting thousands of jobs and a Wrigleyville-style entertainment district around the stadium. Fire\nowner\nJoe Mansueto would buy roughly 10 acres of the site for the stadium, while Related would retain control of surrounding development, including plans for 5,000-plus apartments, part of a multi-phased mixed-use district along the Chicago River south of Roosevelt Road, between the South Loop and Chinatown.\nThe rezoning still needs City Council zoning committee and full Council approval.\nAlderman Pat Dowell represents the 3rd Ward, where The 78 would be located. Dowel reiterated her\nbacking\nduring Thursday\u2019s meeting, calling the project exciting for the city and the 3rd Ward. She said her support is contingent on the Fire\u2019s stadium being the only stadium at the site \u2014 a reference to Related\u2019s parallel talks with the White Sox about relocating from Guaranteed Rate Field. The rezoning amendment approved Thursday includes language limiting The 78 to a single stadium unless new approvals are sought.\nThe Sox, who\nfloated\na ballpark concept for the site last year, have said they are keeping \u201call options open.\u201d\nTraffic and transit remain a sticking point. A study commissioned by the Fire and Related found game-day congestion would be less severe than weekday rush hour. The project caps large-scale events at 45 annually, including 17 Fire home matches.\n\n25th Ward Alderman Byron Sigcho-Lopez pressed for more community feedback, warning against rushing a massive redevelopment. Dowell countered that nine community meetings had been held and argued the city shouldn\u2019t stall a private investment on land that\u2019s sat vacant for half a century.\nStill is how much public money will be needed to upgrade infrastructure around the stadium. Related\u2019s 2019 redevelopment agreement called for up to $551 million in tax-increment financing for roads, bridges and transit, but Bailey has said a revised deal would trim costs by scrapping plans for a new CTA Red Line station and Metra track realignment.\nCity planning officials said talks over TIF reimbursements are in the early stages. Any revised agreement would need sign-off from the Community Development Commission and City Council Finance Committee \u2014 which Dowell chairs, giving her significant leverage over how much taxpayer support flows to the 78.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A state agency cleared the way for Muslim-focused master-planned community\nEPIC City\nto proceed, ending one chapter in the high-profile political push to stop the project.\nThe Texas Workforce Commission settled a Fair Housing Act complaint against Community Capital Partners, the developer of EPIC City, The Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. The agency dismissed the complaint this week after the firm agreed to new housing policies, staff training and five years of compliance reporting. The developer admitted no wrongdoing.\nAs part of the deal, Community Capital Partners must udpate its sales and marketing materials, adopt nondiscriminatory housing standards and avoid using any applicant criteria not tied directly to business necessity. The firm is also required to implement written fair housing procedures subject to state approval.\nDespite the regulatory scrutiny, Community Capital Partners said it is forging ahead with the $400 million, 402-acre project near Josephine in Collin and Hunt counties. Plans call for more than 1,000 homes alongside a mosque, K-12 Islamic school, apartments, senior housing, retail, healthcare clinics, sports facilities and a community college.\n\u201cWe welcomed the opportunity to take a deep dive into the Fair Housing Act,\u201d Imran Chaudhary, the developer\u2019s president, said in a statement, framing the settlement as a chance to strengthen the project.\nThe resolution comes after political attacks on EPIC City reached a fever pitch this spring, during the Texas legislative session. Governor Greg Abbott has repeatedly accused the group of trying to create \u201cSharia compounds\u201d and said as many as a dozen agencies are investigating.\n\nBut, so far, the attacks have fallen flat. The\nU.S. Department of Justice closed\nits own civil rights investigation into the project in June.\nAbbott, however, signaled the state isn\u2019t finished, keeping EPIC City at the center of a culture-war flashpoint that has now bled into real estate development.\nHe\nsigned a new law\nover the summer \u2014 House Bill 4211 \u2014 aimed at blocking the business structure behind EPIC City, a move the developers and their attorney blasted as fearmongering.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nauseating to my very core that an elected official \u2026 is lying to Texans,\u201d attorney Dan Cogdell told the outlet.\nThe law requires new disclosure and ownership rules for business entities selling interest in shared real estate ventures. The law was\nauthored\nby Rep. Candy Noble, a Republican from the Collin County town of Lucas.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The buyers plan on redeveloping\nGalleria Fort Lauderdale\nwith detailed plans to be unveiled in the combining months, a press release states.\nGalbut called the property \u201can incredible site\u201d that\u2019s two blocks from the ocean.\n\u201cA transaction like this comes about once in a lifetime,\u201d he told\nTRD\n. \u201cWe\u2019re going to reinvent the mall and make it magical like all of the other projects we work on.\u201d\nA source told\nTRD\nthe partnership paid at least $90 million for the property. The partnership declined to comment on the price.\nThe deal marks another redevelopment play for builders\ntargeting older shopping centers\n. In Cutler Bay, Electra America and BH Group are redeveloping portions of Southland Mall into the\n$1 billion\nSouthplace City Center. The planned mixed-use project could ultimately have 4,395 apartments and condos, a 150-room hotel, 60,000 square feet of medical office space, 150,000 square feet of retail outparcels and a community amphitheater.\nA CBRE team led by Robert Given and Brad Capas marketed Galleria on behalf of the seller, Keystone-Florida Holding Corporation, led by president William O\u2019Connor.

The joint venture\u2019s purchase did not include a Dillard\u2019s department store building, which is separately owned, and a Macy\u2019s store that has a ground lease.\nKeystone-Florida\nunsuccessfully tried to redevelop Galeria Fort Lauderdale twice, most recently in 2022. The firm proposed a mixed-use project with at least 1,900 apartments on the 31.6-acre site. But the city of Fort Lauderdale did not approve it.\nThe property\u2019s current zoning allows for 60 units per acre, or a maximum of 1,899 units. The maximum height for buildings is 150 feet.\nKatherine Kallergis contributed reporting.\n",

The scale is unusual even for East Lake Shore Drive, where developer John Buck and his wife\noffloaded\ntheir 21-room co-op this spring at $4.9 million \u2014 less than half their original $11.5 million ask. Like the Bucks, the Farleys slashed their price before heading toward a deal, originally listing the 15-room, 14th floor apartment for just under $16 million in 2023. The most recent price\nslash\non the listing was in June.\nA sale is contingent, and a reminder that East Lake Shore Drive still commands top-dollar cachet,\nafter\nsome price-chopping. Jeff Lowe, the Compass agent who represented the sellers, said active interest in the property spiked this summer after the price chop. The property was put under contract Sept. 16.\nBill Farley, financier and former CEO of Fruit of the Loom, who now runs private equity firm Liam Ventures, told the Chicago Tribune in 2023 that the apartment is situated for lakeside views.\n\u201cThe ceilings are 11-feet high. There are these huge windows, and, of course, there are no obstructions, and these views are incredible, not just for Chicago but for any major city in America,\u201d Farley told the outlet.\nThe apartment also features six fireplaces, a custom-paneled library, an office, family room and a temperature-controlled wine room, as well as a gym, two guest apartments and four garage spaces.\n\nFarley, 82, was a larger-than-life CEO whose 15-year run atop Fruit of the Loom made him a staple of Chicago business lore. The New York Times once dubbed him the \u201chunky chief executive\u201d after he starred in his own underwear ads and floated political ambitions. At its peak, Fruit of the Loom was a $2 billion brand, but Farley was ousted in 1999 amid questions over lavish pay and poor factory oversight.\nThe Farleys previously owned, though never personally occupied, a 9,000-square-foot rehabbed Gold Coast mansion at the corner of Burton Place and Astor Street. The couple also keep a residence in Kennebunkport, Maine.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A three-story Greek revival mansion on Belvedere Island known as Locksley Hall has sold for $43.5 million, according to property records, or roughly $4,710 per square foot.\nThe 9,200-square-foot home, at 440 Golden Gate Avenue, went for $4 million less than the Marin County record price it last notched in 2015.\nThe seller is listed as Golden Gate Holdings LLC, and the buyer as Belvedere IFP Properties LLC.\nBefore selling the house in August 2015, mining magnate Robert Friedland and his wife, Darlene, spent 10 years and more than $30 million renovating the house, according to\nMarin Independent Journal\nand notes from the website of\nNeal Ward\n, now with Compass, who marketed the property in 2015. The couple sold the house for $47.5 million, which was less than the $49 million asking price, but it was believed to be the\nmost-expensive\nresidential transaction of all time in Marin County.\n\nBuilt in 1895 by a wealthy San Francisco banker, C.O. Perry, the home has five bedrooms and 8.5 bathrooms, a rose-cutting garden and a swimming pool with a vine-covered pergola. It features unobstructed 270-degree views of the San Francisco city skyline, the Golden Gate and Bay bridges, Angel Island and the bay.\nThe home\u2019s 9,235 square feet includes 8,155 square feet in the main residence, a 600-foot guest house and a 480-square-foot pool house, per floor plans on Ward\u2019s website.\n\u201cPeople in that price range are looking for specific things,\u201d Matt Hughes, president of the Marin Association of Realtors in 2015, told the Marin Independent Journal that year. \u201cLocksley is appealing because of its historic significance and its tax status.\u201d\nLocksley was restored to historical standards, qualifying it for the California Mills Act property tax reduction program, Hughes said.\n",

        "content": "The Austin suburb of Taylor is getting another infusion of cash into its $17 billion Samsung project, this time in the form of a state grant.\nThe company received a $250 million Texas Semiconductor Innovation Fund grant for the facility it\u2019s building in Taylor; the funding will support the ongoing development of the multibillion dollar chipmaking plant and nearby residential projects. Buildout of the campus will support about 12,000 construction jobs and bring more than 3,500 manufacturing jobs once the plant is up and running within the next five years, Connect CRE\nreported\n.\nIn 2021, the South Korean company announced that its\nsecond U.S. factory\nwould be in Taylor \u2014 a town of about 18,000 some 34 miles north of Austin in Williamson County. Since then, the prospect of the 6-million-square-foot factory has spurred\nresidential and commercial development\nin the area, known as the \u201c\nSamsung effect\n.\u201d\nAt the time, about\n$981 million in incentives\nfrom local and state authorities were used to lure the factory, including a 30-year property-tax abatement from the city. Samsung will still pay Taylor a projected $52 million in taxes, which will go into the city general fund. The company will also invest in about $6 million in buildings and $11 million in machinery in the town.\nAccording to a news release from Governor Greg Abbott\u2019s office, the state grant will help support \u201ca more secure domestic supply of chips for critical U.S. industries.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith approximately $40 billion invested in Texas, Samsung is helping to cement Texas\u2019 position as the leading state for semiconductor manufacturing, bringing in more business investment to Texas communities and creating thousands of good-paying jobs for hardworking Texans,\u201d Abbott said.\nAbbott signed the Texas CHIPS Act into law in 2023. The legislation established the grant program, aimed at growing the state\u2019s efforts in semiconductor design, research and manufacturing.\nWork on the facility should be complete in 2026.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Wednesday was an unparalleled day in recent memory of New York City real estate news.\nThe morning began with the bust-up of two casino bids in Manhattan. First, a Community Advisory Committee\nvoted 4-2\nto disapprove SL Green\u2019s pitch for a $5.4 billion casino in Times Square, meaning the proposal will not move on to the final round of the state\u2019s casino licensing competition.\nAfter the meeting was over, SL Green CEO Marc Holliday stood up and chastised the committee members, besides those appointed by the mayor and governor, the sole yes votes.\n\u201cWhat you did here today was a despicable display of cowardice, lack of leadership, lack of consideration for all the people who would benefit from this proposal,\u201d Holliday shouted at the members as they filed out of the room.\nMoments later, Holliday\u2019s firm was joined in rejection by Silverstein Properties.\nA six-member Community Advisory Committee\nrejected\nits proposal for a casino at a \u201cgiant hole in the ground\u201d on 41st Street and 11th Avenue, in a 4 to 2 vote.\nSilverstein, alongside Rush Street Gaming and Greenwood Gaming &amp; Entertainment, pitched the Avenir, a $7 billion casino complex planned for a long-vacant site. The project would have featured a 1,000-key Hyatt Hotel, as well as restaurants, bars and a 150-seat entertainment venue.\nThe developer also promised to fund the conversion of offices into 2,000 units of housing.\nThe dual rejections leave Soloviev Group as the lone casino competitor in Manhattan \u2014 the developer is slated to get a date before its CAC within the week.\n\nWednesday morning also brought the drama surrounding real estate investment trust Paramount Group to the forefront.\nRithm Capital\nagreed to acquire\nParamount Group for $1.6 billion, with plans to purchase the major office landlord\u2019s outstanding shares at $6.60 per diluted share.\nThe acquisition is a significant bet on the resurgence of office values, with Rithm CEO Michael Nierenberg expressing optimism about the office market and anticipated interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (more on that later).\nBut the deal comes amidst controversy surrounding Paramount Group\u2019s CEO, Albert Behler, including an SEC investigation into undisclosed payments and concerns about executive compensation and conflicts of interest.\nThe craze of the morning gave way to an afternoon with the development most likely to affect the largest swath of the industry: an interest rate cut.\nThe Federal Reserve\ncut its benchmark interest rate\nby a quarter point, the first such cut in nine months, though it was not as drastic as President Donald Trump desired.\nAhead of the meeting, real estate industry players aired their hopes that lower rates could stimulate commercial transactions and help address the housing affordability crisis.\nWhile mortgage rates recently dropped, they do not directly follow the Fed\u2019s interest rate changes and it\u2019s uncertain how much further they will fall.\nAnd all of that unfolded over the course of a few hours. Who said Wednesdays were boring?\n",

The purchaser was\nSimon Dushinsky\u2019s Rabsky Group\n, which earlier this year dropped almost $58 million on a neighboring lot at 360 Broadway, or 65 Franklin Street. Rabsky recently secured\n$320 million in construction financing\nfrom G4 Capital Partners for its development, a 280,000-square-foot condo project.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nIn the Concourse section of the Bronx, the\nBowery Residents\u2019 Committee\npaid $33.1 million to purchase three apartment complexes at\n1097 and 1177 Walton Avenue\nand\n1245 Findlay Avenue\n.

        "content": "New Yorkers have rent stabilization on the brain.\nIt\u2019s dominated headlines since the race for the city\u2019s next mayor kicked off last year, and\nZohran Mamdani\ncemented\nfreezing rents at these properties as a core tenet\nof his campaign ahead of his shock upset to clinch the\nDemocratic primary\n.\nMore New Yorkers are starting to wrap their heads around stabilization \u2014 a concept many outsiders long confused with ever-elusive rent-controlled units, a la Monica Geller\u2019s massive Greenwich Village apartment in \u201cFriends\u201d \u2014 and more are on the hunt to secure their own piece of the pie.\nData from OpenIgloo found that the share of users filtering for rent-stabilized apartment listings increased from just 10 percent in the summer months of 2024 to 35 percent the same time this year.\nThe platform recently launched its\nown map\nof rent-stabilized properties, which it claims is the first of its kind to track rent-regulated housing stock. Others are also jumping in on the action, including a startup called Realer Estate, which uses an algorithm to identify apartments that are likely rent-stabilized.\nFor lifelong or well-seasoned New Yorkers, the conversation about rent stabilization and its prevalence across the five boroughs is likely nothing new. Finding and keeping affordable apartments in a city that only continues to get more expensive (a bacon, egg and cheese in Manhattan can now run $11.50, according to\none Reddit user\n) is a quest many are all too familiar with.\nThe renewed conversation about rent-stabilization arising from the mayoral race is likely catching a fresh crop of New Yorkers (potentially transplants from other cities) up to the idea, especially as market-rate rents\ncontinue to rise\n.\nRent-burdened residents on the lookout for their own sweet deal might look to\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\ncoverage and see finding the rent-regulated apartment is only half the battle \u2014 what condition it will be in over your years of living in it is another, as rent-stabilized owners are\ngrappling with rising costs\nand falling income, making it difficult to keep up with necessary improvements.\nNot so fast\u2026\nThough Manhattan\u2019s trophy market is tumbling, luxury business in the suburbs is on the up-and-up.\n\nEarlier this week, hotelier Ian Schrager, known as the co-founder of Studio 54, listed his 12-acre estate in Westchester County for\n$7.5 million\n, up from its $5 million purchase price more than a decade ago.\nSchrager is seeking to offload the property on the tails of a hot streak in the tri-state area, which logged a three-year record deal in New Jersey, a top-dollar trade in the Hamptons and a boom in trophy sales in Greenwich, Connecticut.\nIn the wealthy enclave of Alpine, a Versailles-inspired mansion sold last week for\nnearly $18 million\n, marking the priciest deal in New Jersey since 2022. The deal for the seven-bedroom home grabbed headlines even though it fell short of its initial asking price of $25 million when it hit the market four years ago.\nIn East Hampton, video game developer Matthew Karch dropped\n$32 million\non an oceanfront home on Lily Pond Lane. The deal marked the first for the property since the sellers, Norman and Helene Stark, bought it for $5 million in 1994. The Starks originally sought $75 million for the two-acre estate in 2017, though they later cut the asking price to $39 million.\nMeanwhile, Greenwich\u2019s luxury market\nlogged 25 deals\nexceeding $10 million since the start of the year, the most recorded since 1999. With so many sales already on the books this year, some anticipate the affluent Connecticut town could double its total from last year by the end of 2025.\nHowever, Manhattan\u2019s luxury market is charting a different course. Last week, the borough saw\njust 11 homes\nasking $4 million or more enter contract with zero of the properties asking more than $10 million. The slump came after four weeks of declining totals, though the Labor Day holiday likely contributed to the drop off.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe priciest deal to land in city records this week was for a co-op on the Upper East Side, which traded for $18 million. Investor Steven Wisch and his wife, filmmaker Debra Wisch, sold Unit 10 at\n1125 Fifth Avenue\n, where actress Bette Midler and Disney\u2019s Bob Iger once owned apartments, to a trust tied to a Westport, Connecticut, address.\nThe full-floor co-op spans roughly 4,600 square feet and has four bedrooms and four bathrooms. Douglas Elliman\u2019s Sabrina Saltiel had the listing.\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s a strange day when a state agency proposes a court order restricting itself.\nBut that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened at the Office of Cannabis Management, in a situation that lays bare the mismanagement and ineptitude at the heart of New York\u2019s dispensary rollout.\nNew Yorkers often complain about bureaucratic incompetence, but OCM seems to have other agencies beat.\nIn its most recent scandal, the office came out and said it had been enforcing the law incorrectly. As a result, 152 planned or approved cannabis dispensaries may have to close or relocate. Eighty-four percent of those are in New York City.\nAt issue was how the office had been measuring the distance between dispensaries and schools and other locations. Instead of measuring from the property line, as required by law, OCM had been measuring from the front entrance.\n\u201cWhen I found out about it, I was very angry, to say the least,\u201d Gov. Kathy Hochul\nsaid last month\n. \u201cThat\u2019s a major screw up.\u201d\nA group of affected dispensaries, including nonprofit darling Housing Works, sued OCM and the Cannabis Control Board to stop the change. A judge denied the motion for a temporary restraining order without explanation.\nThat brings us up to last week, when state attorneys for OCM, clearly feeling the heat, proposed an order granting the plaintiffs\u2019 preliminary injunction.\n\u201cPlease order us to go back to the old standards,\u201d the attorneys are essentially saying. As of Friday at 4 p.m., the order has not been signed.\nIt\u2019s possible that the office is negotiating a settlement with the plaintiffs. OCM and its lawyers at the attorney general\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nIf you\u2019ve been following the cannabis rollout for any amount of time, this saga may not come as a shock. Since its inception, OCM has struggled to turn mission-driven platitudes into a functioning regulatory regime.\nLast year, the state issued a scathing internal review of the agency. Among the charges: Inexperienced leadership ran the agency like a policy startup. The report found that OCM required many dispensary applicants to execute a lease or purchase a property to apply for a license, while simultaneously having no intention of reviewing all the applications it received.\nWith this latest blunder, absent any court order or amended legislation, already-approved dispensaries will need to relocate. The Governor and office plan to introduce legislation to fix the issue, but the legislature is away until January. And it\u2019s uncertain what state lawmakers will agree to.\nOCM has offered up to $250,000 in relief to affected applicants who were approved but not given final licenses.\nBut in the world of commercial real estate, especially for businesses operating in violation of federal law, that\u2019s not a lot of money. Landlords taking a risk working with dispensaries typically want premium rent in return.\n\u201cThere are so many things that go into locking down real estate, particularly in New York and particularly in an industry that\u2019s so highly regulated and volatile,\u201d said Fatima Afia, a cannabis lawyer at Rudick Law Group. \u201c$250,000 doesn\u2019t really cover much of anything for the folks who have gone through a lot of the process already to lock down a lease and maybe sign a personal guarantee.\u201d\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nHow are retail landlords thinking about dispensaries, both legal and, uh, unofficial? Drop me a line at\nlilah.burke@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nNew York has a professional bull riding team, the Mavericks. Last year, the team made its debut in the Professional Bull Riding league at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. They started this season on Thursday at UBS Arena in Elmont, New York and are there until Saturday.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014\nMayor Adams\u2019 office released a\nreport\nFriday on the economic benefits of each casino proposal vying for a downstate license. The plan from Soloviev, which is slated for a committee vote on Monday, bested the others when it came to job creation numbers, with 17,907 direct construction jobs and 2,736 permanent jobs. The proposal by Mets owner Steve Cohen outside Citi Field, however, topped the list for tax revenue.\n\u2014 The mayor has been running a \u201chard on crime\u201d re-election campaign. But although crime categories may be down year over year, they are still significantly up compared to 2019, the New York Times\nnoted\n. Murders are up 22 percent, felony assaults are up 30 percent and car thefts have more than doubled.\n\u2014 The MTA is moving to acquire more lots through eminent domain for its Second Avenue Subway expansion, the City\nreported\n.\nClosing time:\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$10 million\nfor a co-op unit at 1120 Fifth Avenue in Lenox Hill. Tod Mercy and Jamaal Redon of The Corcoran Group\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$47.5 million\nfor a 9,555-square-foot piece of vacant land at 358 Broadway in Tribeca.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$20 million\nfor a 5,344-square-foot townhouse at 238 West 11th Street in the West Village. Roberta Golubock with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has the listing.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s office vacancy rate has never been higher, but the market tells two very different stories. Companies hunting for high-rise space in trophy towers are finding competition fierce and rents rising, even as older buildings drown in availability.\nDowntown\u2019s overall direct vacancy hit 24.3 percent midway through the year, but much of that space was either outdated or controlled by landlords too tied up with debt to make competitive deals, Crain\u2019s\nreported\nciting data from Colliers. Strip the\ndata\ndown to the market\u2019s best properties, and the supply picture changes dramatically: Class A availability is 19 percent, trophy buildings are at 11.4 percent, and on floors above the 25th level, vacancy drops to just 8.4 percent.\nThat\u2019s what Goldman Ismail Tomaselli Brennan &amp; Baum discovered when the firm went looking for space last year. Partner Andrew Rima expected a tenant\u2019s market with pandemic-era bargains but instead faced a crowded field for well-located, modern offices. The firm ended up taking a floor-and-a-half at 191 North Wacker Drive.\n\u201cIt was more competitive than the headlines suggested,\u201d Rima told the outlet.\nAverage gross asking rents across downtown have barely budged since 2020, according to Colliers. At the top end, however, trophy rents have soared 26 percent to nearly $66 per square foot per year. For a small office footprint of 2,000 square feet, that\u2019s a base of $11,000 a month.\n\nSpace in the city\u2019s priciest towers \u2014 110 North Wacker Drive, 150 North Riverside Plaza and 444 West Lake Street \u2014 is hitting $80 to $90 per foot with taxes and expenses included, brokers say. Meanwhile, tenants at older Class B towers can still strike renewals for less than half that cost.\nThat split is shaping a stampede. Buildings like 155 and 191 North Wacker Drive and 300 North LaSalle Street have soaked up swaths of vacancy as firms\njockey\nfor well-located, modern space that will coax employees back in person. Even renewals are competitive, with multiple tenants circling the same suites, Colliers\u2019 vice chair David Burden told the outlet.\nGenerous concessions are common among landlords, such as free rent, cash for build-outs and other perks, especially for creditworthy firms willing to sign long leases. That restraint stems partly from lingering uncertainty about shrinking\nfootprints\nand leasing volumes well below pre-pandemic levels. Many landlords are cutting office space out of the market with an\nuptick\nin office-to-residential conversion projects in the works.\nDevelopers are even testing the waters for new towers. Related Midwest, Hines and John Buck are all shopping plans for West Loop high-rises that would require pre-leases at more than $100 per foot to land financing.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Neiman Marcus is bowing out of The Shops at Willow Bend, ending more than two decades in Plano.\nSaks Global, which acquired Neiman in last year\u2019s $2.7 billion merger, sold the three-floor, 150,000-square-foot anchor site at 2201 Dallas Parkway to Dallas-based real estate developer Centennial, the mall\u2019s owner and redeveloper, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. The store will be open until January.\nIt\u2019s a symbolic blow to the luxury brand and the struggling 1.4 million-square-foot shopping center, the last enclosed mall built in Texas. Willow Bend debuted in 2001 with Neiman\u2019s as the anchor but has been plagued by sluggish traffic despite heavy, multi-million dollar reinvestment over the years.\nCentennial, which bought the property in 2022, has been working on a multi-year redevelopment strategy, pivoting to\nmixed-use\nafter Macy\u2019s announced earlier this year it would close its Willow Bend location as part of a broader retrenchment.\nThe redevelopment is expected to take years and include apartments, hotel, office, restaurants, retail and townhomes. Plano city officials gave their stamp of approval on the project earlier this year.\n\nThe metroplex is a core market for Neiman Marcus, with stores at NorthPark Center, Downtown Dallas and in Fort Worth, Saks Global said. But each is under review. The historic downtown flagship narrowly\navoided\na March shutdown after tense lease negotiations, and Saks has\npledged\na \u201creimagination\u201d of that site alongside upgrades at NorthPark.\nCompany officials framed the Plano exit as part of aligning with Centennial\u2019s vision for the property. Employees will be offered transfers to other stores or separation packages.\nCentennial is pitching its overhaul of Willow Bend as a way to finally make the shopping center relevant to the surrounding community. The loss of another anchor might make the redevelopment push more urgent \u2014 and potentially easier, as it clears the way for a large-scale reset of the site.\nCentennial is also in the second phase of a $252 million\nredevelopment\nof the 1970s-era Hawthorn Mall in the Chicago suburb of Vernon Hills.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Ray Washburne is set to squeeze more money out of the City of Dallas by way of a land deal for its planned $3.5 billion convention center redevelopment.\nThe Highland Park Village owner already sold the former Dallas Morning News headquarters at 508 Young Street to the city for $45.1 million earlier this summer, outplaying city management with a\ngambit\nto sell it to a data center operator. He paid $28 million for the property in 2019, putting the gain at 46 percent minus holding costs over six years.\nNow the city wants another piece of the former Dallas Morning News property that Washburne owns, and it\u2019s\ntrying to take it by eminent domain\n. City attorneys filed a \u201ccondemnation\u201d lawsuit over the 36,000-square-foot parcel, a parking lot between the old newspaper building and WFAA\u2019s headquarters, after the city couldn\u2019t strike a $6.5 million deal that would\u2019ve paid Washburne $181 per square foot for the parcel, which was included in his $28 million purchase.\nEminent domain cases are supposed to find the fair market value of property that a government entity wants to buy. Recent high-profile examples include the Alamo Trust and City of San Antonio\u2019s effort to seize a bar near the Alamo by eminent domain. In that case, Vince Cantu, the former owner of\nMoses Rose\u2019s Hideout\n, was paid $6.75 million in the city\u2019s eminent domain lawsuit after he rejected offers of $4 million and $6 million.\nTo Washburne, who recently\ncombined his family real estate office\nwith his wife\u2019s, $750,000 would be a rounding error. But the holdout is a major power play for the charismatic businessman.\nHere\u2019s what else happened in Texas real estate this week.\n\nWho doesn\u2019t want an\nH-E-B supermarket\nin their backyard? These neighbors in Northeast Dallas who say the proposed lot the San Antonio-based grocer wants to build on is too small and the development will cause too much traffic.\nThe Texas Legislature deregulated\n\u201cAg shacks\u201d\nin College Station, overriding a local ordinance that aimed to limit how many students can live in one house.\nA historic ranch outfitted for cutting horses hit the market recently for $21 million. The\n900-acre property in Bosque County\n, about an hour and a half from Dallas, was the homestead of James \u201cBuck\u201d Barry, a Texas Ranger, Confederate veteran and former state legislator.\nThe battle over Texas\u2019 law banning \u201ctraveling\u201d housing finance corporations\ngot messier\n.\nA Denver-based investor expanded its\n\u201cRodeo Belt\u201d multifamily portfolio\nwith a purchase in Austin, where there is hope that the apartment slump could swing back in a couple of years.\nMeanwhile in Cowtown, the first condos in the Seven at Bowie House, an Auberge-branded property in Fort Worth\u2019s Cultural District, are\nhitting the market\n. A unit in the development is listed for $5.5 million, or $2,000 per square foot.\n",

        "content": "He may be pushing 90, but Harry Macklowe is still mad for real estate.\nThe prolific developer just closed a deal to redevelop a 1920s-era apartment building on Madison Avenue into ultraluxury condos. Macklowe bought the limestone and brick building at\n809 Madison\non the Upper East Side\u2019s \u201cGold Coast\u201d from Churchill Real Estate Holdings for $49 million, sources told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThat\u2019s a discount from the $55 million Churchill originally paid for the building in 2019, likely because it\u2019s a tricky project that\u2019s befuddled potential developers for a few years. The building, at the corner of East 68th Street, sits within the Upper East Side historic district and any changes to it would require approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission.\nMacklowe was able to get the LPC on board with his plans, sources said, which include using air rights he acquired to expand the building and convert it into large, 4,000-square-foot single-floor apartments. There will also be an expansive penthouse with a 1,500-square-foot terrace.\nHe is partnering with Abe and Scott Shnay\u2019s SK Development on the conversion, which will be designed by Robert A.M. Stern and SLCE Architects. Apartments are expected to sell for more than $20 million.\nRepresentatives for Macklowe and Churchill could not be immediately reached for comment..\nInfinite Global Partners, led by former Silverstein Properties CEO Marty Burger, and Related Funds provided a construction loan. Sculptor Capital Management and Circle Property Partners are providing preferred equity, and a handful of family offices, small funds and ultra-high-net-worth investors are coming in as limited partners.\n\nMichael Campbell of the Carlton Group arranged the financing.\nMacklowe, who turned 88 in August, last kicked off a new Manhattan development project a decade ago when he bought One Wall Street for $585 million. The $2 billion conversion project has had its ups and downs, and after a period of slow sales has seen\nan increase in contracts\n.\nEarlier this year, he sold a Midtown office building that had been part of his Tower Fifth development site, apparently relinquishing his long-held plan to develop a supertall office tower on the site.\nYet while things may be a bit slower on the development front, he certainly hasn\u2019t been quiet. Macklowe\u2019s grabbed headlines with a high-profile divorce in 2018 and a lengthy\nlegal battle\nwith CIM Group, his partner on 432 Park.\nHe sued the Israel Discount Bank of New York earlier this year, trying to stop the lender from foreclosing on his stakes in a pair of real estate investment trusts.\nIn Florida, he\u2019s partnering with Jorge P\u00e9rez\u2019s Related Group to build a\ntwo-tower condo project\nin North Bay Village.\n",

        "content": "The desolate and distressed\nSan Francisco Centre\n, once a Westfield mall before its owners handed back the keys, stands in stark contrast to Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield\u2019s outdoor shopping center in Century City.\nThe San Francisco mall, owned by Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield and Brookfield Properties until the two entities stopped making payments on a $558 million note and then bailed, is now worth less than $200 million.\nThat means the shopping center is worth a billion dollars less than it was nine years ago. It isn\u2019t hard to see why: the 1.5 million square foot retail spot is only seven percent occupied. And the lender wants the shopping complex off its books and to recoup some of what it is owed immediately, per special servicer commentary.\nThe Westfield Century City doesn\u2019t compare. Its owner was recently\nset to close\na $925 million commercial mortgage-backed securities refinancing \u2014 and an appraisal a couple months ago put the Los Angeles mall\u2019s value at $2 billion. Plus, it is nearly 96 percent occupied.\nTime to surrender?\nDoes Rockwood Capital have time to save the Santa Monica Clock Tower? That\u2019s the question\nThe Real Deal\nposed last month after learning the Art Deco office building that was once the city\u2019s largest skyscraper saw its\nvalue slashed\nand its debt land in special servicing.\nBut it appears Rockwood is ready to surrender. Special servicer commentary said: \u201cBorrower has expressed interest to transfer title back to the Lender,\u201d per Morningstar Credit.\nThe century-old Santa Monica Clock Tower was recently appraised at $27.4 million compared to $49 million at loan issuance. That was after the $26.7 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan connected to the offices went to\nspecial servicing\nand missed its maturity date.\nOccupancy declined to 43 percent earlier this year compared to 100 percent at loan underwriting a decade ago \u2014 and the around 50,000 square foot property is not making enough money to pay off its debt.\n\nStill, handing the keys back may not be a done deal. The special servicer said it was evaluating all options.\nBuyer revealed\nWe knew Tishman Speyer was\nselling\na Beverly Hills office building for more than $200 million when we published the scoop earlier in the summer, but the buyer was a mystery. Now we know it is none other than Kilroy Realty \u2014 and according to a person familiar, the deal, coming out to about $707 a square foot, was a competitive process.\nThe publicly traded real estate investment trust\npurchased\nthe offices for $205.3 million \u2014 a debut in the affluent area for Los Angeles-based Kilroy Realty, and an exit for Tishman Speyers from a trio of Beverly Hills office properties purchased two decades ago. Tishman Speyer cashed in all three in the past year or so, all at a profit.\nThe latest, Maple Plaza, which was 75 percent leased, Kilroy Realty purchased via cash on hand and recent disposition proceeds. This comes after Kilroy Realty sold a Santa Monica office building for $40 million and teased another sale at a similar price next year during second quarter earnings.\nOn the scene\nCommercial real estate executives gathered for back-to-back events this week: a\nTRD\nroundtable conversation led by Editor-in-Chief Stuart Elliott and dinner at Mother Wolf Tuesday evening and a Bisnow conference the next morning downtown.\nTRD\u2019s\npanelists \u2014 Cityview\u2019s Sean Burton, Cain International\u2019s Larry Green, and Christie\u2019s International Real Estate\u2019s Aaron Kirman \u2014 discussed whether the tariff bark is worse than bite, Measure ULA pain and more (video coming soon, so stay tuned). Developer Leo Pustilnikov made an appearance at both events.\nThe other event \u2014 on the gutted 23rd floor of 601 S. Figueroa, the office tower Uncommon Developers\npurchased\nfrom Brookfield Properties for $210 million earlier this year \u2014 at times felt like a marketing opportunity and maybe could have focused more on downtown\u2019s homelessness problem but still offered thoughtful insights.\n",

The California-based seller had sunk $30 million into repositioning the 600,000-square-foot asset it picked up out of an eight-year-long bout with distress for $33 million.\nOn the South Side,\ninvestor Eliazer Tauber\n, who\u2019s tied to\nindicted New York attorney Mark Nussbaum\n, is facing $10 million in foreclosure suits. The complaints deepen questions about Tauber\u2019s financing web, which includes dozens of distressed multifamily properties.\nElsewhere on the South Side,\nChikoo Patel\u2019s multifamily firm CKO Real Estate\ncontinues to unravel. American Express filed suit against him this week, adding to a pile of lender claims targeting his troubled portfolio of properties throughout Illinois.\n\nDevelopment tensions are flaring on the North Side, where Edgewater and Uptown residents are\nplastering billboards and threatening lawsuits\nover a proposed Broadway upzoning. The measure would allow taller buildings and more commercial uses along the corridor, drawing fire from homeowners wary of density creep.\nIn Evanston, Will Hunter and Evan Meador\u2019s firm\nContinuum paid $31 million for the Church Street Plaza site\n, where it plans a 27-story apartment tower.\nT2 Capital\nprovided a $27 million loan for the deal, moving the long-discussed redevelopment closer to reality.\nMore luxury homeowners are feeling like\nnow is the time to test the market in Lake Geneva\n, where a waterfront mansion just hit the market at $8.5 million. The listing comes on the heels of\ntwo other lakefront homes that asked just under $10 million\nand found buyers within days. Sellers have increasingly\nfavored whispered, off-market dealmaking\nin the vacation-home enclave, making the public listing a relative rarity.\nBack in the Loop,\nBlackstone and its lender CWCapital\nare threatening to sue over a $184 million residential conversion plan at the Clark Adams Building. The firms, which control the hotel portion of the property, argue the proposal risks their collateral. It sets up a second high-stakes clash over the adaptive reuse plan following\na lawsuit recently filed\nby the previous partners of one of the office portion\u2019s owners, Primera Group, alleging they were cut out of the property.",

        "content": "It\u2019s a match made in Bay Area commercial real estate heaven for Maven Commercial and Goldman Limited.\nThe two CRE players merged this week, bringing Goldman Limited founder Nadine Whisnant over to Maven as principal. The new company will retain the\nMaven Commercial\nname.\nThe merger marks a significant expansion for retail leasing leader Maven Commercial in the\nEast Bay\nand Bay Area markets. Whisnant will work out of Maven\u2019s San Francisco headquarters, though she\u2019ll continue to fully operate in the East Bay as she has before, a representative for the company told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nMaven has 30 employees, and no positions will be eliminated. Whether there will be any consolidation in office space remains to be seen.\nThe executive team at Maven includes co-founders and principals Santino DeRose and Pam Mendelsohn as well as principal Catherine Meunier and Chicago team leader Lorraine Adney.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked alongside Nadine on many transactions and consistently found a natural alignment in how we approach clients and the business. Her depth of knowledge in the East Bay and throughout the greater Bay Area makes this an exciting opportunity to grow together,\u201d DeRose told\nThe Real Deal\n, touting Whisnant\u2019s \u201cstrong relationships with both well-known retailers and restaurateurs as well as with landlords.\u201d\nWhisnant founded Goldman Limited in 2000. Maven, founded in 2010 and expanding into Chicago in 2021, maintains a presence in upscale San Francisco retail neighborhoods like Hayes Valley, Cow Hollow, Upper Fillmore and\nUnion Square\n. The merger with Goldman will increase its presence in East Bay markets like\nBerkeley\n, Walnut Creek, Alameda and Lafayette.\nFarewell to a titan\nBay Area real estate mogul and prolific philanthropist\nThaddeus \u201cTad\u201d Taube\nhas died at the age of 94. The Polish-born giant died at his home in San Mateo County.\nTaube co-founded The Woodmont Companies, which went on to become one of the largest privately owned investment real estate companies on the West Coast.\nIn subsequent decades, he worked toward charitable causes through his Koret Foundation. In his home country, Taube founded and helped fund the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews in\nWarsaw\n.\nAcross the Bay Area, Taube funded projects such as an upgrade of the San Francisco Opera\u2019s performance space and the reinstallation of the Bay Bridge\u2019s \u201cBay Lights.\u201d He supported Stanford University athletics through the construction of the Taube Family Tennis Stadium and launched programs to connect at-risk youth with professional sports teams in the region. He also invested in health care initiatives like the Neurodegenerative Disease Research Collaborative and the Tad and Dianne Taube Pavilion at Stanford\u2019s children\u2019s hospital and efforts to address youth addiction, concussions, pediatric cancer and maternal and mental health.\n\u201cIf you were to draw a road map of my life, it would have multiple forks,\u201d he once said. \u201cI often find myself driving along several paths at the same time.\u201d\nEverything\u2019s coming up roses?\n\nSix years after its application for construction was approved, Kilroy Realty is offering a bouquet of different flowers for its\nplanned redevelopment\nof the old San Francisco Flower Market.\nThe Los Angeles-based firm filed a new application with a handful of options for development at the Central South of Market site that would increase housing and office capacity.\nOne version calls for five buildings with roughly 2.6 million square feet of office or lab space, up to 100,000 square feet of retail space, 300,000 square feet of institutional space and more than 800 parking spots. Another would apply the\nstate density bonus law\nto build seven buildings containing a total of 3,532 new homes as well as 100,000 square feet of retail space and more than 1,800 parking spaces.\nThe \u201cMixed-Use Variant\u201d would have 1,242 housing units as well as 1.5 million square feet of office or lab space, 100,000 square feet of commercial space and more than 1,000 parking spaces in five buildings, while the \u201cInstitutional Variant\u201d\u00a0 proposes roughly 1.4 million square feet of medical or institutional space, 1.2 million square feet for office and lab tenants, plus 100,000 square feet of retail and 431 parking spaces across five buildings.\nLivin\u2019 at the car wash\nA long-languishing\ncar wash in Lower Haight\ncould finally be scrubbed away in favor of residences.\nSan Francisco Supervisor Bilal Mahmood introduced legislation that would allow building projects to follow the code in place at the time a proposal application was initially filed, clearing the way for Irvine-based developer 4Terra Investments to move forward with its planned six-story, 203-unit building at 400 Divisadero Street, approved in 2017.\nThe\nTouchless Car Wash project\nhas been seemingly dead in the soapy water for nine years; building codes related to mechanical, electrical, plumbing, structural and energy change every three years. As a result, 4Terra has had to redesign its plans since it originally filed them.\nBy using the regulations in place in 2016, 4Terra is projected to save approximately $4 million on the project.\nA lucky break\nLast week\u2019s passage of Senate Bill 79 in the California legislature included a carveout affecting just one county in the whole state: Contra Costa.\nState Sen. Scott Wiener\u2019s SB 79 will only apply to counties with more than 15 high-frequency train or bus stops, leaving just seven counties in the whole state subject to the upzoning legislation; in the Bay Area, that includes Alameda, San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties.\nContra Costa County\navoided\nSB 79\u2019s enforcement with exactly 15 stations falling under the bill\u2019s permission for high-density zoning, including 12 Bay Area Rapid Transit stations and three Amtrak stations in Richmond, Martinez and Antioch.\nThe NIMBY win came after the Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors and city councilmembers in Lafayette and Orinda\nlobbied state lawmakers\nto advance the amendment, arguing that SB 79 would increase density along fire evacuation zones and put residents at risk.\n",

        "content": "The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point.\nThe reduction is not as substantial as some hoped, and it had already been priced into mortgage rates by the time the\nannouncement\nwas made last week.\nThe remaining market foe is inflation. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s causing the stickiness around long-term rates,\u201d said Robert Palmer, founder and CEO of LPT Realty, a Florida brokerage firm.\nStill, a drop is good news.\n\u201cRates are still better than they have been. I think the hope was we were going to see a sharp drop happening. We didn\u2019t get that,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need much more clear inflation data to drive down rates to the level that most consumers want.\u201d\nOverall, the rate cut will bring more buyers to the market. But first-time home buyers will just face more competition in a market that has a very limited supply of affordable homes.\nAna Bozovic, market analyst and broker-owner of Analytics Miami, wrote in her newsletter that wealth migration remains the driving force behind the real estate market\u2019s success.\n\u201cEven with [Fed chairman Jerome] Powell acknowledging inflation concerns, the likely trajectory is continued rate cuts. That means more liquidity, more buyers, and more momentum flowing directly into Miami real estate,\u201d she wrote.\nReal estate brokers tell me that even though mortgage rates aren\u2019t and won\u2019t be close to the high 2 percent and low 3 percent range seen just a few years ago, they do expect this cut to have a psychological effect.\nTop agents are also ready to pounce on ultra-wealthy buyers keeping an eye on whether Zohran Mamdani wins in New York in November.\nThe interest rate cuts, \u201cthey\u2019re going to help us even more,\u201d top broker Dora Puig says. \u201cAnd then let\u2019s watch what happens in New York with the mayoral campaign.\u201d\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWho bought the\nnon-waterfront house\nat 2301 North Bay Road?

        "content": "It goes without saying, but pictures or social media posts aren\u2019t always worth 1,000 words.\nThat rang particularly true this past week on a ride through parts of the Palisades with local brokerage owner Anthony Marguleas, founder of Amalfi Estates.\nThe takeaway: Anyone peddling only photos of uncleared, burned lots is selling a dated sense of reality. Construction is now the story for the Palisades as more and more builders enter the scene.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much misinformation,\u201d Marguleas told\nThe Real Deal\n(find more from that conversation in our upcoming October issue of the magazine). \u201cThere are a couple people online that are so politically charged, and I\u2019m not going to talk about the whole political conversation, but there\u2019s a couple individuals who are so anti-Mayor [Karen] Bass and so anti-[Gov. Gavin] Newsom and so conspiracy theorist. All I care about is our town being rebuilt.\u201d\nHe ticked off several items to dispute, but at the top of the list was the subject of permitting.\nCritics of Bass have long accused the city of a sluggish rebuild. Part of that may have been fueled in the early days beginning with the lack of clarity around a\ncontract\nawarded to the Chicago outfit\nHagerty Consulting\nin February for as much as $10 million. Questions around that still stand.\nHowever, in the community\u2019s Alphabet Streets alone, an increasing number of lots now bear frames of homes or are wrapped with the names of builders who are working.\nAs of Friday morning, there were 569 permits issued by the city of Los Angeles for 336 addresses, according to the Department of Building and Safety online dashboard. Another 720 plans have been approved with 769 in review.\nFor Marguleas, more of that information should be the norm rather than the noise of those shooting from the hip.\n\u201cI love data. Everything I have is backed up with data,\u201d Marguleas said. \u201cA lot of agents are just kind of willy-nilly with it, but everything I have is data.\u201d\nSamara\u2019s rebuild work\nNot a lot has been revealed on the progress of Steadfast LA and Airbnb spinoff Samara\u2019s planned donations to survivors of January\u2019s Palisades and Eaton fires since the February announcement of their partnership.\nIt took some time for homeowners to make decisions about whether they would stay or leave, for starters, Samara co-founder and CEO\nMike McNamara\ntold\nTRD\non Thursday. There have also been the more pragmatic realities, such as determining whether one of Samara\u2019s factory-made accessory dwelling units are the right fit for a lot.\nThe first home recipients, residing in Pasadena and Altadena, have been selected, and Samara\u2019s now moving forward on permitting, the CEO said.\n\nSamara closed $34 million in Series B funding led by Thrive Capital, which McNamara said is \u201cgrowth capital\u201d as the firm faces demand from wildfire survivors, multi-generational households and multifamily property owners.\nBig deal\nSome might cheer Friday afternoon\u2019s $44 million closing of a Brentwood estate as being yet another market bright spot following the January fires.\nThe deal on the home at 11740 Crescenda Street, which was named \u201cOcho Manos\u201d by its former owners, sold to a mystery buyer represented by the Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Michael Fahimian and Jack Harris.\nThe sellers, financier and Milwaukee Brewers minority owner Robert Beyer and his wife Catherine Beyer, had the 20,000-square-foot home custom built and reportedly sought $75 million for it in 2023. It was most recently listed for $54.9 million.\nCarolwood Estates co-founder and CEO Drew Fenton, along with Andrew Beyer, were the listing agents.\nThe closing makes Ocho Manos Brentwood\u2019s most-expensive sale since the off-market trade of 13058 Rivers Road in Brentwood. That property sold for $56.6 million in December 2021. Fenton was also the listing agent there, along with Compass\u2019 David Kramer. Tracy Tutor, now of Compass, represented the buyer.\n$110M hits peak popularity\nIf Bel-Air and Holmby Hills can do it, why not Malibu? The \u201cit\u201d in this would be closing on a $110 million home sale this year.\nSpelling Manor at\n594 South Mapleton Drive\nin Holmby Hills and\n630 Nimes Road\nin Bel-Air are tied for this year\u2019s priciest residential sales in Los Angeles County, with both estates going for $110 million.\nNow, the owners of 6962 Wildlife Road in Malibu are testing the price point in the seaside community, with the over 7,000-square-foot residence entering the market on Friday. The asking price is $15,530 per square foot.\nThe property \u2014 at one time owned by the king of late night, Johnny Carson \u2014 is\nreportedly\nbeing sold by August Tigrett, whose father Isaac Tigrett founded Hard Rock Cafe and House of Blues, and her husband Riaz Valani, the first investor in electronic cigarette maker Juul.\nIf sold, the home would be a big headline for Malibu after the $80 million sale of\n28719 Grayfox Street\n, which was recorded by the Los Angeles County Recorder\u2019s Office in late July.\n",

        "content": "Manhattan\u2019s debt markets didn\u2019t slow down in August as some of the city\u2019s biggest landlords lined up billions in fresh financing.\nThree blockbuster office refinancings topped the month\u2019s largest loans, led by the Durst Organization\u2019s\n$1.3 billion deal\nfor its Times Square tower. Paramount Group landed a $900 million loan for its Sixth Avenue tower just before the office landlord was\nsold to the highest bidder\n. On the residential side, lenders doled out dollars to Miki Naftali and Josh Gotlib and Meyer Orbach\u2019s recently-launched REIT.\nTogether, the deals totaled more than $4 billion and underscored lenders\u2019 appetite for prime Manhattan real estate. Here are the top five loans in Manhattan.\nDurst debt | $1.3B | Midtown\nWells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America\noriginated a $1.3 billion CMBS loan for the Durst Organization\u2019s One Five One office tower in Times Square. The loan, carrying a 6.1 percent interest rate, will pay off roughly $1.1 billion in existing debt on the 1.8 million-square-foot tower at 151 West 42nd Street. It will fund nearly $40 million in reserves and closing costs, according to an S&amp;P Global report.\nThe deal includes a $719 million \u201cA\u201d note that earned a preliminary AAA rating from S&amp;P on the back of Durst\u2019s financial strength and the tower\u2019s performance. Remaining capital will go toward tenant improvements, leasing costs and a $146 million equity payout to the landlord. The fresh financing replaced\na $900 million refinancing\nfrom JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo from 2019. The tower, formerly known as 4 Times Square, is 92 percent leased. TikTok is the anchor tenant and occupies 232,000 square feet.\nParamount payday | $900M | Midtown\n\nMorgan Stanley and Wells Fargo\nprovided a $900 million loan for Paramount Group\u2019s 45-story office tower at 1301 Sixth Avenue. The loan replaced a $710 million loan from Morgan Stanley that was set to mature in 2026. The refi came after law firm Piper Sandler signed a 140,000-square-foot lease and law firm Adler &amp; Stachenfeld took 40,000 square feet, bringing the building to 97 percent occupancy. The building will soon be owned by New York City-based Rithm Capital, which won a bidding war for Paramount after shareholders raised concerns over the real estate investment trust\u2019s performance and management.\nApollo landing | $785M | Midtown\nApollo Global Management\nprovided a $785 million loan to finance RXR\u2019s $1.08 billion purchase of 590 Madison Avenue. RXR bought the Plaza District office tower for $1.08 billion from the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio. Scott Rechler\u2019s firm partnered with Elliott Investment Management and Baupost Group on the deal. The final debt package is broken down into a $650 million senior loan, a $135 million mezzanine loan and about $60 million in future funding commitments for things like tenant improvements and leasing costs. Eastdil Secured\u2019s Grant Frankel arranged the debt.\nNaftali knockdown | $675M | Upper East Side\nJPMorgan Chase\nprovided a $675 million loan for Miki Naftali\u2019s purchase of the 33-story 800 Fifth Avenue rental building from Eliot Spitzer and the Winter Organization. Naftali agreed to buy the 208-unit building last March for more than $800 million, which works out to about $2,400 per square foot. He plans to tear down the existing building and replace it with a new tower. Newmark\u2019s Jordan Roeschlaub and Nick Scribani arranged the debt.\nCopper cash | $525M | Murray Hill\nArbor Realty Trust\nprovided a $525 million loan for the Copper Apartments, a pair of luxury apartment towers owned by Josh Gotlib and Meyer Orbach\u2019s GO Residential REIT.\u00a0 The fresh financing for the 761-unit property at 616-626 First Avenue in Murray Hill replaced a $611.5 million CMBS loan. Gotlib and Orbach bought the buildings in 2022 for $837 million. They launched their real estate investment trust this summer, listing it on the Toronto Stock Exchange with a $2.7 billion multifamily portfolio of more than 2,000 units.\n",

You can see the top 10\u00a0 by clicking here.\nAthens, Georgia-based Landmark Properties partnered with investment management firm Stockbridge in late April to acquire the two buildings, Icon Plaza at 3584 South Figueroa Street, and West 27th Place, at 2700 South Figueroa Street, in a deal brokered by TSB Realty. The former, erected in 2012 with 57 units and 252 beds sold for $51.5 million, and the latter, built in 2010 with 161 units and 452 beds, went for $48.5 million.\n\u201cGiven that approximately 81 percent of USC students require off-campus options, Icon Plaza and West 27th Place are ideally situated to deliver vital, purpose-built student housing,\u201d JD Goering, senior vice president of acquisitions at Landmark, said in a news release about the deal. The two properties are within walking distance to USC\u2019s main academic and recreational buildings.\nLandmark committed to renovating common areas and amenities at the Icon Plaza. No major updates were planned for West 27th as it was recently renovated.\n\nIcon Plaza features fully furnished two- to five-bedroom units. The building has a swimming pool, rooftop lounge, clubhouse, fitness center and study rooms. Starbucks, Jersey Mike\u2019s, Movita, Juice Bar and Wingstop are the ground-floor tenants.\nWest 27th Place consists of studio, one-, two-, and four-bedroom units offering a modern furniture package. Amenities include a swimming pool, fitness center, clubhouse with social areas, and study rooms. Retail tenants on the ground floor include Five Guys, Thai by Trio and Factory Tea Bar.\nOne of the most active student housing developers in the country,\nLandmark is on a tear\n.\nAs of the end of April, the firm said it had over 50 student and multifamily projects under construction or near term start with an estimated value of over $10 billion.\nThat pipeline includes The Mark at Los Angeles, under construction near the UCLA campus, and The Standard at Los Angeles being built near the USC campus. The two projects will add more than 1,450 beds to the market.\n",

It then renovated and expanded the building into a two-story office and creative manufacturing hub, according to the Business Times\nIt\u2019s a notable upgrade in space for the four-year-old Astro Mechanica.

Over the spring and summer, an\nartificial intelligence\ncompany, a\nrobotics\ncompany, general technology companies and one tenant that needed space for three-dimensional printers for prototyping toured the property, according to the Business Times.\nAstro Mechanica is working to create a new jet engine that would enable commercial supersonic flights to return to the skies. The company was founded by CEO Ian Brooke in 2021 and raised a $27.1 million round of funding this spring, per the Business Times. Last month, the company secured an undisclosed investment from United Airlines\u2019 venture capital arm. United in particular has already committed to a forthcoming supersonic flight rebirth, pledging to buy 15 planes from Boom Supersonic with the hope of starting commercial supersonic flights by the end of the decade.\nThe $27.1 million raised will be used to build out Astro Mechanica\u2019s software team, further develop and test its jet engine prototype, and launch a team to start building airframes, Brooke\ntold\nTectonic in April. The funding will also enable Astro Mechanica to pursue government contracts. Its goal is to establish the first supersonic commercial flight at a price point similar to existing air travel within the next decade.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A casino is no longer in Manhattan\u2019s future.\nThe gaming proposal from Soloviev Group, which would have built a casino on a vacant lot near the United Nations building, was rejected this morning in a four-to-two vote before a community advisory committee.\nSoloviev\u2019s plan is the third to be rejected by a CAC over the course of one week. The result eliminates all proposals for a casino located in Manhattan. Five proposals remain, with three licenses available from the state.\nThe four members of the committee who voted against the proposal were Sandra McKee, appointed by State Senator Kristen Gonzalez; Reshma Patel, appointed by Assembly member Harvey Epstein; Celeste Royo, appointed by Borough President Mark Levine; and Jasmine Narula, appointed by Council member Keith Powers.\nThe two who voted for the proposal were Jennifer Sta. Ines, appointed by Mayor Eric Adams and Nichols Silbersack, appointed by Gov. Kathy Hochul.\n\nSoloviev\u2019s proposal, called \u201cFreedom Plaza,\u201d would have been an $11 billion development, the most expensive of all the plans. The partnership with the Mohegan Tribe and Banyan Group aimed to build a below-grade casino at 686 First Avenue, with 1,049 housing units and green space. It also offered equity options for city residents.\nThe Freedom Plaza proposal failed despite significant tailwinds in recent days. On Friday, Mayor Eric Adams released a report that showed the Soloviev plan would create more jobs than any other casino plan. And on Saturday, the partnership announced an amendment that all housing units would be permanently affordable, increasing the number of affordable units by 400.\nThe CACs, one for each proposal, are tasked with determining if there is public support for a casino proposal. Those that are approved at this stage will go before the state gaming commission.\nAfter three rejections over the last week, five proposals remain: Mets owner Steve Cohen\u2019s project at Citi Field, Thor Equities\u2019 proposed Coney Island development, one from Bally\u2019s in the Throgg\u2019s Neck area of the Bronx, Genting\u2019s proposed casino in Jamaica, Queens and a site in Yonkers from MGM.\nThe CACs must vote before Sept 30.",

Unit 5B hit the market earlier this month, roughly two years after the sellers bought it for $16 million. The apartment has four bedrooms and four bathrooms and also features a corner great room with views of the Hudson River.\nAmenities in the 46-unit building, developed by Related Companies, include a garage, fitness center, a lap pool and squash court.\nCortnee Glasser with Sotheby\u2019s International had the listing.\nThe Tribeca building has snagged a number of notable buyers since sponsor sales launched in 2016, including film producer and director Jack Heller, who in 2018 paid\n$19 million\nfor a 4,100-square-foot unit with a terrace.\n\nA $55 million penthouse at 70 Vestry was also at the center of a\ncontentious divorce\nbetween the CEO of the modeling agency Elite World Group, Julia Haart, and her estranged husband, Italian telecom mogul Silvio Scaglia. A judge sided with Haart, who also starred in the reality TV show \u201cMy Unorthodox Life,\u201d in divorce proceedings, awarding her the apartment earlier this year.\nThe second most expensive home to enter contract was a townhouse at 80 Horatio Street, with an asking price of $9 million. The West Village home, which is currently configured as multiple rental apartments, hit the market earlier this month for the first time in roughly 50 years.\nThe buyer signed the pending deal after a bidding war, and the final sale price will likely be between $10 million and $11 million, sources told Olshan. The 25-foot-wide home spans five stories and 6,100 square feet.\nBrown Harris Stevens\u2019 Amy Herman and Kyle Cooper had the listing.\nOf the 21 properties, 15 were condos, five were co-ops and one was a townhouse.\nThe homes\u2019 combined asking price was $144 million, for an average price of $6.9 million and a median of $6 million. The typical home spent more than a year and a half on the market and was discounted 7 percent from the original listing price.\n",

        "content": "After multiple delays, a task force entrusted with the fate of the Brooklyn Marine Terminal has voted to allow plans to build thousands of units of housing on the site to move forward.\nThe 28-member task force, chaired by Rep. Dan Goldman, on Monday advanced in a 17-to-eight vote the $3.5 billion plan to redevelop the 122-acre marine terminal, which runs from Cobble Hill to Red Hook. The latest plan calls for 6,000 apartments on the site, with 40 percent set aside as affordable. Roughly half of the site will include modernized piers along with a new marginal pier for smaller and mid-sized ships.\nThe plan also includes 275,000 square feet of light industrial space, an up to 400-key hotel and 28 acres of open space.\nMonday\u2019s vote simply means that plans for the terminal will move forward, with the environmental review and the general project plan process coming next. But the task force had the ability to kill the project before it even began the state\u2019s public review process \u2014\u00a0and its fate appeared precarious over the last few months.\nThe vote was\npostponed\nfive times, as the task force struggled to get enough yes votes to move the project forward. The proposal has also undergone multiple revisions. Initial plans called for up to 12,000 housing units, which were then pared down to 7,700 and then to 6,000.\nThe critical vote was delayed amid accusations that the city and state were trying to rush the plan forward. Some elected officials, including Council member Alexa Avil\u00e9s, a vice chair of the task force, and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, worried that the plan would further diminish the city\u2019s industrial and manufacturing capabilities.\nIn a Brooklyn Eagle editorial she co-wrote with Eddie Bautista, Avil\u00e9s, executive director of the NYC Environmental Justice Alliance and a member of the task force, called the plan \u201chalf-baked,\u201d and raised doubts that the commitments made as part of the plan would be honored.\nBut last week, some of the task force\u2019s naysayers were swayed by a number of changes, including an increase in funds for housing and industrial space. The Economic Development Corporation, the agency leading this project, has pledged to create a $75 million fund to build or preserve housing off-site within Community Board 6, up from the original $50 million commitment.\nThe administration also added 50,000 square feet of light industrial space, bringing the project\u2019s total to 275,000 square feet, with a majority of that space dedicated to a single, mixed-use building planned for Pier 11.\nOther new investments include $3 million for capital improvements at public schools in areas near the terminal and $7 million for improvements at DiMattina Park, Van Voorhees Playground, Carroll Park and other parks in the area.\nThis fall, EDC will also release a request for expressions of interest, seeking proposals for different port configurations and additional maritime industrial activities at the port. The agency will also develop an alternative for a larger port that will be analyzed in the environmental review process.\nLast week, EDC credited Council member Shahana Hanif and Reynoso for helping to work out the changes, which ultimately paved the way for Monday\u2019s vote.\n\nAn ailing piece of infrastructure\nThe city took control of the terminal last year through a\nland swap\nwith the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which received Staten Island\u2019s Howland Hook Marine Terminal in the exchange.\nMuch was at stake for the administration, which is trying to make good on a bet that creating a modern port \u2014\u00a0while also adding thousands of units of housing \u2014 was better than continuing to subsidize the activities of a flailing terminal.\nDuring a tour of the site in June, EDC head Andrew Kimball described decades\u2019 worth of deferred basic maintenance at the terminal, piling up to hundreds of millions of dollars. Two of the piers were condemned roughly a year ago, and another two are about eight to 10 years from collapsing, he said at the time.\nThe port handles roughly 60,000 containers every year, or roughly 1.5 percent of the containers brought into New York Harbor. The terminal has also been used for non-maritime purposes, storing mountains of aggregate, junk cars and decades-old modular hotel units.\nInstead of replacing three of the long piers that jut out into the East River, the city wants to fill in the gaps between the aging piers to create a marginal pier deeper in the channel, allowing ships to sidle up sideways.\nThe administration saw the deal with the Port Authority as an opportunity to double down on moving goods by water \u2014\u00a0as a way to reduce trucks transporting perishable food items throughout the city, for instance \u2014\u00a0while also using a portion of the site for housing.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just eliminate this site completely as a maritime opportunity,\u201d Kimball said during the tour.\nPending approval by the state, developers of the residential sites will make payments in lieu of taxes, which will be invested into the terminal, rather than the city\u2019s general fund. The Economic Development Corporation expects to fund the affordable housing component with revenues from the overall development and \u201cadditional public grants.\u201d Officials have also pledged to invest $200 million in public housing complexes, Red Hook Houses East and Red Hook Houses West.\nKimball said that once the project is officially approved, a development corporation \u2014 whose members will be appointed by the governor, mayor and local representatives \u2014 will decide how to roll out the search for developers of the residential sites. He noted the \u201cstrong interest\u201d among the task force members to ensure that multiple developers are involved, unlike the nearby megadevelopment Pacific Park.\nThe state is still in the process of approving new development teams for the remaining housing at that project, which has been criticized for not spreading the risk of developing those sites among more developers.\n",

That ruling came months after Aby Rosen\u2019s firm sued Cooper Union in September after the school moved to terminate the company\u2019s ground lease.

Rates have been falling fairly steadily all year, and they reached their lowest point this year before last week\u2019s rate cut, according to Freddie Mac.\nBrokers said they\u2019re hopeful mortgage rates below 6 percent could be on the horizon if the Fed cuts interest rates further this year as it indicated and keeps up an optimistic view of the economy.\nWhether the Fed\u2019s signal on interest rates will bring mortgage rates down further isn\u2019t clear yet. The 10-year Treasury yield and mortgage rates ticked up slightly in the days following the Fed\u2019s announcement, partially owing to lower jobless claims announced Thursday. But the 30-year mortgage rate is still on the lower end of the last three years, at 6.35 percent as of Friday, according to Mortgage News Daily.\n\u201cAll the conversation of where it\u2019s going, I don\u2019t think anybody knows where the rates are going to go,\u201d Dream Town CEO Yuval Degani said. \u201cIf you look at all the estimations of the last three years, the forecasts, they never happened.\u201d\n\nBut if lower mortgage rates do come, the early months of next year could be a \u201cfeeding frenzy,\u201d Fulton Grace Realty broker Patrick Shino said, as more buyers pour into the market and their buying power grows.\nChicago\u2019s housing market has been saddled by low inventory the last few years, driving prices up and creating competition for scarce listings. Homeowners locked into 2 to 3 percent rates aren\u2019t selling, and the buyer pool isn\u2019t drying up. Home prices have increased year-over-year each month for almost two years straight, and active listings have been trending downward since 2020, according to Redfin and the Federal Reserve.\nLower rates will help with the scarcity, unlocking some inventory as homeowners who have been holding out on moving put their houses on the market. Jenny Ames, a broker with Engel and V\u00f6lkers, said she thinks the market will start to normalize as people who have been wanting to move take advantage of the lower interest rates, freeing up homes for other buyers.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that prices are necessarily going to come down right away because we\u2019ve had this scarcity issue,\u201d Ames said. \u201cBut over time, if rates come down and stay down and the logjam breaks, then I think the pressure on inventory will start to ease and we\u2019ll start to see a more normal market.\u201d\nBut Shino said he doubts the added inventory will keep up with the demand that will grow alongside it. First-time buyers who missed out on interest rates below 3 percent will be eager to lock in properties if rates dip below 6 percent.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to want to miss out on it again, and I think you\u2019re going to have far more buyers flooding into the market,\u201d Shino said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way there\u2019s going to be enough inventory to satiate that buyer demand.\u201d",

        "content": "The biggest multifamily sale in Glendale over the last quarter was 600 North Central Avenue, which The Sobrato Organization nabbed for $126 million, according to Los Angeles County tax assessor records, a whopping price that topped the rest of the top 10 combined.\nThis is the latest installment in a feature providing a weekly update on quarterly top sales by market segment, based on TRDData.\nThe Sobrato family started in real estate as Italian-immigrant farmers at the southern end of San Francisco Bay. The family shifted into commercial development in the 1950s, and grew its operations as Silicon Valley spread its tentacles from a home base in Santa Clara County.\nSobrato acquired the Modera Glendale, a 235-unit apartment building, from Mill Creek Residential and Rockwood Capital, and renamed it The Adeline. The price comes out to $536,000 per unit.\n\nThat\u2019s a far cry from the city\u2019s average sales price per unit of $269,249, according to a multifamily market report from Kidder Mathews.\nMill Creek developed the five-story property in 2015. It has a courtyard with a pool and a hot tub, plus two smaller attached courtyards. The property also has a fitness center, a yoga studio, a pet spa and a multipurpose clubhouse with a gourmet kitchen area and an internet cafe.\nThe apartments, managed by Greystar, range from studios to three-bedrooms. One-bedroom apartments start at $2,788 per month for 619 square feet, The Adeline website indicates. Two-bedrooms start at $3,854 a month for 1,050 square feet. In the second quarter, the average monthly asking rent in Glendale was $2,277, per the Kidder Mathews report.\nThe April 23 deal also marks\nL.A. County\u2019s biggest multifamily sale\nof the quarter. The second-biggest in the county was 38441 5th Street West in the desert city of Palmdale, which Beverly Hills-headquartered Post Investment Group acquired for\n$71 million\non March 3. That complex has 296 units across 16 buildings. The deal values the property at just under $240,000 per unit.\n",

        "content": "An Austin apartment portfolio took a major hit to its appraisal value four months after its CMBS loan was\nflagged for special servicing\n, as Texas braces for a wave of multifamily distress.\nAn updated appraisal put the two-property portfolio at $98.9 million, a 47 percent haircut from its value of $187.9 million in 2023, according to Morningstar Credit. The appraisal drop put the portfolio\u2019s value below the balance on the $110 million CMBS loan tied to the properties.\nThe loan tied to far northeast Austin complexes Orbit Apartments and Starburst Apartments has been delinquent since April and was transferred to special servicing for default, according to Trepp. The loan was issued in 2023 and is set to mature in May 2028.\nDeed records show the borrower is Orem, Utah-based investor Keller Capital. The firm bought the properties in 2019 from Tampa-based investor Laurel Ridge.\nThere are 840 units between the two properties, at 8800 and 8900 North Interstate Highway 35. The loan works out to about $131,000 per unit. The apartments were built in the early eighties and renovated in 2022. Orbit Apartments were valued at $43.7 million this year, appraisal district records show. Starburst Apartments were valued at $58.1 million.\n\nBetween the historic glut of apartment supply coming online and the rise in interest rates, Texas multifamily has become a hot potato, especially the properties built decades ago that need work.\nAustin saw 25,000 units delivered last year, according to data from Yardi Matrix. As a result, rents continued to freefall and occupancy slumped. MRI ApartmentData put the city\u2019s occupancy at 84.5 percent in April. That same month, rent had dropped 7.6 percent from a year earlier.\nJust before the delivery deluge, investors swept through Texas metros when interest rates were low, picking up vintage apartments at high valuations with plans to renovate them, raise rents and sell for a profit. Instead, interest rates rose, as did construction costs, and valuations dropped, spelling trouble for many of these investors.\nExperts have been warning of\na wave of distress\nas $19 billion in CMBS loans tied to Texas multifamily is set to mature in the next five years.\n",

The developer now controls the vast majority of the block, with only a handful of other owners remaining.\nThe ultimate plan remains unclear. Laboz, a\nkey player in New York retail\n, has described the assemblage as a \u201clong-term hold,\u201d citing its prime location above two subway arteries and within steps of three more.\n\nHe has accumulated enough land on the block to build the borough\u2019s largest skyscraper. But large-scale rental projects in New York are difficult to pencil out since the state passed the\n485x tax break\n. Some developers have filed to\ndevelop clusters of 99-unit buildings\nto avoid the minimum construction wage requirement that kicks in at 100 units.\nLaboz did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nLaboz has pulled off this type of play before. In 2012, his family sold a nearby assemblage of a dozen parcels to AvalonBay Communities for $125 million. That site became the 826-unit Ava DoBro, the borough\u2019s largest residential tower when it opened in 2015.\nLaboz has continued to invest in Downtown Brooklyn retail. In December, he and a group of investors\nbought the Macy\u2019s\non the block catty corner to the assemblage. Laboz and his partners, Isaac Chera of Crown Acquisitions and the Chehabar family of the Jackson Group, plan to redevelop the historic property at 422 Fulton Street into a retail and entertainment space.\n",

        "content": "Walls are closing in on\nChikoo Patel\n.\nThe multifamily property manager and investor who assembled control of dozens of South Side apartment buildings through his firm CKO Real Estate is facing a lawsuit alleging he bilked his ex-partners out of more than $10.8 million through fraud, theft and mismanagement.\nThe lawsuit was filed Thursday by investor Shai Wolkowicki and his wife Lauren Lampert, who first partnered with Patel\u2019s Chicago-based firm\nCKO Real Estate\nin 2020. But they split up early this year, when they confronted Patel after discovering his alleged misdeeds and removed him from operating the properties, Wolkowicki and other investors said.\nOver the years, Lampert and Wolkowicki invested in more than 50 real estate projects with Patel. In addition to the trio\u2019s Chicago holdings, they also jointly owned rental properties throughout Illinois, including in Rockford, and Springfield, where Patel and Wolkowicki are facing a $16 million foreclosure lawsuit from Old National Bank for the apartment complex at 1833 Seven Pines Road.\nThe distress is derived in part from Patel allegedly violating operating agreements he had with the couple, who hired CKO to manage their portfolio of at least 37 business entities invested in the ownership of apartments. The couple classified themselves as \u201cpassive investors,\u201d but they said they had to take on an active role earlier this year when they fired CKO upon discovering that Patel had been improperly siphoning millions of dollars out of the properties to himself. They called it a \u201cPonzi-like scheme\u201d to cover his personal expenses, staffing costs for CKO and other unscrupulous expenditures not related to real estate, the suit said.\nWolkowicki and Lampert, who both led\nreal estate careers in Chicago\nbefore moving to Boca Raton, Florida, a few years ago, were lured into continuing to buy property through Patel after a successful initial investment in 2020. Their agreements purportedly outlined that Patel held minority ownership in the dozens of properties they bought together, while he performed management duties for a fee and got bonus payments when other investors\u2019 capital had been returned.\nIt didn\u2019t go as planned. \u201cThe results have been catastrophic\u201d for Wolkowicki and Lampert, their lawsuit said.\nAn attorney for Patel, M. Reas Bowman, said his client denies all the allegations and is working to resolve the various litigation in which he\u2019s involved. Wolkowicki declined to comment beyond his complaint.\nOutside of\nCKO\u2019s internal financial issues\n, Patel is also facing serious allegations brought to court by city officials and his lenders, including a\ncredit card company\nthat said he owes $60,000 after missing minimum payments. Other investors have made similar allegations to Wolkowicki regarding their financial trouble at a Southwest Side apartment property.\n\nTenants in CKO-managed buildings earlier this year became enraged with the deteriorating conditions of their rentals. In response, Chicago officials sued CKO over the allegedly egregious building code violations.\nLampert and Wolkowicki\u2019s lawsuit outlines even more outlandish claims, starting in 2022, with allegedly improper transfers between property-level bank accounts to CKO entities and bank accounts controlled by Patel. He allegedly deposited at least $500,000 from an insurance payout following a fire at 6449 South Langley Avenue in Chicago into his personal bank account, and he failed to do any reconstruction or rehabilitation work to make the property habitable again, the suit said.\nPatel also allegedly used over $7,600 transferred out of a Racine Street property to pay his personal mortgage; used another $1,650 to make a Range Rover car payment; and then took another $2,400 to make a Mercedes car payment, the lawsuit says. He extracted $4,400 out of another property to make car payments, the suit said.\nHe\u2019s also accused of deceiving his clients into thinking their property\u2019s bills were paid. Patel provided investors images of checks that he claimed had been used to pay for property taxes and other bills, but the lawsuit said \u201cthese checks were never actually mailed or remitted to the proper recipient.\u201d\n\u201cIn many cases, Patel aggressively evaded and delayed requests for financial information with dubious excuses,\u201d the suit said. For example, Lampert and Wolkowicki said Patel dodged questions and asked for more time to respond last December about a $72,000 transfer, claiming his father had recently died. The couple later found out that wasn\u2019t true, the suit said.\nPatel also pledged rental revenues from various properties he was managing as collateral to secure loans from outfits including Itria Ventures, which is a \u201cpayday lender\u201d of sorts for business owners that provides capital up front in return for receiving future lease payments. Itria and another similar company are suing Patel for allegedly defaulting on his agreements with them, too.\nWolkowicki says the alleged misconduct has damaged his relationships with lenders, triggered legal actions regarding personal guarantees he signed to collateralize millions of dollars in debt and amounted to his own big financial losses.\nIn the interim settlement agreement Patel signed with Wolkowicki and Lampert earlier this year, he conceded that many of the transfers described in their lawsuit were improper and benefited Patel personally, the complaint said. They\u2019re asking for a judgment against Patel of no less than $10.8 million.\n",

Roughly 10 percent of the apartments would be priced as affordable, with the developer making an in-lieu payment to meet the city\u2019s full requirements. The proposed apartment building was designed by the firm Solomon Cordwell Buenz.\nThe site is currently home to a 57,000-square-foot retail property anchored by a Nike store. A predecessor of Mark Capital Management paid $295 million in 2015 for that building and two others on the block. The London-based firm did not respond to requests for comment on AMLI\u2019s proposal.\nReilly cast the plan as a vote of confidence for a corridor still shaking off its pandemic funk. The Mag Mile\u2019s retail vacancy rate is hovering around 30 percent, according to Kirsch Agency data, though landlords have seen some leasing momentum.\n\u201cThis project represents continued private investment along the Magnificent Mile,\u201d Reilly told constituents, arguing it will help keep the strip \u201can active and attractive corridor.\u201d\n\nAMLI, which developed\nseveral\nlarge Chicago rental complexes in the South Loop and River North previously, carries a portfolio of tower projects in\nvarious\ncorners around the country. The developer didn\u2019t\ndisclose\nthe tower\u2019s estimated cost or timeline. The proposal still requires Chicago City Council approval.\nThe move comes as apartment rents continue to climb downtown, fueled by limited supply. With few projects scheduled to deliver in the next 18 months, net rents at top-tier buildings have reached $3.99 per square foot, according to Integra Realty Resources.\nIf greenlit, AMLI\u2019s tower would join a wave of residential reinvestment creeping onto Michigan Avenue. At 500 North Michigan Avenue, a 320-unit office-to-apartment conversion is also in the\nworks\n. The projects suggest developers are betting the Mag Mile\u2019s future lies not just in retail but in a fuller blend of uses.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "San Antonio\u2019s housing inventory declined last month, bucking the national trend.\nListings in San Antonio dropped by 249 homes, or 1.6 percent, from a year ago, according to Homes.com. Among the top 40 metropolitan areas in the country, San Antonio\u2019s only bedfellow was San Francisco, second from the bottom with 27 fewer listings than last August. Every other major city added homes to the market. To give a sense of scale, the country\u2019s top city for housing abundance last month was\nHouston\n, where inventory swelled 22 percent to surpass 43,000 listings, a national record.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strange position for a Sun Belt market like San Antonio to be in at the moment,\u201d CoStar analyst Daniel Khalil said. \u201cFor San Antonio really to be the only major Sun Belt market to see a decrease year over year \u2014 it\u2019s a small decrease, almost flat \u2014 I think that speaks to the resiliency of San Antonio as a market.\u201d\nSan Antonio also clocked the\nhighest rate of canceled home sales\nin the country earlier this year, when sellers were reluctant to adjust their expectations to the budding\nbuyer\u2019s market\n, local agents said.\nNow it looks like sellers are deciding to wait.\n\u201cA lot of people have really good equity and really good rates on their property, so they\u2019re just holding tight,\u201d said Clint Neal, co-founder of San Antonio brokerage Neal and Neal.\n\nAlthough buyers are wielding more negotiating power, San Antonio isn\u2019t quite a buyer\u2019s market, said Keller Williams of San Antonio president Grant Lopez.\n\u201cIt feels to a lot of people like we\u2019re in a down market. We\u2019re actually not. We\u2019re just back to our normal market that we always operated on,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cIt\u2019s like running on a treadmill: If you\u2019re used to running five miles an hour, and you up it to ten for a good, long while \u2014 if you lower it down, it\u2019s going to feel like you\u2019re walking suddenly. But you\u2019re not walking; you just had a long sprint.\u201d\nSan Antonio prices have wavered marginally this year, with a median price of $265,000, according to Redfin.\nNorth Texas, Houston and Austin have experienced larger price declines this year, Khalil said. The median sale price in Houston \u2014 about $336,000 \u2014 hasn\u2019t turned positive year over year since April, aside from a brief period in the latter half of August when it was 1 percent higher, according to Redfin. Dallas has undergone a similar trend, with year-over-year declines stretching as far as 5 percent in May; at present, Dallas\u2019 median price of $412,000 is 1 percent higher year over year. Austin\u2019s median sale price, which stands at $440,000 now, trailed the previous year\u2019s price between December and August. Other Sun Belt markets, such as Phoenix and Orlando, have modestly but definitely depreciated.\n\u201cWe need this kind of stabilization to happen at a certain point, because it just can\u2019t continue to rise and rise and rise,\u201d Lopez said.\n",

The board of the Academy of Magical Arts supports the deal video game mogul Pitchford has proposed, while some of the rank-and-file of the magicians group are skeptical.\n\u201cThe easiest people to fool are magicians,\u201d one AMA member quipped, per the Times.\nA new Magic Castle Club, separate from the Academy of Magical Arts, would collect dues and split revenue between Pitchford\u2019s Magic Castle Enterprises and the nonprofit tenant.\nPitchford\u2019s employees would run the bar, restaurant, gift shop and valet while the AMA would dedicate itself to nonprofit programming. The AMA board of directors would shrink from nine members to five, with two of them nominated by Pitchford\u2019s companies.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest chapter in a yearslong saga at the institution.\nIn 2020, the Magic Castle faced a pandemic shutdown followed by a Los Angeles Times\ninvestigation\nuncovering alleged sexual harassment, groping and racism. The Edwardian-style mansion reopened in 2021 after a leadership overhaul.\nPitchford bought the establishment as well as an adjacent apartment building and the 33-key Magic Hotel next door in 2022.. He also bought intellectual property rights to the Magic Castle name from AMA patriarch Milt Larsen, who died the following year.\nPitchford and his wife, Kristy Pitchford, created companies to manage the holdings once they came under their control. Magic Castle Enterprises handles intellectual property, while Magic Castle Entertainment handles real estate. Together, they\u2019re known as MCE. Erika Larsen, daughter of castle pioneers Bill and Irene Larsen, was tapped to be president of Magic Castle Enterprises, while Bill and Irene Larsen\u2019s granddaughter Jessica Hopkins joined as chief operating officer.\nAMA board members have until Sept. 29 to decide how to proceed.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Glendenning is eyeing a mass timber office building of 40,000 to 60,000 square feet, with plans to occupy about a quarter of the space and lease out the rest. He hopes to start construction next fall and taking 18 months. Celina is about 40 miles north of Downtown Dallas and has a population of about 30,000.\nTwo Celina sites are in play. The first is King Place, a 600-acre mixed-use development that Glendenning calls his \u201clegacy project.\u201d Located just north of Glendenning Parkway, it already has $40 million of infrastructure in place and\nties\ninto the Dallas North Tollway extension scheduled for completion in 2027. The other option is Shawnee Trail, a billion-dollar mixed-use project under construction that\u2019s\nslated\nto deliver the city\u2019s first Walmart Supercenter.\nFor Glendenning, the move is more than just a business decision.

He purchased the unit for\n$23.5 million\nin 2017.\nThe buyer of Unit 6W is Evan Cheng, the co-founder and CEO of cryptocurrency company Mysten Labs. Cheng, who was previously an engineering director at Facebook before it rebranded to Meta, purchased the apartment in what appears to be an off-market deal.\nA previous listing describes the unit as having four bedrooms and five bathrooms. It also features an eat-in kitchen and views of Central Park and the facade of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\nThe 17-unit co-op was built in 1912. The property is known for housing a long list of prominent residents, such as financier Murry Guggenheim, former Vice President Levi Morton and former Secretary of State Elihu Root.\n\nLauder has sought to offload several of his properties in recent years, including his 12th-floor apartment at 778 Park Avenue, which hit the market in December asking just under $27 million. He dropped the asking price of the five-bedroom co-op to $25 million earlier this year.\nLauder bought the 12th-floor unit from another cosmetics mogul, former Revlon owner Ronald Perelman, for $24 million in 2023. It is one of two apartments Lauder owned in the building, the other of which he bought in 2008 for $27.5 million. He listed the 14th-floor unit in 2019 for\n$45 million\n, though it appears he never found a buyer for it.\nHowever, Lauder found more success for his sprawling oceanfront property in Palm Beach, which he found a buyer for earlier this year. If the land trades for its\n$178 million\nasking price, it will set a new record for Florida\u2019s priciest residential sale.\nLauder listed the two lots for $200 million in 2023, the same year he purchased Rush Limbaugh\u2019s former Palm Beach estate for\n$155 million\n.\n",

Reynoso said the proposal \u201cfailed to prove itself as a public good.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Thor declined to comment.\nThe $3.4 billion casino, called the Coney, is proposed for a beachfront site and includes a 500-key hotel, 20 restaurants and a 25,000-square-foot entertainment venue. The developer secured necessary zoning approvals, but faces opposition from Luna Park; opponents fear the project would limit access to the amusement park area.\n\nSeveral months ago, it seemed Thor\ndid not have a Plan B\nfor the site, at least not one it was willing to publicly acknowledge. Thor\u2019s Peter McEneaney said Coney Island had \u201cdefinitely fallen on hard times\u201d and \u201cthe only way to correct that is a generational type project like this.\u201d\nShould the CAC reject the Coney Island casino, it would thin the ranks of contenders for a downstate gaming license.\nIn the last week, all three of the casino projects still on the table in Manhattan were excised, capped by the\nSoloviev Group\u2019s defeat\nfor its Freedom Plaza site on Monday morning.\nOnly four proposals remain outside of The Coney: Mets owner Steve Cohen\u2019s project at Citi Field, Bally\u2019s proposal in the Throgg\u2019s Neck area of the Bronx, Genting\u2019s proposed casino in Jamaica, Queens and a site in Yonkers from MGM. Should the latter two have an advantage by virtue of being \u201cracinos,\u201d the last license could come down to a one-on-one competition.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "AcadeMir Charter Schools hit the books and picked up more land in west Miami-Dade County.\nThe Miami-based charter school paid $20.5 million for eight parcels of vacant land between Southwest 148th Avenue, Southwest 30th Street and Southwest 147th Avenue in unincorporated Miami-Dade. The land totals 9.2 acres.\nAcadeMir also acquired a 1.3-acre plot that\u2019s northwest of Coral Way and Southwest 157th Avenue for an undisclosed amount, property records show.\nMiami-based Faro Investments, led by Julio Rodriguez, sold the parcels.\nAcadeMir has been expanding its portfolio. The company, which is managed by Superior Charter Schools Services,\nrecently purchased\none of its campuses in South Miami Heights for $25 million. AcadeMir\u2019s board of directors includes Alexander Casas, Dr. Tirso Alonso, Joanna Noriega, Sonia Alfaro, Ruben Perez and Michael Rodriguez. Casas shares the same name as Florida International University\u2019s chief of police. According to his LinkedIn, he has a background in higher education.\n\nLast year, AcadeMir paid\n$16.6 million\nfor its campus at 13330 Southwest 288th Street in Homestead.\nRestrictive zoning and other factors have limited the supply of charter school\nsites\n, making the ones that exist a popular investment, experts have told\nThe Real Deal.\nParents in South Florida are also increasingly seeking non-traditional education options, boosting demand. The public school systems in Miami-Dade and Broward have seen a drop in enrollment.\nLast month, Aventura-based charter school developer MG3 Group sold a portfolio of seven school campuses across Florida for a combined\n$172.4 million\nto BridgePrep Academy. The deal included two South Florida properties at 13300 Southwest 120th Street in Kendall and 3500 Northwest 89th Court in Doral, which sold for $46.5 million and $44.9 million, respectively.\nTwo years ago, Renaissance Charter School paid\n$38.2 million\nfor its K-8 campuses at 6701 West Sunrise Boulevard in Plantation and at 8399 North University Drive in Tamarac.\nIn 2021, MG3 sold eight Florida charter schools for a total of\n$242 million\nto nonprofit Educational Growth Fund. The deal included the Everglades Preparatory Academy middle school at 2251 Mowry Drive in Homestead, and the Avant Garde Academy at 2025 McKinley Street in Hollywood.\n",

Azusa Pacific University sold the vacant apartments to the privately owned real estate company, per property records recorded earlier this month.\nThe apartment community is minutes away from the private school. The California Municipal Finance Authority previously\nprovided\nthe university with tax-exempt financing for the apartments to become student housing. But the apartments were\nunderutilized\n, and the university opted for a sale.\nMesa West Capital provided a $68.5 million loan for the 320-apartment acquisition.\nThe property was presented as a vacant multifamily community in the San Gabriel Valley primed for repositioning, per a CBRE offering memorandum. The apartments at 801 East Alosta Avenue, now called Citrus Place rather than University Village, will begin leasing soon, per a social media post by Legacy Partners \u2014 which is based in Foster City, a master-planned community in the Bay Area.\nThe San Gabriel Valley has a 4.1 percent vacancy rate, per a second-quarter Lee &amp; Associates market report. Apartments command an average monthly asking rent at $2,018; and the average unit sale price is $285,805. That\u2019s around what Legacy Partners purchased the apartments for \u2014 $286,875 apiece.\n\nIn the San Gabriel Valley, the top sale in Q2 was Community Housing Works\u2019 126 apartments purchased from Stratford Partners, according to the market report. The apartments at 1940 Fullerton Road in Rowland Heights were sold for $38.3 million, or $303,968 per unit. The other two sales were for less than $10 million.\nThree years ago, Azusa Pacific University cashed out of a separate apartment building portfolio in the area in an $81 million\ndeal\n; the three properties near campus totaled 316 apartments.\nLegacy Partners, earlier this summer, came closer to\nredeveloping\nthe Los Angeles Chargers\u2019 former training facility in Costa Mesa into a mixed-use destination.\nLegacy Partners and Azusa Pacific University did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "The winds of change are blowing from the San Francisco Bay over Alameda Point.\nA commercial building, known as Building 92, at the former naval air base is poised to come under the ownership of one of three interested parties, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nLocal investors Riaz Capital, SrmErnst and Alameda Point Redevelopers have been vying to buy the 89,000-square-foot building at 650 West Tower Avenue in competing bids. One investor has been chosen for continued negotiations, though Alameda\u2019s director of base reuse and economic development Abby Thorne-Lyman didn\u2019t disclose which, the outlet said.\nThe city of Alameda has been\ntrying to sell the property\nfor two years as part of its effort to offload buildings and lease out others to close funding gaps for infrastructure upgrades. Alameda city officials opened a request for proposals seeking a buyer earlier this year.\nRiaz Capital\u2019s plan for Building 92 involves developing a smaller version of Arthaus Studios, a 100,000-square-foot artist and maker space in East Oakland. Riaz owns thousands of\nresidential units\nacross the Bay Area, but the company\u2019s Alameda Point proposal doesn\u2019t include housing, founder Riaz Taplin told the outlet.\nAlameda Point Redevelopers similarly floated a plan to divide the property into three spaces for arts, culture and entertainment tenants. Three companies have already expressed interest in renting space there under this plan, project manager Jonah Hendrickson told the Business Times.\n\nUnder SrmErnst\u2019s plan, the building would be converted into several small and mid-sized research and development and advanced manufacturing suites. The existing R&amp;D space at Alameda Point is in large warehouses and airplane hangars, leaving few options for smaller companies.\nIt would be another play at Alameda Point for\nSrmErnst\n, which already owns two buildings near Building 92. Those buildings are leased to Almanac Brewing, Kairos Power, Artisan Breads and Admiral Malting.\nBuilding 92 is in Alameda Point\u2019s Adaptive Reuse District, which is zoned for uses including retail, artist studios, office space, food and beverage production and manufacturing.\nThe Alameda City Council will discuss price and terms of payment with the selected buyer over the next few months, with a vote to approve the sale coming after that.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "San Francisco\u2019s vacant historic buildings could go from being relics to fresh real estate.\nMayor Daniel Lurie\nintroduced legislation that would make it easier for businesses like nonprofits, retailers, movie theaters and nightlife operators to set up shop in one of the city\u2019s approximately 300 historic buildings without having to endure lengthy approval processes, the San Francisco Examiner\nreported\n.\nLurie\u2019s proposed legislation aims to deal with the reality that tenants in historic buildings foot the bill for repairs requiring specialized, nonstandard materials and the maintenance of aging utility systems. Preservation standards currently in place, which keep buildings\u2019 historic character and prevent certain alterations to these structures, also present a hurdle to potential tenants.\nWhile those preservation protections won\u2019t be going anywhere, Lurie is looking to attract tenants to officially designated historic buildings with special incentives for businesses and nonprofits to operate in landmarked buildings. The city would enable such activity by relaxing zoning rules dictating what types of business operations can take place in a given neighborhood.\nTake the historic St. Joseph\u2019s Church building in South of Market. After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the structure sat damaged and unoccupied for decades. In 2018, the St. Joseph\u2019s Arts Society reopened the building as a performance and cultural events venue. Since then, the city of San Francisco has implemented more incentive programs for historic buildings in specific neighborhoods, hoping to recreate the rebirth of St. Joseph\u2019s Church.\n\n\u201cAdding greater flexibility for these special buildings will ensure they won\u2019t fall into disrepair due to disinvestment,\u201d the Mayor\u2019s Office\nsaid\nof the proposal.\nThe Tenderloin Museum could be another candidate for a St. Joseph\u2019s-style renaissance under Lurie\u2019s new proposal, part of his\nPermitSF\ninitiative designed to\ncut red tape across the city\nto spur development.\nEarlier this year, the nonprofit museum at Eddy and Leavenworth Streets announced expansion plans that would triple its operating footprint to approximately 10,000 square feet on the first floor of the historic Cadillac Hotel building, complete with a new special exhibition room and a new neon sign gallery. But because of restrictions limiting size to such projects, the expansion project would have to get special approval from the city\u2019s Planning Commission. Lurie\u2019s proposal would allow such an endeavor to proceed without further public review.\nFor now, Lurie\u2019s legislation awaits public review.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Starting bids were expected around $15 million and the auction lasted from Sept. 4 and concluded with live bidding Sept. 17 conducted by the Upper House in Hong Kong.\nThe home was originally listed in Aug. 2024 for $27.5 million, making it one of the\nmost expensive listings in Texas\nlast year. That also means the winning bid was about half the listing price. The seller is music producer Dirk Ulrich.\nBefore Ulrich\nbought the house in May 2023\n, the house had undergone multiple price reductions. It hit the market in 2021 for almost $25 million. It didn\u2019t sell until after the listing went viral on Zillow Gone Wild and the price dropped to $17.9 million.\nBuilt in 2016 on nearly 4 acres near Grapevine Lake, the\neight-bedroom, 11-bathroom estate\nfeatures a bowling alley, gym, indoor jump house, three chef\u2019s kitchens, a wine room that can store 2,100 bottles, a recording studio and a backyard pool split between a main swimming area and a 30-foot-deep diving pool with a slide. There\u2019s also a 2,000-square-foot guesthouse with its own entrance and parking. The turf in the backyard was repurposed from NRG Stadium used during Super Bowl LI in Houston.\n\nUlrich added a Dolby Atmos 3D audio studio last year as part of a remodel. The soundproof space connects digitally to a performance stage in the basement and can convert into a private screening room.\nThe property was represented through the auction by Brad Cook of Real Broker LLC and Michael Hershenberg of The Hershenberg Group. According to Concierge Auctions, buyers pay a 12 percent \u201cbuyer\u2019s premium\u201d at auction on top of the purchase price for a home, and co-brokers receive 2 percent.\nThe Dallas-Fort Worth metro continues to outpace the rest of Texas in\nhome sales over $10 million\n. Also on Grapevine Lake, an estate at 1711 Maranatha Way was the most-expensive listing in Texas last month. The five-bedroom, seven-bathroom house spans 8,000 square feet and is asking $8.75 million.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Two secondary bedrooms on the first level each come with an en-suite bathroom and a private terrace.\nThe upper level comes with two walk-in closets and the primary suite, which features a sitting area, another private terrace and an en-suite five-piece bathroom.\n\nThe unit comes with a private storage unit, and has private parking available for purchase.\nThe building, which served as the New York Life Insurance Company\u2019s headquarters before being converted to condos in 2018 by the Elad Group, comes with a fitness center, resident lounge and lobby attendant.\nA Douglas Elliman Development Marketing team, including Elena Sarkissian and Raphael De Niro, is heading sales for the 167 units at the Tribeca conversion.\nOne of those remaining units is the building\u2019s \u201cClock Tower\u201d penthouse, which hit the market in\nApril asking over $19 million\nand is inside the landmarked building\u2019s historic clock tower.\nCarpenter joins a growing list of well-known buyers at the building.\nIn 2020, Keith Urban and Nicole Kidman bought a\ntwo-bedroom apartment\nthere for $3.5 million, while earlier this year, Alexandra Clancy, the widow of spy novelist Tom Clancy, purchased one of the\nbuilding\u2019s other penthouses for $21.4 million\n.\nIn 2023, an entity tied to Carpenter purchased a\nhome in the Hollywood Hills for $4.4 million\n, according to property records.\n",

        "content": "Landlord Joel Wiener, whose vast portfolio got him billionaire status in 2017, is putting some of his buildings up for sale.\nAn entity connected to Wiener\u2019s Pinnacle Group plans to auction off 93 New York City apartment buildings containing 5,100 units, according to bankruptcy court documents filed Friday. A majority of the buildings contain rent-stabilized units. The news was first reported by\nBloomberg\n.\nThe auction plan is the result of a bankruptcy case filed by the Wiener-connected parties in May. In total, the bankrupt parties owe lender Flagstar Bank more than $564 million.\nThe marketing process for the buildings began last week, according to court documents, although the terms still require approval from a federal judge.\nEastdil Secured, working on behalf of the bankrupt party, has received confidentiality agreements from 50 interested buyers, according to court documents. Lawyers have proposed a December 12 deadline for potential buyers to submit a bid and an auction on January 8. Tenant leases will remain in effect if there is a purchase or refinancing.\n\nPinnacle has fallen behind on maintenance in the affected buildings. Housing code violations considered \u201cimmediately hazardous\u201d increased fourfold at the affected buildings between 2019 and 2014, double the rate at similar rent-stabilized buildings, according to city data analyzed by Bloomberg.\nLawyers for the bankrupt entities blamed the financial troubles on high interest rates, inflation in expenses, weak collections and tenant-friendly state legislation. The buildings generated more than $84 million in 2024, according to financial documents cited by Bloomberg.\nWiener was among the first New York real estate players to tap into the Israeli bond market for financing, raising more than $500 million. His Zarasai Group, a British Virgin Islands company, is now in the process of restructuring $275 million (1 billion Israeli shekels) in bonds issued on the Tel Aviv stock exchange.

Beverly Hills-based Nimes secured the three-year, floating-rate loan with two 12-month extension options from Atlanta-based Peachtree Group.\nNimes bought the 132-room hotel at 322 North Pass Avenue in 2019 from\nPebblebrook Hotel Trust\n, dropping $72.9 million on the property, before completing a multimillion-dollar renovation.\nThe hotel, under Nimes\u2019 ownership, faced business challenges from the onset of the pandemic in early 2020 and the five-month Writers Guild of America strike in 2023, Keegan Bisch, vice president of originations and credit at\nPeachtree\n, told CO. The recapitalization will enable the hotel to stabilize, thanks in part to its location in the middle of the Burbank Media District.\n\nIts proximity to\nWarner Bros.\nand Disney Studios already makes it the top booking hotel in the L.A. region for both studios, according to CO. \u201cThere is already a ton of in-place demand that they draw from,\u201d Bisch said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very high-quality, renovated hotel, plus there is a lot of growth in the market, so they are well positioned to take advantage of that.\u201d\nWarner Bros. is in the midst of a 30-acre expansion of its campus a mile away from the hotel which is expected to drive traffic to the lodging property. In addition to the growth of the Warner Bros. complex, Disney\u2019s move to consolidate its 52-acre Fox Studio Lot in Burbank, as well as NBCUniversal\u2019s addition of more than 1.2 million square feet of new office and production space, are also expected to increase visitorship to the Hotel Amarano.\nOther nearby hotel properties include The Tangerine at 3901 West Riverside Drive, a Best Western Plus at 3910 West Riverside Drive, and the Coast Burbank Hotel at 2011 West Olive Avenue.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A penthouse condo at the 101-story St. Regis tower that was part of a bulk investment by a firm tied to a Mexican denim magnate sold quietly for $7.5 million last month in an off-market deal.\nThe four-bedroom, 6,300-square-foot 79th-floor penthouse sold on Aug. 1, property records show. It was bought under a land trust that obscures the buyer\u2019s identity. The price tag makes it among the priciest units sold at the Jeanne Gang-designed skyscraper at 363 East Wacker Drive.\nThe seller of the penthouse was an LLC linked to GD Holdings, the real estate arm of Grupo Denim, a Mexican clothing company run by Salomon Juan Marcos Villarreal. The firm\nspent $117.5 million in 2024\nto buy 84 condos at the tower that its developer had yet to sell.\nThe latest sale is at least the fifth of GD Holdings\u2019 units to trade for more than $5 million this year amid downtown Chicago\u2019s struggling luxury condo market. It has sold at least 24 other units at the tower, property records show. Concerns about crime and fewer in-office workers after the pandemic have depressed condo values in some downtown segments and many\nunits throughout the city have sold at a loss\n.\nBut the market may be poised for a turnaround. Rafael Murillo, a Compass agent who has brokered several deals in the St. Regis Tower, said buyers are showing renewed interest in downtown properties, seeing an opportunity to get a discount before the recovery. Newer buildings like the St. Regis are moving units quickly, even if they\u2019re selling at lower prices than they could have fetched a few years ago, he said.\n\n\u201cRight now is a great time to buy,\u201d said Murillo, who wasn\u2019t involved in the 79th floor unit sale. \u201cAffluent buyers are taking advantage of these opportunities, knowing that in the next few years, the downtown market is likely to see steady, healthy growth. We\u2019re in the recovery phase.\u201d\nThe condo sold without being publicly listed, so there is little information about the unit\u2019s price history and whether real estate agents represented the buyer or seller in the deal. An archived version of the St. Regis Residences webpage shows the 79th floor unit was listed at just under $9.8 million in May, which is about 25 percent higher than the final $7.5 million sale price. The webpage also showed a similar unit on the 82nd floor listed at $10.5 million. That unit is no longer listed for sale on the website, but, so far, there has been no sale of that condo recorded in Cook County property records.\nAnother penthouse with a similar floor plan, on the 73rd floor, is currently listed on the website at $8.25 million.\nThe St. Regis\u2019s developer, Magellan Development Group, which remained in charge of marketing the property after GD Holdings\u2019 bulk purchase, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. And Magellan\u2019s sales chief Leila Zammatta did not respond to a request for comment. GD Holdings could not be reached.\nThe priciest deal by far among the luxury residences at the St. Regis came in 2022, when Mexican mining CEO German Larrea\nspent $20 million for a two-floor\n, 10,000 square-foot penthouse across the building\u2019s 71st and 72nd floors. At least three other units have traded for more than $8 million: The 76th floor unit\nsold for $8.3 million in 2025\n, the 91st floor sold for $9.2 million and the 87th floor sold for $9 million, both in 2022.\nThe 78th floor penthouse\nsold for $7 million in 2024\n, a loss for the sellers who purchased it at $8.2 million.",

        "content": "Residents on the West and South sides of Chicago should buckle up for what\u2019s likely to be big jumps in their homes\u2019 tax assessments, extending a trend of the past two years.\nMore than 37,000 homes on the South and West sides saw their assessments double between 2023 and 2024, with parts of Englewood, Roseland and North Lawndale hit by median hikes ranging from 119 percent to 160 percent, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\nin partnership with the Illinois Answers Project. By comparison, the citywide median increase was about 22 percent, with affluent neighborhoods like the Gold Coast rising only 3 percent.\nMayor Brandon Johnson saw a 35 percent increase on his West Side home in the Austin neighborhood. The uneven pattern has left lower-income communities shouldering much of the pain stemming from rising property tax levies, even as their home values still trail the city at large.\nThe steep increases are expected to put struggling homeowners in a bind this fall when\nproperty tax bills come due\n. With property taxes in historically lower-valued and lower-income neighborhoods rising to make them unaffordable for current residents, there\u2019s few places for them to turn. Neighborhoods such as Englewood and North Lawndale will still have some of the lowest overall assessed property values, but their residents already experience some of the highest rates of poverty in the city.\nLeodus Thomas Jr., for example, who is also an Austin resident, said he bought his home for $135,000 in 2016 and has spent the past decade rehabbing other distressed properties to put them back on the tax rolls, he told the newspaper. Now, rising assessments threaten to upend his work.\n\u201cWe find properties and get them back on the tax roll \u2014 but lately we\u2019ve been punished for that, big-time,\u201d Thomas told the outlet.\nThomas\u2019 home was valued by the county at $163,000 just two years ago. Now, it\u2019s pegged at $260,000 \u2014 pushing his annual bill up by about $700. His spike is far from the worst.\nThe hikes are fueling fears of displacement and stalling investment. While rising assessments don\u2019t automatically increase tax bills,\nCook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi\u2019s office admits\nhomes with above-average increases face higher risks of steep rises.\n\nAssessments are legally tied to market activity, and Kaegi\u2019s staff points to investors buying up cheap lots and rehabbing older homes as the main driver. The pattern echoes earlier\ngentrification\ncycles in Pilsen and Logan Square, where sudden valuation spikes triggered tax revolts. Kaegi\u2019s staff sees these factors as the potential start of gentrification in these West and South side neighborhoods.\nSome homeowners are protected by exemptions. Retired CTA worker Clarence Hunt avoided a $1,700 bill after his senior freeze capped his home\u2019s taxable value at $60,000. But many longtime residents either don\u2019t know about such programs or don\u2019t apply, leaving them vulnerable.\nDevelopers and nonprofits active in Englewood and Lawndale have warned recently that speculative buyers \u2014 often LLCs scooping up multiple properties \u2014 are\ninflating comparable sales without investing\nin community needs.\nTax pressures could intensify. Chicago Public Schools and other taxing bodies have hiked levies in recent years, and the county treasurer\u2019s office recently found that appeals at the Board of Review have shifted nearly $2 billion in tax burden from commercial owners onto homeowners since 2021. Kaegi pitched a \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d bill in Springfield to soften shocks, but the proposal stalled.\nResidents like Thomas are left to juggle rising bills with fragile development plans for the time being.\n\u201cComing from the top, they want affordable housing in the city,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s almost impossible with how we\u2019re being taxed.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The redevelopment of Fort Worth\u2019s Woodhaven Country Club is galloping along, amid protests of NIMBY neighbors and the cloud of a legal battle involving the site.\nThe shuttered 163-acre property went into foreclosure and\nwas purchased last year for $8.5 million\nby Crescendo Development, led by investor\nWill Northern\n. The firm has since won\nzoning for a sweeping mixed-use redevelopment\nat 913 Country Club Lane in East Fort Worth that could bring a community center, housing, office space, an urban farm and a revamped golf course, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. Supporters \u2014 including the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce and local neighborhood groups \u2014 say the plan could revitalize an area long dominated by aging apartments and single-family homes.\nOpponents argue the project doesn\u2019t fit the community\u2019s demographics and fear it could displace longtime residents. At a Sept. 17 City Plan Commission meeting, Crescendo pitched the project as a $167.7 million private investment that would create nearly 1,000 jobs and generate $15.6 million in new tax revenue over the next decade. Commissioners delayed a vote until Oct. 1 to give residents more time to digest the application and review property impact studies.\nThe development push also comes with drama, as Northern\u2019s former business partner \u2014 Fort Worth City Council member Michael Crain \u2014\nsued him in June\n, claiming he was cut out of the Woodhaven deal. Crain\u2019s attorneys called it a \u201cpersonal betrayal,\u201d while Northern\u2019s legal team blasted the suit as a political play.\nThe suit also names a substitute trustee tied to the acquisition and seeks more than $1 million in damages, along with temporary and permanent injunctions to halt further action on the land. Crain abstained from the February rezoning vote.\n\nThe case has since been moved to the newly-created Texas Business Court, where Judge Jerry Bullard will preside. Crain\u2019s lawyers are trying to kick it back to state district court, arguing the deal doesn\u2019t meet the $5 million threshold for the new court\u2019s jurisdiction. Lawmakers in Texas recently lowered the minimum claim in business courts from $10 million. A hearing is set for Oct. 6 at Texas A&amp;M\u2019s Fort Worth campus.\nIn the meantime, Crescendo has started marketing slices of the property online. A 62-acre tract at 5500 Randol Mill Road is listed on LoopNet for $4 million, or about $65,000 an acre, while a Crexi posting shows the land has been up for grabs for nearly six months.\nCrescendo continues to pitch the Woodhaven project as a once-in-a-generation chance to reimagine a struggling corner of East Fort Worth, provided the courtroom wrangling doesn\u2019t derail the momentum.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Developer Aldo Stark found a buyer for the Stone Creek Ranch mansion he\u2019s seeking to flip for $45 million.\nIt was the top luxury contract signed in Palm Beach County last week. Buyers signed 11 contracts between Sept. 15 and Sept. 21 for luxury properties in Palm Beach County, according to a market report from\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s\nEklund-Gomes\nteam. The homes that went pending last week total $103.9 million in asking dollar volume and averaged 72 days on the market. That\u2019s up from\n$53.6 million\nin asking dollar volume for 11 homes the previous week.\nThe team\u2019s report tracks signed contracts for single-family homes and condos asking $3 million or more in the Beaches MLS. It identified 37 new listings, and a total of 1,017 active listings on the market.\nOf the properties that found buyers last week, nine were single-family homes and two were condos. The condos that went pending are asking an average of $8.8 million, or $1,499 per square foot, and spent an average of 31 days on the market.\nThe single-family homes total $95.1 million in asking dollar volume and averaged 114 days on the market. The average asking price works out to $10.6 million.\n\nThe most expensive home to find a buyer is spec developer Aldo Stark\u2019s 17,800-square-foot mansion at 9200 Rockybrook Way in\nStone Creek Ranch\n, asking $45 million. Stone Creek Ranch is a gated community in unincorporated Palm Beach County near Delray Beach. Stark bought the property in January for\n$26 million\nfrom the Ohio-based Cafaro family, whose late patriarch, William M. Cafaro, is credited with pioneering the American mall. The 2.7-acre estate was built in 2017 and includes a main house with seven bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, two half-bathrooms, a theater, wine room, gym and sauna, as well as a guest house, pool and cigar lounge, the listing shows.\nStark listed it for $45 million in March, Zillow shows. Senada Ad\u017eem with Douglas Elliman has the listing.\nThe second-priciest listing to find a buyer last week is the 5,600-square-foot waterfront home at 13209 Rolling Green Road asking $8.5 million. The 1.2-acre estate is in unincorporated Palm Beach County near\nNorth Palm Beach\n. Records show the seller is Dr. Gregory Delange, a cosmetic surgeon based in West Palm Beach. He bought the home for $6.8 million in 2023, according to property records. Built in 2014, the house has five bedrooms, five bathrooms, two half-bathrooms, a pool, a dock and 135 feet of frontage on the Intracoastal Waterway, records and the listing show.\nIt hit the market for $12.5 million last year, Zillow shows. Michael Ivancevic with Illustrated Properties has the listing.\n",

The Minnesota-based firm paid $30.1 million for it in 2015. Axial has been trying to unload the asset for more than two years, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. But rising rates and investor skittishness over offices stalled a deal. When listed at the end of 2022, the asking price was $31.4 million.\nThe firm is facing\npressure\nfrom a $21 million mortgage originated by Jacksonville-based Everbank, which matured in December. Rather than take the keys, the lender teamed with Axial to test the market for a sale that would at least clear the outstanding debt, a person familiar with the offering told the outlet. No asking price has been set. Clearing the mortgage alone would be about $111 per square foot.\nIt\u2019s a scenario playing out across Chicagoland, where\nrecord\nvacancies, remote work and expensive debt have landlords scrambling to refinance or hand properties back to lenders. Some banks are\nseizing\nbuildings outright, while others are opting for sales to cut losses.\nAxial is betting its building looks better than most, as the property is fully leased to medical device makers BD and Steris through 2031. BD is downsizing by nearly half next year, when it will exit 79,000 square feet. That leaves a looming hole Colliers is pitching as a future upside.\n\nThe flyer highlights the building\u2019s positioning in a Lake County cluster of life sciences tenants that have historically stuck around longer than typical office users. Neighbors include AbbVie, Abbott, Baxter and Pfizer. When Axial\nsold\nthe Bannockburn Corporate Center last year for $28 million \u2014 close to what it fetched in 2016 \u2014 it showed an appetite in the market for suburban offices with strong-credit tenants.\nBuilt in 1996, the Vernon Hills property is part of Continental Executive Park, just south of the Hawthorn Mall, itself in the\nmidst\nof a $252 million makeover with apartments, restaurants and open-air plazas.

The group landed a $135 million construction loan for The Lucy at 619 Grove Street, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n.\nKennedy Wilson provided the construction financing for the 444-unit project. On top of that, funds managed by PCCP invested into the project with an undisclosed amount of joint venture equity.\nA Cushman &amp; Wakefield team led by John Alascio brokered the debt deal and the equity transaction.\nThe 23-story property will consist of largely market-rate apartments, though there will be 13 affordable units. Other features include a rooftop pool, a sundeck replete with grills, outdoor terraces, a penthouse bar, coworking rooms, a fitness center, a game room and 251 parking spaces.\n\nThe design of the building, led by Michael Graves Architecture, will maintain much of the original structure of St. Lucy\u2019s Church, a historic Catholic church and rectory. Two years ago, Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Newark opened a 165-bed transitional housing facility across the street as part of the redevelopment.\n\u201cWe are proud to preserve the historic character of this site while creating a modern community that reflects Jersey City\u2019s dynamic growth,\u201d SJP chief executive officer Steven Pozycki said in a statement.\nElsewhere in the neighborhood, Adi Chugh\u2019s Tyko Capital last month\nprovided $358 million in construction financing\nfor the Namdar Group\u2019s projects at 29 Van Reipen Avenue and 612 Pavonia Avenue in Jersey City, expected to deliver more than 1,100 units to the Journal Square neighborhood.\nBlackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies also\nprovided a $515 million loan\nfor Kushner Companies\u2019 One Journal Square, which recently opened to residents.

        "content": "The Los Angeles Convention Center\u2019s long journey to expansion approval is seemingly nearing an end.\nOn Friday, the Los Angeles City Council\nvoted to proceed\nwith the latest plans to expand the downtown L.A. building with 190,000 square feet of new exhibit hall space, nearly 40,000 square feet of meeting space and a nearly 100,000-square-foot multi-service room, Commercial Observer\nreported\n.\nThe city is expected to cough up just over $2.6 billion via taxpayer money from its general fund,\naccording\nto the Los Angeles Times. The advancement of the expansion plans comes after more than 10 years and millions of public dollars spent on planning and revisions.\nMayor Karen Bass\n, several City Council members and some labor unions supported the expansion, saying the project invests in the future of Los Angeles as it deals with a budget deficit, insufficient tourism infrastructure and slow economic growth.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019m voting with my constituents, because I do believe in downtown,\u201d Council member Ysabel Jurado said before the vote, according to CO. \u201cAnd a strong downtown\u2026 needs this anchor in our communities to make sure we can rise again and rise to the occasion\u2026 It\u2019s about lifting up the entire city. And if we want a balanced budget and a thriving city, we need to invest.\u201d\nWhen all is said and done, the expanded Convention Center is expected to generate $652 million in general tax fund revenue over 30 years, as well as more than $150 million in annual visitor spending. In the construction period, 13,300 new jobs are expected to be created, with an additional 2,153 annual new jobs after the expansion is completed, per CO.\nThe city hopes to complete the first phase of the project in March 2028, four months ahead of the\nOlympics\nopening ceremony that July. Olympic and Paralympic events are slated to take place at the Convention Center, so if the project\u2019s first phase is delayed, they\u2019ll have to take place elsewhere. The full expansion project is expected to be finished in 2029.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The program is being seeded by a $50 million investment from the state, part of the housing plan included in the 2026 budget.\nUnder the program, up to 15 communities will be able to secure financing from the state in exchange for commitments to build at least 10 homes via manufactured housing on land free of zoning restrictions. The homes must be designed for middle and low-income residents.\nHomes have already been delivered in Syracuse, Schenectady and Newcomb. The goal is to deliver 200 manufactured and modular homes in the next year. Any company can bid to be part of the construction process.\n\u201cThis is the answer to how we can get the supply quickly,\u201d Gov. Kathy Hochul said to the Times, referencing the program and the manufactured housing process.\n\nManufactured housing comes in and out of vogue, particularly popping up at times of economic distress as the assembly and construction process often proves cheaper and more efficient than traditional homebuilding. But financing difficulties and stereotypes linking manufactured homes to trailer park properties keep them from gaining consistent momentum.\nSolving the stigmatization might be hard, but the state is hoping to solve financing problems by requiring the homes to be built on land that will be sold with the home and implementing federal housing design guidelines to help increase eligibility for a traditional mortgage.\nRather than penalizing municipalities for lack of participation, the state is\nproviding incentives\nfor cooperation, such as zero-point loans and partial grants.\nEvery home counts, but even if the program meets its goal, it will be a drop in the bucket next to the\n800,000 units\nthe state needs to address its housing shortage by the end of the decade, according to the Regional Plan Association.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Even before my\nprevious column\nabout the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmortgage fraud\u201d allegations against Letitia James, I knew many folks in the real estate industry despised the New York attorney general.\nTheir low opinion of her has since become even more obvious as some cheered President Donald Trump\u2019s revenge play, or argued that James had actually committed a crime.\nSome advice: When you\u2019re in a hole, stop digging.\nMore details have emerged showing just how weak the \u201cmortgage fraud\u201d claim is. It is beyond flimsy. I would call it laughable, except there is nothing really funny about a president fabricating criminal cases against political opponents.\nShould this ever reach a courtroom, any first-year law student could defend James and win, unless the jury were composed of Trump lackeys who\naccept $50,000 cash payments\nin food bags.\nAs in any real estate transaction, James signed a bunch of documents when she and her niece bought a house in Virginia for the niece to live in. One form was a limited power of attorney so her niece could do the closing without her. Drafted for a third-party closing company from a template that was never corrected, it indicated the house would be a primary residence.\nThat was the \u201cfraud,\u201d according to Bill Pulte, Trump\u2019s Federal Housing Finance Agency chief, and Ed Martin, the hack in charge of weaponizing the Department of Justice. Martin leads the department\u2019s Weaponization Working Group, if you can believe they actually named it that.\nPulte and Martin claimed this document allowed James to get a lower interest rate on the mortgage. But the document had nothing to do with her mortgage. The loan officers told investigators they never even considered it.\nMoreover, every other document in the transaction showed the Virginia home would not be James\u2019 primary residence. And it\u2019s no secret that she is New York\u2019s attorney general. Clearly, James was not trying to deceive anyone, nor did the single flawed form provide her any benefit.\nTo sum up, there was neither an intent to commit a crime nor a result. James\u2019 infraction was the equivalent of accidentally bringing a regular-size tube of toothpaste through airport security.\nEven critics of James freely admit the probe is retaliation by Trump for James\u2019 prosecution of him for inflating the value of his properties on loan applications. \u201cAbsolute stain on our democracy and its ideals,\u201d one lawyer emailed me. \u201cDisgusting power revenge play against a political enemy.\u201d\nThe lawyer, incidentally, insisted James\u2019 action was technically fraud because \u201cshe is responsible for what she signs.\u201d\nBut to prosecute someone for that is preposterous. Imagine stepping on gum while shopping, walking out of the store with the gum stuck to your shoe and being arrested for stealing it. That is the level of pettiness here.\n\nSo much actual crime \u2014 Medicare fraud, internet scams, you name it \u2014 with real victims is never pursued because law enforcement lacks the resources to do so. Yet in probing James, a team of investigators interviewed or put before a grand jury 15 people, including insurers, loan officers, underwriters, real estate agents and James\u2019 niece, according to\nABC News\n.\nTrump wasted prosecutors\u2019, witnesses\u2019 and jurors\u2019 time while making a mockery of the justice system and openly demonstrating a presidential abuse of authority.\nThe latest is that U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert, the\ntop federal prosecutor\nin the prestigious Eastern District of Virginia,\nwas fired\nfor refusing to bring the unwinnable and unjust case. Siebert was a\nTrump nominee\n.\nTrump replaced him with Maggie Clearly. It\u2019s ironic that in May she pledged \u201cto end politically weaponized investigations.\u201d\nAlthough James\u2019 prosecution of Trump was itself politically motivated, she did have a credible case: She won a conviction that was upheld by the well-respected Appellate Division, even as it threw out the gigantic financial penalty imposed by Judge Arthur Engoron.\nJames wasn\u2019t the only political target accused of mortgage fraud by the administration. So was Federal Reserve governor\nLisa Cook\n, whose crime against Trump was not lowering interest rates as quickly as he wanted (a power she does not unilaterally possess).\nTrump\u2019s people found standardized federal mortgage forms for her second-home purchase in Atlanta, indicating it would be her primary residence. But Reuters found that stipulation exists \u201c\nunless the lender agrees in writing\n,\u201d according to a document filed in a Georgia court for Cook\u2019s transaction.\nGuess what? The lender did agree in writing. \u201cProperty use: vacation home,\u201d its loan estimate says.\nPutting a cap on Pulte\u2019s farcical fraud hunt (an effort to endear himself to Trump), ProPublica\nreported\nthat three members of the president\u2019s cabinet claim primary-residence status on two mortgaged homes.\nThat is legal if each loan application was honestly made. Former House member Lee Zeldin, who owns a house on Long Island, bought a place in Washington when he joined the administration. So did Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary, who had purchased a New Jersey home with a principal residence loan in 2021.\nBut the third cabinet member\u2019s mortgage looks suspicious. \u201cLabor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer entered into two primary-residence mortgages in quick succession, including for a second home near a country club in Arizona, where she\u2019s known to vacation,\u201d ProPublica reported.\nHoist by their own petard, it would appear.\n",

Ron DeSantis is eyeing a parking lot next to Miami\u2019s Freedom Tower for a Donald Trump presidential library.\nThe state\u2019s top elected official plans to submit an item to the Florida Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund to convey the 2.6-acre parcel at 500-540 Biscayne Boulevard in downtown Miami for the project, which would be the first presidential library in Florida, a press release states. The board would vote on the item at its Sept. 30 meeting.\n\u201cNo state has better delivered the President\u2019s agenda than the Free State of Florida,\u201d DeSantis said in a statement. \u201cAnd we would be honored to house his presidential library here in his home state.\u201d\nTrump\n, the 45th and 47th president of the United States, maintains his primary residence at his private\nMar-a-Lago\nClub in Palm Beach.\n\nThe improvement trust fund\u2019s trustees are\nDeSantis\n, Attorney General James Uthmeier, Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia and Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson. The board is responsible for the acquisition, management, protection and disposition of state lands.\nThe parking lot is currently utilized by employees of Miami-Dade College\u2019s Wolfson Campus. On Tuesday morning, the college\u2019s board of trustees voted to transfer the property to the state, the\nMiami Herald\nreported. The college also owns Freedom Tower, which recently reopened after a $25 million renovation.\nFreedom Tower\nis arguably the most iconic building in downtown Miami. Built in 1925, the 17-story Spanish Renaissance Revival high-rise was the first home of the defunct Miami News. In the 1960s and 1970s, the building served as the Cuban Refugee Center, assisting hundreds of thousands of Cuban immigrants. In 2005, Freedom Tower was donated to Miami-Dade College, which converted the building into a museum.\nDeSantis has been seeking to patch up a strained relationship with Trump following the 2024 Republican presidential primary when the governor was among several candidates hoping to unseat the billionaire developer as the GOP\u2019s leader. Trump\u2019s campaign ran bruising attacks against DeSantis, who withdrew his presidential candidacy in January of last year after his campaign concluded he had no path to victory, published reports state.\nRecently, DeSantis and his administration sought to boost the Trump administration\u2019s\nimmigration crackdown\nby converting a former air strip in the Everglades into a detention facility they dubbed Alligator Alcatraz. A U.S. appeals court recently blocked a lower court ruling ordering that the facility be closed.",

        "content": "Anthropic is beefing up its downtown San Francisco headquarters.\nThe artificial intelligence giant, hot off raising $13 billion in investments this month, leased several floors of office space at the Foundry Square III building, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. The company is taking about 100,000 square feet, almost a third of the 10-story building.\nThe building at 505 Howard Street spans more than 300,000 square feet and is across the street from Anthropic\u2019s current headquarters at Foundry Square IV. Anthropic subleased more than 230,000 square feet in that building from Slack, which shifted to a remote-first work model after the pandemic. That deal was one of the largest local transactions in years, though it was outdone by competitor\nOpenAI, which leased buildings\nspanning nearly 1 million square feet for its headquarters in Mission Bay.\nTerms of Anthropic\u2019s headquarters lease, including how long the company will be in the space, were not disclosed, though reportedly both the new lease and the sublease expire in 2028.\nThe 505 Howard building\u2019s other tenants include accounting juggernaut KPMG, which\nleased 100,000 square feet\nin the building a year ago after it chose not renew its lease at its longtime headquarters on Second Street. Intuit also moved into 505 Howard recently, exiting an office on Fourth Street that it occupied for a decade. KPMG and Intuit downsized in their moves to 505 Howard.\n\nAs San Francisco battles high post-pandemic office vacancy and slow-but-steady\nreturn to work\n, other companies have similarly signed on to less space than they previously occupied. Office vacancy is at 34.6 percent, down from a peak of 36.9 percent in the third quarter of last year, according to CBRE.\nThe AI sector is expected to revive the city \u2014 and its office market \u2014 with an influx of workers over the next five years. By 2030, more than 50,000 AI workers are predicted to flock to San Francisco, while AI firms\u2019 office space inventory is expected to balloon from 5 million to more than 20 million square feet,\ncutting the city\u2019s vacancy rate in half\n, per CBRE.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

In March, gaming mogul Richard Skelhorn dropped a record\n$45 million\nfor the waterfront mansion at 40 Palm Avenue, making it the most expensive home ever sold on the island.

At the time, it was the largest reposted default on a loan tied to an office property in the\nJohn Wayne Airport area\nin more than five years, according to the Business Journal.

That transaction was a recapitalization of the asset where Hines brought in Goldman Sachs to replace its original partner Oaktree Capital, keeping a 5 percent interest in the property while Goldman Sachs owned the remaining 95 percent, according to CoStar data cited by the Business Journal.\nElsewhere in Newport Beach, earlier this month, locally based real estate company\nCress Capital bought a 215,000-square-foot office building\nat 1301 Dove Street for $41 million, or $191 per square foot.

        "content": "Industry leaders that could benefit from further development of data centers in the greater Chicago area are honing in on changes to a privacy law they say is causing the region to lose out on projects.\nIllinois\u2019 Biometric Information Privacy Act, a 2008 law requiring consent before companies collect or use biometric data, has become a flashpoint as artificial intelligence drives unprecedented demand for data centers, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The volume of data center construction in North America is set to more than double over the next five years, fueled by AI workloads, according to JLL. But hyperscalers like Amazon, Google and Microsoft are bypassing Illinois, fearing costly class-action suits under BIPA, developers say.\nBIPA has stalled projects in Illinois while billions flow next door, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.\n\u201cNorth of $100 billion\u201d worth of hyperscale campuses \u2014 prime tax generators \u2014 have gone to Indiana, Wisconsin, Iowa and Michigan instead, JLL\u2019s Andy Cvengros said. Amazon alone is building an $11 billion campus near South Bend, Indiana, while Microsoft and Google are planting multi-billion-dollar flags across Wisconsin and Indiana.\nChicago slipped from the No. 2 or 3 data center market in North America pre-2022 to seventh this year. The\nlocal pipeline\nis softening too, with many projects unleased past 2026, even as 80 percent of data center development nationally comes pre-leased.\nDevelopers and labor unions argue that Illinois\u2019 unusual position \u2014 ample power supply and surplus clean energy \u2014 should make it a magnet for\nhyperscale builds\n. Instead,\nneighboring states\nare reaping the tax revenues and construction jobs.\nThe irony isn\u2019t lost on labor. Don Finn of IBEW Local 134 said that instead of the handful of tower cranes up in Chicago, there should be more like 20 or 30 if more projects went Chicago\u2019s way. He said\ndata centers\nare nearly half his members\u2019 workload. The AFL-CIO has also lined up behind efforts to revisit BIPA, framing it as an economic development play.\nBut trial lawyers and privacy advocates are pushing back, casting the industry\u2019s lobbying as a Trojan horse.\n\n\u201cBIPA is the firewall that protects Illinois workers and consumers,\u201d said Timothy Cavanagh of the Illinois Trial Lawyers Association. The ACLU calls claims of lost investment an attempt to gut one of the strongest privacy laws in the country.\nLawmakers tweaked BIPA two years ago to curb runaway damages, but efforts to exempt or clarify its application for AI and data centers are contentious.\n\u201cSome sort of clarification is in the realm of possibility,\u201d said State Sen. Bill Cunningham, who shepherded the last amendment. He said a clarification could be made in the law that wouldn\u2019t give data center developers pause.\n\u201cAn exemption for AI is a much heavier lift,\u201d Cunningham said.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Michael Nierenberg knows how to get a steal on a real estate deal \u2014 professionally and personally.\nHis Rithm Capital agreed on Sept. 17 to acquire Paramount Group\nfor $1.6 billion\n, a rare entrance into the commercial real estate market with Class A office space at a low entry point as the Federal Reserve was expected to \u2014 and did \u2014\nlower interest rates\n.\nOne of the largest U.S. mortgage servicers, Rithm\nannounced the news\nafter\nThe Real Deal\nand other outlets\nreported\nit was in the lead to acquire New York-based Paramount. The sale, subject to shareholder approval, is expected to close in the fourth quarter.\n\u201cWe\u2019re entering at 30 percent of what it would cost to replace these assets,\u201d the CEO said in an investor conference call about the deal. \u201cThe valuation on these assets are roughly 40 percent of pre-Covid levels.\u201d\nThe bargain deal involves a portfolio comprising 13.1 million square feet spread across 13 owned and four managed office assets in New York City and San Francisco. Those holdings include 1633 Broadway, 1301 Avenue of the Americas and 60 Wall Street, all in New York City, and One Market Plaza and 300 Mission Street, both in San Francisco.\nIn April Nierenberg\ntold Bloomberg TV\nthe firm\u2019s \u201cM&amp;A calendar, or pipeline, is fairly active.\u201d\nRithm, which Nierenberg has been leading since its inception, has $36 billion in assets under management and roughly $100 billion in investible assets.\nPrior to joining, Nierenberg, 63, who is also president and chairman of the board at Rithm, was a managing director and head of global mortgages and securitized products at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He also held senior leadership roles at J.P. Morgan, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.\nThe executive\u2019s compensation was $21.1 million in 2024, per an SEC filing. He works with his son, Jonathan Nierenberg, a vice president at the firm who goes by Jonny and tied the knot this year. The younger Nierenberg was hired in 2022 as an investment associate, with a base salary of $150,000 and the ability to receive a discretionary bonus, according to a 2023 SEC\nfiling\n.\nRithm, first named New Residential Investment, was founded in 2013, a few years after the financial crisis, as an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group with a focus on mortgage-related assets. Over the years, it began internalizing management, ultimately rebranding as Rithm Capital in 2022. Since then, the firm began\nshedding its association\nwith subprime mortgage leader Fortress in order to raise outside capital and expand its asset management platform.\nThe strategy seemed to work. The following year, Rithm purchased asset manager Sculptor Capital Management for $720 million. And more recently, it signed a deal to buy Crestline, a $17 billion private lender. That deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter.\n\u201cWe started as a REIT, and now we\u2019re going to try to morph into some kind of capital structure that looks like some of the largest money managers in the world,\u201d Nierenberg\ntold\nBloomberg at the time, comparing Rithm\u2019s future self to heavyweights like Ares, Apollo and Starwood.\n\nToday, the New York City-based firm boasts 200 investment professionals and has been looking for a way to enter the commercial office market for a long time.\n\u201cThe past couple of years we did a lot of brand building around the house,\u201d Nierenberg said to Bloomberg Television. \u201cI think now, we are going to start to see the fruit of that labor really come into play for the company.\u201d\nThe Paramount deal comes amid controversy surrounding its CEO Albert Behler, including a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\ninvestigation\ninto undisclosed payments and concerns about executive compensation and conflicts of interest.\nRithm plans to acquire the outstanding shares of Paramount\u2019s common stock for $6.60 per diluted share, slightly below the firm\u2019s stock price prior to the announcement.\n\u201cVery rarely do you have the opportunity to acquire what we deem are A assets at a discount-to-book value at what we deem the beginning of the so-called office market recovery,\u201d Nierenberg said on the investor call.\nParamount began looking into a sale of the company in May after analysts and investors raised concerns about the management of the company and executives\u2019 pay levels relative to its stock performance. Rithm ultimately won the multiple-round bidding process.\nLooking forward, Rithm seeks to \u201ccontinue to diversify our investment strategies,\u201d Nierenberg said on the call.\nAs in work, Nierenberg \u2014 who spent the last 28 years as board chairman for the Samuel Waxman Cancer Research Foundation \u2014 knows how to get a good real estate deal on the home front.\nHe and his wife Elin bought a Greenwich Village penthouse triplex once listed at $50 million for $14 million in 2021, the\nNew York Post reported\n. The sale price was even less than the home\u2019s last asking price of $16.5 million.\nLocated near Rithm\u2019s office, the East 11th Street home features four bedrooms across 7,693 square feet with a 2,300-square-foot roof terrace that includes a solarium.\nThe firm declined to comment to\nTRD\n.\n",

The industrial business park has nearly 70 dock-high doors, nine grade-level doors and a 160-foot truck loading area.

The previous owner was an affiliate of Essex Property Trust, according to the Business Times; the firm could not be reached for comment by the publication.\nThe transaction for the 171-unit five-story property at 2020 Fourth Street totaled roughly $305,847 per unit. In addition to the residences, the building contains 15,000 square feet of retail across eight suites.\nSack Capital plans to make interior and exterior renovations to the property and add on-site property management and leasing, according to the Business Times. The company looks to \u201caddress the affordability gap between renting and owning\u201d in Berkeley, Jeff Smith, managing partner with Sack Capital, said.\nThe Berkeley property was originally built as condominiums in 2010, and offers mostly one-bedroom units with some two-bedrooms. It sits south of Berkeley\u2019s Fourth street retail corridor.\n\nSack\u2019s purchase of the 171-unit five-story property at 2020 4th Street marks the company\u2019s third acquisition in the past few weeks. Earlier this month, Sack\nacquired the 164-unit Fountain Park apartments\nin San Jose for $52 million. After that, Sack arranged structured financing on behalf of Step Up Housing to buy the 148-unit Bayside Apartment Homes in Pinole for $36.9 million; Sack will provide asset and property management there.\nThe multifamily market in Berkeley has seen several apartment buildings come under new ownership in recent years as a glut of units increased supply and drove down rents.\nIn February, Read Investments bought the 98-unit eight-story Higby apartment building for $32 million after the property was seized by its lender via a deed in lieu of foreclosure last year. A month later, Artemis Real Estate Partners bought the 143-unit Berkeley Central apartments for $55 million, or about 40 percent below the property\u2019s assessed value.\nEarlier this summer, the\nUniversity Park apartments\nat 1709 Shattuck Avenue and 1710 Walnut Street headed to foreclosure auction after owner\nAcademy West Investments\ndefaulted on payments on a loan tied to the complex.

It is unclear how much space the firm had before the deal.\nThe six-story, 175,000-square-foot building was constructed in 1993 and renovated in 2019.The property is about 20 miles southeast of Houston and adjacent to the spaceport. It is owned by Houston-based developer JA Billipp Company, which bought the building from Boeing in 2018, after Boeing consolidated its office into a property in the Clear Lake neighborhood.\nThe area is a hub for Third Coast Chemicals, which moved its headquarters to the building in 2023 after signing a lease for 22,000 square feet.\nThe first phase of Houston Spaceport was completed in 2019. It is home to campuses for companies such as Collins Aerospace and Axiom Space. A second phase will bring retail and hospitality to the port and more infrastructure development.\n\nHouston\u2019s office market has been struggling to rebound after the pandemic changed remote work norms. Companies started seeking out offices with high-end amenities and strategic locations for their workforces, leaving older office buildings to fall into obsolescence.\nVacancy at properties built since 2010 averaged 14.9 percent at the end of the first quarter, compared to 27.5 percent in older properties, according to Partners Real Estate. The overall market vacancy rate was 26.2 percent.\nSaber Power isn\u2019t just growing its physical presence; in May, it acquired InoLECT, an electrical engineering company based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\nSaber, which was founded in 2010, was purchased by Greenbelt Capital Management in 2023.\n",

As a result, the\nSeminole Tribe\nis on the hook for reimbursing damages and out-of-pocket relocation expenses amounting to \u201ctens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars,\u201d the complaint states.\nThe Seminole Tribe alleges that houses Lennar developed on Seminole reservations in the state have significant construction issues, including faulty roofing and ventilation systems, leading to potentially hazardous mold growth.\n\u201cIt is just a huge disappointment for people in the tribe that relied on Lennar,\u201d said Wiliam Scherer, the Seminole Tribe\u2019s attorney. \u201cWe were working in good faith, and [Lennar] led us down a garden path. They promised they would fix the homes. The longer it went, our engineers examining the homes kept finding more problems.\u201d\nThe defects are so serious that the Seminole Tribe has to move families out of the 462 homes into temporary housing, Scherer said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a few years,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a major undertaking.\u201d\n\nA Lennar spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe Seminole Tribe and Lennar entered into a community development agreement in 2019. The two sides attempted mediation in March, but were not successful, the complaint states. The same month, the Seminole Tribe had filed its initial lawsuit, and the case was briefly stayed on April 29, as Lennar attempted remediation efforts on the homes that were unsuccessful, court filings show.\nThis month, Lennar filed two separate motions to compel arbitration and again stay the lawsuit, according to court records.\nBased in Hollywood, the Seminole Tribe owns the\nSeminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Hollywood\n, which includes a guitar-shaped hotel with 638 rooms.\nLennar, a publicly traded firm, is among the largest homebuilders in the U.S. Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway bought more than 7 million shares in Lennar for nearly\n$800 million\nin the first half of this year.\nLennar is heavily invested in south Miami-Dade County where the firm has several developments on tap. The company recently submitted plans for\nRetro West\n, a 106-townhome development near Homestead. The 10-acre project would include 11 townhomes set aside for workforce housing.",

        "content": "DEK:\nA Seattle-based real estate development firm bought an Embassy Suites in the northern Chicago suburbs for less than its value over a decade ago.\nBCI Pacific Real Estate bought the Embassy Suites Deerfield last month for $12.5 million, or $52,700 per key, from Los Angeles-based Broadshore Capital Partners. Broadshore is a former investment management subsidiary of Los Angeles-based real estate development firm Lowe Enterprises. Lowe sold off its interest in Broadshore in 2018.\nLowe bought the 237-room hotel out of distress in 2011 for $15 million, prior to selling off its investment management subsidiary to Broadshore. The hotel underwent a \u201cmultimillion dollar renovation\u201d that was completed in 2019, according to Hotel News Resource.\nThe owners took out multiple lines of credit on the 1445 Lake Cook Road property but it\u2019s unclear exactly how much Lowe or Broadshore spent on the renovations.\nBroadshore declined to comment, and BCI did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe property fell into tough financial shape after the Great Recession. Prior owner FelCor Lodging Trust relinquished the property to its lender in 2010. Around that time it was appraised at $11 million, falling short of FelCor\u2019s $14 million mortgage on the property.\n\nIts most recent property tax appraisal came in at $16 million.\nDepending on the structure of the BCI\u2019s recent deal, it\u2019s possible Broadshore recouped some costs via closing cost credits or other incentives.\nThe sale reflects Chicago\u2019s generally uneven recovery from the pandemic. The multifamily and industrial sectors have fared well since the pandemic but others, like retail and hospitality, have had less stable recoveries. Meanwhile, the office market, except among Class A buildings, is languishing amid record high vacancy rates.\nWhile tourism and business travel has improved, some hotel properties are still struggling.\nIn Western suburban Lombard, a venture of Chelsea Hospitality Partners and Seaview Investors is facing\na $25 million foreclosure of an Embassy Suites property\nat 707 East Butterfield Road.\nA $25.3 million loan backed by the 262-room hotel at 707 East Butterfield Road in Lombard is in default after the borrower failed to pay it off ahead of a May 22 maturity, according to Morningstar Credit. Phoenix-based Western Alliance Bank originated the loan in 2019 and it was later sold off to commercial mortgage-backed securities investors, making details of its performance public.\nA July loan report stated that the \u201cborrower has no plans to refinance,\u201d and added that the lender\u2019s counsel is preparing to send the landlord a default notice as well as a pre-negotiation agreement. The agreement could provide an opportunity for a workout plan for the debt if they end up interested in keeping the asset.",

The plant cranks out Model Ys and the Cybertruck, which are shuttled through a Boring Co. tunnel beneath Texas 130 to staging areas. The main facility is nearly three quarters of a mile long.\nAbout 20 miles east, in Bastrop, Musk\u2019s tunneling startup has carved out more than 350 acres for testing\ngiant boring machines\nand housing staff in a makeshift village called Snailbrook. Across the road, SpaceX runs a 700,000-square-foot Starlink factory that turns out 70,000 satellite kits a week, with plans to double in size. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott sweetened the deal earlier this year with a $17.3 million grant tied to a $280 million SpaceX expansion.\nFarther south, SpaceX has converted scrubland near\nBrownsville\ninto \u201cStarbase,\u201d\na de facto company town\nof nearly 500 residents and thousands of workers. The site hosts Starship, the tallest rocket ever built, along with more than 1 million square feet of manufacturing. The company is\npushing to expand\nits launchpad and add housing, retail and a grocery store.\n\nTesla\u2019s reach extends beyond Austin and Brownsville. Near Corpus Christi, the automaker is bringing a lithium refinery online in Robstown, meant to supply battery-grade material for 1 million EVs a year. Outside Dallas, Tesla Energy is building a 125-megawatt battery storage plant in Royse City, one of the largest in ERCOT\u2019s pipeline.\nBesides these properties, Musk\u2019s companies have leased facilities around the state. Southwest of Waco in McGregor, SpaceX leased land to test rockets. Plans are in place for Tesla to lease a 1.03 million-square-foot building in Brookshire, west of Houston, for a battery manufacturing plant.\nMusk has made no secret of why he\u2019s gone \u201call in\u201d on Texas: lighter regulation, lower taxes and control.\n\u201cElon Musk has more control in Texas than he does anywhere else,\u201d said Goran Calic, a McMaster University professor who studies Musk\u2019s management style.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The sellers were former Bank of America COO\nThomas Montag and his wife\n, philanthropist and former banker\nJanet Montag\n, who purchased the townhouse in 2008 for $32.5 million. The latest transaction represents a 19 percent discount from its prior trade price. The renovated property was built in 1904 by Stanford White and measures 10,000 square feet. It has six bedrooms, five bathrooms, a basketball court, an elevator and a garden.\nPatricia Farman-Farmaian\nand\nLaurie Stolowitz\nwith Compass represented the sellers, who first put the home on the market in April 2024 for $36 million. The new owner is an LLC, which took out a $17.1 million mortgage with\nJPMorgan Chase Bank\nfor the purchase.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe estate of\nCarol Bernstein\nand an LLC managed by\nStanley Levin\nshed a three-story, mental health facility at\n38-11 Broadway\nin Astoria for about $9.8 million, marking the top commercial deal recorded in the city. The buyer was an LLC tied to\nJack Cohen\u2019s Comjem Associates.\nThe nearly 32,000-square-foot building appears to have been tied to the Bernstein and Levin families for decades.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nTwo neighboring apartment complexes, at\n499 and 503 Evergreen Avenue\nin Bushwick, traded for $8.3 million. The buyer was an affiliate of Great Neck, New York-based\nParkview Properties\n. The seller was developer\nUrban View Development Group\n.

        "content": "A long-delayed plan to legalize casitas and granny flats across Chicago is moving forward, but only after aldermen scaled it back with restrictions designed to protect single-family neighborhoods.\nAldermen Bennett Lawson and Marty Quinn ended a year-long stalemate over the\ncitywide expansion\nof accessory dwelling units, or ADUs. Their compromise kept Quinn\u2019s union-backed amendment requiring contractors to hire through certified apprentice programs for new construction, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The Chicago Federation of Labor and building trades had pressed hard for the measure, warning they would sink the ordinance otherwise.\nThe compromise, however, also gave aldermen near-total control over ADUs in single-family zones. Detached units will be banned in low-density districts unless a local alderman opts in. Even then, construction will be capped at one to three ADUs per block, depending on zoning. Detached houses that add an ADU must be owner-occupied. For multi-unit districts, ADUs will be allowed by right.\nThe legislation also scrapped a 700-square-foot size cap on coach houses but maintains a 22-foot height limit and other spacing rules. A Chicago City Council vote is expected Thursday.\nLawson had pushed for a broader legalization effort, framing ADUs as a way to chip away at Chicago\u2019s estimated 120,000-unit affordable housing shortage by creating unsubsidized, naturally occurring affordable units.\n\n\u201cIf you could build a two-flat, you can build an ADU,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cThis is a citywide ordinance. It\u2019s a big expansion.\u201d\nBut Quinn and allies leveraged organized labor\u2019s support to force concessions, arguing aldermen must retain veto power over zoning changes in their wards. The compromise underscores the Council\u2019s long-standing practice of\n\u201caldermanic prerogative.\u201d\nProgressives, including Mayor Brandon Johnson, had championed ADUs as a modest but citywide affordability fix. Johnson struck a diplomatic tone, saying he was \u201cgrateful\u201d the measure advanced despite aldermanic resistance.\nThe compromise leaves Chicago with a narrower ADU policy than housing advocates hoped for, but it marks the first meaningful\nexpansion\nsince the city launched a\nlimited pilot program\nin 2021.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "After a\nlong and controversial road\n, the Department for the Aging is officially relocating to 14 Wall Street in Lower Manhattan.\nThe Department of Citywide Administrative Services signed a 20-year lease for 81,000 square feet at Alexander Rovt\u2019s property, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The deal at the property owned by Rovt, an investor who has donated to Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 campaigns and legal fund, is worth $77 million.\nIn the first five years of the lease, the city will pay Rovt $33 per square foot. Every five years, the price per square foot will escalate, capped at $44 per square foot. It\u2019s unclear when the Department for the Aging will relocate from 2 Lafayette Street.\n\u201cI evaluated the deal, and it was clear that 14 Wall St. was the best economic deal for the city,\u201d DCAS Commissioner Louis Molina said.\nThe process for securing the lease has been ripe with criticism, particularly accusations that city officials steered the move towards an Adams donor. Former DCAS deputy commissioner Jesse Hamilton, who\nresigned\nlast month, has been at the center of the controversy involving city office leases. He\u2019s been indicted on corruption charges, though 14 Wall Street was not part of the indictment.\n\nHamilton reportedly stepped into the lease procurement process to push the deal towards Rovt, even though AmTrust Realty\u2019s 250 Broadway was the top pick for the lease, based on an internal scoring system.\nAn internal review by DCAS \u2014 which did not look at Hamilton\u2019s actions \u2014 determined that the agency followed proper procedures when it came to evaluating the lease possibilities. Additionally, DCAS claimed the 250 Broadway lease would\u2019ve cost a total of an additional $16 million for taxpayers and said Department of the Aging officials preferred 14 Wall.\nRovt donated $9,200 to Adams\u2019 mayoral and Brooklyn borough president campaigns and a further $5,000 for his legal defense fund. His wife and son have also made donations to the mayor.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Compass\u2019 plan to acquire Anywhere Real Estate for $1.6 billion would further consolidate the brokerages\u2019 dominance in South Florida, where brands carry significant weight.\nCompass, already a Goliath in residential real estate, will have more than 340,000 agents under its banner, representing about 20 percent of all Realtors in the country, if the\nacquisition\nis completed in the second half of next year. Still, Compass won\u2019t control the majority of the market nationwide.\nYet, an analysis by\nThe Real Deal\nshows the deal would cement the new Compass-owned company\u2019s position as the top brokerage in Miami-Dade County. Combined, Compass and Anywhere\u2019s brands closed $9.5 billion in on-market sales in Miami-Dade County in the 12 months ended in August,\nTRD\nresearch shows.\nCompass, led by CEO Robert Reffkin, will control five of the top 10 performing brokerages in Miami-Dade. In addition to its own brand and Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, which it bought last year in a\n$444 million\npurchase of @properties, the brokerage will own the legacy brands that include Coldwell Banker, the Corcoran Group, Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, Century 21, Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate and ERA.\nThough the Anywhere brands will stay intact, Compass will absorb its fiercest competition in Miami-Dade: Coldwell Banker. With that comes the\nJills Zeder Group\n, led by Jill Eber, Jill Hertzberg and Judy Zeder, which consistently ranks as the top agent team in the U.S. Last year, the Jills Zeder Group ranked first with $923 million in on-market sales, according to\nTRD research\n.\nAmong other top agents that will come under the new company\u2019s umbrella are Corcoran\u2019s Julian Johnston, Mick Duchon and Eloy Carmenate.\nCompass and Anywhere agents represent about half of the top 25 agents in Miami-Dade, as determined by on-market sales volume in the 12 months ended in August. The agents\u2019 combined dollar volume totaled $3.4 billion in on-market sales, according to\nTRD\nresearch.\nTime will tell how the acquisition will affect recruiting, but it could drive away agents who are looking for a more personalized firm, some brokers say.\n\n\u201cYou now have homogenized a bunch of brands under one brand,\u201d said Mercedes Saewitz, senior vice president of operations at Aperture Global Real Estate, a Florida-based national brokerage firm. \u201cYou are sort of losing the identity of it.\u201d\nIt\u2019s still early, Saewitz said.\n\u201cPeople are digesting it, [but] there\u2019s no rush of the gates. They\u2019re not slated to close on this until Q2 2026,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m interested in seeing what the movement is from those brands into Compass.\u201d\nThe deal will mark the latest chapter in the industry\u2019s history of increased consolidation, as profit margins continue to shrink.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a high volume, low profit business,\u201d said Mike Pappas, CEO of the Keyes Company, the largest independent brokerage firm in Florida. \u201cUnless they\u2019re going to transform the commission structure in their business, we don\u2019t see how it\u2019s going to be anything different than it\u2019s historically been.\u201d\nCompetitors\n, including smaller brokerages and local heavyweights, have already claimed the news as a win. Pappas sees opportunities to pick up people and office space post-merger, as the new Compass entity looks to cut $250 million in efficiencies.\nSaewitz, who left Compass at the end of last year, said she always expected the brokerage would make a major acquisition, but not this big. \u201cThey just proved to the world that consolidation is the new normal for our industry,\u201d she said.\nSheridan Wall contributed reporting.\n",

At the same time, the popular Los Angeles neighborhood \u201ccontinues to experience low vacancy and attractive rent growth,\u201d Westerberg added.\nBroadstone Los Feliz has a mix of studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments with access to a rooftop lounge, barbecue area, indoor swimming pool and spa, fitness center and electric vehicle charging stations. The property, at 1800 North New Hampshire Avenue, includes a total of 134 units. The outdoor lounge area offers unobstructed views of the Griffith Observatory and the Hollywood Sign, according to the Times.\nThe joint venture between Alliance and PCCP acquired the property in 2022 and has invested more than $1 million since then to revamp the common areas and upgrade the interiors of 33 units with hardwood flooring, quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances and new woodgrain cabinets. In total, two-thirds of the units have been renovated; the remaining ones will be renovated within the next two years, according to the Times. At the time of loan closing, the property was 95 percent occupied.\n\nMesa West has swooped in with eight-figure loans to various residential and commercial ventures in Southern California in recent months.\nEarlier this month, Mesa West\nprovided a $68.5 million acquisition loan\nto Legacy Partners for an apartment community in Azusa. Legacy Partners bought the vacant apartments at 801 East Alosta Avenue from Azusa Pacific University for a total of $91.8 million.\nIn July, Mesa West\nlent $55 million to an affiliate of Seaview Investors\nfor the Burton House Beverly Hills hotel.

        "content": "Sergio Pino\u2019s widow, Tatiana, and their daughters filed a new lawsuit against Pino\u2019s longtime mistress and others they claim were involved in allegedly fraudulent transfers in the days before and after his suicide.\nSergio Pino\n, a prominent South Florida homebuilder, died in July 2024 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound as FBI agents were closing in on raiding his waterfront Coral Gables home and arresting him over allegations he attempted to murder his wife through poisoning and the hiring of hitmen.\nPino founded Coral Gables-based Century Homebuilders Group, one of the biggest Hispanic-owned homebuilders nationwide. He and\nTatiana\nPino were in the midst of a highly contentious divorce when he died.\nHis death\nsparked a fight\nover the future of Century Homebuilders. Pino had a longtime girlfriend, Nancy Pastor, whom he had started dating in the early 2000s, according to court filings.\nPastor\u2019s involvement at Century Midtown in\nDoral\nis at the center of this latest lawsuit. Tatiana Pino, Century Homebuilders (which Tatiana Pino now leads as president), Century Real Estate Fund GP, and the former couple\u2019s daughters, Alessandra and Carolina Pino, sued Pastor, Century Midtown Club and Fitness Center LLC, attorney Eugenio Duarte and Century\u2019s former CFO Joseline Pereira last week in Miami-Dade Circuit Court.\nThe lawsuit focuses on trust and lease documents created or amended by Duarte in March and July of last year related to Century Midtown, a mixed-use development with condos, apartments and a clubhouse.\n\u201cIn July 2024 as Sergio Pino\u2019s multi-year efforts to kill Tatiana, his joint partner/owner by the entireties of CHG, failed, and with the FBI and the police closing in, certain documents related to the collateralized clubhouse were purportedly executed by Sergio without the consent of the bank, his project partners, Tatiana, or those he sought to transfer control to all of his interests in Century Fitness and the Clubhouse, among other things,\u201d the complaint states.\nThe documents include a 99-year lease and two trusts, which Tatiana Pino and her daughters allege are likely invalid and were meant to benefit Pastor, according to the complaint.\n\u201cThese efforts were criminal, fraudulent, intentional and otherwise wrongful,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\nPastor\u2019s attorney, Michael Schlesinger, said in a statement to\nThe Real Deal\nthat Pastor did not receive any copies of the trusts until after Pino\u2019s death. Schlesinger wrote that Pastor\u2019s \u201csuccessful efforts in the sales and management of Sergio Pino projects led to Mr. Pino and his companies profiting by millions\u201d and that she was put in management positions because of her experience.\n\u201cTo set the record straight, for over the past decade that Ms. Pastor was affiliated with Mr. Pino\u2019s businesses and ventures, she never witnessed Ms. [Tatiana] Pino involved in any business transaction until she took over after his untimely death,\u201d he said. \u201cMs. Pastor has never done anything illegal and has always been ethical and transparent in all Estate matters.\u201d\nThe trust signed and dated March 11, 2024 has metadata that demonstrates it was actually created and sent on March 13, 2024. Tatiana and her daughters allege the March 11 date is not a coincidence. It\u2019s about the time when Sergio learned the Feds were onto his alleged plot to have Tatiana Pino killed. It\u2019s when one of the hitmen, Bayron Bennett, had his court hearing following his arrest.\nThe second trust was dated July 15, 2024, one day before Sergio\u2019s death.\nPereira, Century Homebuilders\u2019 former CFO, directed Duarte to prepare the 99-year lease of the clubhouse at Century Midtown. In an email included in the complaint, Duarte expressed his concerns over a transfer.\n\u201cEach transfer, assignment, appointment, etc., can potentially alter the relationship with third parties (or even require the consent of third parties) and we have to be careful not to make any decisions in haste without considering all the possible consequences with Century\u2019s relationship with others,\u201d Duarte wrote. \u201cAll changes should be made considering the ultimate purpose, consequence, and need for each change. I do not want to question any decisions, but I am concerned that some of these changes are not needed, and in fact they may bring detrimental consequences.\u201d\nDuarte did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe ownership of the Century Midtown property at 2038, 8075 and 8175 Northwest 107th Avenue is creating issues for the sale or refinancing of Century Town Center, the lawsuit alleges.\nCBRE was hired to secure lenders or potential buyers for the property. But it has not been able to obtain a refinancing because third party lenders \u201cdetermined that the existing partners would not be acceptable guarantors,\u201d which means that Century Midtown would have to be sold or recapitalized with a new partner, according to the complaint.\n",

        "content": "Compass\u2019 intention to\nacquire Anywhere Real Estate\nsent shockwaves through the industry this week, and it solidified Compass as the Goliath of Chicago\u2019s real estate market.\nThe $1.6 billion all-stock merger will combine two national real estate powerhouses and bring Anywhere\u2019s brands \u2014 including Coldwell Banker, Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, Century 21 and Corcoran Group \u2014 under Compass\u2019 ownership.\nThe deal represents a significant boost in market share for Compass and affiliated brands, which will be especially pronounced in Chicago, since Compass grabbed a huge share of the market with its purchase of\n@properties and Christie\u2019s International Real Estate\nlast year.\nBrands that would be affiliated with Compass after the merger accounted for nearly $18 billion in sales in Chicago last year, according to\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nranking of\nChicago\u2019s top brokerages\n. The rest of the top 20 brokerages amounted to $11.33 billion in sales.\nMany brokerages under Anywhere\u2019s brands are franchise-based, though, so Compass won\u2019t be directly owning those brokerages. Franchised brokerages are owned independently and pay fees for access to technology, marketing and other support.\nOne example is Chicago\u2019s Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. The luxury-focused franchise made $1.53 billion in sales last year across 1,977 transactions, according to the\nTRD\nranking. Linda Levin, a Jameson Sotheby\u2019s broker, said she expects business as usual once her brokerage comes under the Compass umbrella.\n\u201cOur brand holds its own,\u201d Levin said. \u201cFrom what I understand, our world at Jameson Sotheby\u2019s is going to stay primarily the same.\u201d\nMark Ahmad, a broker with Century 21 Circle, a Century 21 franchise, said he doesn\u2019t expect anything to change in his day-to-day once his franchise comes under Compass. He said his brokerage has changed hands before \u2014 first it was under Coldwell Banker, then Century 21 \u2014 and he has learned not to worry because he hasn\u2019t seen it affect his business.\nBut locally based brokerages see a chance to distinguish themselves in a more consolidated industry.\nSteve Baird, CEO and president of Baird &amp; Warner, said the merger strengthens his firm\u2019s position as a local, independent brokerage in an increasingly national and centralized industry. Baird &amp; Warner \u2014 which has been family owned since its inception in the 1850s \u2014\nbought Dream Town earlier this year\n. The firms made a combined $3.53 billion in Cook County sales last year and $6.7 billion in sales overall.\n\nBaird also said he expects some agents will leave the firms Compass picked up, and Baird &amp; Warner will be an attractive option for them.\n\u201cI think it only helps us. It\u2019s only a positive thing,\u201d Baird said. \u201cBecause it creates disruption in the marketplace. It also shows the people that work at that company that the main interest is in profit, and not in what\u2019s good for the agents or good for customers.\u201d\nBaird called the move a \u201cWall Street play\u201d and said it follows Compass\u2019 path of chasing growth through acquisitions, but he questioned whether it would help Compass turn profits.\n\u201cThey keep buying other companies. Great for them, but I don\u2019t quite know how that works. I run a company where it\u2019s important to make money and be successful.\u201d Baird said. \u201cThey\u2019re playing more to the investors than they are about the future potential of all this.\u201d\nReffkin said in the Monday call the merger will allow the company to cut costs by streamlining operations between the two companies, and that income streams from Anywhere\u2019s title, escrow and relocation businesses will help diversify cash flow.\nMatt Laricy, managing broker at Americorp, was shocked by the news and equated it to Pepsi buying Coca-Cola or McDonald\u2019s buying Burger King. In the long term, he said, Compass\u2019 growth could crucially alter the industry \u2014 including how listings are distributed to other brokerages and consumers, which has become increasingly controversial as Compass has taken aim at rules upheld by multiple listing services and the National Association of Realtors limiting some of the brokerage\u2019s preferred marketing techniques.\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t want an MLS, they don\u2019t have to have an MLS,\u201d Laricy said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t want NAR, they don\u2019t have to have NAR. If they want to keep all listings private, they can keep all listings private. Who\u2019s going to stop them?\u201d\nCompass has fought with the National Association of Realtors, multiple listing services and Zillow\nover public listing mandates like Clear Cooperation Policy\nand has pushed a marketing strategy that features some houses starting as exclusive listings marketed only to Compass agents.\u00a0 Reffkin has argued that listing service rules limit choices for sellers and agents and use agents\u2019 products without compensation.\nWhen asked for comment on the merger, a spokesperson for NAR said the trade organization \u201cdoes not comment on the business models of industry participants.\u201d\nLaricy said he sees potential as an independent broker to find success among the bigger players in the industry. Agents who don\u2019t want to be connected to a big corporation will be more motivated to look to a small firm to work with, he said.\n\u201cYou can be a lot more nimble. You can be a lot more creative,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can be a lot more innovative, because you don\u2019t have to go through all those steps. For independents, that\u2019s where you can take advantage of it.\u201d",

The reports of jilted customers prompted letters to the bankruptcy judge, requesting an emergency hearing due to potential consumer harm.\nCloudbeds, an online booking platform, wrote to the bankruptcy judge that it had reason to believe at least one of LuxUrban\u2019s four hotels closed, but LuxUrban had not updated the status of the property with the platform.\nAn attorney for the Department of Justice also wrote a letter to the bankruptcy judge, expressing concerns regarding wages and consumer protections. Workers reportedly walked off the job where they weren\u2019t receiving pay.\nThe trustee letter came the same day the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council alleged LuxUrban owed weeks of wages to unionized workers and managers. The union also alleged the company was illegally withholding at least $57 million in retirement contributions.\nThe New York Fire Department ordered LuxUrban to vacate one of its properties, but despite a safety complaint, it hasn\u2019t enforced any orders and has not uncovered any violations.\nThe bankruptcy judge scheduled a virtual conference to respond to the various claims.\n\nLeo Jacobs, who is the lead restructuring counsel for LuxUrban, declined to comment to Bisnow.\nLuxUrban filed for bankruptcy protection less than two weeks ago, citing more than $15 million in secured debts and $22 million in unsecured claims. The company claimed less than $10 million in assets.\nLuxUrban\u2019s issues, especially in New York City, are well-known. At the 166-key property known as The Herald, LuxUrban allegedly\nracked up at least $1.6 million in arrears\nthrough December, leading a judge to approve the landlord\u2019s eviction request this summer as ownership tries to fend off foreclosure.\nOther\nissues\nrange from\na $1.2 million city fine\nover illegal Airbnb rentals to a Nasdaq delisting. The company\u2019s been accused of overstating its hotel holdings and is facing a shareholder class action lawsuit.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A suburb south of Chicago is putting pressure on single-family landlords with vacant properties to sell by extending a moratorium on home rentals.\nMarkham added a year to its single-family rental ban by unanimous vote from the city council last week, CBS News\nreported\n.\nA test run of the moratorium launched in December and was set to end this month. The extension bans new single-family leases in the city limits. Landlords renting homes prior to the moratorium can still renew tenant leases.\nMayor Roger Agpawa wants\nsingle-family home\nrental rates to drop from 19 percent of all homes in Markham down to 10 percent. The hope is that owners will renovate and place the homes on the market.\nCity leaders view the initiative as a way to improve the \u201ctransient\u201d portion of the housing market, reducing high turnover and vacancy.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of long-term renters here,\u201d Agpawa said. \u201cWell, stay here, and this will never affect you.\u201d\n\nIllinois Realtors lobbied to stop the moratorium extension, arguing the policy infringes on property rights and prevents south suburban Chicago residents from accessing affordable housing.\n\u201cMany people can\u2019t get a\nmortgage\n, but they\u2019re still able to pay\nrent\n, so this is preventing people from accessing housing they can afford in communities they want to live in,\u201d said Nora Gruenberg, government affairs director for Illinois Realtors.\nThe home ownership rate in Markham is higher than all of Cook County and Illinois, at about 72 percent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, whose five-year estimate clocks the town\u2019s population at 11,434 and\nmore than 70 percent\nBlack.\nAgpawa and other city officials argued the number of rentals increasing in the area puts a squeeze on fire, police and other city services. For now, residents and city officials will find out if the rental freeze brings in new homeowners or creates more vacant homes.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The fallout of Bernie Madoff\u2019s infamous Ponzi scheme is still wreaking havoc on lives as the estate\u2019s trustee takes aim at a swanky Greenwich Village condo owned by a New York power couple.\nIrving Picard, the lawyer who\u2019s already clawed back nearly $15 billion for Madoff\u2019s defrauded investors, is pressing attorney Malcolm Sage and his wife, cosmetics executive Lynne Florio, to surrender two of the three units they combined decades ago at 45 Christopher Street, the New York Post\nreported\n.\nA court found in 2022 that Sage was among the rare \u201cnet winners\u201d from Madoff\u2019s $65 billion fraud, pocketing $16.9 million more than he invested.\nPicard argues that since the apartments were never legally merged, he can seize the 1,210- and 902-square-foot units, which he values at a combined $4.6 million. That would leave Sage and Florio in a 930-square-foot one-bedroom unit, a far cry from the 3,000-square-foot spread they\u2019ve enjoyed for decades in one of the Village\u2019s most coveted Art Deco buildings.\n\nThe couple, who once moved in New York\u2019s social circuit and were fixtures at galas, are now fighting the case without legal counsel. They insist the units can\u2019t be physically divided and accuse Picard of misleading the judge, calling the clawback \u201ca fraud on the court.\u201d Picard\u2019s team countered that New Yorkers combine and separate apartments all the time and that Sage\u2019s holdings are the only viable way to enforce the judgment.\nThe push underscores how far Picard is still going, 17 years after Madoff\u2019s fund imploded, to recover money for thousands of victims, including celebrities, sports stars and major institutions. Sage\u2019s siblings have already quietly settled similar clawback claims. Sage and Florio are not accused of criminal wrongdoing or possessing knowledge of Madoff\u2019s Ponzi scheme.\nIt\u2019s another reminder that Manhattan luxury property is still feeling the effects of the Madoff fallout.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The city-owned parking lots are on Oak Grove Avenue between University Drive and El Camino Real.\nThe plan would convert three parking lots in downtown\nMenlo Park\ninto\naffordable housing\nbuildings. Interested developers must submit development proposals that would help the city create at least 345 residential units for extremely low to low-income households, which in San Mateo County is between $40,600 and $108,300 annually for a single person.\nSo far, Menlo Park officials have approved Alliant Communities, MidPen Housing, Presidio Bay Ventures and a joint venture between Related Companies and Alta Housing to each submit one proposal. Other developers can throw their hats into the ring.\nThe idea of developing apartments above parking garages drew backlash from local business owners, who opposed replacing surface parking lots their customers use.\n\nPro-business group Save Downtown Menlo\nopposed the plan\n, collecting signatures and raising legal fees to block the parking lot redevelopment. More than 115 businesses signed an online plea to the city to prevent the endeavor from proceeding.\nThe redevelopment plan was the last straw for one business owner, Save Downtown Menlo organizer Kevin Cunningham\ntold\nthe Mercury News.\n\u201cHe said he didn\u2019t even want to see how this plays out and is just so frustrated with doing business downtown that the decision to pursue these lots was the tipping point,\u201d Cunningham said.\nMenlo Park isn\u2019t the only city in the Bay Area to consider erecting housing-over-parking developments; Palo Alto and\nLos Altos\nare exploring similar options to turn parking into housing, according to the Business Journal.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

Tai Architecture created the approved design.\nThe eight-story project, at 1907-1933 Wilshire Boulevard, will have 26\naffordable housing\nunits, about 21,500 square feet of ground-floor retail, and four levels of subterranean parking.

The proposal also features more open courtyards and increased natural light access throughout the building.\nThere\u2019s still more work for the developer, however, as the approval came with numerous conditions that must be addressed before construction can begin. The developer is required to find an alternative support system for a large architectural frame, increase the number of sun-shade fins on the building\u2019s exterior, and plan to plant bigger trees in the second-floor courtyard than was proposed, as well as tweak some balcony proportions and how metal panels will wrap around corners of the building.\nThe project must still go through final plan review and building permit approval before shovels can hit dirt.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Depper ran Dutch Girl Cleaners at 2094 Mount Diablo Boulevard for more than two decades before retiring and selling the business while remaining its landlord.\nThe development comes on the back of the city\u2019s West Downtown Specific Plan, which rezoned the site in 2018 from commercial to mixed-use residential and commercial use, according to the Business Times. Depper applied to build on the site using SB 330 to secure streamlined approvals and a 50 percent density bonus, committing to eight very-low-income units. In Contra Costa County, very-low-income for one person is\ndefined\nas making less than $55,950 annually.\nWalnut Creek\n\u2019s\nHousing Element\ncalled out the location as a potential site for development as the city works to meet its state-mandated\nhousing construction\ngoals, according to the Business Times. Under the Housing Element, the city must prepare to build 5,805 new units of housing \u2014 including 3,501 affordable homes \u2014 by 2031.\n\n\u201cI have four daughters, I know how important it is to young people that they have day cares they rely on,\u201d Depper told the Business Times of his\namenity\nplans for the mixed-use site. \u201cI think it\u2019s something we should do if we\u2019re building for residential.\u201d\nEarlier this year, Depper filed a complaint against the owners of the Speedway Express gas station next door, claiming that emissions from the fuel site could threaten any development at the Dutch Girl site. The regional board declared the location safe to build on, though Depper believes the construction process will\nreveal toxic soil\nthat would be a costly and time-consuming headache to clean up, according to the Business Times.\nThe local\nfire department\nis reviewing the project plans after residents raised concerns about fire access on the sliver of commercial property.

        "content": "A CMBS loan tied to apartments in Austin was transferred to special servicing in fallout from Texas\u2019 House Bill 21.\nThe $60 million loan backed by Langdon at Walnut Park was flagged after borrower Langdon Street Capital didn\u2019t make the required principal paydown. The Beverly Hills, California-based firm previously agreed to pay down the loan to a debt service coverage ratio of 1.28 if the affordable housing property tax exemption wasn\u2019t granted by Aug. 29, but did not make the payment after failing to get the exemption. The firm lost its exemption after the passage of HB 21, which took aim at a loophole in an affordable housing law, which Langdon used to acquire the property.\nThe property was valued at $90.1 million, assuming the exemption. Without the exemption, the property is valued at $67.1 million.\nLangdon Street Capital used what\u2019s known as the \u201ctraveling\u201d housing finance corporation loophole to get tax credits on the property. The loophole allows multifamily operators to get property tax exemptions by partnering with far-flung affordable housing organizations, thus removing properties in major Texas metros off the tax rolls without the approval of local municipalities.\nThe firm, which was founded by Adam Daneshgar, purchased the property at 12101 N. Lamar Boulevard in 2021, did a sale-leaseback of the property with Pleasanton Housing Finance Corporation, an affordable housing organization more than 100 miles from Austin. The property reserves some units for people whose household income is less than $78,640.\nDaneshgar didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nHouse Bill 21, which was authored by Houston multifamily operator Rep. Gary Gates,\ntook aim at these deals\nby requiring that apartment owners partner with organizations in the same jurisdiction. It also created additional affordability requirements.\nBut the law also gives prior deals, including those that used the loophole, until 2027 to come into compliance with new requirements. In this case and others, appraisal districts appear to be exercising their own interpretation and denying property tax exemptions for these deals now.\n\nGates said some appraisal districts filed temporary restraining orders against the organizations often used in traveling HFC deals, including Pleasanton, but Travis Central Appraisal District didn\u2019t take that route.\nWhen asked if the district was denying exemptions for deals that used the loophole, chief strategy officer Cynthia Martinez only said property owners \u201cmust submit an application and meet the requirements outlined by Chapter 394 of the Local Government Code\u201d to receive the exemption.\nThat\u2019s the crux of a\nlawsuit challenging HB 21\n, filed by the Texas Workforce Housing Commission and the ground lease tenant of Willowbend Apartments in San Antonio. The apartment complex is a traveling housing finance corporation deal where Los Angeles-based Post Investment Group partnered with a housing finance corporation in Brownsville.\nThe lawsuit claims the passage of HB 21 has emboldened appraisal districts to go after the properties that used this loophole by denying their exemptions before the new law goes into effect in 2027, putting 2025 and 2026 exemptions \u201cin jeopardy.\u201d Specifically, the Bexar Appraisal District required Post Investment Group to submit a renewal request to maintain its exemption and has, so far, failed to make a determination.\n\u201cI could see where an appraisal district would take the position: we think your deal is a scam, and we\u2019re not going to give a tax exemption until you have a court determine that it\u2019s a valid HFC,\u201d Gates said.\n\u201cI think they have every right to deny it.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Believing she couldn\u2019t afford Manhattan, Ayana Green was house hunting in Queens when she saw a StreetEasy listing for an East Harlem co-op. At $450,000, it was one-third of Manhattan\u2019s median home price.\nBetter yet, it was a two-bedroom with maintenance charges of only $585 a month. She saw the apartment and made an offer.\nOne thing seemed odd, though. The seller\u2019s broker urged her to use Midtown-based mortgage provider GuardHill Financial.\n\u201cI was told during the showing that they had a heavy preference for GuardHill,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t go through GuardHill, there was another process and it would take a lot longer, and you would forfeit a portion of the down payment if the loan didn\u2019t come through.\u201d\nGreen went with GuardHill.\nShe closed on the apartment last year, at 123-25 East 102nd Street, but the experience gave her pause. Green and other new shareholders grew suspicious when the co-op board was unable to immediately provide documents they requested to file tax returns and were rebuffed upon asking when the annual shareholder meeting would be.\nThe building\u2019s issues, it turned out, ran a lot deeper.\nBuyers at the affordable co-op, classified as a Housing Development Fund Corporation, cannot have high incomes and shareholders\u2019 units must be their primary residence, according to city rules.\nYet some shareholders of the 95-year-old East Harlem building owned multiple units or had never lived there. One owned seven of the 31 apartments at the same time \u2014\u00a0and didn\u2019t reside in any. Another owned four.\nOther shareholders seem to have exploited the HDFC co-op for financial gain, and in recent years, $800,000 had been drained from the co-op\u2019s account, bank records show.\nGreen and other skeptical shareholders requested help from a nonprofit for homeowners, which found red flags about how the co-op operated and referred them to a lawyer.\nWhen the co-op\u2019s leadership kept control of the board in a contested election last December, 13 dissident shareholders sued. Their attorney soon unearthed a convoluted history of insider deals that ran afoul of the building\u2019s rules and its legally mandated mission to provide affordable homeownership.\nGood intentions\nThe story of 123-25 East 102nd Street is, in part, about how lack of oversight and increasing property values in New York City can turn even highly regulated housing into a cash cow.\nHDFCs are co-ops\nlegally designated\nto house low-income people. During New York\u2019s dark years, the city created more than a thousand of them from tax-delinquent rental buildings whose owners had walked away.\nThey tended to be in areas that were struggling, and their apartments were nearly worthless. Today, though, they are in demand. However, because of affordability rules, shareholders of HDFC co-ops cannot simply rent or sell units to the highest bidder.\n\u201cNobody ever thought that somebody would offer them $500,000 for their apartments,\u201d said Oscar McDonald of the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board, which monitors and assists HDFCs. \u201cThese neighborhoods have changed. It tests people\u2019s honesty and integrity.\u201d\nAfter seizing 123-25 East 102nd Street for unpaid property taxes, the city converted the 1930-built rental to a co-op and sold it to the tenants in 2001 for $250 per unit.\nLately, the apartments have fetched up to $499,000, although sale prices are limited by the fact that buyers cannot earn more than 165 percent of the area median income.\nThis form of housing and ownership is specifically designed for owner occupancy.\nScott Kinder, absentee owner, in 2017\nIf their incomes increase after buying, they can stay, but the unit must remain their primary residence \u2014 occupied by the shareholder at least 183 days a year, or 275 days in newer HDFCs. Sublet rents are capped at 110 percent of the maintenance fee.\nThe restrictions aim to prevent units from being treated as investment properties. For that reason, HDFCs present a rare opportunity for working-class New Yorkers to buy a quality, affordable home. It\u2019s a goal that elected officials have increasingly endorsed as the city\u2019s housing crisis has worsened.\nThe vast majority of the city\u2019s approximately 1,300 HDFCs are well run and follow the rules, McDonald said. However, HDFCs lacking regulatory agreements with the city, such as 123-25 East 102nd Street, have no regular oversight. They are essentially self-policing.\nIt is a responsibility that the East Harlem co-op board, by routinely granting exceptions, appeared to purposefully ignore.\n\u201cLiberal subletting\u201d\nThe broker who sold Green her unit, Scott Kinder, had warned the co-op about its rule-bending when the board asked him in 2017 to handle sales. Kinder even foresaw the shareholder revolt now underway.\n\u201cThis form of housing and ownership is specifically designed for owner occupancy,\u201d he emailed the board president and her husband at the time.\n\u201cIn the current market, new shareholders can be expected to demonstrate more control and concern,\u201d he predicted. \u201cLikewise, to satisfy some of those concerns, the coop is going to have to tighten up and/or eliminate its current liberal subletting policy.\u201d\nThe city\u2019s\nHDFC website\nis clear: \u201cIn general, short-term subletting with Board of Directors\u2019 permission is acceptable where the shareholder intends to return to the apartment, but long-term sublets are not permissible.\u201d\nNew shareholders at East 102nd Street were informed of this, yet long-term subletting continued for the insiders, as did apartment hoarding and other curious \u2014 and lucrative \u2014 arrangements. The mutual backscratching may have been so rampant that for years no shareholders raised a fuss, as they were also benefiting from the permissive policies.\nKinder himself was purportedly an absentee owner when he wrote that 2017 message and remains one today. His five-year contract as exclusive sales broker includes a $100,000 termination clause, and his pay to manage the property was recently doubled to $3,000 a month by a five-member board that included his daughter and her mother.\nThe board president has a combined unit, yet her husband owned a two-bedroom. One board member, Maxcine Holder, had four units simultaneously. Another, Nettie Elenion, had seven, and never lived in any of them.\nWeb of relationships\nAlthough the building\u2019s insiders swapped and sold apartments like baseball cards, city property records show not a single transaction between the co-op\u2019s inception in 2001 and 2019, when Marcus Cintron, the board president\u2019s son, sold a unit for $245,000.\nKeeping track of the characters and schemes at the six-story co-op requires a whiteboard, like the ones detectives use to chart connections among suspects.\nHolder, who sold 2A to Green last year, was one of the hubs. She owns Unit 3D and rents it to Charles Richardson, whose mother,\nJune Richardson\n, was the loan officer Green was steered to by Kinder.\nHolder and Kinder have two children together. Their daughter Courtney Kinder also owns a unit in the co-op, though she, like her parents and Elenion, lives in a condo at\n309 East 108th Street\n.\nMichael Zampella, whom Kinder has known for at least 15 years, picked up a unit in 2014 but has never lived in it \u2014 though he was on the board from 2022 to 2024. He owns LLCs that do business with the co-op and its shareholders.\nHolder formed\nMaxnettie LLC\n, combining her first name and Elenion\u2019s, and registered it at their East 108th Street condo. Elenion has an LLC too, named Elendil Mar, which is also the name of the\nVermont Airbnb\nshe owns. (A repeat guest named \u201cNettie\u201d posted three positive reviews.)\nThe personal and business connections may explain how the various players became shareholders in the HDFC and used it to bolster their financial and property portfolios.\nZampella, who lives in Alexandria, Virginia, and works at the Pentagon, did not disclose his businesses in an affidavit filed in response to the lawsuit. Rather, he said he was a Navy reservist when he acquired his unit in 2014 and intended to move in upon being discharged, but never was.\n\u201cWith the [co-op] board\u2019s permission, the resident living in the apartment at that time was permitted to stay and pay monthly rent and maintenance fees to the HDFC,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cI have not realized any income from apartment 6C since my purchase 11 years ago.\u201d\nZampella failed to mention his income from other units. His MZ Capital Funding LLC received $359,517 from the sale of Unit 2D and $285,000 when Holder sold 2A.\nApartments collected and traded\nUnit 2A exemplifies the HDFC\u2019s secretive wheeling and dealing. The apartment was passed around like a blunt at a frat party before being sold to the outsider Green.\nIts confusing journey began in 2007 when Ramon Ruiz, also known as Ray Cintron, somehow acquired it from original owner Matilda Reyes. In 2020, the board, led by Ruiz\u2019s wife, Victoria Guzman, exempted Ruiz\u2019s future sale of the unit from the building\u2019s 20 percent flip tax on profits.\nBy 2023, Unit 2A had mysteriously migrated to Elenion\u2019s collection. She sold it that year for $450,000 to her condo neighbor Holder, whose daughter Courtney Kinder paid the $44,900 deposit. Courtney made out her check to \u201cNettie Elenion care of Elendil Mar LLC\u201d (the Vermont Airbnb entity) and wrote \u201cgift to Maxcine Holder\u201d in the memo section.\nA year later, Holder sold Unit 2A for the same price she had paid Elenion. The flip yielded zero profit for Holder, but records show it got her a $314,000 mortgage from GuardHill.\nKinder (who, remember, has two children with Holder) pocketed an $18,000 commission from the sale, and Holder took home $120,000. They are not presently in a relationship but remain close, Holder said in an affidavit.\nShe did not explain why Zampella received $285,000. No loan appears in city records. The 2023 sale is also missing.\nIn all, at least seven HDFC insiders touched Unit 2A: Ruiz, the president\u2019s husband; Elenion, the seven-unit and Airbnb owner; Holder; her ex Scott Kinder; their daughter Courtney; Navy reservist Zampella; and the loan broker Richardson.\n\nSystematic withdrawals\nGuzman, the board president who gave her blessing to the co-op\u2019s practices, benefited in a different way. She paid herself and her husband $100,000 over the past few years from the co-op\u2019s account, which saw its balance fall from more than $1.1 million to less than $400,000.\nGuzman received at least $70,918, and Ruiz got $29,710. Florida resident Vanessa Ramirez, the mother of their grandchildren, received $14,443, apparently to serve as an officer of the co-op.\nRamirez lives with Marcus Cintron and their kids in a home owned by Guzman and Ruiz, Marcus\u2019 parents, in Kissimmee, a thousand miles south of East Harlem.\nFormer board member Emma Rodriguez, who until recently owned Unit 2D, also worked for the co-op from her home in Florida, receiving checks totaling at least $21,200. She and Guzman co-signed the checks to themselves and others.\nAsked what duties were performed to justify the payments, plaintiff Ayana Green said, \u201cI would love to know. We have no idea.\u201d\nThe board exempted Rodriguez and Guzman\u2019s apartments, like that of Guzman\u2019s husband, from the flip tax as they got ready to cash out. Nettie Elenion\u2019s five remaining units were also exempted, as was Jaime De La Vega\u2019s Unit 2C.\nHolder was not included in the flip tax exemption, yet she was allowed to sell two units without giving the co-op a cut.\n\u201cA flip tax is very important for the ongoing successful operation of an HDFC co-op,\u201d the city\u2019s housing agency says on its website. \u201cThe HDFC co-op re-invests the flip taxes it collects into capital repairs and other building needs.\u201d\nRecords missing\nBecause of the unexplained void in ACRIS, the city\u2019s property transaction database, it is unclear how Marcus Cintron, his father and several other insiders obtained their units.\nAffidavits\nfiled by the defendants offer some clues.\nElenion said she received \u201cseveral units\u201d \u2014 seven, it appears \u2014 in 2016 as payment for a defaulted loan that she made in 2012 to an unnamed person. She said she immediately gave Scott and Courtney Kinder one unit apiece (5B and 5E).\nElenion said she let the board rent out her remaining five apartments and keep the income. She later sold three and kept two.\nIn her affidavit, Courtney Kinder did not explain why Elenion gave her an apartment worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. \u201cAt the time that she came into possession of several units in the building, a unit was transferred to me,\u201d she said.\nShe seemed resentful that the new shareholders\u2019 lawsuit questions her ownership, as it does of 10 other units.\n\u201cIt seems very late to complain about a transaction that was approved at the time,\u201d Kinder said, \u201cand long before any of the plaintiffs moved into the building.\u201d\nThe new owners don\u2019t see it that way. If past practices inappropriately enriched individuals at the expense of the co-op, current and future shareholders will have to pay higher fees to maintain the aging building.\nThey also want the HDFC to fulfill its mission of providing affordable, owner-occupied housing.\nTo that end, they are demanding 11 units be returned to the co-op to sell, or that the building be paid up to $5.5 million for them.\n\u201cWe want to be able to take the units, transact them out, provide housing for people and keep middle-income New Yorkers in New York \u2014 and refresh the building,\u201d Green said. \u201cWe want a safe, clean building where people can enjoy living.\u201d\nUgly confrontation\nTensions have been high since last fall, when several dissidents sought election to the board but lost when the old guard let absentee shareholders vote by email.\nThings got so heated that in February, Ruiz warned plaintiff Alex Loule during a profanity-laced diatribe that he would be \u201ccarried out of here.\u201d Loule\u2019s young son stood feet away, open-mouthed, as his father recorded the encounter.\nIn his affidavit, Ruiz admitted making the statement but claimed he meant Loule could be arrested for falsely reporting building conditions.\nBut Marcus Cintron, Ruiz\u2019s son, was more explicit.\nAnother video recorded by Loule shows Cintron following him outside the building and yelling, \u201cI am not making a threat. That is a fuckin\u2019 promise, you fuckin\u2019 little piece of shit. You fuck with me, I will fuckin\u2019 kill you, n\u2014\u2013. Straight up. I don\u2019t give a fuck\u2026 You want to go to the basement and fight?\u201d\nCintron explained in an affidavit that he was upset because Loule had harassed him and his father.\nDigging through documents\nThe dispute figures to be settled in a law firm conference room, not in the bowels of the East Harlem building.\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, Gregory Byrnes, has subpoenaed and sorted through thousands of pages of records like a bomb-sniffing dog. They depict, he said, an intricate social network of shareholders, relatives, friends, business partners and lovers who took advantage of the co-op.\nByrnes\u2019 clients have a long list of demands. Three will be fiercely resisted: that a receiver be appointed to run the building; that Elenion, Holder, Zampella and the Kinders give back their 11 \u201cillegally transferred\u201d units or pay the co-op for them; and that the \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars taken by current and former board members, officers and the \u2018property manager\u2019\u201d be repaid.\nThe suit also calls for:\nan audit of the building\u2019s finances, which by rule is supposed to be done annually\nrepeal of the flip tax exemption and other board resolutions passed for \u201cpersonal benefit\u201d\nenforcement of the residency rules\npayment of the defendants\u2019 maintenance arrears, and\ncancelation of Scott Kinder\u2019s management and broker agreements.\nIt is unclear how much shareholders owe in maintenance fees, which are low because the building\u2019s annual property tax is only $53,000. Records obtained by Byrnes show collection from 2020 through 2024 ranged from 44 to 65 percent.\nAccording to Guzman\u2019s affidavit, Courtney Kinder is responsible for collecting rent and maintenance and has done so \u201cwithout issue since 2022.\u201d\nGuzman also defended the decision to hire Kinder, a shareholder.\nWhile the board may have engaged in several technical violations of the bylaws, there has been no showing of actual loss or waste.\nMatthew Mehnert, attorney for the co-op\n\u201cWe were aware that there was potential for a conflict,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the board determined that it was in the HDFC\u2019s best interest to have someone with Mr. Kinder\u2019s knowledge and experience assisting with day-to-day operation of the building.\u201d\nByrnes, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer, had requested the board\u2019s files for all closings in the building but was given only those for his clients\u2019 purchases. In legal filings, the co-op said it would take time to produce the rest and claimed the unit transfers were proper.\nThe co-op\u2019s insurance provider replaced the board\u2019s initial lawyer in the case. The new legal team argues that the plaintiffs have blown minor infractions out of proportion.\nLead attorney Matthew Mehnert wrote to the presiding judge, Paul Goetz, that appointing a receiver would be drastic and unjustified. He wants the whole case dismissed.\n\u201cWhile the board may have engaged in several technical violations of the bylaws, there has been no showing of actual loss or waste,\u201d Mehnert asserted in a court filing. \u201cThere has been no showing of self-dealing or impropriety by the board.\u201d\nThe Real Deal\nemailed questions to Guzman, Ruiz, Kinder and Kinder\u2019s personal attorney, Daniel Laguardia, but received no responses.\nResidency requirements, flip taxes and limits on sublet rents and duration are found in the governing documents of HDFC co-ops, which must also abide by the state\u2019s\nBusiness Corporation Law\nand\nArticle XI\nof the Private Housing Finance Law.\n\u201cThese are highly regulated buildings,\u201d said UHAB\u2019s McDonald. \u201cThey have to be more careful than a market-rate co-op.\u201d\nByrnes has reported his findings to the Manhattan district attorney and state attorney general but does not expect either to bring a case, given their limited resources and large universe of complaints.\nHe is likely correct. By the standards of New York real estate, the co-op at 123-25 East 102nd Street is small potatoes. It involves ordinary New Yorkers and modest sums, not the kind of villains and dollar figures that make headlines.\nBut to HDFC experts like McDonald, ethical management by affordable co-ops matters.\nBeyond abiding by the law, HDFCs have a responsibility to live up to the promise of the program, he said. They were not created for people to hoard units and cut insider deals every time a unit becomes vacant.\n\u201cConflict is not always a legal conflict,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the appearance of impropriety.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Workman Real Estate Ventures bought its fourth Miami-Dade industrial property, buying a Miami facility for $16 million. But the deal was almost derailed by an aggressive foreclosure action by a lender seeking repayment of a $9.2 million mortgage debt, court records show.\nAn affiliate of Miami-based Workman, also known as WREV, led by Tyler Workman, acquired the 72,477-square-foot industrial building at 3400 Northwest 67th Street, records and real estate database Vizzda show. The buyer also obtained a $9.2 million loan from BankUnited.\nThe deal breaks down to $220 a square foot. In August, WREV dropped\n$22.7 million\nfor a three-warehouse portfolio in\nMedley\nfrom real estate investors\nScott Sime\nand Belinda Sime.\nThe seller of the Miami warehouse, an entity managed by Morty Josh Yashar in Brooklyn, paid $11.5 million for the 2.1-acre site in 2023, records show. The building was completed in 1959.\nYashar\u2019s entity financed its 2023 acquisition of the warehouse with a $9.2 million loan from NW 68th Street Holdings, an entity tracing to Basil and Wendy Beck in\nCoral Gables\n.\n\nOn June 23, NW 68th Street Holdings filed a foreclosure complaint in Miami-Dade Circuit Court against Yashar\u2019s entity, alleging it failed to make a monthly interest payment in May. Yashar\u2019s entity filed a counterclaim on Sept. 1, alleging the lender was responsible for the default over an issue with the May payment being made late.\nYashar\u2019s entity acknowledged it wired the May payment after the due date. But the counterclaim alleges that when Yashar\u2019s entity subsequently attempted to wire a $2,119 late fee into the NW 67th St. Holding\u2019s account, it was rejected by the lender\u2019s bank.\nThe counterclaim accuses the lender of \u201cbad faith actions directing its bank to put a restriction on receipt of electronic payments from\u201d Yashar\u2019s entity.\nYashar paid the late fee and June\u2019s payment, roughly $44,000, by going directly to the lender\u2019s bank and depositing a check into the lender\u2019s account, the counterclaim alleges. Yashar\u2019s entity alleges the lender filed the foreclosure complaint despite receiving the funds owed.\nYashar\u2019s entity continued to make interest-only payments in July, August and September, but the lender refused to cooperate in the pending sale to WREV by not providing a mortgage payoff estoppel letter, the counterclaim alleges.\nOn Sept. 18, NW 68th Street Holdings voluntarily dismissed the foreclosure complaint and four days later provided Yashar\u2019s entity with a satisfaction of mortgage document, records show.",

        "content": "A Central Texas town known for pine forests and barbecue is at the center of an ambitious real estate play, along with Elon Musk\u2019s latest tunneling experiment.\nBastrop officials are weighing plans for a 390-acre mixed-use development dubbed Bastrop West that would pack in a regional hospital, hotel and convention center, entertainment venues, retail and multifamily\nspace\n. Meanwhile, Musk\u2019s Boring Company, headquartered just outside city limits, is in talks with the city about digging three pedestrian tunnels to link up Bastrop\u2019s expanding trail system, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nKazem Khonshari\u2019s Palms Properties owns the mixed-use development site, spanning two parcels off Highway 21 between FM 20 and Bear Hunter Drive. Khonshari has previous projects in Bastrop and is assembling partners for components like a hotel operator and convention center developer. A master developer hasn\u2019t been chosen.\nThe project is pitched as a game-changer for the 13,000-person town 30 miles east of Austin. A domed sports facility is being discussed for the recreation parcel, while the entertainment area could attract a big-box user such as TopGolf.\nThe vision includes a 41-acre hotel and convention center site, a 25-acre medical mall anchored by a regional hospital, a 37-acre education hub, a 28-acre sports and recreation complex, 25 acres of entertainment space, nearly 100 acres of commercial parcels and 58 acres of multifamily and retail.\n\nMeanwhile, Boring Company is exploring three tunnel alignments: one from a Buc-ee\u2019s under Highway 95 to Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, another from Mayfest Park to Bastrop State Park, and a possible extension to Ferry Park along the Colorado River. If built, it would be the company\u2019s first Austin-area project.\nThe Bastrop West plan will require annexation, zoning changes and significant infrastructure financing. Developers are expected to seek a public improvement district and tax increment reinvestment zone, while the city may tap Bastrop\u2019s economic development arm and state transportation approvals for funding.\nThe project comes as Boring Company looks for momentum beyond its Las Vegas tunnel, where it has operated since 2021. The company has since\nstruggled to win\ndeals elsewhere, facing fines and stalled\nproposals\n, including in\nKyle\njust south of Austin. But its Bastrop R&amp;D campus \u2014 an 80,000-square-foot facility on 73 acres \u2014 signals Musk\u2019s tunneling outfit isn\u2019t leaving Texas anytime soon.\nElsewhere in Bastrop, a $100 million, 75-acre \u201cnon-woke\u201d film studio dubbed\nWyldwood Studios\nis in the works by actor Zachary Levi.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s not quite Park Avenue, but the Seaport\u2019s Park Row has carved out its spot as the go-to lane for big deals on the southern tip of Manhattan.\nThe latest is a contract for one of the penthouse units at 33 Park Row asking $19.5 million.\n\u201cPenthouse Three\u201d went into contract Wednesday morning for \u201cvery close to the asking price,\u201d said Compass\u2019 Huihui Geng, who brought the buyer. The deal is expected to close later this year.\nA Compass New Development Marketing team led by Leonard Steinberg and Herve Senequier has led sales since the building launched in 2020. Closings began in 2022, and only four of the building\u2019s 30 units remain unsold, according to Marketproof.\nThe unit\u2019s asking price places it neck-and-neck with the Financial District\u2019s top sale, which happened next door at 25 Park Row where a penthouse unit closed for $19.5 million in 2021.\nThat unit briefly hit the market last year asking $22 million, but was taken off this past June.\nIt\u2019s been an up-and-down several years for Fidi, which has contended with\nsignificant amounts of inventory\ncoming to the market and\ndampening values\n. But as the city navigates condo shortages in desirable neighborhoods like Tribeca and the West Village, FiDi has shown signs of life.\n\nIn August, a unit at Harry Macklowe\u2019s One Wall Street\nclosed for over $9 million\n, marking the highest condo sale in the neighborhood since October 2022.\nIn February, a penthouse at 130 William Street sold for $7.7 million, or just over $3,000 per square foot, according to public records. That unit originally sold for $7.36 million in 2021 before hitting the market again for almost $9 million in 2023.\nGeng said his client was interested in looking downtown, and found the Seaport neighborhood to be an affordable alternative to Tribeca.\nOriginally developed by Urban Muse\u2019s Glauco Lolli-Ghetti, it is the first residential property in New York City designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners\u2019 Richard Rogers. Centurion Real Estate Partners later joined the project.\nThe 5,400-square-foot unit has five bedrooms, five bathrooms and views of City Hall Park.\nThe unit, which contains twin private elevator landings, was initially conceived of as two separate duplexes on the 19th and 20th floors before being combined into one, according to documents filed with the state attorney\u2019s general office in 2021.\nThe first floor contains a spacious open-plan kitchen and great room, which feature 21-foot ceilings, floor-to-ceiling glass windows facing the park and 108-square-foot juliet balconies.\n",

But on Tuesday, the ownership entity, managed by project developer\nBrian Tuttle\n, filed a Chapter 11 petition in Miami federal bankruptcy court that temporarily halted the auction.\nThe bankruptcy filing was a direct response to mounting pressure from Mainstreet at Tuttle\u2019s largest creditor, an affiliate of\nThe Fuse Group\n, a Fort Lauderdale-based firm led by Eyal Peretz, that won a $47.4 million foreclosure judgment against the ownership entity in July, Tuttle told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nIn its lawsuit filed last year, The Fuse Group affiliate alleged Mainstreet at Tuttle defaulted on three loans totaling\n$38.4 million\n. The judgment includes interest and fees, Palm Beach County Circuit Court records show.\nThe Fuse Group backed out of an agreement with a new lender that would have resolved the debt, Tuttle said.\n\u201cWe are incredibly disappointed over the bank\u2019s actions,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get in front of it. The bank told us what they wanted \u2014 we delivered what they wanted, and then they refused to accept it.\u201d\n\nThrough its attorney, The Fuse Group affiliate declined comment.\nTuttle has not broken ground on Mainstreet at Tuttle, a planned mixed-use project with 400,000 square feet of retail, 401 apartments, a 125-key hotel, nearly 83,000 square feet of medical offices and three parking garages with 3,435 total spaces.\nMainstreet at Tuttle had lined up Atlanta-based The Ardent Companies to take over as lender, a press release states. On Sept. 16, Ardent agreed to The Fuse Group\u2019s terms that entailed $48 million to buy the loans, a $3 million non-refundable deposit, an additional 25 days of interest charges and a closing within 25 days, Mainstreet at Tuttle\u2019s ownership entity alleged.\nDespite receiving a confirmed offer from The Ardent Companies, The Fuse Group allegedly refused to honor the agreement and \u201cdeclined to accept the full cash payment\u201d on Sept. 19, the release states. As a result, according to the release, Mainstreet at Tuttle had no viable option other than filing for bankruptcy protection.\nOther projects with Tuttle Royale remain on track. Tuttle and San Antonio-based Lynd recently completed\nThe Villas at Tuttle Royale,\na 400-unit apartment complex at 11200 Nicole Drive. Tuttle has sold other portions of the master-planned community to other developers, including Coconut Grove-based Related Group, which completed a 392-unit apartment complex at 10900 and 11020 Town Circle in 2019. Two years later, Related sold it to New York-based Pantzer Properties for\n$119.4 million\n.\nRecently, FCI Residential, a subsidiary of the Fanjul family\u2019s sugar empire, started construction of a\n320-unit\napartment complex consisting of 11 three-story buildings and two two-story townhouse buildings at Tuttle Royale.",

        "content": "The Chicago Housing Authority picked another developer to take on one of the city\u2019s most storied pieces of real estate, replacing a team that collapsed under financing woes.\nEvergreen Real Estate Group and KLEO Enterprises, working as Cabrini New Vision, will lead redevelopment of a 7-acre site at Clybourn Avenue and Larrabee Street, near the footprint of the demolished Cabrini-Green towers, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n. The housing authority approved the plan last week, several months after Hunt Development Group and its partners\nabandoned\nthe deal when they couldn\u2019t secure funding, according to the CHA.\nThe property, at 1450 North Larrabee Street, is a wedge-shaped parcel once home to Near North High School, which closed in 2001 and was demolished last year. The last Cabrini-Green high-rise came down in 2011, clearing the way for a redevelopment process that has sputtered for more than a decade.\nThe location is slated for mixed-income housing, with at least 180 CHA-subsidized units under a long-term lease. The previous team\nproposed\n750 units, then pivoted to a 480-unit mid-rise plan, but failed to\nsecure financing\n.\nKLEO founder\nTorrey Barrett\nwas previously part of Imagine Development, a partner on Hunt\u2019s failed bid. Imagine has since dissolved, but Barrett said the Cabrini opportunity pushed him to team up again, this time with Evergreen. The duo recently completed the Auburn Gresham Apartments on the South Side, turning city-owned land into affordable housing.\n\nEvergreen, which has built CHA-backed projects across Chicago for more than a decade, is making its first foray into redeveloping a former public housing site. Director of Development David Block said the team intentionally structured a different proposal from Hunt\u2019s, mindful of interest rate volatility and shifting construction costs that have tripped up recent projects.\nThe plan calls for roughly 450 rental apartments spread across four buildings, with 180 units subsidized by the CHA, plus another 75 condos and townhomes. Market-rate housing makes up a larger share than Hunt\u2019s proposal, which Block said is a reflection of Chicago\u2019s resilient rental market compared to overheated boomtowns like Austin.\nFinancing is the central hurdle. Evergreen and KLEO expect to layer low-income housing tax credits, tax-increment financing, grants and other subsidies to make the project feasible. The developers are also eyeing ways to expand the number of for-sale townhomes on site.\nThe project would mark the most significant addition of housing at the Cabrini-Green site since the CHA began demolishing the infamous towers more than 20 years ago.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has had his hands full this offseason: an investigation into tampering claims made against the Los Angeles Clippers and their star forward Kawhi Leonard, multiple star players recovering from devastating injuries heading into the season and, apparently, shopping his Upper West Side apartment.\nAt least he can check the apartment off his list.\nSilver sold his three-bedroom spread at The Beresford, a co-op building at 211 Central Park West, for $8.5 million in an off-market deal, according to public records.\nThe buyer, Louise Riggio, is the widow of Barnes &amp; Noble founder Leonard Riggio, who passed away last year. She told the New York Times in February\nshe was looking to downsize\nboth her Park Avenue apartment and her art collection, which she sold for over $270 million in an auction held by Christie\u2019s earlier this year.\n\nSilver paid $6.8 million for the unit in 2012 before transferring it into a trust in 2017, according to public records. (Evidence of Silver\u2019s purchase may be hard to find because Jared Kushner ordered the\noriginal scoop from the New York Observer\ntaken down while he was running the outlet in 2012.)\nIt\u2019s not clear where Silver is off to next, but the NBA headquarters will be staying put for at least another 10 years \u2014 the organization\nextended its lease at 645 Madison Avenue\n, also known as Olympia Tower, through 2035 back in 2016.\nDesigned by Emery Roth in 1929, the 20-story co-op has\nhoused a number of well-known names\nover the years. Actor Jerry Seinfeld, actress Glenn Close, singer Diana Ross and Fox News host turned Trump family insider Kimberly Guilfoyle have all been buyers in the building.\nIn August, billionaire\nBill Ackman sold unit 8F\nat the building for $9.4 million, down from the $13.5 million he paid for it in 2017. Ackman still has the unit next door, although it\u2019s on the market for $8.25 million.\n",

If a landlord does not give sufficient advanced notice of a rent increase or termination of a tenancy, they must pay relocation costs to the tenants.\nDetails of the ordinance were still being amended shortly before the meeting but were not discussed at length during the meeting.\nThe landlord requirements will apply to a pilot area of the South Shore and are likely to become a sticking point for real estate groups.\nOther provisions in the ordinance increase funding for existing programs like long term homeowner home improvement grants, rental assistance, property tax debt relief and programs aimed at reducing costs of rehabilitating residential properties.\nAmong those are funding set aside to create a Preservation of Existing Affordable Rentals program that will help developers purchase or refinance multifamily properties used for affordable housing, and funding set aside for rehabilitation of vacant homes to buyers under certain income restrictions.\nThe proposal by 5th Ward Alderman Desmon Yancy passed the housing committee unanimously despite prior attempts to pass a similar measure stalling for nearly two years.\nAldermen expressed support for the measure, citing the impending opening of the Obama Presidential Library as a harbinger of change.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t keep our eye on the South Shore, we will lose it,\u201d 4th Ward Alderman Lamont Robinson said. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t keep our eye on Bronzeville, we will lose it.\u201d",

        "content": "Eli Lilly is planting a flag in Houston with a $6.5 billion biomanufacturing complex, the biggest biotech investment in Texas history and one of the largest single corporate projects ever in the region, fueled by a weightloss drug.\nThe global drugmaker will build a 236-acre facility in Generation Park, a master-planned business hub off Beltway 8 near George Bush Intercontinental Airport, the Houston Chronicle\nreported\n. The project will create 4,000 construction jobs and 615 permanent roles, ranging from lab technicians to engineers, with average pay topping $100,000.\nLilly\nacquired the land\nwithin the last month and is already moving dirt. McCord Development, which is steering\nGeneration Park\n, will invest $100 million in infrastructure upgrades, while Lilly will handle the buildings.\nThe state sweetened the deal with $146 million in incentives, plus $5.5 million from the Texas Enterprise Fund. Gov. Greg Abbott compared the project to Tesla\u2019s speedy Gigafactory build in Austin, vowing Texas regulators will cut red tape to fast-track Lilly\u2019s plans. Local rebates and abatements from the Generation Park Management District are also expected.\nThe development cements Houston\u2019s bid to be a national biomanufacturing hub with innovations in the booming weight-loss drug market. Lilly hopes the site will eventually churn out Orforglipron, an experimental oral version of the wildly popular GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy. If approved, the pill could become a blockbuster by offering patients an alternative to injections. Lilly already manufactures the GLP-1 tirzepatide brands Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a hurry here,\u201d CEO David Ricks told the outlet, noting the company wants foundations and steel rising by 2027. \u201cIf the FDA approves, we\u2019ll be on the clock to ramp this up quickly.\u201d\nBeyond obesity drugs, the facility could manufacture small molecule medicines targeting cancer, immunology and neuroscience.\nWhile Houston lacks a deep biotech labor pool, the city has become home to an adjacent life sciences sector, with more than\n700 life science\ncompanies making Houston\nhome\n. Ricks pointed to the Gulf Coast\u2019s chemical workforce as a ready talent base. San Jacinto College is launching a biotech program at Generation Park to train workers for the new jobs. Proximity to chemical suppliers along the coast also helped tip the scales in Houston\u2019s favor.\nThe announcement came amid Lilly\u2019s push to onshore production amid growing demand. Alongside a plant in Virginia, the company expects to announce two more U.S. sites later this year.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "During the six years since New York\u2019s rent law crushed rent-stabilized revenue, the industry opinion\nbecame almost unanimous\n: The legislation would be the death of much of the regulated housing stock.\nBut landlord anecdotes have now given way to court data on increased foreclosure filings and damning reports by watchdog groups and researchers, widening the consensus. Some say the problem is a time bomb: If the state doesn\u2019t step in and alter the law, New York City will have to pick up the pieces of the coming explosion, whether it can afford to or not.\nAnd yet, neither government has acknowledged the threat. Rather, electeds have flat-out denied the distressed narrative. Their doubt, perhaps, stemmed from their distance from the issue. Neither had been forced to shoulder\nthe losses that landlords have\n.\nUntil now.\nAn analysis of city records by\nThe Real Deal\nfound that two city-managed pension funds that are invested in majority rent-stabilized housing \u2014 the subset most affected by the rent law\u2019s revenue constraints \u2014 have cratered, losing more than two-thirds of their value since 2019. (A\ntweet\nin August tipped reporters off to the loss, and a\nBisnow article\nearlier this month explained how the investment happened.)\nInvestments made in partnership with Related and Hudson, once worth $531 million, are now valued at $165 million, a 69 percent decrease.\nPart of that drop emerged after buildings sold, many of them at a loss. But the values of properties still held by the funds have eroded, too.\nOwner groups say the numbers are irrefutable evidence that the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, which effectively capped revenue at rent-stabilized buildings, has driven outsized vacancies that are sending values into the ground \u2014\u00a0and also that politicians can no longer deny this.\n\u201cNew York City\u2019s own pension fund proves the damage of the 2019 rent laws,\u201d Kenny Burgos, CEO of the New York Apartment Association, said. The NYAA represents owners of rent-stabilized housing.\nThe question is whether Albany or New York City, the latter now a victim of the law itself, will see the data for what it is before very bad turns to worse.\nA good idea (at the time)\nThe rent-stabilized investments came out of Hurricane Sandy.\nIn 2013, then-Comptroller John Liu allocated $300 million and $200 million to affordable housing developers Related and Hudson, respectively, to finance housing repair and construction in the wake of Sandy\u2019s $19 billion economic blow.\nThe money was an equity stake to secure an additional $1 billion in loans for Sandy-related construction or repair of about 3,000 affordable units \u2014\u00a0some rent-stabilized, some market rate. At the time, Crain\u2019s New York Business reported that the city estimated that the funds would provide returns between 9 and 14 percent.\nFor a time, they more or less hit those marks.\nThe Related investment boasted an annualized net internal rate of return of 14.3 percent, pension performance reports from 2019 show. The Hudson investment in the same period posted an IRR of 8.6 percent.\nBut after the 2019 rent law passed, performance plummeted.\nThe investments\u2019 multiples \u2014\u00a0another way to gauge value \u2014 slipped. In the quarter after the legislation went live, Related\u2019s multiple dropped 30 percent to 1.14 from 1.63, and Hudson\u2019s fell by about 9 percent to 1.16 from 1.27.\nFast forward to 2025: Related\u2019s multiple now stands at 0.49, meaning the investment has lost over half its value; Hudson\u2019s is 1.09.\nThe actual value may be even less than reported.\n\u201cYou have to assume that they\u2019re always overestimating,\u201d John Murphy, who ran the city employees\u2019 retirement system from 1990 to 2005, said. The retirement system is New York City\u2019s largest pension fund.\nBecause there\u2019s no open market for this type of real estate investment, the way there is for stocks, it\u2019s impossible to know the value of these buildings until they sell.\nIt\u2019s like trying to determine the value of a used car, Murphy said.\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t have an independent market to refer to, you get people\u2019s guesses and they\u2019re always biased,\u201d he added.\nThe devil\u2019s in the data\nBut a spate of recent sales now puts numbers and a visual to value declines.\nIn May of this year, rent-stabilized investors and frequent partners PH Realty and Rockledge\npurchased a portfolio\nof 34 rent-stabilized buildings in the Bronx from Related Fund Management, and by extension, from the pension funds.\nPH, run by Hungerford, paid $192.5 million for the portfolio, 24 percent less than the $253 million the pension fund paid in 2014 (and that\u2019s before accounting for the $30 million sunk into renovations).\nOf the 2,020 units in the portfolio, 263 of them, or 13 percent, were vacant on closing, many because of their poor condition.\nCollectively, the portfolio carried 3,105 housing code violations, 923 of which were designated immediately hazardous: roach and mouse infestations, lack of hot water, mold and lead paint.\n\u201cThey were making deliberate business choices to leave units vacant instead of renting them,\u201d Hungerford said. \u201cThat to me is just like, \u2018Wow.\u2019\u201d\nTo be fair, the rent law likely wasn\u2019t the only factor that drove the Related buildings into disrepair.\u00a0 Stubborn inflation, soaring insurance premiums, rising property taxes and water bills, and high interest rates have all pressured the business model. But the rent law made it impossible for many owners to raise rents enough to cover these increased costs.\nThrough a wider lens, a\nTRD\nanalysis of property records found that 43 Related buildings bought with pension funds between 2014 and 2016 were later sold at a loss between 2023 and 2025.\nThe median haircut was 24 percent. One Bronx building sold at a near-60 percent loss.\nThese 43 properties represent only a portion of the pension fund\u2019s investments; many are held under separate companies that are hard to track, and\nTRD\u2019s\nanalysis excludes buildings sold before 2019, many of which appreciated in value.\nThe Hudson investments are now generating a 1.4 percent return \u2014\u00a0effectively, peanuts \u2014 and the Related fund is operating at an 18.4 percent loss.\nThe difference between the returns underscores the severity of the rent-stabilized crisis.\nBoth investments are in workforce housing, meaning apartments that are priced to be affordable for residents below a certain percentage of the area median income.\nAccording to a former official familiar with the investments, the Hudson investment was focused more on buildings directly in the Sandy flood zone. These buildings have a higher mix of market-rate units.\n\nThe Related portfolio was invested in a higher percentage of pure-play rent-stabilized buildings, and thus was more exposed to the asset class\u2019s downturn.\nScreaming into the void\nThe pension fund losses aren\u2019t news to the industry. Rather, they support the vacancy data, sales numbers and on-the-ground anecdotes that landlords for years have begged the city to recognize as facts and figures that amount to a five-alarm fire.\nCommunity Preservation Corporation, the nonprofit lender, recently\nreported\neight times as many\nforeclosure\nfilings against the 100 percent rent-stabilized buildings in its portfolio as in 2022. (The more rent-stabilized a building, the more constrained its revenues.)\nNearly 30 percent of CPC\u2019s entirely rent-stabilized portfolio doesn\u2019t rake in sufficient rent to cover debt service.\nNew York University\u2019s Furman Center this spring found the cost of operating older, entirely rent-stabilized properties, particularly those in the Bronx,\nexceeded their rent rolls\nby an average of $1,444 annually in 2024.\nCitizens Budget Commission, a watchdog, warned of an imminent\n\u201cmaintenance death spiral\u201d\nif the city did not step in.\nConfronted with those claims, the city has largely refused to acknowledge the pain. Instead, numerous council members, including Speaker Adrienne Adams, have repeatedly called on the Rent Guidelines Board,\u00a0the body that approves annual rent adjustments for stabilized units, to minimize increases to protect tenants.\nZohran Mamdani, leading in the New York City mayoral race, is running on a rent freeze.\nComptroller Brad Lander, meanwhile, has refuted claims that the surge in rent-stabilized vacancies is a problem. In a 2024 report, the comptroller found \u201cno evidence that the HSTPA led to an increase in vacancies, or distress on the city\u2019s rent stabilized housing.\u201d\nThe report went on to say proposals to allow landlords to deregulate units after vacancy are \u201ca dramatic overreaction.\u201d\nThe Community Housing Improvement Program, a trade association that\u2019s now part of NYAA, had pushed for a so-called rent reset bill that would allow owners to boost rents to closer to affordability levels connected to area median income; but critically, those apartments would remain rent-stabilized.\nMoving the needle?\nIt\u2019s unlikely the pension data, though glaring, will compel electeds to listen.\nA spokesperson for Lander\u2019s office did not respond to questions about the losses in the report.\n\u201cAs financial stewards of New York City\u2019s five public pension funds, investing in rent-stabilized housing reflects our commitment to utilizing our pension systems to steadily deliver long-term risk-adjusted investment returns while preserving access to stable and affordable housing as our housing crisis grows more dire,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nTo be sure, the city\u2019s pension fund on the whole is humming along just fine. It beat expectations in fiscal year 2025, earning a 10.3 percent return across the five systems, well above the 7 percent benchmark, Lander recently announced. And the $500 million rent-stabilized investment is a tiny piece of the pension fund, which was\u00a0valued at $294.6 billion in June.\nThat means the rent-stabilized stuff is no threat to city workers\u2019 retirements.\nEven faced with the numbers, the man who made the investment, then-comptroller Liu, has stood by the decision. Liu, a state senator who co-sponsored HSTPA, disputed the premise that rents aren\u2019t keeping pace with costs.\n\u201cFor every landlord that is facing financial hardship, there are still many more landlords that are doing just fine,\u201d he said in an interview with\nTRD\n.\nHe did acknowledge that some owners were struggling but said there could be any number of causes, including the pandemic or the Rent Guidelines Board \u201cnot providing the rent increases that probably should have been granted.\u201d\nHe underscored the law\u2019s wins: that it rightly blocked bad actors from speculating on rent-stabilized apartments or buying portfolios with the hope of deregulating units to boost rents.\n\u201cThank heaven we enacted the Tenant Protection Act in 2019 that reversed 20 years of a consistent pattern of apartment deregulation and people and families losing their homes,\u201d Liu said.\nMark Levine, the Democratic nominee for comptroller and the current Manhattan Borough President has said that he wants to beef up pension investment in affordable housing. He proposed investing $2.5 billion from unallocated ETI funds to offer affordable financing to developers to create or preserve affordable units. In the plan, he called affordable housing development \u201can increasingly safe investment.\u201d\nHis investments would be structured differently than Liu\u2019s Sandy investments, mostly acting as mezzanine debt that could eventually be converted to equity. That financing would allow projects that are sitting in line for other discretionary financing options to receive funding faster, in exchange for developers improving their project\u2019s affordability by either adding affordable units or making planned units more affordable.\nHe says that the investments would not be in the same kind of distressed, existing rent-regulated housing as the 2013 investment.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for that sweet spot where we have some certainty on a stable investment with regular returns, but also providing financing that might not otherwise be available to developers,\u201d Levine said in an interview with\nTRD\n.\nHe acknowledged that these investments \u201cmay on average have a slightly lower return than more typical investments but they\u2019re part of a broad portfolio and the pension fund has a really good track record of meeting its target of 7 percent returns on average over years.\u201d\nHowever it\u2019s discussed, the numbers show that protections against potential profiteers have\ndevalued rent-stabilized buildings\n.\nDevaluation doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect the physical condition of rent-stabilized buildings, sources say. It could reflect a market free from investors buying with the intent to deregulate, raise rents and value.\nThis, according to one former official, could be what the comptroller\u2019s office is arguing when it considers the poor performance of the rent-stabilized pension investments, that the numbers might look alarming, but they\u2019re just a natural reaction to long-term tenant protection.\nAdvocates and observers of the industry believe the city\u2019s dismissal of the data is purely political.\n\u201cThe politics is dictating the reaction to the rent law and its impact on the housing quality,\u201d Jay Martin, an executive at NYAA, said.\nThat is: Even if the rent law is creating vacancies that kill property values, exacerbating the housing crisis and driving losses \u2014 albeit small \u2014 to city workers\u2019 retirement accounts, electeds are not going to advocate for any change that would drive rents higher.\nTenants are their largest constituency, and tenants, as their advocates at every Rent Guidelines Board meeting this year have cried, are drowning, too.\nTo acknowledge the landlords\u2019 plight would be a bad look, Sherwin Belkin, a rent-stabilized attorney, said.\n\u201cIf they say, \u2018We made a mistake,\u2019 \u2014\u00a0and I think they made a whopper of a mistake by so many aspects of the 2019 law \u2014 that will lead to putting their re-election in jeopardy,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd first and foremost is, \u2018I want to stay in office.\u2019\u201d\n",

        "content": "Sterling Bay is continuing its sell-off streak, taking a $1.9 million loss on a prime Fulton Market parcel where the firm envisioned a 39-story apartment tower.\nThe Chicago developer sold the vacant site at 350 North Morgan Street for $18 million to a venture led by local investor Marc Bortz, Cook County property records show. The deal closed months after Sterling Bay secured Chicago City Council approval for the high-rise, but the firm has been trimming its\npipeline\nas financial pressure mounts, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nSterling Bay bought the parcel in March 2020 for $19.9 million. At the time, it planned an 18-story office building for Google, which would have marked a major expansion for the tech giant. The pandemic killed that deal, and like many developers, Sterling Bay pivoted to residential. The city signed off earlier this year on its plan for 500-plus apartments.\nSterling Bay has struggled to keep momentum at Lincoln Yards, the $6 billion megaproject it planned on the North Side. The company handed control of the northern portion to a lender and is reportedly preparing to sell off the southern half as well. Last month the firm listed a vacant, 284,000-square-foot lab-and-office building at\n1229 West Concord Place\nin Lincoln Yards. That building has a $67 million loan from Bank OZK maturing this month.\nIt has listed other Fulton Market sites, a Loop office building and land near\nLincoln Yards\n, even as it nears a deal to acquire Boeing\u2019s former Chicago headquarters in the West Loop, a 36-story building at\n100 North Riverside Plaza\n, which Boeing has owned since 2005.\nBortz\u2019s group could press forward with the entitled resi tower or pursue a new concept altogether. If apartments are the play, they\u2019d land in a hot rental market: Class A downtown rents climbed to $3.99 per square foot midway through 2025, up 6.4 percent year-over-year.\n\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Jonas Woods, a longtime force in downtown Dallas real estate, is shifting gears.\nThe developer handed day-to-day control of Pacific Elm Properties to co-founder and chief investment officer Billy Prewitt while teaming with Ignite-Rebees to form a new platform, 3-O Real Estate Partners, with a $4 billion pipeline in the works, D Magazine\nreported\n.\nThe move marks another pivot for Woods, who made his name launching Victory Park for Hillwood before spinning out on his own in 2008. He recapitalized Woods Capital as Pacific Elm in 2022, and under that banner has been a leader in Dallas\u2019\nadaptive reuse wave\n. Santander Tower, his 50-story trophy on Elm Street, was redeveloped with offices, apartments under the Peridot brand, a Mint House hotel and the Tower Club.\nPacific Elm and Ignite-Rebees are pooling assets into 3-O, a venture led by Woods alongside\nIgnite-Rebees\nfounders Tristan Simon, Mark Masinter and Tom Paterson. The companies didn\u2019t specify which properties would roll in, but said 3-O will manage 2 million square feet across Dallas, Austin, Houston, San Antonio, Nashville and Los Angeles, with billions in development queued up.\nPrewitt is stepping up as Pacific Elm\u2019s CEO after 17 years working alongside Woods.\n\n\u201cBilly has been intricately involved in every aspect of our business,\u201d Woods told the outlet. He will remain Pacific Elm\u2019s second-largest investor and strategic advisor.\nPacific Elm is hardly winding down. Its portfolio spans six Class A towers totaling 4.4 million square feet and 10 acres of development sites, including One Dallas Center, 2100 Ross, and the 500,000-square-foot\nBank of America Tower\nat Parkside, which is under construction. Santander Tower is getting a second Peridot phase, while the firm\u2019s broader pipeline spans 9.2 million square feet across Dallas and Raleigh, North Carolina, Bisnow\nreported\n.\nPacific Elm also promoted Clint Corn to chief investment officer, joining chief financial officer John Rutledge, chief managing officer Sara Terry and executive vice president Ashley Becker on the senior team. Prewitt said the succession plan, set in motion months ago, will keep the firm on track.\nThe handoff clears the way for Woods to focus on 3-O\u2019s expansion. Ignite-Rebees brings its own set of mixed-use plays, from\nHenderson Avenue\nin Dallas in partnership with Acadia Realty Trust to a 66-acre\nUptown ATX\npartnership with Brandywine Realty Trust, billed as a transit-oriented mixed-use community.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Douglas Peterson\u2019s City Skyline Realty is again facing the harsh reality of being a rental owner in Manhattan.\nPeterson is facing foreclosure on nine buildings in the borough, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. A handful of lawsuits were filed against him in Manhattan Supreme Court this week, alleging default on a combined seven buildings in Manhattan, as well as two more in the Bronx. City Skyline\u2019s defaulted debt allegedly totals $55.4 million.\nMaurice Arlos is listed as a defendant in the lawsuits, though his connection to the portfolio is unclear. Peterson declined to comment to the publication.\nArbor Agency Lending and Greystone Servicing issued the original loans \u2014 typically ranging between $5 million and $7.5 million \u2014 in 2018 and 2019. They were ultimately assigned to Freddie Mac, then later reassigned to Wilmington Trust, which serves as trustee for the debt. The lawsuit was filed by the special servicer of the debt, KeyBank National Association.\nThe Upper Manhattan buildings at risk of foreclosure are 517 West 161st Street, 446 West 164th Street, 1484 Amsterdam Avenue, 537 West 150th Street, 541 West 144th Street, 516 West 136th Street and 3694 Broadway. The Bronx buildings are at 1075 Nelson Avenue and 2105 Ryer Avenue.\nAll told, the buildings include 269 units, only two of which appear to be available on StreetEasy; both of those are in contract, too. Most of the buildings were acquired between 2014 and 2017, though a couple were acquired in 2010.\n\nThis is hardly Peterson\u2019s first run-in with distress across his portfolio, which totals nearly 1,300 units. In 2023, he\ndefaulted on loans\ntied to five rent-regulated buildings. Months later, he was\nhit by pre-foreclosure filings\nfrom Fannie Mae on 11 buildings in Upper Manhattan and the Bronx, though it doesn\u2019t appear any of the buildings match the latest batch of distressed properties.\nThose defaults totaled $72 million, bringing the firm\u2019s distressed debt to $108 million at the time, or about one-third of City Skyline\u2019s $316 million portfolio.\nIt\u2019s unclear how many of the units in City Skyline\u2019s latest foreclosure fight are rent-stabilized.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Bay Harbor Islands-based Blue Road, led by CEO Jorge Savloff, and Ilia, led by investment banker Germ\u00e1n Osorio, plan to tap into EB-5 investment for the project, adding to a growing pipeline of projects doing the same.\nThe minimum investment for EB-5 investors is $1.05 million.\nThe developers tapped Fortune International Real Estate\u2019s development sales arm to lead sales and marketing of the project, according to a press release. Units are priced from $380,000 to more than $1 million. The units will range from 552-square-foot studios to 1,412-square-foot three-bedroom condos, the release states.\nShort-term rentals will not be allowed, a spokesperson said.\nThe 40,000-plus square feet of amenities will include a pool deck, outdoor kitchens and lounge, spa rooms, a co-working space, market and cafe, pickleball court and pet spa.\n\nConstruction is expected to begin in mid 2026 and will take about three years to complete, according to the spokesperson.\nAn affiliate of the developers paid $7.5 million for the property in 2022, records show.\nThe project is named after the late William Fulford, a U.S. Coast Guard captain dating back more than a century who acquired a 160-acre plot of land that eventually became part of North Miami Beach.\nArchitect Carlos Ott and Behar Font &amp; Partners are designing the project, with interiors by Urban Robot, according to the release.\nThe project will mark at the least the second collaboration between Blue Road and\nEdgardo Defortuna\n\u2019s Fortune International Group in North Miami Beach. Fortune and Blue Road are building their\nNexo Residences,\na 16-story, 254-unit short-term rental-friendly condo building at 13899 Biscayne Boulevard.

He described his team as the launching pad for several top producers, including Michael Lorber, co-founder of his eponymous team, and Eleonora Srugo, the star of Netflix\u2019s \u201cSelling the City.\u201d\nBefore his departure, Sroka was advising the firm on its\ninternational expansion\n, a move CEO Michael Liebowitz announced earlier this year after ending a 15-year partnership with London-based Knight Frank.\nSroka\u2019s exit follows leaders of some of Elliman\u2019s top-producing teams, including Holly Parker, who left to join Compass in February, and Noble Black,\nwho returned\nto the Corcoran Group earlier this month.\n",

Therefore, it should come as no surprise that a building with the Kodak Film Lab as a tenant fit into the former category.\nThe firm\u2019s Standard Motors Product Building at 37-18 Northern Boulevard in Long Island City traded for $42 million, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The buyer was Jack Guttman\u2019s Pearl Realty Management.\nThe sale of the 300,000-square-foot Queens office building breaks down to $140 per square foot. It\u2019s likely a disappointing result for Rechler, which purchased the former automotive parts manufacturing facility\nfor $110 million\nin 2014.\nA Newmark team including Brett Siegel, Dan O\u2019Brien and Adam Spies brokered the sale. RXR declined to comment to the outlet, while Pearl Realty could not be reached.\nOther tenants include the Jim Henson Foundation, luxury homebuilder I Grace and luggage maker Rimowa, the latter two of which renewed their spaces about a year ago.\n\nThe building\u2019s debt was\npart of a $343 million portfolio\nof eight sub-performing loans that Flagstar Financial sold to Loan Star Funds earlier this year at a small discount to par. The $66 million loan tied to the Standard Motors property was issued in 2014, the same year RXR acquired the property.\nPearl Realty has been an active player in New York City real estate, despite not always making a splash with its movement. Last October, the firm picked up a Gowanus office building at 92 Third Street from Samson Management\nfor $29.5 million\n, or $314 per square foot.\nMeanwhile, RXR found what it could describe as a \u201cdigital\u201d asset,\nclosing a $1 billion deal\nfor 590 Madison Avenue in the Plaza District with a big private equity loan, representing New York City\u2019s largest investment sale in three years.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Developers from across the Los Angeles region came together to discuss the state of the construction market, the city, rebuilding efforts and more at\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s inaugural roundtable event in Hollywood.\nTop of mind, among other issues, was\nMeasure ULA\n, the so-called \u201cmansion tax\u201d that has\ndriven many developers\nout of L.A. city limits. Homeowners have similarly been repelled by the legislation.\n\u201cBuyers and sellers are absolutely disgruntled over ULA, and it is not going away. It\u2019s actually getting worse every day,\u201d\nAaron Kirman, CEO of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\n, said. \u201cWhen you are doing these deals and sellers can be charged anywhere between 4.5 and 5 percent additional fees on top of commissions and closing costs and everything else, it\u2019s make it or break it for a lot of these developers, not only on the luxury level, but for apartments, for retail, and everything in the middle.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s continuing to be challenging and they really need to fix it because it\u2019s the crux of the issues today when we\u2019re selling anything residential, even commercial, it comes up and it really has probably stopped 50 percent of the deals, maybe even more,\u201d Kirman added.\nSean Burton, chairman and CEO of Cityview\n, noted that local officials don\u2019t appear to see the issues with ULA.\n\u201cWhen you talk to city council members and others, I think they don\u2019t believe that ULA is slowing housing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think it\u2019s interest rates. They think it\u2019s ICE raids. They think it\u2019s tariffs. They don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s slowing housing. And we\u2019ve been working to provide data [to show that].\u201d\nIn July, the Los Angeles City Council voted to\ncommit $425 million of Measure ULA funds\nto affordable housing and homelessness programs. Dan Yukelson, CEO of the Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles, doesn\u2019t believe all that money is going to be used to help people by building housing.\n\u201cA big chunk of that is going to enrich attorneys to help tenants who are facing evictions for whatever violation that might have occurred under their lease agreement. Some of it would hopefully go to rental assistance, which is more direct relief to tenants,\u201d Yukelson said. \u201cBut\u2026 this is coming from a former planning commissioner in Beverly Hills: I don\u2019t have hopes that the City of L.A. could build anything reasonably efficiently at all. And that\u2019s why our organization has joined forces with the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association to try to overturn Measure ULA. It\u2019s just bad legislation.\u201d\nUltimately, ULA still presents a hurdle too high for some developers to overcome.\n\n\u201cWe have developers that would love to develop in L.A., that do develop in L.A., that are just saying until ULA gets off the books or changed substantially they\u2019re not going to do it,\u201d Burton said.\nMeanwhile, investor and developer Leo Pustilnikov served as an inspiration for some attendees for his\nchallenging of Beverly Hills officials over builder\u2019s remedy\n.\n\u201cI think what you\u2019re doing is the most important thing happening in the broader city, quite honestly,\u201d Larry Green, managing director of Cain Development, told Pustilnikov. \u201cYou really have shaken it up\u2026 I sit with the council [members] and they\u2019re afraid.\u201d\n\u201cWithout you sort of doing what you\u2019re doing, people would be still twiddling their fingers worrying about stuff,\u201d Green said. \u201cNow stuff is happening because you\u2019ve taken initiative and you\u2019re going for it and it\u2019s creating a carrot-and-stick approach. It\u2019s like, \u2018Guys, either get on board and do something or you know what? We\u2019re going to figure out another way.\u2019 And it\u2019s been dynamite.\u201d\nPustilnikov\u2019s view of his process was simple. \u201cIt\u2019s the Roosevelt approach: Speak softly and carry a big stick,\u201d Pustilnikov said. \u201cBut Beverly Hills is doing it to themselves. They had an opportunity to just have Linden [Surgical Center as builder\u2019s remedy]. And they refused to cooperate and now they have 12 projects.\u201d\nAs for the fire rebuilding process in the Pacific Palisades and Altadena,\nBalaciano Group founder and CEO Shawn Evenhaim\n, who lost his Malibu home in the January blazes, has given up on rebuilding there thanks to municipal missteps.\n\u201cMalibu is doing everything wrong and it\u2019s not surprising,\u201d he said. \u201cThey took the governor\u2019s order, which was pretty simple: Let them build, let them build quick, and let them build 10 percent more than what they had. And they put so many regulations on it,\u201d Evenhaim said. \u201cMy feeling is this time it\u2019s going to be even worse [than the 2018 Camp Fire in Northern California\u2019s Butte County], especially on the beach where they lost over 300 homes, and one of the homes was ours.\u201d\nTRD\n\u2019s Building Back LA Roundtable was filmed at Mother Wolf restaurant in Hollywood. Thanks to\nB/S/H\nfor sponsoring the event and making it possible.\n",

That\u2019s in addition to an unknown number of office staff. It\u2019s unclear at this point how many of its agents or support staff will make the move with them.\nThe couple cited Compass\u2019 scale, technology and marketing as they thanked their agents, employees and clients.\n\u201cAs part of this next chapter, we invite our agents to join us at Compass, where they will have access to the tools and platform needed to thrive,\u201d the Hiltons said.\nThe couple said they plan to build a multi-market team, beginning with a base in Compass\u2019 Beverly Hills office and what they described in the brokerage\u2019s announcement as a \u201cstrategic presence\u201d in Palm Beach. The couple previously had offices under their own banner in both markets.\nThe Hiltons, who declined to comment beyond their statement,\u00a0 bring their listing at 1305 Collingwood Place in the Hollywood Hills to Compass. The six-bed, eight-bath home is asking just under $29 million.\nNew start\n\nThe move brings a history-laden family name to Compass, stretching from legendary hotel magnate Conrad Hilton to pioneering influencer Paris Hilton.\nBarron and Tessa Hilton launched the brokerage with Barron Hilton\u2019s father, Rick Hilton, in March 2023.\nRick Hilton serves as brokerage chair and confirmed he will continue to work in real estate under the Hilton Hilton name.\n\u201cI will remain an active independent broker, continuing to serve my long-term clients, a portfolio of some of the world\u2019s most influential individuals and families,\u201d Rick Hilton said in a statement to\nTRD\n. \u201cHilton Hilton was a shared collaborative effort, and I\u2019m incredibly proud of what we built together.\nRick Hilton and the late Jeff Hyland started the boutique brokerage\nHilton &amp; Hyland\nin 1993, inspiring a whole generation of industry talent that have gone on to now dominate the market\u2019s\nrecord closings\nand overall high-end residential business. That includes\nCarolwood Estates\nfounders Drew Fenton and Ed Leyson and the Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Rayni and Branden Williams.\nHilton Hilton became tangled up in\nlitigatio\nn not long after its start, when Rick Hilton\u2019s former firm alleged in a January 2024 lawsuit it was owed back rent from subleased space on the ground floor of Hilton &amp; Hyland\u2019s offices at 270 North Canon Drive.\nSince the litigation, Hilton Hilton has largely remained out of the spotlight up until the June sale of a residence once owned by Mark Wahlberg in the gated Beverly Park Community to\nParis Hilton\n. Tessa and Barron Hilton represented his sister, Paris, and her husband Carter Reum in the $63.1 million deal for 71 Beverly Park.\nThe following month, Barron Hilton and Tessa Hilton represented Scale AI co-founder Lucy Guo in her $29.5 million purchase of 1680 North Doheny Drive.\n",

        "content": "Three years after Brookfield Properties landed in foreclosure at 175 West Jackson Boulevard, one of Chicago\u2019s most troubled Loop office towers may soon have a buyer \u2014 at a steep discount.\nNew York-based 601W Companies is in talks to acquire the 1.4 million-square-foot property, CoStar\nreported\n. The deal is not finalized and could still collapse given high borrowing costs, weak office demand and limited financing options. But if it closes, it would extend 601W\u2019s run as one of Chicago\u2019s most\nactive buyers of distressed office space\n, adding to its holdings that include the\nOld Post Office\nand the\nAon Center\n.\nThe price is unclear, but sources told CoStar it\u2019s expected to be just a fraction of the roughly $250 million balance tied to the property\u2019s CMBS loan. Brookfield paid nearly $306 million in 2018 \u2014 that\u2019s about $218 per square foot \u2014 financing the acquisition with $280 million in debt later bundled and sold off to investors. By 2022, the trustee for bondholders had filed a foreclosure suit, and the loan matured last fall with $250.5 million still outstanding. Special servicer LNR Partners never moved to take control, instead working toward a discounted sale to cut losses.\n\nThe building faces daunting fundamentals. Marketing materials from JLL, which is brokering the sale, peg vacancy at 53 percent, set to climb to nearly 60 percent with upcoming departures. The weighted average lease term is just under six years. Even after $24 million in recent upgrades, from spec suites to system overhauls, demand has not rebounded.\nThe 22-story Daniel Burnham\u2013designed building, constructed in phases in 1912 and 1927, is among the largest distressed office assets in the Loop. It joins a string of fire-sale deals across downtown, including this year\u2019s $45 million sale of 311 South Wacker Drive, a figure well below its $302 million 2014 trade.\nOpportunistic buyers like 601W might see a long play in the distressed Loop market, on the hunt for massive discounts. The firm has also circled\n525 West Van Buren Street\n, across from the Old Post Office, earlier this year. At the time of negotiations, the 516,000-square-foot tower was expected to go for a dramatic drop from the $135 million Boston-based AEW Capital Management paid for the building in 2015, down from roughly $261 per square foot to a range of $58-$68 per square foot.\n",

So far, just two of those projects have had their building plans approved.\nIn unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County, 418 rebuild permits have been issued in the Palisades and Eaton burn zones, according to the\ncounty\u2019s permitting tracker\n.

Igoe led projects through Sares Regis Group, the seventh-largest commercial\nreal estate developer\nin the Bay Area.\nBorn in Philadelphia in 1941, Igoe spent his high school years playing football and basketball while dating his eventual wife Peggy. He studied civil engineering at Villanova University and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1963.\nFrom there, Igoe spent five years in the\nU.S. Air Force\n, completing his stint in 1968. While in the Air Force, he was involved in one of the Air Force\u2019s spy aircraft programs and the military branch\u2019s California housing projects. He became a captain before returning to the classroom, going to Stanford to earn a graduate degree in civil engineering and Drexel for a master\u2019s in business administration. Those steps laid the groundwork for his career in real estate development.\nIgoe later oversaw the construction and design of PeopleSoft\u2019s 1-million-square-foot campus in Pleasanton. The company was acquired by Oracle in 2004. Since then, Oracle has sold and leased parts of the campus to other companies like\nKaiser Permanente\n.\n\nWhile working with Sares Regis, Igoe oversaw the development of the award-winning Taube Koret Campus for Jewish Life in Palo Alto. He also spearheaded notable projects in Southern California, like the corporate campus for enterprise cybersecurity provider Symantec in Culver City.\nAt Google, Igoe worked as the tech giant\u2019s director of design and construction. In that role, he helped guide\nGoogle\u2019s real estate\nexpansion, including managing the development of more than 23 million square feet of offices. That included its Bay View Campus in Mountain View and its mass timber office in Sunnyvale.\nIgoe is survived by his wife of 59 years, Peggy, five children and 13 grandchildren.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The REIT expects to price the deal Sept. 30 and begin trading Oct. 1 on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, with a dual listing planned for London.

But the IPO offers a high-profile bet that massive energy and land commitments can be packaged as a REIT\u2014 a structure typically reserved for office landlords, hotel operators and more traditional asset classes.\nPerry sits on the board.

The venture is setting its sights on more deals and counts powerful backers among the ranks.\nInvestors in the venture include Baupost Group, King Street Capital Management, Criterion Real Estate Capital, Liberty Mutual Investments and Abrams Capital. Last month, RXR announced an expanded credit partnership with Liberty Mutual to deploy up to $1 billion in the multifamily market.\n\u201cThe last 18- to 24 months now, we\u2019ve been buying office, primarily from institutions that are seeking to reduce their office exposure as the markets were going through this transition,\u201d Rechler said in a statement. He added that the market values compared to the last cycle were at roughly 50 percent discounts.\nGemini\u2019s already made three deals in Manhattan, including one of the largest office deals in New York City in years.\n\nLast month, RXR closed on the\n$1 billion acquisition\nof 590 Madison Avenue, pulling in a $785 million loan from Apollo Global Management to close the sale of the Plaza District office building from the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio. It was the city\u2019s largest investment deal in three years.\nGemini, which owns 49 to 51 percent of the buildings in its portfolio, also backed the acquisition of a minority stake of a Midtown office tower. At the start of the year, RXR bought a\n49 percent stake\nin Ivanhoe Cambridge\u2019s 1211 Sixth Avenue, a property valued at $1.2 billion.\nGemini also has a stake in the Starrett-Lehigh building in West Chelsea, where Ralph Lauren\nrenewed\n250,000 square feet two years ago.\nNew York City\u2019s office market is piquing investors looking to snap up deals at discounts and bank on the city\u2019s recovery.

        "content": "Brookfield Place will be Brookfield\u2019s place in Battery Park City far into the future.\nThe real estate giant extended its ground lease at the 9.4-million-square-foot Manhattan complex for another 50 years, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The lease with the Battery Park City Authority, a state agency, isn\u2019t scheduled to expire until 2119.\nAs part of the extension for the office complex, Brookfield agreed to pay higher ground-rent payments. The payments are expected to generate $1.5 billion for the city and a joint fund supporting affordable housing development across the city. Last year, the governor, mayor and comptroller announced a $500 million investment in the same fund.\nAnother aspect of the extension is a commitment from Brookfield to reduce emissions, aimed at a net-zero goal by 2050. Additionally, the firm will contribute up to $2.5 million to improve West Street and designate 10,000 square feet of office space for nonprofits and community organizations.\n\u201cThis agreement not only ensures the stability of Battery Park City while building and preserving more affordable homes throughout New York City \u2014 it also uplifts the city\u2019s economy with the continued lease to Brookfield Place,\u201d Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a statement.\n\nDarcy Stacom and CBRE\u2019s Eric Negrin were among those to advise the Battery Park City Authority on the lease negotiations, while Savills\u2019 David Heller and Mark Todrys were among those to advise Brookfield.\nOffice rents at Brookfield Place range from $53 to $65 per square foot, according to CoStar. Brookfield acquired the complex from bankrupt Olympia and York in 1992, spending $900 million to modernize the asset in the last decade.\nEarlier this year, Jane Street Capital\nexpanded\nits footprint at Brookfield\u2019s 250 Vesey Street in Battery Park City to nearly 1 million square feet. The expansion of roughly 400,000 square feet added to the 600,000 square feet Jane Street previously occupied.\nOther tenants at the complex include Royal Bank of Canada and Jones Day. Scotiabank occupies 131,000 square feet, but that space appears to be in jeopardy as it\nrelocates\nto another Brookfield building, 660 Fifth Avenue.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Robert Rivani continued to shrink his Miami commercial condo portfolio with the $19.8 million sale of a two-story space in Miami\u2019s Edgewater leased to a Michael Schwartz restaurant.\nHis Miami-based firm\nRivani\n, formerly called Black Lion, sold the 12,316-square-foot unit at 3101 Northeast Seventh Avenue within the Paraiso Bay condominium complex, a press release states. The space is occupied by Amara at Paraiso, a Latin-infused restaurant owned and operated by Schwartz\u2019s The Genuine Hospitality Group.\nA JLL team led by Alex Sharrin and Jeffrey Cicurel represented Rivani, the release states. The buyer is a Chicago real estate investor \u201cmaking their first splash in South Florida,\u201d Sharrin said in a statement. Rivani and the brokers declined to reveal the buyer\u2019s identity.\nRivani is among the most active firms selling and buying hospitality, retail and restaurant properties in South Florida. Last month, Rivani dropped\n$37 million\nfor Lincoln Theatre, a historic Art Deco building at 551 Lincoln Road in Miami Beach. The 98 percent leased property is anchored by fashion retailer H&amp;M. Other tenants include Swatch and Tapelia Spanish Cuisine.\n\nAlso in August, Rivani landed Beverly Hills-based\nPlayboy\nas the anchor tenant for The Rivani, a seven-story, mixed-use building at 1691 Michigan Avenue, just off Lincoln Road. The iconic media brand is planning to move its global headquarters to Miami Beach.\nPlayboy signed a 10-year lease for a 20,000-square-foot penthouse space at The Rivani. But the high-profile tenant can cancel the agreement if the\ncity of Miami Beach\ndeclines to provide $800,000 in incentives.\nLast year, Rivani purchased that building and a ground lease underneath the land for\n$62.5 million\n. The land is owned by the city of Miami Beach. Rivani is also spending $40 million to renovate the building, which will include a speakeasy lounge and a sushi restaurant.\nSince January, Rivani has sold three other commercial condos leased to high-end restaurants, starting with the\n$28.2 million\nsale of a commercial building in Miami Beach\u2019s South of Fifth neighborhood occupied by seafood restaurant Catch.\nIn May, the firm sold a space at SLS Lux Brickell leased to Gekk\u00f5, a Japanese steakhouse owned by musician Bad Bunny and Miami Beach-based hospitality mogul David Grutman, and a space at Dua Miami Hotel leased to Mexican restaurant RosaNegra Miami. The units sold for a combined\n$38.2 million\n.",

        "content": "Compass\u2019\n$1.6 billion deal to buy\nAnywhere Real Estate set off market-share talk across the industry, but boutiques on the high end of the Los Angeles market aren\u2019t sweating it.\nCarolwood\u2019s Drew Fenton, CEO and co-founder of Los Angeles County\u2019s fastest-growing boutique brokerage, offered a bullish take via text: \u201cThe merger is 110 percent beneficial for Carolwood and other boutique brokerages.\u201d\nTo be sure, he\u2019s part of an elite tier of L.A.\u2019s high end. This year, he and his Beverly Hills-based brokerage appeared on both of the megadeals tied for priciest in Los Angeles County:\n630 Nimes Road\nin Bel-Air and\nSpelling Manor\nat 594 South Mapleton Drive. Both sold for $110 million.\nThe brokerage firms may be small, but claim an outsized influence in Los Angeles. Among the market\u2019s\ntop 20 brokerages\n, the nine independents made up a little over one-third of the $51 billion generated between July 1, 2024, and July 1, 2025, according to analysis by\nThe Real Deal\nof closed deals in the Multiple Listing Service.\nOnce closed,\nCompass\u2019 deal for Anywhere\nwill create an entity with about 50 percent share of the market. (Compass and Coldwell Banker Realty alone ranked No. 1 and 2, respectively, in\nTRD\u2019s most recent ranking\n.)\nThere\u2019s plenty of room for the rest of the field with the other 50 percent, said Beverly Hills-based Nourmand &amp; Associates President Michael Nourmand.\n\u201cIt gives the boutique brokerages a lot of opportunity,\u201d said Nourmand. \u201cThe upside is opportunity that there will be movement, that there will be agents that aren\u2019t happy with the sale.\nAs a result, the merger could shake loose some talent into the laps of independents, but it\u2019s not an apples-to-apples move.\n\u201cWith this purchase, they\u2019re not buying a boutique and rolling them into a conglomerate,\u201d said Stephen Shapiro, co-founder of Beverly Hills-based Westside Estate Agency. \u201cThey\u2019re buying another conglomerate, so the agents are already with Coldwell Banker or Sotheby\u2019s or however many damn names they have.\u201d\nOn closer examination\nThe changes one can count on are logistical cuts to reduce operational efficiencies are inevitable and could change the office real estate landscape.\nIn Beverly Hills alone, Compass, Coldwell Banker Realty, Sotheby\u2019s International Realty and Christie\u2019s International Real Estate each have their own offices. That\u2019s low-hanging fruit to cut two of a brokerage\u2019s biggest expenses: staff and rent, according to Nourmand.\n\u201cThis is M&amp;A 101,\u201d Nourmand said. \u201cThe first thing you do is say, \u2018Nothing\u2019s going to change\u2019 and then you slowly make changes, and you try to plan them out and make them incremental enough.\u201d\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t come and make this bold, risky acquisition to let the brands be independent,\u201d Nourmand added. \u201cYou buy companies to make changes.\u201d\n\nSome in L.A. agree, this is a market share play, whether that\u2019s with respect to agent headcount or owning the inventory and getting sellers to place their properties on the Compass listings or Compass Private Exclusives platforms.\nIf a sizable chunk of inventory sits on a Compass platform, another L.A. brokerage executive said the implications are more than just share. It could lead to the toppling of commission structures as agents know them today.\n\u201cThis is more about Compass positioning itself to better overturn Clear Cooperation and become a real estate search \u201cportal\u201d with listings no one else has. If this is successful, they will create a direct link with the consumer and use that link to \u2018sell\u2019 that consumer back to the agent in the form of a lower percentage of the commission.\n\u201cWhat the agents fail to understand is that this is the first play in a long game to reduce their splits,\u201d the executive added. \u201cI do not expect Compass to admit to this.\u201d\nGuessing game\nAsk an L.A. executive if they see\nmore acquisitions\nfor the market and the responses are mixed.\n\u201cMoves of this scale will certainly accelerate further consolidation across the industry,\u201d The Agency CEO and founder Mauricio Umansky said in a statement provided to\nTRD\n. \u201cAt the same time, they open even more space for boutique firms like The Agency \u2014 where independence, creativity and collaboration allow us to deliver an elevated and deeply personal real estate experience.\u201d\nWestside Estate Agency\u2019s Shapiro said he\u2019s not so sure about the M&amp;A wave continuing.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s left? Prudential? There really isn\u2019t much more to consolidate,\u201d he said.\nFor boutique consolidation, Shapiro doesn\u2019t buy that either. He referenced the initial idea for WEA, which was to structure the brokerage like a law firm where partners divided the profits annually.\n\u201cThe agents at the larger companies that were successful were afraid to leave the mothership,\u201d he said of the market reception. \u201cThey weren\u2019t entrepreneurial. And if you\u2019re talking about boutiques getting together, then who\u2019s the head of that snake? You have a bunch of independent people getting together that still want to be\nindependent\nand then it becomes the same problem.\u201d\nIndustry gossip and speculation runs part and parcel with the rush from mega closings. While no one really knows with certainty which way the deal goes, it\u2019s still entertaining for some to ruminate over the what-ifs.\n\u201cWhat do I know,\u201d Shapiro said, \u201cand, furthermore, what do I care? But it\u2019s fun to talk about.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Edward Hassan and Adam Firsel cashed out while they were up big this summer from a bet on distressed suburban Chicago retail they made back in 2019.\nA joint venture of Firsel\u2019s Deerfield-based firm\nCore Acquisitions\nand Hassan\u2019s Orland Park-based Edwards Realty fetched $55 million for its nearly 200,000-square-foot\nBurr Ridge Village Center\nshopping destination in the western suburbs. They sold the property for $275 per square foot to Chicago-based investor David L. Husman\u2019s company Heartland Real Estate Partners, according to public records.\nThe deal completed a lucrative turnaround for Core and Edwards, who paid just $15 million six years ago to buy the property out of distress from an offshoot of its original developer. Soon after buying, Core and Edwards dealt with losing a couple of tenants due to their respective companies\u2019 bankruptcies, Firsel said.\nThe property was built by Minnesota-based\nOpus Group\nback in 2007 at a cost of $85 million, according to previous reports, but Core and Edwards took it over from an affiliate of the developer known as Founders Properties at a fraction of that cost. Founders had refinanced Burr Ridge Village Center for a little more than $18.5 million in 2014, but brick-and-mortar retail was struggling at the time.\nHowever, the sector has bounced back, as evidenced by Core\u2019s ensuing renovations and a leasing campaign that cost another $7 million to refill the property to over 95 percent, from just 60 percent at the time of its acquisition. Its improvements included creating an \u201centertainment district\u201d by closing off a road and replacing it with a brick-laden pedestrian-only zone between tenant stores Hampton Social and Topaz Cafe, Firsel said.\n\n\u201cWe also brought in a lot of medical tenants,\u201d he said, noting that Core rented to dermatology, veterinary, physical therapy and healthcare tenants.\nHusman didn\u2019t comment on the transaction. But his firm has invested previously with Core Acquisitions and is keeping Core as Burr Ridge Village Center\u2019s property manager. Retail broker Mid-America Real Estate led the lease-up effort for Core and is still advertising the property.\nWhile the Burr Ridge deal was completed quietly this summer in an off-market transaction without real estate brokers, it set the stage for another big gain recently posted for a suburban Chicago retail property revived from financial disaster.\nTo the north, the\n600,000-square-foot Algonquin Commons\nshopping center traded this month to Chicago-based asset manager Nuveen for $100 million, four years after its previous owners Red Mountain Group and F&amp;F Capital bought it for just $30 million and then spent another $33 million on its comeback. In 2006, it had been valued at $154 million in a purchase by Inland Real Estate that resulted in a big loan default.\n",

Ganger, who died in April, according to his obituary in\nCoastal Star,\nGanger had a decades-long career at General Foods, the successor of the Postum Cereal Company that sold to Philip Morris Companies (now Altria) for $5.6 billion in 1985, according to published reports. It eventually merged into the grocery giant Kraft Foods. Ganger\u2019s father,\nRobert M. Ganger\n, was a prominent advertising executive credited with popularizing diet soda and filtered cigarettes.\nThe father-son duo bought Miradero for an undisclosed amount in 1970, according to the younger Ganger\u2019s obituary. Robert W. Ganger restored the property with his wife, Anneli Ganger, in the 1990s. The three-building compound totals nine bedrooms, 10 bathrooms and a pool and spans 121 feet of beachfront, records show.\nThe Ganger family listed it for $25 million last month, Zillow shows. It marks the latest expensive\nGulf Stream\nsale in recent months. Earlier this month, attorney Henry Rosen\ndropped $22 million\non the oceanfront home at 3435 North Ocean Boulevard. Last year, Debra Levitetz, the ex-wife of Purity Wholesale Grocers founder Jeffrey Levitetz, set the price record for the coastal town when she sold her oceanfront teardown for\n$39 million\n.",

The lawsuit also names the West Palm Beach Community Redevelopment Agency, or CRA, as a defendant.\nThe CRA owns the 2.4-acre property at 801 South Dixie Highway, and entered into a ground lease in 2020 with the Cohen affiliate, which is planning\nWest Palm Point\n, a 23-story tower with 352,000 square feet of offices and 25,000 square feet of ground-floor retail, records show.\n\nCohen Brothers has not been served with any foreclosure filing, \u201cbut our lender has confirmed that the foreclosure complaint is being withdrawn immediately,\u201d Cohen Brothers Senior Vice President Ross Cohen told\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\u201cWe are in the process of refinancing the existing loan via our project financing, which is closing imminently,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThe existing loan is also in the process of being extended in the interim.\u201d\nMichael Woodbury, an attorney representing Union Labor, did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe Cohen affiliate filed a notice of commencement for West Palm Point last year, records show. Ross Cohen said the firm plans to break ground soon.\nThe West Palm Point foreclosure complaint is the latest headache for Cohen, whose net worth Forbes pegs at $1.6 billion. In New York, Cohen Brothers last month struck a deal to sell a distressed office building at 623 Fifth Avenue for\n$188 million\n, as part of its efforts to repay a $187 million judgment to Fortress Investment Group. A portion of the sale proceeds would cover some of the debt owed to Fortress.\nAnother lender won a foreclosure judgment in July for Cohen\u2019s Midtown East, a 31-story office tower at 750 Lexington Avenue that was recently valued at\n$41 million\n. That\u2019s more than an 85 percent drop from the property\u2019s $300 million valuation in 2015, according to Morningstar Credit.",

The development will feature one- and two-bedroom units and parking for 54 vehicles.

That adds to its headquarters footprint of more than 230,000 square feet across the street at Foundry Square IV.\nOpen AI, meanwhile, has similarly\nbeen on a tear in San Francisco\nin recent years. In 2023, the Sam Altman-led giant subleased nearly 500,000 square feet of offices from Uber at 1455 and 1515 Third Street in Mission Bay. The following year, it picked up\nanother 315,000 square feet\nnext door at 550 Terry A. Francois Boulevard. As it stands, the ChatGPT creator boasts more than 1 million square feet of offices in the city.\n\nNew tenants entering the San Francisco office market have sought an average of 34,000 square feet, the Business Times reported.\n\u201cWhile New York showcases resilient growth within its diverse industry base, San Francisco presents an even more dramatic, tech-concentrated boom, with office demand skyrocketing since the public release of ChatGPT and the cascading demand for AI that was created,\u201d Saia said.\nAs of last month, San Francisco saw a 107 percent year-over-year increase in office demand \u2014 up more than 350 percent since ChatGPT was first released to the public in late 2022, according to the Business Times.\nSan Francisco and the Bay Area are expected to see an influx of more than 50,000 workers in the AI sector by 2030,\naccording\nto a recent report from CBRE.

        "content": "Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s plan to reset committee leadership and recalibrate his alliances landed dead on arrival Thursday as Chicago City Council wouldn\u2019t provide the 26 votes necessary to fill several vacancies.\nJohnson\u2019s plan was to fill the opening left by Chicago City Council dean Walter Burnett\u2019s retirement with progressives that might appease criticism from both the Latino Caucus and Black Caucus, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Although Burnett\u2019s replacement \u2014 his son, 29-year-old Walter \u201cRed\u201d Burnett \u2014 was unanimously confirmed to take over the 27th Ward seat, no committee chairmanships were voted on.\nThe biggest prize \u2014 chair of the zoning committee \u2014 Johnson slated for 1st Ward Alderman Daniel La Spata, a progressive who helped Johnson push through a landmark ordinance slashing parking requirements for\ntransit-oriented developments\n, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n. A cycling advocate known for championing protected bike lanes, La Spata is set to lead high-stakes negotiations with developers that shape the city\u2019s growth and housing pipeline.\nIf confirmed, La Spata would have sidelined 44th Ward Alderman Bennett Lawson, who\u2019d been serving as interim chair since the fall but was deemed too green to keep the role. Kennedy Bartley, the mayor\u2019s chief of external affairs, told the outlet that La Spata\u2019s efforts around parking minimums and other reforms made it easier to\nbuild housing\nin the city.\n\nWhoever ends up as chair of zoning will lead discussions with developers and either help push Johnson\u2019s effort to increase the speed of affordable housing development or come at odds with it. The city is still\nshort\nof an estimated 120,000 affordable units currently needed in the community, leaving the mayor to bet that La Spata can drive reforms to speed up housing construction.\nThe other key move in Johnson\u2019s plan was for 37th Ward Alderman Emma Mitts to replace Burnett as vice mayor. The veteran alderman has a long and sometimes fraught history with Johnson, including a very public spat last year when she accused him of reneging on a promised housing committee\nchairmanship\n. Burnett\u2019s version of the vice mayor role came with a $400,000 budget and an assignment as Johnson\u2019s political envoy; Mitts, who has criticized the mayor\u2019s handling of council relations, said she didn\u2019t expect the same perks and vowed to keep her independence.\nOther stalled moves included who would take La Spata\u2019s pedestrian and traffic safety committee. Johnson wanted that to shift to 40th Ward Alderman Andre Vasquez, a frequent Johnson critic who led the charge against the mayor\u2019s failed $300 million property tax hike during last year\u2019s bruising budget battle. Vasquez\u2019s former committee, immigrant and refugee rights, would then have been chaired by first-year 26th Ward Alderman Jessie Fuentes, a close Johnson ally. The contracting oversight and equity committee, previously held by Mitts, was proposed for 17th Ward Alderman David Moore to take over.\nThe planned reshuffle provided a glimpse into Johnson\u2019s effort to both shore up his base and placate critics. But critics were unappeased, pushing votes on committee chairmanships further into the fall.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "As Texas Gov. Greg Abbott sees it, the state is primed for a massive influx of data center and AI-related investments unlike any so far.\nAbbott said diversifying the state economy with nontraditional industries was paramount, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\u00a0 Abbott\u2019s remarks, at a Texas Economic Development investor summit this week, came amid Oracle\u2019s plans with OpenAI and SoftBank to invest $400 billion over the next three years to open AI data centers across the country, in a joint venture dubbed \u201cProject Stargate.\u201d\nThe first Stargate campus opened in Abilene earlier this year.\nAbbott teased to-be-announced AI-related investments coming soon to\nTexas\n, which he claimed could be bigger than Stargate.\nFive more Stargate centers are on tap, including locations in Shackleford County and Milam County in Texas, as well as Lordstown, Ohio and Do\u00f1a Ana County, New Mexico. Another is planned for the midwest.\nSeven gigawatts of capacity for AI-related data processing will be reached once all five are completed, along with 25,000 onsite jobs and thousands of ancillary positions across the country.\n\nThe data center in Abilene is projected to consume 6 GW, nearly double the daily usage of the Texas Rio Grande Valley, for example.\nPlentiful land and infrastructure has made Texas a hub for data centers, according to CBRE. The Dallas-Fort Worth metro has about one-tenth of the U.S. data center market, the largest share after Northern Virginia. But power capacity is a\nchief concern\n. Abbott said the state produces more electricity than any other, generating 12 percent of the nation\u2019s total.\nIData Center equating to more than a gigawatt of capacity are under construction in Dallas-Fort Worth, said Curt Holcomb, managing director for data center solutions at JLL. Holcomb estimated another four gigawatts are in planning stages.\nHow that fares against the increased need for water and electricity created by these data centers remains to be seen, with\ndata computing\nexpected to increase electricity demand by 7 percent this year and 15 percent in 2026 according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\nSome developers are proposing electricity production\u00a0 along with the whole data center package. Fermi Inc., the real estate investment trust co-founded by former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, is pitching\n\u201cProject Matador\u201d\non land owned by Texas Tech University, a 5,000-acre advanced energy and intelligence campus aiming to attract data center and hyperscaler tenants, with plans for 11 gigawatts of power by 2038 from natural gas, solar, and nuclear sources.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "\u201cMember deference\u201d is not dead, but it cracked more than ever on Thursday.\nThe City Council, in an unprecedented move, voted twice at the same meeting to approve real estate projects over the objections of the local Council members.\nThe two most recent examples of this break from Council custom had been single votes in 2021 and 2009.\nOne of Thursday\u2019s votes was expected, as Council leaders had\nmade clear\nearlier in the week that the chamber would approve\n58 units of supportive housing\nin the Bronx for people just released from incarceration.\nIn that case, the overwhelming Democratic chamber defied Republican Kristy Marmorato, who in 2023\nousted a Democratic incumbent\nin part by campaigning against the project. Mayor Eric Adams, who is warring with Council leaders, also opposed the Bronx project after previously supporting it.\nBecause of that unique set of circumstances, the Council\u2019s action does not necessarily signal an increased willingness to buck the local member.\nThe other vote, on a more typical project, came a bit out of the blue. It may be more relevant to the real estate industry, which for decades has been held hostage by the local Council member on rezonings because the other 50 members nearly always parrot their colleague\u2019s vote.\nBy a vote of 37 to 8, members approved a\nrezoning\nto allow 53 units of affordable housing for seniors at 1946 East Seventh Street in Homecrest, a block from Ocean Parkway.\nOne of the \u201cno\u201d votes was from that district\u2019s representative, the conservative, convivial Democrat Simcha Felder. Some neighbors of the project site were opposed to the seven-story project, calling it too big. It will replace two vacant, four-story apartment buildings built in 1925.\n\nSome NIMBY opposition is almost always inevitable, even for utterly harmless projects like the one proposed for East Seventh Street by Ahi Ezer Congregation, an Orthodox Jewish organization. Felder is also Orthodox, and is at no risk of losing his seat, yet he folded like a cheap suit at the behest of the noisy neighbors.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good project,\u201d one of Felder\u2019s colleagues texted\nThe Real Deal\nmoments after the vote. \u201cI\u2019m glad we passed it.\u201d\nAffordable housing for seniors is among the easiest uses to get through the Council. Letting people on fixed incomes age in place appeals to progressives and conservatives alike. Local opposition is generally muted because elderly people are quiet and law-abiding, and don\u2019t contribute to traffic congestion or school or subway crowding.\nStill, Community Board 15 voted 32-0 against the application for East Seventh Street, calling the project\u2019s height \u201cdetrimental to the community in terms of congestion, traffic, and the shadows it will cause on neighboring properties.\u201d\n\u201cIt is way out of character for the neighborhood,\u201d the board concluded in a characteristic, knee-jerk reaction to any increase in housing density.\nAhi Ezer\u2019s proposal was supported by Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and the City Planning Commission. \u201cThe change in zoning from R5 to R6A/R7A will facilitate much needed senior affordable housing in the area,\u201d Reynoso\u2019s recommendation stated.\nBut the override of Felder had more to do with outgoing Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, who vowed early in her tenure that the chamber would increase housing production, and with the chamber\u2019s Progressive Caucus, which has embraced \u201cabundance\u201d as an answer to the housing shortage.\nThursday\u2019s votes were a promising sign that the Council is more willing than ever to put the city\u2019s housing shortage ahead of narrow-minded neighbors and their local representative.\n",

        "content": "The\nair rights revolution\nwas just getting started when\nThe Real Deal\ncovered it in June. At that time, however, the evidence was anecdotal.\nNow we have data.\nDevelopment rights transfers are on pace to increase by 39 percent this year and to reach their highest level since 2016, according to PropertyScout CEO Wilson Parry.\nThe jump will actually be much higher, broker Bob Knakal predicted, because so many deals are pending.\n\u201cIt\u2019s off the charts,\u201d Knakal said. \u201cBy the end of the year it\u2019s going to be triple what it was last year.\u201d\n\u201cThe assemblage game has totally changed.\u201d\nWilson Parry, PropertyScout\nCredit the\nCity of Yes\nlegislation, passed last fall, which\ngreatly increased\nproperty owners\u2019 ability to sell their unused development rights, and last month\u2019s\nMidtown South rezoning\n, which gave buildings in the neighborhood more of them to sell.\nCity of Yes eased air-rights transfers for split districts and landmarked properties, and introduced more flexible zoning envelopes, giving developers more ability to use air rights.\nFor example, to build a tower on an Upper East Side avenue, one can now purchase development rights from scores of townhomes on lower-density side streets nearby.\nA typical Upper East Side townhouse might have 2,000 to 4,000 square feet of unused air rights, sometimes more. That can add two to four apartments to a project that buys them.\nA development site can also now shop for landmarked properties\u2019 air rights from an area about 10 times larger than before.\n\u201cYou used to have two or three potential buyers of your air rights,\u201d Knakal said. \u201cNow you have 30 or 40.\u201d\nLandmark air rights are said to be selling for $180 to $400 per square foot of zoning floor area, meaning buildable square footage, but generally for $200 to $250. If a developer has a site worth $500 a foot, and can buy air rights for $250 a foot, the path to a deal is clear.\nThe other two types of transfers liberalized by the City of Yes were Zoning Law Development Agreements, or ZLDAs (pronounced zeldas), and special district transfers. The latter might allow a Theater District property to sell development rights to any of several dozen parcels.\nTo take advantage of the changes, Genessy Jaramillo, a managing director at Knakal\u2019s shop, BKREA, is exclusively working on air-rights deals. \u201cIt\u2019s on fire,\u201d said. \u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer to be in this niche right now.\u201d\nDevelopers and investment sales brokers, not property owners, are driving the activity. Many owners don\u2019t even know they have air rights to sell, or that they can now transfer them to parcels farther away than just next door or across the street.\nTheir ignorance is understandable. Air rights are an esoteric concept that few New Yorkers pay attention to, if they have heard of it at all. It never comes up in media appearances by Mayor Eric Adams because it is too far in the weeds for a general audience.\nAs a result, what the air rights revolution means for real estate and the city\u2019s skyline has been entirely overlooked by the mainstream media \u2014 and to a large extent by industry publications, too.\nNot by the industry, though.\n\n\u201cThe assemblage game has totally changed with this,\u201d Parry said. \u201cAny developer that\u2019s doing something in Manhattan is definitely keen to this.\u201d\nHe can see their excitement from the vantage point of his business. PropertyScout subscriptions have more than tripled in part because its software lets users see what unused air rights any Manhattan property has and where they can be transferred.\nParry has been fielding calls from users who reach the maximum number of daily property searches \u2014 typically 50 \u2014 allowed by their subscription tier and plead for an exception to see more.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a toy, what you built,\u201d one told him. \u201cIt\u2019s like a game.\u201d\nThe City of Yes has made the assemblage game more fun for builders and brokers. For example, clicking on a landmarked property now highlights a plethora of parcels that can buy its air rights, instead of merely several.\n\u201cIt went from four to six lots before City of Yes to like 60,\u201d Parry said. \u201cIt\u2019s a 10x increase.\u201d\nSurges in development-rights transfers previously occurred from 2005 to 2007 (averaging 115 per year) and from 2013 to 2016 (averaging 109), triggered by a combination of high land prices and rising applications for new buildings, Parry\nreported\non LinkedIn.\nThis year\u2019s projected total of 92 is probably understated, as Knakal noted, because transfers involving landmarked properties take longer than for the two other types. Dozens of these transfers are said to be in the works but had not been recorded yet when Parry tallied the numbers through Aug. 1.\n\u201cLandmark expansion hasn\u2019t shown up yet,\u201d Parry said, citing a certification step that delays deals. \u201cIt\u2019s lagging.\u201d\nPrior to the law changing, only 15 landmark transfers happened in 50 years. \u201cBefore the City of Yes, the landmarks transfer was a total failure,\u201d Parry said.\nNot only were transfer options limited to a few properties for each landmark, but the process was cumbersome and expensive. It required a special permit, which involves a public review and City Council approval.\nCertification is now much easier: The Department of City Planning takes the potential deal to the Landmarks Preservation Commission, which verifies that the seller has a plan to maintain the historic property.\n\u201cWhat used to take a couple of years now takes six to nine months,\u201d Knakal said, adding that a seller can close in 60 to 90 days and leave the certification process to the buyer.\nThe longtime broker, famed for his \u201cmap room\u201d of Manhattan properties, has charted every landmarked building south of 96th Street.\n\u201cWe\u2019re calling all those owners,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have real estate professionals selling air rights, institutions selling air rights, public companies selling air rights, and we have the proverbial little old ladies selling air rights.\u201d\nKnakal\u2019s pitch to property owners is fairly simple: There\u2019s no way to monetize air rights without selling them, and selling them doesn\u2019t reduce a building\u2019s revenue.\nManhattan has 1,220 landmarked buildings. The new law changed the rules for individual landmarks, not all properties in historic districts.\nAir rights do not automatically allow developers to build bigger projects. Height limits, setback requirements, street wall parameters and other factors collectively determine a site\u2019s potential. A massing study must be done to lay out the possibilities.\nFiguring that out, and how to transfer air rights to where you want them, \u201cis like three-dimensional chess,\u201d Knakal said.\n",

Developers in the outer boroughs locked in nine-figure loans to finish construction, refinance aging debt and reimagine retail hubs.\nThe month\u2019s top deals totaled almost $1.3 billion, led by a $340 million loan from Affinius Capital for Sky Equity Group\u2019s Gowanus multifamily project. Beitel borrowed $305 million for its multifamily project in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the Bronx. And Douglaston Development and Corebridge Real Estate Investors reeled in $287 million for their luxury rental tower on the Williamsburg waterfront.\nHere are the top five loans in the outer boroughs.\nSky high | $340M | Gowanus\nAffinius Capital\nprovided a $340 million loan to Sky Equity Group for its Gowanus multifamily development. The loan will allow the builders to finish construction and lease the 603-unit, mixed-use complex at 313 Bond Street. The luxury development, between Union and President streets, includes two multifamily buildings and 51,600 square feet of retail space. Sky Equity is reportedly affiliated with Simon Duchinsky\u2019s Rabsky group; the loan for the project replaces Rabsky\u2019s existing\n$286 million construction loan\nthat G4 Capital provided last year.\nScaling up | $305M | Mott Haven\nScale Lending\n, Slate Property Group\u2019s lending arm, provided a $305 million loan to Beitel for its multifamily project in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the Bronx. The loan will finance ground-up construction for the two-building, 515,000-square-foot development at 355 Exterior Street. The project will consist of connected 40-story and 26-story buildings. The development will include nearly 200 parking spaces, more than 11,000 square feet of retail space and residential amenities such as an outdoor pool, outdoor terrace, a gym and a pickleball court. At least 25 percent of the units will be affordable under the\nexpired 421a program\n. Landstone Capital arranged the 18-month whole-term loan, which includes two six-month extension options.\n\nWaterfront windfall | $287M | Williamsburg\nKKR Real Estate Credit\nprovided a $287 million loan to Douglaston Development and Corebridge Real Estate Investors for their luxury rental tower on the Williamsburg waterfront. The 41-story residential property at 1 North Fourth Place was built in 2015 and contains 509 units, and Douglaston has claimed it as the first high-rise rental project on the Williamsburg waterfront. The fresh financing replaced a $206 million loan from Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company.\nBronx booty | $201M | Concourse Village\nMerchants Capital\nprovided a $201 million loan to Arker Companies for 17 Bronx affordable housing developments. The fresh financing replaced a $178 million loan from Freddie Mac and the NYC Housing Development Corporation. The properties have 679 units and include 1041 Findlay Avenue, 1280 Sheridan Avenue and 1055 Findlay Avenue in Concourse Village.\nRentar refi | $160M | Middle Village\nDeutsche Bank and UBS\noriginated a $160 CMBS loan for Rentar Development\u2019s mixed-use plaza in Middle Village, which is in the midst of a retail overhaul. The fresh financing for Rentar Plaza at 66-26 Metropolitan Avenue replaced a $132 million loan backed by the complex. The three-story, 1.4 million-square-foot asset includes both retail and industrial space. The city is the property\u2019s largest industrial tenant, while BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club anchors the retail component.\n",

        "content": "There were 237 transactions totaling $368 million recorded in New York City over the 24 hours before 4:00 p.m. on Thursday, Sept. 25.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Residential:\nA Lincoln Square sponsor unit marked the top residential sale recorded in New York City.\nRobert Lourie\n, an executive at the hedge fund\nRenaissance Technologies,\nnabbed the unit\nat\nSJP Properties\u2019 200 Amsterdam Avenue\nfor $19.6 million. The four-bedroom residence spans about 4,700 square feet, pricing the deal at roughly $4,200 per square foot. Serhant\u2019s\nPeter Zaitzeff\nand\nJamie Hannon\nhad the listing. The unit has been on and off the market since at least 2019, when it was listed for $21 million.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded in the city was in Bushwick, where a one-story retail property at\n321 Starr Street\ntraded for $17.5 million. The buyer was an affiliate of\nYale Properties USA\n. The seller was a company tied to\nRichard Leibovitch\u2019s Arel Capital\n. The building spans 26,600 square feet. The deal pencils out to about $660 per square foot. The property last traded a decade ago for $9 million.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nIn Soho, a duplex penthouse at the landmarked building\n87 Mercer Street\nchanged hands for $17.4 million.\nJon and Ashley Venetos\n, founders of investment management firm Lurin, were the sellers of the unit, which has a two-level rooftop terrace. The four-bedroom pad has an outdoor wood-burning fireplace, outdoor kitchen, library and solarium. The transaction also included private storage space and a private gym in the lower level of the building. The unit has been on and off the market since 2017, when its asking price was just under $25 million. Its most recent asking price was just under $20 million. The buyer was an LLC.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Kammy Moalemzadeh\n, founder and managing partner of Arcadia Investment Partners, purchased a three-bedroom condo at\n25 Bond Street\nin Noho for $10.4 million. The seller was an LLC that had paid $8.7 million for the unit in 2013. The transaction appears to have been off-market.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nAn LLC tied to Beverly Hills-based hotelier\nEfrem Harkahm\npaid $8.9 million for a 62-unit, 75,000-square-foot apartment complex at\n263 Eastern Parkway\nin Crown Heights. The transaction comes out to almost $120 per square foot. The seller of the six-story building was\nMichelin Partners LLC\n, which has owned the complex since at least the 1970s.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nIn the Bronx, a retail property at\n3500 White Plains Road\ntraded for $8 million. The seller was\nCinquemani Partners LLC\n, which had owned the 10,000-square-foot building for decades. The buyer was a company managed by developer\nAziz Tareb.\nBy the Numbers:\nWhich U.S. county has the most pressured housing market?\nAmid a nationwide affordability crisis, Honolulu County in Hawaii stands out as the most cost-pressured housing market in the U.S.\nAttom\npulled third-quarter housing and income data for counties with at least 100,000 residents and at least 50 home sales. Among those 580 counties,\nThe Real Deal\nanalyzed the ones that are not only unaffordable but are also experiencing\nrapid housing price growth\n, along with a high volume of sales.\nThe typical homeowner in Honolulu County in the third quarter needed to spend 61.3 percent of their annual wages on the homeownership costs, which include property taxes, home insurance, mortgage payments and mortgage insurance. This placed the county among the top 8 percent.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "With no discussion, Chicago City Council passed a far-reaching anti-gentrification ordinance for Chicago\u2019s South Shore and Woodlawn neighborhoods Thursday evening, giving tenants the controversial right of first refusal to buy their buildings and establishing requirements for \u201cjust cause\u201d evictions when a building owner plans to sell.\nThe proposal, known as the Jackson Park Housing Pilot Ordinance, was led by 5th Ward Alderman Desmon Yancy and passed despite prior attempts to enact a similar measure stalling for nearly two years.\nIts similarities to another hotly-debated anti-gentrification effort, known as the\nNorthwest Housing Preservation Ordinance\n, prompted pushback from the real estate industry.\n\u201cThe Jackson Park Housing Pilot Ordinance contains hazardous housing policy that could deter much-needed investment, worsen the affordability crisis, and ultimately harm the very tenants it claims to help,\u201d said Jon Kozlowski, Government Affairs Director for the Chicagoland Apartment Association. \u201cThis updated proposal was rushed forward with little input from those who actually provide housing for working families and without careful scrutiny such a sweeping measure deserves.\u201d\nThe new version of the ordinance includes some key differences that are helpful to the real estate industry and others that are not.\nLosses for the industry:\nThe new ordinance gives tenants the right of first refusal to purchase properties when their landlords look to sell, which was a feature of the\nNorthwest anti-gentrification effort\nthat has been sharply criticized by the industry for\nhampering multifamily properties\u2019 resale values\n.\nTenants have a longer timeline to close on a building purchase under the new version of the ordinance\u2019s right of first refusal provision. Instead of being given 120 days to close, tenants are given 180 days to close.\nWins for the industry:\n\nThe new ordinance limits the right of first refusal to buildings with 10 or more units.\nThe original ordinance stated that landlords in South Shore could not evict tenants for any reason other than \u201cjust cause,\u201d which is defined as a breach of a lease agreement or illegal activity. The new ordinance only places that restriction on landlords while they are trying to sell a building, presumably to stop a landlord from evicting tenants before they have time to form a tenants union.\nThe new ordinance removes a provision that states landlords must reimburse the city for relocation assistance provided to tenants under certain circumstances.\nThe new ordinance does not place limits on lease application fees and other moving fees charged by landlords.\nDuring a committee meeting to discuss the ordinance\nheld Wednesday\n, aldermen expressed support for the measure, citing the impending opening of the Obama Presidential Library as a harbinger of change. Johnson echoed those statements after the full council meeting.\n\u201cThis ordinance is a meaningful step in our mission to grow our city\u2019s housing supply while\nincreasing affordability in our neighborhoods,\u201d Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a Sept. 25 statement.\nMedian rent in the pilot area since 2015 has increased by 43 percent, while home values have risen by 130 percent, according to the city.\nOther provisions in the ordinance increased funding for initiatives like property tax debt relief and programs aimed at reducing costs of rehabilitating residential properties.\nChicago City Council\u2019s Committee on Housing and Real Estate voted unanimously to approve the South Shore ordinance Wednesday, in a process that industry lobbying group Neighborhood Building Owners Alliance of Chicago accused of being rushed through the system because it was posted publicly for the first time the day before the committee meeting, which was also during the Jewish high holiday Rosh Hashanah.",

        "content": "Homes on Lake Geneva\u2019s waterfront are selling at gold-medal speed, as two more mansions priced north of $8 million traded in recent weeks.\nThe Wisconsin resort town is forecasting a record year for its most exclusive stretch of shoreline.\nFour lakefront homes have closed at $8 million and up this year, with three more under contract,\naccording\nto Crain\u2019s. Four homes hit that price point last year, including the $22 million sale of the storied\nAloha Lodge\n.\nThe latest deals underscore just how fast buyers are snapping up lakefront inventory. A five-bedroom, 7,500-square-foot home at\n835 Bayview Drive\nhit the \u201ccoming soon\u201d section of listings Sept. 13 with for $8.5 million, or about $1,130 per square foot. A contract was signed Sept. 22, listing agent Gina Nocek of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate told the outlet.\nFive showings occurred soon after the listing, and multiple offers came through, she said. Nocek would not disclose the contract price, but the speed suggests buyers bid up.\nAnother home is right behind it: a new-construction, 7,800-square-foot, eight-bedroom house on Lake Shore Drive with an asking price just under $10 million, or $1,282 per square foot. David Curry of Geneva Lakefront Realty, who\u2019s marketing the property, said it\u2019s already drawing strong interest ahead of showings.\n\u201cThe momentum in this market is out of control right now,\u201d Curry told the outlet.\n\nIn late August\ntwo lakefront homes\nwere listed for nearly $10 million each, located at 620 South Lake Shore Drive and N2224 Bonnie Brae Lane. Those properties \u2014 along with 835 Bayview Drive \u2014 were rare public listings for the hot market and would rank among the priciest homes sold in high-end Wisconsin getaway this year at that price.\nRecent trades highlight the frenzy. A mansion that sold in June fetched $20 million after only three days on the market. In August, another closed for $10.1 million in an\nunsolicited deal\nstruck directly between buyer and seller. The price worked out to $1,442 per square foot.\nWhile brokers cite stock market gains and wealthy buyers\u2019 indifference to high borrowing costs, Curry added another driver: FOMO (fear of missing out).\nFor more than a century, Lake Geneva has been the summer playground of Chicago\u2019s elite. But even seasoned brokers say the pace of today\u2019s trophy-home market is unprecedented.\n\u201cFive years ago, you\u2019d have been out of your mind to build a $9 million spec house. Now it makes sense,\u201d Curry said.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "After a series of delays and contentious debates, Chicago City Council passed a citywide ordinance allowing accessory dwelling units \u2014 also known as granny flats \u2014 with\nmore restrictions\nthan housing advocates would have liked.\nAn original version of the ordinance would have allowed ADUs throughout most of the city with few barriers to the approval process. But a debate about aldermanic control over individual\nADU proposals\nturned into a year-long stalemate.\nAs a compromise, the ordinance approved Thursday bans detached units in low-density districts unless a local alderman opts in. Even then, construction will be capped at one to three ADUs per block, depending on zoning. Detached houses that add an ADU must be owner-occupied. For multi-unit districts, ADUs will be allowed by right.\nStill aldermen, industry groups and the mayor celebrated the outcome.\n\u201cThis ordinance offers a practical, balanced solution that supports both renters and the long-term health of Chicago\u2019s housing market,\u201d said Michael Mini of the Chicagoland Apartment Association. \u201cOur collective efforts should prioritize developing more housing options, particularly housing that is affordable to local residents who need them most.\u201d\nAldermen Marty Quinn\u2019s union-backed amendment requiring contractors to hire through certified apprentice programs for new construction also remained attached to the new ordinance. The Chicago Federation of Labor and building trades had pressed hard for the measure, warning they would sink the ordinance otherwise.\n\u201cI feel this revised ordinance better represents Chicago\u2019s values by lifting up our labor unions and workers,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cChicago is a union town, and including our labor unions in this process was critical.\u201d\n\nThe legislation also scrapped a 700-square-foot size cap on coach houses but maintains a 22-foot height limit and other spacing rules.\nAlderman Bennett Lawson, who originally proposed the ordinance, had pushed for a broader legalization effort, framing\nADUs as a way to chip away\nat Chicago\u2019s estimated 120,000-unit affordable housing shortage by creating unsubsidized, naturally occurring affordable units.\nLawson said the new version of the ordinance should still help the city\u2019s housing needs.\n\u201cThis is something that is very impactful,\u201d he said \u201cIt will bring hundreds of new units, hopefully a year, but in ways that you may not even notice in a neighborhood.\u201d\nQuinn and his allies, however, leveraged organized labor\u2019s support to force concessions, arguing aldermen must retain veto power over zoning changes in their wards. The compromise underscores the council\u2019s long-standing practice of \u201caldermanic prerogative.\u201d\nProgressives, including Mayor Brandon Johnson, had championed ADUs as a modest but citywide affordability fix.\n\u201cBy expanding ADUs to communities across the city, we are increasing housing availability and driving sustainable neighborhood investment,\u201d Johnson said.",

        "content": "JPI is thinking outside the financing playbook in Denton, where it\u2019s building a $132 million apartment community with the help of tax-exempt municipal bonds.\nThe prolific Dallas-based multifamily builder started construction in June on the 461-unit\u00a0 development at North Bonnie Brae Street and Bronco Way, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. The project is JPI\u2019s first bond-financed, public-private partnership, structured through the Denton Housing Authority, which owns the land. Berkadia Affordable Housing arranged the municipal bond financing, while\nJPI\nis overseeing development, construction and asset management.\nThe unusual funding model provided a way to deliver workforce housing while sidestepping traditional capital markets, JPI CEO Payton Mayes said. While not common in Texas, bond-funded development occasionally\npops up\nin other corners of the country.\n\u201cThe capital markets have been challenging over the past few years, but this was another tool in our tool chest that we could really bring value to the municipalities,\u201d Mayes told the outlet.\nJPI is in talks with other municipalities about replicating the model, Mayes said, suggesting\nbond-backed\nworkforce housing deals could become a more common fixture in Texas development.\n\u201cAs more municipalities kind of get to understand the structure \u2026 we think that more and more municipalities will favor this over some alternatives,\u201d Mayes told the outlet.\n\nDenton Housing Authority is projected to receive $35 million in equity from the deal over the first decade.\nHalf of the units will be designated affordable: 35 percent for households earning up to 80 percent of area median income, 10 percent at 60 percent AMI, and 5 percent at 50 percent AMI. The balance will be market-rate apartments. The first deliveries are slated for next fall, with full completion in the first half of 2027.\nElsewhere in Denton, Holt Lunsford\u2019s multifamily arm HL Communities is developing workforce\nhousing\ntargeting hospital workers near Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital and Texas Woman\u2019s University.\nJPI has seven active projects under construction across DFW, including a $100 million community in Haltom City and the $80 million Jefferson Ridglea Village in Fort Worth.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A historic Dallas listing aims to capture the momentum of upcoming projects meant to revitalize downtown Dallas.\nTanya Ragan\u2019s Wildcat Management is selling the Purse Building, a six-story, 75,000-square-foot landmark at 601 Elm Street that was once home to Purse &amp; Company Wholesale Furniture.\nThe brick building constructed in 1905 was used by the FBI as an investigative command center after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in nearby Dealey Plaza. It\u2019s on the National Register of Historic Place and is approved for state and federal historic tax credits as well as the city\u2019s 10-year historic tax abatement.\nWhen Ragan bought it in 2017, it had been vacant for decades. She began rehabbing the Purse Building by removing the outdated carpet and drop ceilings to reveal the building\u2019s original pine floors and timber beams. She originally planned to lease it to an office user, put in a rooftop deck and ground-level retail. At one point, she considered converting the building into a hotel.\nThe property could be transformed into \u201cmultifamily or condo development, creative office, or a flagship destination for a single use,\u201d per the marketing materials.\nThe property is \u201can irreplaceable piece of Dallas history,\u201d Ragan said.\n\nRagan, an advocate for the revitalization of downtown Dallas, got her start in oil and gas leasing. She specializes in adaptive reuse and helped with the redevelopment of the Dallas Farmers Market from a collection of old warehouses into a vibrant mixed-use district with a daily market.\nThe Purse Building listing reflects the challenges real estate operators are facing downtown Dallas, which has lost much of its luster to Uptown. Following the \u201cflight-to-quality\u201d office trend, countless companies have relocated from downtown to new trophy buildings across Klyde Warren Park.\nDowntown is also at risk of\nlosing AT&amp;T headquarters\n, with the telecommunications giant scouting a new location in the suburbs. AT&amp;T currently occupies Whitacre Tower, also known as One AT&amp;T Plaza. In addition,\nthe Neiman Marcus flagship store\n, a downtown landmark, hangs in the balance after a groundswell of support delayed the closure of the beloved store this spring.\nDallas\u2019 central business district struggled under the weight of excess older office space, which brings the area\u2019s office vacancy to nearly 35 percent, compared to the overall market, where vacancy is 25.3 percent, according to a recent report from Partners Real Estate.\nConverting obsolete buildings to other uses provided a much-hyped solution to the glut of office space, but making those projects pencil is a challenge.\nDespite the area\u2019s office market woes, the city is embarking on a $3.5 billion revamp of the Kay Bailey Hutchinson Convention Center. Meanwhile, Hunt Realty is planning a $5 billion redevelopment of Reunion Tower. Both projects would unfold within blocks of the Purse Building.",

        "content": "Developer Neighborlee Living, led by Kurt Jetta, won approval from Palm Beach County for a four-story, 38-unit affordable multifamily project with micro-units as small as 240 square feet.\nThe county commission greenlit the project, dubbed Neighborlee Living Westgate, at a zoning hearing on Thursday. Slated for the 0.7-acre site at 2818 Westgate Avenue, the project is in unincorporated Palm Beach County near\nWest Palm Beach\n, in an area zoned for growth governed by the Westgate Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA).\nJetta said his target renter for the project is recent college graduates.\nMicro-units are a growing segment of the pipeline for planned apartments nationwide. In April, Lyle Stern and Kerry Newman proposed a 400-unit Live Local Act project in Miami\u2019s Allapattah neighborhood that will\ninclude 40 micro-units\n. Proponents see the small scale of the units as an answer to the affordability crunch facing cities around the country. In Seattle, 66 percent of the city\u2019s planned apartments are micro-units,\nMultifamily Dive\nreported in June.\nNeighborlee Living Westgate will have 26\nmicro-units\nspanning 240 square feet, 10 studios spanning 360 square feet and two one-bedroom units spanning 538 square feet. The majority of the units are set aside for renters earning between 60 percent and 80 percent of Palm Beach County\u2019s area median income (AMI), which is $104,000 as of 2024.\nAccording to Neighborlee\u2019s website, micro-units will rent for $1,200 per month, studios for $1,600, and one-bedrooms for $2,000. The studios and one-bedroom units also will come with a $250 per month voucher for childcare costs, the developer confirmed.\n\nWest Palm Beach has\nthousands of residential units\nin the pipeline, but the majority target a luxury demographic. Related Ross\u2019 322-unit apartment tower,\nthe Laurel\n, opened last year, and one-bedroom rents start at $3,500, according to its website.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been wired to pay attention to the people making $50,000 and below,\u201d Jetta said. \u201cI just felt like they were underserved and misunderstood.\u201d\nHe also pointed out that revenue per square foot is significantly higher in micro-units than in traditional units. Still, he said it\u2019s difficult to pencil out the math of developing affordable projects.\n\u201cWe were taken aback by the costs [of construction],\u201d he said.\nThe Westgate micro-unit project is Jetta\u2019s first development in Palm Beach County. Following his approval, he said he has a new understanding of how the process slows down much needed growth in the housing pipeline.\n\u201cWe never ran into some cumbersome regulation,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s well-meaning, everybody\u2019s doing their job, but still, you don\u2019t get the affordable housing output people want to see.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The owners of a nine-story building known as Pasadena Office Tower face foreclosure in the wake of a notice of default on $40 million debt and election to sell that was recorded earlier this month.\nThe commercial mortgage-backed securities loan connected to the office building at 150 South Los Robles Avenue earlier landed in special servicing, with default considered likely and imminent. Borrowers acknowledged they would be unable to pay off the loan prior to maturity, blaming \u201ctenant flight to higher quality space, reduced office demand and inflationary pressures,\u201d according to servicer commentary via Morningstar Credit.\nThe owners, two entities connected to Albert Taban and Michael Pashaie, managing partners at Jade Enterprises and Golden West Properties, saw the property\u2019s\nvalue\nslashed by more than half as tenants fled. The offices were recently appraised at $23 million compared to $57 million at loan issuance in May 2015, per Morningstar.\n\nThat means the 142,000-square-foot property is worth less than the debt connected to it, which the landlords have defaulted on, but still worth around a million dollars more than what it was purchased for in 2002. Taban and Pashaie did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe offices, which were built in the 1970s, are 69 percent occupied compared to 93 percent occupancy at underwriting 10 years ago. The five largest leases combine to account for 39 percent of the space, and include the city of Pasadena, a California Department of Rehabilitation and the Pasadena Community Access Corporation. The three entities\u2019 leases are set to expire before the end of 2027.\nPasadena offices are not seeing the sort of post-pandemic revival that has lifted submarkets such as Century City on the Westside of Los Angeles, where newer, amenity-laden properties are billed as ways to lure workers back to their desks. Buildings in Pasadena, meanwhile, are generally selling at discounts. An office building at 790 East Colorado Boulevard recently\nsold\nfor $31.5 million \u2014 it was previously purchased for $59 million. An office complex at 55 South Lake Avenue and 800 East Colorado Boulevard\nsold\nfor $120 million compared to its $256 million previous price.\n",

Lawrence Davis\u2019 firm is planning a 304-unit project at 350 Grand Concourse in Mott Haven, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Shorewood applied with the Department of City Planning nine months after acquiring the site for $28.5 million.\nThe 14-story, 244,000-square-foot development would be a mixed-use building, including a grocery store, which would span 40,000 square feet. Food Bazaar is the prospective tenant for the store. Plans also call for a 60-car parking garage.\nShorewood intends to utilize the 485x program, meaning 25 percent of the units would be set aside for affordable housing; in this case, they would be for families earning up to 60 percent of the area median income, on average.\nIn terms of the subsidy, Davis said rents would be pegged to \u201csupport the higher construction costs associated with the $40-an-hour wage,\u201d eschewing concerns about the wage floor\nattached to the 485x property tax abatement\n.\n\nThe firm projects the development will cost $175 million. It plans to begin construction in the first quarter and wrap in the first half of 2028.\nShorewood has more than 1000 residential units in its pipeline, along with prominent projects in Brooklyn and Queens. The firm was\nsued\nby tenants at 1 Archer Avenue in Jamaica at the start of the year, accused of manipulating rent concessions to dodge the requirements tied to the now-expired 421a tax program.\nAs for Mott Haven, it\u2019s one of the hottest development spots in all of New York City. This summer, Scale Lending provided the Beitel Group with\na $305 million loan\nfor a 755-unit development in the South Bronx neighborhood.\nScale previously\nprovided $150 million\nto Beitel for a 450-unit multifamily project at 120 East 144th Street in Mott Haven. RXR and Brookfield are also among the significant names to get involved in the neighborhood.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The newly named Christie\u2019s International Real Estate First Coast, led by founder Corey Hastings, has 130 agents and focuses on the Jacksonville metropolitan area, the release shows.\nHastings, a former Ohio University football player, is\none of many NFL hopefuls who pivoted to real estate\nafter leaving the league.

First Coast falls under the Compass umbrella of brands, via Compass\u2019\n$444 acquisition\nof @properties and Christie\u2019s last year.\nConsolidation is on the rise across the industry, and brokerages have been jockeying for more territory in Florida since the state\u2019s pandemic market boom.

The residential component will join a fitness club that has partially filled a one-time\nMacy\u2019s\ndepartment store, various smaller retail shops, a 26-story Sheraton hotel, and 33 floors of office space that already comprise The Bloc.\nThe project will proceed under the guidance of the firm\u2019s CEO, Jerry Kanne, who comes to the rough-and-tumble world of real estate development via the Peace Corps. The Iowa native didn\u2019t go directly from do-gooder duty to development, though\n\u2014\nhe did some lumber trading, got his undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Iowa, worked for the Washington, D.C. law firm of Arnold &amp; Porter, and then cofounded Counts &amp; Kanne.\nKanne, who didn\u2019t respond to an inquiry for this piece, eventually landed with the parent of National Real Estate, which has about $4 billion in assets under management and is best known for its multifamily and office development. That was 38 years ago, and he has spanned various aspects of real estate development since.\nIn 2000, multi-billion-dollar pension fund National Electrical Benefit Fund formed an investment team to invest in real estate projects and Kanne ran its in-house real estate operations. In 2010, National Electrical Benefit Fund established National Real Estate Advisors as a subsidiary to manage real estate investments for pension funds and other institutional investors.\nUnder his leadership, National Real Estate Advisors formed a joint venture with\nCatalyst Healthcare Real Estate\nin November 2021 to focus on strategic capital investments in health care real estate. They paid $420 million to acquire and recapitalize two multistate health care portfolios by January 2022,\nCitybiz\nreported.\nThat deal \u201cnot only significantly scales our medical office portfolio, but furthers National\u2019s geographic diversification,\u201d Kanne said at the time.\n\nNational Real Estate, which is co-developing the 2,000-apartment mixed-use project The Stacks in Washington, D.C., has also made significant investments in the data center space. Through a joint venture with Sabey Corporation, Sabey Data Centers has a portfolio of more than 4 million square feet of efficient multitenant data centers. The firm has raised $1.2 billion to invest in data centers, the\nWashington Business Journal\nsaid.\nThe Bloc\nThe project in Downtown Los Angeles brings the development firmly back to the multifamily sector in a big and splashy way. The 41-story residential tower will be among the tallest buildings on the city\u2019s skyline at 710 feet, a status made possible because it starts atop an existing parking structure. The development\u2019s 466 apartments would include a mix of studio, one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments. Also on tape is a sculpted glass rooftop with an open-air amenity deck. A swimming pool, fitness center and lawn are planned.\nCalifornia-based The Ratkovich Company acquired the 2.4-million-square-foot site that was then called Macy\u2019s Plaza in 2013 for\n$241 million\n, according to the Los Angeles Times, and commenced plans for a $180 million transformation. Five years later, Ratkovich\nsold its interest\nto National Real Estate, its financial partner.\nAt the time, Kanne told the Times: \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to build a residential tower on top of the parking garage. Maybe 40 stories.\u201d\nThe recent approval from the City Council means he\u2019s positioned to make good on that hope\n\u2014\nalthough the developer will put in some some extras for the city\nNational Real Estate will make a nearly $16.8 million public benefits payment for a transfer of development rights from the Los Angeles Convention Center, with funds allocated for unspecified public amenities, affordable housing, and street lighting repair.\n",

Along with nine fireplaces, a wine cellar, a creek in the yard and a wedding-ready pavilion with a catering kitchen, amenities include a soundproof theater that can accommodate 20 viewers. Ann Shaw of Briggs Freeman Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has the listing.\nThe asking price amounts to $1,571 per square foot.\nThe Mitchells founded Cinemark in 1984, and Lee Roy led the company until 2022. They\u2019ve owned the house at 9769 Audubon Place since building it in 1995.\n\nThe six-bedroom, 12-bathroom home spans 14,000 square feet and sits on a 3.4-acre lot . The pavilion is 2,500 square feet. The property\u2019s taxable value is $11.8 million, a little more than half of the asking price.\nIt\u2019s the most-expensive residential listing in Texas this month, and also the biggest of the top 10 listings, according to the Houston Association of Realtors. The second-priciest property listed this month is 6 miles away at 3612 Crescent Avenue in Highland Park, an 11,000-square-foot home marketed by Compass for $18.5 million. That\u2019s $1,682 per square foot.\nThe luxury market tends to\nfly above economic turbulence\n, especially in Dallas, the\nultra-luxury capital of Texas\n. Austin has been a\nnotable exception\nthis year, with price cuts and rising inventory as its\nrelationship to the tech industry\nfrays.

Neither Zillow nor Dallas County records indicate that a contract has been signed.\nA Southlake mansion that was originally listed for $27.5 million, one of the most expensive listings in Texas last year,\nrecently sold at auction for $14.22 million\n, less than the suggested starting bid.",

        "content": "Media rooms aren\u2019t rare in ultra-luxury homes, but few were built by movie theater magnates.\nCinemark founders Lee Roy Mitchell and his wife, Tandy, are asking $22 million for his Preston Hollow property at 9769 Audubon Place. Along with nine fireplaces, a wine cellar, a creek in the yard and a wedding-ready pavilion with a catering kitchen, amenities include a soundproof theater that can accommodate 20 viewers. Ann Shaw of Briggs Freeman Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has the listing.\nThe asking price amounts to $1,571 per square foot.\nThe Mitchells founded Cinemark in 1984, and Lee Roy led the company until 2022. They\u2019ve owned the house at 9769 Audubon Place since building it in 1995.\n\nThe six-bedroom, 12-bathroom home spans 14,000 square feet and sits on a 3.4-acre lot . The pavilion is 2,500 square feet. The property\u2019s taxable value is $11.8 million, a little more than half of the asking price.\nIt\u2019s the most-expensive residential listing in Texas this month, and also the biggest of the top 10 listings, according to the Houston Association of Realtors. The second-priciest property listed this month is 6 miles away at 3612 Crescent Avenue in Highland Park, an 11,000-square-foot home marketed by Compass for $18.5 million. That\u2019s $1,682 per square foot.\nThe luxury market tends to\nfly above economic turbulence\n, especially in Dallas, the\nultra-luxury capital of Texas\n. Austin has been a\nnotable exception\nthis year, with price cuts and rising inventory as its\nrelationship to the tech industry\nfrays. In Dallas, Plano and Irving, however, luxury home prices have risen at about the same rate that starter and mid-tier homes have fallen this year, according to First American Data &amp; Analytics.\nAnother Preston Hollow home\nlisted for $28.5 million earlier this month\nbut was taken off the market after less than two weeks, according to Zillow. Neither Zillow nor Dallas County records indicate that a contract has been signed.\nA Southlake mansion that was originally listed for $27.5 million, one of the most expensive listings in Texas last year,\nrecently sold at auction for $14.22 million\n, less than the suggested starting bid.",

During a debate on Sunday, according to\nGothamist\n, real estate took the spotlight during a critical moment.\nWhen asked about lowering rents, Sherrill retorted that her opponent was \u201cnot going to do anything about it because one of his biggest donors is actually being taken to court and sued on this very issue.\u201d\nThe oblique reference was about Jeff Kurtz\u2019s Kamson Corporation, one of 10 landlords being sued by the state alongside RealPage for the use of rent-setting algorithms, which the state argues is collusive.\nKurtz justified the use of the algorithm and Kamson was part of a motion in July to dismiss the state\u2019s lawsuit.\nThe Kurtzes have contributed more than $750,000 to Ciattarelli\u2019s campaigns since 2021, including multiple runs for the governorship. In June, they provided a $200,000 contribution to a political action committee attacking Sherrill.\n\nKamson owns and operates more than 10,000 units across the state. It drew scrutiny two years ago when two small children were killed in a fire at a Kamson complex.\nCiatarelli\u2019s campaign has brought in more than $250,000 from the real industry. Sherrill\u2019s campaign, meanwhile, has landed more than $100,000 in donations from the industry, counting developers Steven Plofker and Chris Yegen among her base.\nNeither candidate commented to Gothamist on the contributions.\nOn the policy front, Sherrill\u2019s real estate focus is on going after negligent landlords and cracking down on drastic rent increases tied to software use. Ciattarelli wants to lower property taxes and energy costs to improve affordability.\nAn Emerson College Polling/PIX11/The Hill survey\nreleased\non Thursday put the race between the two candidates at a dead heat.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The Miami City Commission finalized a controversial deal to transfer ownership of the historic Olympia Theater in downtown Miami to a charter school company co-founded by rapper Pitbull, whose real name is Armando Christian Perez.\nOn Thursday, city commissioners voted unanimously, 5-0, to sell the\n1926 landmark\nand its adjacent 10-story office building to Sports Leadership Arts Management, or SLAM, for just $10. In exchange,\nPitbull\u2019s\nSLAM pledged to invest a minimum of $57 million into restoring the deteriorating venue\u2019s interior performance space and seating area, with an additional $20 million budgeted for renovations to the theater\u2019s upper floors.\n\u201cThis is the best of both worlds,\u201d said commissioner Joe Carollo. \u201cThey\u2019re putting the money to upgrade the whole building, and we\u2019ll still have the Olympia Theater.\u201d\nOpened in 1926 as a silent movie palace, the Olympia Theater has long been considered a crown jewel of downtown Miami\u2019s\nFlagler Street\n. Designed by John Eberson and renovated decades later by Morris Lapidus, the theater was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It has hosted cultural icons including B.B. King, Luciano Pavarotti and Etta James.\nThe property\u2019s condition, however, has worsened in recent years. Leaks, structural damage and outdated systems have left the building in disrepair, city records show. Required upgrades in the SLAM agreement include reconstructing dressing and crew rooms, repairing water-damaged decorative plaster, retrofitting mechanical systems and restoring the marquee, fa\u00e7ade, roof and ticket booth.\nThe sale also resolves an ongoing legal dispute with the heirs of Maurice Gusman, the late developer who rescued the property from demolition in the 1970s. In 2019, his family sued the city for allegedly violating a covenant involving its management of the theater via the semiautonomous Miami Parking Authority. Under the SLAM deal, the city and the\nGusman family\nwill settle the lawsuit if SLAM restores the property within five years of receiving building permits.\n\nSLAM, which operates several\ncharter schools\nin South Florida, plans to open Miami Tech at Mater Innovation Academy within the Olympia Theater complex. The campus would likely partner with Miami Dade College for dual enrollment programs, and the building would be renamed the Miami Innovation &amp; Arts Academy. SLAM must also host programming that is available to the general public for at least 180 days of the year.\nDozens of charter school employees and parents whose children attend SLAM-affiliated schools spoke in favor of the agreement during the public comment portion of the city commission meeting.\n\u201cOlympia is an iconic landmark that must be preserved,\u201d said SLAM co-founder and CEO Millie Sanchez. \u201cOur proposal saves the Olympia Theater, and it saves the city and its taxpayers from bearing that cost. The Gusman family, the original benefactor, supports this plan.\u201d\nHowever, dozens of city residents spoke against giving Olympia Theater away to SLAM. Longtime Miami activist Elvis Cruz said the city was prioritizing its own convenience over residents\u2019 concerns.\n\u201cOver 45 years of civic activism I have learned the city of Miami loves to do things for its own comfort and convenience, even if it causes discomfort and inconvenience for residents,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cDon\u2019t sell the Olympia Theater. Please restore it.\u201d\nAnother activist, Sandy Moise, criticized city leaders for ramming the agreement through. \u201cCity officials have been acting like lobbyists,\u201d Moise said. \u201cWhat we are closer to is giving away one of Miami\u2019s greatest public treasures in a backroom deal that does not reflect the will or the best interests of the people.\u201d",

        "content": "Joe Mansueto is in the clear to start construction on a 22,000-seat soccer stadium for Chicago Fire FC at Related Midwest\u2019s megadevelopment The 78.\nThe Chicago City Council gave final approval for the plans this week, meaning dirt can start moving to meet the soccer club\u2019s goal of having the project finished in time for Major League Soccer\u2019s 2028 season, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. The stadium was previously reported to be a $650 million investment by\nMansueto\n, but recent reports pegged it at $750 million. It\u2019s unclear what has caused the discrepancy. The zoning amendment needed to allow the stadium to be built passed unanimously.\nThe\nprivately-funded stadium\nwill anchor Related Midwest\u2019s 62-acre South Loop megaproject. The 78 is expected to be an $8 billion mixed-use campus along the South Branch of the Chicago River, currently a vacant swath of riverfront land between Roosevelt Road and Ping Tom Memorial Park in Chinatown.\nThe soccer team agreed to cap major events at the stadium to 45 per year, including the Fire\u2019s 17 home games per season. Building a dedicated soccer stadium would enable the team to control its own schedule, create a more intimate fan experience,and host a range of events throughout the year. The team has experienced years of frustration sharing Soldier Field with the\nChicago Bears\n.\n\nAbout 5,000 apartment units are part of Related Midwest\u2019s plans around the stadium, along with over a mile of bike trails, 3 acres of sports fields, public parking and a water taxi stop along the 1,400 feet of riverfront.\nFirst proposed in 2019, Related Midwest\u2019s redevelopment agreement called for the developer to spend $551 million on rebuilding local transportation infrastructure for the site, which was to include a CTA Red Line stop and adjustment of nearby Metra train tracks. Tax increment financing would then be used to reimburse the developer.\nLast week Curt Bailey, president of Related Midwest, told the Chicago Plan Commission that the 2019 plan was no longer needed and had become too costly. A new proposal would scrap the realignment of Metra tracks and the Red Line station, Bailey said. The 2019 agreement is expected to be\nrenegotiated\n, according to Ciere Boatright, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Planning and Development.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Other clothing giants like\nMacy\u2019s\nand\nBloomingdale\u2019s\nfled the city and shut down their flagship locations.\nThe timing for Uniqlo\u2019s return feels right, company officials said. The company is getting close to confirming a location and considers San Francisco an important market, said Tomo Yasuda, Uniqlo\u2019s North America real estate director.\n\nYasuda and other Uniqlo bigwigs met with Mayor Daniel Lurie and his staff this summer. Uniqlo reportedly was looking to discuss how the company could \u201cpartner with the city to rejuvenate the city and have a successful opening.\u201d Uniqlo also sought to discuss \u201ccommitments to making the downtown better\u201d and how to \u201chelp to speed up our permitting process.\u201d\nWhile the location of the new Uniqlo outpost hasn\u2019t been confirmed, a representative for investment firm Pontegadea said earlier this year that it was \u201cworking on a lease with Uniqlo for Pac Place.\u201d The Pacific Place building, at 801 Market Street, is owned by Pontegadea and was formerly occupied by Old Navy before it closed in 2023.\nUniqlo\u2019s comeback in San Francisco would mark a major step in the company\u2019s post-pandemic growth, though it wouldn\u2019t be the only store location in the Bay Area. The\nStonestown Galleria mall\nhas had a Uniqlo location since 2013. An Emeryville location also opened that same year.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

But the judge sided with Core, pointing to a memorandum of understanding the parties drafted last year that restructured payment terms.\nShvo never signed the document, but Masley found the club had shown \u201cgood faith\u201d by paying rent in line with its modified obligations. The judge ordered Core to keep paying under the terms of its 2021 lease and barred Shvo from taking steps to evict.\n\nShvo\u2019s camp took the ruling as a win, emphasizing that the court affirmed Core still needs to abide by its original lease. An attorney for Core framed the decision as shutting down a \u201cbaseless eviction attempt\u201d and said the club will continue pressing for damages tied to what it describes as Shvo\u2019s \u201cegregious misconduct.\u201d\nCore, which relocated to Fifth Avenue in 2022 from East 55th Street, has roughly 1,500 members paying upward of $10,000 annually. Court filings show it pulled in $25 million of revenue last year with net income of $2.7 million. But the glossy brand has traded insults with its landlord, accusing Shvo of neglecting basic building services, from cold showers to clogged toilets.\nThe two sides are entangled in other disputes, including a separate judgment that Core owes Shvo $1 million on an old loan.\nMeanwhile, Shvo faces pressure of his own. Sales have reportedly stalled at his Miami Beach condo project, putting his ownership in jeopardy, and he\u2019s separately\nweighing bulk sales\nof units at the Mandarin Oriental residences on Fifth.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Compass touted unity among the 340,000 real estate professionals it would add under its umbrella by acquiring Anywhere Real Estate, but Texas brokers aren\u2019t clear on how the move will change the game.\nThe move followed another blockbuster deal. Last year, Compass agreed to acquire Chicago-born @properties for a stunning $444 million. The deal for its competitor in the market built on their first- and second-place spots in the brokerage scene and secured Compass\u2019 foothold. If the merger with Anywhere goes through next year, brands affiliated with Compass will account for most of the sales volume of the\ntop 20 brokerages in Chicago\n, according to an analysis of last year\u2019s sales.\nNorth Texas is a more varied market. The top 20 brokerages in the Metroplex charted $37.9 billion in volume last year. Compass and the brands that it will absorb completed $12.39 billion altogether, meaning that Compass stands to gain about a third of the market share in North Texas. Other brokerages completed $25.55 billion in volume.\nColdwell Banker Apex, Coldwell Banker Realty, Briggs Freeman Sotheby\u2019s International Real Estate, Century 21 Mike Bowman and Century 21 Judge Fite are the top North Texas brokerages that operate under the Anywhere brand. With Compass, their combined volume of $12.4 billion would dwarf the No. 1 brokerage, Berkshire Hathaway-owned Ebby Halliday Real Estate, which completed $5.84 billion.\nA caveat: Coldwell Banker, Sotheby\u2019s International Real Estate and Century 21 are franchisors, so the local offices affiliated with their brand are independently operated. Compass owns its Dallas office, but Anywhere doesn\u2019t own the businesses that pay to use its brands, which compete with each other to varying degrees. The merger won\u2019t combine these businesses into one.\n\u201cWe have a franchise agreement with Anywhere, and that will stay in place for the long term,\u201d said Jim Fite, owner of Century 21 Judge Fite.\nA change in the guard doesn\u2019t make much difference in the day-to-day work of a franchisee, said Jerry Mooty Jr., CEO and broker of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate @properties Lone Star, which Compass also recently\nacquired\n.\n\u201cWe still report to the same Christie\u2019s leadership; if anything\u2019s happened, it\u2019s actually helped us on the recruiting side,\u201d Mooty said, adding that branding matters in the luxury world.\nChristie\u2019s brass told agents last year that the Compass name would boost prestige. Not all agents accepted the encouragement. Nancy Almodovar, founder of leading Houston luxury brokerage Nan &amp; Co, said her office was \u201c\nblindsided\n\u201d by Compass.\n\n\u201cI actually believe the consumer maybe even pays more attention to the brand of the individual agent than they do the company,\u201d argued Tommy Flood, head of the GO Network, the largest franchise in Keller Williams, which stands to become the second biggest brokerage in the country after the acquisition.\nFite said he doesn\u2019t expect his company or the Century 21 brand to be affected. His primary concern is data sharing.\n\u201cThe ownership of data is very important. I don\u2019t want my company data in the hands of my competitor, and I believe my franchise agreement prevents that,\u201d Fite said.\nCompass can collect \u201cagnostic data\u201d without violating franchise agreements using a multitenant technology structure that would protect each office\u2019s data, Mooty said.\n\u201cYou can build a technology stack on what\u2019s called a single-tenant model, where everybody plugs in and all that data is included in one big database. That\u2019s what Compass was originally when it was just Compass,\u201d Mooty said. For franchises, though, \u201cthere might be some agnostic data or whatever the word is \u2014 it\u2019s not identifiable data \u2014 that might pool up to where you get a bigger picture of the real estate market.\u201d\nCompass ranked second among North Texas brokerages last year in TRD Data, and Century 21 Judge Fite ranked 11th with $1.3 billion in volume. The nearest competitor to Compass under the Anywhere brand is Coldwell Banker Apex, which ranked fifth with $2.2 billion in volume.\n\u201cI think our presence is smaller in the more medium price range in the suburbs,\u201d said Michelle Wood, founding partner of the Detwiler+Wood Group, the highest-producing Compass team in the Dallas market.\nWhen asked if the acquisition might resolve any rivalries between brokerages, as it\u2019s expected to in\nMiami\n, Wood said that Anywhere brokerages \u201cdon\u2019t compete with us in the Dallas market.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Rithm Capital\u2019s\ndeal to buy\nParamount Group for $1.6 billion came as a bit of a surprise.\nAfter bids from Blackstone, SL Green and Empire State Realty Trust, it was Rithm, a lesser-known but still deep-pocketed asset manager with a focus on mortgage servicing, that came out on top.\nThe company is set to take on Paramount\u2019s 13 million square feet of office space in New York and San Francisco at a 40 percent discount to its book value.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very patient in the office sector, and we believe now is the right time to do so,\u201d said\u00a0 Rithm CEO Michael Nierenberg in a conference call with analysts on September 17.\nThe deal comes after Paramount and its long-time CEO Albert Behler have\nbeen in the news\nfor all the wrong reasons. Earlier this year, the company revealed it made millions of dollars in previously undisclosed payments to CEO Albert Behler\u2019s companies. Paramount also disclosed it is under an SEC investigation. Meanwhile, TRD further discovered that Behler gave a no-bid contract to a company tied to his ex-girlfriend.\nBut those days should soon be behind Paramount. Rithm\u2019s deal still requires shareholder approval, but is expected to close at the end of the year.\nParamount\u2019s sale is being closely scrutinized by analysts. It is among the first large-scale acquisitions of offices since the pandemic. And depending on who you talk to, either paints a positive picture of the New York office landscape or a dismal one for Paramount shareholders.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the deal:\nThe offer and other key numbers:\nRithm will pay: $6.60 per diluted share\nTotal offer amount: $1.6B\nParamount stock price, prior to Rithm\u2019s deal: $7.39\nParamount\u2019s highest stock price in last five years: $11.53\nParamount\u2019s portfolio:\nParamount\u2019s portfolio includes 13 owned and four managed office assets in New York City and San Francisco. About 8.7 million square feet of space is located in New York.\nOver 85 percent of the portfolio is leased as of June 2025 and annualized average rent is $90 per square foot, according to an investor presentation.\nIn New York, its buildings include: 1633 Broadway, 1301 Avenue of the Americas and 1325 Avenue of the Americas. In San Francisco, Paramount owns One Market Plaza, 300 Mission Street and One Front Street.\nWhy was Paramount put up for sale?\nParamount was facing pressure from shareholders and analysts over its high compensation to executives relative to its stock performance.\nIn early 2025, Paramount disclosed that it paid millions of dollars to Behler\u2019s outside companies or personal interests, including $3 million for a private jet firm Behler co-owned.\nA short time later, Paramount announced it was undergoing a strategic review and hired Bank of America as its financial advisor. The overall office market in New York had improved and investor appetite was growing. Paramount signed over 400,000 square feet of leases in the second quarter, its most in a quarter since 2019.\nBut despite the uptick in leasing, Paramount reported a net loss of $19.8 million for the second quarter, compared to $7.8 million a year prior. The losses included $7.5 million of expenses related to the acceleration of equity awards and severance payments.\nWho is Rithm?\n\nRithm was founded in 2013 as an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group with a focus on residential mortgage servicing under the name New Residential Investment.\nThe company internalized management and rebranded to Rithm in 2022. Since then, Rithm has gone on an acquisition spree. In 2023, Rithm acquired Sculptor Capital Management, which had $33 billion in assets under management. This month, Rithm inked a deal to buy Crestline Management, an alternative asset manager with $17 billion in assets.\nRithm now has $100 billion in investable assets. It lends across commercial and residential real estate.\nWhy did Rithm want to buy Paramount?\nRithm CEO Michael Nierenberg said on a call with analysts that the firm is seeking to diversify its investment strategies. Paramount presented a rare opportunity to acquire commercial real estate in gateway cities at a discount during a period when fundamentals are improving. Nierenberg repeatedly mentioned expected future rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. The cuts will lead to cap rate compression, allowing values to increase.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very bullish on office as we look at this so-called dislocated recovery trade or investment,\u201d said Nierenberg on the call.\nParamount\u2019s office towers are around 15 percent unoccupied with an additional 800,000 square feet of leases expiring in 2026, according to its investor presentation. Rithm can put in some upgrades, lease out the remaining space and hike rents, adding revenue to an existing portfolio.\n\u201cThis is\nan absolute value-add opportunity,\u201d said Dylan Burzinski, an analyst with Green Street Advisors, in an interview.\nRithm executives mentioned the deal will be balance sheet light in its call with analysts. In other words, the company will only use a portion of its own money to fund the deal and can raise money from co-investors and limited partners. Nierenberg said interest is already high. He added that Rithm could syndicate the whole deal if wanted to do so.\nRithm expects to 2x its investment.\nWhat does this mean for the NYC office market?\nRithm\u2019s offer could be looked at in one of two ways. It is either a huge testament to New York City\u2019s office recovery or a major disappointment for Paramount shareholders. Wall Street analysts covering Paramount have competing viewpoints.\nEvercore ISI analyst Steve Sakwa predicted Paramount was worth at least $7.58 a share and as much as $12, Crain\u2019s reported. Sakwa said Paramount shareholders may reject the offer based on the low offer.\nBut Dylan Burzinski, an analyst with Green Street, said Rithm\u2019s deal was in line with his team\u2019s expectations. He mentioned Rithm will likely have to put in a significant amount of money in capital improvements for Paramount\u2019s office buildings, which adds to the risk.\n\u201cThe public market just got a little bit ahead of itself in terms of where valuation would shake out,\u201d said Burzinski. \u201cThis is a very value-add portfolio.\u201d\nParamount claims to have a Class A portfolio. But the office market recovery has not spread across all office towers. Paramount\u2019s buildings are largely unrecognizable to most New Yorkers, most of which were built or redeveloped in the 1980s. It has no ultra-modern trophy asset like One Vanderbilt.\n\u201cWhat SL Green and Vornado [have] tends to be the best of the best in the New York City office. What Paramount has is good, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s as high of quality,\u201d said Burzinski.\nOverall, Burzinski said the reported interest in Paramount from big-name investors like SL Green, Vornado and Empire State Realty was a positive sign for the office market.\n\u201cOne year ago, I don\u2019t think you would have had that many buyers lined up wanting to take a look at this,\u201d said Burzinski. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good indicator that capital is looking more at office than in recent memory.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s next for Behler?\nIt seems hard to imagine Behler, who\u2019s been CEO of Paramount since 1991, will stay on when the deal closes. Most of the recent scrutiny surrounding Paramount stemmed from his cushy perks and unorthodox dealmaking. Rithm did not specifically mention Behler in its investor call. Nierenberg stressed that Paramount had a large management team.\nBut anything is possible. This is New York City real estate, crazier things have happened.\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s not actually called the Plumber Employment Act. But it should be.\nWhat other rationale could the City Council have for passing a bill on Thursday requiring a master plumber for basic installations of gas stoves and dryers?\nThe legislation could also be called the Keep Your Old Appliances Act.\nA basic rule of economics is that if you make something more expensive, you get less of it. Requiring a master plumber or specially qualified installers to put in a gas stove or dryer will add hundreds of dollars to the cost. As a result, landlords and homeowners will hold on to their old appliances longer.\nIf anything,\nIntro 429-A\nwill make New York more dangerous. Old gas stoves pollute indoor air and make people sick. Lint can build up in old dryers and vents, creating a fire hazard. The Council should be incentivizing replacement of old appliances, not discouraging them by dramatically raising installation costs.\nThe sponsor of the bill, Bronx Council member Pierina Ana Sanchez,\njustified it\nby pointing to an illegal gas hookup that led to an\nEast Village explosion\nin 2015.\nBut that tragedy was caused by amateurs running pipes from one building to another, not a standard stove or dryer installation that requires no piping to be moved. The city has already responded to the 2015 explosion by passing\nLocal Law 152\nof 2016, which mandates that multifamily buildings\u2019 gas pipes be checked by a master plumber every four years.\nSanchez\u2019s bill appears to drastically raise the usual $600 cost of those inspections by expanding them to include the point of connection to every gas appliance. It seems to me that instead of just popping in and out of the cellar, the master plumber would have to go into apartments and pull out every gas stove and dryer to check the connection.\nMy inquiry to Sanchez\u2019s office was not immediately answered.\nTo my knowledge, no tragedies have ever happened in New York City as a result of a standard stove or dryer replacement. These have generally been handled by a two-person crew that delivers appliances ordered from retailers such as PC Richard or AJ Madison.\n\nNow, crews will deliver, but not install, gas appliances; customers will have to find a master plumber on their own.\nI don\u2019t see how delivery crews will be able to haul off old appliances without disconnecting them from the gas valve, which would appear to violate this new law. So even replacing a gas unit with an electric one would require a master plumber.\nThink of how many thousands of basic appliance replacements have been made without a single one causing an explosion. What problem is Sanchez trying to solve, other than the potential lack of an endorsement by\nPlumbers Local No. 1\nfor her future political campaigns? The union pushed relentlessly for the bill, as did the\nPlumbing Foundation of New York City\nand Master Plumbers Council.\nSanchez knows that Mayor Eric Adams, who is making a desperate bid for re-election and welcomes union endorsements, is unlikely to veto the bill. But he should, because it increases costs. Also, his own Department of Buildings\ntestified against\nprovisions of the bill and has pointed out that only 1,100 master plumbers exist in a city of 8.6 million people. Why divert them to simple tasks?\nIncredibly, Sanchez claims her bill is merely a \u201c\nclarification\n\u201d that \u201cmakes explicit what has long been practice.\u201d What city has she been living in? In the Real World, gas appliances have routinely been replaced by people who are not licensed master plumbers.\nIt could have been worse. Sanchez\u2019s original\nIntro 429\ncalled for a licensed plumber to install dishwashers, garbage disposers and refrigerators with icemakers. These are also routinely installed without issue by appliance delivery people. The Real Estate Board of New York, as well as condominium and co-op interests, lobbied to narrow the bill\u2019s scope.\nMeanwhile, a similar battle lies ahead for the industry.\nCouncil member Farah Louis has\na bill\nrequiring owners of multiple dwellings to have a\nlicensed master plumber\nannually inspect all steam radiators in units with children under 6.\nLouis is responding to the death of an 11-month-old in her Brooklyn district. But her bill would\nimpose a great cost\non multifamily buildings, raising rents. And it likely would not prevent any deaths, as steam radiators are already inspected regularly and tragedies like\nthe one in Midwood\nare exceedingly rare.\n",

        "content": "Foundry Commercial and Wheelock Capital are teaming up to convert a shuttered indoor flea market in Pompano Beach into an industrial complex.\nOrlando-based\nFoundry\n, led by Paul Ellis, and Greenwich, Connecticut-based\nWheelock\n, led by Rick Kleeman and Jonathan Paul, paid $66 million for the 26-acre Festival Marketplace at 2900 West Sample Road, according to a press release.\nAn affiliate of Yoram Izhak\u2019s North Miami-based\nIMC Equity Group\nsold the property for $10 million above the previous sale price seven years ago. In 2018, the IMC affiliate paid $56 million for it, records show. Three years later, IMC sold a parking lot adjacent to the flea market for $16 million.\nFestival Marketplace closed in June.\nFoundry and Wheelock are planning Festival Logistics Park, a 474,000-square-foot complex divided into three buildings ranging from 60,000 square feet to 300,000 square feet, the release states. Demolition of the existing building and initial construction of the new project are slated to begin later this year, according to the joint venture. Festival Logistics Park\u2019s expected completion is in 2026.\n\nThe joint venture hired Nick Wigoda and Steve Medwin with Stream Realty Partners to lease up the planned industrial park, the release states.\nSince 2015, Foundry has developed and purchased $5 billion worth of commercial real estate assets across the country totaling 31 million square feet. The firm\u2019s south Florida portfolio is roughly 10 million square feet and more than $1.5 billion in project volume, the release states.\nIn July, Foundry and a real estate fund advised by Dallas-based Crow Holdings Capital paid\n$23.1 million\nfor a 10.2-acre parking lot near Festival Marketplace where the partnership is planning a pair of warehouses.\nSince its inception in 2005, Wheelock has acquired $11 billion-plus in real estate assets, primarily focusing on hospitality, industrial, retail and mixed-use projects, the firm\u2019s website states.\nThis month, Wheelock, Giles Capital Group, Rosemurgy Properties and Schmier Property Group sold the retail component of Uptown Boca, a mixed-use project in Boca Raton, for $118.4 million. The buyer was San Francisco-based\nStockbridge Capital Group\n.",

        "content": "The City of Garland scrapped plans to back a $71 million soccer complex that was supposed to anchor Atl\u00e9tico Dallas\u2019 entry into the professional ranks.\nThe club, set to join a United Soccer League division in 2027, said they found out this week the city no longer intends to pursue the\nproject\n. The move unwinds a deal the Garland City Council blessed in June, when it authorized a lease for city-owned land at Holford Road and the President George Bush Turnpike, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nAtl\u00e9tico Dallas envisioned a headquarters and training hub with a 2,000-seat \u201cshow pitch,\u201d academy fields, and a 28,000-square-foot building with team offices, locker rooms, therapy space and a dining hall. Plans also included futsal courts, a plaza and the possibility of a 127-acre sports and entertainment district nearby.\nExecutives called the reversal \u201cdeeply disappointing.\u201d Club co-founder Matt Valentine told the outlet that Garland residents had rallied around the project and that the decision \u201ccame out of left field.\u201d He added that Atl\u00e9tico had already been sourcing materials for the facility and offered to fund certain components privately to ease what he described as the city\u2019s \u201clegal concerns\u201d about the lease. Garland officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe proposed\nfinancing\nincluded $25 million for the fields, $20 million for the multipurpose building and $26 million for road improvements and a planned extension of Naaman Forest Boulevard. The club was also prepared to lease the complex from the city under a 20-year agreement with an annual rent of $75,000 for the fields with a 2.5 percent annual escalation\nWhile Garland was still in play, Atl\u00e9tico secured agreements with Dallas to stage home matches at the Cotton Bowl and to take over MoneyGram Soccer Park, a tournament hub at 2200 Walnut Hill Lane in Northwest Dallas. That arrangement won Dallas City Council approval in June. Valentine declined to say whether Garland\u2019s about-face was tied to the\nDallas\ndeal but acknowledged the timing raised questions.\nLosing\nGarland\nas a partner means the club\u2019s front office will look closer to Fair Park for its headquarters. Valentine said Atl\u00e9tico, currently operating out of Richardson, has begun scouting Dallas sites and expects to lean on MoneyGram for training.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",
