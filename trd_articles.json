        "content": "\ud83c\udfc6 Residential:\nPalm Beach had the top home sale recorded in the tri-county region, with the sale of a condo at\n200 Bradley Place\nfor just under $9 million. The sellers were brothers\nLeon and Peter Palandjian\n; their late parents owned the unit. Peter Palandjian is the CEO and chairman of International Real Estate Corporation, and Leon Palandjian is the firm\u2019s chief risk officer. The buyer was\nH. Barry Gales.\nThe three-bedroom unit has waterfront views and measures about 3,300 square feet. The deal works out to $2,700 per square foot. It went on the market with Corcoran\u2019s\nPaulette Koch\nin November for $9.5 million.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe priciest commercial real estate transaction to hit records in South Florida was in Fort Lauderdale, where a 12,100-square-foot, one-story retail property at\n2000 Federal Highway\nand an adjacent parking lot with 30 spaces traded for $6.9 million. The buyer was an affiliate of\nEl Car Wash\n, and the seller, who had owned the site for decades, was an LLC led by\nIlan Neuwirth\nof\nInn Real Estate. Native Realty\nhad the\nlisting\n, which had an asking price of $7 million.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nIn Delray Beach, a waterfront home at\n715 Southeast Eighth Street\nchanged hands for $7.6 million, or about $1,800 per square foot. The sellers were former NFL quarterback\nRex Grossman\nand his wife,\nAlison Grossman\n, and the buyer was a trust tied to\nMichael Manning.\nThe nearly 4,100-square-foot property has four bedrooms, four and a half baths, a pool and a private dock. The Grossmans purchased the property in 2019 for $2.9 million and put it on the market in April for $7.7 million. Douglas Elliman\u2019s\nChristopher Scoppettone\nrepresented both parties in the deal.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nFor $6.9 million,\nDrs. James and Susan Benenati\nsold their home at\n7400 Southwest 47th Court\nin Miami to an affiliate of\nAlex Pirez\u2019s\nMocca Group.\nThe deal penciled out to about $1,500 per square foot for the 4,500-square-foot home, which was built in the 1950s. It has five bedrooms, four bathrooms and a pool. The Benenatis purchased the house, which sits on a 1-acre lot, in 1992. It went on the market in May with an asking price of $8.3 million. Pirez represented himself in the transaction, and the Benenatis were represented by\nNancy Sanabria\nwith Compass.\nBy the Numbers:\nWhere are Saks Global\u2019s stores affected by bankruptcy?\nSaks Global\nfiled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Wednesday, potentially leaving large chunks of valuable real estate empty. At stake are 173 retail stores that may be shuttered, according to analysis by TRD Data.\nSaks Global, which on its website claims to own or control some 13 million square feet of leasable area, also owns Neiman Marcus, which it acquired for\n$2.7 billion in 2024\n, and outlet offshoots like Last Call. Saks Off 5th, one of these discount retailers, occupies about half of Saks Global\u2019s stores, 77 out of 173. Most of those stores are in California and Florida, which have 12 a piece.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "Although a\nmarket correction\nswamped the Austin area in 2025, sales and prices generally held flat\nwithin the city\n.\nSales, prices and dollar volume all dipped in 2025 throughout the Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos area, according to the Austin Board of Realtors.\nInventory\nalso remains well above 2024 levels, indicating ongoing sluggishness for a metro that had the\nhighest ratio of sellers to buyers in America\nin October, according to Redfin. However, within Austin city limits, sales and prices remained largely unchanged, and volume increased, the realtors\u2019 report shows.\nAbout 29,300 homes sold in the Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos area in 2025, a 3.2 percent decline from the year before, according to the realtors group. The median sale price fell as well, dropping by 2.4 percent to $435,000. Volume fell by 2.6 percent to $16.9 billion.\nLuxury sales slowed down\nlast year in Austin, as well. The Austin luxury market clocked the fourth-highest days on market in the country in October, according to\nRedfin\n. While some agents have attributed the trend to a dwindling tech scene \u2014 the target audience of\ndense infill development\n\u2014 the residential market as a whole was stronger in the city last year.\nAbout 10,100 homes sold in the city of Austin in 2025, 0.5 percent more than the 10,000 sold in 2024. The median price of an Austin home was $570,000 at year-end, just 0.6 percent less than $573,000 in 2024. Dollar volume rose by 2 percent in 2025, exceeding $7.7 billion in Austin, the realtors\u2019 report shows.\nSupply remains high, however. Active home listings within city limits jumped 14 percent in 2025 to 56,763.\nSales suffered more in the suburbs north of the city. In Williamson County, sales declined by 4.5 percent to 10,000 closings last year. The median sale price declined by 2.8 percent to $417,000. Volume likewise shrank, falling by 6.6 percent to $4.8 billion, according to the realtors group.\nSupply rose even higher in the \u2019burbs, with active listings increasing in Williamson County by 20 percent to 47,738, the report shows.\nFor December alone, the numbers describe a market like a clearance sale: bigger discounts, more deals and a swift drop in inventory. It was the first month all year in which pending sales dropped below 2,000, according to Unlock MLS data. The average home sold after 88 days on the market, a week slower than last December and the highest days on the market all year. The average seller settled for just 90 percent of his or her original asking price, the lowest close to list price ratio all year; and inventory fell to 4.2 months supply, the lowest all year, according to Unlock MLS data.\n",

        "content": "Former real estate teammates\nMitch Goltz\nand\nShai Wolkowicki\nhave been hit with another lawsuit while they work through their own internal court fights to wind down their old company GW Properties.\nAndrew Goodman and Ari Golson\u2019s Chicago-based firm Wolcott Partners filed a lawsuit in Cook County Circuit Court this month alleging GW Properties failed to pay off a $1 million loan. The note is backed by a Wolcott-funded mortgage taken out on a vacant retail property in west suburban La Grange, owned by the former GW duo.\nGoltz and Wolkowicki have also racked up over $700,000 in mechanic\u2019s liens against the property at 14 South La Grange Road for allegedly failing to pay various contractors as promised for their work.\nWolcott issued the debt to GW in July 2024, and when it matured a year later, the investors failed to pay it off. Now, Wolcott is asking a judge to approve a foreclosure of the property because the mortgage is in default.\nIt\u2019s far from the only debt that GW ventures took on from Wolcott. GW borrowed a $12 million mezzanine loan from Wolcott in early 2024, using seven GW-owned properties in Chicago and its suburbs as collateral, including the La Grange property, public records show.\nMost of the properties have since been sold over the last year and released from the Wolcott deal, including the\nChurch Street Plaza in Evanston that fetched over $31 million\nfrom buyer Continuum Capital, records show.\nReached by phone, Goltz said he and Wolkowicki are in the process of refinancing the La Grange property.\nWolcott\u2019s lawsuit comes as the GW pair is in the process of winding down their old firm and going separate ways. Wolkowicki is staying in the multifamily business while Goltz continues to focus on retail and mixed-use developments with his new firm, GTZ Properties.\nYet recent legal battles have ensnared the business partners as they make career transitions.\nInvestors and lenders\nare currently pursuing\nWolkowicki and Chickoo Patel\n, his business partner in the multifamily sector, for nearly $20 million total in various court cases, including $63,000 in credit card debt Patel allegedly owes to American Express.\nAs those lawsuits piled up, Wolkowicki hit back, alleging Patel was\nrunning a \u201cponzi-like scheme\u201d\nthat has bilked his ex-partners out of more than $10.8 million through fraud, theft and mismanagement.\nOver the years, Wolkowicki and his wife Lauren Lampert, have invested in more than 50 real estate projects with Patel. In addition to that trio\u2019s Chicago holdings, they also jointly owned rental properties throughout Illinois, including in Rockford, and Springfield, where Patel and Wolkowicki are facing a $16 million foreclosure lawsuit from Old National Bank for an apartment complex at 1833 Seven Pines Road.\nWhile those disputes don\u2019t involve Goltz, he\u2019s facing his own legal drama with Wolkowicki in addition to Wolcott\u2019s $1 million suit.\nWolkowicki is suing Goltz,\nalleging Goltz siphoned funds and pledged company assets\nto outside groups without consent, specifically diverting over $2 million from the sale of Church Street Plaza in Evanston. The lawsuit is pending in Cook County Circuit Court, as Goltz is trying to dismiss the complaint and force his former partner to work it out in arbitration or mediation, while Wolkowicki wants to keep the case in court.\nIt hasn\u2019t been all bad news for the pair. The duo last week sold a 128,000-square-foot industrial property at 3800 North Milwaukee Avenue for $16.4 million, moving on from the site a block away from the Portage Park People\u2019s Gas site\nGW walked away from redeveloping\nafter hitting\nmultiple snags with a $110 million proposal\n.\nThe building at 3800 North Milwaukee was also used as collateral for GW\u2019s mezzanine loan from Wolcott, public records show. Before the sale, the Milwaukee Avenue property also had another large mechanic\u2019s lien recorded against the GW ownership last month. It alleged DCS Midwest \u2014 the same contractor that\u2019s allegedly gone unpaid in La Grange \u2014\u00a0is owed $3.4 million for work it performed without yet being compensated. It\u2019s unclear if GW\u2019s subsequent sale of the property will clear up the dispute.\nMeanwhile, GTZ Properties secured necessary entitlements to rezone an Aurora property for mixed-use development. Goltz said the Aurora project is one of many properties that GTZ is making progress on redeveloping.\nLast year, his new firm also bought a four-building, 327,000-square-foot\nOak Brook office complex\nout of distress for $9 million. GTZ hasn\u2019t yet finalized plans for that property.\nSam Lounsberry contributed reporting.\n",

        "content": "Socialite Shafi Roepers finally found a buyer for her Upper East Side co-op.\nRoepers\u2019 apartment on the third floor of 4 East 66th Street, asking $30 million, snagged a contract, roughly a decade after she first listed it with a $65 million price tag, according to a StreetEasy listing.\nRoepers bought her ex-husband, hedge funder Alexander Roepers, out of the property for $15.8 million in 2013. She started shopping the five-bedroom abode two years later, though it underwent\nmultiple price chops\nbefore landing a pending deal.\nThe full-floor home has seven bathrooms and four fireplaces. It also features a Juliet balcony and library with views of Central Park.\nBrown Harris Stevens\u2019 Mary Fitzgibbons and Martha Kramer had the listing.\nThe building has been home to a number of pricey deals, including last year, when Sarah Solomon, the widow of pharmaceutical executive Martin Solomon, sold her apartment for\n$37 million\n. Similar to Roepers\u2019 co-op, Unit No. 7, which initially asked $55 million, had multiple price chops after hitting the market in 2022.\nThe co-op was the priciest of 21 homes in Manhattan asking $4 million or more to land inked deals between Jan. 12 and Jan. 18, according to Olshan Realty\u2019s report. The total was on par with the\nprevious period\n, when 20 luxury properties in the borough found buyers.\nCo-ops nabbed the No. 1 and No. 2 spots topping Manhattan\u2019s luxury market last week, which has only happened three times since June 2021, including in May. The two pricey signed contracts come as deals for\nco-ops have been outpacing\ncondo sales in the borough, according to Miller Samuel\u2019s fourth quarter report.\nThe second most expensive home to enter contract was a co-op at\nthe Dakota\n, with an asking price of $24 million. Apartment No. 33, which hasn\u2019t traded in more than 40 years, overlooks Central Park and has three bedrooms and four bathrooms. It also features a staff room, corner living room, library and four wood-burning fireplaces.\nBrown Harris Stevens\u2019 John Burger had the listing.\nBuilt in 1884, the landmarked building at 1 West 72nd Street is among the most well-known buildings in New York City. It has a long list of storied residents, including Judy Garland, Paul Simon and Yoko Ono, who continued living at the Dakota after her husband, John Lennon, was shot and killed outside the building\u00a0 in 1980.\nOf the 21 properties to find buyers, nine were condos, seven were co-ops, one was a condop and five were townhouses.\nThe homes asked a combined $201 million, which works out to an average of $9.1 million and a median of $6.1 million. The typical home was on the market for more than a year and had a discount of 6 percent.\n",

        "content": "Developer Charles Cohen wants a New York court to give him additional time to resolve a $187 million personal debt owed to Fortress Investment Group, arguing that he has made progress toward repayment and is actively pursuing further asset sales.\nCohen said he has worked \u201ctirelessly\u201d over the past 18 months to reduce the obligation, including selling two New York\nbuildings\nto Vornado Realty Trust and using $52 million of the proceeds to pay Fortress, according to a Jan. 13 affidavit\nreported by Crain\u2019s New York\n. He contends that despite what he characterizes as excessive litigation from Fortress\u2019 attorneys, his team has delivered \u201cexceptional\u201d results under difficult conditions.\n\u201cWhat I need is more time to continue doing the right thing,\u201d he said in the affidavit.\nFortress, however, says its patience has run out. The private equity firm, which manages roughly $50 billion in assets, is asking the court to appoint a receiver to sell portions of Cohen\u2019s 12 million\u2011square\u2011foot portfolio to satisfy the debt. Fortress has also accused Cohen of improperly transferring his Connecticut estate and 220\u2011foot yacht to his wife to shield them from creditors \u2014 allegations Cohen denies.\nIn its Jan. 14 response, Fortress argued that Cohen \u201ccannot be trusted\u201d to oversee the sales process.\nCohen, who has spent nearly five decades at the family\u2011run Cohen Brothers, controls major Midtown properties including 805 Third Avenue, 3 Park Avenue and\n750 Lexington Avenue\n. He recently sold 623 Fifth Avenue and 3 East 54th Street to Vornado at distressed pricing and says Vornado chairman Steven Roth is exploring additional acquisitions or joint ventures.\nCohen claimed in the affidavit that he was in talks to sell a White Plains\noffice building\nand plans to market 622 Third Avenue, a 1 million\u2011square\u2011foot tower near Grand Central.\nOne asset Cohen insists must remain untouched is the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood, a 1.6 million\u2011square\u2011foot complex he calls essential to the stability of his entire portfolio. Selling it, he argues, would \u201cjeopardize\u201d operations and lead to the \u201ccollapse\u201d of his business.\nAppointing a receiver would trigger loan defaults across his holdings, Cohen claimed, forcing banks to demand repayment ahead of Fortress and potentially leaving the firm \u201cwiped out.\u201d\nFortress disputes this, saying receivership would not trigger default at the Pacific Design Center and that the property\u2019s high value could allow Fortress to be repaid more efficiently than through New York asset sales.\n\u2013 Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "A landmark in Santa Rosa is at the center of a housing debate as a Bay Area developer seeks to build residences on the site.\nSan Jose-based Swenson is once again\npursuing\nplans for a new swath of townhouses on a nearly 14-acre property that includes the remains of the historic Carrillo Adobe, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Swenson purchased the property approximately two decades ago and at the time looked to build new housing, but left land around the adobe to be deeded to the city so people could see it from the street.\nThe newly proposed project, dubbed Creekside Village Townhomes, would consist of 162 three-story\ntownhouses\n. Swenson\u2019s preliminary plan calls for preserving the adobe on a 4-acre park and constructing buildings around it. The company presented its designs to the city at a public meeting last month and has yet to submit a formal proposal. Doing so would begin the evaluation process, which includes studies of the land\u2019s historical resources and other environmental and traffic considerations.\nCutting down the size of the park area \u201cslightly\u201d compared to the blueprint nearly 20 years ago would help Swenson financially, Mark Pilarczyk, president of development at Swanson, said at the meeting, per the Chronicle.\nThe idea is already facing pushback, including from those with historical ties to the Carrillo Adobe. Larry Carrillo, a descendant of Maria Carrillo, the matriarch who first lived in the adobe in the 1840s, said Swenson \u201creally poked the bear.\u201d\nNative American community leaders and historians are also speaking out against the project.\n\u201cBuilding houses on top of this land would be a continued erasure of our history and presence here,\u201d Greg Sarris, chairman of the Graton Rancheria federation of Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo, told the Chronicle, saying the city should protect all 14 acres surrounding the Adobe. The property has \u201clayers of history\u201d that \u201dmakes it a compelling place, and you wouldn\u2019t want to disrupt it or obliterate it or hide it for all time,\u201d Eric Stanley, associate director and curator of history at the Museum of Sonoma County, added.\nRoughly 20 years ago, the Diocese of Santa Rosa sold the property and the adobe to Swenson for $5.1 million. When Swenson first floated building on the site, it called for 140 market-rate\ncondominiums\nand 25\nlow-income units\nand it was required to create a park for the adobe and grant it to the city. The 2008 financial crisis halted the plans, and 82-year-old Larry Carrillo has been personally removing weeds from the\nSonoma County\nsite ever since as there\u2019s currently no government funding or entity to preserve it.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Cary is putting real money behind JM Developers\u2019 long-awaited redevelopment of the former Maplewood School site, approving up to $12.4 million in tax increment financing to help clear the way for a dense residential project.\nThe Cary village board unanimously signed off on a development agreement last week with Chicago-based JM to remake the long-shuttered school property at 422 Krenz Avenue into a mix of apartments, townhomes and single-family houses, according to village documents and public meeting records. The Daily Herald\nreported\nthat the deal clears a key hurdle for a project estimated to cost more than $94 million and construct more than 200 rental units alongside for-sale homes.\nUnder the agreement, the developers \u2014 an umbrella group of companies consisting of\nCordogan Clark\n, JTE Real Estate Services, Eriksson Engineering Associates,\nand\nD2\nCapital Advisors \u2014 would tap the Central Cary TIF District, established in 2023, to help cover eligible costs including demolition of the old school building and storm sewer upgrades along School Street. Community Development Director Brian Simmons described the pact as effectively a binding contract, with demolition expected to begin this summer.\nThe village agreed to sell the property to the developers for $1. In return, JM Developers must secure zoning approvals within 180 days. The publication reported that representatives for the firm said the TIF assistance is needed to complete the project in a \u201ctimely manner.\u201d\nVillage officials are betting the\nsubsidy\nwill pay off. Over the estimated 23-year life of the TIF, the project is projected to generate more than $36.5 million in incremental property taxes, more than tripling the public investment, according to municipal estimates.\nThe plan has been in the works for about a year and has evolved amid neighborhood resistance, particularly to\nmultifamily housing\n. After open houses and resident feedback, the developers revised the proposal to add owner-occupied homes and expand a public park. Even so, concerns over density and building height persisted at the village meeting.\nThe current plan calls for 13 two-story single-family homes, 15 two-story townhouses, four duplex buildings totaling 16 units, 22 three-story townhomes and three apartment buildings \u2014 two rising five stories and one four stories \u2014 for a total of 236 apartment units. Units would range from studios to three-bedroom apartments, with amenities including a pool, fitness center, coworking spaces, dog park and public green space.\nResidents again raised objections at last week\u2019s meeting, warning that high-density rentals could alter the character of the surrounding single-family neighborhood. Developers countered that traffic, market and pricing studies back up the proposal.\nBeyond the site itself, the redevelopment is tied to broader infrastructure plans, including a long-discussed extension of Maplewood Road aimed at improving access to downtown Cary.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

It identified 46 new listings, and 1,290 active listings on the market.\nThe previous week\n, buyers signed 23 contracts for properties in Miami-Dade totalling $242.7 million in asking dollar volume.\nOf the properties that went pending last week, nine were single-family homes, and five were condos. The average asking price for the condos was $11.4 million, or $2,619 per square foot. They spent an average of 263 days on the market.\nThe average asking price for the single-family homes was $9 million, or $1,588 per square foot, and they spent an average of 189 days on the market.\nThe most expensive contract signed last week was for unit S-1011 at Four Seasons Residences at the Surf Club asking $38 million, or $5,144 per square foot. The unit at 9001 Collins Avenue in Surfside is owned by an LLC that acquired it for $21 million in 2018, according to property records.\nThe 7,400-square-foot unit has seven bedrooms, seven bathrooms, one half-bathroom, a library and a game room, the listing shows. Nadim Ashi\u2019s Fort Partners completed\nthe Surf Club\nin 2017, and it includes four pools, fitness facilities and a Thomas Keller restaurant.\nThe deal came a month after Fort Partners sold a penthouse at the adjacent Seaway at the Surf Club for\n$86 million\n.\nThe latest unit to sell first hit the market in 2024 asking $42 million, according to Redfin. The price was lowered three times, and it returned to the market asking $38 million in August. Ximena Penuela with Fort Realty has the listing.\nThe next priciest listing to find a buyer last week was the 7,600-square-foot waterfront home at 3333 Poinciana Avenue in Coconut Grove asking $16.9 million.\nRichard Shipley, whose parents founded the chemical maker Shipley Company in 1957, is the seller, records show. Shipley Company later merged with Rohm and Haas, the company that invented Plexiglas, which is now a subsidiary of chemical giant Dow.\nShipley bought the quarter-acre home for $5.8 million in 2018, according to property records. The home was built in 1995 and has five bedrooms, six bathrooms, one half-bathroom, a pool and a dock, the listing shows.\nShipley listed the home for $16.9 million in December, and Nancy Batchelor with Compass has the listing.",

        "content": "Six months after first landing in Sunnyvale, artificial intelligence-powered software company Databricks is growing its footprint in the Silicon Valley city.\nLast month, San Francisco-based Databricks\nleased three floors\nat the seven-story 250 West Washington Avenue building in Sunnyvale, adding to its office space at the Cityline development, the San Francisco Business Times reported. The company now occupies more than 455,000 square feet across the two newest Cityline office towers. Average\nfloor plate size\nin the building is about 47,500 square feet, per CBRE.\nLast summer, the venture capital-funded firm\nleased the entire seven-story building\nnext door at 200 West Washington Avenue, securing 305,000 square feet there. It was the company\u2019s first outpost in Sunnyvale and its third in the Bay Area.\nDatabricks\n\u2019 Cityline office expansion is the latest instance of an\nAI firm doubling down on in-person work\nas the booming AI sector takes up more office space across the Bay Area and workers move into the region in droves. AI companies currently occupy at least 6 million square feet of offices across Silicon Valley alone, according to the Business Times. Databricks\u2019 expansion at Cityline was among the largest leases of the fourth quarter.\nLast quarter, Silicon Valley recorded 2.9 million square feet of positive net absorption, meaning more space was leased than vacated, per\nCBRE data\ncited by the Business Times. Office vacancy dropped for a fifth consecutive quarter to 16.1 percent. Technology and AI were the biggest drivers of major office leasing, comprising approximately 85 percent of leases.\nOpenAI and Anthropic have been pursuing a similar strategy of office expansion in a concentrated cluster near their San Francisco headquarters. OpenAI is\nreportedly in talks to lease\nbetween 200,000 to 250,000 square feet in San Francisco\u2019s Mission Bay, which would bring its local office footprint to more than 1 million square feet. In September, Anthropic signed a lease for approximately 100,000 square feet of offices across the street from its headquarters in downtown San Francisco.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "After years of false starts and fizzled plans, Southstar now takes the reins for potential development of San Antonio\u2019s long vacated and crumbling Lone Star Brewery site, as the developer acquired the 32-acre property near Southtown.\nThe New Braunfels-based firm confirmed the acquisition Friday, purchasing the property at 600 Lone Star Boulevard from San Antonio-based GrayStreet Partners and Houston-based Midway, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe sellers\nbought the site\nin 2020 for about $14.5 million and later pitched a sweeping $709 million mixed-use proposal dubbed the Lone Star District. That plan stalled amid rising interest rates, construction costs and cooling rent growth. Terms of Southstar\u2019s purchase were not disclosed, though the property was last assessed at $18.6 million by the Bexar Central Appraisal District.\nSouthstar CEO Thad Rutherford framed the acquisition as both a redevelopment move and a preservation effort, pointing to the site\u2019s iconic smokestack and its deep roots in San Antonio\u2019s working class history. Company leaders stressed that progress will depend on extensive public engagement and coordination with public agencies.\nThe Lone Star site sits near several major public investments already in the pipeline, including VIA Metropolitan Transit\u2019s transit-oriented development plans, the San Antonio River Authority\u2019s long-term river improvements, and ongoing development downtown and\nsouth of downtown\n. Southstar said it intends to align its plans with those initiatives, a signal that any redevelopment will likely be large, mixed-use and phased over several years.\nIn 2021, the city granted $24 million in public incentives to help fund the project, though when news came that GrayStreet was shopping the property, officials asserted that the $24 million incentive package wouldn\u2019t apply if a new developer took over, as previously reported by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nSouthstar\nis also seeking to buy nearby parcels owned by the Newell family that operated as a recycling facility and CPS Energy, including a defunct power plant across the river on Mission Road, the Express-News\nreported\n. If those deals close, Southstar could control more than 70 acres on both sides of a quiet stretch of the river.\nGrayStreet managing partner Kevin Covey said last month that his firm and\nMidway\nwould remain financial partners in the project and that Southstar would likely build off existing plans. A Southstar spokesperson confirmed to the Express-News that GrayStreet provided seller financing, effectively acting as the lender on the deal.\nThe brewery closed in 1996 and has since cycled through at least five failed redevelopment attempts, derailed by environmental issues, capital constraints and bankruptcies. According to the city\u2019s website, the facility opened in 1940 as commercial brewing operations outgrew the historic Lone Star Brewery site at 200 West Jones Avenue. That building was constructed between 1895 and 1904 and now houses the San Antonio Museum of Art.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

County\nincreased\nin both 2024 and 2025 since hitting a post-pandemic low in 2023, Commercial Observer reported, citing a fourth-quarter\nreport\nfrom Kidder Mathews. Almost 30,000 units across L.A. County traded hands in 2025, up from fewer than 20,000 units sold in 2020, which was even lower than the peak pandemic figures of 2020.\nMeasure ULA\n, the controversial transfer tax that levies between 4 and 5.5 percent on property sales higher than $5 million, was enacted in April 2023. The legislation appeared to scare away investors, as a study by the University of California, Los Angeles, last year found that multifamily sales volume fell by as much as 50 percent after Measure ULA was enacted, per CO. Kidder Mathews\u2019 new report seemingly upholds those findings, noting a large drop in unit sales between 2022 and 2023 before the rebound of the past two years. Total revenue from Measure ULA since its enactment\nsurpassed $1 billion\nearlier this month.\nThe latest sales volume numbers in L.A. County indicate that investor demand is improving despite the increased tax liability and property prices. Average multifamily unit price fell 3 percent year-over-year to $278,000, according to Kidder Mathews\u2019 report, while average rent prices were flat compared to 2024. Vacancy hit 5.6 percent and has been trending upward every year since 2021, per CO.\nMultiple nine-figure deals closed in the fourth quarter. Last month, Madison International Realty made the priciest multifamily purchase last quarter with the\n$161.2 million acquisition\nof the El Centro Apartments &amp; Bungalows in Hollywood. The second-priciest sale of the quarter was Carmel Partners\u2019 $141 million pickup of the\nStella apartments in Marina del Rey\n, followed by Kennedy Wilson spending $135 million for The Chadwick in Koreatown, and Eagle Partners dropping $107 million for the Hills at Hacienda Heights residential community.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The parcel is zoned for general industrial use, allowing for manufacturing, wholesale operations and other industrial uses, and is surrounded by other industrial properties.\nHow the site will be used by its new owner remains to be seen.

        "content": "Brooklyn\u2019s investment sales market bent in 2025, but it didn\u2019t break.\nThe borough logged $6.6 billion in commercial property trades across 1,191 deals, according to TerraCRG\u2019s 2025 Brooklyn Market Report. That marked a 16 percent drop in dollar volume from 2024, even as the transaction count was basically flat.\n\u201cThe prevailing theme is definitely uncertainty,\u201d TerraCRG Dan Marks said during a conference call. \u201cThere are many open questions that are likely to be resolved \u2026 in 2026, and those outcomes are going to have a meaningful impact and implications for both owners who are deciding to sell and buyers regarding deploying capital.\u201d\nThe year unfolded amid a swirl of questions about\ninterest rate cuts\n,\nmayoral and City Council elections\nand the passage of a\nmajor rezoning of Atlantic Avenue\n. But momentum built toward the end of the year as the picture became clearer. The fourth quarter closed with nearly $1.8 billion in volume across 277 transactions, bolstered by three trades over $100 million, per the report.\nResidential development fared best, posting a 24 percent increase in dollar volume year-over-year, or $1.4 billion across 58 transactions. The\nlargest deal\nwas Tavros Capital and Charney Companies\u2019 purchase of\n175 Third Street\nfrom Aby Rosen\u2019s RFR Holding for $164 million.\nMixed-use posted the highest overall dollar volume at $1.8 billion across 445 transactions, despite a modest year-over-year decline. The\nbiggest deal\nwas Carlyle Group and Jay Greenberg\u2019s Z+G Property Group\u2019s purchase of the 13-story apartment building at 130 Second Street in Gowanus from a joint venture of Joyland Management, Meral Property Group and the Loketch Group.\nMulti-family told a more nuanced story. Transaction count rose, even as dollar volume slid 23 percent, signaling strong demand at lower prices. The year\u2019s\nlargest multifamily deal\ncame in Fort Greene, where Fetner Properties, MCB Real Estate and Farallon Capital Management paid $210.5 million to Rabsky Group for the 463-unit building at 240 Willoughby Street.\nOther sectors struggled to regain footing. Industrial sales plunged 67 percent by dollar volume, reflecting a lack of available inventory. Retail volume fell 20 percent, though trophy assets in Williamsburg continued to\ncommand record numbers\nfrom institutional buyers.\nMarket headwinds are unlikely to dissipate overnight, as political shifts continue to shape dealmaking.\nMarks said, \u201c2026 is going to be defined a lot by how the new administration is behaving and what they\u2019re able to get passed.\u201d\n",

        "content": "When Annie Coulter took office as mayor of Ford Heights in 2017, she stumbled onto a quiet real estate scandal that, years later, is casting new light on how Cook County allows municipalities to seize and dispose of tax-delinquent property.\nCoulter learned that her predecessor, Charles Griffin, arranged to give away 17 village-owned houses \u2014 properties Ford Heights had acquired through the county\u2019s revitalization program, which lets municipalities take control of tax-delinquent homes. According to court records and an\ninvestigation\nby the Investigative Project on Race and Equity in partnership with Injustice Watch, at least four of the houses went to Griffin\u2019s friends or relatives, while others were transferred to political allies and village insiders. At the time, the homes were collectively worth about $410,000, based on\nCook County assessor\ndata.\nGriffin later oversaw the transfer of four more houses during a second term as mayor, investigators found. Yet nothing in county rules explicitly barred him from doing so. Cook County lacks clear regulations preventing local officials from handing seized properties to friends, family or political supporters \u2014 and oversight is minimal, the investigation found.\nThe revitalization program was designed to return vacant and blighted homes to productive use. Instead, the investigation showed with the Ford Heights example how easily a municipality can be bent into a political giveaway machine. Some of the transferred homes quickly fell back into disrepair or tax delinquency. One ranch-style house given away in 2017 now sits boarded up and overgrown, with unpaid property taxes piling up.\nCounty officials had\nwarning signs\n. Ford Heights failed to submit required annual reports on the seized properties, a basic condition of the program. Even so, the village was allowed to complete foreclosures, clear tax debt and continue using the program in later years. From 2019 to 2023, Ford Heights sought to use the revitalization tool on more than 300 properties, though none were ultimately seized, the investigation found.\nGriffin\u2019s actions came to light not through county enforcement, but because Coulter reported them to law enforcement, according to the investigation. Prosecutors later indicted Griffin on theft and official misconduct charges tied to embezzling village funds \u2014 not the free house transfers. Griffin was convicted in 2024 and sentenced to four years in prison, though he has appealed and maintains the transfers were lawful.\nThe Ford Heights case is part of a broader pattern. Since 2016, municipalities have seized more than 600 properties through the revitalization program, mostly in predominantly Black south suburban communities, according to the investigation. In many cases, Cook County allowed governments to keep the full value of seized homes, including any homeowner equity beyond\nunpaid taxes\n.\nThat practice is now under legal pressure. In 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that governments can\u2019t take more than they\u2019re owed when collecting delinquent taxes. A federal judge later found Cook County\u2019s similar system unconstitutional in cases involving private investors. The county temporarily suspended the revitalization program, though municipalities can still seize properties through the\nCook County Land Bank Authority\n\u2014 another channel with limited guardrails.\nHousing advocates and policy experts say the real estate implications are stark: Weak rules distort local housing markets, erode trust and sometimes worsen blight rather than curing it. They\u2019re calling for clearer prohibitions, public disposition requirements and independent oversight to ensure seized homes are sold transparently or reused for genuine public benefit.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Invitation Homes is pushing further into ground-up construction, shelling out $89 million to buy Atlanta-based homebuilder and developer ResiBuilt. It\u2019s a move that deepens the wager of one of the largest owners of single-family rental homes in the country on build-to-rent housing.\nThe Dallas-based firm said Friday that it closed on the acquisition two days earlier, according to a press release. The deal includes up to $7.5 million in potential incentive-based payments, along with 23 active building contracts and a broader pipeline of potential projects not yet under contract, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. ResiBuilt\u2019s parent, Resicap, will remain independent.\nFounded in 2018, ResiBuilt has developed more than 4,200 homes across the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida, operating in the\nfast-growing Sun Belt markets\nthat have become core territory for institutional rental firms. While no land was transferred as part of the deal, Invitation Homes secured the option to purchase 1,500 lots.\nInvitation Homes\u2019\nacquisition of ResiBuilt is less about adding units overnight and more about tightening control over its development pipeline. CEO and President Dallas Tanner framed the deal as a strategic expansion of the company\u2019s core mission, calling it a step toward addressing housing affordability by adding supply in high-demand markets.\nThe move fits neatly with Invitation Homes\u2019 evolution from a\npost-foreclosure buying machine\ninto a more vertically integrated housing firm. Founded in 2012, the firm now owns and operates more than 110,000 single-family rental homes across 16 markets, making it one of the largest institutional landlords in the country. The company reported $2.6 billion in revenue in 2024 and carries a market capitalization north of $16.8 billion, according to the outlet.\nBuild-to-rent has become a central growth lever for large landlords, as resale inventory tightens and competition for existing homes intensifies. According to the release, by bringing ResiBuilt in-house, Invitation Homes gains a team with regional development experience.\nThe deal also comes as Invitation Homes continues to transform its office environment. According to the outlet, the firm relocated its headquarters last year to the Two Lincoln Center building at 5420 LBJ Freeway in North Dallas, leaving downtown\u2019s\nComerica Bank Tower\nin a move aimed at accommodating headcount growth and a hybrid work model.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

She is seeking $500 million in damages, the complaint states.\nThe former beauty pageant contestant is locked in a bitter eviction lawsuit with\nCardone\nand his wife, Elena.\nTheir landlord entity sued Howell after she rented a Sunny Isles Beach Condo from them in 2023. Howell wants the Cardones to return $150,000 in security deposits in that case. Howell\u2019s lawyer Douglas Jeffrey did not respond to requests for comment.\nCardone accused Howell of \u201cintentionally and maliciously\u201d causing millions of dollars in property damage.\n\u201cThose who are as visible as I am become targets of those looking for quick scores,\u201d Cardone told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nCardone has over 10 million followers across his social media platforms, where he gives real estate and financial advice and flaunts his luxurious lifestyle.\nCardone Capital has more than\n$5 billion\nin real estate assets across the country, primarily multifamily projects. The firm recently began investing in bitcoin.\nCardone Capital\nsells small percentages in its real estate and cryptocurrency holdings to small investors via crowdfunding.\nEviction over fire sprinklers\nHowell entered into a one-year lease for the Cardones\u2019 33th floor unit at the Regalia Residences at 19575 Collins Avenue in November 2023 at $50,000 a month, court filings show.\nShe was required to pay up front a $50,000 landlord security deposit, $100,000 for two months rent and a $5,000 security deposit to the building\u2019s condo association.\nThe landlord-tenant relationship crumbled a month later when Howell moved in.\nThe Cardones accuse Howell of damaging sprinkler heads in the unit with a \u201cheavy object\u201d that caused water to pour into the condo down to the lobby, according to their eviction suit. The flooding damaged the Cardones\u2019 unit and 30 others below it, their complaint alleges.\nThe same day, the condo association allegedly banned Howell from the building, and the Cardones served her with an eviction notice requiring her to leave by Jan. 3, 2024.\nIn a counterclaim, Howell denied damaging the sprinkler system, as well as accusations that she destroyed security cameras in common areas. Howell claimed she was asleep when \u201cshe was awakened by a loud sound,\u201d her response states. She walked into the kitchen when she saw water pouring from the ceiling and allegedly had no idea what caused the sprinklers to malfunction.\nElena Cardone, a security guard, a building representative and police showed up to the unit immediately after the sprinkler incident. Elena Cardone allegedly informed everyone present that Howell \u201cwas no longer allowed on the premises\u201d and that she had \u201c30 minutes to gather her belongings\u201d and leave, according to Howell\u2019s lawsuit.\n\u201cWeird vibe\u201d\n\u200bIn the defamation lawsuit, Howell alleged that an \u201ceerie, weird vibe surrounded\u201d the Regalia Residences condo unit, and that \u201cstrange, cultlike individuals surrounded\u201d the Cardones.\nA text thread between Howell and Elena Cardone allegedly shows how their relationship unraveled. In a text sent on Jan. 26, 2024, and included in Howell\u2019s complaint, Elena Cardone allegedly said, \u201cMy husband\u2019s gonna make you famous.\u201d\nThe same day,\nCardone\nallegedly posted two photos on his Facebook page of\nHowell\nwearing a black ski mask, a bikini top and black sweatpants.\nIn the post, which is still up, Cardone allegedly wrote that he was looking for Howell\u2019s phone number and her current location, as well as any information about her and any of her boyfriends.\nHe allegedly wrote that she owns a company \u201cpossibly [a] dating site or model agency, owned by a middle eastern or Egyptian dude.\u201d Cardone allegedly offered \u201crewards for any details that lead to her whereabouts.\u201d\nCardone falsely attempted to align Howell with someone she doesn\u2019t know and doesn\u2019t have any affiliation with, according to the complaint, which says she doesn\u2019t own a dating agency or website.

In the last quarter of 2022 alone, nearly 40 million square feet of industrial space was under construction in the Chicago area, a year-end report from Savills found.\nNow, the sector is showing signs of stabilizing from pandemic-era highs. During the last quarter of 2025, about 13 million square feet of industrial properties was under construction in the Chicago area. Much of that activity was driven by\na boost in data center development\n, according to Savills.\nThe slowdown has helped new projects find buyers as they hit the market.\nThe highest industrial dollar sale in Cook County in 2025 was\nNorthPoint Development\u2019s purchase of a $270 million industrial portfolio\nin the Northwest suburbs to NorthPoint Development,\na TRD data analysis found.\nBuyer demand for Thor Equities\u2019 building at 1211 Tower Road may be linked to its proximity to both O\u2019Hare International Airport and downtown Chicago. The building is 30 miles northwest of downtown and 15 miles northwest of O\u2019Hare.\nProximity to O\u2019Hare has proven to be an advantage for both industrial players and office landlords.

        "content": "After months of heated debate, a controversial data center proposal is heading for a vote before the Naperville City Council Tuesday night, setting up a high-stakes test of how far the Chicago suburb is willing to go to accommodate energy-hungry infrastructure near residential neighborhoods.\nThe developer \u2014 Naples, Florida-based Karis Critical \u2014 pared back its original plan, which once called for two data centers near Naperville and Warrenville roads. The Daily Herald\nreported\nthat the current request seeks approval for a single facility, a move the company said reflects an effort to \u201cright-size\u201d the project for the city, according to statements made to council members and city documents. For nearby residents, the changes haven\u2019t gone far enough.\nThe council will consider a draft development agreement that lays out strict conditions governing construction, operations and ongoing oversight. Under the proposal, the data center would be required to buy all of its electricity from the city, with peak demand capped at 36 megawatts.\nKaris\nwould also be on the hook for any infrastructure upgrades and would guarantee that the added load doesn\u2019t drive up electric costs for other Naperville customers.\nCity staff said enough electrical capacity exists to support the project while accommodating reasonable growth through 2030, based on analysis conducted with consultants and ComEd, the primarily electrical supplier for Chicago and Northern Illinois. Still, a staff report cautions that absorbing another large-load customer in the\nI-88 corridor\ncould require significant system upgrades, effectively limiting future options unless more power is secured.\nThat concern is fueling\nresident opposition\n, along with fears about noise and air quality. At a recent meeting, neighbors pointed to diesel backup generators \u2014 up to 24 of them \u2014 as a particular flashpoint. The agreement would limit testing to weekdays, cap it at 10 hours annually and restrict non-emergency use during poor air quality days. Only two generators could be tested at once. Critics argue those safeguards don\u2019t address the long-term reality of 24/7 industrial operations near homes, some just hundreds of feet away.\nNoise from cooling systems is another worry, prompting calls for the city to modernize its noise ordinance and set clearer buffers between data centers and residential areas. Opponents said other municipalities have already tightened zoning rules after learning about the impacts of allowing data centers near neighborhoods.\nThe fight also taps into broader questions about land use along Naperville\u2019s I-88/Diehl Road corridor. A city-commissioned study urged officials to pursue higher-value, mixed-use and life sciences development that supports a more vibrant \u201clive-work-play\u201d environment. Residents and some council members are questioning whether a massive, power-intensive facility forecloses those possibilities.\nKaris, which pledged at least $250 million in investment excluding tenant equipment, argued the site\u2019s proximity to the Indian Hill substation makes it uniquely suited for a data center and positions Naperville for long-term tax revenue and tech-sector jobs.\nNaperville isn\u2019t the only Chicago suburb where Karis is eyeing data center development. Anthony Iatarola\u2019s firm, 5a7, and its affiliates sold more than 180 undeveloped acres in\nHoffman Estates\nfor $45 million to a Karis venture in February, which is prepping the land for a data center operator.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "An industrial site in Fremont has traded hands in one of the city\u2019s larger recent infill sales in the sector.\nThe 26-acre industrial property at 41777 Boyce Road in Fremont\nsold to a Chicago-based buyer\nfor $70.1 million, the San Francisco Business Times and\nMercury News\nreported. The seller was 41777 Boyce Road LLC, an entity tied to concrete contractor Walters &amp; Wolf, according to the state\u2019s business\ndatabase\n. The buyer was CDECRE LLC, a group\naffiliated\nwith Chicago Deferred Exchange Company.\nThe buyer entity may not be the true owner, however, as it appears to be a company that helps investors complete 1031-exchanges to defer tax costs.\nOther details surrounding the deal were not disclosed. Newmark\u2019s Steven Golubchik, Edmund Najera, Darren Hollak and Brendan Raney represented both the buyer and the seller in the transaction.\nThe Fremont property includes three buildings totaling more than 110,000 square feet. They were built in 1969 and remodeled in 1975. The parcel is zoned for general industrial use, allowing for manufacturing, wholesale operations and other industrial uses, and is surrounded by other industrial properties.\nHow the site will be used by its new owner remains to be seen. The sale \u201cpositions the site to support next-generation advanced manufacturing, powered by exceptional infrastructure and utility access,\u201d Donovan Lazaro, Fremont\u2019s economic development director, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a rare opportunity to connect Fremont\u2019s industrial past with its technological future.\u201d\nFremont overall is an attractive industrial market for investors, with a lower vacancy rate for such properties and a higher number of industrial sites clustered together compared to other cities, according to the Business Times. Earlier this month,\nTishman Speyer bought\nan industrial building at 42701 and 42735 Christy Street in Fremont for $92.9 million.\nLast June, Prologis grew its Bay Area holdings with the purchase of a 177,000-square-foot commercial and industrial building at\n5555 Auto Mall Parkway\nfor $59 million. In October 2024, Prologis\npurchased a four-building office and research park\nat 46859, 46871, 46889 and 46897 Bayside Parkway for $71.3 million. In August 2023, the San Francisco-based firm bought a 246,000-square-foot industrial property at\n48350 Fremont Boulevard\nfor $86.6 million. The same month, Irvine-based CIP Real Estate\nbought the 352,300-square-foot Clipper Court Commerce Center\nindustrial park in Fremont for $103.5 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Francesca\u2019s, the Houston-based women\u2019s boutique chain that once packed malls and lifestyle centers across the country, appears to be winding down operations, a move that could leave hundreds of shopping centers scrambling to fill space.\nWomen\u2019s Wear Daily reported late last week that the retailer is \u201cliquidating our inventory and closing soon,\u201d citing an email from a Francesca\u2019s customer service representative as well as confirmation from vendors, merchants and former buyers. One vendor told WWD it is allegedly owed $250 million in unpaid invoices,\naccording\nto the Houston Business Journal.\nThe company\u2019s website currently advertises a \u201cwarehouse sale,\u201d with all clearance items priced at $15 or less, but makes no explicit mention of liquidation or store closures. Still, the signs point to trouble for a chain that operates more than 450 boutiques across 45 states and employs more than 3,400 people, according to its website. In the Houston area alone, Francesca\u2019s has 16 stores, many embedded in malls and\nopen-air shopping centers\n.\nFounded in Houston in 1999, Francesca\u2019s carved out a niche with small-format boutiques, fast-turn merchandise and a curated feel that appealed to\nsuburban mall shoppers\n. But like many\nspecialty apparel retailers\n, the company struggled as foot traffic softened and e-commerce intensified, according to the outlet. In the years leading up to the pandemic, Francesca\u2019s closed stores, cut jobs and tweaked its merchandising in an attempt to\nstabilize performance\n, ultimately concluding a strategic review in 2019 with a renewed focus on a turnaround plan.\nThe pandemic upended those efforts. The retailer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 2020, emerging two months later after being sold for $18 million to Francesca\u2019s Acquisition, an affiliate of TerraMar Capital, along with Tiger Capital Group and SB360 Capital Group. New ownership attempted to reposition the brand, including launching Franki by Francesca\u2019s, a tween-focused concept, and acquiring wardrobe basics brand Richer Poorer in 2023 to build a multibrand platform, according to the publication.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s as formulaic as a rom-com. Any story about developers revitalizing a downtrodden area will include a paragraph\nlike this\none from the Chicago Tribune:\n\u201cBut the city\u2019s latest reinvention still worries some residents. It\u2019s tough now to afford housing and food, they said. And although the development blueprints look great, hundreds of new, expensive apartments and amenities could remake downtown into a place for the tourists and the affluent, pricing out struggling Kenoshans.\u201d\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: Where the heck is Kenosha?\nIt\u2019s in Wisconsin, by Lake Michigan. For six months of the year it is\nbrutally cold and dark\n. It has a few attractions, but I\u2019ll go out on a limb and predict that it will never be a hotbed of tourism. However, that is not what this column is about.\nIt\u2019s about how revitalization stories always include fears of people being \u201cpriced out.\u201d\nI\u2019ll let you in on a secret: Good journalists have tension in every story. Otherwise, the result is a puff piece that doesn\u2019t show a true picture, because nothing is without tension.\nBut reporting fears of displacement has become a trite way to add tension to development stories. And giving ink to unfounded fears can give them credibility they don\u2019t deserve.\nRemember the fears that cell towers would cause cancer? Totally baseless. But some towns denied their residents cell service for years as a result. Publicizing fears that vaccines are dangerous has reduced vaccination rates, which actually\nis\ndangerous.\nA more realistic tension point for redevelopment stories is the risk that projects will lose money. The Atlantic Yards project generated a ton of coverage about how it would \u201cdestroy\u201d Brooklyn, which it did not, but very little about the chance that its\ndebt would go bad\n, which it did.\nMainstream publications don\u2019t understand project finance so they default to covering protest signs and pitchforks \u2014 and if there aren\u2019t any, they hunt for unhappy people.\nCue the \u201cstruggling Kenoshans.\u201d I\u2019m sure some fear change, but if they are struggling, the status quo is not working for them.\nNew investment\nmight.\n\u201cDowntown Kenosha was nearly dead 20 yrs ago, now there\u2019s everything you could want, except a grocery store,\u201d one resident\ncommented\non Reddit.\nThe New York Times just ran a story about\nJersey City\u2019s revitalization\n. For tension, it quoted a retired basketball coach saying the infrastructure was not keeping up with development and a random, 30-year-old lifelong resident saying her high school classmates \u201chad scattered across the state and country after graduation, driven away by the cost of living.\u201d\nThe basketball coach is not an expert on infrastructure, and the 30-year-old offered no evidence that her classmates left because of high costs. More likely they left because before the\ndevelopment boom\nturned things around, they saw no future in Jersey City.\nLow-income people move a lot. This goes unnoticed unless there\u2019s gentrification going on, in which case their moves are deemed \u201cdisplacement.\u201d In fact, research has shown that poor people are\nless likely to leave\ntheir neighborhood if it is improving.\nThe Times mentioned neither of these things. Instead, it wrote:\n\u201cThe decline in available affordable housing has notably affected Black residents, who on average have less wealth than white families. Between 2013 and 2023, the city\u2019s Black population fell by about 3,000, while its white population grew by about 15,000.\u201d\nWhat decline in affordable housing? The story said the median rent has risen, but that\u2019s because\nnew projects\nadded so many units\nabove the old median\n. The number of\naffordable units\nis actually\nincreasing\n, and older buildings are rent-controlled.\nJersey City\u2019s development boom does not explain why Black people moved. They have also moved from places where development did not boom.\nIndeed, northern cities have experienced a broad decline in Black residents. Some decamped to the suburbs, and as racism in the South receded and opportunity grew for people of color, many\nmoved there\n\u2014 a\nreversal of the Great Migration\n.\nAt least the Times included rebuttals of its conjecture, noting that Mayor Steve Fulop \u201csaid Jersey City remains one of America\u2019s most ethnically diverse cities, and that the drop in Black residents mirrors a dynamic that is playing out across the\nNew York City region\n.\u201d\n\u201cJersey City residents spend less of their income on housing than the state average,\u201d the story added. \u201cHousing experts say that the building boom, whatever its flaws, has made Jersey City much cheaper than it otherwise would be.\u201d\n",

        "content": "An affordable housing nonprofit has put the kibosh on selling some Santa Monica buildings to developer\nLeo Pustilnikov\n.\nAt a Santa Monica City Council meeting last week, officials\ndisclosed\nthat they had privately discussed a potential sale of 419 and 1616 Ocean Avenue, properties controlled by\nCommunity Corporation of Santa Monica\n, the Santa Monica Daily Press reported. Any transaction would require city approval because Santa Monica deeded 419 and 1616 Ocean to the nonprofit in 2016 and retained reacquisition rights.\nAfter the private discussions, Mayor Caroline Torosis said the City had been asked by both CCSM and Pustilnikov to evaluate a potential deal between the parties.\n\u201cThe city discussed the potential real estate transaction in closed session, given that Mr. Pustilnikov is considering other\ninterim [and] transitional housing uses at 413 Ocean\n, including a possible project with the Office of Diversion and Reentry for what has been described to the city as \u2018prisoner housing,\u2019\u201d Torosis said. \u201c[Community Corporation of Santa Monica] has shared that they need the funds that they would accrue from selling 419 Ocean Avenue to help stabilize their operations. Also, Mr. Pustilnikov has indicated that if the city signed off on the transaction, he would forgo any proposed interim [and] transitional housing use at 413 Ocean Avenue.\u201d\n\u201cWe are aware that [Community Corporation of Santa Monica] is also considering selling other properties they own to Mr. Pustilnikov. We have been made aware that [Community Corporation of Santa Monica] and Mr. Pustilnikov are still negotiating potential deal terms for a possible transaction [for 419 and 1616 Ocean],\u201d Torosis said after the meeting.\nShortly thereafter, Community Corporation of Santa Monica pushed back on the mayor\u2019s statement and confirmed that it was no longer in talks with Pustilnikov.\n\u201cCommunity Corporation of Santa Monica is not in negotiations with Leo Pustilnikov to purchase any of our properties,\u201d Tara Barauskas, executive director of Community Corporation of Santa Monica, said. \u201cOn Monday, Jan. 12, the Community Corporation board voted not to engage in any discussions or negotiations with Leo Pustilnikov. Remarks from any other parties suggesting otherwise are inaccurate.\u201d\nThe\naffordable housing\nnonprofit opted not to move forward with any deals and said it does not need to sell properties to maintain operations. It also noted that it was not interested in selling any of its other properties to Pustilnikov and that the organization did not ask the City Council to discuss the situation.\nPustilnikov, for his part, said he spent months talking with Community Corporation of Santa Monica about the potential purchase of 419 Ocean Avenue. The developer said he began discussions when he acquired the rights to the neighboring property at 413 Ocean Avenue, one of two Ocean Avenue sites owned by Pustilnikov that has\ndrawn ire from local residents over supportive housing plans\n, for which 413 Ocean Avenue is zoned.\nPustilnikov said he has not limited potential development to so-called \u201cprisoner housing.\u201d\n\u201cI need to generate a use to hopefully come close to breaking even,\u201d Pustilnikov said. \u201cThere are a number of uses that are permitted due to the unique nature of the property and within what is allowed\u2026 I\u2019ve given the city five uses and tell me what\u2019s least offensive.\u201d\nThe developer is asking the city for its preference but confirmed he would absorb the cost of keeping the buildings vacant if he could purchase more adjacent property. \u201cI\u2019ve said if I can acquire the adjacent site, I don\u2019t mind leaving it vacant for the rest of the term [of any potential deal],\u201d he said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The development would also have 99,000 square feet of commercial space and over 1,000 parking spots.\nRSP Architects designed the project.\nInvoking Live Local allows the developer to build to the maximum height and density allowed in exchange for reserving 40 percent of units for residents\nearning\n$104,000 to $150,000 a year.\nUnits in the workforce tower would span 425 to 900 square feet and include a mix of rentals and for-sale units. The market-rate tower\u2019s units, likely all rentals, would span 510 to 1,400 square feet, plus a few units as big as 2,200 square feet.\nCrescent Heights\u2019 recent success with apartments was behind the decision to make the market-rate units rentals.\nThe developer is seeking a parking reduction, changes to the size of pedestrian entrances and reduced setbacks in a hearing before Miami\u2019s architectural review commission this week, the outlet said.\nThe project builds on Crescent Heights\u2019 momentum in Edgewater, where it built\nForma Miami\n, a 40-story Whole Foods-anchored resi tower, in 2024. It refinanced the 588-unit apartment tower for $238 million last year.\nThe second phase of Forma received approval recently as a\nLive Local project with 278 apartments\n, 101,000 square feet of offices and some retail on a 2-acre site at 220 Northeast 43rd Street.

The council discussed the project for four hours and voted to send the plan to the Landmarks Preservation Commission for review. The plan could win final approval next month.\nThe firm bought the 36,000-square-foot building\nfor $14 million in 2021\n. The seller was Paramount Church, which bought it in 1996 for $3.7 million. The lot spans 1.3 acres, and it is on the National Register of Historic Places, meaning it could qualify for historic tax abatements.\nThe theater was built in 1927 and operated until 1980.

The last time the property was shopped around for a buyer was in 2022, when it was listed for $65 million. In more recent years, the seller was on the hunt for a renter \u2014 and still is. The listing indicates the property could also be leased for $95,000 a month, potentially wooing prospective visitors in town for this summer\u2019s FIFA World Cup.\nAn inquiry to the seller, who placed the estate on a for-sale-by-owner listing site, was not returned Monday.\nProperty records indicate the owner is trustee Bart Loethen and Brigadoon Trust, which paid $18.3 million for the compound in 2007.\nThe property consists of a main house and beach house sitting atop a nearly 3-acre lot. The listing indicates the combined square footage of the residences is 10,438 square feet, which makes the listing price equivalent to $6,515 per square foot.\nThe main house counts six bedrooms, while the beach house has two beds. In all, there are 10 bathrooms across the two structures. One big highlight is access to El Matador Beach via a private staircase.\nThe Pacific Coast Highway property is now the third-priciest single-family home on the market in Malibu, according to listing sites. But it doesn\u2019t best the $110 million price tag for Johnny Carson\u2019s former residence at 6962 Wildlife Road, which pencils out to $15,530 per square foot. That property was listed in September by Compass\u2019 Chris Cortazzo.\nThere\u2019s also Westside Estate Agency\u2019s Kurt Rappaport\u2019s listing at 27832 Pacific Coast Highway, which is priced at $8,490 per square foot, or $74.5 million.\nLast year saw the\noff-market trade\nof an $80 million home at 28719 Grayfox Street, which topped residential deals in the city for 2025. The market activity was quiet relative to 2024, when Malibu was on a tear with blockbuster residential deals.\nAt the top of that heap was the state record set by Oakley founder\nJim Jannard\n, who landed $210 million for the sale of 33064 Pacific Coast Highway. Later that same year, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs\u2019 widow\nLaurene Powell Jobs\nsnapped up her fourth Malibu property at 28106 Pacific Coast Highway for $94 million. Spec developer\nScott Gillen\nalso nabbed the first buyer for his ultra-luxe community The Case in Malibu, trading 24186 Case Court for $61 million.\n",

Fannie Mae received the property in December following the foreclosure sale and quietly put it on the market last week.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good news now that the building is out of the mess of the foreclosure process,\u201d Barbara Gordon, executive director of the\nFrank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy\n, told the Chicago Sun-Times. \u201cNow, we\u2019ve got a clear path to possible ownership for somebody to take this on.\u201d\nWhile the asking price might look modest,\nrestoration costs\nare estimated at $2 million or more, and a recent appraisal pegged the property\u2019s value at just $65,000 in its current condition. Any buyer would also face strict landmark requirements. The house is both a Chicago landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, meaning exterior and interior work must closely replicate Wright\u2019s original design.\nBuilt for printing executive Joseph Jacob Walser, the home fused elements \u2014 strong horizontal lines, deep eaves and bands of windows \u2014 that would later define Wright\u2019s\nPrairie School\nstyle. Variations of the same ideas appear in better-known works like the Emil Bach House on the North Side, the Hills-DeCaro House in Oak Park and projects in Indiana and Buffalo, New York.\nLocal preservation groups, including Landmarks Illinois and Preservation Chicago, have been working since 2020 to stabilize the home. Austin Coming Together, a neighborhood nonprofit, has also been circling the property as part of broader investment in the area, including its $40 million redevelopment of a former CPS school across the street.\nThe group\u2019s executive director, Darnell Shields, criticized the list price as \u201cegregious\u201d given the condition, but told the Sun-Times that he still plans to pursue a purchase and convert the house to community use.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s opening salvo of budget negotiations leaves tax hikes off the table and suggests tweaks to a tax incentive for renovating multifamily housing.\nHochul on Tuesday proposed a $260 billion state budget for fiscal year 2027. Despite pressure from the left to increase corporate and income taxes, the governor kept rates flat, only proposing to extend the top corporate tax rate (7.25 percent) through 2029, according to an overview provided by the governor\u2019s office. The corporate tax rate was slated to expire at the end of this year.\n\u201cThis is not an austerity budget, but it is a disciplined one,\u201d Hochul said during an address on Tuesday.\nDuring his campaign, Mayor Zohran Mamdani called for tax increases as a way to fund his key campaign promises, including free buses and city-owned grocery stores. The city is also staring down an\nestimated $12 billion\nbudget gap this and next fiscal year.\n\u201cIt is time to ask New York City\u2019s wealthiest and large corporations to pay their fair share, while also working toward a fiscal relationship with the State that better reflects New York City\u2019s status as the economic engine of the state,\u201d Mamdani said in a statement, noting that he rejects \u201causterity politics.\u201d\nThe executive budget includes a proposal to reform the tax break J-51, according to a budget book released on Tuesday. The tax abatement is provided to certain owners who renovate their multifamily properties in exchange for keeping the apartments rent-stabilized at least through the duration of the incentive.\nThe City Council\nrenewed\nthe incentive in 2024, more than a year after the state\napproved\na new version of the tax break that limited what buildings would be eligible. The abatement is available for owners of apartment buildings that are at least 50 percent affordable, part of the state\u2019s Mitchell-Lama program or otherwise receiving \u201csubstantial government assistance.\u201d Co-ops and condos are only eligible if each unit\u2019s assessed value does not exceed $45,000.\nThe budget book doesn\u2019t provide details on how the abatement would be changed, however. Landlord groups have criticized the changes to the program made by the state legislature in 2023 that further restricted what buildings qualify for the incentive.\nThis is the final year of the governor\u2019s $25 billion five-year housing plan. The state has created or preserved more than 70,000 housing units so far, and is on track to reach 100,000 by the end of the year. The executive budget includes $250 million to \u201caccelerate new construction of affordable housing units,\u201d and to get a jump on the state\u2019s next housing plan.\nThe new funding will also supplement the expansion of\nfederal housing credits\n.\nDetails of other major initiatives remain unclear. During her State of the State\naddress\nlast week, Hochul unveiled a proposal to exempt most housing projects from the State Environmental Quality Review Act, or SEQRA.\nThe budget book doesn\u2019t include more specifics of this program, though it indicates that she wants to increase Department of Environmental Conservation staffing to \u201caddress general permitting timeframes and backlogs.\u201d Details on non-fiscal policy proposals in the executive budget will be released separately on Tuesday.\nThe proposed budget includes $50 million for the Housing Voucher Access Program, a state-based housing voucher program that serves families or individuals who are homeless or in imminent danger of losing their homes. The funding level is the same as\nlast year\u2019s allocation\n, which fell significantly short of the $250 million sought by advocates.\nAs revealed during her State of the State address, the executive budget incorporates\nlegislation\nintroduced last year that would upgrade felony charges against landlords who systematically harass rent-regulated tenants across multiple buildings or are \u201crepeat serious offenders.\u201d\nThe budget book doesn\u2019t mention property tax reform, nor additional relief for rent-stabilized landlords. Landlord groups have pushed for legislation to allow one-time rent resets in vacant stabilized apartments, but such proposals haven\u2019t progressed in recent years.\nThe majorities in the Senate and Assembly will put forward their own budget proposals before a final spending plan is hashed out.\n",

        "content": "Los Angeles Lakers coach JJ Redick has kept his team\u2019s record afloat this year despite injuries to star players like LeBron James and Austin Reaves.\nThe same can\u2019t be said for the asking price of his Dumbo penthouse. But after dropping the ask to just under $6 million, Reddick found a buyer for the duplex atop 51 Jay Street, according to Compass\u2019 weekly report for contracts signed on homes asking at least $2 million from Jan. 12 to Jan. 18.\nReddick bought the home for nearly $6.1 million in 2017, according to public records. In 2021, he listed the nearly 3,000-square-foot spread for $8.5 million before cutting the price to $7 million in 2022.\nHe took the home off the market for three years before re-listing it in September at $6.2 million and two months later dropping the price one last time.\nFeaturing four bedrooms and four full bathrooms, designer Michael Aiduss redesigned the home in 2019 from a pied-\u00e0-terre to a full-time residence, according to a feature in\nArchitectural Digest\n.\nThe home has a great room with floor-to-ceiling glass windows that leads out to a 2,500-square-foot landscape terrace.\u00a0 The primary suite has its own private terrace, while the upper level has two more bedrooms surrounded by another terrace.\nThe contract was the priciest deal signed in the borough last week.\nCompass\u2019 Rachel Greenstein, Suzanne Koxvold and Toni Nicolo had the listing.\nReddick\u2019s unit is not the only to sell after a series of discounts in the 74-unit building. The last three condos marked as sold on StreetEasy have only traded hands after the seller lowered the asking price to below the price for which they bought the unit.\nPart of the problem sellers have had in recouping a profit might stem from a\n2020 lawsuit\nin which the condo board sued the sponsors, Adam America Real Estate and Slate Property Group, for alleged construction defects. That case is still ongoing, according to recent court filings.\nThe second most expensive contract signed last week was for a Columbia Street Waterfront townhouse at 113A Columbia Street asking $4.4 million.\nThe seller was Emma Fusco-Straub, best-selling author and owner of popular Brooklyn book store Books Are Magic, which has stores in Cobble Hill and Brooklyn Heights, according to public records. Fusco-Straub bought the home for $4.1 million in 2015.\nSpanning 4,000 square feet and featuring five bedrooms and three full bathrooms, the home comes with a multi-car garage with a direct entrance inside. The first three floors have balconies facing the water and the top floor holds a terrace. A private elevator services all floors.\nCompass\u2019 Ria Browne had the listing.\nThe two deals topped an otherwise slow week for the Brooklyn luxury market. The borough scored 10 contracts \u2014 six condos and four houses \u2014 signed from Jan. 13 to Jan. 19 for a total contract volume of $33 million, according to Compass\u2019 weekly report of contracts for homes asking at least $2 million.\nLast\nweek\n, Brooklyn\u2019s luxury market saw 17 deals signed for an average contract volume of $57 million.\nThe homes put into contract last week had a median asking price of $2.9 million, spent an average of 181 days on the market and had an average discount of 3 percent.\n",

        "content": "Amazon is pushing further into brick-and-mortar retail, winning local approval to build its largest store format to date in suburban Chicago \u2014 a move that could reset expectations for how the e-commerce giant uses physical space to compete with Walmart and Target.\nThe village board of trustees in Orland Park voted 5-to-2 on Monday to approve Amazon\u2019s plans for a massive store at the southwest corner of 159th Street and LaGrange Road. CoStar\nreported\nthat the decision clears the way for a 229,000-square-foot building on a 35-acre site, following an earlier signoff from the village\u2019s plan commission.\nThe store would be Amazon\u2019s biggest\nphysical retail\nconcept so far, blending traditional big-box merchandising with a small warehouse component to support on-site operations. Plans call for a broad assortment of goods, including groceries and household staples, positioning the store squarely against established\nbig-box rivals\n.\nOrland Park officials publicly unveiled Amazon\u2019s proposal earlier in January, and the outlet reported that the project is expected to draw close scrutiny from both competitors and retail real estate players, as one of the world\u2019s largest companies experiments with a sprawling, warehouse-sized storefront.\nThe site sits about 25 miles southwest of the Loop, in a heavily trafficked retail corridor near Orland Square mall. Nearby anchors include Costco, Aldi, Jewel-Osco, a Walmart Supercenter and Target \u2014 a lineup that shows how directly Amazon is stepping into the suburban big-box battlefield, according to the publication.\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment on a construction timeline or when the store might open.\nThe approval marks another chapter in Amazon\u2019s uneven but persistent push into physical retail. Since acquiring Whole Foods Market in 2017, the Seattle-based company has tested a rotating cast of store concepts nationwide, including\nAmazon Fresh\n, Amazon Grocery and cashierless Amazon Go locations. Other experiments \u2014 Amazon Books,\nAmazon 4-star\nand Pop Up stores \u2014 have been shuttered as the company refined its approach.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The builder, Ali Sadeghi,\ntook Yuan to court\nover the drawn-out discussion timelines and $37 million construction cost.

        "content": "Wall Street\u2019s growing grip on single-family rentals is increasingly best illustrated in Houston, a Sun Belt market where institutional landlords snapped up thousands of homes after the pandemic and reshaped entire neighborhoods.\nBut housing experts contend that President Trump\u2019s proposal to ban large institutional investors from buying more homes would likely do little to make homes more affordable for Houstonians, the Houston Chronicle\nreported\n.\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s always popular politically to announce that you\u2019re going to slay a Wall Street dragon, this crusade isn\u2019t going to save the princess,\u201d Rick Sharga, president and CEO of CJ Patrick Company, told the outlet. \u201cThe numbers simply aren\u2019t large enough to make a difference.\u201d\nInstitutional investors \u2014 typically defined as landlords owning at least 1,000 homes \u2014 accounted for just 2.9 percent of home purchases nationally in the first nine months of 2025, according to data from Cotality. Trump has said he will flesh out the proposal this month at the World Economic Forum in Davos, though\nthe plan\nwould likely require congressional action and faces major questions about enforcement.\nIn Houston, the investor share of\nrentals\nlooks even smaller when narrowed to the biggest players. While investors overall own about 16.8 percent of the region\u2019s housing stock, or roughly 325,000 homes, large institutional firms control just 12,500 houses, less than 1 percent of all homes in the metro area, Sharga said.\nThat limited share doesn\u2019t mean the impact is evenly spread. Large investors are heavily concentrated in\nspecific neighborhoods\nlike Atascocita and parts of Aldine, where more than 20 percent of single-family rentals were owned by 26 major investment firms as of 2023, according to research by Stephen Avrill Sherman of Rice University\u2019s Kinder Institute for Urban Research.\nStill, Trump administration officials have indicated the proposal would not force investors to sell existing homes, meaning those pockets of high investor ownership would likely remain intact even if a ban moved forward.\nSupporters of a ban argue institutional investors outbid would-be homeowners and crowd them out of starter homes. In theory, restricting that demand could put downward pressure on prices, said Thom Malone, principal economist at Cotality. In practice, he told the publication, other buyers would likely step in.\n\u201cEven if institutional investors disappeared, it probably wouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal,\u201d Malone said, noting that smaller investors could simply replace them.\nSome analysts also point out that many homes targeted by large landlords are older and in need of rehab, properties that may not appeal to typical owner-occupants. Without investor capital, some could sit vacant and deteriorate.\nPotential ripple effects could follow. A ban could cool new home construction if builders anticipate fewer buyers, and it could squeeze renters if the supply of single-family rentals shrinks. About a quarter of\nHouston-area renters\nlive in single-family homes, according to a 2023 Kinder Institute housing report.\nLarge landlords, for their part, say they provide a needed rung on the housing ladder. A spokesperson for Pretium, which owns thousands of Houston-area homes, said the firm offers \u201cquality rental homes in neighborhoods of opportunity\u201d for families saving to buy.\nFor economists, the bigger takeaway is that affordability fixes are slower. Changing zoning rules, boosting supply and expanding down payment assistance don\u2019t make for splashy announcements, said Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather, but they address the root problem.\n\u201cWhen politicians are looking for a quick win on housing, they gravitate to solutions that sound great,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t solve the tough problem of increasing housing supply.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The townhomes will span 1,960 square feet with one-car garages across five two-story buildings. The Riviera Beach City Council is scheduled to vote on the project Wednesday.\nThe development will be market-rate but will target residents earning between 80 and 120 percent of the area median income, said Zach Ciciera, a senior land planner with Cotleur &amp; Hearing, the project\u2019s planning firm. That\u2019s $65,400 to $98,280 a year for one person, according to last year\u2019s HUD guidelines.\nThe developer hasn\u2019t landed on whether to offer the units for sale or as rentals and asked for flexibility in a December hearing with the city\u2019s Planning and Zoning Board, which unanimously backed the proposal.\nCiciera estimated prices of $400,000 to $550,000 for condos or $2,800 to $3,400 a month as rentals.\nIf approved, the developer would have 18 months to start construction and five years to obtain a certificate of occupancy, and it will be required to report its efforts to hire Riviera Beach residents and contract with local businesses.\nSinatra CEO and founder Nicholas Sinatra\u2019s entity paid $2.5 million for the vacant property in September 2023. It\u2019s flanked by two plant nurseries and the\n69-acre Arbor Parc single-family community\nthat was co-developed by Lennar and 13\nth\nFloor.\nIt is across the street from the 16-acre site where South Miami-based the Estate Companies plan to build a 255-unit complex called Soleste on the Trail with apartments between 700 and 1,000 square feet.\nRiviera Beach has attracted real estate investors in recent years, as developers seek frontiers to build in South Florida and city leaders look to grow the tax base and create jobs.\nLarger projects on the drawing board include\nSobelCo\u2019s 1.2 million-square-foot\nmixed-use project at 1117 Broadway and Peter Baytarian\u2019s Forest Development\u2019s two 25-story\nOculina\ncondos at 3700 Broadway. Baytarian also recently\nwon a competitive bid to build a $325 million\nmixed-use development with up to 450 apartments at 1851 Broadway.\nThe Related Group\u2019s\nRelated Urban landed a $100 million construction loan\nin September to build 149 workforce housing units near the city-owned Marina Village area.\nThat project, the eight-story Residences at Marina Village, will be built next to the planned\n20-story Gallery at Marina Village\n, a development by the Related Group, BH Group and Tezral Partners. The city is\ntaking bids from developers\non a nearby 12-acre section of Marina Village.\nMeanwhile, Riviera Beach tapped\nSonnenblick Development for a $481 million redevelopment\nthat will include a new city hall and library, a sports complex and residential development on 72 acres of city-owned land.",

City officials will now review updated plans for a taller development with more units, albeit with commercial portions removed.\nThe Beverly Hills Planning Commission approved the 14-story project last year, but Wilshire Skyline submitted a revised application for a larger development before an Oct. 29 Planning Commission hearing. The new plan calls for a 26-story building with 195 residential units and 252 parking spaces.\nWilshire Skyline pointed to the recent passage of SB 92, which prohibits the inclusion of hotel uses in density bonus projects such as its original proposal, as a looming legal hurdle that could jeopardize the hotel segment\u2019s construction. Initial plans called for a 14-story structure with 116 studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments, including 24 affordable units, as well as a 60-room hotel, about 7,300 square feet of\nground-floor retail\nand subterranean parking for 140 vehicles.\nThe\nBeverly Hills City Council\nadopted a motion to vacate the approval of the original 14-story plan and send the item back to the Planning Commission. City staff did so after acknowledging the applicant\u2019s stated intent to not move forward with the original process. The commission will now have to process Wilshire Skyline\u2019s revised application for the 26-story project.\nWhether or not Wilshire Skyline moves forward using\nbuilder\u2019s remedy,\nwhich allows developers to bypass local zoning and build high-density affordable housing projects to help municipalities reach state housing goals, remains to be seen, though housing is slated for the location regardless. Wilshire Skyline has already received approvals for a smaller eight-story development at the 9229 Wilshire Boulevard site, which\nwould include\n56 one-, two-, three- and four-bedroom units above 7,926 square feet of ground-floor retail and parking for 119 vehicles, Urbanize Los Angeles previously reported.\nAnother developer, Crescent Heights, had a builder\u2019s remedy project\nrejected by the Beverly Hills Planning Commission\nin November.

        "content": "A nearly 29,000-square-foot mansion is going up on the lakefront site of a\nhistoric Winnetka home\nafter the owners received approval last year to demolish it and build a new house.\nThe mansion\u2019s construction is expected to cost $10 million, according to a building permit application obtained by\nThe Real Deal\n, making it one of the most expensive construction projects along the lakefront in Winnetka in recent years.\nShiraz and Vijay Kotte\n, both health care executives, won approval to build the new home at 445 Sheridan Road in Winnetka in June, according to the permit application. The permit application states the new house will be 28,690 square feet, making it among the largest lakefront homes in Winnetka.\nThe couple purchased the Winnetka property, known as the Clement Stone Mansion, in 2023 for $12.3 million, property records show. Design plans for the new home are not available in the permit application, but Vijay Kotte, CEO of Chicago-based GoHealth, told village officials in 2024 it would be a French-style home with a transitional interior, according to meeting records.\nThe new mansion is being designed by architect Michael Hershenson, the permit says. Heritage Luxury Homes, the North Shore builder run by Leo and Milena Birov, is handling general contracting. Neither Hershenson nor Birov responded to requests for comment.\nIt\u2019s not clear how far along the home is in the construction process. The Kottes secured a demolition permit by January of last year, according to Winnetka meeting documents. An Instagram post by a historic preservation blog in August 2025 shows the empty lot after the home had been demolished. Vijay Kotte did not respond to requests for comment.\nBuilt in 1912 by socialite and real estate investor Lena P. Gilmore, the original mansion was a rare example of the Spanish Revival style in Winnetka. The estate featured white stucco walls, a red clay tile roof, and a third-floor ballroom. Throughout its century-long history, the property underwent several renovations, including the addition of a coach house in 1936 and a modern restoration in 2006 that aimed to preserve its historic character.\nThe mansion had a long lineage of notable owners, including hotel magnate Albert Pick and James G. McMillan, president of the Wander Company, which manufactured Ovaltine. W. Stone Clement, an insurance executive and self-help author, purchased the home in 1966 and lived there until his death in 2005.\nThe teardown is\npart of a trend\nalong the lakefront of homeowners scrapping older homes to make way for new mansions with modern styles and amenities, often to the dismay of preservation activists. The construction also ran up against Winnetka\u2019s ordinance limiting construction on or near the bluffs along Lake Michigan. The rule, approved in 2024, was widely viewed as a response to\nbillionaire Justin Ishbia\u2019s\nplans for a sprawling $77 million megamansion on Sheridan Road.\nThe Kottes, through the LLC that owns the home, were previously among\na group of homeowners\nwho sued the city over that ordinance, arguing the rule cut millions of dollars from their property values. But the Kottes ended their involvement in the litigation in December, months after they won approval to build their home, according to court documents.\nIn the 2024 meeting when the village passed the ordinance, Kotte said he would have reconsidered purchasing the home, and the purchase price, had he known the building restrictions would be passed,\nTRD previously reported\n. The new home had to comply with the ordinance\u2019s rules, but little conflict existed over the plans, based on the application materials.\nThe Kottes\u2019 bid to build a new home faced fierce opposition from Winnetka preservation officials, prompting Laura Good, a member of Winnetka\u2019s Historic Preservation Commission, to resign from the board, according to meeting records. The commission does not have authority to block demolition for most properties, but it can \u2014 and did, in this case \u2014 impose a 270-day delay.\nIn a series of meetings in 2024, members of the village\u2019s Historic Preservation Commission said the home was one of the most iconic lakefront homes in Winnetka and asked Kotte to consider renovating or selling the home rather than demolishing it, meeting records show.\nKotte said during the meetings that he had initially planned to rehabilitate the house, but after inspection realized that renovation was not possible, according to meeting minutes. He also said the village\u2019s bluff construction ordinance, adopted after the Kottes bought the home, made additions to it difficult.\nThe home\u2019s \u201cnarrow footprint\u201d and \u201cinadequate floorplan\u201d were other impediments to renovation, Kotte told the commissioners in 2024.\nGood resigned from the commission after the June 17, 2024 meeting, saying her motivation was disappointment at \u201cnot being able to save 445 Sheridan Road from being demolished,\u201d according to meeting minutes.\n",

        "content": "Nursing home operators Daryl Hagler and Kenneth Rozenberg are facing more pressure from a New Jersey state agency for misusing Medicaid funds\nThe New Jersey Office of the State Comptroller sued Hagler and Rozenberg along with their associates for \u201cexploiting the operation\u201d of two nursing homes, the Deptford Center for Rehabilitation and Healthcare and Hammonton Center, according to\nNJ.com\n.\nThe watchdog agency said it found pervasive, systemic and longstanding violations of law and a \u201ctroubling pattern\u201d of profiteering by Hagler, Rozenberg and their associates.\nThe comptroller filed the lawsuit on Monday in Superior Court in Mercer County, according to the report.\nThe lawsuit comes a month after the comptroller\nissued\na report making several troubling allegations about the nursing homes operators.\nIn the report, the comptroller claimed that Rozenberg and Hagler used related parties to inflate rent payments from nursing homes to their property companies. The comptroller also claimed they diverted tens of millions of dollars in Medicaid funding intended for vulnerable residents to themselves, according to NJ.com.\nTo hide their alleged scheme, they reportedly hid these actions through falsified state and federal filings.\nHagler and Rozenberg are both well-known in NYC real estate circles. Hagler has been a backer of Brooklyn dealmaker Isaac Hager. He also has acquired an Astoria commercial property known as the\nCigar Factory\n. Rozenberg\u2019s son owns the Israeli national airline El Al.\nBoth the lawsuit and comptroller\u2019s report highlighted the poor conditions at the New Jersey nursing homes despite the flow of Medicaid payments. The Hammonton and Deptford police reportedly received more than 3,400 emergency calls about the facilities from 2019 to 2024.\nHagler and Rozenberg allegedly moved money off the nursing home books and into their bank accounts through a network of related companies, including Bronx-based Centers for Care, per the comptroller\u2019s report.\nThe agency said the most lucrative scam run by Hagler and Rozenberg was through mortgages and rent payments. This was allegedly done by legally separating the nursing home operations and the nursing home properties (also known as Opco vs. Propco).\nHagler and Rozenberg were allegedly able to combine these two parts of the business to obtain $63.2 million in mortgages, which was more than the actual purchase price, according to the comptroller\u2019s report.\n\u201cThis scheme allowed Hagler and Rozenberg to purchase and own the nursing homes for nearly nothing, a mere 1.5 percent deposit,\u201d the New Jersey Office of the State Comptroller said in its report.\nRozenberg and Hagler did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\u2014\nKeith Larsen\n",

The Newport-Mesa Family YMCA site is located next to the Upper Newport Bay Nature Reserve and currently holds an approximately 18,000-square-foot fitness center and a pool.\nYMCA officials hope to expand the main facility to 51,000 square feet and install new amenities including a cafe, aquatics center, gymnasium, teaching kitchen, children\u2019s areas and educational facilities. In addition, the Y, which owns the site, is looking to build 105 multifamily housing units for residents aged 55 and older. Parking for 424 vehicles, including 300 for the larger YMCA, would also be built. The 105-unit\nsenior housing\nbuilding, dubbed the Perch Residences, is expected to be 134,499 square feet.\nAdding senior housing to the Newport Beach Y is part of the organization\u2019s \u201cNewport Hub\u201d project, which \u201cblends private residential amenities with shared access to expansive recreational facilities\u201d to create \u201ca dynamic community hub, supporting the city\u2019s housing goals, affordable housing needs and broad recreational demands \u2014 including aquatic programs \u2014 while enriching lives across generations,\u201d according to the project\u2019s\nwebsite\n.\nThe Newport-Mesa YMCA is adjacent to the Bay Corporate Plaza office complex on University Drive.

        "content": "A fast-growing freight brokerage is betting on downtown Chicago again, more than doubling its office space as it makes room for what could be another 200 jobs in the city\u2019s core.\nTransLoop signed a sublease for 44,457 square feet at the building at\n350 North Orleans Street\n, where it will relocate its headquarters next month from roughly 17,000 square feet at 1 South Wacker Drive,\naccording\nto Crain\u2019s. The firm is taking over the entire ninth floor from research and advisory company Gartner, whose sublease runs through May 2029.\nThe move adds to a recent run of office expansions by\ntransportation and logistics firms\n, a sector that has quietly become one of downtown Chicago\u2019s brighter spots as office vacancy remains elevated. The outlet reported that Chicago has long been a national hub for freight and shipping intermediaries, and the sector expanded rapidly after 2020 as e-commerce growth forced companies to rethink supply chains.\nTransLoop\u2019s new space could accommodate up to 200 additional employees locally, according to CBRE, which represented the company in the lease. The firm has been scaling quickly: TransLoop said its sales jumped 46 percent in 2025, year-over-year, to more than $255 million. CBRE brokers Brian McDonnell and Bill Sheehy negotiated the lease.\nWhile TransLoop isn\u2019t leasing directly from the owner of the building at\n350 North Orleans\n, the deal is a vote of confidence for a riverfront building whose future has been anything but settled. An affiliate of New York-based private equity giant Blackstone Group failed to pay off the property\u2019s $310 million mortgage when it matured in 2023, pushing the property into distress.\nThe building is now controlled by real estate firm Trigild as receiver, with KeyBank acting as special servicer on the loan for bondholders. The debt was bundled into commercial mortgage-backed securities when Blackstone refinanced the property in 2018.\nTransLoop\u2019s sublease follows another recent expansion in the building by online payments company\nStripe\n, signs that tenants remain willing to commit to the property despite the ownership limbo, according to the publication.\nThe deal also serves as an example of how sublease space continues to shape downtown leasing. Sublease availability is down sharply from its pandemic-era peak, though CBRE data shows downtown sublease space ticked up in the fourth quarter for the first time in two years, driven in part by Walgreens Boots Alliance listing its entire leased space in the Old Post Office.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Texas is on track to become the largest data center market in the U.S. within three years, as artificial intelligence turbocharges demand for power, land and infrastructure across the state.\nThat\u2019s the conclusion of a new report released Tuesday by Bloom Energy, a California-based provider of onsite power generation systems for data centers. The Texas Tribune\nreported\nthat the report found that grid demand from Texas data centers alone is expected to exceed 40 gigawatts by 2028, a staggering jump from today\u2019s levels and an amount that would put the state ahead of every other market in the country.\nFor context, data centers in Texas had a maximum power demand of about 8 gigawatts in 2025, compared with the state\u2019s peak grid demand of 94 gigawatts, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages the grid. One gigawatt is enough to power roughly 700,000 homes for a year.\nTexas is already home to about 387 data centers, but the pipeline is swelling fast. Over the past year, companies including Google, Nvidia and Anthropic announced major projects in the state, along with ventures tied to former Google CEO\nEric Schmidt\nand Rick Perry\u2019s\nFermi REIT\n. Texas is also expected to capture part of\n\u201cProject Stargate,\u201d\na $400 billion joint venture between Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank aimed at building out AI infrastructure over the next three years.\nDevelopers\nare flocking to Texas for familiar reasons: abundant land, relatively low costs and easy access to natural gas in a regulatory environment friendlier to new power generation than coastal markets. Bloom Energy projects Texas\u2019 data center growth will outpace all other states, leapfrogging traditional hubs like Oregon and California, where restrictions on new gas-fired power plants are tighter.\n\u201cAs you think about onsite generation, no matter where you are in the U.S., 100 percent of onsite generation is largely happening with natural gas \u2014 and Texas certainly has a lot of access,\u201d Bloom Energy\u2019s chief commercial officer, Aman Joshi, told the outlet.\nThe scale of projects is also ballooning. By 2030, one in five data centers nationwide is expected to exceed 1 gigawatt in maximum energy demand. By 2035, that ratio climbs to one in three, according to the report, underscoring how AI workloads are reshaping both real estate and energy planning.\nCapital is already pouring in. As previously reported in\nThe Real Deal\n, more than $3.4 billion in new data center construction projects were registered in Texas in 2025, according to filings with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. In December alone, new projects\u2019 construction budgets totaled more than $1.4 billion.\nBut Bloom Energy\u2019s analysis also flags a growing disconnect between data center developers and power providers. As demand surges, grid interconnections are becoming harder to secure and more expensive.\n\u201cPower can no longer be treated as a downstream consideration,\u201d the report stated, warning that developers who plan around traditional grid assumptions risk delays and downsized projects.\nTo get around those constraints, more operators are pairing data centers with onsite power generation, including natural gas plants and fuel cells like those made by Bloom Energy. About one-third of all data centers are expected to have onsite generation by 2030.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The complex purchase was finalized last month, property records and listing websites show. The final sale price is unavailable, but the properties were listed for about $28.5 million altogether.\nThe smaller of the two tracts, the Firewater Ranch, is a 524-acre property that produces hay and includes a 14-acre lake stocked with bass and bluegill, according to the listing. Icon Global listed the property for $8.5 million, about $16,000 per acre. The seller is Dallas investor Dean MacFarlan, records show.\nThe larger tract, dubbed the K6, accounts for the lion\u2019s share of the price. Hall and Hall broker Brett Grier listed the property for just under $20 million, amounting to almost $23,000 per acre. The seller, real estate\ndeveloper\nChad Krippner, spent the last three years adding\nequestrian facilities\n, a pickleball court and a 5,200-square-foot timber frame home to the property. The home includes a pool, a gym and an outdoor kitchen, according to the listing.\n\u201cMost ranches like that, when they have that much improvements on them, they don\u2019t come up for sale for 10 or 15 years,\u201d Grier said.\nThe K6 farm also produces between 400 and 500 bales of coastal Bermuda hay yearly, he added.\nThe land is north of Mineral Walls and just east of Highway 281. Mineral Wells is about an hour west of Fort Worth.\nWalt and Joc Greeman acquired the land through a 1031 exchange facilitated by PSI Exchange Holdings, a Midland, Texas-based company, public records show. Krippner and MacFarlan sold their tracts to PSI Exchange Holdings in July and October, respectively, before PSI conveyed the land to the Greemans\u2019 company. PSI specializes in 1031 exchanges.\nTheir Oklahoma farm is now for sale. Icon Global is marketing the 1,567-acre property near Tishomingo for $9.4 million.\nFort Worth is a prominent hub for rodeo and horse sports, boosting value for land fitted with equestrian facilities. An 860-acre horse ranch near Weatherford, about halfway between Mineral Springs and Fort Worth, recently sold after asking $43 million.\n",

That works out to\n75 percent\nof the bid being debt-financed. There is no payment required on the loan principal for two years.\nSummit has said it will have extra cash flow because it\u2019s been able to lower the debt on the portfolio as well as lower the interest rate on that debt.\nThe loan will have a fixed\n5.25 percent interest rate\n, lower than the\nrates of 7.5 and 10.25 percent\nthat Pinnacle says it paid at times.\n23 percent NOI boost\nSummit expects the purchase to boost its net operating income, meaning revenue after expenses but not debt service, by\n23 percent.\nThe portfolio itself is expected to make\n$36 million in net operating income\nannually. That\u2019s approximately\n8 percent of the purchase price.\n5,150 units\nThe portfolio consisted of\n5,150 residential units\nacross 98 buildings. But also part of the holdings are\n52 commercial units\n,\n326 parking spaces\nand\none parking garage\n.\nThe buildings are\n95 percent occupied,\nwith about\nhalf in Brooklyn\n,\none-quarter in Manhattan\nand\n18 percent in Queens\n.\nThe sale is expected to close in\nFebruary\n.\n$30 million in capital expenditures\nSummit chair Zohar Levy has said he expects to spend\n$10 million\non the portfolio in the first year, with\n$3 million\nof that for addressing existing violations and the other\n$7 million\nfor a maintenance backlog.\nLevy said he expects to clear half of the existing violations in the\nfirst two months,\nwith the rest cleared within\nsix months of the sale\n.\nHe expects to spend\n$5 million\non maintenance for the next four years, coming out to a total of\n$30 million over five years\n.\n",

        "content": "Some notions become so ingrained in our thinking that we don\u2019t realize they are wrong.\nWhen someone comes along with a better way, people either cling to misguided beliefs or change. What are the consequences of failing to evolve?\nIn sports, the results show up on the scoreboard. Teams, coaches and players who adopt better strategies, techniques, training methods and equipment start winning. Those who don\u2019t disappear, along with the old ways.\n\u201cMoneyball\u201d is now called analytics, and it\u2019s in every sport. That\u2019s why NFL coaches no longer punt on 4th-and-1 past midfield, and NBA teams attempt 37 three-pointers per game, up from 9 in 1992-93.\nIt exists in real estate as well.\nWhen I spoke last week to Vanbarton principal Richard A.C. Coles to prepare for our Jan. 29\nSalon Series interview\n, he said the firm can outbid others on conversion plays because Vanbarton has learned how to do them more efficiently.\nThe methods Vanbarton uses to maximize livable space and minimize cost when turning offices into apartments will eventually predominate because the firms that practice them can bid the highest for sites.\nElected officials are slower to evolve. Unlike in sports and business, there is no scoreboard or bidding process to speed up the process of natural selection. We rely on voters to oust leaders with outdated thinking. Elections are an indirect, imperfect way to improve policy.\nJust to take one of many examples:\nState Sen. Brian Kavanagh and Assembly member Sarahana Shrestha are\npushing a bill\nto make it easier for localities to adopt rent stabilization, a system that since 1974 has made a mess of New York City\u2019s housing market.\nIf a tennis player today tried to compete with a 1974 approach \u2014 wood racket, minimal training, no nutritionist and outdated tactics \u2014 he would be crushed. But Kavanagh and Shrestha, seeking to expand a failed housing strategy, will be re-elected this year. They might not even have an opponent.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nRep. Maxine Waters, in a\nstatement\nsupporting a\ngood\n, bipartisan\nhousing bill\n, said, \u201cToo many families are one rent increase away from losing their homes.\u201d\nThat probably wasn\u2019t intended as a potshot at landlords, but it did seem to say that they trigger homelessness by hiking the rent. That is typically not how it happens.\nHomelessness results when people in tight housing markets suffer a financial or personal setback, stop paying their current rent and cannot easily find a new place. The top two explanations people give when seeking shelter beds in New York City are domestic violence and eviction.\nHave you heard of anyone becoming homeless because of a rent increase? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Several weeks after a deed is recorded in New York City, the owner may receive a\ndeceptive\n\u201cRECORDED DEED NOTICE\u201d from a California company called Property Site. It requests $128 and has a \u201cdetach and mail\u201d section at the bottom of the page. In return, duped property owners receive a \u201cproperty assessment profile\u201d \u2014 which consists of information\navailable for free\nfrom the city.\nElsewhere\u2026\nWith the legislative session underway in Albany, the city can ask for the $70 billion in bonding authority that Mayor Zohran Mamdani said during his campaign he needs for his $100 billion, 200,000-unit, union-built affordable housing program.\nOr, realizing that Gov. Kathy Hochul is not willing to let the city borrow so much, Mamdani could omit it from his Albany wish list this year.\nI doubt the mayor will give up on his dream of building low-rent housing with union labor. He mentioned it just the other day. But something has to give, because Hochul is focused on funding child care and her own housing initiatives, and Mamdani, even with a no-limit credit card, cannot build 200,000 units in 10 years at $500,000 apiece.\nHow close to those numbers can he get? The state\u2019s Vital Brooklyn project provides a clue.\nJust last month, developers L+M Development Partners, Services for the UnderServed, Apex Building Group and RiseBoro finished Alafia Phase 1, a $387 million project with 576 affordable homes in East New York. It also has a 15,000-square-foot clinic and 7,800-square-foot supermarket space, but just dividing the total cost by the number of units comes to $672,000 apiece.\nMamdani\u2019s 10-year timeline might be even less realistic. The request for proposals that yielded Alafia Phase 1 was issued in 2018. The mayor needs to build 347 projects of that size. Better get cracking.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$21 million\nfor a 4,585-square-foot condominium unit at 505 West 19th Street in Chelsea. The property last sold for $17.9 million in 2016. Trish Riedel, Keren Atzlan and Jonathan Isaacs with Reserve Real Estate had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$10 million\nfor a 6,750-square-foot house of worship at 726 40th Street in Sunset Park. Christian Heritage Ministries sold the property to Royal Builders.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$16.8 million\nfor a 7,190-square-foot condominium unit at 1355 1st Avenue in Lenox Hill. Its last sale price was\n$20.7 million\nin August 2015. Stacey Alvarez of the Sukenik Glazer Team at Compass has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 47,717-square-foot, 70-unit project at 2660 Kingsbridge Terrace in University Heights. Leandro Dickson filed the permit on behalf of the Vaja Group.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

Suzanne Frisbie and Liz Callahan with the Corcoran Group had the penthouse listing.\nThe next most expensive single-family home to find a buyer last week was the 7,600-square-foot waterfront home at 614 Tarpon Way asking $34.5 million.\nRecords show the seller is the family of the late George Cohon, best known as the first international franchisee of McDonald\u2019s and the man who brought the Big Mac to Russia. He and his wife, Susan Cohon, bought the half-acre property for $3.4 million in 1997, property records show. It was built in 1996 and includes six bedrooms, six bathrooms, one half-bathroom, a pool and 295 feet of waterfront, according to records and the listing.\nThe property is adjacent to Tarpon Island, the private island Australian billionaire Michael Dorrell bought from spec developer Todd Glaser and his partners for\n$150 million\nin 2024.\nThe Cohons listed the Tarpon home on Jan. 7 and went into contract six days later, Zillow shows. Frisbie has the listing.",

Rhodes paid $3 million for the one-story building and the parking lot in 2014.\nThe portfolio had been on the market since 2022 when Rhodes listed the properties for a combined\n$28 million\n. The latest sale closed slightly below the original asking price, but it reflects the staying power of Wynwood\u2019s investment appeal.\nA flurry of recent deals in Wynwood underscores the neighborhood\u2019s draw for big investors.\nGWealth bought the upper two floors of the three-story Wynwood Sky Office Building at 1900 Northeast Miami Court for\n$23.5 million\nlast year. The same brokers in that transaction worked the latest deal.\nBillionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin teamed up with Goldman Properties this month to acquire 545 Wyn, an office building at 545 Northwest 26th Street developed by Chicago-based Sterling Bay, for more than\n$180 million\n. The troubled Sterling Bay likely made a hefty profit after paying off a $135 million loan obtained in 2022 to refinance a previous $81 million construction loan.\u00a0Also this month, Wynwood\u2019s largest property owner Moishe Mana dropped\n$33.5 million\nfor a pair of vacant parcels at 2661-2701 Northwest Fifth Avenue from David Edelstein\u2019s TriCap and Robert Levine\u2019s Ral Development.

An analysis by\nThe Real Deal\nfound $77 million in purchases by Brenneman tied to the 13 properties across several different counties and two states. Prior to the purchase, the company owned 28 million of industrial space across the Midwest, the release stated.\nBrennan took out a $59 million loan from Bank of America to fund the portfolio purchase, records show.\nAlmost all of the properties were sold by New York-based InvestCorp, which had assembled 11 of the buildings for a combined $48 million in 2019. The total price of the 11 properties that InvestCorp sold to Brennan totaled $64 million,\nTRD\n\u2019s analysis of public records found.\nSan Francisco-based Farallon Capital Management sold the two Milwaukee properties in the portfolio to Brennan for $13 million.\nBrennan previously partnered with Investcorp on deals in the area, including in a venture that sold an industrial property in\nElk Grove Village\nin 2024 for $37 million to data center developer EdgeConnex, and Brennan also snagged a $63 million loan to refinance an industrial property near\nO\u2019Hare International Airport\nlast year that likely let it buy out Investcorp\u2019s interest in the property.\nThe properties in the recently sold portfolio are:\n1890 Suncast Road, Batavia\n951 North Raddant Road, Batavia\n401-431 Raddant Road, Batavia\n2435 Curtiss Street, Downers Grove\n10321 Werch Street, Woodridge\n2 Territorial Court, Bolingbrook\n552 Taylor Road, Romeoville\n1070 Northpoint Boulevard, Waukegan\n65 Ambrogio Drive, Gurnee\n407-409 Washington, Mundelein\n401 Terrace Drive, Mundelein\n8301 Parkland, Milwaukee\n130 West Edgerton, Milwaukee\nThe transaction is a sign of confidence from industrial specialist Brennan in the Midwest market. The sector went through\na building boom\nduring and just after the pandemic that has since slowed.\nBut lease absorption rates in the Chicago area show that even as new properties hit the market, sellers and landlords are finding demand.\nNet\nabsorption improved significantly\nin 2025, according to a year-end report from Savills. In 2024, about 400,000 more square feet of industrial space was leased than vacated. In the last quarter of 2025, that figure jumped up to 7.3 million square feet.\nJust last week,\nThor Equities cashed out of an industrial spec development\nin suburban Chicago.\u00a0 The New York-based developer sold its 109,000-square-foot industrial building to Irvine, California-based LBA Logistics for $21.4 million in a deal recorded on Friday, public documents show.\nIn the last quarter of 2022 alone, nearly 40 million square feet of industrial space was under construction in the Chicago area, far more than today, Savills found. Now, the pipeline is showing signs of stabilizing. During the last quarter of 2025, about 13 million square feet of industrial properties was under construction in the Chicago area. Much of that activity was driven by a boost in\ndata center development\n, according to Savills.",

People living at 347 Eddy Street, 1029 Geary Street and five other properties were hit with the eviction notices.\nIn 2023, Mosser Companies\ndefaulted on the loan\nit used to buy the buildings, leading to a receiver being appointed to manage the properties during foreclosure proceedings. As part of the new ownership arrangement, tenants \u2014 largely non-English speakers \u2014 were allegedly unknowingly required to switch from paper checks for rent payments to an online portal. They reportedly continued to pay rent by check, and one tenant claimed that their payments had been cashed for the months last year that the eviction lawsuit against him said he hadn\u2019t paid.\nAfter\nMosser\u2019s default\nand the receiver appointment, in 2024,\nEl Segundo\n-based TerraCotta Multi bought the loan on the portfolio for about $61 million. A spokesperson for TerraCotta Multi told the Chronicle the company is \u201ccommitted to working with\u202four\u202ftenants\u202fto find solutions and keep people in their homes wherever possible\u201d and noted that the company did not take official ownership of the properties until Nov. 20 of last year, approximately two months after the evictions lawsuits were filed.\n\u201cWe have successfully reached\u202fresolutions with several tenants\u202fin recent\u202fmonths,\u202fand we are in active discussions with a number of tenants currently,\u201d the spokesperson said, urging tenants who receive a notice for nonpayment or believe there is an error in their payment history to contact their property manager.\nTerraCotta and Mosser are currently involved in litigation over tenant security deposits that have seemingly disappeared. TerraCotta said in court filings that the security deposits from tenants in 12 formerly\nMosser\n-owned properties, including 347 Eddy Street, should total $578,676, but Mosser\u2019s accounts dedicated to the funds only showed a total of $2,120 in deposits. TerraCotta also claims that the amount of rent the receiver was collecting \u201ccannot be reconciled with the financial records and rent rolls provided to TerraCotta, such that it is unclear if rental income is being withheld from TerraCotta.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

That proximity aims to give the project very low latency \u2014 or the time delay between when information is sent and when it is received \u2014 a key selling point for users reliant on cloud computing networks and AI, according to the release. The Infomart was built in the 1980s, developed by the\nTrammell Crow\nCompany, and originally spanned 1.6 million square feet.\nCrow\nand\nCleanArc\nare pitching the project as a rare\nDallas\ninfill opportunity, combining secured power, a dedicated on-site substation and flexible building configurations. The full buildout could reach 245 megawatts, with the initial 70-megawatt building already in design and the equipment procurement process underway.\nCleanArc, founded by data center veteran James Trout, will handle development and leasing. The firm is currently constructing close to 1 gigawatt of capacity in\nVirginia\nand its leadership team has worked on more than 2 gigawatts of mission-critical facilities, according to the firm.\nThe project marks a significant step in its broader digital infrastructure push for\nCrow Holdings\n, as the firm said it is evaluating more than 3 gigawatts of potential data center capacity nationwide, with prospective projects in markets including New Jersey, Georgia and North Carolina.\nDemand for data centers across Dallas-Fort Worth was up significantly in 2025, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield, accounting for 21 percent of new demand in warehouse and distribution properties in the market. As previously reported in\nThe Real Deal\n, a CBRE report projects data center inventory in the metroplex will more than double by the end of 2026.\nProjects in the pipeline include an $880 million investment in a new facility at Google\u2019s existing Midlothian campus, and the first \u201cProject Stargate\u201d campus \u2014 a $400 billion joint venture between Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank \u2014 that opened in Abilene in 2025.\n",

Fannie Mae filed the five suits in Escambia County Circuit Court on Dec. 8.\nThe properties in question are:\nLorient Apartments, at 110 Creekside Court;\nOverlook Apartments, at 1200 Scenic Highway;\nPapillon Apartments, at 7270 Hilburn Road;\nAscend at Pensacola Bay Apartments, at 800 Scenic Highway; and\nPalmiere Apartments, at 4435 Marlane Drive.\nLurin borrowed nearly $60 million in January 2024 and stopped making payments in October 2025, Fannie Mae claims. The lender also accuses Lurin of neglecting the properties and allowing liens to pile up against them.\nFannie Mae is asking the court to foreclose on the properties and demand payment of the unpaid principal on the loans, interest and attorneys\u2019 fees. It also asked the court to appoint a receiver to manage the properties but withdrew the requests on Dec. 23. The filing does not specify a reason.\nThe suits mark the second state in which Fannie Mae has sued Lurin Capital. It claimed in a Nov. 6 Texas District Court filing that\nLurin Capital defaulted on a $77.2 million loan\ntied to Latitude 2976, a 734-unit Houston apartment complex at 201 and 301 Wilcrest Drive.\nThe bottom has fallen out for Lurin Capital, whose multifamily properties have mostly been lost to foreclosure or are in receivership.\nDistress ramped up for Venetos\u2019 firm in the spring, when Acore Capital Mortgage accused Lurin of defaulting on nearly $400 million in loans tied to 12 properties in Florida. In a series of October lawsuits, Acore claimed that Venetos personally guaranteed the money he borrowed from the lender and\nstill owes $81 million\n.\nVista Bank\nand\nKeybank\nalso filed lawsuits claiming defaults. Their claims include fraud. Keybank alleged Venetos transferred $24,570 from his accounts with the bank to a personal account. Vista accused him of falsifying account statements from the lender in an attempt to take out loans elsewhere. Former employees have also come out to accuse Lurin of lying on loan reimbursement requests to lenders by inflating costs of repairs and submitting invoices for work that wasn\u2019t done.\nCities are also suing the firm over conditions at the properties it still controls.\nIn November, the firm was hit with a\ntemporary restraining order\nthat ordered residents of a Lurin-owned property in Plano to vacate due to unsafe conditions, including lack of access to water, sewer or gas.\nLurin was\nsued by the city of Huntsville\n, Alabama on Jan. 2.\u00a0 The city claims Lurin has abandoned The Flats at Redstone, a 231-unit property at 2022 Golf Road, and that the state of the building \u201cposes a substantial risk of illness or injury to anyone who enters the property,\u201d\nThe lawsuits are still pending.\n",

BH is the latest developer to make a play for the waterfront property after prior bids failed.\nAging condos across South Florida face mounting repair costs and tougher reserve rules in the wake of the Champlain Towers South collapse, making buyouts tempting for sellers.\nBuilt in the late 1960s, The Mutiny is a Miami landmark infamous for its run between the 1970s and 1980s as a celebrity and\ndrug kingpin\nhangout before falling into disrepair and closing down. It reopened as a condo-hotel in 1998, featuring units ranging from under 600 square feet to a 3,300-square-foot penthouse, with many condo and hotel units having views of Biscayne Bay.\nBH\u2019s offer matched a previous offer by New York-based Slate Property Group last year, and the proceeds would be allocated by each owner\u2019s pro-rata share. Miami-based DaGrosa Capital made an undisclosed offer that fell through in 2024.\nBH\u2019s Isaac Toledano did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe firm is among the most active buyers of potential South Florida development sites. BH teamed up with Mast Capital in targeting another Coconut Grove condominium last year. The joint venture paid\n$20 million\nfor more than 75 percent of units at the 39-unit Bayshore Park, at 2545 South Bayshore Drive in Miami.\nMore recently, BH got into a legal tussle with developer\nGlenn Straub\nto force the sale of a shuttered golf course in Wellington. In a still pending lawsuit filed in Palm Beach County in December, BH alleged it was ready to close on the\n$21 million\ndeal for the 150.5-acre site when Straub allegedly backed out.\n\u2013 Francisco Alvarado",

Cerritos-based McDonald Packaging sold the building for $31.8 million, or $260 per square foot, according to CoStar records cited by the Business Journal. CBRE\u2019s Chip Wright and Ross Fippinger brokered the deal.\nThe structure was reported to be empty at the time of the sale.

The new owner expects about 110 small businesses to move into the facility. Spaces will range between 200 and 2,000 square feet with leases ranging from six to 12 months secured with \u201cone simple monthly payment instead of complex triple-net leases,\u201d the company said.\n\u201cUnlike traditional industrial buildings that cater to large tenants, these are right-sized warehouses for Orange County entrepreneurs and small business \u2014 offering features typically reserved for larger facilities: loading docks, drive-in access, climate control and shared conference rooms,\u201d WareSpace said, according to the Business Journal. The firm is \u201csolving the warehouse space problem for small businesses who need professional infrastructure without the complexity of traditional industrial leases,\u201d CEO Levi Cohen said in a\nstatement\n.\nThe revamped WareSpace property is expected to open this fall.\nWareSpace structures typically include a mix of shared amenities, conference rooms and lounge areas. City of Industry-based Cubework has a similar coworking-esque setup in its industrial properties, which include Orange County locations in\nIrvine\nand Buena Park.\nLast month, another industrial building in Santa Ana changed hands in an eight-figure transaction.

American Eagle vacated its 200,000-square-foot lease, but the retailer is still making payments until the expiration of its lease this year.\nManhattan office leasing reached pre-pandemic levels\nin the fourth quarter\n, posting its\u00a0 strongest quarter since late 2019 with 11.9 million square feet in leases, according to Colliers.

Residents will be able to buy memberships and a la carte services to maintain their car collections, including \u201cdiscreet\u201d vehicle delivery to \u201cprivate airports, social events, or restaurants,\u201d according to the release.\nPrestige is based in North Miami Beach and was founded in 1977 by David\u2019s late father, Irv David. It is one of the largest dealerships for luxury, exotic and supercars in North America and one of three licensed Pagani dealers in the country.\nHamaoui\u2019s Riviera Horizons\nlaunched sales\nof the 28-story, 70-unit Pagani Residences slated for 7940 West Drive in North Bay Village in 2024. Prices start at $3.7 million, and construction is expected to finish in 2028.\nIt is one of a growing number of luxury condo projects boasting luxury vehicle brands, including Gil Dezer\u2019s\nPorsche Design Tower\nand his planned\nBentley Residences\n.

Western Digital has a long-term lease in both buildings, though details around the lease terms and whether it plans to relocate in the future were not disclosed.\nMorgan Stanley Investment Management bought the Osgood Road site using funds managed by Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investing.

An entity run by Christina K. Wong, president of Asian food provider Golden Star Trading,\nacquired\nthe asset, Commercial Observer reported.\nThe buyer secured a $91 million loan from\nMadison Realty Capital\nfor the acquisition.\nClothing company Next Level Apparel leases the entire property, which contains approximately 15,000 square feet of offices.\nThe Klabin Company\u2019s Tyler Rollema and Matt Stringfellow\nrepresented the buyer in the sale.\nThe building fetched a higher-than-usual $463 per-square-foot price. The average sale price for industrial facilities in Los Angeles County was $385 per square foot in the fourth quarter, according to Kidder Mathews data cited by the Business Journal. \u201cMy client admittedly paid a premium for the opportunity to buy a building of this class and size in a premier location,\u201d Rollema said.\nLink Logistics\u2019 Crenshaw Boulevard sale is the latest industrial transaction in Torrance in less than a month. In late December,\nEQT Exeter Real Estate Income Trust acquired\na 76,007-square-foot warehouse for $51.5 million.\nIn the fourth quarter,\nTorrance\nhad a higher industrial vacancy rate compared to other South Bay cities and Los Angeles County as a whole. The South Bay submarket\u2019s vacancy rate was 5.7 percent, while Torrance\u2019s was 8.4 percent, according to Colliers data cited by the Business Journal. The elevated figure can likely be attributed to a spike of new industrial facilities completed in the area last year rather than a decline in demand for space, Rollema said.\n\u201cTorrance has become a destination for growing aerospace, high-tech, automotive-EV and advanced manufacturing users,\u201d Rollema said. \u201cPart of this draw is due to the city\u2019s amenities, overall image and safety, business-friendly environment and proximity to beach cities for their high-skilled employee base.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

California-based KBS\nowns\nthe 2009-built property, and Savills had the listing.\nThe deal appears to be an expansion for ByteDance, which leased 125,000 square feet of the 32-story 300 Colorado Street in Downtown Austin in early 2022, Chron\nreported\nat the time. It later\noffered the space up on the sublease market\nand then relented,\npulling the listing a few months later\n. State filings show ByteDance switched gears and planned a $29 million renovation of the space, a three-phased project that was slated to be completed in early 2025.\nTikTok\u2019s\nAustin office space\nsaga coincided with the federal government\u2019s ongoing attempts to ban the social media platform. After President Donald Trump ordered ByteDance to divest from the app in his first term, the Biden administration reversed the order. Then Congress passed a law that set a deadline for ByteDance to sell the app. Trump started his second term with an extension; the parties reached a deal in the fall to spin off the app\u2019s U.S. operations to a group controlled by investors, including Larry Ellison\u2019s Oracle.\nIndeed, on the other hand, is a victim of the rapid boom and bust of tech in Austin that took place between 2020 and 2023. The company was saddled with nearly 800,000 square feet of Austin office space spread across three high-profile buildings, chunks of which have been languishing on the sublease market since the summer of 2023.\nEven so, tech is expected to play a major role in the Austin office market in 2026, JLL said in its fourth-quarter report.\nTech companies accounted for the three largest leases of the quarter, which posted a positive office absorption of 23,700 square feet.\nVMware renewed its lease\nfor nearly 135,000 square feet at River Place; TikTok\u2019s sublease at Domain Gateway ranked second; and\nNvidia\nrenewed its 79,000-square-foot lease at The Crossing at Lakeline.\nTech companies make up nearly a third of tenants for pre-leased projects in the pipeline, according to JLL.\n",

The problem: The listing wasn\u2019t real.\nThe J.J. Walser House, a deteriorating Wright-designed landmark on Central Avenue in the Austin neighborhood, popped up on Zillow priced at $350,000, drawing quick attention from preservationists, neighbors and the real estate-curious. But the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy and a local nonprofit working to save the home say the listing was illegitimate,\naccording\nto Crain\u2019s.\n\u201cThis shows why we need to protect a vulnerable property like this,\u201d conservancy executive director\nBarbara Gordon\ntold the outlet. With ownership tied up in a prolonged\nforeclosure\nprocess, she said, \u201csomebody found a hole\u201d and appears to be trying to exploit it.\nFannie Mae, which took ownership of the property after a December foreclosure auction, confirmed the groups\u2019 findings through a spokesperson, adding that steps were being taken to remove the unauthorized listing. The agency said it is clearing debris and preparing the home for an eventual legitimate sale, though no timeline has been announced, according to the publication.\nThe mystery listing appeared only on Zillow and its sister site Trulia, not on Redfin, Realtor.com or Homes.com. The seller\u2019s contact information led to a dead end voicemail and unanswered emails, and Zillow did not immediately respond to questions about how the for-sale-by-owner listing was approved.\nThe $350,000 asking price raised eyebrows from the start. In December, two would-be buyers \u2014\nAustin Coming Together\n, a nonprofit based across the street, and investor Andy Schcolnik \u2014 declined to meet the lender PHH Mortgage\u2019s minimum bid of $240,000, citing the home\u2019s extreme disrepair. At the time, Austin Coming Together estimated the property was appraised at roughly $65,000 and would require about $2 million in rehabilitation.\nThe price also sat near Austin\u2019s median single-family home value of $362,500, according to Redfin \u2014 a mismatch for a structure with a collapsing roof, rotting windows and extensive interior damage.\nBuilt in 1903, the Walser House is one of just seven\nPrairie-period Wright homes\nstill standing in Chicago and is a designated city landmark. Preservationists have warned for years that deferred maintenance threatens its survival. The home fell into foreclosure after its longtime owner, Anne Teague, who had taken out a reverse mortgage, died in 2019.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Rockwood listed the property for sale in September.\nThe transaction for the property at 331 East Evelyn Avenue is the biggest in Mountain View since values began falling in 2021.

The firm has been in expansion mode across Silicon Valley, most recently\nleasing an additional three floors\nof offices in Sunnyvale last month.\nApproximately 20 institutional investors, consisting mostly of private equity firms, were interested in buying the offices, sources familiar with the deal told the Business Journal.

Rents have\nclimbed past pre-pandemic highs\n, with some new luxury one-bedrooms fetching approximately $5.75 per square foot, up from a previous peak of $5.50 per square foot.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Chief executive officer Brendan Wallace confirmed the business decisions to the outlet.\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear how many employees were affected, though people familiar with the firm told the outlet the climate team was hit particularly hard.\nThe company cited a familiar foe of the real estate industry for the cuts, pointing to high interest rates. The firm also pointed to\nclimate policies under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration\n. The federal government\u2019s shift away from climate change science has\naffected proptech fundraising\nby scaring off investment and stoking uncertainty around regulations and building materials.\nA representative for the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nWallace disputed several points raised by Axios, including the cancellation of a $500 million to $1 billion proptech fund that the CEO said never existed.\nThe firm\u2019s REACT fund, geared towards the since-consolidated real estate and climate tech business, remains open to investment, even without an active fundraising effort. The company raised $124 million for the fund last year, a quarter of its goal, according to an SEC filing last month.\nIn the past, Fifth Wall\u2019s funds brought in plenty of cash. It has closed an $866 million proptech fund, a $500 million climate fund \u2014 its first in the sector \u2014 and a $159 million fund pointed at Europe. Real estate firms once made up 65 percent of Fifth Wall\u2019s limited partners as it enjoyed low interest rates and government support for climate initiatives.\nBut rising interest rates and reportedly questionable decisions that rankled LPs caused difficulties for the firm.\nFifth Wall has $600 million in dry powder at its disposal today. Wallace intends to get active fundraising going again next year.\n\u201cThe real estate market has continued to struggle, and so what I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll raise is $1 billion,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll raise a much smaller fund.\u201d\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Fulton Street Companies is doubling down on its bid to turn\nChicago\u2019s Fulton Market\ninto a high-end shopping destination, tapping veteran broker Francis X. Scire as its new head of retail leasing.\nThe appointment comes as the former meatpacking district \u2014 already a magnet for top-tier office tenants and high-end residential development \u2014 begins to attract a new breed of retailer. While the neighborhood has mastered the restaurant scene, renowned apparel brands are now scouting the cobblestone streets, and landlords are scrambling to position their portfolios to capture the influx.\nScire will oversee leasing for Fulton Street\u2019s entire Fulton Market portfolio, including the retail portion of the 409,000-square-foot office building under construction at 919 West Fulton Street, according to a press release. That development, anchored by Harrison Street Real Estate, has already secured leases with Gibsons Steakhouse and Equinox.\nHis arrival marks a calculated shift in strategy for Fulton Street. The firm last year\ntoyed with a significant exit\n, hiring Newmark to test the market for a sale of its retail properties. But with no deal struck, the firm opted to hold, carrying its mortgage debt forward. The developer, which partnered with Chicago retail tycoon Fred Latsko on its retail properties, is now betting that a Scire-led leasing spree will drive further appreciation, effectively raising its bet on the neighborhood\u2019s long-term value.\nScire brings a track record of high-profile leasing to the role. Most recently, he led leasing for\nNora West Palm Beach\nin South Florida, the adaptive reuse district by NDT Development, Place Projects and Wheelock Street Capital. The project has become a magnet for New York exports, inking leases with buzzy tenants like Pastis, Le Labo, Warby Parker and Van Leeuwen.\nHis r\u00e9sum\u00e9 also includes a stint at\nWS Development\n, where he spearheaded the revitalization of the Royal Poinciana Plaza in Palm Beach. During his tenure, Scire was instrumental in curating a luxury lineup that brought heavyweights Herm\u00e8s and Cartier to the shopping center \u2014 a retailer caliber Fulton Street may be eyeing for Fulton Market.\n\u201cWe\u2019re focused on creating spaces that not only attract the world\u2019s most coveted brands but also foster a sense of community,\u201d Alex Nejem, CEO of Fulton Street, said in a statement.\n",

CoStar\nreported\nthat Heitman closed its Value Partners Fund VI with $2 billion in equity commitments, exceeding its $1.75 billion goal.\nInvestors also pledged another $620 million in co-investment capital, bringing total commitments to $2.6 billion. With leverage, Heitman said the fund will have nearly $6.6 billion in buying power to deploy across medical\noffices\n, student housing, senior housing,\nself-storage\n, multifamily and industrial properties over the next several years.\nThe fund drew commitments from 30 investors across seven countries, though\nHeitman\ndid not disclose names. It is the firm\u2019s largest closed-end fundraise to date, a notable milestone at a time when many managers are still struggling to get capital off the sidelines.\n\u201cWe view this phase of the cycle as an attractive entry point,\u201d CEO Maury Tognarelli said in a statement, pointing to strategies driven by secular demand and income growth rather than pure appreciation. The fund is targeting returns of 12 percent to 14 percent.\nHeitman now has $48 billion in assets under management, and has raised and utilized five value-add funds since 2004, according to the outlet.\nHeitman said it has already put nearly half the capital to work. The firm has committed $847 million, or about 42 percent of equity commitments, across 12 investments so far, a spokesperson told the publication. While specific deals weren\u2019t identified, the investments span medical office, student housing, multifamily, industrial, cold storage, industrial outdoor storage and self-storage.\nThe fund puts Heitman alongside a growing list of global managers showing fundraising momentum despite higher borrowing costs, tariff uncertainty and a slower market.\nBrookfield\nrecently announced a record $30 billion haul, while Carlyle Group closed a $9 billion real estate fund and Bain Capital raised $3.4 billion. Closer to home, fellow Chicago firm Mesirow said last year it secured more than $1.2 billion for multifamily strategies.\nHeitman said the new fund will balance less cyclical property types with more traditional growth potential in\napartments and warehouses\n.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "America\u2019s largest homebuilder saw its profits drop in the first quarter.\nD.R. Horton posted lower first quarter earnings, as high mortgage rates and jittery consumers forced the company to lean harder on sales incentives, pressuring margins even as it beat Wall Street\u2019s earnings expectations.\nThe Arlington, Texas-based\nbuilder\nreported net income of $594.8 million, or $2.03 per share, down from $844.9 million, or $2.61 per share, a year earlier,\naccording\nto the Wall Street Journal. Revenue fell to $6.9 billion from $7.6 billion, though both figures topped analyst estimates. Closings dropped 7 percent, year-over-year, to 17,818 homes, while the average closing price slid 3 percent to $365,500.\nExecutives pointed squarely at\naffordability\n. Executive Chairman David Auld said \u201caffordability constraints and cautious consumer sentiment\u201d continue to weigh on demand, a dynamic that pushed incentives higher as the quarter progressed. Those incentives, often in the form of mortgage rate buydowns, are now expected to remain elevated into fiscal 2026.\nCEO Paul Romanowski said on the earnings call that incentive levels in December suggest gross margins will decline again in the second quarter. D.R. Horton offered guidance of a home sales gross margin of 19 percent to 19.5 percent, below what analysts had expected.\nThere are glimmers of relief. Mortgage rates have drifted lower in recent weeks, and Romanowski said sales offices are seeing a pickup in traffic. If rates stay compressed, the cost of incentives could ease. Counterbalancing that optimism are growing concerns about the labor market. Romanowski said sustained job growth is critical for a durable rebound in\nhousing demand\n.\nLooking ahead\n, D.R. Horton plans to ramp up housing starts in the second quarter after many builders pulled back late last year to protect margins. The company forecast second-quarter revenue of $7.3 billion to $7.8 billion on 19,700 to 20,200 closings.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Donald Trump commuted the federal prison sentence of a Brooklyn real estate developer convicted in a sweeping mortgage fraud scheme that\nfueled\na $50 million buying spree across Hartford\u2019s multifamily market.\nJacob Deutsch, who was sentenced to five years behind bars, saw his prison term, fine and related penalties wiped away by a grant of executive clemency signed last week, the Hartford Courant\nreported\n. Trump offered no explanation for the decision.\nThe case centered on a yearslong effort by Deutsch and his cousin, Aron Deutsch, to amass dozens of apartment buildings using falsified financial records.\nFederal prosecutors said the cousins acquired 17 multifamily properties across Hartford between 2016 and 2021, leaning on hundreds of forged documents to secure 24 separate mortgages from lenders that included four banks and secondary market players such as Fannie Mae. The portfolio stretched from Washington Street south of downtown through the West End and into Asylum Hill.\nJacob Deutsch was accused of masterminding an elaborate web of fake rent rolls, leases, utility bills and bank records to inflate occupancy and income at multiple properties. One focal point was a 24-unit complex at 16 Evergreen Avenue, which prosecutors said was completely vacant when Deutsch represented it as fully leased at above-market rents.\nTo sell the story, Deutsch admitted to inventing tenants, forging signatures on leases and staging empty apartments with furniture and clothing before lender inspections. When lenders pushed for more proof, prosecutors said he supplied doctored electric and gas bills and fabricated bank deposits showing rental income that didn\u2019t exist.\nAron Deutsch, based in Monsey, New York, avoided prison but was fined $1 million and placed on probation for five years \u2014 penalties wiped away by the clemency. Prosecutors said he helped purchase cashier\u2019s checks used to back up the fake banking records.\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s office described the scheme as shifting \u201cthe risk of catastrophic loss\u201d onto lenders and the mortgage-backed securities market. The conspiracy began to unravel after federal housing officials flagged the Evergreen Avenue loan file as \u201cwildly false.\u201d\nDespite the scope of the fraud, the case landed awkwardly in a stable Hartford market. Prosecutors acknowledged that rising property values and steady rents limited losses, though they pegged lender damages at roughly $3.5 million. Defense attorneys argued the properties were ultimately sold at break-even prices.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Save Boca, a grassroots organization, clamored for a referendum for any new city land deals.\nCouncil Member Andy Thomson, the lone dissenting vote, said One Boca is still too large and may end up costing the city more in revenue than it would receive from any future rent proceeds outlined in the proposed lease.\nThe council\u2019s four other members said One Boca will be as much of an economic boon for the city as Mizner Park, a shopping district with condos and apartments that replaced Boca Mall in 1991.\nOne hundred and eighty two of the residential units would be condos, built on a 12,000-square-foot parcel at 141 Northwest Fourth Street that Terra and Frisbie are contracted to buy from Boca Color Graphics.\nThe rest will be 688 market rate apartments and 77 workforce apartments slated to be built near the Boca Raton Police Department, after a new police headquarters is built in the city\u2019s Spanish River area.\nThe ground lease has an estimated value of $228 million, based on percentages the city would charge the developers. CBRE and PFM have estimated that could amount to $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion over the 99-year term when adjusting for inflation.\nThe developers committed to contributing $46 million to new utilities and road improvements.\nTerra and Frisbie would receive a 3.3 percent fee from the city to build $201 million in capital improvements, including the city hall, community center and Memorial Park improvements, plus a police substation and a $30 million, 600-space parking garage near the site of a future grocery and office development by the Brightline station.\nFinal designs haven\u2019t been presented, and each element will require city approval.\nCouncil members will vote next month on plan amendments that allow intensive mixed-use transit-oriented development in Boca Raton\u2019s downtown.\nTerra and Frisbie\nbeat\nthree other development teams last February, including Related Ross, for the right to redevelop 30-acres of city-owned land, including Memorial Park.\nIts initial proposal, designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox, was about 2.5 million square feet with nearly 1,130 apartments, 150 hotel rooms, 157,000 square feet of retail and just over 3,400 parking spaces.\nLater iterations were scaled back, but the project still\nstirred backlash\nand inspired organizers to collect thousands of signatures to push for the requirement of a public vote prior to selling or leasing city parcels larger than half an acre. That move was ultimately\nblocked by a judge\nfrom appearing on a ballot in January.\nNevertheless, Frisbie and city officials agreed to allow voters to have the final say on One Boca in a\npublic referendum\non March 10, the same day\nvoters pick their city\u2019s next mayor\nand council members.",

        "content": "Another tenant at downtown Houston\u2019s newest office tower is planning to put real money into the space.\nThird Coast Infrastructure is preparing to launch a buildout of its new headquarters at the Norton Rose Fulbright Tower, a project expected to cost at least $2.8 million, according to a recent filing with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. The Houston Business Journal\nreported\nthat the Houston-based energy infrastructure firm plans to relocate into a 20,800-square-foot space on the 15th floor of the 28-story building at 1550 Lamar Street.\nThe filing shows the buildout will affect roughly 16,249 square feet and is expected to wrap by the end of the year. Houston-based\nTramonte Design Studio\nis listed as the project\u2019s designer, though no general contractor has been named.\nThe move was first announced in October, when New York-based\nSkanska USA Commercial Development\n\u2014 the tower\u2019s owner and developer, the U.S. subsidiary of the Swedish construction company \u2014 revealed Third Coast as the building\u2019s fourth tenant. The company is relocating from Hess Tower at 1501 McKinney Street, upgrading into a trophy tower that has become one of the few bright spots in a still-uneven Downtown Houston office market.\nSkanska pitched the lease as a sign of Third Coast\u2019s growth and its long-term commitment to Houston. Third Coast President and CEO Matt Rowland said at the time that the company was drawn to the building\u2019s technology infrastructure, meeting spaces and amenities, calling it a \u201cmodern, world-class environment\u201d for employees and clients.\nThird Coast\noperates offshore projects across the Gulf Coast, including natural gas and liquids pipelines, processing plants and a deepwater floating production system \u2014 a business profile that still supports demand for high-quality office space, even as many energy firms shrink their workspace.\nThe buildout plan follows another leasing win for\nSkanska at the tower\n. Norton Rose Fulbright, the international law firm that anchors the building and gives it its name, recently expanded its presence to eight full floors, or about 139,000 square feet. The firm originally signed a 15-year lease before construction began in 2021 and moved in last year.\nWith that expansion, plus leases signed by Boston Consulting Group and litigation boutique Hicks Johnson, the tower is now about 70 percent leased, Skanska said. Ground-floor retail has also come online, including Hugo Ortega\u2019s Zaranda restaurant and Tenfold Coffee.\nAltogether, the Norton Rose Fulbright Tower totals 375,000 square feet of office space and 7,000 square feet of retail.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The SEC letter signals that the agency does not intend to recommend enforcement action,\naccording\nto Reuters, which first reported the move.\nMegPrime marks Megatel\u2019s first foray into digital currency. CEO Zach Ipour framed it as an extension of the builder\u2019s broader housing ecosystem rather than a speculative move. The token will be marketed strictly as a payment and rewards tool, not as an investment, the company said.\nConsumers will be able to use MegPrime through a digital wallet and payment card at regular merchants. In return, users can earn rebates paid in additional tokens, discounted gift cards and points redeemable for housing-related benefits. Token holders will not receive any ownership rights, voting power or profit participation tied to\nMegatel\n, according to the publication.\nThe initiative builds on a program\nMegatel\nlaunched in 2019 that credited renters with an amount equal to their prior year\u2019s rent to use toward a home purchase.\nIpour\ntold Reuters the company believes its scale \u2014 a\nmultibillion-dollar homebuilding and financing operation\n\u2014 gives it a chance to \u201cperfect this model\u201d by blending real estate transactions with digital currency incentives.\nTraditional companies across industries have been experimenting with blockchain-based loyalty and payments programs, according to the outlet, and the SEC under President Trump has taken a more permissive stance toward crypto, easing regulatory anxiety for firms considering similar moves.\nHomebuilders have largely stayed on the sidelines of crypto after the sector\u2019s boom-and-bust cycles, wary of volatility and regulatory risk. Megatel\u2019s approach sidesteps those issues by positioning MegPrime as a tool tied to everyday spending and housing benefits, rather than a tradable currency.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Why does the government pay for food stamps but rely on landlords to provide rent-regulated housing?\nBrokerage leader Jason Oppenheim, he of reality TV fame and 1.5 million Instagram followers, commented on a\nTRD\nInstagram post\nthat the government treats hunger differently from housing.\nOppenheim asked why we impose rent control on apartments, although we don\u2019t put price controls on food as a way to combat hunger.\nHe observed that SNAP benefits and rental vouchers are publicly funded, but rent control places the burden on landlords:\n\u201cWe issue food stamps only, so why wouldn\u2019t we issue rental vouchers only? If we want to help tenants, we should all have to pay \u2014 it should come from taxes \u2026 We shouldn\u2019t be punishing a particular group of people like landlords.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cIt seems obvious when we discuss food assistance but for some reason with rental assistance, we take the exact opposite approach and it is a totally failed and unfair approach.\u201d\nIt\u2019s an excellent way to frame the question. Oppenheim is correct that rent control is unsuccessful and unjust \u2014 especially in New York, where six-figure earners enjoy rent-stabilized units and homelessness is rampant. But there is a reason price controls were adopted for housing and not food.\nIt starts with the physical difference: Buildings last for decades, but food has a short shelf life. It is constantly consumed and replaced.\nTherefore, slapping rent control on certain properties (in New York City, pre-1974 buildings with six or more units) doesn\u2019t change the number of those buildings. Buildings are not used up and replaced the way food is.\nPrice controls on food would cause farmers and food manufacturers to produce less of it. Food shortages would be immediate and deadly. But rent-controlled buildings continue to house people for decades.\nRent control applied to old buildings also causes shortages: The vacancy rate of rent-stabilized housing in New York City is about 1 percent. The idea in New York was to keep old buildings affordable but exempt new ones from rent control, so developers would meet the city\u2019s need for new supply.\nThis is why price controls for housing appeals to people more than price controls for something perishable, like food. But it\u2019s still bad policy, for a host of reasons.\nOne is that buildings\nare\nperishable, in their own way. They become dated, then outdated, and eventually deteriorate, because why invest money that generates no return? Even crappy buildings fill up because the rents are low.\nIn some cases, the landlord has no money left for repairs and improvements after paying the utility bills, taxes, insurance and mortgage.\nThe result is low rent but terrible living conditions \u2014 and, ultimately, vacant units. The housing shortage gets worse.\nAnother risk of rent stabilization was that it would spread beyond pre-1974 buildings. That has happened.\nAffordable housing rents are typically subject to Rent Guidelines Board increases, which have not kept up with operating expenses. So even some post-1974 buildings are in the red and racking up violations.\nOne more consequence of rent stabilization was that it made it extremely difficult to replace old apartment buildings with larger ones. This choked off new supply, pushing up market-rate rents.\nOppenheimer\u2019s comment reminds me of a key difference between food stamps and rental vouchers.\nSNAP has been found to generate more\neconomic impact\nthan\nany other subsidy\n, because recipients put the money right back into the local economy. Yet SNAP doesn\u2019t drive up the price of groceries because food is so plentiful.\nCheap housing, however, is scarce, so rental vouchers do push up rents because they increase demand for homes. A voucher offers a chance to move out of your sister\u2019s. But it can expire before you find a place.\nSNAP won\u2019t expire before you find groceries, because, as Oppenheimer noted, we don\u2019t curb food production with price controls.\nRental vouchers are still good. They would be even better if housing were as plentiful as food.\n",

        "content": "New York\u2019s new development has historically pushed the envelope with\nhulking projects that reshape the skyline\n.\nBut in recent years, those spindly spires of glass offering hundreds of units have been replaced with squat brick or terracotta buildings that recede into the streetscape, often holding just a handful of meticulously-designed homes.\nAfter the early successes on Billionaires\u2019 Row in the mid-2010s bred copycats around the city, the tide turned on larger projects, with a number of\nnoteworthy busts\nstemming from\nlackluster buyer interest\n,\ncostly construction\nor, in some cases,\nfraud\n.\nDevelopers \u2014 and their investors \u2014 have taken note, and instead seized on the success of recent boutique projects in commanding prices that used to be reserved for the skyscrapers along 57th Street.\n\u201cThere is evidence in the market that these buildings can attract tremendous pricing, and people want to take advantage of that,\u201d said BKREA\u2019s Bob Knakal of smaller condo projects.\nThe downsizing has been driven by a lack of land and capital for large-scale projects, but also a shifting sense of what buyers want from their multimillion-dollar homes.\nFrom 2016 to 2020 in Manhattan, buildings with fewer than 40 units accounted for just 14 percent of the new units coming to the market, according to a\nThe Real Deal\nanalysis of condo offering plans filed with the New York Attorney General\u2019s Office. In the last three years, that number has jumped to 32 percent.\nThe shift comes at a time when the city is\nlosing new condo inventory rapidly\nand big-name developers have turned over to a new, more cautious and\nanalytics-driven guard\n.\nShow me the money\nEven for developers who want to go big, the pipeline of money and land to do so has increasingly run dry.\nThe juiciest slices of land on the island, around the West Village, Tribeca and Chelsea, have all been bought up and, in many cases, are also height-restricted.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just not a lot of undeveloped land on the island of Manhattan that could bring up a large-scale project,\u201d said Robin Schneiderman, managing director of Brown Harris Stevens Development Marketing Group.\nThe large projects that are underway have been prohibitively expensive for all but the most flush of risk-takers. At 625 Madison Avenue, Related Companies ponied up roughly\n$630 million\n, or over $1,000 per square foot, to buy its former office building, which it plans to tear down for what will likely become a combination of hotel, retail and condos.\nCompare that to Michael Stern\u2019s project at 111 West 57th Street on Billionaires\u2019 Row, which was built from an assemblage his firm JDS Development secured for just\n$130 million\n, or roughly $400 per square foot.\nAt the same time, the money that was floating around for these projects has become scarce \u2014 or more risk-averse \u2014 in recent years.\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of debt to do these kinds of things, but the equity piece of the puzzle is hard to find,\u201d Schneiderman said. \u201cSome of the equity world got into the debt game. They\u2019ve really changed their strategy on where they want to be in the capital stack.\u201d\nWhile the debt play has made sense for many investors as\nbanks pulled back on traditional lending\nafter the pandemic, there is also a greater unease around handing unsecured money over to flashy developers after HFZ \u2014 the developer behind notorious projects like XI on the High Line and the Belnord on the Upper East Side \u2014\nwent up in flames\nand left investors around the city holding the bag.\nOther recent high-profile projects, like\nOne Wall Street\nor\n53 West 53rd Street\n, have gone sideways simply because of an apparent lack of demand.\n\u201cWhen they look at what\u2019s happened in the past, I think that people are cautious,\u201d Schneiderman said.\nWhat buyers want\nWhile developers looking to make their mark on the city\u2019s skyline have foundered, those that have leaned into finding smaller sites around the city have found a pool of buyers willing to spend surprising amounts to live in a converted garage or former retail corner.\nA number of high-profile sales this year have happened at projects where there\u2019s no towering view of Central Park or the Empire State Building. The two oft-cited projects are at 140 Jane Street, the 15-unit project where a penthouse asking\n$88 million\nwent into contract last year, and 125 Perry Street, the seven-unit garage conversion where a buyer secured a penthouse asking\n$58 million\n.\nYiannes Einhorn, the managing principal of development firm Grid Group, which is behind a 22-unit condo at 142 West 21st Street called the Myles, said the attention to detail on smaller-scale projects is essentially unmatched.\n\u201cThere are no lemons in these projects, because every apartment is studied and carefully drawn out,\u201d Einhorn said of boutique developments. \u201cYou see these 200 [or] 300 unit projects, there\u2019s always a line that never sells.\u201d\nWhile Grid Group has long focused on smaller projects, others have taken the plunge on deals that they might not have previously.\n\u201cPre-Covid, if you asked me, would you do like a 25,000- to 30,000-square-foot conversion or would you do a 25,000- to 30,000-square-foot ground up, we\u2019re not putting a shovel in the ground,\u201d said Avdoo CEO Shlomi Avdoo. \u201cToday, we definitely see the reward at the end.\u201d\nAvdoo just launched sales at 110 Boerum Place in Cobble Hill, which is a fraction of the size of his other recent Brooklyn condos, like the 105-unit Bergen.\nBuyers in the wake of the pandemic sought privacy and comfort over views and lavish amenities like bowling alleys and pet spas. Both Avdoo and Einhorn\u2019s buildings provide parking spaces for nearly every owner to purchase, and every unit has some outdoor space.\nAfter years of watching larger buildings sit on the market as their investors rack up carrying costs, some developers are eager for projects where they can see the end in sight before even starting.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather be in a position where I have to sell 20 units to pay back the bank, let\u2019s say, then, being a 300-unit project where it takes you 200 units to pay back the bank,\u201d Einhorn said.",

        "content": "Gov. Kathy Hochul finally provided some details about her proposed revamped property tax break and carve-outs for housing projects in New York.\nAs part of her executive budget, the governor has pitched reforming the State Environmental Quality Review Act, or SEQRA, and the property tax abatement known as J-51.\nOn the former, housing projects in the city would be exempt from environmental review if:\n\u2014 They have 250 or fewer units, if located in a low-density district.\n\u2014 They have 500 or fewer units, if located in a medium- or high-density district.\nSuch projects, however, still must go through review if located in coastal flood zones, in areas zoned for industrial use or if the project has more than 50,000 square feet of nonresidential space.\nThe proposal targets smaller projects than a bill previously proposed that sought to exempt projects with up to 1,000 apartments, though that measure only applied to affordable housing.\nMeanwhile, the proposal to revamp J-51 does a few things:\n\u2014 Under the current program, the value of the tax abatement is capped at 70 percent of the cost of building renovations. These totals are limited by what the city considers a \u201creasonable\u201d price for various repairs. The governor\u2019s proposal would bring the value of the tax break up to 100 percent of that cost.\n\u2014\u00a0Condos and co-ops are eligible under the current program if units have an average assessed value of $45,000. The executive budget legislation raises that threshold to $60,000.\n\u2014\u00a0In 2023, the state authorized the city to adopt a reformed version of J-51, which turned the combo abatement and exemption program into simply an abatement that was available to a smaller pool of buildings. It took the City Council more than a year to pick up on the issue, agreeing to adopt the program in December 2024.\nThe 2023 program applied to improvements completed after June 29, 2022, and on or before June 29, 2026. The late adoption, combined with the slow rollout of a new schedule of reasonable costs that determined the value of the tax break, meant landlords have a shorter window to use the abatement.\nThe executive budget proposal seems to acknowledge this by creating a 10-year window, instead of four. The new incentive would apply to work completed after June 30, 2026, and before June 30, 2036. Critically, the bill also doesn\u2019t require the city to enact the tax break if the state approves the legislation.\nAs written, the bill also technically excludes any project completed on June 30, 2026, from either the current or new program, Rosenberg &amp; Estis\u2019 Benjamin Williams pointed out to me today. Whoops!\nLandlords also shied away from the program in recent years because they found the city\u2019s reasonable cost schedule to be wildly out of date. The governor\u2019s bill mandates that the city update its schedule of reasonable costs every three years.\nWhat it doesn\u2019t do:\nLandlords have argued that the eligibility restrictions meant that the break wasn\u2019t widely available. They have also called for broader relief for rent-stabilized properties. Hochul\u2019s budget doesn\u2019t change the eligibility parameters. To qualify, buildings must be 50 percent affordable, part of the state\u2019s Mitchell-Lama program or receive \u201csubstantial government assistance.\u201d\nThe reform proposals also leave intact a prohibition on landlords doubling up on the tax abatement and rent increases through the Major Capital Improvement program. New York Apartment Association\u2019s Jay Martin said the provision makes the program unworkable.\nStill, the bill allows landlords to file a waiver certifying that they will not try to collect MCI rent increases for the same rehab work after the state has confirmed they can receive J-51 benefits. So, owners can decide to forgo J-51 if they believe pursuing an MCI is the better deal.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nThis week, Mayor Zohran Mamdani told reporters that he didn\u2019t have any plans, at that time, to attend the Real Estate Board of New York\u2019s gala on Thursday. How much work was \u201cat this time\u201d doing in his response? Does he have different plans at\nthis\ntime? Do those plans include showing up to the Waldorf Astoria New York and granting a\nTRD\nreporter an interview? Can it? Hello? Send guesses to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\n(I was told on Wednesday, however, that\nLeila Bozorg\n, deputy mayor of housing and planning, plans to attend.)\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: New Jersey Gov. Mikie Sherrill held her inaugural ball at the American Dream shopping mall on Tuesday.\nHaving the event at a mall is very New Jersey, and having it at a mall where the drive there is likely to inspire road rage is also fitting. Reporter dispatches from the event show guests in gowns and tuxedos in front of a\nWetzels Pretzels\n. At the start of the night, a performer crooned Frank Sinatra while\nbackground\ndancers wearing military outfits, a nod to Sherill\u2019s time as a Navy helicopter pilot, languorously swiveling their hips. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever seen anything so delightfully discordant.\nThe night\napparently\nalso featured the new governor rapping alongside former members of the group Naughty by Nature.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nAmtrak on Wednesday announced three finalists that will compete to overhaul Penn Station,\nGothamist reports\n. Grand Penn Partners (backed by the National Civic Art Society and Trump donor Thomas Klingenstein), Penn Forward Now (led by Fengate Capital) and Halmar International are vying to be the project\u2019s master developer. The winner will be selected in May and announced in June.\n\u2014\nThe city is suing to stop a reality television show about the NYPD, hosted by celebrity psychologist Dr. Phil, from airing\n,\nthe New York Times reports\n. Former Mayor Eric Adams signed off on the show, dubbed \u201cBehind the Badge.\u201d\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$15 million\nfor a 4,042-square-foot condominium unit at 470 Columbus Avenue on the Upper West Side.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$77 million\nfor a bulk sale of sponsor-sale condos at 1 Park Row in the Financial District. Eenhoorn Properties purchased 58 of the 64 residential units, the retail unit and three office units.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$10 million\nfor a 2,005-square-foot condo at 760 Madison Avenue in Lenox Hill. Madeline Hult Elghanayan and Sabrina Saltiel with Douglas Elliman have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 470,705-square-foot, 14-story mixed-use project at 2560 Boston Road in the Allerton section of the Bronx. Ariel Aufgang filed the permit on behalf of Slate Property Group.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "The saga of a distressed downtown Miami site appeared to be over after Cirrus won the property with a $77 million bid last month.\nBut a bankruptcy court judge recently ordered a new auction after the property owner, Brazilian developer\nGilberto Bomeny\n, complained that the bidding process freezed out potential buyers offering more money.\nU.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Laurel Isicoff set a Jan. 28 date for a new auction after hearing arguments on Dec. 31 from attorneys representing Cirrus and two Bomeny entities that own the nearly 1-acre parcel at\n340 Biscayne Boulevard\n, home to a Holiday Inn built in 1950.\n\u201cTo ensure that all interested parties have sufficient time to perform due diligence on the property and complete the vetting and bidder registration process, it was determined that additional time was appropriate,\u201d said Chad Roffers, CEO of Sotheby\u2019s Concierge Auctions, which is conducting the auction.\nBomeny bought the property with the 10-story, 200-room hotel for $65 million in 2015. The site is approved for an 82-story, 950,000-square-foot tower with 374 condos, 120 hotel rooms, offices and retail, along with 500 parking spaces.\nLinda Jackson, the lawyer for the Bomeny entities, and Cirrus\u2019 attorney Daniel Gonzalez did not respond to requests for comment.\nAn affiliate of New York-based\nCirrus\n, Joseph McDonnell, is the largest creditor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case the Bomeny entities filed last year to stave off a\nUCC foreclosure\n. Cirrus alleges they defaulted on a $70 million loan.\nThe judge authorized an auction that began taking bids on Dec. 4 and ended on Dec. 17 with a reserve of\n$70 million\n. The judge also approved a $101.5 million credit bid by the Cirrus affiliate. The lender was declared the winning bidder when the auction closed.\nHowever, Bomeny\u2019s entities filed a Dec. 25 motion seeking to\nthrow out the auction results\nand redo the sale due to \u201cconstant changes and irregularities\u201d in the sale process that shut out rival bidders. For instance, the hour when the auction was set to begin was changed several times by the auctioneer, Sotheby\u2019s Concierge Auctions, the motion states.\nAfter the auction closed, Bomeny learned that \u201cseveral\u201d prospective bidders who intended to participate were unable to do so because of the last-minute time change, a lack of communication from Sotheby\u2019s and technical issues that prevented registration or payment of the registration fee, the motion alleges. At least one of the bidders was going to bid almost double Cirrus\u2019 $77 million bid, Bomeny\u2019s lawyer alleged.\nCirrus disputed Bomeny\u2019s assertions in a Dec. 29 motion, alleging the property owner was \u201cunwilling to accept the auction\u2019s outcome\u201d and falsely accused \u201cits handpicked auctioneer of mishandling the auction so gravely that potential bidders were unable to participate.\u201d\nMoreover, Bomeny\u2019s potential bidders did not register for the auction and did not submit a $250,000 deposit to participate, the Cirrus motion states.\nOne of the bidders purportedly had been negotiating to buy the site for $140 million months before the auction, but did not follow through, Cirrus alleged.",

        "content": "Blackstone may be ready to test the market for one of Chicago\u2019s most recognizable assets.\nThe world\u2019s largest private real estate firm is exploring a potential exit from Willis Tower, the 110-story, 4.5-million-square-foot skyscraper at 233 South Wacker Drive it has owned for a decade. In recent months, Blackstone has quietly approached a small group of investors willing to assume the building\u2019s $1.3 billion securitized mortgage,\naccording\nto a Green Street\u2019s Real Estate Alert. Eastdil Secured is running those conversations, sources told the outlet.\nBlackstone\ndeclined to comment on a possible sale but pointed to recent operational gains in a statement to Bisnow. The firm highlighted more than 600,000 square feet of leasing over the past two years and over 1.2 million annual visitors to the Skydeck, the 103rd-floor observation deck that has become a major revenue driver.\nThe outreach comes as Willis Tower\u2019s valuation remains a moving target. As previously reported in\nThe Real Deal\n, the property was\nappraised at $1.4 billion\nabout a year ago, though public and private estimates throughout 2025 have ranged from roughly $999 million to $1.4 billion. The variance in appraiser opinions on the value has been chalked up to different methodologies for how to account for the Skydeck\u2019s contributions.\nBlackstone paid $1.3 billion for the tower in 2015, assuming existing debt as part of the deal. It refinanced with the $1.3 billion loan now attached to the property. The building\u2019s loan isn\u2019t distressed, but Blackstone has spent a lot on top of its initial purchase.\nAfter pouring roughly $670 million into renovations \u2014 including a sweeping office overhaul and the creation of the 300,000-square-foot Catalog retail and entertainment complex \u2014 Blackstone lifted\noccupancy and revenue\n. The property was 84 percent leased as of late September, and recently buoyed by deals with tenants like Adtalem Global Education and\nZurich North America\n. Skydeck revenue rose 15 percent last year.\nBlackstone also secured breathing room on the capital stack. Last year, the firm modified the floating-rate loan, extending its maturity to March 2028 with two one-year extension options. Loan servicer reports show the property is generating enough cash flow to cover debt service, according to Green Street.\nBut the numbers are getting tighter. Rising interest rates pushed annual debt service to $91.4 million in 2024, up from $66.4 million in 2018, according to the outlet. Real estate taxes have surged as well, running far ahead of underwriting. While cash flow is meeting or exceeding original projections, the debt-service coverage ratio has deteriorated, falling through the first nine months of 2025 from its underwritten origination.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Advocate is currently leading a massive $645 million expansion and renovation project of its Northside campuses, though it\u2019s unclear if that includes the building at 3000 North Halsted as well.\nSeller Healthcare Realty Trust specializes in investing in such properties, while IRA Capital is a private equity firm that focuses on a variety of alternative investments, according to the two firms\u2019 websites. The move could signal a growing interest in the medical office market.\nRepresentatives of IRA Capital and Healthcare Realty Trust did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe medical office market may offer refuge for investors shying away from\nthe traditional office market.\nThe U.S. population aged 65 and above is expected to increase from 61 million in 2024 to 70 million by 2030, a report from Colliers found. The sector\u2019s fundamentals are supported by low supply and a 2 percent increase in medical office rents in 2025, Colliers found.\nBut\nnot all investments are created equally\n, especially medical offices and hospitals supported by federal funding from programs like Medicare and Medicaid.\nA portfolio of medical offices and safety net hospitals in Chicago and west suburban River Forest\nare currently stuck in limbo\nas investors battle over a total of $89 million in unpaid debt, public records revealed earlier this month. Amid the\ncourt battles surrounding the properties\n, former owner Pipeline Health made the decision to close Weiss Memorial Hospital in Uptown.\nThe Illinois Department of Public Health had reportedly paid several visits to the properties and found compliance issues in \u201cnursing services, physical environment and emergency services,\u201d healthcare news outlet Chicago Health reported in August. Specifically, its air conditioning system failed and led to overheating, forcing closures of inpatient rooms. Weiss reportedly received 87 percent of its funding from Medicare and Medicaid in 2024.",

        "content": "Takeda Pharmaceuticals is doubling down on the far north suburbs, expanding into the revamped former Motorola Mobility campus in Libertyville. It\u2019s handing an early leasing win to the Chicago developer that bought the property just over a year ago.\nThe drugmaker added nearly 80,000 square feet at\nInnovation Park Lake County\n, a 1 million-square-foot office and research complex at 1910 Innovation Way, according to owner R2 Companies. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat the expansion brings Takeda\u2019s total presence at the property to 105,673 square feet, expanding the office space it first leased there in late 2024.\nThe deal fills space previously occupied by Bristol Myers Squibb, which shut down a gene-therapy manufacturing facility at the campus last year. A Takeda spokesperson confirmed the lease and said the new space is an expansion for the company in the northern suburbs, not a relocation from another local site.\nThe move provides an example of Innovation Park\u2019s appeal as a life sciences hub in Lake County, an area long anchored by biotech and pharmaceutical users. Takeda, which moved its U.S. headquarters from\nDeerfield\nto Boston in 2019 after acquiring Irish drugmaker Shire, still maintains a significant operational presence in the region, according to the outlet. The company operates a plasma therapy unit in Round Lake at a property owned by Baxter International, tied to the former Baxalta business that ultimately folded into Takeda.\nA joint venture of R2 and Chicago-based\nJDI Realty\npaid $35 million for the 83-acre Innovation Park property in late 2024, acquiring it from\nMaryland-based developer\nBeco Management that spent nearly $40 million converting the former Motorola cell phone plant into a multi-tenant research and office park. Beco Management acquired the site for $9.5 million in 2013.\nWith Takeda\u2019s expansion, Innovation Park is about 68 percent leased, roughly unchanged from when the joint venture bought it. Medline Industries, one of the property\u2019s largest tenants, plans to vacate about 138,000 square feet later this year as it consolidates employees into new offices in Northbrook, according to the publication.\nOther major tenants include Sumitomo Biorational Company, formed last year through the combination of Valent BioSciences, Valent North America and MGK.\nOriginally developed in the early 1990s for Motorola Mobility, the campus began winding down after Google acquired the handset maker in 2012.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "In the latest sign of the\nhospitality market\u2019s downturn in the East Bay\n, Oakland\u2019s only boutique hotel has closed its doors.\nThe 172-room Moxy Hotel\nhas shuttered\nafter the hotel\u2019s owner\ndefaulted on a $35 million loan\nfrom Acore Capital Mortgage in August, the San Francisco Standard reported. The property\u2019s owner, 2225 Telegraph Property LLC, refinanced the building in 2022; the entity\u2019s address in state records is tied to Minnesota-based Graves Hospitality.\nGraves Hospitality and San Francisco-based real estate development firm Tidewater Capital began developing the hotel in 2019. At the time, confidence in uptown Oakland was high amid a construction boom and an influx of residents and businesses from San Francisco. Construction on the Moxy began as development firm TMG planned a 28-floor office building across the street and Kaiser plotted a 1.6-million-square-foot headquarters blocks away.\nThe pandemic quickly threw cold water on that optimism. When the Moxy opened in spring 2021, Kaiser had abandoned its plans as it faced delays and rising costs, while TMG\u2019s development had stalled; a chain-link fence now surrounds that empty lot across the street. The Moxy\u2019s exterior lights are still on, though the interior is empty and heat lamps and deck chairs are abandoned on the second-floor balcony, according to the Standard.\nThe Moxy was \u201ca victim of wrong place and wrong time, considering how much positive momentum Oakland had prior to the pandemic,\u201d Louis Thibault of Avison Young told the Standard.\nIn September, after the hotel fell into default, a court appointed Michelle Russo, CEO of asset management firm HotelAVE, as receiver to manage the property. Two months later, the county tax collector issued a lien for nearly $102,000 in unpaid property taxes. The hotel then quietly stopped accepting new reservations.\nRusso has been entrenched in the ongoing hotel woes in the Bay Area.\nShe was appointed as receiver\nof Parc 55 and Hilton Union Square in San Francisco in 2023 after those properties also fell into default. The hotels were sold\nto Newbond Holdings and Conversant Capital\nlast fall.\nOakland, like San Francisco, has had its fair share of lodging troubles.\nLast January, the Waterfront Hotel in Jack London Square closed suddenly and the Radisson Hotel Oakland Airport was hit with a foreclosure lawsuit. In downtown Oakland, a dual-branded Residence Inn and AC Hotel downtown was seized by its lender in April. Three months later, the Oakland Marriott City Center, the largest hotel in town,\nsold at foreclosure\n. The Residence Inn, AC Hotel and Marriott City Center properties remain open to guests.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Reisor, who also works in New York, heads the 14-member Reisor Team, which exceeded $100 million in sales volume in 2025, according to a press release.\nThe Compass brand and its off-market listing option were both persuasive draws, Reisor said.\n\u201cCompass\u2019s private exclusive network is very important in New York. In Austin, around half of what we do is off-market, so I think there\u2019s a lot of demand for that in both places. But\nin Austin, there\u2019s more resources for that\n,\u201d Reisor said.\nHigh property taxes, non-disclosure laws and the\noccasional camera-shy celebrity\nhave engendered a robust off-market scene in Austin. More than one enterprise supports real estate deals outside the Multiple Listing Service, including the members-only Austin Luxury Network and the local startup Clubhouse.\nNew York doesn\u2019t have such an infrastructure for private transactions, making it a more open frontier for Compass to claim, he said.\nCompass\u2019 private listing feature has generated nationwide controversy, including a\nlawsuit filed by Zillow\n. The\nClear Cooperation Policy\nof the National Association of Realtors requires agents to list homes on Multiple Listing Services. Zillow is lending its muscle to enforce the NAR rule, having\nbanned\nlistings that agents don\u2019t submit to an MLS within a day of marketing them.\nThe Reisor Team is just the latest Texas group to join Compass in recent weeks. Last month, Houston team The Property Collective Group left Keller Williams for Compass. And Oak Cliff Real Estate rejoined Compass in December after a brief period with Dallas-based Dave Perry-Miller Real Estate.\nMeanwhile, Houston luxury agent\nDana Johnson left Compass for Douglas Elliman\nearlier this year.\nReisor joined Douglas Elliman in 2021 after having worked at Kuper Sotheby\u2019s International Realty since 2018, according to his LinkedIn.\n",

        "content": "For the second time this decade, a single-family home in Koreatown appears poised to become a new multifamily building.\nProject applicant Jafar Shahbaz has\nfiled plans\nwith the Los Angeles Department of City Planning for the construction of a six-story building with 16 two-bedroom apartments at 810 South Wilton Place, Urbanize Los Angeles reported. The residences would be built atop parking for five vehicles.\nShahbaz is seeking entitlements including\nTransit-Oriented Communities\nincentives, which would allow for a larger structure than what zoning rules would normally permit. In exchange for the zoning loophole, two of the apartments would be set aside for rent as\naffordable housing\nfor extremely-low-income households. Los Angeles County\ndefines\n\u201cextremely-low-income\u201d as one person making a maximum of $31,850 annually, or $45,450 for a household of four. The property sits approximately half a mile away from the Metro D Line stop at Wilshire Boulevard and Western Avenue.\nThe 810 South Wilton site is one block south of another six-story, 25-unit apartment building at 726 South Wilton Place. That property, known as the Wilton apartments, features co-living units and opened to renters in 2024.\nIt isn\u2019t the first time the 810 South Wilton site has been targeted for multifamily housing. In 2021, 810 Wilton Development Partners LLC \u2014 linked to real estate development firm The Code Solution \u2014\nfiled an application\nto replace the existing home on the lot with a five-story building featuring 17 studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments above parking for 17 vehicles, Urbanize Los Angeles previously reported. The plan ultimately never came to fruition.\nElsewhere in Koreatown, another six-story apartment building could replace a smaller structure on a single lot at 412 South Catalina Street. Last year, Barkley Development\u2019s\nAbolhassan Arefi\nfiled\nan application\nwith the Los Angeles Department of City Planning to turn a small apartment building at 412 South Catalina Street into a 53-unit multifamily property with a 22-car garage.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A powerhouse team of developers scored approval from a city board for a Miami Design District project with condos and a hotel.\nThe project, called Miami Design Residences Designed by Chipperfield, sailed through the Miami Design Review Board board this week, with some members gushing over its design. The development comes amid an uptick in residential proposals for the Miami Design District, which is primarily a luxury retail area.\nMiami Design District Associates and Fort Lauderdale-based Fort Partners are partnering with New York-based private equity firm Raycliff Capital and Qatari firm Constellation Hotels Holding on the project planned for a site on the northeast corner of North Miami Avenue and Northeast 39th Street. Miami Design District Associates, which developed the district, consists of Craig Robins\u2019 Dacra, L Catterton Real Estate and Brookfield.\nThe development would consist of a 25-story building with 143 condos on the south side of the property, and a 12-story building with 85 hotel keys and 20 condo-hotel units on the north side, according to the architect\u2019s presentation to the board and records included in the board agenda. Both buildings will have a rooftop, and the hotel building will have wraparound terraces.\nThe project is designed by Pritzker Prize-winning British architect Sir David Chipperfield and Cube 3. It is Chipperfield\u2019s only Florida development underway, according to a news release on the project.\nCondo sales are expected to launch next month, with Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group leading sales.\nThe development site is at 45, 53, 55, 75 and 81 Northeast 39th Street; at 10, 28, 40, 50 and 56 Northeast 40th Street; and 3995 North Miami Avenue. Records show the development partnership paid\n$143.6 million\nfor the properties in two deals in 2022.\n\u201cI think your project is very fitting to the district,\u201d said board member Francisco Perez-Azua. \u201cThe elevations here are very simple and subtle but elegant.\u201d\nOther members of the board, which often takes a critical view of other projects, echoed Perez-Azua\u2019s view.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a spectacular project,\u201d Gia Zapattini, the board\u2019s vice chair added. \u201cIt\u2019s very elegant and sophisticated.\u201d \u2026 It\u2019s raising the bar really for the neighborhood.\u201d\nThe board approved the project with three recommendations for tweaks: examining balcony edges and using a green roof material at a portion of the hotel building, and removing a picket fence-type balcony railings.\n\u201cI think the vertical picket fence railing is something we see in lower level projects like workforce housing,\u201d Zapattini said.\nMiami Design District Associates, which owns close to half a million square feet in the district, scored a\n$100 million\nloan last month for six retail properties, adding the debt to an existing $250 million financing on the real estate. The Design District is home to Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi, Gucci, Off-White and Chanel, among other brands.\nFort Partners, led by Nadim Ashi, developed The Surf Club in Surfside and the Four Seasons Hotel and Residences in Fort Lauderdale.\nIn other recent residential proposals for the Miami Design District, Miami Design District Associates, Hunter Pasteur and The Forbes Company landed a\n$125 million\nconstruction loan in July for the 20-story, 107-unit Cassi apartment building at 91-93 Northeast 36th Street.\u00a0New York-based Helm Equities\u2019 Live Local Act project in the Design District scored UDRB\napproval\nlast month. Helm, an affiliate of JEMB Realty, plans a 36-story tower with\n278 residential units\nand an adjacent eight-story building with over 101,000 square feet of offices and some retail on a nearly 2-acre site at 220 Northeast 43rd Street.\n",

        "content": "One of New York City\u2019s top architecture firms is under fire for allegedly dismissing a handful of employees who tried to unionize.\nThe National Labor Relations Board issued a complaint on Friday accusing Snohetta of firing eight workers part of a failed unionization effort, the New York Times\nreported\n. The complaint alleges the firm made the cuts \u201cto discourage employees from engaging\u201d in collective action.\nElaine Molinar, a partner at Snohetta, said \u201cbusiness considerations\u201d were at play in the firings and that the union preferences of individual employees were largely unknown.\nA paper trail, however, suggests otherwise.\nIn 2023, employees tried to align with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, first seeking voluntary recognition from management before filing for a union election that May. The vote ultimately failed, 35-29.\nWeeks later, management announced that layoffs were coming. The eight people let go were all supporters of the unionization effort.\nEmail correspondence accessible to employees allegedly uncovered discussions by managers the day before the vote about who supported the unionization effort. Email exchanges after the vote reportedly underlined a desire to prevent further unionization efforts by getting rid of supporters.\nA labor board judge will litigate the case, which can be appealed to a national board if Snohetta comes out on the losing end. Backpay for affected employees is one of the penalties on the table.\nSnohetta was founded in 2004 by architects from a Norwegian company and has gone on to design several notable public projects. Recently, the firm was involved in Gary Barnett\u2019s supertall on the former Disney campus on\nthe Upper West Side\n.\nUnionization is rare for architects, but there is a growing movement focusing on issues such as low pay, extensive hours and unpaid overtime.\nIn February 2022, SHoP Architects employees\ndropped\na unionization effort following a \u201cpowerful anti-union campaign,\u201d in the words of Architectural Workers United.\nMonths later, the workers at New York-based Bernheimer Architecture\nannounced\nthe formation of a union, the country\u2019s first private-sector union at an architecture firm.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

They\u2019re active again to start the year and giant Anthropic plans to join the fun.\nThe startup behind the Claude chatbot is looking for between 250,000 and 450,000 square feet for offices in Manhattan, Bloomberg\nreported\n. Even at the low end of the range, a lease of that size would represent a significant expansion from the 10,000 to 20,000 square feet it occupies at 155 Sixth Avenue, according to\nCompStak\n; that lease is expiring this year.\nAnthropic declined to comment to the publication.\nThe company has shown little hesitance to make moves on the office front. In the fall, Anthropic\nsigned\na lease for approximately 100,000 square feet of office space at 505 Howard Street in downtown San Francisco, across the street from its headquarters.\nThe lease came shortly after a $13 billion investment fundraise in September.\nAnd while the AI sector is transforming San Francisco\u2019s office market, tenants haven\u2019t been shy about embracing space in New York City, either.\nAt the start of this month, AI voice analytics company Rilla inked\na 57,000-square-foot\nlease at Global Holdings\u2019\n25 Kent\nin one of the borough\u2019s biggest office deals of the past year. The company will occupy the entire eighth-floor penthouse, along with nearly 4,000 square feet of private outdoor space, according to the landlord.\nAnd just this week, multifamily AI firm EliseAI signed a\n10-year lease\nfor 109,000 square feet at the Chetrit Organization\u2019s 401 Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. The AI firm, which focuses on housing and healthcare, will occupy approximately half the building as it relocates from 33 East 33rd Street.\nManhattan office leasing reached pre-pandemic levels\nin the fourth quarter\n, posting its best quarter since late 2019 with 11.9 million square feet in leases, according to Colliers.

        "content": "750 Lexington Avenue\nhas officially left the Cohen Brothers orbit.\nThe\ntroubled office tower\nhit the auction block on Wednesday in Lower Manhattan, but failed to garner any bids. The upset price, or minimum bid, was set at $161,854,848.66, but the property returned to the lender.\nThe auction did garner questions from one potential bidder, who brought legal counsel, about whether the plaintiff would consider lowering the minimum bid. But that would-be buyer declined to identify himself.\nThe auction marks not only a change in ownership for the office building, but a new low point for billionaire\nCharles Cohen, who heads Cohen Brothers\n. Cohen has lost control of several properties in his fights with lenders. But 750 Lex was a legacy property for the company, developed in the 1980s by Cohen\u2019s father and home to the company\u2019s own offices.\nThe foreclosure and auction are the result of a $130 million refinancing loan on the property that Cohen personally sponsored in 2015. At the time, 750 Lex was valued at $300 million, according to Morningstar Credit. Now, the most recent appraisal put it at\njust $41 million\n\u2014 marking an 85 percent haircut.\nThe building, also called 1 International Plaza, is 30 stories and sits at the corner of East 59th Street and Lexington Avenue, where Midtown meets the Upper East Side.\nThe financial freefall at the building began in 2022, when occupancy began to slip and Cohen fell behind on payments. Major retail tenant Zara left its space and months later beleaguered coworking company WeWork stopped paying its rent, according to information provided to Morningstar.\nNet operating income in 2023 was a quarter of what it was when the loan was underwritten. Occupancy, once full, fell to 69 percent.\nCohen worked out a lease amendment with WeWork after the company declared bankruptcy, shortening the term and tying rent to revenue from the space. But it wasn\u2019t enough to save the building.\nSpecial servicer LNR Partners filed a foreclosure case in 2024 and won a\nsummary judgment\nthis past summer.\nAs of June, occupancy had ticked back up to 73 percent, according to Morningstar Credit. But net operating income, which does not include debt service, was just 1.8 million, just 14 percent of what it was in 2015.\nElsewhere, Cohen continues to battle with Fortress Credit. The billionaire owes a $187 million personal debt to the lender after defaults on a $534 million loan portfolio he had guaranteed. He has so far sold two buildings \u2014 3 East 54th Street and 623 Fifth Avenue \u2014 to Vornado Realty Trust and used $52 million of the proceeds to pay Fortress. The lender has asked the court for a receiver to sell off Cohen\u2019s assets, saying the developer\n\u201ccannot be trusted\u201d\nto do so himself.\nIn response, Cohen apparently told the court he was working out a refinancing deal with a realty trust, according to court documents from Fortress. A judge has asked Cohen to present concrete evidence of that process.\n",

The filing was a two-page summons, rather than a full lawsuit, leaving many details up in the air.\nThe board of the prewar luxury building in the Upper West Side claims there are construction and operational issues at the property. There were a handful of lawsuits filed by owners at the building before\nCIM took ownership\nin 2021 following foreclosure on the junior mezzanine position of the property (and three others).\nIn addition to CIM, company principal Jason Schreiber is also named as a defendant, according to the filing made in the State Supreme Court. The company did not respond to a request for comment from the publication and had not yet filed a formal response to the summons.\nThe notorious HFZ Capital Group acquired a four-building portfolio from Westbrook Partners in 2013 for $610 million, teaming with Fortress Investment Group on the deal. The portfolio consisted of 743 rental units, which the partners subsequently began converting into residential condos.\nHFZ projected a $316 million sellout of the Astor\u2019s roughly 100 units when sales began in 2015. As of last year, more than a dozen developer-owned units remained available, according to a CIM filing, though an $8 million unit\nwent into contract\nrecently.\nUnfortunately for CIM, the lawsuit is a familiar refrain for the developer.\nResidents at 432 Park Avenue \u2014 the pencil-thin supertall that helped define Billionaires\u2019 Row \u2014 are\nfiling lawsuits\nover alleged cracks and faults at the building, developed by CIM and Macklowe Properties.\nConsultants hired by residents estimate repairs of the cracking building could exceed $160 million. The board alleges the developers sold defective units and concealed structural flaws. CIM denies wrongdoing, calling the deterioration claims \u201cbaseless\u201d and blaming the board for poor maintenance.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Looks like\nCarolwood Estates\nfound a way to go international minus the overhead of opening new offices.\nThe Beverly Hills-based boutique brokerage struck a partnership with London property consultancy Knight Frank, further expanding the brand\u2019s reach into the global markets.\nCarolwood\nadds the ability to attract prospective buyers globally to its inventory of Los Angeles-area luxury properties. Knight Frank, meanwhile, gains a fast-rising boutique brand as a local partner.\nLast year, Carolwood\nranked fourth\namong Los Angeles County\u2019s top brokerages, based on volume of on-market deals closed between July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025. The brokerage notched $3.3 billion across 478 transactions, making a sizable jump after debuting on\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s 2024 ranking at No. 8.\nCarolwood\u2019s client base and inventory are the \u201cperfect fit,\u201d for Knight Frank business,\u201d CEO and co-founder Drew Fenton said in a press release.\nSpecifics of how the partnership between the two firms is structured and whether it\u2019s simply referrals or also includes marketing, licensing or other terms are unclear.\nA Carolwood spokesperson referred any questions to a press release on the deal. Knight Frank did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\nFor Knight Frank, the partnership places its name back into the mix within the U.S. in a big way after its 15-year relationship with\nDouglas Elliman\nended in June. The two companies continue to work with one another on a referral basis. Douglas Elliman announced plans to launch its own international business before the two sides agreed to end their affiliation in June.\nKnight Frank is now eyeing other brokerages in high-end markets domestically, including New York, Miami, Palm Beach and Aspen.\nFenton and the management team at Carolwood, which was founded in November 2022, have remained firm in a strategy of building a strong, local presence in LA\u2019s high end rather than aim to build a national business.\nStill, the brokerage found ways to expand without minimal operating costs. In March, it became the exclusive Los Angeles affiliate for Forbes Global properties, giving Carolwood access to the Forbes audience and prospective buyers and sellers.\nIn May, Carolwood made good on its desire to own the local high-end when it launched its private listings portal, called\nCarolwood Private Portal\n, in a bid to take advantage of its market share.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to be a national brand. We don\u2019t want to be a national brand,\u201d Nick Segal, co-founder and managing broker, told\nTRD\nat the time of the private listings portal launch. \u201cWe want to be your resource to Beverly Hills and Los Angeles.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Illinois is investigating possible housing discrimination by the landlord of a Chicago South Shore apartment complex that became ground zero for a high-profile immigration raid last year, alleging the owners may have coordinated with federal agents to intimidate tenants and force them out.\nThe Illinois Department of Human Rights said late Wednesday that it filed a formal charge against the owners and managers of the 130-unit building at 7500 South Shore Drive. They include 7500 Shore A, Wisconsin-based investor Trinity Flood and property manager Strength in Management, according to the agency. The New York Times\nreported\nthat the probe centers on claims that the landlords alerted federal authorities to Venezuelan immigrants living in the building in an effort to coerce Black and Hispanic residents \u2014 including U.S. citizens \u2014 into leaving.\nGov. JB Pritzker called the allegations \u201cdeeply troubling,\u201d saying state law bars not only direct discrimination, but also conduct that aids or abets efforts to interfere with housing and civil rights, as first\nreported\nby the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\u201cIllinois will not tolerate conduct that puts anyone in Illinois at risk of discrimination or harm,\u201d Pritzker said in a statement.\nThe case stems from a\nSept. 30 raid\nthat left the building in chaos and drew national attention. Federal agents arrested at least 37 people, most of them Venezuelan nationals, during what witnesses described as a sweeping operation that included detaining U.S. citizens for hours and separating children from their parents. Residents told the Sun-Times some tenants hid neighbors inside their apartments to avoid arrest.\nAt the time, officials with the Trump administration said the raid targeted unauthorized immigrants, some with alleged ties to criminal gangs. But the scale of the operation \u2014 and its focus on a distressed building in a predominantly Black neighborhood \u2014 raised questions about why the property was singled out.\nAccording to the state, the new investigation will examine whether the landlords\u2019 actions amounted to an illegal attempt to clear the building of tenants. In the year leading up to the raid, management filed 25 eviction cases against tenants and squatters, more than the total filed over the previous four years combined, according to the Sun-Times. Most residents were paying rent of between $900 and $1,050 a month.\nThe property\u2019s troubles didn\u2019t end with the raid. Last month, the remaining residents were\nforced out\nafter the building was\nforeclosed on\n, along with two other South Side properties tied to Flood.\nStrength in Management and Flood\ndid not respond to requests for comment.\n\u201cThe conduct alleged in this matter reflects more than isolated harm,\u201d Illinois Department of Human Rights Director Jim Bennett told the Sun-Times. \u201cIt describes a pattern of intimidation that reverberates through our communities.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Is this the final cut for the Bel Air speculative mansion known as\nLa Fin\n?\nThe party property at\n1200 Bel Air Road\n, with a nightclub and screening rooms, is back on the market this month with a new price tag of just under $100 million. At roughly 105,000 square feet, the asking price amounts to about $952 per square foot.\nWith the 12-bedroom, 17-bathroom resort-inspired home now out of the nine-figure club, will the new price be just what the property needs to find a buyer?\nSome of the listing agents \u2014 part of a small army from across multiple brokerages \u2014 say yes.\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California CEO and co-founder Aaron Kirman said the thinking behind the new asking price reflects a \u201cmore pragmatic luxury market.\u201d\nThe home\u2019s got its marketing ground covered with some of Los Angeles\u2019 top names tapped to sell the property. Aside from Kirman, that group includes Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s Tomer Fridman, Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Shauna Walters and Nicole Plaxen, Douglas Elliman\u2019s Jacob Greene and Josh Altman and Compass\u2019 Sally Forster Jones.\nWalters, who made the move to\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\nwith her team co-founder Plaxen late last year, called out market dynamics where discerning buyers are leading conversations with sellers.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had consistent interest around La Fin, and for some time people have been asking the owner to make this move,\u201d Walters said. \u201cIt\u2019s a smart response to today\u2019s buyer mindset.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t the first price cut and the drop does take the mansion below $100 million after testing market appetite first in 2022 with a $139 million ask.\nSince then, the property has seen several reductions, including the most recent in October, when the listing price moved to $108.9 million before exiting the market in December.\nA significant point to consider is the\nMeasure United to House L.A.\ntwo-tier tax, which applies to all real estate deals within the city of Los Angeles starting at $5.3 million. The so-called mansion tax would no doubt apply to a trade of La Fin, triggering the higher 5.5 percent levy on the deal.\nAt the home\u2019s original asking price of $139 million, that equates to $7.6 million. If the home trades at its current listing price, the ULA tax pencils out to $5.5 million.\nThe estate sits on over 2 acres and was built by real estate investor and physician Joseph Englanoff, who paid $5 million for the property in 2014. The home\u2019s highlights are many and include the acceptance of payment in crypto, a six-car vehicle display elevator, spa, wine cellar, cigar lounge, rock climbing wall and massage room.\nEnglanoff\u2019s name is well-known in L.A. real estate as he was also a lender on Nile Niami\u2019s\nThe One\nspec mansion at 944 Airole Way in Bel Air, which at one time sought $295 million. The property was sold at auction in 2022 to\nRichard Saghian\n, founder of fast-fashion company\nFashion Nova\n, for $141 million.\n",

        "content": "After a year of plummeting value and questions about 225 Bush Street\u2019s fate, the downtown San Francisco office tower appears poised to emerge from its pit of distress.\nLenders have\nbegun the process of selling\na $350 million nonperforming loan tied to 225 Bush Street, the San Francisco Business Times reported. The special servicer overseeing the note is reportedly in discussions with JLL about putting the loan on the market, multiple people with knowledge of the matter told the Business Times. A formal listing has yet to emerge.\nBuilding owner Kylli\ndefaulted on the note in November 2024\n, and the 22-story tower\u2019s lenders have floated various options to settle the nonperforming debt, including working out a deal with Kylli, listing the debt for sale and pursuing foreclosure at the site. By putting the debt up for sale, a buyer could either move to foreclose on 225 Bush or arrange a deal with Kylli to take ownership of the 580,972-square-foot building.\nKylli, a subsidiary of Chinese investor Genzon Investment Group, acquired a majority stake in 225 Bush Street, once the headquarters of Standard Oil Corporation, in 2014. At the time, the building\u2019s value was placed at $350 million. In 2019, Kylli bought a minority stake from San Francisco-based Flynn Properties and refinanced the building with the $350 million loan. The building\u2019s appraised value that year was $589 million.\nIn December 2024, after the owner stopped making payments on the loan, the\nbuilding\u2019s appraised value dropped\nto $153 million, or approximately $263 per square foot. Last August, lenders sued to have the building placed into receivership, putting management operations in the hands of a third party rather than Kylli. Douglas Wilson of Douglas Wilson Companies was appointed as receiver that month, and the firm has been working with JLL on leasing at the building since then, according to San Francisco Superior Court documents cited by the Business Times.\nThe property at 225 Bush is hardly the first San Francisco office building to fall into loan default after the pandemic. Last month, Columbia Property Trust\nreceived a notice of default\nafter missing payments on\na $1.7 billion\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities loan backed by\n650 California Street\nand 201 California Street, both in San Francisco\u2019s Financial District, and five other office buildings across the country. In October, lenders\nfiled a lawsuit\nto initiate foreclosure proceedings at 55 Hawthorne Street after CIM Group defaulted on a $61.5 million loan backed by the property.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The Dallas Mavericks are zooming in on the hunt for their next home court between two sites within the city limits, but the final call may still be months away.\nThe NBA franchise is now focused on a downtown Dallas location and the former Valley View Center property, a 110-acre tract at Preston Road and I-635, according to\ncomments\nfrom Mavericks CEO Rick Welts. Speaking to the Dallas Morning News, Welts said the team has been working closely with city officials to advance the two options.\n\u201cWe have identified, with the city, two city of Dallas locations that we are focusing all our time and attention on now, and hoping to bring one of them to success,\u201d\nWelts\ntold the outlet.\nA downtown site could include the land beneath\nDallas City Hall\n, though that option hinges on whether the city ultimately preserves or demolishes the I.M. Pei\u2013designed building. Other downtown parcels have been floated in recent months, including land near the planned convention center overhaul.\nNorth Dallas\u2019 Valley View site, once home to a regional mall, emerged as the other frontrunner. The property\u2019s size makes it attractive for what the team has described as a large-scale mixed-use entertainment district anchored by a new arena.\nThe long-discussed county jail site at 111 Commerce Street has also surfaced as a\ntheoretical option\n, though Dallas County officials have said no formal talks have taken place. The jail sits on 15 acres of riverfront land owned by the county. The property is valued at $109 million, appraisal district records show.\nNo decision is imminent. The Mavericks\u2019 lease at the American Airlines Center runs through 2031, and Welts acknowledged that an earlier goal to announce a site by the end of March has slipped. He now expects a decision closer to July 1, at about the end of the NBA season, according to the publication.\n\u201cRight now, our hope is somewhere around July 1 \u2026 that we are in position to be able to make a decision,\u201d Welts told the outlet, adding that factors beyond the team\u2019s control have pushed the timeline back.\nLast summer, Dallas\nhired\nHillwood Urban Services for $75,000 to help identify and evaluate potential sites for a new NBA arena.\nWelts emphasized that time is tightening, despite the long runway.\n\u201cWe want to open in 2031,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means we\u2019re on the clock.\u201d\nFor a roughly 50-acre mixed-use district with an arena and public spaces, he added, the development timeline is anything but leisurely.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "To conduct its much-maligned crackdown, Immigration and Customs Enforcement needs real estate. One pursuit in the Hudson Valley is being met by swift resistance.\nICE is attempting to buy a warehouse at 29 Elizabeth Drive in Chester, Bloomberg\nreported\n. The owner of the warehouse is an affiliate of billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who didn\u2019t comment to the local press, other than to say he became aware of the situation through a local newspaper.\nLast trading hands at the end of 2021, the warehouse is 60 miles from Manhattan and 15 miles from the airport, relevant when considering ICE\u2019s typical operations under the Trump administration. The property was last valued by Orange County at $25 million.\nThe buyer is one part of the controversy, as recent action in Minneapolis deepened the unpopularity of Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\nThe uproar also pertains to ICE\u2019s likely use for the facility, should a purchase go through. A public notice on the Department of Homeland Security website proposes a guard building, improved security fencing and an outdoor recreation area, all of which seem to point to a detention center.\nNot even local members of Trump\u2019s party are on board with the possibility of a detention center in Chester. Orange County executive Steve Neuhaus, a Republican, opposes an ICE conversion of the facility, preferring to see it redeveloped for light manufacturing or film studio space.\nCongressperson Pat Ryan, a Democrat, submitted a petition with more than 10,000 signatures to DHS, opposing ICE\u2019s pursuit of the warehouse, according to\nNews 12\n.\nThe budget for ICE is one of the flashpoints in the latest government funding fight, though it\u2019s unclear if Democrats have the stomach to push back on full funding for the agency. Last time around, Congress approved $45 billion for expanded enforcement and detention operations as ICE pursues \u201cmega-centers\u201d that can hold thousands of detainees.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The deal has not closed, according to an informed source.\nA $180 million deal for the 54-story, 1.4 million-square-foot office tower at the northern part of L.A.\u2019s Financial District, comes out to about $130 per square foot. That doesn\u2019t account for the three-story retail atrium, which is another 60,000 square feet. Either way, it is nowhere near the debt of $506 million or so that\u2019s in default on the Wells Fargo Center\u2019s North Tower.\nEastdil declined to comment. Neither Brookfield nor 601W responded to requests for comment.\nThe sister Wells Fargo Center \u2014 South tower is not included in the deal; Newmark is\nshopping\nthat one.\nLate last year, there were four Brookfield-related\nofferings\nthat accounted for almost a fifth of Class A office space throughout downtown\u2019s Financial District, including Bunker Hill: EY Plaza, Bank of America Plaza and Wells Fargo Center, the twin tower skyscraper complex.\nThe near-deal on the North Tower could fall through \u2014 a turn that came to pass last year on Carolwood\u2019s $130 million deal to purchase EY Plaza at 725 South Figueroa Street, another office building owned by Brookfield, but in a receiver\u2019s hands. Carolwood\u2019s deal collapsed in due diligence. The note later came back to market and there are\nrumblings of a deal\n.\nThe Well Fargo North Tower is 61 percent leased, and the Halo, the retail property, is only 35 percent leased, according to an earlier marketing memorandum. The distressed debt on the real estate includes a mezzanine loan from Oaktree Capital Management, in which Brookfield owns a controlling interest. Brookfield could own Oaktree entirely if its bid to acquire the remaining interest in Oaktree, which was once headquartered at the North Tower, goes through.\n",

        "content": "The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is facing backlash from veterans over a plan to build up to 800 tiny homes this year on its West Los Angeles campus.\nThe proposal, which\nsurfaced this week\nduring a federal court hearing, calls for the construction of hundreds of 8-by-8-foot sheds to house veterans, the Los Angeles Times reported. Critics, including veterans themselves, argue that the small structures that are often used as quick fixes for homelessness are cramped, inaccessible and unfit for lengthy stays.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s suitable at all,\u201d said Rob Reynolds, an Iraq war veteran who was part of a 2022 federal lawsuit asking for more housing. That effort also called for an end to\nleases of large portions of the 388-acre campus\nto outside interests such as the University of California, Los Angeles, and the Brentwood School.\nThe more than 100 tiny homes already installed near San Vicente Boulevard have already proven problematic, particularly for residents using wheelchairs and walkers. Fire safety and durability have also emerged as concerns.\nIn 2024, U.S. District Court Judge David O. Carter ordered the VA to build more than 2,500 units of temporary and permanent housing on top of an earlier mandate for 1,200 permanent units. In December, an\nappeals court upheld that order\n. Carter questioned in the hearing on Tuesday whether relocating homeless veterans from Skid Row to small sheds on the Westside would meaningfully improve their situation and suggested money might be better spent elsewhere.\nThe tiny home push also risks colliding with a\nseparate directive from President Donald Trump\nin May. The president\nissued an executive order\nestablishing a National Center for Warrior Independence on the West Los Angeles campus, envisioned to include housing for up to 6,000 veterans. VA officials have not clarified whether the sheds are meant to satisfy the court order, advance the Warrior Independence center housing or both.\nThe additional residences would replace a parking lot and grass field next to the existing tiny home village alongside San Vicente Boulevard. The VA has enough funds in its current authorization to complete the temporary housing by the end of 2026, but not enough for the permanent housing portion, Robert Fleck, acting principal general counsel for the VA, told the court.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Arselle and Amoroso spent $22 million in August to acquire Alur, a 51-unit property in Pasadena; in October they dropped $44 million for the 119-unit Sofi Topanga complex in Chatsworth and $23 million for the 48-unit Terraces at La Cienega in West Hollywood.\nWith the Amonte platform, Arselle and Amoroso plan to focus on adding high-quality assets in suburban and infill locations in markets with robust demographics, job growth and barriers to new supply.\nAmoroso owns a portfolio that includes hospitality, medical office and self-storage assets in addition to the nearly 8,000 residential units the company has developed, owned or operated, mostly in the Western United States. Since its founding in 1978, the firm has invested in approximately $550 million of real estate assets.

        "content": "Naperville slammed the brakes on a proposed data center this week, rejecting a project that had become one of the most contentious land use fights the Chicago suburb has seen in years.\nAfter months of organized opposition from nearby residents, the City Council voted 6 to 1 to block Karis Critical\u2019s plan for a data center near Naperville and Warrenville roads. The Daily Herald\nreported\nthat neighbors warned the\nfacility\nwould overwhelm local power infrastructure, generate constant noise and introduce diesel emissions into an area surrounded by housing. Most council members ultimately agreed.\n\u201cAll the neighbors have been exhausted by this process,\u201d said James Butt, a nearby resident and technologist who has consulted for data center operators. \u201cI know that everyone is relieved.\u201d\nThe site sits amid a growing cluster of residential neighborhoods, a key factor in the council\u2019s decision. Several members argued that while data centers are increasingly essential infrastructure, this location was a poor fit \u2014 particularly as Illinois grapples with grid constraints and surging demand from hyperscale users.\nCouncil member Supna Jain cited uncertainty around future electricity availability and cost, noting that neither ComEd\u2019s system nor the city\u2019s municipal utility has unlimited capacity. Approving the project, she said, could crowd out other development along the I-88 corridor or saddle the city with costly upgrades.\nThe developer had already scaled back its ambitions. Naples, Florida-based Karis\nreduced\nthe proposal to a roughly 145,000-square-foot facility and agreed to cap power usage at 36 megawatts under a negotiated development agreement. That translated to about 24 megawatts of information technology load, according to project attorney Russ Whitaker. The revision also cut the number of diesel generators on site from 24 to 16, 12 of them dedicated to backup power.\nFive data centers have already gone up in Aurora, with five more entitled and two new applications filed just before the moratorium took effect. Developers have\nclustered data centers\nin recent years near O\u2019Hare International Airport, especially in Elk Grove Village, and an office tower in downtown Chicago sold last year to a Virginia company planning to convert it into a 33-megawatt data center.\nWhitaker asked the council to delay a vote so that updated air dispersion modeling could be presented, arguing the reduced scope materially changed emissions assumptions. Mayor Scott Wehrli supported tabling the decision, calling it premature for a project pegged as a half-billion-dollar investment. The effort failed. Wehrli and council member Nate Wilson abstained, while council member Josh McBroom cast the lone vote against rejection.\nThe concerns went beyond\nscale\n. Opponents argued the project conflicted with the city\u2019s own master plan, which envisions medium-density residential development on the property. Council member Ian Holzhauer pointed to Naperville\u2019s housing shortage, suggesting the land could ultimately have more public benefit as homes rather than servers.\nKaris said it is reassessing its options. A spokesperson told the publication that the firm had committed to investing hundreds of millions into a \u201cbest-in-class\u201d facility and is now evaluating other sites across the region.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The owners of 745 Fifth Avenue are waving the white flag on a residential conversion and recommitting to offices, a pivot that underscores how far Manhattan\u2019s top-tier office market has clawed back.\nRithm Capital and the von Finck family abandoned plans to turn the Plaza District tower into apartments last year, according to a recent Fitch Ratings report detailed by\nCrain\u2019s\n. Instead, the partners are moving forward with a $275 million refinancing that includes nearly $40 million of fresh equity and another $25 million earmarked for future leasing costs, capital improvements and other expenses.\nThe prewar, 470,000-square-foot building was about 37 percent vacant as of October, featuring roughly 200,000 square feet of office space to fill. The retail portion is spoken for: Bergdorf Goodman\u2019s men\u2019s store occupies the base. Upstairs, tenants enjoy Central Park views.\nControl of 745 Fifth changed hands last month when\nRithm acquired Paramount Group\n, which bought the building in 2002 for $263 million. Paramount had previously explored conversion options, part of a broader wave of Midtown landlords testing whether obsolete offices could pencil out as housing.\nRithm declined to spell out why the conversion was shelved, but costs loom large. The city comptroller\u2019s office has pegged the conversion of 750 Third Avenue at $663 per square foot. Applied to 745 Fifth, that kind of pricing would push a resi overhaul north of $300 million.\nInstead, ownership is betting that spectacular views and the building\u2019s Fifth Avenue address \u2014 across from the Plaza Hotel and next door to LVMH\u2019s new tower \u2014 will be enough to pull in tenants willing to pay for prime Midtown space.\nIn a statement, Rithm said it sees \u201cstrong demand for high-quality space\u201d and expressed confidence in the long-term fundamentals of New York\u2019s premier office corridors.\nThat optimism isn\u2019t happening in a vacuum. Manhattan leasing hit 42 million square feet in 2025, the busiest year since before the pandemic, according to Colliers; volume was up 25 percent from 2024.\nWhile large swaths of older office inventory remain distressed, trophy assets in elite locations have been telling a different story.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The project will have a roughly 5,000-square-foot retail space for a grocer or pharmacy. A rooftop pooldeck is planned, along with two courtyards spanning 8,000 square feet each, one of them with a dog park.\nThe project failed its first shot at\nUDRB in November\n, prompting Corwil Architects to come back with a redesigned building. Revised renderings show curving balconies, among other changes, with board members largely hailing the tweaks as improvements.\nVice Chair Gia Zapattini said the Flagler Street-facing fa\u00e7ade still needs work.\n\u201cThe goal is really for a pedestrian to not experience an almost 400-foot long fa\u00e7ade,\u201d she said.\nAlberto Cordoves of Corwil Architects said breaking up the massing was the goal in the redesign, and architects can further work on it by adding more glazing.\nBoard member Manuel Gustavo Gallardo argued 5,000 square feet is too small for a grocery store or pharmacy, but the developers\u2019 attorney, Melissa Tapanes Llahues, said this will be a mini-market because demand doesn\u2019t support a full grocery store due to recent additions nearby such as the\nBlock 55\nproject.\nThe board\u2019s approval came with conditions to further break up the fa\u00e7ade fronting Flagler Street, study other types of balcony railings, especially for the units on the ground floor and facing the courtyards, and provide more details of the landscaping.\nAtlantic Pacific Companies\u2019 Culmer Place V in Overtown\nAtlantic Pacific Companies scored approval for the second phase of its Culmer Place affordable housing project in Miami\u2019s Overtown, despite some board members\u2019 concerns with the design.\nMiami-based Atlantic Pacific plans the seven-story Culmer Place V project with\n375 apartments\n, including 94 units reserved for \u201cextremely low income\u201d residents and the majority for households earning up to 80 percent of the area median income.\nMiami-Dade\u2019s annual AMI is $87,200, according to the Florida Housing Finance Corporation, though that will be updated in the spring.\nThe development adds to the recently completed 239 affordable units on the site, at 801 Northwest Seventh Avenue. Atlantic Pacific received temporary certificates of occupancy for the first two buildings and the amenity building late last year, said Nicole Wolfe, an attorney for the developer.\nThe firm is leasing the nearly 14-acre site, formerly home to a public housing complex, from Miami-Dade under a 99-year term. Culmer Place is constructed in phases in part to avoid displacement of existing residents. Redevelopments of Miami-Dade public housing generally give renters the right of first refusal for the new apartments.\nCulmer Place V also is designed by Corwil Architects. Board members brought up similar issues with the design of this project as they did with Cornerstone and Brookstone\u2019s Little Havana building.\n\u201cThere\u2019s another 376-foot long building, and I have a hard time seeing the separation. I know you changed the material, but I see a giant 400-foot long concrete block,\u201d Zapattini said. \u201cIt\u2019s very repetitive.\u201d\nIn his presentation, Sergio Rodriguez of Corwil said \u201cspecial attention was given to the design of the fa\u00e7ades \u2026 [adding] vertical and horizontal bands working in conjunction.\u201d\nBoard members brought up issues with the lack of natural lighting in portions of the building and long internal corridors and walkways from the garage, which could pose difficulties for elderly residents.\nThe board approved the project with several conditions for tweaks, including to break up the fa\u00e7ade, add glazing at the end of a hallway adjacent to the garage, including landscaping and benches, add double doors at some of the pedestrian building entrances, create more privacy for some of the ground-floor units and add signage to the site.\nCorwil Architects\u2019 representative said designers are amenable to those changes.\nLive Local Act projects can skip UDRB\nTwo Live Local Act projects on the agenda skipped the board hearing, after the developers and the city attorney\u2019s office determined a review by such a committee isn\u2019t necessary under state law.\nThe Florida Legislature approved the Live Local Act in 2023, tweaking it in subsequent years. It allows developers to bypass public hearings and obtain administrative approvals if they designate 40 percent of units for households earning no more than 120 percent of the AMI.\nCrescent Heights\nplans\n1,307 units\nwith a 50-story tower housing 780 market-rate apartments and a 28-story building with the 527 workforce apartments. The project is proposed for the site at 3180 Biscayne Boulevard, a few blocks north of Crescent\u2019s\nForma\napartment tower completed last year.\nAlso, an entity with ties to Brickell-based Momentum Real Estate Partners wants to develop a 12-story Live Local project with 195 units and nearly 4,000 square feet of ground-floor retail.\n",

        "content": "A heavy equipment firm scored approval for its headquarters on more than 200 acres outside Miami-Dade County\u2019s Urban Development Boundary, including paving over wetlands in a plan to develop a headquarters.\nCounty planning staff members opposed the proposal and recommended commissioners deny the application, which has riled environmentalists decrying the loss of wetlands necessary for flood mitigation.\nMiami-Dade is generally a developer-friendly county where officials for years have accommodated project proposals. But the county has its limits, drawing a\nhard line\nagainst construction outside the urban development boundary. That invisible line was drawn to restrain suburban sprawl onto wetlands, farmland and open land, and toward the Everglades to the west and Biscayne National Park to the east.\nHeavy equipment firm Kelly Tractor wants to move its headquarters outside the boundary, including building over about 160 acres of wetlands near Sweetwater and opening a facility where it would sell, store and repair machinery, WLRN\nreported\n. Kelly Tractor, based in Doral, owns more than 245 acres outside the UDB.\nMiami-Dade commissioners on Thursday voted in favor of the proposal for a text amendment to label the site as \u201cMIA Transportation and Infrastructure Support Area,\u201d imposing several conditions for wetland mitigation and for the project site plan to come back as an administrative site plan application.\nCounty planners\u2019 recommendation for denial says Kelly Tractor failed to show why it can\u2019t expand at its current Doral site and why it needs the UDB expansion, pointing out the county has about 700 acres of land for industrial development within the boundary.\nBesides that, taxpayers would be on the hook for water, sewer and other infrastructure expansions for the project, and Kelly Tractor\u2019s filing showed no mitigation plan for the wetlands, which are considered top tier in the county.\nKelly Tractor, which didn\u2019t respond to the outlet\u2019s request for comment, said the project is necessary for infrastructure projects such as highways and prisons.\nAn attorney for Kelly Tractor said at the meeting the firm has outgrown its current space and the county has no site within the UDB large enough for the firm\u2019s expansion.\nWetlands \u200a\u201care very functional. They\u2019re part of the solution for flooding for [Miami-Dade County],\u201d Laura Reynolds, science director at Hold the Line Coalition, told WLRN. \u201c\u200aSweetwater floods all the time and, these are the things that should be considered when we make these decisions.\u201d\nOver the years, Miami-Dade has taken up other applications for development outside the UDB, many of them proving contentious.\nLennar, the second biggest homebuilder nationwide, is partnering with developer Ed Easton and homebuilding consultant Bill Albers on the proposal for\nCity Park\nwith 7,800 homes and 2.4 million square feet of commercial space, including schools, and public parks outside the UDB. While proponents say this \u201ccity within a city\u201d will be self-contained, opponents argue it would worsen congested traffic headed to employment hubs. The project is expected to come up for a vote later this year.\nDevelopers Stephen Blumenthal and Jose Hevia scored commission approval in 2022 for their\nSouth Dade Logistics &amp; Technology District\non 379 acres outside the UDB. The vote came after five tries in front of commissioners, with the developers agreeing to concessions, including roughly halving the project size. South Dade Logistics was later\nquashed in court\nin 2024.\u00a0\u00a0\u2013\nLidia Dinkova\n",

This first phase of the project will include a proposed 450 apartments on an 8.6-acre stretch between 2101 and 2201 Donley Drive, according to\ncity documents\n. It is less than a mile from the Q2 Stadium, home to Austin FC. The entire mixed-use development also will include land across the street, from 2111 to 2115 Kramer Lane. TDLR filings are preliminary and subject to change.\nTurnbridge proposed 450 multifamily units on the 8.6-acre stretch of Donley Drive and persuaded the city of Austin to\nrezone the area\nfor tall, dense development last year. Currently, four commercial buildings operate on the property. Under the city\u2019s new zoning, the land can accommodate mixed-use residential construction up to 491 feet high, or about 45 stories.\nHowever, the developer\u2019s submitted plan for 2101-2201 Donley Drive describes a wood-framed, six-story multifamily building. The ground floor will include retail elements. The multifamily building will have an adjacent seven-story precast parking garage, according to the filing.\nA Turnbridge associate named in the filing did not immediately respond for comment.\nTurnbridge acquired the acreage, now called the Q2 Assemblage, between 2019 and 2020 for an undisclosed price as the Q2 Stadium was taking shape. The stadium opened in 2021, coinciding with the launch of\nAustin FC\n.\nThe development will be about two miles from The Domain, a residential, office and retail center in Northwest Austin. Companies that\nlease\nor operate at The Domain include\nIndeed\n,\nIKEA\n,\nWeWork\nand\nPayPal\n.Another developer,\nBrandywine Realty Trust\n, plans to build a mixed-use campus at 11501 Burnet Road, across from The Domain, after IBM vacates it next year.\n",

        "content": "Loews Hotels is doubling down on Arlington\u2019s entertainment district, unveiling plans for a third hotel that would replace the aging Sheraton near Globe Life Field with a sprawling, high-end convention property.\nThe New York-based hotelier plans to build the 507-room Americana by Loews Hotels at 1300 Ballpark Way, tearing down the existing 311-room Sheraton Arlington Hotel that dates to the late 1980s, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. The project will include 39 suites and more than 83,000 square feet of meeting and event space, capped by a 10,000-square-foot event barn.\nThe Sheraton is\nslated for implosion\nin early June, with construction on the new hotel expected to begin later this summer. Loews projects an opening in late 2028 or early 2029. Total investment is expected to exceed $500 million, Loews Hotels President and CEO Alex Tisch told the outlet.\nThe project is designed to capitalize on growing demand for hotel rooms and large-scale meeting space in Arlington, which has increasingly positioned itself as a meetings and events hub \u2014 not just a game-day destination. Tisch said proximity to Dallas, Fort Worth and DFW International Airport has helped lure corporate events, including from Fortune 500 companies.\n\u201cWe bought the Sheraton property thinking that there may be a greater opportunity in the future,\u201d Tisch told the publication, calling the site one of the last major development opportunities in the district.\nThe redevelopment will free up roughly 13 acres. A new parking garage will serve the hotel and surrounding venues, though only about half the land is slated for the hotel and garage. The remaining acreage is unprogrammed for now, though Tisch said the company has zoning and financing flexibility for future development.\nThe city of\nArlington\nis backing the project through a public-private partnership approved by City Council in late 2023. The city is expected to contribute $40 million toward development costs and provide more than $57 million in grants over 25 years if performance benchmarks are met, according to the outlet.\nLoews\nwill front the initial capital.\nAmericana by Loews takes its name from the late, iconic Americana Hotel in Bal Harbour, Florida, a Loews landmark that opened in 1956.\nThe site sits less than a mile from Loews\u2019 recently opened\nArlington Hotel &amp; Convention Center\n, an 888-room property that opened in early 2024 between Globe Life Field and Choctaw Stadium. Loews also opened the $150 million, 300-room Live! by Loews Hotel in 2019.\nWhen complete, Loews\u2019 Arlington campus will total nearly 1,700 rooms and more than 374,000 square feet of meeting space.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A mixed-use project near San Antonio\u2019s River Walk, years in the planning process, is now moving forward.\nMcCombs Enterprises landed a favorable zoning change Tuesday for its 6-acre site at\n326 West Jones Avenue\nand Camden Street, clearing another hurdle for a dense, multi-building development along the northern stretch of the San Antonio River. The San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\nthat the city\u2019s Zoning Commission unanimously approved an infill designation for the property, allowing multiple structures to rise on the site. The item moved through consent without opposition.\nThe San Antonio-based firm, founded by late billionaire Red McCombs, had previously said in 2023 that it was partnering with Denver-based developer Realberry \u2014 formerly known as McWhinney \u2014 on the project. A revised site plan filed with the city envisions eight buildings totaling more than 1 million square feet, marking a significant expansion from earlier concepts.\nWhile individual building heights weren\u2019t specified in the latest filing, the plan sets a maximum height of 15 stories. A December version showed a range of three to 17 stories. The project will have up to 390 apartments, roughly 265,500 square feet of office space, 57,400 square feet of food and beverage and about 58,600 square feet of retail.\nRecords released in 2023 showed an earlier plan called for 325 apartments and just 70,000 square feet of offices, with an estimated development cost of $295 million. The latest iteration points to a much larger project in the River North submarket, which has been steadily filling in with residential, cultural and office projects tied to the Museum Reach extension of the River Walk.\nMcCombs\nbought the property from CPS Energy in 2023 for $29.5 million. The site is expected to leverage a\nmunicipal management district\ncreated by the Texas Legislature that same year, giving the development the ability to levy property taxes and issue bonds to help fund infrastructure and other improvements.\nThe zoning change still needs final approval from the San Antonio City Council at a future meeting.\nThe project adds to a growing downtown San Antonio presence for the McCombs family. The firm is part of the team of developers transforming the 30-story, 240,000-square-foot\nTower Life\noffice tower into affordable apartments at 301 South Saint Mary\u2019s Street.\nIn 2024, the family bought out the ground lease beneath the former Holiday Inn at 318 West Cesar Chavez Boulevard, gaining full control of the 4.5-acre property near Hemisfair. The late Red McCombs helped develop the hotel ahead of Hemisfair \u201968.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Together, the entities hold a portfolio that has been controlled for years by members of the Jemal family and has been the source of a bitter back-and-forth.\nSteve alleges that Alan and Ruth have essentially seized control of the businesses and refused to provide access to the books, leaving him \u201cblind as to his cash flow,\u201d per the suit. Alan and Ruth allegedly moved money between entities, paid themselves management fees and used company funds to cover personal expenses ranging from luxury car leases to charitable donations and streaming subscriptions, the suit alleges.\nSteve claims his monthly distributions were slashed while the other family members continued to receive larger payments, per the complaint. In addition to monetary damages, Steve is asking the court to appoint a neutral receiver or permanent third-party manager to run the companies.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the family has ended up in court. The brothers previously battled over the same portfolio in a series of lawsuits filed in 2020, which were settled in June 2022. The alleged misconduct has continued, prompting the latest action, per the suit.\nLawyers for Steve and Alan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Overlooked amid the Trump administration\u2019s steady beat of stunning news \u2014 ICE actions, the Greenland takeover threat, the Venezuela incursion \u2014 is a steady beat of actions targeting criminals.\nUnfortunately, these criminals are being targeted not for arrest and prosecution, but for clemency and pardons. They are all white-collar crooks, some convicted of duping mom-and-pop investors.\nThese crimes often involve real estate schemes, where smooth-talking businessmen (they\u2019re always men, it seems) round up money to invest in properties offering robust returns.\nInstead, they spend the money to support a high-flying lifestyle involving fancy cars, luxury travel, Rolex watches and expensive restaurants. Creating an image of success allows them to raise more money from new and repeat victims before it all unravels.\nIn recent years, another kind of real estate fraud has been popping up. In this scheme, the victims are not unsophisticated investors \u2014 or investors who are just smart enough to think they cannot be fooled.\nInstead, they are lenders and government-sponsored entities such as Fannie and Freddie. This kind of fraud has kept\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s Keith Larsen\nbusy\nfor the past two years.\nMy question is, why is President Donald Trump letting any of these people out of their sentences? And he\u2019s not waiting until the waning days of his term, like he did\nlast time\n.\nTrump seems immune to the normal rules of politics. The fact that one\nserial fraudster\nhe pardoned in 2021 went\nright back to committing crimes\nhasn\u2019t slowed the president\u2019s pardon operation. Nor have\nstories about victims\nof criminals he\u2019s freed.\nIn the\nlatest example\n, Trump erased Brooklyn developer Jacob Deutsch\u2019s\nfive-year prison term\n, fine and related penalties.\nDeutsch and cousin Aron\nran this scheme for years\n, forging documents to inflate property values and then borrowing against them.\nDeutsch forged signatures on leases and filled empty apartments with furniture and clothing so visiting lenders would think they were occupied. He even doctored utility bills and fabricated bank deposits to show rental income.\nTrump let Jacob but not Aron Deutsch off the hook. Recently the president did the same for the Long Island-based leader of a\nmajor fraud\nbut not any of his\naccomplices\n. The Department of Justice said its own prosecutors in the latter case had trumped up the charges, but if that\u2019s true, shouldn\u2019t the president have wiped out all of the resulting convictions?\nTrump haters probably think he\u2019s selling pardons, but that seems illogical given that he\u2019s already found safe ways to amass\nat least $1.4 billion\nduring his presidency.\nSomething else is going on here. At some point it\u2019s going to come out.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nL+M Development Partners and SMJ Development plan 2,035 apartments to replace the current 209 homes at 1754 Fulton Street and 53 Utica Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Part of the site is city-owned, so HPD is involved.\nThe publication didn\u2019t mention City Council member Chi Oss\u00e9, who is poised to negotiate the rezoning. Oss\u00e9\nbelieves in adding supply\n, so chances are this will go through despite any ill will between him and the mayor, who just\nchased him out\nof a congressional race. Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Some years ago, the public advocate began fact-checking its \u201cworst landlords list\u201d before publishing it, to avoid embarrassing mistakes. That practice must have fallen by the wayside, because 35th on its new list is Ariel Belen, who is not a landlord at all \u2014 he\u2019s a\nretired judge\nwho served 18 years on the bench.\nBelen was named a receiver for two troubled Bronx buildings: 214 East 168th Street and 1235 Morris Avenue. It took me three minutes on ACRIS to\ntrace the buildings\nto Isaac Kassirer, who bought buildings at prices later rendered\nunsupportable\nby the 2019 rent law. Sabal Capital owned the debt on those two buildings.\nJoseph Cafiero, No. 4 on the \u201c\u2018worst landlords\u201d list, called me Wednesday to say he, too, is a receiver. Also on the list are\nPeter Fine\nand\nDavid Kramer\n, who have been tapped repeatedly by HPD as reliable operators of affordable housing.\nElsewhere\u2026\nTRD\n\u2019s Lilah Burke looked at Summit Properties\u2019 Tel Aviv Stock Exchange\ndisclosures\nfor more information on its winning bid to buy a 5,141-unit, mostly rent-stabilized portfolio. But one number I\u2019m curious about is how much it will raise from TASE investors, given that it\u2019s already borrowing $338.5 million from Flagstar Bank for the $451.3 million purchase.\nIt appears possible that Summit will close without putting much of its own money into the deal, which always makes a buyer look smart if its plan works out \u2014 and makes the banks and bondholders look foolish if it doesn\u2019t.\nSummit is paying 5.25 percent interest on the Flagstar loan. That\u2019s $17.8 million a year for the first two years. It will have to pay higher interest for the TASE debt. For the sake of argument, let\u2019s say it bonds out the remaining $112.8 million at 8 percent interest \u2014 that\u2019s $9 million a year. It predicts net operating income of $36 million. Subtract $27 million in debt service. Even if its NOI doesn\u2019t account for $6 million a year in planned capital expenditures, it looks like Summit could clear $3 million a year without putting anything down.\nThe Mamdani administration had said Summit was\npaying too much\nto be able to\nmaintain the buildings\nand also pay back its loans. Now it has the blueprint for how Summit intends to do exactly that.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$10.6 million\nfor a 3,700-square-foot condominium unit at 3 Morton Square in the West Village. Glenn Davis, Alex Andrejko, and Shaun Anders with Serhant had\nthe listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$43.7 million\nfor a 16,123-square-foot commercial property at 90 Wooster Street in SoHo. JSRE Acquisitions paid\n$48.5 million\nin 2013.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$11.75 million\nfor a 4,042-square-foot condominium unit at 257 West 17th Street in Chelsea. Kirk Rundhaug, Sean Johnson, and Jordan Christensen at Compass have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 62,705-square-foot, 94-unit residential building at 469 Troy Avenue in Prospect Lefferts Gardens. Leandro Dickson filed the permit on behalf of Yonah Grunhut with the Grun Group.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "South Florida\u2019s luxury segment outperformed lower price points again in the fourth quarter, with cash deals dominating the high end of the market.\nAcross the board, home prices have either dropped, remained flat or grown at a much slower rate than in previous years. This was\nevident in December\nacross Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties, and it was the trend in the fourth quarter.\nDemand is not evenly distributed on the ultra-luxury end either.\nMiami-Dade single-family home sales above $30 million rose 58 percent last year, and condo sales above $20 million increased 37.5 percent. This is a limited segment of the market, with 19 single-family home sales and 11 condo sales in that price point.\nAna Bozovic, founder of Analytics Miami, said deals above $3,000 per square foot set records, especially compared to before the pandemic boom. The same can be said for sales above $1,000 per square foot.\nIn the $1 million and up price point, single-family home sales rose 18 percent year over year in Miami-Dade County. But $1 million-plus condo sales fell 5 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2024.\nAcross Miami-Dade County, single-family home sales rose 3 percent year over year in the fourth quarter. A quarter of those sales were all-cash deals. Condo sales were flat, and half of those were all cash, according to Analytics Miami.\nJonathan Miller, a housing expert who authors Douglas Elliman\u2019s quarterly residential reports, said nearly every market Elliman monitors in Florida showed double-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter.\nThe Miami area has benefited from the slide in mortgage rates and the strength of the financial markets, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incrementally improving market from a transaction standpoint,\u201d he said.\nElliman has reduced the number of cities it taps Miller to track, and in Miami-Dade it now only releases reports on the following:\nMiami Beach, barrier islands\nIn Miami Beach and the barrier islands, which include Bal Harbour, Bay Harbor Islands, Fisher Island, Golden Beach, Indian Creek, Key Biscayne, North Bay Village, Sunny Isles Beach and Surfside, residential sales rose 17 percent to 749 closings. The median sale price fell 3 percent to $745,000, according to the Elliman reports.\nThe story changes when looking at condos versus single-family homes. Eighty-five single-family homes traded in the fourth quarter in the barrier island markets, up just one sale more than the same period in 2024. The median price surged, up 22 percent to $3.7 million.\nCondo sales jumped 19 percent to 664 closings, while the median price tumbled, down 10 percent year over year to $587,500.\nLuxury home sales, defined by Elliman as the top 10 percent of market share, were flat at just nine closings. And condo sales in this price segment increased 21 percent to 68 sales.\nMiller said this market is more of a one-off, and not an indicator of a greater pattern.\nCoral Gables\nNinety-nine single-family homes sold in the fourth quarter in Coral Gables, up 22 percent year over year. Condo sales experienced similar gains, rising 37 percent with 63 closings. Marketwide trends in pricing are seen in the Gables too: the median price for a single-family home was flat at about $1.9 million, and it dropped 8 percent to $530,000. Sales rose in the top 10 percent of deals, as did pricing.\n",

Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat the move puts the New York-based jeweler squarely in the city\u2019s tightest luxury retail corridor, where\nvacancies are scarce\nand rents have held firm even as the broader retail market recalibrates.\nYurman will take roughly 5,000 square feet currently occupied by Versace. It\u2019s unclear whether the Italian fashion house plans to relocate elsewhere in Chicago. Prada Group, Versace\u2019s parent company, did not respond to a request for comment. The space Yurman is leaving at 919 North Michigan is owned by Nuveen Real Estate, a unit of TIAA.\nThe Rush Street address \u2014 also known as 40\u201348 East Walton Street \u2014 sits at the heart of the Oak, Rush and Walton triangle, long considered Chicago\u2019s most exclusive shopping strip. The building is home to other high-end fashion tenants including Dior and Brunello Cucinelli, underscoring the area\u2019s allure for luxury brands seeking dense clusters of affluent foot traffic.\nThe property is owned by a venture of JMB Realty, the Chicago firm led by billionaire Neil Bluhm. JMB and a CBRE broker representing the landlord did not respond to requests for comment. CBRE brokers Luke Molloy, Danny Jacobson and Stephen Ansani had been marketing the Versace space for lease.\nYurman\u2019s move follows a well-worn path. In recent years, Cartier, Chanel and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels have all exited the\nMagnificent Mile\nfor Oak Street, reflecting a broader repositioning of luxury retail in Chicago.\nWhile the Mag Mile remains the city\u2019s most visible shopping boulevard, it continues to wrestle with elevated vacancies and uneven foot traffic after the pandemic, though those vacancies are on the rebound. Lower rents and the return of major brands like\nAritzia and Uniqlo\n, along with new experiential retail, are fueling the comeback.\nAs of the third quarter,\nvacancy\nalong North Michigan Avenue stood at about 28.7 percent, down from the 2024 bottom of 34 percent, according to brokerage Kirsch Agency, even as leasing momentum has slowly improved.

        "content": "Zillow\u2019s\nstandoff with the Chicago area multiple listing service\nremains in limbo this month after the MLS warned last year that listings on the public home search website could be interrupted in January.\nMidwest Real Estate Data (MRED), the MLS operator for Chicago and the surrounding area, sent a message to subscribers in December saying that Zillow officials had been telling brokerages they were \u201canticipating disruptions to listings flowing to Zillow via MRED beginning in the first week of January,\u201d and asking the brokerages to sign direct listing feeds.\nBut so far, it appears Zillow hasn\u2019t started enforcing its listing standards in MRED\u2019s coverage area, according to people familiar with the matter, and Zillow\u2019s access to listings in the region appears uninterrupted.\nThe long-brewing stalemate stems from Zillow\u2019s\nupdated listings standards\ndesigned to curb the growth of brokerage-exclusive listings nationwide. The rules also affect MRED\u2019s Private Listing Network, which allows sellers to show listings to agents in the Chicago area market and their clients, but not to the broader public. Agents who put a listing on the private market and then move to public \u2014 a common tactic for testing prices and part of Compass\u2019 three-phased marketing strategy \u2014 would receive a warning, and eventually have those listings blocked from appearing on Zillow.\nEven while Zillow has enforced its listing standards around the country, it has kept the status quo in Chicago, as it has been working with MRED to resolve the impasse, Zillow previously told\nThe Real Deal\n. MRED has\ndug in on defending the private network\nand said that Zillow could face retaliation, including being cut off from the MLS\u2019 listing feed, for enforcing its standards.\nThe standoff also coincides with changes that allow MRED agents to hide details like price history and days on market when they\u2019re displayed on public portals like Zillow, based on a message MRED sent to some subscribers obtained by\nThe Real Deal.\nIn the message from 2025, MRED said it was adding new display permissions for agents when they put a listing into the MLS, which would begin in January. Notably, the MLS added two new fields allowing agents to hide price history and time on market from the public feeds that Zillow and other portals receive their data from.\nThe new options \u201cenable [MRED\u2019s] brokers and their sellers to have more control over their listings and how they are displayed online,\u201d MRED wrote in the email.\nMRED and Zillow did not respond to requests for comment.\nZillow released an analysis late last year\nclaiming MRED\u2019s private network\nreinforces \u201cdigital redlining,\u201d finding that homes in Chicago\u2019s majority-white neighborhoods were more than twice as likely to be listed on the private platform, compared to those in majority non-white areas. The portal giant argued private listings disadvantage buyers and threaten market transparency.MRED fired back,\naccusing Zillow of using fair housing\nconcerns to mask a strategic play to protect its own revenue by ensuring all listings hit its public site. The MLS defended its Private Listing Network as a necessary option for sellers requiring privacy during sensitive life events \u2014 such as divorce or illness \u2014 and pointed to internal data showing private listings sell faster and for a higher percentage of their asking price.",

        "content": "Accessory dwelling units are poised to become the hottest new housing model in Berkeley after a thumbs-up from city officials.\nThe Berkeley City Council\napproved a proposal\nthat would allow property owners to sell structures such as backyard cottages, basement apartments and other ADUs as condominiums, Berkeleyside reported.\nUnder the new ordinance, property owners will be able to get fast-tracked approval to turn their ADUs into condos without having to go through a public hearing or appeals process. Owners also won\u2019t have to pay fees that the city usually charges to convert units from rental apartments to condos. Homeowners will have to submit a map to the city outlining how they would split up their property. The measure also gives tenants in some older rent-controlled\nADUs\na three-month window to make the first offer to buy their units.\nCity leaders hope that offering ADUs for sale will help create more opportunities for homeownership in the notoriously expensive East Bay city. The median price for a single-family home is approximately $1.4 million and nearly no new condos have been built in decades, according to Berkeleyside.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to create more housing inventory that\u2019s available for less than $1 million \u2014 and hopefully substantially less than $1 million,\u201d Council member Brent Blackaby said at a meeting Tuesday night where the Council approved the change.\nBerkeley homeowners have warmed up to ADUs as a source of rental income or space for family members such as older parents, hence the common\n\u201cgranny flat\u201d\nnickname. Since 2018, the city has issued an average of about 100 building permits for ADUs each year.\nThe change makes Berkeley the latest Bay Area city to embrace selling ADUs as condos. Last year, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously passed\nan ordinance allowing the construction\nand sale of the small units on homeowners\u2019 lots.\nFederal lawmakers have taken notice of ADUs\u2019 role in making homeownership more attainable. Last summer, California Rep. Sam Liccardo \u2014 who represents San Jose \u2014 and New York Rep. Andrew Garbarino proposed the bipartisan Supporting Upgraded Property Projects and Lending for Yards\n(SUPPLY) Act\n, which provides government-backed, flexible financing options to help homeowners break ground on ADUs. The legislation also directs the Federal Housing Administration to provide government backing for second mortgages to finance ADU construction and also permits\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac\nto purchase and securitize those loans.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Venues will include temporary structures like the Long Beach Aquatics Center, set to rise in the parking lot of the Long Beach Convention Center, as well as the Long Beach Arena and Marine Stadium, which previously held events in the 1932 and 1984 Olympics.\nBeyond aquatic sports, Long Beach is looking to be a hotspot of activity for the Olympics in general. In 2023, the city unveiled plans to spend more than $900 million on infrastructure over the next five years. About $200 million of that was set aside for Olympics-focused projects.\nPentland Brands acquired Speedo International and Speedo Australia in the 1990s. The company bought Speedo North America from apparel company PVH Corporation in 2020 for $170 million in anticipation of the Summer Olympics in Tokyo that year before they were postponed to 2021. Globally, Speedo is a major Olympic sponsor and has partnerships with national swimming governing bodies in the U.S., Canada,\nChina\n, Australia and more.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Nuveen Green Capital and Lone Star PACE facilitated the financing. Blom is going to use the funding to make energy efficient updates to the property\u2019s lighting, HVAC, building envelope and hot water system, according to loan documents.\nIn nearby Celina, Irving-based JPI scored $23.5 million in C-PACE funding for the development of Jefferson Ownsby, a 436-unit apartment complex JPI is building at 317 East Ownsby Parkway. Aquarian Holdings and PACE Equity facilitated the financing.\nPrinceton\n, which is about 43 miles northeast of Downtown Dallas, was named the\nfastest-growing city in the country\nin 2025. The Collin County town grew by more than 30 percent from July 2023 to July 2024, bringing its population to just over 37,000 \u2014 more than double what it was at the start of the decade, according to Census estimates.\nCelina is about the same distance from Dallas as Princeton, but due north. Its spot in the North Dallas growth path means it\u2019s been crowned the nation\u2019s fastest-growing city in the past.\nThe growth in Princeton and Celina explains the interest from multifamily developers and investors in providing housing for these markets. It\u2019s a marked difference from the Dallas-Fort Worth multifamily market as a whole, which has been dampened in recent years by tens of thousands of new units coming online at the same time.\nC-PACE has become a\npopular option\nfor developers and investors while institutional lending is still tight. It can be used for up to 25 percent of a project\u2019s capital stack.\n",

Kathy Hochul took the stage during dinner to address the crowd. She touted her State of the State priorities, including a\nproposal\nto reform environmental review.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to continue working with all of you as an ally, to break down barriers, and create the incentives you need,\u201d she said. \u201cI, like you, am sick and tired of the red tape that makes sure that your projects go through hell and back before they ever get done.\u201d\nHochul, who is running for re-election this year, also nodded to the perennial joke \u2014\u00a0but also fact\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0that gala guests often talk over whoever speaks at the event.\nShe said Karen Keogh, secretary to the governor, warned that she should expect a \u201cfeisty\u201d crowd.\n\u201cMy response was, \u2018If they want me to listen to them when they come to Albany, they better listen to me tonight,\u2019\u201d she said.\nAt the end of her speech, she said the crowd wasn\u2019t as bad as last year and that she would talk about policies with Whelan and REBNY Chair Jed Walentas.\nThe gala, which attracts the biggest names in real estate, can also be a temperature check, a way to gauge the political toxicity of the industry at the moment.\nOther elected officials spotted during cocktail hour \u2014 either by\nTRD\nor fellow guests \u2014 included City Council Speaker Julie Menin, state Attorney General Letitia James, City Comptroller Mark Levine, Council member Kevin Riley, state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, Assembly member Kalman Yeger, Council member Eric Dinowitz, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson.\nNassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, a Republican who plans to challenge Hochul, was also there.\nThe landmarked Waldorf Astoria was reopened last year after a\n$2 billion condo conversion\n. Part of the cocktail hour was in the Basildon Room, which offered any wallflowers a chance to admire the gold and silver leafing on the walls, the restored frescoes on the ceiling and the floral carpet, which is blessedly not original to the room but whose design is inspired by its predecessor.\nEarly in the night Soloviev Group\u2019s Michael Hershman said the mayor\u2019s absence was a \u201cmissed opportunity.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the best interests of the real estate community and the mayor to be able to sit down and talk about what\u2019s best for the city, what\u2019s best for the people of the city,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we do that with kind of an open mind, I think we can find common ground.\u201d\n",

The plaintiffs also accuse the county of skipping over basic planning, a safety analysis and procedural fairness.\nThe property, a fuel farm long operated by\nTransMontaigne Partners\n, sits roughly 700 feet from homes and about 2,000 feet from an elementary school serving more than 160 children on a barrier island with no road access, the lawsuit states.\nThe terminal stores roughly 28.3 million gallons of marine fuel in tanks the plaintiffs allege are not up to date with fire codes and sit in a hurricane flood zone. The county has not produced any analysis that would justify extending the facility\u2019s life with appropriate safeguards for Fisher Island residents and employees, according to the suit.\nAn HRP-led entity closed its purchase of the fuel depot in October and agreed to allow TransMontaigne to continue operating the fuel facility until 2027 when a county lease to store boat fuel at the facility expires.\n\u201cWe have been counting days for that lease to terminate,\u201d Ferraro said. \u201cWe fully expected that facility was going to be phased out.\u201d\nHRP, which specializes in redeveloping contaminated sites, has been positioning the property as the \u201clast remaining\u201d large-scale condominium site on the ultra-luxury island with an expectation the fuel tanks would be decommissioned and the site remediated for high-end residential.\nMiami-Dade and HRP negotiations\nHRP entered a development agreement with the Fisher Island Club and the neighborhood association that would carve out 4 acres of the fuel farm site for community improvements, according to the lawsuit.\nIn exchange, the club and the association pledged to support entitlements, grant memberships to condo buyers worth millions of dollars and help HRP navigate government approvals.\nThe association has veto power over any sale or conveyance of the 4 acres, except in circumstances such as a foreclosure or a scenario where HRP fails in good faith to obtain development approvals, the suit states.\nThe complaint asserts the association has the right to control its portion of the site if there is a partial taking by eminent domain, as well as a contractual veto over lease renewals with the county beyond 24-month terms for a six-year period if entitlement approvals lag.\nDespite those recorded rights, the suit claims, the county cut\nFisher Island\nout of backroom talks with HRP that will determine the future of the property.\nIn October, before HRP closed the deal, county commissioners approved a resolution authorizing administrators to acquire the site \u201cby purchase or eminent domain\u201d and to enter private mediation with HRP to negotiate the terms. Miami-Dade elected officials decided to take the property after heavy pressure from the cruise line industry, the complaint alleges.\nWith mediation deadlines passed and Miami-Dade now able to file an eminent domain petition \u201cat any moment,\u201d the club and the association are asking a judge to force the county back to the drawing board.\nThe two entities argue that the county\u2019s taking of the fuel bunker must be supported by a rigorous analysis and a transparent process, not a last-minute scramble to keep the \u201cCruise Capital of the World\u201d running on business as usual.\nSelf\u2011inflicted crisis\nThe lawsuit paints Miami-Dade\u2019s predicament as an institutional failure years in the making.\nFor more than a decade, county business plans never flagged its 2027 lease expiration on the Fisher Island terminal, even though the site is the primary fuel source for cruise and cargo ships at PortMiami, which local officials say underpins tens of billions of dollars in economic impact, the lawsuit alleges.\nAfter TransMontaigne listed the site in 2024 with an asking price of\n$200 million\n, the firm rejected a county purchase offer. Jimmy Morales, the county\u2019s chief operating officer, publicly acknowledged that Miami-Dade officials did nothing to find alternative sites, the lawsuit claims.\nWhen Miami-Dade officials learned that HRP was close to finalizing its purchase, county staff rushed out a bare-bones Oct. 7 report that identified nine alternative sites but dismissed them without feasibility studies, cost-benefit analysis, environmental review or long-range planning, the suit alleges.\nCommissioners themselves expressed doubts about taking the fuel depot at a public meeting in September.\nCommission Chairman Anthony Rodriguez Jr. questioned why the county was \u201ceven talking about eminent domain to a private parcel in the most expensive ZIP code in the country,\u201d and County Commissioner Danielle Cohen-Higgins questioned why they were being asked to act \u201ca week before the closing\u201d with little notice to property owners, according to the complaint.\nThe Fisher Island groups argue that the county\u2019s \u201ccondemnation first, justification later\u201d approach violates the public-use and \u201creasonable necessity\u201d prongs of Florida\u2019s eminent domain law because the fuel facility primarily benefits private cruise lines.\nThe complaint notes that county documents reference fuel barges from nearby ports like Port Everglades as a viable way to maintain operations without seizing Fisher Island land. TransMontaigne also reportedly offered to put up $200 million toward a modern fuel depot at PortMiami that would occupy roughly 1 percent of the 520-acre port.\nFerraro, the attorney for the club and association, said county taxpayers would end up footing the bill if Miami-Dade is allowed to go through eminent domain, which requires government agencies to pay property owners fair market value.\n\u201cTaxpayers will get totally burned,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is going to cost a lot of money to buy it \u2026 and then the county will need to replace the facility. That requires taking the old one down and building a new one. They are going\u00a0 to be spending maybe $500 million.\u201d",

        "content": "A Blackstone-owned Seattle office tower could be underwater \u2014 literally.\nFrankfurt-based Dekabank alleges in a lawsuit that Blackstone Property Partners\u2019 fund failed to repair and maintain the 23-story Exchange Building in Downtown Seattle, allowing \u201cpersistent water intrusions\u201d through the property windows, requiring a full repair of the building facade.\nDekabank, the lender on the property, alleges Blackstone\u2019s inaction has been \u201cdisastrous\u201d and led to at least $17 million in repairs.\nThe German lender further alleges Blackstone was more concerned with the bottom line than the state of the property. Blackstone put off maintenance that would have prevented the water damage, according to the lawsuit.\nDekabank filed the lawsuit in New York Supreme Court on January 21. Blackstone strongly denies the allegation in a statement.\n\u201cDekabank\u2019s claims are without merit,\u201d said a spokesperson for Blackstone. \u201cWe have been responsibly managing this asset since our acquisition in 2017 and are disappointed with the path Dekabank has chosen to take. We will respond in the ordinary course as part of the legal process.\u201d\nDekabank provided an initial $97.1 million loan to Blackstone for the office tower in Downtown Seattle in 2017. Blackstone hired its affiliate Equity Office Management as the property manager.\nIn 2022, Blackstone refinanced the tower again with Dekabank. As part of the refinancing, Blackstone allegedly entered into a carry guarantee, which ensured it would cover operating expenses associated with the project, the lender claims.\nAccording to the lawsuit, Blackstone would have to satisfy 18 different conditions in order for the carry guarantee to expire, including a certification showing it paid all operating expenses.\nDekabank alleges Blackstone failed to satisfy two of the requirements and the carry guarantee remained in place.\nAs it sought to assess whether Blackstone satisfied the conditions of the carry guarantee, Dekabank claims it performed extensive due diligence on the property. During this time period, the loan matured, according to Dekabank\u2019s lawsuit.\nThe lender hired a consultant to perform a wide-ranging evaluation of the property site, structure, facade and windows.\nDekabank called the consultant\u2019s results \u201cshocking.\u201d The property allegedly suffered substantial damage to its facade. The building required $17.2 million in short-term repairs with an additional $13.1 million required in reserves, according to Dekabank.\nPortions of the fa\u00e7ade were exhibiting \u201cdeficiencies and evidence of deferred maintenance,\u201d according to Dekabank.\nWater was allegedly able to infiltrate the property in several locations. The chief engineer of the property even revealed that he was aware of active leaks on the fourth, fifth, 16th, 18th and 21st floors, according to the lawsuit.\nThe property manager also confirmed there had been water leakage issues through the windows and walls of the property since at least 2018, the lawsuit alleges.\n\u201cBorrower undertook little more than band-aid repairs, which were insufficient to stem the tide of water pouring into the property and causing widespread damage,\u201d Dekabank said in its lawsuit.\n",

The floating-rate debt was arranged by Newmark\u2019s Jordan Roeschlaub, Chris Kramer and Holden Witkoff.\nThe financing news comes only weeks after filings shed light on the partners\u2019 plans for the property.\nLate last month, Ofer \u2014 an Israeli billionaire \u2014 and Berman\nfiled plans\nfor a 614-unit office-to-residential conversion.\nThey acquired the 26-story property from BentallGreenOak in February for\nmore than $100 million\n. BGO previously acquired the building with Cove Property Group and Multi-Employer Property Trust from Kushner Companies and CIM Group in 2016\nfor $225 million\n. Shortly thereafter, they embarked on a $70 million renovation.\nTenants at the 400,000-square-foot building have included Independence Point Advisors, Moment Technology and Pro Shop Holdings, according to\nCompStak\n. Several months ago, BGO\nsued\nflex workspace provider Convene, alleging it owed it $10.6 million after failing to make rent payments since February.\nQuantum Pacific and Metro Loft have pursued projects together elsewhere. Last November, Ofer partnered with Berman\non an $88 million purchase\nof 767 Third Avenue, Ofer\u2019s first investment in U.S. commercial real estate. The purchase closed with a $55 million loan from Bank Hapoalim and a conversion is in the works.\nOther prominent FiDi conversion projects in the works include Metro Loft developments at 25 Water Street and 111 Wall Street \u2014 the latter of which recently secured a historic $779 million financing package \u2014 as well as projects at 55 Broad Street and One Wall Street.\nApollo and GIC recently\nprovided an $835 million debt package\nto refinance the 1,320-unit building at 25 Water Street, developed by GFP Real Estate, Metro Loft and Rockwood Capital.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Vornado developed the borough\u2019s sole purpose-built film studio alongside joint venture partners Hudson Pacific Properties and Hudson Pacific Properties.\nThe lease encompasses about a third of the facility, which includes 232,000 leaseable square feet, six soundstages, support space and offices. Paramount intends to use the space to film the second season of the Michael C. Hall-starring \u201cDexter: Resurrection,\u201d which streams on Paramount+.\nThe length and asking rent of the lease were not disclosed and the owners of the studio could not immediately be reached for comment by the publication. The average asking rent for Manhattan industrial space in the fourth quarter was $32.17 per square foot, according to JLL.\nBlackstone and Hudson Pacific\njoined\nthe studio project in August 2023. Alongside Vornado, the three companies invested $350 million in the venture, a public-private partnership with the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation.\nPerks provided to the developers included $73.5 million to repair and maintain the pier until 2060, as well as a starting rent of a mere $900,000 per year, which isn\u2019t due to escalate to a $2.8 million peak until the end of a 99-year lease.\nThere\u2019s also a state program providing financial incentives to studios that produce two or more projects and spend at least $100 million in the state.\nVornado owns a 49.9 percent stake in the studio, while Hudson Pacific has a 25.6 percent stake and Blackstone owns the rest.\nNew York has long been a\ndominant player\nin the country\u2019s studio space sector, despite the impenetrability of Manhattan due to high development costs and a lack of available space.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

At a time when many owners of newer office buildings are sitting tight, the offering stands out as one of the few recently completed, high-quality buildings in Chicago to hit the market.\nThe project is listed unpriced.\nThe 197,433-square-foot building is about 94 percent leased with a weighted average lease term of nearly 11 years, according to the JLL brochure. Supply-chain management firm Havi is the anchor tenant, leasing roughly 96,400 square feet.\nHavi\nis a major vendor to McDonald\u2019s, whose\nglobal headquarters\nsits a few blocks away and helped cement Fulton Market\u2019s status as the city\u2019s hottest office submarket.\nSterling Bay launched the project in 2021 with a construction loan just shy of $70 million from Bank OZK. Cook County property records show the loan has been amended several times, most recently last year, pushing its maturity to August. While the pending maturity might add some urgency, no obvious signs of distress exist, making the deal a cleaner test of investor appetite than many recent office trades.\nThe sale comes on the heels of Colorado-based Real Capital Solutions\u2019 $132.5 million purchase of the office tower at\n401 North Michigan Avenue\n, the city\u2019s priciest office deal since 2022, according to the publication.\nPeople familiar with the Morgan Street building said its recent completion in 2022, Fulton Market location and relatively modest deal size could draw a broader buyer pool and stronger pricing than Chicago office sales have seen in years. JLL brokers Jaime Fink, Bruce Miller, Sam DiFrancesca and John Mason are handling the offering.\nThe listing also might provide a clue to Sterling Bay\u2019s shifting strategy. Once the dominant force for Fulton Market\u2019s transformation from meatpacking district to corporate hub \u2014 including McDonald\u2019s headquarters and Google\u2019s Midwest outpost \u2014 the developer has been shedding properties after its Lincoln Yards megaproject stalled.

        "content": "Hundreds of apartments, a sprawling pickleball club and a growing lineup of entertainment tenants are taking shape in north Fort Worth, where developer Steve McKeever says his long-gestating North City project is finally hitting its stride.\nThe mixed-use development will span roughly 148 acres within a larger assemblage McKeever controls and is positioned in a triangle below North Tarrant Parkway, west of I-35W and northeast of US 287. The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat McKeever\u2019s plan is an \u201curban village\u201d that blends apartments, entertainment and retail in an area McKeever argues is long on rooftops and jobs but short on destination experiences.\nMcKeever owns more than 300 acres, split between tracts north and south of U.S. 287. Once fully built out, he estimates total development value will exceed $1.1 billion. His focus, he said, is turning the northern portion into a pedestrian-friendly entertainment hub \u2014 something he believes north\nFort Worth\nlacks, despite its proximity to\nAllianceTexas\n.\nThat nearby master-planned development, spanning 27,000 acres, has generated more than 66,000 jobs and an estimated $130 billion\neconomic impact\nsince 1990, according to the outlet.\nConstruction cranes are already in the air. Miami-based multifamily firm Resia is building a 465-unit apartment complex on 8 acres, while Carrollton-based Cross Developer, in a joint venture with McKeever, is underway on a 233-unit project nearby. The partners plan to break ground this summer on another 354-unit development, with a third apartment phase planned roughly two years later.\nOn the experiential side, McKeever is opening a 16-court pickleball facility dubbed City Pickle USA on Jan. 31. The club is designed as more than a sports stop, featuring a full gym, wellness offerings and a sports bar \u2014 a kind of stay-all-day idea North City is chasing, according to McKeever.\nRetail is already anchoring the broader development. Major tenants include a 100,000-square-foot Andretti Indoor Karting and Games, furniture retailer Living Spaces and used-car vending machine operator Carvana. McKeever said density will be key to attracting the next wave of tenants, which could include a grocery store, a concert or music venue and potentially a\nhotel\n.\nThe project has gone through multiple iterations, including a period when Ikea explored the site before backing away. McKeever also said he lost 14 deals during the pandemic. Operating largely solo, McKeever said patience is part of the strategy.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The suburban Chicago office market closed 2025 in a deeper hole than ever, as vacancy climbed to a fresh record and reinforced fears that the post-pandemic hangover for landlords \u2014 and local tax bases \u2014 is far from over.\nOffice vacancy across the suburbs ended the year at 32.9 percent, up from 32.4 percent in the\nthird quarter\nand 32 percent at the end of\n2024\n, according to new data from JLL first\nreported\nby Crain\u2019s. Vacancies set an all-time high every quarter for five straight years, a stunning reversal from early 2020, when vacancy stood at 22.1 percent.\nThe numbers highlight a widening mismatch between supply and demand in a market built around sprawling corporate campuses that no longer align with how companies use space. Remote and hybrid work have permanently shrunk tenant demand, while much of the suburban inventory consists of aging buildings that companies see as functionally obsolete.\nLandlords and lenders are taking hits as values fall, while municipalities that once relied on office parks as\ndependable revenue engines\nare facing growing uncertainty, according to the outlet.\n\u201cThere is a lot of suburban office space that doesn\u2019t need to be office space in the future, and it\u2019s not going to get absorbed,\u201d JLL Vice Chairman Dan McCarthy said. For vacancy to meaningfully retreat, he said, demand must improve and supply must shrink \u2014 neither of which moved much at the end of last year.\nTenants gave back roughly 371,000 more square feet than they occupied during the fourth quarter, pushing total negative net absorption for 2025 past 720,000 square feet, according to JLL. Verizon trimmed its space in Rolling Meadows by about 20 percent as part of a lease extension, while Aldi exercised an option to terminate a 113,000-square-foot office lease in Naperville.\nSince the start of 2020, suburban tenants have shed about 5.3 million square feet. By comparison, the suburbs lost roughly 3.2 million square feet during the Great Financial Crisis from 2008 to 2013, according to the report.\nLeasing volume\nalso appears to have reset lower. Companies signed about 4 million square feet of suburban leases in 2025, down 14 percent from the prior year and well below the roughly 7 million square feet inked at the market\u2019s 2018 peak.\nStabilization now hinges on how quickly obsolete offices are removed. Nearly 6 million square feet have been taken offline over the past five years, pushing total suburban inventory below 95 million square feet for the first time since 2007. Another 2.2 million square feet is slated for demolition or redevelopment, including office-to-industrial and sports-related conversions.\nEven so, distress is mounting. In October, the owner of the 1.1 million-square-foot\nWestbrook Corporate Center\nin Westchester was hit with a foreclosure lawsuit tied to a $99 million mortgage.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The price amounts to nearly $941,000 per unit.\nThe latest acquisition followed two rounds of purchases in 2024 and 2025, when the same entity bought 18 units in the building, records and Vizzda show.\nRelated Ross\nnow owns 45 of Southbridge\u2019s 63 condos, giving it a dominant position in the 1981-built complex that sits on a 1.3-acre site along the Intracoastal Waterway, just across the bridge to Palm Beach and Mar-a-Lago, President Donald Trump\u2019s home and private club.\nRelated Ross has paid a total of\u00a0 $37.3 million, or roughly $829,000 per unit.\nThat price was a major score for the individual condo sellers in the most recent sale. The Palm Beach County Property Appraiser pegged the appraised value for most of the 27 condos at below $250,000 each.\nRelated Ross\u2019 ownership position suggests a likely redevelopment play.\nThe buyout push comes amid industry-wide turbulence in Florida\u2019s condo market. Tougher maintenance and reserve funding laws passed in the wake of the 2021 Surfside collapse have triggered costly special assessments for owners of aging buildings, prompting many to sell to developers seeking prime sites.\nWest Palm Beach\nhas become one of South Florida\u2019s hottest redevelopment corridors, with Related Ross leading the charge through a series of office, luxury residential and mixed-use projects along the waterfront.\nThis month, Wells Fargo announced it is moving its wealth management headquarters to a 50,000-square-foot lease in Related Ross\u2019\nOne Flagler\n, a 25-story office building the firm completed last year.\nRelated Ross scored a\n$772 million\nconstruction financing package last month for two planned West Palm Beach office towers: the 23-story 10 CityPlace and the 26-story 15 CityPlace.",

        "content": "A Los Angeles landlord is under fire for much more than typical maintenance neglect.\nNela Petrusan, landlord of the 43-unit 1430 Wright Street building in downtown Los Angeles, is\naccused\nof physically assaulting tenants in addition to ignoring problems like broken plumbing and a roach infestation, the Los Angeles Times reported.\nOf the more than 23,000 complaints against all landlords in the city, Petrusan is the only one to ever be charged under\nLos Angeles\u2019 Tenant Anti-Harassment Ordinance\n, passed in 2021 and\nreinforced in 2024\nto protect tenants from abusive landlords. Since 2022, when Petrusan took over as landlord duties from her late father, four tenants have filed civil suits against the landlord and nine have filed for restraining orders, claiming they experienced a pattern of threatening behavior through physical and verbal assaults.\nPetrusan denied any wrongdoing. \u201cWe don\u2019t harass [tenants],\u201d she told the Times. \u201cWe say \u2018hi.\u2019\u201d\nOne tenant, Olga Moreira, claims Petrusan sprayed another tenant with bear mace in 2022 and that the toxic spray got into her eyes, requiring medical attention. Moreira claimed Petrusan\u2019s boyfriend, Jeremy Noor, threatened her with a rifle, according to an application for a restraining order. Moreira also claimed that Noor set fire to her Jeep Cherokee, which Petrusan denied.\n\u201cIf we lit her car on fire, then I would have to do that to the other 20 people in here that don\u2019t pay me. Like with my kids. I can\u2019t give one something if I don\u2019t give the other something,\u201d Petrusan said.\nAnother plaintiff, Adriana Montes de Oca Cervantes, alleges her wrist was fractured when she was attacked by Petrusan\u2019s pit bull in April 2024. That case is still pending. Petrusan denied her dog ever bit Cervantes; the tenant provided medical records to the Times showing she visited California Hospital Medical Center in April 2024 and was diagnosed with an open fracture of her right wrist from a dog bite.\nOther tenants claim in court documents that Petrusan threatened to call\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement\non them, which Petrusan also denies. \u201cI didn\u2019t threaten to call immigration. If I called immigration, all my tenants would leave,\u201d Petrusan, an immigrant from Romania, told the Times.\nAdditional cases against Petrusan allege the landlord failed to maintain sanitary conditions or safe doors and didn\u2019t fix broken plumbing, among other issues. The cases are still open, and Petrusan has reportedly stopped showing up to court appearances, David Albright, a\nLos Angeles Tenants Union\norganizer who works with residents at the building, told the Times. A warrant for Petrusan\u2019s arrest was issued on Nov. 12 after she did not appear for a court date, per records reviewed by the Times.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Lisle officials hit pause on a proposed data center after opposition from residents spilled out of Village Hall, adding another setback to data center development across suburban Chicago.\nThe village\u2019s planning and zoning commission postponed a scheduled public hearing Wednesday night after more than 300 residents packed the building, exceeding capacity limits for the board chambers and an overflow room, Mayor Mary Jo Mullen said. The Daily Herald\nreported\nthat the hearing was set to address a proposal by the developer Cloud Centers to build a 256,000-square-foot, 50-megawatt data center on the long-vacant former Lockformer property at 711 Ogden Avenue.\nThe 18-acre site has been dormant for more than two decades and carries complications, according to the publication. Lockformer\u2019s former manufacturing operations contaminated local drinking water with toxic chemicals, a legacy that still looms large for residents. Mullen called the episode \u201ca really difficult time for Lisle,\u201d adding that the history makes redevelopment of the site especially sensitive.\nCloud Centers\u2019 proposal calls for a large-scale facility that would tap nearby power infrastructure. Project documents note that the ComEd-owned Lisle substation sits within roughly 500 feet of the property, making it one of the few\nsuburban sites\ncapable of supporting a 50-megawatt load \u2014 a key selling point as data center developers scour the region for power-ready land.\nBut proximity cuts both ways. Residents argued the project is too close to homes, pointing to a subdivision across Ogden Avenue and a residential street less than 300 feet from the site. Concerns include diesel backup generators, constant mechanical noise and emissions from cooling systems.\n\u201cI\u2019m not anti-data center, but being less than 300 feet away from homes seems dangerous,\u201d said Lisle resident Vanessa Berry, who has helped organize neighborhood opposition. What started as a lightly attended meeting in December has quickly snowballed. The outlet reported that about 40 residents showed up to a gathering Berry organized last week, and the village said it has received nearly 250 emails about the proposal, most opposing it.\nThe postponement came a day after Naperville\u2019s City Council\nvoted down\nits own proposed\ndata center\n, citing similar fears about power strain, noise and diesel emissions in residential areas. That vote appears to have energized opponents in\nLisle\nand heightened pressure on local officials.\nVillage Manager Jeffrey Cook said the hearing must be rescheduled with at least 15 days\u2019 public notice and that the proposal will not be discussed again until then. A representative for Cloud Centers could not be reached for comment.\nWhile Mullen said it\u2019s too early to take a position, she suggested municipalities may need clearer regional or statewide guidance as data center demand accelerates.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a Lisle issue,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to figure out how to do this safely and reasonably without harming residents.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The City of San Francisco is staring down a growing budget deficit as the result of falling property values.\nFor the next two fiscal years, San Francisco\nfaces\na $936 million budget deficit driven by anemic property tax revenues, the San Francisco Business Times reported. Property tax is predicted to rise nearly 2.4 percent this fiscal year before falling almost 2.8 percent in fiscal year 2027.\nPresidio Bay Ventures\u2019 purchase of\n60 Spear Street\nin August 2023 serves as an example of what the city is dealing with. Presidio Bay\nbought the 160,000-square-foot downtown office building\nfor $40.9 million\u00a0\u2014 a sharp drop from the approximately $107 million that seller\nClarion Partners\npaid for almost a decade earlier. With the building\u2019s assessed value tumbling more than 60 percent, the city lost tens of millions of dollars in taxable value. City officials had pegged 60 Spear at a $121.8 million valuation in fiscal year 2023. By fiscal year 2025, the assessment dropped to $41.8 million. As a result, Presidio Bay\u2019s annual property tax bill fell to about $494,000, down about 65 percent from the more than $1.4 million Clarion paid in its final year of ownership.\nOffice properties account for approximately 17 percent of San Francisco\u2019s\nproperty tax\nbase. Under California\u2019s Proposition 13, assessed values can only rise 2 percent annually unless a building changes hands. When properties sell below their assessed value, the reset locks in a lower tax base that may take decades to recover from.\nOther downtown office buildings are selling below their peak-era valuations and prior tax assessments, trading at $200 to $400 per square foot. City officials say general fund property tax revenue fell almost 0.9 percent in the fiscal year ending June 2025 and has grown less than 2 percent in three of the past five years, according to the Business Times. In the past, property tax reliably climbed at or above the 2-percent Prop 13 cap.\nA surge of assessment appeals has only made the growing problem worse. The\nSan Francisco Office of the Assessor-Recorder, which handles the appeals, is working through a backlog of thousands of requests. Before the pandemic, the office would typically receive around 1,400 appeals per year, San Francisco Assessor-Recorder Joaquin Torres told the Business\nTimes. In\nfiscal year 2024, it received 8,000 appeals; the number increased to 9,000 in 2025, which Torres said is an \u201cat least 25-year high.\u201d\nMayor Daniel Lurie, for the time being, is planning to work with building and community stakeholders, as well as the Board of Supervisors, to deliver a budget that \u201cprioritizes core services\u201d including clean and safe streets.\n\u201cWe are not simply going to do everything we were doing a little less well,\u201d Lurie told the Business Times. \u201cTogether as a city, we are going to decide what we want to prioritize and deliver world-class services.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A new $160 million student housing complex is rising near Texas A&amp;M University, an example of how developers are still pushing upscale housing near major campuses, even as enrollment growth begins to level off.\nSt. Louis-based Subtext broke ground on Verve College Station, a 21-story tower at 311 Stasney Street in College Station, about a block and a half from campus. The project will offer 1,193 beds across 392 units, along with more than 37,000 square feet of amenities, positioning it among the largest and most amenity heavy student housing projects in the College Station market, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe building was\nregistered\nin May with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation with an estimated $160 million price tag, though that cost is subject to change. The building will total about 825,000 square feet according to the filing.\nThe development fits squarely into the wave of \u201celevated\u201d student housing\ntransforming\nthe area around Northgate. It joins\nprojects\nlike the $86 million Rev Northgate and Aspire A&amp;M, a 19-story, 873-unit building under construction nearby, as developers chase higher rents from students willing to pay for proximity and luxury.\nVerve will offer floor plans ranging from studios to five-bedroom apartments, with finishes more typical of luxury\nmultifamily\nprojects than traditional student housing. Units are slated to include hardwood-style flooring, quartz countertops, designer lighting and tile, stainless steel appliances and 65-inch wall-mounted TVs, according to the publication. The project also includes 930 parking spaces, a notable amenity in a\ndense campus adjacent\nlocation.\nPlans call for roughly 21,000 square feet of indoor amenity space, including a fitness center, yoga studio, sauna and meditation rooms, game lounge and an indoor-outdoor bar and kitchen. The project will also have a lobby coffee shop and mini-market.\nHoar Construction\u2019s Houston office is serving as general contractor. ESG Architecture &amp; Design of Minneapolis is the architect, with Houston-based Quiddity handling civil engineering. Power Design and Kilgore Multifamily are leading mechanical, electrical and plumbing work, with SK&amp;A Structural Engineers on the structural design.\nThe project is expected to open in summer 2028. Verve will join Subtext\u2019s Ever College Station, a seven-story student housing project at 401 Stasney Street now under construction and slated for completion in 2027.\nTexas A&amp;M hit a record enrollment of 72,289 students in fall of last year, up nearly 20 percent since 2016, according to the outlet. But after years of rapid growth, the university has said it will pause undergraduate enrollment expansion for several years, giving infrastructure and staffing time to catch up \u2014 even as developers continue to bet on high-end beds close to campus.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

An LLC tied to Greek businessman and Libra Group founder\nGeorge Logothetis\npaid $28 million for a 5,400-square-foot pad with six bedrooms, five full bathrooms and two half bathrooms. The deal works out to about $5,300 per square foot.\nLogothetis recently sold the former Rockefeller townhouse\nat 13 East 94th Street \u2014 which appears on a mortgage related to the most recent purchase \u2014 for $15.5 million.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe top commercial real estate transaction was with SL Green Realty Corp., whose acquisition of the Park Avenue Tower at\n65 East 55th Street\nin the Plaza District for $730 million hit records. The seller was Blackstone, which had bought the building in 2014 for $750 million. The Class-A office property stands 36 stories tall and measures nearly 622,000 square feet. SL Green financed the deal with a new $480 million CMBS loan.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nIn the West Village, a condo at\n150 Charles Street\nchanged hands for $16.3 million.

        "content": "In November, New York City agent Mike Fabbri was fed up with an expensive, deal-stalling problem.\nOver the past 18 months, six of his pending transactions had been held up thanks to open permits for past renovation work filed with the Department of Buildings.\nHome renovations typically require permits \u2014 and once the work is done, those permits must be formally closed out. But when that step gets missed, the open permit can resurface late in the sales process, often in a title report, and bring a deal to a standstill as neither side wants to absorb the liability. Closing the permit could mean hiring architects, electricians and inspectors and filing fresh paperwork with the DOB, which can cost thousands of dollars.\nFabbri had run into this issue this many times that he\u2019d decided to add an agent who specializes in closing these permits to his team.\n\u201cOne deal I did this summer, we had to agree to put a certain amount in escrow for them to close,\u201d Fabbri said. \u201cThe permit is still not closed out, so money is just sitting there.\u201d\nFabbri wasn\u2019t sure why this had become more common in the last year, but he had a few theories, namely that Covid-era slowdowns and construction halts had disrupted the process. Some sellers may have filed permits for work that ultimately didn\u2019t get done due to a law passed in the spring of 2020\nbanning non-essential construction\n.\nBut that explanation didn\u2019t account for every situation he\u2019d encountered. Some of the permits dated back to previous owners, not the sellers he was representing.\nIssues with open permits have \u201cdefinitely picked up, but they\u2019ve always been out there,\u201d said Shaun Pappas, a real estate attorney with Starr Associates. \u201cAs a sellers\u2019 lawyer, I usually push back on it, and [the hurdle] goes away. But buyers have been more adamant about it recently.\u201d\nThere are no easy solutions to dealing with open permits, Pappas said, especially because they often require convincing plumbers, electricians or other professionals to sign off on work they didn\u2019t complete themselves. But \u201cit\u2019s rare that this becomes an issue that we can\u2019t work around.\u201d\nHe added that for buyers and sellers, it usually means one side has to absorb a risk, one that lenders and title companies also have to adjust to.\n\u201cOne of my clients bought a house and didn\u2019t realize the electrical work permit wasn\u2019t closed and had to open up a wall to fix an electrical socket,\u201d said Compass\u2019 Tali Berzak, who added that the process cost the buyer about $25,000\nBerzak said that one reason the problem might be coming up more often is because lenders are more scrupulous in their evaluations of prospective borrowers.\nAdam Maiser, who Fabbri added to his team, pointed to the DOB\u2019s\ntransition to its new records platform\n, DOB Now, a process that began in 2016 and has since mostly concluded.\nPermit records have been publicly available online since the early 2000s, first through the DOB\u2019s legacy system and later through DOB Now. But the transition wasn\u2019t immediate: permits were migrated in batches, leaving gaps where some records didn\u2019t immediately appear in the new system. As a result, title companies may have checked one database but not the other, missing open permits during an earlier sale, only for them to surface years later when the property was back on the market.\nThere doesn\u2019t appear to be a short answer for why some agents might be running into open permits more often, and it\u2019s likely a combination of Covid-era disruptions, tougher lender scrutiny and long-buried paperwork.\nHave you seen this hold up deals?

        "content": "The Real Estate Board of New York\u2019s annual gala felt like 2016 again.\nIndustry leaders and politicos gathered at the Waldorf Astoria New York on Thursday for the trade group\u2019s annual event, which this year harkened back to a bygone era of real estate hobnobbing.\nDubbed the Liar\u2019s Ball, the 130th edition of the gala carried a nostalgic flair reminiscent of its pre-Covid iterations, resembling what one\nThe Real Deal\nreporter described as an \u201cexpensive prom.\u201d (Compass agent Jason Haber actually did have his high school prom in the same room, according to a post on his Instagram account.)\nThe palatial ballroom, chandelier-adorned rooms and a packed cocktail hour recalled a grander time, before the event took on a more casual air during its years at the Glasshouse.\nThough the gala appeared more formal than in recent years, it wasn\u2019t a total return to the decorum of circa 2016, when the dress code was black-tie. (This year, it was black-tie optional, though most guests wore cocktail attire.)\nAlso unlike 2016, the Mayor of New York City was not in attendance. That wasn\u2019t a surprise, considering newly-inaugurated Zohran Mamdani spent last year\u2019s gala\nprotesting with tenant groups\noutside the venue.\nHowever, in his stead, the mayor sent his housing czar, Leila Bozorg, and Department of Buildings Commissioner Ahmed Tigani, signaling his administration might be more open to working with the industry despite some\ncontroversial moves\nduring Mamdani\u2019s first week in office, including instituting \u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings.\nCourtesy of Johnny Wolf Studio and Jill Lotenberg for REBNYtook the stage following REBNY President Jim Whelan. Other political bigwigs in attendance included City Council Speaker Julie Menin, New York State Attorney General Letitia James and City Comptroller Mark Levine.\nFrom the industry side, REBNY chairman and Two Trees Management principal Jed Walentas was at the event, along with the Soloviev Group\u2019s Michael Hershman and eponymous brokerage founder Ryan Serhant.\nWhile the event was certainly different from its last showing, one thing remained the same \u2014 by the time the clock hit double digits, gala goers had already cleared out.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nEarlier this week, President Donald Trump signed an executive order limiting institutional investors\u2019 purchases of single-family homes. But in New York, investors are already spending less money, and those who are purchasing are paying\nmore than the median home price\n. Will restrictions on investors make a dent in New York\u2019s market? Send thoughts to\nsheridan.wall@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nThe biggest snowstorm in New York City history \u2014 or at least, the largest since the mid-1800s \u2014 was in January 2016, according to data from the\nNational Weather Service\n. Roughly 28 inches of snow fell in Central Park over a three-day period, surpassing a snowstorm 10 years prior, which yielded just under 27 inches of snow.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014\nGov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency across all of New York state ahead of a snowstorm expected to sweep across the East Coast this weekend, according to\nCBS New York.\nThe storm is projected to bring 6 to 12 inches of snow to New York City and its suburbs between Sunday and Monday.\n\u2014 New York City nurses agreed to return to negotiations with area hospitals on Thursday, following appeals from Hochul and Mamdani, the\nNew York Times\nreported. Roughly 15,000 health care workers, represented by nurses unions, have been on strike since Jan. 12, over concerns about safety, understaffing and compensation.\n\u2014 Nine alleged gang leaders were indicted in Suffolk County, Long Island on Thursday, with the charges ranging from shootings to illegally owned weapons to sex trafficking, according to\nNewsday\n. Authorities claimed the leaders were part of the Lowndes Block gang, a subset of the Bloods, which controls a territory near Huntington Station.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$28 million\nfor 20 East 76th Street, 12AC. The Lenox Hill condo is a new construction unit totaling 5,400 square feet.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s\nMichelle Griffith and Lauren Muss have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$42.8 million\nfor 113 Spring Street. Morgan Stanley sold the 20,500-square-foot, mixed-use office building to Blackstone in an all-cash deal,\nper reports\n.\nNew to the Market\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $9.5 million for 150 Central Park South, Unit 2504. The Central Park South co-op is 2,700 square feet.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s\nMatthew Gulker and Sabrina Saltiel have the listing.\nBreaking Ground\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 81,567-square-foot, 15-story, mixed-use building at 246 7th Street in Red Hook. Thomas Scibilia of NA Design Studio is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann\n",

        "content": "A state Supreme Court judge on Friday dismissed bribery and other charges against Marcal Group\u2019s Mark Caller, throwing out one of five indictments accusing former Department of Buildings\u2019 Commissioner Eric Ulrich of using position in exchange for various perks.\nJudge Daniel Conviser granted a motion to dismiss the indictment against\nCaller\nand Ulrich, but declined to dismiss the remaining four cases against Ulrich and other defendants.\nThe\n2023 indictment\naccused Caller of selling Ulrich a discounted apartment at his company\u2019s\u00a0 133 Beach 116th Street, in exchange for help on a zoning change Marcal Group needed and expediting inspections at one of his buildings.\nThe judge cites three key reasons for dismissing the Caller case.\nOne is that the grand jury wasn\u2019t presented with an \u201caccurate picture\u201d of Ulrich and Caller\u2019s relationship, the decision states. Ulrich provided lawful assistance to Caller for a number of years, starting when Ulrich was a City Council member. If the grand jury knew this, the decision argues, it would have had to \u201cdraw the implausible conclusion that, after getting benefits from Ulrich for multiple years, Caller then decided to bribe Ulrich to get the same benefits.\u201d\nSecondly, the decision argues that it isn\u2019t clear that Ulrich received a better deal on the apartment than what Caller offered others. And finally, the indictment alleged that bribery took place between December 17, 2021, and March 18, 2022, even though conversations between Caller and Ulrich about the apartment didn\u2019t begin until March 19, 2022, the decision states.\nThe reasons echo arguments made by Caller\u2019s attorney Ben Brafman, who filed a motion to dismiss the indictment\nlast year\n. At the time, Brafman argued that Ulrich had \u201cbeen legally helping Caller for years on his projects without any benefit, payment or remuneration.\u201d\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office said prosecutors \u201crespect\u201d the decision and \u201cwill proceed with the four remaining indictments.\u201d\nUlrich was hit with five\nindictments\nin 2023, accusing him of accepting more than $150,000 in bribes, which took the form of a painting by an apprentice of Salvador Dal\u00ed, Mets season tickets, a custom suit and cash for gambling.\u00a0The remaining cases include bribery, conspiracy and offering a false instrument charges.\nMayor Eric Adams tapped Ulrich, formerly one of the few Republican City Council members, as his DOB commissioner in May 2022.

        "content": "Beauty founder Frank Toskan sold two adjacent waterfront homes in Miami Beach for a combined $31.9 million.\nRecords show Toskan sold the houses at 1833 and 1839 West 24th Street to 3339 Sunset LLC, a Florida entity registered to the Eighteen Sunset building at 1759 Purdy Avenue in Miami Beach, where\nAres Management\nhas opened an office.\nAnnie De La Rosa with Douglas Elliman had the listing.\nToskan co-founded the beauty brand Mac Cosmetics with Frank Angelo in 1984, and the two are largely credited with revolutionizing the industry and pioneering brightly pigmented cosmetics. Est\u00e9e Lauder acquired the company in the 1990s.\nToskan bought the two homes on Sunset Island III for $20.3 million in a pair of deals in 2021, according to property records. They span 0.6 acres combined.\nThe assemblage includes one 6,700-square-foot home with three bedrooms and five bathrooms that sold for $14.3 million, and one 4,200-square-foot home with five bedrooms and five bathrooms that sold for $17.7 million, property records show. The houses also each have a pool and a dock.\nThey were on the market for a combined $36.6 million, Zillow shows.\nThe deal marks the latest sale in Miami Beach\u2019s Sunset Islands. Earlier this month, restaurateur Barton G. Weiss, also known as Barton G., sold his waterfront mansion for\n$29.3 million\n. Architect Chad Oppenheim\u2019s mansion asking\n$27 million\nwent pending in November. In October, investor Edmond Harbour bought his neighbor\u2019s teardown for\n$34 million\n. It brought his total spend on the islands to $60.5 million.\nSouth Florida\u2019s ultra-luxury market is driven by a handful of cash\u2011funded transactions.\nMiami-Dade single-family home sales above $30 million rose 58 percent last year, and condo sales above $20 million increased 37.5 percent. That represents a sliver of the greater market, with 19 single-family home sales and 11 condo sales in that price point.",

Its tenants include\nRetro Fitness\n, Keke\u2019s Breakfast Caf\u00e9, CJ\u2019s Sports Bar &amp; Grill and Good Vets.\nCompleted in 1981, the center spans 70,400 square feet on a 6.3-acre site, according to property records.\nPebb, led by Ian Weiner, bought the shopping center in 2003, then called Delray Commons, and sold it in 2015, the release says. After Topvalco bought it in 2018, Pebb partnered with the firm on Delray Landing in 2021, paying $10.5 million for its stake.\nPebb and Topvalco\u2019s renovations of the retail center included a new fa\u00e7ade and roof, and revamps of the parking, lighting, signage and landscaping.\nPebb, a family-owned firm, is partnering with the Toledano family\u2019s Aventura-based BH Group on\nThe Eclipse\nproject, the redevelopment of the site at 6600 North Military Trail in Boca Raton, formerly known as Office Depot\u2019s headquarters. Pebb and BH are renovating two of the office buildings and, in partnership with the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group, are replacing the third office building with a 500-unit apartment project.\nIn other projects, Pebb is partnering with BH and Related on a planned\n33-story\nLive Local Act tower with 521 units along Fort Lauderdale\u2019s waterfront.\nRosner has joined the grocery-anchored retail investment spree playing out in South Florida. In November, two entities tied to Rosner and Carlyle Management partnered with another buyer on the\n$60.5 million\npurchase of a Coral Springs shopping center anchored by Aldi, Hobby Lobby and Petco.\nIn September, San Francisco-based Stockbridge Capital Group dropped\n$118.4 million\nfor the Whole Foods Market-anchored shopping center within the Uptown Boca mixed-use development.\u00a0In Plantation, Core Investment Properties Fund and Miami Beach-based investor James Resnick bought the Publix-anchored Jacaranda Plaza for\n$53 million\n.

The Wells Fargo-originated debt is slated to mature in June.\nBlackstone\nacquired its stake\nin the 225,000-square-foot structure, known as Pinnacle II, in 2017 as part of a six-property deal in Burbank\u2019s Media District for $1.7 billion. The individual price of the property is not known.\nWhile other buildings in the portfolio housed entertainment companies like DreamWorks, the Walt Disney Company and Sony, Pinnacle II has had a rough past few years. Warner Brothers was the only occupant in the building until 2022 when it vacated the site ahead of its lease expiration late that year. Since then, the building has largely been gathering dust, and its net cash flow has been negative since 2023, per Morningstar data cited by CO.\nA new undisclosed tenant is planning to move into Pinnacle II this summer, though the deal is only for approximately 25 percent of the building\u2019s available space.\nSoundstage and creative office owners\nin Greater Los Angeles have been hurting since the 2023 actor and writer strikes that ground film and TV production to a halt. At the same time, productions have fled Los Angeles for cheaper filming locations, though state officials are hopeful for a comeback after beefing up its Film &amp; Television Tax Credit Program incentives to $750 million last year. Earlier this month, Hackman Capital Partners defaulted on $1.1 billion in debt tied to\nRadford Studio Center\n, one of the city\u2019s oldest lots, located a few miles west of Pinnacle II in Studio City. Hackman is expected to\nreturn the 1.2-million-square-foot lot\nto lender Goldman Sachs.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Homeowners on Winnetka\u2019s wealthiest stretch of lakefront properties have had mixed results getting approval for construction after the village tightened development regulations along the bluffs of Lake Michigan.\nDocuments obtained by\nThe Real Deal\nshed more light on the contentious divide between lakefront homeowners and city officials that has spurred a lawsuit seeking to overturn the new rules.\nOf at least 11 permit applications made to the village of Winnetka since February 2024 for work along the so-called steep slope zone, four have been approved. Two homeowners withdrew their applications, and five are still in the review process, in one case more than a year after it was submitted. The village granted one exception to the rules for a new house, but the construction plans have since changed.\nThe village passed the regulations in early 2024 in an effort to protect the bluffs of Lake Michigan from damage and instability because of construction. The rules were largely seen as a reaction to billionaire Justin Ishbia\u2019s sprawling $77 million construction project, where he leveled the bluffs across multiple lakefront lots.\nEven as some plans have been approved, the process has been cumbersome even for minor work, said\nJena Radnay\n, a broker with @properties who sells lakefront homes in Winnetka and has clients who have worked with the bluff regulation.\n\u201cThey are torturing lakefront owners,\u201d Radnay said. \u201cThey are making it as hard as possible to do an improvement.\u201d\nPeter Friedman, Winnetka\u2019s village attorney, said the ordinance has clear requirements, it\u2019s been working well and construction has been continuing under the new law.\n\u201cVillage staff is committed to working with property owners to ensure a smooth and fair process,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cThe village is always open to resident suggestions about how, if necessary, to make the process even more responsive.\u201d\nAfter a court dismissed their initial complaint in October, a group of homeowners\nfiled a new lawsuit\nclaiming the rules were designed to block any construction on the bluffs. The village countered by pointing to exceptions it has granted as proof that the rules are flexible, and arguing plaintiffs can\u2019t claim damages without first exhausting their options.\n\u201cIn order to determine what\u2019s allowed and what\u2019s not allowed, property owners have the opportunity to apply for relief, such as variations and exceptions,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cThe Village Board deliberately included those in the ordinance to provide some flexibility.\u201d\nBut Radnay said the cost involved in applying for permits and seeking exceptions makes it too burdensome for homeowners to attempt. Applicants need to pay architects and engineers to prepare plans before paying application fees, which can reach six figures for major projects.\n\u201cYou could be investing $300,000, $400,000 on a whim, knowing that the chances of getting approved are slim to none,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculously oppressive in terms of why sellers would even want to spend their money.\u201d\nHomeowners and contractors who had submitted plans for bluff construction didn\u2019t return requests for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nHere\u2019s more about the applications that have worked and those that haven\u2019t.\nMixed Results for Plaintiffs\nMichael Rauchman, the owner of 645 Sheridan Road, is the only person who applied for a permit in the restricted area that\u2019s still a party to the lawsuit.\nHe applied to build a new residence for $4 million in February 2024. Review comments from the village directed Rauchman to provide more information about plans to replace a gazebo and install a sewer pipe in the steep slope zone, but it was ultimately approved in October 2024 after four rounds of revisions, documents show.\nRauchman remains a plaintiff in the lawsuit, and the homeowners\u2019 complaint claims his property lost 6,300 square feet of developable land, leading to a $3 million value reduction.\nMandy Day, formerly the owner of 381 Sheridan, applied for repairs to a retaining wall. The lawsuit alleges the village requested more information for the application several times, and rejected her proposal because a proposed walkway repair added a third of an inch to the existing structure.\nDocuments provided by the village show Day applied for a permit for a retaining wall and indicate the application was withdrawn by the homeowner. In its reply to the homeowners\u2019 lawsuit, the village said the denial of Day\u2019s permit was because it didn\u2019t comply with the village code and she did not try to appeal the decisions.\nThe village used Day\u2019s sale to attack the core premise of the homeowners\u2019 lawsuit, that the regulations have destroyed property values. The filing notes that Day purchased the home for $7 million in 2022 and sold it for\n$9.6 million in May 2025\n, a profit of over 36 percent achieved after the regulations were in effect.\nThe other former plaintiff who applied for work in the steep slope zone,\nVijay Kotte\n, got approval to build a $10 million house on his property in 2025, and later withdrew as a plaintiff.\nProjects face long reviews\nWhether or not they were approved, projects in the regulated area have undergone months of review over multiple rounds of application, the documents show.\nAt 1215 Whitebridge Hill Road, owner Yong Park has been working for more than a year to get approval for an extensive engineering overhaul of the property\u2019s fragile cliffside, expected to cost $1 million. The plans include a mechanical tram to transport residents down the bluff, a new boat house, retaining walls, and a private pier extending into Lake Michigan.\nIn review comments, city officials regularly flagged design issues that conflicted with the bluff protection ordinance. The city rejected a proposed design for a retaining wall that had a flat top, on the grounds that it effectively extended the home\u2019s backyard, a violation of the ordinance.\nThe city also blocked a plan to replace a stone terrace on the property with a new terrace, noting that it extended four feet beyond the original footprint.\nFriedman said the village is \u201ccommitted to working with property owners who have projects to review and respond expeditiously to permit requests and submittals.\u201d\nOther proposals received similar comments as homeowners sought approval to build along the lakefront bluffs. Frequently, applications were rejected for adding and backfilling walls that extended the table land of the properties into the bluff zone.\n\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be four meetings to discuss a new pool if it\u2019s in the exact same place,\u201d Radnay said. \u201cThat is a waste of time.\u201d\nVillage granted variation\nThe village granted one variation to the bluff rules but the homeowner scrapped the plan when the adjacent property came up for sale. The village board approved a measure in 2024 allowing the owner of 473 Sheridan Road to build a new home in the same spot as the existing home, about 30 feet from the lake, closer than the 50-foot setback required under the bluff protection ordinance.\nBut the owner, an LLC managed by Robert Delaney, later purchased the adjacent property at 499 Sheridan Road for $5.3 million. After getting approval to combine the two properties, which allowed for an existing deck and gazebo that were outside the required setback area to remain, the owner is no longer seeking an exception for the new house.\nStill, Radnay said that the initial exception was limited and would have constrained what the owner wanted to build.\n\u201cThat is why he had to buy the house in front, so then at that point he could actually build what he wanted,\u201d she said.\n",

        "content": "Texas farm supplier and philanthropist Chaz Neely is auctioning a Central Texas luxury estate \u2014 and hoping to get almost double the price he paid for it a few months ago.\nIn February, Sotheby\u2019s Concierge Auctions will start accepting bids for the home at 8536 Armstrong Road outside of Belton, a town on I-35 about halfway between Austin and Waco, according to a Concierge press release.\nThe 13-acre property includes a stretch of Salado Creek, which the 7,000-square-foot home overlooks. The two-story home has six bedrooms, seven bathrooms, seven fireplaces and an elevator. Designed in a French Provincial style, the home includes coffered ceilings and a shallow dome in copper above the foyer, according to the listing.\nBidding starts on Feb. 13 and ends on Feb. 28 with a live auction at The Biltmore Miami-Coral Gables in Florida. Concierge expects beds to start at about $2 million, according to marketing materials. The company hopes to drive bids up to $6 million, the asking price set by the seller with Kuper Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent Debbie Stevenson, who has the listing.\nThe previous sellers, H. Barton and Jean Jones, had listed the home for $3.8 million in March, according to Redfin. Once the Jones family hired Stevenson and decided to pursue an auction sale, Concierge opened bids at $2.1 million in June. Neely bought the property at auction in July for just under $3.2 million, according to public records. The final sale set a record for Bell County, Stevenson claimed.\nThe Jones family built the home in 2001, according to county records and Concierge Auctions.\nSince acquiring it last year, Neely has thoroughly updated the home, Stevenson said.\n\u201cWe submitted it for the ModaMiami, which is the premier East Coast global auction platform for Sotheby\u2019s \u2014 they do the really high-end cars at the same time \u2014 and the home was accepted,\u201d Stevenson said.\nRecent high-profile auctions in the state have ended with winning bids well below asking prices. A\nSouthlake mansion\nfetched a $14.2 million final bid last September after listing for $27.5 million, and a\ncastle in Fort Worth\nsold at auction for $6.7 million in December after asking $11.8 million on the market.\nNeely owns San Antonio Steel Company, the country\u2019s largest wholesale supplier of agricultural fencing. A prominent donor, he and his wife Patricia support the\nTexas Public Policy Foundation\n, a conservative think tank based in Austin, and endowed a faculty chair position at\nTexas A&amp;M University\n.\nThe Neelys\u2019 home at 11 Inverness Boulevard in San Antonio is also on the market, asking $7 million with Alison Neely Stone of Engel &amp; Volkers San Antonio.\n",

        "content": "Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts is expanding deeper into the gaming and resort business through a new branding deal with the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, bringing four Choctaw Casino &amp; Resorts properties into its global hotel portfolio.\nThe agreement folds Choctaw Casino &amp; Resort in Durant, Oklahoma \u2014 the tribe\u2019s flagship destination that is 90 miles north of Downtown Dallas\u00a0 \u2014 along with three other Oklahoma casino resorts in\nHochatown\n, Pocola and Grant into Wyndham\u2019s Trademark Collection, according to a company news release. The Choctaw Nation will retain full ownership and management of all four properties, using Wyndham primarily for its distribution and loyalty program rather than as an operator, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nCollectively, the four resorts total nearly 2,000 rooms and will roll out across\nWyndham\u2019s\nbooking channels in the coming weeks. According to the outlet they will also be accessible to members of Wyndham Business, the company\u2019s free-to-join travel program aimed at\ncorporate travelers\nand small businesses.\nThe agreement is part of Wyndham\u2019s strategy of growing through affiliations rather than ground-up development or acquisitions, according to the release. As the world\u2019s largest hotel franchising company by number of properties, Wyndham has increasingly leaned on its Trademark Collection to attract independent and regionally strong hotels looking for branding, marketing and loyalty reach without giving up control.\nWyndham President and CEO\nGeoff Ballotti\nsaid in a statement that the affiliation checks travelers\u2019 boxes in a number of ways, creating distinct experiences.\nThe Choctaw Nation framed the deal as a way to broaden its audience, while keeping its identity intact. Chief Gary Batton said the partnership elevates the guest experience by pairing Choctaw hospitality, culture and entertainment with Wyndham\u2019s global recognition and loyalty ecosystem.\nThe move also highlights the continued evolution of tribal gaming real estate, as casino operators increasingly look beyond gaming floors to destination-style resorts that compete for leisure travelers on a national scale.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "As per annual tradition, the biggest names in New York\u2019s real estate industry gathered on Thursday night to celebrate their own and talk business. Our\nprimer\ndives into the specifics that emerged from the event, but here are a few brief takeaways from the annual gala.\n1. Mamdani skipped, but his team showed up\nMayor Zohran Mamdani was the headliner who never arrived. REBNY invited the mayor to its annual gala at the Waldorf Astoria New York, but he declined, continuing a chilly relationship with the trade group he once picketed as an Assemblymember.\nStill, the absence wasn\u2019t total. Deputy Mayor for Housing and Planning Leila Bozorg and Buildings Commissioner Ahmed Tigani both attended, signaling that City Hall isn\u2019t boycotting the industry outright, even if the mayor himself isn\u2019t ready to clink glasses. REBNY President Jim Whelan framed their presence as a bridge, saying the group looked forward to hosting Mamdani in the future.\n2. Hochul leaned hard into her role as real estate\u2019s Albany ally\nGovernor Kathy Hochul once again took the stage, using the gala to reinforce her pitch as a pro-development partner.\nShe pledged to keep working with the industry to \u201cbreak down barriers\u201d to construction with environmental review reform front and center in her State of the State agenda. She further complained about red tape that sends projects \u201cthrough hell and back.\u201d\nWith a reelection campaign underway, the message was clear: Albany, at least for now, wants builders on its side.\n3. The gala doubled as a political temperature check\nThe guest list underscored the event\u2019s role as a barometer for real estate\u2019s standing at City Hall and beyond.\nElected officials spotted included Attorney General Letitia James, Comptroller Mark Levine, Council Speaker Julie Menin and a long roster of city and state lawmakers. Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, a Republican challenger to Hochul, also made the rounds.\nThe mix suggested the industry remains politically relevant, even as it navigates a more skeptical city administration.\n4. Symbolism mattered as much as speeches\nHeld at the landmarked Waldorf Astoria, fresh off a $2 billion condo conversion, the setting was a reminder of what the industry can pull off. But Mamdani\u2019s empty seat loomed large.\nThe Soloviev Group\u2019s Michael Hershman called it a \u201cmissed opportunity,\u201d reflecting a broader hope that dialogue, not distance, will shape the next chapter between New York\u2019s developers and its new mayor.\nHere are the other headlinesthat popped in New York City real estate news this week.\nGerman investor asking $400M for FiDi\u2019s 140 Broadway\nUnion Investment is selling 140 Broadway, a 1.2 million-square-foot office tower in the Financial District, for an asking price approaching $400 million.\nThe 51-story skyscraper is 73 percent leased. Brown Brothers Harriman is the anchor tenant, occupying roughly 190,000 square feet; Union Investment spent $160 million on building improvements over the last decade.\nCharles Cohen\u2019s 750 Lex auctioned off, returns to lender\nThe office tower at 750 Lexington Avenue went to auction but was returned to the lender after receiving no bids against a minimum price above $161 million.\nThe property\u2019s valuation plummeted from $300 million in 2015 to a recent appraisal of $41 million as financial troubles, including the exit or renegotiation of major tenants like Zara and WeWork, caused occupancy to drop, leading to foreclosure.\nLily Allen, David Harbour find buyer for Carroll Gardens townhouse after breakup\nFormer celebrity couple Lily Allen and David Harbour found a buyer for their brownstone at 381 Union Street in Carroll Gardens, which was listed after Allen released an album detailing the destruction of their relationship.\nThe townhouse\u2019s last asking price was $7.3 million, a drop from the initial nearly $8 million listing price in October. Allen and Harbour bought the late-19th-century brownstone, which includes five bedrooms, three bathrooms, a finished basement gym and a private backyard with a sauna and cold plunge, for $3.4 million in 2021.\nSummit\u2019s deal with Pinnacle, by the numbers\nLast week, Summit Properties won its battle to purchase a portfolio of thousands of New York apartments from Pinnacle Group. Pinnacle put the collection of mostly rent-stabilized units into bankruptcy and held an auction for a buyer. Mayor Zohran Mamdani and groups of tenants tried unsuccessfully to stop the sale.\nCourt documents and disclosures Summit made on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange detailed the numbers behind the deal.\nNew York developers are going small\nResi reporter Jake Indursky dug into the new development market in Manhattan, which is shifting from large-scale towers to smaller, \u201cboutique\u201d buildings (under 40 units), which accounted for 32 percent of units brought to market in the last three years. That\u2019s up from 14 percent previously.\nThe shift is driven by developers facing a lack of available land and risk-averse capital, making smaller projects more financially viable, quicker to sell out and less prone to the protracted carrying costs of high-unit developments.\nBuyers, meanwhile, are increasingly willing to spend top-tier prices on boutique projects, embracing perks like greater privacy and customization over the high-rise views and lavish amenities of larger buildings.\n",

        "content": "I have a proposition for the real estate industry and our fearless leaders. Here\u2019s the situation:\nMayor Zohran Mamdani is looking to spend more money, not less, but the city is projected to finish its fiscal year June 30 some\n$2.2 billion in the red\n. Next year\u2019s gap is $10.4 billion.\nIn Albany, revenue has been strong enough for Gov. Kathy Hochul to start funding a massive child care program without new taxes, but she needs more to ramp it up and pay for other priorities, such as housing.\nWhere will they find the cash?\nOne place could be gambling revenues that for decades have been used to prop up the dying sports of harness and thoroughbred racing.\nSuch a change would face resistance from at least two major real estate figures: SL Green\u2019s\nMarc Holliday\nand GFP Real Estate\u2019s\nJeff Gural\n.\nHolliday, a\nracehorse owner\n, has\nchaired\nthe New York Racing Association\u2019s board of directors for four years. Gural owns three harness racing tracks.\n\u201cThe biggest fear that our industry has is that the states are going to stop subsidizing, using slot machines to subsidize the sport,\u201d Gural acknowledged in an\nop-ed\nwritten by industry critic Noah Shachtman. \u201cWithout that, there is no sport.\u201d\nFolks like these have political pull; the writer noted that Holliday threw a fundraiser for Hochul at the Saratoga Race Course. But it\u2019s hard to square their business careers with the use of tax revenue to prop up horse racing.\nGural and Holliday are proud capitalists, as is most everybody in real estate \u2014 which is one reason many industry people\ntried to prevent\nthe election of the Democratic socialist Mamdani.\nYes, horse racing sustains thousands of jobs and still draws fans to its biggest events. But subsidizing child care \u2014 or any number of things, such as repairing aging buildings \u2014 would also create jobs and make people happy. They would probably deliver more bang for the buck, too.\nSome investors are profiting from horseracing subsidies, but grandstands are\nroutinely empty\n. The public has moved on.\nLots of once-thriving industries have\nwithered\nas people\u2019s interests have changed. We don\u2019t subsidize bowling alleys for the sake of nostalgia and job preservation. Why horse racing? Its workers are often poorly paid and badly treated and its athletes are frequently\ninjured\nor\nkilled\n.\nShachtman makes a strong case for letting the industry fend for itself, as we have done for so many others. Dog racing, once active in 18 states, is down to just one, West Virginia. No governments stepped in to save Blockbuster Video, the Yellow Pages or television repair shops.\nReal estate makes money, powers the economy and improves Americans\u2019 lives by\nredeveloping outdated venues\ninto useful ones. Gural and Holliday are doing that right now with the\nFlatiron Building\nand\n750 Third Avenue\n, respectively.\nIf subsidies for horse racing ceased, tracks that failed to survive on their own would be repurposed by developers. Lots of people would profit from the work and the casino revenue being diverted to racing would go somewhere more important.\nI hear there\u2019s a housing shortage.\n",

        "content": "For years, data centers were the quiet asset class \u2014 windowless boxes built on the periphery, generating substantial tax revenue with minimal traffic and zero school-age children to burden local districts. Approving them was often a rubber stamp for municipalities.\nBut this week, the \u201ccloud\u201d crashed into the reality of the suburban \u201ccrowd\u201d in Chicago\u2019s western suburbs, signaling that the era of easy approvals is officially over.\nThe flashpoint occurred in\nNaperville\n, where the City Council effectively killed a proposal by Karis Critical to build a campus on the city\u2019s northwest side. Despite the promise of tax dollars, a resident revolt over noise, power lines and property values forced the council\u2019s hand. A few miles away in\nLisle\n, the friction was identical, as a public hearing for another data center proposed by Cloud Centers LLC had to be postponed simply because the venue couldn\u2019t hold the number of residents who showed up to voice their concerns.\nThis resistance marks a critical shift for developers. The conversation has moved to the grid. A\nChicago Tribune editorial\nthis month raised sharp questions about how the massive electricity thirst of AI data centers impacts ComEd bills for regular ratepayers. This has handed opposition groups a powerful new talking point, moving the argument from \u201cnot in my backyard\u201d to \u201cnot on my grid.\u201d Developers are no longer just explaining setbacks and screening walls; they are being asked to justify their impact on the regional power supply.\nThe stakes for navigating this new landscape are astronomical. While Naperville and Lisle tap the brakes, the\ncapital floodgates remain open\nnearby. In late 2025, news broke of Amazon\u2019s massive plan for data center campuses in northwest Indiana, including a\nconfirmed site in Hobart\n, with total investment potentially topping $15 billion. Further north in Grayslake,\nT5 Data Centers has been aggressively assembling land\n, spending over $60 million to expand its footprint, and it\u2019s already required significant power from utility ComEd. Although even that project faced scrutiny regarding its proximity to residential neighborhoods.\nThe events in Naperville and Lisle mirror a suburban Chicago trend that began bubbling up late last year, when\nAurora implemented a moratorium on data center developments\nto draft updates to its rules and general suburban pushback began slowing the boom.\nFor developers, the entitlement process for the big tech industrial complex now resembles the battleground of high-rise projects downtown. The remote cornfield sites are gone, and today\u2019s development parcels neighbor subdivisions. To win approval in 2026, data center operators cannot rely solely on the economic argument. They will need to master the art of community relations, clearly articulating the tradeoffs and addressing fears about resources and noise well before the public hearing.\n",

        "content": "The Real Deal\nwrote about two deals this week that tell different but somewhat similar stories about Los Angeles\u2019 office world:\none\ndowntown and\nanother\nin Silicon Beach.\nThe latter, a creative office building in Venice, occupied by technology giant Google and designed by the late Frank Gehry, traded for $39.6 million, or about $500 per square foot. The other, an office tower on Bunker Hill, owned by Brookfield, which has defaulted on more than $500 million of debt tied to the property, could trade for $180 million, or about $130 a square foot, if and when a deal that\u2019s currently in the works closes.\nThere is an obvious difference between downtown and Silicon Beach, not to mention Google and Brookfield. Those are chief among various reasons that one traded for $500 per square foot and the other isn\u2019t close to the $200-per-square foot-mark.\nDowntown L.A.\u2019s office market continues to have serious problems \u2014 deep enough to raise questions about its future as a commercial hub. It\u2019s been bumping along the bottom for enough time to render a bargain price being bandied about for a Class A tower on Bunker HIll is no surprise.\nThe $500-per-square-foot for the iconic Binoculars Building does give pause, however, as a reminder that Southern California is still working out its new normal. Industry players estimate the property probably would have traded for $1,000 per square foot before the pandemic, and its current price reveals a reset through the lens of (pun intended) one of the best-known creative office spaces in once desirable areas such as Silicon Beach.\nBack in downtown, commercial giant Brookfield, mostly via lenders or receivers, still has other office tower\nofferings\nthroughout downtown\u2019s Financial District that accounts for about a fifth of Class A office space. Keep an eye on that lineup as it sells off in deals that could set a firm bottom for the market.\nMeanwhile, here\u2019s a recap of key details on the recent trade in Silicon Beach and pending deal on Bunker Hill.\nSilicon Beach trade: The Luzzatto Company purchased the three-story, 79,000-square-foot property at 340 Main Street, where a pair of 45-foot-tall binoculars stands, from a W.P. Carey spin-off. Luzzatto received a $24 million loan. The city transfer tax, which includes a special tax via Measure ULA, amounted to more than $2 million.\nDowntown deal talk: 601W is in talks to purchase the mortgage loan on 333 South Grand Avenue, which encompasses Wells Fargo Center \u2014 North Tower and the retail spot connected to it, owned by Brookfield, for $180 million, knowledgeable sources said. The deal has not closed, according to an informed source. It appears to be lender-facilitated, and the buyer could then do a deed in lieu of foreclosure.\nSome studio solace\nHudson Pacific Properties, Vornado Realty Trust and Blackstone \u2014 AKA the joint venture partners behind just-opened Sunset Pier 94 Studios \u2014 recently announced a paramount\ntenant\n\u2026 literally. Paramount Television Studios leased 70,000 square feet to film the second season of\nDexter: Resurrection.\nThat\u2019s 30 percent of the 232,000 square feet of leasable stages, production support space and offices. A strong start for the new space, and relative boom compared with Blackstone and Hudson Pacific Properties\u2019 Sunset Glenoaks, which is only 8 percent leased, and was\ndeconsolidated\nby Victor Coleman\u2019s Los Angeles-based real estate investment trust.\nSeparately, an $87 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan secured by an office building in Burbank and owned by Blackstone and Worthe Real Estate Group moved to special servicing for imminent monetary default, Bisnow\nreported\n, citing Morningstar data. Its sole tenant, Warner Bros., vacated and it has sat empty since.\nFly away\nThe $45 million debt on a Marriott-branded hotel, a half a mile away from LAX\u2019s entrance, moved to special servicing for imminent monetary default, according to Morningstar. The hotel, at 5933 West Century Boulevard, appears to be owned by Seaview Investors, which lists the real estate as part of its portfolio online. Seaview\u2019s chief executive Robert Alter is the named loan sponsor, per Morningstar. Servicer commentary via Morningstar only indicates that the special servicer, Rialto Capital Advisors, is reaching out to the borrower. Seaview did not respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Last week,\nRick Caruso\nsaid \u201cno\u201d to a political run. This week, the why became a bit clearer.\nAs the developer shook hands and spoke to a crowd sitting by an empty residential lot on La Fiesta Avenue in Altadena on Thursday, he uttered the word \u201cprivate\u201d four times in less than three-and-a-half minutes \u2014 as in \u201cprivate sector\u201d and \u201cprivate individuals.\u201d\nThe purpose of the gathering on the residential street was to watch a 950-square-foot, factory-built home by\nSamara\n\u2014 the modular home outfit started by Airbnb founder Joe Gebbia \u2014 being dropped by crane and installed onto the lot to replace the property burned down by last year\u2019s Eaton Fire.\n\u201cA little over a year ago, it was clear to me that we had to have private enterprise, private individuals, jump into action and help the city, the county and the state, so Steadfast was formed,\u201d Caruso told the crowd.\nThe Caruso-founded non-profit is steered by a consortium of executives hailing from real estate, technology, finance and other industries to help expedite wildfire rebuilding.\nSteadfast and Samara teamed to start a program, giving modular homes to qualified homeowners who lost their homes from the fires. After Friday\u2019s installation, eight other families are in line for Samara-built homes.\n\u201cThis is what the private sector can do,\u201d Caruso said, motioning to the work Steadfast and Samara are doing.\nWhen the developer confirmed last week that he would not run for an elected office, part of his consideration was where \u201cI can make the greatest impact.\u201d His comments this week, and the tangible result of a family standing before what will be their new home in a matter of weeks, help fill in the picture.\nMismanaged funds\nSpeaking of local government, news broke Friday that Alexander Soofer was arrested by federal prosecutors. The Westwood resident is being charged with taking $23 million in public funds earmarked for homelessness programs.\nSoofer is the CEO of Abundant Blessings, a nonprofit that holds contracts with the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, an agency jointly funded by the county and city to coordinate social services and housing.\nThe federal criminal complaint alleges Soofer funneled some of the money toward a $7 million Westwood home, a $125,000 Range Rover, private school for his kids and other personal luxuries.\nLos Angeles Councilwoman Monica Rodriguez slammed LAHSA on Friday, asserting the agency \u201chas repeatedly failed to provide the basic oversight or accountability required for public resources.\u201d She called the charges against Soofer \u201cyet another example of the enormous resources that have been wasted while people remain unhoused and without help.\u201d\nGetting real on pricing\nYou might have missed the most recent\nprice cut\nfor the spec mansion called \u201cLa Fin\u201d in Bel-Air\u2014and you\u2019d be forgiven if you had. It was the fifth cut since 2022 when 1200 Bel Air Road went on the market for $139 million.\nThe latest asking price is just under $100 million, which Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California founder and CEO Aaron Kirman said represented a more \u201cpragmatic luxury market.\u201d\nIn other words, sellers are coming to terms with what buyers are willing to pay.\nThat opens the door to the question of whether the market sees a repeat of last year\u2019s trend of mansions closing below their original ask.\nIf the roughly 105,000-square-foot mega mansion\u2019s price cut and the thinking behind it from several of its listing agents (there\u2019s a team of seven hailing from four brokerages) is any indication, that would seem to be the case.\nCarolwood\u2019s latest play\nIn business, growth is a balancing act.\nIt\u2019s weighed against the need to generate more revenue to pay for additional talent or other resources, with factors that can\u2019t always be quantified, such as brand equity.\nCarolwood Estates\nseems to be striking the balance.\nAs the brokerage continues to grow its share of the local market, it\u2019s still found ways to expand its customer base geographically without losing its Beverly Hills boutique branding as seen with this past week\u2019s announcement of a partnership with Knight Frank.\nThe deal with the London real estate firm opens the buyer and seller pool for Carolwood. It now has the ability to market overseas to buyers looking for West Coast trophy properties or show existing clients a growing reach.\n",

        "content": "I don\u2019t usually step out from behind my byline, but it felt necessary for recapping a week when I became part of the story.\nI\u2019ve been covering the\nfinancial unraveling of Jon Venetos\u2019 Dallas-based multifamily investment firm Lurin Capital\nfor the better part of a year. When residents of Lurin\u2019s\nMadison, Alabama property the Sutton\nstarted to feel the effects of their landlord\u2019s collapse \u2014 these folks had been without water for more than a week after Lurin stopped paying utilities bills \u2014 NBC\u2019s Huntsville affiliate WAFF picked up the story.\nReporter Nick Balenger has been on the \u201cSutton Saga\u201d beat, depicting substandard living conditions at the Sutton and detailing tenants\u2019 efforts to get them fixed. In trying to get answers on their behalf, he found the same thing I did: a company refusing to publicly answer for the harm it\u2019s causing.\nBalenger reached out to chat about my reporting and asked me to contribute to a\nsegment\non the situation. We talked Tuesday, and Balenger wove our interview into a piece that includes his on-the-ground reporting from the properties. I explained that Lurin\u2019s breakdown is an example of multifamily syndicators going sideways when interest rates rose but that this story is unique for the accusations of fraud coming from lenders and former employees.\nAL.com\nand Huntsville\u2019s CBS affiliate\nWHNT\nhave also been covering the situation in Madison County. In the last week, local water provider Madison Utilities closed Lurin\u2019s account after it accumulated\n$30,000 in unpaid bills\n. The city of Madison declared the Sutton a public nuisance, which requires tenants to leave the property. The city has been working to help displaced residents, including partnering with local homelessness nonprofit ShowerUp Huntsville to provide shower and laundry services.\nLurin hit with five more foreclosures\nMeanwhile, Lurin Capital\u2019s legal challenges from lenders keep coming. In the latest spate of lawsuits,\nFannie Mac accused Lurin\nof defaulting on $59.4 million tied to five Pensacola, Florida, properties. Lurin borrowed nearly $60 million in January 2024 and stopped making payments in October 2025, Fannie Mae claims.\nThe lender also accuses Lurin of neglecting the properties and allowing liens to pile up against them.\nThe government-sponsored lender\u00a0 is asking the court to foreclose on the properties and demand payment of the unpaid principal on the loans, interest and attorneys\u2019 fees.\nThe suits mark the second state in which Fannie Mae has sued Lurin. It claimed in a Nov. 6 Texas District Court filing that the firm\ndefaulted on a $77.2 million loan\ntied to Latitude 2976, a 734-unit Houston apartment complex at 201 and 301 Wilcrest Drive.\nMegatel\u2019s foray into cryptocurrency\nWhat do Kanye West, Barron Trump and Dallas-based homebuilder Megatel have in common? They\u2019ve all launched crypto tokens. Megatel co-founders Zach and Aaron Ipour announced the launch of\nMegPrime\nafter receiving a \u201cno-action\u201d letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company is marketing the token as a payment and rewards tool, rather than an investment. Using MegPrime on average purchases will allow token users to earn rebates, discounted gift cards and points redeemable for housing-related benefits.\nMaves narrow down site search\nDallas\u2019 NBA team dreams of playing in a new arena by 2031, meaning it has five years to develop its new home. The Mavs are planning to ditch American Airlines Center in Victory Plaza but appear to be making good on the promise to stay in the city. CEO Rick Welts told the Dallas Morning News that the team has been working with city officials and\nnarrowed down the search to two locations\n: North Dallas\u2019 Valley View site, once home to a regional mall, or Downtown Dallas. A downtown site could involve the land under City Hall, but that option of course hinges on whether the city ultimately preserves or demolishes the I.M. Pei\u2013designed building.\n",

        "content": "Gary Barnett is bulking up again in Midtown.\nThe Extell founder is in contract to buy a prime development site at 405-415 Park Avenue, along with a chunk of air rights from nearby Central Synagogue, according to people familiar with the deal. Barnett is also in negotiations to acquire an adjacent office building at 110 East 55th Street, potentially stitching together what could become one of the most significant new assemblages in Midtown.\nThe Park Avenue sites are controlled by two ownership groups that have been quietly marketing the properties for either a sale or recapitalization. A joint venture between GDS Development and Swedish investor Corem Property Group AB owns\n407\u2013417 Park Avenue\n. Deutsche Bank\u2019s asset management arm and MRP Realty bought\n405 Park Avenue\nin 2016 (it\u2019s unclear if Deutsche Bank or DWS, which was spun out from the bank in 2018, is the current partner). Meanwhile, the Parkoff Organization owns 110 East 55th Street.\nThe sale price was not disclosed, but sellers were seeking north of $500 million. The Park Avenue site, which sits between East 54th and East 55th streets, can support roughly 527,000 square feet of development as-of-right, or as much as 700,000 square feet of rentable office space with additional air rights, according to marketing materials. That does not include the East 55th Street property.\nThe assemblage is steps from JPMorgan Chase\u2019s new 2.5 million-square-foot global headquarters at 270 Park Avenue and near Citadel and Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s planned tower at 350 Park Avenue.\nA Newmark team led by Adam Spies, Marcella Fasulo and Adam Doneger negotiated the assemblage sale. CBRE\u2019s Steve Siegel and a Fried Frank team advised on the air rights deal.\nSpokespeople for Extell, GDS, Corem, MRP Realty, DWS and Parkoff Organization did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Deutsche Bank declined to comment.\nIf the deal closes, it would mark another major Midtown bet for Barnett, who has spent years amassing land and air rights along Park Avenue and in the Plaza District. While the ultimate use of the site is not known, the location and scale suggest a high-end office or mixed-use tower aimed at tenants willing to pay a premium to be near the city\u2019s newest trophy developments.\nExtell is also developing a 29-story office and retail tower at\n570 Fifth Avenue\n, between West 46th and 47th Streets. Extell filed plans for\n655 Madison Avenue\nthat include commercial and office space as part of a taller mixed-use tower, though the primary focus is residential.",

        "content": "Commercial real estate distress in Texas is shifting, as more\nhospitality properties\nhit the foreclosure auction block.\nThe latest major Texas hotel to face foreclosure is Le Meridien Dallas, a boutique hotel in Far North Dallas near the Dallas Galleria mall. The property, at 13402 Noel Road, is owned by NB Holdings, which is run by Aly Nadir Badruddin. The owner allegedly defaulted on the $42.8 million loan tied to the property, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service. Morgan Stanley provided the mortgage in 2019, records show.\nBadruddin\u2019s firm\nbought the property in 2015\n. The 11-story, 258-key hotel was built in 2002 and renovated in 2009 when it became a Le Meridien property.\nThe hotel\u2019s ownership entity filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April 2022. At the time, it had less than 100 creditors, between $50 million and $100 million in assets and between $50 million and $100 million in liabilities.The firm completed the bankruptcy process in March 2024, court filings show.\nThe hotel made headlines in 2016 after\n46-year-old Brian Sample\nwas found killed in a 10th-floor room at Le Meridien Dallas.\nThere\u2019s one other hotel in the Metroplex with the Le Meridien flag,\nLe Meridien Fort Worth Downtown\n, at 811 Commerce Street. Blueprint Hospitality converted a former parking garage into the 188-key hotel.\nThe Stoneleigh\n, at 2927 Maple Avenue in Uptown Dallas, is dropping the Le Meridien brand with the debut of a multimillion-dollar renovation set to be completed this spring. The property, which is owned by Brookfield, will transition to Marriott\u2019s Autograph Collection.\nApartment complexes and office properties have dominated the foreclosure auction block across the Texas Triangle in the last few years. But distress has been shifting to include more hospitality properties. In January, nearly $170 million in loans tied to hotels were flagged for foreclosure in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service.\n",
