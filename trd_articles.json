        "content": "Vanbarton Group landed a $280 million loan for Pearl House, its recent Financial District office-to-residential conversion.\nAllianceBernstein provided a $238 senior loan for the 588-unit luxury apartment building at 160 Water Street, according to property records. Brookfield provided $42 million in mezzanine debt.\nThe fresh financing replaces a $277 million loan from Brookfield\u2019s lending arm for the conversion of the 24-story, 533,000-square-foot office building. Eastdil Secured brokered the deal, which was first reported by\nCommercial Observer\n.\nVanbarton, led by Gary Tischler and Richard Coles, purchased the 1970s-era office building in 2014 for $165 million. The developer mulled selling the property, but ultimately decided to undertake the conversion in 2022.\n\nLeasing for the market-rate units\nlaunched in 2023\nand the building was 99 percent occupied within a year, a Vanbarton spokesperson said. When the sales at the Pearl House first launched, rents for studio apartments started at $3,500. One-bedroom units were priced at $4,700, while two-bedroom units started at $6,400. The building has more than 30,000 square feet of amenities, including a bowling alley and a hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber.\nVanbarton has been doing conversions for more than two decades, and its appetite shows no signs of slowing. The firm just bought its third office building in the past year as bargains in the office market, new city and state incentives and demand for new apartments have led to a boom in conversion opportunities.\nThe developer bought\n6 East 43rd Street\nfrom the Milstein family\u2019s Emigrant Savings Bank for $135 million last May and plans to convert it into 441 rental apartments. It\u2019s shelling out about $100 million to buy the home of the Archdiocese of New York at\n1011 First Avenue\n, which it plans to transform into 420 apartments. And late last year, it bought 77 Water Street in the Financial District for\n$95 million\n, which it will turn into 600 units.\n",

        "content": "The Westin New York Grand Central is about to get some upgrades thanks to fresh financing.\nA joint venture of Bain Capital Special Solutions and Smith Hill Capital provided sponsor Davidson Kempner Capital Management with a $216 million loan to refinance the hotel at 212 East 42nd Street, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. Loan proceeds are expected to go towards capital improvements.\nA JLL team including Kevin Davis, Mark Fisher and Jillian Mariutti arranged the loan at the 774-key property.\nBesides Westin\u2019s brand recognition, Smith Hill\u2019s Brendan McCormick pointed to \u201creally attractive supply dynamics\u201d for the hotel market on the East Side of Manhattan as part of the rationale for his firm\u2019s involvement.\nDavidson Kempner acquired the property one block away from Grand Central from seller Host Hotels and Resorts\nfor $302 million\nin 2019. Goldman Sachs provided the firm with $197 million in short-term, floating-rate debt for the deal and Davidson Kempner planned $20 million in renovations; it was the firm\u2019s first purchase of a major hotel in the United States.\n\nIn 2023, Davidson Kempner paid down $63 million in principal from the Goldman Sachs loan and\nsecured a $150 million loan\nfrom Apollo Global Management.\nThe 41-story hotel was developed in 1981 by Harry Helmsley. It included design touches like a red-and-gold carpet and a pair of attached golden H\u2019s mounted over the front desk. Leona Helmsley, the \u201cQueen of Mean,\u201d reportedly lorded over the hotel\u2019s operations and staff.\nHer estate sold the property in 2011\nfor $313.5 million\nto Host Hotels, which closed it for 18 months and spent $75 million to renovate and replace the dated design. Host Hotels repositioned the property and opened it in 2012 under Marriott International\u2019s upper-upscale Westin brand.\nSmith Hill (whose parent company is Procaccianti Companie) and Bain formed a joint venture two years ago to provide capital solutions to hospitality ventures. In the spring, they\nlent $235 million\nto refinance Gurney\u2019s Montauk Resort on Long Island.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Mayor Eric Adams is making a major move before leaving City Hall: locking in Related Companies to run Wollman Rink for the next two decades.\nWollman Park Partners II, an affiliate of Related, was selected to take over the concession, beating out the Trump Organization and a bid from the Central Park Conservancy, according to a Parks Department announcement reported by\nThe City\n. The deal includes $10.9 million in upgrades to the rink and $91 million in concession fees over the 20-year term.\nThe nonprofit Conservancy pushed a competing offer to donate $120 million and operate the rink, promising a broader reimagining of the park\u2019s southeast corner.\nBetsy Smith, the group\u2019s president, blasted the city\u2019s decision to maintain \u201can island of for-profit commerce in the middle of Central Park\u201d rather than accept a plan that would have added bathrooms, fixed accessibility issues and created year-round cultural programming.\nInstead, Related will remain in control of the site it was\nfirst tapped\nto manage in 2021, when then-Mayor Bill de Blasio yanked the Trump Organization\u2019s contract after the Jan. 6 riot; Trump bid again for control this time around.\n\nRelated pledged to install a new ice-making system, upgrade mechanical infrastructure and improve stormwater management. A Parks spokesperson said the work wouldn\u2019t disrupt operations.\nThe timing was key: Parks rushed to get the deal before the Franchise Concession Review Committee\u2019s Oct. 16 meeting, ensuring Adams could finalize it before stepping down in December after ending his re-election bid. Had the administration missed that window, the decision would have fallen to his successor. The committee still needs to approve Related\u2019s bid.\nThe move extends Related\u2019s footprint in city-backed projects. In June, Adams\nannounced a deal\nwith the developer to build 4,000 apartments, including 764 permanently affordable units, over the Hudson Yards rail yard, a project buoyed by $2 billion in public funds.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Toronto-based Great Gulf bought the 3-acre waterfront property for\n$28.5 million\nlast year, after completing its 25-story, 83-unit\nLa Clara\ntower in 2023.\nIts latest planned condo, 5400 North Flagler, is slated to replace the Poinsettia Apartments, a two-building multifamily complex spanning three stories and 72 units built in 1966. The property at 5400 North Flagler will include a pool and the developer is considering adding a dock with between four and eight slips, according to the plans presented.\nThe design team includes Moshe Safdie\u2019s Safdie Architects, West Palm Beach-based Spina O\u2019Rourke + Partners, Toronto-based interiors firm Studio Munge, and landscape firm Enea, which is based in Rapperswil-Jona, Switzerland.\nGreat Gulf was founded in 1975 by Harry Rosenbaum, Elly Reisman, Norm Reisman, Larry Robbins and Seymour Joffe, according to reports. It has built more than 80,000 homes across North America, and currently has more than 9,000 units planned or under construction, according to its website. Neil Vohrah is its president of high-rise residential, and is overseeing the 5400 North Flagler project.\n\nIt marks Great Gulf\u2019s second project in the coastal city. It sold out La Clara at 200 Arkona Court for\nmore than $209 million\n.\nBuyers included American Express heiress Stephanie Currey Ingram, Marvel Studios executive Louis D\u2019Esposito, and Jonathan Lerner, whose D.C.-based developer family owns the Washington Nationals. Spec developer Todd Glaser and his partner Jim Randall bought the penthouse unit for\n$18.8 million\n, with the intention to flip it for $28.5 million, but the unit has since been pulled from the market.\nLa Clara\u2019s owners\nfiled a lawsuit against Great Gulf\nin February, alleging the building had construction defects and lacked the luxury finishes buyers were promised.\nIts 5400 North Flagler joins a stacked pipeline of planned condominiums in West Palm Beach, where\nmore than 2,000 units are in development\n. Also in the North Flagler Drive corridor are Related Group and BH Group\u2019s planned 21-story, 39-unit\nApogee\ntower and BGI Capital and Blue Road\u2019s 22-story, 55-unit\nAlba Palm Beach\n, which is nearing completion.\n",

Even so, the number of units under construction in Los Angeles has been in a free fall since early last year, approaching a decade low.\nFewer than 19,000 apartments were under construction in the third quarter, a 30 percent drop from three years ago, per CoStar.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a needle in a haystack to find an opportunity that makes financial sense to build today,\u201d developer Cliff Goldstein told the Times. \u201cA developer without investors would be like a king without clothes. I am an optimistic developer who wants to develop, but the investment community won\u2019t participate.\u201d\nDevelopers have shelved projects and taken their business\nto other municipalities\n.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t bought a site with the intention to develop it in over two years,\u201d Kahan told the outlet. \u201cI don\u2019t know when we will be building in L.A next\u201d\nThe Real Deal\u2019s Building Back L.A.\nroundtable revealed similar sentiments last month.\n\u201cBuyers and sellers are absolutely disgruntled over ULA, and it is not going away.

        "content": "The Nakash family\u2019s woes at its Breakwater hotel in South Beach continue, this time because of a loan default.\nThe debt on the 100-key hotel at 940 and 960 Ocean Drive in Miami Beach entered special servicing after the Nakashes failed to pay off the loan at its maturity last month, marking the third time the financing is in special servicing, according to Morningstar Credit. The owners, through an affiliate, took out the $31.3 million loan in 2014 as a refinancing, with the debt\u2019s balance now at $28.2 million.\nThe\nNakash\nfamily \u2013\u2013 led by brothers Joe, Ralph and Avi Nakash, who are founders of clothing firm Jordache Enterprises and also lead New York-based Nakash Holdings \u2013\u2013 have a portfolio of South Beach hotels that includes the former Versace Mansion and the hotel portion of\nThe Setai Miami Beach\n.\nThe Nakashes, through an affiliate, bought the Breakwater hotel out of bankruptcy in 2008 for $24.8 million, according to records. This amount may be lower than the true price because deeds generally don\u2019t reflect furniture and fixtures usually included in hotel purchases.\nThe Breakwater, completed in 1939 and renovated in 2011, consists of a four-story building at 940 Ocean Drive and a five-story building at 960 Ocean Drive, according to records and Morningstar Credit.\nNakash family members and their representatives didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nAlthough full-year financials for the hotel haven\u2019t been provided for the past two years, the loan\u2019s debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) has been near or less than the breakeven metric for the majority of the financing\u2019s term, according to Morningstar Credit.\nDSCR is a measurement of whether a property\u2019s cash flow is enough to cover expenses, with a measurement of 1x considered the breakeven. Breakwater\u2019s DSCR was last reported at 0.73x in 2023, according to Morningstar Credit.\nThe loan first experienced trouble in 2020, entering special servicing during the Covid lockdown, according to a June\nKBRA report\n.\nAt the start of the pandemic, tourism and hospitality business halted and hotels suffered a drop in bookings.\nIn 2022, Breakwater\u2019s financing was taken out of special servicing following a forbearance agreement, KBRA\u2019s report says.\n\nBut bigger trouble came, rooted not in bookings and revenue but in a legal dispute between the Nakashes and Ocean\u2019s Ten, a restaurant tenant at the hotel owned by Catherine and Anthony Arrighi.\nOcean\u2019s Ten had first sued the Nakashes\u2019 Breakwater ownership entity in 2020, alleging the landlord was trying to illegally evict the restaurant. The Nakashes responded with a countersuit, arguing in part that the restaurant was violating noise ordinances and the lease due to loud noise, and also sued to evict Ocean\u2019s Ten.\nIn 2022, Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Valerie Manno Schurr entered a scathing order for\n$17.4 million\nin punitive damages and $2.1 million in attorney fees against the Nakashes. The ruling was based on the determination that the Nakash family enterprise submitted fabricated evidence in the case, lied under oath, filed a false expert report to the court and lied to Miami Beach city officials and special magistrates, according to the order. The owners had allegedly hired a private investigator to pose as a hotel guest and made up sham noise complaints about the restaurant.\nThe hotel\u2019s loan went into special servicing for a second time in 2022 due to the judge\u2019s order, according to the KBRA report.\nMost recently, the Nakashes got some good news in the case. In January, an appeals court agreed with the family and struck down the $17.4 million punitive damages award to the restaurant, court filings show. The appeals panel of judges determined Ocean\u2019s Ten failed to establish \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d it\u2019s entitled to punitive damages.\nThe appeals court still upheld the lower court\u2019s decision to strike the Nakashes\u2019 push to evict Ocean\u2019s Ten, and its order for sanctions against the Nakahses.\nIn the meantime, the hotel\u2019s loan matured in September of last year but a forbearance agreement between the lender and Nakashes pushed back the maturity to September of this year, according to Morningstar Credit. Last month\u2019s default marked the third time the debt goes to special servicing.\nIt\u2019s unclear who is the Nakahses\u2019 lender on the Breakwater. Their ownership entity, 940 Ocean Drive, and Nakash Holdings recorded no mortgage on the property since 2008 in public records.\nMorningstar Credit lists the lender as Pillar, though several financiers with variations of this name exist.\nIn South Beach, the Nakashes own Hotel Victor at 1144 Ocean Drive, Hotel Ocean at 1236 Ocean Drive and the commercial space at The Strand at 1052 Ocean Drive. In 2023, a Nakash affiliate and its partner VE Group paid\n$23.5 million\nfor the 80-room, five-story Beacon South Beach Hotel building at 720 Ocean Drive, also in South Beach.\nThe family bought the former Versace Mansion, home of the late fashion designer Gianni Versace, out of bankruptcy in 2013 for\n$41.5 million\n. The property at 1116 Ocean Drive has been converted into a hotel and the name The Villa Casa Casuarina.\n",

The city paid $13.5 million for the site, which it has leased for years.\nBXP\nlisted the property in May\nafter its plans for a proposed tech campus fell apart. The company, formerly known as Boston Properties, had owned the land since 2000, paying $35 million for multiple parcels from the city\u2019s Redevelopment Agency. BXP hoped to build two 16-story towers with 1.4 million square feet of office space, 37,600 square feet of retail, plus amenity space and underground parking. As\noffice space demand\ndropped after the pandemic, BXP gave up on those plans.\nThe site is across the street from the San Jose Convention Center and behind the Children\u2019s Discovery Museum and Discovery Meadow. The parking lot is a reliable revenue generator for the city, but it could be transformed into a critical piece of downtown San Jose\u2019s activity.\n\n\u201cSecuring this property will provide greater flexibility for the city as we consider a range of possibilities, including potential\nconvention center expansion\nor other sports and entertainment district uses such as a flagship hotel, retail, restaurants, arts and cultural venues, or other gathering spaces,\u201d Kevin Ice, the city\u2019s director of real estate, told the outlet.\nThe City of San Jose will use its commercial paper program to issue notes for short-term borrowing. Then it will use parking revenue and convention center funds to pay back the notes. Including financing costs, the acquisition is estimated to cost $15.7 million.\nCity officials are bullish on the idea of creating mixed-use districts around major sports venues. The city recently signed a deal with the\nNHL\n\u2019s San Jose Sharks to keep the team in the city until 2051 and to renovate their SAP Center arena a few blocks away from the 447 South Almaden site.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The company plans to move by the end of the year. The Carrollton hub will bring 1,800 new jobs.\nThe four-story office building, constructed in 2019, has a gym, cafe and patio. Pharmaceutical company AmerisourceBergen put the building on the sublease market nearly two years ago, CoStar\nreported\n. It was the area\u2019s second-largest office sublease at the time.\nPennyMac\nleased nearly 76,000 square feet\nat the Plano Corporate Center East building, at 2201 West Plano Parkway, in 2016. The property was formerly the campus for FedEx Office.\n\nNews of the Carrollton hub comes as\nPennyMac enters a subservicing relationship with Annaly Capital Management\n, the world\u2019s largest residential mortgage REIT. Per the agreement, Annaly is acquiring a portfolio of PennyMac\u2019s mortgage servicing rights; PennyMac will manage the loans.\nAs the Metroplex sprawls, companies are becoming more interested in\nestablishing offices in suburbs\n, closer to where employees live. The trend has translated to increased office leasing activity in spots like Carrollton, Plano and Frisco.\nFor example, Simpson Strong-Tie Company, a California-based manufacturer of construction fasteners and connectors,\nsigned a deal\nat Plano\u2019s Granite Park 6, which was delivered in 2023 and is now 58 percent occupied. It\u2019s leasing 38,000 square feet. Similarly, Sally Beauty is\nrelocating from its longtime headquarters\nin Denton to a 140,000-square-foot spot at 7900 Windrose Avenue in Plano\u2019s Legacy West.\nWhile office vacancy is elevated at 25.2 percent, levels in these submarkets are faring much better, with vacancy rates in the high teens and low twenties, according to Avison Young.\n",

        "content": "Illinois\u2019 controversial method of seizing properties over unpaid taxes is on thinner ice after a federal judge allowed a class-action lawsuit to move forward, raising the prospect that counties could owe millions to former property owners.\nU.S. District Judge Nancy J. Rosenstengel of the Southern District of Illinois denied an effort by treasurers from five counties to\ntoss the case\n, in a Sept. 30 opinion. The lawsuit, brought by property owners including Top Metal Buyers Inc., challenges Illinois\u2019 practice of stripping owners of all equity in a property once it is lost in a tax deed sale, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe opinion is among the first from a judge to explicitly say counties could be on the hook for violating constitutional protections.\nThe backdrop is the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2023 decision in Tyler v. Hennepin County, which found that keeping more than what\u2019s owed in taxes amounts to an unconstitutional taking. In that case, a Minnesota woman lost a $40,000 home over $15,000 in back taxes \u2014 and the Court ruled she was owed the $25,000 difference.\nIllinois\nis the lone state among the 14 with similar systems that has yet to reform its laws. A push in Springfield\nfizzled this year\n, and Cook County Treasurer Maria Pappas has punted the county\u2019s tax sales until next year, saying she wants time to pursue reforms. Other counties, however, pressed ahead with sales \u2014 and now face potential liability.\n\nIn one example cited in the lawsuit, St. Clair County recouped $44,000 in unpaid taxes on an East St. Louis property worth $102,000, wiping out $58,000 in equity. Another plaintiff lost more than $100,000 in value when his home was sold over a $10,000 bill. The suit calls the practice \u201cinstitutionalized theft.\u201d\nCounty treasurers argue they were following state law and that third-party tax buyers \u2014 the investors who swoop in on delinquent properties \u2014 should bear responsibility for lost equity. Rosenstengel disagreed, writing that the constitutional violation stems from counties\u2019 failure to compensate owners for the surplus value.\nThe opinion doesn\u2019t resolve the case, but it heightens the risk that counties will ultimately be forced to reimburse former owners. The state already dominates national rankings for property tax\nburdens\nwith four of the five highest-taxing metro areas in the country.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Staff will draft documents for a preliminary rezoning approval, moving the project from industrial to residential.\nThe proposal, from Chicago-based Habitat Company on behalf of Red Cup Land Company, would create a 48-building community anchored by a clubhouse, walking trail and nine acres of green space. Thirty-four units would be reserved for households earning the area\u2019s median income under\nHighland Park\u2019s\ninclusionary housing rules.\nIf approved, construction could begin this spring and take up to two years, said Habitat vice president Zack Zalar. Before starting construction, the developer must clear another round of engineering reviews, satisfy environmental regulators about potential industrial contamination and answer lingering questions about density and traffic.\nThis hasn\u2019t been an easy win.\n\nMonday\u2019s four-hour meeting drew more than 50 attendees, echoing six prior hearings before the city\u2019s Plan and Design Commission, which narrowly recommended approval last month after 17 hours of deliberations. Some residents oppose the project\u2019s bulk and impact on traffic.\nHabitat\nhas already scaled the project down from an initial 262 homes, but Zalar said the developer won\u2019t cut further. The city is pressing instead for refinements: accessible trails, EV chargers, assurances that construction will be completed even if delays emerge, and a second traffic study once the homes are occupied.\nThe site has a contentious backstory. A 500-unit complex from\nInterforum Holdings\npitched in 2018 went nowhere, and a subsequent plan for a 300,000-square-foot warehouse complex from\nRed Cup Land Company\nalso failed to win city approval. That history weighed on Monday\u2019s debate, with several officials warning that rejecting Habitat\u2019s proposal could open the door to less palatable options.\nCouncil member Andr\u00e9s Tapia said that while the plan isn\u2019t perfect, it may strike the best balance between growth pressures and community concerns. The council will take up preliminary approval at a future meeting, with final consideration likely by end of year.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The $409 million redevelopment proposal, pitched by developers Mike Ablon of PegasusAblon and Mike Hoque of Hoque Global, would convert portions of the nearly 2 million-square-foot building at 901 Main Street into a hotel with event and retail space, plus a parking garage.\nThe vision is to stitch the project into the broader downtown core with elevated pedestrian connections. The developer are under contract to buy the\n1980s-era tower\n.\nThe Downtown Dallas Development Authority and the Downtown Connection Tax Increment Financing District both signed off on boosting their combined subsidy from $98 million to $103 million. The bump covers the cost of designing a new garage to support 200 residential units or hotel rooms stacked above it. The boards also approved expanding the geographic boundaries of the TIF district to capture a parcel that\u2019s part of the project at 901 Main Street.\nHoque\nand Ablon, through an entity called 901 Main PAHG Partners, struck a deal last year to buy the\n1.9 million-square-foot tower\nfrom Chicago-based Metropolis Holdings. The price wasn\u2019t disclosed. The Dallas Central Appraisal District valued the 1.85 million-square-foot tower at $130 million, or $70 per square foot.\n\nAblon framed the redevelopment as a lifeline for a central business district that has been losing traction with big-name tenants. The tower, nicknamed \u201cThe Pickle\u201d for its green nighttime glow, is about 70 percent leased and is losing its anchor tenant to\nUptown\n. AT&amp;T is also rumored to be reevaluating its headquarters footprint nearby, raising the stakes for a downtown revival.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not catalytic if you just put lipstick on a building,\u201d Ablon told the boards. \u201cWe have to change the playing field.\u201d\nUnder terms of the deal, PegasusAblon must close on the tower by next September and deliver the project by fall 2032 to keep the incentives in play. The sale was originally projected to close later this year. The package now heads to City Council for a vote Oct. 22.\nIf it clears, the deal would mark one of the largest city-backed downtown overhauls in years.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "There were 219 transactions totaling $259 million recorded in New York City over the 24 hours before 4:00 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 2.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Residential:\nThe priciest residential deal recorded in New York City was on the Upper East Side.\nEric Scuderi\n, a financier, and\nNatalia Wolff\ndropped $7.6 million on a co-op at\n770 Park Avenue\n. The seller was the estate of\nPatricia Klingenstein\n, a philanthropist who purchased the pad in 2012 for just under $10 million. Patricia was married to John Klingenstein, the son of investment banker Joseph Klingenstein who was among the founders of Mount Sinai\u2019s School of Medicine. The four-bedroom co-op comes with a storage rtoom and has two fireplaces and a library. Brown Harris Stevens\u2019\nAmanda Brainerd\nand\nGerartd Ryan\nhad the listing, which went live in January 2024 for a hair under $9 million.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nThe estate of\nVera Jaqueline Winsor\n, a Canadian-born sculptor, parted with a co-op at\n112 Mercer Street\nin Soho for just under $5 million. Winsor, whose work is in the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, had lived and worked in the full-floor loft since the 1960s. The buyer was\nAbby Caulkins\n, an art dealer. The unit spans about 3,000 square feet and has an additional 300 square feet of terrace space. The loft\u2019s monthly maintenance is just $200, as the co-op\u2019s shareholders receive income from the building\u2019s ground-floor retail tenant, Frankies Bikinis. The estate had put the loft on the market in June for $4.8 million. The listing agents were Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s\nGlenn Norrgard\nand\nSamantha Sitinas.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nAnother Soho artist\u2019s loft is off the market, this time for $4.3 million. The seller was the family of the late\nIda Applebroog\n, an artist whose work is in the Whitney, the Met, the MoMa and the Guggenheim Museum. The unit, the full eighth floor of\n491 Broadway\n, in the Cast Iron Historic District, spans about 4,000 square feet and is all open space. However, it can be renovated to accommodate three bedrooms and three bathrooms, according to the listing. A Compass team led by\nHenry Hershkowitz\nrepresented the sellers. The buyers were\nDonald and Liutauras Van Hook.\nBy the Numbers:\nWhere are new offices being built?\n\nDespite a sharp two-year drop in construction starts, builders haven\u2019t hit the brakes on office development entirely.\nNearly one-half of a percent of the nation\u2019s office stock is under construction, according to real estate data platform\nYardi Matrix\u2019s September report\n, which excluded properties set to be occupied by their owners. That\u2019s more than 40.2 million square feet of space.\nAustin is the major market that has the greatest share of its office stock under construction, with 2.5 percent, or 2.4 million square feet. Miami and Boston follow, with 2.2 percent of their space in the midst of being built.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "pub_date_dt": "2025-10-03T11:30:00",
        "content": "There\u2019s a mystery surrounding a controversial development site in Crown Heights.\nWill Yitzchok Schwartz, who\njust bought\n962-972 Franklin Avenue from Ian Bruce Eichner, build the mixed-income rental project that Eichner fought so hard to get approved for that site?\nOr will Schwartz build 100 percent market-rate condominiums, as he is doing next door at 960 Franklin Avenue?\nEichner once controlled both sites and sought to rezone them for a huge multifamily development with lots of affordable units, but was denied because it would have cast shadows on the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.\nThat killed his contract to buy 960 Franklin, which Schwartz later bought. Eichner did get a rezoning for the other half of the site, 962-972 Franklin, but the City Council shrank his project and attached some strings.\nUpon selling the land to Schwartz, Eichner issued a\ncryptic statement\n:\n\u201cWe sought approval for a project with height and density that should have been approved, namely, a union-built, union pension fund\u2013financed rental project with substantial affordability. Instead,\nBBG\nis getting what it wanted: non-union built, 100 percent market-rate condominiums in an already gentrified neighborhood \u2014 a tragedy for Crown Heights.\u201d\nDoes Eichner know what Schwartz would build at 972 Franklin? Or was he just venting? Neither man is talking. So I went to an impartial source to see what Schwartz\u2019s options are.\n\u201cIt was rezoned to MIH so there is an affordability requirement,\u201d said Wilson Parry of PropertyScout, referring to Mandatory Inclusionary Housing. \u201cSchwartz cannot evade this. He has to fulfill it either on-site or off-site.\u201d\nIf Schwartz puts the affordable units somewhere else, they must be nearby (see map), and he must build more of them \u2014 say, 35 percent of total units must be affordable instead of 30 percent.\nHe can choose from\nMIH options 1, 2 or 4\n. Eichner was targeting Option 4, aka workforce housing. That would allow market-rate units on 70 percent of the floor area.\nThe other 30 percent would have to be affordable at a weighted average of 115 percent of area median income, including 5 percent affordable at 90 percent of AMI and 5 percent affordable at 70 percent of AMI. No affordable band can be above 135 percent of AMI.\nIs your head spinning yet? There\u2019s more: At least 65 percent of the floors must have affordable units, half of which must have two or more bedrooms, and no more than 25 percent can be studios.\nThe bedroom mix must be the same as for the market-rate units. Progressives often say the government should stay out of people\u2019s bedrooms. But not when it comes to development, apparently.\nSchwartz\u2019s site offers 300,000 buildable square feet and a height limit of 125 feet. (City of Yes added 10 feet to the maximum height.)\n\nEichner clearly resents that the city fought his plans for the better part of a decade. But his statement\u2019s implication that Schwartz would build only market-rate condos was misleading.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nHow come shade from trees is nice, but from buildings is bad? The common argument that a proposed project would cast harmful shadows has never resonated with me. When I took my kids to parks and playgrounds, which was nearly every day, I tried to keep them out of the sun as much as possible. Sun or shade had no impact on their enjoyment, except on hot days, in which case they preferred shade. Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The Ahi Ezer project that\novercame\n\u201cmember deference\u201d was the first to benefit from the Adams administration\u2019s\nGreen Fast Track\n, which speeds up the administrative process before the public review for small and mid-size projects that use electricity for heat and hot water.\nElsewhere\u2026\nBuildings expert Henry Gifford has a theory about what caused the\nexplosion and partial building collapse\nat NYCHA\u2019s Mitchell Houses in the Bronx on the first day of heating season, Oct. 1.\nHe explained that if an oil boiler is not tuned up, soot can accumulate and burn if too much air is added to the flame. Some of the soot will burn off and some will turn into gas, mostly methane, and fill the chimney. If a burning ember from the soot makes its way into the shaft and ignites the gas \u2026 BOOM!\n\u201cThe likelihood of an investigator figuring this out, or even pursuing this line of investigation, is, I think, very slim,\u201d Gifford said.\nOne fact that may undercut his theory: the boilers in the building were gas, which burns more cleanly than oil.\nThe Housing Authority is not speculating on the cause, which is under investigation, but said in a statement, \u201cNYCHA\u2019s heating technicians check and monitor all heating plants daily and perform regular maintenance throughout the year.\u201d\nThe ventilation shaft that fell apart at 205 Alexander Avenue was not part of the 59-year-old building\u2019s structure, which is why the rest of the building appeared unaffected by the collapse, one observer noted in a\nYouTube video\n.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$4.2 million\nfor Unit 4C at 181 MacDougal Street in Greenwich Village. The unit, in a new condominium, is 1,300 square feet.\nCorcoran Sunshine Marketing Group\u2019s\nJames Weiss has the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$3.7 million\nfor 37-31 29th Street in Long Island City. The commercial building is 4,300 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $28.5 million for 123 East 73rd Street. The Lenox Hill townhome is 11,100 square feet and listed by\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s\nEpo Manning and Florence Danforth-Meyer.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

        "content": "Last month, I got a call from a broker who sells rent-stabilized buildings. It\u2019s been a brutal six years for people like him. And he needed to vent.\n\u201cI cannot believe how bad the environment in New York is,\u201d he began. \u201cAlmost every building is underwater.\u201d\nHe was talking about rent-stabilized buildings without enough free-market rentals to offset the\neffects\nof the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019.\nThe broker was so worked up, he hardly knew where to begin. But he had to start somewhere. Selling buildings with rent-stabilized units, he said, is now like traversing a minefield.\n\u201cThe due diligence is impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the paperwork from 15 years ago when you deregulated a unit, when the rent was $900, and now you\u2019re charging $6,000\u2026\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t need to finish the sentence, because rent-stabilized owners know exactly what he\u2019s talking about: the risk of having to pay a tenant years\u2019 worth of \u201c\novercharges\n\u201d because they can\u2019t document renovations that removed a unit from stabilization, back when that was allowed.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have [the documents], and you end up going to court with a tenant, you lose,\u201d he said.\nThe records must be precise about what renovations were done to each unit and the cost. An invoice from a contractor without those specifics doesn\u2019t cut it. Landlords better have saved the canceled check, too.\n\u201cBanks get rid of their records after seven years,\u201d the broker lamented.\nNo record-retention law existed, so not all landlords kept the paperwork. But years later, new laws and court rulings required it. Without the benefit of a time machine, some landlords are vulnerable to\nrent-overcharge lawsuits\n.\nIf a unit\u2019s deregulation is reversed retroactively, the owner must reimburse the tenant for the difference between the \u201clegal rent\u201d (had the unit remained stabilized) and what the tenant has been paying. If the action is deemed to be\nfraud\n, the payback triples.\n\u201cOne unit with\ntreble damages\ncan be more than $200,000,\u201d the broker said. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer an asset, it\u2019s a liability.\u201d\nI asked what metric best captures the devaluation of rent-stabilized buildings. Gross rent multiplier, he said. Multiplying that figure by the rent roll produces the expected sale price.\n\u201cDepending on the building and location, it can be anywhere from 4 to 6.5 times the rent roll,\u201d he said. \u201cIt used to be 14 to 18 times the rent roll.\u201d\nHe paused to let that sink in.\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking values dropping 75 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine if your stock portfolio dropped 75 percent in five years.\u201d\nHe could not understand why the New York Times and other major media outlets are not writing about this. I pointed out that the Times virtually stopped covering commercial real estate in the city when reporter\nCharles Bagli\nleft the staff in 2018.\nThe broker recalled urging owners to sell their rent-stabilized buildings in the early part of this decade, as the city rebounded from the pandemic. But owners were still shell-shocked by the 2019 rent law and figured the state legislature would fix it.\n\nBig mistake.\n\u201cThe prices just keep coming down,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have come down every day since June of 2019.\nEvery day.\n\u201d\nHe pointed to a building with a $1 million rent roll now worth about $5 million. \u201cI could have sold that five years ago for $10 million \u2014 during Covid!\u201d the broker said. \u201cAnd people just did nothing.\u201d\nAnother client bought a Bronx building in 2018 and got a $33 million mortgage. Today, the owner thinks the property is worth $13 million.\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t paid the loan in months, and the bank hasn\u2019t even put him in default yet,\u201d the broker said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want it. No one wants these buildings!\u201d\nActually, some investors are looking to buy \u2014 at steep discounts. Yet owners sometimes overplay their hands.\n\u201cBuyers are able to get financing, but I wish sellers really understood how difficult it is to get a deal done. They overnegotiate sometimes,\u201d the broker said.\nEven if largely ignored by major media outlets, the plight of rent-stabilized housing \u2014 which is nearly a third of the city\u2019s housing stock \u2014 has become increasingly apparent. Yet the state legislature has shown no urgency to address the issue, passing only a\nnearly useless tweak\nto the individual apartment improvements program.\n\u201cThere is nothing on the horizon that indicates any type of rent reform is near,\u201d the broker said.\nIf anything, he sees things getting worse, with Assembly member Zohran Mamdani expected to win the mayoral race on a\nfreeze-the-rent\ncampaign.\n\u201cMamdani, he\u2019s got Cea Weaver [advising his housing agenda]. What? These are all activists!\u201d he said. \u201cThe real estate industry is not waking up to this reality.\u201d\nWeaver has called private property \u201c\na weapon of white supremacy\n.\u201d\nNow, City Council members are trying to pass the\nCommunity Opportunity to Purchase Act\n. COPA is a version of the state bill TOPA, or Tenants Opportunity to Purchase Act. Both would pause multifamily sales for months to give tenants a chance to buy their buildings.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a disaster,\u201d the broker said. \u201cI think prices will go down another 10 percent if and when that happens.\u201d\nValues are falling so fast, he said, that \u201cif you have to wait six months [to sell], it could cost you a million dollars.\u201d\nTo him, TOPA and COPA are part of tenant activists\u2019 agenda to\nsocialize rent-stabilized buildings\n\u2014 to wrest them from their owners.\n\u201cThey are trying to take back the housing, and they are not hiding from this,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first step is devaluing it. Check. The next step is making it impossible to run a profit. Check. The next step is [giving tenants] a first or last right of first refusal.\n\u201cMy clients say, \u2018It cannot get worse.\u2019 Well, what about this?\u201d\n",

The 18,963-square-foot mansion sits on a 1.2-acre point lot with a pool, hot tub, outdoor kitchen and dock.\nThe property\nwent under contract\nin September. It\u2019s on the market with Eddy Martinez and Roland Ortiz of One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.

        "content": "A site in north San Jose proposed for a data center development just changed hands in a $200 million deal.\nA\nGoodman Group\naffiliate bought the property at 350 and 370 West Trimble Road from an\nLBA Realty\naffiliate in an all-cash deal, the Silicon Valley Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe 46.8-acres is mostly vacant land but also has an office complex partially occupied by lighting manufacturer Lumileds.\nLBA floated building a tech village of offices, shops, restaurants and a hotel on the site in 2019. Three years later, the Bay Area developer changed course, submitting another proposal for an advanced manufacturing site. It never started construction.\nLBA submitted a development permit to the city of San Jose earlier this year to build a 207,950-square-foot data center on the site. Goodman Group is known for developing, owning and managing logistics and data centers in cities around the globe.\nProperties next door are owned by Microsoft. LBA Realty sold off two adjacent sites to the tech giant in 2021 and 2023. Microsoft paid a combined $84.3 million for them, the Mercury News\nreported\n.\n\nMicrosoft is charging full steam ahead with its embrace of artificial intelligence, and itproposed building two data centers spanning 300,000 square feet on the adjacent parcels along Orchard Parkway. The construction permit for those projects have since expired without shovels hitting dirt. Earlier this year, the company\nannounced it would spend $80 billion\nto build data centers this year.\nMeanwhile, another data center is headed toward construction in downtown San Jose.\nVancouver, Canada-based developer Westbank submitted a proposal to the city\u2019s Planning Department in August to build 391 housing units next to a data center at 180 Park Avenue as part of Westbank\u2019s Park Habitat development. That data center is meant to\nbenefit Pacific Gas &amp; Electric\nby capturing the excess heat from the facility to provide low-cost, low-carbon energy to nearby residents.\nThe booming AI sector has been helping revitalize the Bay Area\u2019s office market after years of post-pandemic doldrums,\nparticularly in San Francisco\n. More than 50,000 new employees are expected to flock to the region over the next five years,\naccording\nto CBRE\u2019s estimates.\nThe South Bay and Peninsula are\nsimilarly attracting AI tenants\n. As AI grows, so too does the need for data centers, so it\u2019s likely more will continue to pop up in the Bay Area in the coming years.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Village Homes, a longtime Fort Worth homebuilder, filed for bankruptcy this week as it battles Dallas-based developer Olerio Homes over a collapsed land and branding deal.\nThe filing allows the company to keep building while it works through the dispute, according to a news release. The legal fight stems from a proposed sale last year of 100 vacant lots and the Village Homes name, part of a rebrand and retirement plan for one of the firm\u2019s founders, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram\nreported\n.\nVillage claims Olerio failed to secure financing and backed out after putting down $300,000.\nOlerio alleges the builder wrongly killed the deal, suing in Tarrant County for damages and control of the lots. In May, Olerio won an order blocking Village from selling the land; an August bid by Village to overturn the order was denied, court records show.\n\u201cThis is not a decision we take lightly,\u201d Village co-founder and president Michael Dike said, adding the company intends to keep paying employees, vendors and lenders. He framed the\nbankruptcy\nas a way to restructure and \u201ccome through this process intact.\u201d In the statement, Dike also said the filing is not lender-driven.\n\nSince launching in 1996, Village has delivered more than 1,500 homes across\nFort Worth\n, including projects in\nWalsh Ranch\nand Linwood, and is currently building luxury townhomes in Stonegate. Their product line ranges from custom single-family homes to condos and townhomes with pricepoints from $290,000 to upwards of $2 million.\nOlerio has been active in\nDallas luxury homebuilding\nand custom projects.\nThe standoff leaves Village\u2019s development pipeline tied up, its branding in limbo, and a Fort Worth company forced into bankruptcy court to preserve business as usual.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "An apartment complex for senior citizens is headed for construction thanks to\nbuilder\u2019s remedy\n.\nLaguna Hills City Council members voted to approve the project at the La Paz Village shopping center, Voice of OC\nreported\n. The project applicant is Nick Buchanan of Cape Point Development, which\nbought\nLa Paz Village in 2022 for $23.5 million.\nThe project is expected to replace some retail spaces in the mall with 180 studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments for tenants ages 55 and up. Of the units slated for construction, 10 percent of them, or 18 total, are set aside for very-low-income residents. In Orange County, very-low-income generally\nfalls under\nannual incomes of $59,250 or less for one person. For two people, the maximum annual income must not exceed $67,700.\nIn addition to the apartments, the 61-foot-tall project would include activity areas, a theater, gym, pool, salon and community courtyards.\nWhile the City Council voted 3-1 in favor of the development, the officials who approved the project said they felt their hand was forced thanks in part to builder\u2019s remedy and other state-level laws.\n\n\u201cYour concerns about this project\u2019s density, the height, the potential strain on traffic and resources, they\u2019re not just valid, but they\u2019re the same worries that keep me up at night,\u201d Mayor Joshua Sweeney said, per Voice of OC. \u201cBut here\u2019s the painful truth that we must face together as a community: The state of California, through Sacramento\u2019s relentless push of laws like the Housing Accountability Act,\nAB 1893\nand now\nAB 130\n, which was the final nail in the coffin, has systematically stripped away all our local control, and they have tied our hands in a way that feels profoundly unfair, leaving us in checkmate.\u201d\nBecause the concept of builder\u2019s remedy is part of California\u2019s Housing Accountability Act, cities aren\u2019t allowed to deny builder\u2019s remedy projects just because they don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a good fit for their communities or are concerned about density or parking issues. As a result, denying a builder\u2019s remedy project would open the door to lawsuits from groups including affordable housing organizations and the California attorney general.\nSweeney said the project \u201cclashes with the community\u2019s heart and soul\u201d but also believes it isn\u2019t worth it to risk being sued by denying it.\n\u201cIf we fight it outright, we\u2019d invite lawsuits from the attorney general, advocacy groups and many others, and we simply cannot risk bankrupting Laguna Hills and draining our city\u2019s funds,\u201d he said. Councilmember Dave Wheeler echoed that sentiment, calling the proposal a \u201cmonstrosity\u201d before voting to approve it.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "S3 Capital is betting big on New Jersey\u2019s Hudson River waterfront, putting up a $255 million construction loan to launch the first phase of a $1 billion Edgewater megaproject.\nThe financing will kickstart a 25-story luxury rental at 615 River Road in Edgewater, NJ, delivering 381 apartments, ground-floor retail and more than 500 parking spaces, according to S3. The Maxal Group is behind the project, its latest Hudson-front play following the 236-unit Harbor 1500 in Weehawken.\nWhen fully built, the development is slated to bring more than 1,200 units, a 2.5-acre public waterfront park and a new ferry terminal with direct service to Manhattan\u2019s West Side. That last piece is crucial: the promised 15-minute ride to Hudson Yards is the kind of transit amenity lenders say makes Edgewater more than just spillover from New York.\nDesigned by FXCollaborative with interiors from CetraRuddy, the rental project will sport a glass-and-corrugated fa\u00e7ade nodding to the Palisades, plus 25,000 square feet of amenities from golf simulator to spa. Units are geared toward professionals and families priced out of Manhattan, with layouts catering to remote work.\nFor Maxal, led by Bruce Sturman, 615 River Road is positioned as a step up in Edgewater\u2019s luxury pipeline, offering floor-to-ceiling glass with skyline views and proximity to retail heavyweights like Whole Foods and Trader Joe\u2019s.\n\nGalaxy Capital brokered the financing.\nEdgewater\u2019s planning board\napproved the project\nin 2021. The developers had been entangled in a legal battle involving the project\u2019s affordable housing since July 2015, leading to a settlement two years later.\nS3, one of the nation\u2019s most active private lenders, framed the deal as part of a strategy to back \u201ctransit-oriented residential developments adjacent to major city centers.\u201d\nS3\u2019s Steven Jemal, who led the financing, said the project\u2019s ferry terminal would be a \u201clasting value\u201d for the town, while S3 co-founder Robert Schwartz cast it as another example of the firm\u2019s ability to underwrite and deploy capital quickly.\n",

They\npaid $44 million\nfor the 8,713-square-foot home at 9501 Journeys End Lane and\n$34 million\nfor the 12,829-square-foot mansion at 9475 Journeys End Road.\nThe properties total just over four acres in the gated Coral Gables community.\nForgotten Fountain LLC submitted an application to the city for variances that will allow a boatlift to extend 54 feet and two inches, more than twice as far as currently allowed;\u00a0 as well as a variance to allow mooring piles to be set 67 feet and four inches, nearly three times as far out from the banks of the waterways. The city\u2019s board of adjustment will review the variance requests at its meeting on Monday. The board of architects approved the requests in July.\nThe existing dock will remain, according to the application. The boatlift and mooring piles can\u2019t be located closer to the shoreline because of the mangrove trees, a protected plant.\n\nThe application includes an approval from the Journey\u2019s End Homeowners Association, signed by president Louis Wolfson III.\nBezos\u2019 mother, Jackie, died in August at the age of 78.

        "content": "A Market Street office building has sold for less than half of its pre-pandemic value.\nFountainhead Development swooped in to buy the historic 800 Market Street building, dubbed by locals as the \u201cFlatiron Building,\u201d for $17.2 million, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. The seller was\nInvesco\n, which acquired the property in 2011 for $51 million, putting the current deal\u00a0 at a 60 percent drop in value.\nThe sale price comes to about $354 per square foot, compared with $1,100 or so more than a decade ago,\naccording\nto the San Francisco Business Times. The transaction marks the second San Francisco deal for Fairbanks, Alaska-based Fountainhead after buying 795 Folsom Street last year for $48.3 million.\nThe building is across the street from\nSan Francisco Centre\n, the beleaguered mall that has been bleeding tenants since falling into loan default two years ago. The bargain-basement sale price aligns with\nrecent Yardi Research data\nclaiming 67 percent of offices in San Francisco have sold for less than their previous values in the past two years.\nFashion brand Diesel had a 10,000-square-foot flagship on the ground floor of the 800 Market Street building, but it closed its doors in 2021. Prior to that, in 2018, the building housed the first location of\nWeWork\u2019s \u201cHQ by WeWork\u201d\nprogram, which offered standalone private offices for mid-sized companies. WeWork ended up moving to terminate its lease commitments at several downtown San Francisco, including at 800 Market, by 2023.\n\nNew owner Fountainhead plans a long-term \u201cpublic-facing\u201d activation for the ground-floor retail space, according to the Business Times.\n\u201cWe love this building \u2014 frankly, it\u2019s one of the most unique office buildings that I\u2019ve been in,\u201d Wyatt Cerny, Fountainhead\u2019s vice president of real estate, told the Chronicle. Under previous ownership, the structure underwent an \u201cextensive renovation\u201d more than a decade ago that \u201cbrought it up to modern standards.\n\u201cIt\u2019s got the flatiron shape. You go in and there are creative offices that have perfect floor plate sizes \u2014 5,600 square feet,\u201d Cerny said.\nThe goal is to revive the intersection of Market, Ellis and Stockton Streets.\nForever 21\nclosed its flagship at 2 Stockton Street in 2019 with the three-story property still vacant today; Disney followed in 2021 by departing 39 Stockton Street. \u201cWe want to bring life and energy back to that corner,\u201d Cerny said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The first was completed in 2021, while the latter was completed last year. They are each 14 stories tall and house a similar unit count. Amenities include an indoor swimming pool, outdoor patio with a grilling area, hot tub, sauna, locker rooms, fitness center with track, indoor basketball court, children\u2019s playroom as well as movie screening room.\nThe property is located at 601-607 Ridge Hill Boulevard, less than 20 miles away from Midtown Manhattan.\nThere\u2019s more to come, too: Azorim North America\u2019s Chief Operating Officer Jack Klein said work recently began on a third building, which will feature 174 units and is expected to be completed in the next 18 months.\n\nA Walker &amp; Dunlop team of Jonathan Zilber and Joel Chetner arranged the financing.\nAzorim North America is a subsidiary of Azorim, a development firm based in Israel. The firm also has a 250-unit transit-oriented development on Hudson Street in Yonkers, one of New York\u2019s largest cities outside of the Big Apple itself.\nAzorim North America has its next Yonkers project up its sleeve: a 672-unit development at 143 Woodworth Avenue that\u2019s a short walk from the Metro North station, similar to another complex at Hudson Street in which the developer provides a shuttle to the train at the Ridge Hill complex.\nThe multifamily development market in Westchester County has been booming in recent years, but developers are becoming\nincreasingly concerned\nabout the influx of units, fearful of competition and the need for concessions.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A Chicago developer is testing how far Fulton Market\u2019s housing boom can stretch.\nLG Group\nfiled plans with the city for a five-story, 66-unit residential building at 1201-19 West Kinzie Street, on the northwestern edge of the fast-growing district. The project, which needs Chicago City Council approval, would total 65,000 square feet with a mix of studios through four-bedrooms, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Twenty percent of the units would be set aside as affordable under city rules. The plans don\u2019t specify whether the building would be apartments or condos.\nThe site belongs to Sterling Bay, which has been slimming down its portfolio while sorting through financial strain tied to Lincoln Yards, once planned as a $6 billion megadevelopment. The developer recently sold off a site at\n350 North Morgan Street\n, where it had zoning for a 39-story tower, and it is marketing others in and around Fulton Market. CBRE has been shopping the Kinzie parcel for over a year, along with two nearby sites, and a marketing brochure now lists it as under contract. A Sterling Bay spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nIf it lands approvals, LG\u2019s project would be one of several mid-rises just outside Fulton Market\u2019s traditional borders. Other proposals in the area include a seven-story, 79-unit building at 450 North Morgan Street and a 72-unit complex at\n455 North Carpenter Street\n. Developers have already packed Fulton Market proper with a wave of towers and mid-rises, and the spillover to its northern and western edges signals that momentum isn\u2019t slowing.\nLG\nis already a familiar player in the neighborhood. The firm delivered a 368-unit high-rise at 210 North Aberdeen Street this spring, and a 166-unit building on West Jackson Boulevard in the West Loop. It also has towers on deck at 1143 and 1150 West Lake Street.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Texas City won\u2019t be getting a Sports Illustrated Resort after all.\nSports Hospitality Ventures, the licensee behind the SI-branded resorts, abandoned plans to bring one of the brand\u2019s first U.S. locations to the Lago Mar Crystal Lagoon, a source familiar with the project\ntold\nthe Houston Business Journal.\nThe company announced the development in January 2024, pitching a 200-room, six-story resort on the southeast side of the 12-acre manmade lagoon. Plans called for a restaurant, beach club, cabanas and a swim-up island bar.\nThe project was to be designed by Houston-based Project Luong and managed by Grand Prairie-based American Resort Management, in partnership with Travel + Leisure. Groundbreaking was expected in the third quarter of last year but never materialized.\nAccording to the source, Sports Hospitality Ventures cut off communications with Houston-based Land Tejas, developer of the 2,033-acre master-planned\nLago Mar\ncommunity, sometime last year.\nCity records back that up: Texas City engineer Kim Golden said this spring that the city hadn\u2019t received any applications for a resort at the site. Zoning allows for either a hotel or townhomes.\n\nSports Illustrated Resorts\n, launched in 2023 through a partnership with Sports Hospitality Ventures, licenses its brand from Authentic Brands Group, which owns the magazine\u2019s intellectual property.\nThe resort was supposed to anchor a planned $100 million entertainment district around the lagoon, which already includes a public beach attraction called Lagoonfest Texas and resident-only areas. The broader plan envisioned a boardwalk with retail, dining and condos. Houston-based\nWan Bridge\ndelivered a 151-unit townhome project called Crystal View at Lago Mar last year, but the resort piece never got off the ground.\nTexas City isn\u2019t an isolated case for the Sports Illustrated Resorts venture. A resort announced for Tuscaloosa, Alabama, lost its hotel component, according to the Tuscaloosa News. A proposed project in Mississippi was put on hold pending lower interest rates, while another in Ann Arbor, Michigan, was scrapped altogether after pushback from city officials and residents. Even a previously touted Orlando resort has disappeared from the brand\u2019s website.\nThe only operating SI Resort is in the Dominican Republic and opened in 2022. Two more \u2014 in\nChicago and Nashville\n\u2014 are listed as \u201ccoming soon\u201d on the brand\u2019s site. The Chicago launch is set to occupy Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Hotel Chicago site.\nMeanwhile, The Lagoon Development Company is expanding across Greater Houston with its signature turquoise pools, powered by Crystal Lagoons\u2019 water treatment technology. Lagoons in Dayton, Magnolia and Katy are in various stages of opening or construction, with more tied to entertainment districts.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Business First\nreported\n. Port officials are seeking proposals for the new terminal, dubbed Pier 500.\nThe facility, along with the neighboring Port of Long Beach, is among the busiest in the U.S. and world, and often cited as a linchpin in a logistics chain that has kept Southern California\u2019s industrial real estate sector a hot spot for decades.\nPier 500 is envisioned as a 200-acre site along the port\u2019s Pier 400 Channel. Once complete, it would bring two new berths and approximately 3,000 feet of new available wharf space to the southern end of Terminal Island at the port. In doing so, the new terminal would increase cargo efficiency at the port by accommodating larger, newer cargo ships.\nThe proposed Pier 500 project would utilize an existing site where the port identified 124 acres of submerged infrastructure added during the construction of the adjacent Pier 400 more than 20 years ago. Overall, it\u2019s expected it will take about 10 years from pre-development to operation.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in a generation, the Port of Los Angeles plans to build a new container terminal to meet global supply chain demand for decades into the future,\u201d Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles,\nsaid\nin a statement.\nOnce the port selects an applicant through its request for proposals, officials will work with them in a public-private pre-development agreement. After that, they would determine the project\u2019s financial feasibility, followed by procuring entitlements and tying up any other loose ends needed to begin construction.\nThe announcement comes after the port saw its busiest month on record in July. That month, the Port handled 1,019,837 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), marking an 8.5 percent increase from the previous July. With the threat of higher tariffs later this year looming, retailers and manufacturers imported goods ahead of time in anticipation of those hikes.\n\u201cShippers have been frontloading their cargo for months to get ahead of tariffs and recent activity at America\u2019s top port really tells that story,\u201d Seroka\nsaid\nat the time. \u201cPort terminals in July were jam-packed with ships loaded with cargo, processed without any delay.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The 5.6-acre property is in the Coral Terrace neighborhood.\nDanny Finkle and Jorge Portela led the JLL team that represented the seller.\nRed Bird Associates is managed by Stephen Brandon of Miami-Dade-based The Brandon Company and Mark Morgan of Overland Park, Kansas-based MD Management, state corporate records show.\nRed Bird Center is fully leased, the release says. Tenants include Ace Hardware, Space Coast Credit Union, Quest Diagnostics, AT&amp;T, as well as an animal clinic, pizzeria and eye care office. The property includes an Orion Fuels gas station.\nBrandon Company, led by President Jeff Brandon, is a commercial real estate development firm founded in 1974, its website says.

Asana had bought the properties for\n$18.5 million\nin 2018 from Johnstone Capital Partners, which had repurposed the warehouses.\nIn Fort Lauderdale\u2019s Flagler Village, Asana bought the retail properties at 723-737 Northeast Second Avenue and 900-924 North Flagler Drive for\n$18.3 million\n, as well as the office and industrial building at 707 Northeast Third Avenue for\n$10 million\nin 2022.\nAsana declined to comment on whether it has a redevelopment plan for Red Bird Center.\nSouth Florida\u2019s\nretail\nmarket began to calm earlier this year amid higher interest rates and slower influx of out-of-staters. In the second quarter, vacancies increased in each of the three counties and the average asking rent dropped in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, according to a\nColliers report\n.\nGrocery-anchored\nshopping centers have remained\nresilient\nwith continued investment sales. In June, Barry Sternlicht\u2019s Starwood Capital Group sold the Whole Foods-anchored Marketplace at the Outlets shopping center at 1821 Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard in West Palm Beach for\n$133.2 million\n. Longpoint paid\n$34 million\nin July for the Presidente Supermarket-anchored Miramar Parkway Plaza at 3176 South University Drive in Miramar.\nIn other recent shopping center deals, JBL Asset Management bought Palm Square at 9941 Pines Boulevard in Pembroke Pines for\n$25 million\n.\n",

        "content": "Electronic document signature company Docusign is preparing to sign a notable deal of its own.\nDocusign is in talks to lease an additional two floors at its 221 Main Street headquarters in San Francisco, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. It would give Docusign about 50,000 square feet of additional office space on top of its existing 93,000-square-foot headquarters at the building.\nThe company is also planning to extend its original lease at the building. Its existing lease expires July 31, 2029, according to the Business Times. The deal has reportedly been in the works for months, though it has not yet been finalized.\nWith the new expansion, Docusign will bring its headquarters footprint closer to its pre-pandemic square footage. In the 2021 fiscal year, the firm grew its headquarters from approximately 150,000 square feet to 211,000 square feet. But the following year, it shrunk back down to 150,000 square feet. It\nrenewed its lease\nat 221 Main Street in the 2023 fiscal year, albeit in a smaller footprint at 93,000 square feet.\n\nThe 221 Main Street building is owned by\nPIMCO\nPrime Real Estate and managed by subsidiary Columbia Property Trust. Last month, news surfaced that fintech company Affirm was approaching a\ndeal to move its headquarters\ninto 47,000 square feet across two floors at the approximately 389,000-square-foot building. Late last year, math-focused private school Proof School inked a deal for 35,000 square feet on the building\u2019s first and second floors.\nAs of January of this year, Docusign has 850 employees in San Francisco and 6,838 workers overall, according to the Business Times. By that metric, the company is the 19th-largest tech employer in the city.\nDocusign is currently hiring for several dozen positions with a hybrid work model, according to the Business Times. As companies across the Bay Area implement a post-pandemic\nreturn to the office\n, Docusign is among the firms that are having to grow their offices once again to accommodate more workers. Okta, for example, recently took back two floors at its 100 First Street headquarters that it previously looked to sublease to another tenant.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Spooky season is in full swing in the Alamo City, where the state of the\nmultifamily market has scared off developers\n.\nSan Antonio posted the largest percent decline in new multifamily permits of cities nationwide, according to a HomeAbroad analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. The report looked at the period between 2020 and 2025.\nThe city saw 526 multifamily construction permits filed in 2020, and just 18 filed so far this year, a 96.6 percent decline. The pipeline collapsed even though San Antonio continues is experiencing rapid growth,\nranking fourth in the nation\nin terms of new residents. Nearly 24,000 people moved to San Antonio between 2023 and 2024.\nIn the last five years, Austin saw a 29 percent drop in new permits (from 1,868 to 1,321) and permits fell 14 percent in Houston (from 1,669 to 1,409). Dallas-Fort Worth bucked the trend, with permits jumping nearly 20 percent (from 4,847 to 5,800).\nA rush of apartment construction in Texas over the last few years has resulted in a glut of new product coming online. As a result,\noccupancy and rent rates have declined\nin the major Texas metros.\n\nSan Antonio ranks\nsecond in the country for rental affordability\n, with renters spending an average of 17 percent of their income on housing, JLL\u2019s Kai Penn said during a Connect CRE conference on the multifamily market in the Lone Star State.\nHalfway through the year, average occupancy was 93.2 percent, and average asking rent was $1,237 per month in San Antonio, according to a report from Newmark. The drastic contraction of the multifamily development pipeline will increase these levels.\nEven though the pipeline has dried up, San Antonio is still in need of additional housing. The metro is underbuilt by more than 25,000 housing units, according to a 2024 report by the housing advocacy organization Up for Growth.\nDallas-Fort Worth\u2019s housing shortage is nearly five times higher, with the Metroplex still underbuilt by 122,000 units. Houston is short 79,000 units, and Austin is short 24,000 units.\n",

The purchase breaks down to $461,111 per apartment.\nThe buyer borrowed a $78.4 million Fannie Mae loan for the purchase. The loan matures in 2030.\nRobert Given and Zach Sackley were part of the CBRE team that represented the seller.\nCompleted in 2018 and 2019, Bell at Broken Sound consists of 22 three-story apartment buildings and a pair of clubhouses on a 14.4-acre site, according to a Tishman Speyer news release and Vizzda records. It has one-bedroom to three-bedroom units, with monthly rents ranging from $2,279 to $4,390, the property\u2019s website shows.\nThe units break down to 180 apartments and 90 townhouses, the release says.\nTishman Speyer plans amenity, technology and interior improvements, according to the release.\n\nThe complex is within\nThe Park at Broken Sound\n, a 700-acre mixed-use development with offices, apartments and light industrial space.\nBell Partners, led by Lili F. Dunn, had paid $94.3 million for Bell at Broken Sound Apartments in 2020, records show.\nLed by Rob Speyer,\nTishman Speyer\nhas been slowly beefing up its South Florida real estate investments over the past year. Last year, it paid\n$100.2 million\nfor the two-warehouse Rock Lake Business Center at 3150-3250 Northwest 33rd Street in Pompano Beach, marking its first known industrial investment in Florida. It was the\nfifth biggest\nindustrial deal last year in South Florida.\nFounded in 1978 by Jerry Speyer and the late Robert Tishman, Tishman Speyer has purchased and developed about 34,000 apartments and condos in the U.S., Brazil, China and Europe, the release says.\nSouth Florida\u2019s\nmultifamily market\nis experiencing an uptick in investment sales in recent months after a calming over the past two years due to elevated interest rates and a slowdown of the influx of out-of-staters. During the pandemic, the tri-county region\u2019s market was supercharged by unprecedented demand from newcomers and record rent growth.\nIn Palm Beach County, multifamily investment sales totaled $3.9 billion in 2021 and $1.8 billion in 2022, according to data provided by Avison Young. Activity dropped to $668 million in 2023 and $1 billion last year. Palm Beach County investment sales totaled $120 million during the first half of this year, the Avison data shows.\nBuyers still purchasing apartments generally are relying on discretionary funds that have to deploy their capital, or are borrowing Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae loans, or obtaining loans from insurers, which usually have better terms than bank financing. Some are all-cash buyers, such as Spain\u2019s richest person, Amancio Ortega, who paid\n$165 million\nin June for the 259-unit Veneto Las Olas apartment tower at 201 South Federal Highway in downtown Fort Lauderdale.\nLast month, Legacy Residential Group paid\n$77 million\nfor the 416-unit Legacy at Coconut Creek complex at 4303 West Atlantic Boulevard in Coconut Creek. This month, AEW Capital Management and Mast Capital sold the 342-unit Remi on the River building at\u00a0 999 Northwest Seventh Street in Miami for\n$108.4 million\n. Buyer Valeris Capital borrowed $72.3 million from The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company.",

The two-building complex at 7025 and 7175 Southwest 59th Avenue (formerly 5949 Southwest 72nd Street) in South Miami is adjacent to the South Miami Metrorail station and Underline Park.\nThe complex totals 262 units with 726 beds, as well as pools, fitness facilities and study lounges, and 15,700 square feet of retail. Units span one to four bedrooms. Treo completed the first VOX building with 99 units and 326 beds in 2021. Last year, the firm\nlanded $53 million\nin construction financing from FirstBank Florida and Abanca for its second phase. Phase two was completed in August, and the buildings are now fully leased, a spokesperson confirmed.\n\nVOX\u2019s website shows rents for a one-bedroom unit start at $2,899 for the school year starting in August 2026.\nMiami-based Treo is led by Otto Boudet-Murias, Rolando Delgado, Eduardo Garcia and Carlos Ortega. Treo is leasing the 6.2-acre development site from Miami-Dade County. It launched the project in 2020 with an initial\n$33.25 million construction loan\nfrom Centennial Bank.\nStudent housing\nhas emerged as a favorite asset class among real estate investors for its strong rent growth, stable demand and perceived recession resistance. Buildings are rented on a per-bed basis rather than per-unit. Last year, Chicago-based Harrison Street Capital Partners closed a\n$2.5 billion investment fund\nfor student housing, senior housing and data centers.\nBlackstone\nlanded a $1 billion refinancing deal for part of its student housing portfolio last year.\nIn South Florida, hundreds of units are in the pipeline for projects that target University of Miami students. Capstone Collegiate Communities and Alta Development are partnering on a\n16-story, 189-unit luxury student housing project\n, which is set to open in 2028.",

        "content": "The City of Beverly Hills will consider greenlighting two builder\u2019s remedy projects from a local family-owned property management and development firm.\nAflalo Equities\u2019 proposal for two eight-story residential buildings will go before the city planning commission next week. Plans call for a 135-unit building at 353 South Beverly Drive, and a 105-unit building at 9467 Olympic Boulevard, to replace a\nPavilions\ngrocery store.\nThe projects were filed under the builder\u2019s remedy, a loophole in state housing law that lets developers skirt zoning rules in cities that fail to certify their state housing plans, as long as they include at least 20 percent affordable housing.\nThe development could also skirt environmental rules.\nThe planning commission will also consider finding the project exempt from further review under\nCalifornia Environmental Quality Act\n, aka CEQA, enacted in 1970 to balance environmental protection and development though developers often find it slows or stops development.\nSammy Aflalo of Aflalo Equities is helming the two Beverly Hills projects. Aflalo is the son of Moshe and Laura Aflalo, whose\nAflalo Family Trust\ngrew a portfolio of stores in L.A.\u2019s Garment District in the 1990s. The sites are\nco-owned\nwith Harkham Family Enterprises, run by Uri Harkham.\n\nArchitectural plans from Los Angeles-based Ottinger Architects for 333-353 South Beverly call for an 85-foot building with 135 units. The project would span 202,570 square feet with homes ranging from one- to three-bedrooms. Twenty-seven of them would be earmarked for low-income households. The communal roofdeck will include a pool and spa, fire pit as well as outdoor cooking and sitting areas.\nThe Olympic Boulevard building would span 282,620 square feet, per Ottinger Architects plans, with one- to three-bedrooms and a roof deck and gym. Twenty-one units would be set aside for low-income tenants.\nNext week\u2019s Planning Commission\u2019s public hearing will be the first time the commission is considering the projects, according to Michael Forbes, director of community development for the city. The commission will then deliberate on the project and vote to approve or deny the project, likely at the same meeting, he said.\nSeparately, Aflalo Equities, in a joint venture with Fisch Property, the property management arm of the family business, is\nplanning\ntwo 10-story buildings \u2014 one at\n9430 Olympic Boulevard\nand the other at 9441 West Olympic Boulevard, with 45 units and 63 units, respectively. The former would replace a three-story office building, while the latter would replace a two-story office building, per the preliminary applications.\nIn addition, at 8822-8826 West Olympic Boulevard, Aflalo Equities plans to replace a single-story commercial building with a nine-story 30-unit building.\n",

        "content": "Three skyscrapers in downtown Los Angeles designed to house the homeless could end up costing federal taxpayers more than $1 billion.\nHomeless services nonprofit Weingart Center Association is behind the three towers, which would utilize federal Section 8 Housing vouchers to repay the state and city and to fund private developer fees and investor returns over the buildings\u2019 55-year life, The Center Square\nreported\n.\n\u201cTaxpayers are being forced to foot the bill for over $800,000 per unit for homeless housing,\u201d Susan Shelley, vice president of communications for the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, told The Center Square. \u201cThere should be an audit to determine if this is genuinely the best option to provide housing or if this is just making a lot of people rich off the taxpayers\u2019 dime.\u201d\nWeingart opened a 19-story, 278-unit tower in Skid Row last year. The project cost $167.7 million, or more than $600,000 per unit. The tower was funded with $32 million of the city\u2019s homeless housing bond, a $1.8 million land loan from the City of Los Angeles, $48.7 million in deferrable loans from the California Department of Housing and Community Development, $56.9 million in tax credit equity and $85.3 million in tax-exempt bonds. Developer Chelsea Investment Corporation, meanwhile, earned $18.3 million in development fees.\nThis summer, Weingart opened a second tower that cost $171 million for 298 units. That project,\ndeveloped by Related Companies\n, is estimated to be in line to generate $534 million in federal voucher revenue over its lifespan. A third tower containing 104 units is now in the planning phase with a $865,656-per-unit price tag, or $90 million total; at that figure, it costs more to build one of these units than to pay the median price for an entire home in the state. Related is set to collect $10.4 million in fees on that project.\nThe dependence on government financing and high costs per unit of the recent developments come a sPrivate-sector construction of market-rate housing in Los Angeles has fallen in recent years.\u00a0 Permitting approvals for government-regulated affordable housing climbed to 60 percent in fiscal year 2023-2024 from 24 percent in the previous four years, according to The Center Square.\nMany real estate insiders\nblame Measure ULA\n, which charges a transfer tax on big-ticket property sales. A recent report from UCLA bears out that finding, noting that the transfer taxes can be linked to notable declines in housing production and property tax revenue growth, per The Center Square.\n\nGuests at\nThe Real Deal\u2019s Building Back L.A. roundtable\nlast month echoed that sentiment with real-life anecdotes.\n\u201cBuyers and sellers are absolutely disgruntled over ULA, and it is not going away. It\u2019s actually getting worse every day,\u201d\nAaron Kirman\n, CEO of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California, said. \u201cWhen you are doing these deals and sellers can be charged anywhere between 4.5 and 5 percent additional fees on top of commissions and closing costs and everything else, it\u2019s make it or break it for a lot of these developers, not only on the luxury level, but for apartments, for retail, and everything in the middle.\u201d\n\u201cIt really has probably stopped 50 percent of the deals, maybe even more,\u201d Kirman added.\n\u201cWe have developers that would love to develop in L.A., that do develop in L.A., that are just saying until ULA gets off the books or changed substantially they\u2019re not going to do it,\u201d\nSean Burton\n, chairman and CEO of Cityview, also noted.\nThe Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association is working on accomplishing just that. The group is a proponent for a new initiative called the Local Taxpayer Protection Act to Save Proposition 13, which would repeal Measure ULA and similar transfer taxes. The proposal, which is collecting signatures until next February, would restore the prior maximum transfer tax of 0.11 percent.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The investor said\u00a0 that it has secured a new investor and is in talks with RBC about recapitalizing the portfolio and restructuring the loan, though the partner\u2019s identity hasn\u2019t been revealed.\nVeritas has earlier painted a picture of business as usual against the backdrop of financial machinations.\n\u201cThe notices sent out by the lender are a normal part of this legal process and were sent with the ownership\u2019s understanding, as communication remains cordial and transparent,\u201d a spokesperson for Veritas told\nThe Real Deal\nthis week. \u201cThere is no impact to residents\u2019 leases, building services, or the dedicated staff serving these communities.\u201d\n\nThe outstanding debt on the 1,500-unit portfolio has purportedly ballooned to more than $650 million, Mission Local\nreported\n. As it stands, Veritas would have about three months to pay back the loan, or RBC can proceed with pursuing foreclosure.\nAccording to the Business Times, Veritas\u2019 former capital partners seemingly abandoned the portfolio around the time the loan matured last year. Canadian pension fund La Caisse, formerly known as Ivanhoe Cambridge, and Canadian pension investor PSP Investments are reportedly the former capital partners, per the Business Times.\nBetween 2015 and 2017, Veritas and its partners dropped $612 million to buy the 66 buildings that make up the 1,500-unit portfolio in question, according to the Business Times. The entities refinanced the properties in March 2022 with the $570 million loan from RBC.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Richardson is hanging onto one of its biggest corporate anchors with a little help from City Hall.\n1Finity, a subsidiary of Japanese IT giant Fujitsu, will relocate its North American headquarters to 65,000 square feet in Galatyn Commons Office Park. The move keeps the firm in Richardson, where it\u2019s been based since 2008, and consolidates its Richardson and Dallas offices, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The company signed a 12-year lease at 2380 Performance Drive and plans to invest at least $13 million in tenant improvements for about 500 employees.\nCity officials made sure the deal stayed local. Richardson\u2019s City Council approved a $2.3 million retention and expansion grant last year, along with $130,000 in waived permit fees, to beat out at least two other cities that tried to lure the headquarters away.\n\u201cFujitsu has been in our community for nearly four decades now, so it was really meaningful as they evolved into 1Finity for us to keep them,\u201d City Manager Don Magner said.\nThe lease lands 1Finity in one of the city\u2019s premier office hubs. Galatyn Commons spans 800,000 square feet across four buildings, with amenities including a food hall, amphitheater and conference center.\n\nThe park has been steadily filling with high-profile tenants: Halff moved its headquarters there last year with an 80,000-square-foot lease backed by its own incentives deal, while CBRE planted a 131,000-square-foot office in 2022. Insurance giant\nGeico\nsigned a 165,000-square-foot lease in Galatyn Commons at 2375 North Glenville Drive earlier this year.\n1Finity, formerly\nFujitsu\nNetwork Communications, specializes in information and communication technology.

The pending price isn\u2019t finalized, but the firm reportedly offered more than $130 million for the 747,500-square-foot tower at the Chicago River. That\u2019s $174 per square foot and a steep drop from the $360 million Chicago-based Walton Street Capital paid in 2017, though not as brutal a discount as other downtown fire sales.\nReal Capital\nshifted its plans, as it had the 40-story tower at\n190 South LaSalle\nunder contract earlier this summer before backing out. The firm is planning to deploy $3.5 billion into distressed office purchases nationwide over the next three years. Its affiliates recently scooped up heavily marked-down buildings in\nDallas\nand Washington, D.C., betting that values will rebound as the post-pandemic\noffice slump\nlevels off.\nHigh interest rates and lingering skepticism about the commercial property sector have kept transactions scarce, while many downtown towers are still encumbered by debt that exceeds valuations.\n\nIn fact, 401 North Michigan itself was previously the subject of a broken deal. The\nSaudi Arabian enterprise Olayan Group\nlate last year was in talks to acquire the building at a similar discount as Real Capital, but a purchase never moved forward.\nWalton Street refinanced the property in 2019 with a $160 million loan from the firm ING, and the debt\u2019s maturity date has been repeatedly extended. A sale at north of $175 a foot would not only wipe out the seller\u2019s equity but also leave the lender exposed. ING has signaled willingness to stay involved with the property and finance up to 60 percent of a buyer\u2019s purchase.\nLeasing metrics at 401 North Michigan are stronger than the downtown average, with the tower 88 percent occupied versus the 72 percent norm. However, near-term moveouts could drive that down to 76 percent. A long-term lease with the American Dental Association, which runs through 2040, and a weighted average lease term of more than seven years provide ballast that brokers at JLL are highlighting to prospective buyers.\n\u2014 Rachel Stone\n",

That\u2019s more than double its pre-pandemic level, according to CBRE. Vacancy has increased for 13 straight quarters, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Companies have shed 2.3 million square feet downtown over the past two years \u2014 almost twice the space lost during the Great Recession \u2014 leaving landlords and lenders to grapple with a prolonged downturn.\nThat weakness has chilled the investment sales market, where institutional buyers have largely stayed on the sidelines. Property tax revenue from downtown office buildings \u2014 a critical source for the city \u2014 has also eroded, raising the stakes for a recovery.\nBut the market split is widening. Vacancy at older, second-tier Class B properties ballooned to nearly 35 percent in the third quarter, while Class A vacancy landed at 21.4 percent.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tale of two markets,\u201d CBRE\u2019s Todd Lippman told the outlet, noting that top-tier towers with lots of perks and amenities are drawing steady demand while commodity space languishes.\nThat demand has fueled rent growth for trophy assets even as broader asking rents have barely budged. Colliers data shows average gross rents across downtown offices have ticked up just 1 percent since 2020, while rents at the newest glass-and-steel towers have surged 26 percent. Recent deals illustrate the trend: law firm\nKilpatrick Townsend\nsigned on for a floor at BMO Tower on Canal Street, consolidating from multiple Loop offices, while private equity shop\nWind Point Partners\nis set to sublease space at Salesforce Tower.\n\nOverall absorption was negative last quarter, with tenants vacating 51,000 more square feet than they leased. Evolent Health\u2019s exit from nearly 124,000 square feet at\n300 South Riverside Plaza\nwas the biggest hit, outweighing expansions by JPMorgan Chase and Adyen. CBRE expects net absorption to stay flat as more leases roll and tenants reassess footprints.\nLaw firms may offer a glimmer of stability. Lippman noted that most are no longer aggressively cutting space, and some are even growing, unlike the contraction cycle that reshaped the sector a decade ago.\nInvestment sales are scarce, though some local and opportunistic players are wading in. Blue Star Properties paid $28 million for\n2 North Riverside Plaza\n\u2014 the historic former home of the Chicago Daily News \u2014 earlier this summer, while 601W is under contract to buy the distressed\n175 West Jackson\n.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "On Sunday, the leader of New York City pulled the plug on his reelection campaign.\nAfter months of speculations \u2014 and years of scandals \u2014 Eric Adams\nofficially dropped his bid\nto come back as mayor of New York City.\nEven as Adams resisted pressure to abandon the race, his departure felt inevitable as he struggled to keep up in the polls with three other candidates. A coalescing around a candidate to compete with Zohran Mamdani has long been a clarion call among watchers.\nAdams still has a few months left at Gracie Mansion, but The Real Deal columnist Erik Engquist evaluated the\nreal estate legacy\nthe 110th mayor will leave.\nWhile Adams was dropping out of the race, the New York Mets were putting the final nail in the coffin of a collapse that left the team out of the MLB playoffs. But this week wasn\u2019t all bad for owner Steve Cohen.\nHis plan for an $8 billion casino complex is\nheading to the final round\nof the state\u2019s casino licensing competition after a community advisory committee voted unanimously to advance Metropolitan Park, a project that would transform 50 acres of parking lots next to Citi Field.\nThat leaves a list of four contenders for three downstate gaming licenses: MGM Empire City in Yonkers; Queens Aqueduct Casino, operated by Resorts World; and Bally\u2019s in Throggs Neck.\nMost expect the state to grant MGM and Resorts World two of the licenses because they both already operate as racinos. That would leave Bally\u2019s and Metropolitan Park proposals competing against each other for the last license.\n\nOn the legal front, Meyer Chetrit was\ncriminally indicted\nin Manhattan for harassing rent-regulated tenants in Chelsea, accused of waging a five-year campaign of harassment against two septuagenarians to force them out of their building.\nCharges include two counts of harassment of a rent-regulated tenant in the first degree, a class E felony carrying a maximum sentence of four years in prison.\nGet excited, connoisseurs of Swedish meatballs. An entity connected to Ikea\npurchased 529 Broadway\nin Soho from Jeff Sutton for $213 million. It\u2019s a 58,000-square-foot commercial building occupied by Nike.\nThe investment group is planning to open an Ikea location across the first and second floors, totaling 25,000 square feet.\nAlso, of interest this week, the developers behind the iconic Flatiron Building\u2019s conversion have\nunveiled\nthe project\u2019s initial pricing, where the projected sellout is $375 million for 18 of its 35 residential units.\nPrices for the available units start just under $11 million; the two most expensive condos are asking $48 million and $50 million.\nThe Brodsky Organization and Sorgente Group are the developers, while Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group is handling sales, which appear to have begun.\n",

        "content": "New York City agents, cross your fingers, knock on wood and say a prayer because the residential market might be headed for a solid end to the year.\nThough typically one of the weakest periods, macroeconomic factors \u2014 namely\nlower mortgage rates\n\u2014 could prove fertile ground for a number of deals, particularly at the lower end of the market, said appraiser and data expert Jonathan Miller.\nMetrics from last quarter\nmight, at first glance, cast doubt on that theory. Though sales were up overall, the borough logged more activity at the higher end of the market, where buyers are less sensitive to mortgage rates and can often close deals in cash, Miller\u2019s report showed.\nDuring the period, co-op and condo sales backed by financing actually fell 9 percent year-over-year and accounted for only 35 percent of all deals for the property type.\nHowever, Miller cautioned that the effect of a lower mortgage rate environment isn\u2019t yet reflected in the data.\n\u201cMuch of that drop in rates started a third or almost halfway into the quarter,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the full impact. That\u2019ll spill over into and have more of an impact on sales next quarter.\u201d\nBut Miller\u2019s optimistic forecast comes with a big if. It hinges, in part, on mortgage rates falling further or holding steady at their current levels, which may or may not happen even if the central bank\nvotes to lower\nthe federal funds rate again.\nAn early look at deals likely to close next quarter does show signs of life, according to Miller\u2019s monthly report.\nNew signed contracts in September rose modestly in Manhattan, up 1 percent from year-ago numbers. New listings hitting the market notched more significant growth, up more than 7 percent annually \u2014 an increase Miller attributed to sellers gaining confidence in a more affordable marketplace.\nThe story was similar in Brooklyn, where new signed contracts rose by 6 percent and new listings 7 percent.\nHowever, much of the growth in each borough was still fueled by the luxury market, defined in Manhattan as deals above $4 million and above $2 million in Brooklyn.\nBut if mortgage rates continue on the current trend, that balance could shift in October.\nNot so fast\u2026\n\nAn Upper East Side couple is chasing a dream few in Manhattan achieve \u2014 a private pool. The rarified amenity isn\u2019t coming easy.\nHedge funder Zachary Kurz and his wife, Brittany Morgan, whose family owns Morgan Properties, are renovating their double-wide home on East 77th Street, which they bought two years ago for $30 million, the\nNew York Post\nreported.\nTheir plans include adding a pool to the basement, a pursuit their neighbors, an ophthalmologist and former dermatologist in their 70s, are strongly opposing.\nThe couple\u2019s resistance could stand in the way of Kurz and Morgan achieving their vision, one that only a slice of New Yorkers have access to. A study\npublished in Curbed\nin 2021 found a total of roughly 15,000 private pools citywide, a tally that includes pools in condo towers, hotels and in private backyards.\nThat number may look like a lot, but considering the Big Apple has more than 8 million residents and more than 3 million housing units, it\u2019s a small piece of the pie. Even fewer of those pools are attached to single-family homes across the city. Mill Bergen Pools owner Bob Blanda estimates just 50 underground pools in townhouses in Manhattan, Blanda told the Post.\nTo build the pool, Kurz and Morgan need access to their neighbor\u2019s property, and the couple has so far refused to grant it. Kurz and Morgan sued the couple in August, hoping a court might intervene and greenlight their plans, though their neighbors have since filed a counter lawsuit.\nIn their counterclaim, the neighbors allege the construction would infringe upon their property and cause \u201cirreparable damage\u201d to their health and home.\nKurz and Morgan\u2019s \u201cdesire to have an underground swimming pool is causing\nenormous\ninconvenience to its directly adjacent neighbors,\u201d the couple\u2019s attorney wrote. \u201cWe implore your client to simply scale back its project.\u201d\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe most expensive sale recorded in the city register this week was for a Greenwich Village townhouse sold by the founder of the company, Big Ass Solutions. J. Carey Smith, his wife, Nancy Smith and their son, Tristan Smith, sold their home at 11 West 12th Street for\n$26.5 million\n.\nThe couple purchased the five-story abode for just under $20 million in 2019 and listed it for $27 million earlier this year. The 25-foot-wide townhouse spans 9,700 square feet and has five bedrooms, six bathrooms, two terraces and a garage.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Mark Fromm and Claudia Saez-Fromm had the listing. Corcoran\u2019s Dana Power brought the buyer, whose identity is shielded by an LLC.\n",

        "content": "To say the Soho/Noho rezoning has not met expectations would be an understatement.\nBut a residential project at 43 Bleecker Street might provide a template for developers eyeing the neighborhood.\nThe project, an 11-unit condo conversion of a historic six-story building by the Caedes Group, is the first to take advantage of a long-available option for developers looking to meet Mandatory Inclusionary Housing requirements.\nDevelopers have historically met those requirements by building the affordable units themselves, but projects of a certain size and unit count are eligible to pay into the Department of Housing Preservation and Development\u2019s Affordable Housing Fund.\nIt\u2019s essentially a Goldilocks situation. Projects adding fewer than 10 units and less than 12,500 square feet of residential floor area generally qualify for MIH exceptions, while projects adding over 25,000 square feet or over 25 units generally need to build the units themselves.\nBut developments adding less than 25,000 square feet of residential floor area and less than 25 units can contribute to HPD\u2019s Affordable Housing Fund, which is a pool of money for, yes, developing affordable housing.\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised that the first residential conversion to contribute to the Affordable Housing Fund is a conversion in Noho,\u201d said Vivien Krieger, a land use expert with Akerman LLP who added the housing stock in the area is \u201cripe for this.\u201d\nThe option is not cheap: The most recent contribution schedule requires developers to pay $1,130 per square foot of required affordable housing, down almost 7 percent from the previous year. (Caedes is paying almost $6 million into the fund, according to a declaration filed with the city.)\nBut for certain projects, it can be a lifeline for getting things to pencil out, according to Belkin Burden Goldman\u2019s David Shamshovich, whose firm facilitated the transaction.\n\u201cIt\u2019s prohibitively expensive if you don\u2019t have the right project in mind,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you may not actually get out of the ground and move forward with a project if this wasn\u2019t available.\u201d\nThe fund contribution also gives developers a reliable fixed cost for their project, where affordable housing \u2014 especially with talk of rent freezes on the horizon \u2014 can feel like a risky proposition, Shamshovich added. \u201cAny issues that are raised with rent stabilization will naturally affect\u201d affordable units, he said.\nAnd while it\u2019s refreshing to see a whopping 11 new units coming to Soho/Noho, the rezoning there \u201ctotally failed,\u201d according to PropertyScout CEO Wilson Parry, who shared data showing just several hundred residential units proposed for the heavily landmarked area.\nWhat\u2019s more, while using the fee-in-lieu options might spur more immediate market rate development, it doesn\u2019t do anything to address affordability in the immediate future. \u201cThe city is not getting affordable housing right away,\u201d Shamshovich said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting money.\u201d\nThe requirements around using that money are stringent. For the first 10 years after money is contributed, the city must use it in the same community district, meaning in this case, the challenges of developing affordable housing in Soho are shunted off to the public sector.\n\nAfter all is said and done, the city may end up with just a handful of expensive new condos in Soho and an unallocated pool of money. But almost five years after its rezoning and with little to show for it, something might be better than nothing.\n\u201cIt gives people the understanding we can actually do this and proceed, and our site doesn\u2019t have to be stalled,\u201d Shamshovich said. \u201cI think it gives a lot of hope, particularly in the Soho/Noho area, where MIH hasn\u2019t been very good.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: The Wall Street Journal\npointed out\nthe anomalous growth between GDP (good) and jobs (not so good), positing that we might be in the midst of an AI-driven productivity boom. Most real estate brokerages on earnings calls talk about using AI to speed up operations, but is anyone in the industry using it for something unexpected beyond synthesizing documents and writing emails? Email me at\njacob.indursky@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: For those unfortunate enough to be groundbound last weekend, there was an unmistakable whir in the air from the helicopters flying back and forth to the Ryder Cup in Farmingdale, Long Island. Somebody was kind enough to produce a\nvisual encapsulation\nof the buzzing aircraft, but the fun might not be for long. City Council in April\npassed a law\nthat might cut down on heli-trips starting in 2029. I, personally, will never get aboard one, not that I\u2019ve been invited\u2026\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 In preparation of its planned phaseout of MetroCards, the MTA will be limiting OMNY card service this weekend, Gothamist\nreported\n. From Friday at 7 p.m. to Sunday at 10 p.m., riders will be unable to purchase new OMNY cards or reload existing cards. The MTA is advising weekend straphangers to load up their cards before the Friday evening deadline.\n\u2014 New York City will be looking at buying the homes of residents in flood-prone areas, starting with the infamous Brooklyn/Queens neighborhood nicknamed \u201cThe Hole,\u201d The City\nreported\n. The effort is part of the Resilient Acquisitions program piloted by the Mayor\u2019s office, which began collecting information on Friday from residents interested in volunteering their homes for sale.\n\u2014 The Trump administration is reversing what would have been the largest federal cut to New York\u2019s police force in decades, the New York Times\nreported\n. The Department of Homeland Security had initially defunded $187 million to New York\u2019s intelligence and counterterrorism, something President Donald Trump was reportedly unaware of until receiving a call from Gov. Kathy Hochul.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nCommercial:\nNew to the Market:\nBreaking Ground:\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

The buyer was\nCeteris Investments LLC.\nThe full-floor pad measures just over 4,800 square feet; the transaction pencils out to roughly $2,60 per square foot. The Clarvits purchased the unit in 2018 for about $11 million, then put it up for sale two years ago, asking $12.9 million. Brown Harris Stevens\u2019\nBonnie Goldner, Brett Miles\nand\nPaige Neuhauser\nhad the listing.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe Garment District notched the top commercial real estate deal recorded in the Big Apple. An affiliate of\nTorchlight Investors\n, based in New York, parted with three commercial condos at\n445 Fifth Avenue\nfor $21.6 million \u2014 just over half of what the firm paid in 2023 for the units, at the time mired in a foreclosure suit. The buyer was an LLC tied to New York-based real estate firm\nStream Line Circle.\nSitting between 39th and 40th Streets, the Fifth Avenue Tower is a mixed-use building standing 33 stories tall. The commercial condos that sold span a combined 28,305 square feet, pricing them at about $760 per square foot.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nIn Carnegie Hill, a co-op at\n1175 Park Avenue\ntraded for $9.9 million. The sellers were\nRichard Hogan\nand\nCarron Sherry\n. The buyer was a trust. The transaction appears to have been off-market. A former listing shows the co-op as having five bedrooms and four full bathrooms.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nWilliam and Leslie Jacques\nparted with a condo at\n565 Broome Street\nin Hudson Square. The buyer,\nAIO NYC RE LLC\n, paid $7.5 million, about $3,300 per square foot, for the 2,200-square-foot unit. The residence has three bedrooms, three and a half baths and curved glass windows. The Jacques purchased it in 2019 for just over $7.7 million.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nFinancier\nIan Wace\nand\nGioia Bini\nscooped up a co-op that was once home to Senator Jacob Javits and his wife Marion at\n322 East 57th Street\nin Sutton Place for a hair under $6 million. The seller was film producer\nDorothy Berwin\n, who had owned the unit since 2018, when she purchased it for $4 million. The duplex has four bedrooms, a private elevator landing and a curved staircase.\nBy the Numbers:\nMortgage rates on the up and up \u2014 again\nAfter hitting a year-to-date low last month,\nmortgage rates\nare on an upward trend again.\nThe average 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage rate was 6.34 percent for the week ending Thursday, according to\nFreddieMac\u2019s latest primary mortgage market survey\n. That\u2019s up 0.04 percentage points from the week before and 0.22 percentage points from the same time last year.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

The judge determined a receiver would be determined at a later date. The decision came after two months of contentious back-and-forth between Flood and Wells Fargo.\nWells Fargo alleged that the bank was foreclosing on Trinity Flood not only because of missed loan payments but also due to the investor\u2019s failure to insure the 7500 South South Shore Drive property. But Trinity Flood hit back, stating that the lender-placed insurance plan they ended up with was significantly more expensive than a prior plan the building held and was based on \u201cinflated property values.\u201d The landlord used the ongoing dispute over the insurance plan as reason to request that a judge not grant Wells Fargo\u2019s emergency order for a receiver.\nThe same week that a judge was considering granting the emergency order for a receiver, the federal operation quickly garnered national attention. Residents in and around the building took photos and video of hundreds of government agents approaching the property, some from unmarked white vans and others from the back of rental trucks, photos show. Reporting from NewsNation, which was invited on the operation, states that agents descended from military helicopters, as well.\nWitnesses told reporters on the scene that most, if not all, of the tenants, including children and U.S. citizens, were rounded up and detained temporarily outside of the building.\nCustoms and Border Protection, the ATF and the FBI were all involved in the operation, which resulted in the arrests of 37 people, according to the Department of Homeland Security. A statement from the agency noted a preliminary review of the operation found that the 37 people arrested were undocumented and that subjects were \u201cbelieved to be involved in drug trafficking and distribution, weapons crimes, and immigration violators.\u201d\nMayor Brandon Johnson and Alderman Gregory Mitchell, who represents the area, have not issued official statements about the raid, besides a reference Johnson made to the operation during a Friday press conference. They did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\u201cThe South Side of Chicago is under siege with (President Trump\u2019s) federal agents that are terrorizing our communities, where Black families are being awakened in the middle of the night with masked armed men with high power weapons in their face,\u201d Johnson said.\nGovernor J.B. Pritzker denounced the operation on social media, sharing an article about it and writing, \u201cICE is running around Chicago harassing people for not being white. Just a year ago, that was illegal in the United States and now it\u2019s commonplace. That\u2019s not making America great again.\u201d\nBut legal documents from the foreclosure lawsuit indicate that at least some government officials were well informed that the building was facing significant turmoil.\n\n\u201cThe building is unsecured, which allows non-tenants to access the interior. There has also been increased criminal activity and shootings at the property, which is located across the street from an elementary school, and the current property manager is unable to \u2018re-assert control over the building,\u2019\u201d a legal filing from Wells Fargo stated. \u201cThe City has received reports from (a) tenants\u2019 rights group and the Alderman\u2019s office that conditions continue to worsen at the property.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear whether city officials were aware that federal officials were plotting an operation at the property ahead of time or if they were involved at all in the effort.\nTrinity Flood, attorneys for the landlord, Wells Fargo and representatives of Wells Fargo also did not respond to requests for comment.\nJohn Warren, Chair of Squatters Legislation Task Force for Chicago landlord lobbying group Neighborhood Building Owners Alliance, said he hopes situations like this won\u2019t escalate to such a scale in the future when\na new Illinois law regarding squatters\ntakes effect.\nThe law, which takes effect January 1, allows police to remove \u201csquatters\u201d from residential properties without a court-ordered eviction.\nMeanwhile, the landlord group NBOA advises members to comply with lawfully issued warrants.\n\u201cOur housing providers will always respect a lawfully issued warrant and comply with their legal obligations,\u201d said NBOA president Michael Glasser. \u201cWe want to cooperate with law enforcement in addressing criminal activity while upholding our fundamental responsibility to keep our tenants safe and secure, and to respect their privacy and their rights.\u201d\nThe operation came as immigration enforcement is ramping up rapidly in Chicago, accompanied by protests both downtown and at an immigration detention center in Broadview.\nOn Friday alone, federal agents reportedly deployed tear gas on a residential street in Logan Square and handcuffed and threatened Humboldt Park-area Alderwoman Jessie Fuentes with\u00a0 arrest, Block Club Chicago\nreported\n. Fuentes said she heard the agents brought a suspect to the hospital after he fell while they were chasing him. She said they would not produce a warrant for the man or allow him to speak with attorneys.\nProtestors have also been criticizing ICE for allegedly violating due process in its apprehension of subjects.\nGuidance from the National Apartment Association\nnotes that \u201crenters and their families have a right to privacy and generally do not have to allow ICE into their homes.\u201d\nBut it also goes on to clarify that ICE can receive criminal warrants from a judge in certain circumstances.\nEditor\u2019s note: this post has been updated to properly reflect that Matthew Tarshis was recommended to be a receiver for the property at 7500 South Shore Drive but a judge will determine who to appoint at a later date.",

        "content": "Own a hotel in Los Angeles? Then, you\u2019re probably feeling some pain. Relevant\u2019s Grant King is these days.\nA lender wants to\nsell\nthe equity interests in the Dream Hollywood hotel, owned by a company connected to Relevant. A foreclosure auction is scheduled for mid-October.\nThe lender, LCP Group, alleges Relevant owes more than $30 million in unpaid debt connected to the 10-story, 178-key hotel at 6417 Selma Avenue.\nKing, for his part, said Relevant is working on a loan recapitalization and extension with the lender. If he loses the hotel, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time. The Tommie and Thompson Hollywood hotels \u2014 both sporting different names now \u2014 were under Relevant\u2019s ownership when they went to lenders two years ago.\nKing isn\u2019t the only owner in a jam. Queensgate Investments\ndefaulted\non the debt connected to the Freehand Los Angeles, a hotel-meets-hostel downtown, to the tune of $71 million and too faces foreclosure. The London-based company missed its maturity date for the loan tied to the 226-key hotel at 416 West 8th Street that was once the 13-story, Beaux-Arts-style Commercial Exchange Building.\nAnd, this may only be the beginning, Atlas Hospitality Group\u2019s Alan Reay told\nThe Real Deal\n. Several Los Angeles hoteliers are receiving notice of defaults, and investors are looking at the city with disdain.\nAmong the the pitfalls that are keeping would-be investor out of L.A. is\u00a0 Measure ULA, the so-called \u201cMansion Tax,\u201d that goes beyond mansions and has led to fewer commercial trades, Then there\u2019s homelessness and crime, a related dip in tourism hitting revenue, and a $30 minimum wage for hotel workers in the City of Los Angeles adding to costs.\nAn uncertain economic environment marked with high interest rates is a kicker.\nAdd it up and there\u2019s a new calculus, according to Reay, who says he would have called the Dream Hollywood and the Freehand desirable and well-located a few years ago.\nThings have changed.\nRunning out of time\n\nWe\u2019ve been following the Rockwood Capital-owned Santa Monica Clock Tower for a few months now. Back in May the debt connected to what was once the city\u2019s tallest skyscraper went to\nspecial servicing\n. By July the property saw its\nvalue slashed\nand Rockwood appeared ready to\nsurrender\n.\nFall arrives with Rialto Capital, the special servicer, which acts on behalf of the lender,\nsuing\na company connected to Rockwood, claiming the company defaulted on about $25 million in debt.\nThe special servicer requested a court-appointed receiver to take possession of the 53,500-square-foot, century-old, Art Deco office tower at 225 Santa Monica Boulevard. Rialto wants to foreclose and sell the Santa Monica Clock Tower that is only 43 percent occupied.\nNow to the Valley\nThe Encino Financial Center, a 13-story office building owned by Lowe Enterprises, received a recent reappraisal that reduced its value by almost a third. The downgrade came after its loan landed in special servicing due to imminent monetary default, according to Morningstar Credit and Trepp.\nThe about 230,000-square-foot office building at 16133 Ventura Boulevard is now valued at $48.8 million compared to $72 million at loan issuance in February 2015. That is still more than the $36.9 million debt connected to the property, and according to servicer commentary via Morningstar, modification discussions are ongoing. Lowe, which on its website notes the Encino Financial Center was the first office building the company acquired on its own behalf, declined to comment.\nEarnings season\nEarnings are near. Los Angeles-based, publicly traded, real estate investment trusts Hudson Pacific Properties, Kilroy Realty and Rexford Industrial Realty have announced dates for their third quarter earnings calls in October and November.\nLast quarter, Hudson Pacific\nreported\nan $83 million loss; Kilroy\nreported\nan increase in income to $68 million and announced a $40 million Santa Monica office sale; and Rexford\nreported\nan increase in income to $113 million.\nStay tuned to see how the companies fared through the third quarter.\n",

        "content": "Wall Street\u2019s creep into Texas turned into a stampede of financial institutions bounding into Dallas and\ngrabbing acres of office space in recent years, and the trend has New Yorkers shaking in their Timberlands.\nThe latest back-office clearance\ncame last week, when the Texas Stock Exchange won approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to set up shop, putting it on track to open next year, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. The exchange is temporarily located at 4550 Travis Street in Uptown Dallas and is searching for a long-term headquarters, likely in downtown.\nNone other than the\nNew York Stock Exchange\nand Nasdaq are next, each of those exchanges with regional headquarters planned in Dallas. NYSE chose a traditional office enclave to house the offices of its Texas exchange, taking a lease at Harlan Crow\u2019s Old Parkland in Uptown Dallas,\nThe Real Deal\nfirst reported\nback in June.\nThe cast of big players with a rooting interest in Dallas as a growing center of the financial world looks likely to help. The nation\u2019s largest homebuilder, Arlington-based\nD.R. Horton\n, is among the powerhouses committed to listing on the NYSE Texas exchange.\nA lot of the groundwork has been laid without the fanfare that has accompanied the more recent push for full-blown Y\u2019All Street. Texas already has more\nfinancial services jobs\nthan New York City, the New York Post\nreported\n. Many more are on the way, with Goldman Sachs developing a $500 million office in Uptown and Wells Fargo building a 22-acre campus in Irving\u2019s Las Colinas.\nAnd then there\u2019s JPMorgan Chase, by far the largest bank in the United States, which has more employees in Texas than in its headquarters, New York City. The bank\u2019s Dallas headcount is creeping up on NYC\u2019s with 18,000 employees in Big D compared to 24,000 in the Big Apple.\nDallas-Fort Worth is one of Chase CEO Jamie Dimon\u2019s favorite markets, and he\u2019s been bullish on Texas for years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hospitable. It\u2019s the infrastructure, it\u2019s the education, it\u2019s the taxes. They want business, they support it,\u201d Dimon\ntold\nthe Dallas Morning News in 2023. \u201cIt\u2019s conducive to helping everybody. That\u2019s how you build a healthy, vibrant society. And so we\u2019re urging them here not to become like Washington, D.C., which does almost everything it can to slow down the growth of companies.\u201d\nAs Texas kicks up its heels to Y\u2019all Street, New Yorkers are alarmed.\n\u201cThe financial services industry, they\u2019re our biggest taxpayers and major employers \u2014 and that industry is shrinking in New York,\u201d\u00a0 Kathryn Wylde, president and CEO of the Partnership for New York City\nsaid\non talk radio recently. \u201cThat\u2019s scary.\u201d\nThen again, Chase\u2019s Dimon is about to cut the ribbon on a 2.5 million-square-foot\nheadquarters on Park Avenue\nin Midtown Manhattan, so it\u2019s not exactly a zero-sum game at this point.\n\nUptown rides Y\u2019All Street to biggest office sale\nAnother cause for Dallasites to cheer the arrival of financial firms: Uptown is the epicenter of Y\u2019all Street and Dallas\u2019 hottest office market, out-competing downtown Dallas for top leases, including Bank of America\u2019s 238,000-square-foot lease at KDC\u2019s under construction Parkside Uptown.\nUnion Investment knocked one out of the park with the sale of an office building at 2000 McKinney Avenue in Uptown, the\nbiggest office trade in Dallas\nso far this year. The price for the 21-story, 457,000-square-foot property wasn\u2019t disclosed, but the German investor said it \u201ca significant value increase\u201d to its 2016 purchase price of $226 million, or $500 per square foot. The buyer wasn\u2019t disclosed.\nThat price beats the $218 million price Atlanta-based Cousins Properties\u2019 paid for the Link at Uptown, at 2601 Olive Street, in August. Cousins\u2019 transaction still wins on price per square foot at $747.\nNorthPark takes back ownership\nThe DFW-NYC connection is working out nicely for the Texans of the Nasher-Haemisegger family.\nThe once and future owners of\nNorthPark Center\nin Dallas went to several banks in the Big Apple for a $900 million refinancing deal that buys out a single New York outfit that held a majority stake in the upscale indoor retail center in North Dallas.\nNasher-Haemisigger\u2019s deal includes a two-year, floating-rate CMBS loan from Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. The debt will wipe out $650M in previous debt and allow the family to buy out JPMorgan\u2019s stake in the mall, which has more than 200 stores and restaurants.\nEiseman Jewels recently made a massive investment in the 2.35 million-square-foot mall, and Neiman Marcus is expected to invest in its store there. The mall was developed in 1965 by Ray Nasher.\nIn memoriam\nJoshua Pack\n, the co-CEO of Dallas-based Fortress Investment Group died recently at age 51. Pack joined Fortress, which also has a headquarters in New York, 23 years ago. He was promoted to co-CEO two years ago and had recently relocated from Dallas to London to focus on European expansion. The cause of death wasn\u2019t disclosed.\n",

        "content": "Chicagoland\u2019s luxury real estate market is reaching new peaks.\nMultiple\nbillionaires have now assembled North Shore beachfront estates\nconsisting of multiple homes to extend private shorelines along Lake Michigan.\nEric Lefkofsky\n, the co-founder of Groupon and investor in a handful of other unicorn companies, was the latest member of the 10-figure net worth club to make his footprint even bigger than his already record-setting property on the waterfront.\nWhile his plans for the\nGlencoe home he just bought from his late former neighbor\nfor $8.3 million aren\u2019t yet clear, it adds a substantial chunk of land to his sprawling Glade Road mansion that he bought for $19.5 million back in 2014, the highest price ever paid for a Chicago-area home at the time and one\nseldom surpassed\nsince.\nYet surpassed it was \u2014\nby a longshot\n\u2014 last month in Winnetka, when a still unidentified buyer plunked down over $31 million for a former Goldman Sachs executive\u2019s property to crush the record price for a single-family home in the Chicago area.\nThose deals come on the heels of\nbillionaire Justin Ishbia paying nearly $40 million\nto buy an assemblage of homes on Winnetka\u2019s lakefront so he could tear them down to build a 68,000-square-foot house. The new estate is under construction, at a total cost of at least $77 million including the land.\nWhile the Ishbia deal, and perhaps Lefkofsky\u2019s, are about gaining access to what could be considered blank canvases for development, there\u2019s still a market for\nhistoric properties on the North Shore\n. That came clear with the $11 million sale of a Lake Forest mansion once owned by members of the Armour meatpacking family after it was built in 1912 for John T. Pirie, president of Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Co.\nAre the upper reaches of the North Shore catching up to high-end markets on the nation\u2019s coasts? The Chicago metro isn\u2019t at Manhattan or Westside L.A. levels, but its luxury scene fits with Sunbelt hotspots Dallas and Miami, where\nbigger-ticket deals for waterfront land assemblage\nhave been a force in the market for years.\nOnly time will tell, but this week prolonged a strong stretch for Chicago\u2019s luxury market across various neighborhoods, property types, conditions and price points.\nThere were 15 deals at $4 million-plus, according to online listing services. That number is probably a little higher, as sales sometimes happen off market and aren\u2019t recorded in public records until later.\nIndeed, deals over the $4 million local luxury line ranged from the North Shore to an increasingly well-heeled southwestern Michigan vacation town, and from downtown to the western \u2018burbs, with a stop in Lincoln Park for good measure.\nIn the raw: Unfinished West Loop penthouse brings $5.3M\nAn\nunfinished penthouse in the West Loop\nsold for $5.25 million on Sept. 25, leaving the new owners with a significant build-out project before they can move in.\nThe 5,200-square-foot condo is a raw \u201cshell space\u201d on the top floor of the 16-story Embry West Loop tower at 21 North May Street. Building out the space will likely cost more than $1 million.\nThe buyers, who were not identified, were represented by Julie Busby of Compass. Tim Sheahan and Mark Icuss, also with Compass, represented the developer, Sulo Development.\nThe sale marks a full sell-out for all 58 units in the Embry building. While a high price for the neighborhood, it is not the building\u2019s priciest unit. A penthouse on the 15th floor sold for $7 million in 2023.\nSulo is also the developer behind Hayden, an eight-story, 28-unit condo building at 1109 West Washington Boulevard. It also proposed a three-building, 243-condo project last year at 1325 West Fulton Street.\nTicket to South Haven hideout costs $4M\n\nOn the other end of Lake Michigan in the getaway town of South Haven, Michigan, a sleek modern lakehouse sold for $4 million on Sept. 1. The house has a contemporary, angular design with industrial black siding and large glass windows, draped by a curved roof.\nThe 5,205 square-foot lakefront house with 5 bedrooms and 6.5 bathrooms is only the fourth house in South Haven to sell for $4 million or more in recent years. It came fully furnished, minus some items reserved by the owner.\nThe house was constructed and put up for sale by Anthony Penrose, MLive reported last year. Property records list the buyer as a trust connected to Allison Kouba.\nAndy Klavins of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Michigan Real Estate represented the seller, and Tammy Kerr with Better Homes and Gardens Connections represented the buyer.\nHinsdale mansion pushes boundary of western suburban market at $5.9M\nA Hinsdale mansion\nsold for $5.9 million on Sept. 11\n, securing the highest sale price in the wealthy western suburb in more than a year. The deal for the home at 818 South Elm Street closed in a private transaction after it was initially listed for $7.3 million last year, representing a nearly 20 percent price cut.\nThe seven-bedroom, 16,000-square-foot home sits on a 1.27-acre lot. It was publicly listed in August 2024 before being removed from the market that December. The sale makes it the priciest non-lakefront suburban home to sell in Chicagoland so far this year, aside from a unique Barrington property featured in the TV show \u201cEmpire.\u201d\nColdwell Banker\u2019s\nDawn McKenna\nand Lauren Walz represented the seller on the deal, and\nAlexandra Shaban\nof Jameson Sotheby\u2019s represented the buyer. The seller couldn\u2019t be identified in public records, and information on the buyer was not immediately available.\nWhile it set a high mark for the year, the property is not the most expensive Hinsdale sale on record. Two homes have fetched prices above $7 million in Hinsdale: A 17,600 square-foot mansion sold for a\nrecord $7.7 million in 2021\n, and an off-market sale brought in\n$7.5 million in 2022\n.\nKenilworth mansion found buyer after four years\nAfter four years on the market and major price cuts, a\nKenilworth mansion sold for $6.8 million\non Sept. 11, one of the most expensive sales in the village\u2019s history.\nThe home was last owned by the late Yadelle and Robert Sklare, and their family managed the sale. The long time on the market was in part because the family was in no rush to sell the house, listing agent Nancy Nugent of Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty said.\nIt first hit the private market in 2021 asking $14 million. In 2022, it went public, keeping the $14 million ask. The price dropped five times before its last listing price of $7.7 million in September 2024.\nThe buyers haven\u2019t been identified, but Nugent said they plan to tear down the house and build a new one on the lakefront property.\nCommercial roundup\nThe big commercial real estate news of the week pointed to signs of life in some long-fallow sites eyed for megadevelopments.\nDeveloper\nRelated Midwest, Clayco and a platoon of other partners\nbroke ground on the multi-billion dollar quantum computing facility set to replace the former South Works steel site on Chicago\u2019s South Side.\nBlue Owl\u2019s real estate division\nthat specializes in sale-leaseback transactions was revealed to be involved in financing the land acquisition, as it paid around $75 million to U.S. Steel for the land and subsequently sold a $58 million ground lease deal to the development team led by Related.\nAnd on the North Side, developer\nJim Letchinger\u2019s JDL and Kayne Anderson\nofficially closed on an approximately $84 million acquisition of the northern portion of the former Lincoln Yards site. The deal unlocks a plan focused on residential development, under a new name for the property: Foundry Park. The site\u2019s former developer\nSterling Bay and investment partner Lone Star Funds\nlost the land to their lender Bank OZK after a $125 million default, but Sterling Bay and J.P. Morgan Asset Management have\nretained control of the southern portion\nof the property that was once set to be turned into a $6 billion campus with an emphasis on commercial buildings.",

        "content": "While some artificial intelligence and tech firms in the Bay Area are looking to claw above each other for the top spot,\nSnowflake\nis instead reaching its arms out sideways.\nThe cloud data platform just revamped the top floor of its Menlo Park headquarters into the all-new \u201cSilicon Valley AI Hub,\u201d a 30,000-square-foot space meant to act as a meeting place and water cooler for some of the booming sector\u2019s emerging unicorns. Case in point: One of the first events held in the new space gathered executives from OpenAI, Windsurf and\nGlean\nto share their wisdom on launching an AI startup.\nAn inaugural class of 13 startups will set up shop at the hub over the course of three months, gaining access to coworking space, professional video studios and snacks as well as Snowflake\u2019s computing infrastructure and the company\u2019s investor network. The goal is to host up to 10 events a week at the AI hub, including networking dinners, hackathons and educational sessions. An expansion to add a rooftop restaurant and bar is slated for next year.\nIn the years since the public release of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT in 2022, Snowflake has been beefing up its artificial intelligence capabilities, as well as its own business operations, growing its headcount from 1,000 to 8,000 in the five years since its 2020 IPO and\nsubleasing 773,000-square-foot from Meta\nlast year.\nSnowflake has partnered in the past with OpenAI and Anthropic to integrate their language models in its products. But the new AI hub marks a new chapter for collaboration in the booming sector \u2014 not just between Snowflake and AI companies, but among those specialty AI firms themselves.\nThe move comes as other AI firms across the region also beef up their operations in terms of headcount and office square footage.\nDatabricks\n\u2014 Snowflake\u2019s most direct competitor \u2014 snagged an additional 305,000 square feet in Sunnyvale in July. OpenAI and Anthropic have been on similar tears in San Francisco.\nOpenAI\noccupies approximately 1 million square feet of offices and vowed at the grand opening of its Mission Bay headquarters in March that it plans to double its headcount of 2,000 San Francisco-based employees.\nAnthropic\nlast month added another 100,000 square feet to its headquarters footprint. And AI-powered software company\nPostman\nopened a new 32,367-square-foot headquarters in the Financial District over the summer.\nThe AI sector is driving office demand in the Bay Area as the region stumbles toward post-pandemic recovery. As of last month, office lease demand in San Francisco was up 107 percent year-over-year, according to a recent VTS\nreport\n. Office demand in the city was up more than 350 percent since ChatGPT was first released to the public in late 2022.\nOver the next five years, San Francisco and the Bay Area could see as many as 50,000 to 60,000 new workers in the AI sector move in, experts at CBRE\npredict\n. To accommodate them, AI firms are expected to grow their office footprints from 5 million square feet to more than 20 million.\nSan Jose site trades\nIn more AI-related news, a\nGoodman Group\naffiliate bought land in north San Jose proposed for a data center, a hot asset class thanks to the demand for space to store computer processing units as AI proliferates. The deal with LBA Realty came with a $200 million price tag. The all-cash deal for 350 and 370 West Trimble Road includes 46.8 acres currently housing an office complex and adjacent vacant land. Earlier this year, LBA submitted a development permit to the city of San Jose to build a 207,950-square-foot data center on the site; Goodman Group is known for its work with data centers around the world.\nElsewhere in San Jose, a plot of land in downtown sandwiched between the convention center and Children\u2019s Discovery Museum sold to the city for $13.5 million. BXP offloaded the 3.6-acre parking lot property after plans to build a tech campus complete with offices, retail and housing.\nA spooky buy\nScared by the idea of buying a haunted hotel at a bargain-basement price?\nDon\u2019t be\u2013hotels across the Bay Area\nhave been selling\nat steep discounts in recent years amid a wave of loan defaults, foreclosures and other financial woes.\nThere was, however, something unique about the latest deal, which saw\nHotel Union Square\ngo at bargain. While it was one of several hotels used as temporary shelter during the pandemic, it was just one of two that never reopened its doors to the public afterward.\n\nThat likely helped investor Mahmood Alam snap up the 131 room property for $30 million, a discount of more than a third on the 131-room property at 100-120 Powell Street street.\nThe hotel comes with more than 100 years of history, including the purported ghost of playwright Lillian Hellman, who had frequent dalliances with author Dashiell Hammett in Room 207 during the Prohibition era. In recent years, it operated as temporary residences for the homeless in 2020 and 2021. Rockpoint Group defaulted on its mortgage in 2023 and managers Rockpoint and Highgate Hotels have been searching for a buyer ever since.\nRedco adds another trophy to mantle\nThe\nsale of Wells Fargo\u2019s headquarters\nin downtown San Francisco is finally complete.\nRedco Development closed its purchase of 420 Montgomery Street for $55 million \u2014 more than 85 percent below the building\u2019s pre-pandemic value of $370 million. The offices are mostly vacant after Wells Fargo decamped much of its operations to a 620,000-square-foot lease at 333 Market Street last year.\nRedco was able to move in after housing developer Forge Development Partners got close to buying 420 Montgomery Street for a similar price with plans to convert the building into housing, with the plans ultimately falling apart.\nRedco plans to rebrand the iconic office building as \u201c450 California,\u201d complete with a revamped public-facing lobby with food and beverage tenants including a coffee shop, bar and restaurant. Underground, Redco plans to convert the former bank vault into a speakeasy bar, fitness center, bowling alley and other amenities, while the developer is hoping to bring in a single tenant to lease the upper four floors, including the penthouse.\nRedco now owns nearly two blocks on the California Street corridor after buying 400 Montgomery Street next door to the Wells Fargo building for $25 million and 300 California Street for $28.5 million last year.\nMattson\u2019s lending accomplice under microscope\nOne of Ken Mattson\u2019s lending partners is in the crosshairs of his victims.\nVictims of the disgraced Sonoma developer-turned-alleged-fraudster have trained their sights on\nSocotra Capital\n, the Sacramento-based firm that provided Mattson\u2019s businesses with more than 100 loans totaling more than $180 million. Socotra holds liens on 75 properties linked to Mattson.\nDefrauded investors haven\u2019t filed a lawsuit against the lender directly \u2014 yet.\nMatt Treger, who claims to have gotten scammed after investing with Mattson over 15 years, cites Scotra\u2019s own website as a red flag.\n\u201cFrom Socotra\u2019s website, they proclaim, \u2018We\u2019re not like your conventional lenders with strict parameters, slow turnarounds, and unnecessary hoops to jump through,\u2019\u201d Matt Treger, who invested with Mattson over more than 15 years,\ntold\nthe Press Democrat. \u201cAs someone whose life savings has been swallowed up, their business model seems clear evidence that parameters and hoops are an essential part of a just system.\u201d\n\u201cMy hope is that, as an investor group, we pursue every avenue to determine accountability and recompense,\u201d Treger added.\nThe latest accusations against Socotra come a month after Mattson,\nout on $4 million bail\n,\ncrashed his car into a fence and tree\nin Sonoma. The Press Democrat\nreported\nthis week that he was unconscious when authorities arrived on the scene. Notably, in the year leading up to his arrest, Mattson reportedly sold off 40 classic cars to the tune of nearly $3 million, though his lawyers\npleaded this summer\nfor relief from selling off additional other vehicles.\n",

        "content": "Rankings\nand superlatives are probably the one thing agents and brokerages can agree they love to hate and then love again.\nMost are unable to look away from perusing said rankings even if they take issue with the methodology.\nWith the Los Angeles County ranking for this year\u2019s top agents and teams now complete, the list may be as close to a reflection of the high end of the market one can get. That statement doesn\u2019t gloss over the common complaints heard each year from some in the industry, most notably that the list throws teams and solo agents into the same ring.\nTo be fair, it\u2019s not an apples to apples comparison when, for example, a 15-person team\u2019s production is going up against the business of an agent that operates solo. However, the market\u2019s housing inventory isn\u2019t siphoned off into buckets of what can be bought and sold by a team or a single agent.\nAll that said, the Williams &amp; Williams Estate Group, helmed by Branden and Rayni Williams, took the No. 1 spot on this year\u2019s list with about $1.3 billion in production and 197 deals.\nKurt Rappaport\n, co-founder of Westside Estate Agency, ranked No. 5 overall but if we were only counting single agents, he\u2019d rank at the top with $568 million dollars closed across the 19 deals he handled, and lead on median price, too.\nLack of context\nSpeaking of superlatives, a Redfin report found the sale of Rick Caruso\u2019s former home at 912 Benedict Canyon Drive to be the U.S.\u2019s priciest deal in\nAugust\n.\nThe property sold for\n$47.5 million\n, although the designation of \u201cpriciest\u201d lacked market context beyond the month of August, the traditional dog days for residential sales.\nFor example, within Los Angeles County, the most expensive home sales to date in 2025 were two properties that each sold for $110 million: 630 Nimes Road in Bel-Air and 594 South Mapleton Drive in Holmby Hills.\nAgainst the backdrop of the broader U.S. residential market, Nimes Road and Mapleton Drive are tied for second place after the\n$225 million sale\nof a three-address, 15-acre compound in Naples, Florida.\nThe April sale consisted of 2170, 2200 and 2340 Gordon Drive and is now the second-most expensive residential sale in U.S. history.\nAll that to say, awarding superlatives based on the timespan of a week or month doesn\u2019t always offer the clearest view of much of anything.\n\nNavigating Measure ULA\nThe rankings and records indicate that agents in Los Angeles are still closing deals even with what some liken to a big wet rag on business in the form of\nMeasure ULA\n.\nThe two-tiered tax on all property \u2014 commercial and residential \u2014 went into effect in April 2023 and currently assesses a 4 percent fee on deals starting at $5.3 million or 5.5 percent on $10.6 million or more.\nRayni Williams, CEO and co-founder of the Beverly Hills Estates, called ULA the \u201cbiggest detriment\u201d for the market currently.\nThat\u2019s \u201cmore than interest rates. More than world events,\u201d she added.\nOthers see things differently and have largely accepted the tax as a cost of doing business.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to accept it\u2019s there, otherwise what can we do?\u201d said David Berg of Smith &amp; Berg Partners at Compass. \u201cWe can yell and scream about it and hope that there\u2019s a solution that comes along. Maybe it\u2019s repealed, but essentially, it\u2019s a fact of life at this point for what we do.\u201d\nRecommended reading\nTRD\ntagged along with Amalfi Estates founder Anthony Marguleas in the\nPacific Palisades\nlast month.\nThe ride along offered not only a sense of what it\u2019s like to do business in the community, but also on the progress that\u2019s been made in the Pacific Palisades since January\u2019s fire.\nA subsequent visit back noted a steady stream of dine-in and to-go business from construction workers and locals at the Palisades Garden Caf\u00e9. Construction equipment sat parked at Rick Caruso\u2019s Palisades Village on the other side of Sunset Boulevard, where a group of suits walked around the retail center, which remains under repair in the wake of the blaze.\nThe split-screen along Sunset illustrated that there\u2019s still plenty of work ahead,\u00a0but construction on residential lots is becoming increasingly common as the community moves forward.\n",

Also unlikely.\nMiami\u2019s perpetual optimism helps mask some of the issues that we\u2019ve been reporting on.\nIn\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s\ncover story\n, I took a macro look at the real estate market in South Florida and the red flags that may be clouding the region\u2019s future.\nA lot is going well, and an abundance of industry pundits are available to speak to that. The wealth migration continues, and construction crews are showing up to work every day. But many challenges also have plagued developers for years. Condo sales slowed, construction, insurance and debt are all too expensive. Projects require more equity. And some sectors are experiencing longer, stronger pauses than others.\nCondo developers have had to secure more equity at a time when equity is lacking, one capital markets broker told me. We reported this summer that many multifamily developers sitting on land are looking to sell their sites, and demand for spec office space has dried up. Retail is still doing well.\nAnd restaurants had to endure a tough summer. Many closed.\nOne thing that I\u2019ve noticed in conversations with sources and publicists is that developers and real estate agents are cutting back on their marketing budgets. They\u2019re re-engineering projects to save money, even if they have already sold those units. Companies have stopped hiring, or pulled back on hiring.\nAffordability is playing a big role in the region\u2019s economy because the gap between the haves and the have-nots has grown tremendously.\nLate last month, UBS released its housing bubble report, which looks at price to income, price to rent and prices compared to the national average. At the top? Miami. If only the wealthy can afford to live here, that will have a big effect on the region in the long term.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nHistorian Marvin Dunn alleges in a new lawsuit that Miami Dade College violated Sunshine Laws in\napproving land\nfor a potential Trump Presidential Library without public input. The site could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. What do you think, and how does this end? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\n\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential\n: Deborah Ann Robinson, a novelist and the widow of Edward J. Robinson, chief financial officer of RJR Nabisco, parted with a single-family home at 217 Clarke Avenue in Palm Beach for $30 million. The buyer was Southern Mark LLC, a Delaware-registered company reportedly tied to Winifred \u201cWinnie\u201d Johnson Marquart, heir to the SC Johnson fortune.\nCommercial\n:\nTishman Speyer acquired\na 270-unit apartment complex at 5500 Broken Sound Boulevard Northwest and 950 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway in Boca Raton for $124.5 million. The seller of the complex, known as the Bell at Broken Sound Apartments, was Greensboro, North Carolina-based Bell Partners.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nAn oceanfront estate in Manalapan hit the market for $75 million. The ocean-to-lake compound at\n640 South Ocean Boulevard\nwas built in 2020. The nearly 17,000-square-foot mansion has 11 bedrooms, six and a half bathrooms, a gym, spa, bar and lounge, two boat lifts, a guard house and a guest house, according to the listing. Casey Flannery of Equestrian Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has the listing. The property is owned by a trust, and it was on the market last year for $85 million. It sold in 2020 for $36 million.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nFlorida\u2019s Treasure Coast is living up to its name. A shipwreck salvage company recovered more than\n1,000 silver and gold coins\nvalued at about $1 million from an 18th-century shipwreck. The treasure is allegedly part of gold, silver and jewels lost by the Spanish fleet during a hurricane more than 200 years ago.\nElsewhere in Florida\nAs lawyers duke it out in court over the future of Alligator Alcatraz, the Trump administration awarded Florida $608 million for the state\u2019s immigrant detention efforts, the\nNews Service of Florida reports\n. The money will come from the $150 billion that Congress awarded to the Federal Emergency Management Agency this year.\nFlorida regulators will open hearings Monday on Florida Power &amp; Light\u2019s revised $7 billion rate hike, down from its original $9.8 billion proposal, according to\nFlorida Phoenix\n. Critics called FPL\u2019s original proposal the largest utility rate increase in U.S. history, and the latest proposal would still grant FPL a return on equity above the national average.\nA grand jury in Tallahassee will hear testimony this month as part of a criminal probe into the Hope Florida Foundation, a charity led by First Lady Casey DeSantis, after revelations that $10 million from a state settlement was funneled into a political committee tied to Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 chief of staff, the\nMiami Herald\nreports.",

        "content": "Nail-polish money provided the gloss for the biggest condominium sale in Los Angeles County in the first half of the year, with former OPI nail polish executive Miriam Schaeffer paying $39.1 million purchase of a full-floor penthouse in Century City, according to Los Angeles County tax assessor records. The January deal at The Century also marks the county\u2019s\nmost expensive condo trade\nin at least the past three years, as\nThe Real Deal\nreported.\nThis is the latest installment in a feature providing a weekly update on top sales by market segment, based on TRDData for given periods. You can see the top 10 condo sales for the first half of the year by clicking\nhere\n.\nThe seller \u2014 represented by Douglas Elliman\u2019s Bachir Oueida \u2014 was Vicki Walters, who listed the property at 1 West Century Drive for $50 million in 2023, according to the\nWall Street Journal\n. Her late husband, Raul Walters, was a real estate developer who built and financed early Walmart stores. Walters paid $22.5 million for the residence in 2015, property records show.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Jacob Dadon negotiated on behalf of Schaeffer, whose ex-husband founded OPI.\n\nThe 9,400-square-foot unit, which went for $4,153 per square foot, includes three bedrooms and seven bathrooms. Touches include hand-painted 22-karat gold leaf on the ceiling and 11-foot projector screens. The apartment also comes with a 500-square-foot studio, a pool cabana, a separate 1,200-square-foot office suite and four parking spaces.\nOther high-profile deals in the Robert AM Stern-designed building include Candy Spelling \u2014 widow of Aaron Spelling \u2014 buying a penthouse unit for $35 million in 2010, and singer Rihanna\nselling\nher condo in 2024 for $20.8 million\na year after acquiring it\nfor $21 million. Rihanna\u2019s unit was once owned by the late \u201cFriends\u201d star Matthew Perry.\nSchaeffer, whose fortune tracks to the OPI nail-polish brand founded by her now ex-husband, is an active player in the L.A. County high-end residential real estate market.\nIn September 2024 she sold the Malibu carbon neutral residence named\nZero One\nat 11865 Ellice Street for $25 million. She acquired the 4,300-square-foot\n31048 Broad Beach Road\nin Malibu in 2023 for $35 million. And she spent roughly $51 million in 2021 across three purchases for properties in Los Angeles, Malibu and Hidden Hills.\n",

        "content": "A group of Dream Town agents in Chicago has moved over to Compass, notching a win for the national firm as it chases growth in Chicago\u2019s market.\nJoey Halperin, David Schatz and Chris Sweitzer joined Compass on Sept. 29 as the principals of their new team, Terra Group. They brought along Megan O\u2019Carroll, Dana Noureldin, Riley Callahan and Daniel Banys, all previously members of the Halperin Schatz team at Dream Town, which is owned by independent brokerage Baird &amp; Warner.\nAll seven agents have worked at Compass in the past, and Halperin said the return to Compass was a \u201cfull circle\u201d moment for the team.\nThe move is further evidence of competition for agents and market share between Compass and the remaining Chicago brokerages that aren\u2019t affiliated with the real estate behemoth. Compass announced its plan to\nmerge with Anywhere Real Estate last month\n, which would bring some of the city\u2019s biggest brokerages under its banner. It purchased Chicago\u2019s largest brokerage, @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, last year.\nThe purchase of @properties left Baird &amp; Warner, which\nacquired Dream Town earlier this year\n, as the largest independent brokerage in Chicago. Baird &amp; Warner president and CEO Steve Baird said in an earlier interview with\nThe Real Deal\nthat he sees the consolidation as an opportunity to grow Baird &amp; Warner and pick up more agents as mergers disrupt the brokerage space.\nPeter Cummins, a longtime @properties agent on the North Shore recently moved to Baird &amp; Warner,\nciting opposition to consolidation\nand private exclusive listings as his reason for the move.\nBut the move back to Compass by these agents gives weight to Compass\u2019 bet that its deep agent network, technology platforms and exclusive listing strategy will attract more agents.\n\nThe members of the new Compass team made a combined $55 million in sales in the last 12 months, Sweitzer said. The team has a focus on selling new development, with about 60 to 70 percent of the agents\u2019 business being in new construction, Schatz said. Sweitzer also focuses on investment properties.\nHalperin said access to Compass\u2019 private exclusives is a plus, especially in new developments. Compass has been pushing a three-phase marketing strategy, where some properties begin as private exclusives marketed only to Compass agents. The company says the strategy offers sellers more freedom and privacy and helps them test pricing before their house hits the open market.\nZillow and many of Compass\u2019 competitors, like Baird &amp; Warner, have\nopposed the trend toward private exclusive\nlistings, arguing they distort the market for consumers and are anti-competitive.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the basketball player where you hate to play against him but you love when you\u2019re on the team,\u201d Halperin said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that, when we weren\u2019t on the team, we didn\u2019t necessarily love, but now that we\u2019re on the team, it\u2019s giving our clients an advantage.\u201d\nBeyond the initial group of seven, the team\u2019s principals said they hope to attract more agents going forward.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to be able to scale a team quite well and bring a really strong group of like-minded individuals together and make a really, really solid team,\u201d Sweitzer said.\n",

It\u2019s possible that some of these borrowers and lenders will reach agreements to avoid auction.\nHouston\nThe largest CRE loan debuting on the auction block in Houston this month is a $42 million mortgage tied to the 265-unit Adenine Apartments. Unlike most of the multifamily properties facing foreclosure in Harris County, this one is relatively new, built in 2016. Madera Residential, which is based in Lubbock, bought the apartment complex, at 1755 Wyndale Street, in 2023. The debt is a collateralized loan structured by Prime Finance Partners. It works out to $158,490 per unit.\nSan Antonio\nTroubled investor Alan Stalcup and his firm GVA\nare facing foreclosure on Barcelo Apartments, a 288-unit apartment complex at 3501 Pin Oak Drive in San Antonio. CBRE Multifamily provided the $30.5 million mortgage. The debt on the property, built in 1972, works out to $106,000 per unit.\nDallas\nArbor Realty is foreclosing on Parea Oak Lawn, at 4503 Lake Avenue. Lakewood, New Jersey-based\nSun Equity Partners\nis the owner. The $25.5 million mortgage on the 131-unit property built in 1970 works out to $194,656 per unit.\nFort Worth\n\nThe loan tied to Arioso Apartments &amp; Townhomes is supposed to hit the auction block this month. A Rialto Real Estate fund provided the $56 million mortgage for the 288-unit property at 3030 Claremont Drive in Grand Prairie. Ed Monce\u2019s IMH Companies bought the property in 2022. It was built in 2007, and the debt works out to $194,000 per unit.\nRepeat offenders\nOf the 11 foreclosures in Houston\u2019s Harris County, six properties are regulars. They\u2019ve received multiple foreclosure notices but haven\u2019t been sold yet. The list includes multiple properties owned by Rao Polavarapu\u2019s Falls Apartment Group, which had a loan head to special servicing in August.\nFalls of Braeburn, a 191-unit complex at 9707 Braeburn Glen ($64.5 million);\nThe Selena Apartments, a 446-unit complex at 250 Uvalde Road ($37.9 million).\nFalls of Las Villas, a 466-unit complex at 407 Richey Street, and Falls of Alta Vista, a 514-unit complex at 621 Richey Street ($33.5 million);\nFalls of Westpark, a 356-unit complex at 6130 Southwest ($29 million); and\nThe Sophia Apartments, a 240-unit complex at 11500 Green Plaza ($17.9 million).\nTwo properties in Bexar County are headed to the block a second time:\nOne Technology Center, a 196,000-square-foot office building, at 7411 John Smith Avenue ($57.75 million); and\nAviator at Brooks, a 280-unit apartment complex at 8010 Aeromedical Road ($33.9 million).\nTravis County will see one repeat customer at the auction block this month:\nGalleria Oaks Building 2, an 18,000-square-foot retail strip at 13376 North U.S. Highway 183 ($16 million).\nAs will Dallas County:\nThree Forest Drive, a 367,000-square-foot office building, at 12221 Merit Street ($57.75 million).\n",

        "content": "New York City authorities are claiming a win in their push to enforce standards on landlords after\nMeyer Chetrit\u2019s indictment\non felony charges of tenant harassment.\nThe action is an escalation of city enforcement actions against landlords, who are largely subject to administrative penalties and rarely face criminal charges.\n\u201cFor folks who are following the law, this evens the playing field,\u201d said Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. \u201cOur hope is that the industry would be supportive of this kind of alleged conduct being rooted out.\u201d\nChetrit has been charged with two counts of harassment of a rent-regulated tenant, a felony that carries a maximum sentence of four years in prison.\nChetrit, through defense attorney Jeffrey Chartier, denied the allegations.\nBragg cited Chetrit\u2019s track record of poor conditions at his properties that persist after penalties and inquiries from the Department of Buildings and Loft Board. That gives the case evidence, but it also means that criminal sanctions are the appropriate next step, he said.\nBringing a criminal case to trial can be a deterrent to the cost-benefit analyses landlords make about administrative penalties, according to Jocelyn Strauber, Department of Investigations commissioner.\n\u201cWe suspect there\u2019s more conduct like this out there, which we will be looking for,\u201d Strauber said.\nMaking the case\nAshley Viruet, deputy director at Legal Services of New York City, said tenant harassment is still quite common in New York, and something tenants\u2019 attorneys see often. A one-off prosecution, she said, may not be enough to curb bad behavior.\n\u201cI appreciate that they\u2019re trying to put landlords on notice,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not entirely sure that it\u2019s going to change behaviors.\u201d\nAlthough Chetrit is facing potential prison time, that result would be something of a first for New York. There has not been a high-profile case where a landlord has served in prison specifically for tenant harassment.\nOther landlords who have tangled with law enforcement have either avoided time in state prison so far or have been sent there for other crimes.\nDaniel Ohebshalom was jailed at Rikers Island\nlast year for his refusal to fix deteriorating conditions at two Washington Heights buildings even after court orders. Last May, Ohebshalom was indicted on charges of tenant harassment and accused of filing false documents with the city.\nIn 2022, landlord Raphael Toledano was banned from real estate activity\nin New York for five years after he violated an agreement with the state to stop harassing tenants.\n\nSteve Croman, once named among the worst landlords in the city, faced a civil suit from the state for tenant harassment, which he\nsettled for $8 million in restitution in 2017\n. (He was\nsentenced to state prison in 2017\n, but for mortgage and tax fraud.)\n\u201cHistorically, the D.A.\u2019s office has wanted some kind of financial crime as kind of the linchpin to hold it all together,\u201d said Viruet, who is part of the team representing tenants of Ohebshalom in housing court.\nThere are other divisions in New York that come after landlords for tenant harassment, said Sherwin Belkin, a landlord-side real estate attorney and founding partner at Belkin Burden Goldman. But rarely do accusations to rise to the criminal level.\n\u201cProsecution for criminal harassment is a serious matter,\u201d Belkin said. \u201cI assume it\u2019s being taken very seriously by Mr. Chetrit and his attorneys.\u201d\nThe\ndistrict attorney alleged Chetrit\nallowed conditions in 111-117 West 26th Street to deteriorate, leaving the two senior citizens without heat or, in some cases, an elevator.\nThe tenants have special protection because they are in rent-stabilized apartments overseen by the city\u2019s loft board.\nChartier, Chetrit\u2019s defense attorney, cast doubt on the facts of the case, alleging that one of the two senior citizens is not a true resident of the building.\n\u201cRather than prosecute violent criminals that are plaguing the city, Bragg has again chosen to misapply the law in pursuit of a progressive political agenda,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s not the first time tenants have raised concerns about conditions in buildings associated with Chetrit.\nElected officials on the Upper West Side have raised alarms about\nChetrit\u2019s management of the Park West Village\non Columbus Avenue between West 97th and 100th streets. Tenants there have accused Chetrit of pocketing city rent subsidies without crediting them to renters\u2019 accounts, and then pursuing eviction.\nState Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal launched a confidential survey to determine the scope of the problem.\n\u201cMeyer Chetrit\u2019s indictment echoes the pattern of harassment and mismanagement that tenants in my district have reported for years under his management,\u201d Hoylman-Sigal said in a statement to\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cNo landlord should take taxpayer funds, bill tenants twice, and leave people in unsafe homes.\u201d\nRent-stabilized tenants at\n496 Metropolitan Avenue in Brooklyn\naccused an entity associated with Chetrit of abandoning the building. About one-third of the tenants filed a petition against the building owner in March, alleging dangerous conditions, harassment and retaliatory eviction. The building\u2019s lender has also brought a commercial foreclosure case on the building.\nThe city of Cleveland sued the Chetrits\u2019 family firm in 2023\nover conditions at three buildings\nin the city after tenants complained of broken elevators, malfunctioning heat, and negligent security. The city was seeking a receiver for the properties, but the parties have since proposed a buyer for the buildings, which would end the case.\nChetrit and associated parties are facing multiple civil suits from lenders, including several foreclosure actions. Maverick Real Estate Partners has\naccused Chetrit of fraudulently transferring money\nto shield assets from a $132 million judgment. His lawyers have denied the allegations.\n",

        "content": "The Live Local Act is incentivizing some developers to add affordable housing units with below-market rents to buildings that are already under construction or completed, instead of doing so at the pre-approval stage of development, according to a panel of speakers at the Urban Land Institute\u2019s Fort Lauderdale Forum.\nFor example, the developer of The Arcadian, a 502-unit apartment project in Fort Lauderdale, is in the process of designating some of the apartments as affordable housing units under the state\u2019s\nLive Local Act\n, which encourages the development of rental housing with below-market rents. The developer is Fort Lauderdale-based Fuse Group Investment Companies.\nConstruction of phase one of\nThe Arcadian\nwill be completed by the end of the year, panel member Eyal Peretz, founder of Fuse Group, said during a panel discussion of the Live Local Act at the ULI event last week. The Arcadian \u201cstarted as a non-Live Local project and went through some transformation, and we are going through a process right now where we are about to submit [it as] a Live Local project,\u201d Peretz said.\nAs elevated interest rates and construction costs slow residential development, the Live Local Act\u2019s incentives can make marginal projects more profitable, panelists said. The Live Local Act\u2019s incentives to developers to offer affordable and workforce housing include property tax breaks on apartments with below-market rents.\n\u201cEvery project we\u2019re looking at, we\u2019re looking at adding a Live Local component to it,\u201d said panelist Doron Broman, founder and CEO of Miami-based Moderno Development Group.\u00a0 \u201cMost projects don\u2019t pencil in today. So, with the Live Local Act that gives you additional income, that means, maybe, the project will pencil in.\u201d\n\nModerno started construction of Rivr Lofts, a 29-story, 352-unit apartment building in Fort Lauderdale, in 2022, prior to enactment of the Live Local Act. Construction is complete, and \u201cwe are looking right now at converting some of the units into the Live Local pool,\u201d Broman said. \u201cThe smaller studios seem to be a very good fit for that type of product.\u201d\nThe availability of Live Local units at Rivr Lofts would be limited to people who collect up to 120 percent of area median income. \u201cSo, we\u2019re talking about aiming units at people making around $90,000 a year,\u201d Broman said. \u201cA lot of our residents already fit that criteria, so it\u2019s worthwhile for us to lower the rent a little bit more and get the tax benefit.\u201d\nNot all residential developments are feasible as Live Local projects because blending market-rate apartments and below-market rate apartments in a mixed-income building is difficult, said panelist\nRussell Galbut\n, managing principal of Crescent Heights.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a small percentage, and that\u2019s because you have 60 percent of your building that has to pay for the other 40 percent,\u201d Galbut said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work in paper and pencil, it will never work in brick and mortar.\u201d\nGalbut said the biggest benefit of the state\u2019s Live Local Act is \u201cprompt and professional\u201d municipal approval of developments with affordable housing without a time-consuming review by a planning and zoning board or a city commission. \u201cTime kills many great projects,\u201d he said.\nMany lenders are hesitant to finance construction of mixed-income residential developments under the Live Local Act , Peretz said. \u201cWe see an issue with financing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping it\u2019s going to change \u2026. But I\u2019ve been hearing from a lot of developers with issues on that side of things.\u201d\u201cIt seems we need to get everybody on the same page and make sure \u2026 our cash flow matches with what the lenders are expecting,\u201d said Alfonso Costa Jr., chief operating officer of\nFalcone Group\nand moderator of the panel discussion. \u201cWorking with the takeout agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on takeouts, and then HUD as well, both on the new construction and takeout side, it\u2019s more of an educational process.\u201d",

Archer\u2019s air taxis will purportedly offer 10- to 20-minute flights between SoFi Stadium, LAX and various hubs from Santa Monica to Orange County.\nThe goal is to divert passengers from busy surface roads \u201cwhere it should take 30 minutes to get from point A to point B, but it takes an hour and a half,\u201d VertiPorts by Atlantic CEO Kevin Cox told the Times. \u201cSouthern California area has got a lot of challenges in terms of congestion on the roadway.\u201d\nAs for where the vertiports could be created across Southern California, Cox predicted we will see \u201ctwo or three dozen scattered around the market that will truly transform how people move through and between cities.\u201d Santa Monica, downtown L.A. and Culver City, then, could be prime targets.\nThose worried about safety shouldn\u2019t fret, as professional pilots will be charged with flying the eVTOL vehicles, not everyday people like George Jetson.\n\nStill, because eVTOLs are such a new technology, there are no FAA regulations on how they can be used.\n\u201cThe real challenge for these is getting local land use entitlements,\u201d Mike Condon Jr., a commercial property broker with Cushman &amp; Wakefield, told the Times. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere in zoning codes that says how flying taxis can take off.\u201d\nAtlantic Aviation already operates a network of private plane terminals at airports across the countries, with more than 100 across North America including at LAX,\nSanta Monica Airport\n, Hollywood Burbank Airport and Long Beach Airport. Those could eventually also double as eVTOL takeoff and landing sites.\n\u201cWe expect a lot of travel will start from those,\u201d Condon said. \u201cLeave from the airport and don\u2019t fight traffic.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Notorious deed thief Sanford Solny is in jail after allegedly violating his probation.\nOn Tuesday, Solny was remanded to custody during a probation hearing in Queens, the New York Times\nreported\n. The 68-year-old is expected to remain in jail until the court\u2019s adjournment concludes in a little more than a month.\nSolny was sentenced to five years of probation in 2019 after pleading guilty to possession of stolen property. He allegedly violated that probation within months after committing another deed theft.\nThis summer, Solny was convicted of stealing 11 homes. He was allowed to be free ahead of his sentencing in the case, which is expected to unfold in Brooklyn this month.\nIt appears Solny wasn\u2019t expecting to be taken to jail when he attended his probation hearing, since he did not have his medicine for high blood pressure in hand, according to one of his lawyers. He added that it was insensitive for him to be taken into custody directly before Yom Kippur.\n\nSolny was known to lure owners in by offering to arrange a short sale, where owners in financial distress sell their home under lender-approved terms for less than they owe on their mortgage. In return, the lender drops the foreclosure action and forgives the balance of the mortgage. After the short sale, however, Solny\u2019s victims \u2014 often Black or Latino families \u2014 would emerge still carrying debt.\nSolny would also tell homeowners that lenders required them to vacate a property for a short sale to occur. They would vacate and he would transfer the deed to himself and start collecting rent on existing tenants or those he brought in.\nWhen the tricked owners would ask what was happening with the sale, he would allegedly tell them negotiations were pending.\nDeed theft is challenging to prosecute, as intent needs to be shown and victims typically sign legally-binding documents, allowing perpetrators to frame schemes as legal business deals.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "You won\u2019t find a more pro-housing politician in the city than Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso. But you wouldn\u2019t know it from his appointee on the City Planning Commission.\nJuan Osorio has repeatedly voted against major housing initiatives.\nLast year, Osorio\nopposed\nCity of Yes for Economic Opportunity \u2014 the only one of the 13 commissioners to do so. But he was just getting warmed up.\nSix months later, he\nvoted against\nthe City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, which at the time was estimated to create 110,000 homes. The City Council later whittled it down to 82,000.\nThis year, Osorio has\nvoted no\non rezonings of Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, Midtown South in Manhattan and downtown Jamaica in Queens, which together should spur 27,000 new homes. The three initiatives passed by a combined vote of 33-5. Only Public Advocate Jumaane Williams\u2019 appointee, self-described Marxist\nLeah Goodridge\n, voted with Osorio.\nIn a moment of weakness, Osorio did vote for the Bronx Metro-North Station Area rezoning, which is projected to add 7,000 units. But otherwise, Reynoso\u2019s representative has been on a rejection rampage.\nOsorio\u2019s remarks at Planning Commission meetings indicate he\u2019s on a quixotic quest for perfection. He wants every conceivable impact studied, not a single manufacturing job displaced and rents affordable to anyone with two nickels to rub together.\nThis kind of thinking is\nWhy Nothing Works\n, as Marc Dunkelman\u2019s new book by that title explains. The author is among many thought leaders urging fellow liberals to prioritize results over process and protectionism.\nOsorio hasn\u2019t gotten the message.\nThe problem with creating fantastically affordable apartments on paper is they don\u2019t materialize in bricks and mortar. The problem with studying everything to death is nothing gets done. The problem with zoning to protect jobs is they inevitably vanish anyway and new ones can\u2019t move in.\nTake the Midtown South rezoning. Osorio\ncast the only \u201cno\u201d vote\n, saying that in a \u201cworst-case scenario,\u201d 5,300 jobs would be displaced from the Garment District.\nAn environmental impact statement had deemed that possible result insignificant. In a borough with 4 million daily workers, a rezoning that displaces 0.1 percent of them in 15 years is hardly a job-killer.\n\u201cBut these are New Yorkers,\u201d Osorio said of the 5,300 hypothetical displacements, \u201cwho rely on these jobs to be able to afford housing in the city.\u201d\nAs a former senior planner at the Municipal Art Society, Osorio must know the Garment District\u2019s manufacturing zoning was preserved for decades by well-meaning politicians, yet nearly all of its textile jobs relocated or disappeared anyway. Buildings aged and emptied out.\nHad the city rezoned long ago, billions more dollars would have been invested in Midtown South real estate, replacing those lost jobs and then some.\nOsorio made the same argument about manufacturing jobs when he\nvoted against the Jamaica rezoning\n, which is expected to create 12,000 homes, including 4,000 affordable.\n\nI get the need for some manufacturing in the city, which is why Mayor Mike Bloomberg carved out Industrial Business Zones. But, pre-Bloomberg, ample industrial zoning did not stop the number of manufacturing jobs from plunging from 1 million to 157,000 in half a century.\nToday,\njust over 50,000\nremain. Osorio\u2019s insistence on saving every one makes no sense in a world where technology constantly improves, destroying some jobs and creating others.\nThe city must ensure zoning allows for this evolution. There will be losers, yes, but far more winners. Omelets can\u2019t be made without breaking eggs.\nReynoso agrees with Osorio on industrial policy. The borough president believes the city could create enough housing in residential areas without touching manufacturing districts.\n\u201cFifty percent of Brooklyn hasn\u2019t built any housing since 1968,\u201d he said in a phone interview, citing Sheepshead Bay, Bay Ridge and Canarsie as among the laggards.\nBut the politics of upzoning there are difficult. The city can\u2019t rely on southern Brooklyn and eastern Queens to create the\n500,000 homes it needs\n.\nReynoso does differ with his appointee, Osorio, on some things. The borough president endorsed City of Yes, urging its housing goals be expanded, not shrunk by rent caps.\n\u201cWe need to be realistic about what City of Yes for Housing Opportunity is and what it is not,\u201d he said last year. \u201cIt is not an affordability strategy.\u201d\nTwo months later, his appointee\nvoted against it\n, citing \u201cthe lack of affordability mandates.\u201d\nLater, Osorio said the low-rent units mandated by Mandatory Inclusionary Housing were not enough for the Atlantic Avenue and Jamaica rezonings.\nWhen I asked Reynoso if Osorio had gone rogue, the borough president said his appointees are independent. \u201cI don\u2019t have any puppets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mayor\u2019s appointees are all rubber stampers. What Osorio is doing is making the Department of City Planning work. He\u2019s challenging them to do better.\u201d\nBut Osorio is making the perfect the enemy of the good. If every planning commissioner were like him, the city would spend even more time studying impacts, protecting jobs and freezing rents \u2014 and getting even less housing built.\nThis is the recipe for failure that Dunkelman and\nother progressives\nare urging the left to abandon. Reynoso appears to be listening.\n\u201cThe progressives are leading the pro-housing movement,\u201d he said. \u201cThe progressives used to be the problem. They were scared of gentrification. But we got new data.\u201d\nYet Reynoso\u2019s appointee keeps asking for more. It\u2019s classic paralysis by analysis \u2014 a demand for Utopia that will never achieve it.\nWe got new data. What they show is we don\u2019t need more data. We need more housing.\n",

        "content": "L&amp;L Holding Company and Columbia Property Trust have landed two large retail tenants at their Terminal Warehouse office and retail redevelopment in West Chelsea.\nEquinox\ninked a 50,000-square-foot long-term lease across the lower three floors of the full-block development at 261 11th Avenue,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned. The asking rent and lease length are unknown.\nMeanwhile, Convene Hospitality Group inked a 50,000-square-foot lease across the same three floors in a different section of the historic building, where it will open an event space called The Mallory. The name is a nod to the original architect of the 1890s building, George Mallory, the company said in a press release.\nOffice tenants will have access to the lounge and conference center, which are slated to open next year. The CHG deal was first reported by the\nNew York Post\n.\nEquinox and CHG are the first new retail tenants since the\n$1.8 billion transformation\nof the late-19th-century 1.3-million-square-foot landmark warehouse into offices, retail space, food and beverage areas as well as other indoor and outdoor amenities. Both will be accessible from the building\u2019s 700-foot tunnel, which was originally used by freight trains shuttling goods between the Hudson River and the railroad system.\nThe building, which is nearing completion, will have 12 floors of office space around a central courtyard.\n\nNewmark\u2019s Jeff Roseman represented Equinox. CBRE\u2019s Rocco Laginestra represented CHG. A Cushman &amp; Wakefield team including Alan Schmerzler, Catherine Merck and Sean Moran represented the landlord in both deals.\nA representative for the landlord declined to comment on the Equinox lease. Equinox did not respond to requests for comment.\nL&amp;L and Normandy Real Estate Partners purchased the building for $880 million in 2018. Columbia entered the picture when it\nacquired Normandy\nin 2019. Two years later, the developers secured a $1.25 billion\nconstruction loan\n, among the largest real estate loans made during the pandemic.\nDespite finding themselves in an unprecedented market due to Covid, the developers plowed ahead with the redevelopment, aiming to bring more than 1 million square feet of office space online in a few years.\nTheir bet could pay off. The tides have begun turning for the Manhattan office market. After\nfinishing last year\non a high note, office leasing volume surpassed 30 million square feet for the year in the third quarter, blowing past pre-Covid levels and marking the strongest period of year-to-date demand since 2002, according to Colliers.\n",

        "content": "A failed flip on the Upper East Side has ensnared a once-busy developer.\nRussian-born developer and art collector Janna Bullock is accused of defaulting on an $8 million loan backed by 14 East 82nd Street, a 9,500-square-foot prewar townhouse she once owned and converted into a single-family home, according to a complaint filed Thursday in Manhattan Supreme Court. The lawsuit also names the property\u2019s owner, Zoya Kuznetsova, as a defendant, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe debt was issued by Antonia Ventures LLC, a shell company linked to Downtown Investment Advisory, a White Plains-based asset manager. The suit claims no payments have been made since February. Bullock personally guaranteed the loan, which means she\u2019s on the hook even though she sold the building more than a decade ago.\nBullock bought the six-story property for $12.2 million in 2006 from Aby Rosen\u2019s RFR Holding, intending to gut-renovate it into a single residence. But construction stalled, leaving the property boarded up with a stop-work order still in place.\nIn 2012, she unloaded the townhouse at a loss for $9.1 million to Kuznetsova, a close associate who, according to society photos and past filings, has family ties to Bullock\u2019s ex-husband, Alexey Kuznetsov, a former Russian government official.\nKuznetsova has since struggled to keep the building out of foreclosure. Last year, the property narrowly avoided auction after she secured emergency financing \u2014 the same loan now in dispute. The lender\u2019s complaint signals that the lifeline may have run out.\n\nBullock, a onetime Guggenheim board member known for flipping Gilded Age townhouses into luxury single-family homes, was among the Upper East Side\u2019s most active redevelopers in the mid-2000s.\nHer projects included 54 East 64th Street, the onetime New York Observer offices, which she bought for $9.5 million in 2004 and resold for $18.7 million two years later, and 9 East 67th Street, which she flipped for roughly $25 million in 2009.\nBullock and Kuznetsov were\nconvicted in absentia\nby a Russian court in 2018 for allegedly embezzling public funds, though both denied the charges.\nKuznetsov was extradited from France to serve his sentence; Bullock remains abroad.\nNeither Bullock nor Kuznetsova could be reached for comment.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The seller was the prominent multifamily real estate investment trust AvalonBay Communities.\nA Newmark team including Adam Spies, Dan O\u2019Brien and Adam Doneger represented AvalonBay in the deal, which worked out to $417,000 per unit.

The properties spent 121 days on the market, on average.\nForty-two luxury listings were added to the market, for a total of 1,152 listings.\nThe\nprevious week\n, buyers signed contracts for 20 properties in Miami-Dade, asking a combined $162.6 million.\nThe asking dollar volume for the nine single-family homes and eight condos under contract last week totals $190.4 million, according to the report, which is authored by the Douglas Elliman team led by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes.\n\nThe single-family homes that entered into contract last week have an average asking price of $15.8 million and spent an average of 112 days on the market. They total $142.6 million in asking dollar volume.\nThe teardown at 1821 West 27th Street in Miami Beach topped the report. The 6,860-square-foot home, built in 1940, sits on a 0.6-acre lot with 150 feet of water frontage, according to the listing. The\nSunset Islands\nII house is on the market with Compass agent John Sandberg. Property records show Mark and Patricia Jaffe paid just $1.15 million for the seven-bedroom, seven-bathroom house in 1989.\nThe condos that secured buyers last week have an average asking price of $6 million and spent 131 days on the market, on average. They total $47.8 million in asking dollar volume, or an average of $2,333 per square foot.\nA 3,247-square-foot condo at One\nPark Grove\nin Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove went under contract. The four-bedroom, five-bathroom and one half-bathroom unit at 2811 South Bayshore Drive is asking $8.1 million. Unit 4A previously sold for $4.1 million in 2021. The luxury condo tower was completed in 2020.\nLast week in New York, buyers signed contracts for 29 homes, according to the latest\nOlshan\nreport. Their combined asking price is $286.6 million, and the typical home spent 912 days on the market.\n",

        "content": "The\nrichest real estate developer\nin America didn\u2019t spend a lot of words in cutting off one of his sons amid allegations of a high-flying con job in Beverly Hills.\nDonald Bren\n, chairman and owner of\nIrvine Company\n, issued a 12-word rebuke of son David, who has been embroiled in an alleged fraud scandal, the Daily Mail\nreported\n.\n\u201cWe do not have a personal or business relationship with this individual,\u201d the elder Bren said in a statement.\nDavid Bren allegedly bilked investors out of millions for an apparent private members\u2019 club in Beverly Hills called The Bunker, per the Daily Mail. The 33-year-old son of the 92-year-old real estate titan purportedly used his famous last name to lure investors to the $90 million club that never materialized.\nFour separate lawsuits accuse David Bren of fraud, defaulting on leases, forging luxury lifestyle appearances and trespassing into a Beverly Hills home to live without paying rent. Judgments against the embattled real estate heir total approximately $2.6 million and could continue to grow.\nBren has not appeared in court or retained attorneys in the Bunker cases, and as of now has not faced any criminal charges despite referrals to the Los Angeles Police Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nBren promised buyers of memberships access to a $50 million fleet of supercars including Bugattis, Ferraris and Porsches, as well as amenities including luxury restaurants and exclusive wine and private smoking lounges. Angled as a \u201cSoHo House for car lovers,\u201d Bren dropped names of notable figures such as Mark Cuban and Larry Ellison, claiming them as founding members of the $14,500-per-month club.\nWhile The Bunker, backed by the Bren name, attracted interest, investors began filing lawsuits once they picked up a scent of deception.\n\u201cThe Bunker does not exist. There is no ultra-high end automotive club. There are no members. The business is a mirage,\u201d one lawsuit alleges, according to the Daily Mail.\nBren has deployed his links to his father in pursuing prior real estate deals, sources have said.\n\n\u201cHe presented like he could have picked up the phone and called his father right away,\u201d Chris Rising, whose real estate firm was involved in David\u2019s attempts to buy\nMr. C\u2019s\nCameo Beverly Hills hotel, said, per the Daily Mail.\nThe Brens\u2019 relationship \u2014 at least on the surface \u2014 wasn\u2019t as cordial as it seemed.\n\u201cHe was slick. He played this, like, victim; that\u2019s how he pulled people\u2019s heartstrings. \u2018My dad didn\u2019t give me nothing; I could do this, but no one believes in me,\u2019\u201d Mike Tran, a friend of one allegedly defrauded investor,\ntold\nthe Los Angeles Times.\nIn total, more than a dozen investors claim they sunk hundreds of thousands and even millions of money into The Bunker after falling for David Bren\u2019s purported shtick. They were seemingly swayed by him arriving for property tours in a Lamborghini and hosting luxury events he claimed were sponsored by Louis Vuitton.\nInvestor Tony Chen was among those buying what Bren was selling. He put hundreds of thousands of dollars to the venture, but eventually died by suicide in 2022 at the age of 46, according to reports.\nTran believes it was a result of Bren\u2019s actions.\n\u201cTony built out this thing for this guy like, \u2018Oh man, he\u2019s this underdog. He\u2019s this David. And if he gets this right, he\u2019s going to become Goliath,\u2019\u201d Tran told the Times.\nDonald Bren has been married three times and has seven children, according to reports.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Anyone looking for a 5,000-square-foot waterfront spaceship house is in luck with this Mettawa listing.\nThe 3-bedroom, 3-bathroom geodesic concrete home is perched on a private pond surrounded by 5.35 acres of wooded trails nestled between two nature preserves, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. The home at 25421 North\nSaint Mary\u2019s Road\nis on a private listing network for $3.25 million, or $626 per square foot.\nMettawa is known for its horse farms and low\nturnover\n, which keeps inventory tight. Listing agent Donna Mercier of\nColdwell Banker\nRealty told the outlet that homes there typically trade below $6.25 million and attract buyers looking for privacy close to Chicago\u2019s\nNorth Shore\n.\nThe \u201cSpaceship House\u201d was built in 1979 by Peter M. Vanderklaauw, who built several UFO-shaped houses.\nWhen seller Bob Hollar first pulled into the driveway of a white, circular home in Mettawa nearly 30 years ago, his first thought was less admiration than disbelief, he told the outlet.\nThat was 1996, when Hollar, a retired healthcare executive, bought the futuristic residence for $525,000 \u2014 largely for the one feature that did impress him: room for his 145-pound Leonberger dog. Over the years, the property grew on him. The pond, fruit trees and sprawling yard turned the oddball structure into a quiet retreat about 35 miles north of downtown Chicago.\n\nThe house evolved along with the seller\u2019s life. When Hollar\u2019s wife, Lisa Giles, moved in during the early 2000s, the couple embarked on renovations, beginning with the most radical move \u2014 removing an indoor pool that cut through the center of the two-level home. The couple replaced it with livable space, added wood floors, modernized the kitchen and reworked the outdoor areas with patios, landscaping and a small waterfall.\nThe property also features a bridge leading to an island in the pond, where the couple likes to drink wine by the firepit and listen to bullfrogs. Their expansive vegetable garden produces everything from beets to brussels sprouts, and for years, the grounds have been their weekend project and sanctuary.\nWith a new dog that doesn\u2019t travel well and a second home on Kiawah Island in South Carolina, Hollar and Giles said it was time to simplify.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Meyers Accesso plans a 200-unit apartment project in Fort Lauderdale\u2019s Cypress Creek neighborhood.\nMeyers Accesso, a joint venture between Aventura-based Meyers Group and Hallandale Beach-based Accesso, wants to develop the eight-story Avery Cypress Creek at 6210-6282 North Andrews Avenue, according to records and Meyers\u2019 website.\nAn entity tied to Meyers Accesso bought the 2.2-acre development site from Double Mountain Development Ventures, led by co-founders and co-CEOs Fred Burgess and Jack Flechner, according to records. The buyer borrowed\u00a0 $1.6 million for the site from Miami-based Sky 18 Capital.\nDave Preston and Jonathan Carter of Colliers represented the seller.\nAvery Cypress Creek will consist of one- and two-bedroom apartments, Meyers\u2019 website shows.\nThe site is in Uptown Urban Village, an area Fort Lauderdale officials and property owners have long targeted for more mixed-use development. The district is from McNab Road and the C-14 canal south to Northwest 57th Street, and from I-95 west to Powerline Road.\nIn 2019, Fort Lauderdale approved the master plan for the Uptown Urban Village.\nSince then, several developers have seized on the area. Grover Corlew is developing the 312-unit\nMayla Cypress\napartment project at 6261 Northwest Sixth Way. Last year, Fairfield Residential completed the seven-story, 295-unit Treo Apartments at 6500 North Andrews Avenue.\nAlso, Pinnacle wants to develop an affordable housing project with a\n100-unit building and a 96-unit building\nat 6250 North Andrews Avenue, according to Fort Lauderdale city records.\nMeyers Accesso\u2019s other South Florida projects include the 200-unit\nAvery Lake Worth\nwith two buildings completed last year at 3300 Boutwell Road in Lake Worth Beach. Last year, the joint venture paid\n$25 million\nfor the three-story Atrium at Broken Sound office building at 6111 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway in Boca Raton.\n\nThe Meyers Accesso joint venture was formed in 2022, according to Meyers\u2019 website.\nMeyers Group, led by CEO Alan Losada, is a developer and manager of market-rate and affordable apartments, as well as hotels and condominiums, according to its website. The firm was founded about a decade ago by the late Stuart I. Meyers, who died this summer at 83.\nMany of Meyers\u2019 multifamily projects are under its Avery brand. The firm develops much of its affordable housing by using low income housing tax credits, which are disbursed by the state.\nAccesso \u2013\u2013 led by Ariel Bentata, Moises Benzaquen and Claudio Dombey \u2013\u2013 was founded more than 20 years ago and has since owned and managed over $3.3 billion in properties, more than 18 million square feet of offices and more than 1,000 residential units nationwide, according to its website.\nIn January, Accesso paid\n$36.5 million\nfor the six-story Sawgrass Lake Center at 13450 West Sunrise Boulevard in Sunrise. The deal marked a 36.4 percent discount from the property\u2019s 2018 sale price.\nIn Chicago and Houston, Accesso has faced some\nheadwinds and financial woes\nfor its office holdings.\nSouth Florida\u2019s\nmultifamily\nmarket has calmed compared with the leasing and construction bonanza during the pandemic. Over the past year, slower in-migration and an oversupply of apartments have led to a drop in rents, slower leaseups and increased concessions.\nDevelopers starting projects now argue demand and rents will pick up again by the time they complete their buildings next year and in 2027.\nAlso in\nFort Lauderdale\n, Affiliated Development scored an\n$80 million\nconstruction loan in March for the eight-story The Era with 400 apartments at 2125 South Andrews Avenue. And Fuse Group is developing the eight-story Arcadian complex with 480 apartments and 15,000 square feet of retail at 640 Northwest Seventh Avenue.\n",

The contracts comprised 12 condos and 23 houses.\nDuring the first week of October last year, the\nborough saw 15 contracts signed for over $56 million\n, and it was the strongest opening to the month since Compass began publishing its reports in 2020.\nThe top contract last week went to a Brooklyn Heights townhouse at 42 Monroe Place asking almost $8.9 million.\nThe 26.5-foot-wide home spans over 6,400 square feet and is laid out as a two-family with duplex residences on the first two and top two floors. Built in 1913, the home has been in the same family for 45 years.\nThe bottom two floors hold a 3,600-square-foot four-bedroom home with a living room, gallery and formal dining room. An extension from the dining room leads into a modern windowed kitchen and separate pantry, along with a home office, casual dining room and adjacent sun room.\nThe third and fourth floors span 2,800 square foot, with a three-bedroom residence. The fourth floor has three bedrooms, including a primary suite.\n\nCorcoran\u2019s Leslie Marshall and Nick Hovsepian had the listing.\nThe second priciest contract last week went to a penthouse at 524 Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint asking almost $6 million. The home, which traded in an off-market deal, set the record for priciest condo sale in Greenpoint,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously\nreported\n.\nPurchased in 2019 for $1.9 million by Ronen Segev, who owns piano reseller Steinway Pianos, the home set the record for the most expensive condo sold in Greenpoint.\nSegev undertook a $2 million renovation of the 1,780-square-foot duplex overlooking McCarren Park, outfitting the home with a custom western cedar round hot tub, outdoor kitchen and a heated cabana with a retractable roof.\nThe home comes with two bedrooms, three bathrooms and 680 additional square feet of outdoor space.\nCompass\u2019 John Chubet, who had the listing, previously listed the apartment for $8 million in 2022 before taking it off the market at the start of 2024. Nest Seekers\u2019 Cornell Jones brought the buyer.\nHomes put into contract last week had a median asking price of $2.75 million and an average price per square foot of $1,206. On average, the homes went for their last asking price.\n",

        "content": "The fast-growing business of\nJack Harris and Michael Fahimian\nis now clocking over $76 million in Beverly Hills Flats deals this year with the duo\u2019s latest closing.\nThe Beverly Hills Estates agents confirmed the closing of 722 North Maple Drive this past week for $22.4 million, or about $2,571 per square foot. The duo represented a local family in its purchase of the home, while Keller Williams\u2019\nGary Gold\nwas the listing agent.\nThe off-market deal means Harris and Fahimian are now behind three of the five transactions in the tony Beverly Hills neighborhood that have closed above $20 million this year.\n\u201cWe have the market cornered,\u201d Fahimian boasted.\nThe\nHarris and Fahimian\nteam made their debut at\nNo. 20\non\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s recently released list of Los Angeles County\u2019s top 25 agents and teams, with 18 transactions totaling $200.8 million. The list reflects deals over $1 million recorded in the Multiple Listing Service between July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025.\n\u201cWe\u2019re noticing a lot of deals being done off market in the Flats,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe\u2019re also noticing a lot of deals selling fairly close to ask, within 10 percent of the asking price.\u201d\n\nThe two said several factors are at play to benefit the Flats, which gets its name from the largely level terrain and large lots comprising the neighborhood between Sunset and Santa Monica boulevards. Among them are neighborhood\u2019s amenities, including the school district, police and fire services, the two said. More recent events have further fueled the area\u2019s popularity.\nMeasure United to House L.A., the two-tiered tax that applies to all property sales within the city of Los Angeles, makes Beverly Hills a good alternative for anyone looking to avoid paying the assessment. There\u2019s also the more recent concern around obtaining insurance, especially post-January\u2019s wildfires.\n\u201cAnother thing that\u2019s huge is the ability to get good insurance in the Flats because it\u2019s out of a fire zone,\u201d Fahimian said. \u201cA lot of the large carriers are still writing insurance policies in the Flats, whereas they are completely out of certain fire zones in Los Angeles and don\u2019t even offer insurance.\u201d\nSo far in 2025, home sales in the Flats have crept up to as high as $27 million. That\u2019s the highest price so far this year for the neighborhood, with two properties tied for the designation.\nCarolwood Estates co-founder and CEO Drew Fenton was the listing agent on the first $27 million deal, which closed in February, at 620 North Beverly Drive. Fahimian and Harris represented the buyer in that transaction, which penciled out to about $2,558 per square foot.\nIn June, Harris and Compass\u2019 Jessica Pasternak represented the seller, while Harris and Fahimian negotiated on behalf of the buyer for 521 North Canon Drive. The deal was recorded as closing for $27 million, or $1,641 per square foot. However, the buyer paid an additional $1 million for the property\u2019s furniture, according to the duo.\n",

        "content": "AvalonBay Communities is offloading a 243-unit apartment building near Golden Gate Park.\nThe Virginia-based company listed its Sunset Towers development for sale and has received bids of more than $100 million for the complex, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. A sale at that price would be $411,000 per unit. The property at 6-8 Locksley Avenue is under contract though a deal has yet to close.\nThe potential deal is a sign that multifamily investors are ready to bet on San Francisco again amid an increase in rents and artificial intelligence jobs in the city.\nA 332-square-foot studio apartment at Sunset Towers is advertised at $3,320, which is $10 per square foot. A one-bedroom is listed for $6.60 per square foot. The average rent price in San Francisco is just under $4.50 per square foot, according to Apartments.com.\nRents for Class A apartments in San Francisco are up 8.8 percent year-over-year, according to CBRE. Class B and C properties, meanwhile, have seen a growth of about 5.5 percent. Demand is reportedly being driven by tech workers, especially those in AI and related fields.\nThe data appears to support the idea of an AI-linked bounceback. For nearly two years, between mid-2022 and 2024, San Francisco had no sales of 100-plus-unit apartment developments, as investors weren\u2019t convinced the city was humming back to life.\n\nAvalonBay has believed for months that the\nAI boom is behind rising apartment rents\nacross the city. Housing demand has increased amid\nreturn-to-office mandates\n, improved public safety and AI-dominated job growth, according to AvalonBay COO Sean Breslin.\n\u201cAI is certainly a big part of that,\u201d Breslin told investors in May of the upward pricing trend, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nAvalonBay president and CEO Benjamin Schall told investors last month that sales across its portfolio could increase as rents and property values pick up.\nInvestors will likely be drawn to existing multifamily properties instead of sinking money into new construction. More than\n20,000 apartment units\nin San Francisco are in limbo as projects face years of delays or dissolve entirely. Last year, just 1,453 housing units were completed and plans were filed for 2,541 new homes, down from more than 5,000 delivered in 2020.\nAvalonBay\nowns nearly 3,400 apartments in San Francisco with a value of about $1.2 billion.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A slice of Panther Island could soon go vertical.\nThe City of Fort Worth will consider rezoning 15.4 acres near downtown to allow buildings as tall as 15 stories, paving the way for denser development on the long-stalled waterfront district. The proposed zoning covers land between North Commerce Street and the future Ring Road, and between Northeast Fourth and Fifth streets, near the Coyote Drive-In site at 223 NE Fourth Street, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The Fort Worth Zoning Commission is set to consider the case this week, with a City Council vote expected Oct. 21.\nThe change would bring density to an area largely limited to five-story projects, permitting taller towers and smaller structures within mixed-use developments, in alignment with the city\u2019s form-based code and canal-focused master plan.\nThe city has been pushing for years to activate the mostly underdeveloped 500-acre Panther Island, which spans public and private parcels just north of downtown. The\nproject\n\u2014 envisioned as a sprawling\ndistrict\nwith investments exceeding $1.1 billion \u2014 will also require new canal systems in order to mitigate flooding.\nThe canal network is central to the district\u2019s long-promised transformation, connecting two forks of the Trinity River north of NW 8th Street, according to a 234-page report issued last year by Consultant HR&amp;A Advisors and San Antonio-based Lake Flato architects. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers secured\n$403 million\nto aid flood control in 2023, opening up Panther Island to development.\nThe\nreport\nidentified areas of the north island\u2019s interior that could be developed before flood control improvements are in place.The consultant divided Panther Island into zones to prioritize development.\n\nThe first phase could focus on 12 acres along North Main Street, designated as a high-impact area for early development, and recent zoning changes have included increasing height limits to 20 stories and removing restrictions on building floor plate sizes.\nThe city aims to attract higher-density, transit-oriented growth to Panther Island. The study called access and connectivity to the island \u201cnotably inadequate,\u201d citing fragmented pedestrian infrastructure, including a lack of access to the Trinity Trail system.\nSusan Alanis, Panther Island program director for the Tarrant Regional Water District, told council members last month that the rezoning sets the stage for the first phase of canal construction, slated to start next year.\nA request for quotes from developers to design and build the canal system is expected to open this fall. The project is seen as a critical catalyst for private investment, which has been slow to materialize since the Encore apartments \u2014 a 300-unit complex with its own man-made waterway \u2014 were delivered in 2018.\nCity leaders have been methodically revising zoning across Panther Island to encourage higher-density construction. Last year, the council approved a change along North Main Street that lifted height caps to 20 stories and removed floor-plate limits for taller towers.\nIf approved, the latest rezoning could position the northeast section of the island for early redevelopment as\nFort Worth\nfinally moves from planning to pouring concrete.\n",

        "content": "The day after Mayor Eric Adams dropped his re-election bid, real estate donors turned to Andrew Cuomo.\nThe latest filings with the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board show that industry professionals gave more than $32,000 to Cuomo on Sept. 29, one day after Adams announced that he was suspending his campaign. When including donations given to Cuomo\u2019s campaign the day of\nthe mayor\u2019s announcement\n, that number climbs to roughly $41,000.\nThat\u2019s more than half of the $77,700 he took in from industry donors between Aug. 19 and Sept. 29, according to a\nTRD\nanalysis of campaign finance filings that included different real estate sectors, including development, property ownership/management, commercial, residential, architecture and construction. These totals include donors who self-reported working in the real estate industry or could otherwise be easily identified in filings.\nThe industry donations were part of a rush of contributions after Adams\nabandoned his campaign\n. During this reporting period, Cuomo received $895,000 in donations (when accounting for contributions that were refunded), with $380,000 coming in on Sept. 28 and 29.\nReal estate donors who gave the maximum of $2,100 in the six-week filing period include: A&amp;H Acquisitions\u2019\nAlex Adjmi\n, investor Yaacov Amar, Crown Acquisitions\u2019 Richard Chera, Coldwell Banker broker Emily Becker and United American Land principals (and brothers) Jody, Jason and Albert Laboz.\nRepublican donor and Florida developer Alan Keen, who was also\ninvolved\nin the Florida chapter of No Labels, a centrist group that pursued but eventually\nabandoned\nplans to nominate a third-party presidential candidate, also gave $2,100, as did Michigan-based shopping mall developer Robert Taubman.\n\nA few members of the Cayre\nfamily\ndonated on Sept. 29, including Cayre Equities\u2019 Ken Cayre, who gave $400 and Aurora Capital Associates\u2019 Robert Cayre, who donated $250. Aurora President Jared Epstein was one of several people who sent out an email\ncalling for donations\nto Cuomo after Adams dropped out of the race. The email stressed the need to \u201cdefend NYC against radical socialist policies,\u201d referring to frontrunner Zohran Mamdani, who is a Democratic Socialist.\nMeanwhile, Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa brought in $423,700, of which at least $11,750 came from industry donors. Landlord Jerry Lebedowicz was the only real estate donor to give the full $2,100. M&amp;N Management\u2019s Nikitas Drakotos and Bronx landlord Alan Feurman each contributed $500.\nMamdani received more than $410,000 during the six-week filing period, with at least $2,500 coming from donors working in real estate. The most he received from industry donors during this period was a $500 contribution from an affordable housing developer based in Sacramento, Calif. Still, some industry leaders have\nsignaled\nthat they plan to work with Mamdani if he wins in November.\nBefore the Democratic primary last summer, Cuomo was the clear favorite among the real estate industry. A\nTRD\nanalysis\nin June found that people in the industry donated more $500,000 directly to this campaign. Following Mamdani\u2019s win, the industry\nremained split\non\nwho to back\n.\nEven with Adams out of the race, Cuomo faces an uphill battle.\nA September poll\nby the New York Times and Siena University found that in order for Cuomo to meaningfully chip away at Mamdani\u2019s double-digit lead, Sliwa would need to drop out of the race.\nAfter Cuomo lost the June primary, Adams saw a spike in donations from the real estate industry. Following the\nindictments\nof some of his top-ranking officials, he dragged even further in the polls, trailing fourth behind Sliwa. As a result,\ncontributions slowed\n. The latest filings show some industry donations trickled to his campaign, but most of the disclosure features refunds to previous real estate professionals.\n",

The full-floor apartment was one of 29 properties to find buyers between Sept. 29 and Oct. 5, up from 23 in the\nprevious period\n.\nThe building\u2019s developers \u2014 a group including Hines and Singapore\u2019s Pontiac Land Group \u2014 initially sought $51 million for the 6,400-square-foot pad in 2015, when they began marketing units off of floor plans. They dropped the asking price to just under $44 million when the apartment was listed on Streeteasy in 2017, before raising its price tag again four years later.\nThe home has four bedrooms and four bathrooms. It also features a corner great room and views of Central Park. Amenities in the 161-unit tower include a concierge, fitness center, lap pool and golf simulator.\nThe developers\ntapped Douglas Elliman\nto replace Corcoran Sunshine at the helm of sales at the project in 2021, following years of sluggish momentum and a series of controversial price cuts that pushed the developers into arbitration with each other. At the time, the building\u2019s projected sellout was lowered from more than $2 billion to $1.96 billion.\nElliman\u2019s Renee Micheli is the sales director at 53 West 53rd Street, with Elliman\u2019s Shari Scharfer Rollins, Jade Chan, Frances Katzen and Michelle Griffith all listed as representing the listing on Streeteasy.\n\nThe second most expensive home to snag an inked deal was a penthouse at Related Companies\u2019 520 West 28th Street, asking $35 million. The triplex last traded five years ago for $20 million, down from its initial asking price of\n$50 million\nin 2015.\nUnit PH37, which was redesigned by the seller, has five bedrooms, five bathrooms and 2,600 square feet of outdoor space spread between a balcony and roof terrace. The condo also features a great room overlooking the High Line, a hot tub and cold plunge pool.\nAmenities at the Zaha Hadid-designed building include a pool, garage, spa and fitness center.\nCompass\u2019 Hudson Advisory Team, including co-founders Clayton Orrigo and Stephen Ferrara and agent Arran Patel, had the listing.\nOf the 29 properties, 21 were condos, five were co-ops and three were townhouses.\nThis week\u2019s homes\u2019 combined asking price was $287 million, for an average price of $9.9 million and a median of $6 million. The typical home spent about two and a half years on the market and was discounted 9 percent from the original listing price.\n",

The vote affirms a previous decision by the Los Angeles City Planning Commission to allow the development to proceed.\nUnder Vermont Real Estate\u2019s plan, the car wash, located near Barnsdall Art Park at the busy intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and North Vermont Avenue, would be replaced by a seven-story building with 139 studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments. The ground floor would feature a grocery store and residents would have access to parking for 145 vehicles.\nBecause of its proximity to the Vermont/Sunset Metro station, the approved plans for the project include Transit Oriented Communities\naffordable housing\nincentives, clearing the way to build a larger building than zoning rules would normally allow. The developer would have to set aside 16 of the new apartments for affordable housing for extremely-low-income Angelenos. For one person to\nqualify\n, they would have to make $31,850 or less annually; a household of four would be limited to an income of $45,450.\nDesigns are being handled by Daryoush Safai, per Urbanize. The contemporary podium building would come with an outward-facing courtyard against Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nThe Supporters Alliance for Environmental Responsibility (SAFER), an affiliate of Laborers International Union of North America Local 270 (LIUNA),\nfiled an appeal\nagainst the project that led to its latest bureaucratic snag. That appeal came after a previous one before the Planning Commission in October 2024 was rejected. In its most recent attempt, SAFER urged the Planning Commission to pause the proposed development to allow for further environmental study.\nVermont Real Estate\u2019s development would join two other mixed-use complexes near Barnsdall Art Park.\nLaTerra Development\nrecently completed two buildings next to the park at 4850 and 4900 Hollywood Boulevard, while Lazer Properties is building an 86-unit complex with ground-floor retail across the street from the park at 4773 Hollywood Boulevard, according to Urbanize.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The 188 planned residences start in the $400,000s, with completion expected in 2027 or 2028, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. Indianapolis-based Flaherty &amp; Collins is building The Franklin, a $100 million mixed-use tower near the new train station that\u2019s set to open in 2026.\nThe momentum follows last year\u2019s completion of a second Metra South Shore Line track and new station, which cut the train ride to Chicago to about an hour. The improved commute has made\nMichigan City\nviable for professionals\npriced out\nof the city but unwilling to give up its amenities \u2014 a zoo, a lighthouse, outlet shopping and a casino \u2014 or its proximity to the Indiana\nDunes\nNational Park, which draws about 3 million visitors annually.\nDevelopers\nare taking note. Deron Kintner of Flaherty &amp; Collins told the outlet that Michigan City has character.\n\n\u201cWith the speed to get to Chicago and back, we think it\u2019s going to be very desirable to live in,\u201d Kintner said.\nFarpoint Development\u2019s Scott Goodman said the town\u2019s mix of affordability and access makes it \u201calmost a suburb.\u201d\nMichigan City\u2019s renaissance does have hurdles. The coal plant and cooling tower looming over its lakefront is derided locally as \u201cthe monstrosity.\u201d Operator NIPSCO plans to close the facility by 2028 but may instead convert it to gas power.\nThe state prison nearby, also slated for closure, could eventually open prime redevelopment land. Mayor Angie Nelson Deuitch said the goal is to attract newcomers without pushing out residents.\n\u201cWe want industry, but tourism is a big part of who we are now,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Joseph Cayre told\nThe Real Deal\nin 2008, the job was initially essential for the family to survive financially, but eventually led to much of his future business success.\n\u201cYou would sell a lot of stuff, but you were really selling yourself,\u201d he said.\nThe Cayres launched various businesses, including factories that made pantyhose and eight-track cassette tapes, before charting a path in the entertainment industry.\n\nIn 1974, Stanley and his brothers founded Salsoul Records, a label credited with\nreleasing the first available 12-inch disco disc\n.

That being said, the playing field is still open, the two racinos may not clinch the deals \u2014 and it\u2019s also possible the Gaming Commission won\u2019t award all three licenses.\n\u201cThis is a tabula rasa,\u201d Brian O\u2019Dwyer, chair of the commission, said during a Sept. 30 meeting. \u201cThere are no front-runners or favorites.\u201d\nCohen, who is teaming up with Hard Rock International, wants to turn 50 acres of parking lots near Citi Field into a casino complex that includes a 1,000-key hotel, a 5,650-person live music venue and 25 acres of green space. The team has billed the project as a way to turn the Flushing, Queens, ballpark into a year-round destination and to keep Mets fans onsite after games.\nThe Bally\u2019s casino would be built on 16 acres of parking lots and practice-green area at Bally\u2019s Golf Links at Ferry Point. The project would include 500 hotel rooms and a 2,000-seat entertainment venue.\nThe golf course is city-owned land, which is managed by Bally\u2019s. The company acquired the golf course\u2019s lease from the Trump Organization in 2023. If it secures a casino license, as part of that 2023 deal, it must pay Trump $115 million,\naccording to the New York Times\n.\nThe state\u2019s Gaming Facility Location Board is expected to decide who receives a casino license by Dec. 1. The state Gaming Commission will then issue the licenses before the end of the year.\nUnlike\nthe Community Advisory Committees that eliminated four of the eight casino proposals last month \u2014 which were supposed to determine the projects\u2019 fates based on the input of the nearby neighborhoods, but members often appeared beholden to the politicians who appointed them \u2014 the board has specific criteria for evaluating the projects. The body will consider four different categories, with \u201ceconomic activity and business development\u201d carrying the most weight (making up 70 percent of each proposal\u2019s score).\n\nThat category includes a project\u2019s estimated revenue and taxes, as well as the number of jobs it will create and how much these employees will be paid. Other factors in this category include how quickly the casino can be built and proof that it can be fully financed.\nMetropolitan Park is larger than Bally\u2019s and is expected to bring in more revenue and annual taxes. The team has said that the site is shovel-ready, and construction will begin in January if it obtains the license in December. The project is expected to be complete by June 2030, according to the team\u2019s application.\nConstruction on Bally\u2019s would begin eight to nine months after receiving a license.\nThe other categories, worth 10 percent each, include local impact siting, workforce enhancement and diversity framework. The first pertains to ways the project teams are working to minimize the impact of their projects on surrounding communities and how they will work with and promote local businesses. The last two focus on various aspects of employee hiring, training, retention and diversity.\nThis information is laid out in the teams\u2019 applications, to varying degrees. Some details, including financing, are not readily available, given that the applications are heavily redacted. Metropolitan Park\u2019s application states, however, that the development team will use a combination of debt and equity to finance construction of the project, noting that if it faces any unexpected challenge in lining up debt, \u201cthe partners are financially stable enough to raise the additional capital.\u201d\nHere\u2019s how Bally\u2019s and Metropolitan Park\u00a0stack up. The breakdowns are not exhaustive and only include factors that can be easily compared, i.e. numbers.\n",

        "content": "Barstool Sports owner Dave Portnoy bought a waterfront mansion in Islamorada setting a record for home sales in the\nFlorida Keys\n.\nPortnoy paid $27.8 million for the 1.7-acre property at 76180 Overseas Highway in Islamorada, sources confirmed to\nThe Real Deal.\nProperty records show Tom and Caryl Donatucci sold the eight-bedroom, nine-and-a-half bathroom compound, which spans more than 10,200 square feet of interior space.\nThe Donatuccis paid $2.3 million for the property in 2019. The mansion and guest house were completed last year. The couple is likely related to the Donatucci Kitchens &amp; Appliances family based in Pennsylvania.\nThe property was asking $31.2 million with Leslie Leopold and Cheri Tindall of Ocean Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. Serhant\u2019s\nAngel Nicolas\nrepresented the buyer.\nLeopold and Nicolas declined to comment on the buyer\u2019s identity in the purchase, which was first reported by the\nWall Street Journal\n.\n\nThe property features 150 feet of private water frontage, including a dock, boat ramp, beach and two pools, according to the listing. It includes a 7,600-square-foot main house and a 2,700-square-foot guest house.\nThe previous record home sale in the Florida Keys was the $23 million trade of an Islamorada mansion called Palm Harbor.\nPortnoy also owns a home in Miami. He paid\nnearly $14 million\nfor a nine-bedroom, eight-and-a-half-bathroom house in Miami\u2019s Morningside in 2021, then a record for the neighborhood. Before he acquired his Miami home, Portnoy was\nreportedly\nrenting Floyd Mayweather Jr.\u2019s former Miami Beach house for $200,000 a month.\nPortnoy founded Barstool Sports, then a sports and gambling blog company, in 2003. In 2022, majority stakeholder Chernin Group announced it was selling 50 percent of Barstool to Penn National Gaming, in a deal that valued the company\nat $450 million\n. But Portnoy bought the digital media company back from Penn Entertainment for $1 in 2023, as part of a larger deal that included a brand licensing agreement with ESPN. Barstool is based in Chicago.\n",

        "content": "The former headquarters of Zendesk is now under lender control.\nLenders have seized ownership of the 77,225-square-foot 1019 Market Street building at a foreclosure auction, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The unnamed entities placed the winning bid at $10.3 million after the borrower stopped making payments on a $33.5 million loan backed by the property.\nPrior to the lenders\u2019 purchase, the previous owner was 1019 Market Street LP, reported to be an affiliate of an investment fund managed by Deutsche Bank,\naccording\nto the Business Times. The ownership bought the property for $48.3 million, or $625 per square foot. A Morningstar appraisal in August placed the building\u2019s value at $14.7 million \u2014 a notable fall from its appraisal price of $71.4 million in 2019, according to Cred IQ\ndata\ncited by the Business Times.\nThe trustee,\nChicago Title Company\n, filed a notice of mortgage default in April on behalf of the lenders. The following month, lenders alleged in a lawsuit that the building owner stopped making its monthly payment on the $33.5 million loan linked to the building in February. The owner was identified as Deutsche asset management arm DWS. A month later, Chris Neilson of Trigild was appointed the building\u2019s receiver.\n\nZendesk\nsigned its lease for the 1019 Market building in 2013, a year before 1019 Market Street LP affiliate bought the building. In 2021, Zendesk paid $7 million to terminate its lease. The company exited the building in 2022 and\nplanted its flag at 181 Fremont Street\n; the 1019 Market building has been vacant ever since, aside from a retail tenant in a small ground-floor commercial space.\nHow the lenders proceed with the Mid-Market building after the\npurchase at foreclosure auction\nremains to be seen. They could move to sell the building to a new buyer at a lower price than was available to previous ownership. In doing that, a future owner would have more flexibility as to how to deal with and invest in the building.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The buyers were different LLCs that shared one commonality: their signing attorney, Scott Segal. The sellers of the higher unit were Chinese investment banker\nFenglei Fang\nand his wife\nSuning Fang\n, who had purchased their pad in 2018 for $13.2 million. The seller of the lower unit was\nWillow Oak Holdings LLC\n,\nwhich paid $11.8 million for their unit in 2018.\nCorcoran\u2019s\nDeborah Kern\nhad both listings.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe priciest commercial deal recorded in New York City was near Grand Central Station, where a 27-story office property at\n5 East 42nd Street\nsold for $135 million. The buyer was the\nVanbarton Group\n, and the seller was the\nMilstein family\u2019s\nNew York Private Bank &amp; Trust\n, which had owned the building for decades.\nVanbarton plans to convert the 375,000-square-foot property into a 500-unit apartment complex, according to\nCrain\u2019s\n.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nBonjour Capital\nscooped up floors three through 19 at\n1501 Voorhies Avenue\nin Sheepshead Bay for $74.2 million from\nAvalonBay Communities.\nThe portion that was sold covers about 172,000 square feet.

The buyer was an LLC tied to\nSlate Property Group\nand the seller was\nFrancis Moezinia\u2019s Rex Properties\n, which had taken over the property decades ago.

        "content": "The latest donation numbers are in for NYC\u2019s mayoral race.\nUnsurprisingly, some real estate folks threw money Andrew Cuomo\u2019s way after Mayor Eric Adams dropped out of the race.\nMore than half\nof the funds he received from industry folks were donated the day of and after Adams announced he would not seek reelection.\nHere are the totals (including campaign refunds this reporting period) from Aug. 19 to Sept. 29:\nAndrew Cuomo: $895,000\nFrom real estate: $77,700\nZohran Mamdani: $410,000\nFrom real estate: $2,500\nCurtis Sliwa: $423,700\nFrom real estate: $11,750\nMeanwhile, various political action committees continue to draw tens of thousands, in some cases hundreds of thousands, of dollars. A quick overview of the latest donations shows more of the same spending patterns among industry professionals and some surprises.\nNotably, Toll Brothers President David Von Spreckelsen gave $2,500 to OneNYC, a PAC backing Mamdani, just a few days before Adams abandoned his campaign. Within the industry, affordable housing developers appeared to be the first to publicly warm up to the idea of a Mamdani administration. Real estate trade group leaders have also said they\nexpect to work closely\nwith Mamdani if he becomes mayor.\nThe Solomon Organization, a New Jersey-based development firm, gave $35,000 to New Yorkers for a Better Future Mayor 25, an anti-Mamdani PAC, in September. Abro Management\u2019s Richard Scharf contributed $25,000 to the PAC in August, but the amount wasn\u2019t reported until last month. An LLC tied to Berndt Perl, co-founder of APF Properties, gave the PAC $2,500 in August, which was reported this month.\nElizabeth Tisch, married to Jon Tisch, CEO of Loews Hotels, gave pro-Cuomo PAC Fix the City $50,000 last month. In the lead-up to the primary, Fix the City raked in millions from real estate donors.\nKamson Corporation CEO Richard Kurtz donated another $50,000 this month to Anyone but Mamdani, a PAC formed by private investigator and\nformer\nAdams ally Bo Dietl. Kurtz gave the PAC $50,000 in August as well.\nJust days before Adams\u2019 exit, cryptocurrency billionaire Brock Pierce gave $1.1 million to Empower NYC, a super PAC backing Adams. Pierce apparently is urging Adams to change his mind,\nper the New York Daily News\n.\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nIf you could ask each of the mayoral candidates one real estate-related question, what would it be? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nThe\nNYC chapter of the League of Women Voters is endorsing most of the housing-related measures that will appear on the ballot Nov. 4. The group is not taking a position on the question that asks voters if an appeals board should take the place of the mayoral veto in the city\u2019s land use review process. Instead, the group has listed pros and cons of the measure\non its website\n.\nThe fight over the ballot questions continues this week with a press conference held by the City Council and various labor unions to \u201chighlight the misleading language and negative impacts\u201d of the questions. Open New York is holding its own rally next week to promote the proposals.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nNassau County Supreme Court Justice Bruce Cozzens on Monday upheld a local law that bans transgender women and girls from participating in women\u2019s sports at county-run facilities\n,\nGothamist reports\n. The New York Civil Liberties Union plans to appeal.\n\u2014 Mayor Eric Adams is in Albania this week to \u201cmeet with the prime minister, business and tech leaders, tour factories, and discuss new opportunities to boost economic activity and tourism to New York City,\u201d a City Hall spokesperson told\nNBC New York reports\n. The cost of the four-day trip is partially being covered by the Albanian government,\naccording to Gothamist\n. This comes exactly one week after Adams dropped his reelection bid \u2014 and roughly a year after the mayor was\nindicted\non corruption charges that included accepting travel benefits from Turkish officials. The charges were ultimately\ndropped\n.\n\u2014 ICYMI: Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop is in the running to take over for Kathryn Wylde as president of the Partnership for New York City,\nthe New York Post reports\n.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$16.2 million\nfor a condominium unit at 220 Central Park South. The 2,400-square-foot condo is a new construction unit.\nThe Corcoran Group\u2019s\nDeborah Kern had the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$168.6 million\nfor 113-117 West 24th Street in Chelsea.\nIn 2013\n, Gary Barnett sold the 270,000-square-foot site to John Lam, who redeveloped the parking garage space into two hotels.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$27.8 million\nfor a condo unit at 432 Park Avenue. The condo is 4,500 square feet. Peter Ashe has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 85,479-square-foot, 14-story, mixed-use building at 114 Bruckner Boulevard in the Bronx. Samuel Wieder of S. Wieder Architects is the applicant of record. \u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "Democrat Ben Chou is trying to unseat Republican City Council member Vickie Paladino in northeast Queens. Why should the industry care? Because competitive races reveal which way the pendulum is swinging on key real estate issues.\nOne thing is clear: Candidates do not see the housing shortage as a safe topic in single-family neighborhoods.\nPaladino, a Trump-style conservative, opposes any development that would change the character of her district. That fuzzy argument has been used by Republicans and Democrats alike against all manner of rezonings and projects \u2014 even accessory dwelling units.\nThe City of Yes for Housing Opportunity was a good example. It was explicitly designed to add a little housing in every community, but not the same amount in every community, to avoid changing their character.\nIt was proportional, meaning dense areas like Midtown South would get more units than low-scale neighborhoods such as College Point, Whitestone, Bayside, Douglaston and Little Neck, all of which Paladino represents. Yet Paladino railed against City of Yes.\nQueens politicians who are primarily polemicists (\nPaladino\n) or entertainers (Curtis Sliwa) portrayed City of Yes as The End of Queens as We Know It. I try to ignore Paladino\u2019s\npropaganda\nand Sliwa\u2019s\nshtick\n. The more oxygen they consume, the less there is for serious debate.\nFortunately, Paladino and her conservative colleagues were unable to sabotage City of Yes, which passed the Council 31 to 20 \u2014 not on partisan lines, but geographic ones. This\nCity Limits map\nshows a crescent-shaped swath of \u201cno\u201d votes across the farthest-from-Manhattan neighborhoods where, not coincidentally, the least housing has been built.\nChou cannot possibly be worse than Paladino on housing development. But will he be better? His website doesn\u2019t even mention the issue, although land use is the Council\u2019s most important power and the city has a severe housing shortage.\n\nThat\u2019s because a pro-development platform might well be suicidal for a Council District 19 candidate.\nWhat does play well there? Protecting large residential buildings from the city\u2019s\ncarbon emissions cap\n.\nChou\u2019s website says he will \u201csave co-ops from the burden of Local Law 97.\u201d His explanation: \u201cWe cannot fight climate change by putting the cost on the backs of working- and middle-class homeowners. Local Law 97 is an important and well-meaning law, but it places an unfair burden on co-ops and condos.\u201d\nChou proposes extending and expanding the J-51 tax break to help co-ops and condos reduce their emissions.\nPaladino \u2014 unlike Chou \u2014 opposes Local Law 97. But, realizing she cannot repeal it, she also wants a salve like J-51. She also introduced a bill in 2023 to\npush back Local Law 97\u2019s deadlines\nby seven years. (It didn\u2019t pass.)\n\u201cMy bill seeks to\nbuy time\n,\u201d she said then. \u201cYes, I\u2019m opposed to the law, but if it has to happen, we have to do it wisely. If we\u2019re going to push these drastic climate bills, it would be nice if there was a J-51 type of tax break.\u201d\nIt makes sense, politically, to offer help to co-ops and condos large enough to be subject to Local Law 97. Queens politicians love their co-ops and condos. Just don\u2019t ask them to allow any more to be built.\n",

        "content": "Tom Comforte is looking to cash out while the cranes are still swinging in Fulton Market.\nThe West Loop landowner put his site at 1240 West Carroll Avenue on the market, seeking to ride the apartment wave reshaping the corridor\u2019s western edge, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nComforte tapped CBRE brokers Tom Svoboda and Dominic Soltero to find a buyer for the parcel, which sits between two development sites owned by Sterling Bay, according to marketing materials. The property could yield up to 123 residential units on its own, or as many as 239 if a buyer also secures two small adjacent lots from Sterling Bay.\nThe listing comes as apartment developers swarm the former meatpacking district, betting on surging rents and long-term demand despite a tough financing climate.\nComforte, whose family once ran HVAC firm Climatemp out of Fulton Market before decamping to Broadview, has gradually offloaded holdings as the neighborhood evolved from industrial to mixed use hotspot.\nTwo major projects are already advancing nearby.\nSterling Bay\nis under contract to sell most of the 1200 West block of Carroll to developer Tom Roszak, who plans a\n29-story tower\nwith 398 apartments. One block west, Sterling Bay is shopping its site at\n1300 West Carroll\n, where the city signed off last year on a 700-unit proposal.\n\nRoszak told the outlet that Comforte\u2019s land was in play while he pursued his own deal but said the new listing won\u2019t alter his project, which still needs city council approval.\nEven with construction loans scarce and interest rates high, Fulton Market\u2019s housing pipeline keeps expanding. Chicago-based LG Group recently filed plans for a five-story, 66-unit building a few blocks south at\nKinzie and Racine\n, underscoring the neighborhood\u2019s resilience.\nComforte hasn\u2019t set an asking price for his Carroll Avenue property, and neither he nor Sterling Bay returned requests for comment. But with residential developers circling and the city\u2019s westward growth showing few signs of slowing, Comforte may find now is the right moment to sell.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n\n\n",

        "content": "San Francisco\u2019s Maiden Lane is slowly but surely\ncoming back to life\nafter years of shuttered storefronts and bleak financial outlooks.\nEmpty spaces at the pedestrian mall near Union Square, long a symbol of retail distress in downtown, have been filling up as local retailers and artificial intelligence startups move in, the San Francisco Standard\nreported\n.\nToy store owner Michelle O\u2019Connor, for example, is opening a location of her \u201cJust for Fun\u201d chain on Maiden Lane. Coincidentally, the outpost will be in the former Jeffrey\u2019s Toys store, the inspiration behind the \u201cToy Story\u201d films, which closed in January 2024 amid decreasing foot traffic\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a vibe shift happening in the area,\u201d O\u2019Connor told the Standard. \u201cThings are looking up, and we wanted to be part of that story.\u201d\nOther tenants have been moving in in recent months. A watch shop called Clicky Bezel and wedding boutique Chien &amp; Buffle have opened their doors. In August, a John Varvatos store debuted on the strip, joining other menswear shops like Suit Supply, which recently renewed its lease, and Hugo Boss, which is reportedly in the market for a Union Square space, including a potential Maiden Lane shop.\n\nRetailers aren\u2019t the only ones planting flags on Maiden Lane. Just as the\nartificial intelligence boom\nis\ngobbling up office space\nin the city, commercial spaces above the pedestrian street are attracting AI startups.\nEnterprise AI platform Writer, for example, moved this year into an upper-floor space.\nKaizen, another AI company, recently signed a lease for\nMaiden Lane offices\n. The price point for office space could be a draw for many firms. Class A offices in the Financial District lease for upwards of $65 per square foot, while offices in Union Square and Maiden Lane lease for $38 to $49 per square foot.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The purchase of Seattle-based Redfin closed in July, solidifying Rocket\u2019s plan to vertically integrate the process of buying, selling and financing homes.\n\u201cBy combining mortgage servicing and loan origination, along with home search through Redfin, we are paving the path for Americans to own the dream,\u201d CEO Varun Krishna said.\nThe merger with\nMr. Cooper\nunites two of the country\u2019s biggest mortgage players. Rocket is one of the largest originators in the U.S., while Mr. Cooper ranks as the nation\u2019s top mortgage servicer. Together, they\u2019ll manage more than $2.1 trillion in home loans \u2014 roughly one in every six mortgages nationwide.

The company cut about 2 percent of its\nworkforce\nin July, soon after closing the\nRedfin deal\n, citing redundant roles across overlapping divisions.\nRocket\u2019s move to dominate every stage of the housing market mirrors strategies by tech and financial giants chasing end-to-end control of consumer transactions.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The $900,000 remodel, designed by Chicago-based DXU Architects, will house 20 courts and make it one of the largest pickleball centers in the state.\nThe Picklr has also leased space for a 35,000-square-foot venue in District West, Ferguson Family Partners\u2019 $170 million mixed-use project rising in Cinco Ranch. That location is scheduled to open late next year.\nMore leasing opportunities are coming down the pike.

More than 500 franchise agreements have been sold across the U.S., including 16 locations across the Texas Triangle.\nWhile most clubs are franchised, the company keeps some corporate-run sites to test products and programs.

The average asking price works out to $5.7 million.\n\nThe most expensive listing to find a buyer is the townhouse at 175 Sunset Avenue in\nPalm Beach\n, asking $12.9 million.

Lurin Capital didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nThe guaranties were on loans tied to three Texas properties and 12 Florida properties. The Florida portfolio started being sold at foreclosure auctions in April. The loans tied to the properties totalled $383.6 million.\nVenetos is also fighting a\nrecent lawsuit from Select Securities Europe\n, a lender from Luxembourg that claims he defaulted on 15 loans totaling $40.5 million.\n\nVenetos launched Lurin Capital with his wife Ashley after he was axed by hedge fund Citadel. He told a podcast in 2022 that Lurin builds on his family\u2019s 60 years of experience in multifamily real estate.\nHe explained the pivot from finance: \u201cThe opportunity to extract outsize returns with a relatively manageable amount of risk was far greater in real estate.\u201d\nThe Venetoses launched Lurin in 2016 among a wave of upstart real estate operators who planned to make money by purchasing Class B apartment complexes, updating them, raising rents and selling them at a profit.\nLurin\u2019s website says the firm owns 46 properties across five states, but the list includes assets that have faced foreclosure.\nInterest rates threw sand in the gears for many of them, increasing debt service on their floating-rate loans and raising construction costs. At the same time, Texas, a hotspot for value-add multifamily operators, was absorbing a historic wave of apartment development, causing rental rates and occupancy levels to fall.\nAs a result, experts anticipate\na wave of multifamily distress in Texas\n, where about $19 billion in CMBS loans tied to multifamily is set to mature in the next five years.\n",

That brings the state\u2019s footprint at the tower to more than 117,000 square feet.\nThe asking rent on the expansion, which covers the building\u2019s top two floors, was $85 per square foot. A CBRE team including Stephen Siegel, Liz Lash and Peter Larkin represented the tenant, while another team from the brokerage including Robert Alexander, Ryan Alexander and Emily Chabrier represented the landlord.\nWith the expansion, the 1.5 million-square-foot, 47-story office property is fully occupied.\n\u201cLeasing velocity on Third Avenue has significantly increased this year, resulting in a notable shortage of large, high-quality availability,\u201d SL Green executive vice president Steven Durels said in a statement.\n\nIn November, the New York State Executive Chamber \u2014 or the Office of the Governor \u2014 signed a seven-year lease for 53,000 square feet on the building\u2019s 40th and 45th floors. The space was set to be used as Governor Kathy Hochul\u2019s personal office, as well as a press office and working space for her staff.\nThe Office of General Services explored potential leases at 40 buildings, touring 20 of them before picking 919 Third Avenue. At the time of the lease, it was said to be negotiating for more space, the result of which appears to be the latest deal.\nOther tenants at the building include law firm Schulte, Roth &amp; Zabel; law firm Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo; and\nBloomberg\n.\nIn the third quarter, tenants in Manhattan\nleased 9.4 million square feet\n, a 2 percent jump from the second quarter and almost 27 percent higher than the five-year quarterly average, according to a Colliers report. Leasing volume surpassed 30 million square feet for the full year, surging past pre-pandemic levels and representing the strongest period of year-to-date demand since 2002.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A group of unit owners hired brokers to sell their waterfront building in North Bay Village, near Related Group and Macklowe Properties\u2019 planned two-tower luxury condo tower project.\nNearly all of the Harbor Condominium owners tapped Blanca Commercial Real Estate and MSP Group to sell the 29-unit, circa-1951 building at 7909 to 7911 East Drive on Harbor Island, said Blanca\u2019s Cary Cohen, and Deme Mekras and Sam Mekras of MSP.\nThe 0.54-acre property is unpriced, but \u201cWe expect this to shatter the North Bay Village record,\u201d Cohen said. Deme Mekras said the current record for land sales is $744 per square foot, which would come out to more than $17.6 million.\nA developer could build 38 units and up to 150 feet tall, or about 15 stories; or up to 50 units with 195 feet of transferable development rights that the buyer could purchase from the city or a private seller, the brokers said.\nDeme Mekras said the property will be a short walk to the planned island walk promenade that\u2019ll be part of Sunbeam Properties\u2019 planned development.\u00a0 The billionaire Ansin family\u2019s Sunbeam Properties owns 14 acres in the village and plans to build a\n7.3 million-square-foot\ndevelopment with roughly 2,000 residential units, 300 hotel keys and commercial space.\n\u201cTo be walkable to that, it\u2019s going to be pretty special,\u201d he said.\nCondo associations that may have deferred maintenance, repairs and the full funding of their aging buildings for years are now playing catch-up, thanks to condo safety laws passed after the deadly condo collapse of Champlain Towers South in Surfside more than four years ago. The cost of insurance has also soared.\n\n\u201cRather than maintaining aging structures that require substantial capital investment, they are making the strategic decision to capitalize on the soaring value of their location,\u201d Cohen said in the release, adding in an interview that the association\u2019s monthly dues would create \u201cmore of a burden than a benefit.\u201d\nSome unit owners and associations have instead opted to sell their condos to developers in bulk.\nRelated and Macklowe bought out the owners of the Biscayne Sea Club co-op and the Majestic Isle condo building on the northern tip of Harbor Island, though both deals were previously tied up in litigation. The developers plan two nearly 500-foot condo towers on their assemblage of more than 4.1 acres. In July, North Bay Village commissioners\nunanimously passed\na zoning ordinance via a special area plan that will allow the project to move forward. Arquitectonica, led by Bernardo Fort Brescia, is the architect.\nOn the west side of Harbor Island, S2 Development recently sold the\n1-acre development site\nat 7913 West Drive to El-Ad National Properties. The waterfront lot is approved for a 22-story, 94-unit residential tower.\nNorth Bay Village, a three-island town sandwiched between Miami and Miami Beach, has a number of other residential and mixed-use projects planned.\nThe Eichner family\u2019s Continuum Company controls 4.5 acres in North Bay Village, including the former Shucker\u2019s and Best Western property. This summer, the commission unanimously\napproved\na special area plan, site plan and development agreement for the entire Continuum Waterfront District, which calls for two condo towers, a 200-key Continuum hotel and a marina. One tower can now be up to 440 feet tall.\nMikael Hamaoui\u2019s Riviera Horizons plans the 28-story, 70-unit\nPagani-branded condo tower\nat 7940 West Drive on Harbor Island, marking the first condo development for the Italian hypercar brand. Shoma Group plans Shoma Bay, a mixed-use condo tower with a Publix supermarket, at 1872 79th Street Causeway.\nDeveloper Vivian Dimond also took over a stalled\n21-story, 54-unit\ncondo project at 7918 West Drive on Harbor Island, with plans to complete the building next year.\n",

Instead, DOF capped their benefit at $16.5 million, citing outdated filing rules, according to the lawsuit.\nThe dispute turns on when the project \u201cofficially\u201d began.\nDanforth filed its first ICAP application in 2014, but the developer filed renewed permits in 2017. Over time, escalating costs from pandemic delays pushed the budget far past initial estimates.\n\nThe developers asked to shift the project\u2019s start date from 2015 to 2017 so the tax calculation would reflect its completion in 2023. DOF allegedly refused, saying the request relied on ICAP rules that didn\u2019t exist when the original application was filed.\nThat timing gap, the lawsuit claims, was the city\u2019s fault. The lawsuit stated that DOF waited nearly a decade after state and city lawmakers created ICAP in 2008 to finalize implementing regulations \u2014 a lag that the lawsuit says violated separation-of-powers principles and undermined the program\u2019s purpose.\nA DOF spokesperson defended the decision, saying the agency administers programs \u201cwithin the parameters established by state and local law.\u201d\nDanforth founder Steven Williams declined to comment to the outlet.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Walgreens Boots Alliance is shutting down its massive workspace in Chicago\u2019s Old Post Office and consolidating operations at its suburban Deerfield headquarters, the company confirmed Monday \u2014 a major reversal of its pre-pandemic urban expansion strategy.\nThe move was announced five weeks after Walgreens completed its $10 billion sale to New York private equity firm Sycamore Partners. In an email to employees, the new CEO Mike Motz said the company \u201cmust make bold, decisive choices to free up resources\u201d and that bringing its Chicago-area workforce under one roof would \u201cenhance collaboration\u201d and improve support for store teams, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nWalgreens plans to close the downtown office by the end of January. The company leased roughly 200,000 square feet at the Old Post Office at 433 West Van Buren Street in 2018 \u2014 a high-profile deal that helped kick off the building\u2019s transformation into a modern corporate hub. At the time, Walgreens said up to 1,800 employees could eventually work there, a symbol of its push to attract younger, tech-oriented talent in the city.\nThat vision never fully materialized. The Old Post Office lease runs through 2032, according to CoStar, and it\u2019s unclear whether Walgreens will sublease the space or negotiate an early exit. Either scenario would deal another blow to a downtown office market battered by record vacancies and rising distress.\nA spokeswoman for the building\u2019s owner, New York-based 601W Companies, declined to comment. In 2019,\n601W\ncompleted an $800 million overhaul of the Old Post Office building.\n\nThe Deerfield consolidation also fits into a broader downsizing trend for Walgreens\u2019 real estate footprint. Last year, the company sold 18 acres of its corporate campus to Atlanta-based homebuilder\nPulte Group\n, which is developing single-family homes on the site. A year ago, Walgreens began\nclosing\n1,200 of its 8,000 stores nationwide.\nMotz, a former Staples retail chief installed by Sycamore, is leading Walgreens through a sweeping restructuring after years of weak performance, mounting debt and failed bets on healthcare ventures such as\nVillageMD\n.\nThe company\u2019s breakup into five standalone private entities \u2014 including its core pharmacy chain, Boots Group in the U.K. and Shields Health Solutions \u2014 marks the most significant overhaul in its 120-year history.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The owners of\n3612 Crescent Avenue in Highland Park\nseemed to command the high ground of the Texas market last month. With an asking price of $18.5 million, the mansion, held by the family trust of a Stanford University trustee and a Morgan Stanley wealth manager, was the second-most expensive listing in the state. Located in one of Dallas\u2019 most desirable neighborhoods, the home has a top-performing Compass agent and glowing coverage in local media.\nThe rub? The home had already listed\nlast year\nfor $19.5 million, stalled, relisted in January and left the market in August before reentering with a $1 million price cut in September.\nThe Crescent Avenue mansion isn\u2019t alone. As the\nSun Belt shifts in favor of buyers\n, prices are lowering and market time is lengthening for Texas\u2019 most luxurious homes.\nWhile prices have risen nationally, luxury home transactions fell 0.7 percent to a 10-year low in August,\naccording to Redfin\n. In this metric, Texas is strongly outperforming Florida, which has undergone the most drastic change; luxury deals declined by 27 percent in West Palm Beach and 19 percent in Miami. Austin is the only major Texas metro to experience a decline in luxury trades, and its 0.4 percent fall is slightly shallower than the national average.\nHowever, Austin, Dallas and Fort Worth all chart higher-than-average days on market for homes above $1 million, and the price history of the state\u2019s top homes suggests that demand for ultra-luxury in Texas might be on the wane.\nIn Dallas,\nthe state\u2019s leading luxury metro\n, agents are optimistic about the general luxury class.\n\u201cThe $3 million-plus segment is thriving,\u201d said Bryan Pacholski, chief sales officer of Compass\u2019 Dallas office. Dallas/Fort Worth saw 338 luxury transactions in the second quarter of 2025 compared to 232 the prior year, according to Pacholski, amounting to a 46 percent increase year over year.\n\nThe lower stratum of luxury is more sensitive to lending, said Douglas Elliman agent Breah Brown, who calls North Texas luxury \u201cpretty resilient.\u201d\n\u201cInterest rates are affecting that first-home buyer, and here, that\u2019s around the $2 million, $2.5 million dollar mark. Of course, you\u2019ve got condos and stuff that are under a million, but first-home buyers are really in that range,\u201d Brown said.\nHowever, the ultra-luxury lane is noticeably slowing. Of the 40 most-expensive properties in Texas to list since June, only one has sold, according to the Houston Association of Realtors. The average luxury home sold in 46 days in August, three days slower than last year, according to Redfin. Most of the state\u2019s 40 priciest listings have already exceeded this average.\nFurthermore, the new listings aren\u2019t that new. September had a higher concentration of relistings compared to prior months. Along with 3612 Crescent Avenue, six other properties \u2014\n7031 Turtle Creek Boulevard\n, 4625 Walnut Hill and 4208 Beverly Drive in Dallas,\n412 Timberwilde Lane\nand a condo at 2555 North Pearl Street in Houston, and 2 Grand Colonial Drive in Spring \u2014 reentered the market in September. With an asking price of $9 million, 4625 Walnut Hill is the most serially marketed home of the set, having listed five times in the last 12 months.\nPrevious months didn\u2019t have this many relistings. None of the top 10 homes for sale in either May or June had listed before within the year, and July had just one relisting.\nSeveral sellers have decided to take their homes off the market altogether. The properties at 3648 Stratford Avenue and 3709 Euclid Avenue in Highland Park, 4905 Reserve Court in Parker, and 6 Estancia Place in Spring all failed to find a buyer, according to Zillow and county records.\nNationally,\nluxury listings increased 9.5 percent\nyear over year during the summer to their highest peak since 2020, accounting for seasonal trends, according to Redfin.\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s official: A long-stalled megadevelopment in Brooklyn has a new development team that will take over seven sites and, in a new twist, pay $12 million toward an affordable housing fund.\nA\njoint venture\nled by Cirrus Real Estate and LCOR has scooped up the remaining sites that make up Pacific Park, a massive project that was launched\nmore than two decades ago\n. Through a foreclosure auction on Tuesday, the joint venture took over the development rights to six rail yard sites, after Greenland USA defaulted on nearly $350 million in loans tied to the properties.\nBeyond Cirrus and LCOR, the joint venture taking over the sites includes U.S. Immigration Fund and Fortress, but those firms won\u2019t have an active role in managing the development.\u00a0Terms of the project restructuring were not immediately available. USIF confirmed the deal Tuesday afternoon.\nAhead of the auction, the state blessed Cirrus and LCOR as new developers of the sites, which include the rail yard properties \u2014 to be developed once platforms are built over the tracks between Pacific Street and Atlantic Avenue \u2014 and another located near the Barclays Center, known as site 5. Greenland is still part of the joint venture that will develop that site.\nThe latter was not included in Tuesday\u2019s auction and is being transferred through a separate, private deal.\nAs part of an agreement with the state, the joint venture will pay $12 million toward an affordable housing fund, of which $4.5 million would be paid upfront, according to state officials. The money, which will be paid in installments, is intended to fill in for penalties that were supposed to kick in when the current\ndeveloper\n, Greenland USA, failed to finish the project\u2019s remaining 876 affordable apartments by May 2025. Under a 2014 agreement, failing to meet that construction deadline meant the developer must pay $2,000 per unfinished unit for every month that the apartments went without a temporary certificate of occupancy.\nBut Empire State Development, the state agency overseeing the project, halted those fines and\ntied them to new deadlines\n, the first of which was quickly missed.\nStill, the agency once again\ndeclined\nto enforce the penalties, citing concerns that Greenland would sue over the fines and further delay the project.\nThe $12 million payment isn\u2019t as much as would likely have been collected if the 2014 agreement were enforced (a two-year delay on all the units would result in a $42 million fine, for example). Elected officials and BrooklynSpeaks, an advocacy group that was party to the 2014 agreement, have railed against the state\u2019s decision not to enforce the penalties, viewing it as a betrayal of the community\u2019s trust.\nIn this next phase of the project, ESD plans to set new benchmarks for the project. If a memorandum of understanding outlining the project isn\u2019t signed by July 31, 2026, the state agency could still collect the damages described in the 2014 agreement, dating back to June 1. Those damages would take the $12 million payment installments into account.\nA decades-long project\nThe mixed-use development has been in limbo for several years. First proposed in 2003 with the name Atlantic Yards, Greenland began taking over the then-long-stalled project in 2014 and rebranded it Pacific Park. The rail yard \u2014\u00a0a key part of the \u201cblight\u201d that empowered the state to take over the sites through eminent domain and lease them out to developers \u2014 went untouched, and concerns over Greenland\u2019s ability to finish the project mounted.\n\nIn 2022, Greenland\ndefaulted\non $350 million tied to the rail yard sites from Nick Mastroianni\u2019s USIF, which raised the capital through the cash-for-visas EB-5 program. Fortress Investment Group also owns a stake in the debt.\nThe fact that ESD has approved the joint venture and that the development rights have been transferred for the six sites means that the project can enter the next phase \u2014 whatever that may look like.\u00a0The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has also signed off on the team, which has agreed to make annual payments of $11 million related to air rights tied to the rail yards.\nThe new developers have indicated that they want to make changes to the earlier plans, which called for more than 6,400 apartments, 2,250 of which would be set aside as below market-rate. So far, nine buildings (including the Barclays Center) have been completed as part of the project, with more than 3,200 apartments built, by original developers Forest City Ratner, Greenland USA and other developers who, over the years, have taken over individual sites.\nUSIF\u2019s Nick Mastroianni said he expects the plan to be reworked and finalized over the next year and half. The first phase, which involves building the first of two platforms over the rail yards, will cost an estimated $4 billion and take roughly five years to complete, he said. The second phase will cost another $2 billion. He said the development team has \u201cideas on how to bring the affordable housing\u00a0to reality sooner rather than later,\u201d but wouldn\u2019t share details on what the team envisions for the site. He noted that\nsome of the sites\nwill qualify for the now-expired property tax break 421a.\nMastroianni described the transfer of the sites as a turning point for the project and its EB-5 investors.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve now advanced the project so that we can develop, and the development will be the trigger for the [loan] repayment on a unit by unit basis,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a light at the end of the tunnel for the return of their capital.\u201d\nWhat comes next\nChanges to the plan will require amendments to the state\u2019s general project plan, a method outside the city\u2019s land use process that lays out the parameters of a project. ESD indicated that it will kick off a public engagement process to discuss the development team\u2019s proposals in the coming months.\nIf the history of Pacific Park is any indication, that process will be tense: The project has been held up as an example of what happens when developers promise big, fail to deliver and then walk away unscathed. BrooklynSpeaks has called for deeper affordability levels than originally planned.\nOther suitors circled Pacific Park, including\nRelated Companies\n. Cirrus\nconfirmed\nin January that it was pursuing the project, and LCOR emerged a few months later.\nCirrus has said that it will lead capitalization on the project, and LCOR comes in as an experienced multifamily developer. Cirrus\u2019 website provides little information about the company\u2019s development experience, but the firm\u2019s principals collectively have overseen \u201c$150 billion in real estate finance transactions, $10 billion in real estate equity investments and more than 10,000 multifamily units,\u201d according to a company spokesperson.\nCirrus has seen its portfolio of projects in the city grow since reaching an agreement last year with the Building and Construction Trades Council and City Hall to invest $100 million in multifamily workforce housing and redevelopments by pooling pension funds from more than a dozen construction unions. The fund, which raised $300 million as of July, will help finance development at Pacific Park, as well as workforce housing at a\ndefunct airport\nin Queens and tens of thousands of units of housing as part of an agreement with Resorts World Casino New York City.\nLCOR, which is also working with Cirrus on the Queens project, oversees a portfolio of 10,000 multifamily units and 2.4 million square feet of commercial space, according to the firm\u2019s website. Cirrus is led by Joseph McDonnell, who was formerly head of real estate at BlueMountain Capital, and Tony Tufariello, who served as head of real estate finance at Morgan Stanley and head of global real estate at Fortress, which is also part of the joint venture.\n",

        "content": "Morgan Properties bought a 300-unit apartment complex near West Palm Beach for nearly $70 million, amid an uptick in South Florida multifamily investment sales.\nConshohoken, Pennsylvania-based Morgan purchased the gated garden-style property at 4860 Sand Stone Lane in unincorporated Palm Beach County from Miami-based Bar Invest Group, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The deal breaks down to $233,167 per unit.\nThe buyer paid $69.95 million for the complex and financed it with a $49.9 million Freddie Mac loan.\nThe complex, called Visions at Willow Pond, consists of 17 two-story and three-story apartment buildings, a clubhouse and one warehouse, Vizzda records show. It was completed in 1986 and 1987 on a 30.4-acre site.\nBar Invest, a major South Florida multifamily landlord, had paid $56.2 million for the property in 2020, according to records. Bar Invest is led by Herve Barbera.\nMultifamily investment firm Morgan, led by Mitchell Morgan, has been ramping up its apartment purchases nationwide this year. After it purchased an 11-property portfolio with more than 3,000 apartments in eight states for\n$501 million\nin April, its total multifamily holdings topped 100,000 units nationwide.\nIn August, Morgan reached a deal to purchase a majority stake in Toronto-based publicly traded Dream Residential REIT for $10.80 per share, or about\n$354 million\n. After the purchase, which is expected to close by year-end, Dream will go private.\n\nMorgan is considered the largest private multifamily owner in the U.S.\nIn South Florida, Morgan owns the 180-unit Tuscany Pointe at Somerset Place at 23126 Post Gardens Way near Boca Raton; the 191-unit Savannah Place at 22356 Calibre Court near Boca Raton; the 202-unit Royal St. George at the Villages at 1441 Brandywine Road in West Palm Beach; and Village Place at 2111 Brandywine Road in West Palm Beach, according to the firm\u2019s website.\nSeveral South Florida multifamily investment sales have closed in recent months, after a slowdown during the past two years due to elevated interest rates and more skittish lenders. The tri-county region had become a magnet for newcomers during the pandemic, which had prompted unprecedented apartment demand and record rent growth. The in-migration slowed just as developers also completed a record number of units last year, slowing lease-ups and increasing concessions.\nDuring the pandemic, Palm Beach County apartment investment sales reached $3.8 billion in 2021 and $1.8 billion in 2022, according to data from Avison Young. This dropped to $668 million in 2023 and $1 billion last year. Multifamily investment sales for the first half of this year in the county totaled $120.6 million, the Avison data shows.\nMany of the buyers still purchasing are relying on Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae loans, which usually offer better terms than bank financing.\nThis month, Tishman Speyer paid\n$124.5 million\nfor the 270-unit Bell at Broken Sound Apartments at 5500 Broken Sound Boulevard Northwest and 950 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway in Boca Raton. The buyer financed the purchase with a $78.4 million Fannie Mae loan.\nIn July, Brookfield Properties bought the 444-unit Turtle Cove complex at 825 Cotton Bay Drive East in unincorporated Palm Beach County for\n$107.5 million\n. The deal was part of Brookfield\u2019s $1.6 billion purchase of a 7,300-unit portfolio of 23 properties from Miami Beach-based Starwood Capital Group.",

Mamo later received a $55 million, five-year bridge loan from Korth Direct Mortgage to refinance the property in 2023, according to the company. Korth Direct Mortgage, in the\nannouncement\n, said the collateral property was worth $86.9 million but estimated it will appreciate to\u00a0 $104.4 million within three years.\nThe Long Beach Marketplace spans 18.5 acres, with about a third of the site currently unused after multiple businesses closed due to the pandemic, a roster that included a UA Theater, and El Torito, Claim Jumper and Tilted Kilt restaurants.\n\nMamo is in discussions with developers to build apartments to fill the vacant space, the company said. Not including the vacant area earmarked for redevelopment, the total leasable space amounts to around 113,000 square feet.\nThe portion of the property expected to remain dedicated to retail currently has 40 tenants, including recent arrivals Modern Animal, Phenix Salon Suites, Crumbl Cookies, Orangetheory Fitness and Watch Me! Sports Bar, according to Mamo.\nThe retail complex built in the 1970s is minutes away from 2nd &amp; PCH, a high-end outdoor mall owned by CenterCal Properties, which recently\npurchased\nthe Long Beach Towne Center for $145 million.\nMamo isn\u2019t the only retail owner to land fresh funds in recent months.

The project has an estimated budget of $133 million.\nThe funding shows that the proposed development meets key objectives for the state, including building on surplus public land, creating housing in high-resource areas and serving extremely low-income households, said Allison Riley, co-executive director of Venice Community Housing.\nThe development is slated to replace a Los Angeles Department of Transportation parking lot near the Venice Canals with low-rise structures containing 120 apartments, commercial space and replacement parking for residents and businesses. The 2.7-acre site at 200 North Venice Boulevard is bounded by Venice Boulevard, Pacific Avenue, Canal Street and Dell Avenue and sits just one block east of the beachfront.\nRedevelopment of the site has been in the works for about a decade, though it\u2019s faced obstacles over the years.\n\nCity Councilmember Traci Park\n, opposed the development in her campaign and has since proposed using a different site that hasn\u2019t been entitled for affordable housing \u2014 a move some view as an attempt to kill the project.\nThe nonprofit L.A.

        "content": "The Big Ten Network is looking to switch studios nearly two decades after it first went on the air from a converted warehouse along the Chicago River.\nThe college sports broadcaster is exploring a move from 600 West Chicago Avenue, the 1.6 million-square-foot former Montgomery Ward complex, according to people familiar with the plans and first reported by\nCoStar\n.\nThe network, which leases about 58,000 square feet in the building, is weighing options of similar size at two high-profile downtown locations: Prudential Plaza, overlooking Millennium Park, and 350 North Orleans Street, near the Merchandise Mart. Savills broker Robert Sevim is representing the network in the search.\nThe Big Ten Network hasn\u2019t commented publicly on its next move.\nThe network\u2019s building recently changed hands. Arizona-based 3Edgewood, the real estate firm led by former Phoenix Suns owner\nRobert Sarver\n, bought 600 West Chicago earlier this year for just $89 million \u2014 a steep drop from its $510 million sale price in 2018. The firm is pitching upgrades like outdoor terraces, bars, and a rooftop deck to lure tenants amid rising vacancy.\n\nAny relocation would mark a major shift for the Big Ten Network, which debuted in 2007 as the first college sports\nconference-owned\nTV channel, broadcasting football, basketball and dozens of Olympic sports from its Chicago studios. The network has since grown alongside the conference, which ballooned from 11 to 18 teams after recent expansions into the West Coast.\nThe two options reflect differing strategies in a struggling office market. The property at 350 North Orleans Street has been in receivership since\nBlackstone\nhanded back the keys last year when its $310 million loan came due. Receiver Trigild and leasing agent Lincoln Property Company are seeking tenants as the building\u2019s appraised value plummeted to $87.4 million from $489 million in 2018.\nPrudential Plaza owner Wanxiang America Real Estate, on the other hand, recently negotiated a loan extension through 2027 \u2014 at 130 East Randolph Street and 180 North Stetson Avenue \u2014 pledging more than $50 million in\nupgrades\n, landing tenants including ComPsych, HOK, AECOM and Howard &amp; Howard.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The artificial intelligence boom in the Bay Area is driving demand for more than just apartments for incoming workers.\nAs AI barons move into town, the San Francisco real estate market is experiencing a shortage of mansions, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. Luxury listings that once sat on the market for months are now drawing multiple offers within days.\nTake a 5,000-square-foot\nmansion in the tony Pacific Heights neighborhood\nthat went into contract last month with a sale price of about $9.4 million. It\u2019s roughly the same price it sold for eight years ago, but at the time, nearly four months passed before an offer came in.\n\u201cIt was a difficult house at the time,\u201d luxury broker Peter Rodway, senior partner at Neal Ward Properties who worked to sell the Jackson Street home in 2017 and now, said of the property. \u201cThis time, buyers were just banging at the doors to get into it. An offer came in on the first day, at full price.\u201d\nAI startups\nare growing, stock options are turning into cash and high-paid tech workers are returning to the \u2014 all ramping up demand in the high-end market.\n\u201cThe future wealth in AI is out and touring homes right now. Some of them are touring $2 million condos. Some of them are touring $20 million houses. That wealth effect is going to continue to help drive demand,\u201d Gregg Lynn, a luxury agent with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, said.\n\u201cThe city is just flush with cash right now \u2014 and there\u2019s not enough inventory to keep up with it,\u201d Rodway added.\n\nSales for luxury homes are up 14 percent year-over-year in San Francisco, according to Redfin data cited by the Chronicle. Inventory, meanwhile, is down by about 4.5 percent year-over-year.\nFor the months of June through August, total\nhome sales\nregardless of price were up by 4.2 percent compared to the same period last year. This September saw a massive uptick from the same month last year, with overall home sales last month in San Francisco being up 35 percent year-over-year.\nAdditionally, San Francisco was the only county in the Bay Area to see a year-over-year increase in its \u201cpending ratio,\u201d which compares demand versus supply.\n\u201cSan Francisco\u2019s pending ratio leapt higher by 15 percentage points, an enormous rise. We ascribe the large shifts in the market to its rapidly accelerating AI startup boom,\u201d Patrick Carlisle, chief market analyst at Compass, said. October could be even bigger, as it\u2019s \u201ctypically the big month in fall for closed luxury sales\u201d in San Francisco. As it stands, 15 sales of homes over $5 million are pending and expected to close this month.\nCBRE predicts\nthe explosion of AI will bring more than 50,000 tech workers to San Francisco by the end of the decade. Just how much AI juices the once-slumping San Francisco market in the coming years remains to be seen.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Todd Nepola is clapping back at the networks and production company of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Miami\u201d for allegedly distorting reality about him.\nNepola\n, a Hollywood-based commercial real estate investor, filed a defamation lawsuit in Miami federal court on Tuesday against cable network Bravo, its parent company NBC Universal, and Los Angeles-based Purveyors of Pop, which produces the hit television series documenting the everyday drama of seven rich and successful women, some of whom are recent divorcees like Alexia Nepola.\nIn March, the Nepolas finalized their divorce, but their breakup was among the salacious plotlines in the most recent seventh season of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Miami,\u201d which also introduced a new cast member hailing from South Florida\u2019s real estate industry: Shoma Group President\nStephanie Shojaee\n.\nNepola and his attorney, Scott Weiselberg, declined to comment. Spokespersons for Bravo, NBC Universal and Purveyors of Pop did not respond to email requests for comment.\nIn his complaint,\nNepola\nalleges that \u201cThe Real Housewives of Miami\u201d producers knowingly manufactured and amplified an ongoing storyline that falsely depicted him as being in financial distress. The lawsuit asserts that Nepola has a net worth exceeding $100 million, and that he\u2019s never faced financial trouble in his life.\n\nThe producers also reused video footage of him from seasons four and five of the show as fodder for seasons six and seven, allegedly without his consent. Nepola had agreed to appear in the previous seasons, which aired in 2022 and 2023, when he and Alexia Nepola were engaged, and included a finale episode in season five showcasing their nuptials.\nThe alleged on-air defamation occurred across several episodes in seasons six and seven when \u201cThe Real Housewives of Miami\u201d cast member Adriana de Moura dished rumors about Nepola in front of the camera. According to the complaint, in one episode, de Moura says, \u201cA little bird told me that Todd and Alexia are having some trouble\u2026and they might have to break their lease and find a cheaper place.\u201d\nNepola\nalleges that when he confronted producers, \u201cthey did not care,\u201d the complaint states. During the time producers aired the episodes intimating that he was struggling, Nepola closed more than $115 million in real estate deals across 11 transactions, the lawsuit states.\nIn July, an affiliate of Nepola\u2019s Current Capital Group paid\n$33 million\nfor a Miami Gardens shopping center.\nThe alleged defamation extends beyond the episodes during season six and seven, as Bravo has re-aired allegedly snippets depicting or mentioning Nepola in a negative light on the network\u2019s social media accounts, \u201cThe Real Housewives of Miami\u201d reunion shows and other media platforms, the complaint states.\n\u201cThe defamatory story lines forged by the RHOM producers are completely devoid from reality,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. \u201cEach new broadcast serves to reignite and revalidate the false narrative, reinforcing the public\u2019s belief in its accuracy and renewing the emotional and reputational harm.\u201d",

At the time, JRE Partners was known as Julius Real Estate Partners and was a division of J.P. Morgan. It split off and rebranded as JRE Partners in 2022. The hotel reopened in 2020 as 21c Museum Hotel Chicago after the landlord spent $33.5 million in upgrades.\nIn February 2024, JRE put the hotel up for sale, hiring JLL brokers Adam McGaughy, John Nugent, Mark Jindra and Nick Sullivan to market the property. But it never traded, until ACORE moved to seize the asset through the deed in lieu, which allows borrowers to avoid a lengthy foreclosure process by turning over a property\u2019s keys and control.\n\nJRE borrowed $67.5 million from ACORE to finance the purchase in 2018. In 2019, JRE and ACORE agreed to increase the mortgage amount to $73 million.\nJRE Partners and ACORE Capital did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe takeaway marks ACORE\u2019s second recent action in the Chicago hotel distress market. The lender in August filed a\n$187 million foreclosure lawsuit\nagainst local hotelier Su-Mei Yen over allegedly unpaid debts tied to two South Loop properties totaling 368 rooms with another 85 extended stay suites at one of them.\nCheck back for updates on this developing story.",

        "content": "Developer Leo Birov is planning what will likely be two new houses on the site of a lakefront Kenilworth mansion that he bought for $6.8 million last month.\nBirov, whose wife and business partner Milena Birov was the buyer\u2019s agent on the transaction, confirmed in a voicemail to\nThe Real Deal\nthat he was the buyer of the property and the developer of an upcoming spec mansion that went on the market this week. The Birovs operate Heritage Luxury Homes, which develops and sells mansions on the North Shore.\nThe Birovs could not be reached for further comment.\nThe new listing at 501 Sheridan Road in Kenilworth, first reported by Crain\u2019s, is for an 11,000 square-foot mansion on one of two lots the previous house occupied. The planned mansion has seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms, and is asking nearly $6 million.\nThe listing advertised a 0.56-acre lot, which matches the smaller of two parcels the previous house was on, according to Cook County records. That parcel faces Sheridan Road and does not have lakefront access. Construction is expected to be completed next year, according to the listing.\nIt\u2019s likely that the second parcel, which is 0.93 acres and has lakefront access, will be the site of another new development, but there hasn\u2019t been a listing for a second house at the location.\n\nThe current house at the address, an 11,000 square-foot estate with five bedrooms and nine bathrooms, was built in the 1960s and expanded in 2006. It was last owned by the late Robert and Yadelle Sklare, and the sale was managed by their family.\nWhen the\nhouse sold last month\nafter major price cuts, the listing agent, Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Nancy Nugent, said the buyers would likely tear down the house for new construction. Most potential buyers who made offers on the house were also interested in tearing down, Nugent said.\nThe property entered the private market in 2021 asking $14 million. It underwent several price cuts before its final listing price of $7.7 million, and it eventually closed for $6.8 million.\nThe sale price makes it one of the most expensive houses sold in Kenilworth in recent years. One mansion on Sheridan Road brought in a record $11.75 million in 2020, and another Sheridan Road property sold for $9.5 million in 2021.\nHeritage Luxury Homes is marketing another spec mansion in Glencoe asking $5.7 million.\nA home developed by the Birovs sold for $4.7 million in Glencoe in June, and they have sold at least two new homes in Wilmette: A $2 million Sunset Drive home in 2024, and a 9,000 square-foot French Colonial house on Michigan Ave for $4.8 million in 2022.\n",

The site\u2019s current zoning caps height at 54 feet, meaning the plan would need a significant city sign-off before moving forward.\nGFF Design\nis the project architect, and Dallas-based\nOJB Landscape Architecture\nis handling the landscape plan.\nThe taller of the two buildings would house about 150 hotel rooms and fewer than 100 for-sale condos, while the shorter one would hold roughly 200 rental units. The developers said the project will replace a sea of asphalt with a more pedestrian-friendly layout anchored by a half-acre green space. Nearly all parking will be underground, save for a few surface spots, and plans include planting more than 100 mature trees \u2014 partly to restore the canopy lost when a 2019 tornado swept through the area.\n\n\u201cThis is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to define a very special future for this site,\u201d Burk Interests president Leland Burk told the outlet. The developers also intend to add a traffic signal and crosswalk on Preston Road, along with 1,000 linear feet of sidewalk improvements.\nThe Preston-Royal intersection, known for its postwar retail and tangle of parking lots, could see a dramatic shift if the project is approved from what exists along\nPreston Hollow\ntoday, said GFF\u2019s Evan Beattie.\nBurk\u2019s firm has owned the land since 2017 and is positioning the site, less than a mile from the Dallas North Tollway, as a rare infill opportunity. Zoning approvals could take several years; Burk estimates the project could start by 2028 following neighborhood input sessions.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

In the process, Fulop has lured the Big Apple\u2019s biggest developers \u2014 including\nSilverstein Properties\n,\nTishman Speyer\nand Related Companies \u2014 across the Hudson.\n\nUnder his watch, massive towers have sprung up along the waterfront and in a rejuvenated Journal Square, where the nearly century-old Baroque movie palace Loew\u2019s Jersey Theater is undergoing a $130 million renovation that will create a performance venue with 3,000-plus seats.\nPart of his legacy in Jersey City includes supporting the construction of more than 10,000 residential units, putting more than 18,000 additional units in the pipeline.\nWylde\u2019s departure marks the end of an era for the Partnership, which represents the city\u2019s top corporate leaders and serves as a conduit between business, labor and government. Under her watch, the group became a central voice in policy debates around housing, taxes, public safety and the city\u2019s post-COVID economic recovery.\n\u201cI am humbled to take the reins from Kathy Wylde, who built the organization into the influential force it is today,\u201d Fulop said in a statement, noting the Partnership\u2019s reach across the city\u2019s largest employers, which collectively provide more than 1 million jobs. Wylde said she expects a\nsmooth transition\n.\nFulop will officially assume his post next year as\nWylde caps more than four decades\nshaping New York\u2019s civic and economic landscape.\n",

Last year, it offloaded a 236,600-square-foot Interstate Park Logistics Center warehouse at 3774 Interstate Park Road North in Riviera Beach for\n$55 million\n. Also last year, Dalfen paid\n$26.4 million\nfor three industrial facilities in Broward County spanning a combined 102,000 square feet.\nIn 2021, Dalfen bought two newly completed warehouses at 1501 Meathe Drive in West Palm Beach from developer Jeff Greene for\n$60.6 million\n.\nSouth Florida\u2019s\nindustrial market\n, which prospered during the pandemic due to an influx of out-of-state residents and businesses, experienced a softening this year.

A different MCM fund will maintain partial ownership,\naccording to CoStar\n, which first reported the deal.\nA spokesperson for MCM, which shares an address with Magna Hospitality Group but is a separate company, declined to comment.\nThe portfolio includes the Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square North, the Motto by Hilton New York City Chelsea, the leasehold for the DoubleTree by Hilton New York Times Square South and the leasehold for the Fairfield Inn &amp; Suites New York Midtown Manhattan Penn Station.\nThe firm will\nkeep a minority stake\nafter trading more than 90 percent of its equity in the properties, Crain\u2019s reported.\nJLL brokered the deal, which marks the largest Big Apple hotel sale since the\nSafe Hotels Act\nwent into effect in May. Critics of the law predicted that it would hurt the value of nonunion hotels by increasing expenses and eroding their cost advantage. So far, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.\n\nMCM bought the 21-story hotel building at 30 West 46th Street from Concord Hospitality\nin 2021 for $88.5 million\nand opened the 196-key Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square North. The firm sold the property for $115.5 million.\nA deed recorded with the city shows a sale price of $92 million but does not include the personal property value that is part of the final sale price, a source said. City National Bank provided a $77 million loan for the purchase, property records show\nMCM bought the hotel property at\n113 West 24th Street\nin Chelsea for $74.2 million in 2019, when it was still under construction. It opened the 374-key Motto by Hilton in December 2021 and sold it for $222 million. A deed filed with the city shows a sale price of $168.6 million. Apollo Global Management provided a $105 million loan.\nA limited liability company tied to MCM took over the leasehold of 523 Eighth Avenue in 2021 in a deal valued at\n$47.4 million\n. It sold the 320-key Times Square property,\u00a0 a DoubleTree by Hilton, for $99.8 million.\nMCM paid $57.4 million to buy the senior loan and take over the leasehold for the 239-key Marriott at\n325 West 33rd Street\nin 2020. It sold the property for $52.3 million.\nThe relationship between Magna and MCM is unclear. Magna is known for scooping up distressed hotel properties and went on a Manhattan buying spree during the pandemic. In July, MCM made a credit bid of $10 million for Joe Moinian\u2019s Midtown Hilton Garden Inn in a U.C.C. auction, giving it a pathway to take over the property.\n",

        "content": "Downtown Chicago could look radically different by 2045 under a sweeping new blueprint that imagines more than 100 million square feet of development and a population more than doubling to 300,000.\nThe Department of Planning and Development drafted its Central Area Plan 2045, set to go before the Plan Commission this fall, laying out a two-decade roadmap for private investment, infrastructure and land use across the Loop and surrounding areas, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe framework emphasizes housing, public space and transit improvements over office expansion, reflecting how the city hopes to adapt its struggling business district into a mixed-use neighborhood built for residents as much as workers.\nHeidi Sperry, the city\u2019s lead planner for the central area, called the plan a \u201cframework\u201d for making downtown \u201cas livable and as vibrant as we possibly can.\u201d That means building apartments \u2014 a lot of them. Consultants estimate downtown could add as many as 68,500 housing units over the next 20 years, largely rentals, and absorb as many as 126,000 residents.\nThe city projects demand for more than 100 million square feet of development based on population and job growth, available land and\nvacancy trends\n. Roughly one-third of that footprint could come from redeveloping vacant or underused parcels. While demand for office and retail space is weak, the plan assumes existing vacant inventory and ground-floor retail in mixed-use projects will meet near-term needs.\nMuch of the new housing supply is expected to come from office-to-residential conversions, an approach the city has already begun to subsidize along LaSalle Street. The draft calls for more conversions and zoning tweaks to support higher density on smaller sites, citing recent projects at 65 East Wacker Place and 500 North Michigan Avenue as examples.\nHousing diversity and affordability are recurring themes. Planning Commissioner Ciere Boatright said the goal is to ensure that the office security guard or waitress can live downtown, not just\nhigh earners\n.\n\nThe plan encourages incentives for family-sized apartments and workforce housing for residents earning between 60 percent and 120 percent of area median income. Long-term, the city aims to expand support for affordable\nownership\nmodels such as land trusts and down-payment programs.\nTo serve a denser\ndowntown\n, the draft calls for more grocery stores, child care and K-12 options, along with retail subsidies to strengthen street-level activity. Developers are expected to respond to market realities \u2014 as one broker told the outlet, \u201cLet\u2019s get them open and occupied and then see what could be needed.\u201d\nTransit is another centerpiece. The plan backs new CTA stops on the Brown and Pink Lines, a long-discussed Metra commuter rail station in Fulton Market, and extending the Riverwalk north and south. The city also wants to explore infill Red Line stops and more robust water taxi and bus connections.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A developer\u2019s office renovation in the heart of San Francisco\u2019s Financial District aims to take tenant amenities to the next level as office demand heats up with the AI boom.\nPresidio Bay Ventures\nstarted construction at 88 Spear Street, an 11-story, 56-year-old office asset the firm\nacquired\nfor $41 million, the San Francisco Standard\nreported\n. When it picked up the 166,500-square-foot property two years ago, it committed another $50 million to renovating the building. That would put the cost at $300 per square foot.\nThe renovation will add two floors to the building, previously known as\n60 Spear Street\n, including a rooftop event space and restaurant with a panoramic city view, and in the basement, a luxury spa with a sauna and two pools. The updates include an open-floor-plan lobby with an Arsicault Bakery location.\nPresidio Bay is the latest to redevelop a San Francisco office building into an upscale destination for tenants wanting offices swirling with amenities.\nDemand is building, but there is no new supply, said Presidio Bay Managing Principal Cyrus Sanandaji. The firm calls the development an\n\u201coffice resort\u201d\namong the trend of \u201cflight to experience.\u201d\n\u201cWhen every building has the same amenities, nothing differentiates one from the other,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you have then is just a commodity. And there\u2019s already plenty of that.\u201d\n\nMayor Daniel Lurie is hoping to make it easier for office building owners to create amenity spaces for tenants, in hopes of beating down San Francisco\u2019s office vacancy numbers. Lurie\nproposed legislation\nin May that would let downtown building owners bypass the approval process and transform ground-floor commercial spaces zoned for retail into nonretail office amenities like gyms and lounges.\nSanandaji said the process for this project was speedier than usual, and the building is projected to open in about a year.\n\u201cThree years ago, San Francisco was redlined,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, investors are looking around the country for the best place to get a return, and they\u2019re finding it here, where there are sales to be had and the market is about to run up.\u201d\nEach floor at 88 Spear is about 17,000 square feet, with floors three through six connected by a staircase.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to pigeonhole ourselves in terms of tenants,\u201d said CBRE\u2019s Chris Famulener, who\u2019s in charge of leasing. \u201cWe have lofty expectations for the rents we want to hit, so it has to be a group that\u2019s excited about what\u2019s going on there.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Artimus Construction is switching sales teams at Circa Central Park \u2014 again.\nThe developer hired Nest Seekers to take over the remaining eight units at the 285 West 110th Street project, adding another brokerage to a long list of firms tasked with offloading condos since sales launched eight years ago.\nNest Seekers\u2019 vice president of new development sales, Xiao Rui Lin-Ruan, will spearhead marketing at the building. Rui said she was introduced to the team at Artimus by the developer of 145 Central Park North, a neighboring luxury development where she has led sales for nearly two years. She found a buyer for the building\u2019s last unit just last week.\nThe developers \u201clooked at our success selling the final residence to see what they could switch up,\u201d Rui said.\n\u201cCirca is further along, but the remaining inventory is similar,\u201d she added, pointing to the mix of three- and four-bedroom units. The developers \u201cbuilt both of these buildings with larger layouts\u201d because they anticipated demand for more space would be higher among buyers attracted to the Central Park-adjacent location.\nPrices of the unsold units range from around $2.4 million to $4.8 million. A team with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices is still representing one of the remaining condos, Unit 5G, though a spokesperson for Nest Seekers said the apartment will transfer to the firm if it hasn\u2019t sold by Nov. 1, when the existing exclusive agreement is set to expire.\n\nCorcoran agent and former \u201cMillion Dollar Listing New York\u201d cast member Steve Gold previously led sales at the project, including\nsnagging a record deal\nfor the penthouse. Gold sold the 3700-square-foot apartment in 2018 for $9.4 million, which was at the time the most expensive sale in uptown Manhattan.\nTwo years later, the developer brought\nCompass\u2019 Rachel Glazer\non board to sell three units at the building, though she was dropped from the project in 2022.\nAt the time, Glazer\ndenied any \u201cdrama\u201d\nbetween her, Gold and the developers and instead told\nThe Real Deal\n, \u201cI don\u2019t think they need all these cooks in the kitchen at this point.\u201d\nHowever, between then and now, who exactly was in charge of deals at the building was murkier. Shlomi Reuveni of Reuveni Development Marketing took over some of the remaining listings last year, though teams with Douglas Elliman and BHHS each had one apartment under their purview, according to Streeteasy.\n\u201cI was adamant that, for me to take on the project, I would need a better idea of where the inventory remained,\u201d Rui said of the developer\u2019s decision to consolidate the unsold units with Nest Seekers. \u201cI had a clear narrative for buyers at 145 Central Park North. Storytelling is important, and I wanted to bring that same strategy to Circa.\u201d\nRui added that one of the main draws for the 38-unit building is its low monthly common charges due to a 25-year tax abatement under the state\u2019s 421a program, which won\u2019t expire until 2041. Its amenities include a 24-hour attended lobby, fitness center, parking and terrace.\nThe stepped building wrapped in glass was branded a \u201cdeath trap\u201d for birds in 2020, leading many of its residents to band together to try and\nprevent birds from colliding\nwith its windows. Owners then began installing dot stickers designed to alert birds to windows before crashing into them, though some worried the translucent additions would ruin their views of Central Park.\n",

        "pub_date_dt": "2025-10-08T11:30:00",
        "content": "A few days after Assembly member Zohran \u201cRent Freeze\u201d Mamdani won the Democratic primary, which I called a\ncrushing defeat\nfor real estate, I wrote a column listing a few ways he could\nhelp the industry\n.\nAmong them were rezoning to add housing,\nweakening member deference\nin the City Council, supporting the\nCity Charter revisions\n, adding rental vouchers and making them\neasier to use\n, increasing staff to ease bottlenecks at the Department of Housing Preservation and Development and persuading Albany to reform property taxes.\nMamdani hasn\u2019t taken a position on charter reform, but he will probably have to soon because reporters will increasingly ask him about it as Election Day nears. But he has already endorsed the other five measures listed above.\nThe last of these, property taxes, is the most important.\nThe New York Apartment Association calculated that taxes this year will rise about $100 per apartment in rent-stabilized buildings because their tentative assessed values increased 2.75 percent.\nThat means tenants in these apartments will send almost $4,000 a year to the government, as the group\u2019s CEO, Kenny Burgos, said in a podcast. Of course, it\u2019s owners, not tenants, who pay the taxes, but the NYAA phrases it differently because it\u2019s the only hope of getting the state legislature to reduce multifamily tax rates.\nIt will take a lot more than that to move Albany, though. Property tax reform will never happen without a hard push from a popular mayor.\nThe time for mayors to ask for big changes from the state is immediately after taking office, when they have political capital from winning (aka a mandate).\nUnfortunately, Mamdani\u2019s promise on property taxes is to propose comprehensive changes by the end of his second year. That would mean no action by Albany until at least 2028.\nNot only is that a long time for bereft owners of rent-stabilized buildings to wait, but by then, who knows if Mamdani will have any political capital left? Two years is a lifetime in politics, as Eric Adams could tell you.\nBoth Adams and Bill de Blasio talked about the importance of property tax reform but made\nno real effort\nto achieve it because any change would involve raising taxes on someone.\nHowever, that shouldn\u2019t be an impediment to Mamdani, who has already called for higher taxes on the rich and said private homes in gentrified neighborhoods should be taxed more. Landlords generally agree.\nBurgos said on his\npodcast\nthat a $2,500-a-month apartment pays (indirectly) the same property taxes as a $1 million single-family home, and rental properties pay higher taxes than homes of the same size in the same neighborhood.\nBurgos and Mamdani, who were classmates at Bronx High School of Science and Democratic colleagues in the Assembly, have already met once since the primary. Discussions were held last week for the NYAA to meet with Mamdani advisers, which may yet happen.\n\n\u201cProperty tax reform is critical,\u201d Burgos said on the podcast. \u201cAt the very least, rent-stabilized buildings shouldn\u2019t be overtaxed while they are simultaneously being defunded by rent adjustments that don\u2019t keep up with inflation.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nOwners of buildings sometimes resist efforts to landmark them because it makes even the simplest of renovations more difficult and expensive. But now, under City of Yes, landmark status allows the owner to sell air rights to 10 times more sites than before, and the sale process takes only six to nine months instead of two or three years. Will any building owners seek landmark status in order to sell their air rights? Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The senior prosecutor investigating Trumped-up mortgage fraud allegations against New York Attorney General Letitia James has told colleagues she will advise her new boss, interim U.S. attorney Lindsey Halligan, to drop the matter \u2014 against the president\u2019s wishes \u2014 because there is no probable cause to file charges, MSNBC\nreported\n. Halligan\u2019s predecessor, a Trump nominee, resigned rather than bring the case. My\nSept. 23 column\nexplains why the case is so weak.\nElsewhere\u2026\nIf the bill passed by the City Council requiring gas appliances to be\ninstalled by a master plumber\nbecomes law, will landlords simply buy electric stoves instead? That\u2019s not an option in many older buildings, one landlord told me.\n\u201cThe wiring in the majority of rent-stabilized apartments would not support [electric stoves],\u201d he said. \u201cAnd basically not in all pre-war rent-stabilized.\u201d\nAfter upgrading stoves in a certain number of apartments, the owner ends up having to upgrade the entire building\u2019s incoming service and risers \u201cbecause the old wiring would not support the increased load without dramatically increasing the risk of electrical fires.\u201d\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$15.5 million\nfor two adjacent houses at 809-815 Avenue J in Midwood. The lots total 8,000 square feet.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$92 million\nfor the Hilton Garden Inn at 30 West 46th Street in Times Square. The hotel is 21 stories and has 196 rooms.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $25 million for a 9,308-square-foot townhouse at 7 East 80th Street on the Upper East Side. Serena Boardman of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has\nthe listing\n.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "Do you remember this New York Times\nheadline\nfrom February 2024?\nThey\u2019re Starting a New York \u2018Housing League.\u2019 NIMBYs Not Allowed.\nVirtually nothing has been heard from the\nhousing league\nsince. But that\u2019s by design, a co-founder told me.\nI took the opportunity to ask Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso about the group when I was interviewing him about his\nseemingly rogue\nPlanning Commission appointee.\nI assumed nothing had come of the housing league, because I had seen no mention of it in the media, press releases or anywhere else since it first convened at Brooklyn Borough Hall.\nBut that is not the case, Reynoso told me. He said the group tries to meet every month. More than 10 elected officials regularly attend, and others come occasionally.\n\u201cYou must be serving good food,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no food,\u201d Reynoso replied.\n\nThe purpose of the gatherings is to talk about how to support a pro-housing agenda. However, elected officials are welcome to attend even if they are not in the YIMBY camp. \u201cWe want to have a big tent,\u201d Reynoso said.\nHe and Manhattan City Council member Erik Bottcher invited 160 elected officials to the first get-together. One reason the league has not been heard from since is that it takes no official positions. It\u2019s not even a formal organization. But it does do things, according to Reynoso.\nFor example, the housing league pushed for elected officials to sign on to an\namicus brief\nsupporting the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity against a\nlegal challenge\n. At least 29 elected officials, including Assembly member Zohran Mamdani, have done so.\nThe league also encouraged its members (although technically, there is no formal membership) to support Council member Shahana Hanif\u2019s negotiated rezoning for the\nArrow Linen project\nin Windsor Terrace.\nA\nvocal NIMBY group\nhad formed to demand the project\u2019s height be reduced by half, and\nvowed to unelect Hanif\nif she refused. The opposition group\nfailed miserably\n. Hanif only trimmed the height of the project. She kept its unit count intact and instead insisted on deeper affordability. Then she\nwon re-election handily\nagainst a well-funded opponent.\nIt was also a win for progressives and supporters of the abundance strategy to alleviate the housing shortage.\n(Disclaimer: It remains to be seen if the Arrow Linen project will pencil out under the state\u2019s 485x tax abatement. A project is not truly a project until it gets a construction loan. If developer Andrew Esposito doesn\u2019t get financing, it would likely be because Hanif demanded too many low-rent units.)\nReynoso said the housing league would also back elected officials who support future housing development at the Pacific Park (formerly Atlantic Yards) site, as well as other projects \u201cthat might on occasion face local backlash or political backlash.\u201d\n",

However, such sales are still above pre-pandemic norms, with the bulk of cash purchases happening at both the highest and lowest ends of the pricing spectrum, according to the listings platform.\nIn New York, 40.9 percent of homes were bought in cash in the first half of the year, down 12 percent year over year.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

The 3-acre spread, dubbed Facade Nord, sits along Eagle Mountain Lake and pairs medieval flair with modern convenience, including elevator access across four stories, according to\nMySA.com\nand first reported in\nMansion Global\n.\nThe home was listed Sept. 25 by Keller Williams Fort Worth broker Kristen Holle.\nBuilt in 1998 by the late attorney Eugene Gittings de Bullet who died in January, the 6,600-square-foot main residence features four bedrooms, four-and-a-half bathrooms and cathedral-style living areas illuminated by chandeliers. Excluding other buildings on the property, the price comes out to about $724 per square foot.\nThat\u2019s nowhere near the city\u2019s highest asking price record \u2014 listed this year \u2014 for the 8,000-square-foot River Hills estate at\n3736 Aviemore Drive\nfor just under $17 million, or $2,125 per square foot.\n\nGittings de Bullet designed the home after learning Buchanan Castle was part of his ancestral lineage \u2014 and he set out to recreate its turrets, towers and stone grandeur on Texas soil, Holle said.\nThe property also includes a carriage house with a kitchen and bathroom, a lakeside guest house and a boathouse and dock extending into Eagle Mountain Lake.\nThe estate\u2019s location 30 minutes from downtown Fort Worth offers seclusion and as well as city access.\nThat proximity has only grown more valuable as Fort Worth cements itself as one of Texas\u2019 fastest-growing\nurban hubs\n. The city\u2019s population jumped 2.3 percent year-over-year, recently surpassing Austin among the state\u2019s four largest cities, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\nCowtown\nedged out a growth rate of 7.7 percent from 2020 to 2024.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The property features two storefronts leased to shoemaker Birkenstock and luggage shop Rimowa.\nThe deal breaks down to nearly $3,800 a square foot for the two-story building that spans 7,106 square feet. It was completed in 2014. The property sold for $5.5 million above the previous sale price nine years ago.\nThe seller, an affiliate of Norfolk, Virginia-based Harbor Group International, led by president T.

The firm bought the property, leased to seafood restaurant Catch, from Miami-based retail and hospitality real estate investor Robert Rivani.\nPrimarily focused on acquiring retail properties in its home city in Texas, River Oaks dipped into the South Florida market in 2022. The firm acquired Shop Delray, a grocery-anchored shopping center in Delray Beach, for\n$25.5 million\n. Founded in 1959, River Oaks has a portfolio of more than 190 shopping centers and single-tenant retail properties, the firm\u2019s website states.\nThe Miami Design District is arguably South Florida\u2019s hottest retail submarket. Last month, Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega\u2019s family office, Ponte Gadea, picked up Atlas Plaza at 130 Northeast 40th Street for roughly\n$110 million\n. The property\u2019s tenants include a Rolex store and Michael\u2019s Genuine, one of the district\u2019s longest running restaurants.\nIn July, Beverly Hills-based jeweler Ildico bought a two-story retail building at 3800 Northeast Second Avenue for\n$35 million\n.

        "content": "A home designer and his family are getting ready to say good-bye to their custom Brentwood estate with the property now in contract.\nThe $26.5 million asking price on 127 South Burlingame Avenue equates to $2,944 per square foot and makes it last week\u2019s top home to go into contract, according to the\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n.\nThe report is produced by Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team and counts Multiple Listing Service properties of $4 million or more.\nThe home is being sold by Muskoka Living founder Cory DeFrancisco and his wife Catherine DeFrancisco, according to property records.\nThe Agency\u2019s H. Blair Chang and LeAnne Thrasher hold the listing.\nMuskoka Living makes and sells furniture and also provides design services. Started in 1998, the company has showrooms in Gardena, Calif. where it also has its manufacturing facility, and in Muskoka, Canada.\nThe DeFranciscos snapped up the property in 2020 for $7.4 million, according to records. They then went to work rebuilding and redesigning the home, which was completed in 2022.\nBrentwood is part of the city of Los Angeles, making the deal subject to the Measure United to House L.A. (Measure ULA)\u00a0 two-tiered tax. If it sells above $10.6 million, as likely in this instance,\u00a0 the higher tax bracket of 5.5 percent will apply.\n\nThe seven-bed, seven-bath home spans 9,000 square feet. Most of the home\u2019s furniture, cabinetry and flooring was created by Muskoka Living. Each bedroom has its own private terrace, while olive and citrus trees dot the backyard. There\u2019s also a pool, spa, detached guest house and sports court.\nLast week\u2019s second-priciest\u00a0 home to go into contract was 620 North Bedford Drive in the Beverly Hills Flats neighborhood, with a list price of nearly $22 million, or just under $2,000 per square foot.\nThat comes on the heels of the closing off market of\n722 North Maple Drive\n, which sold for $22.4 million, or $2,571 per square foot, over the weekend. The Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Jack Harris and Michael Fahimian represented a local family in its purchase of the property, while Keller Williams\u2019 Gary Gold was the listing agent.\nThe Bedford Drive home counts seven beds and nine baths across 11,000 square feet. Highlights of the contemporary-designed residence include a motor court, glass-enclosed wine storage, theater, wellness suite and sauna, basketball court and pool.\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s Aaron Kirman and Jordana Leigh have the listing.\nProperty records indicate the seller is a trust tied to Jessee and Rebecca Sarshar.\nOverall, Los Angeles County signed contracts last week tallied up to $227.5 million in listing price volume across 23 properties, according to the Eklund Gomes report. That comes to around $9.9 million per deal, with$2,035 per square foot on average for the bunch.\nCompared to the year-ago period, signed contracts last week were off by four deals and up 9.4 percent in asking volume.\n",

        "content": "When Emelia Arencibia moved to Brickell Key in 2016, she thought that her one-bedroom condo would mark her final home. Then, she had to cover her share of a large assessment to pay for upgrades and repairs to her building after the deadly\nSurfside condo collapse\nin 2021.\nArencibia\u2019s share of the assessment at Brickell Key Two in Miami was about $47,000, and she was able to secure a zero-interest loan for which she will have to start making payments next year.\nThe financing, she said, \u201csaved my life, and saves a lot of people\u2019s lives on this island.\u201d\nThe 75-year-old is among many owners on fixed incomes on\nBrickell Key\nwho now have to worry about paying for the next big project: a multimillion-dollar replacement of the seawall that surrounds the man-made island. The Brickell Key Master Association, of which Swire Properties has a controlling vote, is spearheading the project.\nBrickell Key, formerly called Claughton Island, was developed beginning in 1982 with the completion of Brickell Key One. The island consists of 11 condo buildings, ground-floor retail space, and the Courvoisier Centre office buildings. Swire first bought a stake in the island in the late 1970s.\nAn estimate that the master association included in a Sept. 10 presentation pegs the total cost of the seawall replacement at $33.6 million, with construction potentially starting in 2026.\nUnit owners at Brickell Key\u2019s nearly 3,000 condos could pay via a lump sum, quarterly for 3.5 years, or with a seven-year loan, according to the presentation.\nThe cost per unit will depend on which payment option owners select, from about $6 per square foot to more than $8 per square foot. That ranges in total from a $3,581 lump sum for a 600-square-foot unit to $5,565 for the same sized unit. Larger condos of 2,500 square feet would pay $14,921 (lump sum) to $20,319 if financed.\nSome unit owners allege that\nSwire\nProperties\u2019 U.S. arm, led by President Henry Bott, is pushing the project through now because it also plans to replace the seawall where the\nMandarin Residences\nluxury condo development will be built. Swire controls the master association even though it only controls that site.\nThe Mandarin project surpassed $1 billion in presales earlier this year. Remaining units start at about $5 million.\nSwire has an application pending with the city of Miami to demolish the existing Mandarin hotel at 500 Brickell Key Drive via implosion, likely next year. It plans to then build the two-tower, 228-unit luxury condo and hotel project with additional hotel rooms and condo-hotel units.\nOwners from six condo associations \u2014 Brickell Key One, Brickell Key Two, Isola, the St. Louis, Corvoisier Courts and Carbonell \u2014 hired an attorney to engage with the master association and Swire regarding the seawall replacement and planned renovation of the baywalk. In a letter sent to Brickell Key condo owners in September, attorney Carl Goldfarb wrote that Swire and the master association have ignored the condo associations\u2019 requests to meet face to face to discuss the seawall and baywalk projects.\n\u201cThis work conveniently coincides with the timing of Swire\u2019s plans for development of the Residences at the Mandarin Oriental, even though the August 6, 2024 seawall inspection report commissioned by the BKMA concluded, \u2018No immediate structural repairs are required at this time,\u2019\u201d the letter from Goldfarb states.\nThe August 2024 seawall inspection report states that \u201cno significant settlement of the seawall structure was observed during the inspection,\u201d and that significant seawall deterioration was not noted compared to 2023. \u201cHowever, in comparison with prior years, dating back to the first such inspection in 2014, the progression of deterioration is noted, outside of the 2018 repair project,\u201d the letter states.\nA spokesperson for Swire said the company has been transparent with Brickell Key residents, and hosted more than 10 town hall meetings with residents in recent months.\nThe seawall is required to be maintained to provide protection against a 100-year flood. An annual inspection is also required, records show.\n\nSome owners on Brickell Key and across the waterway off of\nBrickell\nAvenue are also concerned that the proposed implosion of the Mandarin hotel and the construction of the new towers will impact the existing seawall, which was built in 1973. A geotechnical report completed in early 2024 states that \u201cconstruction-related vibrations could impact the seawall as well.\u201d But the damage caused to adjacent structures are \u201ctypically cosmetic in nature\u201d the report states.\nSwire plans to pay for roughly 20 percent of the estimated $33.6 million cost of the seawall project, according to a presentation made by BKMA\u2019s General Manager Anna Brautigam in April, which sources confirmed. That represents the 1,300-linear-foot portion of the seawall that fronts the Mandarin Residences project site. BKMA would be responsible for the remaining 4,600 linear feet.\nHowever, the Brickell Key Master Association\u2019s governing documents would require only a 1.8 percent contribution from Swire. The association was formed in 1982. Swire\u2019s voting majority still exists because the company still owns land on the island. Until it completes the Mandarin Residences project, sells the units and turns control over to the unit owners, it will retain the same amount of control as it currently has.\nSwire\u2019s planned contribution \u201cexceeds its pro-rata share according to the governing documents,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nUnit owners\u2019 contributions will be calculated based on their interior square footage and 50 percent of their balcony space. BKMA plans to begin collecting payments sometime during the first quarter of next year, Brautigam said during the April presentation. BKMA will offer unit owners financing and has term sheets from Banco Popular and BankUnited.\nConfusion and disputes over responsibility for payment have spread to other issues.\nA decade ago, the Miami City Commission voted to amend the 1975 development order for Brickell Key. The amendment requires Swire to \u201cdedicate, develop, and perpetually maintain 2.5-acre linear waterfront park and an additional 0.25 acre public park on Brickell Key, design and location to be determined by Swire,\u201d according to the 2015 approval.\u00a0The amendment increased the number of residential units and decreased the commercial space that could be built on the island.\nTodd Worthe, who owns a three-bedroom condo at Carbonell on Brickell Key, believes that Swire should reimburse unit owners for the cost of maintenance and security for the park over the past 10 years.\n\u201cSwire agreed to maintain the public park in perpetuity,\u201d Worthe said. \u201cIt\u2019s been the residents, not Swire, who have been assessed and paying for the maintenance and security. And it\u2019s open to the public. If we\u2019re going to pay for it, shouldn\u2019t it be privatized?\u201d\nThe Swire spokesperson said the 1975 development order and the 2015 amendment \u201cdo not impose any obligations of operating expenses to Swire Properties.\u201d\nFor the seawall project, two buildings, St. Louis and Isola, may be in a different situation than the other buildings. St. Louis and Isola control their seawalls, but they are subject to BKMA\u2019s seawall covenant, Brautigam said in a letter.\n\u201cChoosing to replace their seawalls separately could present several challenges for these associations, and we believe both buildings stand to benefit greatly from being part of the larger project,\u201d she wrote.\nArencibia said she\u2019s spoken to neighbors who believe they had to pay their shares by Oct. 1. Others haven\u2019t yet received estimates of their share of the seawall project.\nThe years of construction and additional cost could force Arencibia to sell her condo, where she expected to live the rest of her years.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I cannot pay the amount or ask for another loan,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel very insecure about it.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A Midtown office building that\nfailed to find any bidders at auction\nlast year has traded in a landmark sale for its newly rezoned neighborhood.\nMarty Burger and Andrew Heiberger paid $25 million for the 85,000-square-foot building at 29 West 35th Street with plans to convert it into 107 studio apartments, the developers announced on Wednesday. The deal was backed by financing from Allegiant and 400CM, with David Levinson of L&amp;L and Terracotta Management joining as equity partners.\nThe project is among the first office-to-residential conversions in the\nrezoned corridor\nin Midtown South, which the City Council approved in August. The rezoning, dubbed the Midtown South Mixed-Use Plan, spans 42 blocks and is expected to yield more than 9,500 housing units.\n\u201cWe leaned on the fact that it was in the Midtown South rezoning area,\u201d said Colliers\u2019 Zach Redding, whose team represented the special servicer. \u201cWhen we signed the contract, it hadn\u2019t passed yet, but all signs were pointing toward it working out.\u201d\nRedding was joined by other members of the firm\u2019s New York Capital Markets Group, including Dylan Kane and Matt Mastrocola. Ben Schlegel of Ariel Property Advisors represented the developers in the financing deal.\n\nBarry Sternlicht\u2019s LNR took the office building from its owners last September after an auction for the property\nfailed to attract\nany bidders. The bidding threshold was set at $23 million, which would work out to roughly $270 per square foot \u2014 a price lower than the $30 million Paul Sohayegh and Roni Movahedian paid for it in 2007 and significantly below the $80 million they sought for it in 2017.\nLNR\nfiled to foreclose\non the property in 2022 after Sohayegh and Movahedian defaulted on a $41 million loan. At the time, a referee appointed by a judge in the case estimated that the landlords owed their lender more than $50 million.\nThe joint venture between Burger\u2019s firm, Infinite Global Real Estate Partners, and Burger\u2019s Buttonwood Development will lean on the 467m tax abatement for the project, which will include 27 affordable apartments priced at around $1,700 a month.\nThe apartments will range from 475 to 500 square feet with ceiling heights between 11 and 14 feet. Most of the units will include \u201cflexible spaces such as home offices, alcoves or bonus rooms,\u201d according to the press release.\nPlanned amenities at the building, the conversion of which will be designed by Ismael Leyva Architects, include doormen, a pet washing station and rooftop outfitted with game tables and an outdoor movie screen.\n",

        "content": "Warning signs that Trinity Flood\u2019s Chicago real estate portfolio could land in trouble quickly piled up after the little-known Wisconsin-based investor bought a trio of apartment complexes in 2020.\nAlthough it may not have been obvious five years ago that one of Flood\u2019s South Side buildings would become the site of a\nmassive federal immigration raid\nand the subject of national controversy, the property\u2019s chaotic backstory illustrates how a transaction gone wrong can devolve into a precarious situation for an entire neighborhood.\nVarious legal filings reveal that opportunities to address disarray at the property came and went without action from the landlord or Cook County\u2019s court system.\nThe consequences of that inaction culminated last week when residents woke up in the middle of the night to hundreds of federal agents descending on the building from trucks and helicopters. They arrested dozens and reportedly detained many more tenants, including children, during the operation.\nIn the aftermath of the raid, local and state officials criticized the tactics and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker called on state agencies to investigate if federal agents used excessive force against minors.\nThe first signal of trouble at the property came from Flood over five years ago, shortly after she purchased the building and two others nearby for $18 million total.\nBuyer\u2019s remorse\nA few months after buying the apartments in 2020 as part of a 1031 exchange, Flood filed a lawsuit against the seller and brokers involved in the purchase.\nSuch 1031 deals allow investors to defer taxes on the sale of real estate if they reinvest the proceeds into a new property transaction within certain timelines. So Flood had to move fast.\nShe purchased the South Shore Drive building as a part of a portfolio that also included 6916 South Clyde Avenue and 7038 South Chappel Avenue.\nA few months after buying the properties, Flood accused seller\nDaniel Hedaya of DAX Real Estate\nand his brokers,\nAaron Sklar and Noah Birk\nof Chicago-based Kiser Group, of improperly inflating the property values.\nFlood called out the conditions of the South Shore Drive property, where the unsettling raid would later take place, including the need for around-the-clock, on-site security that cost $15,000 monthly. She claimed the prior owner didn\u2019t make her aware of the security requirements, and its brokers prevented her from touring more than two of the 130 units in the complex because the building was almost entirely occupied.\nFlood pointed out the portfolio had last sold for $11 million in 2017 prior to DAX\u2019s renovations. She alleged the brokers told her the jump in value was due to the improvements and increase in occupancy at the buildings. Hedaya told\nThe Real Deal\nin 2019 that his firm spent \u201cseveral million dollars\u201d on the projects.\nBut at 7500 South Shore, Flood claimed she had been told that all units in the building were renovated when in reality, 21 had been left untouched. She further alleged that the scope of the renovations throughout the building had been exaggerated or misstated.\nThe parties reached a confidential settlement in October 2023, but by then Flood was racking up significant city code violations on at least two of her three Chicago buildings. Kiser Group\u2019s Sklar declined to comment and Birk didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nCity\u2019s suspicions\nIn August 2021, about a year-and-a-half after Flood purchased the portfolio, a fire broke out at the 6916 Clyde Avenue building, injuring four tenants and a firefighter. As the city began monitoring the building for code violations, it was also tracking similar problems at 7500 South Shore.\nSince 2021, the buildings have racked up dozens of code violations, most of which are associated with the South Shore Drive building.\nWhile conditions continued to deteriorate, Flood\nattempted to sell the portfolio last year\nbut never closed a deal.\n\nIssues documented as recently as this summer at the South Shore Drive property include \u201cinoperable elevators, flooding, stench of urine in the stairways, and armed occupants along with alleged criminal activity and shootings at the property,\u201d an email from the city legal department stated.\nThe email, which was sent in August, went on to note that the city hadn\u2019t conducted a full interior inspection of the property due to security concerns and a shooting that took place on June 23 during an inspection.\nWhen Flood failed to resolve the issues, Chicago officials requested in August that Cook County Circuit Court Judge Leonard Murray appoint a limited receiver for the building to help kickstart work on the property. The request is still pending in court.\nGetting a receiver appointed to a building can be a lengthy process, even in cases where a building is in dire condition, said Eric Janssen, a receiver and founder of Chicago Real Estate Resources.\n\u201cSometimes it takes a while for both sides to go back and forth and for a receiver to be ultimately appointed,\u201d Janssen said. \u201cAnd each judge is different.\u201d\nIn the meantime, the portfolio began to run into financial trouble, as well.\nLender closes in\nAs the code violations accumulated,\nFlood was hit with a $27 million foreclosure lawsuit\nin April 2025, alleging she was behind on loan payments and had failed to insure the South Shore Drive building.\nIn addition to the South Side portfolio that Flood bought for $18 million, the investor also purchased three properties in Georgia and one in Arizona with a $25.3 million loan. The loans against all six properties were later packaged up with other real estate debt and sold off to commercial mortgage-backed securities investors. Now, Flood is in danger of losing all 354 units across the nation, including the 208 in Chicago\u2019s South Shore neighborhood.\nRather than forfeit the struggling properties via foreclosure, Flood fought back, seeking to retain her control.\nAmid the legal-back-and-forth, Wells Fargo, which was representing the trustees of the debt package, repeatedly requested that a judge appoint a receiver to the South Shore Drive property. Flood successfully delayed such an appointment multiple times.\nThe debate was raging just days before the raid.\nA recent legal filing from Wells Fargo stated that the lender first requested the appointment of a receiver in May. After Flood\u2019s resistance, Wells Fargo went on to state that \u201cnow, four months later, the condition of the South Shore Property is worse than before and the appointment of a receiver has become urgent.\u201d\nWells Fargo filed an emergency motion on September 22 requesting, once again, that Cook County Circuit Court Judge Debra Seaton appoint a receiver.\nFlood hit back, stating that an ongoing dispute over a lender-placed insurance plan needed to be resolved first.\nEight days later, federal agents stormed the building, ultimately arresting 37 people who were \u201cbelieved to be involved in drug trafficking and distribution, weapons crimes, and immigration violators,\u201d according to a statement from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Further information on the severity of the alleged crimes has been limited so far.\nIllinois and Chicago officials have also alleged the agents infringed on the rights of other tenants in the building who were detained outside and who may have suffered from lost or damaged property.\nIt\u2019s unclear how the property got onto the federal government\u2019s radar but Chicago officials said they didn\u2019t know about the raid ahead of time or collaborate with federal law enforcement agencies on the operation.\nThe day after the raid, Seaton agreed to appoint a receiver to the property at an Oct. 17 court hearing. She hasn\u2019t yet determined who the receiver will be despite Wells Fargo putting forth several specific options throughout the legal process.\n",

        "content": "Landlord and tenants\u2019 rights have been thrust into debate as tensions flare between local and federal authorities over the handling of immigration enforcement in Chicago.\nLegal recourse is another matter, and landlords have little in that vein as\nuncertainty swirls around how\nthey can respond to intensifying federal policing across the city.\n\u201cThe bottom line is, there is not much a landlord can do as it relates to police conduct within their building, whether in a common area or a tenant\u2019s apartment,\u201d said Monu Bedi, a DePaul University College of Law Professor who specializes in criminal procedure and military law. \u201cIf there is damage to the building, landlords are able to recover money for the property but that is different than their rights to prevent officers from entering.\u201d\nLocal and state officials are calling into question the tactics used last week by hundreds of federal agents to raid\na 130-unit South Shore apartment complex\nat 7500 South South Shore Drive, and whether they violated typical criminal procedure while arresting dozens and reportedly detaining many more tenants, including children, temporarily during the operation.\nIllinois Governor J.B. Pritzker on Monday called on the state Department of Child and Family Services and the Department of Human Services to investigate if federal agents used excessive force against minors.\nMeanwhile, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul is seeking an emergency order to block President Donald Trump\u2019s request to activate the National Guard in Chicago. The Oct. 6 filing refers to the South Shore raid as an example of federal authorities\u2019 already extensive presence in Chicago and possible overreach of immigration officers\u2019 duties.\n\u201cWhile it is not clear whether any part of that conduct was within any lawful federal authority, [federal officials] were not impeded in executing this large-scale planned operation,\u201d the filing reads.\nA judge declined to grant Raoul\u2019s request on an immediate basis but set a hearing on the matter for Thursday, even as President Donald Trump hinted Tuesday he could invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy military troops to various cities, should a court order blocking such action arise.\nAlong with Raoul\u2019s litigation, several law enforcement officials and business leaders filed declarations supporting the attorney\u2019s general\u2019s request. Among them was the former commissioner of Customs and Border Patrol, R. Gil Kerlikowske, and prominent business lobbyists whose groups touch on real estate matters, such as Jack Lavin, president of the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, and Sam Toia, president of the Illinois Restaurant Association.\nAlso on Monday, Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order aimed at prohibiting\nICE activity\non city-owned properties.\nAnd on Tuesday, a U.S. District Judge in Chicago ruled that federal immigration agents illegally arrested 26 people without warrants back in January, violating a 2023 consent decree that dictates how such arrests can be carried out.\nAt least one Chicago landlord has faced public pressure to push back against ICE. Organizers on the Southwest Side on Tuesday called on Michigan-based Friedman Real Estate to block ICE from using one of its parking lots at The Yards Plaza as a staging area for agents, Block Club Chicago reported. Friedman hasn\u2019t made any public response as of yet, and didn\u2019t return the outlet\u2019s request for comment.\n\nGroups like the National Apartment Association have\nput together guidance\non how to respond to ICE actions like subpoenas and raids. Key points include:\nProperty managers are not required to allow ICE agents to enter a building unless they have a criminal warrant signed by a judge.\nProperty owners can consult with an attorney before responding to a subpoena for information about tenants.\nThere\u2019s little precedent, however, for the way ICE has been operating in Chicago, said Hugh Mundy, a law professor at The University of Illinois at Chicago who specializes in criminal procedure.\n\u201cThis [South Shore] raid was really unlike anything that I have witnessed, either as a lawyer or as a law professor,\u201d he said. He added that a warrant typically targets specific units rather than an entire building.\nThe operation resulted in 37 arrests. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security identified two people arrested as alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren De Aragua, and an unspecified number of suspects were \u201cbelieved to be involved in drug trafficking and distribution and weapons crimes,\u201d according to the agency. Other arrests were due to immigration violations.\nMundy said the scale of the raid \u2014 which involved multiple agencies and officers arriving in helicopters and trucks in the middle of the night \u2014 seemed more fitting for a racketeering investigation.\n\u201cYou would normally expect that kind of force to result in more arrests for more serious crimes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019d have to be some general collective knowledge or a common goal and crimes that relate to that goal.\u201d\nStill, city officials, the property owner, lender and more real estate professionals were informed of problems the building was facing well before the raid took place.\nChicago code inspectors visited the property just two weeks before it was subject to the massive operation, according to a legal filing in a\n$27 million foreclosure lawsuit\nagainst the building\u2019s owner, Wisconsin-based investor Trinity Flood. The building was found to be unsecured, leading to increased criminal activity and shootings, and its property manager lost control of the situation as conditions worsened, according to legal filings.\nA spokesperson for the mayor\u2019s office said the city was unaware the raid would take place ahead of time and that the city didn\u2019t collaborate with federal immigration officials to conduct the operation.",

        "content": "Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega completed his $274.4 million purchase of Sabadell Financial Center in Brickell, marking the biggest office deal in South Florida so far this year.\nOrtega\u2019s Ponte Gadea investment family office bought the 30-story tower at 1111 Brickell Avenue in Miami from New York-based KKR and Orlando-based Parkway, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. Ponte Gadea did not record a mortgage, signifying this was likely a cash deal.\nChris Lee and Sean Kelly of CBRE represented the sellers.\nThe 524,000-square-foot Sabadell Financial Center was completed in 2000 on a 1.8-acre lot, as part of a larger mixed-use project that included the adjacent 296-key JW Marriott Miami. Kendall-based MDM Group and Brickell-based Rilea Group were the developers.\nTenants include co-working firm Industrious, marketing firm Tibint, Kennedys Law, Law Offices of Wolf &amp; Pravato and commercial real estate services firm\nNorthmarq\n.\nKKR and Parkway had paid\n$248.5 million\nfor the building in 2018, according to records.\nKKR is led by co-CEOs Joseph Bae and Scott Nuttall, and Parkway is led by James Heistand, their respective websites show.\n\nThe deal comes amid slower South Florida office investment sales compared with the deal flurry during the pandemic. At that time, lower interest rates and an influx of out-of-state companies leasing big blocks of space prompted record rent growth and a sales spree. Over the past two years, elevated interest rates and some skittishness among lenders curbed the investment bonanza.\nIn Miami-Dade County, office deal volume reached $2.1 billion in 2021 and $1.1 billion in 2022, according to data provided by CBRE. Although volume dropped to $700 million in 2023, sales picked up last year to $1.4 billion. During the first half of the year and a portion of the third quarter, Miami-Dade sales totaled $293 million, the data shows.\nOrtega\u2019s Sabadell purchase surpasses the previous top South Florida office sales this year. In February, Bradford Allen Investment Advisors paid\n$208 million\nfor Las Olas Centre I &amp; II at 350 and 450 East Las Olas Boulevard in downtown Fort Lauderdale. Also in February, Lone Star Funds\u2019 fund VII, Highline Real Estate Capital and Square2 Capital bought the Bank of America Plaza at Las Olas City Centre at 401 East Las Olas Boulevard in downtown Fort Lauderdale for\n$221 million\n.\nMany of the players still purchasing offices are all-cash buyers that can avoid expensive financing. Ortega, best known as the founder of Zara and the Inditex clothing stores holding firm, is a cash buyer, reinvesting earnings from his retail empire into real estate globally through Ponte Gadea.\nOrtega\n, who Forbes ranks as the 12th richest person globally with a net worth of $127.1 billion, has been especially active this year. This coincides with an expected record $3.6 billion in dividends this year from his retail holdings, with the billionaire possibly deploying cash into properties to shield his earnings from Spain\u2019s hefty wealth tax,\nBloomberg reported\n.\nPurchasing all cash also allows for a reprieve on prices because sellers are more interested in the certainty of closing over getting the highest price in the current financing climate, an expert told\nThe Real Deal\nin July.\nLast month, Ponte Gadea paid\n$110 million\nfor the fully leased Atlas Plaza retail building at 130 Northeast 40th Street in the Miami Design District. In June, it bought the 259-unit Veneto Las Olas apartment tower at 201 South Federal Highway in downtown Fort Lauderdale for\n$165 million\n.\nIn Paris, Ponte Gadea bought the five-star 90-key Hotel Banke for\n$113 million\nin July, and the eight-story office and retail property at 223 Rue Saint-Honor\u00e9 from Hines for about 170 million euros (about $197.3 million) last month. In May, it paid\n$284 million\nfor a 290,000-square-foot office building in Barcelona that\u2019s home to Spanish book publisher Planeta\u2019s headquarters. Ponte Gadea also reportedly is buying a 49 percent stake in Brookfield Asset Management\u2019s PD Ports in the United Kingdom for an undisclosed amount.",

That price is 58 percent less than the $31 million that former owners Barker Pacific Group paid for the building in 2020. Barker Pacific defaulted on a $25.5 million loan last year, prompting the court to place the building in receivership.\nElsewhere in the East Bay, in May, Hall Equities\nbought Ygnacio Center\nin Walnut Creek from Hines Interests and Oaktree Capital Group for $111 million, or $210 per square foot.

        "content": "Downtown Dallas could soon lose both of its big league sports draws.\nAfter more than two decades at the American Airlines Center, the Dallas Stars are exploring a move to Plano, joining the Mavericks in considering new homes once their leases expire in 2031. The Stars\u2019 ownership advisory group met last week and identified Plano as a leading contender for a future arena site, the Dallas Business Journal and Front Office Sports\nreported\n.\nArlington is also in the mix. The concept under review would mirror sports-anchored entertainment districts like The Battery in Atlanta or\nTexas Live!\nin Arlington \u2014 sprawling mixed-use campuses designed to keep fans eating, shopping and spending long after the final buzzer.\nThe NHL franchise, owned by Canadian hotel and restaurant developer Tom Gagliardi, has deep roots in Collin County. The team already runs youth programs in Plano and operates its practice and front-office hub out of the Comerica Center in Frisco. Team president and CEO Brad Alberts confirmed talks with Plano officials but said no decision has been made.\nThe site search marks a notable shift for Alberts, who just two years ago publicly backed staying at the AAC, calling it \u201ca great place to play for a long time.\u201d Built in 2001, the 20,000-seat arena is a centerpiece of the\nVictory Park\ndistrict and a key contributor to downtown\u2019s economy.\n\nThe Stars and\nMavericks\nhave brought billions in economic impact to the area since moving in, according to the city.\nBut 2031 looms as a turning point. The\nMavericks\n, owned by Las Vegas Sands owners Miriam Adelson and Patrick Dumont, have already said they plan to build a new arena before their lease expires, with one option reportedly being the site of Dallas City Hall \u2014 a downtown parcel the city may sell or redevelop, the Dallas Morning News first reported.\nIf both franchises leave, it would represent a seismic shift for downtown\u2019s entertainment ecosystem. The departures would follow other corporate moves under consideration, including AT&amp;T\u2019s potential exit, threatening to sap economic energy from the city\u2019s core while further supercharging growth in the suburbs.\nThe Stars say they\u2019re \u201cevaluating all options,\u201d but if the Collin County trend holds, the next great Dallas sports district could be miles from downtown.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The developer of a 50-unit apartment complex in Miami Gardens sold the property for $18.5 million, amid an uptick in South Florida multifamily investment sales.\nAn entity tied to Ronny Ackermann and Jose Rimsky of Hollywood sold The Villages at Miami Gardens at 3400 Northwest 191st Street, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The purchasing entity ties to Glen Allen, Virginia-based Capital Square, an intermediary likely doing a 1031 exchange on behalf of the true buyer, Vizzda records show. The true buyer remains unknown.\nThe buyer borrowed a $12 million Fannie Mae loan for the purchase. The deal breaks down to $370,000 per unit.\nCompleted in 2021, Villages at Miami Gardens consists of seven two-story apartment buildings on a 3-acre lot. It offers three- and four-bedroom units, with monthly rents ranging from $3,150 to $3,550.\nThe selling entity had paid $900,000 for the development site in 2017, according to property records.\nSouth Florida multifamily investment sales have picked up in recent months.\n\nThe tri-county region became a magnet for out-of-state residents during the pandemic, which prompted unprecedented apartment demand, record rent growth and a deal flurry.\nOver the past two years, the market slowed amid higher interest rates and some skittish lenders. Also, demand eased,\nlease-ups slowed\nand rents declined because developers completed a record number of units last year as the influx of newcomers slowed.\nThe recent pickup coincides with the impending year-end, when investors rush to close purchases or sell properties to get them off their balance sheets.\nThis month, Morgan Properties paid nearly\n$70 million\nfor the 300-unit Visions at Willow Pond at\u00a0 4860 Sand Stone Lane in unincorporated Palm Beach County. Also, Tishman Speyer bought the 270-unit Bell at Broken Sound Apartments at 5500 Broken Sound Boulevard Northwest and 950 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway in Boca Raton for\n$124.5 million\n.\nLast month, AEW Capital Management and Mast Capital sold the 342-unit Remi on the River apartment complex at 999 Northwest Seventh Street in Miami to Valeris Capital for\n$108.4 million\n.\nLegacy Residential Group paid\n$77 million\n, also last month, for the 416-unit Legacy at Coconut Creek complex at 4303 West Atlantic Boulevard in Coconut Creek.\n",

        "content": "Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Go Group has landed the residential sales contract at Century City\u2019s most-watched project in the Reuben Brothers\u2019 Century Plaza.\nThe Go Group, which is led by Neyshia Go and based in Beverly Hills, is now exclusively marketing Park Elm, in addition to the Fairmont Residences at the\nmixed-use project\n.\nThe twin, 44-story towers comprising Park Elm total 268 units. The north tower, currently open for sales, has between 60-70 units available. Once that nears sell-out status, the south side will open for sales, according to Go.\nUnits are priced from roughly $2.5 million to over $20 million. On a per-square-foot basis, that\u2019s around $1,700 to $3,000.\nThe $2.5 billion, six-acre Century Plaza consists of the residential towers in addition to the recently renovated 400-room Fairmont Century Plaza hotel. The hotel property includes 63 branded residences and 100,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space.\nThe\nReuben Brothers\n\u2019 snapped up the property through a $1 billion foreclosure in 2023 from the project\u2019s original developer, Michael Rosenfeld. The purchase price was roughly half what it cost to build the property out.\n\u201cThe Reuben Brothers have really spearheaded a very significant investment in both time, money and enthusiasm into this project,\u201d Go said. \u201cThis is something they\u2019re all personally involved in.\u201d\n\nSo far, the four-person Go Group has clocked roughly 40 showings and the buyers trickling through are diverse. Some have come from Northern California, out of state or outside the country to seek secondary homes. One of the first deals the group struck was with an international buyer who will use their residence a few months of the year, according to Go. Other buyers are interested in the safety of a guard-gated property, concierge and direct-to-unit access, she said.\nThe various amenities have helped draw interest in Century City, which has seen its traditional base of high-rise, Class A office thrive while other parts of the market, including downtown L.A., struggle.\nLaw firms Skadden, Arps, Meagher &amp; Flom and commercial real estate brokerage\nSavills are among the firms that have left downtown Los Angeles in favor of Century City.\nMichelin-star restaurant Sushi Noz from New York has already begun a buildout on a Century Plaza location. Among other businesses set to open next summer are Asian-inspired restaurant KYU and a new concept from\nWally\u2019s Wine &amp; Spirits\n, which is backed by Guess Inc. co-founders Paul and Maurice Marciano. Also incoming are Milos and Le Specialit\u00e0.\nThe Estate\n, a health and wellness concept created by Tony Robbins\u2019 Fountain Life and Sam Nazarian\u2019s SBE, will occupy about\n13,000 square feet\nat the project.\nOne crosswalk over, residents also have access to Westfield Century City, the open-air mall with additional dining and shopping options.\n",

        "content": "A loan tied to the\nOne Market Plaza\noffices in San Francisco could spell trouble for its owners as its maturity date approaches.\nThe $850 million loan backed by the 1.6 million-square-foot office complex is set to mature in February of next year, and has meanwhile been placed on a lender watch list, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nThe buildings\u2019 owners, Paramount Group and Blackstone, haven\u2019t declared what they plan to do regarding the maturity. There\u2019s still a few more months for the entities to discuss their plans with lenders, and it isn\u2019t the first time they\u2019ve faced a looming maturity date. They previously\npaid down a loan\nbacked by the complex from $975 million to $850 million in order to\nsecure an extension of the loan\u2019s maturity\nfrom February 2024 to February 2026; that deal also includes a one-year extension option that would push the loan\u2019s maturity to February 2027.\nAs of June, One Market Plaza was 67 percent occupied, down from 90 percent at the end of last year. Traditionally, borrowers have trouble refinancing office buildings with an occupancy rate of less than 70 percent, according to Morningstar data cited by the Business Times.\nOccupancy at One Market Plaza is expected to plummet even further as more companies move out.\n\nGoogle contributed to the fall earlier this year by\nnot renewing its lease for 342,000 square feet\nthis spring. Law firm Morgan Lewis &amp; Bockius is moving to the Transamerica Pyramid and will let its 150,000-square-foot-lease expire early next year. Visa moved into its new offices at Mission Rock last year, though it still has a 160,000-square-foot lease at One Market Plaza expiring next September. It remains unclear if Autodesk, which has a 109,000-square-foot lease in the building expiring next June, will remain at the complex.\nWith the departures of Morgan Lewis &amp; Bockius and Visa, Paramount and Blackstone could face an occupancy rate of less than 50 percent. In order to\nattract tenants\n\u2014 and in turn, likely improve its chances of securing a possible refinancing deal \u2014 Paramount announced earlier this year that it plans to ramp up its amenities programming at One Market.\nThe buildings aren\u2019t emptying out completely, however. New tenants such as\nlaw firm Simpson Thacher\nand Postman have planted flags at the complex, with Simpson Thatcher taking 32,000 square feet of Google\u2019s former space and Postman grabbing 32,000 square feet of Visa\u2019s former offices.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Four properties in Moshe Silber\u2019s troubled New Orleans multifamily portfolio and a Pittsburgh apartment complex are nearing a sale to Lynd Group.\nSan Antonio-based Lynd Group is buying the New Orleans properties totaling 1,512 units for $26.12 million. Lynd is also buying a 115-unit apartment complex in Pittsburgh through the bankruptcy process of Silber\u2019s former company, according to court filings. Lynd is purchasing properties owned by CBRM Realty, one of Silber\u2019s many companies.\nSilber\u2019s 11,000-unit multifamily property empire collapsed after he pleaded guilty for his role in a commercial mortgage fraud scheme last year.\nSilber\nand his co-conspirators allegedly used a stolen identity to obtain an inflated $74 million loan from Fannie Mae and JLL for a rental property in Cincinnati, Ohio. Silber was sentenced to 30 months in prison last March.\nAfter Silber pleaded guilty to fraud, an independent fiduciary, Elizabeth LaPuma, was appointed to oversee two of Silber\u2019s companies, CBRM and Crown Capital, in September 2024. Meanwhile, Lynd, an established multifamily operator, took over management responsibilities of Silber\u2019s vast apartment portfolio.\nIn April 2025, a creditor of Silber\u2019s sought to auction off CBRM, leading LaPuma to put the company, which held thousands of 6,300 units in New Orleans, Pittsburgh, Flint, Michigan, Jackson, Mississippi and elsewhere, into Chapter 11 bankruptcy the following month. Silber remained the main equity holder of CBRM.\nIn bankruptcy filings, CBRM\u2019s attorneys claimed that Silber mismanaged the properties, which mostly consisted of low-income housing. They also claimed Silber \u201cextracted tens of millions (if not hundreds of millions of dollars) of value from those properties for his own benefit.\u201d\n\nSilber had obtained huge sums of money from bondholders and from lenders. He had nabbed about $200 million in financing from bondholders for his real estate portfolio and at least $450 million in mortgages. Silber\u2019s properties fell into neglect, yet he maintained a lavish lifestyle, including homes in London and upstate New York, and a private jet. (In a recent\nbankruptcy\nfiling, Silber claimed, however, he had no income, no assets, and was borrowing money from his father Zalman to cover his legal fees in bankruptcy).\nLynd will be acquiring four apartments in East New Orleans all built in the 1980s with high vacancies. The properties include: Carmel Brook Apartments, Carmel Spring Apartments, Laguna Reserve Apartments and Laguna Creek Apartments. The properties were put up for auction, but the auction was canceled.\nLynd\u2019s acquisition will pay off over $17 million of debtor-in-possession financing provided by a firm tied to entrepreneur and vice chairman of El Al airlines Daryl Hagler. It will also pay off Cleveland International Fund, which has a $4.5 million debt. As part of the deal, Lynd will provide bondholders up to 30 percent upside to any future sale or distribution of the properties.\nLynd will also acquire the Kelly Hamilton apartments in Pittsburgh through a credit bid of up to $9.3 million.\nOn October 6, LuPuma put an additional 42 companies, tied to Silber\u2019s properties throughout the country, including Pennsylvania, Alabama and Ohio, into bankruptcy protection.\n",

        "content": "JPMorgan Chase is not just building a headquarters in Midtown Manhattan \u2014 it\u2019s building a city.\nThe nation\u2019s largest bank is putting the finishing touches on its 60-story tower at 270 Park Avenue, but Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon\u2019s ambitions stretch across several Midtown blocks, Bloomberg\nreported\n.\nThe\nNorman Foster\u2013designed skyscraper\n, which will house about 10,000 employees, is the centerpiece of a JPMorgan campus that includes the neighboring Bear Stearns tower at 383 Madison Avenue and the recently acquired 250 Park Avenue.\nThe bank\u2019s footprint totals nearly 6 million square feet in the heart of Midtown, rivaling the entire global holdings of some of its Wall Street competitors. More than a show of strength, the $5 billion project reflects Dimon\u2019s push to anchor the firm\u2019s identity \u2014 and physical presence \u2014 in New York at a time when the city\u2019s economic dominance faces fresh political scrutiny.\nDimon\u2019s influence is all over the area, treating the HQ tower\u2019s design as a personal project, down to the Guinness tap imported for the 13th-floor pub. He divided top lieutenants into teams to oversee specific elements: trading floors under Daniel Pinto and Troy Rohrbaugh; client centers on the top floor under Mary Erdoes and Marianne Lake; and a wellness level \u2014 with a gym Dimon reluctantly agreed to \u2014 under other executives. The result is a corporate citadel organized like a microcosm of the firm itself.\n\nAs construction wrapped, JPMorgan shut down 47th Street for a barbecue celebrating the workers who built the tower. Dimon shmoozed alongside union leaders and told the crowd, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be here for a long time \u2014 obviously.\u201d\nThe party doubled as a soft launch for the bank\u2019s broader urban experiment: part office complex, part ecosystem.\nNext up, JPMorgan plans a $1 billion overhaul of 383 Madison and is weighing what to do with 250 Park, recently acquired for\nmore than $300 million\n, where options range from a new office tower to a company-run hotel for visiting employees.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The Brea City Council approved the housing project for that location in April.\nThree types of housing have been proposed by Lennar for the site.

Last July, the city\u2019s Planning Commission approved South Brea Townhomes, which would bring 32 for-sale single-family units to 685 South Brea Boulevard.\nUnder Brea\u2019s approved\nhousing element\n, the city must plan for 2,365 new housing units by 2029.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The summer rush on North Shore lakefront mansions didn\u2019t just make brokers happy \u2014 it made Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi look clairvoyant.\nThe nine priciest home sales in suburban Cook County this year have all been lakefront properties in New Trier Township \u2014 and nearly all traded for more than Kaegi\u2019s office said they were worth just a few months ago, according to\nCrain\u2019s\n. That\u2019s despite widespread complaints this spring, when the assessor\u2019s triennial revaluation of New Trier homes jacked up\nlakefront assessments\nby an average of 42 percent.\nIn\nWinnetka\nalone, four waterfront estates fetched between $9.5 million and $12 million. One mansion assessed at $10.8 million sold for $11.4 million in July. Another, pegged at $9.45 million, sold for $9.57 million. Of the nine top-tier New Trier transactions \u2014 stretching from Kenilworth to Glencoe \u2014 six sold for more than the assessor\u2019s figure, meaning Kaegi\u2019s valuations actually came in low.\n\u201cThe market is a test of our work,\u201d Kaegi told the outlet. \u201cThis shows we passed the test.\u201d\nThree properties fell outside that pattern. One was the record-breaking $31.25 million\nWinnetka estate\n, appraised at $34.86 million \u2014 too high. Another\nKenilworth\nsale went to a developer planning to split the parcel; its $6.8 million sale price was below the $8.49 million assessment. And one Glencoe deal, a neighbor buy-up, doesn\u2019t really count as an open-market comp.\n\nFor local property tax consultant Andrea Raila, who ran against Kaegi in 2018, the assessor\u2019s self-congratulation is misplaced. She argued that ultra-luxury valuations are guesswork, with too few comparable sales north of $12 million to justify Kaegi\u2019s models, saying it\u2019s \u201cridiculous\u201d to assume the market is validating the assessments.\nBut Jena Radnay of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, who brokered five of this year\u2019s top Winnetka deals, disagreed.\n\u201cHis figures are accurate,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the end of the day, the market says so.\u201d\nStill, Radnay warned that the surge may not last. New bluff-protection rules in Winnetka are restricting how much of a lakefront site can be developed, limiting terraces and boathouses that helped drive big-dollar deals.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The darkened Sears at Mesquite\u2019s Town East Mall is set for a second act \u2014 this time as the anchor of a mixed-use revival backed by city incentives.\nDallas-based Elm Creek Investments won approval this week for rezoning and an agreement to redevelop the 18-acre site at 1738 North Town East Boulevard, on the north edge of the 1 million-square-foot mall, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe plan calls for restaurants, a conference center and a possible 150-room hotel, with work expected to unfold over several years. The Mesquite City Council approved a 10-year, 1-cent sales tax rebate to support the project this week.\nElm Creek, operating as Elm Creek Real Estate, will be required to meet a series of performance milestones. By the end of next year, the developer must complete exterior renovations to the former Sears, begin parking lot construction and secure a 10-year lease with\nMain Event\n, which will occupy about two-thirds of the old department store with a 58,000-square-foot entertainment center. By July 2027, Elm Creek must have invested at least $25 million and prepped three pad sites for development.\nEconomic Development Director Kim Buttram said seven prospective tenants are already in talks to lease outparcels, including five first-time entrants to\nMesquite\n. One of the biggest targets: a Vidorra restaurant, for which Elm Creek could receive an additional $500,000 grant if it lands a five-year, 6,000-square-foot lease by next summer.\n\nThe redevelopment could reenergize\nTown East\n, which is Mesquite\u2019s top generator of property and sales tax revenue. Council Member Kenny Green called the mall a \u201ccash cow\u201d for the city. Elm Creek\u2019s deal is expected to generate at least $100,000 in new sales tax revenue in the first year, growing to $200,000 annually by the end of the agreement.\nA separate incentives package for the hotel is still being negotiated and could include state support. A 2019 hotel study identified the Town East site as the best location for a midsize conference center \u2014 and a global hotel brand has reportedly expressed interest.\nBuilt in 1971, Town East Mall still draws about 5 million visitors annually despite retail headwinds. The Sears site, shuttered in 2021, was the last of the once-dominant chain\u2019s North Texas stores. Town East Mall was recently pulled off the foreclosure auction block by\nBrookfield Properties\nafter resolving distress tied to a $160.3 million loan.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Andrew Cuomo said during a mayoral forum hosted by Crain\u2019s on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s why no one wanted to go near it.\u201d\nWithout specifying exactly how, some of the candidates want to harness the energy around the issue.\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s event, a rare opportunity to see all three candidates under the same roof, Assembly member Zohran Mamdani said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d supports comprehensive reform to the city\u2019s lopsided property tax system.\nMamdani noted that he is on the Assembly\u2019s standing committee on real property taxation and that he wanted to introduce legislation to amend the tax system, but was told \u201cin no uncertain terms\u201d that the state was waiting on the mayor to deliver a citywide plan.\nPrevious administrations have promised and failed to change New York\u2019s property tax system. Mayor Eric Adams pledged to fix the city\u2019s property tax regime within his first year in office, and when that didn\u2019t happen, repeatedly\ncommitted\nto do so but did not deliver reform.\nMamdani also cited Tax Equity Now New York\u2019s nearly decade-old lawsuit challenging the system and recommendations made at the end of the de Blasio administration as potential paths forward.\n\u201cI think that there are a number of proposals that can make it easier with circuit breakers, also to ensure that any fix is not one that then creates a new level of burden on a different class of homeowners or owners of different sets of rental properties,\u201d he said.\nCuomo, acknowledging that likely nothing will change otherwise, said the courts may need to force the city\u2019s hand.\nHe cited TENNY\u2019s lawsuit, which argues that the city\u2019s property tax system is inequitable. Most recently, the group has\nasked\na state court to require the city to make changes to how one-, two- and three-family homes, as well as condo and co-ops, are assessed.\n\u201cThe legal case can actually be used, frankly, as a facilitating device to say, \u2018we have to do this,\u2019\u201d Cuomo said, adding that a court order would give City Council members political cover from the angry condo and co-op owners who would see their tax bills rise as a result of reform.\nEmbracing court-powered reform is a departure from previous administrations, which have argued that lawmakers should enact change.\nRepublican nominee Curtis Sliwa repeatedly noted the need to slash property taxes, alongside other taxes.\nThe pitch\nAt Wednesday\u2019s forum, the three mayoral contenders appeared separately, each making their case to the business community. For some that was a bigger challenge than others.\nMamdani acknowledged that he likely wasn\u2019t their \u201cdream\u201d candidate, but said he believes there is \u201cfar more commonality\u201d between their visions for the city.\nWhen asked who he is planning to hire if he becomes mayor, Mamdani demurred, but noted that he is talking to current and former members of the Adams administration, including former First Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer and City Planning head Dan Garodnick, in preparation.\nHe also\nechoed a comment\nmade by Real Estate Board of New York President Jim Whelan at a Crain\u2019s event last month. Whelan said his advice for Mamdani would be to hire the \u201cbest people,\u201d citing how former Mayor Michael Bloomberg built up his team. Mamdani also name-dropped Bloomberg and the need for mayors to surround themselves with top talent.\n\nMamdani\u2019s plan to freeze rents for stabilized apartments for four years, meanwhile, doesn\u2019t sit well with many in the real estate industry. When asked about the rent freeze, and the fact that this promise comes before the city\u2019s Rent Guidelines Board has had a chance to deliberate on the issue, Mamdani said the move would help align the board\u2019s actions with its own analysis of the city\u2019s rent stabilized housing stock. He pointed to increased landlord profits and stagnant tenant wages.\nLandlord groups have long\ncriticized\nthe board\u2019s reports detailing rises in buildings\u2019 net operating income because those calculations include market rate units.\nHe also said a freeze isn\u2019t meant to punish landlords and doesn\u2019t preclude other actions aimed at helping struggling property owners, including\nalternative insurance options\n, reforming property taxes and combatting rising utility rates.\nHousing timelines\nMamdani indicated that he wants to encourage the private sector to build more housing and said that in conversations with real estate leaders, he\u2019s been \u201ctaken aback\u201d by the fact that some of the largest costs they face in building housing is the \u201ccost of waiting.\u201d He mentioned the prospect of reforming the city\u2019s environmental review process.\nStill, he did not commit to supporting\nfour housing-related ballot questions\n, most of which are aimed at speeding up approval of housing projects in the city. He said he is glad that New Yorkers will get to decide these issues in November, but has not himself taken a position on the measures.\nThrowing his support behind the measures is politically tricky: Two powerful unions that have\nendorsed\nhis run for mayor, 32BJ SEIU and the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council, oppose the three most controversial questions that, if approved, weaken or skip the City Council\u2019s role in certain land use approvals.\nSliwa called the ballot measures \u201cCity of Yes on steroids,\u201d referring to the\nzoning changes approved last year\n.\n\u201cI am opposed to the City of Yes, that would destroy the residential makeup, especially of the outer boroughs,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a preservationist in many ways, which clearly these two candidates are not. Andrew Cuomo is in the back pockets of the developers and realtors as is his predecessor, Eric Adams.\u201d\nWhen asked what he would do to make it easier to build affordable housing, he pointed to inefficiencies at the Department of Buildings.\n\u201cThe Department of Buildings is often your enemy, whether you\u2019re making changes in your existing occupancy or you\u2019re trying to build a new facility,\u201d he said.\nHe has\npreviously said\nthat he would make cuts to the DOB to help pay for his proposed tax cuts.\nCuomo said a top priority if he is elected mayor will be building 500,000 new homes across 300 sites \u201csimultaneously,\u201d though it\u2019s unclear how that would be accomplished in terms of labor and financing if he was speaking literally.\nCrain\u2019s reporter Nick Garber asked Cuomo how he would work with a progressive City Council, and why the business community should have confidence that he could block leftist legislation, given the passage of significant reforms to the state\u2019s rent law in 2019 when he was governor.\nCuomo said vetoing the 2019 law would have been the politically easy route: The legislature had the votes to override a veto. He said he opted to negotiate for a better bill instead.\nHe said the City Council will be easier to wrangle because it is a lot smaller than the state legislature.\nThat idea could be put to the test with one of his latest proposals. During the forum, Cuomo revealed a new proposal to abandon the city\u2019s plan to close Rikers in favor of rebuilding the jail. The borough jail sites slated to replace Rikers would instead be used for housing and commercial use. Doing so would require buy-in from the City Council, which passed a law in 2019 to shutter and replace the complex with four new jails.\nCouncil member Sandy Nurse, who co-chairs the City Council Progressive Caucus, called the proposal \u201cinept\u201d on social media and said the City Council would not backtrack on the 2019 law.\n",

        "content": "Fuse Group is aiming to derail developer Brian Tuttle\u2019s strategy for keeping control of his Mainstreet at Tuttle development site in Royal Palm Beach.\nFort Lauderdale-based Fuse, led by Eyal Peretz, on Sept. 29 filed a motion to dismiss a Chapter 11 petition in Miami federal court filed this month by the\nTuttle entity\nthat owns 38 acres on the southwest corner of U.S. 441 and Southern Boulevard.\nThe developer is planning Mainstreet at Tuttle, a mixed-use project with 400,000 square feet of retail, 401 apartments, a 125-key hotel, nearly 83,000 square feet of medical offices and three parking garages with 3,435 total spaces. The development has not broken ground.\nFuse alleges the Chapter 11 petition is a \u201cbad faith\u201d attempt by\nTuttle\nto delay a court-ordered sale of the development site.\nThe Tuttle entity filed for bankruptcy on the same day the property was scheduled to be sold at a foreclosure auction. Proceeds would have satisfied a $47.4 million judgment Fuse won in July tied to\nthree loans\nthat the developer allegedly defaulted on.\nAs part of its motion,\nFuse\nattached an email Tuttle sent in July 2024 to contractors working on Mainstreet at Tuttle and other project stakeholders in which he outlined his plan to avoid losing the development site, as well as explaining his difficulties landing a new equity partner.\nIn the July 21, 2024 email, Tuttle wrote, \u201cI will then file a bankruptcy\u2026this will buy us another year at a minimum\u201d if he was unsuccessful in landing a new partner by the time Fuse\u2019s foreclosure complaint was concluded. Fuse filed the lawsuit in Palm Beach County Court last year.\n\nFuse and its attorney, Josh Rubens with Miami law firm Kluger Kaplan, declined to comment.\nIn a phone interview with\nThe Real Deal\n, Tuttle accused Fuse of taking his email out of context and misrepresenting his intentions. \u201cI was trying to delay [in order] to find an equity investor to pay them and the other creditors,\u201d Tuttle said. \u201cWe will provide adequate proof that we have worked very hard and with numerous groups with the sole purpose to pay them back.\u201d\nFuse\u2019s goal is to \u201cwipe out all the other creditors and not give them anything,\u201d Tuttle added.\nThe email also noted Tuttle\u2019s difficulty last year drumming up new investors due to market conditions and the uncertainty of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cI have presented the deal to over 200 groups in the last 14 months,\u201d Tuttle wrote. \u201cI have been unable to get a group to invest as a co-developer or LP equity partner.\u201d\nIn all capital letters, Tuttle claimed that the groups he reached out to all cited high interest rates and insurance costs for turning him down: \u201cTHESE GROUPS DO NOT WANT TO TAKE DEVELOPMENT RISK AT THIS TIME.\u201d\nWhile he claimed to have JP Morgan ready to provide a construction loan, the Mainstreet at Tuttle project still needed an additional $30 million to be built, Tuttle wrote.\nTuttle told\nTRD\nthat market conditions have become more favorable for investors, and that he has now found an equity partner that can provide capital to pay back Fuse and restart the project. The Mainstreet at Tuttle ownership entity will be disclosing more information about its new partner in its reorganization plan that will be submitted to the court soon, Tuttle added.\n\u201cBefore, you had uncertainty of Trump and the election, the uncertainty of interest rates and the uncertainty surrounding the absorption of existing apartments,\u201d Tuttle said. \u201cSince then, things have taken a huge shift. There is general agreement that interest rates are going down\u2026and the absorption of apartments is exceeding everyone\u2019s expectations.\u201d",

        "content": "Residents in one Alameda neighborhood could lose their only grocery store and shopping center to hundreds of new residences.\nDenver-based developer\nThe True Life Companies\nfiled a preliminary application to build more than 300 homes on the site of the Harbor Bay Landing shopping center, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The property owner is Harbor Bay Landing LLC, purportedly a Burlingame-based private real estate investor.\nThe retail complex is anchored by a Safeway, the only grocery store on Bay Farm Island. Though the grocery store provides a critical food store for locals, Harbor Bay Landing has become increasingly vacant as tenants have closed up shop in recent years. In the City of\nAlameda\n\u2019s\nhousing element\n, officials identified Harbor Bay as an ideal site to build new housing in order to meet its state-mandated housing goals.\nThe location was indicated by the city as one of its community mixed-use combining districts, which encourages developers to include ground-floor retail and space for a grocery store in their plans. True Life is looking to get around that by requesting a concession to waive the mixed-uses requirement in their plans.\nTrue Life plans to demolish the existing 130,000 square feet of commercial space to clear the way for 305 new homes. Of those, 88 would be rental apartments and 217 would be for-sale townhomes.\n\nThe residences would include 50 units set aside for affordable housing, 22 of which would be designated for moderate-income residents, 12 at the low-income level and 16 at the very-low-income level. In Alameda County, moderate income is generally\ndefined\nas a maximum of $134,250 for one person, while low-income is a maximum of $87,550 and very-low-income is less than $55,950.\nBy including affordable units in its plan, True Life will be able to bypass certain requirements for the project. The plan applies SB 330, which streamlines the entitlement process, locks in current planning code laws and limits the number of public hearings on a project in an effort to get shovels in dirt faster.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be True Life\u2019s first\nproposal in the Bay Area\n.\nIn 2023, True Life filed a pre-application to demolish the Las Positas Office Plaza in the Hacienda Business Park in\nPleasanton\nand build housing in its place. In that proposal, the developer would replace the 110,000-square-foot office complex with 146 units. That plan is presumably dead in the water, though another developer, N17, filed an application in August to build 112 for-sale townhomes there.\nTrue Life also at one point aimed to build a 189-unit condo development in Hayward. That proposed project included 123 townhomes consisting of three- and four-bedroom units, 10,800 square feet of ground-floor commercial space, an urban park and a dog park.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

(The honor ultimately went to\nanother RiseBoro project\nthat he started later but finished sooner.)\n\u201cWe were trying to do something new, to break the mold,\u201d said Short. \u201cOne of the things that attracted me to the passive house standard was, unlike LEED or these \u2018green building\u2019 [designations] where you get certified based on plans, with passive house it\u2019s really all about the performance of the building.\u201d\nAt the end of construction, a\nblower door test\ndetermines how leaky the building is.\n\u201cIf the building doesn\u2019t perform as you project it to, you\u2019re not going to get the certification,\u201d said Short, who was RiseBoro\u2019s housing director and later became CEO. \u201cYou need a building that actually works, not a building that just checks a lot of boxes during the design phase.\u201d\nIn the early 2010s, no passive house apartment buildings existed in New York, and city officials who controlled affordable housing subsidies were skeptical.\n\u201cWe had to go in for funding four times,\u201d Scott recalled, \u201cand chip away at the bureaucratic hurdles.\u201d\n\nContractors were also skittish about passive house construction and inflated their bids by 20 percent, Short estimated. \u201cIt was the novelty premium,\u201d he said.\nThat premium has largely disappeared as more contractors have become comfortable with the methods, equipment and materials needed to make a building virtually airtight, with carefully controlled ventilation.\nIn New York City, most affordable projects are now built this way, although they don\u2019t often seek passive house status because the certification process is expensive. Perhaps the biggest is the 277-unit\n425 Grand Concourse\nin the Bronx, finished in 2022 by Monadnock Construction and Dattner Architects. (Outside of affordable housing, a 352-unit\nCornellTech NYC residential building\ncompleted in 2017 is among the city\u2019s passive house pioneers.)\nI checked with Short\u2019s successor as CEO,\nKieran Harrington\n, to see how 803 Knickerbocker is doing a dozen years after opening. \u201cThere have been meaningful savings,\u201d he said.\nThe six-story, 35,000-square-foot building uses about\n20 percent as much energy\nas an average building of that size in the city. Its annual cost for gas, electricity and water is 62 cents per square foot, about half of the Housing Development Corporation\u2019s $1.12 benchmark.\nBut the benefits of the super-insulated building go well beyond cost savings, according to its architect, Chris Benedict.\n\u201cNot only do we have a very good air barrier on the exterior of the building to meet passive house [standards], we also create an air barrier between each apartment so that air, bugs, smoke, sound, none of these things can pass from one apartment to the other,\u201d she said in a\nYouTube video\n.\nBuildings guru Henry Gifford was a consultant on 803 Knickerbocker. His role, in part, was to ease the anxiety of its contractors. As the construction team met near the end of the project, a plumber worried about being blamed if the 400,000 BTU boiler proved too small to heat a 24-unit building.\nGifford didn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cThe boiler is not going to provide the heat,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to provide the heat\nand the hot water\n.\u201d\n\u201cNobody doubted I was taking full responsibility,\u201d Gifford recalled, \u201cand everyone calmed down.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Rule number one: Know your audience. Rule number two: Answer the question you want to answer, not necessarily the question asked.\nAt least that is the playbook I assume mayoral hopefuls were following as they made their case to an industry-heavy crowd on Wednesday morning at a\nforum\nheld by Crain\u2019s. Candidates abided by the second rule to varying degrees, though the moderators did their best to keep them on track.\nEach of the candidates took turns on the stage to talk about a range of topics, including property tax reform and housing policy. Because this wasn\u2019t a debate and the candidates weren\u2019t presented with the same questions, I\u2019m not going to compare the candidates\u2019 performances.\nInstead, here are superlatives for the real estate-related topics covered during the forum:\nMost likely to make landlords\u2019 heads explode:\nThe \u201crent-stabilized landlords make too much money\u201d claim\nAssembly member Zohran Mamdani said the Rent Guidelines Board\u2019s own data on landlord profits should result in a rent freeze for stabilized tenants. Every year when this data comes out, landlord groups\npoint out\nthat the RGB\u2019s Income and Expense report includes market-rate units and leaves out a slew of other costs. In other words, the number is not an accurate picture of how rent-stabilized owners are faring.\nNot to mention, the RGB already recommends ranges based on its own data, and these ranges tend to make both tenants and landlords unhappy.\nMost likely to make Yimbys throw their copies of \u201cOn the Housing Crisis\u201d against the wall:\nThe ballot questions dodge and low-density exceptions\nNone of the mayoral candidates gave a glowing endorsement of\nthese measures\non Wednesday. In fact, Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa vehemently opposes them, referring to the proposals as \u201cCity of Yes on steroids.\u201d\nCuomo wasn\u2019t asked (but his reps have called the proposals a\n\u201cno brainer\u201d\n), and Mamdani said he hasn\u2019t taken a position. This was after he said he was \u201ctaken aback\u201d by the idea that one of the biggest costs developers face is caused by time passing, projects dragging. One of the biggest themes of those ballot measures is cutting approval timelines.\u00a0 \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\nAt one point, Crain\u2019s reporter Nick Garber asked Cuomo about a line in his housing plan that states that low-density neighborhoods should be spared from rezonings, \u201cwith limited exceptions such as transit-oriented development,\u201d until \u201cthe impact of recent rezoning efforts are absorbed in these areas.\u201d\nInitially, Cuomo rejected the idea, saying that what he has said is \u201cyou have to take the characteristics of a neighborhood into consideration.\u201d Then, he was helpfully reminded of the above quotes in his housing plan and said, \u201cI get this political sensitivity, and I get the City of Yes and what everybody went through, but it\u2019s going to be on a case-by-case basis, and all of it is going to be hard, by the way.\u201d I reiterate:\u00a0 \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\nMost likely to earn points with real estate and other business leaders:\nThe Michael Bloomberg name drop\nIf I had a nickel for every time a real estate source has spoken wistfully of the Bloomberg administration, I would have\u2026I don\u2019t know, $7?\nIn any case, mentions of the former mayor fall into the previously mentioned \u201cknow your audience\u201d rule. All three candidates mentioned an aspect of Bloomberg\u2019s approach to being mayor that they admire and/or want to replicate.\nMost likely to grab headlines because, holy cow, someone actually made news at this thing:\nThe Rikers reboot\nThere\u2019s nothing like the excitement of an event where a speaker breaks news, until you realize that another publication was given the news the day before under embargo. I\u2019m not bitter.\n\nCuomo announced that as mayor, he would abandon plans to close Rikers and build four borough-based jails. Instead, he would rebuild Rikers and use the four sites for housing and commercial use.\nThe New York Times was first to report the proposal.\nMost likely to make\nTRD\neditors say \u201cWait, what?\u201d:\nThe \u201csimultaneous\u201d housing pledge\nCuomo said his first big project as mayor would be to build 500,000 housing units across 300 sites \u201csimultaneously.\u201d That \u201csimultaneously\u201d raises a lot of questions, but most critically: How?\nMost likely to be harder than it looks:\nProperty tax reform\nCall me pessimistic, but a lot of mayors have promised to tackle this issue, and it hasn\u2019t happened. The candidates didn\u2019t offer up specifics, though Cuomo said he believes the courts will have to force the city and state to the table. More on that\nhere\n.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nNow that Pacific Park has a\nnew development team\n, how will the vision for the remaining sites change? Who will pay for a platform over the rail yard? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Less than two months after the Midtown South rezoning, an office-to-residential conversion in the neighborhood is already in the works. Sheridan Wall\nreports\nthat Marty Burger and Andrew Heiberger paid $25 million for 29 West 35th Street with plans to convert it into 107 studio apartments.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Outdoor gear and clothing store REI is closing its Soho flagship store in 2026,\nCurbed reports\n. Stores in Paramus, N.J., and Boston, Mass., are also closing next year.\n\u2014 The NYPD\u2019s highest-ranking uniformed officer, Chief of Department John Chell, is retiring after less than a year in the role,\nGothamist reports\n. Chief Michael LiPetri will assume the position on an interim basis.\n\u2014Three state judges filed a lawsuit this week challenging New York\u2019s mandatory retirement age for judges,\nthe Times Union reports\n. The state constitution caps the age for judges at 70.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$7.3 million\nfor a pre-war cooperative unit at 1100 Park Avenue in Carnegie Hill. Jane R. Andrews and John Cronin of Coldwell Banker Warburg\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$19.5 million\nfor a 33,374-square-foot, mixed-use property at 6 Greene Street in Soho. It has six stories and 12 residential units.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$23 million\nfor a 4,603-square-foot condominium unit at 555 West 22nd Street in Chelsea. Shaun Osher with CORE NYC has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 133,619-square-foot, 160-unit residential project at 525 Wales Avenue in Mott Haven in the Bronx. Esther Dockery of NBO4 Architecture filed the permit on behalf of John DiBattista.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Manhattan\u2019s rental market is cooling, but not by much.\nThe median rent for a brokered apartment in Manhattan was $4,550 in September, down ever so slightly from the month before, but still up more than 8 percent over last year, according to a monthly report from appraiser Miller Samuel for Douglas Elliman.\nAcross the city, rents are in a holding pattern. After beginning a streak of\nhigh prices in February\n, they\u2019ve since passed peaks and continued bobbing at the top of the chart. Although the pressures that pushed rents up are easing off, there\u2019s unlikely to be a significant decline in prices anytime soon, said Jonathan Miller, the report\u2019s author.\n\u201c[The only] economic force that could drive rents lower would be a severe recession,\u201d said Miller.\nFor the past several months,\nelevated mortgage rates have kept would-be buyers\nin the rental market, driving up demand for those units, Miller said. In July, Manhattan rents set a new all-time record at $4,700.\nMortgage rates have begun to come down slightly, and demand typically falls in autumn. But those headwinds are not enough to really turn the march of rents around, Miller said.\nThe market remains tight. Inventory in Manhattan was low for the month, at 9,244 listings, a decline of nearly 8 percent year over year. That could indicate a high number of lease renewals, Miller said. Renewals are typically at lower prices than new leases and are not captured in the report.\n\nLow turnover and high renewals may suit landlords just fine, as an uncertain economic picture makes locking in tenants look preferable to testing the market. And renters might be deciding that what they\u2019re seeing on StreetEasy just isn\u2019t worth it.\nTurnover may dip lower in the future if mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani wins the election and institutes a\npromised rent freeze on rent-stabilized apartments\n. That policy could put pressure on rents in market-rate apartments, Miller said, by lowering inventory and prompting landlords to make up money on any market-rate apartments they own.\nCompetition for a unit wasn\u2019t at record highs in September, but it was still elevated. About 22 percent of leases in Manhattan were subject to bidding wars, according to Miller. That number was 23 percent in Queens and 33 percent in Brooklyn.\nMedian rent for brokered apartments in Brooklyn was $3,925 in September, just $25 lower than\nthe median in August\n. Prices have risen 7.5 percent in the last year.\nInventory was down in Brooklyn as well. At 5,681, it was 3 percent lower than in August.\nThe median rent in Northwest Queens, which includes Astoria, Long Island City, Sunnyside and Woodside, was $3,650. That was a 4 percent increase year over year.\n",

The seller was a trust tied to\nRandy Fishman\n, widow of former Travelers Cos. CEO\nJay Fishman\n. The Fishmans purchased the 3,200-square-foot pad in 2010 for $4.2 million; it went up for sale in March for $7.3 million. The unit has three bedrooms, three and a half baths, an in-home gym and a private elevator landing. Coldwell Banker Warburg\u2019s\nJane Andrews\nand\nJohn Cronin\nhad the listing.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe priciest commercial deal recorded in the city clocked in at just $7 million. The\nRenaissance Youth Center\n, which provides educational and music programming for children in the South Bronx, purchased its building at\n3485 Third Avenue\nfrom an LLC tied to developer\nKiumarz Guela\nthat had owned the property for about two decades.

The seller was an affiliate of\nAmerasia Bank\n, and the buyer was\nFarrington Capital LLC\n. The commercial space and 8 of 12 of the property\u2019s residential condos were included in the transaction.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nAn LLC tied to\nSun Choi Tsang\noffloaded a development site at\n37 Meserole Street\nin East Williamsburg for $6.4 million. The purchaser was an LLC linked to\nZihang Chen\n, which took out $11.3 million in financing from an affiliate of\nS3 Capital\nfor the deal. Tsang had owned the property since the early 1990s and had planned to build a residential complex there.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nA sponsor unit at\n500 West 18th Street\nin Chelsea sold for just under $6 million.

        "content": "After five years without a property tax hike, Evanston homeowners are facing a potential 12.9 percent increase next year under a $342 million draft budget proposed by City Manager Luke Stowe.\nThe proposal calls for filling a $6.5 million gap in the budget with the tax increase to balance the budget and maintain city services. If approved by the City Council, the hike would raise annual tax bills for the owners of median-value properties by $174 to $400, the Chicago Tribune first\nreported\n.\nThose figures include the library\u2019s proposed levy increase and are based on 2023 Cook County tax rates, since 2024 data is not yet available.\nFor a condo valued at the city\u2019s median of $294,000, the owner would owe roughly $174 more. A single-family homeowner with a $675,000 valuation would pay about $400 more, while a\nmultifamily building owner\nwith a property worth $620,000 would see a $367 bump.\nThe proposal ends a half-decade of tax stability driven by one-time revenue sources, federal stimulus funds and inflation-fueled growth, the city manager said.\n\nThe\ncity\u2019s\nrising pension obligations for police and firefighters, guided by a new funding policy aimed at meeting state mandates by 2040, are a major cost driver.\nAlthough the proposed 12.9 percent increase applies only to the city and library\u2019s share of the tax bill, that portion makes up just 19 percent of an\nEvanston\nhomeowner\u2019s total tax load. The city said the hike would translate to a 2.4 percent rise in the total bill, with roughly two-thirds of all property tax revenue flowing to local school districts.\nEvanston\u2019s\nbudget also includes fee hikes \u2014 including $7 a month more for yard waste and bulk pickups \u2014 and $91.5 million in capital spending. Projects include nearly $32 million for street and sewer work, $17 million for park improvements across multiple sites, $11.7 million for city facility upgrades, and $7 million for an electrical reliability project at the Evanston Water Plant, funded largely by regional partners.\nPublic hearings begin next week, and a final council vote is expected later this fall.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Houston logged another quarter of positive office space absorption with Geico\u2019s renewal topping the list.\nThe auto insurer renewed its full-building lease at Mason Creek I in Katy, according to Colliers. It was the third quarter\u2019s largest office transaction.\nMason Creek I, at 21420 Merchants Way, is a 135,000-square-foot office building constructed in 2013. Nicola Wealth has owned it since 2015. It\u2019s about 24 miles west of downtown Houston.\nThe property is in Houston\u2019s Katy submarket, which accounted for 7.8 percent of leasing activity in the third quarter. It ranked sixth in terms of submarkets with the largest amount of positive absorption. West Loop and the\nEnergy Corridor\ntopped the list; both logged more than 200,000 square feet of positive absorption.\nHouston\u2019s office market has been\nslow to recover from the pandemic\n, but the market indicators are gradually improving.\n\nThe metro\u2019s overall vacancy rate dropped from 27.9 percent a year ago to 27.4 percent. In the third quarter last year, the market saw\n23,700 square feet of negative absorption\n. This year, 555,000 square feet was absorbed in July through September, marking the second quarter in a row that more space was leased than vacated, marking the first sustained positive absorption since 2019, Colliers said.\nThe flight to quality office trend seen throughout the country is also at play in Houston.\nThe average vacancy of properties built in the last decade is 11.9 percent, highlighting companies\u2019 preference for newer office space with top-of-the-line amenities.\nFor example, Skanska delivered Norton Rose Fulbright Tower, a 386,000-square-foot office building at 1550 Lamar Street, last year. The 28-story building is 62 percent leased, with\nThird Coast Infrastructure\nbeing the latest company to sign a deal to move into the trophy building.\n",

        "content": "A waterfront estate hit the market in Austin for $11 million, as a shrinking buyer pool pushes ultra-luxury properties onto public listing services.\nThe eight-acre property at 11941 Overlook Pass includes a 4,000-square-foot main house as well as a guest house and a saloon-styled party hall. The property is one of a few that fronts Barton Creek, a popular Austin recreational spot.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to build on Barton Creek,\u201d said Douglas Elliman agent Jeanne Parker, who has the listing along with with Julie Mack.\nParker and Mack are expecting a buyer who values privacy and family considerations.\n\u201cThree of the best private schools in Austin are within a 10- to 15-minute drive of this property,\u201d Parker said.\n\u201cA lot of celebrities live there, a lot of professional athletes, because of the privacy. They don\u2019t like drones following them around, and you can\u2019t do that here,\u201d Mack said.\n\nMost agents would prefer to market a property of this price in private. However, fewer buyers means more luxury homes are hitting the MLS, Mack said.\nAustin has one of the\nhighest median days on market\nof any luxury market in the country, according to Redfin. Toward the end of the hot season, the market overall had more than two sellers for every buyer, making Austin one of\nthe most seller-saturated markets in the country\n.\nAs a result, price cuts have become more common for luxury homes in the area. The two most expensive homes sold on the MLS last week\ncut their asking prices\nbefore selling, and one spent over 190 days on the market.\nWhile Parker and Mack are marketing the nearby schools, most people who have taken an interest in the property are retired grandparents, the agents said. Single-family properties in the area are attracting more luxury buyers than\ncondos\nare, suggesting that the tech industry\u2019s waning interest in Austin is siphoning more single, childless workers than parents back to the coast, Parker speculated.\n\u201cDuring the pandemic, we had a lot of people coming in from California, which raised the prices, and that has slowed down,\u201d Parker said.\n\u201cMost of our people are coming in from New York, New Jersey, Chicago, probably for tax reasons,\u201d Mack said.\n",

        "content": "Dallas is finally trying to unload one of its biggest real estate embarrassments after years of dysfunction.\nThe city listed 7800 North Stemmons Freeway, an 11-story 228,300-square-foot office building that has cost at least $29 million in taxpayer funds after an initial purchase price of $14.1 million. CBRE is marketing the site as an \u201coutstanding redevelopment or owner-user opportunity,\u201d the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nThe property, built in 1981 and renovated about a decade ago, was supposed to house the city\u2019s beleaguered permitting office.\nBut according to an April after-action report from\nCity Manager\nKimberly\nTolbert\n, the building was so structurally unsound that the city couldn\u2019t even secure a certificate of occupancy. Despite sinking another $15 million into repairs, the site remains uninhabitable, forcing staff back to their old digs on East Jefferson Boulevard.\nFallout from Tolbert\u2019s report included the short-term suspension of any public real estate purchases unless previously approved by the\nCity Council\n, as well as a review of the city\u2019s working agreement with CBRE going forward and to finalize a request for proposal for a comprehensive citywide\nreal estate master plan\n.\n\nIt\u2019s also been a costly blunder to maintain: Dallas is spending roughly $73,000 a month on security and upkeep. The city recently pulled permits \u2014 totaling nearly $650,000 \u2014 to install a new fire alarm system, even as it moves to offload the property. CBRE\u2019s marketing materials highlight the building\u2019s 5-acre site, flexible zoning and proximity to the Medical District, but the listing is unpriced and being sold strictly \u201cas-is, where-is.\u201d\nThe city\u2019s decision to buy the building in 2022 was made under then\u2013City Manager\nT.C. Broadnax\n, following what Tolbert later called \u201conly a surface-level review\u201d by JLL.\nDallas officials, including Council Member Chad West, confirmed they only learned the property had quietly hit the market after inquiries from the media. CBRE broker Patrick Benoist, who worked on the deal, declined to comment to the outlet, citing instructions from his client \u2014 the city. Offers are due in about three weeks, after which the council will review its options privately.\nCommercial brokers said the property is likely a teardown, given its condition and location along the moribund Stemmons Corridor. City Hall is hoping to cut its losses and turn a costly cautionary tale into someone else\u2019s redevelopment play.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "If the Florida condo crisis were a hurricane, the worst of the storm appears to have passed by Palm Beach.\nWhile the government doesn\u2019t control the weather, it does have command over the regulatory environment that created difficulties for the state\u2019s condo market. In the wake of the deadly Champlain Towers collapse in Surfside, lawmakers scrambled to prevent another tragedy with a slate of\nnew safety laws\nthat have their own consequences. The legislation mandated that condos complete milestone inspections and reserve studies. While these rules apply to every residential building 30 years or older, the effects are evolving into a story of the haves and have-nots, especially when the multimillion-dollar assessments roll in.\nAs the statewide condo market continues to absorb the shock of regulations,\nPalm Beach\n, where money is no issue, illustrates how affluent communities are better equipped to handle the impact.\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s reading the same doom and gloom about this market,\u201d said Scott Gordon, a Douglas Elliman agent in Palm Beach. \u201cFor the luxury market, those buildings are in better shape than they\u2019ve been in a decade.\u201d\nWhile Palm Beach\u2019s oceanfront estates and nine-figure residential sales are perhaps better known, the island also has dozens of condominiums, both in town and on the South End, the majority of which are older than 30 years and subject to the new safety laws. With the\nregulations, rising insurance rates and competition\nfrom new development in West Palm Beach, agents said the island\u2019s condo market suffered in the first half of the year.\nBut as activity picks up ahead of the busy winter season, brokers say the sky is clearing for the island\u2019s aging condo supply. The median sale price for condos in Palm Beach has ticked up to $2.7 million, Redfin shows. One hundred sixty-four units are listed for sale, with prices ranging from $315,000 to $17.9 million, according to the listing site. Earlier this month, one Palm Beacher dropped\n$9.4 million\non a unit at Bellaria at 3000 South Ocean Boulevard after selling her home for $30 million.\nCosts for assessments and repairs are averaging between $75 and $100 per square foot, with most of the funds going to cover concrete restoration, Gordon said. That translates to $150,000 to $200,000 for a 2,000-square-foot condo. Brokers declined to comment on assessments of specific buildings.\n\u201cAll these buildings have either completed [assessments and repairs] or have almost completed them,\u201d said Corcoran Group\u2019s Dana Koch.\n\nElsewhere in South Florida, similar assessments are financially devastating for unit owners. Howard Konetz, who lives on a fixed income and owns a unit at Aventura\u2019s Mediterranean Village, told\nFox Business\nhe is facing a $224,000 assessment fee. He wanted to sell, but took the condo off the market after multiple price cuts failed to lure a buyer, Zillow shows.\nMarket insiders say Palm Beach\u2019s condo owners have deeper pockets than most. If a building had a problem, they had the money to throw at it. Now, the worst is behind them, and all of the improvements are a boon for resales, brokers say. Many buildings are in better physical condition and fiscal health than in recent years, thanks to the regulations. Design updates are also helping to close deals, said Elliman\u2019s Chris Leavitt.\n\u201cIt really highlights the buildings that are in perfect condition,\u201d said Leavitt, who pointed to the recently renovated Biltmore at 150 Bradley Place. Leavitt closed two sales in the building over the summer, which he credited in part to the updates.\nPalm Beach\u2019s older condo buildings benefit from immediacy; they are ready to use now, rather than the\nnew developments\nin West Palm Beach that have years-long waits. Buyers are also coming in educated and asking the right questions, agents say.\n\u201cBuyers have just gotten smart. They will ask, \u2018Have you done your milestone inspection? Have you done this? Have you budgeted for it?\u2019\u201d Corcoran\u2019s Suzanne Frisbie said.\nPricing is also playing an important role. Sellers are letting go of pandemic-era dreams, Gordon said.\n\u201cPrices are coming down to reflect the reality of the market,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order to get a lot of these deals done, the sellers have been much more receptive to paying off special assessments just to move the deals forward.\u201d\nKoch said one of his sellers paid $62,000 to cover assessment fees and move a deal along. Some buildings are adopting \u2018due on sale\u2019 clauses to mandate sellers pay off their share of assessments, including the Cove at 2784 South Ocean Boulevard, Meridian at 3300 South Ocean Boulevard and Halcyon at 3440 South Ocean Boulevard. Gordon said he had a deal in the Meridian, which took out a $10 million loan for its repairs, that involved a $122,000 payment for its \u2018due on sale\u2019 clause.\n\u201cI think every contract that we\u2019ve written lately has a \u2018due on sale\u2019 clause for the special assessment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe seller in almost every sale that we\u2019ve done is responsible for the full payment of the assessments.\u201d",

        "content": "Developers have filed permits for the construction of an eight-story\nmultifamily development\nin Santa Monica.\nVirginia-based Orr Partners, in partnership with designer Tighe Architecture, has filed plans to build the residential property at 1723 Cloverfield Boulevard, located near the 26th Street/Bergamot Metro station, L.A. Yimby\nreported\n. The project would\nreplace a one-story office building\nand adjacent parking lot.\nThe proposal calls for Orr to build 330 studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments across eight floors above ground. Underground, residents will have access to three levels of subterranean parking accommodating 357 vehicles and additional space for bicycles.\nOf the proposed apartments, 10 percent of them, or 33 units, will be set aside as deed-restricted affordable housing for moderate-income, low-income, and very-low-income households. In Los Angeles County, moderate income for one person is\ncategorized\nas making less than $89,550 annually, while low-income is a maximum of $84,850 and very-low-income falls under $53,000 for one person. By including affordable units in the development, the project qualifies for density bonus incentives, allowing the developer additional height and floor area than what zoning limits permit.\nThe ground floor includes floor-to-ceiling windows for resident amenities and lobby space, while units above have recessed balconies. The upper floors step back from the street\u2019s edge to create landscaped terraces and a rooftop green space. In addition to recessed balconies, residents will benefit from passive sustainability touches like solar shading as well as the planned landscaping to improve environmental performances.\n\nUnder its\nhousing element\n, the City of Santa Monica is required to build or plan for 8,874 new housing units by 2029. Of those, 69 percent must be priced at various affordable-income levels.\nThis summer, the City of Santa Monica put out a call to developers interested in\nbuying plots of city-owned land\nwith plans for affordable housing, with the largest of the three parcels just around the corner from Orr\u2019s proposed construction site. Interested developers can apply to purchase a 5.6-acre parcel at 2525 Michigan Avenue on the opposite side of\nBergamot Station Arts Center\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Barbara Corcoran, founder of the eponymous real estate firm and a star investor on the \u201cShark Tank\u201d television series, has cashed out on her New York City penthouse.\nThe 76-year-old entrepreneur listed the condo at 1158 Fifth Avenue in May and\nfound a buyer a day\nafter listing it,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported. The closed deal came out to $13.5 million, exceeding her\noriginal asking price by $1.5 million\n, according to\nRealtor.com\n.\nCorcoran purchased the historic penthouse at 1158 Fifth Avenue for $10 million in 2015 and invested an additional $2 million in renovations to tailor the home to her taste.\nThe Corcoran Group founder has talked publicly about her longtime personal connection to the residence.\nHer relationship with the Upper East Side penthouse dates to 1992, when she was working as a messenger. One of her deliveries led her to the home, which she has described as captivating,\u00a0 despite being out of her financial reach at the time. She even asked the owner to keep her in mind if the property ever became available. In 2015, after being contacted by the owner, Corcoran purchased the property.\nShe later embarked on a complete overhaul, reconfiguring the upstairs and downstairs spaces, transforming a greenhouse area into an indoor/outdoor dining space, and upgrading the kitchen.\n\nThe enhanced home now has 11 rooms across two floors, with views of Central Park and the city\u2019s skyline.\nAfter nearly a decade as her primary residence, Corcoran decided to sell the penthouse due to her husband, Bill Higgins, struggling with the staircase that connected the two levels. They began searching for a single-story home to suit his mobility needs. Their search included a disappointing miss with an offer for a Fifth Avenue co-op formerly belonging to Hollywood icons\nPaul Newman and Joanne Woodward\n.\nCorcoran has relocated to a single-floor penthouse located nearby in the uptown neighborhood.\nThe real estate heavyweight also this year lost her Pacific Palisades trailer home in the\nCalifornia wildfires\n. She has said she plans to rebuild the home.\n\u2013 Joel Russell",

        "content": "Nearly a year after a group of unit owners at a two-tower condo on Brickell Avenue in Miami voted to oust their association president, a judge ordered that the board, including its president, turn over all records and control of the association.\nThat means Jacob Kassel, the board president who led the association\u2019s passage of a $21 million special assessment, the elimination of electronic voting and other\ncontroversial actions\n, is out at\n1060 Brickell\n, a two-tower, 45-story complex with 592 units at 1060 Brickell Avenue.\nMiami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Joseph Perkins ordered in late September that the board be replaced by Dorinda Spahr, Jermaine Jones and Javier Noriega. The Kassel-led board was also ordered to turn over all records and property of the\nBrickell\nassociation by last Friday, according to the court order. The order is part of the lawsuit the association filed against unit owner James Duddey and others who introduced the recall effort.\nThe ruling doesn\u2019t resolve the litigation involving owners and the\nassociation\n, but it marks a big win for the owners who twice voted to recall their board over the past year. And it reaffirms the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation\u2019s final order, issued in July, that certified one of the recall efforts. That order determined that the current board be removed and that the board turn over all records and association property, including checkbooks, within 10 business days. Spahr, Jones and Noriega were to be appointed to the board effective immediately. But the association appealed.\n\u201cThis case really illustrates some of the issues with the current versions of the recall laws,\u201d Haber Law attorney Jonathan Goldstein told\nThe Real Deal.\nGoldstein and his colleague, Ariella Gutman, represent unit owners Duddey, Spahr and Nu\u00f1ez and other owners.\nThe condo association\u2019s attorney, Marc Halpern, and Kassel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\u201cOur outcome followed nearly a year of intense and costly legal battles against a board that refused to step down,\u201d Spahr, the new president, said. \u201cWe won this case because a committed group of owners united, they financially supported the cause and they were relentless.\u201d\n\nThe new board will remain in place at least until the annual election in November.\nLast November, an official election was not held because the Kassel-led association disqualified the three candidates (Spahr, Jones and Noriega), so the existing board remained in power. Jones and Noriega challenged this via a separate arbitration petition filed with the state, while Spahr and other unit owners sued the association in January, alleging that the November 2024 election was canceled \u201con the incorrect and improper stated basis that there were an insufficient number of candidates to hold an election,\u201d the lawsuit states.\nOwners previously told\nTRD\nthat they had spent more than half a million dollars on attorney fees since last year, in addition to funding the association\u2019s legal fees via their monthly dues. The group of owners said the special assessment, which called for work that included nearly $8 million in fa\u00e7ade restoration and $3.5 million in work to the garage and basement, was unwarranted for a complex that was completed in 2008 \u2014 17 years ago.\nIn a separate lawsuit, Jessica Bergman and Antonio Sevillano, a married couple, sued the condo association in December. Their complaint, seeking a class action, amended in January, alleged that the board\u2019s passage of the special assessment violated Florida law by failing to provide a description of the special assessment and by failing to allow unit owners to vote on it. Bergman and Sevillano alleged that the board\u2019s 2-1 vote on the assessment also violated the property\u2019s condo declaration.\nThe condo association\u2019s attorney, Halpern, told\nTRD\nthis summer that it is the board\u2019s fiduciary duty to maintain the property and make necessary repairs, and Kassel said that his priority was ensuring the property is safe.\nJudge Perkins\u2019 latest order was the result of a Sept. 26 hearing. Perkins found that Duddey had demonstrated a \u201csubstantial likelihood of success\u201d on the recall effort.\nPerkins wrote that the court found the association\u2019s violations of the Florida Condominium Act resulted in \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d His granting of a temporary injunction, he wrote, \u201cwill serve the public interest.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Investors in homebuilder stocks responded to comments from President Donald Trump and\nfederal housing head Bill Pulte\nwith a selloff that set off a four-day losing streak.\nThe sector\u2019s S&amp;P index saw a downturn of nearly 9 percent this week, marking the worst performance for homebuilders since Trump\u2019s tariff announcement in early April, according to\nBloomberg\n.\nHomebuilders have faced mounting challenges this year, from\nrising inventory levels\nto new tariffs on imports of timber, lumber and other wood goods essential to home construction. The administration has further intensified the situation by blaming builders for the ongoing housing affordability crisis.\nThe situation worsened after Trump\u2019s post on social media, which criticized homebuilders for having millions of empty lots and urged them to begin constructing homes.\nPulte, grandson of\nPulteGroup\u2019s founder William J. Pulte\n, echoed the sentiment, claiming major homebuilders now control 50 percent to 60 percent of the market and bear the bulk of the responsibility to contribute to housing supply.\nPulte also said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would require disclosures for \u201cBig Builder\u201d loans, potentially increasing scrutiny on their practices.\n\nUrging builders to construct more homes could further harm the industry, given the existing unsold inventory and declining margins, Renaissance Macro Research economics head Neil Dutta told the outlet. He described Pulte\u2019s comments as \u201cbullying\u201d builders.\nThe hardest-hit stocks in the sector this year include LGI Homes, Champion Homes and Century Communities, each down more than 20 percent, while Lennar has dropped more than 8 percent. PulteGroup, on the other hand, has seen a 17 percent increase in its stock price.\nThe sector has seen a 19 percent decline in the last 12 months, a significant underperformance compared to the S&amp;P 500\u2019s 16 percent rally.\nMarket analysts have pointed out the underlying issues for builders, such as rising margin pressures due to increasing inventory, which has led to price reductions in critical markets. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, new-home supply is at its highest level since 2007.\nRising tariffs on softwood lumber and kitchen cabinets could increase the cost of a new home by more than $10,000, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Drew Reading warned last month, while the\noverall sentiment of homebuyers remains depressed\n.\n\u2013 Joel Russell",

        "content": "Officials have put a face to the start of the deadly Palisades Fire.\nJonathan Rinderknecht, a 29-year-old former Uber driver living in Florida, has been arrested and charged with federal arson for allegedly setting a fire in January that became the Palisades blaze, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\nRinderknecht, who reportedly lived in the L.A. area before moving to Florida this year, allegedly dropped off a passenger in the\nPacific Palisades\nnear where a fire was later discovered to have started just after midnight on Jan. 1. The 29-year-old purportedly walked up a hiking trail, took videos on his phone and listened to a rap song, \u201cUn Zder, Un The\u201d by French artist Josman, with a music video showing \u201cobjects being lit on fire,\u201d Bill Essayli, the U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles, said,\naccording\nto\nBloomberg and ABC News.\nEnvironmental sensors detected the beginnings of a fire in the early morning hours of Jan. 1, and Rinderknecht himself called 911 to report the fire. He allegedly fled the scene but returned after seeing fire trucks driving back up to where it started.\n\u201cThe fire continued to smolder and burn underground within the root structure of the dense vegetation,\u201d Essayli said. \u201cSo that fire started on Jan. 1, and it smoldered underground for about a week until on Jan. 7. Heavy winds caused this underground fire to surface and spread above ground, causing what became known as the Palisades Fire, one of the most destructive\nwildfires\nin Los Angeles city history.\u201d\nWhen federal authorities seized Rinderknecht\u2019s digital devices, they found an AI-generated image from Chat GPT depicting a burning city. The accused arsonist moved to Florida \u201cbecause he was aware that people might be looking for him,\u201d Essayli said.\nInvestigators spent months tracking down the fire\u2019s origins and even re-staged the blaze in an attempt to learn more about how it started. Kenny Cooper, Assistant Special Agent in Charge for the San Francisco Field Division of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said Rinderknecht bears sole responsibility for the kindling of the fire.\n\n\u201cThat fire burned deep within the ground, in roots and in structure, and remained active for several days,\u201d Cooper said,\nper\nthe L.A. Times. \u201cNo matter how good they are, they can\u2019t see that, right?\u201d\nThose who dealt with Rinderknecht knew him to be a relatively reserved person. \u201dHe kept to himself,\u201d one anonymous neighbor told the Times.\nAnother former neighbor, 39-year-old Peter Chang of\nHollywood\n, was shocked to learn Rinderknecht was accused of lighting the fire. \u201cHe was actually a really nice guy,\u201d Chang said.\nA former roommate who lived with Rinderknecht in the Palisades didn\u2019t believe the suspect would do such a thing. \u201cI can only tell you the Jonathan I know would never do anything like that,\u201d the anonymous roommate told the Times. He noted that Rinderknecht would sometimes \u201cjust start talking fast and get bratty with people who confronted him. But he wouldn\u2019t get violent; he would maybe just smoke some pot and go to sleep.\u201d\nRinderknecht\u2019s preliminary hearing is set for Oct. 17.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "At a time when many downtown office tenants are downsizing, one logistics player is making the most of Chicago\u2019s centrality and doing the opposite.\nAustin, Texas-based Arrive Logistics, a major freight brokerage connecting shippers with trucking carriers, signed a lease for 77,700 square feet across three floors at 30 South Wacker Drive, expanding its space by 21,000 square feet, according to property owner Tishman Speyer and first\nreported\nby Crain\u2019s. Located at the\nCME Center\nin the West Loop, the firm plans on bringing 100 new jobs to Chicago next year.\nThe deal extended Arrive\u2019s commitment to the two-tower complex through 2037. It\u2019s the third expansion for Arrive since the firm set up shop there a decade ago. Terry Herlihy of NAI Hiffman represented Arrive in the deal. Ellen May and Isabella Rapken negotiated for\nthe landlord\n.\nThe move bucks the broader trend of contraction across the Loop, where downtown office users have collectively shed more than 2 million square feet over the past two years, according to CBRE.\nMany firms are rethinking their office space needs amid hybrid work patterns, leaving landlords scrambling to fill gaps.\n\nBut transportation logistics firms \u2014 long anchored in Chicago \u2014 have proved an exception. Companies such as MoLo Solutions, Loadsmart and Total Quality Logistics have all grown their downtown presence since 2020, riding a post-pandemic surge in e-commerce and supply chain demand.\nArrive has about 470 employees in\u00a0 its Chicago office, and its headcount is expected to top 570 next year. The company\u2019s fast growth \u2014 projected to lift this year\u2019s revenue 35 percent year-over-year to $2.5 billion \u2014 drove the need for more space. The firm also touted Chicago\u2019s talent pool.\nArrive\u2019s employees are largely in the office full-time, and the lease will consolidate its offices within CME Center in a contiguous space. The buildout will be phased through next year, with completion slated for October.\nNew York-based\nTishman Speyer\nrecently modernized the CME Center lobby and retained other key tenants \u2014 including\nBP\n, which earlier this year renewed its 240,000-square-foot lease through 2032. The 2.3 million-square-foot complex is about 85 percent leased, per CoStar.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s recent call to jail Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is just the latest smackdown in a long personality rivalry between the two real estate billionaires.\nThe two have sparred over wealth, immigration, crime and democracy, with Pritzker recently questioning Trump\u2019s mental fitness and suggesting he has dementia, according to a\nWall Street Journal\nreport.\nBut the clash started with a decades-old Manhattan hotel dispute involving Pritzker\u2019s late uncle.\nThe bad blood first surfaced in 1992, in a fight over the ownership of the Grand Hyatt hotel in New York. Trump owned half and the Pritzker family of Chicago owned the other half. When the Priztkers pushed for\u00a0 and the Pritzkers wanted an expensive upgrade to the property.\nTrump saw the demand, which required more cash from each owner, as an attempt to take advantage of him at his weakest moment, as his three casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, were in Chapter 11 at the time, according to a\nWall Street Journal story published in 2016\n.\nTrump sued the Pritzkers, accusing them of civil racketeering to force him out of the deal, an allegation they denied.\n\u201cI called Jay [Pritzker] and said, \u2018You\u2019re a bad guy, Jay. I\u2019m going to kick your ass,\u2019\u201d Trump told the Journal in 2016.\n\nTrump later settled the suit and the Pritzkers\u2019 Hyatt Corporation bought his half of the property for $140 million. Jay Pritzker, JB\u2019s uncle and Trump\u2019s main antagonist in the drama, died in 1999.\nMore recently, the Illinois governor has clashed with the president over Trump\u2019s claims of crime and immigration issues in the Windy City.\nTensions reached a fever pitch last week after federal agents with the Department of Homeland Security\nraided a building on Chicago\u2019s South Shore\n, resulting in the arrests of 37 people and outcry from local officials over the atypical detainment of tenants, including children, during the operation.\nThe raid raised questions about\nlandlord and tenants\u2019 rights in the city\namid an escalation in federal scrutiny,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported.\nTrump this week deployed 300 Illinois National Guard members and 200 Texas troops to Chicago. Pritzker condemned the move as unconstitutional, and the state filed a lawsuit seeking a restraining order. Trump responded to Pritzker\u2019s rebukes of immigration agents on the ground by saying he, along with Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, \u201cshould be in jail.\u201d\nThe governor isn\u2019t the only Pritzker family member still engaging in the long-running clash with Trump.\nJB\u2019s sister Penny, who served as finance chair for Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaign, has engaged in recent months\nin a separate battle with the Trump administration\nover antisemitism claims at Harvard University, where she now serves as a senior fellow on its governing board.\n\u2013 Joel Russell",

        "content": "Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell\u2019s former\nPacific Palisades\npad is set to hit the market Friday with an asking price nearly double what its current owners paid in 2017.\nThe five-bedroom, five-bathroom home at 1417 Capri Drive spans 6,400 square feet. It\u2019s expected to be listed for $13.5 million, or $2,113 per square foot.\nCompass\u2019 Josh Flagg has the listing.\nRecords show Hawn and Russell bought the property in 2004 for $4.1 million and held it for over a decade, before selling it in 2017 for $6.9 million. The seller is a trust tied to Champion Real Estate Company founders Robert and Marjorie Champion, according to property records.\nThe Santa Monica-based real estate firm began in 1987 and focuses on multifamily, retail, office, mixed-use and adaptive reuse projects. It has invested more than $2 billion into properties since the firm was founded, according to its website.\nThe Champions invested in the Capri Drive home and renovated it before placing the traditional-designed property on the market.\n\nSeveral features of the home lend to entertaining, including a bedroom conversion to a temperature-controlled wine tasting room, a pool, fire pits, barbecue area, outdoor dining and putting green. Other highlights include four fireplaces, a den with its own skylight and primary suite touting a custom walk-in closet and a connected bonus room.\nFlagg said in a statement to\nThe Real Deal\nthat the\nPalisades\nis seeing \u201crenewed momentum.\u201d\n\u201cWith many lots being sold in the aftermath of the fires, there are few move-in ready homes available, and this street remains one of the rare areas untouched,\u201d Flagg said.\nRodeo Realty\u2019s Jimmy Heckenberg and The Agency\u2019s Santiago Arana currently hold the Palisades\u2019 highest-priced listing, located at 766 Paseo Miramar. The 18,000-square-foot, new-build went on the market in June for $54 million and was relisted in August for $39 million, or $2,123 per square foot.\nThis year\u2019s priciest known residential sale in the Palisades was\n1124 Napoli Drive\n, which closed off market in late August for $25.8 million, or $2,437 per square foot. The Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Lea Porter and Carolwood Estates\u2019 Zac Mostame represented the seller and buyer.\n",

        "content": "In a sign of a lagging suburban office market in Miami-Dade County, Hamilton Development is planning to redevelop two distressed buildings into a pair of warehouses.\nAn affiliate of Nashville-based Hamilton, led by Whitfield Hamilton, paid $20.4 million for an office building in the Flagler Station business park near\nDoral\nvia a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction, records and real estate database Vizzda show. Salt Lake City, Utah-based Bridge Investment Group sold the 126,224-square-foot building at 9725 Northwest 117th Avenue.\nMatthew McCormack with JLL brokered the deal.\nIn May, Bridge Investment also sold to Hamilton a 124,227-square-foot office building at 10451 Northwest 117th Avenue in a\n$21.1 million\ndeed-in-lieu of foreclosure deal and a 156,928-square-foot office building at 9675 Northwest 117th Avenue for $20.8 million.\n\nBridge Investment\nbought the three adjacent office properties for a combined $85.8 million in 2018, financing the purchase with a $64.6 million loan from a Wells Fargo affiliate, records show. In May, Wells Fargo filed a foreclosure complaint against the Bridge Investment entities that owned the 24.4-acre assemblage, alleging default on a $59.2 million mortgage.\nAs part of its purchase for all three buildings, Hamilton assumed the mortgage, records show.\nHamilton plans to tear down the buildings at 9725 Northwest 117th Avenue and at 10451 Northwest 117th Avenue, and replace them with two industrial facilities spanning more than 300,000 square feet, a press release states. The office building at 9675 Northwest 117th Avenue will remain as part of the new development that will be called Flagler Logistics Center.\nHamilton plans to break ground on the warehouses next year and expects to complete the project in 2027, the release states.\nThe firm is also planning an office-to-industrial conversion in\nKendall\n, a suburban unincorporated neighborhood in southwest Miami-Dade. In August, Hamilton paid Baptist Health South Florida\n$12.3 million\nfor the office building at 14100 Southwest 136th Street with plans to redevelop the site into a 113,900-square-foot warehouse complex.",
