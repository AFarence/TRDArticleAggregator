        "content": "For the first time in a long time, Miami\u2019s next mayor won\u2019t be a member of a familial political dynasty.\nOn Tuesday, former Miami-Dade County commissioner Eileen Higgins and ex-Miami City Manager Emilio Gonzalez won first and second place, respectively, in\nMiami\u2019s mayoral election\n. However, Higgins did not capture more than 50 percent of the vote to avoid a runoff.\nThe race featured 13 candidates, but the real drama involved three contenders whose families have lorded over Miami politics since the 1980s. City commissioner\nJoe Carollo\n, who returned to city hall in 2017 after serving two terms as mayor from 1998 to 2001, mustered only 12 percent of the vote in his latest bid for Miami\u2019s top elected post. Carollo raised nearly $1 million, with many big name real estate players financially backing him.\nXavier Suarez, another former Miami mayor and father of the current mayor,\nFrancis Suarez\n; and Alex Diaz de la Portilla, an ex-city commissioner who was removed from office in 2023, each garnered 5 percent of the vote. Diaz de la Portilla is a former state legislator whose brothers Renier Diaz de la Portilla and Miguel Diaz de la Portilla also served stints as county and state elected officials.\nCarollo\u2019s political action committee, Miami First, relied heavily on real estate industry contributions, despite a federal jury slapping Carollo with a\n$63 million\njudgment after finding him guilty of violating the rights of Little Havana developers\nBill Fuller\nand Martin Pinilla. Entities controlled by JDS Development Group\u2019s\nMichael Stern\ndonated a combined $125,000 to Miami First. Stern\u2019s firm is developing a Dolce &amp; Gabbana-branded condo-hotel in Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood.\nEntities managed by Nuri Dorra, who is co-developing Essence Miami, a multifamily project with 88 affordable and workforce housing apartments in Little Havana, contributed a combined $120,000 to Miami First.\nDiaz de la Portilla\u2019s biggest support came from real estate investors\nDavid and Leila Centner\n. The Miami Beach power couple donated $100,000 to Diaz de la Portilla\u2019s political action committee, Proven Leadership for Miami-Dade County. The contribution represented nearly half of the committee\u2019s haul in the three months ended in June. The PAC reported zero contributions between July and September, the most recent campaign finance filing period.\nMeanwhile, Vlad Doronin\u2019s\nOKO Group\nand Blanca Commercial Real Estate each contributed $10,000 to Suarez\u2019s Imagine Miami PAC.\nHiggins resigned from her county commission seat less than a year after being reelected without opposition to run for Miami mayor. Her individual campaign and three political action committees supporting her collected five-figure donations from several prominent developers.\nDavid Martin\u2019s Coconut Grove-based\nTerra\ncontributed a combined $67,500, and\nRelated Group\n, also based in Coconut Grove and led by Jorge, Nick and Jon Paul P\u00e9rez, donated a combined $50,000. Swerdlow Group, led by Michael Swerdlow, Craig Robins\u2019 Miami-based Dacra, and land use law firm Bercow Radell Fernandez Larkin &amp; Tapanes each gave $10,000 to committees backing Higgins. Arnaud Karsenti, managing principal of 13th Floor Investments, donated $2,500.\n13th Floor Investments, Terra, Swerdlow Group and Bercow Radell also gave money to Carollo\u2019s Miami First PAC. Swerdlow contributed $50,000, 13th Floor donated $25,000, Bercow and Radell kicked in $10,000 and Terra chipped in $2,500.\nGonzalez, who testified against Carollo in the civil case brought by Fuller and Pinilla, successfully sued the city of Miami to hold the election this year, alleging city leaders violated the city charter in approving a delay of the election until next year. Six entities tied to Fuller and Pinilla donated a combined $20,000 to Gonzalez\u2019s Mission Miami PAC.\nKen Russell, a former city commissioner who was among the 13 mayoral candidates, placed third. His PAC, Breaking The Wheel, received a $10,000 donation from Miami-based CMC Group, led by Ugo Columbo.",

        "content": "A development site straddling the border between Queens and Brooklyn sold this week, but that\u2019s where the answers end and the questions begin.\nRenald Properties sold a seven-lot assemblage at the intersection of Myrtle and Wyckoff avenues for $37 million, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The 71,000-square-foot site is technically in Ridgewood, but is nearly adjacent to Bushwick.\nThe buyer was not revealed, but the price point represented one of the year\u2019s biggest deals in the area, according to the transaction brokers.\nThe site comprises 21 retail businesses, including an autobody shop, a department store and a McDonald\u2019s. The buyer would need to clear the businesses to make way for a development, in whatever form such a project takes shape.\nAnd there are options. The site allows for development up to 339,000 square feet large. Almost half of that could be put aside for residential use. But the mystery buyer has not filed any construction permits, adding to the site\u2019s intrigue. The population of the two neighborhoods have exploded in recent decades, creating a need for more housing.\nIn September, the average rent in Queens declined by a couple of cups of coffee compared to the prior month, landing at $3,051, according to\nMNS Real Estate\n. Ridgewood was in the middle of the pack in terms of prices across the borough\u2019s neighborhoods, sporting an average of $2,599 for studios and $2,857 for one-bedroom units.\nBrooklyn\n\u2019s average rent in September also fell to $3,932, down nearly 1 percent from August. Bushwick proved to be one of the borough\u2019s more affordable rental environments, recording an average of $2,638 for studios and $3,178 for one-bedroom apartments.\nAvison Young\u2019s Erik Edeen, Pat Madigan and Fritz Richter represented the seller.\n\u201cThis nearly full-block assemblage will be transformed to deliver mixed-income housing and refreshed retail space along a highly trafficked corridor as demand for housing continues to increase in Bushwick and Ridgewood,\u201d Madigan said in a statement.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Miami Beach voters propelled Mayor Steven Meiner and city commissioner Laura Dominguez to second terms, while two candidates vying for an open city commission seat are headed to a runoff.\nMeiner\ncaptured 51 percent of the vote, beating his lone challenger, city commissioner Kristen Rosen Gonzalez, by about 350 ballots, election results show. Dominguez thumped her opponent, spec home developer\nFred Karlton\n. She garnered more than 60 percent of the vote, despite a campaign by Karlton and city commissioner David Suarez to paint her as beholden to real estate developers in the city. Another city commissioner, Alex Fernandez, also won by a wide margin, capturing 84 percent of the vote against his opponent, Luidgi Mary.\nThe race for the city commission seat vacated by\nRosen Gonzalez\nwill be decided next month in a runoff between former city commission aide Monica Matteo-Salinas, who picked up 23 percent of the vote, and attorney Monique Pardo Pope, who landed in second place with 20 percent of the vote. But Pardo Pope led hotel investor Brian Ehrlich by less than a percentage point. If the margin drops to less than 0.5 percent, it would trigger an automatic recount.\nMeiner\nalso bested Rosen Gonzalez in garnering financial support from the city\u2019s real estate and hospitality industries. Players backing the mayor included Lennar co-CEO Stuart Miller, who lives in Miami Beach. Miller donated $50,000 to Meiner\u2019s political action committee Miami Beach First.\nThe PAC also racked up $25,000 from real estate investor and Miami Beach resident Michael Simkins; $20,000 from David Grutman, founder of Miami Beach-based Groot Hospitality; $18,000 from Alex Kleyner, another Miami Beach-based real estate investor; and $10,000 each from Miami Beach developer Scott Robins and New York-based Naftali Group, led by Miki Naftali.\nIn the race between\nDominguez\nand Karlton, real estate and hospitality players lined up behind the incumbent. Karlton bankrolled his own campaign by donating $150,000 to it.\nDominguez\u2019s individual campaign saw many real estate and hospitality bigwigs donating the maximum $1,000 each, including developer Michael Shvo; Jose and Diego Ardid, developers who lead Miami-based Key International; New York-based LeFrak Organization\u2019s managing director James LeFrak and a LeFrak affiliate; and two executives with Vlad Doronin\u2019s OKO Group.\nDuring the campaign, Karlton and commissioner Suarez attacked Dominguez by claiming she voted on legislation that benefitted developers that bankrolled her political action committee, Coastal Communities Matter, when she first ran in a 2022 special election. Dominguez did not raise funds through her committee for this year\u2019s election.\nIn the city commission race headed to a runoff, Ehrlich was the candidate backed by real estate and hospitality interests. His individual campaign received the maximum $1,000 donation from Arnaud Karsenti, managing principal of Coconut Grove-based development firm 13th Floor Investments, his wife Rebecca Karsenti, the Catalina Hotel at 1732 Collins Avenue, and two entities managed by Miami Beach-based real estate investor Jimmy Resnick.\nEhrlich\u2019s PAC, Miami Beach in Focus, got $25,000 from hotelier Shawn Vardi, and $5,000 from Christopher Cuomo, ex-COO of Groot Hospitality.",

The district turned out for President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election by a\nnearly 60-point margin\n.\nRehmet, an Air Force veteran and union president, is the only candidate left standing who is open to casinos in a race where Sands Casino threw millions of dollars behind a Republican who was knocked out in Tuesday\u2019s special election.\nRehmet is headed for a runoff with conservative Republican Leigh Wambsganss, who is staunchly\nanti-casino\nand spent the campaign engaging in a war of words with Republican challenger John Huffman, the former mayor of Southlake. Wambsganss had 36 percent of early voting, and Huffman had 16 percent.\nSands donated $1 million directly to Huffman\u2019s campaign and spent $2 million to advertise on his behalf.\nSands wants to build casino resorts in Texas, and it is flexing all of its muscles after buying the Dallas Mavericks and 200 acres adjacent to the Texas Stadium site in Irving in recent years.\nThe company, controlled by Miriam Adelson and Patrick Dumont, rezoned a 182-acre tract in March, though a\ncasino component was removed\nafter public backlash.\nAdelson is a major donor to President Donald Trump, giving his campaign\n$100 million\nlast year. Will the Israeli-American magnate cross party lines and endorse a pro-casino Democrat?\nWambsganss, who is chief communications officer for Christian wireless provider Patriot Mobile, is backed by Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who presides over the Texas Senate and opposes casino gambling. Wambsganss also drew nods from state Sen. Tan Parker, Tarrant County Judge Tim O\u2019Hare and state Rep. Nate Schatzline, who withdrew from the race after Wambsganss entered it.\nEven without the casino intrigue, it was an unusual ballot.\nTwo Republicans were pitted against a Democrat in the special election to replace Republican Kelly Hancock, who resigned to become acting state comptroller after holding the seat since 2013. No primary election was required.\nIf no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote, the two top vote-getters will head to a runoff election on Dec. 13.\n",

Nazarian\u2019s partners include Grammy-winning artist\nMarc Anthony\n.\nThe development team, including the Boschetti family\u2019s South Miami-based firm and Eduardo Otaola\u2019s Coral Gables-based Constellation, tapped Mauricio Umansky and Santiago Arana\u2019s\nThe Agency\nto lead sales and marketing.\nThe project will add to a growing pipeline of condo and apartment towers in Edgewater.\nNazarian\n, chairman and CEO of Beverly Hills-based sbe, told\nTRD\nin an interview that the project will fill a gap in Miami between the short-term rental-friendly condo projects that are less expensive and the $3 million-plus condos.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of luxury residential projects today. One thing we saw was there was a lack of personality and connectivity and collaboration in these towers,\u201d he said.\nCamilo Lopez, managing partner and co-CEO of Coral Gables-based\nBlack Salmon\n, said he interviewed more than 10 brands before choosing HQ.\nLopez said nearly 65 projects are in the pipeline in Greater Downtown Miami, and a majority of those are short-term rental-friendly condo projects. HQ Residences will be a traditional condo building with prices that start at $850,000 and average $1.5 million, Lopez said.\nNazarian and Lopez said the project aims to appeal to Millennials and Gen Zers, and Latino/Hispanic buyers. Units will range from one to three bedrooms and from 721 square feet to 2,074 square feet, according to a press release. The project will also have eight penthouses.\n\u201cOne of the biggest challenges in Miami is the entry level [price] is becoming extremely high,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cThis opportunity to design this product in this price point makes sense.\u201d\nThe building will mark the first residential tower branded by HQ, a hotel brand that Nazarian launched last year. Anthony will be involved in the Miami project and future branded residential developments.\n\u201c[Marc] is somebody who is the face of Miami,\u201d Nazarian said. \u201cHaving him be a validator for the largest buyers of residential, the Hispanic and Latino market, it\u2019s very exciting for me to partner with Marc and bring him into his first residential project in South Florida.\u201d\nConstruction could begin by September of next year, and it will take about 30 months to complete, Lopez said. The project will cost about $1,100 to $1,200 per square foot to build, and presales will start at about $1,400 per square foot.\nThe project\u2019s top two floors, totaling nearly 16,000 square feet, will feature amenities focused on wellness, entertainment and art, and will include a private club. The 34th floor will be designed by The Well Founder Kane Sarhan, and feature yoga, hammam, sauna, steam, plunge pools and bath house treatments; a fitness center, treatment rooms and a pool deck with lounges. The top story will have entertainment and social components, including Sofia Vergara and her son Manolo Vergara\u2019s Toma Gourmet restaurant; Jack\u2019s NYC Coffee; and Marc\u2019s, a speakeasy curated by Anthony.\nBernardo Fort Brescia\u2019s Arquitectonica is the architect, and Enzo Enea is the landscape architect. DesignAgency and Craft will design the interiors.\nNazarian worked with Related Group and its partners on a handful of South Florida branded condo projects in the last real estate cycle, which included SLS Lux, SLS Midtown and Hyde Midtown in Miami, and Hyde buildings in Hallandale Beach. Now, he said he\u2019s in talks with Black Salmon to brand additional condo projects in South Florida under the HQ flag.\n",

The asking rent was $125 per square foot.\nCurrent is relocating from RXR\u2019s 620 Sixth Avenue, where it leased about 72,000 square feet in 2023,\nCommercial Observer\nreported. A Current spokesperson declined to comment on the new lease.\nThe deal adds to Vornado\u2019s momentum at the Penn District, where chairman and CEO Steven Roth declared yesterday in an earnings call that \u201cit\u2019s clear that the tipping point \u2026 is now behind us.\u201d Penn 2 recently underwent a $750 renovation aimed at attracting blue-chip tenants. The 31-story tower is now 78 percent leased.\nCurrent Real Estate Advisors\u2019 Adam Hennick and Rob Kluge represented Current in the deal. Vornado was represented in-house by Josh Glick and Jared Silverman, along with a Cushman &amp; Wakefield team led by Bruce Mosler and Josh Kuriloff.\nThe deal comes as the office market shows signs of stabilizing and Manhattan\u2019s Class A towers are quickly filling up. The Penn Station submarket\u2019s vacancy rate was about 19 percent at the end of the third quarter, compared with the borough\u2019s overall rate of 22 percent, according to a Cushman &amp; Wakefield report.\nThe lease adds to a string of recent deals at Penn 2, as tenants continue to gravitate toward newly renovated properties near mass transit. Communications and consulting firm\nFGS Global\njust signed a 15-year lease for 80,000 square feet at Penn 2. Last summer, Verizon inked a\n200,000-square-foot lease\nwith plans to move its headquarters to the 1.8 million-square-foot building, formerly known as 2 Penn Plaza.\nOther tenants include Madison Square Garden\u2019s corporate offices,\nMajor League Soccer\nand\nUniversal Music Group\n.\n",

        "content": "One culprit of the housing crisis was overlooked in this mayoral campaign: the Landmarks Preservation Commission.\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like\nMayor-elect Zohran Mamdani\nor many other politicians are even aware of the issue.\nI\u2019m not just talking about NIMBY groups trying to get properties designated as landmarks to block housing that would replace them, or pressuring the commission to reject\nprojects that would replace parking lots\nor\ndeteriorated churches\nin historic districts.\nI\u2019m talking about the everyday struggles between property owners and the landmarks agency \u2014 the kind of fights that never make headlines.\nA recent social media post from frustrated developer Eli Lever cited an example. After waiting months for the notoriously anal landmarks agency to decide which color mortar it would allow for a brick facade, he\ntweeted a photo\nof the three choices facing the commission:\nI\u2019d probably go with the middle one. But it doesn\u2019t really matter. The point is, none of these mortar colors is going to destroy the historic look of the building. The highly trained preservationists at the LPC should have been able to pick one in 60 seconds, not 60 days.\nThe agency thinks it\u2019s protecting historic districts by being painstakingly thorough and exacting, but the opposite is true. Because it is so slow, and makes work two or three times more expensive and time-consuming, property owners often do things without getting LPC approval as required.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why if you walk around in a historic district, you often notice minor repairs obviously not done to LPC standards,\u201d Lever noted in an email to\nThe Real Deal\n. The result of the commission\u2019s overzealousness may well be less historic preservation, not more.\nBut the bigger problem for New Yorkers seeking affordability \u2014 like Mamdani \u2014 is that by making construction and renovation more expensive, the city ends up with less housing than it would otherwise have. That\u2019s a basic rule of economics.\nI asked Lever if it would have been cheaper to just pick a mortar color and proceed without the agency\u2019s blessing, paying a fine as needed. Not an option, he said. For renovations requiring building permits, LPC approval is essential.\n\u201cThis is where the wait can be a killer, but there isn\u2019t really a choice,\u201d Lever said. \u201cDoing a job without permits opens up a whole host of issues, over and above the LPC violation.\u201d\nThe people hired by Landmarks to enforce its standards have a lot of expertise about what buildings looked like a century or two ago, or at least the motivation to research and apply 19th-century standards to today\u2019s owners and contractors.\nWhat they appear to lack is any appreciation of how their decisions \u2014 and the time it takes to make them \u2014 affect the real estate industry and everyday New Yorkers.\nStaffers are surely aware that\nlandmarking has its critics\n. But art history majors with graduate degrees in historic preservation inevitably view applications through the lens of their education, not think-tank reports and the odd online gripe by a developer. \u201cPreservationists really struggle with change,\u201d a former LPC staffer\ntold Brooklyn Magazine\n.\nI\u2019m not saying the city should trash the landmarks system, although there is a case to be made for that. I am saying that when choices involve benefits and costs, both should be considered.\nIt can\u2019t just be \u201cit costs what it costs\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019ll take as long as we need to make a decision.\u201d\nI would suggest the City Council apply a builder\u2019s remedy to Landmarks: If the agency doesn\u2019t decide on an application in X number of days, it is automatically approved. I guarantee that timely decisions would immediately become the norm. LPC would lobby for more staff but would ultimately adjust its methods to meet the deadlines.\nMy second reform would be to stop designating new historic districts. We have enough.\nBy definition, any buildings left standing long enough become historic. Taken to its logical conclusion, the entire city will eventually be landmarked.\nNew York is not Pompeii. The city should not be frozen in time.\nTo see the effects of landmarking on housing development, one need only look at the\nSoho/Noho rezoning\nof 2021.\nIt was supposed to create thousands of units. But developers are\navoiding the historic portion\nof the rezoned area as if it were a toxic waste dump. Building there would mean competing with projects that cost less \u2014 an uphill, if not futile, battle.\nSome buyers and renters will pay extra to be in a new development built to LPC\u2019s specifications, but perhaps not enough to make a project pencil out. And keep in mind that affordable units, which are required in rezoned areas and in 485x projects, cannot charge a premium.\nWe are leaving housing on the table \u2014 in high-opportunity neighborhoods, no less.\nLandmarking was a nice idea, but it has reached the point of diminishing returns. The benefits of more landmarking do not outweigh the drawbacks. The main thing Landmarks is preserving now is the housing shortage.\nAbout 20 percent of Manhattan, which has the city\u2019s densest zoning and the most investment in transit, is now subject to the strict scrutiny of the LPC. Continuing this way would be a historic mistake.\n",

The 1.3 million-square-foot project will include a 212-key hotel, spa, fine dining restaurants with 915 seats and more.\nIn addition to assembling land for a massive residential compound in Palm Beach, the Daytona Beach native purchased homes in Miami and Miami Beach.\nThe Terminal Island marina project, designed by BMA Architects, will include a gatehouse at the entrance of the marina with security offices and an operations center with a repair shop and marina staff offices.\nGriffin\u2019s attorney, Neisen Kasdin, co-managing partner of Akerman\u2019s Miami office, agreed to a handful of conditions on behalf of his client.\nBoard members raised concerns about the effect that special events held at the marina pavilion will have on traffic and noise, especially with the U.S. Coast Guard nearby.\nTuesday\u2019s approval requires Coast Guard consent for special events and progress reports every two years. All parking has to be self-contained on Terminal Island. Griffin can\u2019t host any special events until a temporary certificate of occupancy is issued. And if ownership of the property changes hands, any future owner has to return to the board.\nThe planning board also approved a comprehensive plan amendment and floor area ratio (FAR) preservation incentive within the Faena District that will allow billionaires Vlad Doronin and Len Blavatnik to add 5,000 square feet of floor area ratio (FAR) to the hotel component of\nAman Miami Beach\n, so that the developer can take advantage of empty space and make it mechanical space.\nDoronin\u2019s Miami-based OKO Group is the developer, and Blavatnik\u2019s New York-based Access Industries is backing the oceanfront project at 3425 Collins Avenue.\nIt will include a 22-unit Aman-branded condominium in a new 18-story building, and the 56-key Aman hotel in the historic Versailles structure, which is currently a shell.\nIn August, an affiliate of New York-based Golden Tree Asset Management provided $85 million in mezzanine financing, adding to the\n$277 million-plus in debt\nprovided by Little Rock, Arkansas-based Bank OZK in 2020 and 2023. Vertical construction began around the same time and the project is now expected to be completed in 2027, and construction has been moving quickly since August, Kasdin said at Tuesday\u2019s meeting. He is also representing the Aman development team.\n\u201cConstruction is progressing rapidly at this point\u2026 You\u2019ll see the residential tower is starting to come above ground. We\u2019re going to be pouring the fifth floor before Thanksgiving, and then it will continue to top out into the new year,\u201d Kasdin said.\n",

Designs are being handled by Bassenian Legoni with KFA Architecture serving as architect and Agency Artifact as landscape architect.\nSince acquiring the property more than a decade ago,\nCIM Group\nhas sought to redevelop two of the blocks at Wilshire Boulevard and Mullen Avenue with condominiums and single-family homes.

Greene Custom Builders in 2022, is tucked within the north suburban enclave known for its large lots and strong school district. The home is being marketed quietly \u2014 it\u2019s available only on a private agents\u2019 network, with showings set to begin Nov. 10.\nListing agent Jeff Ohm has not commented publicly. The asking price for the home at 305 Briarwood Lane amounts to about $567 per square foot.\nChicago Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren and his wife, Greta, bought a similarly proportioned five-bedroom mansion in\nLake Forest\nthis summer for $2.25 million.\nThe Poles\u2019 two-story five-bedroom, five-and-a-half-bath property is designed in a modern farmhouse style. Interiors feature a great room with a fireplace, a study with custom built-ins, and a kitchen with an oversized island, breakfast area and walk-in pantry. A mudroom, three-seasons room, and primary suite with sitting area and oversized closet round out the main living spaces.\nThe finished lower level adds a layer of amenities \u2014 an exercise room, game area, family room with built-in shelving and a fireplace, and a custom bar.

        "content": "More losses\nat Hudson Pacific Properties.\nThe Los Angeles-based real estate investment trust\nreported\na loss of $136.5 million in the third quarter compared to $97.9 million a year earlier. That put losses for the nine months ending Sept. 30 at $294.3 million.\nThe office and studio investor blamed the slump on the deconsolidation of\nSunset Glenoaks\n, a $200 million purpose-built studio developed by Hudson Pacific Properties in partnership with Blackstone. It\u2019s only 8 percent leased after being delivered last year.\nOffice and studio revenues decreased in the third quarter compared to a year ago, too, so total revenues came out to $186.6 million compared to $200.4 million a year ago, which the company said was due to lower office occupancy and depreciated asset sales.\nWhen it comes to its balance sheet, Hudson Pacific said it is in no rush to sell and has no maturities until the second half of next year. However, that next maturity is a big one \u2014 the commercial mortgage-backed securities debt connected to its Hollywood Media portfolio, which has a more than $1 billion outstanding balance.\nThe company inked 515,000 square feet of leases in the third quarter, which amounts to 1.7 million square feet year to date. The deals included a 106,000-square-foot lease with an artificial intelligence company at its Page Mill Center offices in Palo Alto. The company said this was its best year-to-date leasing performance since 2019, before the pandemic.\n\u201cLeasing, leasing, and then more leasing,\u201d Hudson Pacific chairman and chief executive Victor Coleman said on an earnings call Wednesday morning when discussing the path ahead.\nAbout 80 percent of third quarter leasing activity occurred at the company\u2019s Bay Area assets, mostly via technology and artificial intelligence tenants, which led Coleman to tout evidence of an office recovery on the West Coast.\nBut about a million square feet of leases are set to expire next year, affecting 8 percent of its portfolio.\nThe company\u2019s office portfolio is picking up as the San Francisco technology world booms. Meanwhile, studios are dragging as the Los Angeles TV and film production industry stalls.\nTwenty-two of the company\u2019s 40 office holdings are in the Bay Area; almost all of its studios are in L.A. Coleman said he sees a return in studio demand, noting California\u2019s recent tax credit expansion that has revealed some early promise in incentivising projects.\nShares rose during the earnings call, so it seems investors liked what they heard despite the millions in losses the company posted.\n",

Building a typical affordable housing unit in San\u202fFrancisco has been reported at about $377,000 per unit, or roughly $470,000 when land and financing costs are included. Some projects in the city have been far more expensive, with costs reaching up to\n$1.2\u202fmillion per unit\n.\nAt that high rate, the foundation could build 108,000 units with its $130 billion. At $470,000 per unit, it could pay for 276,000 units. The city is trying to erase an 82,000-unit shortage.\nOpenAI has pledged to use the money to fund research to treat and cure diseases and to implement guardrails against AI. Tackling wealth inequality and building isn\u2019t a part of the plan.\n\u201cIf we could somehow make it so that you could graduate from school and buy a home and start your family on a normal salary, that would have a huge positive impact on society,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think either of us can make that happen.\u201d\nThe growth of AI firms like OpenAI and the need for employees have\ndriven up housing demand\n\u2014\nand rents\n\u2014 in the city.\nSan Francisco must meet its state-mandated requirement of building at least 82,069 housing units by 2031 as part of its\nhousing element\n.

That represented a $50,000 premium on the Tudor-style residence\u2019s last asking price.\nThe deal for the 2.2-acre, 5,000-square-foot home breaks down to $870 per square foot. There are six bedrooms and four-and-a-half bathrooms, as well as a 20-by-50-foot heated gunite pool, a hot tub and a brick patio.\nThe deal could be a disappointment for C.K. He listed the property for nearly $8 million last September before knocking down the asking price in August to $4.3 million; the home went under contract that same month and the deal closed on Halloween.\nThe waterfront estate once welcomed esteemed guests, including presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William McKinley and sports superstar Babe Ruth. The home includes a deepwater dock on West Neck Creek with room for multiple boats.\nC.K. purchased the property in 2014 for $2.44 million, spending the next decade restoring and modernizing the home. Updates included central air conditioning, upgraded heating and insulation for more energy efficiency. The comedian also made notable changes to the chef\u2019s kitchen and added a butler\u2019s pantry.\nCarl Gambino and Marco Maida of The Gambino Group at Compass had the listing.\nIn late 2022, C.K. sold his Greenwich Village co-op at 101 West 12th Street for\n$1.8 million\n. He\nbought the co-op\nin 2016 for $2.45 million, $55,000 above the asking price. He resigned himself to a loss on the apartment when he\nslashed the asking price\nby 25 percent, dropping it to $1.9 million from its $2.5 million initial ask.\nThe comedian is best known for his comedy series, \u201cLouie,\u201d which aired on FX for five seasons.\nC.K. issued a statement in 2017 confirming allegations of sexual misconduct from multiple women. Despite the admission, he resurfaced on the comedy circuit a year later and recently performed at the controversial Riyadh Comedy Festival.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

CBRE\u2019s total third-quarter revenue was $10.2 billion.\nThis is at least the second notable acquisition of the year for CBRE.\nAt the beginning of 2025, the firm agreed to\nacquire\nthe remaining 60 percent stake of coworking company Industrious several years after an initial investment.

It\u2019s a great location. North Beach is undergoing a crazy transformation.\u201d\nThe seller, an affiliate of Royal Oak, Michigan-based Calvin Gaeta Development Company, paid $855,000 for the two parcels in 1986, records show.\nBergman, Opal Realty NY, led by Charles Hoffman, and The Scharf Group, led by Glenn Scharf, won approval last year from the city of Miami Beach to build two new five-story buildings spanning 90,000 square feet that will entail 12,000 square feet of ground-floor retail and 40,000 square feet of offices, city records show. The project will also restore and incorporate a historic retail building at 7410 Collins Avenue currently leased to CVS.\nIn addition, the joint venture is planning to include residential units, but the partnership has not decided if they will be units for sale or rent, a spokesperson said.\nThe joint venture plans to break ground next year, the release states.\nFounded in 2012, Opal Realty NY has $4 billion in commercial real estate assets under management, according to the firm\u2019s website. The Scharf Group is a family office founded in 1946.\nSince last year, Benmark Capital provided $13.6 million in financing for\nLa Baia North\n, the second phase of a condominium project in Bay Harbor Islands being developed by The Eichner family\u2019s Continuum Company.\nNorth Beach is experiencing a wave of new projects. Lefferts is planning four condominiums in the neighborhood. In March, the firm began closings for\n72 Park\n, a 22-story tower with 206 short-term rental-friendly units. Lefferts is also developing the 126-unit Palm Miami Beach Residences, the 134-unit 72 Carlyle and an unnamed 36-unit boutique condominium in North Beach.\nNorthlink Capital is also planning a short-term rental-friendly condominium in North Beach.

While overall countywide collections have largely rebounded from early shortfalls, rates of payment in many\nsouth suburban towns\nremain \u201cperilously low,\u201d the office found.\nHarvey billed $57.9 million in taxes last year but collected only $33.75 million \u2014 a 58.29 percent rate \u2014 leaving more than $24 million unpaid.\nOnly Ford Heights, at 39 percent, and Robbins, at 57 percent, fared worse.\nNeighboring suburbs\nsuch as\nDolton\n, Chicago Heights and Calumet City also collected below 85 percent of what they were owed. A strong collection rate is around 95 percent, according to the Civic Federation.\nThe south suburbs have been reeling from steep tax hikes and lagging payments. Median tax bills jumped nearly 20 percent in 2023, the largest increase in almost three decades. That spike, combined with years of disinvestment, has left homeowners and businesses struggling to keep up \u2014 and city governments starved for the revenue they depend on.\nHarvey\u2019s government is now in partial shutdown, having furloughed more than 40 percent of its staff \u2014 including portions of its police, fire and public works departments \u2014 as it struggles to meet payroll.\nComplicating the issue is the questionable legality of Cook County\u2019s tax-lien sale practices. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled against the practice, but Illinois\nhasn\u2019t changed its laws\naround it. The conflict\nbrought tax sales to a standstill\nin Cook County and drew a\nclass-action lawsuit\n.\nHarvey Mayor Christopher Clark said at a recent City Council meeting that unpaid property taxes are a central reason the city is in crisis. Last month, Harvey\u2019s city council voted to seek relief under Illinois\u2019 Financially Distressed Cities Act, a designation previously reserved for East St. Louis.\n\u201cThe reason why the collection rate is so low is because of years of disinvestment,\u201d Clark said. \u201cOur high tax rate only makes things worse. It\u2019s a diminishing return.\u201d\nThe treasurer\u2019s report said Harvey leads all\nCook County suburbs\nin tax-delinquent properties \u2014 with more than 3,100 homes and 1,885 vacant lots owing back taxes.\nBusinesses are also lagging: 662 commercial properties owe roughly $9.2 million. Schools, city services and other taxing bodies in Harvey are owed $312.4 million in total unpaid taxes, with another $441 million in accumulated interest over two decades.\nClark has tried to compel payments by blocking access to parking lots at delinquent properties and denying business licenses, a tactic some city officials say has backfired.\n\u201cThe city is spending more time fighting entities that owe back taxes than finding equitable solutions,\u201d said Alderman Colby Chapman, who added that the problem is compounded by thousands of abandoned homes across the city.\nThe city\u2019s tax rate ranks among the highest in the county, while its collections rank among the lowest, meeting the criteria for state financial intervention.\n\u201cIt confirms why we\u2019re asking for help,\u201d Clark said. \u201cYou just can\u2019t run a city with these kinds of numbers and still expect to serve your citizens.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Texas homeowners and business owners are set for sweeping property tax relief after voters approved a pair of\nconstitutional amendments\naimed at easing one of the state\u2019s most persistent financial burdens.\nThe measures, passed Tuesday, raise the homestead exemption for school district taxes and expand\ntax breaks\nfor business inventory \u2014 changes that could reshape local revenue streams across the state, the Texas Tribune\nreported\n.\nThe centerpiece of the package increases the state\u2019s homestead exemption \u2014 the portion of a home\u2019s value shielded from school property taxes \u2014 from $100,000 to $140,000. That translates to roughly $490 in annual savings for the owner of a typical $302,000 Texas home, according to the outlet.\nSeniors and homeowners with disabilities will see even larger cuts, following voter approval of a separate measure targeting those groups.\nBusinesses also won big. Voters approved a state constitutional amendment exempting up to $125,000 of a company\u2019s inventory from property taxes levied by school districts, cities and counties. Supporters argued the change will ease pressure on small and midsize firms, which have struggled with rising valuations and tight margins in recent years.\n\u201cThere is an absolute recognition of the need to provide property tax cuts for homeowners and business owners,\u201d said state\nSen. Paul Bettencourt\n, the Houston Republican who led the push. \u201cThe public embraces the idea that increasing homestead exemptions is a way to keep people in their homes and to lower their property tax bills.\u201d\nThe Texas plan mirrors efforts in other GOP-led states such as Iowa, Florida and Georgia to cut property taxes amid rising home values. Those states pursued similar strategies, while California and Colorado are exploring different approaches to easing the tax burden on homeowners, such as annual increase caps.\nThe\nstate\nhas committed an estimated $51 billion over the next two years to offset those cuts, using surplus funds to reduce school district tax rates and backfill revenue lost to exemptions.\nBut some fiscal analysts warn that tying the changes to the state constitution could limit future flexibility if revenues dip. Unlike temporary rate adjustments, these tax breaks can\u2019t be rolled back without another statewide vote \u2014 meaning lawmakers would need to cut other spending if the budget tightens.\nFor cities and counties, the impact could be even sharper. While the state will cover lost school district revenue, local governments that tax business inventories will have to raise rates or pare down budgets to fill the gap.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "New York City\u2019s mayoral race is officially over \u2014 and despite\ndire predictions from the industry\n, some residential players are chiming in with a clear consensus: don\u2019t believe the hype.\nDemocratic nominee Zohran Mamdani won\nthe city\u2019s top post\non Tuesday, besting Independent candidate, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. The 34-year-old Assemblymember from Queens ran on, among other policies, the promise of freezing rents for stabilized housing and raising taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers.\nLeading up to the election, some real estate players warned that a Mamdani victory could\nspark an outflow\nof high-earning residents over concerns of a potential tax hike and public safety issues arising from his policies.\nBrokers in South Florida and suburban New York markets further sounded the alarm bells in headlines and even in advertisements. Top Miami broker Dina Goldentayer\ntook out a billboard\nin Times Square with the #MoveToMiami.\nBut now that the results are in, brokers in the city are saying the panic is\nlargely overrated\n.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got three kids in private school, two of whom are going through applications. Everyone\u2019s leaving? I wish. Not everyone\u2019s leaving,\u201d said Brown Harris Stevens\u2019 Lisa Simonsen. \u201cFew people will leave a place they call home because of a new mayor. The people who are leaving were probably going anyway.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear any more nonsense\nfrom Florida brokers\n,\u201d said Serhant\u2019s Ravi Kantha.\nSerhant\u2019s Peter Zaitzeff argued that homeowners in the city will weigh other factors like their cheap debt over concerns about a Mamdani mayoralty.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I have people coming to me saying, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m ready to list,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIf anything, we\u2019re still in a period where people are locked into their 2 percent rates that they got in Covid.\u201d\nAnd those wealthy enough to not have to factor in financing costs are likely already spending more than half their time outside the city, according to Compass\u2019 Leonard Steinberg.\n\u201cChances are [the billionaire class] domiciled elsewhere,\u201d Steinberg said. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t domicile elsewhere, they probably have trusts and all sorts of federal laws that they use to minimize their exposure from a taxation perspective.\u201d\nSteinberg added that his clients are most concerned about public safety, a hot talking point in the run-up to the election. Democratic socialist Mamdani was criticized for previous calls to \u201cdefund the police,\u201d but has apologized for the statement. However, Mamdani\u2019s opponents claim some of his proposals, such as one calling for social workers to respond to mental health crises instead of police, could be ineffective.\nSteinberg encouraged those fearful of a spike in crime to consider the numbers before spreading concerns.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had people say, like, \u2018I can\u2019t come to New York. Everyone is being pushed in front of the subway and dying,\u2019\u201d Steinberg said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018have you looked at the data?\u2019\u201d\nWhile some point to Mamdani\u2019s tax-the-rich proposals as potential deterrents for the luxury market, Douglas Elliman\u2019s Frances Katzen said high-net-worth buyers don\u2019t seem to be too concerned about their impact just yet.\n\u201cIf these guys are taking the biggest hit, why are they buying?\u201d she said.\nKatzen pointed to what she called \u201csome of the most stratospheric trades\u201d since Mamdani won the Democratic primary in June, including a buyer\nsigning a contract\nto purchase a penthouse at 140 Jane Street, asking $88 million.\n\u201cThe fact pattern doesn\u2019t fit the narrative,\u201d she said.\nThough agents jumped to minimize the doomsday scenario laid out in earlier headlines, they also emphasized that the results weren\u2019t the outcome most in the industry had hoped for.\nStarr Associates\u2019 Shaun Pappas, an attorney who works with developers and buyers, said his clients are adopting a \u201cwait-and-see approach.\u201d\n\u201cThe rhetoric back and forth has just become so extreme on both sides, it\u2019s difficult to ascertain what the actual vision is,\u201d Pappas said. \u201cThings have been walked back so much on the mayor-elect side,\u201d he added, pointing to\nMamdani\u2019s about-face\non certain topics, such as his attitude toward working with private developers.\nBlowback will likely only be limited to those already in a tough spot, Kantha said, such as developers trying to raise capital for a project in a less desirable location.\n\u201cPrime products in prime locations are still going to sell,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one\u2019s thinking, \u2018Oh wow,\nnow the Flatiron is doomed\n.\u2019\u201d\nThe uncertainty about the Mamdani administration will likely make its way into negotiations, Kantha added, with some buyers attempting to pressure sellers into agreeing to offers before the new mayor takes office or has time to start making significant changes.\n\u201cOver the next few weeks, you\u2019ll hear anecdotes about people negotiating over Mamdani fears,\u201d Kantha said. \u201cBut if I could tell sellers one thing, it\u2019s don\u2019t capitulate to that,\u201d he added, citing other economic factors such as lower than expected inflation, a booming stock market and falling interest rates as signs that the macro economy is stronger than mayoral concerns.\nDespite their misgivings, some in the industry remain optimistic.\n\u201cI want to give the guy a chance,\u201d said BHS CEO Bess Freedman. \u201cHe wants to achieve great things and make people\u2019s lives better, and I respect that.\u201d\nAs election results started rolling in on Tuesday night, Freedman said that her phone was \u201cnonstop blowing up\u201d with \u201ca lot of \u2018U\u2019 \u2018G\u2019 \u2018H\u2019\u201d and \u201cGod help us.\u201d\nHowever, she added, only time will tell whether some of the industry\u2019s most catastrophic predictions would come true.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can make a decision without him performing yet,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to fight with the army you get, not the one you want. If he\u2019s horrible and terrible, we\u2019ll talk again.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Sam Nazarian sees Miami as a city at the highest echelons of real estate, largely due to the in-migration of recent years. But growing pains linger.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go backwards. Miami now is one of the most important, if not the most important, cities in the world today, but there are different things that drive this,\u201d said hospitality mogul Nazarian, founder of sbe, whose other holdings include C3 restaurant group.\nNazarian\nspoke with\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s Editor in Chief Stuart Elliott at\nTRD\u2019s\nMiami Real Estate Forum 2025 on Wednesday, marking the first panel that kicked off the two-day event at Mana Wynwood. The event followed Zohran Mamdani\u2019s mayoral win in New York on Tuesday.\nGenerally, Mamdani\u2019s promise to freeze rents on rent-stabilized buildings and increase corporate and income taxes, plus his anti-Israel stance, are expected to prompt another influx of New Yorkers to Miami. Yet, Nazarian \u2013\u2013 who said he disagrees with Mamdani\u2019s philosophy and politics, but found that his campaign \u201chit a chord for the next generation\u201d \u2013\u2013 pointed out other factors that drive people\u2019s decisions to leave home and move.\nMiami\u2019s infrastructure may not be ready for another growth spurt, he said, citing long-present issues such as traffic and the lack of private schools. The city also is experiencing new restaurant openings, which also \u201cis not easy to scale so quickly,\u201d including to train staff.\nNazarian isn\u2019t worried about New York developers coming in and posing competition for Miami\u2019s long-established names in real estate, including Terra and Related Group. Building in the Magic City isn\u2019t easy, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to understand the politics of infrastructure \u2026 permitting, zoning inspections, contractors,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not for the faint of heart to be building down here\u201d in South Florida.\nMiami\u2019s Tuesday mayoral election is headed to a runoff, and Nazarian praised outgoing Mayor Francis Suarez, adding he\u2019s part of a crop of South Florida politicians who \u201cgive you the optimism to get shit done.\u201d\nRegardless of whether Mamdani\u2019s win prompts a few more billionaires to move south, \u201cthe biggest buyer in South Florida is the Hispanic and Latino market,\u201d he said.\nNazarian\u2019s career has spanned all facets of the industry. In the 1990s, Nazarian started out as a nightlife king in Los Angeles, where he opened his first club at 26, and at one point had 13 nightclubs. As founder of sbe, a hotel and restaurant group based in Beverly Hills, California, Nazarian at one point controlled preeminent brands including Mondrian, Delano, Hyde. He also launched\nSLS Hotels\n, opening SLS hotels in Beverly Hills, Miami and Las Vegas.\nNazarian sold his stake in the hotel side of the business in 2020 for\n$850 million\nto French firm Accor and at the same time increased his ownership in sbe\u2019s ghost kitchens and C3, owner of Umami Burger.\nAside from restaurants, his most recent ventures are in \u201cwellness and longevity,\u201d as the 50-year-old praised the use of preventative medicine, saying it saved him from a potential brain aneurysm.\nIn Miami, Nazarian\u2019s HQ Hotels &amp; Residences by sbe will brand Black Salmon, the Boschetti Group and Constellation Group\u2019s planned\n35-story, 229-unit condo\nproject at 422 Northeast 29th Street in Miami\u2019s Edgewater. Marc Anthony, whose house in LA Nazarian once bought, is a partner in HQ brands.\n\u201cI always knew why I got into nightclubs and restaurants: To have the credibility to operate a lifestyle hotel,\u201d said Nazarian, who launched SLS Hotels in the early 2000s, opening SLS-branded hotels in Beverly Hills, Miami and Las Vegas. \u201cIf you are going to be a lifestyle guy, you need to understand the parts that make up the lifestyle. You have to be great at everything.\u201d",

Berkadia\u2019s Scott Wadler and Alec Fox arranged the financing.\nDezer launched sales of the planned 61-story, 216-unit tower at 18401 Collins Avenue in 2022. The project is more than 50 percent presold, according to the release. Remaining units start at $5.8 million and the two penthouses are asking $37.5 million each.\nSieger Suarez Architects is designing the Bentley Motors-branded tower. Foundation work is nearly completed, and the building is expected to be completed in 2028.\nBentley Residences will be the second luxury condo tower that Dezer builds with his patented Dezervator car elevator, following the completion of Porsche Design Tower in 2019. Bentley will feature amenities totaling 20,000 square feet with a whiskey bar, cigar lounge, home theater, wellness spa, oceanfront pool deck and a private restaurant by chef Todd English. Each condo will have a three- or four-car garage with charging stations for electric vehicles.\nIn 2022, Dezer secured a\n$40 million predevelopment loan\nfor the planned 749-foot tower from City National Bank of Florida.\nA Dezer affiliate bought the 3.6 acre property, which included a five-story Wyndham-branded hotel, for $6.8 million in 1996, records show. It has been torn down.\nThe latest loan marks a major milestone for the development, and adds to a stream of large construction loans to close in recent weeks across South Florida, despite a challenging debt environment.\nYtech this week secured a\n$565 million construction loan\nfor its 70-story, 195-unit luxury condo tower, The Residences at 1428 Brickell. J.P. Morgan is the senior lender.\nAlso this week, Namdar Group\nsecured $460 million\nin bridge and construction loans from Slate Property Group\u2019s Scale Lending for a nearly 1,400-unit, two-tower apartment project in downtown Miami. Both financing packages were announced this week.\nIn June, billionaire Related Ross Chairman and CEO Steve Ross\nsecured $600 million in financing\nfor his planned South Flagler House condo project in West Palm Beach. Bank OZK is the senior lender.\n",

The property was built in 1995 and originally housed liquor distributor Young\u2019s Market Company before Paper Mart reportedly paid $22.2 million for the building in 2010.\nPaper Mart owner Frick Family Properties signed a 12-month sale-leaseback with the buyers as part of the deal. The packaging company, which occupies the entire building, hasn\u2019t disclosed where it plans to move after its lease ends.\nThe Lincoln and Artemis joint venture plans to upgrade the facility over the next year before bringing it to market for lease after Paper Mart\u2019s eventual exit.\nThe deal expands Lincoln\u2019s Orange County industrial portfolio, which includes the Flight creative office campus in\nTustin\nand more than 14 million square feet of local commercial space under its management.\nThe Paper Mart property buy is Lincoln\u2019s biggest local buy since its acquisition of the Square on Main office campus in Orange three years ago\n.\nThe deal also marks the first time in over a decade that Lincoln has joined forces with Artemis.\nPaper Mart\u2019s trade is the latest Orange County sale from owner-users.\nGovernment consulting agency HdL Companies recently sold an 80,000-square-foot multitenant office building in\nBrea\nto a Monterey Bay-based investor; the company previously owned the building at 120 South State College Boulevard and uses it as its headquarters alongside other tenants. HdL reportedly paid $23 million for the offices in 2019.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "One of San Francisco\u2019s most prominent developers has been tasked with reimagining\nMacy\u2019s Union Square flagship\n.\nMacy\u2019s, Incorporated, which also owns Bloomingdale\u2019s, formed a joint venture with\nTMG Partners\n, headed by veteran developer Michael Covarrubias, to explore a redevelopment of the retailer\u2019s 600,000-square-foot store at 170 O\u2019Farrell Street, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. Macy\u2019s\nannounced the closure\nof the store last year, but it has remained open as a buyer of the site has yet to emerge.\nAs part of the venture, TMG will work with Macy\u2019s to study potential new uses for the property, including adaptive reuse and upgrades that would cater to downtown\u2019s workers, residents and visitors.\nThe discussions are still in their early stages, and no closing date for the store has been set.\nThe partnership with TMG is \u201cpart of Macy\u2019s ongoing strategy to evaluate compelling options for its real estate portfolio,\u201d Macy\u2019s said in a statement. Details on potential plans and next steps for the Union Square site are forthcoming, according to the Chronicle.\n\u201cWe are wildly excited,\u201d Covarrubias, a developer with four decades of real estate experience, said about the deal. He noted that his team sees great potential \u201cfor that building, in that place, at this time,\u201d though Macy\u2019s and TMG are still figuring out the \u201cright choice of uses\u201d for the property.\n\u201cThere are a lot of creative things that we have been thinking about,\u201d Covarrubias said, adding, \u201cHousing is important for downtown.\u201d Also, TMG could take advantage of the site\u2019s current zoning and proceed with commercial uses like offices, laboratories and institutional space, retail, light industrial, arts and entertainment.\nUnion Square has seen several stores close their doors since the pandemic, but the area could be in the midst of a comeback. Uniqlo, which vacated a large space there during the pandemic, is\nmoving back into a new spot\nnearby. Zara is\ngearing up to open a new flagship\ndown the street from its previously closed location.\nTMG\u2019s efforts with the Macy\u2019s complex aren\u2019t TMG\u2019s only project aiming to breathe new life into downtown. The developer is in the process of\nbuying the Metreon mall\n, and in September, the San Francisco-based firm purchased a historic office building at\n149 New Montgomery St\nreet that it plans to revamp for tech and artificial intelligence tenants.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s an appeals board, not a magic wand.\nThe\nbig news\nTuesday was that Zohran Mamdani will be New York City\u2019s next mayor.\nThe other big news was that member deference, the tradition of the City Council voting based on the opinion of the local member on land use issues, is dead.\nExcept, it isn\u2019t\ncompletely\ndead.\nVoters approved three ballot measures that weaken the City Council\u2019s hold on certain housing project approvals.\nOne of the proposals creates housing fast-track options that bypass City Council approval. Another creates a condensed review process for \u201cmodest\u201d housing projects that does the same. Those proposals straightforwardly free projects from member deference, at least more so than the third.\nThe third proposal creates a three-person appeals board, consisting of the mayor, City Council speaker and appropriate borough president, that can reverse the City Council\u2019s rejection of a project that would result in affordable housing.\nThe appeals board could mean some developers will pursue projects in districts that they otherwise would have avoided due to opposition from the local council member. But success in those districts would rely on winning over two out of three of the people on the appeals board. The three members of the appeals board most likely aren\u2019t going to rubber-stamp projects \u2014\u00a0not if they want to have a good relationship with individual members, not to mention the Council at large.\nPerhaps some City Council members will be given more deference by the appeals board than others. But with this dynamic, it seems like it is in the best interest of the developer and local Council member to reach an agreement rather than bring the appeals board into the fray.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think two of the three parties on the appeals board are going to make these decisions lightly,\u201d Rachel Fee, president of the New York Housing Conference, told me recently.\nWe won\u2019t know for sure until these changes are implemented. Developer Bruce Teitelbaum cautioned today that these changes aren\u2019t a \u201csilver bullet.\u201d\nKeep an eye out for more coverage on these ballot measures this week!\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: I still want to hear from you about the election! Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nVornado Realty Trust is in talks with prospective tenants to anchor its tower that is planned for the former Hotel Pennsylvania site, known as Penn 15,\nmy colleague Elizabeth Cryan reports\n. Perhaps one of the tenants will take the plunge if Vornado rebrands the tower (including, or exclusively, its name)?\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani on Wednesday announced who will lead his transition team. Grace Bonilla, president and CEO of United Way of New York City; Melanie Hartzog, president and CEO of the nonprofit New York Foundling; Lina Khan, former Federal Trade Commission chair; and Maria Torres-Springer, former First Deputy Mayor, will serve as transition co-chairs.\u00a0 Elana Leopold, a political strategist, will serve as executive director of the transition team.\n\u2014\nDemocratic candidate Shirley Aldebol ousted Republican incumbent Council member Kristy Marmorato, who represents Throgs Neck, Pelham Bay, Morris Park and City Island in the Bronx\n,\nGothamist reports\n. Marmorato was the sole Republican Council member in the Bronx.\n\u2014\nICYMI, New Jersey\nelected\nDemocratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill as its next governor.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$16.8 million\nfor a 6,200-square-foot, single-family home at 48 East 81st Street on the Upper East Side. Sarah Williams and Peter Stack of Societe Real Estate\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$17.1 million\nfor three properties in Kingsbridge. They include 5760-5790 Broadway and 3632 Kingsbridge Avenue, which is across the street. Fedricson Equities sold the properties to an LLC tied to Leonid Yevdayev.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$11.9 million\nfor a nine-room co-op unit at 19 East 72nd Street in Lenox Hill. Serena Boardman with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 45,195-square-foot, 54-unit project at 913 Pierce Avenue in Morris Park. Victor Han filed the permit on behalf of Vlash Parubi.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "For some in the real estate industry, their worst fears became a reality Tuesday night.\nA Democratic socialist is heading to Gracie Mansion.\nIn his victory speech, Zohran Mamdani said he would go after bad landlords, describing them as proteges of President Donald Trump. He doubled down on his pledge to freeze rents for stabilized tenants, and alluded to his plans to raise taxes for the state\u2019s wealthiest.\n\u201cWe will hold bad landlords to account because the Donald Trumps of our city have grown far too comfortable taking advantage of their tenants,\u201d he said Tuesday night to a crowd at the Brooklyn Paramount. \u201cWe will put an end to the culture of corruption that has allowed billionaires like Trump to evade taxation and exploit tax rates.\u201d\nReal estate professionals donated millions to promote Andrew Cuomo over Mamdani. But now, in the aftermath of the latter\u2019s victory, some are focused \u2014\u00a0at least publicly \u2014 on areas where they agree with the young mayor-elect. That includes increasing the city\u2019s housing supply.\n\u201cIt would be foolish to reject everything carte blanche,\u201d said Jason Haber, a broker with Compass who helped lead fundraising for a political action committee that supported Cuomo and opposed Mamdani.\nIndustry players who spoke to\nThe Real Deal\nrepeatedly acknowledged that Mamdani\u2019s emphasis on affordability resonated with New Yorkers.\n\u201cHe perfectly diagnosed the problem, but it\u2019s the prescription that we in the industry disagree with,\u201d Haber said, pointing to Mamdani\u2019s proposals to freeze rents and raise corporate taxes.\nHe added, \u201cThe fight goes on for what we believe in, what we think is right for the city.\u201d\nThat fight could play out next year.\n\u201cI think the governors\u2019 race just became the most important race in this city,\u201d said Bob Knakal, CEO of BK Real Estate Advisors.\nTo pay for his ambitious agenda, Mamdani has proposed raising taxes on those earning more than $1 million and increasing the corporate tax rate, both of which will require state action. Gov. Kathy Hochul has resisted tax increases, even as Democratic leaders in the state legislature repeatedly proposed hikes.\nCea Weaver, director of the New York State Tenant Bloc, indicated that her organization is already looking ahead to next year\u2019s races.\n\u201cWe know landlords and developers will throw everything they have to stop us. They can go ahead and try,\u201d Weaver said in a statement. \u201cWe are ready to freeze the rent with the mayor-elect and continue this momentum into next year\u2019s statewide races.\u201d\nLeaders of the group Small Property Owners of New York, or SPONY, said they are determined to make Mamdani realize that \u201csmall property owners are his partners in affordable housing.\u201d\nIn a joint statement, Ann Korchak, SPONY board president, and Lincoln Eccles, board vice president, said a rent freeze would be \u201caffordable housing Armageddon for tenants and owners.\u201d\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t want his legacy to be the collapse of affordable housing, the mayor-elect must allow the Rent Guidelines Board to set rent adjustments based on the RGB\u2019s own data, and provide small owners with the resources needed to operate their buildings and provide quality affordable housing to New Yorkers,\u201d they said.\nMamdani has said that he is committed to property tax reform and pursuing other forms of relief for property owners, including insurance alternatives.\nDavid Kramer, president of Hudson Companies, said that when he and other affordable housing developers met with Mamdani, he assured them he was not running to punish landlords.\n\u201cWhen it was fairly clear that he was leading in the polls, I and many others took a fresh look at him and realized there was such an overreaction to him, especially in real estate circles,\u201d he said. \u201cIn our conversations with him, he struck me as somebody that was going to be practical.\u201d\nPart of that perception was looking at Mamdani\u2019s current presence rather than \u201cfive-year-old tweets,\u201d Kramer said, referring to unearthed social media posts made by Mamdani, including some that were critical of the NYPD.\nKramer also said he was heartened by Mamdani naming former First Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer to his transition team, believing it to be a sign he will surround himself with experienced people.\n\u201cThat sends a huge statement to those people who are fretting,\u201d he said. \u201cHis top priority is going to be civic excellence.\u201d\nAnother developer, who asked to remain anonymous, was less enthused by her appointment, saying \u201cde Blasio 2.0 isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d\nAurora Capital Partners\u2019 Jared Epstein, who helped raise money for Andrew Cuomo, said he will always do whatever he can to contribute to New York\u2019s success.\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t exclude trying to find some common ground to work with Mamdani,\u201d he said.\nHe said Tuesday\u2019s results show that voters \u201cdemanded affordability and inclusion,\u201d not that they want to \u201cstall construction or to defund the police.\u201d (Mamdani has said that he doesn\u2019t plan to defund the police in response to questions about a\n2020 social media post\nthat showed support for defunding the police.)\n\u201cThe city cannot produce housing at scale without predictable rules and safe streets,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cPublic safety isn\u2019t an ideological luxury; it\u2019s the precondition for investment, retail vitality and neighborhood stability.\u201d\nHe said the next administration should be judged on \u201cunits delivered and certificates of occupancy.\u201d Housing production, he went on, will rely on amending the property tax break 485x and \u201cdisciplined\u201d timelines for the city\u2019s land use review process.\nDeveloper Bruce Teitelbaum agreed that, absent changes to 485x, Mamdani will have a difficult time delivering on his plan to build 200,000 housing units.\n\u201cWe need to build more housing of all categories quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThat premise transcends ideology and theory.\u201d\nTeitelbaum is preparing to start construction on his residential project known as\nOne45\n, where the addition of city subsidies could increase affordability levels under an agreement the developer made with Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine. He said Mamdani\u2019s focus on economic development and creating more affordable housing is \u201cmusic to my ears,\u201d but that the new mayor should meet one-on-one with developers and lenders.\n\u201cHe, as chief executive of the city, is going to have to personally get into the weeds,\u201d he said. \u201cHe needs to grab the reins.\u201d\n",

The firm inked a 125,000-square-foot, 10-year sublease on the 25th and 26th floors of the recently redeveloped Penn District tower. Robinhood is leasing the space from Madison Square Garden, a source said. The lease was first reported in CBRE\u2019s October Manhattan office report.\nIt\u2019s the third deal to surface this week at the 31-story Penn District tower, formerly known as 2 Penn Plaza, which recently underwent a $750 million renovation aimed at attracting blue-chip tenants. The redevelopment is part of Vornado\u2019s big bet on the Penn District, where the company has sunk $1.2 billion into revamping Penn 1 and Penn 2, along with ambitious plans to makeover the neighborhood\u2019s retail.\nChairman and CEO Steven Roth declared yesterday in an earnings call\nearlier this week\nthat \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the tipping point for the Penn District \u2014 our three-block-long city-within-a-city, is now behind us.\u201d\nThe Robinhood deal was the largest of the month in Midtown, where leasing activity totaled 1.6 million square feet, per CBRE. Year-to-date leasing activity reached 15.9 million square feet in the submarket, up 23 percent year over year. The report cited another deal at Penn 2 with Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, but a source said it has not been finalized.\nA spokesperson for Robinhood did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe lease adds to a string of recent deals at Penn 2, as tenants continue to gravitate toward newly renovated properties near mass transit. In the last week alone,\nFintech firm Current\nsigned a lease for a little over 62,000 square feet and\ncommunications and consulting firm FGS Glocal\nsigned an 80,000-square-foot lease at the 1.8 million-square-foot tower. Verizon inked a\n200,000-square-foot lease\nlast summer with plans to move its headquarters to the building.\nOther tenants at the tower include Madison Square Garden\u2019s corporate offices,\nMajor League Soccer\nand\nUniversal Music Group\n.\n",

        "content": "\u201cHow many of you were born in Miami?\u201d Carlos Rosso asked the crowd. From the hundreds seated, just a few hands raised.\n\u201cEach one of you came to Miami, and each one of you needed a condo,\u201d the Rosso Development head said from the main stage at\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nMiami Real Estate Forum. \u201cAnd each one of us built one for you.\u201d\nRosso was speaking alongside Continuum\u2019s Ian Bruce Eichner and Property Markets Group\u2019s Kevin Maloney, on a panel conversation on the state of South Florida\u2019s new development condo market. It was one moment that touched on a theme repeated throughout the conversation: Developers thrive when Miami is growing.\nRosso, Maloney and Eichner dug into the issues threatening the market\u2019s momentum and how they\u2019re differentiating their projects in a competitive field. The pipeline is oversaturated, and demand for units at the higher end is softening, they said. But their message to the brokers in the audience was simple and clear: \u201cWe want to pay you.\u201d\n\u201cWe love paying commissions because that means we have sales,\u201d Maloney said. And sales are top priority in a highly competitive market.\n\u201cA lot of the projects you see aren\u2019t going to get built, they priced themselves too low and costs went up,\u201d said Maloney, whose current pipeline includes the planned\nsupertall Waldorf Astoria Residences Miami\nand\nE11even Club Residences Beyond\n. Construction costs have surged in recent years, but Maloney said the market slowdown has started to bring them back down to earth.\nBranding plays a crucial role in the marketplace, if chosen well.\n\u201cA brand helps us sell because we don\u2019t have to explain [what we\u2019re selling],\u201d Rosso said, whose planned projects include\nthe Standard Residences, Midtown Miami\n. But he cautioned against running rampant with just any brand.\nHe pointed to magazine and car brands \u2013\u2013 Vertical Developments and Urban Network Capital Group are planning an\nElle-branded tower in Edgewater\nand Michael Stern is planning a\nMercedes-Benz tower in Brickell\n\u2013\u2013 as stretching the relationship between brands and buildings. \u201cYou have to be careful not to exaggerate the concept of branding.\u201d\nMomentum is crucial in a packed new development pipeline, the developers said. The longer a project takes, the greater the risk to profit margins. Maloney said his first\nE11even-branded tower\nsold through 400 units in 90 days, but still barely broke even because construction costs rose so rapidly.\n\u201cOur biggest, biggest, biggest enemy is time,\u201d said Rosso. \u201cTime for us is uncertainty.\u201d\nIncluded in uncertainty are affordability and social infrastructure challenges facing a growing Miami. Eichner, whose pipeline includes\nLa Baia North and South\nin Bay Harbor Islands, raised concerns about the dislocation of Miami\u2019s working class.\n\u201cPeople are being forced out of Miami-Dade County who are regular everyday workers,\u201d said Eichner. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out workforce housing and the government has to play a role in this.\u201d\nRosso also raised the issue of private school shortages and stricter immigration policies restricting how many people are able to relocate to the Miami market and hampering its growth. The perception that Miami is open for business and open to all is critical for the region\u2019s continued flourishing.\n\u201cWe cannot allow [that perception] to change,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause that is our business.\u201d",

A 78-unit motel in Long Beach also bought with Homekey funds recently reopened as a homeless shelter at a per-unit cost of about $294,000.\nWork was slated to begin with demolition on Nov. 2.\nOn the docket for the Ramada site is a conversion of \u201ctransient guest rooms into light housekeeping rooms\u201d with a change \u201cin interior layout, new laundry rooms, storage rooms, and a patio\u201d with \u201c\naffordability per [Executive Directive 1]\n,\u201d records at the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety cited by the Current said.

        "content": "The Housing Authority of Cook County has climbed out of federal oversight, but its internal struggles are far from over.\nThe nation\u2019s 14th-largest public housing authority, which serves more than 30,000 residents across suburban\nCook County\n, was removed from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s \u201ctroubled\u201d list last month after two years of poor audit performance and mismanagement, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n. Yet documents and interviews show that the agency, now led by Executive Director\nDanita Childers\n, is grappling with bitter infighting, high staff turnover and confusion over a secretive reorganization effort.\nRecords obtained by the outlet show payments exceeding $26,000 to attorney Charles Krugel for \u201creorganization\u201d work \u2014 despite Childers\u2019 public denials that a staff overhaul was underway. Board materials list 37 \u201cnew and restructured\u201d positions, and invoices reference both restructuring and an investigation into a board member. \u201cWe asked and were told there wouldn\u2019t be any reorg,\u201d board chair Wendy Walker Williams said during a heated September meeting. \u201cThis appears to us as though there has been one.\u201d\nChilders maintains that day-to-day staffing decisions fall under her purview, arguing the board\u2019s role is limited to governance, not operations. But board members contend that executive-level hires affect the agency\u2019s strategic direction and require oversight. The clash has fueled distrust between leadership and staff, with some employees describing a \u201ctoxic\u201d work environment and others accusing\nChilders\nof favoritism and retaliation.\nSince January, 16 employees \u2014 nearly 9 percent of the 180-person workforce \u2014 have quit, while 14 others have been terminated. Those departures come despite a new union contract signed in March aimed at improving wages and workloads. Morale remains low, with long-serving employees saying instability is undermining services for residents and voucher holders.\nMeanwhile, the agency faces scrutiny over $641,000 in outside contracts approved under Childers, including ethics, legal and consulting work. The board\u2019s investigation of Commissioner Eric Slaughter \u2014 who has been accused of \u201cunintentional sexual harassment\u201d following internal complaints \u2014 further exposed divisions within the agency. Slaughter denies wrongdoing and says he was punished for asking hard questions about spending.\nCounty\nBoard President\nToni Preckwinkle\n, who appoints housing authority commissioners, urged transparency but declined to intervene directly.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Shares jumped more than 4 percent after the new proposal, closing at $13.11 on Monday.\nMCB, which already owns about 9.2 percent of Whitestone\u2019s stock, said it has secured a letter from Wells Fargo expressing confidence it can raise up to $950 million in debt to fund the acquisition. The Baltimore firm, led by co-founder and managing partner David Bramble, signaled that patience is running out.\n\u201cAbsent constructive engagement toward a transaction or the initiation of a public strategic alternatives process, we intend at a minimum to vote against the entire Whitestone Board at the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders,\u201d Bramble wrote, calling on other investors to do the same.\nWhitestone has not commented on the latest offer. The REIT owns 55 open-air shopping centers in Texas and Arizona, with a portfolio exceeding $1 billion in value, including Houston\u2019s upscale\nBlvd Place\nnear the Galleria.\nMCB has accused Whitestone of\nchronic underperformance\nand weak governance, pointing to negative total returns since its first bid last summer.\nWhitestone reported better-than-expected third-quarter results \u2014 26 cents in core funds from operations per share and $41 million in revenue \u2014 but its stock has still fallen more than 10 percent year-to-date.\nIf Whitestone again rejects the offer, MCB could escalate to a proxy battle next year. The window for nominating board candidates opens Dec. 5 and runs through Jan. 4. It would mark the third activist challenge Whitestone has faced in as many years, after staving off\nEzra Asset Management in 2024\nand another dissident investor the year before.\nWhitestone\u2019s top shareholders \u2014 BlackRock with 15.2 percent and Vanguard with 10.9 percent \u2014 have not publicly weighed in.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "IBM is fast-tracking its Austin office relocation.\nThe tech stalwart said it will move into its space at Domain 12, a 320,000-square-foot office tower owned by Cousins Properties, next year \u2014 about a year earlier than previously expected, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe firm said its investment in the facility would build on the partner and client ecosystem it has established in Austin for more than 55 years.\nThe accelerated timeline marks a shift from what Brandywine Realty Trust CEO Jerry Sweeney\noutlined\njust weeks earlier.\nOn an Oct. 23 earnings call, Sweeney told analysts IBM would vacate its offices at Uptown ATX in 2027. Instead, IBM now plans to occupy the full Domain 12 building at\n11800 Alterra Parkway\nby next summer, according to recent filings. Domain 12 stands 17 stories and was delivered in 2020.\nIBM took over the tower last year after assuming Meta\u2019s full-building lease.\nThe building\u2019s tenant improvement work \u2014 estimated at $40 million \u2014 is set to begin Nov. 10 and wrap by July 1, 2026, according to a filing with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. The renovation will modernize all 320,000 square feet of space, though those details are preliminary.\nIBM\u2019s move caps a long search for a new Austin home that began in 2022. The company initially pre-leased a 320,000-square-foot office from Houston-based Hines in a to-be-built\nDomain project\n, but that deal fell through when the development failed to advance. Hines later secured rezoning for the site to pursue a mixed-use plan instead.\nIBM\u2019s shift to Domain 12 underscores its commitment to Austin as a key U.S. hub, even as the company trims office space in\nother markets\n. The new digs position IBM closer to major enterprise tenants and the city\u2019s tech corridor, where companies like Amazon, Indeed and Vrbo have anchored expansions in recent years.\nIBM still holds a 490,000-square-foot lease at 11400 Burnet Road, a Stonelake Capital Partners property also within The Domain, giving it one of the largest corporate presences in the district.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "I bet Zohran Mamdani loves the new upgrades to Grand Central Terminal.\nThe\nmayor-elect\nshould ask himself: Would they have happened if we treated transit stations like he does rent-stabilized apartments?\nThe MTA just finished a\n$700 million overhaul\nof Grand Central, giving the terminal 30 new turnstiles, 38 new or wider staircases and a wider mezzanine outside the entrance for the 4, 5, 6 and 7 trains. It also replaced 10 escalators and 10 elevators.\nNo such overhaul has happened to a rent-stabilized property since the Mamdani-backed Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019\ncapped rent increases\nto pay for major capital improvements at 2 percent and at $83 a month for individual apartment improvements.\nMeanwhile, the MTA snagged $15 billion from congestion pricing, which it is using to fund renovations across the transit system. Attention, socialists: Stuff costs money. More than taxing the rich would yield.\nSome landlords think the state legislature is following socialists\u2019 plan to take over their properties by starving them of revenue. As it happens, that is exactly what the government did to the city\u2019s subways, following a long period of deterioration.\nBy limiting the fare to 5 cents, it forced the subways\u2019 private operators to defer maintenance \u2014 rendering service horribly unreliable \u2014 and to eventually go bust. The public takeover was completed in 1940.\nThe government then did what it wouldn\u2019t allow the private subway companies to do: It doubled the fare to a dime in 1948 \u2014 the first increase since 1904.\nThe parallels with rent stabilization are almost eerie. To recap:\nThe government capped private subways\u2019 revenue, forcing their decline, bankruptcy and government takeover. The HSTPA, Rent Guidelines Board (which reduced rents for 10 consecutive years relative to inflation) and Mamdani\u2019s promised four-year rent freeze are doing the same for fully rent-stabilized buildings.\nTo be sure, a sweeping public seizure of buildings is not imminent. They have thousands of owners, not just a handful as the subways did, and every building\u2019s financial distress is different. They would go down one at a time, not all at once, if nothing is done.\nIt\u2019s likely that something will be done. We just don\u2019t know when and by whom. Even Mamdani might do something.\nHe won\u2019t back down from freezing the rent (upon taking control of the Rent Guidelines Board in 2028), but he could pull other levers that help owners. He could ask the state to\nreduce property taxes\nand to allow landlords to keep the full value of rental vouchers. He could provide low-interest loans for renovations of vacant units.\n\u201cThe campaign has ended,\u201d\ntweeted\nJay Martin of the New York Apartment Association, \u201cbut the battle to save New York\u2019s regulated housing from being squeezed to death is just beginning.\u201d\n",

        "content": "South Florida\u2019s office market experienced an uptick in investment sales over the past year, marking a comeback after a slowdown. Yet, distress and discounted deals are lingering, as elevated interest rates and other economic headwinds remain.\nDeal volume reached nearly $2.2 billion in the tri-county region in the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30, marking a 28 percent increase from the same period last year, according to data from CBRE. It also is a nearly 100 percent boost from the $1.1 billion sales volume during the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30 2023, when investment sales hit their lowest point in the past five years, the data shows.\nDeal volume is nowhere near the apex it reached during South Florida\u2019s pandemic-era market boom when out-of-state companies leased big blocks of space, prompting record rents and an investment sales bonanza. In the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30, 2021, $3.9 billion in deals closed, according to CBRE.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely gotten better than it was two years ago. It will come back like a Phoenix,\u201d said broker C. Todd Everett of Lee &amp; Associates. There\u2019s \u201cstarting to be an appetite for office.\u201d\nFinancing, which dried up during the climate of higher interest rates in recent years, is slowly coming back. Commercial mortgage-backed securities and debt funds are back into office lending. Life insurance companies and pension funds are slowly coming back, and banks remain the most skittish office lender, experts said.\n\u201cThe big banks are willing to selectively do high-quality office properties, and the local and regional banks are now making some office loans, and it\u2019s very borrower specific,\u201d said Chris Lee of CBRE. \u201cThey might want to see deposits increased by the borrower, and some recourse worked in.\u201d\nLoan spreads, or the lenders\u2019 profit margins, have decreased, and loan-to-value ratios have only slightly budged, Lee said.\nThis year, several all-cash deals were recorded.\nSpanish billionaire Amancio Ortega, known for buying all cash, paid\n$274.4 million\nlast month for the 30-story Sabadell Financial Center at 1111 Brickell Avenue in Miami. Generally, cash buyers are able to negotiate a better price because sellers prefer to avoid the uncertainty of financing.\nTroubles persist\nDistress still appeared in South Florida. R&amp;B Realty parted with its Gateway at Wynwood building, which the firm completed in 2021 and this year lost in foreclosure.\nYet, others were able to stave off losing their buildings in foreclosure auctions. Chris Neilson, court-appointed receiver overseeing Coral Gables\u2019 Columbus Center, sold it in March for\n$76 million\n, after previous owner Affinius Capital was hit with a foreclosure suit over an allegedly delinquent $71.6 million loan.\nOrlando-based Foundry Commercial sold the six-story Sawgrass Lake Center at 13450 West Sunrise Boulevard in Sunrise for\n$36.5 million\nin January, marking a 36.4 percent discount from its 2018 price.\nIn May, Boston-based Rockpoint, Miami-based Tricera, Palm Beach-based NDT Development and Boston-based New England Development sold the 18-story One Clearlake tower at 250 South Australian Avenue in West Palm Beach for\n$45 million\n. That\u2019s nearly 26 percent less than their purchase price four years ago.\nLandlords selling at a discount and even those just breaking even likely are trying to wiggle out of debt woes.\n\u201cThe trades you are seeing in the market are largely due to debt maturities,\u201d said broker Douglas K. Mandel of Marcus &amp; Millichap. \u201cIf you put floating-rate debt on loans [issued] in 2022, I think you are in a bad situation. \u2026 They are kind of forced to make a decision, whether they put new equity into a deal, or they sell it.\u201d\nBut, he cautioned, a discounted sale \u201cisn\u2019t the end of the world\u201d and doesn\u2019t signify widespread distress. The current climate also allows investors to have more buying power and afford higher tier buildings than they generally would have purchased, Mandel said.\nThat\u2019s why private investors and family offices permeated the buying pool during the slowdown in recent years. Institutional investors, which generally steered clear from office buildings in the past two years, are returning, albeit slowly.\nAfter the Federal Reserve imposed 12 aggressive interest rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, it twice dropped rates by 25 basis points this year. But this isn\u2019t enough to make a difference for landlords with floating-rate debt or seeking to refinance, experts said. The 10-year Treasury yields, which dictate rates on fixed-interest loans, remain higher.\nDue to the higher cost of capital, prices remain somewhat lower, but that pressure is easing, experts said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we are going to see \u201821 prices soon,\u201d Lee said. \u201cBut we are absolutely above \u201823 pricing.\u201d",

        "content": "Houston is turning to\nGod\u2019s backyard\nfor affordable housing development.\nTrinity East Village Senior Apartments, a four-story, 90-unit development for local seniors, will start construction this April on land owned by Trinity East United Methodist Church in Houston\u2019s Third Ward neighborhood, according to a filing with the state.\nThe project is expected to finish in October 2027. All units will be one-bedroom apartments for people older than 62, according to a Houston Housing Authority memo.\nThe NHP Foundation and a local community development corporation, the Trinity East Village CDC, are collaborating on the development.\nConstruction is expected to cost about $33 million, which will be financed via\nlow income housing tax credits\n. The City of Houston is estimated to contribute $4 million of soft financing, and the Houston Housing Authority plans to contribute $2 million.\nIn a trend dubbed Yes in God\u2019s Backyard, or YIGBY, developers have been looking into land owned by\nreligious organizations\n, which are among the biggest landowners in the country.\nCalifornia passed a\nlaw\ntwo years ago that streamlined affordable housing development on land owned by religious organizations and nonprofit colleges,\nunlocking an estimated 171,000 acres\nfor development.\nSimilar proposals were filed in\nthe last Texas legislature\n, but they\ndidn\u2019t progress\n. Opponents such as The Real Estate Council argued that YIGBY projects need affordable unit requirements, which the bill did not include.\nTrinity East Village will primarily serve outgoing residents of Cuney Homes, a 90-year-old public housing complex that the Houston Housing Authority plans to redevelop.\nBuilt in the 1930s, Cuney is Houston\u2019s oldest public housing development. Cuney residents were told earlier this year to prepare to move out, the Houston Chronicle reported. Two-thirds of Trinity East Village\u2019s 90 units will be reserved for them.\nConstruction of an affordable housing project is underway at the site of a former church in\nSouth Dallas\n, and a congregation in\nAustin\nis developing a mixed-use project anchored by a new church.\n",

        "content": "David Tabak appears to have found his next Brooklyn project, one likely to be less complex than the much-watched Brooklyn Yards development.\nTabak acquired the development site at 563 Sackett Street in Gowanus for $58.5 million, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The 38,500-square-foot site traded for nearly $1,520 per square foot.\nThe seller was the Mazzei family, who has owned the one-story garage on the site since 2005. Demolition permits for the garage have yet to be filed, but it could be nothing more than a matter of time.\nTabak is already looking at a 12-story, 350-unit residential building at the full block between Third Avenue and Nevins Street. The site allows for a 259,000-square-foot development and is zoned for residential and commercial use.\nCritically, the site comes with eligibility for the 421a tax abatement, one of the few large-scale redevelopment sites left with that distinction, according to the deal\u2019s brokers.\nA JLL team including Michael Mazzara, Ethan Stanton and Brendan Maddigan brokered the sale. The outlet could not reach spokespeople for the buyer or seller to comment.\nThe Mazzeis took a shot at developing on the site,\nfiling plans\nin 2022 for a 12-story, 291-unit project. But those plans never materialized.\nTabak and Meyer Lebovits are pursuing what appears to be a more complicated project on the surface in another part of Brooklyn, Borough Park.\nA year ago, the developers\nwon approva\nl for a 14-building, 270-unit project to be built on top of a freight rail line. The ambitious design curves around four city blocks and would be built directly above active tracks where a freight train rumbles through once a day.\nThe project will consist largely of four-story townhomes, along with a few six-story townhomes and a nine-story commercial building at the end. Of the 270 units, 30 percent will be affordable.\nThe project is viewed as a\npotential model\nfor further development opportunities across New York City.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "JC Griffin\u2019s pitch for a gleaming high-rise campus on Chicago\u2019s Near South Side is moving into the city approval stage, but the ink still isn\u2019t dry on the necessary land sale or construction financing for the massive project that also touts an AI workforce training facility and green energy.\nThe former Transwestern broker\u2019s Griffin Venture Group is promoting its 1.4 million-square-foot Metropolis Pointe proposal as a low-carbon, tech-driven \u201cnext-gen lifestyle campus,\u201d yet much about the project remains aspirational.\nStill, the developer has taken a significant step toward city approval by gaining 4th Ward Alderman Lamont Robinson\u2019s support for the project and has hired a legal team with considerable clout.\nGriffin brought on lawyers with Croke Fairchild Duarte &amp; Beres including David Reifman, the city\u2019s former Planning Commissioner under Rahm Emanuel, as well as Jesse Dodson. They\u2019re set to meet with city planning officials early next month for some initial feedback on the plan.\nGriffin is under contract to buy the 6.6-acre site at 26th Street and Martin Luther King Drive from King Sykes LLC, a local investor group that once tried to sell the same land to data-center firm Equinix.\nThat\n$30 million deal collapsed and led to a lawsuit\nover city interference in which a former alderman,\nSophia King\n, allegedly tried to steer the sale to\nScott Goodman\u2019s Farpoint Development\n, leader of the Bronzeville Lakefront megaproject next door. A judge later\ndismissed\nKing Sykes\u2019 claims, however.\nNow, Griffin\u2019s firm is pursuing city approvals for a residential tower and mixed-use complex that would sit adjacent to Bronzeville Lakefront, which is progressing, but slowly, on transforming that site formerly anchored by the Michael Reese Hospital.\nThe King Sykes site\u2019s current owners paid $12.4 million for it in 2007 and have held it through years of stalled plans and political friction,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported.\nGriffin\u2019s proposed project \u2014 his firm\u2019s first ground-up development in Chicago \u2014 would mark a dramatic pivot: a 50-story high-rise with more than 600 apartments and condos, plus retail and a \u201csky veranda\u201d at the top.\nThe plan also layers in an Artificial Intelligence Preparedness Institute, billed as a hub for AI research and workforce training, alongside a 185,000-square-foot digital infrastructure facility and a 26,000-square-foot cogeneration electricity plant in partnership with energy operator CenTrio.\nYet there\u2019s still a long path ahead. Financing details haven\u2019t been disclosed, and Griffin has declined to name institutional partners for the AI institute. Even with Bronzeville Lakefront next door, that megaproject has itself experienced a delayed rollout as developers navigate interest rates, infrastructure costs and city politics.\nIf Griffin can close on the site and push entitlements through, Metropolis Pointe could become one of the largest private investments in Bronzeville\u2019s recent history.\nBut without clear financial backing or a finalized land transfer, the initiative risks joining Chicago\u2019s long list of overhyped projects that never broke ground. For now, the \u201ccity\u2019s first next-gen lifestyle campus\u201d is still an idea on paper \u2014 albeit one with a slick pitch deck and a developer betting his reputation on it.\n",

And there\u2019s still more to come \u2013\u2013 the city is courting developers for its 90-acre Marina Village project, a redevelopment effort focused on the city\u2019s waterfront corridor. The Riviera Beach City Council is currently considering proposals from two developers, Bob Sonnenblick\u2019s Los Angeles-based Sonnenblick Development and Peter Baytarian\u2019s North Palm Beach-based Forest Development, both of which include residential components, according to planning documents.\nForest is also competing with West Palm Beach-based Kenco Communities and Washington, D.C.-based Frontier Development &amp; Hospitality Group\nfor a 2.2-acre city-owned site\nthat could become a development with hundreds of additional residential units.\nHere\u2019s a look at the residential pipeline so far:\nResidences at Marina Village | 57 East 12th Street | Related Group\nThe P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Miami-based Related Group is planning an eight-story, 149-unit apartment complex on the 2.4 acre site at 57 East 12th Street in Riviera Beach. The developer won approval for the project in June and landed $100.3 million in construction financing in September. The apartments are slated for households earning between 30 percent and 110 percent of Palm Beach County\u2019s area median income, which was $104,000 in 2024.\nGallery at Marina Village | 1300 Broadway | Related Group, BH Group and Tezral Partners\nAdjacent to the planned Residences at Marina Village is the site for Gallery at Marina Village. Related is partnering with Isaac and Liat Toledano\u2019s Aventura-based BH Group and Tezral Partners, a Riviera Beach-based development firm led by former Riviera Beach CRA director Tony Brown and Ezra Saffold, for the project. The planned 20-story, two-tower project at 1300 Broadway will have 418 apartments, about 3,000 square feet of retail, another 3,000 square feet of offices and a 648-space parking garage.\nMarina Annex | 251 West 11th Street | O\u2019Connor Capital Partners, Urban Farmers, Riviera Beach Housing Authority\nNew York-based O\u2019Connor Capital Partners is planning Marina Annex, a mixed-use apartment project with 175 units, 6,500 square feet of retail and a 15,000-square-foot community center at 251 West 11th Street. The partners bought the 3.6-acre site for $2 million in February. The developers are partnering with the Alpha Phi Alpha Foundation to run the community center, which will be named for the late Edward Rodgers, the first Black circuit court judge of Palm Beach County.\n1117 Broadway | SobelCo\nBoca Raton-based SobelCo, led by Samuel and Jeffrey Sobel, is planning a sprawling mixed-use condo project on a 4.3-acre former boat yard in Riviera Beach. The complex will include two 20-story buildings and two 13-story buildings, totaling 508 condos, 10,000 square feet of retail and restaurants, and a parking garage with 1,083 spaces. SobelCo bought the site at 1117 Broadway for $12 million in March. Riviera Beach gave its final approval for the project this week.\nSoleste on the Trail | 7920 North Military Trail | Estate Companies\nSouth Miami-based Estate Companies is planning a four-story, 255-unit apartment complex dubbed Soleste on the Trail at 7920 North Military Trail. Estate, led by Robert Suris and Jeffrey Ardizon, dropped $8 million for the 15.8-acre site in 2021, according to public records. The firm landed a $60 million construction loan from BB Americas Bank for the project in September.\n3700 Broadway | Oculina | Forest Development\nBaytarian is planning a pair of 25-story mixed-use condo towers with 399 units, more than 17,000 square feet of restaurant space, 11,000 square feet of offices, and nearly 10,000 square feet of retail. Oculina, as the project is called, is planned for a 3.4-acre site at 3700 Broadway that was formerly a Winn-Dixie. Baytarian agreed to pay $4.9 million to the city\u2019s affordable housing fund in exchange for increased height and density for the project.",

With that move, the property at 751 North Highland Avenue is hitting the market for just under $7 million, or $1,507 per square foot.\nCarolwood Estates\n\u2019\nKevin Booker\nholds the listing. Booker also worked with Edmonds on finding his Las Vegas studio.\n\u201cKenny is so smart,\u201d Booker said of how Edmonds configured the space. \u201cThat [upper level] area was designed for meditation, or there were certain artists that got in a groove and they didn\u2019t want to leave for three or four days. So, somebody like Michael Jackson could stay there for a few weeks and be comfortable.\u201d\nThe Hollywood property\u2019s upper level bedroom and meditation area also has a full bath.\nThe building spans 4,640 square feet and sits on a nearly 6,000-square-foot lot. It\u2019s minutes from the Ovation Hollywood open-air retail center, Hollywood Walk of Fame and other attractions.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had everyone from Phil Collins to Aretha Franklin to Mariah Carey and En Vogue [record there]. Everybody that shaped the music industry and is still shaping the industry today,\u201d Booker said.\nThe list of artists that have worked in the space is extensive and includes Janet Jackson, Whitney Houston, Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Barbra Streisand, Pharrell Williams, Toni Braxton, C\u00e9line Dion, Fall Out Boy, Lionel Richie and Ariana Grande.\nEdmonds has racked up 13 Grammy Awards and 26 number one R&amp;B songs among other accolades during his career.\nBooker, who specializes in working with high-profile clients,\njoined Carolwood last year\n, after nearly a decade at Westside Estate Agency.\n\u201cThe education I got from [Westside Estate Agency co-founder] Kurt Rappaport is equivalent to a Harvard degree,\u201d Booker said, adding that Carolwood \u201cis the future\u201d for the local high end.\nThe agent, who has career sales over $100 million, said business has been steady this year and pointed out that it helps to be part of a brokerage that holds a sizable share of the\nluxury inventory\nlocally.\nIn July, Booker was the listing agent, along with Carolwood\u2019s James Harris and David Parnes, on the $28.5 million sale of\n755 Sarbonne Road\nin Bel-Air.\nErewhon\nCEO Anthony Antoci and President Josephine Antoci sold the 15,000-square-foot residence to entrepreneur Dara Mir, husband of \u201cShahs of Sunset\u201d star Lily Ghalichi. That closing price equated to more than $6 million over what the Antocis paid for the property a year prior.\n",

        "content": "Innovation QNS may be no more, but developers are still hopeful of squeezing housing projects out of the Astoria megaproject site.\nThe Hakimian Organization and Cheskie Weisz\u2019s CW Realty filed plans for projects at 35-17 42nd Street and 42-08 35th Avenue in the Queens neighborhood, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The developers acquired the adjacent sites at the start of the year\nfor $15.8 million\n.\nOn 35th Avenue, the partners are planning a 13-story, 90,000-square-foot property with 99 residential units, ostensibly seeking to duck the\n485x wage requirements\nthat would kick in with the addition of one more unit to the development. The building would also include ground-floor retail space.\nOn 42nd Street, the developers are eyeing a 16-story, 56,000-square-foot property with 67 residential units. Heartfelt Townhouse Build filed plans to demolish the one-story buildings at both the 42nd Street and 35th Avenue addresses.\nA third building may also be in the works, as the project filings detail a lot with a total of 234 units; representatives of the companies did not respond to requests for comment from the outlet.\nThe $2 billion Innovation QNS megaproject was one of the biggest set to be tackled in the city, receiving rezoning approval from the City Council three years ago. In September, however, the developers behind the five-site, 3,200-unit project\nsplit up\n, doomed as Silverstein Properties walked away over concerns including uncertainty about multifamily development tax policy.\nThe disbanding of the development team has left individual firms picking up the pieces, trying to get anything done.\nBedRock Real Estate Partners is working with an affiliate of L+M Development on a 560-unit development at 35-19 Steinway Street, while Domain Companies is working on a 330-unit building at 35-45 41st Street and a 99-unit building at 35-42 41st Street.\nStill unanswered is how the project-wide commitments made in the original development team\u2019s deal with the City Council will be applied to individual projects on the five development sites.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Michael Liebowitz and Guy Gal didn\u2019t hold back on Compass\u2019 planned takeover of Anywhere Real Estate, the push for commission clawbacks and the future of brokerage brands during a wide-ranging debate at\nThe Real Deal\u2019s Miami Real Estate Forum\n.\nBoth CEOs took jabs at the proposed deal that would turn the combined companies into a brokerage behemoth in a conversation moderated by\nTRD\nEditor in Chief Stuart Elliott on Wednesday.\nCompass announced earlier this year that it plans to acquire Anywhere, the parent company for Corcoran, Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, Coldwell Banker and Century 21, in an all-stock deal\nvalued at $1.6 billion\n.\nDouglas Elliman CEO\nLiebowitz\nsuggested the $300 million in expected cost cuts that the merger would bring will push some agents to leave Compass and the Anywhere brands.\n\u201cThese are very difficult businesses to integrate. The second you start taking things away from agents, there is no barrier to leave. You can just basically get up, leave and go to another firm, obviously have some clawbacks and all that,\u201d said Liebowitz. \u201cIt\u2019s just the reality of what happens anytime you do a deal. You have to realize you\u2019re going to lose pieces of that deal after it\u2019s done.\u201d\nGal, founder and CEO of the white-label firm Side, jumped in to note that it is \u201cincredibly hard\u201d for a top agent to leave Compass today.\n\u201cWe talk to Compass agents all the time who are looking to explore their options and then realize they really can\u2019t, unless they\u2019re coming out of pocket for a whole lot of money, to a point where we\u2019ve had to set up what I affectionately refer to as the \u2018Compass emancipation fund,\u2019 where we\u2019re advancing agents money at no interest,\u201d Gal said.\nClawbacks\nare necessary, Liebowitz said.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t put all that energy and effort and dollars into the agents when they come on and not have that ability to do it,\u201d he said.\nGal championed the agent side of the business. Side helps agents create their brokerage brand and provides them with back-end services. But if agents want to exit their deals with Side within two years of joining the company, then they have to pay Side back.\n\u201cI want to remind all the agents in this room \u2026 because you spend the whole career being indoctrinated and institutionalized to believe the complete opposite. But the truth at the end of the day is that you\u2019re the value creator in this industry,\u201d Gal said. \u201cYou wake up every morning, you connect invisible dots. You\u2019re putting up your own time, your own money, your own opportunity, taking all the damn risk, and you are the ones that make it happen. And then you do a favor to all these other companies by slapping their logo on top of your name.\u201d\nLiebowitz, who became president and CEO of Elliman about a year ago, suggested his company\u2019s\n$85 million sale\nof its property management arm to a subsidiary of Associa, one of the largest property management firms in the country, was timed right with\nZohran Mamdani\nwinning the mayoral election in New York.\n\u201cI\u2019m not really being political, but we were in the property management business. It was a big business, and there\u2019s a lot of issues with labor law in New York. I don\u2019t think a lot of people realize that with that administration, it\u2019s going to be more difficult,\u201d Liebowitz said. \u201cSo it was really it kind of wind up between the Anywhere and Compass merger, between what was going on in New York, between getting a really top price. We really want to be a pure-play real estate brokerage firm, asset light.\u201d\nGal and Liebowitz were also critical of the National Association of Realtors\u2019 handling of the class action litigation centered around commission payments and buyer broker agreements.\nGal said the lawsuits \u201care a gift\u201d to the industry.\n\u201cJust a year ago, you had a million agents out there that are averaging three closings a year pitching buyers. It\u2019s free and no obligation, and that\u2019s how they were getting deals done with actual buyers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t do that anymore\u2026 and that\u2019s putting a lot of the larger brokerages at risk, because so much of their revenue and their income and their profits depend on those part time agents at very favorable splits to the house.\u201d\nLiebowitz said someone at NAR recently reached out to him to speak.\n\u201cWhy the hell would I waste my time? You know what,\u00a0 I actually said, \u2018I want the agenda before I get on the phone,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI just want my money back from the settlement. We paid off all our debts, and now I would love to have that cash.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A Dallas investor betting on healthcare real estate is swooping into Chicago\u2019s North Side, taking a distressed lab building off\nSterling Bay\u2019s\nhands as the developer\nsheds property\n.\nAltera Fund Advisors is in contract to buy the Lincoln Park Bioscience Center at\n2430 North Halsted Street\nand plans to convert the five-story, 125,000-square-foot building into a multi-tenant medical outpatient facility, Costar\nreported\n.\nThe deal is expected to close later this year, Altera CEO Terry Quinn told the outlet. The deal marked Altera\u2019s second Chicago-area purchase after a property in Oak Lawn.\nThe building\u2019s sellers \u2014 Sterling Bay and partner\nHarrison Street\n\u2014 teamed up with lender Capital One to market the asset last year through CBRE.\nThe sale price is likely far below the property\u2019s $64 million debt, people familiar with the deal told the outlet.\nIt\u2019s another sign of how far the\nonce-hyped life sciences play\nhas fallen. Sterling Bay bought the former Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital site for $24 million in 2018 and poured another $19 million into renovations to launch it as a biotech incubator.\nBut demand for lab space has cooled since the pandemic, leaving the Halsted property 40 percent leased when it hit the market.\nIt also follows a falling out last year between Sterling Bay and one of the building\u2019s major tenants \u2014 Massachusetts-based\nBioLabs\n\u2014 as Sterling Bay sued to evict and asked a Cook County judge to award more than $2.7 million in damages over a dispute regarding the tenant\u2019s lease of 30,000-square-feet of the Halsted building.\nBioLabs operates similarly to\ncoworking\nproviders, by renting large blocks of real estate that it can turn into lab space. It then subleases the space to early-stage companies in need of research equipment and workspace on more flexible and briefer terms than standard office leases. It operates across 17 other locations in the U.S., Europe and Japan according to its website.\nThe slowdown has also hammered Sterling Bay\u2019s $6 billion\nLincoln Yards\nmegaproject nearby, where Bank OZK recently seized 28 acres and sold them to JDL Development and Kayne Anderson Real Estate for $84 million to make way for a new residential district called\nFoundry Park\n.\nQuinn said Altera plans to reposition the Halsted building as a Class A medical office property catering to outpatient users. Quinn added that the structure\u2019s HVAC and electrical systems make it ideal for clinical tenants. O\u2019Donnell Commercial Real Estate will handle leasing, with available blocks ranging from 2,000 to 50,000 square feet.\nThe deal is part of Altera\u2019s strategy of buying healthcare assets at a \u201csubstantial discount to replacement cost.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The plan has triggered fierce backlash from locals worried the North Fork is going the way of the Hamptons.\nThe Soloviev Group\u2019s proposal, called the Colusa Conservation Subdivision, would carve 47 residential lots out of one of the region\u2019s largest remaining farm tracts. Plans call for 18 bluff-top parcels overlooking Long Island Sound and 29 inland lots, while preserving 267 acres of farmland. The project, through Soloviev\u2019s Crossroads Atlantic LLC, could be worth hundreds of millions when built.\nSouthold officials initially called the proposal \u201cencouraging\u201d for its use of the town\u2019s conservation subdivision model, which preserves farmland while allowing limited development. But town planners later flagged major issues.\nIn a letter last month, planning director Heather Lanza wrote the design didn\u2019t conform to Southold\u2019s comprehensive plan, citing concerns that residential spurs would cut through preserved farmland. She called for a \u201cmore compact clustered lot design\u201d and better integration of open space.\nSoloviev, heir to the late real estate titan Sheldon Solow, has become one of the East End\u2019s biggest landowners in recent years, assembling hundreds of acres through his Crossroads Atlantic venture.\nThe company, which farms across several states, withdrew an earlier 11-lot proposal for part of the same site in 2021 after neighbor pushback.\nOpposition this time has been loud and sharp. On social media and in civic groups, residents warned of \u201cSouth Forkification,\u201d shorthand for the creeping luxury and second-home influx that\u2019s transformed the Hamptons. Critics question whether 47 multimillion-dollar homes will serve the local community or simply add to traffic and strain local services.\nCivic leaders are watching closely. Carolyn McCall, president of the local civic association in Cutchogue, said the group may host a forum on the plan once a revised sketch is filed.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that the town will continue to strike that balance between economic development and also the preservation of our land and the quality of life that we enjoy so much out here in Southold,\u201d board member Dave Bergen told the publication.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The mosque has owned the site, alternatively addressed at 120 Madison Street, since the 1980s.\nThe venture aims to raze the three-story property and replace it with a 12-story, 94,000-square-foot building with 144 senior housing units, according to a rezoning application submitted to the Department of City Planning.\nThe development would include more than 13,000 square feet of community space and nearly 5,000 square feet of commercial space; the former would be reserved for the mosque and the Clara Muhammad School, both of which currently occupy 44,000 square feet at the site.\nThe project is expected to cost at least $90 million, according to a post on the developer\u2019s website, which detailed a project smaller in scope than what\u2019s planned now. Neither the developer nor the mosque immediately responded to requests for comment from the outlet.\nPierre Downing\u2019s Kalel Companies is largely known in New York City for its projects under NYCHA\u2019s Permanent Affordability Commitment Together program, putting public housing developments under private management. The firm has several projects in the works, according to its\nwebsite\n, including a first foray into New Jersey via Jersey City.\nElsewhere in Bed-Stuy, Jacob Fulop\nfiled plans\nin June for a 120-unit project at 1445 Fulton Street, which would span 76,000 square feet and rise 12 stories, reaching 119 feet tall.

A source indicated that the comments, viewed as Islamophobic, were the reason for the firing.\nPanzer did not return a request for comment.\n\u201cWe can confirm Scott Panzer is no longer with JLL. The views and sentiment expressed in his email do not align with our company\u2019s culture and shared values,\u201d said a JLL spokesperson.\nPanzer is one of the top office leasing brokers in the city. At one time, he oversaw leasing at Sheldon Solow\u2019s 9 West 57th Street.\nOne day after Mamdani\u2019s win, real estate executives struck a\ncautiously optimistic tone\n, focusing on elements of the mayor-elect\u2019s agenda where they see common ground, including his commitment to build more affordable housing.\nStill, others fear the effect of his promise to freeze rents for stabilized apartments for four years, with one landlord group saying the move would result in nothing short of \u201caffordable housing Armageddon.\u201d\n",

        "content": "After the pandemic ignited a surge in new-to-market tenants from states such as New York and California to South Florida, Donna Abood believed that the spike would eventually subside.\n\u201cWhen we got up to this pinnacle, we thought, \u2018OK, we\u2019re gonna plateau,\u2019\u201d\nAbood\n, vice chairman and co-head for Savills Florida, recalled while on the main stage at\nThe Real Deal\nMiami Real Estate Forum. \u201cNope. They\u2019re coming all the more because we are the place to do business.\u201d\nAbood shared insights into the current state of South Florida\u2019s office market alongside Ryan Holtzman, executive managing director of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, and David Moret, founder of\nHighline Real Estate Capital\n. For the most part, new tenants with deep budgets flocking to new projects in Brickell, downtown Miami, Wynwood, Miami Beach and Coconut Grove are propping up the region.\n\u201cWhen these groups come into town, they\u2019re used to class A buildings in New York, Chicago and California,\u201d Holtzman said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re willing to pay up to be in the best buildings.\u201d\nFor instance,\nThe Fifth Miami Beach\n, a five-story boutique building currently under construction in Miami Beach\u2019s South of Fifth neighborhood, is among the most expensive new projects in South Florida, Holtzman noted.\nCushman &amp; Wakefield is handling leasing for The Fifth Miami Beach, which is being developed by Sumaida + Khurana and Bizzi + Bilgili \u2013\u2013 a joint venture between Turkish investor Serdar Bilgili\u2019s BLG Capital and Bizzi &amp; Partners. The new building will have 60,200 square feet of offices, retail and dining space.\n\u201cThe Fifth Miami Beach is a jewel box,\u201d Holtzman said. \u201cIt has a ton of demand. We\u2019re close to 90 percent [leased] in terms of deals that we\u2019re negotiating on, and we\u2019re hitting record rents [for the city] between $180 to $240 [a square foot].\u201d\nAbood grilled Holtzman about new tenants eventually pushing back on high asking rents. \u201cDon\u2019t you think there\u2019ll be some point in time when companies are going to say \u2018Enough. I\u2019m not coming to Miami for $240 a square foot.\u2019\u201d\nHoltzman insisted projects like The Fifth Miami Beach are attracting hedge funds and private equity firms that are leasing spaces of 10,000 square feet or less. \u201cFor them, it\u2019s a small amount based on the quality of where they want to be and the type of asset.\u201d\nIn the next couple of years, he expects the Miami-Dade office submarket to experience a boost from tenants seeking spaces larger than 10,000 square feet at competitive rates. Those firms, he said, will flock to new office spaces in projects like\nMiami Freedom Park\n, a $1 billion mixed-use project anchored by a soccer stadium being developed by Inter Miami MLS franchise owners, billionaire Jorge Mas, retired international soccer star David Beckham and Ares Management.\nThe developers are currently building the project\u2019s first office building that will have 250,000 square feet of space, which is being marketed by Cushman &amp; Wakefield, Holtzman said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to get much larger tenants,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see corporate groups relocated from Charlottes of the world and Atlantas of the world. That\u2019s going to be a different price point and a different type of product.\u201d\nYet, the overall office space in Miami-Dade County is shrinking, noted Highline\u2019s Moret. \u201cRoughly 10 percent of the entire office market has either been demolished or is going to be demolished for industrial or multifamily,\u201d Moret said. \u201cAnd, at the same time, you\u2019ve got a flight to quality because tenants want to get their employees back in the office.\u201d\nInstitutional owners of older office buildings are also seeking exit strategies, Moret said. \u201cOffice is still a four-letter word,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is pretty much zero institutional capital chasing office these days.\u201d",

JPI is partnering with Denton Housing Authority to develop the apartment complex.\nIt will feature a pool, courtyard with grills, beer garden, indoor-outdoor gym and dog park.\nJPI also recently started construction on nearby\nJefferson Bonnie Brae\n, which it\u2019s building with the help of tax-exempt municipal bonds. Denton Housing Authority owns the land and is projected to receive $35 million in equity from the deal in the first decade. The 461-unit workforce housing community will be located at North Bonnie Brae Street and Bronco Way, also in Denton.\nDenton is the northern tip of a triangle that includes Fort Worth and Dallas, about 40 miles away from each. It has a population of about 166,000 and has been boosted by the wave of growth north of Dallas.\nDespite the wave of multifamily construction and apartment deliveries in North Texas, the region is still\nshort more than 80,000 housing units\n, according to the Texas Public Policy Foundation. And the gap continues to grow.\nThe recent passage of state legislation like\nSenate Bill 840\naimed to make multifamily development easier in big Texas cities by removing barriers for developers trying to convert buildings with other uses to apartments.\nAs much as residents of northern DFW suburbs claim to be proponents of the slogan \u201cDon\u2019t California My Texas,\u201d political leaders responded to the law\u2019s passage in a very California way \u2014 by\npassing measures to curb\nlawmakers\u2019 attempt to encourage apartment development. Cities like Irving, Plano, Frisco and Arlington have considered adding height requirements and other measures stipulating what kind of amenities an apartment building needs to have.\n",

Bruehl is not joining Christie\u2019s with any of his Saunders listings.\nThough Christie\u2019s opened its East Hampton office in November 2023, the firm has\nyet to make a splash\nin the enclave, a sentiment Bruehl acknowledged to\nTRD.\nHe described the brokerage\u2019s debut as \u201cunderbranded.\u201d Now that he\u2019s at the helm, however, Bruehl plans to build up awareness of the outpost.\nAs managing director, Bruehl is tasked with leading the 15 agents headquartered at the firm\u2019s East End location, including 30-year veteran Bonita DeWolf and Sanda Busch of the New York City-based Gottlieb Team.\nHe plans on hiring a small number of \u201ctop-shelf senior producers\u201d with the goal of eventually opening offices in Southampton and Westhampton. He added that he intends to double down on harnessing social media and podcasts to sell real estate.\nBruehl said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t be happier\u201d with his time at Saunders. He added that he wasn\u2019t looking to leave the firm when he met with the Christie\u2019s affiliate\u2019s owner, president and CEO, Ilija Pavlovic. He said the decision to exit Saunders came after the two had a four-hour lunch at the top of the Rockefeller Center,\nHe said a major selling point for him was that he\u2019d be running the only Christie\u2019s office in the region. He also touted the firm\u2019s relationship with the auction house and the opportunity to travel to the company\u2019s affiliates in other countries, including an upcoming trip to Portugal, Amsterdam and London.\n\u201cI always knew that there would come a time when I would need an international brand,\u201d Bruehl said. \u201cOnce my online brand was big enough, my buyer pool broader and my seller clients broader, I knew I would need a bigger platform.\u201d\nPavlovic added that the Hamptons have increasingly become \u201can international destination.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a fact,\u201d Pavlovic said. \u201cFor us, this is the first big step in a new direction.\u201d\nPavlovic also touted the firm\u2019s relationship with developers as a draw for Bruehl, including what Pavlovic claimed was the largest portfolio of new development in New Jersey, with more than $1 billion in the pipeline. In New York, the firm\nformed a partnership\nwith new development veteran, Shlomi Reuveni.\nAndrew Saunders, president of Saunders, did not respond to a request for comment.\nBefore joining Saunders in 2015, Bruehl was with Sotheby\u2019s International. He also served as a financial advisor with Morgan Stanley during the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n",

He further predicted the banks would try to quickly sell the building, referring to it to\nCrain\u2019s\nas \u201ckryptonite to a lender.\u201d\nVornado chief executive officer Steven Roth appears resigned to the loss. During an earnings call on Tuesday, he said that \u201cbad stuff happens every once in a while, even to us,\u201d while noting the firm wrote off its stake in the property three years ago.\nThe debt behind the Class A office building was sent to special servicing last month after the borrower failed to meet payment obligations, according to Morningstar Credit.\nLocated between East 59th and 60th streets, the 28-story office and retail building totals 595,000 square feet. It was purchased by a group of investors \u2014 including Vornado, Oxford Properties Group and the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System \u2014 in 2013 for roughly $1.3 billion.\nOwnership secured a $214 million refinancing for the property in 2019. But revenue and occupancy have fallen since then. Occupancy was 97 percent when the loan was issued, but Ralph Lauren \u2014 which once leased over 40 percent of the space in the building \u2014\ndownsized\nby 39 percent and is\npaying\nabout 30 percent less in rent.\nOccupancy dipped to 57 percent in 2024, according to Morningstar, but is back up to 74 percent. Office tenants include Lakewood Capital, according to Vornado\u2019s website, while retail space is occupied by Celine, Moncler, Balmain, Cremieux, Tod\u2019s and others.\nAt its most recent appraisal, the property saw its value fall; once estimated to be worth $1.21 billion, 650 Madison was appraised at $950 million.\nVornado\u2019s\nrevenue\nfor the third quarter was $453.7 million, a 2.4 percent year-over-year increase.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Matt Katsaros is on a spree of deals.\nShortly after notching a win in Lakeview, his development firm\nWilwood Investments\nsold a 36-unit apartment building in Lincoln Park for $28 million.\nThe sale price of the building, which is located at 2411 North Lincoln Avenue, was boosted by two ground-level retail spaces that are currently leased by Wells Fargo and Panera Bread, Katsaros said.\nThe buyer was Chicago-based Highgate Capital Group, which focuses on multifamily investments in secondary markets and didn\u2019t return a request for comment. While it\u2019s unclear exactly how much money the development team put into the project, Katsaros said it sold with a 6 percent capitalization rate.\nWilwood, along with general contractor Contemporary Concepts, opted to build a smaller number of 3- and 4-bedroom units on the oddly shaped triangular lot rather than a higher number of studios and one-bedroom units because of its proximity to\nDePaul University\n. The building is more likely to be occupied by tenants living with roommates than properties in other areas of Chicago, Katsaros said.\n\u201cKnowing that the DePaul campus is across the street, it\u2019s a pretty youthful base,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has 36 units but 98 bedrooms, all rented by the unit.\u201d\nThe developers also got lucky with a well-timed ordinance change in Chicago that allowed them to reduce the amount of parking spaces they originally intended to include and instead pivot to adding an additional retail space that was eventually filled by Panera. In 2022, the city passed a Transit-Served Location Ordinance that lowered parking requirements for developments within a certain distance from a public transit stop. The\nordinance was expanded\nearlier this year.\n\u201cWe had programmed a one-to-one [unit-to-parking spot ratio] but we ended up going down to about 50 percent,\u201d he said.\nWildwood bought the development site from\nSterling Bay\nin 2021. Before that, it was a privately-owned greenspace called Julia Porter Park.\nAlthough the team eventually put together a proposal that maximized profitability of the site, it wasn\u2019t an easy parcel to work with. The apartment building comes to a sharp point at the six-cornered intersection of Lincoln, Fullerton avenues and North Halsted Street on the triangular shaped lot.\n\u201cEven though we\u2019re limited to 36 units, we made the best of it and we designed as many multiple bedroom units as we could fit in that triangle,\u201d he said.\nThe deal comes on the heels of solid win from Wilwood and Contemporary Concepts in Lakeview.\nThe team sold a 95-unit, two-building complex known as the Low-Line Commons for $40 million to Utah-based Highland Partners The deal came out to about $421,000 per unit. Similar to the Lincoln Park sale, the deal came out to a 6 percent capitalization rate, according to Katsaros.\nHe has also\nbeen a buyer\nof late. Wildwood last month revealed it\u2019s pursuing an office-to-residential conversion of the seven-story loft building at 230 East Ohio Street that it bought for $9.75 million from\nHorizon Realty Group\n.\n",

        "content": "Houston\u2019s bid to publicly call out its worst apartment buildings hit a snag this week after pushback from landlords prompted the City Council to delay a vote.\nCouncil members postponed consideration of an ordinance meant to create a public registry of high-risk rental properties based on the number of habitability complaints filed through the city\u2019s 311 hotline, Houston Public Media first\nreported\n.\nThe proposal, introduced by council member Letitia Plummer, sought to build the registry by adding the five\nmultifamily\ncomplexes with the most complaints within six months. It would also subject any properties with 10 or more complaints to heightened inspections and potential fines.\nThe Houston Apartment Association led the opposition, arguing that the ordinance would unfairly penalize larger complexes and lacked sufficient due process.\nHAA CEO Casey Morgan criticized the speed with which the proposal was being advanced. The city attorney echoed some of those concerns, warning that the lack of an appeals process could make the program difficult to enforce.\nThe registry plan is a scaled-back version of a tougher proposal floated in May that would have registered every\nmultifamily property\nwith at least 10\nhabitability complaints\nover a year. Those include issues related to plumbing, electricity and structural safety \u2014 problems the city already inspects for buildings with three or more units.\nMayor John Whitmire\nacknowledged the difficulty in balancing tenant protection with a measure that\u2019s legally sound and practical to enforce.\n\u201cThe challenge is to get something that\u2019s tough enough and that actually is enforceable,\u201d Whitmire said.\nTenant advocacy groups have argued the plan doesn\u2019t go far enough. They suggested a public database to help renters steer clear of unsafe buildings and force negligent landlords to make repairs.\nPlummer, who\u2019s championed the effort for four years and is preparing to leave the council to run for Harris County Judge, expressed frustration over the delay and the likelihood of further revisions that could water-down its intent.\n\u201cI think the people that are living, actually experiencing the conditions, are going to hate it,\u201d Plummer told the outlet.\nThe council is expected to revisit the proposal Dec. 10.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Top condo developers Ugo Colombo and Camilo Miguel Jr. say another wave of New Yorkers is headed to South Florida following Zohran Mamdani\u2019s mayoral election win. But the influx will fall short of that during the pandemic, which propelled South Florida\u2019s market to new heights.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly top of mind for New Yorkers to move to South Florida,\u201d Miguel, founder and CEO of Coconut Grove-based Mast Capital, said at\nThe Real Deal\nMiami Real Estate Forum 2025 on Thursday.\nAt Miami Beach\u2019s 17-story, 82-unit Perigon condo tower, which Mast is co-developing with Barry Sternlicht\u2019s Starwood Capital Group, 10 buyer \u201cleads\u201d came in after Tuesday\u2019s election, more than the three to five that were more common pre-election, Miguel said. Also post-election, Colombo said he spoke with two New Yorkers who expressed their plan to move south.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be anything near what Covid brought to Miami,\u201d Colombo, founder of Miami-based\nCMC Group\n, said at the forum. \u201cThere will be an influx. I don\u2019t know how much it\u2019s going to swing the market.\u201d\nThe pair spoke during the panel \u201cPushing the Envelope: Where Top Developers Are Placing Their Biggest Bets\u201d on Thursday hosted by\nTRD\n\u2019s Residential Bureau Chief Katherine Kallergis. Both developers said they plan to heighten marketing of Miami condo projects to New York buyers.\nBut despite the potential boost of additional demand from New York, South Florida\u2019s condo development market continues to deal with some headwinds.\n\u201cThe market has softened in certain sectors. There\u2019s been a lot of product that\u2019s been presented to the market,\u201d Colombo said, adding that traditionally condo supply has outpaced demand in Miami. \u201cThere are \u2026 projects that have been presented that maybe couldn\u2019t get financing. It wasn\u2019t just the best.\u201d\nOver the past year, South Florida has experienced some reprieve on interest rates due to two benchmark rate drops this year, and insurance, thanks to a calmer hurricane season, and a drop in loan spreads, Miguel said. Construction costs, which had been elevated for years, calmed, but this drop was then undone by Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\u201cThe luxury market continues to remain strong,\u201d Miguel said. \u201cWe are seeing some commodity product that\u2019s maybe not moving at the pace the market would like to see. We cannot ignore some headwinds.\u201d\nLenders also became more conservative due to hefty condo construction and supply in South Florida. Some financiers, especially banks, also stepped back amid higher interest rates. The developers said that\u2019s mostly affected financing for mid-market projects, but not top-tier towers.\nColombo, whose CMC is starting construction on the 70-unit Four Seasons Private Residences in Coconut Grove on Thursday, said he had no problem financing the project.\n\u201cWe had many, many choices,\u201d he said. \u201cI am also looking at another project I haven\u2019t announced. It\u2019s a bigger, higher, taller building and there I see some resistance from lenders, on the middle market.\u201d\nColombo and Miguel both have embraced South Florida branded condo development craze.\nAside from the Four Seasons, Colombo also is developing the 65-unit\nVita at Grove Isle\non roughly 6 acres on the 20-acre Grove Isle in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove. Vita is its own standalone brand.\nCMC is partnering with Nadim Ashi\u2019s Fort Partners for the\nFour Seasons\n. Fort has exclusivity for the brand in South Florida.\nAside from the\nPerigon\n, Mast is developing the 80-story, 397-unit luxury\nCipriani Residences\nin Miami\u2019s Brickell. The Perigon is over 80 percent pre-sold, and Cipriani over 70 percent, Miguel said.\nMiguel said condo branding is one way \u201cto try to reduce friction and create revenue\u201d in the current development climate, along with location and design. For Colombo, differentiating his projects means not pinching pennies on finishes.\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at making the last penny. Look at making the customer happy because that eventually is going to pay off at the end,\u201d Colombo said.\nDuring the question and answer section of the panel, one South Florida transplant from New York, who said he moved south about four years ago, countered the developers\u2019 notion that\nMamdani\u2019s win\nwon\u2019t be as beneficial to Miami\u2019s market as the pandemic.\n\u201cYou guys need to build more buildings,\u201d the man said, adding that a huge population influx is coming.\nColombo, who during the panel pointed out the scarcity of developable sites on the ocean and in Brickell, said costs remain an issue for starting more projects.\n\u201cWe need to find a way to do it cheaper,\u201d he said.\n",

The building would feature a 334-room hotel and 364 residential units on the upper floors. A restaurant, bar, pool, meeting rooms, club room, fitness center, ballroom and a 112,600-square-foot entertainment venue are also planned.\nIt\u2019s the latest in a string of efforts to build on sites near AEG\u2019s L.A. Live.\nDeveloper City Century once proposed building a multi-tower complex at 1001 West Olympic Boulevard; a few years later, separate plans for a slim high-rise at the corner of Olympic Boulevard and Figueroa Street were approved.\nMore than a decade ago, AEG planned to build a Renaissance Hotel at 917 Olympic Boulevard in partnership with Williams &amp; Dame, and in 2016, it looked to build a 38-story expansion of the J.W. Marriott across the street. AEG abandoned the projects in subsequent years.\nThe latest push to build around L.A. Live comes after the\nCity Council gave its blessing\nin September to the $2.6 billion expansion of the Los Angeles Convention Center south of the L.A. Live entertainment complex.\nIn 2021, AEG extended its lease with the Los Angeles Lakers at the L.A. Live-adjacent\nCrypto.com Arena\nthrough 2041 and committed to extensive renovations there. The deal included an agreement from AEG to\nspend nine figures\nto improve and update the arena, adding to AEG\u2019s renovations at its other properties in the area.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A new lawsuit filed in Texas state court accuses syndicator\nAlan Stalcup\nof \u201ccooking the books\u201d at his company GVA, packaging bad debt as assets and bonds.\nThe plaintiffs accuse Stalcup, his wife Loren and GVA\u2019s former vice president David Graham Bass of an \u201cegregious criminal pattern of fraud, theft, and deceit.\u201d\nStalcup responded by calling the suit an \u201cextortion attempt from a disgruntled investor\u201d and said he would seek to countersue. Bass did not respond to a request for comment.\nStalcup and his firm GVA gained prominence as a syndicator, compiling funds from individual and institutional investors to buy up and manage underperforming apartment complexes. An investment would buy a management interest in one of the shell companies GVA used to buy property. Investors also paid management fees to GVA, according to the lawsuit.\nStalcup\u2019s bet that he could fix up the multifamily buildings worked out while interest rates were low. But when rates surged, syndicators broadly struggled to keep up with their loans.\nStalcup and the other defendants then conspired to inflate rental income and profits, plaintiffs allege. They re-packaged bad debt, concessions and operating expenses as assets and capital expenses, making the properties look more profitable, and thus valuable.\n\u201cIn 2023 alone, the GVA Defendants falsely overstated the reported rental income across its entire portfolio by over $20.6 million, which in turn served to inflate values of the properties in its portfolio by hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d plaintiffs wrote in their petition.\nIn one example cited in the suit, financial documents purportedly show one property\u2019s monthly net operating income boosted by $133,558. GVA oversaw approximately 150 properties.\nThe alleged fraud also entitled the defendants to charge higher management fees, according to the lawsuit. The petition excerpts internal GVA financial documents that show instructions to move money out of concessions and delinquency categories.\nThe suit was filed by a group of investment entities: Hill Country Hillside, Ltd, River Retreat 1228 LLC, Hill Country Meridian LLC and Sierra HC LLC. At least two of the plaintiff companies are connected to Texas commercial real estate investor Bryan Kastleman. They claim they lost more than $15 million after being fraudulently induced to invest in GVA-managed companies connected to ten real estate projects and portfolios.\nThe plaintiffs claim Stalcup resorted to another scheme to keep the company going when things got tight. After interest rates surged and GVA\u2019s debt obligations became unmanageable, Stalcup made capital calls, plaintiffs allege. Those calls led plaintiffs to believe that the funds Stalcup and his codefendants were requesting would be used to stabilize properties and meet debt obligations.\nBut after they invested, they say that wasn\u2019t the case. Instead of stabilizing the properties, the defendants allegedly made up their own personal losses. In one instance, Stalcup misappropriated about $3.4 million to repay GVA\u2019s own bridge loans, according to the lawsuit.\nThe lawsuit is just the latest for Stalcup and GVA.\nIn February, lender\nBenefit Street Partners alleged GVA\nmisappropriated insurance proceeds and commingled tenant security deposits. Those \u201cbad boy\u201d acts activate the personal guarantees that Stalcup signed on a $346 million loan from Benefit Street, backed by 19 multifamily properties, the lender argued in court. Stalcup denied the lender\u2019s allegations, calling them \u201cfarcical and utterly outrageous.\u201d He said the loans had been paid back or were performing. The suit is still pending.\nThis summer, Barry Sternlicht\u2019s Starwood\nslapped Stalcup\nwith a trio of lawsuits. The lender said the sponsor let liens pile up on several properties and failed to pay interest, triggering personal recourse guarantees. Those suits are also pending.\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s turning into a fall to forget for New York City\u2019s new development market.\nThe city recorded 215 contracts in October, down roughly 30 percent from the same period the prior year, according to a Marketproof\nreport\n.\nIt has been the third straight month where new development contracts failed to beat last year\u2019s numbers. During that time period, the segment\u2019s\ncontract volume has fallen\nby roughly 19 percent.\nWhile demand overall in the city remained strong, the new development market has continued to suffer from a\nlack of new inventory\nwith which to entice buyers. In Brooklyn in particular, there have been just 146 new units launched in the past two months, down from 240 units launched during September and October of last year.\nThe top-selling development in the borough in October was\nOne Domino Square\n, which reported seven contracts. The 160-unit condo tower, which launched sales in May 2024, has reported 94 units sold, according to Marketproof.\nThe condos are a part of Two Trees\u2019 Williamsburg mixed-use waterfront project, which also includes a 399-unit rental tower. An in-house team helmed by Aaron Goed has led sales.\nManhattan has launched comparatively more units last month, with new developments putting up 259 units for sale from notable developers and buildings, including the Brodsky Organization\u2019s and Sorgente Group\u2019s 38-unit conversion at the\nFlatiron Building\nand Related Companies\u2019 144-unit Upper East Side project called the Strathmore.\nThe top-selling project was Izaki Group Investment\u2019s 68-unit project at 525 Sixth Avenue in Greenwich Village. The development, dubbed Village West, reported nine contracts in October and eight in September.\nCore Group Marketing\u2019s Doron Zwickel and Caleb Nickels are leading sale, according to StreetEasy.\nThe borough also saw two of the most expensive condos on the market report contracts in October, with unit 121 at Central Park Tower inking a deal with a\nlast asking price of $55 million\nand 53 West 53rd Street getting signed with a\nlast asking price of $47 million\n.\nThe market for homes asking at least $4 million was still down, with 43 contracts signed compared to 58 signed last year.\nIn Queens, there were just 12 contracts signed, down from 35 last year.\nCentury Development Group\u2019s Vesta development has led the borough in signed contracts every month since launching sales in April, adding three more deals in October. Serhant\u2019s Kayla Lee and Serhant New Development Marketing are leading sales.\n",

        "content": "Buyers of luxury homes in Miami are demanding costlier designs and flipping their properties more than they did a decade ago, according to panelists who spoke Wednesday at\nThe Real Deal\nMiami Real Estate Forum 2025.\n\u201cDoing architecture in Miami allows us to do those outdoor spaces that, in other parts of the country, you wouldn\u2019t be able to do,\u201d said panelist Ralph Choeff, founding partner of Miami-based Choeff Levy Fischman Architecture + Design. But now, luxury home buyers want more.\n\u201cClients today are more demanding,\u201d Choeff said. \u201cThey want the all-in-one house that they never have to leave for any reason. So, in their house, if you can get a bowling alley, you get a bowling alley. If you can get a shooting range, you get a shooting range \u2026 The client of the \u201890s and the client of the 2000s is not the same client in \u201925.\u201d\nDesign is commanding greater attention as more buyers seek primary residences in Miami, not just second homes, said panelist\nPascal Nicolai,\na Miami-based spec developer of luxury homes. \u201cThe best house is the one you want to stay inside and live in forever,\u201d he said. \u201cWe try to make spec houses very personal \u2026. The idea is, when you go into the house, you feel the vibe.\u201d\nHowever, as residential property values escalate, some buyers are selling custom-designed luxury homes soon after buying them, said panelist\nMax Strang\n, founder and managing partner of Miami-based Strang Design.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be working with an owner, an end user, for several years, designing, permitting, building. They move in, the Realtors swarm them, and they end up selling their forever house,\u201d Strang said.\n\u201cProbably four or five of our clients thought they were going to be living in their house, and they love it, but sometimes the money talks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that a lot because of the increase in property values.\u201d\nThe panelists agreed that some buyers demand luxury home designs that are more expensive than they can afford.\n\u201cIf we sense that there is an impossible matchup of budget and program, you have to have those decisions [made] upfront, so we\u2019re not wasting everybody\u2019s time and everybody\u2019s money,\u201d Strang said.\nYet many wealthy buyers are willing to pay more than architects expect to get the home and location they want, Choeff said, citing his work on a Miami Beach mansion for former soccer star\nDavid Beckham\n, president and co-owner of Inter Miami CF.\n\u201cThe buyers of today will spend a lot more money than you think they will,\u201d he said. \u201cCertain residences are put up at a certain price, and you say, \u2018I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll get this price, but we\u2019ll settle for this price.\u2019 But they get it. And an example is, Beckham spent $72.3 million on a house we designed on North Bay Road.\u201d\nPast trends in residential architecture in Miami have included a preference for Art Deco and\nMediterranean\ndesigns, and new trends are emerging, the panelists said.\n\u201cIt was probably the very late \u201890s and early 2000s when Modernism started to creep back in and was accepted and desired. A lot of that can get bastardized right now,\u201d Strang said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going straight back to the Mediterranean Revival,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are going to be more traditional influences coming in. But the challenge for us is to make it design forward.\u201d",

        "content": "Macquarie Capital | Principal Finance and Vanderbilt Office Properties sold a multifamily development site approved for nearly 300 units in Boca Raton for $21.2 million.\nNADG, or North American Development Group, bought the 6.8-acre site at 1800 North Military Trail, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The land shares the same lot as a four-story building and a garage that are part of the Boca Center office campus. Macquarie and Vanderbilt kept the office building and garage.\nNADG, which has offices in West Palm Beach and Toronto, Ontario, is a retail, residential and mixed-use investment firm that John W. S. Preston founded in 1977, its website shows. Jeff W. Preston is CEO. The firm has a portfolio consisting of more than $6 billion of assets under management, including roughly 10,000 units and over 19 million square feet of retail and mixed-use space.\nThe Boca Raton site is proposed for a six-story building with 295 apartments, including 30 units at affordable rents and 15 units at workforce rents, Vizzda data shows. It would have six studios, 134 one-bedroom apartments, 113 two-bedroom apartments and 42 three-bedroom apartments. The height is proposed for 66 feet, which generally would mean a roughly six-story building.\nAbout half the site would be open space.\nMacquarie and Vanderbilt bought the majority of\nBoca Center\n, including the lot at 1800 North Military Trail, for\n$261.5 million\nin 2022. The pair had paid $76.1 million for the 1800 North Military Trail site.\nMacquarie is the financing and investment division of Sydney, Australia-based Macquarie Group, led by CEO Shemara Wikramanayake.\nChicago-based Vanderbilt is an office investor led by CEO Casey Wold. It has a portfolio of 13 million square feet, its website shows.\nSouth Florida is experiencing continuing\nmultifamily\ndevelopment, despite a supply overhang due to hefty completions in recent years. Last year, developers finished\n18,600 apartments\nin the tri-county region, outpacing 15,000 net new leases, according to CoStar Group.\nThe construction spree has raised concerns about a prolonged supply overhang, which could continue downward pressure on rent growth and continuing concessions, experts have said. But developers argue that by the time they finish their buildings, the current supply will be absorbed and demand will be higher.\nAlso in Boca Raton, Group P6 and Mill Creek Residential plan the 12-story, 306-unit\nModera Boca\nat 400 South Dixie Highway. Arnaud Karsenti\u2019s 13th Floor Investments scored approval in January for the eight-story, 340-unit Boca Village apartment project at 680 West Yamato Road in Boca Raton.\nMany developers have seized on the Live Local Act, a state law that rewards developers with property tax breaks if they include below-market rate apartments. The legislation also allows developers to build bigger buildings than permitted by zoning.\nIn Coral Gables, Shoma Group plans the 16-story, 201-unit\nPonce 8\nat 3808-3850 Southwest Eighth Street, marking the first known Live Local Act project in the city.\n",

        "content": "Local labor groups are fighting the City of Berkeley\u2019s approval of what would be the\ntallest residential tower\nin the Southside neighborhood.\nThe Building and Construction Trades of Alameda County and the Northern California Carpenters Regional Council have appealed the city\u2019s approvals for a 20-story, 169-unit project at 2425 Durant Avenue, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The unions argue that Yes Duffy Architects improperly sidestepped recently enacted municipal laws in proposing the new,\nstudent-oriented housing\n.\nThe groups are targeting exemptions from Berkeley\u2019s Helping Achieve Responsible Development with Healthcare and Apprenticeship Training Standards (HARD HATS) ordinance as well as the Southside\nprevailing wage requirement\n, both of which took effect this year. The unions say the city allowing Yes Duffy to avoid providing healthcare and apprenticeships for its workers and to not pay the general prevailing wage were a \u201cmisuse\u201d of the laws.\n\u201cThe trades council and Carpenters have never encountered such concession requests before and are not aware of any project that has received similar concessions from the city (or any city),\u201d Jolene Kramer, legal counsel for the unions, said in a letter to the city.\nIn response, Mark Rhoades, a consultant working on the project, said the construction labor requirements would add \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d to the overall project costs. Total labor costs alone would purportedly increase around 20 to 25 percent.\n\u201cIt\u2019s another attempt by the unions to create positions for themselves that make housing a lot more expensive to build, particularly in Berkeley, where the fees are the highest in the state,\u201d Rhoades said.\nWhen the HARD HATS\nordinance\nwas introduced in 2023, many developers balked at the law and the costs that it would tack on to many projects. As a result, City Hall was flooded with preliminary applications under SB 330 to lock in earlier, less restrictive zoning standards. The Southside prevailing wage requirements went into effect early last year after the City Council\u2019s upzoning of the Southside neighborhood.\nThe 2425 Durant Avenue project will go before the Berkeley City Council in February when council members will vote on whether to reject or accept the unions\u2019 appeal. The City Council already rejected an attempt to designate the site, currently hosting a Victorian home and two other residential buildings dating back more than a century, as a historic landmark earlier this year.\nYes Duffy Architects plans to start construction in January 2028 once design and building permits are secured.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The sellers are classic car enthusiasts Don and Paulette Clark. A car showroom takes up half of the property\u2019s 12,500 square feet, which made it difficult to price, said listing agent Holly Haven of eXp Realty.\n\u201cOn traditional\nMLS\nand marketing, it was like finding a needle in a haystack to find that perfect buyer,\u201d Haven said. \u201cWe also listed right before election time last year, so, being in real estate 20-plus years, I know that that can definitely slow down a market.\u201d\nAlthough the home is in a secluded area, more homes are planned for surrounding lots, which prospective sellers had to take into account, Haven said.\nThe auction was arranged by\nFlorida-based firm Elite Auctions\n. The property spent over a year on the MLS before Elite accepted it and began marketing.\nA local oil and gas executive bought the property with a cash offer, Haven said. The sale price wasn\u2019t disclosed, but the buyer\u2019s offer was \u201cclose to asking price,\u201d Elite Auctions market director Alicia Chmielewski said.\nThe nearby\nMcKinney National Airport\nalso attracted the buyer, who has\nprivate planes\n, Haven said.\nThe luxury market is gradually rebounding from an\nexceptionally low period\nnationwide. Year over year, the median luxury home price rose 5 percent in September; however, September luxury sales are near the lowest levels on record, going back to 2012, according to\nRedfin\n.\nDallas tracks these national trends.

        "content": "Would you rather vote for a candidate who credibly defends a position or one who is, well, chicken shit?\nIt\u2019s a loaded question, but relevant when it comes to real estate.\nWhen Republican Kristy Marmorato defeated Democrat Marjorie Vel\u00e1zquez for an East Bronx City Council seat in 2023, some feared that Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s support for a\ncontroversial development\nwould make other Council members hesitant to defy NIMBY activists in their districts.\nThen\nMarmorato herself lost\non Tuesday, falling to a Democratic challenger. Pro-housing group Open New York had\nendorsed her challenger\n, but in all likelihood, the incumbent\u2019s defeat had little to do with her anti-development stances, such as her insistence on\npreserving parking minimums\nin the rezonings around planned Metro-North stations.\nAnti-Trump fervor just made this a bad year for Republican candidates, just as 2023 was a good one. Marmorato won her seat because of fortuitous timing, not because she opposed the rezoning of Bruckner Boulevard.\nMarmorato\u2019s subsequent loss should put to rest the notion that city voters reward politicians for being anti-development. They simply don\u2019t. In another example, neighborhood NIMBYs tried to oust Democrat Shahana Hanif from a Brooklyn Council seat in June and\nfailed miserably\n.\nThe Bronx seat\u2019s flipping to a Republican and then back to a Democrat had far more to do with voters\u2019 feelings about inflation (2023) and about President Donald Trump (2025) than with development issues.\nGenerally speaking, city voters favor development, even if the loudest voices in a room don\u2019t. The results of this year\u2019s\nCity Charter ballot questions\nspeak to that.\nThat said, rarely do development issues decide candidates\u2019 fates. Eric Adams has been the most pro-development mayor in memory (yes, including Mike Bloomberg), but because of unrelated scandals, his re-election campaign never got out of the starting gate.\nHad Adams kowtowed to NIMBYs, he would have little to show for his mayoralty. At least he can look back and say he paved the way for growth and housing affordability.\nFor me, the lesson for elected officials is not to be paranoid and reactive on real estate issues, but to take positions based on what is best for the city. It\u2019s almost certainly not going to hurt you in the next election \u2014 and if you make a strong case for your stances, voters will appreciate it.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nCommercial broker Scott Panzer was fired by JLL for comparing Zohran Mamdani to Hitler,\nTRD\n\u2019s Rich Bockmann and Kathryn Brenzel\nreported\n. Separately, a former New Yorker now in Texas told me he would never return to the city because of Mamdani\u2019s election, which had left two of his New York City friends in tears. Are people overreacting? Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Building four Metro-North stations in the East Bronx is not the hard part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s Penn Station Access project. \u201cThe hard part is a massive rehabilitation project on Amtrak\u2019s Hell Gate Line \u2026 which is in rough shape,\u201d the MTA\u2019s latest construction newsletter explains. It identifies the \u201ccentral tension\u201d as Amtrak\u2019s ownership of the right-of-way and its inability to provide enough service outages, support staff or operational resources to keep work on schedule.\nElsewhere\u2026\nThe impact of Mamdani\u2019s election on the \u201c\nConstruction Justice Act\n\u201d is worth watching. The bill would set a higher minimum wage for workers on city-funded affordable housing projects. That\u2019s the kind of thing socialists support, because they want the government rather than market forces to decide workers\u2019 pay and benefits. And I would think the Council would prefer to let Mamdani sign the bill than to override a veto by Mayor Adams.\nAnother factor is that Mamdani likes unions, and unions like the bill because the government would be raising wages \u2014 saving organized labor the trouble, or achieving what labor has been unable to through organizing and negotiating.\nThe Council did the same thing last month for\nsecurity workers\non behalf of 32BJ SEIU, using the\nkilling of a guard\nat 345 Park Avenue to defeat the real estate industry\u2019s lobbying efforts.\nBut the mayoralty isn\u2019t the only office changing. Council Speaker Adrienne Adams will have to decide whether to push the construction bill through before her tenure ends. Then she could take the credit, while leaving the inevitable legal challenge for her successor to deal with.\nThe obvious conflict for Mamdani is that the bill would make affordable housing more expensive to build.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$9.5 million\nfor a 2901-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at 50 West 66th Street in Lincoln Square. Beth Benalloul and Hilary Landis of The Corcoran Group had the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$26.4 million\nfor a 16,937-square-foot property at 160 West 74th Street on the Upper West Side. The previous owner tied to Bayrock Capital purchased the property from The Calhoun School for\n$14 million in 2023\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$30 million\nfor a 6,600-square-foot, single family townhouse at 4 Staple Street in Tribeca. Jeremy V. Stein and Kat Trappe with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permits filed were for two 14-story buildings at 335 and 345 West 25th Street in Kips Bay. They will have a combined 197 units (98 and 99). David West of Hill West filed the permits on behalf of Timber Equities.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "The Aflalo family hopes to sell four parcels entitled for a combined 368 residential units in Beverly Hills, according to a new offering memorandum from Westmack Commercial Brokerage Company.\nThe parcels, all builder\u2019s remedy projects clustered at West Olympic Boulevard and South Beverly Drive, are listed from $20 million to $87 million, with a combined value of $132 million.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the largest commercial land offerings in Beverly Hills history,\u201d Westmack\u2019s T.C. Macker said.\nPlans call for 74 affordable units spread over the four projects, along with 37,276 square feet of ground-floor retail, and parking.\nSites include 333-337 South Beverly Drive and\n353 South Beverly Drive\n, approved for an eight-story building with 135 residential units, 16,099 square feet of ground-floor retail, and three levels of subterranean parking with 263 parking spaces; and the Pavilions grocery store site at\n9467 West Olympic Boulevard\n, with an eight-story building with 105 residential units, 17,085 square feet of retail, and three levels of subterranean parking with 180 parking spaces. Those sites are priced as a package at $87 million.\nSammy Aflalo\nof Aflalo Equities helmed the entitlement process of the two sites. Sammy Aflalo is the son of Moshe and Laura Aflalo, whose\nAflalo Family Trust\ngrew a portfolio of stores in L.A.\u2019s Fashion District in the 1990s. The sites are\nco-owned\nwith Harkham Family Enterprises, run by Uri Harkham, also a prominent property holder in the Fashion District and well beyond.\nThe offering also includes\n9430 West Olympic Boulevard\n, approved for a 13-story mixed-use building with 53 residential units and three levels of subterranean parking with 23 parking spaces. The tower would replace a three-story commercial building built in 1989. It has an asking price of $20 million.\nAlso part of the offering is 9441 West Olympic Boulevard, approved for a 13-story building with 75 residential units, 4,092 square feet of ground-floor retail, and three levels of subterranean parking with 52 parking spaces. Its asking price is $25 million.\nAflalo Equities, in a joint venture with Fisch Property, the property management arm of the family business, led the entitlement process for 9430 Olympic Boulevard and 9441 West Olympic Boulevard.\nBuilder\u2019s remedy is a loophole in state housing law that lets developers skirt zoning rules in cities that fail to certify their state housing plans, as long as they include at least 20 percent affordable housing.\n\u201cThese approvals, granted under builder\u2019s remedy, allow for height, [floor area ratio] and unit counts that far exceed surrounding properties,\u201d said Westmack\u2019s Macker, who holds the listing for the properties.\nAs of Oct. 30 there were 14 active builder\u2019s remedy applications before the City of Beverly Hills, according to Ryan Gohlich, assistant city manager in Beverly Hills.\nBeverly Hills Mayor Sharona Nazarian said on the general topic of builder\u2019s remedy that there\u2019s a mismatch between policy intent and market outcomes.\n\u201cWhat was intended as a tool to create more affordable housing has, in practice, often been used to push through ultra-luxury, high-density projects, and with only a small fraction of them being actual affordable units,\u201d Nazarian told\nThe Real Deal\nat the end of October. \u201cAnd it\u2019s unclear whether there\u2019s sufficient demand for so many expensive luxury units. Prices continue to rise, and the average renter or young families or young professionals, they\u2019re still being priced out.\u201d\nMacker touted the offering for its \u201cscale, prime location, and significance in a market known for its limited supply.\u201d\nProlific developer\nLeo Pustilnikov\n, who received approval for a builder\u2019s remedy project at\n125-129 South Linden Drive\nand is a partner in another such project at 346 North Maple Drive, said he is not interested in the Aflalo family\u2019s offering.\n\u201cIt\u2019s massively overpriced\u2026 and [there\u2019s an] issue with the lease for Pavilions,\u201d Pustilnikov said.\n",

        "content": "The City of Beverly Hills has rejected a proposed builder\u2019s remedy project after allowing other projects in the enclave to proceed, citing concerns over socioeconomic segregation as a factor.\nThe Beverly Hills Planning Commission rejected the proposal from developer Crescent Heights to turn a currently empty lot at\n8844 Burton Way\ninto a\n26-story building\nwith 38 studio, two- and three-bedroom apartments, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n. As part of its plan, the tower would have 22 units of affordable housing for extremely-low-income and moderate-income households in order to be eligible for the builder\u2019s remedy.\nDespite staff and the city attorney recommending approval, commissioners voted 3\u20132 to reject it, jumping on claims from Commissioner Gary Ross that the project violated anti-segregation laws by concentrating the affordable units on the lower floors.\nCrescent Heights\u2019 proposal was one of several\nbuilder\u2019s remedy projects reluctantly accepted\nfor review after Beverly Hills didn\u2019t process them for more than a year. Unlike others that squeaked through, this one met fierce pushback.\nPrior to the Wednesday meeting where the city brought down the hammer on Crescent Heights\u2019 proposal, the developer reworked its plan to spread affordable units across more levels, trimming two stories off the height and offering translucent balcony designs to concerns about the building\u2019s size and privacy. Still, commissioners weren\u2019t convinced.\nThe design changes were contingent on an agreement for the City Council to not bring up the proposal for review and attempt to impose further conditions. The plan would have also been voided in the event of an appeal, which at least one neighbor vowed to do. As a result, a majority of commissioners were dissuaded from accepting a proposal with a contingency, citing opposition from neighbors and the scale of the project as reasons for their rejection.\nUnder its\nhousing element\n, the city of Beverly Hills must plan to build 3,104 new housing units by the end of the decade.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The\nvillage\nexpects to close on the purchase in February, paying with cash reserves drawn from various municipal funds.\nThe move marks a sharp turn from prior redevelopment attempts.\nIn 2020, Glenview blocked Dermody Properties\u2019 $24 million proposal for a three-building warehouse complex amid opposition to adding heavy truck traffic near residential neighborhoods.\nA subsequent concept calling for 138 homes also failed to gain traction. Jeff Brady, Glenview\u2019s community development director, said those concepts didn\u2019t fit the village\u2019s \u201cbest long-term interest.\u201d\nBy buying the land outright, the village gains control of the site\u2019s destiny amid a\nsuburban real estate market\nstruggling to repurpose vacant corporate campuses.\nDozens of similar sites across the region have gone industrial since the pandemic, as office demand cratered and warehouse absorption surged. Glenview, however, appears determined to favor open-space and civic uses over logistics or large-scale residential density.\nNot everyone is on board.\nSeveral residents questioned the wisdom of committing millions in taxpayer funds without a public referendum or detailed plan, with one resident asking why and when did the village get into the real estate speculation business.\nThe planning process is expected to begin in spring, with first-phase construction targeted for summer 2027.\nTrustee Adam Sidoti called it \u201cthe largest investment in this community since The Glen,\u201d a reference to the transformative redevelopment of the former Naval Air Station that remade central\nGlenview\ntwo decades ago.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

That\u2019s under $96,000 per key for the property at 909 North Michigan Avenue.\nThe seller of the 752-key property is Pebblebrook Hotel Trust, a Maryland-based REIT that\u2019s been marketing the hotel since last year.\nThe sale extends a string of bargain-basement deals downtown as rising rates and lagging business travel weigh on hotel values. The purchase price amounts to less than a 5 percent cap rate, a source told the outlet, but Amin declined to confirm.\nPebblebrook acquired the Westin in 2018 through its $715 million buyout of LaSalle Hotel Properties, valuing it then at about $156 million. Before that, LaSalle bought the property in 2006 for nearly $215 million and poured $49 million into upgrades including guest rooms, public space renovations and upgrades to building systems that began in 2012.\nPebblebrook sold the hotel\u2019s ground-floor retail space for $27 million last year, but the pending sale of the hotel itself would mark a painful write-down for the REIT.\nAmin\u2019s move follows a similar opportunistic play earlier this year, when one of his entities paid $28.3 million for the dual-branded Hampton Inn/Homewood Suites\nMag Mile\n, well below its pre-pandemic value. His Schaumburg-based IT firm VinaKom has helped bankroll a growing hospitality portfolio run through\nVinayaka Hospitality\n, managed by his wife, Komal Patel.\nThe group\u2019s holdings stretch from the Westin North Shore in Wheeling to multiple Marriott and Hilton-branded hotels around\nO\u2019Hare\nand Oak Brook.\nJLL brokers Adam McGaughy and John Nugent are marketing the Westin on Pebblebrook\u2019s behalf and previously pitched it as a redevelopment candidate.\nWhen its Marriott Westin franchise and management deals expire next year, a buyer could rebrand or even split the property into dual flags, as it includes a two aging highrises that opened about a decade apart: a 15-story west tower that opened in 1963 and an adjoining 26-story east tower completed in 1972.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Success was never a guarantee, and it didn\u2019t happen overnight, but Miami\u2019s market is ripe for brokers seeking momentum.\nThat was the consensus among Danny Hertzberg, Margit Brandt and Dawn McKenna, some of Florida\u2019s top brokers in conversation at\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nMiami Real Estate Forum 2025 on Thursday. Each of them had already put years into their real estate careers by the time the pandemic triggered a boom in their respective markets: Miami, Palm Beach and Naples.\nThey were well-positioned to receive the flood of wealthy buyers, but in a panel discussion exploring how they became agents with $100-million-plus listings, they described more humble beginnings.\nBrandt\n, a Palm Beach agent with Premier Estate Properties who has closed more than $1 billion in deals since 2022, discussed cutting her teeth as a 21-year-old agent in New York too young to be taken seriously.\nHertzberg\n, the son of Miami real estate doyenne\nJill Hertzberg\n, told the story of pivoting from a legal career to real estate just in time for the global financial crisis to rock South Florida\u2019s market in 2009.\nMcKenna\npivoted from her career as a Chicago-based interior designer and today runs Coldwell Banker Realty\u2019s Dawn McKenna Group in Naples, Park City, Chicago, Lake Geneva, Wisconsin and New Buffalo and Harbor Country in Michigan. Her team has closed nearly $800 million in sales this year, a volume that took years to build.\n\u201cFrom 2003 to 2017, I was just an agent with two assistants doing $150 million a year,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you get nothing from me, get this: Just go for it.\u201d\nThe three brokers are now well versed in working at the absolute upper echelons of the luxury real estate market. Brandt brought the buyer in the\n$150 million sale of Palm Beach\u2019s Tarpon Island\nlast year. Hertzberg had the listing on a La Gorce Island assemblage consumer goods mogul Anand Khubani bought for\n$100 million\n. McKenna helped broker\na record $225 million\nsale in Naples in April, and has the listing for the Naples estate Gordon Pointe, which hit the market last year asking\n$295 million\n.\n\u201cWe\u2019re off market making adjustments right now,\u201d she said of Gordon Pointe. \u201cI will tell you we\u2019ve had 26 showings\u2026 It\u2019s a cornucopia of people.\u201d\nSouth Florida\u2019s typical buyer demographic has expanded from Northeasterners, Midwesterners and Californians to include more international buyers from a greater range of territories, the agents said. With Zohran Mamdani\u2019s mayoral victory in New York, the trio agreed another wave of wealthy buyers would make moves to South Florida, citing concerns about safety and quality of life.\nMcKenna noted that a New York client of hers who previously bought a $40 million condo with her was planning to tour homes with her in Naples after Thanksgiving. Brandt said sellers are already responding to the increasing demand.\n\u201cThe sellers are acutely aware. I had a lot of sellers be like, \u2018He won, we\u2019re increasing the price 20 percent,\u2019\u201d she said. But the Mamdani victory hasn\u2019t slammed the brakes on New York\u2019s market like Florida\u2019s brokers predicted, she said. \u201cI\u2019m talking to friends in New York who are still saying they\u2019re seeing contracts signed.\u201d\nHertzberg confirmed that within weeks of the June primary that anointed Mamdani as the Democratic candidate, a New York-based client of his who had a deposit down on a $10 million property canceled his contract and bought a home in Miami.\n\u201cWe all received a lot of calls yesterday,\u201d he said. But, \u201cmost of them were people venting.\u201d",

The family still owes about $10.1 million, according to court filings.\nStillwater is asking the court to authorize a public auction if the debt isn\u2019t repaid.\nThe nine-story, 31,000-square-foot building sits between Second and Third avenues and houses Sky Management, the firm that operates many of the Ohebshaloms\u2019 apartment holdings.

The Ohebshaloms have also racked up numerous city violations across their multifamily portfolio for elevator breakdowns and other maintenance issues.\nJonathan Ohebshalom, reached at Sky Management, declined to comment to the publication.\nThe Midtown property has changed hands \u2014 mostly within the family \u2014 over the years. Records show the Ohebshaloms acquired it in 2007 for $7.7 million through Majestic Realty Associates, then sold a 50 percent interest to Gemini Partners Realty for $7.3 million in 2016; Fred Ohebshalom was listed as manager of both entities.\nSterling National Bank originated the $12.6 million mortgage in 2018, which was later assigned to Stillwater after Webster Bank\u2019s merger with Sterling in 2022.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Real estate industry experts pushed back on the theory that a bubble is forming in Miami that\u2019s about to burst.\n\u201cThis market is built on cash,\u201d said market analyst Ana Bozovic, founder of Analytics Miami, at\nThe Real Deal\u2019\ns Miami Real Estate Forum. Bozovic spoke on a panel about how developers can survive the market crunch in Miami in a conversation moderated by\nTRD\u2019s\nEditor-in-Chief Stuart Elliott.\nBozovic said a UBS report that named Miami as the most vulnerable city\nto a bubble\nwas an \u201cegregious misrepresentation of truth\u201d because it\u2019s such a heavy cash market.\n\u201cUsually when assets collapse, it\u2019s because there\u2019s a collapse. The bubble pops when the underlying assets can no longer sustain the debt, and it all goes away, kind of like a flammable house of cards,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have this setup.\u201d\nDan Kodsi, CEO of Royal Palm Companies, said Miami isn\u2019t overbuilt like it was in 2008.\n\u201cThe issue is we\u2019re building product that\u2019s expensive, and because of construction costs, when you\u2019re building high-rise especially, you have to sell it at a very high price per foot,\u201d Kodsi said.\nThe lack of affordable housing is pushing locals to markets like Orlando, Kodsi added.\n\u201cEvery part of Florida, you\u2019re seeing grow,\u201d he said.\nThe panelists also address the\nexpected wave of migration\nof New Yorkers to South Florida following Zohran Mamdani winning the mayoral race in New York.\n\u201cI think the expectation that you\u2019re going to see something immediately, like, the press keeps kind of glorifying like, \u2018oh, tomorrow, there\u2019s gonna be a million people moving here,\u2019\u201d said fellow speaker Brad Meltzer, president of Two Roads Development. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen, but it\u2019s going to happen after a matter of time. Some people have families. They have kids. You don\u2019t just pick up and move tomorrow, but the investigation process is going to start to happen.\u201d\nKodsi and Meltzer both suggested resolutions ahead for separate projects they\u2019re involved in that are tied up in litigation.\nFor Two Roads, the Florida Supreme Court\nrecently denied the developer\na request for a rehearing in a condo buyout case involving the Biscayne 21 building in Miami\u2019s Edgewater, effectively ending the developer\u2019s legal options. The group of holdout owners, who Meltzer called \u201ca little bit greedy,\u201d successfully challenged the developer\u2019s amendment to lower the condo termination requirement once it had control over the association.\nMeltzer insisted the Edition Residences project that\u2019s planned for the site \u201cwill happen.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll take a little bit more time,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s been discussions behind the scenes with that, but it\u2019ll get resolved. It has to resolve itself. When something is valuable enough, parties have to compromise like anything else in life, and there\u2019ll be a compromise that takes place, and everybody will feel that they can get a good deal, and we\u2019ll move on.\u201d\nKodsi is tied up in a\nforeclosure lawsuit\nover the Legacy Hotel &amp; Residences project at Miami Worldcenter. He told the court in July he is working on a $390 million refinancing for the project.\nA court order bans Kodsi from talking about the lawsuit, but he said it\u2019s \u201con a path for starting construction again.\u201d\n\u201cThat ugly dumpling, let\u2019s say, is going to be a beautiful swan when she\u2019s built, a great project,\u201d Kodsi said.\n",

        "content": "Long considered a linear slog, developing affordable housing just became a little more choose-your-own-adventure.\nBuilders of a 100 percent, publicly-funded project can seek approval from the Board of Standards and Appeals, rather than going through the city\u2019s land use review process.\nA rezoning that would add 30 percent more residential space in a medium-density district can go through a speedier review that bypasses the City Council.\nAnd the prospect of facing off with a City Council member who is sure to reject a project doesn\u2019t automatically mean a developer should abandon all hope.\nThe passage\nthis week\nof three housing ballot measures that create different avenues for approving housing projects and, in some cases, bypass or challenge the City Council\u2019s authority, significantly shifts the power dynamics around land-use decisions. Their effectiveness will hinge on several factors, including staffing levels at housing agencies, capital available for housing and the relationship between the next mayor and City Council leaders.\nBut developers, attorneys and officials are already thinking about what these changes mean for housing construction in the near- and long-term.\nTake it to the board\nOne of the measures replaces the mayoral veto with a three-person appeals board that can reverse City Council rejections. The board can only act on projects that add affordable housing and that only affect one borough.\nTypically, the City Council aligns with the local member on land-use issues, a\ntradition\nknown as member deference. Mayors rarely veto land-use decisions, knowing that a Council supermajority will likely overturn them.\nThe appeals board disrupts this dynamic, potentially encouraging developers to pursue projects in districts hostile to development.\nBut proponents say the appeals board doesn\u2019t mean developers will go from trying to win over local Council members to sidestepping them entirely.\n\u201cWho says it is easier to get three people to say yes?\u201d asked lobbyist Suri Kasirer.\nThe goal will remain trying to figure out how to get the City Council to a \u201cyes\u201d on a project, she said. Dismissing the local Council member and community concerns entirely also likely won\u2019t endear a developer to the mayor, borough president or City Council speaker. They too have to consider threats to reelection and maintaining a relationship with the Council.\n\u201cAnybody would be stupid not to take the local Council member seriously,\u201d she said.\nRachel Fee, executive director of the New York Housing Conference, agreed that the appeals board likely won\u2019t be called upon very often. She believes it will instead push City Council members to reach a deal with developers before it gets to that point.\nKen Fisher, a land-use attorney with Cozen O\u2019Connor, said one of the biggest impacts of the appeals board is that it makes borough presidents more important to the process. Under the city\u2019s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, borough presidents serve an advisory role; their opinions on projects, while they may be influential, are not binding.\nBorough presidents may rejoice at this shift \u2014 in fact, most of them supported it. Their inclusion on the appeals board restores some of the authority these officials once had as part of the land use review process, when Ulurp ended with the city Board of Estimates. In 1989, that board was disbanded, and the City Council was given the final word on projects that go through Ulurp.\nFisher sees the borough president as the board\u2019s swing vote. If the City Planning Commission signs off on a rezoning, presumably, the proposal has the mayor\u2019s support. The City Council speaker, meanwhile, is going to be reluctant to overrule a local Council member, he said.\nThis might mean that developers who think they can win over the borough president will be more emboldened to move forward with a project.\n\u201cI think that there\u2019s a universe of projects that are stillborn because either the developers think they can never get it past the local Council member, or they met with the council member and learned that they won\u2019t support it,\u201d he said. \u201cThose projects may now have life.\u201d\nCity Council leaders have called the measures a\npower grab\nthat will prove dangerous beyond the next mayor, when the city \u201cinevitably\u201d has a mayor that is \u201cbad on housing, equity, and justice for communities,\u201d a spokesperson said. They, along with 32BJ SEIU and city construction unions, have argued that the measures deny Council members the ability to negotiate for deeper affordability and investments in their communities.\n\u201cThis will leave our city without the checks and balances of democracy to protect New Yorkers and ensure outcomes that prioritize them, not simply profits,\u201d a Council spokesperson said in a statement after the election.\nDeveloper David Kramer, president of Hudson Companies, said the appeals board may cause developers to take a second look at projects they thought unworkable, either because the local member opposed it or was likely to try to squeeze as much as possible out of the developer as a condition of approval.\n\u201cThe situation set up the developer to be tortured and extorted,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole process will be less fraught.\u201d\nNeed for speed\nOne of the measures creates two \u201cfast-track\u201d options for affordable housing. The first option allows the Board of Standards and Appeals to sign off on zoning changes for publicly funded affordable housing. Such projects would not have to go through Ulurp.\nThe other applies to affordable housing projects proposed in the 12 community districts that have permitted the least amount of affordable housing in the previous five years. Starting in October 2026, the city will release a report every five years identifying these districts.\nProjects in these areas will be eligible for a condensed Ulurp, which will end with City Planning Commission review, rather than the City Council.\nAnother measure creates the Expedited Land Use Review Procedure \u2014 or Elurp \u2014 for \u201cmodest\u201d housing projects. Such projects are defined as those in medium- or high-density districts that increase residential capacity by no more than 30 percent, or in low-density districts that are no taller than 45 feet and have a maximum floor area ratio of two.\nElurp follows a similar shortened review timeline as the \u201cfast-track\u201d and skips either City Council or City Planning review.\n\u201cThis is just the HOV lane in development,\u201d said Joy Construction\u2019s Eli Weiss, referring to carpool lanes. \u201cThe fast track is really just a response to getting costs down.\u201d\nJust like a carpool lane, the effectiveness of these ballot measures will depend on a number of factors, including availability of city subsidies and the ability of the city\u2019s housing agencies to move these projects along.\nThe future Mamdani administration will be tasked with implementing these measures and determining how to ensure their effectiveness. The mayor-elect has said that he plans to increase staffing at the city\u2019s housing agencies, and some saw his appointment of former First Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer as co-chair of his transition team as an encouraging sign that he will staff his administration with people dedicated to making these measures work.\nMyriad other factors outside this process also threaten the pace of construction, including the high costs of building, access to capital and litigation. Not to mention the measures do not shave time off of environmental review, which, along with pre-certification,\ncan add years\nto a project\u2019s timeline.\nThe ballot measures, with the exception of the fast-track option for projects built in the 12 community districts that have produced the least amount of housing, will go into effect once the election results have been certified. The Department of City Planning and the BSA will also need to draft rules for implementing various aspects of the ballot measures.\nIt\u2019s not clear how many projects currently in the pipeline will try to take advantage of the ballot measures. Developers who have already sunk time and money into going through Ulurp and are nearing the end may decide these alternative paths aren\u2019t worth abandoning their current track. Others may try to switch lanes.\nLonger term, some see the changes as potential boosts for smaller developers.\nMonadnock Development\u2019s Kirk Goodrich said the fast-track and Elurp options create an easier path for smaller or less-established developers to pursue affordable housing projects, by providing a faster timeline and, potentially, a clearer path to approval.\n\u201cI used to say to my team, \u2018Small isn\u2019t easy. Small is just small. So go big,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c[The fast-track] creates a scale that might be manageable for smaller developers.\u201d\n",

The list includes four public housing chiefs from across the country, the agency\u2019s chief of staff Kemena Brooks, and Burnett, whose candidacy has been bogged down by conflict-of-interest concerns.\nThe\nCHA\n\u2014 the nation\u2019s third-largest public housing authority \u2014 has been without a permanent head since Tracey Scott resigned last November.\nA national search launched soon after, with board chair\nMatthew Brewer\nnow saying a new CEO could be named by year\u2019s end. The board\u2019s last scheduled meeting of this year is Nov. 18, though Brewer said a special session could be called to finalize the decision.\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has yet to approve\nconflict-of-interest waivers\nfor Burnett, whose decades in public office and role as a CHA voucher landlord have drawn objections.

But for now, the agency appears intent on moving forward without him.\nAmong those vying for the role are Gregg Fortner of Alabama\u2019s Anniston Housing Authority, Jillian Baldwin of Bridgeport, Connecticut, and Eugene Jones Jr., who ran the CHA from 2015 to 2019 and currently leads the Virgin Islands Housing Finance Authority. Jones\u2019 candidacy has support from CHA resident leaders, though not from all housing advocates. Keith Pettigrew, of Washington, D.C.\u2019s housing authority, was also listed but withdrew months ago.\nThe position comes with weighty responsibilities: overseeing more than 21,000 public housing units and 65,000 households, making the CHA Chicago\u2019s largest single housing owner. But the agency is navigating internal turbulence, with\nnine top executives\nexiting since August and federal scrutiny over Johnson\u2019s push to install Burnett.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Flagstar Bank is reducing its exposure to New York City multifamily properties. In the process, it\u2019s reducing its exposure to Steve Croman, too.\nFlagstar sold notes with an original principal of $247 million to an affiliate of Bellwether Asset Management, PincusCo\nreported\n. The deal includes 38 loans tied to 49 of Croman\u2019s properties, accounting for about 680 total units.\nAll of the debt was originated by Flagstar\u2019s predecessor, New York Community Bank, between 2015 and 2020. Properties are in a wide array of Manhattan neighborhoods, including the West Village, Murray Hill, Gramercy, Kips Bay, East Village and Alphabet City.\nCentennial Bank helped finance the loan purchase for Bellwether, which has a portfolio consisting of 138 million square feet worth of office, industrial, retail, hotel, multifamily and residential lot space.\nFlagstar and Croman have had their differences. In July, Flagstar\nsued\nCroman, claiming the property owner owed $29.6 million related to three Stanton Street properties on the Lower East Side.\nAt the time, Croman was facing seven active foreclosure suits seeking about $51.4 million in principal from Croman and his companies. A temporary receiver had been appointed in five of the cases.\nCroman has also faced\nlegal action\nfrom his former office landlord, who alleges the property owner failed to pay more than $1 million in rent on a Noho office space. He is also\nbeing sued by his father,\nwho has called him a \u201cfraudster\u201d and is seeking to dissolve their partnerships.\nCroman was once named one of the city\u2019s worst landlords and served eight months in prison in 2018 after being convicted of mortgage and tax fraud related to his multifamily buildings.\nThe deal closed around the same time Flagstar reported its\nthird-quarter earnings\n. The company has nearly $9.59 billion in loans tied to heavily rent-stabilized buildings on the books, down about $324 million from the last time the bank\nreported\nits numbers three months ago.\nAbout 60 percent of Flagstar\u2019s loans to New York City multifamily buildings are tied to heavily rent-stabilized properties. Of those loans, about 45 percent have financial red flags, according to the bank.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Timber Equities completed work on its 60-unit\nluxury rental building in Inwood\nthis year on the parking lot site once owned by drug kingpin Manuel Geovanny Rodriguez-Perez.\nIt\u2019s been a big year for religious conversions, of the residential real estate variety.\nKalel Companies and the Masjid Abdul Muhsi Khalifah mosque on Thursday\nannounced plans for a 94,000-square-foot\nmixed-use building with 144 senior housing units in Bedford-Stuyvesant.\nIn May, The Vanbarton Group closed its acquisition of the Catholic Church\u2019s former Manhattan headquarters at\n1011 First Avenue for $103 million\n.

        "content": "Multifamily developers Bruce Menin, Erik Rutter and Joe Lubeck say South Florida needs more housing, but skittish equity investment is among the many barriers to entry.\nThe trio, who spoke during\nThe Real Deal\nMiami Real Estate Forum 2025, pushed back on the notion the tri-county region is struggling with a supply overhang due to hefty completions in recent years. Instead, demand is high and supply is low for the highest quality apartments, the developers said.\nLast year, a\nrecord 18,600 apartments\nwere completed in South Florida, outpacing 15,000 net new leases, according to CoStar Group. Developers started construction of another 14,515 units in the year that ended Sept. 30, outpacing construction starts during the same period of last year.\nThe notion that developers are saturating South Florida has been an ongoing theme in the region\u2019s history, Lubeck, CEO of Tampa-based American Landmark, said at the \u201cToo Much, Too Fast? Rethinking South Florida\u2019s Apartment Boom\u201d panel hosted by\nTRD\ncommercial real estate reporter Francisco Alvarado.\n\u201cFor the last 10 years \u2026 they said, \u2018It\u2019s overbuilt, it\u2019s overbuilt, it\u2019s overbuilt.\u2019 But it\u2019s really not overbuilt,\u201d Lubeck said. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly ebb and flow in the ability to raise rents and, of course, construction costs and the like. But overall, it\u2019s all about job growth and population growth.\u201d\nAnd the tri-county region has both residential and employment growth, the panelists said. Roughly 80,000 households are projected to move to South Florida in the next five years, with 40 percent of them expected to rent, according to Menin, founding principal of Miami-based Crescent Heights.\n\u201cWe know that our nation is under-supplied in housing,\u201d Menin said.\nAmerican Landmark subsidiary Electra America and the Toledano family\u2019s BH Group are redeveloping a portion of Cutler Bay\u2019s Southland Mall into\nSouth Place City Center\nwith roughly 5,000 apartments, a hotel, medical offices, retail on outparcels and a community amphitheater. They are renovating a portion of the existing mall and demolishing some of the retail buildings, including Sears and Kmart.\nCrescent Heights completed the 40-story, 588-unit\nForma Miami\napartment tower in Edgewater last year. The building, which is at least 97 percent leased, is billed by developers as a premier quality tower setting a new standard for the area. This is the first of six towers on 9 contiguous acres Crescent owns, Menin said.\nRutter is co-founder of Oak Row Equities, which has two multifamily towers under construction in Miami\u2019s Edgewater, and this year completed the mixed-use\nWynwood Plaza\nwith 509 apartments.\nMultifamily analysts and leasing companies say South Florida\u2019s hefty building completions are\nconcentrated\nin top Miami areas such as Edgewater and Wynwood, or exactly where Oak Row is developing. But Rutter countered the idea that these areas are over-supplied, arguing the issue is a lack of top-quality apartments that are in high demand.\n\u201cThere was a big wave of supply that came online between 2018 and call it 2021, and the vast majority of that was low-rise. Maybe some of the corners were cut to get projects out of the ground, quickly delivered [with] very small units,\u201d Rutter said. \u201cThe renter pool has grown more sophisticated.\u201d\nAt Wynwood Plaza, which Rutter described as \u201cunquestionably the best\u201d building in Wynwood, demand is strong, with leasing velocity of about 35 units per month, he said. Yet, he conceded Oak Row is offering a month free to incentivize leasing.\n\u201cThere\u2019s other projects that have just delivered surrounding us. Of course, there are some concessions in the market. That\u2019s marketing,\u201d he said, adding this will probably be phased out once the building is 75 percent leased.\nThe true issue for South Florida\u2019s multifamily market is skittish equity, the panelists said, again arguing that only top sponsors and projects in premier neighborhoods can get investment.\nDebt markets are \u201crobust,\u201d but investment has dried in \u201cthe traditional pure play common [limited partner] equity, Rutter said, adding that may not be a bad thing. \u201cIt\u2019s going to quell supply naturally, and then institutional capital markets are going to open up again, cycle back in.\u201d\nThe trio differed in their views of developing in Broward and Palm Beach counties.\nPalm Beach County has prospered with the \u201cstaggering\u201d number of corporate moves and wealth in-migration, but it\u2019s more difficult to justify development of high-end apartments in Fort Lauderdale, Rutter said. Because construction costs are so expensive, Oak Row would have to charge the same rents as it does in Miami\u2019s Edgewater.\n\u201cI can\u2019t extrapolate why you are going to get that in Fort Lauderdale,\u201d he said.\nLubeck is more open to suburban areas such as west Broward, Jupiter and Palm Beach Gardens.\n\u201cI am very concerned about overbuilding on the side of the river\u201d in Fort Lauderdale, he said, referring to the New River.\nIn September, Crescent Heights\u2019 Russell Galbut, through his GFO Investments, and InSite Group, Atlas Hill Real Estate and Prime Finance paid\n$73 million\nfor the\nGalleria Fort Lauderdale\n, with plans to redevelop the mall.\n\u201cWe\u2019re planning several thousand units,\u201d Menin said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have picked up just any site. But this is a placemaking opportunity.\u201d\nMenin, who lives in Manhattan, also offered a more tempered view on the consistent topic of discussion at the forum of whether Zohran Mamdani\u2019s mayoral win will prompt an influx of New Yorkers to South Florida.\n\u201cPeople love Miami. They love New York. There\u2019s a similar DNA to the kind of people that are attracted to both markets. \u2026 I think people are going to continue to move back and forth,\u201d Menin said. \u201cI think we have to take a little bit of a wait and see.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Housing demolition in San Francisco has been exceedingly rare over the last decade-plus, averaging out to about 18 units per year since 2012. City planners credit this to what they recently called \u201csome of the strongest demolition and\ntenant protection\ncontrols in the country.\u201d\nThose controls are now poised to become even stronger.\nThe city\u2019s planning commission greenlit a tenant protection omnibus this week that aims to further discourage residential demolitions and require more from landlords and developers whose projects could displace existing tenants. The proposal, known as the tenant protection ordinance, is headed to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors for a final vote.\nIn classic San Francisco fashion, the proposal takes existing state law and enhances it. California\u2019s Housing Crisis Act of 2019 already prohibits any net loss of rent-controlled or affordable apartments. If a redevelopment project requires the demolition of a property\u2019s\naffordable\nor\nrent-controlled\napartments, they are required to build at least as many units, with at least as many bedrooms.\nIf passed, San Francisco\u2019s rules would require each of those replacement units to have the same number of full bathrooms, and at least 90 percent of the square footage. As with state law, the replacement units must remain as affordable as the originals.\nThe proposal also expands protection to more tenants.\nState law only affords tenant protections to those who live in a unit when the property owner submits a development application. Tenant protections include rights such as the ability to remain in a property for up to 6 months prior to demolition, relocation benefits, first refusal on replacement units, and the right to return if property owner changes course and returns the original units to the rental market.\nSan Francisco\u2019s new rules would expand those protections to tenants who have vacated the property due to a capital improvement project, have left the property within the last five years due to harassment or a non-compliant buyout, or tenants displaced within the last five years by an owner who decided to move back into the property and take it off the rental market.\nProperty owners would need to inform tenants of the protections, and tenants would also be granted a right of private action against a property owner or developer who violates requirements.\nThe proposal arrives against the backdrop of what many see as a looming upzoning in neighborhoods across the city.\nMayor Daniel Lurie\u2019s Family Zoning Plan\n\u2014 aimed at making room for 82,000 state-mandated units by 2031 \u2014 is plodding through the approval process.\nGov. Gavin Newsom\nrecently signed SB 79\n, Sacramento\u2019s marquee housing bill this session, which could upzone properties within a half-mile of transit stops as soon as next summer.\nWhere talks of rezoning increase, fears around displacement often follow.\nAhead of casting their votes, commissioners celebrated the proposal. Commissioner Derek Braun called it \u201ca great day\u201d and Commissioner Kathrin Moore said the ordinance represented \u201cone of the most collaborative efforts I\u2019ve seen in a long time.\u201d\nCommissioner Gilbert Williams said he welcomed the protections, but said his vote came \u201cwith a heavy heart.\u201d\n\u201cThere are a lot of vulnerable tenants out there, and it\u2019s very unfortunate that we\u2019re in this situation,\u201d Williams said, referencing the proposed upzoning throughout the city. \u201cOur residents deserve a lot better than what they\u2019re being faced with here.\u201d",

        "content": "Developer Edgardo Defortuna and brokerage head Craig Studnicky said the foreign buyers they work with have not been deterred by the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on immigration.\n\u201cThey already have their visa, their status or they already own property here, and they\u2019re trying to [purchase] something better, bigger,\u201d\nDefortuna\n, CEO of Miami-based Fortune International Group, said at\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s Miami Real Estate Forum on Thursday.\nBut he said the shutdown has stalled anyone needing clearance from the consulate.\nForeign buyers\nare still very active\nin South Florida, both panelists said. Mexicans and Brazilians are leading in higher-priced purchases, while\nColombians\nare the top buyers for investment properties in the $1 million to $2.5 million range.\nStudnicky, co-founder and CEO of Aventura-based ISG World and RelatedISG Realty, said Latin Americans are increasingly looking at Broward County, specifically Hollywood, Fort Lauderdale and Pompano Beach.\nThe\nbuyer pool\nhas shifted compared to before the pandemic, from 65 to 70 percent foreign buyers and 30 to 35 percent domestic buyers, to the opposite, Defortuna said.\nAlso a big factor that is happening today is that most of the Latin American currencies have appreciated versus the dollar, which is very, very unusual,\u201d he added. \u201cTypically, the Latin American currencies lose value versus the dollar. In the last six months, pretty much all the currencies in Latin America have appreciated versus the dollar, and that makes it very attractive for them, because they know that it\u2019s temporary, and they know that they should act now, because it\u2019s not going to last.\u201d\nDomestic buyers have dominated the resale market, versus foreign buyers who are more attracted to new developments.\n\u201cThese buildings take a long time to build, and when they\u2019re moving here in the next year or two, [U.S. buyers] simply cannot wait,\u201d Studnicky said.\nForeigners are also doubling down on South Florida real estate as private equity investors in new developments. Defortuna said he used to raise money for projects via hedge funds or New York-based real estate funds.\nPart of the\nlatest rush is through EB-5\napproved projects, Defortuna said. Under the federal program, investors and their families receive visas for financing a development that creates a minimum number of U.S. jobs.\n\u201cDemand has been incredible,\u201d Defortuna said. \u201cBefore, EB-5 used to be mainly Chinese or the Far East, but now the Latin American buyer really understands the process.\u201d\nThe speakers also touched on the effect that Zohran Mamdani\u2019s victory in the New York mayoral race could have on South Florida real estate. While many Florida real estate agents and brokers predict a mass exodus, others are more measured about what to expect.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to uproot my life, my business, my friends, my family, my kids in school, when they have all their friends, because of some 34-year-old kid, without giving New York City a chance to punch back,\u201d Studnicky said. \u201cNew York\u2019s got a spine. I\u2019ve heard a lot of people say we\u2019re going to get this huge wave of people from New York, and I think the comparable in their heads or in their hearts is what happened five years ago during Covid. Slow down. You\u2019re going to get a bump. But I think you\u2019re exaggerating the bump.\u201d\n",

The proposal comes from Hawthorne-based\nLAcarGuy and its CEO Mike Sullivan\n; Toyota of Hollywood was founded in 1957 and is a subsidiary of LAcarGuy, which has 13 auto dealers across Los Angeles County owned by the Sullivan family.\nThe site spans 3.7 acres and would consist of high-rise and low-rise structures including 350 studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments, 136,000 square feet of offices, and about 22,500 square feet of ground-floor commercial space. Houston-based developer Hines is part of the development team.\nThe project, designed by OfficeUntitled, would feature a 35-story residential tower rising 419 feet, a six-story office building, and low-rise residential structures that would seemingly create a townhome-populated, village-style environment. Between the buildings would be about 23,500 square feet of publicly accessible open space designed by landscape architect Relm, including a new plaza opening up to Hollywood Boulevard.\nThe\nPlanning Commission\ntook up two appeals against the project before ultimately upholding its decision to advance it. One was from a coalition of labor unions known as CREED L.A. (Coalition for Responsible Equitable Economic Development Los Angeles), which argued that the project\u2019s environmental impact report didn\u2019t consider several potential hazards that could impact future site occupants. The other was from the owner of an adjacent property, which appealed to the Commission to block the project due to its potential to obscure a cell tower and billboard on his property.\nThe project has gotten some support from business organizations such as the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, as well as building trades unions such as the Western States Regional Council of Carpenters.\nA timeline for completion of the project hasn\u2019t been confirmed after the appeal process, though in 2023, the plan was to break ground in 2026 and finish work in 2029, Urbanize\nreported\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Some of Chicagoland\u2019s most-expensive homes sales this year were in Winnetka, including a record-breaking\n$31.3 million deal\n.\nA Winnetka office is \u201clong overdue\u201d for the brokerage, Mawicke said in a LinkedIn post.\nThe firm sought Mawicke out when it was looking to expand its North Shore presence, said\nMark Pasquesi\n, Jameson Sotheby\u2019s president of real estate services and managing broker for Lake Forest and Winnetka.\nSales in the ritzy suburbs\nare dominated by @properties and Compass, which hold a large share of the area\u2019s listings, but other brokerages are taking their shots in the North Shore.\nPeter Cummins\n, also a former @properties agent, recently jumped from @properties to Baird &amp; Warner to lead a new North Shore team. And Janice Corley\u2019s\nRE/MAX Premier\nbought a handful of offices from Compass in the North Shore to kickstart business there.

        "content": "The Ismaili Center Houston \u2014 the first in the United States \u2014 is officially open after many years of planning and development.\nThe long-anticipated cultural and religious complex debuted Nov. 6 with a ceremony led by\nHis Highness Prince Rahim Aga Khan V\nand\nHouston Mayor John Whitmire\n, marking a major milestone for both the city and the global Ismaili Muslim community, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe project cost wasn\u2019t reported, but a state filing in 2021 pegged it at $176.2 million, or $1,175 per square foot for a project that was planned with a two-story parking structure.\nSet on 11 acres at 2323 Allen Parkway at Montrose Boulevard, the 150,000-square-foot complex is meant to serve not only as a place of worship but also as a public gathering space for people of all faiths.\n\u201cThis building may be called an Ismaili Center, but it is not here for Ismailis only. It is for all Houstonians,\u201d Prince Rahim said at the opening, calling the center a space for \u201cknowledge, reflection and dialogue.\u201d\nThe cooperative nature of the rollout in Houston stands in stark contrast to the\nepic fight state leaders picked\nthis year with\nEPIC City\n, a Muslim-led master-planned community north of Dallas.\nThe Texas Workforce Commission settled a\nFair Housing Act\ncomplaint against Community Capital Partners, the developer of EPIC City, in September. The agency dismissed the complaint after the firm agreed to new housing policies, staff training and compliance reporting, while the developer admitted no wrongdoing.\nThe Houston project fulfills the vision of the late Prince Karim Aga Khan IV, who first purchased the site in 2006 and championed the idea of an American Ismaili Center before his death earlier this year.\nDesigned by London-based architect Farshid Moussavi, in collaboration with landscape architect Thomas Woltz of\nNelson Byrd Woltz\n, the center aims to embody the Ismaili philosophy of harmony between people, place and nature. The Washington, D.C.-based Aga Khan Foundation USA oversaw development, with Omaha\u2019s DLR Group serving as architect of record and McCarthy Building Companies as general contractor.\nThe center is framed by 9 acres of gardens, shaded terraces and water features. The building\u2019s triangular fa\u00e7ade doubles as a thermal and light filter, casting patterned sunlight across custom concrete floors that echo the geometric traditions of Islamic design. The theme continues throughout the interior, from perforated wooden walls inscribed in Kufic script to ceilings that conceal structural beams and air ducts behind intricate triangular screens.\nThe centerpiece is the prayer hall, a column-free space nearly the size of two basketball courts, able to accommodate 1,500 worshipers.\nIts orientation toward Mecca required rotating the structure 45 degrees off the site\u2019s grid, inspiring the triangular motif repeated throughout. Above it sits a grand veranda \u2014 or eivan \u2014 intended for weddings and public events, in keeping with Persian palace traditions.\nThe Ismaili Center joins six others worldwide, in London, Vancouver, Lisbon, Dubai, Dushanbe and Toronto.\nHouston, home to the country\u2019s largest Ismaili Muslim population at roughly 40,000, was a natural choice for the first U.S. site, center spokesperson Omar Samji said. The project\u2019s LEED-seeking design also reflects Houston\u2019s growing identity as a global city that merges culture, faith and sustainability.\nWhitmire called the complex a \u201cbeacon of light\u201d for the city\u2019s diverse communities.\n\u201cThe Ismaili Center truly reflects the best of Houston\u2019s spirit: our diversity, our compassion, and our commitment to community,\u201d Whitmire said.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Social media can be a very powerful tool, but simply chasing likes or trying to go \u201cviral\u201d won\u2019t do anything to help a real estate professional\u2019s career, panelists warned during a discussion on the business of digital marketing during\nThe Real Deal\nMiami Forum on Thursday.\nMichael Ruiz, president and CEO of\nLegendary Productions\n, a company in Miami and Austin that promotes\nluxury homes\n, said being obnoxious or shocking might please \u201csomeone in another country who is sitting in their underwear liking a video,\u201d but it won\u2019t do anything to help close a deal.\n\u201cIf I were a real estate agent\u2026 [I\u2019d look] at the top five, top 10 people who are actually selling and making money. They\u2019re not dancing on tables or doing those skits like whatever-her-name-is does in Tampa,\u201d said Ruiz, who has at least 500,000 followers on Legendary\u2019s Instagram, a highly viewed home tour YouTube channel. \u201cThey\u2019re presenting their properties in a professional manner and presenting themselves in a way that separates them from\u2026 the masses. So, the reality is, these people who are selling are going to continue to sell, and the people that are doing all this trendy stuff are going to fall out eventually.\u201d\nThe person from Tampa that Ruiz referred to was Breanna Banaciski, also known as Tampa Bre, a real estate agent in the Tampa metro area affiliated with Realty One Group Advantage who makes sarcastic humorous videos of properties on Instagram and Tiktok that have attracted hundreds of thousands of followers.\n\u201cShe got a big write-up in the New York Times a few weeks ago,\u201d said\nTRD\nreporter Kate Hinsche, the panel\u2019s moderator. \u201cYou might know her tagline. \u2018This house has more bush than my mom in the \u201880s.\u2019\u201d\nBut Glennda Baker, president and CEO of Atlanta-based Glennda Baker &amp; Associates, said she didn\u2019t find Banaciski\u2019s video shorts amusing.\n\u201cYeah, she makes my head spin around and snot fly out of my nose,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWe sell homes that are usually people\u2019s single largest asset. We sell homes where people live their lives and bring their families and bring their friends and create milestones. And the mere fact that someone would be so disrespectful to that home, to that property, makes me violent. I\u2019m sorry, I probably shouldn\u2019t have said that. But it just, it really angers me. It is such a poor reflection of our industry. We are professionals. We get paid a lot of money to be professional. The worst agents are highly overpaid, and the best agents are highly undervalued, and when someone like that gets a following or gets spotlighted that scares the hell out of me.\u201d\nThe content \u201ceveryone in this room\u201d should be focused on is \u201ccreating content that is valuable to the consumer,\u201d added Baker, who has 875,000 followers on TikTok and 327,000 followers on Instagram.\nBaker, who has worked in real estate for more than 30 years, said she started creating content on social media in 2016. But it wasn\u2019t until 2020, after she hired a videographer, that her standing in social media grew. She now spends about four hours each month shooting 30 to 50 unscripted evergreen videos for days she is unable to post live, or at all.\n\u201cThe ideas come to me throughout the month. I have Google Forms on the homepage of my phone, and when I get an idea, I open up my phone, I put the idea in there. Then, when I sit with my videographer, I open my laptop and we go down the list,\u201d Baker said. \u201c[It\u2019s] really very structured because I post a video every day.\u201d\nThose clips can be stories about what it took to close a house, giving advice on real estate, or \u201cthe good, the bad, and the ugly\u201d stories, such as chasing a rat out of an attic and \u201ccleaning up the shit pellets\u201d or venting about a bad inspection.\n\u201cI do say bad words, and that may not be professional, but I\u2019m weeding out the riffraff by doing that\u2026cause if you\u2019re going to do business with me, and you think you\u2019re going to get somebody who\u2019s all buttoned up, you probably are looking in the wrong spot,\u201d she said, adding that she sold 27 houses on Tinder.\nAlyssa Morgan,\nfounder and senior agent of Miami Beach-based The Inside Network, said she uses social media to not only showcase her properties, but also to show pieces of her life, such as dinner with her husband, doing Pilates or going to a Mommy and Me class. \u201cMy goal with my [Instagram] page is to make you feel like you know me before you even know me, so I really am posting throughout my day, and it\u2019s just like what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\nMorgan, who has 22,000 followers on Instagram, does this so people \u201cfeel comfortable enough to reach out to me\u201d about properties.\nIt\u2019s also important to \u201ctag\u201d places and people whenever possible when posting on Instagram, added Ruiz, who has collaborated with Morgan.\n\u201cTag, tag, tag everything you do\u2026. because then she reposts, I repost, she reposts, everybody starts seeing it. It\u2019s the easiest thing in the world,\u201d Ruiz said.\n\u201cA little trick that I used to do when I first started is I would get a listing, let\u2019s say at the\nCarillon\n, then I would go through the geotag and reach out to everyone that tagged themselves and send them my listing,\u201d Morgan later added. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of like how I built my Miami followers.\u201d\nMorgan said she\u2019s managed to get listings, find buyer leads and close deals from her Instagram audience and followers.\nAnd that\u2019s the whole purpose of social media, to help create your own brand and bring value and visibility for your clients\u2019 homes, Baker said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about virality and vanity,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not over here being a comedian who is trying to sell real estate to create content, I\u2019m creating content to sell real estate.\u201d",

        "content": "The South Side apartment building that was subject to a controversial federal raid last month has been officially deemed too unsafe for tenants to continue living in.\nCook County Circuit Court Judge Debra Seaton issued an order Nov. 7 to appoint a receiver to the 7500 South South Shore Drive property and requested that the receiver, Friedman Real Estate, help the remaining tenants relocate.\n\u201cThe conditions are just ridiculous,\u201d a tenant said at the Nov. 7 receivership hearing. \u201cThere is sewage on both corners of the first floor. Maintenance doesn\u2019t do anything. The security is just crazy, no doors are secure and anyone can just walk in.\u201d\nAbout half a dozen tenants testified about the conditions of the property at the hearing. Seaton ordered that their names and unit numbers not be shared publicly.\nAfter hundreds of agents from the FBI, ATF and ICE led a massive overnight raid on the South Shore building last month, many tenants voluntarily moved out.\nThe Sept. 30 operation drew national attention for its intensity as well as criticism from local officials who called the tactics heavy-handed and questioned if it violated the rights of tenants who were detained temporarily but not ultimately arrested.\nThe operation yielded 37 arrests, some of which the Department of Homeland Security noted were for drug trafficking and weapons charges while others were for immigration violations. Additional details on the arrests have been scarce and records requests from\nThe Real Deal\nfor further information have been denied or not returned.\nAmid an escalating legal-back-and-forth between Wells Fargo and the building\u2019s owner, a little-known Wisconsin-based investor named Trinity Flood, the raid thrust the South Side building\u2019s longstanding troubles into the spotlight.\nWells Fargo, acting as a trustee on behalf of bond holders, filed a $27 million foreclosure lawsuit against Flood in April, claiming she was behind on mortgage payments tied to the South Shore building as well as several others across Chicago and the U.S.\nThough Flood initially fought back against Wells Fargo\u2019s attempts to have a receiver appointed to the property, her attorney said at the Nov. 7 hearing that they were no longer opposing the motion. He did, however, say that they reserved the right to oppose the appointment of a receiver at any of Flood\u2019s other properties.\nSince the raid, between 30 to 40 tenants still live at the 13-unit property. Several of them told Seaton at the Nov. 7 hearing that they would like to move out and that it continues to be subject to vandalism and trespassing. Multiple tenants testified that they would have moved out already if they had the financial means to do so.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unlivable right now due to the ICE raid, the immigrants, the Venezuelans and the flooding,\u201d one tenant said, though it was unclear if the tenant meant that migrants do or do not still currently occupy the building. \u201cI lost a lot of stuff due to the raid. It\u2019s just unbearable right now.\u201d\nAcknowledging that it may be difficult for the tenants to find housing during the holiday season and without financial assistance, Seaton said the hazardous conditions at the property are still too severe to allow anyone to continue living there.\nA broken elevator, a potential gas leak, threat of carbon monoxide poisoning from faulty boilers, an insufficient number of working carbon monoxide detectors and significant electrical wiring issues were all cited as major causes for concern from city inspectors and the judge.\n\u201cThe court has some real concerns about the electrical problems,\u201d Seaton said. \u201cIt is like a trap, waiting for a fire.\u201d\nShe ordered that the receiver begin working on resolving safety issues as soon as possible and search for programs available to help tenants with relocation costs.\nSeaton also gave the receiver authority to begin the eviction process for squatters reported at the property, which is a notoriously difficult legal procedure in Illinois. A recent change to state law to improve that process\ndoes not take effect until the new year.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m the only tenant left on this floor that isn\u2019t a squatter,\u201d said one tenant, adding that there appear to be squatters on every floor of the five-story building.\nAnother tenant alleged trespassers have vandalized the property and possibly used it as a place to engage in drug dealing and prostitution.\nBefore the raid, the building was cited for numerous code violations from the city of Chicago and city inspectors noted over the summer that the property manager, Corey Oliver of Strength in Management, was no longer able to \u201cre-assert control over the building.\u201d\nDuring another hearing regarding Wells Fargo\u2019 receivership request that took place shortly after the Sept. 30 raid, Oliver said he had hired armed security guards to patrol the building from 6PM to 6AM nightly.\nAt the time, Seaton acknowledged Oliver\u2019s efforts to improve conditions at the property and held off on appointing a receiver. Instead, she ordered a follow-up inspection for Nov. 6 and a hearing to reconsider the issue Nov. 7.\nShe also asked that tenants attend the Nov. 7 hearing to provide their perspective on the conditions and tell the court whether or not they wanted to move out. Though the overall conditions would dictate her final decision, Seaton said she would also consider tenants\u2019 willingness to move in her ruling.\nAt the Nov. 7 hearing, tenants revealed that the security guards provided little help to the building and were no longer employed there.\n\u201cI am sure they were disgusted by being here,\u201d a tenant said of the security guards. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even sit in the building, they sat at the entrance or in their cars.\u201d\nOliver confirmed he had fired the security guards because they had not adequately protected the building and allowed vandalism to take place while they were on duty. But he defended his efforts to improve conditions in a short period of time.\n\u201cWe have protected lighting in the stairwells, we are constantly removing garbage and constantly mopping up the floors,\u201d Oliver said and added that squatters may be the root of the issues. \u201cIt\u2019s one step forward and two steps back.\u201d\nFlood\u2019s attorney said perception of the property so far has been \u201cone-sided.\u201d\nSeaton disagreed.\n\u201cI have heard more than one side of the story. I have heard this case on two different occasions and gave instructions to the property manager and they are still not done and I have pictures,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying the property manager hasn\u2019t taken some steps but he hasn\u2019t taken enough\u2026 God forbid a fire occurs in this building and the people get burned up \u2026 the court will not allow that.\u201d\nSome tenants noted that issues at the property had been piling up for some time and only gained attention after the raid.\n\u201cI thought this was a great location at first but I would love to relocate,\u201d said one tenant. \u201cThis building hadn\u2019t gotten coverage before the ICE situation but this building has been in decline for two years.\u201d\nCity code violations and foreclosure records also state conditions at the building started to decline well before the raid took place.\nSometime in the last two years, the conditions at the property deteriorated rapidly, despite it undergoing a multimillion renovation shortly before Flood bought it in 2020.\nSeaton said the efforts made since the raid were too little, too late.\n\u201cThe court does acknowledge that your property management has tried to remediate some of the conditions,\u201d Seaton said to Oliver. \u201cBut the court has found that the remediation has not been sufficient to make the building safe and habitable which is why the court is appointing a receiver to relocate the tenants and if necessary to evict the squatters.\u201d",

        "content": "Sometimes suing for perfection can bring change, even after years of litigation.\nA six-year legal fight over the construction of Laura Ricketts\u2019 $13 million\nWilmette\nlakefront mansion ended with the Chicago Cubs co-owner recovering only a fraction of what she sought.\nAn arbitration panel awarded Ricketts roughly $600,000 \u2014 about 12 percent of her $5 million exterior claims \u2014 after rejecting the bulk of her complaints against LG Construction Group, the home\u2019s builder, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nRicketts accused LG and architecture firm\nMorgante Wilson\nof botching everything from millwork and windows to the radiant heating system in her six-bedroom Sheridan Road estate.\nRicketts bought the property in the 400 block of Sheridan Road in Wilmette for $6.5 million under a trust in 2010,\nThe Real Deal\nfirst\nreported\n. Construction on the home began in 2012 and continued until 2016. Ricketts and her family moved into the home in 2015 while work was ongoing that ultimately cost $12.8 million.\nRicketts, who also co-owns the Chicago Sky and Chicago Red Stars, began documenting more than 1,500 alleged defects soon after moving in, claiming the problems added $7 million to the project\u2019s price tag. Morgante Wilson settled privately with her before arbitration began, leaving LG to face the claims.\nThe arbitrators found that Ricketts failed to prove most of her allegations, concluding that none of the interior issues \u2014 which totaled $8 million \u2014 stemmed from construction defects. Instead, they sided with LG\u2019s argument that the complaints reflected \u201can improper standard of perfection\u201d and normal wear and tear after nearly a decade in the home.\nThe decision followed a year of arbitration hearings and testimony spanning more than 12,000 pages.\n\u201cOur construction quality and our reputation have been validated,\u201d\nLG principal\nBrian Goldberg told the outlet.\nThe $600,000 award was fully covered by subcontractor settlements and insurance, according to LG\u2019s legal team at Traub Lieberman. Goldberg said his firm did not pay any portion of the award out of pocket but acknowledged the company is still recouping legal costs after years of defense.\nRicketts, through a spokesperson, declined to comment. Arbitration proceedings are private, and details of the settlement and the arbitrators\u2019 identities are confidential.\nThe dispute centered on questions of liability and patience.\nGoldberg said Ricketts didn\u2019t notify LG of many alleged defects until years after moving in, denying the builder a chance to make repairs. Among her complaints were leaks, warped woodwork, uneven floors and roofing failures in a glass-walled \u201cLake Room\u201d facing Lake Michigan.\n",

        "content": "A recently opened senior living community in\nLos Gatos\nhas come under new ownership.\nHarrison Street Real Estate, an affiliate of Chicago-based Harrison Street Asset Management, bought the Ivy Park at Los Gatos complex for $54 million, the Mercury News\nreported\n. The seller was a joint venture between two Bay Area real estate firms, Vacaville-based Chronograph Properties and San Jose-based Swenson, which developed the property that opened in May of this year.\nThe 114-unit community at 400 Blossom Hill Road in Los Gatos sold for well above its assessed value from January of this year of $38.4 million. Harrison Street Real Estate has been a repeat investor in senior living communities, investing approximately $14.6 billion in senior housing assets for a total of 43,000 combined units in the two decades since its founding.\nThe sale of the resort-style Ivy Park complex was part of a six-property portfolio transaction from Harrison Street, which partnered with senior living company Oakmont Senior Living and general contractor Blue Mountain Enterprises to acquire the properties. Harrison Street purchased the properties through HSRE BME Blossom Hill Road LLC, a joint-venture entity created with Blue Mountain Enterprises.\nThe 669-unit purchase includes five operational senior communities in California and one empty development site scheduled for completion with new residences in 2027, Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The other properties are in Santa Rosa, Bakersfield, Vallejo and\nFairfield\n,\nper\nthe Silicon Valley Business Journal. The overall sale price was more than $200 million for the six-property portfolio.\nThe sale comes as\nnew construction of multifamily properties in the Bay Area slows\n, with ground-up and redevelopment projects becoming fewer and farther between. In Oakland, for example, Ellis Partners is\nseeking to turn a former American National Red Cross building\ninto a seven-story, 197-unit senior housing facility.\nMeanwhile, near Los Gatos in San Jose, Shashi Group is\nseeking to convert the Aloft San Jose Cupertino hotel\ninto a senior residential care facility. That plan calls for an 80-unit complex offering assisted living and memory care.\nHarrison Street previously\nbought the 94-room Oakmont at Silver Creek\nsenior living facility\u00a0 in San Jose in 2023 for $50.8 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The property, at 3500 Hillridge Drive, had racked up 1,458 code violations, and nearly 100 lawsuits were filed against Venetos and property managers regarding the conditions at the property.\nEven so, the filing said residents still had no water, sewer or gas at the complex.\nVenetos responded, asking the court to dissolve the order. He said the city didn\u2019t follow Texas Rules of Civil Procedure in pursuing the order. Judge Gantt denied the request.\nLurin purchased the complex in 2022, deed records show. The 264-unit property was built in 1975. City official Curtis Howard called it \u201cthe worst apartment complex we have in the city of Plano,\u201d the outlet reported.\nThe order comes amid mounting legal trouble for Jon Venetos, whose firm has been bleeding properties all year.\nLender Acore claims Venetos defaulted on nearly $400 million worth of loans tied to properties in Florida and Texas. The 12 Florida properties\nheaded to foreclosure auction\nin April.\nAcore also claims Venetos personally guaranteed the $394.4 million he borrowed. The lender filed six lawsuits in October\nasking for judgments totaling $80.7 million\n, Venetos\u2019 payment guaranties, plus other default-related expenses, court records show.\nAcore alleges his liability was triggered when he defaulted on the loans and when he allowed mechanics\u2019 liens to be placed on the properties.\nVenetos is also fighting a\nrecent lawsuit from Select Securities Europe\n, a lender from Luxembourg that claims he defaulted on 15 loans totaling $40.5 million.\n",

        "content": "The Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office is cracking down on rental scammers \u2014 and the timing could be an opportunity for rental agents.\nProsecutors on Thursday charged a 35-year-old man with identity theft and other crimes after he allegedly duped a would-be subletter out of rent money. The case comes after the DA recently charged two other men in similar schemes.\nIn the latest indictment, prosecutors claim Anthony Pittman stole a woman\u2019s identity and forged documents to rent a luxury apartment in Murray Hill, only to sublet it to another tenant. The unit at the center of the case is a building on Third Avenue called the Aurora, where one-bedrooms rent for about $4,600, according to\nCrain\u2019s New York\n.\nJust weeks before announcing the charges, prosecutors also accused 36-year-old Adam Chatwin of\nfalsely posing\nas the landlord of a Midtown studio only to pocket $32,000 in upfront costs from four prospective tenants. Turns out, Chatwin was only subletting the place for a month.\nThe clampdown is coming as rents are growing increasingly\nmore expensive\nand as the topic of affordable housing is top of mind for most New Yorkers on the heels of a mayoral election where candidates campaigned on solving the crisis.\nBut it\u2019s also arriving as the city\u2019s rental agents on both the landlord and tenant side have been scrambling to redefine their worth after the \u201cbroker fee ban\u201d\ntook effect\nin June. With many owners newly footing the bill for broker fees \u2014 and questioning whether they should \u2014 agents are searching for fresh ways to justify their role.\nThe scams may seem unrelated to rental agents\u2019 plight, but as one broker pointed out a couple of months ago, one of the benefits to hiring an agent is to vet and verify prospective tenants.\n\u201cA for-rent-by-owner reached out to me, and I told him, \u2018it\u2019s going to cost you more money to hire me, but I\u2019ll get you a qualified person,\u2019\u201d Corcoran\u2019s Shloma Hecht said in September. \u201cYou can do it by yourself and maybe collect the rent on the front end. But this isn\u2019t about the first month\u2019s rent. It\u2019s about 12 or 24 months of rent.\u201d\nLandlords \u201cthink they\u2019re going to save a couple of dollars to do it themselves,\u201d Hecht added. \u201cBut brokers get a better sense if someone is serious or not.\u201d\nNot so fast\u2026\nThe residential market in Downtown Manhattan was already hot \u2014 but a couple of new, pricey listings could turn the temperature up higher.\nEarlier this week, filmmaker Neil Burger and his wife, architect Diana Kellogg, listed their townhouse in Tribeca for $30 million. The couple bought the 40-foot-wide home at 4 Staple Street for just $1.7 million in 2002.\nBuilt in 1868, the property spans 4,100 square feet and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms. It also includes a 2,500-square-foot studio, office and wine cellar at 1 Jay Street as well as roughly 3,000 potential extra square feet of air rights.\nBurger, known for movies such as \u201cLimitless\u201d and \u201cDivergent,\u201d and Kellogg listed their abode just a week after news of another expensive listing below 14th Street dropped.\nDeveloper Alf Naman is preparing to list a penthouse at his\nboutique condo at 125 Perry Street\nfor a whopping $85 million \u2014 a figure that could give a pending deal at a nearby new development a run for its money.\nThe penthouse, one of seven condos at the former parking garage, will likely be the most expensive listing downtown and among the top five in all of Manhattan once it hits the market.\nIf it scores a deal close to its asking price, it could challenge a penthouse at Aurora Capital Associates\u2019 140 Jane Street which found a buyer in August with an asking price of\n$88 million\n.\nThe deal hasn\u2019t yet closed, so the actual price of the sale is still unknown. But unless the developer offloaded it for a discount of tens of millions, the trade is likely to set a new record for a condo sale in Downtown Manhattan, a bar that was just raised in March when a condo at the Witkoff Group\u2019s 150 Charles sold for\n$60 million\n.\nHowever, there\u2019s likely another contender in the race to break the Downtown record: Atlas Capital and Zeckendorf Development\u2019s 80 Clarkson. The team behind the project has been tight-lipped about its deals, but judging from\nsome of the pricing\nreleased in its offering plan, big ticket trades are surely on the horizon once the building begins closing.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe priciest deal recorded in the city rolls this week was for a townhouse on the Upper East Side, which sold for $16.8 million, or $2,700 per square foot. The five-story property at 48 East 81st Street hit the market last September asking $19 million.\nThe 7,400-square-foot abode, built in 1924 and gut-renovated in 2019, has six bedrooms and seven bathrooms. It also features seven marble fireplaces, a roof deck and solarium.\nSociete Real Estate\u2019s Sarah Wiliams and Peter Stack had the listing, along with Douglas Elliman\u2019s Madeline Hult Elghanayan, Allison Chalfin and George Vanderploeg.\n",

        "content": "An air taxi company hoping to transform travel in time for the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles is poised to purchase a local airport.\nArcher Aviation\n, based in San Jose, signed agreements to buy the Hawthorne Municipal Airport in a $126 million all-cash deal, L.A. Business First\nreported\n.\nThe airport at 12101 Crenshaw Boulevard is on an 80-acre property with 190,000 square feet of airport, office and hangar space. It was previously owned by the City of Hawthorne, which has used it as an aviation reliever airport. The price amounts to $663 per square foot.\nArcher plans to base operations for a planned air taxi network in Los Angeles at the airport.\nThe company specializing in electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles was selected as the official air taxi partner of the LA28 Olympic Games.\nArcher is also the exclusive air taxi partner for the Los Angeles Sports &amp; Entertainment Commission, which supports Los Angeles as a host city for the 2026 FIFA World Cup and Super Bowl LXI, slated to take place at\nSoFi Stadium in Inglewood\nin 2027.\nBesides running its operations out of the Hawthorne Airport, Archer plans to use the facility as an \u201cinnovation testbed\u201d for its artificial intelligence-powered aviation technologies, including AI-powered air traffic and ground operations management.\nAt the same time as it acquired the Hawthorne Municipal Airport, Archer announced that it raised $650 million in additional equity capital. The company\u2019s total liquidity is now more than $2 billion.\nTo successfully operate a region-wide air taxi program, especially with a high-traffic event like the Olympics or World Cup, several\ntakeoff and landing sites\nwill need to be established for Archer\u2019s operations.\nLast month,\nCushman &amp; Wakefield was tapped\nby Atlantic Aviation subsidiary VertiPorts by Atlantic to secure leases for \u201cvertiports,\u201d or landing pads for eVTOL vehicles. Archer plans to offer 10- to 20-minute flights between SoFi Stadium, Los Angeles International Airport and various locations from Santa Monica to Orange County.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Nearly six years after COVID lockdowns forced office workers across the country to work from home, employees are still making their way back into the office, with San Ramon\u2019s Bishop Ranch complex leading the way.\nThe mixed-use neighborhood has seen approximately 60 percent of its workforce physically based at Bishop Ranch return to work, the Mercury News\nreported\n. That\u2019s up from around 53% for the year prior, per Placer data cited by Bishop Ranch owner and operator Sunset Development.\nBy contrast, the return-to-office rate was 49 percent in Silicon Valley and 41.8 percent in San Francisco, per Kastle Access Control System data cited by the Mercury News. San Francisco\nclimbed out of last place nationally\nin RTO rates earlier this year.\nEmployees are also seemingly spending more time at the office once they arrive. Average office dwell times at Bishop Ranch have climbed back up to 96 percent of pre-pandemic levels, representing daily stints at the office ranging from 5.4 to 6.3 hours. Some office neighborhoods at Bishop Ranch have even seen daily office stays exceed pre-pandemic levels.\nBishop Ranch is in the midst of a transformation from an office campus into a community complete with offices, housing, retail, restaurant, entertainment and lodging space. About 8,000 homes are in active planning or under construction at the San Ramon enclave.\nThe hope is that the increase in on-site living will in turn drive up return-to-office rates and office stay times. Sunset Development noted that walking to work has increased 11.8 percent since 2019, while commutes of 10 minutes or less have grown 28.2 percent. The positive trends seem to speak to Bishop Ranch being a \u201cdynamic environment where businesses, employees and residents all benefit,\u201d according to\nSunset Development CEO Alex Mehran Jr.\nLast month, the City of San Ramon signed off on\nplans for Bishop Ranch\u2019s first fully affordable housing development\n. The 200-unit project from Eden Housing at 2453 Camino Ramon will bring residences for seniors and families to a 2.2-acre site donated by Sunset Development. That includes a 120-unit residential building for working families and 80 separate residences for seniors.\nWhile more workers are returning to the office at Bishop Ranch, offices in general at the development seem to be shrinking, not growing. Several offices across Bishop Ranch are either slated for or in the process of\nbeing converted into housing\n. The East Bay at large is\nexpected to see the most office-to-residential conversions\nin the Bay Area over the next five years.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "One developer\u2019s leverage can be a city official\u2019s nightmare as a \u201cseismic shift\u201d is taking place in developments along the outskirts of cities.\nA Texas law has stripped cities\u2019 sway in determining how subdivisions are built and regulated in their extraterritorial jurisdictions, creating flexibility in the eyes of some developers and chaos for neighboring cities.\nThe move stems from Senate Bill 2038 \u2014 the \u201cETJ Opt-Out Bill\u201d \u2014 which allows landowners to remove property from a city\u2019s ETJ, where municipalities can regulate land just beyond their borders, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. The law, which took effect in 2023, unleashed a power shift in development dynamics.\nDevelopers see newfound flexibility in negotiating infrastructure and utilities; cities see chaos.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of the tail wagging the dog,\u201d\nFort Worth\nAssistant City Manager Dana Burghdoff told the outlet. \u201cYou can\u2019t plan for random.\u201d\nWhen nearly 2,000 acres west of Fort Worth sold in 2022, the city of Aledo branded it the \u201cGateway to Aledo,\u201d a sprawling, mixed-use vision known as Dean Ranch.\nTwo years later, that gateway is under new management. Part of Dean Ranch has quietly shifted into the neighboring city of Willow Park through the legal process enacted in SB 2038.\nIn the Aledo case, developer Logan Beall of Beall Development pulled 317 acres out of Fort Worth\u2019s ETJ to join Willow Park, where he\u2019s planning a $500 million community of homes, apartments and light industrial uses near Interstate 20 and FM 1187. Beall said the decision came down to infrastructure.\n\u201cWillow Park had the sewer capacity ready,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cIt allowed us to get going fastest.\u201d\nWillow Park Assistant City Manager Toni Fisher said the city council already approved a development agreement and that other Dean Ranch landowners are exploring similar annexations.\nBut the jurisdictional shuffle sparked friction: Fort Worth and Aledo attorneys accused Willow Park of overstepping by annexing a 10-acre stretch of Bankhead Highway right-of-way. City officials are negotiating behind closed doors.\nStatewide, the new law prompted thousands of \u201cde-annexation\u201d petitions and legal challenges from cities like\nGrand Prairie\n, whose lawsuit was dismissed this spring.\nMeanwhile, cities are racing to adapt. Fort Worth received nearly 5,000 acres\u2019 worth of release requests, according to city data, raising fears of \u201cSwiss cheese\u201d development patterns that disrupt long-term infrastructure planning.\nThe city of Austin had\n191 petitions\nfor \u201cdirect release\u201d in the first two months alone when the law took effect in 2023.\nFor developers, it\u2019s a new era of leverage.\n\u201cHaving a choice is not a bad thing,\u201d Beall said.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The walled and gated property includes a regulation tennis court, a private courtyard and a 42-foot-long pool.\nIt\u2019s one of several homes in the Crespi Estates, a subdivision that the\nCenturion American\nmagnate is developing on land that formerly belonged to the\nCrespi Estate\n, a manor at 5619 Walnut Hill Lane designed for Italian Count Pio Crespi.\nMoayedi bought the Crespi Estate at auction for $36.2 million in 2017 and replatted about 12 acres to develop spec mansions that quickly joined the historic property as some of Texas\u2019 priciest homes.\nThe home was taken off the market in February and relisted in April for $14.9 million, the price it was asking when it sold. The final sales price wasn\u2019t disclosed.\nThe buyer is Hector Martinez Martinez, and the purchase took place in September, according to county records. Since no financing instrument is recorded on the property, Martinez may have paid cash. Moayedi was offering owner financing at 6.5 percent interest with a 25 percent down payment.\nDave Perry-Miller agents represented both parties, with Charles Gregory listing the home and Ryan Streiff representing the buyer.\nOther Crespi Estates properties include\n5531 Walnut Hill Lane\n, which was Texas\u2019 most-expensive new listing\nwhen it was under construction\nin July 2023 with a $16 million price. The completed home is asking $16.5 million, down from $17.6 million in May.\nAsking $64 million, the original Crespi Estate, now owned by the Cox Charlee Lochridge Dynasty Trust, is one of the most expensive listings in Texas.\n",

        "content": "After months of forecasting disaster, real estate responded to Zohran Mamdani\u2019s election victory with a resounding shrug.\nLeading up to the election, industry players across sectors threw their money and their mouths behind the mayor-elect\u2019s opponents, including\nshelling out $13 million\nfor political action committees aimed at defeating Mamdani and/or putting former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in Gracie Mansion.\nSince the results were called late Tuesday night, several of Mamdani\u2019s most vocal adversaries in real estate appear to be backing off of some of their more grim predictions. Some are extending olive branches in the hopes for a seat at the table with the incoming administration.\n\u201cI want to give the guy a chance,\u201d Brown Harris Stevens CEO Bess Freedman\ntold TRD on Wednesday\n. \u201cHe wants to achieve great things and make people\u2019s lives better, and I respect that.\u201d\nThe chief executive\u2019s tone seems to have shifted from July, when she told the New York Times she considered Mamdani inexperienced, among other concerns.\n\u201cHe\u2019s never even worked at a McDonald\u2019s, let alone run the greatest city in the world,\u201d Freedman told the outlet (though she added that \u201cthe world will clearly not come to an end\u201d if Mamdani were to win the election).\nPeter Riguardi, president of JLL\u2019s New York office, on Wednesday sent employees what he described as a unifying email urging them to \u201cgive him a chance to lead,\u201d adding that \u201cmaybe for those of us who doubt him, he\u2019ll surprise us.\u201d (Not everyone at the company adopted the same conciliatory attitude. A top broker at the firm, Scott Pranzer,\nwas fired\nlater that day over his response to the email, which included comparing Mamdani to Hitler.)\nEven Compass agent Jason Haber, who led a fundraising push for a PAC benefitting Cuomo, changed his tune \u2014 though only slightly.\nAfter Mamdani\u2019s win was announced, Haber said it \u201cwould be foolish to reject everything carte blanche\u201d \u2014 this coming from the man who\npreviously said\n, \u201cevery one of his policies, every one, will make the city less affordable and less livable and less safe\u201d and that Mamdani \u201cseems to have an allergy towards entrepreneurs in this city.\u201d\nBut a win is a win, and it appears real estate is\nready to forgo\nsome of its more harsh criticisms of Mamdani to rally behind the one thing they may have in common with the Assembly member: bringing more housing to New Yorkers.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nDuring third-quarter earnings calls, brokerage executives routinely touted their investments in artificial intelligence technology for agents. But which of those tools are agents actually using and which are just noise? Send your thoughts to\nsheridan.wall@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nRoughly\n125 million commercial airline passengers traveled through\nthe three largest airports in the New York City metropolitan area last year, according to data from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Those airports \u2014 JFK, LaGuardia and Newark \u2014 are among the 40 ordered to reduce operations this week amid the government shutdown.\nElsewhere\u2026\nRepublican congresswoman Elise Stefanik, who represents a district in northern New York, announced on Friday that she plans to enter the race for the state\u2019s next governor,\nABC 7\nreported. Stefanik, known as a strong supporter of President Donald Trump, will challenge the incumbent Gov. Kathy Hochul, of whom she has been a vocal critic.\nFollowing previous denials and a reported push from the president, the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Conservation greenlit a water-quality permit needed to advance a proposed gas pipeline that would run near Staten Island and the Rockaways, according to\nGothamist\n.\nGracie Mansion is haunted, Mayor Eric Adams said during his\ninterview with comedian Ziwe\n. Their discussion began with his efforts to crack down on the city\u2019s rat population and ended with what he looks for in a handshake. Memorable stops in between included a question from Ziwe about why Adams didn\u2019t get a hair transplant during any of his numerous trips to Istanbul, a nod to the federal charges filed against the mayor.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$19 million\nfor 40 Fifth Avenue, PHC. The Greenwich Village co-op unit last sold in 2023 for $17 million. The seller is listed as Randolph Lerner.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$33.3 million\nfor 765 First Avenue. The Turtle Bay rental building has 32 units and is 15,500 square feet. The sale is between two United Nations missions of Qatar and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $65 million for 70 Vestry Street, Unit PHS. The Tribeca condo is 7,800 square feet.\nThe Modlin Group\nhas the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 47,386-square-foot, two-story building at 1200 Manhattan Avenue in Brooklyn. Sherri Privitera of Populous is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann\n",

        "content": "Namdar Realty Group hasn\u2019t necessarily shed its reputation as a bottom feeder while swallowing whole chunks of America\u2019s troubled real estate.\nBut the\nGreat Neck, New York-based firm\n\u2014 led by a family that\u2019s among a bevy of heavyweight real estate players from a Long Island enclave about an hour by train from Manhattan \u2014 is also creating a whole new profile outside its traditional penchant for distressed retail. From\ndiscounted office building deals in Chicago\nto huge development plays on the East Coast, Igal Namdar\u2019s firm is on a dealmaking streak approaching 10 figures.\nOver the past year, Namdar emerged as one of the country\u2019s most dependable buyers of properties in need of a turnaround, with Chicago as its new favorite hunting spot. Between deals in the Windy City it has landed large construction loans to add residential towers to the landscapes of\nJersey City\nand Miami.\nIn the Loop, Namdar and frequent collaborator\nMason Asset Management\njust struck a deal for\n190 South LaSalle Street\nafter a previous buyer backed out, marking their latest in a string of acquisitions across the city\u2019s wounded office and retail sectors. The duo also is snapping up\nState Street retail\nat a steep discount, and earlier this year bought debt on another\nLaSalle Street office tower for pennies\non the dollar.\nTheir retail ambitions have stretched from the Magnificent Mile, where they took control of retail space at\n701 North Michigan Avenue\nlast year, to the region\u2019s\nstruggling malls\n, where they\u2019re battling municipalities and potentially even selling to a group planning to reinvent dead space as a logistics play. Namdar\nsued Calumet City\nearlier this year over its attempt to seize the River Oaks Center, while Ford City Mall, another Namdar property on Chicago\u2019s Southwest Side, is now slated for a sale to\nBridge Industrial\nfor redevelopment as a warehouse conversion.\nIf Chicago is Namdar\u2019s playground, the Bay Area is its frontier \u2014 this week the firm picked up the\nSouthland Mall in Hayward from Brookfield\n, continuing its national spree of buying distressed regional malls once considered crown jewels of suburban retail. Namdar\u2019s willingness to buy where others won\u2019t \u2014 and insistence on prices only the most desperate sellers will accept \u2014 has become its signature move.\nBack east, the company has evolved into enormous leverage. This summer it locked in a $358 million financing package for two massive Jersey City projects, followed by\n$460 million from Scale Lending\nfor Florida multifamily developments. Those loans pushed Namdar\u2019s construction and redevelopment pipeline into the billions, cementing its transition from retail scavenger to full-spectrum builder and turnaround player.\nBut wherever Namdar goes,\nfriction tends to follow\n. The firm\u2019s aggressive style has sparked repeated legal fights and political backlash. Cities from Bloomingdale in Chicagoland to suburban New York jurisdictions have accused Namdar affiliates of neglecting retail assets, while the company touts new investments and partnerships. For every big closing, there\u2019s usually a courtroom battle not far behind.\nIgal Namdar didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nStill, in a market paralyzed by high interest rates, dwindling numbers of equity partners and lender anxiety, few players are making moves at Namdar\u2019s scale and pace. The firm\u2019s website as of Friday claimed it owns 376 properties totaling nearly 79 million square feet across 37 states.\nWhether it\u2019s opportunism or overreach depends on who you ask \u2014 and only time will tell.\nAs the firm buys, borrows and brawls coast to coast, one thing is clear in any case: in 2025\u2019s high-stakes real estate landscape, the house of Namdar is playing every hand it can get.\n",

        "content": "You won\u2019t hear a lot about office woes in Orange County, but nowhere is perfect.\nThe commercial mortgage-backed securities debt connected to an office park located in Westminster went to special servicing after the borrower defaulted on about $16 million debt after eight months of delinquency, according to Morningstar Credit and Trepp.\nThe three-building, mid-rise, office campus at 5405, 5455 and 5555 Garden Grove Boulevard, with a total of 150,000 square feet, is owned by Younan Properties, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The property is worth $28 million, or $187 per square foot, according to a pre-pandemic appraisal, although keeping tenants has been an issue: The campus was 98 percent full at underwriting, but had fallen to 64 percent by June 2024, per the latest available data.\nThe special servicer notified the borrower but had not received a response as of October, according to servicer commentary via Morningstar.\nLeases over losses?\nHudson Pacific Properties\u2019 chairman and chief executive Victor Coleman can tout an office recovery all he wants, but the company is still\nbleeding money\n.\nThe Los Angeles-based real estate investment trust reported losses of $294 million in the nine months ended September 30 compared with $197 million a year earlier. The company mostly blamed the studio business, which is lagging throughout Los Angeles, for losses.\nColeman took the opportunity of the third-quarter earnings call to boast about technology and artificial intelligence companies and their need for office space in the Bay Area\u2014although he missed a chance to name-drop Elon Musk, whose company\nleased\n100,000 square feet at a Hudson Pacific office property in Palo Alto.\nIn all fairness, the company has inked 1.7 million square feet of leases in the nine months ending September, which it said is its best year-to-date leasing performance since before the pandemic. But office revenues are still declining and total occupancy is lower than 80 percent.\nIt remains to be seen whether the losses or leases will win out when it comes to Coleman\u2019s compensation. Last year, he raked in about $25 million worth\nof salary, stocks and bonuses\nwhile his company\u2019s losses ballooned to $364 million.\nEarnings elsewhere\nBy the numbers: Office-and-apartment REIT Douglas Emmett reported a net loss of $11 million in the third quarter compared to a $5 million profit a year earlier. Revenues were unchanged at $251 million.\nRetail developer and landlord Macerich reported a $87 million loss compared to $108 million loss the year before \u2014 and revenue increased to $253 million from $220 million.\nCommercial investor Kennedy Wilson reported a net loss of $21 million compared to $77 million during the same period, but revenues declined to $116 million from $127.5 million.\nA Lincoln buy\nLincoln Property Company\npurchased\na Manhattan Beach office building for $70 million to knock it down and replace it with apartments \u2014 and the seller, Continental Development Corporation, issued a $45 million note to make it happen.\nThe deal for the 123,000-square-foot property at 1500 Rosecrans Avenue came out to $569 per square foot.\nThe Beach Cities office sector, which encompasses Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach, has a 15 percent vacancy rate \u2014 much better than downtown Los Angeles\u2019 33.3 percent. But the average Manhattan Beach home value is $3 million and the average rent is $5,500 a month, so it seems Lincoln thought apartments were a better bang for its buck.\n",

        "content": "There are two types of people in Dallas real estate: those who think\ndowntown Dallas\npeaked in the twentieth century, and those who say the urban core\u2019s best days are ahead.\nFolks in the former camp point to the collapse of the\ncity\u2019s identity as an office destination\n, accelerated by the pandemic and made worse by public safety issues. Those on the opposite side urge the public to be patient and let the\n$3.7 billion convention center renovation\nproject do its magic and usher the city into a new era.\nOf course, for biggest cheerleaders in both of those groups, weighing in on the future of Dallas\u2019 downtown isn\u2019t just a matter of perspective; it\u2019s a bet with pretty high financial stakes.\nAs Pacific Elm\u2019s Jonas Woods points out, \u201cThere\u2019s a serious financial incentive to push tenants to more expensive buildings.\u201d\nSuburban office owners and tenant rep brokers both stand to gain when downtown tenants head elsewhere. Therefore, it pays to maintain the perception of downtown as dangerous and undesirable, he asserts.\nWoods, on the other hand, has bet his career on the transformative power of adaptive reuse for downtown Dallas, contending that the urban core has a future as a live-work-play destination if only the aging office stock can be reimagined.\nIt\u2019s not just theoretical for Woods, who\u2019s also AT&amp;T\u2019s landlord. The telecoms giant has been\ncontemplating a move to the suburbs\n, which could have troubling effects for its downtown home at Whitacre Tower, the 1.1 million-square-foot office behemoth at 208 South Akard Street.\nRegardless of who\u2019s right, it\u2019s undeniable that the downtown pessimists are persuasive. In addition to AT&amp;T, the Dallas Mavericks and Stars are similarly contemplating moves to the \u2018burbs as they run up against leases at American Airlines Center (which isn\u2019t technically downtown, but does a lot more for downtown than an arena in Plano would).\nCheck out this month\u2019s magazine for more on the factors affecting downtown\u2019s revival chances.\nHere\u2019s what else is going on in Texas real estate news:\nErwin Nicholas II is Mr. Real Estate. He made a name for himself as the\nluxury broker for the Houston glitterati\n\u2014 which typically requires the utmost discretion. Nicholas set off on an atypical path when he started marketing Spurs legend Tony Parker\u2019s Hill Country hacienda, tapping Twitch streamer Kat Cenat, who was looking for a place to host a 30-day \u201csubathon,\u201d to jolt the marketing of the property.\nSpeaking of the Spurs, the San Antonio basketball team was on the ballot this election and won. Alamo City voters approved two constitutional amendments to\nprovide funding for Project Marvel\n, the $4 billion plan for a downtown entertainment district that includes a new arena for the team. Voters approved $311 million in venue tax for the arena and $192 million for a new stock show and rodeo district.\nFile this under unexpected election day results:\nDemocrat Taylor Rehmet\nwon the majority of the vote in the Texas Senate District 9 race, a district President Donald Trump won handily in 2024. The district includes wealthy Fort Worth suburbs Southlake and Keller. Rehmet is likely headed to a runoff with runner-up Republican Leigh Wambsganss. The rub? Casino magnate, Mavs owner and major Republican donor Miriam Adelson was dumping cash into the race in support of pro-casino candidate Republican John Huffman. Huffman\u2019s loss to Wambsganss, who has firmly opposed any expansion of casino gambling, leaves Democrat Rehmet as Adelson\u2019s only option when it comes to her hopes for extending her Las Vegas-based gambling empire into DFW.\nAlmost\n$600 million\nworth of commercial real estate loans tied to properties in Texas headed to foreclosure auction on Tuesday. Houston has been hardest hit, month after month, and November was no different. July Residential\u2019s five-property multifamily portfolio was scheduled for sale after the firm allegedly defaulted on an $81.5 million mortgage from Voya.\n",

I can\u2019t really put it into words. I think that I\u2019m still processing a lot of it. For the last 10 months, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve taken more than two days off because every day, I get a call there\u2019s just constantly something and it\u2019s terrible. My focus is \u2018How do I make sure this next version of the Palisades or Pasadena or Altadena is not a better version of itself, but the best version of what it was and protecting that.\u2019\u201d\nThe Real Deal\nchecked in with several players in the fire recovery for the November issue of our magazine, which is rapidly approaching its one-year anniversary. From agents and architects to developers and investors, new stories are emerging.\n\u201cI think what people don\u2019t realize is how many people are back in the areas, like half of the Huntington [Palisades neighborhood],\u201d said Carolwood Estates\u2019 Nichole Shanfeld. \u201cThere are a lot of people back and choosing to go back willingly\u2026. We need to eliminate this fear of being a dead town. It would be helpful for people to know their neighbors are back.\u201d\nReal estate buys into Estate Media\nCount\nEstate Media\nas a contender in the real estate media landscape.\nThe content platform started by Compass\u2019 Josh Flagg, CEO Griff O\u2019Brien and Carolwood LP principal Andrew Shanfeld announced $1 million in seed funding.\nThe round attracted a who\u2019s who of real estate, with investors that include Compass\u2019 Tracy Tutor, Chad Carroll in Miami and the Hudson Advisory team of New York. George Laughton of My Home Group in Arizona also invested.\nEstate Media\u2019s stated ambition is to produce everything from original shows for various social media channels to trade-focused educational programs.\nFrom a business standpoint, Estate Media \u2013 now two years old \u2013 turned profitable in the current quarter. It\u2019s generated $6 million in revenue to date and is set to see 2026 revenue reach eight figures, according to O\u2019Brien.\nHollywood studio with history gets listed\nKenneth \u201cBabyface\u201d Edmonds\njust dropped a big slice of music history on the market in Hollywood.\nThe award-winning producer and singer-songwriter is asking just under $7 million for a two-level studio space at 751 North Highland Avenue. The upstairs, originally designed by Edmonds to be a meditation retreat, functions as a temporary residence with a full bath\nfor the artists that have worked out of that space.\nIt\u2019s a long list of big industry names that have come through the space, including Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Whitney Houston, Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Mariah Carey, Barbra Streisand and Pharrell Williams.\nRob Lowe lands buyer in Beverly Hills\nAfter more than a year on the market, different listing agents and price cuts,\nRob Lowe\nand his wife, Sheryl Berkoff, sold their Beverly Hills home at the top of Franklin Canyon.\nThe couple traded the three-bed, five-bath home for $4 million, or $1,347 per square foot. They originally listed it last July for $6.6 million.\nKeller Williams Realty Los Feliz\u2019s Lori Harris and Brock Harris, along with Carolwood Estates\u2019 Shana Tavangarian represented the sellers.

        "content": "Will the only congressional district entirely within the City of San Francisco go from power player to policy wonk?\nThat will be the case if State Senator Scott Wiener\u2013perhaps the most effective legislator of the past generation on reshaping the state\u2019s housing policy\u2013has his way.\nPower player Nancy Pelosi threw the door open on the 11th District seat she has held since the 1980s, a decision that came after years of speculation over her future, and amid growing discontent over the median age in Congress, and fresh signs of generational upheaval in political leadership.\nThe pending exit by Pelosi\u2013the first woman to serve as Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and a two-time holder of that gavel\u2013may have been expected. Wiener threw his hat in the ring last month, weeks before Pelosi\u2019s plans were clear, and her official announcement now clears the biggest hurdle from Wiener\u2019s path.\nWiener\u2019s impact stretches\nfrom putting teeth in the state\u2019s local housing mandates\nin 2017, to successfully leading a bill signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom last month to\nupzone property along transit lines\nin the state\u2019s most populous counties.\nWiener told CBS this week that, among other priorities in healthcare and energy, he wants to get the federal government back into helping to solve the nation\u2019s housing crisis \u2014 a similar mission he carried at the state level in Sacramento.\nThe state senator is so far up against Saikat Chakrabarti, a self-funded progressive candidate who has been campaigning for months. Chakrabarti\u2019s bid picks up some significant cachet owing to his prior service as chief of staff to U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New Yorker who has become a leading next-generation progressive with the Democratic Party.\nOne of Wiener\u2019s marquee accomplishments in his state legislative tenure was to require cities and counties throughout California to permit significantly more housing construction. In San Francisco, that state is requiring the city to make room for 82,000 new housing units by 2031. To accomplish that, local lawmakers are mulling a plan to upzone neighborhoods across the city.\nIntroduced by Mayor Daniel Lurie,\nthe Family Zoning Plan\nis slowly making its way through the approval process. However, as talk about upzoning grows, so, too, do displacement fears. In response, the San Francisco Planning Commission on Thursday\nunanimously supported reinforced tenant protections\nand new restrictions on housing demolitions as a way to preserve existing levels of affordable and rent controlled housing throughout the city.\nThe effort is classically San Franciscan, with local lawmakers taking existing state law and turning\nit up a few notches. For instance, the state\u2019s Housing Crisis Act of 2019 requires property owners who demolish affordable or rent protected units to replace them with the same number of bedrooms. If this new round of tenant and demolition protections pass for San Francisco, not only will the replacement units need the same number of bedrooms, as state law requires, they will also need the same number of full bathrooms and 90 percent of the original square footage.\n",

        "content": "New York City\u2019s Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani was on the minds of Miami developers, brokers and billionaires last week.\nHis win on Tuesday has fueled a number of memes and social media posts claiming that a mass exodus of wealthy New Yorkers to Florida is already underway. He\u2019s promised to freeze rents on rent-stabilized buildings and increase corporate and income taxes.\nAt\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s Miami Real Estate Forum, held on Wednesday and Thursday, Mamdani was at the center of many conversations. While he disagrees with Mamdani\u2019s politics, hospitality mogul Sam Nazarian said his campaign \u201chit a chord for the next generation.\u201d\nDeveloper Kevin Maloney joked that he contributed to Mamdani\u2019s campaign. The joke is that his win will benefit Maloney and other developers in two ways: driving down the price of real estate in New York City and propelling more ultra-high net worth individuals to Florida, where Maloney has a number of projects underway. \u201cMamdani, I think, is probably going to end the city,\u201d he\nsaid on a panel\nwith developers Bruce Eichner and Carlos Rosso.\nBut most speakers were a bit more skeptical. Mamdani\u2019s election is prompting New Yorkers who were already considering a move, they said.\nDevelopers Ugo Colombo, Camilo Miguel Jr. and Edgardo Defortuna, and broker Craig Studnicky all said the expected influx of New Yorkers will fall short of that seen during and immediately after the pandemic.\nAgents said they\u2019re receiving calls post-election, but \u201cmost of them were people venting,\u201d Danny Hertzberg said. And contracts are\nstill being signed in New York\n, residential agents in the city told my colleagues in New York. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear any more nonsense from Florida brokers,\u201d said Serhant\u2019s Ravi Kantha.\nThe political divide between more liberal cities like New York and Miami was on full display at another big conference last week, where President Trump, developer Steve Witkoff (now United States Special Envoy to the Middle East), billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Jamie Dimon and others spoke.\nGriffin relocated his multibillion-dollar hedge fund Citadel to Miami from Chicago in 2022, driven by politics and a lack of state income tax in Florida.\nGriffin has spent and plans to invest billions of dollars in South Florida. On Friday, the hedge funder announced a $20 million gift to Vizcaya Museum and Gardens and the relocation of a historic house on his waterfront Miami property to Vizcaya. Also last week, Griffin announced a $5 million gift to Lotus House, the biggest women\u2019s homeless shelter, which opened a new 70,000-square-foot campus in Miami\u2019s Overtown.\nInterviewed by Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier, Griffin said he prays that Mamdani implements policies that are \u201cdifferent than the talking points he used to win the mayoral race.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived in a failed city state. I lived in Chicago for 30 some years. I have two colleagues who had bullets fly through cars and a colleague stabbed outside the front door of her office,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cI really hope that when Mamdani thinks about leadership, he thinks about the right role models. And there\u2019s a lot to copy from our great state of Florida and from this great city of Miami.\u201d\nGriffin plans a nearly $2 billion headquarters for Citadel and Citadel Securities in Miami. In New York, Griffin, Vornado Realty Trust and Rudin are also building a 1.7 million-square-foot tower at 350 Park Avenue, which will be anchored by Citadel and Citadel Securities.\nWitkoff told Baier that he tells his son, Witkoff CEO Alex Witkoff, to not sell any real estate.\n\u201cWe have a lot in Florida. We\u2019ve got a big, deep, long bet on Florida, for all the obvious reasons,\u201d Witkoff said. \u201cThe only downside to Florida people can think of is hurricanes.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nIf you have buyers who said they are leaving New York specifically because of Mamdani, send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential:\nTodd and Brandie Herbst sold the single-family home at 167 Everglade Avenue in Palm Beach for just over $21 million \u2014 about $500,000 over the asking price \u2014 to Everglade167 LLC. Todd Herbst co-founded Big Time Restaurant Group in 1993.\nCommercial:\nIn Palm Beach Gardens, Aventura-based Advenir offloaded an apartment complex at\n4120 Union Square Boulevard\n, known as the Palm Beach Gardens Apartments, for $117.9 million. An LLC tied to Boston-based West Shore purchased the property.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nAn oceanfront estate in Palm Beach hit the market for $185 million. The late real estate developer Murray Goodman and his wife, Joanie Goodman, owned the 2.2-acre property at 911 North Ocean Boulevard. It\u2019s on the market with their daughter, Illustrated Properties agent Marley Overman. The property has 250 feet of frontage along the Atlantic Ocean and a nearly 24,000-square-foot multi-structure estate with 12 bedrooms, 16 full bathrooms and four half-bathrooms, according to the listing. It\u2019s being marketed as a teardown.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nFlorida is one of the hardest hit states by the federal government shutdown. About 95,000 federal workers in the Sunshine State have lost an average of $10,363 each, according to the\nTallahassee Democrat\n.\nElsewhere in Florida\nRoughly 268,000 Venezuelans in the U.S. lost their Temporary Protected Status on Friday, stripping them of legal status and work authorization and leaving them vulnerable to deportation, the\nMiami Herald\nreports.\nStarting on Friday, the government shutdown led to more than 110 flight cancellations and nearly 600 delays across major Florida airports, including Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, Miami and Tampa, the\nPalm Beach Post\nreports.\nBillionaire developer Jorge P\u00e9rez and other investors plan to replace a crucial 700,000-barrel fuel depot on Fisher Island with luxury condo towers, sparking concern from Miami-Dade officials about the effect on the port and local economy, according to\nBloomberg\n. County commissioner Raquel Regalado called it an \u201cexistential crisis.\u201d",

        "content": "October was a stellar month for the Chicago area\u2019s lakefront getaways.\nA string of\nhigh-end sales in Lake Geneva\nput the fight for scant inventory on full display, while North Shore towns hosted some standout deals, continuing the run of luxury real estate in Chicagoland.\nFresh off the heels of making the biggest single-home resale deal in Chicagoland\u2019s history in August, Jena Radnay of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate landed the second-priciest home sale of the year with a\n$14.5 million Kenilworth estate\n.\nThe 8,300-square-foot lakefront mansion was the most expensive home to sell in\nKenilworth\nin the 2020s. The six-bedroom, 10 bathroom home at 219 Sheridan Road was sold by designer Yoanna Kulas, and the buyers have not been identified.\nRadnay\n, who has sold some of the most expensive homes in the region this year along an elite stretch of\nSheridan Road\nin the North Shore suburbs, represented both the buyer and the seller.\nNorth Shore homes have been\nrecording eye-popping sales all year\n, leading the way in the area\u2019s luxury home sales. But lakefront houses in the Wisconsin resort town of Lake Geneva had a great run in October as well.\nLake Geneva lakefront lands $10.3M deal\nIn one of the highest-dollar sales on Geneva Lake this year, a lakefront home on Lake Shore Drive a short walk from downtown Lake Geneva sold for $10.3 million last month.\nThe 7,900-square-foot house sold for close to $500,000 above the asking price, a 5 percent premium. Listing agent Bob Webster of Compass, who represented the buyer and seller, said the seller received five offers on the house, and it went under contract within three days.\nOctober was a standout month for Lake Geneva\u2019s upper-end market. Three more sales of $7 million or more closed there last month. Two other lakefront houses, priced at $6 million and $7.4 million, went under contract in October.\nLakefront listings in Lake Geneva are going fast, often getting contracts after just a few days on the market. Webster, who also sold an $8.7 million listing in the Wisconsin resort town last month, said there is likely to be more selling activity in the upper market this year.\nLake Forest mansion scratches top of market\nTo kick off the month, a mansion in Lake Forest sold for the highest price in three years in an $11 million deal.\nThe\n11,800-square-foot house\nfeatured a glass-paned indoor conservatory, ornate landscaping and elaborate gardens. It was listed in August 2024 at nearly $15 million. Ann Lyon with @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate had the listing, and @properties\u2019 Amanda McMillan represented the buyer.\nThe mansion housed a long lineage of Chicago business leaders. It was built in 1912 for John T Pirie, president of Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Company, a dry goods and department store company. It was later owned by Laurance Armour Jr., part of the Armour meat packing family who was the vice chairman of the board at LaSalle Bank.\nThe house was sold by the estate of Posy Krehbiel, the ex-wife of John Krehbiel Jr., who she bought the property with in 1988. John Krehbiel Jr. was the co-chairman of electronics company Molex, which Koch Industries bought in 2013.\nOak Brook home brings in $5.3 million\nThe only house in the western suburbs to crack $5 million last month was a secluded\nOak Brook mansion\nin a gated community surrounded by green space.\nA 10,000-square-foot home on Fox Trail Court sold for $5.3 million, the highest price achieved in that suburb since 2009. The one-acre property is in the gated Hunter Trails community, which sits between forest preserves, country clubs and a spacious park.\nThe home generated more interest than usual for a listing of its price, listing agent Michael Lafido said. It received multiple offers and sold for $105,000 over asking.\nOnly a few other homes in the western suburbs have brought in higher sales prices this year. Hinsdale has been the site of three sales over $5.5 million this year, and a Barrington house featured in the Fox TV series \u201cEmpire\u201d sold for $6.5 million after spending more than a decade on the market and cutting its asking price by more than half.\nKenilworth home sets inland record\nIt\u2019s not just lakefront properties that are setting impressive records. In Kenilworth, a house off the lake\nsold Oct. 10 for $6.1 million\n, a likely record for an off-lake house in the village.\nFrom the outside, the house appears similar to its original 1896 neoclassical design. But the interior has been gutted and renovated with an open floor plan and modern finishes. The extensive interior work and expansion of the back of the house was led by the sellers, Stephan and Janet Scholl, who bought the property in 2021. It has six bedrooms and seven bathrooms, along with a detached three-car garage that includes an office.\nThe house, on Kenilworth Avenue, is a short walk from the Lake Michigan shoreline. John Mawicke of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate represented the seller and buyer.\n",

        "content": "They say a classic never goes out of style.\nChanging trends in the luxury market\nare testing whether that\u2019s the case.\nWith the\nluxury market slowing\n, especially across the\nSun Belt\n, some agents say homes with historic designations or architectural significance can hold value more steadily.\n\u201cBuying a home in a historic district, you are actually hedging against market swings. They tend to perform better longer-term,\u201d said Douglas Elliman agent Emily Waldmann, who works in Austin.\nNationally, luxury homes are taking about a week longer to sell compared to last year, according to\nRedfin\n. Luxury is appreciating faster than non-luxury, possibly due to lending trends that don\u2019t affect cash buyers, but luxury sales are near the lowest levels on record for Redfin.\nAustin has gone through some of the most radical market changes in the state, booming in 2020 and 2021 before contracting to a\nbuyer\u2019s market\nthis year.\nFor Austinites looking for a sure thing, Victorians or mid-century moderns \u201care definitely more of a premium,\u201d Waldmann said.\n\u201cYou can buy a\nnew construction home\nbuilt in the last three years at any point in the market. But if that home that\u2019s been around for a hundred years finally hits the market, and this is your one chance before it switches ownership for another 30 years, you\u2019re more likely to swing the bat,\u201d Waldmann said.\nNon-historic luxury homes rise and fall more with the market, according to Robert Searcy, a Houston agent who specializes in historic and architecturally significant properties.\n\u201cGood markets, bad markets, supply and demand has always got to rule the day, and there\u2019s always got to be an audience for the more historically significant houses, the more architecturally interesting houses,\u201d Searcy said.\nOwing to a generally steady flow of businesses moving to Dallas, North Texas\u2019 luxury market hasn\u2019t sagged as much as Austin\u2019s. However, luxury sales have still declined 4 percent year over year in Dallas, according to Redfin.\nAllie Beth Allman agent Michael Humphries said historic luxury inventory can \u201cmaintain value,\u201d but it generally trails new builds.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of times when the dirt outweighs what the value is worth to redo it, and it makes more sense to tear them down. That\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing a lot of in these areas,\u201d Humphries said, mentioning Preston Hollow, Park Cities and the M Streets.\nDallas \u201ctakes the cake\u201d on historic teardowns, according to Humphries.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more wealth here in Dallas than there is in other major markets in Texas,\u201d Humphries said.\nMary Alice Garrison, another Allie Beth Allman agent who often sells in Dallas historic districts, said Victorian or architecturally significant homes without historic protection are frequently razed in desirable neighborhoods like Highland Park.\n\u201cHighland Park is kind of notorious for that,\u201d Garrison said.\n",

Joseph Group\u2019s Rachel Joseph and Will Joseph marketed the property on behalf of Dean C. Hallett, an executive coach and leadership trainer, and wife Kelli Hallett. The couple bought the home in December 2017 for $4.4 million, property records indicate.\n\u201cThe Strand sales are typically outliers and people expect sales on The Strand to reach the $10 million-plus range,\u201d said Rachel Joseph. \u201cWhy the sale at 2722 Hermosa Avenue is so special \u2014 that sale set a record sales price for any Hermosa Avenue single-family sale in the entire history of Hermosa Beach real estate. It still is the record-setting number.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A Brooklyn townhouse has set the record for priciest sale in the borough.\nEli Gindi, a member of the\nGindi real estate family\n, sold his home at 2126 East Fourth Street in South Brooklyn\u2019s Gravesend neighborhood for $32 million, according to property records.\nThe buyer of Gindi\u2019s home was identified as Victor Hakim, CEO and founder of Choice Home Warranty, according to PincusCo, which first reported the deal.\nThe sale of the roughly 10,000-square-foot home involved some delicate ownership maneuvers. Gindi transferred the deed to an LLC two weeks before selling the shares in the corporation to Hakim, according to property records. The home was built in 2006, according to Curbed.\nThe sale price surpasses the borough\u2019s previous record for a single-family sale, set by 8 Montague Terrace in Brooklyn Heights, which sold for $25.5 million in 2020.\nThe family that made its fortune founding the discount department store Century 21 in the 1960s moved past retail and into real estate, accumulating a vast portfolio under Gindi Capital across Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens that it sold for $164 million in 2012.\nThe family has remained active in the city, currently working with Legion Investment Group on a\nluxury condo offering at 38 Gramercy Park North\n. Legion and Gindi closed on the final two properties in a six-parcel assemblage earlier this year.\nElsewhere in the city, Gindi is\nfacing foreclosure with another prominent South Brooklyn\nresident and Wharton Properties founder, Jeff Sutton. The two are among a group of investors that TD Bank claimed did not pay back their loan on a Midtown retail building in a complaint filed earlier this year.\nSutton himself\npurchased a home\nin Gravesend in June for $7 million at 2085 East Third Street, less than one block away from Gindi\u2019s old home.\nGindi\u2019s sale represents a massive escalation for prices in the area, where homes rarely touch the eight-figure threshold.

        "content": "Miami\u2019s status as a top destination for real estate developers, brokers, foreign investors and New Yorkers was on full display at\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s Miami Real Estate Forum last week.\nThe two-day conference attracted thousands of attendees and dozens of developers, brokers, lenders, architects and other vendors who featured their products and projects at the showcase component. Espresso and champagne flowed, and new development merchandise was offered at elaborately built-out booths. The event was held at Mana Wynwood on Nov. 5 and 6.\nDespite challenges that include a difficult and time-consuming permitting process, high interest rates and more, speakers were bullish on the region. They pushed back on negative views.\nHere are some of the biggest takeaways:\nIn a one-on-one with\nTRD\nPublisher Amir Korangy, multifamily investor\nPatrick Carroll reflected\non his past controversies and his diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Carroll said he plans to re-enter the real estate game in 2027 once his noncompete agreement expires, and he projected $500 million to $1 billion in acquisitions.\nOn a separate panel,\nmultifamily developers\nBruce Menin, Erik Rutter and Joe Lubeck said that South Florida is \u201creally not overbuilt.\u201d Demand is high, especially for high-end apartments. Even though debt markets are robust, the true issue for South Florida\u2019s multifamily market is skittish equity, the panelists said, again arguing that only top sponsors and projects in premier neighborhoods can get investment.\nThe lack of affordable housing came up a few times. That\u2019s pushing local residents toward other growing Florida markets such as Orlando,\nsaid developer Dan Kodsi\non a panel about how developers can survive the market crunch in Miami. Market analyst Ana Bozovic pushed back on the theory of a Miami bubble, arguing that the market is \u201cbuilt on cash\u201d and not subject to a debt-fueled collapse like in 2008. Kodsi and Two Roads Development\u2019s Brad Meltzer both addressed separate projects tied up in litigation \u2014 Kodsi\u2019s Legacy Hotel &amp; Residences and Two Roads\u2019 planned Edition Residences \u2014 and said they would ultimately be resolved and built.\nWhile domestic buyers now outpace foreign buyers,\ninternational investors\nare still very active, especially those from countries like Mexico, Brazil and Colombia, said panelists Edgardo Defortuna and Craig Studnicky on a panel about foreign investment.\nOn the\noffice front\n, experts said the market is still driven by new-to-market tenants from states such as New York and California. New, boutique office projects are commanding record-high rents, such as The Fifth Miami Beach reaching $180 per square foot to $240 per square foot. Still, institutional owners are seeking exit strategies for older office buildings, with \u201cpretty much zero institutional capital chasing office,\u201d said David Moret, founder of Highline Real Estate Capital.\nDevelopers\nUgo Colombo and Camilo Miguel Jr.\nwere among the speakers who anticipate a new wave of New Yorkers moving to South Florida following Zohran Mamdani\u2019s mayoral election win, though they don\u2019t expect it to match the scale of the pandemic-era influx. The developers are dealing with headwinds like market softening in non-luxury sectors and high construction costs, but the luxury condo market remains strong, they said.\nThe strong luxury market\ndominated a panel\ncentered around luxury home design in South Florida and Naples. These buyers are increasingly demanding and seeking all-in-one primary homes with extravagant amenities.\nIt also spilled over into a conversation with brokers Margit Brandt, Danny Hertzberg and Dawn McKenna, who shared their journeys to\nachieving $100M deals\nin the luxury real estate market and how they were well-positioned for the pandemic-triggered boom in their respective markets: Miami, Palm Beach and Naples.\n",

The property at 23033 Pacific Coast Highway traded hands for $28 million four years ago; the luxe 20-room hotel has a guest-only rooftop bar and restaurant, faces Surfrider Beach and is near Malibu Pier.\nChrome Hearts chief operating officer Mario Lejtman, who is named in the deed, and Dauntless Capital Partners managing partner Cramer Williams, who signed the deed, did not respond to a request for comment.\nThis deal is an exception to the general rule of the hotel market these days in Los Angeles, where numerous\nproperties\nare defaulting on debt, facing foreclosure and a tough sales environment, in part because of the Measure ULA property transfer tax that has resulted in fewer commercial trades. Homelessness in the region is also seen as a factor in a dip in tourism that hurts revenues, while a $30 minimum wage for hotel workers is another factor spooking investors.\nBoth sides of the Malibu deal have made other buys recently.

        "content": "Zurich North America is trading in its downtown Chicago digs for a smaller, more prestigious address in the sky.\nThe insurer signed a 52,000-square-foot lease at Willis Tower, cutting its Chicago office space by more than two-thirds as it prepares to vacate\n300 South Riverside Plaza\n, a West Loop property already battling financial trouble.\nThe move will relocate the tenant\u2019s Chicago workspace to the 53rd and 54th floors of Blackstone\u2019s Willis Tower next year. Todd Mintz with JLL represented Zurich North America in the deal, while Nikki Kern with The Telos Group represented Blackstone portfolio company Perform Properties.\nIt\u2019s a stark drop from the roughly 107,000 square feet Zurich leased at 300 South Riverside over the last 12 years, signaling how even deep-pocketed tenants are recalibrating real estate requirements in the hybrid work era.\nZurich\u2019s exit delivers another blow to 300 South Riverside\u2019s owner, a venture of investors David Werner and Joseph Mizrachi that has struggled with a complicated debt structure on the property. While they own the 23-story building, they\u2019re also encumbered by a 99-year ground lease, paying rent to land ownership that includes well-known New York investor\nRubin Schron\n.\nPlus, in 2023, they triggered a loan default on a $175 million deal that has been tricky to resolve, and have also had\nmajor tenants leave\nor cut back on their leases.\nZurich\u2019s move, while bad news for its old landlord, is a win for\nBlackstone\u2019s Willis Tower\n, which has managed to stay at the top of the market through an expensive overhaul and difficult loan extension negotiations this year.\nAfter a $500 million renovation completed in 2022, the 110-story skyscraper has consistently drawn blue-chip tenants and new capital. But whether the property is underwater on its 10-figure mortgage depends on who you ask.\nBlackstone this year received a\nsecond valuation for the building that added $370 million\nto the $1 billion appraisal it notched during its loan modification this year.\nThe extra value is derived from the Skydeck revenue, a unique source of tourist-driven income that fluctuates seasonally and depends heavily on consumer spending patterns. But without accounting for the Skydeck\u2019s contributions, the building\u2019s debt of $1.3 billion, now due in 2028, would well outweigh the real estate value.\nZurich\u2019s relocation reinforces just how uneven the recovery is.\nOffice occupancy in downtown Chicago hovered at a record low of 72 percent last quarter, and leasing is being driven almost exclusively by tenants trading up to premium, amenity-heavy buildings.\nZurich\u2019s shift mirrors recent moves by law firm\nArentFox Schiff\n, which also shrank its Willis Tower lease, and by companies like\nCars.com\n, which trimmed its space in 300 South Riverside by two-thirds to 53,000 square feet, to match hybrid work patterns.\nMeanwhile, office buildings outside the very top tier of quality are struggling with vacancy and distress.\nZurich, whose North American headquarters will stay in Schaumburg, framed the move as a long-term commitment to Chicago and its workforce. But the subtext is clear: companies want less space and more quality. That trend is leaving landlords of aging properties scrambling to hold onto tenants and make peace with lenders.\nThe move follows\nZurich\u2019s $20 million settlement\nearlier this year with Schaumburg over a dispute tied to tax incentive payouts at its 783,800-square-foot suburban headquarters.\nThe village had withheld funds over remote-work requirements, but the deal, which reduced Zurich\u2019s maximum TIF reimbursement to $80 million from $100 million, ended a three-year standoff and set clearer rules for future payouts. The resolution comes as suburban office vacancies are above 30 percent, reflecting the same post-pandemic reckoning that\u2019s driving Zurich\u2019s leaner downtown presence.\n",

        "content": "It was a notorious \u201c\nhe said\n,\nshe said\n.\u201d Now, a court has laid down its version of events in the legal dispute among former leaders at a former multifamily giant.\nFairstead launched in 2014 and grew to one of the country\u2019s largest apartment landlords. By 2022, it had\n$7.8 billion in assets\nand projects in the pipeline and 24,000 housing units across 28 states with ambitions to grow even bigger.\nBut recent years have seen the firm caught up in internal disputes, landing in court and sparking multiple trials.\nIn 2016, an employee named John Tatum III joined the firm to build up a division centered on low-income housing tax credits. When that branch of the business \u201cboomed,\u201d according to the recent decision, Tatum sought more equity in that line of the business, alongside Fairstead co-founder William Blodgett, who had recruited him. Their ask kicked off a blowup. Goldberg, Blodgett, Tatum and Fairstead\u2019s previously little-known backer, billionaire hedge funder Stuart Feldman, ended up in court.\nLike many opaque business disputes, this one gained clarity in the Delaware Court of Chancery. In late October, a judge sided with Tatum, publishing a 100-page opinion that went largely in his favor.\nThe trial, which involved 10 witnesses and nearly 2,600 exhibits, doesn\u2019t just provide a play-by-play of the drama and negotiation at Fairstead. The judge, Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster, also implied he would stand by the facts laid out in Tatum\u2019s decision when he dives into another case based on the same events: one brought by former Fairstead partner\nBlodgett,\nwhich will begin early next year.\nLaster\u2019s opinion determined the value of Tatum\u2019s equity in a Fairstead fund at $7.8 million, which will bear on Blodgett\u2019s case.\nA \u201cgolden goose\u201d\nThe judge paints a picture of competing personalities, egos and visions at Fairstead.\nInstead of \u201cOnce upon a time,\u201d Laster begins: \u201cA hedge fund manager with capital, an attorney with legal savvy, and an entrepreneur with energy and vision formed a fund complex that invested in affordable housing projects.\u201d\nThat trio are\u00a0Feldman, Goldberg and Blodgett, respectively.\nAs the judge tells it, the firm\u2019s affordable arm had been mostly in rent-stabilized stock when Tatum joined. Tatum grew Fairstead Affordable by doing low-income tax credit deals. Between 2017 and 2022, the business completed deals with developer fees of $181 million.\n\u201cBlodgett and Tatum came to believe that they had created significant value (they had) and deserved a substantial, even controlling equity stake in the business,\u201d Laster wrote.\nTatum was only entitled to 5.25 percent of the business he was building, while Feldman and Goldberg indirectly controlled the lion\u2019s share. (Blodgett had a 9.71 percent interest through an LLC that controlled Fairstead Affordable.) Tatum and Blodgett pushed for restructuring at Fairstead and a bigger piece of the pie. Both felt they also needed to offer equity to employees. Goldberg encouraged them to come up with a proposal.\nIn the summer of 2020, the pair retained a law firm to advise them on restructuring, but also on a plan B: a new company. Blodgett, who had married into the influential Tisch family, began meeting with other funders, including the offices of his extended family.\nIn early 2021, Tatum and Blodgett got a proposal from Goldberg about equity, but it involved a long-term incentive plan that made their restructuring seem unlikely.\nBlodgett\u2019s thought process is legible through notes he made to himself at the time. He considered himself the firm\u2019s \u201cgolden goose,\u201d he wrote, \u201cleveraging my name, my family\u2019s name, my relationships,\u201d while \u201cgetting NOTHING in return. NOTHING.\u201d\nHe edged closer to a decision.\n\u201cI\u2019m 38 years old,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe time is now.\u201d\nYet still hopeful about a restructuring, Blodgett presented a proposal to Goldberg: He would replace the attorney as CEO, with Tatum as COO. Goldberg dismissed it out of hand.\n\u201cRestarting is a reality,\u201d Tatum texted Blodgett after.\nAs they became more serious about leaving to start a new company, Blodgett began to share confidential Fairstead information with two separate family offices, that of the Tisches and of his father-in-law, hedge funder\nDonald Sussman\n.\nTo Feldman, he proposed a plan to give himself 40 percent of the equity and a path to full control in a decade.\n\u201cEveryone is here because of me. But they realize that I have no power. No control,\u201d Blodgett told Feldman. \u201cEveryone says it\u2019s my company.\u201d Tatum had earlier made a similar statement to Goldberg: \u201cI will not sell a dream I know nothing about and have no control over,\u201d he said in April of 2020.\nUltimately, no ideas for a new structure were approved.\nWith employees beginning to eye the exit and whispers of a new venture, Goldberg proposed a transition plan. But in September 2021, Fairstead\u2019s IT department intercepted an email to Blodgett: an invoice from the law firm he retained, about the new company.\nFeldman tried to squeeze Blodgett, terminating him for cause and canceling all his equity. Tatum resigned shortly after but continued to work for a 120-day notice period and \u201cthought he left on good terms.\u201d Blodgett started a competing venture, Tredway. Following his notice period, Tatum ultimately did not go to work for him.\nAfter Tatum left, Fairstead offered Tatum a lowball number for his equity. When Tatum rejected it, Fairstead retroactively terminated him for cause and declared his equity forfeited. Tatum sued the company. But, in a panic following the original restructuring meeting, Tatum had downloaded thousands of documents, both personal and confidential. Though he later returned most of the confidential documents, Fairstead countersued, arguing Tatum breached his employment contract and his fiduciary duty.\n\u201cNot credible\u201d\nMichael Carlinsky, an attorney with Quinn Emanuel for Fairstead, declined to comment on behalf of the company.\nThe judge rejected several points from Feldman and Goldberg\u2019s accounts.\nGoldberg at trial denied knowing that Tatum and Blodgett wanted substantial ownership and control. He also denied encouraging them to come up with a restructuring proposal and telling them that he was working on a plan to get them more equity.\nFeldman denied discussing a joint venture with Blodgett.\n\u201cThe contemporaneous documents show that Goldberg both knew what Blodgett and Tatum wanted and was trying to steer them toward possibilities that Feldman might find acceptable,\u201d Laster wrote.\nUltimately, in the case of Tatum, the court found that Goldberg and Feldman\u2019s behavior around his departure, including cancelling Tatum\u2019s equity interests, was in bad faith. Tatum was awarded the value of his 5.25 percent equity. The judge sided with Tatum\u2019s appraiser as to that value, rather than with Fairstead\u2019s. That put the award at about $7.8 million. With a percentage of the promote on two sales, damages will be nearly $10 million, before interest.\nThe judge also largely rejected Fairstead\u2019s claims of breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty, although he agreed that Tatum breached his employment contract by downloading company documents.\nFairstead was awarded the cost of investigating that breach, about $155,000.\nIn a statement, Tatum said he was still proud of what the team built at Fairstead and the partners that made it possible.\n\u201cWhat followed my exit was an orchestrated attempt by Fairstead to erase that legacy by assaulting my character, burying me in litigation, and taking what was rightfully mine,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe court\u2019s thorough decision sets the record straight.\u201d\nTatum\u2019s legal team included his wife, Sara Shaw Tatum, a litigator and former Supreme Court clerk.\nBlodgett\u2019s lawyers at Susman Godfrey declined to comment about their client\u2019s case, and it is unclear whether he would fare similarly to Tatum. In January, a different Delaware decision determined that Fairstead didn\u2019t have the right to take Blodgett\u2019s equity. In April, an arbitrator\nfound Blodgett had misused\nFairstead\u2019s proprietary information and enlisted other employees in a plan to take control of the company. Because that relates to Blodgett\u2019s employment contract, not his operating agreement, it does not imply that Blodgett\u2019s entire interests would be canceled, according to the judge.\nIn 2022, when it had a $6 billion portfolio and 16,500 units,\nGoldberg\ntold\nThe Real Deal\nthat it was aiming to have 50,000 units by 2027. Asked then about Blodgett\u2019s departure, Goldberg said: \u201cI think in some ways change is good.\u201d\n",

Houston has taken steps to demolish unsafe and vacant properties, including a few Midtown buildings slated for teardown ahead of the\n2026 FIFA World Cup\n.\nOther efforts focus on mitigation rather than demolition. The Resilient Houston plan calls for lighter-colored roofs, expanded tree canopy, and planting 4.6 million native trees by 2030.

        "content": "Manhattan\u2019s luxury market is booming despite fears that Zohran Mamdani\u2019s victory would push wealthy New Yorkers out of the city.\nBuyers signed contracts for 41 homes asking $4 million or more last week, according to Olshan Realty\u2019s weekly report. Twenty-four of those deals were inked after Tuesday night, when the results of the mayoral election were\ncalled in favor of\nthe 34-year-old Assembly member from Queens.\nLast week marked the first time 40 or more contracts were signed for luxury properties since late May. The number of pending deals was also up from the\nprevious period\u2019s\ntotal of 37.\nIn the weeks before the polls closed, headlines claimed a mass exodus of the city\u2019s richest residents, largely citing agents from nearby suburban markets and South Florida. However, warnings of a flight are\nlikely overblown\n, as several agents pointed out to\nThe Real Deal\nlast week, with some pointing to contract reports showing a market busy with high-priced deals.\nThe most expensive home to enter contract was a penthouse at\n15 Hudson Yards\n, with an asking price just under $23 million. The 5,100-square-foot duplex initially asked $30 million when it was marketed off floor plans in 2016.\nUnit PH88D has four bedrooms and seven bathrooms. It also features 26-foot-high ceilings, a double-sided fireplace and views of the Hudson River.\nAmenities at the 285-unit building, developed by Related Companies and Oxford Property Group, include a fitness center, pool, ballroom and residents\u2019 lounge.\nCorcoran\u2019s Hottinger Team and Arsic Lau Team had the listing.\nThe second priciest property to land a buyer was a unit at the Flatiron Building conversion, asking $19.4 million. Unit 3North is the first at the much-hyped project to show up in weekly contract reports, though Corcoran\u2019s Steve Gold hinted at a\nforthcoming deal\non Instagram last month, when he claimed to have represented the first buyer to sign a contract at the building.\nThe 4,800-square-foot condo has three bedrooms, four bathrooms and a great room overlooking Madison Square Park.\nAmenities at 175 Fifth Avenue include a gym, lap pool, sauna, cold plunge and billiards room. The Brodsky Group and Sorgente Group are spearheading the conversion of the early 20th-century office building, which will hold 38 residential units. The first glimpse of pricing released by the developers included, among others, an $11 million three-bedroom unit and a $50 million five-bedroom condo.\nCorcoran Sunshine, led by Donna Puzio and Angeli DeCecchis, is heading sales at the project.\nOf the 41 homes, 25 were condos, nine were co-ops, two were condops and five were townhouses.\nThe properties asked a combined $311 million, which works out to an average price of $7.6 million and a median of $5.9 million. The typical home was on the market for more than a year and had a discount of 13 percent.\n",

That is up from $1.68 billion in December 2024, but significantly below the $2.3 billion the property was appraised at when its loan was issued in 2014.\nRepresentatives for the Ghermezians and the loan\u2019s special servicer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An Ironhound Management team led by Keven Thompson negotiated the modification.\nThe Mall of America, the largest shopping mall in the U.S., is one of three mega centers owned by the Ghermezians.\nThe other two are the 5.3 million-square-foot West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, Canada, and the 3 million-square-foot\nAmerican Dream Mall\nin New Jersey. Those two malls are cross-collateralized on the same loan, and the Ghemerzians have struggled with the debt.\nThe family in 2022 got a four-year extension on the American Dream\u2019s $1.7 billion construction loan, which will come due next year.\nThe developers have\nalso struggled\nto get a proposed $5 billion American Dream Miami project off the ground.\n",

        "content": "\u201cI would never invest in rental housing in New York,\u201d a Florida real estate person emailed me in July. \u201cNo wonder there\u2019s a rental housing shortage there. New York is a terrible place to be a housing services provider.\u201d\nI like pointing out contradictions, so I replied that a housing shortage is good for investments in rental housing, because scarcity keeps rents high.\nBut the Florida guy wrote back, \u201cNot where there\u2019s rent control and a war on housing services providers. And New York is the worst!\u201d\nWhy not invest in free-market rentals, which are about half of the city\u2019s rental units?\n\u201cPrefer places where rent regulation is against the law. Less risk that my non-rent regulated investment becomes rent regulated.\u201d\nI thought: That has not happened in 50 years, and the risk of it happening again is close to zero. But I let the conversation die \u2014 or so I thought.\nThree and a half months later, Zohran Mamdani was elected mayor. Lo and behold, the Florida guy dug up our email thread and came back like a bad rash.\n\u201cStill think New York is a great place to be an HSP?\u201d he wrote.\nI was getting testy, but answered politely: \u201cIf your buildings are free-market, yes. Rent-stabilized, no. A Mamdani victory has been baked in for four months now. Free-market rents have remained strong.\u201d\nThen came a comment I wasn\u2019t expecting.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s to stop Mamdani from freezing rents on properties that are currently free market?\u201d\nWas he baiting me? No. It was an honest question \u2014 born from a fear that Mamdani is a Svengali-like figure who could turn the city into a socialist state.\nI assured the reader that the city has no authority to enact universal rent control, let alone freeze all rents. The Urstadt Law makes rent stabilization a state matter.\nThe closest that New York has come to this is\nGood Cause Eviction\n, a 2024 law that makes it hard for a landlord to evict a tenant for nonpayment after a rent increase greater than 5 percent plus the rate of inflation.\nThe initial soft cap on rents was\nnearly 9 percent\n\u2014 a far cry from a hard cap of zero percent.\nBut Mamdani has caused such panic among some people that they think he could do anything.\nReality check: Even if he hypnotized the state legislature and instructed it to pass universal rent control with zero percent increases, it would be challenged in federal court and ruled an unconstitutional taking.\nI should have known that the Florida guy wouldn\u2019t accept this. Mamdani haters have whipped themselves into an absolute frenzy. I saw one person on X tweet that every Jew she knows is talking about leaving New York \u2014 \u201cEvery. Single. One.\u201d\nShe clearly has a close circle of like-minded friends. Polling indicates about one-third of Jewish voters supported Mamdani.\nGetting back to rent control: The courts have ruled that changes to rent-regulated housing are constitutional because buyers of those buildings knew those regulations could be adjusted. That rationale would not apply to free-market buildings.\nMamdani\nhas\nproposed rent stabilization for future developments that receive a tax abatement. We actually had that system for a previous version of 421a. Now it only applies to affordable units in those tax-abated buildings.\nEven if Mamdani persuades Albany to go back to the previous system, investors would know in advance if their rental projects would be subjected to stabilization. It couldn\u2019t be applied retroactively.\nFlorida guy, unfortunately, still wasn\u2019t convinced that the \u201ctakings\u201d clause would protect owners of free-market rentals. He noted that the courts have never ruled rent control unconstitutional.\nThat\u2019s like saying the courts have never ruled murder legal. If New York passed a law legalizing murder, I am confident that the courts would strike it down.\nThe truth is, I don\u2019t have to convince people like the Florida guy that New York multifamily \u2014 except for fully rent-stabilized buildings \u2014 is a good bet, despite Mamdani\u2019s rhetoric and disdain for profit.\nSavvy investors know that a mayor only has so much power and is term-limited. If Mamdani scares some investors away, others will see an opportunity. The market will decide.\n",

        "content": "The complex process of taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public is getting yet another wrinkle.\nFederal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the mortgage giants were exploring avenues to pursue equity stakes in technology firms, Bloomberg\nreported\n. Pulte, speaking from a housing conference hosted by news and research outlet ResiClub, claimed technology companies were offering equity in exchange for partnerships.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at taking equity stakes in companies that are willing to give it to us because of how much power Fannie and Freddie have over the whole ecosystem,\u201d Pulte told ResiClub.\nPulte added that he was hoping the companies under government conservatorship would behave more like businesses. Even still, he said he expects them to remain under conservatorship, even as an initial public offering looms in the distance.\nThe administration is looking to sell shares in the two government-backed mortgage giants \u2014 under their federal conservatorship since a 2008 bailout \u2014 at a valuation that could reach $500 billion and raise about $30 billion.\nIt\u2019s in line to be one of the largest public offerings ever and\nbanks are lining up\nto get a piece of the action. The deal could bring a windfall for the federal government, which holds warrants for roughly 80 percent of both firms\u2019 common stock.\nBut it\u2019s a delicate process. Fannie and Freddie underpin almost half of all U.S. mortgages, so any mistake\ncould ripple through housing markets\nand consumer borrowing.\nPulte previously placed the administration\u2019s goal of launching the IPO by the end of the year. In his most recent comments, he said it could still come in this quarter, but could also arrive early next year.\nLast month, Priscilla Almodovar, Fannie\u2019s chief executive officer and president,\nresigned\nfrom her post atop the organization as part of a broader shakeup. Chief Operating Officer Peter Akwaboah assumed the top position in an interim capacity.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "West Shore bought a 542-unit apartment complex in Palm Beach Gardens for $117.9 million, marking a continuing uptick of multifamily investment sales in South Florida.\nBoston-based West Shore bought the Palm Beach Gardens Apartments at 4120 Union Square Boulevard from Aventura-based Advenir, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The buyer borrowed a $550 million loan that is cross-collateralized across this complex, a property in Pinellas County and out-of-state properties, with the Florida properties representing 25.3 percent of the collateral. Citybank is the lender of the financing, which matures in 2030.\nCompleted in 1970 and 1971, Palm Beach Gardens Apartments consists of 34 two-story rental buildings, a storage building and a clubhouse, Vizzda records show. The complex is on 21.5 acres.\nPalm Beach Gardens Apartments offers one-bedroom to three-bedroom apartments, with monthly rents ranging from $1,842 to over $2,855, according to its website.\nLed by David Vecchitto, Advenir bought the complex for\n$97.3 million\nin 2018, scoring an\n$80 million\nloan that year to renovate the property, records show.\nAdvenir is a developer, investor and manager of multifamily properties and single-family rental homes, according to its website. It has owned and managed more than 30,000 units since it was founded in 1996 and currently has a $2.9 billion portfolio.\nWest Shore is a multifamily investment and management firm with a portfolio of more than 18,500 units across 54 properties valued at over $4.5 billion, its website shows. It\u2019s led by Lee E. Rosenthal.\nSouth Florida\u2019s\nmultifamily market\nhas experienced a supply overhang following a construction flurry in recent years. Last year, a record\n18,600 apartments\nwere completed, outpacing 15,000 net new leases, CoStar Group data shows. This led to slower lease-ups, more concessions and a slight decline in the average asking rent in the tri-county region.\nDevelopers\ncontinue building\n, arguing that demand and rent growth will be restored by the time they finish their projects.\nMultifamily\ninvestment sales\nhave been ticking up in recent months, despite still higher interest rates. Many of the buyers are value-add investors or are circumventing the harder financing climate by using Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae loans, or debt from insurers. Others are assuming sellers\u2019 loans, relying on discretionary funds or paying all cash.\nLast month, Morgan Properties paid\n$69.95 million\nfor the 300-unit Visions at Willow Pond complex at 4860 Sand Stone Lane near West Palm Beach, and Tishman Speyer paid\n$124.5 million\nfor the 270-unit Bell at Broken Sound Apartments at 5500 Broken Sound Boulevard Northwest and 950 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway in Boca Raton.\nAlso, TA Realty bought the 476-unit San Merano at Mirasol Apartments at 100 Portofino Drive in Palm Beach Gardens for\n$193 million\nlast month.\n",

He was an advisor to Bill and Hillary Clinton on their campaigns in the 1990s and 2000s, according to published reports.\nEleyyan bought the 0.3-acre Pine Tree Drive property for $1.9 million in 2011, according to property records. He completed the nearly 11,000-square-foot mansion with eight bedrooms, six bathrooms, two half-bathrooms, a pool, a dock and 79 feet of waterfront in 2023, the listing shows. The home sold fully furnished, according to the listing.\nEleyyan first listed the mansion for $22.9 million in 2021, before bumping the price up to $24.9 million in 2022, and bringing it down to $22.5 million last year, according to Zillow.\nIt marks the latest pricey deal on one of the coveted waterfront streets in Miami Beach. In December, billionaire Teddy Sagi bought a Pine Tree Drive teardown for\n$23.8 million\n.\nIn August, Richard Schulze, the billionaire founder of Best Buy, was linked to the\n$27 million\npurchase of a waterfront spec home on the Venetian Islands. On North Bay Road in Miami Beach, Russell Weiner, the billionaire founder of Rockstar Energy, found a buyer for his waterfront home asking\n$32.5 million\n.

Of the 164 residences, 17 of the for-sale units would be set aside for moderate-income households,\ndefined\nin Los Angeles County as a maximum annual income of $89,550 for one person.\nThe project\u2019s proximity to Metro\u2019s new Foothill extension, which opened in September, is the latest addition to the region\u2019s growing\nhousing near transit\ntrend. It\u2019s unclear if MW Investment Group plans to take advantage of Transit Oriented Communities incentives offered by state and municipal governments.\nAt the same time, suburban cities across the San Gabriel Valley and the rest of Greater Los Angeles are figuring out how to meet state housing goals while managing pushback from locals. MW Investment Group has pursued similar infill plays elsewhere in the county, including a townhome project in\nWhittier\n. That project, slated to rise on a 0.8-acre site at 12826 Philadelphia Street, will consist of 24 two-, three- and four-bedroom townhomes as well as 59 parking spaces. Whittier officials signed off on the project early this year.\nLast year, San Dimas considered proposed zoning rule changes around its Metro stop that would enable the construction of up to 3,687 new homes in the city, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n. San Dimas\u2019\nhousing element\ncalls for 1,248 new housing units by 2029.\nMW\u2019s effort in San Dimas comes as\ninvestor interest in multifamily projects\ndries up despite increasing rents and demand. The City of Los Angeles in particular has been hit hard thanks in large part to\nMeasure ULA\n, the tax on property sales higher than $5 million, as well as rising construction materials and labor costs.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Jon Venetos\u2019\nmultifamily distress\n, which\nstarted in Florida\n, is permeating the Texas Triangle.\nFannie Mae slapped Venetos\u2019 Lurin Capital with a lawsuit accusing the firm of defaulting on a $77.2 million loan tied to Latitude 2976, a Houston apartment complex, according to the Nov. 6 filing in District Court for the Southern District of Texas.\nJLL Real Estate Capital provided the mortgage in June 2023, and it was assigned to Fannie Mae.\nThe loan, which has a fixed rate of 5.1 percent, matures in August 2028, the lawsuit said. Lurin stopped making payments in June, Fannie Mae alleges.\nFannie Mae further accuses Lurin of failing to keep the property in good condition.\nLurin failed to make repairs identified in a March property inspection, Fannie Mae claims. The lender said Lurin \u201cleft the Property to further deteriorate in ways that present immediate danger to tenants and accelerate waste of Fannie Mae\u2019s collateral.\u201d In addition to mold, roof leaks and cracked stairs, some residents don\u2019t have access to running water, Fannie Mae alleges.\nOver $749,000 in liens have been filed against the property, not including a $107,529 default judgment against the property awarded to a law firm that helped evict tenants from the property.\nFannie Mae is asking the District Court for the Southern District of Texas to appoint a receiver for the property, a 734-unit complex built in 1976 at 201 and 301 Wilcrest Drive. The property is south of the Buffalo Bayou, near Briar Forest.\nThe lawsuit is one of several for Jon and Ashley Venetos\u2019 \u201cvalue-add\u201d multifamily operation.\nJudge Bryan Gantt granted the city of Plano a temporary restraining order against Lurin on Oct. 27 and\nordered residents of Evana Grove Apartments to vacate\ndue to unsafe conditions.\nAccording to the filing, residents of the complex at 3500 Hillridge Drive didn\u2019t have access to water, sewer or gas \u2014 even though the property had racked up 1,459 code violations and ownership and management of Evana Grove was on the receiving end of nearly 100 lawsuits over conditions at the property.\nThe Venetoses\u2019 legal trouble started ratcheting up in the spring when lender Acore claimed Lurin defaulted on nearly $400 million worth of loans tied to properties in Florida and Texas. The 12 Florida properties\nheaded to foreclosure auction\nin April.\nAcore also claims Venetos personally guaranteed the $394.4 million he borrowed. The lender filed six lawsuits in October\nasking for judgments totaling $80.7 million\n, Venetos\u2019 payment guaranties, plus other default-related expenses, court records show.\nAcore alleges his liability was triggered when he defaulted on the loans and when he allowed mechanics\u2019 liens to be placed on the properties.\nVenetos is also fighting a\nrecent lawsuit from Select Securities Europe\n, a lender from Luxembourg that claims he defaulted on 15 loans totaling $40.5 million.\nJon and Ashley Venetos launched Lurin Capital in 2016 amid a wave of upstart real estate operators who planned to make money by purchasing Class B apartment complexes, updating them, raising rents and selling them at a profit.\nLurin\u2019s website says the firm owns 46 properties across five states, but the list includes assets that have faced foreclosure.\nInterest rates threw sand in the gears for many of them, increasing debt service on their floating-rate loans and raising construction costs. At the same time, Texas, a hotspot for value-add multifamily operators, was absorbing a historic wave of apartment development, causing rental rates and occupancy levels to fall.\nAs a result, experts anticipate\na wave of multifamily distress in Texas\n, where about $19 billion in CMBS loans tied to multifamily is set to mature in the next five years.\n",

        "content": "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is taking another swing at property tax reform, pitching a six-point plan that would slash appraisal growth, restrict local spending and give voters far greater control over tax increases.\nAbbott\u2019s proposal, announced Sunday during his reelection campaign kickoff in Houston, marks one of his most aggressive attempts yet to overhaul how Texas\nfunds local services\n\u2014 a perennial issue in a state with no income tax and fast-rising property values, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nMuch of the plan would require a constitutional amendment, with Abbott vowing to make property\ntax relief\na top legislative priority.\nAccording to Abbott, the Legislature\u2019s record $51 billion allocation for tax relief this year was blunted by\nlocal governments\nraising their own levies. His plan seeks to counter that by tying local spending growth to 3.5 percent or population plus inflation, whichever is lower, and by extending the state\u2019s debt and deficit limits to counties, cities and school districts.\nThe proposal would also require a two-thirds voter majority for any new local property tax hikes, effectively giving\ntaxpayers\nveto power over local budgets. Residents could also petition to roll back existing taxes if 15 percent of local voters sign on \u2014 a mechanism Abbott says would help check \u201crunaway\u201d local government spending.\nTo tackle the state\u2019s appraisal battles, the plan would cap homestead valuation growth at 3 percent, down from 10 percent, and extend the limit to rental and commercial properties. Appraisals would occur only once every five years, eliminating what Abbott called \u201csurprise\u201d annual increases that fuel taxpayer frustration.\nPerhaps the most sweeping measure would allow voters to decide whether to eliminate school district property taxes altogether. Those levies make up the largest share of Texans\u2019 property tax bills, but Abbott\u2019s outline offers no detail on how the state would fund schools if that revenue vanished \u2014 a likely flashpoint should lawmakers consider the plan.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

That prior record was for the $16.8 million sale of 467 Comstock Avenue, which sold for $1,763 per square foot in March.\nThe deal is a long time coming for seller Jacqueline Heller, who has owned the property since 1999 and originally sought $24.9 million for the home in 2022. It was re-priced over the years and also changed hands among listing agents during that period with the most recent ask just under $22 million, or $2,142 per square foot.\nZac Mostame and Yasmine Benmaiza of Carolwood Estates represented Heller in the deal. Victoria Velazquez of Compass\u2019 The Jancula Group represented buyer Savita Kanodia, according to public records.\nThe Strathmore Drive sale marks another record for Mostame, who along with the Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Lea Porter, represented both the buyer and seller in the off-market trade of\n1124 Napoli Drive\nin the Pacific Palisades for $25.8 million. The September deal, which equates to $2,437 per square foot, is the Palisades\u2019 top residential trade this year.\nThe Little Holmby property\u2019s original structure was built in 1937. Over a decade ago, the home was taken down to its studs and redeveloped by architect and historical restoration specialist Richard Manion and builder Richard Holz.\nThe 10,000-square-foot residence draws its design inspiration from the English countryside, with a formal living room, library with mahogany paneling, a kitchen with skylights and coffered ceilings in the living room. Outdoors, there are walking paths, a botanical garden, pool, fire pit and a dining pergola for more than 45 guests.\nAdditional highlights include a half basketball court, an elevator, two offices and a room just for wrapping gifts.\n",

        "content": "A long-awaited office tower is now one step closer to being built.\nVornado Realty Trust has filed a construction permit application for a high-rise at 350 Park Avenue. Vornado is partnering with Rudin Management and hedge fund Citadel on the development of the tower located between East 50th and 51st streets.\nThe permit application describes a 62-story building totaling more than 2 million square feet.\nCitadel, in addition to being a partner on the project, has agreed to rent space in the tower. Vornado announced in 2022 that the hedge fund giant would pay an initial rent of $36 million for the space, backdated to 2022. The company and its sister firm, Citadel Securities, plan to occupy 850,000 square feet in the building.\nCitadel, Vornado and Rudin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nPlans for the high-rise have been gestating for years, but\nthe Department of City Planning\ngave the trio of firms the green light in September, according to\nNew York YIMBY\n. The three buildings on the site, one a 30-story office tower, will need to be demolished for the new high-rise. Plans for the project include a 12,500-square-foot outdoor public plaza and 16,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space, according to YIMBY.\nMichael Ritchie of AAI Architects filed the permit application. Architectural firm Foster + Partners is reportedly also working on the structure. The two firms partnered previously on 425 Park Avenue, a 650,000 square foot building completed in 2022, according to AAI\u2019s website.\nFoster + Partners is the architect behind another Park Avenue office tower turning heads,\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s recently opened headquarters\nat 270 Park.\nAlthough the New York office market overall is still cooler than it was pre-pandemic, Class A office space, specifically on Park Avenue and near Grand Central Terminal, has been\nin high demand\n.\nThe 350 Park development was made possible by the 2017\nrezoning of Midtown East\n. The change allowed landmarked buildings to sell their development rights to nonadjacent sites when they are under the total buildable area allowed by the city.\nIn 2023, Citadel signed an agreement to\nbuy air rights\nfrom St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, paying the Archdiocese of New York for $312.50 per square foot. The developers are also required to pay $62.50 per square foot purchased to a Midtown East improvement fund.\nRenderings of the proposed development show a stepped, staircase-like profile and floor-to-ceiling windows.\n",

        "content": "Home affordability in the Los Angeles area has gotten a bit better for potential buyers.\nIn Greater L.A., 16 percent of households could afford to buy a home at the median price of $837,060 in the third quarter of this year, up from 14 percent in the second quarter and small tick up from 15 percent in the third quarter of last year, Westside Current\nreported\n, citing new data from the California Association of Realtors.\nAt the same time, the median\nprice of existing single-family homes\nin California dropped 2 percent in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Year-over-year, however,\nhome prices\nhave bounced back, increasing 0.8 percent after the first decline in eight quarters earlier this year. Easing mortgage rates have likely attracted more buyers to\nthe SoCal residential market\n. Housing affordability could notch up even further if lower mortgage rates emerge in the coming months of the off-season and if economic uncertainties clear up.\nIn Los Angeles County in particular, 12 percent of households could afford to purchase the $954,130 median-priced home in the third quarter \u2014 a slight tick down from 13 percent in the second quarter, though it\u2019s a slight improvement from 11 percent in the third quarter of last year. In\nOrange County\n, 13 percent percent of households could afford to purchase the $1.4 million median-priced home in the third quarter of 2025, up from 12 percent in the second quarter 2025 and up from 12 percent in Q3 2024.\nAffordability widens for condos and townhomes. Overall, in California, 27 percent of households statewide could afford a typical condo or townhome in the third quarter, up from 25 percent in the second quarter and the same number in the third quarter of last year. To make monthly payments on a $649,990 median-priced condo or townhome in the third quarter, residents would have to have an annual income of $163,600.\nHousing affordability is still notably lower in the Golden State than nationwide. More than one third of households across the country could purchase a $426,800 median-priced home, which required a minimum annual income of $107,600 to make monthly payments. Affordability nationwide increased slightly from 35 percent in both the second quarter of 2025 and a year ago.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A 159-acre stretch of vacant land in north San Jose could soon host more than 1 million square feet of data center space, and Prologis is the developer of choice.\nPrologis is the frontrunner among developers that submitted proposals for the site owned by the San Jose-Santa Clara Regional Wastewater Facility, the Silicon Valley Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe logistics giant\u2019s plan, dubbed the Sustainable Technology, Engineering and Manufacturing (STEM) Park, would deliver about 1.7 million square feet of\ndata center\nspace across four buildings, along with another 785,000 square feet for high-tech manufacturing. The project would include five electric substations to power the energy-hungry operations\n.\nThe bid from Prologis came out on top over plans from\nTrammell Crow Company\nand Catellus-Deca, a joint venture between\nCatellus Development Corporation\nand Deca Companies.\nCatellus-Deca pitched 3 million square feet of flex space that could become data centers, research and development space or a business park; the plans also included 562,000 square feet of retail. Trammell Crow proposed 3.2 million square feet of warehouse space, 54,000 square feet of office and 60,000 square feet of retail.\nOfficials favored Prologis for its commitment to finance all construction and its higher projected economic return for San Jose, according to a\nCity of San Jose\nmemo cited by the outlet. Catellus-Deca was tapped to stay on deck as a backup developer should an alternative be needed.\nThe city bought the land as a buffer for the wastewater treatment plant, and it is restricted against odor-sensitive uses such as housing or hotels. San Jose began seeking proposals in May with a goal of spurring job growth in tech-focused industries and generating recurring ground-lease and tax revenue.\nPrologis\u2019 proposal still has to go through the approval process. The proposal is set to be heard at the City of San Jose\u2019s Treatment Plant Advisory Committee\u2019s meeting this week, and the San Jose City Council meeting on Nov. 18. If Prologis\u2019 project is greenlit at the upcoming meetings, it must still complete\nCEQA review\nand ground lease negotiations, among other steps.\nThe firm aims to begin construction in 2028 with initial occupancy in 2030.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

They intend to purchase more air rights in the coming weeks, per the filing.\nThe pair plan to develop a massive residential project with about 200 condos, 299 rental units and 20,000 square feet of commercial space at a cost of about $400 million, per the TASE filing. Valley National Bank provided a $31.5 million loan for the purchase, which was first reported by\nPincusCo\n.\nThe development is down the street from another massive mixed-use project Dushinsky and Gluck are building at\n625 Fulton Street\n. That 35-story, two-tower project\nhas 1,098 units and retail space.\nThe Brooklyn site has changed hands multiple times in recent years. In 2015, the Feil Organization acquired the three-story building at the site from Capital One\nfor $43 million\n, then pieced together a seven-parcel development site. In 2021, Feil submitted plans for a 363-unit residential building. The plans called for 421 apartments, 30 percent of them affordable under the 421a program.\nAfter permits were approved, Extell signed a long-term $85.9 million ground lease with Feil in 2022, signifying that Barnett\u2019s firm would take over the project. Demolition was nearly complete at the end of that year, according to\nNew York YIMBY\n.\nIt\u2019s unclear why Barnett decided to exit the project. Representatives for Extell, Rabsky and Gluck did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Feil declined to comment.\n",

The contracts had a total last asking volume of $80 million, beating\nthe previous period\u2019s total of 19 contracts\nsigned for $66 million.\nThe priciest contract signed last week was for a townhouse on 152 DeKalb Avenue in Fort Greene asking $4.7 million.\nThe 20-foot-wide home spans 3,200 square feet and comes with six bedrooms and three full bathrooms. The home is currently set up as an owner\u2019s triplex and a one-bedroom garden rental.\nBuilt in the 1880s for publishing mogul James Gordon Bennett, the home was renovated in the early 2000s. It still retains its original plaster moldings, window shutters, marble mantels, parquet floors and stairway wainscoting, and has two functional wood-burning fireplaces.\nThe home has a deck overlooking its 55-foot-long back garden.\nCompass\u2019 Kathleen Perkins had the listing.\nThe second most expensive deal signed was for a townhouse at 274 Clinton Avenue in Clinton Hill asking $4.5 million.\nThe Italianate brownstone spans 4,500 square feet and is configured as a garden-level duplex and an upper-level triplex. It comes with three wood-burning fireplaces and a back deck and garden.\nThe garden duplex features two bedrooms, a full bathroom and a chef\u2019s kitchen with a formal dining room.

        "content": "Borough presidents once again have more sway over the city\u2019s land use process.\nThe borough president races went pretty much as expected last week: The incumbents won in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal won his bid for Manhattan Borough President, replacing Mark Levine, who will be the city\u2019s next comptroller.\nBut Election Day also granted these five officials more authority over certain housing projects in their boroughs.\nOne of the ballot questions approved by voters creates a three-person appeals board that, as part of the land use review process, can reverse City Council rejections of housing projects that would result in affordable housing in one borough. The board\u2019s members include the mayor, City Council speaker and respective borough president.\nKen Fisher, a land-use attorney with Cozen O\u2019Connor, told me last week that he views the borough president as the appeals board\u2019s\nswing vote\n. If a rezoning was approved by the City Planning Commission, presumably it has the mayor\u2019s support. The City Council speaker will likely be reluctant to go against the Council, leaving the borough president to decide the project\u2019s fate (two out of three of the board\u2019s members must vote to reverse a decision).\nBorough presidents have an advisory role in the city\u2019s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure. It wasn\u2019t always this way. Borough presidents sat on the Board of Estimate, which originally had the final vote at the end of Ulurp. That changed in 1989, when the Board of Estimate was deemed unconstitutional and the City Council was, effectively, given final word over land use actions.\nOf course, the extent to which borough presidents are elevated depends on how often the appeals board is called to action. Local Council members and developers may want to avoid a project getting to that point.\nStill, even just early support from a borough president could help steer negotiations or embolden a developer to move forward with a project they may have otherwise abandoned, fearing that the local Council member would kill it. Of course, the same could be said if a borough president makes clear upfront that they will not support a project or will not support it unless certain conditions are met.\nJust like the local City Council member, the borough president could draw a line in the sand over affordability levels in a project. In fact, Hoylman-Signal\ncriticized\nthe Soho/Noho rezoning in 2021 for not guaranteeing more affordable housing and, more recently, pushed for 100 percent affordable housing on city- and state-owned sites.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nDo you have a project that could benefit from any of the housing ballot measures? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nMembers of the\nCarpenters\u2019 Company\n, a trade guild founded in 1724, built Independence Hall and Christ Church in Philadelphia. Despite its name, the group\u2019s members were not carpenters but architects, engineers and contractors.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nMayor-elect Zohran Mamdani on Monday tapped Dean Fuleihan, who served as first deputy mayor and budget director under Mayor Bill de Blasio, as his first deputy mayor. He also announced that Elle Bisgaard-Church, his campaign manager, will serve as his chief of staff.\n\u2014\nCity officials on Monday announced new ferry routes will open between the Bronx and Rockaways, as well as Brooklyn and Staten Island\n,\nGothamist reports\n. The routes will take effect Dec. 8.\n\u2014\nIn the coming weeks, Council member Chi Oss\u00e9 is expected to announce his plan to challenge Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader of the House, in June,\nthe New York Times reports\n. The mayor-elect has reportedly discouraged Oss\u00e9 from running.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$14.2 million\nfor a condominium unit at 250 West Street.

A trust scooped up a condo at\n250 West Street\nfor $14.2 million. The seller was\nWest Hub, LLC\n. The company paid $11.9 million for the pad in 2016. The four-bedroom unit spans 4,100 square feet, pricing the latest transaction at roughly $3,500 per square foot.\nRichard Ziegelasch\nwith Corcoran represented the seller.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nRego Park had the priciest real estate transaction recorded in New York. The sellers were entities linked to the\nLeFrak Organization\n, and the buyer was the\nState Preservation Housing Development Fund Corp.,\nwhich purchased two multifamily properties at\n65-44 Saunders Street\n, known as The Tennessee, and\n63-60 98th Street\n, known as The Washington, for a total of $33.3 million. LeFrak had owned the properties for decades.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nIn Lenox Hill, a unit at\n610 Park Avenue\nchanged hands for $11.2 million. The buyer was\nJGDB Holding Limited\n, which is linked to\nGilinski Holding\n. Jaime Gilinski is a Colombian billionaire. The seller was an LLC tied to\nJose Carlos Suero\n, who purchased the pad in 1998.

        "content": "LWK Partners and\nCypress Equity Investments\nplan to increase the density of multifamily properties they own in Los Angeles after securing a $100 million credit facility.\nHong Kong\n-based LWK and Los Angeles-based Cypress locked down the credit facility from local firm Ascent Developer Solutions, the Los Angeles Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe developers debuted their partnership in January, and the financing will speed its plans to build more units at existing properties.\nThe deal comes a little over a year after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed SB 1211, which increased the number of detached\naccessory dwelling units\nthat are allowed to be built on multifamily lots. Part of the facility includes the $30 million recapitalization of seven LWK properties for the addition of 50 ADUs.\nIn their efforts as co-general partners, Cypress is charged with heading development while LWK focuses on acquisitions, said LWK co-founder and partner Austin Nissly.\nIt isn\u2019t the first time Cypress has worked with Ascent. The deal for a so-called \u201crinse-and-repeat facility\u201d allows LWK and Cypress to shift back and forth between acquisition and construction loans as they take up more projects.\nThe goal is to increase LWK\u2019s portfolio from 200 multifamily units to 5,000 over the next five years, with transactions between $3 million and $10 million being ideal targets. To do this, LWK and Cypress will juggle acquisitions and holdings under LWK ownership that can be revamped for workforce housing.\nAs it stands, LWK\u2019s properties are concentrated in West Adams and Mid-City, but the firm has expressed interest in\nSanta Monica\n, Hollywood, Leimert Park and the San Fernando Valley.\nLWK and Cypress recently bought a 20-unit property in Hollywood for $4 million; the companies plan to add eight ADUs with a cost per unit for one-bedrooms of less than $150,000.\nAnother project from the joint venture involves three eight-unit buildings on three parcels with plans to add four ADUs to each parcel, upping density by 50 percent.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Two waterfront Lake Geneva houses sold last week, showcasing big gains in property value through flips on both while adding to the\nstring of big deals\nin the Wisconsin resort town.\nThe two deals, which both closed on Friday, are the\nlatest of several high-end houses\nto sell this fall in Lake Geneva, a\npopular second home location\nfor Chicagoland residents.\nOne house, at W3240 Park Drive, sold for nearly $6 million. The 3,300-square-foot house has private lake frontage and a private pier with a boat slip.\nIt\u2019s the third time in as many years that listing agent\nWendy Murphy\n, with Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, has sold the house. It sold in November 2024 for $5.25 million, and in August 2023 for $4.2 million, growing its value by about 43 percent in two years. The sales give an insight into property value appreciation on Lake Geneva, Murphy said.\n\u201cThere seems to be no lack of interest in that higher end market here in Lake Geneva,\u201d she said.\nAt less than 3,300-square-feet, the Park Drive house is the smallest of the lakefront homes to sell this fall. Still, its condition and architectural style made it an attractive property, Murphy said. The home was designed by Engerman Contracting, a custom home builder in Lake Geneva.\n\u201cIt is the perfect size for a family to be able to gather,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just has that architecture that just screams the Cape Cod feel.\u201d\nThe sellers of the Park Drive house are Philip and Melody Lekousis, according to property records. The house had an interested buyer before the listing went public, Murphy said, and the house ultimately sold to that party. Murphy declined to share additional details about the buyers or sellers, and the buyers are not yet identified in public records. The buyer\u2019s agent was listed as \u201cnon member\u201d on listing websites.\nThe sellers paid $35,000 in property taxes in 2024, according to county records.\nOn the northeast end of the lake, the house at 8 Hillside Drive sold for $7.4 million on Friday. That house, too, sold in October of last year for $5.9 million, increasing in value by 25 percent in a year.\nThe 4,300-square-foot house has five bedrooms and five bathrooms. It has lakefront access and a boat pier, and sits on a 0.58-acre lot.\nDavid Curry of Geneva Lakefront Realty represented both the buyers and the sellers on the deal. He didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nThe house was purchased under an LLC that obscures the new owner\u2019s identity. The previous owners were Vincent and Patricia Kolber, public records show. The tax bill for the property in 2024 was about $53,000, property records show.\nThis fall has seen a run of luxury home buying on Lake Geneva. Seven homes have sold on the lakefront for more than $5 million in the last three months, according to listing services. In the eight months preceding that, just five homes sold on the lakefront at that price.\nThat\u2019s in part because sales activity has shifted to later months over the last few years, Murphy said. Until recently, listing and buying activity would pick up in the early spring and summer. Now, Murphy said houses aren\u2019t going on the market until late summer.\n\u201cA lot of that is sellers are seeing that they\u2019re commanding high prices, and they want to get one more year out of it, and be able to use the house for the summer months,\u201d Murphy said.\nThat buzz may taper off in the winter, Murphy said. Only two waterfront Lake Geneva houses are currently publicly listed. One is a 7,800-square-foot new construction on South Lake Shore Drive that listed for $10 million in late September. The other, a log cabin-style home, has had less luck than most properties on the lake. It was listed Aug. 22 for $6.75 million but has had its price chopped twice since then, and it\u2019s now asking $5.6 million.\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s long-running fight to reclaim blighted land from one of its most notorious property owners has yielded disappointing results.\nAfter decades of snapping up tax-delinquent land across the South and West sides, Suzie B. Wilson and her sister, Swedlana Dass, agreed earlier this year to auction off their sprawling portfolio to settle more than $11 million in debts, the Illinois Answers Project\nreported\n.\nWilson, a Northbrook resident who oversees a number of property management companies in Chicago, has been fined more than\n$15 million for rat-related\nreasons since 2010, according to city and state records. The fines are tied to nearly 30 companies, all owned by Wilson.\nThe city\u2019s bet that the bulk sale would spark reinvestment and fill its coffers, however, fell short.\nRoughly\n800 properties\nonce controlled by the sisters went to auction this spring. Only about a third found buyers, generating just $3.4 million, far below the $12 million Wilson once claimed the \u201ctop 150 to 200\u201d parcels could bring. More than 500 weed-strewn lots remain unsold, many in Englewood, West Pullman and Greater Grand Crossing, where years of disinvestment have sapped private interest.\n\u201cWhatever remuneration happens in the end, we have a single goal,\u201d Mary Richardson-Lowry, the city\u2019s\ncorporation counsel\n, told the outlet. \u201cShe should no longer be in the city, owning property in a way that harms communities.\u201d\nWilson and Dass\u2019s\nreal estate empire\n\u2014 assembled through more than 20 shell LLCs with names like Dagny, Dorchester and Discount Inn \u2014 grew over three decades from scavenger sales meant to return tax-delinquent land to productive use. Instead, the properties became magnets for trash, weeds and rats. A 2023 Illinois Answers investigation found more than $15 million in unpaid fines tied to their holdings.\nThe auction, approved through bankruptcy court after the city sued the sisters, was touted by Hilco Real Estate as a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity.\nInstead, it exposed how little appetite there is for vacant land in Chicago\u2019s poorest neighborhoods. Most lots sold for about $5,000 each, with investors gravitating toward West Side areas like Garfield Park and Austin, while dozens of parcels in struggling South Side districts drew no bids.\nBuyers ranged from neighbors seeking to formalize side yards to speculators betting on long-term upside. The city and CTA bought a handful of sites for affordable housing and transit-oriented projects, including parcels slated to offset parkland lost to the Red Line extension.\nEven with the disappointing returns, city officials consider the sale a partial victory. Wilson and Dass have been forced to shed hundreds of lots and are now in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, facing full liquidation. A New York lender that financed the bankruptcy with a $4 million loan will be paid before the city sees any proceeds.\nIf the sisters somehow retain ownership of their unsold holdings, Richardson-Lowry said the city will pursue them again.\n\u201cIf anyone thinks this is over, they\u2019re not paying attention,\u201d she said.\nThe case serves as a sizable example of a larger dilemma for the city. That is, thousands of vacant lots, most in private hands, languishing in neighborhoods still waiting for reinvestment.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

It would triple the amount of housing built in the area over the past two decades.\nThe proposal, submitted on Monday to the city\u2019s Planning Department, calls for a mix of mid- and high-rise towers as tall as 30 stories on the 4-acre site north of\nAlamo Square Park\n. About 15 percent of the units would be set aside for\naffordable housing\n, creating a \u201cdiverse mix of unit types, income levels and uses\u201d for \u201can inclusive, mixed-income community\u201d that would help meet state housing goals, the company said in a statement.\nThe plan also includes a 500-stall garage under one tower and a smaller, 20,000-square-foot grocery store to replace the Safeway, which closed last year after four decades due to what the company said were theft and safety issues.\nAlign Real Estate moved to\nbuy the defunct Safeway location\nin 2022. The firm remains in contract to buy the property from the Pleasanton-based grocery chain; the sale is slated to close when construction starts on the sites. In the meantime, Align is talking with potential supermarket tenants after members of the community called for another grocery tenant to move into the 40,000-square-foot building at the site.\nEarlier this year, Smart &amp; Final submitted a bid to move into the abandoned Safeway building as part of a short-term lease that could be extended. It isn\u2019t clear if discussions between Smart &amp; Final and Align are still active.\nAlign is currently working to lock down the necessary financing to break ground once entitlements are secured. Align is also planning to file additional development applications in the coming weeks that call for the construction of more than 3,500 new homes across the city, of which about 500 will be affordable units.\nAs part of its\nhousing element\n, the city of San Francisco must permit 82,069 new housing units by 2031.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The nation\u2019s biggest homebuilder has adopted an AI-based platform for land acquisition.\nD.R. Horton\ncontracted with Prophetic, which collates zoning restrictions, parcel ownership data, topography, environmental regulations and market activity on one platform designed to generate site plans and yield estimates for subdivision homebuilders more quickly.\nThe startup was founded in Portland, Oregon, last year.\nThe software has been compared to\nCityBldr\n, a platform that uses machine learning to find underutilized or high-potential development sites for commercial real estate. The company has other homebuilder clients, including\nCentury Communities\n, but Texas-based D.R. Horton is its biggest yet.\nProphetic has parcel data from over 20 states so far, and it will expand to more than 30 states in time for D.R. Horton to implement it, said Prophetic CEO Oliver Alexander, who is the founder of remote job board Remotely and of the rural clinic chain Orchid Health.\nThe company aims to have parcel data from all 50 states by June.\n\u201cWe have national availability of recorder and assessor data, as well as MLS data, as well as a ton of environmental diligence layers, as we call them,\u201d Alexander said.\nThat environmental information includes flood zones, wetlands, power lines that may bisect the site, school zones, soil data and toxicity issues.\nProphetic also tracks legal documents for each parcel, such as easements.\n\u201cA couple hundred parcels a month is normal for a productive person on a land team. We have users doing 5,700 parcels a month,\u201d Alexander said.\nD.R. Horton closed 84,863 homes during the fiscal year ending Sept 30, a\n5 percent decrease\nyear over year.\nThe company also ended the year with a smaller inventory than the year before, including 19,600 unsold homes, compared to 25,700 homes unsold at the end of September 2024.\nIn a market of cautious buyers, D.R. Horton has been leaning on\nsales incentives\nto close deals, offering rate buydowns, closing-cost assistance and free upgrades.\n",

        "content": "Harwood International\u2019s\nfinancial unraveling\nhas claimed another piece of its Dallas empire \u2014 and this time, it\u2019s the one that started it all.\nFirst United Bank, based in Oklahoma, received ownership of\nHarwood No. 1\n, the Dallas developer\u2019s first office development, after a foreclosure auction last week, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nThe seven-story, 106,000-square-foot building at 2651 North Harwood Street sold for $27.2 million, or $257 per square foot.\nThe property, built in 1984 for watchmaker Rolex, marked the genesis of what would become the 19-block Harwood District in\nUptown\n.\nFirst United provided Harwood with a $37.45 million loan ($353 per square foot) in 2020 and moved to foreclose after the developer defaulted, according to county records.\nHarwood No. 1 is only 54 percent leased, sources previously told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe deal makes Harwood No. 1 the second property the developer has lost to foreclosure this year and the third sent to foreclosure. In April, San Francisco-based Spear Street Capital acquired Harwood No. 4 after a similar default, with plans for multimillion-dollar renovations.\nHarwood saved\nSaint Ann Court\nfrom foreclosure with a\nrecap deal\nearlier this year.\nAnother\nHarwood\nparcel, at 2840 Bookhout Street, also tied to a First United loan, narrowly avoided the same fate this week. An affiliate, HIC Development XV, filed a temporary restraining order Monday to block its scheduled foreclosure, and both sides reached an agreement to postpone the sale.\nHarwood, led by Swiss-born developer Gabriel Barbier-Mueller, is under pressure from mounting debt and sluggish office demand.\nSince late summer, the firm has sold off four of its signature towers \u2014 Harwood Nos. 2, 6, 7 and 10 \u2014 to\nTPG\n, the Fort Worth- and San Francisco-based private equity firm, in transactions totaling roughly 900,000 square feet. TPG also extended a $100 million loan tied to Harwood\u2019s broader holdings, including the delayed 23-story Harwood No. 15 project.\nHarwood\ntapped Newmark to line up new equity and debt partners as it tries to stabilize its 19-block district, which spans more than 3 million square feet of office, residential and retail space. The long-term vision calls for more than 8 million square feet of mixed-use development.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Tory Burch is taking her fight from the runway to the courtroom, this time over the fate of her home.\nThe designer and several fellow residents\nat the Pierre Hotel\nhave filed suit in Manhattan Supreme Court to stop what they call a secretive and coercive $2 billion sale of the storied Fifth Avenue property that could evict them, Curbed\nreported\n.\nThe complaint accuses the co-op board of striking a term sheet in September with an unidentified LLC allegedly tied to the Khashoggi family, which would fold the building into the Brunei-owned Dorchester Collection.\nUnder that plan, residents would have to vacate their apartments or lose their share of proceeds, the suit claims. The residents say the board refused to disclose the buyer\u2019s identity, financing capacity or exclusivity terms, and that it rejected a rival offer from longtime operator Taj Hotels that would have allowed residents to stay.\nThe Pierre\u2019s shareholders want the board to open its books, alleging it violated fiduciary duties by pushing a deal they say it barely understood. The board has maintained that the term sheet is \u201cnonbinding and subject to shareholder approval,\u201d according to the filing.\nThe battle comes as the Pierre \u2014 whose gilded pedigree dates back nearly a century \u2014 struggles to regain its luster. Maintenance and service deteriorated, resulting in fraying carpets and spotty staffing.\nHoward Lutnick, the then-Cantor Fitzgerald CEO who owns the co-op\u2019s penthouse, allegedly helped steer the board toward hiring Newmark Group, the brokerage he ran, to advise on improving the property before pivoting to a sale.\nLutnick, who never lived in the penthouse he\nbought for $44 million\nin 2017, distanced himself from the controversy. A spokesperson for his government department previously said he hadn\u2019t been involved in discussions and disclosed his conflicts before stepping away from his businesses when Trump tapped him for his Commerce Secretary post.\nAs for Burch and her neighbors, however, the betrayal is raw. The suit alleges the board aims to \u201cram a sale through by presenting it as a fait accompli to shareholders.\u201d\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The plan aims to create a destination that links to the nearby Willow Springs Golf Course and anchors long-promised reinvestment in the historically underdeveloped East Side.\nBexar County voters\nrecently approved\nfunnelling $311 million in county hotel occupancy and rental car taxes toward the project.Voters also approved using\n$500 million\nin visitor tax revenue for a new Spurs arena and renovations to the Frost Bank Center, the current home of the Spurs.\nThe developers are also proposing a tax increment reinvestment zone and a municipal management district to help finance infrastructure and operations, both of which require county approval. Parking revenues and ground leases could generate additional funds for Bexar County.\nFreeman Coliseum Executive Director Derrick Howard called the board\u2019s approval \u201can opportunity to finally look at this from a holistic perspective.\u201d The plan, he said, reflects a shift toward community-centered development long championed by county leaders.\nThe developers are now entering a\nmonths-long\ncommunity engagement and master planning phase.

He\u2019s also held executive technology positions with Guardhill Financial,\nTown Residential and Citi Habitats\n.\nReyes is stepping into the role at a time when most of the industry is focused on\nintegrating artificial intelligence\n. Last month, Elliman announced its own AI assistant app, called Elli AI, which it plans to debut in Florida before expanding its use to other markets.\n\u201cEveryone is talking about AI,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cPersonally, my philosophy is simple. If tools don\u2019t save time or drive revenue, they don\u2019t belong in the stack.\u201d\nA spokesperson for BHS said the firm \u201c[wishes] Chris the best in his next endeavor.\u201d\nReyes will replace Elliman\u2019s former CTO, David Ballard, who was terminated from his post last November on the heels of a\nleadership shakeup\nat the firm.\nCEO Michael Liebowitz \u2014 who took over the firm\u2019s top role last year after longtime leader\nHoward Lorber abruptly retired\n\u2014 said he took his time finding the right person to replace Ballard, including putting him through a \u201crigorous hiring process\u201d adopted by the company under Liebowitz\u2019s tenure.\n\u201cWhile everyone wants to come out with a wham-bam magic Sam technology solution for the industry, we really wanted to find someone who knew the industry,\u201d said Liebowitz. He added that the firm found that in Reyes, and the company will offer Reyes a larger platform than his previous roles.\nLiebowitz said that the firm is betting on AI to help streamline the company\u2019s operations, including lowering expenses and employee counts. He added that the efforts were part of his plan for 2026, the theme for which he described as \u201cbeing about every single person being a revenue generator.\u201d\n\u201c2025 was a transition year,\u201d Liebowitz said. \u201c2026 is our growth year.\u201d\nNews of Elliman\u2019s new executive comes a week after the firm reported its\nthird-quarter earnings\n, including a $25 million net loss. The loss was less than the $27 million it lost in the same quarter last year. The firm also saw revenues decline modestly year-over-year, down from $266 million to $263 million.\nHowever, Elliman did eliminate its debt last month after it sold its property management arm to Associa for\n$85 million\n. The deal allowed the company to pay off a $50 million loan it received from Kennedy Lewis last year.\n",

        "content": "Gatsby Florida is anticipating an influx of New York office tenants for its planned mixed-use project in Palm Beach Gardens in the wake of Zohran Mamdani\u2019s mayoral victory.\nMiami-based Gatsby, led by co-founder\nBabak Ebrahimzadeh\n, finalized construction plans for The Modern at Palm Beach Gardens, a 220,000-square-foot building and an adjacent six-level parking garage with 838 spaces, a press release states. The developer plans to break ground next year and expects to complete the project in 2027.\nIn 2022, a Gatsby affiliate bought a 7-acre development site at 11200 RCA Center Drive for\n$17.5 million\nfrom Palm Beach Gardens-based developer Daniel Catalfumo, records show. Gatsby\u2019s project is based on a previous site plan for Catalfumo\u2019s PGA Tower project, which was approved by the city of Palm Beach Gardens in 2021.\nRoughly 25 percent of The Modern at Palm Beach Gardens\u2019 199,000 square feet of office space is pre-leased, the release states. The building will also have 21,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space. Darryl Kaplan with Darryl R. Kaplan Company is handling leasing for the new project.\nIn a statement, Ebrahimzadeh said leasing momentum should accelerate based on the results of the\nNew York mayoral election\n. Many South Florida developers and brokers are betting that\nMamdani\n, a Democratic Socialist who made campaign promises for free buses and rent freezes for rent-stabilized buildings, will drive a new wave of New Yorkers to the Sunshine State\u2019s tri-county region.\n\u201cThe consistent corporate exodus from New York City and surrounding areas has been amplified by the recent election, increasing the urgency for firms seeking a more favorable and stable business climate,\u201d Ebrahimzadeh said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that New Yorkers prefer the established, exclusive environment of Palm Beach Gardens.\u201d\nRising eight stories, The Modern at Palm Beach Gardens will feature 25,000-square-foot floorplates, the release says. Retail and restaurant components will include a 10,000-square-foot fine dining venue, a 4,000-square-foot casual food and beverage space, and 7,000 square feet of quick service and retail offerings in the garage\u2019s first floor.\nTenant amenities will include a rooftop patio with covered seating, a wet bar, a fitness center with full-service locker rooms, and a media and conference facility.\nPalm Beach Gardens has become a magnet for financial and professional firms relocating from higher-tax markets, Ebrahimzadeh said. Gatsby\u2019s nearby\nDiVosta Towers\nis fully leased with notable tenants such as JPMorgan and Stifel Investment Banking.\nGatsby expects The Modern at Palm Beach Gardens to attract similar demand from financial institutions, private equity firms, law firms and Fortune 500 companies drawn to the area\u2019s quality of life and business climate, Ebrahimzadeh said.\nGatsby\u2019s South Florida office portfolio includes\n800 Brickell\nin Miami, One Town Center in Boca Raton, and 550 Okeechobee in West Palm Beach.",

        "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s first home in Queens is for sale \u2014 again.\nThe Tudor-style house at 85-15 Wareham Place \u2014 where the former president spent his earliest years \u2014 hit the market for $2.3 million after an extensive renovation, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. Its owner, developer Tommy Lin, bought the property earlier this year for $835,000 after it sat abandoned and in disrepair for years.\nThe five-bedroom home in Jamaica Estates was built in 1940 by Trump\u2019s father, Fred, and briefly housed the future developer before the family moved to a larger residence nearby.\nLin spent eight months gut-renovating the roughly 2,500-square-foot house, stripping it to its studs and investing about $500,000 to modernize the interior while keeping its brick-and-stucco fa\u00e7ade intact.\nThe asking price breaks down to $920 per square foot. Brown Harris Stevens\u2019 Jevon Gratineau has the\nlisting\n.\nThis marks another chapter in the property\u2019s colorful resale history.\nIn 2008, before politics were firmly in Trump\u2019s sights, the home traded hands for $782,000.\nIn 2016, investor Michael Davis purchased the home for $1.39 million just hours before Trump\u2019s election night victory, betting that a win would boost its value. He was right: within months, Davis flipped it to a buyer in China for $2.14 million.\nDavis went on to lease the property, at which time he rented out the house on Airbnb for around $800 a night, filling it with Trump memorabilia and even a sign claiming the bedroom might have been where Trump was conceived. He ultimately stopped listing the house in 2017 after the Oxfam charity booked the place and brought refugees to the home to highlight the refugee crisis.\nIn Jamaica Estates, the median home price in September hovered around $1.5 million, according to Realtor.com. A nearby home recently sold for $4 million and several in the neighborhood are listed for more than $3 million.\nWhether the Trump name still adds value remains to be seen.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The\nlitigation\nover the fate of a prized Midtown office building is getting uglier by the day.\nAfter Aby Rosen\u2019s RFR Realty filed a lawsuit this summer regarding the foreclosure auction of 285 Madison Avenue, buyer Ocean West Capital Partners responded last week, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\n\u201cThis litigation is a shakedown,\u201d the firm said in a motion filed to the New York state Supreme Court. Rosen declined to comment to the publication following the motion.\nOcean West is referring to a lawsuit RFR filed in July against Korea-based lender KTB CRE Debt Fund No. 11, aka Daol Asset Management. RFR claimed the April auction of the 27-story property was a \u201ccharade\u201d and \u201crigged.\u201d\nThe lawsuit claimed the lender sabotaged Rosen\u2019s efforts to retain or refinance the building by mismanaging the auction, cutting off lucrative management fees and imposing what RFR called a \u201cparticularly unreasonable\u201d $500,000 deposit requirement to participate.\nThe Class A Madison Avenue building, developed in 1926, was 86 percent leased in 2017 with tenants like General Electric and PVH. That year, Rosen refinanced a $270 million mortgage and extracted $127 million in cash while taking on $120 million in mezzanine debt.\nWhen the CMBS loan matured in 2022, RFR was granted an 18-month extension. But the firm was unable to pay after the second deadline hit. After a foreclosure filing earlier this year, KTB scheduled an auction for April. Rosen made a last-ditch appeal in court that morning, saying he needed more time to find an investor.\nThe judge didn\u2019t go for it, though. Only KTB and RFR showed up to bid. KTB\ntook\npossession of the property for $132 million. The lender then turned around and sold the building to Ocean West.\nRosen\u2019s lawsuit accused KTB of failing to market the property properly and interfering with RFR\u2019s business by terminating its management contract, costing the firm $4 million in annual fees. KTB disputed the claims, noting the sale was advertised widely and that RFR complained about a lack of transparency before even requesting sale materials.\nRosen is seeking unspecified damages. The building, a few blocks from Grand Central and 96 percent leased as of last February, was reappraised at $300 million last summer. Ocean West is planning investments, including a rooftop deck and a gym.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The development would have a parking garage with 353 spaces, and outdoor amenities that include a swimming pool, a courtyard and pedestrian plazas.\nJericho, New York-based Kimco, led by CEO Conor C. Flynn, launched its redevelopment of Oakwood Plaza by demolishing a movie theater on the south side of the shopping center to make way for a\nDick\u2019s Sporting Goods\nstore.\nKimco demolished the movie theater and nearby parking lots at 3800 Oakwood Boulevard earlier this year after the company\u2019s lease agreement with Regal Cinemas expired and the Hollywood City Commission approved a site plan for the Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods store, which will span 120,000 square feet.\nKimco, a real estate investment trust, plans to redevelop Oakwood Plaza over a 30-year period as other commercial leases expire. The shopping center\u2019s three largest tenants are Home Depot, City Furniture and BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club, which collectively occupy a total of 377,295 square feet, according to Kimco\u2019s website. Oakwood Plaza has about 33,000 square feet of retail space available to lease, according to Kimco\u2019s websiteOakwood Plaza is across Stirling Road from Kimco\u2019s\nDania Pointe\n, a 102-acre, mixed-use property with more than 740,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space in addition to apartments, hotels and offices.",

Its asking price amounts to $840 per square foot. A\nBarton Creek Country Club\nsocial membership comes with the property.\nCompass Real Estate agent Charlotte Lipscomb had the listing.\nA three-day listing would be fast anywhere, but it\u2019s especially swift for Austin. Luxury sales averaged 83 days on the Austin MLS last week, according to the Eklund Gomes Team. Austin luxury homes spent a median of 90 days on the market in September, according to\nRedfin\n. That makes Austin the fifth-slowest metro for luxury in the country.\nThe top sale in Austin last week spent much more time in the market. Another Barton Creek home, a\nHeyl Homes\nconstruction at 4717 Peralta Lane, listed for $5.95 million in April, left the market in June and relisted in September, according to Zillow. It was asking $5.5 million when a deal was struck on Nov. 5.\nThe quick turnaround of 9600 Veletta Place may suggest that\nAustin sellers are adjusting to the buyer\u2019s market shift\n, with overpriced properties gradually giving way to more sober asks on the MLS.\nThe top two deals last week\nwere similarly bifurcated: Both homes were in the same neighborhood, but the first sold in 16 days with an unchanged asking price, while the second had a price cut and over 130 days on market.\n",

The property is being marketed by Eastdil Secured.\nThe hotel opened in 1929 and was given landmark status in 2016. It boasts a storied past, hosting Hollywood icons Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio during the couple\u2019s brief marriage in the 1950s.\nOnce part of a bustling \u201chotel row\u201d stretching along Lexington Avenue from about 52nd to 45th Street, the corridor has seen its hotel inventory shrink dramatically over the past decade. The former Midtown DoubleTree and Marriott East Side have been repurposed as student housing, and the Midtown East\nMaxwell\nhotel closed in 2020.\nElsewhere in Midtown, the iconic Waldorf Astoria has downsized from 1,400 to 375 rooms and the Roosevelt Hotel will likely be sold and redeveloped as an office tower.\nThe Lexington stands as the last major \u201cbig-box\u201d hotel in the neighborhood, giving potential owners the opportunity to seize on visitors to the surrounding office towers, like JP Morgan Chase\u2019s\nnewly-opened headquarters\none block to the west.\nThe property last changed hands in 2021, when the joint venture\nacquired it for $185 million\n. The hotel had been closed since the pandemic and renovated by its previous owner, DiamondRock Hospitality. It reopened under the Marriott International Autograph Collection brand shortly after.\nThe hotel is hitting the market as New York\u2019s occupancy rates approach pre-pandemic levels and the city\u2019s luxury hotel market surges on the back of rebounding tourism and business travel.\nThe average occupancy rate surpassed 84 percent a week in 2024, up from a pandemic low of about 50 percent, according to a report by Lodging Analytics Research &amp; Consulting. But expenses tied to labor costs, high interest rates and property taxes continue to affect the bottom line.\nEastdil Secured declined to comment.\n",

But a representative for Rudin noted at the time that it requested the transfer to allow for negotiations to kick off for a loan modification.\nThose negotiations resulted in a four-year extension, which includes two one-year renewal options, pushing the debt maturity as far back as November 2029. Rudin will also invest $100 million in capital improvements, renovating the lobby, adding an on-site leasing center and elevating the street-level retail.\n\u201cWith this agreement, we will move forward in full confidence with our longstanding business plan, kickstarting an exciting new chapter for one of Downtown New York\u2019s most important and iconic buildings,\u201d Rudin president Neil Gupta said in a statement.\nAn Iron Hound Management team including Chris Herron, Kevin Thompson and Anthony D\u2019Amelio advised the landlord on the debt restructuring.\nRudin bought the former AT&amp;T headquarters in 1999 for $150 million and invested $100 million into the building, which was near full occupancy a decade ago. But occupancy\ndropped sharply\nonce the pandemic began and was at only 57 percent as of June, according to Fitch Ratings.\nCenturyLink Communications downsized significantly in 2021; Dentsu Holdings USA also downsized and ultimately relocated that same; and iHeartMedia division AMFM Operating also moved locations when its lease expired in 2022.\nRemaining tenants at the 28-story, 1.2-million-square-foot building include Dorilton and Industrious, which\nsigned a 52,000-square-foot lease\nfor the 13th floor back in 2021.\nIn 2015, Rudin borrowed $425 million to refinance the property with a CMBS-backed loan underwritten by JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The individual sales ranged in price from $8.5 million to $11 million per acre, or an average of about $790,000 per home lot and $9.7 million per acre.\n\u201cOur third quarter performance was underpinned by resilient home buyer and builder demand at the Great Park, which remains solid despite continuing pressure from higher interest rates and affordability headwinds,\u201d FivePoint CEO Dan Hedigan said on a third-quarter earnings call last month. \u201cWhile buyers remain somewhat cautious, the underlying imbalance between housing supply and demand in this core California market continues to support our land sale activity.\u201d\nIn the last quarter, builders sold 187 homes at the Great Park Neighborhoods, up from 112 in the second quarter.\nFivePoint\n, developer for the Great Park, has six actively selling programs expected to sell out by early next year, with an additional 10 new programs anticipated to begin sales either later this year or early next year.\nCurrently, sales are ongoing at Luna Park, the eighth community to open for occupancy at the Great Park Neighborhoods since the development opened in 2013. Homes in Luna Park start at about $1.2 million with larger homes fetching as much as $2.5 million.\nOverall, more than 7,000 homes and 9,000 home sites have sold at the Great Park Neighborhoods since it opened. The development is currently entitled for 10,500 homes.\nStill, while FivePoint was able to sell land at Great Park last quarter, the Irvine developer didn\u2019t close any land sales at Valencia, its other master-planned development near Six Flags in Santa Clarita; it hasn\u2019t sold any land there in about a year.

        "content": "Two of Chicago\u2019s more colorful real estate figures are squaring off in court over the former Rainforest Cafe site in River North.\nAlecko Lending, led by founder\nAlexander Pissios\n, filed a foreclosure lawsuit Monday against a Sean Conlon-led entity that owns 605 North Clark Street, alleging it defaulted on an $8.3 million bridge loan and now owes more than $9.2 million, including default interest and fees.\nThe suit seeks foreclosure, the appointment of a receiver and a deficiency judgment, while also waiving the borrower\u2019s right to redeem the property after a judgment is entered.\nBut Conlon, the investor behind the borrower known in part for starring on CNBC show \u201cThe Deed: Chicago,\u201d brushed off the suit as premature.\nWhile he said he doesn\u2019t blame the lender for being frustrated, he claims he has been paying penalty interest since June and intends to repay Alecko the full debt with proceeds from a refinancing he\u2019s planning.\nConlon owns other real estate in Texas, North Carolina and\nWest Palm Beach\nthat he suggested could be used as collateral in the upcoming refinancing, without specifying the amount of the loan he intends to borrow.\n\u201cWe were supposed to refinance in June,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve paid late fees, and we\u2019re close to finalizing a global refinance across all our assets \u2014 tens of millions.\u201d\nHe still believes in the River North property\u2019s long-term value, but acknowledged the Chicago market has been \u201ca nightmare.\u201d A controversial city decision to\nallow a cannabis retailer to open up\ninside the 22,000-square-foot former restaurant building blew up.\nThe would-be tenant, Progressive Treatment Solutions, backed out of leasing the space last year amid neighborhood backlash, including \u201clitigation, uncertainty and additional costs,\u201d its attorney said at the time. Plus, there was an earlier revelation that it was\ntoo close to other dispensaries\nto comply with state law.\nConlon said his side may bring suit against Progressive stemming from its retreat, while also claiming he has \u201cso much equity\u201d in the property. He bought it with another investor, Joe Scoby, for $13.7 million in 2013.\nPissios, who sold the film and TV studio Cinespace Chicago in a $1 billion deal in 2021 and has since pivoted into hard-nosed lending, has a growing track record of snapping up distressed real estate \u2014 and he isn\u2019t shy about using the courts to seize collateral.\nHis Alecko vehicle this year bought a River North office property at\n620 North LaSalle Drive\nout of distress for $7.4 million. Pissios also bought a Fulton Market building at\n232 North Carpenter Street\nfor $11 million in 2022, and he\u2019s known to move fast when borrowers miss payments.\nAlecko and its representatives didn\u2019t return requests for comment. Pissios gained notoriety in Chicago for helping federal law enforcement officers nail union boss\nJohn T. Coli\n, who was sentenced to 19 months in prison in 2022, by secretly recording their conversations. Pissios was trying to avoid a bankruptcy fraud charge at the time he began cooperating with authorities.\nConlon insisted his record is clean.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never not paid back a loan,\u201d he said. \u201cNot going to change at this age \u2014 I\u2019m 56, going on 80.\u201d\nHowever, Conlon was part of the borrower entity that faces a\n$6.4 million foreclosure lawsuit\nfor the 41,000-square-foot office building at 401 West Ontario Street, which is now set to be sold out of receivership for more than $5 million to an entity led by Chicago-based Drew Friestedt\u2019s Monroe Residential Partners, federal court records filed earlier this month show.\nThe 605 North Clark site, home to the kitschy Rainforest Cafe from 1997 until it shuttered in 2020, has long been seen as a redevelopment target. But with litigation now clouding its future and a lender pushing for a forced sale, its fate could hinge on whether Conlon can close his refinancing in time.\n\u201cThis is a tempest in a teacup,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a seasoned pro. Chicago will find its feet. And I still believe in owning Rainforest.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Goldman Sachs unloaded an office property near Goose Island for less than half what it spent to buy the site.\nAn affiliate of the New York-based investment giant sold the three-story, 100,600-square-foot office building at 1400 North Kingsbury Street for just under $11.2 million to a joint venture between Chicago developer R2 and local investor Peppercorn Capital, according to Cook County records\nreported\nby Crain\u2019s.\nThe price equates to $111 per square foot. Cushman &amp; Wakefield brokers Cody Hundertmark and Tom Sitz represented the sellers.\nThe deal follows Goldman\u2019s $19.5 million sale last year of the adjacent REI store at\n1422 North Kingsbury\nto a California buyer.\nThe combined $30.7 million deals represent a steep loss for Goldman, which teamed with R2 in 2015 to acquire and redevelop the two buildings for about $50 million, including renovations and tenant improvements.\nR2\nheld a minority stake in the partnership at the time. Despite generating steady income over the years, the sale highlights malaise in Chicago\u2019s office sector, where elevated borrowing costs, and soft investor appetite have hammered values.\nThe Kingsbury deal illustrates the painful math facing some landlords looking to sell in a market still contending with high vacancies since the pandemic. Goldman declined to comment on its decision to exit the properties.\nR2 CEO Matt Garrison told the outlet that his firm, now in a 50-50 joint venture with Peppercorn, views the building as a solid long-term bet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great building in a niche neighborhood with tight office supply that\u2019s being decreased by residential conversions,\u201d Garrison said. \u201cWe like the demand story, the cost structure and the product-market fit of loft offices and want to own more of them.\u201d\nThe property, which includes a 44-space parking lot at 1301 North Kingsbury, was nearly full when Goldman and R2 bought it, anchored by staffing firm Seaton. That tenant left for the Old Post Office just before the pandemic, prompting a $9.4 million round of upgrades led by Cushman &amp; Wakefield. Core Spaces signed a 10-year lease last year for 36,000 square feet, helping lift occupancy to roughly 73 percent.\nPeppercorn\u2019s Phil Denny, who has mostly focused on the\nWest Loop\nand the\nKinzie Industrial Corridor\n, said he\u2019s betting on momentum across neighborhoods, pointing to recent leasing gains and a pickup in activity around Fulton Market.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

In a statement, Community Capital Partners said the name change sought to \u201cbetter describe the beautiful property and the inclusive, family-centered, mixed-use, master-planned community being designed.\u201d\nPlans for The Meadow, about 40 miles northeast of downtown Dallas, include more than 1,000 homes, senior and assisted-living facilities, apartments, a community college, a mosque, a K\u201312 faith-based school, retail, medical clinics and athletic fields.\nCommunity Capital Partners is a for-profit venture founded by members of the East Plano Islamic Center, one of the region\u2019s largest mosques.\nThe rebrand follows months of political heat. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and other top Republicans have called for\ninvestigations\ninto the project, citing potential securities violations and discrimination concerns.\nPaxton last month accused the developers of breaking federal and state securities laws, though he didn\u2019t specify which ones, and said he was considering legal action pending a referral from the State Securities Board.\nOther probes have fizzled. In September, the Texas Workforce Commission\nsettled\na Fair Housing Act complaint against the developers. The U.S. Department of Justice dropped its\ncivil rights inquiry\nin June, which it had opened after Sen. John Cornyn raised concerns that the project might exclude non-Muslim residents.\nGov.

The activity is fueling a leasing surge even as the neighborhood\u2019s total office stock shrinks, according to a JLL report.\nOverall, leasing in the area this year is already more than twice last year\u2019s total. Available space is tightening as more properties are slated for residential makeovers.\nSince 2020, more than 5.5 million square feet of downtown office space has been converted to housing; another 5.8 million square feet could face the same fate, according to JLL. Yet rather than decamping for Midtown or Brooklyn, most tenants are simply hopping to other Lower Manhattan buildings.\n\u201cThe tenants that are or were in the buildings that are getting converted have become an important part of the current leasing velocity,\u201d Rosenberg &amp; Estis attorney Michael Lefkowitz told the publication.\nThe rash of conversions stems from New York\u2019s 467m tax incentive program, which offers property tax breaks to owners converting outdated office buildings into apartments. The program\u2019s deadlines \u2014 start by 2031, finish by 2039, steeper benefits for earlier starts \u2014 create pressure for developers to move fast, forcing tenants to vacate with little notice.\nThe result is a game of musical chairs in which law firms, engineers and other professional tenants are snapping up remaining Class A space nearby.\nEngineering firm Arup and law firm Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard &amp; Smith both\nlanded\nat Union Investment\u2019s 140 Broadway after being displaced from\n77 Water Street\n, which Vanbarton Group plans to turn into 650 rentals.

        "content": "An incomplete estate on Indian Creek just hit the market asking $200 million, making it Miami-Dade County\u2019s most expensive listing.\nThat also makes it, by extension, among the priciest homes on the market in the U.S. The sellers of the nearly 28,000-square-foot home at 7 Indian Creek Island Road are Dr. Aaron Rollins, a cosmetic surgeon, and his wife, Marine Rollins, a real estate agent with Miami Global Realty, according to the Wall Street Journal. Dr. Rollins is a liposuction specialist, and the creator of AirSculpt, a body contouring procedure that involves fat removal.\nJill,\nDanny\nand Hillary Hertzberg with the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker Realty have the listing.\nThe Rollinses hired Ontario-based Ferris Rafauli to design the sprawling, waterfront compound, which is under construction. Plans for the mansion include nine bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, four half-bathrooms, spa facilities, a salon, theater, library, jazz lounge and a 1,500-gallon aquarium. The estate will also have a pool, a 135-foot dock and 200 feet of waterfront.\nThey bought the property from singer-songwriter Julio Iglesias for\n$30 million\nin 2020. They also own a waterfront home in the Venetian Islands on a property they bought for\n$4.3 million\nin 2016.\nIf it sells anywhere near the asking price, the Indian Creek estate would set a record for single-family home sales in Miami-Dade County. The current record was set in March when billionaire developer Vlad Doronin sold his Star Island estate in Miami Beach for\n$120 million\n. The Florida record for home sales was set in April when the billionaire DeGroote family sold their waterfront Naples estate for\n$225 million\n.\nIndian Creek has seen its share of pricey deals and high-profile buyers. Billionaire Jeff Bezos\ndropped $234 million\non a trio of homes on the island last year. In June, a vacant lot neighboring his property sold for\n$105 million\n. Known as the \u201cBillionaire Bunker,\u201d Indian Creek is also home to Tom Brady, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, DJ David Guetta, developer Jeffrey Soffer, and billionaires Carl Icahn and Eddie Lampert.\nThe Rollins\u2019 estate is the latest trophy listing in South Florida\u2019s booming ultra-luxury market. The pandemic triggered a massive wealth migration to the region that fueled demand for homes priced at $50 million or more. With the busy season approaching, the region\u2019s most expensive homes are debuting on the market. Last week, an oceanfront teardown in Palm Beach hit the market asking $185 million.\nSpec developer Todd Glaser and his partners bought a 2.3-acre waterfront North Bay Road property for $105 million in July, which they have relisted for $169 million. They plan to build an\nestate asking $300 million\n.",

        "content": "Ballast Investments and The Carlyle Group are doubling down on multifamily in San Francisco.\nThe joint venture between the two firms acquired the Grosvenor Court apartment building at 2055 Sacramento Street in Pacific Heights for $31.9 million, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The seller was an affiliate of San Francisco-based Grosvenor Properties, which owned the property for at least three decades.\nThe price for the 86-unit property works out to about $371,000 per unit.\nThe deal marks the third multifamily acquisition between local firm Ballast and Washington, D.C.-based Carlyle. The firms\nbought 1425 Taylor Street for $14.3 million and 1900 Washington Street for $11.6 million\nin June. The purchases totaled 74 units at $350,000 per unit.\nResidential rental rates in San Francisco, already one of the country\u2019s most-expensive markets, ticked up in recent months.\nThe city had the strongest annual rent growth in the country this summer. By this August, the city\u2019s rental market had\nrecovered the price losses\nbrought on by the pandemic, according to Zumper.\nThe following month,\nrents exceeded pre-pandemic rates\n. Rent growth for a two-bedroom apartment was up 17.1 percent year-over-year, while one-bedroom rents were up 10.7 percent.\nThe increase in rents is attributable to return-to-office mandates, as well as an influx of residents working in the\nbooming artificial intelligence sector\n.\nAs a result, capital partners like Carlyle have been warming back up to San Francisco. Besides Caryle, other institutional investors like Fortress Investment Group, Hines and DivcoWest have also gotten back into the market.\nGrosvenor Court is a \u201cclassic San Francisco multifamily\u201d property that is \u201cpositioned for growth in a recovering market,\u201d Ballast co-founder and CEO Greg MacDonald said of the latest acquisition.\nBallast has more than 7,700 units in its portfolio nationwide. Earlier this year, the San Francisco-based firm was selected by a receiver to manage the Parkmerced, the largest multifamily property in the city with 3,221 units.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A veteran trading executive is doubling down on one of\nLincoln Park\u2019s\nmost-exclusive residential blocks with a $4 million addition.\nChris Gust, principal at Wolverine Trading and CEO and CIO of Wolverine Asset Management, and his wife, Susan, are adding to their Burling Street mansion, according to city records\nreported\nby Crain\u2019s.\nThe project will attach a two-story structure with a basement, covered porch and roof deck to the couple\u2019s four-story home. The expansion will include an outdoor pool on a lot adjacent to the house at 1871 North Burling Street. Von Weise Associates is listed as the architect, and Savane Design + Build will handle construction.\nThe Gusts\u2019 property is part of the\nBurling-Orchard-Howe\nenclave of mansions that has defined the upper-tier of\nLincoln Park\nfor nearly two decades. In 1998, the couple paid $1.19 million for the parcel, later building the 6,200-square-foot mansion. In 2016, they acquired the lot to the north after buying out all six condos in a small building for $2.95 million.\nNow they\u2019re expanding to the south lot where the addition will rise. The three parcels total roughly three-tenths of an acre.\nHow much they\u2019ve invested in the estate is hard to pin down, but available records suggest the owners have spent at least $8.1 million between land purchases and the construction permit, likely much more when factoring in earlier building costs and any undisclosed lot acquisitions.\nThe Cook County Assessor last valued the core mansion and its original lot at $5.34 million.\nThe project reinforces Burling Street\u2019s reputation as one of Chicago\u2019s concentrated luxury corridors, where recent sales have topped\n$10 million\nincluding the\nRichard and Michaela Parrillo\nestate that fetched $15.2 million last year.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Pricing is reportedly in the $100 million neighborhood, people familiar with the deal told the publication, which would come to roughly $300,000 per unit.\nThe San Francisco rental market has been bouncing back in the past year after a pandemic crash, with median rents\nsurpassing pre-pandemic prices\nin September. As of early this year, Baupost reportedly had $23 billion under management, including a large number of apartments in San Francisco acquired in the years before the pandemic. Tech employees moving into the city to work for one of the many burgeoning artificial intelligence companies have simultaneously\nhelped drive up rental rates\nand apartment demand.\nVeritas\n, the owner of the roughly 300-unit apartment portfolio before Prado and Baupost, started defaulting on debt tied to portfolios of apartments in San Francisco during the pandemic. Prado and Baupost teamed up to\nacquire the nonperforming debt\nand ultimately agreed to\nbecome the new owners of the apartments in November 2023\n.\nThe two firms are now looking to sell off those apartment buildings. Veritas recently received a notice of default for a $570 million loan backed by another portfolio of approximately 1,500 apartments in San Francisco. The firm has said it plans to bring on a new investor to avoid foreclosure on the properties.\nIn the two years since taking over the 17 buildings hitting the market, Prado and Baupost have invested in improving the portfolio of properties, including taking care of issues like deferred maintenance. Now that the work on the apartments is complete, the firms are looking to offload them.\nAt the same time, Prado is working on various redevelopment projects across the city, including residences at 3333 California Street and California Pacific Medical Center\u2019s former Presidio Heights campus.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "BLDG Management has plans for Jersey City that stand to break records.\nLloyd Goldman\u2019s firm announced plans for a 1,300-unit complex at 100 Bay Street in the New Jersey municipality. NJBIZ\nreported\n. The project is expected to span 1.6 million square feet and replace a lot that\u2019s been vacant for nearly two decades.\nThe full-block site, also known as 111 First Street, began as the site for P. Lorillard Tobacco Company\u2019s warehouse after the conclusion of the Civil War. That factory shut down in 1956 and the site ultimately became an artist community before its demolition, according to\nJerseyDigs\n.\nThe height is the most jaw-dropping element of the proposal. Plans call for two towers rising from a single podium base. One would be 40 stories tall, while the other would be a whopping 90 stories tall; a 40th-floor sky bridge would connect the two.\nIn total, the development would check in at 1,055 feet tall. That would represent the fourth-tallest residential column in both the region and the entire country, according to BLDG, not to mention the tallest in Jersey City.\nPelli Clarke &amp; Partners is designing the project, which would include 20 percent of units set aside for affordable housing. There will also be 29,000 square feet of amenities and ground-floor retail space.\nThe project is also expected to provide \u201cabundant\u201d parking options to residents, according to the developer. Just in case those spaces aren\u2019t plentiful enough, there will be three PATH stations, one ferry depot and two Light Rail stops, all less than a mile away.\nBLDG has yet to submit an application to Jersey City, meaning the Planning Board still needs to approve the proposal before construction commences.\nShould the project come to fruition, BLDG will have plenty of skyline-shaping company in Jersey City\u2019s multifamily market.\nA joint venture of SJP Properties, Claremont Development and Battery Global Advisors is\ndeveloping The Lucy\nat 619 Grove Street, a 23-story, 444-unit project.\nThe Namdar Group\u2019s projects at 29 Van Reipen Avenue and 612 Pavonia Avenue in Jersey City are expected to\ndeliver more than 1,100 units\nto the Journal Square neighborhood.\nAnd Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies\nprovided a $515 million loan\nfor Kushner Companies\u2019 One Journal Square, which opened to residents several months ago and spans 2 million square feet across two 52-story towers, containing 1,723 units.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The firm has no immediate plans to redevelop the golf course, the source said.\nThe sprawling site at 2470 Greenview Cove Drive has been fraught with controversy and failed redevelopment attempts.\nVeterinarian Scott Swerdlin, who owns Palm Beach Equine Clinic, bought the golf course from\nStraub\nfor $16 million in 2019. Straub\u2019s struggles to win redevelopment approvals led to years of neglect, frustrating residents whose multimillion-dollar homes overlooked the once-pristine greens, published reports state.\nStraub\nblamed the village of Wellington and Palm Beach Polo Property Owners Association for his decision to cease property maintenance of the golf course. Village records detailed 73 municipal citations issued to Straub between 2003 and 2019 for property upkeep, building permit issues and other violations.\nIn 2022, Swerdlin attempted a land use amendment to pave the way for new housing, proposing up to 125 single-family homes, but the plan failed to gain traction, village records show.\nBH has one of the most active real estate investment and development pipelines in South Florida. The firm and partner Gold Standard of Care recently picked up Sterling Aventura, a 171-unit senior living facility in Aventura, at a deep discount of\n$36.9 million\n. The joint venture paid Blackstone $12 million for Sterling Aventura. In 2017, Blackstone paid $48.9 million for the property.\nAlso near Aventura, BH and Lennar are redeveloping a shuttered 104.3-acre golf course into\nGreenview at Presidential Estates\n, a luxury 103-single-family home community.BH is also collaborating with other developers such as the Related Group, Dezer Development and Kolter Group on luxury condominium projects across South Florida, including a planned Ritz-Carlton branded tower in\nWest Palm Beach\n.",

That came nearly a year after the firm announced plans to\nadd nine soundstages\n, post-production facilities, base camps and offices to the studio lot once run by 20th Century Fox.\nFox Studio Lot, founded in 1928, has 15 studio soundstages.

The group voted in support of Masterplan\u2019s proposal, which is being designed in collaboration with Newport Beach-based Brandon Architects.\nPlans call for 50 or fewer for-sale units, including a two-story penthouse.\nUnits will range from 2,100 to 3,900 square feet, with the penthouse sprawling 8,000 square feet and featuring six bedrooms, a private pool and outdoor lounge.\nThe building\u2019s second level would serve as an amenity deck, with a 2,600-square-foot club, pool and spa, as well as a 3,000-square-foot fitness center alongside more than 10,000 square feet of outdoor space.\nThe 31,000-square-foot development site at 3618 Gillespie Street is surrounded by rental townhomes fetching about $4,000 a month.\nMasterplan\nCEO Dallas Cothrum told the outlet that the property owner is ready to sell when the project advances, describing the planned tower as \u201cvery luxurious\u201d and a step up in sophistication for Turtle Creek. The project would have about 120 parking spaces across three underground levels.\nZoning approval is the next hurdle. The site is zoned for low-rise multifamily. Cothrum said his team plans to file a zoning case later this month, with hopes of appearing before the City Plan Commission early next year.\nIf it moves forward, One Welborn would join a growing cluster of upscale condo developments reshaping\nTurtle Creek\n.

        "content": "One year ago, the City Council upended how apartments are rented in New York City.\nOn November 13, 2024, the Council\napproved\nthe Fairness in Apartment Rental Expenses (FARE) Act, a measure that banned forcing tenants to pay fees for rental brokers they did not hire.\nThe bill\u2019s approval was the culmination of years of efforts to reform a system that often cost tenants thousands of extra dollars to secure an apartment. Proponents of the FARE Act argued that this dynamic gave landlords more leverage to raise rents at lease renewal, knowing that tenants likely wanted to avoid those upfront costs.\nOpponents, including the Real Estate Board of New York,\nhave blamed the law\nfor rising rents and the disappearance of public listings, as owners push the cost of broker fees to tenants and try to avoid the appearance of hiring a broker. The group is awaiting a federal appeals court decision on\nits legal challenge to the law\n.\nThis week marks one year since the bill\u2019s passage, and seven months since the law went into effect.\nHere\u2019s how the law has played out so far:\nListing Volume\nDespite the industry\u2019s outcry over the law, the consequences haven\u2019t been as clear-cut as some predicted.\nWithin 24 hours of its adoption, more than 1,000 listings\ndropped from StreetEasy\n, as agents and landlords scrambled to rewrite contracts and revise their listings to comply with the new rules.\nBut a month later, the platform published a report stating that the drastic dip was short-lived. By the end of June, daily inventory on the site had increased more than 4 percent since the beginning of the month, an uptick that was only slightly lower than the change during the same time period last year.\nStill, rental listings on the portal declined annually for each month since the FARE Act passed, according to data from StreetEasy. Inventory fell 6 percent in July, 8 percent in August, 6 percent in September and 7 percent in October.\nHowever, the decreases in inventory are likely the result of multiple factors, not just the new law.\n\u201cWhile the FARE Act may have had some impact, the combination of low supply and high demand is what is primarily driving these trends that we have seen at play for several years,\u201d said StreetEasy senior economist Kenny Lee.\nCompetition for apartments has been increasing for the last two years, Lee added, as more companies called their employees back to work and higher mortgage rates kept some potential home buyers in the rental market.\nBut on REBNY\u2019s residential listing service, the declines following the FARE Act are more pronounced. Data from the trade group shows inventory dropped 12 percent year-over-year in June, followed by declines of 16 percent, 20 percent, 23 percent and 32 percent in each of the months after.\nLast October, more than 2,000 listings for apartments in Manhattan hit the RLS, but last month, that number dropped to less than 500, according to UrbanDigs co-founder John Walkup.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where that volume is going,\u201d said Walkup. \u201cThey\u2019re still being listed for rent somewhere, somehow,\u201d he added, referring to other listing websites.\nWalkup added that the decline is likely more pronounced because the RLS only captures properties marketed by agents with exclusive agreements with landlords, which are likely in shorter supply now that landlords are responsible for paying them. As a result, the apartments available on the RLS skew toward the higher end of the rental market, where landlords are better able to absorb the cost of hiring an agent bc of the rent charge.\nBut both factors have made it tough for someone like Walkup, whose company relies on data from the RLS, to\nmake heads or tails\nof the rental market.\n\u201cAs well-intended as [the law] was, it has thrown a lot of confusion into the ranks,\u201d Walkup said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you if it\u2019s cheaper to rent an apartment, but I can tell you that if you\u2019re renting an apartment in Manhattan . . . the face values are a lot higher than they were a year ago.\u201d\nFollowing the passage of the FARE Act,\nmedian rents rose\n, though not dramatically, on a month-to-month basis, according to an analysis of StreetEasy data by\nThe Real Deal\n. In June 2025, the median rent for listings on the listing platform was $4,000, a 2.6 percent increase from the previous month and a 5.2 percent jump year over year. The rate increased another .7 percent in July, representing a 6 percent increase from the previous year.\nThe median rate stayed flat the next month and decreased .8 percent in September (still 7.2 percent higher than September 2024) and dropped another 1.1 percent in October. At $3,950, the median rent in October 2025 was 8.2 percent higher than the same month last year.\n\u201cWith vacancy rates expected to stay low, the pace of rent growth will stay elevated this year and next,\u201d said StreetEasy\u2019s Lee.\nBrokerage business\nWhile the debate over how the FARE Act will impact renters\u2019 wallets continues, it has become clear that the pie has gotten smaller for brokerages and agents.\n\u201cA lot of the open listing, tenant rep agents, their business has really suffered as a result of the FARE Act,\u201d Living New York co-founder Devin Someck said. Open listings, in which multiple brokerages were signed up to show the same rental unit, often came with the tenant covering the broker\u2019s fee, a practice prohibited under the FARE Act.\nSomeck, whose firm works as both a landlord rep and property manager, said that he\u2019s seen a swell of agents \u201cseeking a kind of refuge\u201d at this firm because of its strong landlord relationships.\nHe said his portfolio, which used to be split between listings where the owner pays and the tenant pays, now falls entirely under the owner pays category due to the law. He added that he\u2019s seen larger shops pull back from the leasing business as profit margins have narrowed as a result of landlords scaling back their commission payments.\nAt the same time, leasing agents have also seen their commission volumes suffer as landlords more aggressively pursue renewals rather than pay out broker fees, according to Someck.\nJennifer Nobis, an agent with Bond New York, said that she still has landlord clients who are holding units off the market, unsure if they will try to rent out the apartments themselves or sell instead.\n\u201cFor smaller landlords, the margin isn\u2019t there,\u201d she said.\nThat applies doubly to rent-stabilized units, which have already been struggling after the passage of the 2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act took away many of the levers landlords could pull to increase rents in their rent-stabilized properties, according to Bohemia Realty CEO Sarah Saltzberg.\n\u201cThe owners that are losing money across the board on this asset type are certainly not looking to spend money that they don\u2019t have to,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if they can save a one-month broker fee, they will, and they\u2019ll just say, \u2018Find a way to get me a tenant another way.\u2019 \u201d\nSaltzberg says that she had already shifted her brokerage business away from rent-stabilized properties after 2019, but that the FARE Act further drove her to focus on exclusive landlord relationships.\n\u201cAny open listings that we worked on, or limited listings, it\u2019s almost impossible to service those listings, because how do you let people know about them,\u201d Saltzberg said.\nIt has also meant that she can\u2019t use her shop as a training ground for up-and-coming agents who used to be able to cut their teeth on open listings, admitting that her firm has gotten smaller as she\u2019s reoriented hiring towards experienced agents that can maintain valuable landlord connections.\n\u201cThe old rule used to be, you\u2019d have 20 percent of your agents making 80 percent of the revenue,\u201d Saltzberg said. \u201cNow we have a smaller team, but almost every single person is making real money.\u201d\nLegal fight\nREBNY wasted no time filing a legal challenge to the FARE Act.\nOne month after its passage, the trade group\nfiled a lawsuit\nin federal court, alleging, among other things, that the law violates the First Amendment rights of brokers and landlords because it discourages the publishing of rental listings. Under the FARE Act, a broker who advertises a rental is assumed to have been hired by the landlord.\nThe city, which is the target of the lawsuit, maintains that the law doesn\u2019t \u201cbar the publication of anything by anyone,\u201d but sets ground rules for listings published with the blessing of a landlord.\nJust one day before the law went into effect, Judge Ronnie Abrams\ndelivered\na major blow to the group: Not only did she refuse to pause the new rules, but she dismissed a majority of REBNY\u2019s claims.\nShe threw out the First Amendment claim and another that the FARE Act is preempted by state law. REBNY\u2019s allegation that the law defies the Contract Clause survived, though Abrams cast doubt on the claim outweighing the law\u2019s \u201csignificant and legitimate public purpose.\u201d\nAbrams also denied REBNY\u2019s subsequent request to halt the law while it pursued an appeal.\nREBNY\nappealed\nto the Second Circuit, which also rejected its request to pause the FARE Act. The group is waiting for a decision on its appeal of Abrams\u2019 dismissal of the First Amendment claim.\nIn court filings, the city has argued that reversing the law at this point would \u201ccreate chaos.\u201d\nREBNY has long held that the law is bad for both brokers and tenants. For the latter, the group has warned that the law would result in fewer public listings and drive up rents.\n\u201cThe longer this law is in effect, the longer consumers and owners are going to be adversely affected,\u201d said Carl Hum, vice president and general counsel at REBNY.\nHum said brokers are still navigating the law\u2019s gray areas, including what constitutes conditioning rental of a unit on hiring a broker, which is barred under the FARE Act. Dual agency \u2014\u00a0where a broker represents a tenant and a landlord \u2014\u00a0is still permitted, but a broker can\u2019t publish a listing on behalf of a landlord and then collect a fee from the tenant who leases the apartment advertised.\nWhat\u2019s next\nIf the Second Circuit upholds the lower court\u2019s dismissal of REBNY\u2019s claims, the trade group could petition the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the case. The country\u2019s highest court receives, on average, between 7,000 and 8,000 petitions each year but only hears about 80 cases.\nThe group could also seek legislative changes, though it seems unlikely that there would be much appetite to do so under the City Council or new mayoral administration.\nBrooklyn Council member Chi Oss\u00e9, the FARE Act\u2019s lead sponsor, isn\u2019t concerned about the case.\n\u201cThey already lost when we passed this law, and they\u2019ve lost in court at every turn since,\u201d Oss\u00e9 said in an email. \u201cWe\u2019ve beaten them once, and we\u2019ll beat them again.\u201d\nHe said the FARE Act shifted power back to tenants when negotiating lease renewals with their landlord. Tenants typically paid 15 percent of the annual cost of rent to the broker, adding thousands of dollars to the cost of moving.\n\u201cBefore the FARE Act, tenants at lease renewal faced two options: stay and swallow the new rent or leave and take a huge hit in upfront costs,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the end of forced broker fees, bargaining power is now in the hands of tenants at renewal, and that shift will put downward pressure on rents across the city.\u201d\nOss\u00e9 said he\u2019s confident that Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani will help strengthen the law and ramp up enforcement. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection has received 1,125 complaints since June 11, according to Brick Underground. Oss\u00e9 said that most of these complaints didn\u2019t include enough information for city officials to take action and believes the City Council could help educate tenants about what kind of evidence they need to present to pursue claims.\n\u201cOur job is to help them turn those reports into actual results so every landlord and broker who breaks the law is held fully accountable,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "One of the most powerful figures in global real estate investing is leaving the building.\nBlackstone\u2019s Kathleen McCarthy, who helped grow the firm\u2019s property arm into a $320 billion behemoth, will depart by year\u2019s end after 15 years with the company, Bisnow\nreported\n. McCarthy, 47, has served since 2018 as global co-head of Blackstone Real Estate \u2014 the world\u2019s largest private property investor \u2014 and will step down to \u201cexplore new opportunities,\u201d the company said. Her co-lead,\nNadeem Meghji\n, 45, will take over as sole head of the business.\nMcCarthy joined the firm in 2008 from Goldman Sachs. Since then, Blackstone\u2019s assets under management nearly tripled from $115 billion to $320 billion. That growth occurred during multiple real estate cycles: the post-financial crisis boom, the\npandemic disruption\nand the higher-rate slump that followed in 2022.\nShe wrote in a LinkedIn post that leading the firm\u2019s real estate arm was \u201cone of the great privileges\u201d of her career.\nBefore taking the top job in 2018, McCarthy served as chief operating officer of Blackstone\u2019s real estate division. She stepped up alongside Ken Caplan when longtime chief Jon Gray became Blackstone\u2019s president. After Caplan was promoted to global co-CIO last year, Meghji \u2014 then head of North American real estate \u2014 was elevated to share leadership with McCarthy.\nThe timing of McCarthy\u2019s departure comes as Blackstone pivots back to deal mode, having sold $16.9 billion worth of real estate in the first nine months of 2025, roughly in line with last year\u2019s pace.\nIt\u2019s unclear what McCarthy\u2019s next move will be. Blackstone veterans have made waves after leaving the firm.

Especially about the future.\nI\u2019m not sure if Yogi Berra actually said that, but it\u2019s particularly true for elected officials talking about real estate, a topic they think they understand but don\u2019t.\nState Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal said in November 2021 that the Soho/Noho rezoning would invite an\ninflux of big-box stores\n. The rezoning was approved weeks later. Have you noticed any big-box stores opening in Soho and Noho?\nCity Comptroller Brad Lander managed to get the New York Times to publish his\nop-ed\nin 2020 saying the pandemic would trigger a wave of multifamily foreclosures, so the city should prepare to buy them on the cheap and turn them into social housing.\nThe wave of foreclosures didn\u2019t happen, as people soon returned to the city and rents shot right back to where they had been, and then higher.\nOne comment that politicians and activists often make about a market-rate project that would be the first in a particular low-income area is that it will cause other towers to pop up like weeds, and before you know it, there goes the neighborhood!\nOn that note, consider the fate of the Jay Group\u2019s 90-foot-tall, 183-unit apartment building at 2886 Atlantic Avenue in East New York, a neighborhood that most would-be gentrifiers cannot even find on a map. Permits were\nfiled\nfor the project in early 2022.\nFast forward to this 2025\nheadline\nabout the project in City Limits:\n\u201cThis Building Was Supposed to be Luxury Apartments. Now It Will House 183 Families From Homeless Shelters.\u201d\nDemand for one-bedrooms priced at $2,500 to $3,000 per month did not materialize, and the Jay Group had sold it to Camber Property Group and the Institute for Community Living.\nDevelopers don\u2019t control the future any more than politicians can predict it. They look to invest in areas with untapped demand and try to get a lender to sign on. Sometimes they guess wrong.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nAre the locals who feared gentrification in East New York happy that they got homeless people instead? Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: New York students in elementary, middle and high school will be taught personal finance beginning next year, the Albany Times Union\nreported\n. It\u2019s a long-overdue reform that many other states have already made. Whether it will eventually reduce the number of adults overwhelmed by credit card debt or help more people qualify for a mortgage is anyone\u2019s guess, but it was educational malpractice not to give them more tools to navigate their financial future.\nElsewhere\u2026\nA father called me from North Carolina, asking for a link to a\nTRD\nstory about substantial rehabilitation as one of the last remaining ways to remove a building from rent stabilization. He was doing research for his son, who is in court trying to get a six-month lease for an SRO in an old hotel that the owner is trying to convert into market-rate rentals.\nThe property has just two SRO units left, down from 72, as many tenants accepted buyouts.\nThe conversation became heated when he called it an example of greed by real estate investors wiping out affordable housing. I said, Have you ever asked for a raise? Does that make you greedy?\nThe law allows for deregulation in certain circumstances, I said. If the developer can convince the court that he has a legal right to deny your son the lease, he may do so. If not, your son can move in. That\u2019s why we have a court system.\nThe caller settled down and thanked me for\nthe link\n(\u201cHow Greenbrook weathered the storm\u201d).\nClosing time\nResidential:\nNo filings on Veterans Day.\nCommercial:\nNo filings. See above!\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$11.25 million\nfor a pre-war co-op unit at 911 Park Avenue on the Upper East Side. Michael J. Franco, Miriam Richards and Greg Holzmann of Compass have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 56,542-square-foot,\n99-unit\nresidential project at 3999 Carpenter Avenue in Wakefield.

        "content": "Donald Trump took to Truth Social to blast Chicago\u2019s retail market, pointing to the \u201cMiracle Mile\u201d as evidence. Trouble is, he got the name wrong. It\u2019s the\nMagnificent Mile\n, and his other facts weren\u2019t much sharper.\nIn a now-viral message posted shortly before midnight, the president confused the name of the Windy City\u2019s famous shopping corridor with a stretch of retail in Los Angeles, and painted a bleak picture of urban decay that\u2019s out of step with reality.\n\u201cThe Miracle Mile Shopping Center in Chicago, once considered our Nation\u2019s BEST, now has a more than 28% vacancy factor, and is ready to call it quits unless something is done about the murder and crime, which is prevalent throughout the City,\u201d the 79-year-old president said on the platform. \u201cCALL IN THE TROOPS, FAST, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!\u201d\nThe vacancy rate on the Mag Mile is about 25 percent. And that has come down from 30 percent two years ago. It\u2019s unclear why President Trump chose now to post his critique.\nThe White House didn\u2019t immediately return a request for clarity on Trump\u2019s social media post.\nYes, there\u2019s been some deals for office towers on the\nMag Mile that fell apart\nor traded at dismal prices. See billionaire Neil Bluhm\u2019s struggle to sell 401 North Michigan Avenue, and Connecticut-based developer Commonwealth\u2019s plan to convert\n500 North Michigan\ninto housing after buying the 24-story building for just $5.1 million.\nMore to the president\u2019s point, there was a high-profile smash-and-grab incident at the Mag Mile\u2019s Louis Vuitton store at 919 North Michigan that led to a fatal car crash in August, when 40-year-old Mark Arceta was killed by one of the alleged perpetrators speeding through the intersection of Michigan and Ohio Street. Arceta\u2019s partner was reportedly due to give birth the next day, according to Block Club Chicago\nreporting\n.\nThere\u2019s no argument that the commercial property market is in rough shape right now. Murder charges have been filed in connection with the tragedy. Yet it\u2019s not clear whether that incident or another prompted Trump to chide the city.\nFurthermore, retail crime in the Chicago Police Department district including the Mag Mile has dropped by 4 percent year-over-year, and foot traffic is returning, according to a recent report by on-again, off-again Trump ally Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, the commercial vacancy rate is improving as landlords recalibrate rents to today\u2019s more sober expectations, giving new tenants a shot at prime real estate without the pre-pandemic sticker shock.\nPlus, developer\nAMLI Residential\nin September unveiled plans to build 498 rental units with nearly 27,000 square feet of retail within a 56-story skyscraper at 669 North Michigan \u2014 that type of investment usually doesn\u2019t occur on commercial corridors that require the National Guard to come in and clean up, as Trump suggested the Mag Mile does.\nIt\u2019s true that prime shopping strips in other cities, such as\nRodeo Drive\nin Beverly Hills and\nFifth Avenue\nin New York, have had their vacancy rates drop below pre-pandemic levels.\nChicago\u2019s Mag Mile has seen an uptick, however. It comes as property values on Michigan Avenue have corrected from their overheated pre-Covid peaks. Retailers who might have once balked at Mag Mile premiums are starting to jump back in, enticed by more reasonable rates and stabilized street conditions. The area isn\u2019t back to its old glory \u2014 several flagships remain dark \u2014 but it\u2019s not the retail graveyard Trump implied either.\nIronically, Trump\u2019s own tower is just a block west of the Mag Mile\u2019s base, so he should know the corridor\u2019s name. It\u2019s understandable, though, why he might be\npersonally frustrated\nwith the city\u2019s retail market. The Trump International Hotel and Tower has long struggled to lease its 70,000-square-foot retail space fronting the Chicago River. The Trump Organization earlier this year hired Newmark brokers to try to finally fill the space, which has sat largely vacant since the building opened over a decade ago.\nThe Newmark team said there\u2019s momentum at the Trump Tower space, however, and pointed out some positive signs for the proximate Mag Mile. \u201cWe\u2019re currently in active discussions with a number of prospective tenants, including a 2,800-square-foot space that\u2019s out to lease, as well as several larger restaurant and entertainment concepts,\u201d James Schutter of Newmark said in an email, without mentioning details of the Trump Tower deal in the works.\nHe did mention several factors propelling the Mag Mile\u2019s rebound, though. Among them are lines out the door for the recently started Harry Potter store, Aritzia opening in a former Gap shop and fellow apparel retailer Uniqlo returning to Michigan Avenue after closing a different store in 2021. And there\u2019s a\n$50 million investment into a magic-themed, adults-only theater\ncalled The Hand &amp; The Eye going into the Mag Mile at 100 East Ontario Street.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see Mag Mile\u2019s vacancy challenges to be unique to Chicago \u2014 most major urban retail corridors have been through a period of adjustment since the pandemic,\u201d Schutter said. \u201cTypical of the Midwest\u2019s conservative nature, it\u2019s just a slower return to normalcy, but it is a return. We\u2019re seeing entertainment and experiential concepts increasingly filling spaces on the Avenue, and pricing has adjusted as property values have receded somewhat from pre-Covid highs.\u201d\nThe broader picture in downtown Chicago is one of slow but measurable recovery. Shopping strips such as\nArmitage Avenue\nand the Southport Corridor are practically bursting at the seams, nearing fully occupied. Office-to-residential conversions are getting city support, tourism is rebounding and developers are repositioning older assets. The commercial core is no longer in freefall, despite political talking points that say otherwise.\nProperty values remain below their pre-pandemic highs, but the fact they\u2019re starting to trade hands, even at depressed prices such as\nKetu Amin\u2019s recently struck $72 million purchase\nfor a Westin on the Mag Mile, is a sign of the market functioning the way it\u2019s supposed to when in need of a reset.\nTrump\u2019s misfire may score him clicks, but real estate insiders watching the Mag Mile know better: the market\u2019s showing signs of life.\n",

Newmark\u2019s Elizabeth Gagliardi, Susan Lawson and Chuck Johanns are marketing the property, which also includes 19,000 square feet of ground-floor retail.\nIt\u2019s unclear what\nLG\nspent developing the property or how much it hopes to fetch in a sale.\nThe move comes weeks after LG put another of its recent projects \u2014 the\nArthur on Aberdeen\nin Fulton Market \u2014 on the block.\nThe listings arrive as downtown landlords ride a surge in rent growth driven by limited new supply. The Class A apartment market posted a 6.3 percent year-over-year rent increase in the third quarter, hitting an average of $3,228 a month, according to Luxury Living. River North led the charge, with rents jumping 13 percent to $3,738.\nCompleted in 2023, the Hugo is roughly 96 percent leased, according to CoStar.\nAvailable one-bedroom units are listed around $2,550 a month, while two-bedrooms are approaching $4,000. The project gave\nLG\na foothold in one of Chicago\u2019s strongest rental submarkets, where proximity to the tech corridor and a spate of restaurant and retail openings have kept demand high.\nRecords show the firm paid $14.2 million for the site in 2019 and secured a $75 million construction loan in 2021. The deal could test investor appetite for stabilized downtown assets.\nThe listing could also be part of a broader capital recycling strategy as LG evaluates timing in a still-favorable rent environment. With construction starts at their lowest level in nearly 30 years, strong fundamentals may give sellers like LG a narrow window to lock in returns before the next development wave hits.\nLG is still investing in construction in\nFulton Market\n, including a five-story, 66-unit residential building at 1201-19 West Kinzie Street.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The structures are valued at a total of $80 million.\nTwo other buildings, a 188,434-square-foot Building A and a 476,000-square-foot Building D, will be developed as market demand increases. Once that part joins Phase I, the entire development will consist of more than 1 million square feet of Class A\nindustrial\nspace.\nBrinkmann Constructors serves as the general contractor for I-10 International Phase I. Butler Design Group and Ware Malcomb handled the project\u2019s design. Jesse Blum of PICOR/Cushman &amp; Wakefield is the exclusive leasing broker.\nThe development is in a\nForeign Trade Zone\nnear the critical arteries of Interstates 10 and 19 and Tucson International Airport, the second-busiest airport in the state. The buildings at I-10 International Phase I boast unique amenities designed to attract and retain a new wave of employees, including an outdoor amenity space with shaded and landscaped areas, built-in barbecue equipment and seating for outdoor relaxing, dining and games.\nLincoln hopes the project\u2019s \u201cnext-gen features and people-first approach\u201d will attract tenants and their workers to the new space in the coming months, Lincoln senior vice president John Orsak said.\nWhile Phoenix has traditionally been the logistics hub in Arizona, some developers have looked to the Tucson area as land costs and congestion in Phoenix increase. E-commerce companies like Amazon and FedEx are already operating in the Tucson area. Lincoln\u2019s I-10 International project is the latest in a string of speculative build-outs anticipated to bring in tenants looking to set up operations in the Grand Canyon State while avoiding the pricier Phoenix market.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",
