        "content": "The Chraibi brothers scored rezoning approval this week for a complex with 224 townhomes in Miami Gardens.\nBluenest Development\n, led by Salim and Kamil Chraibi, is under contract to buy the 21-acre site for about $14 million, with the deal expected to close by year\u2019s end, according to sources familiar with the matter.\nThe Chraibis declined to comment on the price for the land at 20700 Northwest 42nd Avenue. Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s Scott O\u2019Donnell, who marketed the site on behalf of the seller, an affiliate of media company iHeart Media, also declined to disclose the price.\nThe majority of homes will be sold at market-rate rents, a deviation from Bluenest\u2019s traditional focus on developing workforce housing. The project will have some workforce townhomes for city employees, though the exact number is yet to be determined, Salim and Kamil Chraibi said.\nBluenest generally caps prices for its workforce homes at $451,000.\nDesigned by Pascual, Perez, Kiliddjian, Starr &amp; Associates, the complex will consist of primarily three-bedroom townhomes averaging at about 1,900 square feet, though Bluenest is considering including some four-bedroom homes spanning from 2,000 square feet to 2,200 square feet, according to the Chraibis.\nThe complex would have six buildings with three townhomes, 13 buildings with four townhomes, 20 buildings with five townhomes and nine buildings with six townhomes.\nThe project still needs site plan approval, which will be done administratively, Kamil Chraibi said.\nConstruction is expected to start in the summer or fall of next year and be completed by the end of 2028, the brothers said.\nSalim founded Bluenest in 2018, and younger brother Kamil joined about a year later. The firm has become a powerhouse in workforce housing development in\nsouth Miami-Dade\n.\nThe brothers started out building individual homes across the county and carved out their niche by seizing on South Florida\u2019s\naffordability crisi\ns and plentiful land supply in the\nsouth county area\n, the last frontier for housing construction in otherwise land-constrained Miami-Dade.\nBluenest\nhas completed 1,000 homes and has roughly 3,000 in various stages of approval and development, the Chraibis have said. The majority of homes are in South Dade, where Bluenest is one of the largest non-institutional workforce housing developers.\nIts planned projects include the 90-acre Krome, with roughly 500 townhomes and 76 large single-family homes lining the perimeter of the property and about 10 acres of commercial space, including a grocery store, in south Miami-Dade. Also in south Dade, Bluenest plans K Legacy with 57 townhomes on a 4-acre lot in Princeton.\nMiami Gardens, a city in northwest Miami-Dade, has caught developers\u2019 eyes in recent years. Cymbal DLT, led by Asi Cymbal and Hector Torres, completed the 341-unit\nLaguna Gardens\napartment complex last year at 20775 Northwest 17th Avenue. It retroactively converted it to workforce rentals, allowing it to tap into the\nLive Local Act\u2019s tax breaks\nfor below-market rentals.\nFlorida Memorial University, a historically Black university, and Redwood Dev Co have partnered on a 52.6-acre project in Miami Gardens, with the\n$500 million-plus\nfirst phase consisting of a pair of eight-story buildings with 500 student beds, 500 workforce units, and basketball courts, a turf field and academic facilities.\n",

        "content": "Miami commissioners granted two developers free land and up to $8 million in forgivable city loans for the construction of affordable and workforce housing rental projects in\nLittle Havana\n.\nThe vote in favor of the sweeteners came amid rising criticism against the city and other South Florida governments for catering to developers by awarding them perks, including land for allegedly below-market rate prices.\nPublic officials have countered that some of these carrots are a way to incentivize the construction of affordable and workforce rentals, a housing type that\u2019s acutely needed in South Florida, where many residents are\ncost burdened\n.\nIn the Little Havana deals, Miami will transfer the half-acre-plus site at 1340 Southwest Eighth Street and 825 Southwest 13th Court to N.R. Investments, which plans an 11-story mixed-income building with about 114 apartments under the\nLive Local Act\n.\nThe city also will transfer a 0.6-acre site at 1251 Southwest Seventh Street to Mabruk USA, which wants to build a 12-story building with 105 units, according to documents attached to the commission agenda. Miami will grant up to $4 million in loans to each developer.\nCity commissioners approved the land transfers and loans at their meeting on Thursday without discussion.\nThe loan to N.R. Investments will come from the city\u2019s District 3 capital reserve and affordable housing public benefits fund, and affordable housing and/or rental assistance program funds tapped from the city\u2019s MiamiCoin cryptocurrency\u200b, the agenda documents say. (Miami\u2019s District 3 includes Little Havana.)\nMabruk USA\u2019s loan will come from the HOME Investment Partnership Funds, which are allocated from the federal government.\nFor N.R. Investments\u2019 project, the city will purchase the development site for $5.9 million and transfer it to the developer, according to the South Florida Business Journal.\nThe lot at 1340 Southwest Eighth Street, home to a retail plaza, is owned by Lopez Optical; and the one at 825 Southwest 13th Court, home to a two-story office building, is owned by Ray Optical, records show.\nMiami-based\nN.R. Investments\n\u2013\u2013 led by Ron Gottesmann and\nNir Shoshani\n\u2013\u2013 proposes about 41 studios, 52 one-bedroom apartments and 21 two-bedroom apartments, about 7,000 square feet of ground-floor retail and a three-story, 90-space garage, the firm told the city in an October letter.\nAbout 80 of the apartments will be at below-market rents, designated for households earning 60, 100 and 120 percent of the area median income.\nMiami-Dade\u2019s annual AMI is $87,200, according to the Florida Housing Finance Corporation, though it\u2019s expected to be updated in the spring.\nMiami owns the vacant development site it plans to transfer to Mabruk USA. The firm, led by Nuri Dorra and Dr. Ingrid E. Dorra of North Miami Beach, proposes a project with 30 one-bedroom apartments and 75 two-bedroom apartments, ground-floor retail and a four-story garage, agenda documents show.\nAll units in the building will be at below-market rents, targeting households earning up to 80 percent of the AMI.\nThe city\u2019s approval comes with a caveat that if the developers fail to build, the properties will revert back to the city.\nThose items sailed through at the Thursday commission meeting, but a Watson Island deal was the subject of criticism.\nThe city\napproved the sale\nof 3.2 acres on Watson Island to BH3 and Merrimac Ventures for $29 million. At issue: An appraisal determined the land could be worth between $257 million and $342 million, according to the Miami Herald.\nMiami-Dade County has a\nrecord\nof giving away land it deems as \u201csurplus\u201d for below-market value in no-bid sales or leases to developers. The deals are sanctioned under a county rule that allows a commissioner to back a developer\u2019s proposal as long as the project is planned for a site the county has deemed as underutilized.\n",

Prudential Financial issued a $42.9 million acquisition loan to Space Investment for the purchase, and Eastdil Secured brokered the transaction on behalf of both parties.\nTopanga Gateway\u2019s location, high occupancy rate and tenant sales performance at the shopping center were factors in Space Investment\u2019s move to buy the development, firm co-founder Ryan Gallagher told Commercial Property Executive. It was 97 percent occupied at the time of sale with occupants like Ralphs, The Container Store and Petco as well as anchor tenant Sprouts Farmers Market. The mall, consisting of four single-story buildings on an 8-acre site, completed a renovation last year.\nIn July, Space Investment\nbought the Fullerton Metrocenter\nmall in Fullerton for $118.5 million. Seller Kite Realty Group bought the 395,703-square-foot retail property in 2021 for $103 million. A month prior, Space Investment trimmed its Orange County portfolio with the sale of the 39,300-square-foot Westport Plaza &amp; Square in Costa Mesa to Asana Partners for $25.7 million, up from the\n$18.4 million\nSpace Investment acquired it for in 2019.\nInvestor confidence in local retail\nis growing.\nIn the first 11 months of the year, the Los Angeles regional retail market saw nearly $1.5 billion in investment sales of 52 assets. Investment volume in the area in the same period in 2024 amounted to $816 million for 44 properties. The largest property to sell this year is\nLakewood Center\nin Lakewood, with Macerich offloading the 2-million-square-foot mall to Pacific Retail Capital Partners, Lyon Living and Silverpeak for $332.1 million.

        "content": "A deal between two Chicago-based firms likely marks the first large-scale multifamily sale under the city\u2019s new\ncontroversial right of first refusal ordinance\n.\nCRG sold the 134-unit AM1980 Apartments in Logan Square to CedarSt this week in a transaction that CRG\u2019s Tom Shanabruch called a \u201cfrustrating process,\u201d due to Chicago\u2019s new set of constraints on sales under the Northwest Side Housing Preservation Ordinance.\n\u201cBeing the guinea pig in the process for this large-scale sale was interesting and sometimes a frustrating process, but we got through it,\u201d said Shanabruch, CRG\u2019s vice president of investments and capital markets.\nThough he declined to disclose a sale price, it likely fell between $30 million to $40 million because a prior sale of the property that ultimately fell through was set to close at $38 million.\nThe purchase was an opportunity to \u201cacquire one of Chicago\u2019s top multifamily assets in a supply-constrained market,\u201d CedarSt CEO Will Murphy said in a press statement.\nCedarSt is rebranding the property as The Weyland.\nThe Northwest Side Housing Preservation Ordinance, passed by the city council in late 2024, created a pilot area in parts of Logan Square, Avondale, Hermosa, Humboldt Park, West Town and Pilsen. In it, tenants are given the right of first refusal if a landlord sells a building, and existing demolition fees are increased for developers seeking to replace multiunit buildings with single-family homes.\nThe program was designed to protect tenants in gentrifying areas, especially neighborhoods like Bucktown or Logan Square. The area lost 6 percent of its two-flat to six-flat buildings between 2013 and 2018, according to the DePaul Institute for Housing Studies.\nBut after an\noutcry from longtime property owners\n, the city council later\nvoted to remove\nparts of the 31st and 36th wards from the pilot area.\nThe AM1980 Apartments, at 1980 North Milwaukee Avenue, were still subject to the new regulations.\nCRG developed the 7-story building with ground floor retail with the help of a construction loan of more than $23 million from Iowa-based Principal Life Insurance, originated in 2017, public records show. CRG retired the construction debt in 2021, replacing it with a new $24 million mortgage loan, also from Principal.\nThe firm signed off on maturity date extensions with the lender twice in the years since then, first to buy another year until April 2025, and again a few months ago to push the due date to April 2026, public records show.\nBut offloading the property was not a simple process. CRG listed it before the right of first refusal ordinance passed, but did not close a deal before it took effect.\nTo get the deal with CedarSt across the finish line, Shanabruch said CRG worked with attorney Kate Duncan at Quarles &amp; Brady to ensure the sale process complied with city regulations. Proving that tenants had been notified of the sale and given the opportunity to form a tenant\u2019s union was no simple task, he said.\nCRG sent certified mail to tenants of all 134 apartments notifying them that the building was being sold, which was an expensive process, he said. But getting a response proved even more difficult.\n\u201cWe had to get a certain percentage of them to agree that they weren\u2019t going to form a tenant union, and they did not want to purchase the building,\u201d Shanabruch said. \u201cBut we did not get enough written responses from them. So we ended up sending it via Docusign, and it really took a persistent DocuSign effort to get the signatures we needed.\u201d\nShanabruch credits CedarSt\u2019s understanding of the local market for the ultimate success of the sale.\n\u201cThey were fully understanding of the ordinance because they\u2019re in the neighborhood already,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bottom line is patience is required.\u201d\nInitially another Chicago-based firm, Bradford Allen, put in a $38 million offer on the property in November 2024. But\nthat deal fell through and wound up in court.\nRepresentatives of Bradford filed a lawsuit against CRG in July, after Bradford pulled out of the deal in March. Bradford claimed that the CRG affiliate that owned the property misrepresented its operating expenses, as well as lease terms. After the deal fell through, Bradford sued to retrieve $1.9 million it deposited into escrow.\nBut CRG so far has stood firm that it has the right to keep the money, alleging Bradford Allen didn\u2019t live up to its contractual obligations as part of the sale of the property, court filings show.\nBradford also noted in court filings that the right of first refusal ordinance played a role in the deal going south because it added another complicating factor to the process, legal records show. The case is still pending in Cook County Circuit Court.\nShanabruch declined to comment on the litigation.",

The development, dubbed Platform Moffett Park, will have 294,000 square feet of office and research space, 800 parking stalls, a shuttle bus stop and 43,000 square feet of private open space.\nThe developer said it expects to spend six to 12 months securing building permits and another two years on construction.\nThe firm furthered its push into Sunnyvale earlier this year with the purchase of Mathilda Tech Park. It acquired two buildings at 755 North Mathilda Avenue and 680 Vaqueros Avenue spanning 105,000 square feet across 5 acres. Iowa Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System sold the property for an undisclosed amount, but the Santa Clara County Clerk Recorder registered the sale at $15.5 million, the outlet\nreported\n.\nElsewhere in the South Bay, in August, Ellis Partners bought the three-building\nCampus at Scott office park\nin Santa Clara. In that deal, Ellis teamed up with Boston-based Baupost Group to buy the offices, which are largely occupied by\nApplied Materials\n, for an undisclosed price.\nSunnyvale\u2019s office market has a higher occupancy rate than other Silicon Valley cities, though its vacancy rate is still up from its pre-pandemic single-digit vacancy rate.\nSunnyvale\u2019s vacancy rate was 14.9 percent in the third quarter, below the wider Silicon Valley figure of 16.6 percent,\nper\nCBRE.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "When Mark Nussbaum\u2019s law firm collapsed last year, it left clients scrambling to recoup missing escrow funds \u2013 and wondering where their money had gone.\nA newly filed lawsuit now points to a dead Brooklyn real estate investor as the alleged linchpin of a sprawling scheme in which hundreds of millions of dollars were siphoned from client escrow accounts.\nThe lawsuit, filed by the lawyer handling the liquidation of Nussbaum\u2019s former law firms, seeks to recover about $330 million from two entities formerly tied to the late Borough Park-based real estate investor Mendel Steiner. It alleges that Steiner ran a \u201cponzi scheme\u201d through Nussbaum Lowinger\u2019s escrow accounts to funnel client funds \u2013 a practice that the filings suggest led to the firm\u2019s demise.\nNussbaum Lowinger abruptly shuttered in January. Months later, the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office charged Mark Nussbaum with grand larceny for stealing $15 million from client escrow funds. Nussbaum has pleaded not guilty.\nThe lawsuit alleges that Steiner lured Nussbaum Lowinger clients and prospective clients into two investment schemes which escrow funds were supposedly used to \u201cshow capital\u201d for real estate deals, and another involving fabricated joint ventures tied to property acquisitions.\nSteiner\u2019s estate has not responded to the lawsuit and could not be reached for comment.\nIn a statement, Nussbaum\u2019s attorney said \u201cMr. Nussbaum fully supports the assignee\u2019s efforts to marshal assets from bona fide sources, including the Steiner estate, and he will continue to assist the assignee to the best of his ability to ensure maximum recovery for the creditors.\u201d\nScheme 1: \u201cShow capital\u201d\nUnder the first alleged scheme, Steiner pitched Nussbaum Lowinger clients on what he described as a risk-free way to earn higher monthly returns.\nClients were told to deposit millions of dollars into the firm\u2019s escrow accounts, where the money would remain untouched and be used only to \u201cshow capital\u201d to potential property sellers as proof Steiner could close a deal.\nBut the lawsuit alleges that those promises were false.\nInstead of sitting safely in escrow, the funds were transferred to Steiner-controlled entities, including Real Green Management or Aven Realty.\nTo obscure Steiner\u2019s role, Nussbaum also allegedly replaced Steiner\u2019s name in transaction documents with a purported \u201claw firm client\u201d for whom Steiner supposedly acted as an intermediary. In some cases, the lawsuit claims, that client didn\u2019t exist, or the individual was not involved in the transaction.\nSteiner would pay some of the higher returns early on to build investor confidence, the lawsuit alleges.\nScheme 2: Phantom joint ventures\nIn a second scheme, Steiner allegedly convinced clients to invest in joint ventures on property acquisitions.\nSteiner provided Nussbaum Lowinger clients a description of the property he claimed to be buying and the name of the seller. Client money was supposed to fund deposits or acquisitions and remain in escrow until closing. Steiner allegedly promised investors a fixed return plus equity in the deal. He also allegedly told clients that he had an arrangement with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development allowing him to purchase multifamily projects at auction.\nThe lawsuit alleges the deals were fabricated.\nIn some instances, the sellers did not own the properties. In others, no sales agreement existed at all. And Steiner never had an arrangement with HUD.\nInstead, Steiner allegedly used the fake transactions as another way to convince clients to put money in the Nussbaum Lowinger escrow accounts, ultimately to be transferred to Steiner\u2019s accounts, Real Green or Aven Realty.\n\u201cIn order to induce the clients to make the investments, Mendel Steiner and MJN [Mark J. Nussbaum] prepared fraudulent contracts, emails and other documents containing fictitious names and other false information,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.\nMoney transfers\nThe lawsuit sheds light on how much money was moving into Nussbaum\u2019s accounts. Eight Nussbaum Lowinger clients wired a combined $380 million to the escrow account between 2022 and 2025.\nBut Steiner\u2019s companies returned only $51.6 million to clients.\nThe lawsuit was filed as part of an alternative to bankruptcy process known as an assignment for the benefit of creditors. The lawyer handling the process, known as an assignee, is seeking to recover money to pay back creditors of Nussbaum Lowinger.\nSteiner, who died by suicide in January in a Manhattan hotel, is the largest debtor to Nussbaum\u2019s estate.\nNussbaum used his law firm as a pass-through to make bridge loans to real estate dealmakers, but many of those loans have not been paid back.\nThe lawsuit also does not provide any details about where Steiner transferred the funds after it went into his accounts. Steiner\u2019s properties have faced foreclosures and requests for receivers to be appointed, further raising questions about the value of his estate.\n",

        "content": "The MTA is taking offers for more than 300,000 square feet of development rights in Lower Manhattan.\nThe agency released a request for proposals Friday, seeking a buyer of up to 350,000 square feet of landmarked air rights tied to the Fulton Center.\nThe transit center shares a zoning lot with the Corbin Building, a terra cotta-clad office building built in 1889, which was\nlandmarked\nin 2015. Together, the two buildings are underbuilt on the lot by 358,000 square feet, of which the agency is keeping 8,000 for \u201cfuture flexibility,\u201d according to the RFP.\nThe potential pool of buyers will be limited to those who can acquire the rights through a City Planning Commission certification or through a zoning lot merger with an adjacent site. The RFP specifies that it will not accept offers from buyers whose plans would require a special permit or other land-use approval.\nMore potential buyers, however, are eligible thanks to the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity. The text amendment eased the rules around where landmarked air rights can be transferred and freed many of these deals from the special permit process. Because of those changes, the square footage can be applied to sites across the street and within the same block of the Fulton Center, without triggering the need for a special permit, as long as such a deal doesn\u2019t increase the allowable square footage of the receiving site by more than 30 percent.\nTransfers resulting in larger projects still require a special permit and, therefore, must go through the city\u2019s land-use review process.\nAir rights transfers have been on the rise since the passage of City of Yes.\nThe Real Deal\npreviously\nreported\nthat landmarked development rights have been trading for between $180 and 400 per square foot.\nBidders on the Fulton air rights must offer at least fair market value (as determined by the MTA\u2019s independent appraiser) to be considered. The RFP is due March 16, 2026.\n",

The seller was a trust tied to\nDaniel Grollo\n, an Australian real estate developer, that had upped the mortgage on the units to $18.9 million in 2016. The trust purchased two units in 2013 for $14.3 million, then purchased the remaining three over the next several years.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nIn Brooklyn Heights, a trust sold a townhouse at\n19 Cranberry Street\nfor $11 million. The buyer was an LLC managed by\nMichael Saltzman.\nThe trust had owned the home since 2022, purchasing it for $12.3 million. The five-bedroom home spans roughly 5,600 square feet and dates to 1829.\nAdam Modlin\nwith the Modlin Group and Corcoran\u2019s\nKaren Talbott, Kyle Talbott\nand\nScott Sternberg\nhad the listing. The transaction works out to just under $2,000 per square foot.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Jeremy Hoon\npaid $7.3 million for a townhouse at\n537 Pacific Street\nin Boerum Hill. The 5,700-square-foot home, which has 1,300 square feet of exterior space, is part of a two-townhouse and a condo complex developed by\nSterling Town Equities.\nThe five-bedroom residence first hit the market in 2023 with an asking price of just under $11 million.

        "content": "Access agreements are the bane of many New Yorkers trying to renovate a home.\nThese sign-offs are almost unavoidable in a city where buildings sit shoulder-to-shoulder and most apartments share walls, floors and ceilings. Both routine upgrades and ground-up construction often require workers to temporarily intrude on a neighbor\u2019s property.\nBut getting permission can be a tall order. A reluctant neighbor can send owners into months of back-and-forth. If the dispute lands in court, and many of them do, coming to a resolution can delay projects even further.\nJust last month, a trust tied to comedy writer Jill Davis and former Bain Capital managing partner Edward Conrad\nsued their neighbors\n, Sotheby\u2019s CEO Charles Stewart and his wife Catarina, over the couple\u2019s renovation of their Upper East Side townhouse. The lawsuit alleges that the parties spent years negotiating an access agreement, and that even once one was in place, the couple didn\u2019t comply with the terms.\nTo cut down on the headaches, lawmakers in Albany\nproposed legislation\naimed at establishing guidelines for the agreements and streamlining the process. Gov. Kathy Hochul signed the bill into law last week.\nThe new law only kicks in when the quest for an access agreement ends up in court. Instead of allowing judges full discretion over the terms, it outlines some standards, including requiring those seeking the agreement to ensure their neighbors have access to their insurance policies if their properties sustain any damages.\nThe statute also establishes some guardrails around the amount of compensation adjoining property owners can demand \u2014 a piece of the puzzle that often becomes contentious. The law states that while neighbors are entitled to compensation, it should be reasonable.\nStill, the law isn\u2019t exactly a catch-all fix for the strife created by obtaining these agreements, though supporters say the existence of a standard at all could encourage some parties to settle disputes out of court.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: The Durst Organization is\nlooking for a buyer\nfor two of its Theater District buildings, one of which houses Jimmy\u2019s Corner, a beloved dive bar founded by the late boxer, Jimmy Glenn. A listing for the properties at 136-140 West 44th Street bills the site as a \u201cprime development\u201d opportunity \u2014 what could replace the Midtown institution? Send thoughts to\nsheridan.wall@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nMoMA PS1, the Long Island City-based affiliate of the Museum of Modern Art, will be free for the public starting in January. The museum\u2019s latest admission numbers estimate about 200,000 people visit each year.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 A new study from Cornell University researchers found that air pollution has decreased in Manhattan since congestion pricing took effect in January,\nGothamist\nreported. Before the implementation of the controversial policy, the borough\u2019s air contained about 14 micrograms of fine particulate matter. That measure has fallen to 11.\n\u2014 The Department of Transportation threatened to cancel $73 million in federal funding for highways in New York if the state continued to allow international drivers to obtain trucking licenses,\nABC News 10\nreported. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the agency\u2019s warning came after a review found a large number of licenses issued illegally.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$10.4 million\nfor 200 Amsterdam Avenue, 32B. The Upper West Side condo is 2,700 square feet and last sold in 2021 for $9.2 million.\nBrown Harris Stevens\nLisa Lippman has the transaction.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$4.37 million\nfor an apartment building at 1643 Popham Avenue. The Morris Heights building has nine units, is four stories and 7,400 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $23.5 million for 432 Park Avenue, Unit 69B. The Midtown East condo is 4,000 square feet.\nSerhant\nhas the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 276,985-square-foot, 21-story building with 350 units at 743 East 12th Street in the East Village.

Other notable debtors include Boruch Drillman ($4.7 million), Eli Puretz ($4.1 million) and Shaya Prager ($1.1 million).\nNussbaum\u2019s assets primarily consist of his accounts receivable, real estate interests, $2 million in cryptocurrency and $91,000 in wine/alcohol, which someone in his situation could understandably need these days.\nIn another case, Mendel Deutsch of Toms River, New Jersey,\npleaded guilty\nto one count of bank and wire fraud conspiracy and one count of wire fraud for his role in a brazen commercial mortgage fraud scheme in Brooklyn.\nDeutsch pleaded guilty last month, a few weeks after one of his co-conspirators, Joshua Feldberger of the title insurer Universal Abstract, pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud conspiracy.\nDeutsche faces a maximum sentence of up to 50 years and a maximum fine of $1.25 million, although he will likely be sentenced to a less harsh punishment.\nIn politics, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani\nmet with real estate developers\n, lenders and investors to discuss the housing crisis, reassuring them he is open to their feedback and collaboration after big names in the industry fought against his campaign.\nMamdani acknowledged the \u201cvery important\u201d role the private market plays in housing construction, but still reaffirmed his commitment to freezing rents for stabilized tenants and support for an overhaul of the city\u2019s property tax system.\nOther key topics on the agenda included the importance of slashing the time it takes to lease up affordable housing units and the need to fund renovations for rent-stabilized apartments that are being kept off the market.\nIn commercial real estate news, David Werner is buying another property at a bargain basement price.\nThe investor is\nin contract\nto purchase the 50-story One Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld Plaza tower for $270 million, a deal expected to close early next year.

        "content": "Los Angeles County\u2019s\n$200 million purchase\nof the Gas Company Tower last year as a new home for government offices is coming under fire after critics claim the county inflated what it would have cost to stay in its old digs to justify the tower purchase and potentially set up the historic building for demolition.\nAt the time of the purchase, the county said it would have cost $700 million for\nseismic retrofitting\nat the Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration, which houses the\nLos Angeles County\nBoard of Supervisors and the offices of several county departments. It turns out that figure is more than half a billion dollars higher than the cost of a typical retrofit for a building of that size, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\nA recent analysis by experts cited by the Times estimates that the Hahn building could be brought up to code for less than $150 million using common techniques applied in retrofitting other historic Los Angeles structures. Dan Rosenfeld, a developer and preservationist who is leading a campaign to halt what some see as a quiet setup for the Hahn Hall\u2019s eventual demolition, told the Times that the $700 million estimate relied on one of the most expensive methods of earthquake retrofitting.\nOfficials \u201cdidn\u2019t just put their thumb on the scale\u201d to show retrofitting was too costly and that buying the\nGas Company Tower\nwas the best option, Rosenfeld said. \u201cThey jumped on it with both feet.\u201d\nIn response, Joseph Nicchitta, acting chief executive of Los Angeles County, said \u201cthe county considered a comprehensive range of seismic options\u201d besides the most expensive ones, claiming the $700 million estimate was \u201cthe result of a competitively procured process.\u201d County officials \u201cconferred with the Department of Public Works on the various approaches [for retrofitting]\u201d that critics like Rosenfeld suggested, but the department \u201cmaintains its assessments regarding the cost, scope and budget of the retrofit project.\u201d\nLos Angeles County says there are no current plans to demolish the Hahn Hall, though L.A. County supervisor Janice Hahn \u2014 the daughter of the building\u2019s namesake \u2014 confirmed that razing much of the structure has been suggested in multiple staff meetings.\n\u201cWe are convinced that any outside, independent review would arrive at the same conclusions that we did: The building can and should be saved,\u201d Rosenfeld said. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want to move from the third floor to the 50th floor of the best building in town? But who benefits? Not the public.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Ed Okpa, head of real estate consultancy Okpa Company, is challenging the Dallas City Planning Commission\u2019s rejection of his rezoning request for Winners Tower, a proposed high\u2011rise in South Dallas.\nThe commission\nvoted against the proposal\nin October, citing concerns about potential displacement, the\nDallas Business Journal\nreported. Okpa has since filed an appeal that will send the project directly to the Dallas City Council, which could vote on it as early as January and has the authority to override the commission with a simple majority.\nThe current project plan includes a 150 to 160\u2011room hotel and 60 to 65 condos on a site that now houses a pharmacy, event center, offices and the Winners Assembly Christian Church.\nThe church is the property owner, with Okpa functioning as development adviser.\nCity staff previously recommended rezoning the site for buildings up to five stories, far below Okpa\u2019s original 25\u2011story vision. He argued that South Dallas has long been overlooked and that a signature tower could help the area compete with more affluent parts of the city.\nWhile Okpa, who ran unsuccessfully for Dallas mayor in 2003, disputes claims of displacement of residents \u2014 emphasizing that no additional land acquisition is planned \u2014 he has indicated a willingness to scale the project down to roughly 20 stories.\nEconomic impact studies commissioned by the developer estimate the project would cost $240 million, create about 200 jobs, and generate roughly $9 million in annual tax revenue. Okpa has pledged to allocate $90 million in construction spending to minority\u2011owned firms. He also told commissioners that C\u2011PACE financing could cover about $70 million of the cost, supported by the tower\u2019s planned solar\u2011energy components.\nOkpa insists on condos rather than rental housing to promote long\u2011term ownership and stability. He also argued that South Dallas lacks quality hotels, despite its proximity to Fair Park, a major regional events hub, he told the Business Journal.\nHe believes skepticism from commissioners stems partly from doubts about financing, and partly from bias related to his Nigerian background and\nimmigrant business partners\n, according to the Business Journal. Other minority entrepreneurs who have projects in the South Dallas market include Terrence Maiden\u2019s\nRussell Glen Company\nand Rev. T.D. Jakes\u2019\nnamesake firm,\nReverend T.D. Jakes Real Estate Ventures.\nMeanwhile, alternative visions for the site exist: Pastor Austin Anetekhai of Winners Assembly has floated an affordable housing tower with five to 13 stories.\nSouth Dallas has seen limited high\u2011rise development. The only comparable tower to Okpa\u2019s project is the 13\u2011story Park Manor, built in 1970, according to the Business Journal.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

        "content": "As the Alexander brothers\u2019\nsex trafficking trial\napproaches next month, details about the proceedings are beginning to take shape.\nSeveral of the alleged victims will be allowed to testify under pseudonyms at trial, Judge Valerie Caproni of the Southern District of New York ruled at a Thursday hearing.\nThe women are among other accusers tapped by prosecutors to share their experiences with one or more of the brothers, who are facing charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking, among other crimes. Former top brokers Tal and Oren Alexander, along with their brother Alon, were arrested in Miami last December.\nDuring the hearing, Caproni sided with prosecutors, who requested the court protect the identities of 17 alleged victims whose names have not yet been made public through litigation filed against one or more of the brothers.\nOren\u2019s attorney, Marc Agnifilo\n, pushed back against the use of pseudonyms, arguing that introducing too many fake names would confuse jurors and other witnesses, and block those outside of the courtroom from coming forward with potentially significant information about the alleged victims that could aid the defense.\n\u201cWhat the government is asking here is truly unprecedented,\u201d Agnifilo said.\nAgnifilo referred to a saying among toxicologists, \u201cthe dose makes the poison.\u201d He added, \u201cThe dose here is tremendous.\u201d\nThough Caproni largely agreed with the government\u2019s position, her decision came with a few caveats. Women with common names will take the stand using their real first names and a pseudonymous last name, while women who were minors at the time of the alleged attacks and those with easily recognizable first names will be allowed to use a pseudonym for both their first and last names.\nThough their identities will be shielded from the public, defense attorneys for the brothers know the real names of the alleged victims. The court will also inform the jury and any attendees of the trial that the alleged victims called to the stand are testifying under fake names.\nAgnifilo said that the defense would prefer the victims use their real first names only if the court was inclined to grant prosecutors\u2019 request. But Caproni shot down his appeal, arguing that it would be \u201cdemeaning and infantilizing\u201d to refer to alleged rape victims by their first name while other witnesses are called by their last name.\nAll three of the Alexanders have pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\u201cThis case is being framed by the government as a sex-trafficking prosecution despite the absence of evidence of force or coercion, and the defense maintains that the government\u2019s theory relies on recharacterizing consensual conduct as criminal activity,\u201d a spokesperson for the brothers wrote in a statement. \u201cThose issues, the defense expects, will be tested at trial.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear how many alleged victims prosecutors plan to introduce during the trial, though based on discussions in court, it appears they\u2019re working with more than 20. The latest version of the indictment, which was\nfiled last month\n, noted seven victims associated with substantive counts, while in a hearing shortly after, prosecutors mentioned another 17 alleged victims associated with the conspiracy charge.\nCaproni previously said that while she won\u2019t limit the number of victims prosecutors can call to the stand ahead of trial, she will not allow the entirety of its roster to testify in support of the conspiracy.\nAt another hearing last week, Caproni\nagreed to delay\nthe trial from Jan. 5 to Jan. 26. By the time proceedings begin next year, the Alexander brothers, who are being held at Brooklyn\u2019s Metropolitan Detention Center, will have been in custody for more than a year.\nNot so fast\u2026\nCould 2026 be the year interest rates lose their rep as residential real estate\u2019s boogeyman?\nEarlier this week, the Federal Reserve\nvoted to cut\ninterest rates by a quarter of a point, marking the third such move this year. While not directly tied to the federal funds rate, the central bank\u2019s decision often influences fluctuations in mortgage rates, which have remained elevated over the past few years.\nThough mortgage rates dropped in anticipation of the Fed\u2019s announcement, they\u2019re still above 6 percent, significantly higher than the historically low rates many homeowners secured during the pandemic. That discrepancy created a \u201clock-in\u201d effect, where owners who may have already sold their homes by now are staying put to hold on to their mortgages.\nIf the last year is any indication, it appears mortgage rates will hover around 6 percent for the foreseeable future. It\u2019s likely that for many sellers, time will start to outweigh a favorable rate, so in the absence of any drastic macroeconomic changes, we can finally put the hand-wringing over rates to bed.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe most expensive deal to hit the city rolls this week was a condo at Extell Development\u2019s 50 West 66th Street. The apartment traded for $22.7 million, or $6,700 per square foot, to an anonymous entity known as Little Tiger Love. Unit 43N spans 3,400 square feet and has four bedrooms and four bathrooms.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Janice Chang and Timothy Hsu had the listing.\n",

        "content": "Ever wonder why city workers are not answering your calls, returning your emails or processing your applications?\nThey might be working on one of the hundreds of meaningless reports required by city laws. There\u2019s even a law requiring the city to report how many reports are required. As of 2019, according to a 57-page analysis,\nthere were 842\n.\nThe City Council is trying hard to get to 1,000. Last week, by overriding Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 vetoes, it added another, and compounded the error by forcing businesses as well to file annual reports that will accomplish absolutely nothing.\nUnder Intro\n982-A\n, employers with more than 200 employees in the city must now submit annual pay data reports broken down by race or ethnicity and also by sex.\nA second law,\n984-A\n, requires the city to turn these reports into an analysis to identify disparities by industry. This must be done every single year, even though the numbers barely change from one year to the next.\nMike Bloomberg liked to say, \u201cYou can\u2019t fix what you can\u2019t measure.\u201d But wage disparities have been measured a thousand times. All the studies show that men make more than women and white people make more than people of color.\nBut few show why. And these two new laws are no different.\nLike most of the others, the city study required by 984-A will not show how much of the disparities stems from racism or sexism and how much is attributable to other factors, including employees\u2019 job responsibilities, hours, experience, seniority, commissions, etc.\nAs a result, it will be totally useless, except for grandstanding purposes.\nWe\u2019ve all heard the statistic that\nwomen earn 82 cents\nfor every dollar that men make. Twenty years earlier, in 2002, it was 80 cents. It barely changed because the discrepancy is caused by factors that are not affected by publicizing it.\nPoliticians like to chalk up the male-female pay gap to sexism, but economists have figured out that\nchoices by women\n\u2014 usually related to child care and working in lower-paying fields, such as teaching \u2014 are the primary reason. Discrimination is a factor, but it\u2019s small.\nReality check: If you work more hours, generally you make more money. Become a journalist and interrupt your career to raise kids, as I did, and you make less.\nIn 1982, women made 65 cents for every dollar earned by men. The big jump to 80 cents in 2002 was largely because women began going to college in greater numbers, giving birth later and spending less time at home with children.\nNo single factor explains pay gaps. But the reports newly required by the Council won\u2019t identify any factors. They will just create work for employers and agencies, making them tally numbers that have no practical value and will not change anything.\nActually, Intro 982-A could change one thing \u2014 it could deter businesses from hiring a 201st employee and subjecting themselves to this madness.\n",

        "content": "Lincoln Yards finally has a full slate of new players, and that alone marks the end of what Sterling Bay once promised would be Chicago\u2019s next great mega-development, nestled between wealthy Lincoln Park and gentrifying Bucktown.\nWith\nJDL and Kayne Anderson\nnow controlling the land north of the Chicago River and\nThe Real Deal\nbreaking the news this week that\nJohn Novak is buying the similarly stalled\nsouthern portion, the project has been rebooted. Sterling Bay\u2019s $6 billion, 14.5 million-square-foot vision isn\u2019t just being revised \u2014 it\u2019s being replaced.\nThe shift didn\u2019t happen overnight.\nSterling spent years pushing\nan audacious plan to turn former industrial land along the North Branch into a dense hub of offices, apartments, labs and entertainment. The firm deserves real credit for taking on a wildly ambitious assignment and getting as far as it did. It secured the zoning, convinced City Hall to create a tax increment finance plan and lined up heavyweight financial partners.\nBut Sterling made\nsome crucial errors\nas well. Its bet got too big, and the commercial real estate market dropped too much, for the firm to cash in. Infrastructure demands of the project multiplied, as the requirements the city thrust onto the development team\nproved too heavy to lift\n. Public support for footing a large share of those costs never fully materialized. At a certain point, the capital stack couldn\u2019t carry the vision anymore.\nNow the baton has been passed. On the north side of the Chicago River,\nJim Letchinger\u2019s JDL\nand Kayne Anderson stepped in this fall to buy former Lincoln Yards land after\nBank OZK seized the parcels\nfrom Sterling and Dallas-based Lone Star funds, setting the table for a more residential-driven plan than previously contemplated. On the south, Novak is taking control of the parcel\nJP Morgan Asset Management had been reluctant\nto take away from Sterling for over a year. Between the new owners, Lincoln Yards is no longer one coordinated megaproject but two distinct sides of the river run by unrelated teams.\nFragmentation was part of Sterling Bay\u2019s original challenge. It controlled both sides only through separate partnerships \u2014 Lone Star Funds and Bank OZK to the north, JP Morgan to the south \u2014 each with its own priorities and tolerance for risk.\nJDL and Kayne\u2019s failed effort to also buy the southern block showed the issue hasn\u2019t gone away. Chicago real estate insiders have said JP Morgan\u2019s refusal to indemnify the\nJDL-led team\nfrom loss tied to litigation that Sterling had flirted with bringing in the event the southern parcels were sold killed that transaction, though the firm hasn\u2019t commented on the matter.\nSo\nNovak\u2019s arrival\nsolves ownership on the south but introduces yet another independent operator. Whether this constellation works better the second time will depend on how closely the city corrals the groups.\nWhich brings the whole effort back to City Hall. The\nagreement Sterling Bay struck\nwith the Department of Planning and Development will almost certainly be rewritten. The previous infrastructure obligations were massive and, in hindsight, financially unrealistic without deeper public participation. Because the new developers are planning far less density, the need \u2014 and cost \u2014 for bridges, roads, utilities and transit upgrades should shrink. But the city will still have to define how much each developer pays and how much, if any, taxpayers should cover.\nThat makes the next phase simpler in some ways and more complicated in others. Easier because the ambitions are scaled back, more complex because the coordination burden shifts to the city, which must referee three owners with different business plans.\nThe Planning and Development Department declined to comment for now, other than to say that any proposed changes to past approvals and agreements would get reviewed as they\u2019re shared with city officials.\nFor Chicago residents, the hope is that any renegotiated deal improves transparency, right-sizes public exposure and finally unlocks development on one of the most valuable stretches of the river.\nLincoln Yards isn\u2019t dead but instead reincarnated. The question now is whether this new cast can do what Sterling Bay couldn\u2019t: turn land into progress rather than promise.\n",

        "content": "Downtown Los Angeles isn\u2019t what it used to be \u2014 and it seems no one knows that better than Brookfield, which now is looking to dispose of four distressed office buildings that account for nearly one-fifth of the Class A space in the Financial District.\nThe commercial giant has ceded control of some ailing offices to a court-appointed receiver, sold some at steep discounts \u2014 and it still has plenty in play. Brookfield and its lenders (and receivers and special servicers) are peddling four active offerings that totals about 4.9 million square feet of Class A office space in the submarket, roughly 18 percent of the total inventory.\nThe Financial District has a total of around 26.5 million square feet of Class A space, according to the most recent data from brokerage Avison Young (Bunker Hill is commonly considered part of the Financial District, although Avison Young breaks out the data).\nInvestors with deep pockets and hearty appetites for risk can consider:\nEY Plaza: Colliers is\nmarketing\nthe $275 million, non-preforming note tied to the property at 725 South Figueroa Street, in receivership. That note is expected to trade at a massive discount. Last the publication heard, Colliers was calling for offers. It is unclear whether it found a lucky buyer. If the brokerage did, who knows if the deal would hold \u2014 Carolwood\u2019s prior $130 million deal collapsed.\nBank of America Plaza: Colliers is\nshopping\nthe defaulted commercial mortgage-backed securities loan connected to the skyscraper at 333 South Hope Street, in receivership. The debt balance is $400 million, and the brokerage anticipates substantially discounted bids.\nWells Fargo Center\u2019s North Tower: Eastdil Secured is\nmarketing\nthe mortgage loan on 333 South Grand Avenue, which includes an office tower and a retail asset. The roughly $506 million debt on the property is in default, though it is not in the hands of a receiver. Bids are anticipated around $196 million, according to data and analytics provider Green Street.\nWells Fargo Center\u2019s South Tower: Newmark is\nshopping\nthe skyscraper \u2014 a sister to its sibling to the north \u2014 at 355 South Grand Avenue. Bids are anticipated to come in around $157 million, per Green Street, not enough to cover the $263 million debt balance that came due.\nWhat happens now?\nA truism seems to be in the works, according to an informed industry source who said the buildings will find buyers, it\u2019s just a matter of pricing.\nSounds as though downtown\u2019s office market is still bouncing along a soft bottom. Now to see if Brookfield\u2019s latest offerings set a firm floor.\nTurnbridge turns up in desert\nTurnbridge Equities\nclosed\non a long-delayed, debt-laden development in a Palm Springs-area resort city, getting the SilverRock Resort project in La Quinta out of bankruptcy for a haircut price of $65 million, or $500,000 an acre.\nThe unfinished resort\u2019s prior developer, Robert Green, defaulted on debt and later filed for bankruptcy \u2014 $270.5 million in claims. Prior estimates put the property\u2019s value at $300 million to $400 million.\nTurnbridge has a single luxe hotel with branded condominiums and estate-sized single-family homes on its mind for the 130 acres it got. The new owner anticipates that as an initial phase that will cost $735 million to build out.\nThe SilverRock Golf Course, owned and operated by the city, is set to be transferred to Turnbridge once the hotel is completed.\nThe property, at 79179 Ahmanson Lane, isn\u2019t far from where the Coachella and Stagecoach music festivals are held, ultra-exclusive Madison Club, where Apple\u2019s Tim Cook and Grammy-winning singer Adele are among the list of bold-faced names who own vacation homes there.\nUnmatch\nTinder and Hinge parent company Match Group\ndumped\na West Hollywood office building. The property at 8800 West Sunset Boulevard traded hands for $35.5 million, or around $480 per square foot.\nThe buyers appear to be Omega Law Group founding partners Edwin Saghian, Robin Saghian and Shahab Mossavar-Rahmani, who signed a loan document and are members of the limited liability company named as grantee. It could be the partners were representing a client, but their accident and injury firm is located at the purchased property, so it seems more likely they are the buyers.\n",

        "content": "The story of San Francisco has largely been one of return. The artificial intelligence industry has\nprovided the latest lick\nfor the boom or bust town, and Mayor Daniel Lurie has been hailed in his first year as the right person to steer a city now bursting with cash, investment and optimism. San Francisco, as they say, is back.\nWhat could possibly slow this fiery momentum? Well, bad press seems to be a headwind everyone wants to avoid. Remember\nthe so-called Doom Loop?\nIn human nature, persistently negative narratives have a way of becoming self-fulfilling prophecies. This fact is apparently top of mind for the powers that be in San Francisco.\nLaurie Thomas, executive director of Golden Gate Restaurant Association, said as much during a Thursday panel focused on the state of retail in San Francisco. She urged the business community to refrain from the temptation to talk to news reporters \u201cwho want the gotcha story.\u201d\n\u201cYou just have to consciously remember that we kind of build our own future,\u201d Thomas said during the event, hosted by BisNow. She encouraged those speaking with reporters to remain factual, but positive, so that \u201cthe ball rolls down the hill in the right direction. \u2026 One of the things that\u2019s been helpful is working closely with [Mayor Lurie\u2019s] administration and their comms so that we all understand everything and can reposition it. The message has to stay positive.\u201d\nJoshua Callahan, managing director at private equity firm Roxborough Group, pushed back, saying that narrative and reality in San Francisco have recently diverged. Callahan acknowledged that the city enjoyed more investment than just a couple years ago, and debt was increasingly available for new projects, but the reality for business and owners and developers remains more challenging than the \u201cSan Francisco is back\u201d narrative portrays. The costs are high and margins are thin, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still not obvious that good ideas are easy projects to do,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cIt\u2019s still really tough to believe in that growth story. It\u2019s tougher than some of the narratives are starting to make it seem.\u201d\nFifty miles to the south,\ndowntown San Jose is dealing with its own narrative vs reality.\nThe Silicon Valley office market has long subsisted on hype. According to Joshua Burroughs, COO of local developer Urban Catalyst, 90 percent of office space is built on speculation. In a region where startups can quickly grow from a garage into a Unicorn that soaks up hundreds of thousands of square feet of office space, it\u2019s critical for cities to have a healthy stock of ready-to-go offices.\nYet, for downtown San Jose, much of the office space is now empty, and developers like Urban Catalyst are scaling back their ambitious visions for the skyline. Building permits submitted to the city\u2019s planning department last week showed Urban Catalyst had revised its proposal for a 21-story office tower and a 27-story mixed-use tower into a pair of eight-story apartment buildings with 626 total new housing units.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take 600 units downtown, but to go from 20 stories to eight is uninspiring,\u201d a local economic development analyst told The Real Deal.\nThis comes as the Jay Paul Company is still searching for a tenant for its 19-story, million-square-foot\n200 Park project,\ncompleted in 2023. And Google\u2019s ambitious vision for its Downtown West neighborhood\u00a0 with 4,000 homes, 7.3 million square feet of office space, and an estimated economic impact of $19 billion, has been on hold for years.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not no hope,\u201d one city hall staffer told The Real Deal. \u201cIf we can\u2019t fill 200 Park, and we can\u2019t get the Google project going, then I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see the office market move.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Kenny Wolfe\n\u2014 now that\u2019s a name you haven\u2019t heard in a while.\nThe Dallas-based syndicator\u2019s spectacular flame-out matched his hubris \u2014 a quality that separated him from his peers who were also using the pooled-equity model of multifamily investing.\nThe student of\nmultifamily mentor Brad Sumrok\ntried to make the jump from operating a string of dollar stores across the Midwest and shabby apartment complexes in Texas to executing one of the most challenging types of projects in the world of real estate development: An office to residential conversion.\nIt may not come as a surprise that\nhe didn\u2019t stick the landing\n.\nHe set his sights on conversion projects in iconic downtown buildings in Dallas, Fort Worth and Cleveland, but bit off more than he could chew. His portfolio was wiped out almost as quickly as it was built.\nHis story might be over (for now at least), but the buildings he owned are still in play.\nA downtown Dallas property he planned to convert to apartments\nhit the market\nalmost two years after Wolfe\u2019s lender took the keys back at a foreclosure auction. The capital stack for 211 North Ervay, an iconic mid-century office tower built in 1958, included a $13 million loan from Thistle Creek Capital, which bought the building back in an $8 million credit bid, or $43 per square foot.\nIf you\u2019ve ever walked around downtown Dallas, you\u2019ve seen this building. It\u2019s covered in turquoise porcelain panels, sticking out like a modernist sore thumb among the glass facades and brick exteriors that populate the urban core.\nWolfe may not have displayed much sense in taking on 211 N Ervay, but he wasn\u2019t completely off the mark on his plans. Experts agree the building has potential.\nA 2023 paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in coordination with New York University and Columbia University identified the property as one of 50 North Texas buildings structurally ripe for conversion. Arpit Gupta, the New York University professor who authored the report, said the building \u201cmet all the criteria\u201d for a conversion candidate.\nFeeling as ambitious as Kenny Wolfe? This mid-century gem could be yours. Avison Young has the listing and is marketing the nearly vacant property as a redevelopment play. The listing has no asking price.\nRemembering a pioneer of the mixed-use sports venue\nDallas investor Tom Hicks,\nwho died on Saturday\nat the age of 79, didn\u2019t just own sports teams \u2014 the Dallas Stars, Texas Rangers and Liverpool Football Club \u2014 he helped usher in a new era of sports real estate. Hicks foresaw the success of districts that integrate sports complexes with other uses, like offices, retail and multifamily. As owner of the Stars, Hicks partnered with Ross Perot Jr. to usher in the development of Victory Park, the entertainment district across Woodall Rogers Freeway from downtown. The pair developed American Airlines Center, which opened in 2001. It\u2019s the home arena for the Stars and the Dallas Mavericks.\nHighland Park home sets 2025 record\nGuinn and Betsy Crousen\u2019s mansion at 4000 Euclid Avenue in Highland Park\nsold with an asking price of $32.5 million\n, making it the most expensive residential sale in Texas this year.\nThe 19,000-square-foot home, built in 2015, features imported French materials, a gold-leafed dome, a courtyard with a pool, and one of the largest lots in Highland Park. The asking price amounts to about $1,700 per square foot.\nRefi! At The Quad\nStream Realty Partners scored a\nrefi deal for The Quad\n, a newly redeveloped office and retail campus in Uptown Dallas. KREF Capital, the real estate investment arm of KKR, provided the $228.2 million loan, which will replace a prior $181 million construction loan for the site\u2019s redevelopment. JLL arranged the deal, which further proves investors\u2019 interest in Uptown office properties.\n",

        "content": "Anyone who thought the final nail had been hammered in the dispute between cities and the state over builder\u2019s remedy might want to think again.\nLet\u2019s revisit the latest in the saga involving\nHuntington Beach\n, starting with the observation that there was some presumptive PR at play when Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta issued a joint declaration of \u201cvictory\u201d on Thursday. The win they claimed came when the California Supreme Court declined to review a lower-court decision on whether charter city status could be a loophole in challenges to builder\u2019s remedy.\nThe lower court waived off any such special status. It more specifically put legal clamps on\nHuntington Beach\n\u2019s fight against state law requiring local jurisdictions to create a \u201chousing element\u201d as a plan to meet mandated levels of housing production.\nSure, there was room for the governor and AG to claim a win in the latest legal round \u2014 but Huntington Beach still has a hand to play\nIn a lawsuit separate from the state\u2019s, Huntington Beach headed to U.S. District Court to challenge the\u00a0 housing mandates based on their constitutionality. Charter cities \u2014 such as Huntington Beach, Los Angeles and San Francisco \u2014 are called that for a reason. They have charters that function as municipal constitutions of sorts.\u00a0 In some cases, a charter can shield a city from state regulation. Election laws and prevailing wage are areas where courts have found the city charter and ordinances to have the final say on a local matter.\nHuntington Beach\u2019s federal lawsuit is now at the U.S. Supreme Court, where a petition from the city seeks a review of lower-court rulings.\nThat\u2019s partly what allowed the city to waive off the state-level denial for review Newsom and Bonta touted as a win.\n\u201cThe city will continue to vigorously defend its environmental stewardship, its charter-city authority and its right to fair and evenhanded enforcement of state housing laws in the superior court,\u201d Huntington Beach said in a statement Thursday.\nWhat\u2019s CEQA got to do with it?\nA lot, actually.\nIf one looks at how Huntington Beach is arguing its case legally, the California Environmental Quality Act has plenty to do with the city\u2019s legal posturing.\nWhen CEQA went into effect in 1970, it set into motion a series of rules that have been pieced together over the decades, leaving the mess of interpretation and enforcement up to local government.\nHuntington Beach asserts that the housing element puts it in a precarious situation with CEQA. That, the city said, opens it up to \u201cpenalties unless it adopts a housing element, even though CEQA prohibits adoption until environmental review is completed and lawful findings can be made.\u201d\nUltimately, the question of how builder\u2019s remedy plays with existing state regulations is only just getting started.\nLawsuit seeks no change on SB 9\nNewsom\u2019s carveout from a law allowing for\nsplit lots\nto build more density in Los Angeles\u2019 burn areas is also facing a legal challenge now that YIMBY Law has filed suit against Newsom, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Los Angeles County, along with the cities of Los Angeles, Pasadena and Malibu.\nThe challenge comes to Senate Bill 9, which went into effect at the start of 2022, allows owners to split single-family lots for the purpose of building another home or adding an accessory dwelling unit.\nThe housing advocacy group contends that suspending SB 9 will make the rebuilding process harder on property owners who might need to sell a portion of their lot or use part of their property for generating rental income.\nTurnover and retention\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty landed a big get when the\nWalters | Plaxen Group\nannounced it was parting ways with the Beverly Hills Estates this past week.\nThe seven-person group is led by Nicole Plaxen and Shauna Walters, with the two closing over $1 billion in career sales.\nThe change of scenery comes after former Beverly Hills Estates broker of record and general manager Matthew Clayman left to lead Coldwell Banker Realty\u2019s Beverly Hills and Hancock Park offices. Clayman recently recruited Severin Braham, former director of operations for the Williams and Williams Estates Group at the Beverly Hills Estates.\nOther departures from the brokerage include Shana and Emila Tavangarian, the daughters of luxury spec developer Ardie Tavangarian, who left for Carolwood Estates; Mick Partridge, who also left for Carolwood; and Greg LaPlant, who is also now with Coldwell Banker, per Department of Real Estate records.\n",

        "content": "The real estate industry rallied behind Eileen Higgins, who was elected to be Miami\u2019s next mayor in last week\u2019s runoff election.\nHiggins\u2019 win was a major upset for the Democrats. She is the first female mayor of Miami and the first Democrat in the position since 1997. The former Miami-Dade County commissioner was running against ex-City Manager Emilio Gonzalez, who scored President Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement. Higgins is also taking over from Republican Francis Suarez, a longtime favorite among developers and brokers, who has been mayor of Miami since 2017 and who helped push through major projects, including the Miami Freedom Park mixed-use stadium development.\nHiggins and Gonzalez both promised to fix the city\u2019s ineffective permitting process, improve housing affordability and clean up corruption at City Hall.\nBut Higgins has a\ntrack record with developers\n. As a county commissioner, she approved projects with nearly 7,000 affordable and workforce housing units.\nShe also raised nearly 10 times more campaign donations from real estate professionals, corporations and land use attorneys than Gonzalez, according to finance reports for their campaigns released after the Nov. 4 election. The prominent land use law firm Bercow Radell Fernandez Larkin &amp; Tapanes co-hosted a fundraiser for Higgins at Brightline Station in downtown Miami last month, where other hosts named on the invitation included Integra Investments developer Nelson Stabile, Adler Properties CEO Jonathan Raiffe and Florida East Coast Industries\u2019 exec Jose Gonzalez.\nJeff Berkowitz and his wife Yolanda, zoning lawyers Iris Escarra and Melissa Tapanes Llahues, Cervera Real Estate\u2019s Alicia Cervera Lamadrid, land use attorney Anthony De Yurre and more LLCs tied to Integra and Adler also contributed to her campaign.\nIt\u2019s unknown yet if Higgins will accomplish her campaign promises of building more housing and fixing the permitting process, but developers, brokers, lenders and their attorneys will be watching.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nAt the Sunny Isles condo association meeting last week, someone tried to block people from entering and then\nripped up ballots\n.

If you know of any that should be featured, send me an email.\nTrial lawyer Stephen Zack sold his eight-bedroom, nine-bathroom and two-half bathroom unit on the 54th floor of the Four Seasons condo-hotel at 1425 and 1435 Brickell Avenue to a land trust. The trust is owned by Santo Politi, co-founder of Spark Capital, and Eleanor Gray. The trust paid $9 million for the unit, in a deal brokered by Compass\u2019 Audrey Ross and Douglas Elliman\u2019s Devin Kay.\nFund manager Peter Hochfelder, president of the La Gorce Country Club, paid $9 million for the non-waterfront home at 450 West 62nd Street in Miami Beach. Nelson Gonzalez with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty represented the seller, Priority Payments Local CEO Sal Didonato, while Compass\u2019 Chad Carroll brought the buyer. Hochfelder is moving from his Park Grove condo in Coconut Grove.\nElsewhere in Florida\nFlorida cut nearly 20 percent of its environmental protection jobs and reduced environmental spending by 7 percent over the past 15 years, the most of any state, according to the\nOrlando Sentinel\n. The cuts, enacted under governors Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis, come as climate threats intensify.\nFlorida health officials moved to drop four school vaccine requirements without legislative or gubernatorial approval, the\nMiami Herald\nreports. It advances Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo\u2019s push to end vaccine mandates.\nMost Citizens Property Insurance customers could see lower premiums next year. South Florida homeowners would see the biggest drops, with more than three-quarters of policyholders in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties facing proposed cuts of roughly 12 to 13 percent, according to the\nSun Sentinel\n.",

        "content": "The Village of Schaumburg\u2019s zoning board recommended approval of a residential redevelopment of the 33\u2011acre Loeber Farm property, despite objections from neighboring Rolling Meadows residents.\nUnder a proposal from Nitti Development, the farm at 2014 North Meacham Road would turn into 43 single\u2011family homes, 37 row houses across eight buildings and 42 townhouses in 16 buildings, the\nDaily Herald reported\n. The village board is scheduled to vote on final approval Jan. 13.\nTo support the project, Schaumburg has begun the process of extending a nearby tax increment financing district north to include the farm. The extension would help fund public improvements required for the development, tying the project into larger redevelopment around Algonquin and Meacham roads.\nThe farm represents the village\u2019s last large undeveloped parcel, and\nplans have floated\nfor more than 20 years.\nAt the zoning board meeting on Wednesday, nine Rolling Meadows residents raised concerns about drainage impacts along Salt Creek, which already experiences flooding, and traffic congestion on Meacham Road, the sole access point to the site. While some residents acknowledged that development is inevitable, they argued that the proposal lacked firm guarantees to mitigate environmental and traffic impacts.\nResident Mike Bryskier criticized the plan as \u201cwishful thinking dressed up as a plan.\u201d\nIn response, the zoning board added new conditions to the project. These include appointing a construction liaison to keep neighbors informed throughout the building process, and restricting outdoor construction hours to 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., with no Sunday work allowed.\nZoning board Chairman Harry Raimondi emphasized that the village would closely monitor the developer\u2019s performance, stressing that Schaumburg aims to ensure neighbors are not adversely affected. The project sits\nnear the Schaumburg border\nwith Rolling Meadows.\nNitti Development, headed by Frank Nitti, originally proposed 357 housing units on the farm,\na mix\nof apartments and townhomes. In response to the objections, the developer\nscaled back plans\nfor the site.\nThe Loeber Farm redevelopment represents one of the area\u2019s larger infill housing proposals, and its approval would advance Schaumburg\u2019s broader strategy to add residential density and support infrastructure upgrades through tax increment financing.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

It also marks the lowest median listing price in Fort Worth all year, according to GFWAR.\nUp to the summer, Fort Worth\u2019s median home listing price remained above 2024 levels by a comfortable margin. In July, though, it fell 2.3 percent, year-over-year, to about $337,000, while the median price rose in Dallas by 1.6 percent to $452,000. Since then, the median home listing price in Fort Worth has lagged, year-over-year, every month except October, when it equaled the median listing price of October 2024.\nThe shift represents a\ncoming-to-grips moment\nfor Fort Worth sellers, who have long enjoyed the upper hand in negotiations.\n\u201cEverybody who\u2019s in the game \u2014 economists, lenders, realtors \u2014 we all understand that what we saw three or four years ago is not sustainable,\u201d said GFWAR President Paul Epperley.\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually pretty happy with the stability of the market,\u201d he said. \u201cHomes are still selling, buyers are still buying; maybe not at the fever pitch that they were.\u201d\nThe Dallas/Fort Worth area hit a market value peak in the summer of 2022, according to Zillow data.\nWhile Dallas sellers consider their homes more expensive this year, the market disagrees.\nSale prices declined 3.3 percent in November\n, according to Redfin \u2014 putting Dallas right next to Fort Worth, with a decline of 3.9 percent, at the top of the national leaderboard.\nOther cities in the Texas Triangle are also adjusting to the buyer\u2019s market.

King Street Capital Management and Blue Owl Capital originated the floating-rate loan.\nAn Eastdil Secured team including Rob Turner, Grant Frankel and Ethan Pond arranged the deal, which was first reported last month by PERE Credit.\nThe refinancing retires a $463 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan.\nThe real estate investment firm previously missed a required balloon payment on the debt, which matured in June, according to CRED iQ.

Savanna was then hoping to land a refinancing deal within 90 days, according to service commentary.\nIn addition to retiring the old debt, Savanna plans to use proceeds from the refinancing to build an amenity center and improve tenant spaces. The building is 80 percent leased today, but the landlord has its sights set on occupancy north of 95 percent next year.\nSavanna\u2019s been coping with its own distress while simultaneously continuing to make more bets on the office market.\nIn February, the company bought the leasehold on 430 West 15th Street in the Meatpacking District for\n$85 million\n, a sharp discount to the $159 million that Invesco had paid for the property in 2018.\nAnd last November, Savanna bought the newly constructed office building at 799 Broadway for\n$255 million\n, after owner Columbia Property Trust had defaulted on its $270 million mortgage.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The last building to do so was CBSK Irongate\u2019s new development co-op at 1228 Madison Avenue.\nThe two apartments were among 33 properties asking $4 million to find a buyer last week. The total was up from 29 in the\nprevious period\n.\nThe most expensive was Unit 12C, with an asking price of $26.8 million. Wall Street executive Richard Cantor and his wife, psychiatrist Pamela Cantor, bought the 3,300-square-foot condo from the developer in 2007 for $14.2 million.\nThe three-bedroom, three-bathroom home, which hit the market in September, features a terrace, a formal dining room and a study with views of Central Park.\nThe Mercedes Berk Team with Engel &amp; V\u00f6lkers New York City had the listing.\nThe second most expensive was Unit 14B, which last asked $25 million. The condo, which hit the market in May asking $27.5 million, last traded for $14.5 million in 2008, when a buyer whose identity is shielded by an anonymous entity purchased it from the developer.\nThe apartment spans 3,400 square feet and has four bedrooms and three bathrooms. The deal also includes a 6th-floor studio, which the seller bought for roughly $1 million.\nCorcoran\u2019s Cathy Franklin, Alexis Bodenheimer and Shannon Suydam had the listing.\nThe Robert A.M. Stern-designed tower pushed condo pricing in Manhattan to new heights when sales launched in the early 2000s. It\u2019s since drawn a number of top-dollar deals and big-name buyers, including Hyundai CEO Euisun Chung, who bought a unit from infamous Italian cosmetics mogul Piofrancesco Borgetti for\n$16.5 million\n.\nAmenities in the building include a fitness center, pool, private restaurant and terrace.\nOf the 33 properties, 25 were condos, five were co-ops, one was a condop and two were townhouses.\nThe homes asked a combined $282 million, which works out to an average price of $8.5 million and a median of $6 million. The typical home was on the market for roughly a year and a half and had a discount of 6 percent.",

        "content": "After inking the biggest new downtown office lease Chicago has seen in three years, Sargent &amp; Lundy decided it still isn\u2019t enough.\nThe Chicago-based energy engineering firm leased three additional floors at the 51-story tower at 77 West Wacker Drive, expanding its commitment that it made a year ago by roughly 66,000 square feet, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The move boosts Sargent &amp; Lundy\u2019s total space in the tower to nearly 448,000 square feet, about 60 percent more than it occupies currently at its longtime home at\n55 East Monroe Street\n.\nThe expansion sweetens what was already one of the most consequential leasing wins for the Loop office market since the pandemic. When Sargent &amp; Lundy signed its initial deal at 77 West Wacker late last year, it marked the largest new downtown office lease since Kirkland &amp; Ellis\u2019 2021 commitment at Salesforce Tower.\nSavills brokers Joe Learner and Robert Sevim represented Sargent &amp; Lundy. CBRE\u2019s Michael Kazmierczak, Kelsey Scheive and Aaron Schuster handle leasing at the tower.\nInstead of following the prevailing post-pandemic trend of shrinking office space, Sargent &amp; Lundy is going the other way. The company\u2019s growing appetite for space cements its status as one of the largest tenants in Chicago\u2019s urban core and adds momentum in the Loop, as the market looks ahead to Google opening its revamped\nThompson Center campus\nnext year.\nThe need for more space is tied directly to headcount. When Sargent &amp; Lundy announced its initial Wacker Drive lease in December 2024, the firm said it planned to add 300 Chicago jobs. Those roles have since been filled, and the company now expects to hire another 200 local employees, spokeswoman Brenda Romero told the publication.\nThe biggest beneficiary of the firm\u2019s growth is the building\u2019s owner, the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio.\nSTRS Ohio\nhas owned the 960,000-square-foot tower\nsince 2008\n, but occupancy slid sharply over the years as major law firms including Jones Day, Morgan Lewis &amp; Bockius and Greenberg Traurig moved out.\nSargent &amp; Lundy\u2019s anchor lease reversed that erosion. The pension fund had already signaled confidence in the building by paying off a\n$150 million mortgage in 2023\nand investing in a new amenity floor. With the latest expansion, the property is now nearly full, according to Costar.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher",

Gotham locked in a 99-year lease with a base rent of $500,000 annually, which will jump 12.5 percent every five years.\nThe $100 million development will be built on the site of a former MTA-owned parking lot. Notable aspects of the project include 10 percent of units being income-restricted, 15,000 square feet of retail space and a public plaza.\nThere will also be residential amenities, such as a co-working space, a fitness center, a roof terrace with barbecue grills and a multisport simulator.\nWhile the necessary applications have yet to be submitted, Gotham anticipates starting a 20-month construction process in 2027.\nThe site has been in play multiple times over the years. In 2022, Florida-based Mill Creek Residential earned the blessing of the MTA to develop the site. But Mill Creek failed to make progress on a development, leading the MTA to reopen its Request for Proposals last May.\nA stop away on the morning train to Manhattan, Farmingdale-based Terwilliger &amp; Bartone Properties is\nplanning a $61 million project\non Jerusalem Avenue near Hicksville\u2019s high-trafficked train station.

        "content": "It\u2019s official: New York City is getting three casinos.\nThe state\u2019s Gaming Commission on Monday conditionally approved granting casino licenses to the three proposals that cleared a key board this month, bringing to a close a years-long competition that once included a dozen visions for facilities throughout the city.\nThe winners are Steve Cohen\u2019s Metropolitan Park, an $8 billion facility planned near Citi Field; the proposed $4 billion complex at Bally\u2019s Golf Links at Ferry Point; and Resorts World\u2019s $7.5 billion expansion of the Queens Aqueduct. The Commission, however, only approved the facilities on the condition that the companies agree to have an independent monitor to ensure that they adhere to the various promises they made to their respective communities.\nAfter the meeting, Commission Chair Brian O\u2019Dwyer said the independent monitor will track pledges made by the casino teams, both within and outside their formal applications.\n\u201c[If] the monitor tells us that there has not been substantial compliance with every single thing that they have promised, {it] comes back to us for further consideration, up to and including the revocation of the license,\u201d\nO\u2019Dwyer said. \u201cWe\u2019re holding their feet to the fire.\u201d\nHe said the state will hear from the monitor on a quarterly basis for at least five years, and will be watching how the teams ensure that the projects benefit their surrounding communities. He said diversity is important to the commission, a nod to concerns previously raised by officials that none of the proposals made binding commitments to hire a diverse workforce.\nThe Commission\u2019s decision was largely expected, though leaders have emphasized that the process wasn\u2019t simply a rubber stamp. The Commission was tasked with ensuring the proposals met statutory licensing requirements, following\napproval\nby the five-member Gaming Facility Location Board this month.\nBally\u2019s and Resorts World will have an initial licensing term of 15 years, while Metropolitan Park\nYears-long process\nMonday\u2019s approval was more than a decade in the making. Voters approved a change to the state constitution in 2013, allowing for up to seven casinos to open throughout New York, with four upstate and three downstate.\nThe state awarded the four licenses upstate within a few years. In 2022, the state legislature added a new feature to the downstate approvals, requiring proposals to receive two-thirds support from Community Advisory Committees, a body of five to six members appointed by city, state and local officials.\nBefore reaching that stage, some competitors\ndropped out\nwhen it became clear that they couldn\u2019t secure the necessary local support. Eight bids ultimately competed, and the CACs only approved half, eliminating\nevery Manhattan\nand Brooklyn proposal. In October, MGM Resorts\nquit\nthe race, citing shifting \u201ccompetitive and economic assumptions\u201d underpinning its bid to turn its Yonkers facility into a full-fledged casino.\nThat left three teams to potentially each snag a license.\nThe state\u2019s consultants estimate that the trio could generate $7 billion in incremental gaming tax revenue from 2027 to 2036, as well as $5.9 billion in other local and state taxes. Critics, however, have pointed out that the upstate casinos\nhave not\nmet their initial revenue and tax targets.\nIn its\nreport\n, the Gaming Facility Location Board expressed concern that teams would backtrack or otherwise fail to keep the promises they made to advance in the casino competition. The board also pointed out that Resorts World overestimated its annual tax revenue projections, pegging them at more than $1 billion in revenue each year. The board\u2019s consultants projected revenue would total more than $4 billion over a decade.\nThe winners\nAt Metropolitan Park, Cohen and Hard Rock International plan to turn 50 acres worth of parking lots next to Citi Field into a casino complex with nearly 300,000 square feet of gaming space, a 1,000-room hotel, a 5,650-person live music venue, restaurants and 25 acres of green space.\nThe team also\npledged\n, in partnership with Slate Property Group, to build 450 affordable housing units at 54-19 100th Street in Corona, roughly two miles away from the casino.\nThe Bally\u2019s casino will be built on 16 acres of parking lots and practice green at Bally\u2019s Golf Links at Ferry Point. The project is expected to include 3,500 gaming machines, 250 table games, 500 hotel rooms and a 2,000-seat entertainment venue.\nAs a result of Bally\u2019s securing a license, the Trump Organization is also a winner. When it acquired the golf course\u2019s lease from the Trump Organization in 2023, Bally\u2019s\nagreed\nto pay Trump $115 million if it won a license.\nAt the Queens Aqueduct, Resorts World plans to add 6,000 slot machines and 800 table games, as well as 2,000 hotel rooms and a 7,000-seat arena. The company has also agreed, through an agreement with\nCirrus Real Estate\n, to invest in 50,000 workforce housing units citywide.\nResorts World estimates it will open a full-fledged gaming facility in March 2026, and then complete the expanded complex in 2031. Bally\u2019s and Metropark are expected to open in mid-2030. In its report, however, the state board noted that these projections seemed ambitious and might be overly optimistic, given various regulatory and construction challenges.\n",

        "content": "The Los Angeles City Council voted in favor of expanding the citywide adaptive reuse ordinance in an effort to stimulate housing growth by making it easier for developers to convert vacant offices into housing.\nThe new ordinance repeals Los Angeles\u2019 existing Adaptive Reuse Incentive Areas Specific Plan, which limited conversions to certain parts of the city including downtown, Chinatown, Hollywood and Koreatown, opening all areas within city limits to adaptive reuse projects, Bisnow\nreported\n. The new legal framework also lowers the age of the buildings that can be considered for adaptive reuse to structures that are at least 15 years old, broadening the pool of potential targets beyond buildings built before 1974. More projects will also be able to receive approval by right under the new law, the Los Angeles Daily News\nreported\n.\nThe city has been working to update the adaptive reuse rules since 2023. Across the city, office-to-residential conversions could create approximately 4,400 homes, according to a RentCafe\nreport\nfrom earlier this year.\nLos Angeles\u2019 existing adaptive reuse rules date back to 1999. That legislation helped kick off the construction of more than 12,000 housing units downtown, helping turn the area from a strictly business district into a residential and commercial hub for residents.\nLos Angeles\nranks second nationwide\nin adaptive reuse projects. L.A. has 5,640 apartments in the works, following behind Manhattan with 11,000 such units.\nOffice buildings are the hottest target for conversion in the City of Los Angeles, with 11 adaptive reuse projects in development as of July, RentCafe reported, citing Yardi Matrix data. Those office-to-resi pursuits combine for a total of 2,843 apartments or about 50 percent of the city\u2019s adaptive reuse housing pipeline.\nJamison Services leads the adaptive reuse race\nin the city, building the three largest office-to-residential projects to date. Those include the conversion of a 33-story office building at\n1055 West 7th Street\ndowntown into 691 apartments; the 19-story L.A. Superior Court Tower at\n600 South Commonwealth Avenue\nbecoming 428 units; and an 18-story building at 695 Vermont Avenue in Koreatown transforming into 255 apartments.\nThe City of Los Angeles is\nrequired\nby the state to plan for 456,643 new housing units by 2029.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

BXP bought the site in 2016 for $78 million. Its assessed value at the top of this year was $89.1 million, the Mercury News\nreported\n.\nThe property was home to a 218,366-square-foot office building that has since been demolished. A BXP affiliate previously submitted plans to build nearly 700,000 square feet of offices and parking facilities on the property. That proposal called for two eight-story office buildings connected by bridges and an accompanying four-level parking garage. The buildings under that plan each totaled 338,155 square feet for a combined 676,300 square feet, per Santa Clara records cited by the Mercury News.\nThe city approved architectural permits in 2022, as well as a permit extension earlier this year, though BXP\u2019s extension request noted that market conditions could make the project infeasible. The request also claimed that the timeline for\nSilicon Valley Power to provide sufficient power\nto the site \u201cexceeds a reasonable timeline to develop the site and attract tenants.\u201d\nIn July, Bay Area-based\nSummerHill Homes\nsubmitted a preliminary application with the City of Santa Clara to build 292 townhome-style condominiums at the site. The City of Santa Clara is\nmandated\nby the state to plan for 11,632 new housing units by 2031.\nPalo Alto Networks could pursue BXP\u2019s proposal for offices, as the cybersecurity company\u2019s headquarters are located adjacent to the 3625 Peterson Way site. Its exact plans for the former BXP property have not been disclosed. With BXP\u2019s offices blueprint, the development location could be large enough to accommodate between 2,700 to 3,400 workers, according to the Mercury News.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The University of Austin is planting a physical flag in Elon Musk country.\nThe upstart institution said it is well into construction on an applied engineering lab adjacent to The Boring Company\u2019s headquarters in Bastrop County east of Austin, deepening a link between the university and Musk\u2019s expanding network of companies, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n. A social media post on Friday from the school showed the building nearing completion, close to the intersection of Walker Watson Road and FM 1209, about 30 miles east of Downtown Austin, with the caption \u201ccoming soon.\u201d\nThe social media post landed alongside a separate post from\nBoring\n, which said it recently completed a two-week co-op program with the University of Austin. Ten students worked \u201caround the clock on real-world underground detection and communication technologies,\u201d the tunneling firm said in the post. Neither the university nor Boring provided additional details about the facility, and representatives for the school, the company and Bastrop County did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the publication.\nThe lab appears to be the latest piece of development tied to Musk along a rapidly transforming stretch of land near the Colorado River. Since 2021, Musk-linked entities have assembled close to 700 acres in\nBastrop County\n, creating a campus-like environment that now includes headquarters for\nBoring and X\n, a growing SpaceX manufacturing operation, housing, a private school, retail amenities and other infrastructure. Much of what\u2019s happening there has emerged through social media breadcrumbs, public filings and piecemeal reporting.\nRumors have circulated for months that the University of Austin was aligning itself with Musk\u2019s companies and planning a Bastrop presence. The university, founded in 2021 and currently operating out of the Scarborough Building downtown, is not accredited, but has leaned heavily into applied sciences, free speech branding and high-profile partnerships.\nProperty records suggest the new lab is being built on land tied to Musk\u2019s orbit. An Austin-based entity called Bastrop Property Trust acquired a 29-acre site across Walker Watson Road from Boring\u2019s headquarters in 2024. While ownership details are obscured, the deed traces back to a\nBoca Chica\nlaw firm known for representing Musk-affiliated entities in both Cameron and Bastrop counties.\nThe University of Austin was founded by a roster of prominent conservative thinkers and media figures, including CBS News\u2019 editor-in-chief Bari Weiss, venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale and historian Niall Ferguson, all of whom remain on its board. The school recently announced a $100 million donation from billionaire trader Jeffrey Yass as part of a $300 million fundraising push.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

That\u2019s a 56 percent decline from the property\u2019s 2015 valuation of $770 million.\nRudin declined to comment.\nThe reappraisal comes a month after the company landed a\nfour-year extension\non its $425 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan at the property. The debt\nhit special servicing\nin September due to \u201cimminent maturity default\u201d after a representative for Rudin requested the transfer to allow for negotiations to kick off for a loan modification.\nThose negotiations resulted in a four-year extension, which includes two one-year renewal options, pushing the debt maturity as far back as November 2029. Rudin will also invest $100 million in capital improvements, renovating the lobby, adding an on-site leasing center and elevating the street-level retail.\nRudin bought the former AT&amp;T headquarters in 1999 for $150 million and invested $100 million into the building, which was near full occupancy a decade ago. Rudin borrowed $425 million to refinance the property in 2015 with a CMBS-backed loan underwritten by JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank.\nBut occupancy\ndropped sharply\nduring the pandemic and was at only 57 percent as of June, according to Fitch Ratings. CenturyLink Communications downsized significantly in 2021; Dentsu Holdings USA also downsized and ultimately relocated; and iHeartMedia division AMFM Operating also moved locations when its lease expired in 2022.\nThe largest tenant at the 28-story, 1.2-million-square-foot building is tech company Telx, whose 146,000-square-foot lease expires in 2033, per Morningstar. Remaining tenants also include Cedar Cares and MCI Communications Services. Dorilton and Industrious\nsigned a 52,000-square-foot lease\nfor the 13th floor back in 2021.\n",

They total $183.2 million in asking dollar volume.\nFain and his wife, Colleen, own the 10,840-square-foot mansion at 700 Arvida Parkway, which topped the report.

The 7,635-square-foot house is asking nearly $30 million with Douglas Elliman\u2019s Dina Goldentayer and Joel Lusky of The Brokerage South Florida.

        "content": "Even in Chicago\u2019s hot multifamily market, some buyers are scoring discounts.\nIn a deal that signals caution to condo deconversion specialists, Laramar Group bought the Wave Lakeview apartments from Strategic Properties of North America for $57 million. The seller last refinanced the property for $62 million in 2019, public records show. .\nSPNA converted the nearly 60-year-old building from condos to apartments in 2017 and took out a $46 million loan from Ladder Capital to help fund the deconversion, according to public records.\nSPNA, based in Lakewood, New Jersey and Skokie, and led by Saul Kupperwasser and Yitzy Klor, has had a consistent presence in downtown Chicago real estate for more than a decade. Many of the company\u2019s biggest deals in the city have been condo deconversions.\nIt\u2019s unclear how much total capital SPNA put into the deconversion of the Wave Lakeview at 420 West Belmont, or if the company paid down the principal on its latest $62 million note from MF1 before selling the property to Laramar this month.\nFor Chicago-based Laramar, led by CEO Jeffrey Elowe, the discounted purchase could spell a win. Chicago\u2019s multifamily market has\nbeen heating up throughout this year\n, topping national rent growth charts.\nWave Lakeview, in the upscale northside neighborhood of Lakeview, consists of 88 studios, 98 one-bedroom/one-bathroom apartments, and 20 two-bedroom/one-bathroom units. It also includes ground-floor retail space and an indoor pool.\nStill, the building has faced its share of challenges. Loan records indicate Wave Lakeview struggled to generate income for SPNA while it owned and operated it.\nWhen SPNA refinanced the 30-story, 207-unit property with MF1 in 2019, the lender bundled the $62 million debt into a collateralized loan obligation package, public records show. Doing so made some of the loan\u2019s details public.\nThe loan was watchlisted by its servicer in May 2021 for having a debt-to-service coverage ratio under 1, meaning the building\u2019s income was not covering its operating costs, according to commercial debt tracker MorningStar Credit.\nIt was later removed from the watchlist in August 2021 when SPNA secured an extension on the loan.\nThe current health of the loan is harder to determine because MF1 appears to have taken the debt off the public market at some point in 2022.\nRepresentatives of MF1 and SPNA did not respond to requests for comment. A representative of Laramar declined to comment.\nThe sale follows SPNA\u2019s attempts and failures to initiate two new condo deconversion deals in Chicago.\nThe company bought dozens of condos at the 467-unit Ontario Place in River North, but after three years of negotiations,\nfailed to close a $190 million purchase of the remaining units\n. The deal imploded in June 2023 when SPNA failed to put up $700,000 as a show of good faith to the remaining sellers.\nIn 2024, SPNA\nfumbled a second condo deconversion deal at the building at 200 North Dearborn\n. The condo board voted to terminate an agreement with SPNA to sell the remaining units for $90 million, after the company failed repeatedly to secure the financing needed to close the deal.\nSPNA\u2019s sale of the Wave is likely part of\na broader strategy to sell off existing properties\n.\nIn October, the company also\nlisted the K Square Apartments\nin Lincoln Park. SPNA converted the 22-story, 268-unit property from condos to rentals in 2018, and listed the building for sale in 2023 with CBRE, before eventually taking it off the market. It is now listed with Berkadia brokers Nick Harris, Pete Evans and Richard Evans.",

        "content": "Selling an Upper East Side townhouse can be a lot like turning around a supertanker.\nThe palatial homes often sit on the market for years as listing agents nudge them into shape: replace the turn-of-the-century finishes, modernize appliances, and of course, whittle away at the price.\nWhen one sells, it is no small feat.\nThe home at 4 East 79th Street achieved such a victory in September 2024, selling for $56 million, the seventh-highest price fetched for a townhouse in the city\u2019s history. But the property reappeared on the market in November, seeking another peak price.\nThe home, listed by\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Serena Boardman\n, is now asking $68 million, making it one of the most expensive townhouses on the market in the city. Spanning over 15,000 square feet, the 35-foot-wide limestone mansion is again being marketed as a single-family residence, according to a new listing for the property.\nThe seller is American-Irish billionaire John Grayken, who founded distressed debt investor Lone Star Funds and\nserves as chairman of the board\n, sources familiar with the original sale told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe reasons for the re-listing aren\u2019t entirely clear. Grayken, who reportedly\nrenounced his American citizenship\nin 1999 for tax purposes and spends most of his time in London, had bought the home with plans to move in before changing course, sources told\nTRD\n.\nGrayken did not respond to a request for comment and a spokesperson for Lone Star declined to comment.\nBoardman did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe first three floors hold entertaining spaces, including a reception room, living room and formal dining room, and the building features solid mahogany doors and windows, bespoke marble paneling and floors, English brown oak paneling, and parquet de Versailles and herringbone white oak floors, according to the listing.\nThe home is also one of the few in the area with triple exposures due to a small strip of land on its western edge, which allows it to look out onto Central Park through a set of large western windows.\nThe previous owner, the late business magnate Aso Tavitian, bought the home in 1997 and commissioned a gut renovation from architects Peter Pennoyer and Theodore Prudon that was finished in 2004.\nAfter Tavitian died in 2020, his estate listed the home at $65 million in 2023. Boardman had the listing as well.\nThe latest $68 million asking price has raised some eyebrows, given the short turnaround time from when it last sold for $12 million less.\nThe listing states that the house has been \u201cupdated to include all new systems\u201d as of 2025, including \u201csecurity, temperature/humidity, audio, lighting, and AV, as well as a new kitchen, bathrooms, and other changes.\u201d\nBut some brokers expressed skepticism at the new price. \u201cAnybody who can afford that home knows how long that takes,\u201d one agent said of a potential $12 million renovation.\nAnother summed up the name of the game when it comes to finding a buyer and moving a trophy townhouse: \u201call you need is one.\u201d\nTricky trades in the neighborhood\nThe Upper East Side townhouse market has been relatively active this year, driven by a number of homes that cut asking prices before finding a buyer. There have been 63 sales recorded through the end of September this year, up 37 percent from last year, according to a market report from Leslie Garfield.\nBut the average sale price has fallen 23 percent to roughly $9 million, and the average price per square foot has fallen 10 percent to $1,582.\nOne of the other few Gilded Age mansions set up as a single-family at 973 Fifth Avenue\nclosed for $46 million in May\nafter initially asking $80 million in 2021. The home underwent a series of price drops until it found a buyer at its\nfinal asking price of $49.9 million\nin February.\nThe Woolworth Mansion at 4 East 80th Street endured an even longer waiting period, initially hitting the market in 2011 for $90 million. It\nfound a buyer in October\nafter chopping the asking price down to\n$50 million in March\nof this year, closing for $38 million in November.\nAnother Gilded Age manse at 10 East 67th\nsold for $36 million\nin October after originally asking $50 million in 2024.\nBut Grayken can\u2019t be faulted for trying to turn a profit: A\nTRD\nanalysis found that of the 18 houses on the Upper East Side, only three have sold for less than their previous purchase price.\nIn addition to his Upper East Side purchase, Grayken bought a\n$35 million penthouse\nin Boston in 2016, setting a record at the time for the most expensive condo sold in the city.\nGrayken\u2019s firm, Lonestar, has remained active as well,\nraising a $2.7 billion fund in 2024\n. It recently bought a downtown Denver tower for $132.5 million and partnered on the purchase of Fort Lauderdale\u2019s\nBank of America Plaza\nfor $221 million. The firm is also\nreportedly circling a 20-story San Francisco tower\nonce owned by WeWork.",

The grocery chain paid $616 per square foot for the 134,800-square-foot retail plaza, and $32 million above the previous sale price a decade ago.\nAn affiliate of Atlanta-based Jamestown, led by Matt Bronfman, was the buyer. Jamestown paid\n$50.6 million\na decade ago for Polo Club Shops, which was completed in 1988 on 14.2 acres, records show. A Cushman &amp; Wakefield team led by Mark Gilbert and Adam Feinstein represented the seller.\nJamestown completed a major overhaul of the shopping center in 2022, including demolition and reconstruction of the Publix supermarket, which expanded to 48,400 square feet under a 20-year lease.\nPolo Club Shops is 97 percent leased with other tenants including Bolay, AT&amp;T, Chase Bank and The UPS Store.\nThe deal underscores Publix\u2019s strategy in acquiring shopping centers anchored by its supermarkets, giving the company more control over its sites and rental income from neighboring tenants.\nThe Polo Club Shops purchase comes just two months after Publix paid\n$71.9 million\nfor Hammocks Town Center in Kendall, an unincorporated neighborhood in southwest Miami-Dade County. The 207,500-square-foot shopping center is anchored by a Publix store. That acquisition did not include five outparcels separately owned by other entities such as Bank of America and McDonald\u2019s.\nIncluding Polo Club Shops, Publix has spent nearly $428 million since May of last year acquiring a standalone store and eight Publix-anchored shopping centers across South Florida. Previous purchases include retail sites in Coral Springs, Davie, Lake Worth Beach and Royal Palm Beach, as well as $40 million for a\nNorth Miami strip mall\nand $25 million for a property adjacent to the\nGaleria Fort Lauderdale\nmall.",

        "content": "Dalian Wanda Group, an early co-developer of the St. Regis Chicago, sold a group of condos at the downtown high-rise.\nProperty records show the Chinese conglomerate sold the units at the 101-story skyscraper at 363 East Wacker Drive for $47.5 million. Completed in 2020, the building has 393 units, along with a 192-key hotel operated by Marriott International.\nWang Jianlin\u2019s Wanda Group owned 37 condos in the building and had previously\nmarketed them as a bulk sale\n. It\u2019s not clear whether the sale included all 37 units or only a portion of them. For the full group, the sale price would come out to $1.3 million per unit.\nThe sale price and the buyer and seller were recorded in a state database of property transfers, but\nThe Real Deal\nwas not able to obtain the deed with additional details. Wanda Group could not be reached for comment.\nThe buyer of the condos is listed as CPE Stage Investments in state records. CPE is the name of a Chinese investment firm, previously known as CITIC Private Equity, but\nTRD\nwas not able to confirm the buyer\u2019s identity.\nWanda Group put up the group of condos for sale in March, originally tapping Newmark to market the properties. Chuck Johanns of Newmark said the firm was not involved in the final sale.\nThe bulk offering included five one-bedroom units, five two-bedrooms, 18 three-bedrooms, five four-bedrooms and four penthouses. The condos were never listed for sale individually before being put up as a group.\nWanda originally invested in the Jeanne Gang-designed skyscraper in 2016 alongside Chicago-based Magellan Development Group, intending to use the building for its first U.S.-based hotel under the Wanda Vista brand. After China\ntightened regulations on overseas investments\n, Wanda sold its 90 percent stake in the building to Magellan in 2020 for $270 million.\nThe bulk sale comes a year after Magellan\nsold its remaining 84 units\nto Denver-based GD Holdings, the real estate arm of Mexican clothing company Grupo Denim. Those condos sold for $117 million, about $3.2 million per unit.\nThe St. Regis has picked up momentum this year after a long slump in the downtown condo market. A\n79th-floor penthouse sold\nfor $7.5 million in September. In October, Siri co-founder Dag Kittlaus bought an 84th-floor penthouse there for $9.25 million, property records show.\nBoth purchases came from GD Holdings\u2019 portfolio, and at least five more GD Holdings units have sold for more than $5 million each this year, property records show.\nIn 2022, Mexican mining CEO German Larrea purchased a two-story, 10,000-square-foot penthouse spanning the 71st and 72nd floors\nfor $20 million\n, the priciest sale on record at the building. Other notable sales include the 76th-floor unit that sold for\n$8.3 million in 2025\n, the\n91st floor that sold for $9.2\nmillion and the\n87th floor that sold for $9 million\n, both in 2022.\nThe 78th floor penthouse\nsold for $7 million in 2024\n, a loss for the sellers who purchased it at $8.2 million.\n",

        "content": "A major Chicago-based apartment owner just made one of the city\u2019s biggest real estate bets of the year.\nAmli Residential paid more than $134 million for\nMilieu\n, a 19-story, 275-unit apartment tower at 205 South Peoria Street in the West Loop, according to property records. The deal ranks among the four largest transactions in Chicago so far this year, Costar\nreported\n.\nPacific Life Insurance sold the tower that was built in 2019. Pacific Life developed the project along with White Oak Realty Partners and Crayton Advisors. Pacific Life later bought out its partners and financed the property with an $86 million loan in 2021, Cook County records show.\nThe purchase adds to an already active year for Chicago\u2019s apartment investment market. After a pandemic-era lull, landlords have been testing the waters as construction completions slow and rents in Chicago\ncontinue to outperform\nmost major U.S. markets that were hit harder by overbuilding. Before the Milieu deal, investors had already poured roughly $4.5 billion into Chicago-area multifamily properties in 2025, according to Costar data, more than any full-year total since 2022.\nMilieu sits in a West Loop neighborhood that has become one of the city\u2019s most competitive submarkets, buoyed by office conversions, uptick in the dining scene and proximity to Fulton Market. The building includes 215 parking spaces, a rooftop pool and deck and a full slate of amenities. When JLL brought the property to market in July, occupancy stood at 96 percent, with new leases signed att 5 percent rent increases, year-to-date, according to marketing materials.\nThe Milieu sale trails only a handful of blockbuster deals this year. The largest was the $175 million sale of the 398-unit\nNorth Water Apartments\nin November, the city\u2019s priciest transaction since 2023. Other notable trades include the $170 million sale of the 375-unit\nFulbrix tower\nin Fulton Market, and the $151 million deal for the 451-unit\nLeft Bank apartments\nat 300 North Canal Street.\nAmli was founded in 1980 by Denver-based real estate executive Bob Mutz and Chicago attorney John Allen. It went public in the 1990s and was taken private in a $2.1 billion deal by Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investing in 2006. Today, Amli remains a Morgan Stanley subsidiary with more than 25,000 units across eight U.S. markets.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

An affiliate of Pacific Realty Associates sold the 7-acre property.\nThe business park, known as Pactrust Business Center South, totals 95,000 square feet of offices across seven buildings. Tenants at the site include software company Hawk Ridge Systems, laser makers Lighthouse Photonics and 3D-Micromac America, and medical technology manufacturers Cephasonics and EchoPixel.\nKayne Anderson\u2019s purchase marks the latest property acquisition in the region for the alternative investment management firm.

Earlier this month, an affiliate of Menlo Park Equities proposed turning an office and research building at 300 Holger Way into a 97,800-square-foot data center. The structure has been\nleased by Nvidia\nsince late last year.\nIn October, a\nGoodman Group affiliate bought\na site in north San Jose with plans for a data center.

LBA floated building a tech village with offices, shops, restaurants and a hotel there in 2019, changing course three years later with a proposal for an advanced manufacturing facility, though that project never got off the ground. It submitted a development permit to the city of San Jose earlier this year to build a 207,950-square-foot data center instead.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "Get your bids ready.\nCharles Cohen\u2019s 750 Lexington Avenue\nis set to be auctioned off next month.\nThe auction is the\nresult of a foreclosure lawsuit\nfacing the billionaire behind Cohen Brothers Realty. In a judgment entered earlier this month, a state court ordered the 31-story office building to be foreclosed upon and sold to pay off a $155.9 million loan balance.\nThe sale is scheduled for January 21 at 2:15 pm at the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, according to Joshua Stein, the referee for the auction. The buyer will be entitled to the leasehold on the property as well as the borrower\u2019s interest in the underlying land.\nThe building at 750 Lexington is one of Cohen Brothers\u2019 legacy properties, developed by the family in the 1980s and the site of the company\u2019s office. A borrower connected to Cohen took out $130 million on the leasehold in 2015.\nBut trouble began just a few years later. Tenants began vacating during the pandemic as Cohen fell behind on payments, according to information from Morningstar Credit. In 2023, beleaguered coworking company WeWork stopped paying rent. When the company declared bankruptcy, Cohen negotiated a lease amendment.\nBut the most recent net operating income reported by the property was just $1.8 million in 12 months, a drop of about 86 percent since the loan was underwritten. The appraised value of the property has fallen by a similar percentage in that time, from\n$300 million to $41 million\n, according to Morningstar. Debt service has been more than annual net operating income since 2021.\nIn 2024, the loan\u2019s special servicer launched a foreclosure suit, accusing the borrower of falling behind on taxes and financial statements. The lender also accused Cohen, who served as a limited guarantor on the loan, of failing to submit documents showing his net worth and liquidity.\nIn July, a judge\nawarded the lender a summary judgment\n. The borrower now owes $155.9 million, according to court documents, nearly $25 million more than the original loan.\nAttorneys for the borrower and for Cohen Brothers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe office tower is the latest to be lost or sold by Cohen\u2019s entities. Last year he was ordered to pay lender Fortress Credit $187 million after a down-and-out court battle related to loan defaults. In an effort to pay off that judgment, Cohen has been\nmarketing his buildings\n. In August, Vornado Realty Trust announced it would\nbuy 623 Fifth Avenue\nfor $218 million. Cohen also agreed to sell\n3 East 54th Street\nto a mystery buyer for $188 million.\n",

But today the building is about half empty, making it a strong candidate for a residential conversion.\nBushburg is already at work on one of the city\u2019s largest conversion projects nearby at 80 Pine Street, which the developer is turning into\nmore than 700 apartments\n.\nRepresentatives for Bushburg and Manulife could not be immediately reached for comment. An Eastdil Secured team led by Will Silverman and Gary Phillips negotiated the sale.\nManulife, Canada\u2019s largest insurer, bought the Emery Roth-designed building in 2013 from Japanese property developer Mitsui Fudosan.\nIt was a time when, similar to today, many office buildings in the Financial District were being converted into residential, which helped improve fundamentals for the remaining commercial properties in the area.\n\u201cThere\u2019s quite a bit of activity right now converting Class-A offices in the financial district into residential,\u201d Manulife chief investment officer\nWarren Thomson\ntold Bloomberg at the time of the purchase. \u201cThose conversions start to reduce the supply. We think it\u2019s going to be an interesting market for commercial rates. There should be some good pricing over time.\u201d\nIndeed, Lower Manhattan\u2019s office market improved through the 2010s and much of the conversion activity ceased.\nBut in the wake of the pandemic, many office buildings have struggled, and enterprising developers have snapped up properties at bargain prices for conversions.\nBushburg last year bought the 1.2 million-square-foot building at 80 Pine Street from Rudin for $160 million. The 40-story office tower was about half empty, and Hoffman\u2019s company quickly got started working on converting floors 2 through 17 into 713 rental apartments.\nBushburg this summer landed a $320 million construction loan for the project from\nBridge City Capital\nand Deutsche Bank.\n",

Each monitor will report to the Commission every three months, providing updates on the teams\u2019 progress in delivering on the various pledges they made to secure approval.\nCommission Chair Brian O\u2019Dwyer confirmed that this includes promises that the teams made both formally in their applications, as well as those made publicly but left out of official paperwork. He said failing to live up to these promises could result in a team losing its license.\nWith that in mind, here\u2019s a refresher on some of the promises the casino teams made:\nMetropolitan Park ($5.3 billion capital investment)\n\u2014\n$1 billion in community benefits, which includes a $163 million community impact fund and $50 million for local health, youth and senior services\n\u2014 25 acres of new park space\n\u2014 450 affordable apartments offsite on a parking lot in Corona (in\npartnership\nwith Slate Property Group)\n\u2014 Development of the Flushing SkyPark and a new pedestrian bridge (which were\ncritical\nin gaining key legislative support)\n\u2014 $60 million for a Taste of Queens food hall as part of one of the facility\u2019s parking garages\nBally\u2019s ($2.3 billion capital investment)\n\u2014 70 percent of construction and facility jobs will go to Bronx residents (the company is projecting 15,000 construction jobs, nearly 4,000 permanent positions)\n\u2014 Annual contribution of 1 percent of gross gaming revenue (minimum of $15 million) to a community benefits fund, starting when the gaming facility opens\n\u2014 Overall pledge of $625 million in community benefits, including $100 million for parkland improvements and the revitalization of Ferry Point Park, $75 million for transportation upgrades and\u00a0$10 million for new NYPD substations and increased police presence in the area\n\u2014\u00a0An equity ownership initiative where local residents can buy an equity interest in the project, creating an up to 9 percent community ownership stake\nResorts World ($3.3 billion capital investment)\n\u2014 For the duration of its license, annual contributions of the lesser of: 2 percent of incremental gross gaming revenue above 2025 levels, or $25 million per year, for a workforce housing fund (this is part of a partnership with Cirrus Real Estate, which is projected to result in up to 50,000 workforce housing units being built citywide)\n\u2014\u00a0An initial $25 million for its Resorts World Gives program, with up to $5 million each year after that\n\u2014\u00a0An initial $50 million investment in the \u201cdesign and preconstruction programming\u201d of an \u201cInnovation Campus\u201d on Rockaway Boulevard (annual contributions after that will be the lesser of 2 percent of incremental gross gaming revenue above 2025 levels or $25 million)\n\u2014\u00a0$100 million for infrastructure improvements\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat do you think about the\nhousing-related\nCity Council bills potentially heading to a vote this week?

My colleague Emma Whalen\nbroke down\nwhat the ordinance meant for the deal (which did not result in tenants buying the building).\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nThe MTA plans to spend $7.3 million on installing turnstile paddles and spikes at nearly every subway station,\nGothamist reports\n.

The City of Los Angeles pays for these efforts using\nFederal Emergency Management Agency\nand Office of Emergency Services funds managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\u201cNearly a year after the fire, 99.8 percent of the Palisades burn zone has been cleared, yet these remaining properties are still sitting in toxic limbo, and that is unacceptable,\u201d Park said. \u201cThe community did everything right, the city did everything it could within its authority, and yet a handful of owners have allowed hazardous debris to remain despite repeated notices and a formal nuisance abatement.\u201d\nThe goal, Park said, is to \u201cidentify funding so we can step in, clean these sites ourselves, and finally move recovery forward.\u201d\nThe properties in question were abated and declared public nuisances in October. Those sites include the\nPacific Palisades Bowl Mobile Home Park\nand the remains of a\nmansion featured on HBO\u2019s \u201cSuccession\u201d\ncontaining hazardous waste. As of mid-October 2025, debris removal had been completed on 4,487 of the parcels charred by the fire, leaving 11 sites uncleared.\nOn the other side of town, cleanup efforts following the Eaton fire wrapped several months ago. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\ncompleted debris removal\nin Altadena and the surrounding area in August.\nIf the motion is approved in committee, it would advance to the full city council for a final greenlight.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A multifamily mega-sale is taking shape in Chicago.\nDenver-based Apartment Investment and Management Company, better known as Aimco, is selling its portfolio of seven rental complexes across the Chicago area for $455 million.\nLaTerra Capital, based in Marina Del Ray, California, and Respark Residential, based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, are buying the properties, Aimco announced Monday. The deal amounts to a sale of all Aimco\u2019s Chicago-area apartment buildings as the company looks to wind down entirely.\nThe transaction would be among the largest in Chicago this year.\nThe buyers have completed due diligence and agreed to provide a non-refundable deposit that will total $20 million by January 15. Closing is scheduled for the first quarter of 2026, according to Aimco.\nLaTerra and Respark plan to assume the properties\u2019 current loans, a news release said.\nThe sale is part of Aimco\u2019s\nliquidation process\nwhich began in November. As of last month, the operator had 15 properties left to sell while it ceased operations.\nThe $455 million transaction will come out to about $304,000 per unit. The buyers are coming to the market at an advantageous time. The Chicago area has notched\nsome of the strongest rent growth in the country\nthis year.\nFactoring in debt and transaction costs, net proceeds for Aimco from the Chicago portfolio sale are expected to land at $160 million, the release stated.\nThe seven Chicago-area properties included in the sale to LaTerra and Respark are the following:\nHyde Park Tower\n5140 South Hyde Park Boulevard, Chicago\nElm Creek Apartments\n1 Elm Creek Drive, Elmhurst\nEldridge Townhomes\n1 Elm Creek Drive, Elmhurst\nWillow Bend Apartment Homes\n2850 Southampton Drive, Rolling Meadows\nEvanston Place Apartments\n1715 Chicago Avenue, Evanston,\nYorktown Apartment Homes\n2233 South Highland Avenue, Lombard\n2200 Grace Apartments\n2200 South Grace Street, Lombard\nAimco finalized plans to sell off all of its assets across the country last month. The decision was the conclusion of a nearly year-long saga that began after the firm started a strategic review of options in January.\nThe review process involved Aimco speaking with more than 100 firms, including financial sponsors, investment managers, public real estate investment trusts and private real estate firms. This year alone, the company saw a 1.9 percent decline in property net operating income compared to last year; at the same time, property expenses increased 1.1 percent and average occupancy fell from the prior quarter to 94.8 percent.\nAimco has lost more than 30 percent of its stock value this year. The decline in stock price matches up with the value distributed via dividends of $2.83 per share.\nAt the end of September, it had $404 million in cash on hand and $748M in debt, including mortgages backing properties.\nRecent Aimco sales include a deal in August\nto sell five New England residential communities\nto Harbor Group International for $740 million. It\u2019s also under contract to sell\na multifamily and office assemblage on the Miami waterfront\nfor $520 million; that deal is set to close next month in what would be a record sale for the seaside city.\n",

        "content": "Fannie Mae\u2019s move to foreclose on a nine-property portfolio on the South Side of Chicago is shedding light on real estate deals with ties to an\nEast Coast hotspot\nfor commercial mortgage fraud.\nThe government-backed mortgage company alleges in Cook County Circuit Court that the property sales are linked to investor Israel Bialostozky, and his company is in default on an $18 million loan tied to the buildings in the Chatham, Englewood, South Chicago and Brainerd neighborhoods.\nThe Fannie Mae foreclosure follows Bialostozky\u2019s 2023 purchase of the underlying real estate from a Lakewood, New Jersey-based investor named Chaim Joseph Bialostozky, public records show.\nFannie\u2019s foreclosure suit involves a total of 291 apartments across the nine-property portfolio.\nTwo companies, Gray Portfolio Investment 1 and Gray Portfolio Holdings, both tied to investors with the last names of Bialostozky, were involved in the building sales in 2023 that preceded the foreclosure, records show.\nThe latter company is linked to\nChaim Bialostozky\nof Lakewood, New Jersey. The firm sold the nine-building portfolio to the current owner, the company managed by Israel Bialostozky, for $24 million in 2023, according to public property records.\nThat sale came after Chaim Bialostozky purchased the real estate in 2022 through a series of deals. The sellers in those deals were Lakewood-based LLCs, almost all of which were managed by people (or perhaps the same person) named Avraham Levin, Yaakov Levin, or Avraham Yaakov Levin, for a total of more than $22 million, records show. (Several other Lakewood-based investors who have faced distress have interchangeably used first and middle names on Chicago property documents.)\nChaim Bialostozky\u2019s LLC soon racked up building code violation complaints from the city of Chicago on the properties. As of July, the city of Chicago was still claiming that a Joseph Bialostozky \u2014 a name Chaim also appears to be called, according to public records showing his ties to the same\nLakewood\naddress \u2014 still owed over $34,000 for failure to pay debts owed to the city stemming from building code violation court orders. According to public records, those issues, tied to 7851 South Avalon Avenue and 1234 East 79th Street, remain unresolved.\nThe portfolio\u2019s current owner, the LLC managed by Israel Bialostozky, triggered Fannie\u2019s foreclosure lawsuit by allegedly \u201cfailing to maintain and repair the property, failing to keep the property in good repair and marketable condition, and failing to promptly repair damaged parts of the property,\u201d the lender\u2019s complaint said. The fact the city is pursuing code enforcement violations against the landlord constitutes another default of the loan agreement, the records show.\nIt\u2019s unusual for building code violations to trigger lender foreclosure actions, though such lawsuits tend to be filed when property conditions are particularly dire. Furthermore, Israel Bialostozky has been accused of failing to deposit more than $3.8 million into a lender-controlled account meant to address \u201csubstantial deficiencies in the physical conditions of the property.\u201d He was supposed to deposit the funds in February, the lawsuit shows.\nAside from Fannie Mae\u2019s foreclosure lawsuit against the Gray Portfolio properties, nearly 300 additional Chicago apartments are still owned by LLCs held by Chaim Bialostozky that he purchased from Levin, property records show. Chaim Bialostozky\u2019s portfolio once totaled nearly 600 units, before he sold the buildings now facing foreclosure to Israel Bialostozky.\nChaim Bialostozky used a $17.6 million Fannie-backed loan provided by New York-based\nArbor Realty\nto buy the nine properties from Levin for $22 million in 2022 that are now facing foreclosure. Then the next year, Israel Bialostozky used a $17.8 million Fannie loan provided by Greystone to support his purchase of the same nine buildings from Chaim Bialostozky, which was recorded as a $24 million sale, records show.\nIsrael Bialostozky paid a higher price, despite building code violations also emerging at his buildings shortly after buying them, records show.\nIt\u2019s unclear if the Bialostozkys are related, though public record databases show they have shared the same Lakewood address.\nIsrael Bialostozky didn\u2019t return multiple emails requesting comment, and Fannie Mae didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nRegardless, the transfers and their rising valuations, despite the emergence of city building code enforcement action \u2014\u00a0and an apparent lack of building permit and construction activity in between the sales \u2014 combine to raise concerns about the nature of the relationships between the recent buyers and sellers of these properties.\nLawsuits follow Bialostozky\nLakewood has become a nexus for investors who bought commercial properties in\nChicago and throughout the Midwest\n, and then rapidly flipped them, sometimes between related parties, allegedly in order to load up buildings with loans well above assessed values and own real estate with no money down. Neither Bialostozky has been accused of criminal wrongdoing.\nChaim Bialostozky appears to have been in the same orbit as\nMark Nussbaum\n\u2014 the New York real estate attorney now under indictment for suspected grand larceny tied to allegedly missing escrow funds. Deals tied to Nussbaum and his Chicago partners used\nrapid flips and unusual financing\nto extract outsized loans against modest buildings, records show.\nIn an alternative bankruptcy proceeding, Nussbaum recently listed a\nJ. Bialostozky as a debtor\nwho owes the indicted lawyer over $1.2 million (Chaim Bialostozky is also known as Joseph, according to active litigation involving the Lakewood-based investor). Other borrowers with Lakewood ties who have faced pressure from lenders \u2014 such as\nShaya Prager\n, who has been plagued by commercial property distress across the nation, including suburban Chicago\u00a0\u2014 were also listed by Nussbaum as debtors.\nEarlier this year, an entity called Mount Dora sued Nussbaum\u2019s former firm, Nussbaum Lowinger \u2014 which has since been shut down \u2014 claiming the firm executed fraudulent transfers involving Chaim Bialostozky to avoid paying a judgment.\nThe dispute was over a $6.15 million judgment Mount Dora was awarded in 2022 against Timothy Majors and Hobart Investments in Florida. The Mount Dora entity was seeking to collect $2.9 million. Furthermore, the lawsuit alleged that Majors was involved in the 2022 sale of properties in Bradenton and Daytona Beach, Florida, to Dr. Harry Nyanteh and an affiliate of Lakewood investor Chaim Bialostozky.\nA Majors-controlled company has since filed a separate lawsuit against Chaim Bialostozky and an entity called Gray Portfolio 2 LLC over Florida real estate disputes. Bialostozky is seeking to have the case dismissed and has denied that he improperly took funds that Majors is seeking. That case is still pending in a Delaware court.\nBack in Chicago, Fannie Mae is seeking to have the court appoint\nMatthew Tarshis of Frontline Real Estate Partners\nas a receiver for the nine-property portfolio. Fannie has said it doesn\u2019t offer to accept title to the real estate to satisfy Israel Bialostozky\u2019s firm\u2019s debt.\n",

The concept leans heavily on Jordan\u2019s legacy of excellence without using his name, inviting visitors to \u201cexperience greatness\u201d through programming centered on mindset, action and service, according to the application.\nCooper\u2019s new proposal follows a\nSeptember setback\n, when the Highland Park City Council blocked his initial plan to sell million-dollar shares in the property through a\nfractional ownership\nsetup. Officials amended the zoning code to ban timeshares in single-family homes, a move aimed squarely at Cooper\u2019s idea. The estate is also listed as a conventional rental for $89,000 a month with a nine-month minimum.\nThe revised vision still requires zoning relief. City staff said Cooper is requesting \u201ca new type of land use\u201d that would allow the home to operate as a tourist destination, offering tours and access to amenities like the indoor basketball court and pool. The discussion is scheduled before the council as a committee of the whole, meaning no vote is expected.\nA key piece is a proposed partnership with the neighboring\nHeller Nature Center\n, a 97-acre park district property that borders the estate. Cooper\u2019s plan would shuttle visitors to Heller\u2019s parking lot and funnel them along existing trails to the house, a move aimed at reducing traffic on Point Lane, a quiet cul-de-sac with just seven homes.\nThe proposal also calls for moving the iconic No. 23 displayed on the front gate to an interior spot, another nod to neighbors\u2019 concerns. Cooper said he also wants to launch a nonprofit, Champions Legacy, focused on youth programming, though it\u2019s unclear how that would affect the property\u2019s tax status. The estate\u2019s annual tax bill is about $138,000.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A stalled\nEast Austin mixed-use project\nis back in business.\nLV Collective, an Austin-based multifamily developer with a specialty in student housing, plans to start construction on the 476-unit project at 2700 East Fifth Street in June, according to a Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation filing.\nNewly named The Right Angle, the wedge-shaped building will occupy a triangular plot between Fifth Street, Pleasant Valley Road and the Austin Area Terminal Railroad. The project has an estimated cost of $106 million and is slated for completion in September 2028, the filing shows.\nLV Collective, formerly known as Lincoln Ventures, previously planned a mixed-use project with more units and a higher construction cost at the same site.\nThe company acquired the 4.3-acre plot in 2021, according to county records, and soon thereafter\nannounced plans for a mixed-use community\nthat would include townhouses, duplexes, two levels of co-working space, a grocery store and 625 residential rental units. Billed amenities included a pet spa and a catering kitchen. The original construction cost was almost $134 million. LV had hoped to finish the project by the summer of 2024.\nThe updated project will still be mixed-use, according to Colby Wallis, the firm\u2019s construction and development vice president. The number of townhomes and duplexes hasn\u2019t been specified.\nLV Collective is best known for\nMoontower\n, Waterloo and other student housing developments in Austin. LV also built the\nPaseo\n, a high-rise at 80 Rainey Street.\nDallas firm WDG Architecture will design The Right Angle project, according to the TDLR filing.\nAustin is recovering from a\nmultifamily building spree\nthat drove occupancy and rents down. Multifamily developers completed about 16,000 units last year, suppressing rents by about 5 percent compared to 2023.\nLV Collective CEO David Kanne couldn\u2019t be reached to elaborate on the reduced plan for The Right Angle, but he said\nearlier this year\nthat grocery, retail and office developments would meet a stronger demand than a strictly residential rental development.",

        "content": "Two prime redevelopment sites on the eastern edge of downtown Austin are stirring fresh speculation about what could rise next \u2014 and how dramatically they could reshape a fast-changing stretch near I-35.\nThe most visible question mark sits where the Frank Erwin Center once stood. Bulldozers wiped the drum-shaped arena from Austin\u2019s skyline last year, leaving a fenced-off, 19-acre site north of 15th Street on Red River at 1701 Red River Street. The land was long expected to host the future UT Medical Center, a joint effort between the University of Texas at Austin and MD Anderson Cancer Center,\naccording\nto the Austin Business Journal.\nThat plan is no longer a lock. The UT System\u2019s board of regents is now weighing an alternative site near\nThe Domain\nin North Austin, raising the prospect that the\nErwin Center\nparcel could be redeployed for something else entirely. UT System\u2019s board chairman, Kevin Eltife, said in November that the system is looking for a larger canvas to build \u201ca district for the future,\u201d language that has only amplified uncertainty about the downtown site\u2019s fate.\nWith the hospital no longer guaranteed, sources say the Erwin Center land could accommodate a range of uses, from academic and research facilities to civic or cultural projects. The site\u2019s scale, proximity to downtown and to I-35 make it one of the most consequential redevelopment opportunities in the urban core, even as highway expansion and infrastructure constraints complicate development.\nJust south of the Erwin site, another major property is quietly being teed up. Austin City Council approved a rezoning this month for the former Teacher Retirement System of Texas headquarters at 1000 Red River Street, clearing the way for a uniform downtown mixed-use designation across the 4-acre block, the Journal\nreported\n. City documents say the change allows office, residential, commercial and life sciences uses and removes regulatory friction that had limited redevelopment.\nAustin Real Estate Acquisitions LLC, which shares an address with life sciences-focused developer\nAlexandria Real Estate Equities\n, a Pasadena-based REIT, acquired the property in 2022 for $108 million. While the owner has not disclosed specific plans, local business groups have been told the site could support medical or life sciences uses that complement Dell Medical School and the nearby Innovation Tower.\nTogether, the two sites sit at the nexus of multiple megaprojects: the I-35 expansion, the planned redevelopment of the\nAustin Convention Center\n, the buildout of Waterloo Greenway and UT\u2019s forthcoming multipurpose arena north of Erwin Center.\nMarket realities will matter. Office development remains a tough sell in Austin, where vacancy hovered above 26 percent in the third quarter, and millions of square feet remain available. UT\u2019s own Innovation Tower, completed in 2022, is still largely unleased, highlighting the challenge of launching new office buildings without surrounding amenities.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "\u201cSometimes I get the urge to exercise,\u201d the famously rotund basketball coach Frank Layden once said, \u201cbut I lie down and it passes.\u201d\nSometimes I get the urge to write about good things happening in real estate. But I think for a moment and it passes. There is just too much foolishness going on.\nToday\u2019s example comes from Long Island\u2019s North Fork.\nWe\u2019ll start with the good news. Nearly every hospitality site on this bucolic peninsula has been upgraded in recent years.\nLongtime owners and\nnew investors\n\u2014 mom-and-pops, private equity funds, even the magnate\nStefan Soloviev\n\u2014 are capitalizing on strong demand to visit the North Fork, which stretches from Riverhead to Orient Point, opposite the Hamptons.\nThe supply of hotel rooms, however, is still tight enough that some venues can charge more than $1,000 a night during the summer. Investors are trying to add more. The problem is, locals make it exceedingly difficult.\nBetween an open space preservation tax and residential zoning, good sites for commercial development are hard to find. And when you do find one, community opposition is a given. Fears of\nHamptonization\n, traffic and changes in the North Fork\u2019s character often prevail.\nAmid this dynamic, a large, potentially glorious piece of land on the Gardiners Bay waterfront has sat moribund for decades. The 18-acre \u201cOki-Do\u201d site in East Marion is perhaps the worst eyesore on the North Fork, thanks to an abandoned oyster processing plant \u2014 a hulking, hideous mass of crumbling concrete surrounded by an ugly fence.\nAn old smokestack completes the pathetic picture.\nVarious plans to redevelop it have not come to fruition. One called for 114 hotel rooms, two dozen rental cottages, two restaurants, an amphitheater and a marina.\nThe latest was from homebuilder Paramount Hamptons and Sal DeLorenzo, who snapped up the land in October 2021 for $6 million and\nannounced plans\nfor 80 condominium units.\nParamount tapped Steven Losquadro, whom Newsday recently described as a \u201c\nconnected Suffolk lawyer\n,\u201d to pitch this plan for quiet Shipyard Lane.\nAs if to make his task even more challenging, Losquadro mentioned workforce housing. Reality check: That is something Long Islanders support in the abstract but rarely in an actual project.\nAn East Marion civic group polled residents and reported that more than 80 percent opposed affordable housing at the Oki-Do site. The town supervisor persuaded the town board in 2022 to change the zoning to attract a hotel and restaurant, but Paramount\u2019s Bill Locantro said he builds homes,\nnot eateries and hotels\n.\nShipyard Lane residents, for their part, said traffic from either project would damage their quality of life. Mind you, this is a dead-end street with more deer than vehicles on most days.\nPut all these ingredients together and you have a recipe for inertia.\nFrom what I can tell, Paramount Homes has not been heard from since. Unfortunately, while the cat was away, the mice came out to play: Southold Town is in the process of changing the site\u2019s zoning from marine to large-lot residential, as the NIMBY neighbors wanted.\nInstead of a classy waterfront hotel and restaurant, the rezoning would allow for a few McMansions, rendering this stretch of waterfront the private domain of second-home owners.\nThat\u2019s the best-case scenario. The worst case is that large-lot zoning so devalues the site that clearing it, remediating any pollution and building houses wouldn\u2019t pencil out. The eyesore would remain for another generation.\n",

        "content": "A long-shuttered legacy hotel in Addison is getting a second life, aiming to appeal to the small town\u2019s businesses and tourists.\nA top-to-bottom renovation by Mehrdad Moayedi\u2019s Centurion American Development Group is nearly complete at the former Crowne Plaza at 14315 Midway Road, rebranding the 426-room property as Hotel Dax. The project will have nearly 32,000 square feet of redesigned meeting space, four new dining concepts, a resort-style pool and a TopGolf Swing Suite, positioning the hotel as a business-and-leisure hybrid aimed at both visitors and locals, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nAn LLC affiliated with\nCenturion\nacquired the property in August, and the hotel is expected to open early next year. The investment marks one of the more significant hospitality upgrades in\nAddison\n, a town of roughly 18,000 known for its dense concentration of restaurants and steady corporate traffic.\nMoayedi\nsaid in a statement that there is demand for higher-quality meeting and event space in Addison, and that Hotel Dax is meant to add options to the town.\nWhile Centurion is best known for master-planned residential communities \u2014 including massive developments underway in Fort Worth, Gunter and Denison \u2014 the firm has a track record with high-profile hotel redevelopments. Most notably, it spearheaded the $255 million restoration of downtown Dallas\u2019 Statler Hotel, reopening the 1950s landmark in 2017 as a luxury, midcentury-inspired destination.\nThe Addison project required a similarly heavy lift. The Crowne Plaza closed in April 2020 amid financial strain and mounting repair costs tied to weather damage. Built in 1984 and renovated as recently as 2013, the hotel previously earned InterContinental Hotels Group\u2019s \u201crenovation of the year\u201d award prior to its decline. Before its Crowne Plaza branding, the property operated as a Harvey Hotel.\nThis time, Centurion gutted the interior entirely, according to a company spokesperson, while keeping the building\u2019s exterior structure largely intact, including its signature glass ceiling. Dallas-based\nMerriman Anderson Architects\nled the interior redesign, and Dreamscape Hospitality will manage the hotel.\nThe new food-and-beverage lineup is central to the repositioning. Concepts include Top Brass, an American bistro with Southern influences; Bar Dax, a social and sports bar; an outdoor pool lounge open to locals as well as for private events; and Brewed, a coffee shop and grab-and-go market. The hotel is also participating in Marriott Bonvoy, tying it into the brand\u2019s global loyalty network.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Three developers with plans to add 1,600 multifamily units to Miami, including some workforce apartments through the Live Local Act, are headed to a city projects review board.\nNamdar Group and Helm Equities each propose a\nLive Local Act\nproject, and Crescent Heights wants to continue its development in Edgewater. Miami\u2019s Urban Development Review Board will vote on the projects on Wednesday.\nThe proposals show an\nunceasing bet\non the Magic City\u2019s rental market, despite a\nsupply overhang\nthat\u2019s gripped South Florida over the past two years following record completions and a slowdown of the influx of out-of-staters. This has all led to slower lease-ups and increased concessions, casting doubt about how the hefty pipeline will fare once it\u2019s completed.\nDevelopers have countered that demand will catch up once they finish their towers, and that they are carefully picking their submarkets to ensure the areas aren\u2019t over-supplied.\nHere\u2019s what the board will consider this week.\nNamdar\u2019s second Magic City bet\nIn the biggest project on the agenda, Great Neck, New York-based\nNamdar Group\nproposes a 42-story Live Local Act tower with 1,011 units in Brickell. It would mark Namdar\u2019s second multifamily project in Miami.\nDesigned by Behar Font &amp; Partners, the tower will include 405 apartments reserved for households earning no more than 120 percent of the area median income. That\u2019s in line with the Live Local Act\u2019s requirement that 40 percent of units are at workforce or affordable rents.\nIt would rise on the vacant 1.03-acre site at 250 and 296 Southwest Seventh Street.\nNamdar, led by Ephraim and Joel Namdar, is asking the city to allow 599 micro-units, which under the city code are to range from 275 square feet to up to 400 square feet.\nThe Live Local Act, a state law approved in 2023 and tweaked in the subsequent two years, allows developers to build up to the biggest density allowed in a jurisdiction and up to the tallest height permitted within a mile as long as they designate 40 percent of units for households earning 120 percent of the AMI or less.\nNamdar isn\u2019t maximizing its development potential, as its project is smaller than the 48 stories and 1,030 units the act allows on its site, according to the firm\u2019s application.\nBaywood Hotels owns the site, records show.\nElsewhere in Brickell, Namdar is developing a pair of multifamily towers with\n1,400 units\ncombined. The firm is expected to complete Phase I with a 43-story, 680-unit tower at 55 Northeast Second Street early next year. In September, Namdar started construction of Phase II\u00a0 with a 43-story, 714-unit tower at 50 Northeast Third Street, which is expected to be completed in 2028.\nHelm plans workforce rentals in lux district\nHelm Equities, an affiliate of New York-based JEMB Realty, tweaked its proposal for a\nLive Local Act\nproject in the Miami Design District.\nThe district, largely developed by Miami Design District Associates, has a reputation as Miami\u2019s top destination for luxury retailers.\nThe firm proposes a 36-story, 278-unit multifamily tower and an adjacent eight-story building with about 101,400 square feet of office space, according to its application.\nDesigned by Cube 3, the project also will have more than 56,400 square feet of retail; a 613-space underground garage; 6,200 square feet of open space; and 13,700 square feet of civic space.\nThe proposal is for the 1.9-acre property at 220 Northeast 43rd Street, a site Helm has owned since 2014. It\u2019s tweaked its proposal several times, most recently planning a six-story, 80,000-square-foot office building. Its\nrecent plan\nalso was for a Live Local Act project.\nThe Gindhi family is a limited partner in the project.\nCrescent\u2019s big bet on Edgewater\nCrescent Heights is making good on its promise to develop its 9-acre holdings in Miami\u2019s\nEdgewater\n.\nThe Miami-based firm \u2013\u2013 led by Sonny Kahn, Russell Galbut and Bruce Menin \u2013\u2013 proposes a 42-story, 360-unit multifamily building and an adjacent six-story commercial building with retail and office uses. The development site at 200 Northeast 30th Street is next to Crescent\u2019s 40-story, 588-unit\nForma\napartment tower, which the firm completed last year.\nForma, which offers one-bedroom and two-bedroom units, commands monthly rents ranging from $3,565 to $7,515, its website shows. It was 97 percent leased as of October, Galbut said at the time.\nDesigned by Arquitectonica, the project is essentially the second phase of Forma and will include two pedestrian bridges connecting the 42-story tower to Forma and to the six-story commercial building, the plans show.\n",

        "content": "The standoff between Chicago\u2019s MLS and Zillow is escalating, as Zillow looks prepared to move forward with\nblocking private listings\nfrom its websites.\nIn an email to subscribers on Saturday, the Chicago area\u2019s MLS operator Midwest Real Estate Data (MRED) said that Zillow has been contacting brokerages asking for direct listing feeds and warning that Zillow\u2019s access to local listings could be disrupted in early January. Zillow is also \u201callegedly threatening to contact sellers\u201d about the potential disruption, the email said.\nZillow is asking brokerages to sign multi-year agreements for direct listing feeds, MRED claimed, which would eliminate the need for Zillow to receive listing data in the region from the MLS.\nTension is rising in the monthslong stalemate between MRED and the national home search giant over MRED\u2019s\nPrivate Listing Network\n, which allows sellers to show listings to agents in MRED\u2019s market and their clients but not the broader public. Under Zillow\u2019s\nlisting access standards\n, rolled out earlier this year, listings that appear first on the private network and then move to public channels would be blocked from appearing on Zillow.\nMRED has previously stated Zillow blocking certain listings would be a violation of its licensing agreement with the MLS, suggesting Zillow could lose access to MLS data if it enforces its standards. MRED did not respond to a request for comment.\nWhile Zillow hasn\u2019t started enforcing its listing rules in Chicago, its direct appeal to brokerages shows it\u2019s preparing for the possibility of losing access to MRED\u2019s listings. The frequently asked questions section of Zillow\u2019s listing access standards states it will accept a direct broker feed of listings \u201cin the event the MLS doesn\u2019t send an IDX or VOW feed with all coming soon/delayed marketing or active listings.\u201d\nIn its email to subscribers, MRED said it had not given Zillow any notices of policy violations that would merit losing access to MLS listing data.\n\u201cUnless Zillow anticipates violating MRED policy, we do not understand why they claim service will be interrupted in January,\u201d MRED\u2019s email said. \u201cMRED has asked Zillow for an explanation and has yet to receive an answer.\u201d\nIn the email, MRED directed brokers to ask Zillow why the company expects its access to listings to be interrupted, and asked brokers to share those conversations with MRED. The MLS also directed subscribers to contact Illinois regulators and local real estate associations if they feel that Zillow\u2019s requests violate state law or Realtor ethics.\nZillow declined to comment. The company hasn\u2019t said when it will begin enforcing its listing standards in the Chicago market.\nZillow, which has been sued by Compass over the same listing standards at issue in Chicago, has criticized the Private Listing Network for distorting the market and putting consumers at a disadvantage.\nZillow also argued Chicago\u2019s Private Listing Network\ndeepens segregation in Chicago\n. The company released an analysis in November that showed private listings were twice as common in white neighborhoods as they are in non-white neighborhoods, but MRED pushed back against the methodology and narrative.\n",

        "content": "Virgin Hotels is asking a Dallas court to publicly name three women who claim they were sexually assaulted by disgraced\ndeveloper Bill Hutchinson\n.\nHutchinson, the reality television star known for developing the Virgin Hotel Dallas, was accused by three women of sexual assault and battery in a 2021 lawsuit \u2014 the same year he was twice arrested in connection with sexual assault claims by a minor.\nThe suit also accuses Hutchinson\u2019s firm, Dunhill Partners, and Virgin Hotels of negligence, claiming both companies were aware that Hutchinson would use the hotel and nearby Dunhill-owned apartments to meet and prey upon young women.\nHutchinson has denied the allegations, calling the matter \u201ca frivolous \u2018shakedown\u2019 lawsuit filed by two former girlfriends and another woman who seek to turn consensual relationships and actions into payday\u201d in a 2024 filing.\nVirgin Hotels in a 2025 filing denied having a duty to the accusers and said the company had knowledge of the risk posed by Hutchinson.\nIn a filing last week,\nVirgin Hotels\nasked the court to change the protective order in place, claiming the accusers\u2019 use of pseudonyms allows them to \u201canonymously prosecute salacious claims.\u201d It also asserts that the use of numbered pseudonyms (Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4) implies that additional accusers exist in the case.\nThere are no additional accusers in the case, but Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 are three of the at least five women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, according to a source familiar with the matter.\nMichelle Simpson Tuegel, the attorney for the accusers, called the filing \u201ca desperate late-stage tactic from a powerful corporation to scare and further traumatize our clients.\u201d\n\u201cDefendants have known these plaintiffs\u2019 names for years and have been provided with their extensive personal records,\u201d she said in a statement\nJane Doe 1 is described in the suit as a college student when she said Hutchinson sexually assaulted her by getting her intoxicated at Virgin Hotel Dallas, taking her across the street to the apartment complex he owned and forcibly touching her. She reached out to him for career advice, the lawsuit claims.\nJane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 were in their late 20s when they became connected with Hutchinson, who they both claim raped them multiple times, according to the complaint.\n\u201cVirgin Hotels\u2019 leadership knew that Hutchinson was a problem, having received direct reports from Virgin Hotels Dallas\u2019 employees and others about Hutchinson\u2019s behavior with women,\u201d the initial lawsuit claimed.\nIt said Virgin Hotels\u2019 CEO was aware of the reports before Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 met Hutchinson, but \u201cVirgin Hotels Dallas, VirginServices, Virgin North America, and Virgin Hotels did nothing.\u201d\nHutchinson, who founded Dunhill Partners in 1984, starred on the TLC reality show \u201cMarrying Millions.\u201d The show featured him and his 23-year-old girlfriend, a woman he met when she was 18 and working at a restaurant.\nHutchinson was arrested in 2021 in Dallas and Orange County and charged with one felony count of rape of an unconscious person and five misdemeanor counts of sexual battery. A 17-year-old girl claimed he assaulted her at his Highland Park home. The same girl and a second teenager also accused him of assaulting them at his Laguna Beach home, also in 2021.\nA Dallas grand jury\ndeclined to indict him\non charges related to the Dallas claims. He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor sexual battery in the California case, which required him to register as a sex offender. Three of his accusers filed a civil suit in Dallas \u2014 that\u2019s the ongoing suit in which Virgin Hotels is looking to identify them.\nHutchinson stepped down from his role as CEO of Dunhill Partners after his arrest, but he has resumed the role. The firm has also been\noffloading apartment complexes\nin the wake of the allegations. His reputation has suffered from the allegations, but not to the extent that he\u2019s shunned by the real estate community. As recently as November, he delivered an address to the Cornell Real Estate Council in Dallas.\nThe next hearing in the case \u2014 to hear Virgin Hotels\u2019 request to change the protective order \u2014 is scheduled for Feb. 2. The case is set to go to trial on June 8.\n",

        "content": "South Florida\u2019s most expensive residential sales this year show a bifurcated market: one for the billionaires, and one for the rest.\nIt\u2019s a sign of how the wealth migration that began in the pandemic is shaping the region. For the first time in recent years, though, Florida\u2019s most expensive home sale of the year closed on the west coast, not the east.\nIn April, the billionaire DeGroote family sold their waterfront Naples estate for\n$225 million\n, making it the second-most expensive ever home sale in the U.S. It is also a price record for the state of Florida, topping Larry Ellison\u2019s $173 million purchase of a Manalapan estate in 2022.\nThe deal that took the top spot within the tri-county region is indicative of the deep investment by the nation\u2019s wealthiest individuals. Billionaire cosmetics mogul William Lauder sold an oceanfront lot in Palm Beach to a buyer sources say is billionaire Microsoft Excel creator Charles Simonyi, as part of a $350 million assemblage on the island.\nWhile South Florida\u2019s\nnon-luxury housing market stumbled this year\n, the market for homes over $10 million flourished. Economic uncertainty in the spring, mainly credited to tariff concerns, delayed but did not prevent pricey sales.\nHere are the most expensive sales in South Florida in 2025, based on\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nresearch.\n\u2265$160M | 1063 and 1071 North Ocean Boulevard, Palm Beach\nThe single most expensive sale in South Florida this year closed off-market and did not record publicly. Sources say the final sale price for the 2.3 oceanfront acres was more than $160 million. Lauder bought the land for $66.3 million in 2019 and 2020, and listed them for $177.8 million. They have 360 feet of beachfront.\nChristian Angle with Christian Angle Real Estate had the listing, and Ryan Serhant with Serhant brought the buyer.\nOther deals tied to the assemblage are the\n$18 million\nsale of 1066 North Ocean Boulevard and $30 million deal for 1072 North Ocean Boulevard.\n$120M | 26 Star Island Drive, Miami Beach\nBillionaire developer Vlad Doronin sold his 2.5-acre Star Island estate in Miami Beach for a record $120 million to Merrick Ventures\u2019 Michael Ferro in March. Doronin bought the 22,000-square-foot estate from Shaquille O\u2019Neal for $16 million in 2009. The six-bedroom, seven-bathroom home has a tennis court, a pool and a dock.\nTIE | $105M |\n9 West Indian Creek Island Road, Indian Creek Village\n&amp;\n5940 North Bay Road, Miami Beach\nTwo residential properties sold for $105 million in Miami-Dade County this year, tying for third-most expensive home sale in the tri-county region.\nIn June, an entity managed by Mikhail and Mariana Peleg sold the 1.8-acre waterfront lot at 9 Indian Creek Island Road for $105 million. It last sold for\n$27.5 million\nin 2018, records show. The estate is adjacent to two of the lots Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos bought last year.\nIn July, spec developer Todd Glaser and the Posner Group paid $105 million for the 2.3-acre waterfront estate at 5940 North Bay Road. The sellers were developer Sonny Kahn and his wife Suzanne Kohn. They bought the home for $2.4 million in 1991. It was built in 1936 and includes a 19,000-square-foot mansion with eight bedrooms, 13 bathrooms and three half-bathrooms. It has 290 feet of waterfront. Glaser and his partner will either\nflip the compound for $169 million\nor redevelop the estate and list it for $300 million.\nNelson Gonzalez with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty and Zachary Vichinsky and Brett Harris from Bespoke Real Estate have the listing.\n\u2265$100M | 4055 Southwest 37th Avenue, Coral Gables\nBillionaire Jorge Mas sold the 7.3-acre compound at 4055 Southwest 37th Avenue in Coral Gables in an off-market deal this year. Adjacent to the Kampong Botanical Garden, the land last sold for $9 million in 2000, according to property records, but sources told\u00a0 TRD that Mas bought the estate this year and is flipping it. The deal has yet to appear in city records.\nDeveloper Alex Pirez of Mocca Realty represented the seller, and Bespoke Real Estate\u2019s Brett Harris represented the buyer.\n$97.5M | 11465 and 11472 Old Harbour Road, North Palm Beach\nWilliam Wrigley Jr., an heir to the Wrigley chewing gum fortune, sold the waterfront compound at 11465 and 11472 Old Harbour Road in North Palm Beach for $97.5 million. Wrigley sold the 2.5-acre assemblage to an undisclosed buyer. The off-market deal was the most-expensive ever recorded in Lost Tree Village, a private golf community, and may be the priciest in North Palm Beach.\nSerhant\u2019s Gary Pohrer represented Wrigley, while Douglas Elliman\u2019s Donna Hutchins represented the buyer.\n$86.5M | 203 South Lake Trail, Palm Beach\nHellman Jordan founder Jerry Jordan and his wife, Darlene Jordan, sold their lakefront estate at 20203 South Lake Trail in Palm Beach for $86.5 million. It was the most expensive single-family home sale on the island this year, topped only by Lauder\u2019s land sale. Records show the couple paid $14 million for the 1.7-acre estate in 2000. Built in 1938, it includes a 13,400-square-foot main house with five bedrooms, eight bathrooms and one half-bathroom, a pool and a dock.\nIn 2024, the Jordans hired\nRobert A.M. Stern Architects\nto design a new mansion on the property with a pool house and padel court.\n$86M | 9149 Collins Avenue, PH-11, Surfside\nFort Partners, led by Nadim Ashi, sold a penthouse at its Seaway at the Surf Club for $86 million to a hidden buyer. It is the most expensive condo ever sold in Miami-Dade County. It spans 16,000 square feet, with the sale equating to $5,358 per square foot. Ashi completed the two-building, 34-unit, 11-story Seaway last year. Designed by Joseph Dirand and landscape designer Peter Wirtz, it is part of the Four Seasons Residences at the Surf Club complex. Seaway residents have access to the Surf Club amenities, which includes four pools, a private club and Thomas Keller restaurant.\n$74.3M | 88 La Gorce Circle, Miami Beach\nHedge fund manager Nick Maounis, head of Veriton Fund Management, bought the 1-acre waterfront estate at 88 La Gorce Circle for $74.3 million in March. Maounis previously founded Amaranth Advisors, which collapsed in 2006 after losing more than $6 billion on natural gas futures in one of the biggest hedge fund collapses in history.\nThe sellers were the Kollmans, a wealthy German family, who bought it for $15.7 million in 2010, records show. The 21,700-square-foot, nine-bedroom mansion was built in 2008 by Todd Michael Glaser, and includes a pool and 260 feet of waterfront.\nNelson Gonzalez with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty had the listing, and Ryan Mendell of Maxwelle Real Estate Group brought the buyer.\n$73M | 530 South Ocean Boulevard, Palm Beach\nBillionaire Red Ventures co-founder and CEO Ric Elias sold the oceanfront mansion at 530 South Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach in an off-market deal. Elias and his wife Brenda Elias bought the 0.7-acre property for $37.5 million in 2020. Built in 2018, the\u00a0 12,900-square-foot mansion has eight bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, four half-bathrooms and a pool. It sold fully furnished, including art.\nJack Rooney with Douglas Elliman represented the buyer and the seller.\n$69.5M | 276 Bal Bay Drive, Bal Harbour\nBillionaire Patrick Dovigi, a former hockey player and founder of Canadian waste management company Green For Life Environmental, sold a waterfront house in Bal Harbour for $69.5 million in March. He bought the 1-acre estate at 276 Bal Bay Drive in 2022 from billionaire Shari Arison, whose family owns Carnival Cruise Lines, for\n$41.5 million\n.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Dina Goldentayer brokered the deal.\n",

        "content": "Kering\nmade good\non its goal to sell a massive stake in the Fifth Avenue property it bought roughly two years ago.\nPrivate equity firm Ardian bought a 60 percent stake in 715-717 Fifth Avenue from Gucci\u2019s parent company, the two firms\nannounced\non Tuesday morning. The deal values the 115,000-square-foot property at $900 million and will see Kering score $690 million in proceeds.\nKering is hanging on to a 40 percent stake in the Plaza District property, which it bought early last year from Jeff Sutton and SL Green\nfor $963 million\n. The acquisition was part of a strategy to buy prime assets in strong markets across the globe.\nIt was also part of a trend of retailers acquiring their own spaces in Manhattan rather than leasing them. Around the time of the Kering deal, Prada paid $835 million for 724 and 720 Fifth Avenue, which was also sold by Wharton Properties boss Sutton.\nIn recent months, however, Kering has been looking to offload properties to improve its balance sheet. By the end of last year, Kering\u2019s debt soared to approximately $12 billion, leading it to start cutting costs and sell stakes in real estate across the globe.\nEarlier this year, Ardian and Kering entered into a similar joint venture centered on a three-property portfolio in Paris. Kering has also been exploring disposition options in Milan\u2019s Via Montenapoleone and in Tokyo. The mission is to raise at least 2 billion Euros through real estate transactions over a two-year period.\nNotably, France-based Ardian never made a real estate investment in the United States prior to this deal.\n\u201cWe are truly committed to acquiring and managing ultra prime assets in the most sought-after locations,\u201d Ardian executive Omar Fjer said in a statement.\nElsewhere in the Plaza District, Louis Vuitton\nfiled an application\nwith the Department of City Planning for a 25-story building at 1 East 57th Street, which would span 148,000 square feet alongside Fifth Avenue.\n",

        "content": "The head of next year\u2019s FIFA World Cup host committee just dropped $20.7 million on an Upper West Side penthouse.\nAlex Lasry, the son of former Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry, shelled out roughly $2,500 per square foot for an apartment at\n535 West End Avenue\n, according to public records.\nThe 8,400-square-foot condo was sold by a trust tied to Tamar Wolchok and Simona Ganz, the daughters of the late Slim-Fast mogul S. Daniel Abraham. Abraham died earlier this year at the\nage of 100\n.\nIt\u2019s unclear when Wolchok and Ganz purchased the property, as the only other deed recorded in city rolls shows an LLC by the same name as the trust, 4M Holdings, transferring ownership to the entity in 2023. The trust appears to have listed the home in 2011 with an asking price of $37.5 million, according to StreetEasy.\nThe six-bedroom, six-bathroom penthouse hit the market in January asking $26 million, though it later endured a series of price cuts. Its last asking price was just under $19 million, suggesting the condo may have sold in a bidding war.\nThe apartment also features a staff room, private elevator landing and rooftop terrace with an outdoor kitchen and fireplace. Amenities in the building, developed by Gary Barnett\u2019s Extell Development and completed in 2010, include a pool, gym and parking garage.\nCorcoran\u2019s Steven Cohen, who represented the seller, declined to comment on the deal.\nEarlier this year, developer Leon Melohn sold his full-floor condo at the building for\n$15.9 million\n, roughly six years after he and his wife purchased it for $15.7 million.\nLasry was tapped to serve as the CEO of the FIFA 2026 World Cup Host Committee for New York and New Jersey in February. The tournament is scheduled to begin in the area on June 13, 2026, and continue until July 19.\nLasry was previously the deputy assistant secretary for travel and tourism at the U.S. Department of Commerce. He also campaigned for a Wisconsin Senate seat as a Democrat in 2022, though he later dropped out of the race.\nLasry\u2019s father, also a co-founder of the hedge fund Avenue Capital Group, in October listed his duplex co-op on West 66th Street for $42 million. The move came more than a decade after he and his wife Cathy, an interior designer, purchased it for $33 million.",

The primary suite spans the entire second floor with a private terrace, dressing room and an ensuite bath with a freestanding soaking tub and double rain shower.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Nadia Bartolucci and Alex Tsao had the listing.\nLast week\u2019s other top contract went to a unit at a boutique new development in Cobble Hill at 323 Clinton Street, also asking nearly $7 million. Unit 1 is a triplex in the four-unit building developed by Eckstrom NYC, referred to as the \u201ctownhouse unit,\u201d according to StreetEasy.\nSpanning over 4,200 square feet, the home features four bedrooms, four bathrooms, a private garden, a terrace and a dedicated street entrance. The finished cellar level includes a 25-foot-wide media room with a working fireplace, a fitness area and a dry sauna.\nBuilt in 1910, Eckstrom converted the former rental building while preserving the brownstone facade and maintaining original details like a stained-glass transom and pier mirror.\nEckstrom co-founder Carlos Saavedra said the townhouse-style condo units appeal to buyers who want a townhouse but can\u2019t afford an entire renovated building.\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough for buyers of townhouses to find us as they typically are not searching for condos,\u201d he said.\nSaavedra had the listing through his brokerage, Park Property Advisors, along with Jorge Murillo.\nThere were 18 contracts signed last week \u2014 seven condos, one co-op and 10 townhouses \u2014 for almost $66 million. That follows\n23 contracts signed for $73 million\nin the previous period.\nHomes put into contract last week had a median asking price of almost $3 million, an average discount of 3 percent and spent an average of 104 days on the market.\n",

        "content": "Blue Star Properties is buying out its own lender on a West Loop building at a steep discount. It\u2019s resetting the clock on a long-term bet many landlords have abandoned in Chicago\u2019s battered office market.\nThe Chicago-based firm purchased a $38.9 million mortgage backed by the 10-story office building it owns at 328 South Jefferson Street, according to Blue Star principal\nCraig Golden\n. The move recapitalized the 293,037-square-foot property about five months after Blue Star and Wells Fargo quietly put it up for sale in an effort to resolve the overdue debt, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nGolden declined to disclose the price paid for the loan, but a source familiar with the deal said\nBlue Star\nshelled out roughly $50 per square foot, or just over $14 million, according to the publication. That kind of haircut has become common, as downtown office values crater under the weight of remote work and higher interest rates. What\u2019s less common is an owner stepping in to buy the paper rather than handing over the keys.\nThe transaction marks an escape from a long stalemate for Blue Star. With the loan past maturity, the firm had been effectively sidelined from pursuing new leases for nearly two years, Golden told the outlet.\nWells Fargo, which inherited the loan through its 2008 acquisition of Wachovia, increased the debt multiple times as Blue Star leased up the building, according to Cook County records. The buyout locked in a loss for the bank, but cleared the way for Blue Star to move forward.\nThe firm financed the debt purchase with a new loan from Aurora-based Old Second National Bank. Golden said Blue Star plans to refresh the lobby and common areas as it ramps up leasing efforts.\nThe building was 61 percent leased when it hit the market over the summer, according to a Cushman &amp; Wakefield marketing flyer. It has 27 tenants, a weighted average lease term of 3.1 years and space to accommodate a tenant of up to about 30,000 square feet following the departure of third-party logistics firm Total Quality Logistics.\nBlue Star\nalso recently bought 2 North Riverside Plaza for a fraction of its pre-pandemic value. It\u2019s betting on nearby momentum, including The Chicago School\u2019s medical campus at\n400 South Jefferson\nand a planned 198-unit apartment project Blue Star is developing across the street.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "An office tower in Dallas\u2019 Arts District has a new, local owner.\nAn affiliate of TRT Holdings purchased St. Paul Place, a 22-story office building at\n750 North Saint Paul Street\n, from Pacific Elm Properties, according to Dallas County deed records. The deal closed Dec. 2. Pricing was not disclosed, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nTRT Holdings is a Dallas-based investment firm founded by billionaire Robert Rowling and his father, Reese Rowling. The company is best known as the owner of Omni Hotels &amp; Resorts, but it also has a long history of investing in office, residential and mixed-use properties in Texas and beyond.\nBuilt in 1983, the green-glass tower spans nearly 275,000 square feet and sits in the heart of the Arts District, a pocket of downtown that has generally fared better than older office submarkets. The Dallas Central Appraisal District valued the property at just over $47 million for tax purposes this year.\nTenants at St. Paul Place include real estate information giant Costar Group, law firm Mayer and a mix of professional service businesses. More than 23,500 square feet are being marketed for sublease, according to a current listing, reflecting the ongoing reshuffling of space needs across downtown.\nThe property also comes with some recent baggage. St. Paul Place underwent months of renovation following a flood in April, according to the publication, work that likely factored into both the timing and underwriting of the sale.\nPacific Elm\nbought the building in 2023 from Dallas-based Quadrant Investment Properties, financing the acquisition with a $66.7 million loan from MetLife Commercial Mortgage. Pacific Elm has been an active downtown investor, with stakes in properties such as 2100 Ross, Bryan Tower and\nSantander Tower\n. How the St. Paul Place exit pencils out for the firm remains unclear without a disclosed sales price.\nQuadrant acquired the tower in 2016 and poured millions into a major overhaul, including a redesigned ground-floor lobby and new outdoor patio spaces aimed at making the building more competitive.\nThe latest deal lands amid a modest but notable run of office trades in Dallas\u2019 urban core this year. While volumes remain well below pre-pandemic norms, buyers are stepping in. The largest office sale of 2025 so far was Crescent Real Estate\u2019s acquisition of the Texas Capital Center at\n2000 McKinney Avenue\n, a deal backed by Fort Worth billionaire John Goff. Like St. Paul Place, that sale came without a disclosed price.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The revelation came in a recent investor presentation, where Chief Financial Officer Matthew DiLiberto said the company was \u201cselling assets [and] losing [income] to fight against interest rates that are too high.\u201d\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean SL Green is done buying. Though it is seeking to unload roughly $2.5 billion of property, the company also plans to make $1 billion worth of acquisitions, according to executives.\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready to deploy our $1.3 billion debt fund, have a goal of more than $1 billion in acquisitions and are even considering share buybacks,\u201d the company said in a statement.\nAmong the properties SL Green is putting up for sale:\n1350 Sixth Avenue, a 600,000-square-foot office building in the Plaza District.\n245 Park Avenue\n, a 1.7-million-square-foot property within a famed corridor. SL Green acquired the property out of bankruptcy in 2022 and sold 50 percent of the equity in 2023 to Japanese developer Mori Trust in a deal that valued the tower at $2 billion. This time, SL Green is eyeing a 25 percent stake sale.\n750 Third Avenue, which is in the process of being converted into 680 apartments. SL Green would look to hand off a 65 percent stake in the redevelopment.\nThe timing for SL Green could prove bountiful as Manhattan\u2019s office market stands above the rest of the country. The office vacancy rate in Manhattan is 13.1 percent, according to Moody\u2019s, compared to 19.3 percent across the nation.\nBut SL Green, which reportedly carries $7 billion in liabilities, has seen its stock price dip by a third this year. There are concerns the real estate investment trust could\ncut its dividend\nnext year as cash flow diminishes for the landlord.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

That edges past Surfside\u2019s previous record set with the 2023 sale of 99A Surfside Avenue, which traded for an even $6.4 million, or $1,829 per square foot.\nIt also makes for the third Surfside deal in the first two weeks of the month, with the other two trades also located in the A row.\nColdwell Banker Realty\n\u2019s Kimia Vakili represented the seller. The brokerage\u2019s Ash Rizk brought the buyer, a Los Angeles County family that was looking for a coastal property, according to a Coldwell Banker spokesperson.\nThe\nOrange County\nproperty last traded about a year ago for $4.5 million, or $1,140 per square foot, to a\nCorona del Mar\nlimited liability company called Pelican Real Estate Group, property and state records indicate.\nThe four-bedroom, six-bathroom home was rebuilt in 2000 and saw a full renovation completed earlier this year. The 3,948-square-foot property has two primary suites, an office, European oakwood flooring and chef\u2019s kitchen with custom cabinetry.\nSometimes referred to by agents as Malibu South, Surfside is spread across less than 1 acre of land and is governed by a five-member board of directors. The nonprofit corporation was created in 1930 with a community designed in three rows, labeled A, B and C. Row A consists of oceanfront properties, while C homes most commonly do not have ocean views. B offers a mix.\nColdwell Banker\u2019s been on a tear in Seal Beach this year, which is seeing home prices across the city rise. The median home price in October was $488,500, which was up 18.4 percent year-over-year, according to Redfin data.\nColdwell Banker\u2019s Garrett Weston held the listing on 308 Ocean Avenue, which sold for $12.5 million, or $1,446 per square foot, in July to mark the city\u2019s highest-priced deal this year.\nPut into a broader context, the latest Surfside deal is Seal Beach\u2019s third-priciest residential closing in 2025.\n",

        "content": "The Chicago Housing Authority is under the microscope, as federal watchdogs dig into how the agency vets tenants for immigration status and criminal backgrounds, adding another layer of scrutiny to one of the city\u2019s most powerful real estate institutions.\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Office of Inspector General has launched an audit of the\nCHA\nto examine whether it is properly verifying who qualifies for federally assisted housing, according to documents obtained and first\nreported\nby the Chicago Sun-Times. The review also aims to assess how the authority prevents and addresses criminal activity in its properties.\nThe audit notice states that its objective is to determine whether CHA complied with HUD\u2019s requirements for verifying eligibility for assisted housing, based on disqualifying factors such as criminal activity, citizenship and immigration status, as well as to assess the agency\u2019s practices in regards to addressing and preventing criminal activity.\nThe letter, dated Sept. 15, was sent to CHA Interim Operating Chairman\nMatthew Brewer\nby Kilah White, HUD\u2019s assistant inspector general for audit. HUD said the work would begin immediately and will cover the period from Sept. 1, 2022 through Aug. 31, 2025.\nHUD spokesperson Matthew Maley said the audit is part of a broader national push ordered by HUD Secretary Scott Turner. Earlier this\nyear\n, Turner told public housing authorities the agency intended to \u201cfully carry out the law\u201d and ensure that no \u201cillegals or ineligibles\u201d are receiving HUD assistance. HUD is auditing housing authorities across the country, Maley said, including through on the ground investigations like the one in Chicago.\nThe CHA did not respond to requests for comment from the publication.\nChicago is not alone. A HUD official familiar with the process said the CHA is one of a handful of housing authorities currently being audited, alongside the District of Columbia Housing Authority. In August, Turner publicly said HUD had given the D.C. agency 30 days to turn over information about residents\u2019 citizenship status, adding that similar demands were being made of more than 3,000 public housing authorities nationwide.\nThe CHA audit lands against a charged political backdrop. The Trump administration has intensified its focus on immigration enforcement and crime in Democratic-led cities, and HUD has increasingly framed housing oversight around \u201claw and order.\u201d The agency last week notified Boston Mayor Michelle Wu that it was opening an investigation into the city\u2019s\nhousing policies\n, accusing her administration of violating the Fair Housing Act through its equity initiatives.\nCloser to home, the CHA has already been navigating federal pressure tied to Trump-era executive orders, including bans on diversity, equity and inclusion programs. The authority sued HUD over those requirements in October, before dropping the case after receiving a filing extension.\nThe CHA is the third-largest housing authority in the country, with a budget exceeding $1 billion. It serves more than 65,000 households and is the city\u2019s largest single landlord. Any findings from the audit could ripple through how public housing is managed, funded and policed in Chicago\u2019s neighborhoods.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Two long-struggling office towers in\nArlington\nare inching closer to the sale block, offering an example of older suburban office buildings experiencing distress across North Texas.\nCopeland Tower and Stadium Place, adjacent properties at 1250 and 1200 East Copeland Road totaling just over 210,000 square feet, are now expected to be marketed for sale in early 2026, according to a Nov. 15 notice tied to their commercial mortgage-backed securities loan. The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat the update comes as the buildings\u2019 appraised value keeps sinking and leasing momentum remains elusive.\nThe 12-story Copeland Tower at 1250 East Copeland Road spans 126,628 square feet, while the neighboring five-story Stadium Place at 1200 East Copeland totals 84,653 square feet. Built in 1987 and renovated in 2017, the towers sit just over a mile from Arlington\u2019s\nEntertainment District\nand are familiar fixtures to drivers along\nI-30\n.\nIn 2022, a commercial mortgage-backed securities trust arranged by\nSwiss bank UBS\ntook title to both buildings from Houston-based Aqua Investment Group following a foreclosure auction. Since then, the trust has focused on stabilizing the properties through leasing and renewals, while weighing longer-term options.\nEarlier notices indicated plans to market the buildings this year. The latest filing pushes that timeline out, stating the \u201cnote holder anticipates marketing the collateral for sale\u201d in the first quarter of 2026. Chris Hamilton was recently appointed as substitute trustee to oversee the properties on behalf of the loan servicer.\nLeasing conditions have done little to bolster the outlook. According to recent CMBS investor reports, Copeland Tower\u2019s occupancy has been stuck at 40 percent since the start of the year. Stadium Place slipped to 68 percent occupied, down from 77 percent in February.\nMajor tenants include the Texas Department of Family &amp; Protective Services and Meyer Distributing. Northstar Energy Services\u2019 roughly 10,900-square-foot lease expired in November. The state agency\u2019s 46,239-square-foot lease at Stadium Place runs through 2027.\nValuations tell a harsher story. The combined appraised value of the towers fell to $9.4 million as of Sept. 24, down roughly 67 percent from a $29 million valuation in 2018. The properties are saddled with at least $18.6 million in outstanding mortgage debt, according to servicer reports.\nThe decline marks a sharp reversal from pre-pandemic highs. After years of stagnant leasing, occupancy climbed to about 92 percent in 2018 and 2019 following a push by Bradford Commercial. That progress unraveled during the pandemic, as tenants downsized and ownership sought repeated loan relief. Several large leases rolled in 2023 and 2024, including health care firm Multiplan\u2019s 59,153 square feet.\nThe Arlington-Mansfield Class B office market totals about 3.8 million square feet, according to JLL, and has logged negative absorption this year with vacancy hovering above 13 percent.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A landlord battered by the pandemic-era collapse in tourism is scrambling to hang on to a boutique Nolita hotel as a long-running foreclosure inches forward.\nVeracity Equities, the lower Manhattan-focused firm run by Edmond Li, is facing a $35.3 million judgment tied to a defaulted mortgage at the Nolitan, a 55-key hotel at 153 Elizabeth Street. The nine-story building on the corner of Kenmare Street had been slated to go up for auction this week, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nInstead, the auction has been pushed \u2014 again. Li and lender Silverpeak Real Estate Finance agreed Monday to delay the sale until Feb. 4, a move that appears aimed at buying the borrower more time to secure a refinancing and pay off the debt.\nThe delay marks the third time the court postponed an auction of the property, underscoring how messy and drawn-out pandemic-era hotel workouts can be.\nLi bought the Elizabeth Street site in 2006 for $5.4 million and redeveloped it into the Nolitan, which opened in 2011. Today, rooms start at around $300 a night. The property is also home to the Japanese-Italian restaurant Kimika on the ground floor.\nSilverpeak, a Midtown-based lender, issued a $24 million loan on the property in 2016 that was later securitized and sold to investors. After Covid shutdowns destroyed hotel revenue, Li stopped making payments in 2021, prompting the lender to launch foreclosure proceedings later that year, according to court records.\nLi has argued that the lender and a court-appointed receiver undercut his efforts to stabilize the asset, including blocking plans for a rooftop bar that could have generated roughly $68,000 a month in rent and preventing repairs to address water leaks.\nManhattan Supreme Court Justice Francis Kahn ultimately sided with Silverpeak, ruling that Li remains liable for roughly $35 million, including principal, interest and fees.\nIf the foreclosure goes through, it would be the latest blow to Veracity\u2019s downtown portfolio.\nThe firm is also facing foreclosure on a $32 million loan tied to three nearby rental buildings at 137 Thompson Street and 26 and 29 Prince Street. Last year, Li sold a mixed-use walkup at 146 Mulberry Street for $12.7 million, below the $13.3 million he paid in 2015.\nSilverpeak\u2019s attorney declined to comment. Li and his counsel did not return calls.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The loan will help support the multifamily development, expected to wrap in the fall of 2027.\nAffinius Capital provided the loan for the 21-story, 276-unit project at the corner of Douglass and Bond streets. The development is expected to include 20,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor.\nUnits in the building will range from studio to three-bedroom layouts.

Several months ago, it teamed up with 3650 Capital to\nprovide $156 million\nin debt to Prime Holdings Group, which refinanced a trio of self-storage properties in the outer boroughs.\nMidwood\u2019s portfolio spans more than 100 properties nationwide. Among its prominent New York developments are the Candela Tower in Manhattan, 800 Union Street in Brooklyn and The Williams, also in Brooklyn.\nDevelopers began flocking to Gowanus several years ago when the neighborhood was rezoned in 2021, a move expected to add more than 8,000 apartments to the area over the span of a decade.\nIn a statement, Usdan referred to Gowanus as \u201cone of Brooklyn\u2019s most dynamic and rapidly evolving neighborhoods.\u201d\nLast month, David Tabak\nacquired\na development site at 563 Sackett Street in Gowanus for $58.5 million.

The parcel is owned by Del Mar Property, an entity managed by local developer Gerard Ngo.\nWhen complete, Prospect Villa will deliver 75 one-, two-, three- and four-bedroom apartments atop roughly 6,350 square feet of ground-floor retail, \u201caddressing the housing needs of Rosemead\u201d while \u201ctransforming [the] underutilized site into a vibrant community hub,\u201d Wong said. The location is currently a vacant lot.\nThe financing arrives amid an uncertain capital markets environment as higher interest rates and elevated construction costs present obstacles to development. At the same time, developers and institutional investors have been\nturning their attention outside Los Angeles\ncity limits to communities like Rosemead to avoid hurdles like\nMeasure ULA\n. \u201cSecuring construction financing in today\u2019s capital markets requires a compelling sponsor and a project that truly fits the local demographic,\u201d Wong said.\nSite owner Ngo is no stranger to Rosemead, and this stretch of Garvey Avenue in particular. In 2023, Ngo, acting through his Green Park Property firm,\nfiled plans to build\n93 apartments with 5,400 square feet ground-floor retail and restaurants at 7849-7857 Garvey Avenue and 7900-7916 Virginia Street. The project would replace a row of small commercial buildings at Garvey and Del Mar avenues and boast one, two- and three-bedroom units.\nThe average rent in the San Gabriel Valley is $2,039 a month, well below the overall L.A. County average of $2,336, according to a third-quarter market report from Lee &amp; Associates cited by CO. Compared to a year ago, there are also more apartment buildings on the market as owners face strict rent control laws, rising cost of ownership and higher utility costs and insurance premiums.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Adi Chugh\u2019s Tyko Capital delivered.\nExtell Development landed $1.13 billion in construction financing for its 74-story project in Midtown Manhattan, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The deal, done without brokers, represents the largest construction financing package in New York City this year.\nThe financing closed on Monday. Tyko declined to comment to the Observer, while Extell did not return a request for comment.\nExtell in July filed a rezoning application with the Department of City Planning for the site, doubling the number of stories Barnett had in mind when the firm initially filed plans last fall.\nThe rezoning application described a 765,000-square-foot project that would stand 1,162 feet tall and include 154 residential units. The residential space would span 476,000 square feet, while 233,000 square feet of commercial space would be split between office and retail, mostly the former.\nBarnett offered to improve the Fifth Avenue/59th Street N/R/W subway station in exchange for 130,000 square feet of space. Extell also wants to transfer 135,000 square feet of development rights from the Metropolitan Club at 790 Fifth Avenue.\nWithout the rezoning, Extell was last considering a plan for an even taller, 84-story property, though it would have less residential and office space. That project would span 600,000 square feet with 158 residential units, which could be adjusted in either direction depending on unit size.\nThe estimated completion date would be in 2031.\nExtell bought the property between East 60th and East 61st streets last October for\nnearly $160 million\nfrom Williams Equities. The 24-story building was last renovated in 2005 and charged office rents between $54 and $66 per square foot, according to CoStar estimates.\nIn the spring, luxury fashion brand Chanel was reported to be\nin discussions\nto purchase the retail space at the development, potentially paying in the mid-$400 millions for the 65,000 square feet.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The developers of Miami Beach\u2019s Goodtime Hotel are in for a not-so-good time over a payment guarantee tied to an allegedly defaulted $149.3 million mortgage.\nEric Birnbaum and Michael Fascitelli allege CIM Group is seeking to illegally collect at least $10 million via the payment guarantee, even if they turn over the 266-key hotel at\n601 Washington Avenue\nvia a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. That\u2019s according to a counterclaim filed in New York Supreme Court this week against an affiliate of the Sacramento-based lender.\nIn July, the CIM affiliate sued Birnbaum and Fascitelli, who lead New York-based Imperial Companies, for allegedly breaching the payment guarantee by failing to make the $10 million payment and giving up the property, which is part of Marriott\u2019s Tribute Portfolio division.\nThe CIM affiliate alleges the Imperial Companies affiliate that owns Goodtime Hotel failed to repay roughly $149.3 million when the loan matured last year.\nAttorneys for Birnbaum, Fascitelli and CIM declined comment.\nGoodtime Hotel\nopened in 2021 with a lot of fanfare. At the time, Birnbaum and Fascitelli touted\u00a0 celebrity Pharrell Williams, hospitality mogul David Grutman and designer Ken Fulk as partners in the project. They developed the hotel with a\n$45 million\nconstruction loan after acquiring the property for\n$36 million\nin 2015.\nA lawyer\u2019s costly mistake\nAccording to court filings, Goodtime Hotel\u2019s owners signed the payment guarantee agreement in 2021, when they obtained a\n$164 million\nfinancing from CIM that was subsequently reduced to $152 million. Birnbaum and Fascitelli allege the agreement was supposed to state that they would pay for three months of carrying costs in the event the lender foreclosed on the property or the hotel owners relinquished the property in a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.\nBut their lawyer, Gary Axelrod with Chicago-based law firm Lathan &amp; Watkins, allegedly missed an error in the agreement that did not explicitly state Birnbaum and Fascitelli would only cover costs for three months, the counterclaim states. As a result, their obligation for the hotel\u2019s operating costs, taxes and debt service could be interpreted as a potentially perpetual obligation until the Goodtime Hotel was in the black.\nAxelrod allegedly did not realize the mistake until 2023 when Birnbaum and Fascitelli initially decided to go ahead with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure because Goodtime Hotel was not profitable, the counterclaim states. The attorney allegedly advised the hotel owners to \u201ckick the can\u201d until the property was stabilized. Axelrod did not respond to requests for comment.\nBirnbaum\nand Fascitelli allege the CIM affiliate has sought to capitalize on the error by refusing to correct the agreement, asserting that the hotel owners could be liable in perpetuity. The lender allegedly leveraged the erroneous payment guarantee agreement to force Birnbaum and Fascitelli into forbearance in 2023 and a $10 million supplemental guarantee, per the counterclaim.\nThe alleged mortgage default\nBirnbaum and Fascitelli accuse the CIM affiliate of repeatedly stalling their efforts to do a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure deal and initiating a UCC foreclosure action that the lender did not follow through on. The CIM affiliate also allegedly torpedoed their attempts to refinance the mortgage debt with a new lender by increasing the payoff quote by more than $20 million, the counterclaim states.\nThe CIM affiliate alleges in its lawsuit that it sent the Goodtime Hotel entity a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure notice in January, but that the owners failed to deliver closing documents and fulfill other requirements for transferring the property. A month later, after demanding the $10 million payment, the lender provided Birnbaum and Fascitelli extensions to complete the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, which they failed to meet.\nBirnbaum and Fascitelli are seeking a court order to rescind the payment guarantee agreement or allow it to be amended to include the three month requirement for the carrying costs.",

        "content": "Bridge Industrial\nis looking for a buyer for one of the largest industrial developments built in the Bay Area in the past two decades.\nThe Chicago-based logistics real estate firm is marketing Bridge Point Oakland, a 534,242-square-foot industrial park in Oakland, for sale by Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nBridge bought the Class A industrial property at 5441 International Boulevard, once a\nGeneral Electric\ntransformer manufacturing plant, in 2019 for $37.8 million. Prior to that sale, General Electric had owned the site for 70 years, though it shut down operations there in 2005. The facility sits on 24 acres and includes nearly 10,000 square feet of office space with 85 dock positions.\nBridge spent $91.6 million to redevelop the property, demolishing a majority of the former structure while maintaining its original brick facade to make way for a new industrial facility. The company broke ground on Bridge Point in 2020 to create \u201ca critical piece of infrastructure in a rapidly growing city and region that is in need of new industrial supply,\u201d Greg Woolway, a vice president at Bridge,\nsaid\nin a statement at the time. Bridge completed construction on Bridge Point Oakland in 2023.\nDemand for industrial space is on the rise, as leasing activity across the market increased 45 percent in the third quarter to 2.3 million square feet from 1.6 million square feet in the prior three months. The difference year-over-year was even more pronounced with a 97 percent jump. Of the deals signed, 74 percent were new leases. The vacancy rate for industrial space in the Bay Area was 6.4 percent in the third quarter, according to a CBRE\nreport\n,\ndown\nfrom 6.6 percent the prior quarter.\nBridge Industrial is\u00a0 building a 714,491-square-foot\nindustrial\ncampus at 2350 Qume Drive in San Jose, known as Bridge Point San Jose. That project is expected to be completed in March.\nThe company acquires, develops and operates logistics real estate in supply-constrained markets across the country and Europe, according to its website. Its only completed facility in the Bay Area at the moment is Bridge Point Silicon Valley, a 388,240-square-foot property in\nMilpitas\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "Hours after publication of my\nAug. 11 article\nabout the substantial rehabilitation of a Williamsburg rental building, I got a frantic email from a reader.\nThe building had been taken out of rent stabilization following the sub rehab and had been charging market-rate rents \u2014 a perfectly legal strategy \u2014 only for a state regulator to retroactively deny the deregulation. This would devalue the building, for which the owner had paid Jeff Sutton $9.75 million in 2023, and likely trigger a rent-overcharge lawsuit.\nThis sequence of events would wipe out the investment and lead to foreclosure, with the lender selling the property for pennies on the dollar. A real estate disaster by any definition.\nBack to the reader\u2019s email. Without revealing his specific request, to which I did not agree, I will share my takeaway from the message: Lots of real estate investors have done this and could be royally screwed.\nIf the state\u2019s regulator of rent-stabilized housing, Homes and Community Renewal, starts systematically undoing deregulations of sub-rehabbed buildings, many owners and lenders would be crushed.\nThe reader who emailed me was a longtime owner of rental buildings and was not connected to the Williamsburg building, which led me to believe he knew what he was talking about.\nTurns out, he did. On Nov. 26, my colleague Kathryn Brenzel\ncovered a lawsuit\nby the owners of 31 sub-rehabbed buildings. They want the courts to protect these investments from getting hosed by HCR the way the Williamsburg building sold by Sutton did.\nThe lawsuit didn\u2019t specify the 31 buildings; the owners want to remain anonymous to avoid retaliation. But that strategy appears to have failed: Days later Attorney General Letitia James sued Peak Capital Advisors for deregulating 159 units in\n31 buildings\nthrough sub rehabs.\nPeak hasn\u2019t acknowledged filing the November lawsuit, whose plaintiffs call themselves Balanced Housing Solutions, or BHS. (They should have picked a different name, because BHS to most real estate people means Brown Harris Stevens.) The plaintiffs say the attorney general\u2019s separate suit doesn\u2019t even acknowledge that HCR changed its policy on sub rehabs, thus unfairly portraying owners as lawbreakers.\nAt this point, only a fool would finance a sub rehab without getting a written guarantee from HCR that deregulation is allowed. But what about all the folks who have already done these projects with the assumption that the rules were the same as they had been for ages? How many hundreds of buildings are at risk?\nGiven HCR\u2019s history under Commissioner RuthAnne Visnauskas, the agency seems unlikely to give landlords the benefit of the doubt. Fortunately for owners, Visnauskas has a boss. Her name is Gov. Kathy Hochul. And she\u2019s up for re-election next year.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill owners of old apartment buildings replace gas stoves \u2014 which produce emissions that\ndamage tenants\u2019 lungs\nand also pose a fire risk \u2014 with 120-volt, battery-powered electric appliances? Because they store energy, they don\u2019t draw a lot of power at once and thus don\u2019t require electrical system upgrades. But they can still cook two Thanksgiving dinners on a single charge. Electra brags that its 120-volt induction stove costs only $3,999, versus\nCopper\u2019s $5,999 model\n. Send thoughts to eengquist@therealdeal.com.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Having employees with political differences work together might be a bad idea, based on a study of golfers. An\nanalysis\nof PGA players\u2019 results from 1997 to 2022 found that when golfers in a group were all Republicans or all Democrats, they played better. Golfers in politically mixed groups took 0.2 more strokes, on average, to finish a round. PGA group assignments are random, allowing for what economists call a natural experiment.\nElsewhere\u2026\nGood news for real estate interests who thought they were stuck with HSTPA apologist Linda Rosenthal as chair of the Assembly Housing Committee for the rest of her career: She is considering jumping to the state Senate.\nAccording to\nCity and State\n, the seat being vacated mid-term by Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal is Rosenthal\u2019s if she wants it. She wouldn\u2019t even have to win a competitive race, because in a special election such as this one, Democratic insiders can name the party\u2019s candidate.\n\u201cRosenthal has privately thought about what to do for months, but she still has not come to a decision on whether she\u2019d like to run, or stick with the Assembly, where she has worked her way up over two decades to become chair of the powerful Housing Committee,\u201d the publication wrote.\nThe Senate, which has 63 seats, is more prestigious than the Assembly, which has 150. But Rosenthal would have less say over rent stabilization, and her successor as Assembly housing chair might be more receptive to changing the HSTPA before it bankrupts and degrades more buildings.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$20.7 million\nfor a 6,500-square-foot condominium unit at 535 West End Avenue on the Upper West Side. Steven A Cohen with Corcoran had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$218.6 million\nfor the InterContinental New York Times Square at 300 West 44th Street. Tishman Realty sold the 670-room hotel to\nGencom, Highgate and Argent Ventures\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$4.8 million\nfor a 2,006-square-foot condominium unit at 250 West 96th Street on the Upper West Side. Pamela S. D\u2019Arc with Compass has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nTwo permits for a combined 400 units and 386,000 square feet were filed at 161-09 and 161-10 Hillside Avenue in Jamaica Hills. Matthew Melody with Curtis + Ginsberg Architects filed the permits on behalf of Mural Real Estate Partners.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

Weirtheim\u2019s purchase was the first home sale in Manalapan to trade above $60 million since Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison\u2019s\n$173 million acquisition\nin 2022.\nThe deed was recorded for $61.8 million, and the additional $3 million spent included furniture and other credits, according to a Corcoran Group spokesperson. Corcoran\u2019s Phil and Candace Friis represented the seller.\nThe 2-acre property includes two swimming pools, an air-conditioned garage that fits more than 13 cars, a cabana, gate house and dock with boat lifts, according to the listing agents.\nIt\u2019s one of about 60 properties in Manalapan that includes access to the ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway, connected by an underground tunnel. The house has eight bedrooms, eight bathrooms and six half-bathrooms. The property includes 160 feet of water frontage.\nThe trust previously paid $28 million for the property in 2021, which means it more than doubled in value in four years.\nLast year, Wertheim\npaid $38 million\nfor the waterfront house at 305 Indian Road in Palm Beach. Developer Todd Glaser sold him the property. Wertheim founded and leads Brain Power, the largest producer of optical tints for eyeglasses, and has a net worth of $3.9 billion, according to Forbes, down about $2 billion since last year.\nBuyers like Manalapan because the properties are larger than Palm Beach but still close to landmarks such as President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club, agents say. Ellison, one of the richest people in the world, is doubling down on his investment in Manalapan: Last year, he paid\n$277.4 million\nfor the Eau Palm Beach Resort &amp; Spa.\u00a0Earlier this year, WeatherTech founder David MacNeil spent an additional\n$55.5 million\non oceanfront property in Manalapan.

        "content": "The area surrounding the Metro A Line\u2019s Lake station in\nPasadena\ncould look different if the city signs off on a proposal from 4D Development.\nThe Pasadena Design Commission is set to review a plan from a\n4D Development &amp; Investment\naffiliate to build a mixed-use apartment building at 490 North Lake Avenue, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n.\n4D Development\u2019s plan calls for the construction of a seven-story building with 149 studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments above 9,298 square feet of ground-floor retail and parking for 135 vehicles. The Kevin Tsai Architecture-designed building would span 129,953 square feet.\nOf the 149 units, 23 would be set aside for low- and moderate-income households. In Los Angeles County, this is generally defined as making a maximum of between $84,850 and $89,550 for one person annually, or between $121,150 and $127,900 for a household of four. By including the affordable units, the project is eligible for density bonus incentives, permitting the developer to build more units than zoning regulations would typically allow.\nThe project will be presented to the Pasadena Design Commission for a preliminary consultation. A final vote on the development has not been scheduled.\n4D Development has been active with other\nmultifamily\nprojects in the Los Angeles area. In 2023 the firm completed the E on Adams mixed-use development at\n5181 West Adams Boulevard\n. That project comprises a six-story building with 115 studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments above about 16,600 square feet of ground-floor retail and a 46-car garage.\nIn October, the Los Angeles City Council upheld the City Planning Commission\u2019s approval of 4D Development\u2019s proposed mixed-use residential project in\nBeverly Grove\n. 4D\u2019s endeavor will replace a stretch of commercial buildings at 8251-8271 West Melrose Avenue with a six-story building featuring 90 one- and two-bedroom apartments atop 15,271 square feet of ground-floor retail and a 96-car parking garage. That project, similar to its plans in Pasadena, will include affordable housing set aside for very-low-income residents in exchange for density bonus incentives.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Just months after buying the retail portion of\nTribune Tower\n, North American Real Estate is expanding into Chicago neighborhood shopping, snapping up a three-building portfolio on the North Side.\nThe Chicago-based investor last week acquired three single-tenant retail properties along Southport Avenue in Lakeview, principal Savas Er told CoStar, which first\nreported\nthe deal. The buildings, at 3337, 3358 and 3435 North Southport Avenue, sit a few blocks southwest of Wrigley Field in a bustling stretch of shops and restaurants.\nThe price was not disclosed and has not yet appeared in public records. The seller was Newcastle Investors, another Chicago firm, which was represented by Mid-America Real Estate brokers Joe Girardi, Emily Gadomski and Patrick Corrigan.\nThe deal gives North American a foothold on a corridor that landlords covet for one simple reason: It\u2019s fully leased. CoStar reported that Southport Avenue between Addison and Roscoe streets has so far recorded zero vacant retail spaces in each of the past two years, according to Stone Real Estate\u2019s annual survey.\nThe three Southport Avenue buildings total about 20,000 square feet and are fully leased. The 8,692-square-foot property at 3435 North Southport is occupied by Capital One Caf\u00e9, while Tuco &amp; Blondie leases the 8,200-square-foot building at 3358 North Southport. Indira Salon &amp; Spa occupies the 3,350-square-foot building at 3337 North Southport, according to a Mid-America marketing brochure.\nThe Southport acquisition follows North American\u2019s purchase earlier this year of the retail component of Tribune Tower, as well as its purchase of the fully leased, multi-tenant Point at Clark property in Lakeview. Together, the moves highlight a strategy focused on dense neighborhoods and high-traffic retail strips.\nEr told CoStar that the timing reflects a broader shift in tenant sentiment, even in parts of Chicago that have struggled in recent years. He pointed to conversations with retailers at last week\u2019s International Council of Shopping Centers conference in\nNew York\n, where interest in the city appeared to be heating up.\nThe sale also continues a gradual pruning of Newcastle\u2019s\nportfolio\n. The firm bought the three Southport properties in separate deals in 2004, 2005 and 2015 for a combined $9 million, according to CoStar data. In recent years, it has been an active seller, including a $39 million disposition of retail at 1120 and 1130 North State Street in the\nGold Coast\n, where buyer Convexity Properties is expected to pursue a residential tower with new retail. Newcastle last year also sold adjacent apartment buildings in Rogers Park for nearly $17 million.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The sellers of the 173-unit property at 2131 Crestview Lane were James Busby and Irwin Deutscher, records show.\nLido Square was at risk of losing its affordable status if state agencies didn\u2019t step in, according to a report from a meeting\no\nf the\nCalifornia Debt Limit Allocation Committee and California Tax Credit Allocation Committee\nearlier this year.\nThey recommended tax credits that will preserve affordability for another 55 years.\nThe 173 units at Lido Square consist of 171 affordable units and two manager\u2019s units.

In Contra Costa County, that\napplies\nto individuals making between $33,600 and $87,550, or $47,950 and $125,050 for a household of four.\nThe deal to keep the apartments affordable is contingent on a budget set by the California Debt Limit Allocation Committee. That $149.1 million budget includes the $90 million purchase price, $23.1 million in renovation and rehabilitation costs and a $17.4 million developer fee.\nReliant Group Management secured $11 million in financing from the California Housing Finance Agency to help fund the acquisition. Reliant Group plans to take on renovation and rehabilitation work at Lido Square.\nThe California Debt Limit Allocation Committee and\nother state agencies provide funding\nor other favorable tax vehicles to support affordable residential projects across the state.

        "content": "Construction is officially underway on the first phase of Haggard Farm, a long-planned $750 million mixed-use development that aims to remake one of the largest undeveloped tracts left in\nPlano\n.\nWork began last week on the initial phase of the project at the southeast corner of Parkwood Boulevard and Spring Creek Parkway, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The opening salvo will include about 100,000 square feet of retail, 350 multifamily units, 188 townhomes, hike-and-bike trails and a 3-acre park. Vertical construction on the retail buildings is expected to take roughly 14 months, with residential pre-leasing slated to begin about the same time. Phase one is expected to take about two years to complete.\nDallas-based\nStillwater Capital Investments\nis developing the 142-acre site along the Dallas North Tollway, and broke ground on early infrastructure in 2023. The project has been in the works for years and finally brings large-scale development to land that remained mostly untouched for more than a century.\nPlano, the largest city in Collin County, has a population north of 290,000 and is already packed with corporate campuses and mixed-use projects. Median home values hover at about $410,000.\nStillwater\nmanaging director Clay Roby said in a statement that Haggard family\u2019s homestead existed on the development site for 170 years.\n\u201cThe seeds for this development were planted generations ago,\u201d Roby said.\nWhen fully built out, Haggard Farm\u2019s plans include roughly 200,000 square feet of retail, 700 apartments, 650,000 square feet of office space, a boutique hotel with a private social club and about 10 acres of green space. Retail anchors will include The Almanac 1856, an 8,000-square-foot farm-to-table restaurant and bar, and Haggard Hall, a 16,000-square-foot event barn. Both are expected to open in fall 2027.\nStillwater is partnering with Dallas-based Woodhouse on experiential elements, and with The Retail Connection on leasing. About 40 percent of the retail mix is slated for food and beverage, with an emphasis on vendors that sell what they produce. Plans call for gardens attached to restaurants, along with nods to the site\u2019s agricultural past, including orchards, a fishing pond and even livestock.\nOffices will come later, with build-to-suit opportunities planned for corporate users. Roby said designs and permits are already in hand, with marketing expected to begin in early 2026.\nThe Haggard family, which has owned the land since the mid-1800s, secured city approval in 2021 after discussions dating back to 2019. Historic structures on the property, including a mid-1850s home and a relocated schoolhouse, will be preserved and folded into the project \u2014 a nod to Plano\u2019s past meeting its next wave of\ngrowth\n.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "New York office leasing finally\nshook out\nof its pandemic-era rut in 2025.\nIn the year that JP Morgan opened its new\n$3 billion headquarters\nat 270 Park Avenue as the ne plus ultra of the workplace, tenants showed that the office is not, in fact, dead.\nThe kinds of mega-deals that epitomized office leasing\u2019s boom years (we\u2019re looking at you, NYU, taking 1 million square feet) are back, and they\u2019re helping drive the market to record numbers.\nManhattan was on track in December to top 40 million square feet worth of deals for the year, which would be the first time it crossed that number since 2019.\nAll that activity is helping take a bite out of the glut of space left in the wake of the shutdown: Manhattan availability came down to 14.2 percent in December, according to Colliers. That\u2019s the lowest level since late 2020.\nHere are the biggest office leasing deals of 2025.\n1) New York University | 770 Broadway | 1,067,383 sf\nSteve Roth\u2019s Vornado Realty Trust set the tone for the year in the spring, when\nit signed\nNYU to a 1.1 million-square-foot master lease at its 770 Broadway building in Greenwich Village.\nThe school said the space will be a hub for engineering, science and technology, converting the vacant floors to laboratories, classrooms and workstations. NYU has plans to eventually move some departments from rented space elsewhere as existing leases expire.\nFor its part, Vornado used some of the $935 million upfront payment NYU made to repay the property\u2019s $700 million mortgage. The lease has a 70-year term with options for NYU to buy the office portion of the building in 2055 and at the end of the lease.\nIt was the biggest lease in Manhattan since 2018 when WarnerMedia (formerly known as Time Warner) inked a deal for 1.5 million square feet in Related Companies and Oxford Properties Group\u2019s 30 Hudson Yards.\n2) Jane Street Capital | 250 Vesey Street | 1,000,000 sf\nJane Street Capital inked a new megalease at Brookfield Properties\u2019 250 Vesey Street, where the quant trading firm has been growing for the past decade.\nThe firm\nsigned\na new long-term lease for 1 million square feet at the Brookfield Place building in a 400,000-square-foot expansion. The company had originally relocated to the property in 2014 when it signed on for about 117,000 square feet, growing over the years to 600,000 before the recent deal.\nJane Street\u2019s expansion was so big that Brookfield had to relocate its own corporate offices in the building in order to make way for the trading firm\u2019s growing space.\n3) Deloitte | 70 Hudson Yards | 807,000 sf\nRelated Companies\nsigned\nthe accounting and consulting firm Deloitte as the anchor tenant for its latest Hudson Yards tower.\nDeloitte agreed to lease 800,000 square feet at 70 Hudson Yards, the 47-story, 1.1-million-square-foot building Related broke ground on in June. The new tower will include a large event space, private dining, a media-podcast studio and \u201cred eye\u201d suites for use after flights.\nDeloitte\u2019s big lease is a sign that major companies want to occupy high-quality spaces as they bring workers back to the office, and it\u2019s one of a handful of deals in 2025 that helped kick off new office developments.\n4) Citadel | 660 Fifth Avenue | 502,528 sf\nSpeaking of development-driving tenants, Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel (which in 2022 partnered with Vornado and Rudin to kick off 350 Park Avenue) is still hungry for more space.\nThe market-making securities firm\nsigned on\nfor 504,000 square feet at Brookfield Properties\u2019 660 Fifth Avenue. The owner recently completed a $400 million redevelopment and modernization of the 1.25 million-square-foot building formerly known as 666 Fifth.\nCitadel is expected to move from one of its current locations at 350 Park Avenue, which will be torn down (along with 40 E. 52nd Street) and redeveloped by Vornado and Rudin as a 1.8 million-square-foot, 1,600-foot-tall tower designed by Foster + Partners.\nCitadel signed on as the anchor tenant, agreeing to take about 850,000 square feet.\n5) United Nations Association | Two United Nations Plaza | 425,190 sf\nThe United Nations consolidated its office space as part of a $500 million development plan for One and Two United Nations Plaza.\nThe U.N. signed a lease for 425,190 square feet of space across 26 stories at 2 United Nations Plaza, in addition to two stories of retail at 1 United Nations Plaza.\nThe landlord is the United Nations Development Corporation, a public benefit corporation established by New York State.

        "content": "Texas is still waiting for snow, but the data center cascade doesn\u2019t show signs of stopping.\nIn December alone, the combined construction budget for new data centers in Texas exceeds $1.4 billion, according to Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation filings. That\u2019s over 40 percent of the total $3.4 billion cost of new data center construction projects registered in 2025.\nWhile data center speculators are\nbullish\non the\nPermian Basin\n\u2014 an energy-rich, sparsely populated region in Far West Texas \u2014 this month\u2019s projects are more centrally located in the state, with two in the Texas Triangle.\nFacebook is spending $197 million to add a 145,00-square-foot, single-story data center to its\ncomplex in Temple\n, a city between Austin and Waco on the I-35 corridor, according to a filing that scheduled the project\u2019s start date as Monday of this week. The building at 2230 Eberhardt Road is slated for completion in September.\nThe most expensive of these projects all year is in Midlothian, just south of Dallas/Fort Worth, where Google has budgeted $880 million for a one-story, 288,000-square-foot data center. Demand for data centers put\nDFW in second place nationally among data center markets\nin 2024, according to CBRE.\nAnd in Haskell, a Panhandle Plains town more than two hours west of Fort Worth, Google began work on a $350 million, 350,000-square-foot project this month. It\u2019s the company\u2019s second data center project in the area, following plans for a 280,000-square-foot building filed earlier this year. The facilities are going up near a new solar and battery storage plant, according to Google.\nHaskell is West Texas, but it\u2019s not Far West Texas, where cloud computing company CoreWeave and Poolside, a Nvidia-backed startup, are planning a\n500-acre data center named Horizon\n. Capitalizing on the promise of cheap power offered by the Permian Basin\u2019s oil and natural gas reserves, Horizon will generate its own electricity.\n",

The interests in the hospitality properties are located in 17 states across the country, including more than a dozen in New York City.\nThe portfolio is derived from Sonder\u2019s business model, which saw it sign long-term leases with apartment and hotel owners, then turning around and renting out units as short-term rentals.\nInterested parties can put in bids for as many or as few leasehold interests as they\u2019d like. But they need to act quickly, as the first round of bids is due by Dec. 30.\n\u201cGordon Brothers has been fully engaged in this process and we are confident that their team will provide valuable assistance to maximize value for the estates,\u201d said the trustee managing Sonder\u2019s wind-down.\nSonder bit the dust a little more than a month ago, announcing plans for an immediate end to operations and the pursuit of Chapter 7 liquidation of its United States business.\nThe announcement came one day after Sonder\u2019s partnership with Marriott International\ncollapsed\n; Marriott terminated its licensing agreement with Sonder, alleging the short-term operator was in default on an agreement signed last year.\n\u201cWe are devastated to reach a point where a liquidation is the only viable path forward,\u201d interim chief executive officer Janice Sears said in a statement at the time.\nThe company\u2019s market value before the shutdown announcement was $6.79 million, according to LSEG, a far drop from the $2.2 billion valuation at the time of its initial public offering in 2021.\nIn its final quarterly report, Sonder noted \u201csubstantial doubt\u201d about its ability to remain as a going concern. As of the end of June, Sonder counted $1 billion of assets and $1.5 billion in liabilities.\nThe U.S. Bankruptcy Court\napproved\nthe sale of Sonder\u2019s assets last week.

        "content": "More than three dozen owners of marquee commercial properties are suing Broward County Property Appraiser Marty Kiar, alleging his office improperly calculated market and assessed values, saddling them with inflated tax bills.\nThe lawsuits, filed between November and this month in Broward County Circuit Court, involve some of the county\u2019s best-known hotels, office towers and retail complexes.\nThe properties are in\nFort Lauderdale\n, Hallandale Beach, Hollywood, Pompano Beach and other major Broward cities.\nThe cases challenge how Kiar\u2019s office valued high-profile commercial real estate assets across sectors, from hospitality and gaming to Class A office and regional retail.\nThe property owners allege the appraiser\u2019s methodologies overstate real market value, which in turn drove up their property taxes.\nMany of the complaints were filed during a narrow legal window tied to the certification of the tax roll, after challenges to the county\u2019s value adjustment board. The timing of the litigation reflects the certification deadline rather than an unusual spike in controversy, said Mila Schwartzreich, general counsel for the Broward property appraiser.\nProperty owners have 60 days from the date the value adjustment board certifies the tax rolls to file lawsuits. They are prohibited from doing so once the 60-day deadline expires, Schwartzreich said.\nEach county certifies its tax roll on a different schedule, so litigation waves often track those calendars rather than broader market shifts, she said.\nBroward processes significantly more parcels than some entire states, but relatively few assessments end up in court compared to other Florida counties, including Miami-Dade, she said.\nMost of the plaintiffs are represented by Samuel Brandan Lynch, a shareholder with the Orlando-based law firm Lowndes. He told\nThe Real Deal\nhe is not authorized to comment on the cases.\nAmong the owners suing Kiar\u2019s office are Trinity Investments, led by Sean Hehir, and Credit Suisse, which own the Diplomat Beach Resort Hollywood. The property appraiser determined the oceanfront, 1,000-room hotel at 3555 Ocean Drive in Hollywood had a market and assessed value of $589.9 million in 2024, court records show. The owners paid roughly $12.3 million in property taxes.\nIn 2023, Trinity and Credit Suisse paid roughly\n$850 million\nfor the resort and two adjacent parcels that the partnership subsequently sold to Aventura-based BH Group and Coconut Grove-based Related Group.\nOther notable plaintiffs include:\nAn affiliate of New York-based Brookfield, led by Bruce Fiatt, which owns the\nHilton Fort Lauderdale Marina\n, a 595-room hotel at 181 Southeast 17th Street. Kiar\u2019s office determined the property had a market value of $140.3 million and an assessed value of $139.9 million in 2024. The owner paid $2.6 million in property taxes. In 2018, Brookfield paid $170.6 million for the hotel.\nAn affiliate of Russell Galbut\u2019s Miami-based GFO Investments, Fort Lauderdale-based InSite Group, Atlas Hill Real Estate and Prime Finance. The joint venture owns Galleria Fort Lauderdale, an indoor mall at 2414 East Sunrise Boulevard that Kiar\u2019s office determined had a market value $74.4 million and an assessed value $74.3 million in 2024. The partnership paid $101,215 in property taxes. The joint venture acquired the mall for\n$73 million\nin September.\nAn affiliate of The Stronach Group, led by Belinda Stronach, which owns\nGulfstream Park\nat 901 South Federal Highway in Hallandale Beach. The property appraiser determined the gambling, retail and entertainment site has a market value of $87.4 million and an assessed value of $85.7 million in 2024. Stronach\u2019s affiliate paid $1.3 million in property taxes.\nAn affiliate of Fort Lauderdale-based Stiles Corporation, led by Kenneth Stiles. The development firm owns the\nAutoNation office building\nat 200 Southwest First Avenue in Fort Lauderdale. Kiar\u2019s office determined the property had a market value of $78.6 million and an assessed value of $72.8 million in 2024. The Stiles affiliate paid $1.4 million in property taxes.",

Air quality, access to open space and potential displacement of residents and businesses are top concerns.\n\u201cThe rezoning represents a wholescale departure from longstanding public policy that respects air quality, health concerns, open space, air and light, stress on sensitive historical sites, socioeconomic displacement and priorities for affordable housing,\u201d the lawsuit states.\nMudd faces an uphill battle. Jack Lester, an attorney who\nfiled unsuccessful lawsuits\ncontesting City of Yes and the recent charter revision ballot questions, is arguing the nonprofit\u2019s case on similar grounds to those dismissed cases.\nIn August, the City Council unanimously approved the Midtown South Mixed-Use Plan, rezoning 42 blocks in the Midtown neighborhood for housing development. It\u2019s expected to result in 9,535 housing units \u2014 2,842 set aside as affordable \u2014 representing the city\u2019s largest residential rezoning in 20 years.\nThe rezoning created two new high-density residential\ndistricts\nthat require Mandatory Inclusionary Housing and also allowed for the construction of housing projects up to 15 and 18 times the size of their lots. It was the first time that these districts were used after the state lifted the city\u2019s long-standing cap on residential floor area ratio of 12.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A long-dormant Gold Coast development site could finally get moving again.\nConvexity Properties wants to build a 28-story apartment tower at the corner of State and Elm streets in Chicago, reviving a prominent parcel where a previous owner\u2019s high-rise plan stalled for four years. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat the developer unveiled its proposal during an online community meeting Monday hosted by 2nd Ward Alderman Brian Hopkins\u2019 office.\nConvexity\n, the real estate arm of Chicago-based trading firm DRW Holdings, is planning a 307-unit apartment tower at 1120 and 1130 North State Street. The firm bought the site for $39 million\nin August\nfrom\nNewcastle Investors\n, which had secured Chicago City Council approval in 2021 for a slightly taller project, but never broke ground.\nNewcastle\u2019s approved plan called for a 304-unit, 345-foot tower. Convexity\u2019s version would top out at about 312 feet and feature a different design: two interlocking L-shaped towers rising from a multi-story podium containing nearly 24,000 square feet of retail space.\nWhy Newcastle walked away remains unclear, but interest rates, surging construction costs and a tougher capital markets environment have knocked out numerous Chicago proposals since the pandemic. The result has been a thin development pipeline, with fewer than 600 new rental units expected to deliver across downtown in 2026, the outlet reported.\nConvexity is now shopping for financing, director Chris Oakley told the publication, though he declined to disclose estimated development costs, adding that the\nGold Coast\nsite is in a prominent locale.\nThe site is currently occupied by a vacant two-story former Barnes &amp; Noble that has sat dark for years, along with a Lou Malnati\u2019s restaurant at 1120 North State Street. That lease expires in summer 2026 without an extension option, though Oakley said the pizza chain could reappear in the new retail space.\nThe apartment mix would include studios, one-, two- and three-bedroom units. Convexity plans to designate eight apartments as affordable and pay roughly $4.5 million in in-lieu fees under the city\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance, rather than providing more on-site affordable housing.\nBecause the zoning was already approved for Newcastle\u2019s project, Convexity does not need a new City Council vote. The plan still requires administrative approval from the Department of Planning and Development to confirm zoning compliance.\nHopkins said the earlier proposal faced some neighborhood resistance, forcing a height reduction, but there\u2019s broad agreement that the long-languishing vacant retail site has become a problem.\nIf approved, Convexity aims to start construction in June and complete the tower in spring 2028. The firm has a track record nearby, including the Viceroy Hotel next door and the condo building at 4 East Elm Street.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The project is being developed in a nod toward Allapattah\u2019s growth as an arts and culture district.\nThe project marks a new partnership between\nCalderon\nand the\nRubells\n, both powerhouses in the Allapattah neighborhood. It also comes amid a South Florida multifamily\nslowdown\ndue to hefty deliveries of new units in the past two years, and a calmer influx of out-of-staters, leading to slower lease-ups and more concessions.\nDevelopers have argued the market will\npick up\nby the time they finish their apartment projects in the coming years.\nThe Rubell family owns the 1-acre development site where the first highrise is planned, property records show. The land also is near the\nRubell Museum\n, a 100,000-square-foot art campus with 33 galleries in several interconnected warehouses. The museum is at 1100 Northwest 23rd Street.\nThe Rubells, who have been Miami Beach developers for years, opened their collection to the public in 1993 in Miami\u2019s Wynwood. Over the past decade, Wynwood was supercharged as an arts district and real estate market, and the Rubells moved their collection to Allapattah in 2019, where they\u2019ve also been amassing properties.\nSimkins\u2019 Lion has partnered on projects elsewhere in Miami, including the 659-unit\n38 West Eleventh Residences Miami\ncondo tower with PMG and Marc Roberts, one of a slew of towers the trio plans.\nAllapattah, traditionally a Dominican enclave where the primary industry once was fruitpacking, has attracted developers\u2019 and gallerists\u2019 eyes.\nIn Allapattah, Calderon\u2019s completed apartment projects in recent years include the 192-unit\nNo. 17 Residences\n, finished in 2021; the 323-unit\nThe Julia Residences\n, which was finished this year; and the 237-unit\nFourteen Main Street Residences\n, also completed this year.\n",

        "content": "Just as one lawsuit clears up for Ruben Espinoza, another one takes its place.\nThe Florida-based real estate investor is currently involved in at least six ongoing lawsuits related to his business dealings in the Chicago area while facing default judgments in two others.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of his active and recently resolved legal disputes related to Chicago-area commercial property deals.\nPartners turn on each other at 300 West Adams\nEspinoza and Chicago-based investor Igor Gabal scored the deal of a lifetime in late 2023 when they bought a struggling office building at 300 West Adams\nfor $4 million or $17 a foot\n.\nBut after\nsuccessfully fighting off a legal challenge\nfrom\na pair of investors\nwho claimed they were cut out of a deal to buy the building, Espinoza and Gabal\nturned on each other\n.\nEspinoza filed a lawsuit against Gabal in May, claiming he had mishandled a $6.2 million insurance payout and should no longer have access to their shared bank accounts.\nAs the legal drama dragged on over the past year, Gabal\u2019s defense requested that a judge dismiss the lawsuit altogether because he claimed that Espinoza has been exhibiting the same behavior that he is accusing Gabal of engaging in.\nGabal claimed in a filing last month that Espinoza should not be granted sole access to their shared bank accounts because he has allegedly siphoned off $1.5 million without Gabal\u2019s consent.\nThe lawsuit is still pending in Cook County Circuit Court.\nEspinoza didn\u2019t return a request for comment and neither did his attorneys regarding this dispute or any others mentioned in this story.\nLender wins receiver request amid a $68M foreclosure dispute\nIf Espinoza has any hope of hanging onto a portfolio of Southwest Side commercial buildings, it is likely dwindling.\nLast month, a judge appointed receiver Scott Shefman of Friedman Real Estate Management to take control of Espinoza\u2019s portfolio of two commercial buildings amid an ongoing foreclosure dispute filed by Wilmington National Trust.\nEspinoza\nhas defaulted on $68 million in mortgage debts\nhe took on for commercial complexes on Chicago\u2019s Southwest Side, according to Wilmington.\nHe allegedly owes more than $43 million, including interest and fees, for the Chicago Business Center, a 661,000-square-foot mixed-use building with office space and a distribution facility at 2600 West 35th Street.\nThe remaining $24 million he owes is tied to a 110,000-square-foot distribution center just across the Chicago River to the northwest, at 2455 South Damen Avenue.\nIndian Lakes Hotel heads to court for a second time\nEspinoza\u2019s plans to revive a storied suburban hotel along with hospitality magnate Robert Habeeb quickly went south last year when lender CRE Bridge Capital foreclosed on the property, alleging that the pair of investors had\ndefaulted on a $3.5 million bridge loan\non the property known as The Indian Lakes Hotel.\nSoon after, the lender sold the vacant hotel to the village of Bloomingdale for $5 million.\nBut Espinoza and Habeeb\u2019s involvement with the hotel didn\u2019t end there.\nThe pair are suing CRE Bridge Capital, led by Daniel Sobelman, in a complaint filed last month alleging that the lender never had the legal standing to file the foreclosure and ultimately sell the property.\nEspinoza and Habeeb allege payment statements CRE Bridge Capital issued to the borrowers were \u201cuntimely, inaccurate and in some cases, incomprehensible.\u201d\nAs a result, CRE Bridge Capital \u201cmanufactured a breach of loan agreement \u2026 to seize Plaintiff\u2019s real estate in a collusive UCC sale for a pittance,\u201d Espinoza and Habeeb argue.\nThe lawsuit claims the property could have been worth up to $70 million after Espinoza and Habeeb completed their redevelopment plans.\nA hearing on the matter is scheduled for January 14.\nA state senator\u2019s property tax law firm scores a win\nEspinoza\u2019s legal troubles entered the political realm earlier this year.\nState Sen. Robert F. Martwick Jr., who represents Illinois\u2019 10th Senate District\nfiled a lawsuit against Espinoza earlier\nin July for failing to pay Martwick\u2019s law firm, Finkel, Martwick &amp; Colson.\nMartwick\u2019s firm claimed it was owed more than $1 million by Espinoza and his real estate ventures.\nThe law firm netted property tax savings for the landlord at big Chicago buildings, all of which are now subject to foreclosure proceedings. Finkel\u2019s contracts with Espinoza, which were signed by Martwick, pertain to its tax work for each of the last four years, according to the complaint filed in Cook County court in July.\nIn October, a judge issued a default order, requiring Espinoza to pay the law firm $631,000 in damages.\nAnother portfolio faces foreclosure\nIn another foreclosure case, Espinoza is fighting back.\nHe is\nfacing a foreclosure lawsuit\nover a $9.6 million loan he took on for a set of River North loft office buildings at 215-223 West Ohio Street.\nRialto Capital filed the foreclosure in March, but rather than give up the keys, Espinoza is disputing the foreclosure.\nThe case is still pending.\nA commercial tenant claims fraud\nFor the second time, a commercial tenant is claiming Espinoza took a deposit and first month\u2019s rent but never allowed them to move in.\nProduce wholesaler Galfresh Produce signed a lease with Espinoza to move into one of his commercial spaces but, the company alleges in a June lawsuit, it was never granted access to the space.\nThe Damen avenue commercial building is the same property currently being foreclosed on by Wilmington Trust.\nGalfresh is suing Espinoza in an effort to recoup its $98,000 deposit and the $49,000 the company put down as first month\u2019s rent.\nThe dispute mirrors\na similar lawsuit filed by a local soccer club\nlast year that claimed Espinoza also took a deposit and first month of rent for a space that was occupied by another tenant who had no plans to move out. That case was dismissed without prejudice but re-filed in October 2025 with the soccer club\u2019s lawyer alleging it still hadn\u2019t been paid back.\nIn October, a judge ordered Espinoza pay Galfresh back but Espinoza is fighting that order, claiming he was never properly served.\nA personal loan goes unpaid\nAs Espinoza forged ahead in his other legal battles, he was hit with another filing December 5.\nAn entity known as Ohio Street Investments claims that Espinoza has failed to pay back a $350,000 personal loan that Ohio Street Investments issued to him in late 2022.\nThe case is pending.\n",

        "content": "A long-vacant office tower in downtown Galveston is finally poised for a comeback, with plans to reopen as a boutique hotel after sitting empty for decades.\nPort Arthur-based Itex Group expects to kick off construction in February on the historic Medical Arts Building at 302 Moody Avenue, redeveloping the 11-story structure into a 120-room hotel dubbed The Quay,\naccording\nto the Houston Business Journal. The project hinges on recently secured city permits and would mark the closest the property has come to redevelopment since the 1980s.\nThe hotel will join Hilton\u2019s Tapestry Collection, a brand aimed at locally styled, independent properties, with Florida-based\nDriftwood Hospitality Management\ntapped to operate it, the outlet reported. Plans call for a mix of suites and rooms, along with a ground-floor restaurant and bar. Itex is targeting a January 2028 opening.\nThe building\u2019s site is part of the bet. Sitting at the edge of The Strand district and within a few blocks of Galveston\u2019s cruise terminals and Pier 21, the property is aimed to capture leisure travelers and event-driven demand, as well as business tied to nearby corporations and the\nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch\n.\nItex bought the property in 2016 intending to convert it into apartments, an idea previously floated by former owner Andy Vickery, who also explored a timeshare concept, according to the Galveston County Daily News. The pandemic ultimately pushed Itex to abandon the residential plan in favor of hospitality, which CEO Chris Akbari said now pencils out better, given Galveston\u2019s tourism and cruise traffic.\nThe Medical Arts Building dates to 1929 and was developed by William L. Moody Jr.\u2019s American National Insurance Company as an annex to its nearby headquarters. Once home to medical offices, the tower has been vacant since the 1980s and has deteriorated significantly. Parts of the exterior have fallen away, windows are missing and the interior was fully gutted years ago.\nItex plans to tackle the exterior first before rebuilding the interior, balancing historic preservation with modern hotel layouts.\nHouston-based MCS Architects\nis designing the project, while a general contractor has yet to be selected.\nThe redevelopment would land amid a broader refresh of Galveston\u2019s hotel stock. Several marquee properties have recently undergone renovations, including Tremont House and Grand Galvez, while Hotel Lucine reopened in 2023 after decades as a roadside motel, according to the publication. On the island\u2019s East Beach, Dallas-based\nRREAF Holdings\nis pushing ahead with a $700 million Margaritaville resort and residential project.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The fresh financing replaces a $170 million loan from real estate finance and investment management firm PCCP.\nA Walker &amp; Dunlop team including Aaron Appel, Jonathan Schwartz and Keith Kurland arranged the loan on behalf of the landlord.\nThe refinancing follows a $107 million capital improvement program that transformed the landmarked 278,000-square-foot property into a loft-style Class A office building.

        "content": "As Netflix and Paramount fight to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, Hackman Capital Partners is bracing for impact.\nLos Angeles-based Hackman, the largest independent owner and operator of soundstages, is facing high studio vacancy rates and depressed rents, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. The firm owns more than 60 soundstages at six studio properties in the L.A. region but has seen occupancy shift as more productions move outside the city.\nRegardless of whether Netflix or Paramount emerges as the buyer of Warner Bros. Discovery, demand for soundstage space will likely drop as Warner Bros. owns a large amount of\nits own studio real estate\n, leading the new buyer to shift production from leased stages to its owned facilities.\n\u201cThe whole ecosystem is really under distress,\u201d Michael Hackman, CEO of Hackman Capital, told the Journal.\nFilm and TV productions are pursuing cheaper labor and filming costs overseas as countries like Canada,\nAustralia\nand some European nations offer incentives to work there instead.\nHackman is hopeful that the\nTrump\nadministration will back the U.S. entertainment business with tariffs on countries offering these incentives and tax breaks for productions that stay local for filming. \u201cA lot is going to depend on support from the government helping to offset some of these advantages they have outside the U.S.,\u201d Hackman said.\nHackman began investing heavily in\nstudio ownership\na decade ago with its acquisition of Culver Studios in 2014. Since then, the firm has bought more than 2 million square feet of production space worldwide, most of it in the Los Angeles region. The 2023 writers\u2019 and actors\u2019 strikes led to increased studio cost-cutting, reflected in the exodus to other filming locations today.\nLast year saw nearly 30 percent fewer big-budget U.S. film and TV projects begin shooting compared to 2022, per ProdProp data cited by the Journal. This year continued the downward trend with an additional 12 percent drop through November compared with the same period in 2024.\n\u201cWe all thought that when the strikes ended, there would be all this pent-up demand for Hollywood production,\u201d John Kim, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, told the Journal. \u201cBut it\u2019s spread out. Even though [content companies] are based in Los Angeles, they can produce anywhere globally.\u201d\nFor now, Hackman is tightening up its finances, which includes scaling back the construction of a major campus planned in the Dublin, Ireland, area. If local production in Los Angeles doesn\u2019t return to its former heights, studio landlords like Hackman may have to\nfind other uses for their soundstage campuses\n, such as live events and themed attractions based on movies.\n\u201cThe industry is evolving,\u201d Hackman said. \u201cWe can\u2019t stay passive.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Citadel is quietly pulling back further from Chicago, downsizing its remaining local operations and vacating the downtown tower that once bore its name.\nThe hedge fund is relocating what\u2019s left of its Chicago staff into roughly 50,000 square feet north of the Chicago River to 353 North Clark Street, according to people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg News\nreported\n. The new office amounts to about 10 percent of the space Citadel occupied in 2020, when it was the main tenant at the 37-story Citadel Center at\n131 South Dearborn Street\n. The Loop tower is now\non the market\nand no longer carries the firm\u2019s branding.\nThe move highlights how thoroughly billionaire founder\nKen Griffin\nhas unwound Citadel\u2019s Chicago presence since decamping to Florida. Citadel shifted its headquarters to Miami in 2022 and has steadily relocated staff to Miami and New York. The firm once employed roughly 1,100 people in Chicago. That number has dropped to about 200, according to the publication.\nGriffin\u2019s high-profile exit, driven by public complaints over taxes, crime and governance, has become a touchstone in Chicago\u2019s ongoing debate over its business climate. Mayor Brandon Johnson is now pushing a revived version of the city\u2019s controversial \u201chead tax,\u201d proposing a\n$33-per-employee levy\non companies with at least 500 workers to fund public safety. Business groups and much of the City Council oppose the idea. Former mayor Rahm Emanuel once dubbed the tax a \u201cjob killer.\u201d\nCitadel\u2019s pullback adds to a list of corporate departures that includes Boeing, Caterpillar and Tyson Foods. But Griffin\u2019s move carries outsized symbolic and economic weight, stripping the city of some of its highest-paid finance jobs and a major philanthropic benefactor. The outlet reported that Griffin donated more than $600 million to Chicago institutions, including a $125 million gift to the city\u2019s science museum, now named for him. Since relocating, he has directed hundreds of millions of dollars to Florida causes.\nThe retrenchment has rippled through real estate as well. Griffin reportedly took a roughly $30 million loss unloading six luxury condos in the Gold Coast. His final Chicago property remains unsold.\nChicago\u2019s finance sector has also felt the sting. State data show finance employment in Illinois is down nearly 3 percent since Griffin left, a blow to a city that helped invent the modern futures market and remains home to CME Group and Cboe Global Markets.\nCity Hall has pushed back on the narrative that Chicago is hostile to business. A spokesperson for Johnson told Bloomberg that Griffin left for political reasons, not economic ones, and pointed to recent large downtown leases as evidence of resilience. Still, Johnson\u2019s approval ratings have sagged, voters rejected his proposed hike to the real estate transfer tax on high-end sales, and Governor JB Pritzker vowed to veto a financial transaction tax.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

There would also be 3,300 square feet of retail space on the ground floor fronting Madison Avenue.\nInterior demolition of the office building is already underway and the final tenants are expected to leave after Christmas, according to an adviser to Kensico. Tenants at the building at the time the\napplication was filed\nin August include investment firm Banyan Tree Capital Management, private equity firm Yellowstone Capital Partners and Kensico itself.\nFull demolition and construction is expected to start at the beginning of the new year, targeting an early 2028 completion.\nIn 2017, Kensico\nput its leasehold of the office property on the market\n, even though it boasted high occupancy rates that remained strong. The leasehold never sold, forcing the pivot.\nKensico has developed and invested more than $2 billion in real estate across the globe, spanning office, retail and hospitality properties. The Lowell Hotel, which it acquired in the 1980s, is considered one of the more luxurious hospitality properties in all of New York City.\nBut hotel development has become increasingly hard to come by in the Big Apple, and not just because of how the pandemic temporarily disrupted tourism. A 2021 City Council bill mandated a special permit for new hotel developments, essentially\nfreezing the sector\u2019s construction pipeline\n; not a single permit was approved in the first year of the legislation.\nThe daunting prospect of developing a hotel today could come with a big reward on the other end. The lack of incoming supply \u2014 plus a crackdown on the short-term rental industry \u2014 is helping to boost the occupancy and room rates of properties that hung tight through the lean years.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Another mixed-use project was approved in Boca Raton\u2019s 700-acre Park at Broken Sound, adding to the pipeline of new developments planned in the former business park.\nOn Tuesday, the Boca Raton City Council unanimously approved two ordinances and three resolutions that will allow Aventura-based Meyers Accesso to build a 290,000-square-foot, 222-unit apartment project next to the Atrium at Broken Sound office building at 6111 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway.\nThe\nBoca Raton project\n, which was unanimously backed by the city\u2019s planning and zoning board in November, will include about 2,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space, a rooftop pool deck, 23 affordable units and 12 workforce apartments. The developers will also be required to build a 2,000-square-foot dog park on site, Jim Bell, a Boca Raton project manager, told council members.\nAn affiliate of Meyers Accesso, a joint venture between Aventura-based Meyers Group, now led by CEO Alan Losada, and Hallandale Beach-based Accesso Partners, acquired the 10.5-acre office property that\u2019s adjacent to an 18-hole golf course for\n$25 million in 2024\n.\nThe Atrium project is just one of developments that are moving forward within or near the Park at Broken Sound. The largest among them is the\nredevelopment of Office Depot\u2019s headquarters\nby BH Group, PEBB Enterprises and the Real Group. That will include a revamped 405,000-square-foot office complex, a 37,000-square-foot\nEquinox\ngym, and a\n500-unit apartment building\n.\nOther projects slated to be built in the Park at Broken Sound area include a 334,000-square-foot\nmixed-income complex with 289 apartments\nat 900 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway that was approved by the Boca Raton City Council in July. And in March, Oak Lane Partners\u2019 Bhavin Shah proposed building a\n243-unit Live Local Act project\nnext to its Park at Broken Sound headquarters at 791 Park of Commerce Boulevard.\nMore recently in September, New York-based Tishman Speyer paid\n$125 million\nfor the 270-unit Bell at Broken Sound Apartments.\nWhat won\u2019t be going forward are plans by Beztak and Wexford Real Estate to\nadd another 21 apartments and a fitness center\nto their previously approved\n277-unit\nBocora apartment project within the 21.4-acre Amtec Center business park at 6401-6481 Congress Avenue. The developers withdrew their request but still plan to designate a small Xceed Preparatory Academy tutoring center now operating in an Amtec Center office building as a private school. That request was also unanimously approved by the Boca Raton City Council this week.",

The property, at 735 South Figueroa Street, includes 330,000 square feet of gross leasable area anchored by tenants such as Target, Sephora and Zara. The center is 85.8 percent occupied, per the broker.\nThe mall \u201ccould fetch $70 million,\u201d according to Green Street.\nThat would put the price around $210 per square foot, well off the $915 per square foot fetched by the Runway Playa Vista retail component a couple months ago, per a CBRE\nreport\n, and the $711 per square foot price of One Westside in the Sawtelle neighborhood.\nBrookfield\u2019s property, meanwhile, is at the heart of L.A\u00a0 \u2014 kitty-corner from the 7th Street Metro Center and adjacent to the Korean Air building, the tallest of the city\u2019s skyscrapers.\nBrookfield is nearly at the end of a three-year\nextension\non a $58.5 million loan it got from MetLife. In any case, Brookfield is vacating the Financial District, which generally is considered to include Bunker Hill, where the commercial giant, lenders, special servicers and receivers have individual hands in peddling four\ndistressed offices\n, with a combined square footage that accounts for about 18 percent of Class A space in the area.\nThe office properties connected to Brookfield and currently on the market include\nBank of America Plaza\n, Wells Fargo Center\u2019s twin towers and\nEY Plaza\n.\nAnother downtown retail property Brookfield owns, on the same parcel as Wells Fargo Center\u2019s North Tower, is called the Halo.

        "content": "A major North San Antonio retail complex changed hands, marking one of the region\u2019s largest shopping center trades this year.\nWest Palm Beach, Florida-based Sterling Organization sold the 45.6-acre Park North Shopping Center, adjacent to North Star Mall, for $115 million, the San Antonio Express-News\nreported\n. The buyer is Houston-based\nDhanani Private Equity Group\n, marking its first acquisition in the Alamo City.\nThe 635,000-square-foot property is at 842 Northwest Loop 410 and is anchored by a Super Target. The sale did not include the Aloft hotel on Blanco Road or the former Sears building on San Pedro Avenue, which has been permanently shuttered.\nSterling\nbought the retail center in 2016 for $81 million, netting a sizable gain after nearly a decade.\nPark North was built in 2004 as an entertainment-driven retail center on the former site of Central Park Mall, one of San Antonio\u2019s earliest enclosed malls. That property, opened in 1968, fell into decline by the 1990s and was demolished in 2003. Developers\nPGIM Real Estate\nand local investor Mark Granados restructured the site as a 24-hour shopping center, leaning heavily into dining and entertainment.\nToday, Park North includes a mix of national, regional and local tenants, including Pinstack, Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, Norris Conference Centers, World Market and Outlaw Pickleball. The center draws roughly 7.1 million visitors annually, ranking it among the most heavily trafficked shopping destinations in the metro area, according to the outlet.\nSterling said in a press release that it boosted occupancy at the property from 73 percent to 93 percent during its ownership, including through the pandemic, when entertainment-heavy retail faced acute pressure. The firm continues to own other San Antonio projects, including Thousand Oaks Shopping Center and the Village at Stone Oak. It sold the Grandview Shopping Center for $21.9 million in 2017.\nThe deal is a beachhead for\nDhanani\nin a tight retail market. According to Weitzman\u2019s mid-year report, San Antonio retail occupancy is at a near-record 95.2 percent, driven by steady tenant demand and limited new construction. The metro has maintained occupancy above 90 percent for 15 straight years, commanding premium pricing.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The mystery buyer of one of the Chicago area\u2019s priciest home sales this year stepped into the light \u2014 and he\u2019s planning a careful refresh of a North Shore landmark.\nCal Akin, a Brookfield, Wisconsin-based multifamily developer, paid $11 million in October for an eight-bedroom, 11,787-square-foot Georgian-style mansion on nearly 9 acres at 930 East Rosemary Road in Lake Forest, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. The deal equates to $933 per square foot and ranks as the seventh-highest-priced\nhome sale\nin the region so far this year, trailing only a pair of $30 million-plus Winnetka trades and a handful of other North Shore megadeals.\nThe\nmansion\nincludes nine bathrooms, seven fireplaces, a conservatory, coach house, elevator access to all four levels and a dramatic bifurcated staircase. The\nKrehbiel family\nlisted the estate in August 2024 for just under $15 million, making the final $11 million price tag about 27 percent off the asking price. Akin ultimately bought it through an Illinois trust tied to a Delaware entity that masked his identity, according to the Tribune. The property spans five parcels with a combined 2024 tax bill of about $126,000.\nThe estate, known as Camp Rosemary, sits just southeast of\nLake Forest College\nand spans 8.8 acres assembled over decades. Akin already received permission from city officials to begin limited interior demolition to assess the scope of renovations and hired Libertyville-based Landmark Luxury Group, led by Zoran Mijatovic, as general contractor. He is also working with what he described to city officials as a \u201ccelebrated U.K. garden designer\u201d to enhance the property\u2019s extensive grounds.\nAkin wrote in a Nov. 25 email to city officials that he intends to preserve and elevate the estate\u2019s landscaping.\nThe mansion was built in the early 1900s for retail magnate John T. Pirie Sr. and designed by noted architect Benjamin Marshall. Its original gardens were laid out in the 1920s by prominent landscape architect Rose Standish Nichols. Over the decades, the home passed through a roster of prominent owners, including Laurance H. Armour Jr. of the Armour meatpacking family.\nThe most recent longtime owner, the late Kennetha Love \u201cPosy\u201d Krehbiel, held the estate for 34 years. She and her then-husband, former Molex co-Chairman John H. Krehbiel Jr., bought the property in 1988 for nearly $2 million, when it totaled less than 5 acres.\nIn the 1990s, they expanded the grounds by acquiring adjacent parcels and added a substantial expansion in 1996 designed by architect Thomas Beeby, along with a pool house and guesthouse. Today, the gardens feature 21 distinct outdoor \u201crooms,\u201d bent grass lawns, hedges, manicured trees and seasonal beds.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Portland achieved something San Francisco has spent years promising and failing to do: It delivered a significant amount of\n\u201cmissing middle\u201d housing\n.\nPortland\npermitted about 2,200 townhomes, duplexes and similar small-scale multifamily units from 2021 through 2024, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. San Francisco approved roughly one-sixth as many in that time, despite comparable scarcity of these types of homes and increasing housing prices\npush\ning out residents.\nIn Portland, this missing middle housing has created a tier of for-sale product priced hundreds of thousands of dollars below the market rate for detached single-family houses.\nIn San Francisco, starter homes and condos surge further and further out of reach, weighed down by high land costs, ballooning homeowners\u2019 association fees and a permitting process that can drag on for years.\nBoth cities pursued similar zoning reforms meant to break the single-family mold. Oregon\neffectively ended single-family zoning in 2019, and Portland implemented it in 2021 as the Residential Infill Project. That law, like California\u2019s\nSenate Bill 9\n, passed in 2021,\nallows owners to split lots\nand build duplexes on single-family parcels. Portland\nexpanded\nthe law in 2022 to allow for even more housing types.\nUnlike the Oregon law, California requires anyone dividing a lot to live there for at least three years. These owner-occupancy requirements scared off developers in San Francisco and proved too complex for most homeowners, the outlet said.\nSan Francisco added more hurdles, including a holding period before approvals, which invites appeals and neighborhood pushback. Even projects theoretically eligible for streamlined review can get snagged by the city\u2019s dense web of building codes, fees and design requirements.\nCity leaders in Portland, meanwhile, resisted homeowner pressure to water down the rules and instead leaned into density, tying allowable building size to the number of units produced.\nSmaller units led to lower prices, and by-right approvals guaranteed speed and certainty that the projects will actually get built.\nPortland also simplified its code and temporarily suspended some fees, making construction more feasible for builders. The result has been a surge in townhomes and cottage clusters in Portland. Developers can now move from permit to sale in a matter of months, according to the outlet.\n\u201cIn Portland, we\u2019re just trying not to become San Francisco,\u201d Tina Kotek, then-speaker for the Oregon House of Representatives,\ntold\nthe Los Angeles Times in 2019. Kotek was elected governor of Oregon in 2022.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

A double-wide townhouse in Greenwich Village claimed that title last year when it sold for\n$73 million\n.\nThe deal also comes as wealthy buyers have pushed condo prices to new heights downtown.\nEarlier this year, financier Harsh Padia and his wife, interior designer Purvi Padia, set a new threshold for the priciest condo deal below 14th Street when they sold their apartment at 150 Charles Street for\n$60 million\n. About six months later, a penthouse at Aurora Capital Associates\u2019 140 Jane Street entered contract with an\n$88 million\nasking price.\nIt was not immediately clear which units at the two-tower development were part of the deal.\nThe most expensive individual unit listed so far at the project is a\n7,000-square-foot duplex penthouse asking $80 million\nin the building\u2019s west tower, according to an offering plan filed with the New York Attorney General\u2019s office. Unit 30, the development\u2019s largest, is also asking $75 million.\nThe project is expected to have a projected sellout well over $2 billion.\nNews of the inked deal is the first to land in headlines since the West Village tower quietly launched sales earlier this year. The developers last year tapped Dan Tubb and Amy Williamson to\nhead sales\nat the building, though the duo has kept information about its progress under wraps.\nThe\nfew details to emerge\nabout sales at the development have come from brokers\u2019 Instagram posts, including one posted by Bespoke last month claiming the brokerage brought a buyer for Unit 24A asking $31 million.\nTubb and Williamson did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for the developer declined to comment.\nMichael Balanevsky, a broker at Accent Holdings, brought the buyer, according to sources familiar with the deal. Balanevsky declined to comment.\nBalanevsky works in both New York City and the Hamptons, and has established a \u201cstrong Russian clientele,\u201d according to his website.\nKatherine Kallergis contributed reporting.\n",

Daniel Straus is the founder of CareOne and president of The Straus Group. The buyer was\nGrant S. Johnson\n. The co-op spans about 3,800 square feet and has four bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms. The Strauses purchased the unit in 2009 for $5.4 million. It went on the market in July for just under $13 million. The Modlin Group\u2019s\nAdam Modlin\nand\nAndrew Nierenberg\nrepresented the Strauses.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe top recorded commercial transaction was in the West Village, as the sale of the \u201cFriends\u201d building at\n90 Bedford Street\nfor about $33 million hit records. The seller was\nJeff Sutton\u2019s\nWharton Properties\n, which acquired the building in January 2024 for $18.3 million and renovated it.\nThe buyers were\nJP Real Estate Group Limited\nand\nJP Real Estate Group USA\n. Wharton acquired the property in January 2024 for $18.3 million. The building spans about 15,600 square feet, has 22 apartments and stands six stories tall. It also has a restaurant called Little Owl on the ground floor. The deal was brokered by\nMichael Sherman\nof Baseline Real Estate Investors.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nA penthouse at\n90 Riverside Drive\non the Upper West Side changed hands for just under $11 million. The seller was\nSusan Winberg\n, a lawyer turned designer, and the buyer was\nJoshua Wachs\n. Winberg had owned the co-op since 2011, when she purchased it for $5.9 million. The three-bedroom pad was gut-renovated and has a private elevator landing, an office and a wraparound terrace. Winberg put the residence up for sale in March for nearly $15 million. Cocoran\u2019s\nSteve Gold\nhad the listing.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nFor $5.5 million,\nKaren Miner-Romanoff\n, a criminology professor at New York University and researcher, sold a penthouse and a storage unit at\n130 Williams Street\nin the Financial District.

The three-bedroom condo spans about 2,500 square feet, pricing the deal at roughly $2,200 per square foot. Nest Seekers International\u2019s\nTamir Shemesh\nand\nLivia Stival\nrepresented the seller. The unit first hit the market a year ago, when its asking price was just under $7 million.\nBy the Numbers:\nNew York leads markets with discounted house listings\nAmong the nation\u2019s largest housing markets, no city saw more sellers blink on price last November than New York.\nIn the New York metro area, 3.6 percent of home listings were marked down during the month, the highest share among the 25 most populous U.S. markets, according to data from\nZillow\n.\nNationwide, 2.72 percent of homes had their\nprices discounted\nin November, essentially flat compared to both the month and year before.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "Deputy Mayor Adolfo Carri\u00f3n plans to get back into real estate.\nCarri\u00f3n, who has\nserved\nas deputy mayor of housing, economic development and workforce since March, says he will revive his development and consulting firm, Metro Futures, after he leaves office.\n\u201cIt\u2019s dormant right now. As of January 2, I\u2019m going to say it will no longer be dormant,\u201d he said in an interview on Wednesday.\n\u201cI will be involved in investing in New York City, building affordable housing with clients and friends of mine and trying to ensure that this continues to be the best city in the world,\u201d he said.\n(His work with the city, of course, will be limited for a while; deputy mayors are barred from communicating with city agencies for two years after leaving office.)\nCarri\u00f3n has worked for city and federal housing agencies, as well as private real estate firms. Before becoming deputy mayor, he was head of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. He launched Metro Futures in 2012, after serving as Bronx borough president and then working for the Obama administration in the Office of Urban Affairs and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He\u2019s also worked for the Stagg Group and CSA Group.\nAs Carri\u00f3n is winding down his time at City Hall, Mamdani is gradually filling out his team. I\u2019ve heard rumblings of a few people who are in the running for Carri\u00f3n\u2019s role, but we\u2019re still waiting for an announcement.\nThe final days of the Adams administration may prove consequential for Mamdani (in more ways than new appointees to the Rent Guidelines Board, which I heard is coming before the end of the week).\nOn Thursday, the City Council is expected to vote on three bills that set new rules for the kinds of housing the city finances, setting minimum thresholds for the percentage of housing units dedicated to very-low and extremely-low income tenants, as well as for the amount of units with two- and three-bedrooms and those designated as homeownership units. Another measure would set minimum construction wages for some city-funded housing projects.\nMamdani hasn\u2019t taken a position on the bills, but housing groups have warned that the measures could hurt the new mayor\u2019s housing goals and dramatically raise HPD\u2019s budget needs.\nCarri\u00f3n said he is concerned about the bills and said, if approved, they would make it \u201cnearly impossible to deliver on the promise of more affordable housing.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t control every action of an industry and then expect that industry to deliver success for you and your city.\u201d\nHe added that he is \u201chere to help\u201d the next administration.\n\u201cMayor Mamdani\u2019s success is New York City\u2019s success,\u201d he said.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWho do you think will be the next deputy mayor of housing?\nSend a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: As of Wednesday evening, the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act, or COPA, was not on the Committee on Housing and Buildings\u2019 agenda. A source familiar with discussions told me that the bill will likely come up for a vote Thursday, but the agenda had not been finalized.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani says he believes he will be the city\u2019s 112th mayor, instead of 111th,\nGothamist reports\n. The city\u2019s Department of Records recently confirmed an historian\u2019s findings (and Gothamist\u2019s reporting) that the official count of mayors failed to account for Mayor Matthias Nicolls\u2019 nonconsecutive second term.\n\u2014 Ugh, it\u2019s not in your head: Everyone around you is sick. New York City and surrounding areas have seen some of the highest levels of flu-like illnesses in the U.S. since Dec. 6,\nthe New York Times reports\n.\n\u2014 Mamdani on Wednesday tapped Jahmila Edwards, former associate director for District Council 37, as his director of intergovernmental affairs. He also announced Catherine Almonte Da Costa, head of culture at communications firm Orchestra, will serve as director of appointments.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$12.3 million\nfor a co-op unit at 888 Park Avenue. The Upper East Side co-op is 3,800 square feet and sold for more than double its last sale in 2009 of $5.4 million.\nThe Modlin Group\nhas the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$32.7 million\nfor 90 Bedford Street. The West Village rental is six stories, 15,600-square-feet and has 22 units.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $7.6 million for a condominium unit at 20 West 53rd Street. The Midtown Central condo at the Baccarat Hotel &amp; Residences is 2,500 square feet.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\nhas the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 71,555-square-foot, 13-story mixed-use residential and commercial building at 80 West Broadway in Tribeca. Richard Cook of Cookfox Architects is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "When you\u2019re facing\n28 foreclosure cases,\nwhat\u2019s a couple more?\nInfamous Manhattan landlord Steve Croman has been hit with new foreclosure cases connected to 11 properties. Loan principals for those new cases total more than $55 million, bringing Croman\u2019s total defaulted principal tally up to $306 million. The most recent case was recorded Dec. 12.\nThe wave of defaults is almost entirely the work of one lender, an entity of Bellwether Asset Management, which\nbought a portfolio of Croman\u2019s loans\nin November. In some cases, the lender is pursuing personal judgments against Croman and his family, which could spell trouble for the landlord, who spent time in prison for fraud.\n\u201cThey are aggressive, they buy with the intent to default,\u201d Croman said in a text message to\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cWe are paying them off.\u201d\nThe new foreclosure cases were brought by Bellwether entity Orange Owner LLC. Most of the 11 loans are cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted. The lender has accused the Croman-connected borrowers of stopping payments, misappropriating rents and falling behind on water and insurance payments.\nIn some cases, the lender argues those behaviors justify a judgment on Croman personally, not just the borrowing entities he\u2019s connected to. Croman, like many building owners, signed guaranty agreements that committed him to covering losses in the case of certain bad acts like fraud or abandonment. Kelly Schneid of Moritt Hock &amp; Hamroff, representing Orange Owner LLC in the suits, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe total tally of foreclosure cases faced by Croman now totals 32, with nearly all brought by Orange Owner LLC. The properties in the cases span much of Manhattan, including the Upper East Side, Upper West Side, Chinatown, the West Village, the Lower East Side and Alphabet City.\nOne of the homes, at 7 East 75th Street, was used as the primary exterior shot in the 1990s sitcom \u201cThe Nanny.\u201d It served as the Sheffield family\u2019s mansion, the workplace of protagonist Fran Fine, played by Fran Drescher. An entity connected to Croman bought the 6-story building off Fifth Avenue for $14.5 million in 2008. The New York Post first reported the connection.\nThe lender alleges the borrower stopped making payments on the loan in August.\nIn November, the lender\npurchased 38 Croman-connected loans\n, with principals totaling $247 million, from Flagstar Bank, whose predecessor, New York Community Bank, originated the notes. Centennial Bank helped finance the loan purchase for Bellwether. Many of the properties in the portfolio include rent-stabilized units.\nSeven of the foreclosure cases were brought by other lenders. Those total $42.4 million in principal.\nCroman gained notoriety for widespread allegations of tenant harassment, landing him the designation of one of the city\u2019s worst landlords. After the state brought a civil case and criminal charges against him, Croman eventually paid $8 million to a tenant restitution fund and spent eight months in prison for mortgage and tax fraud.\nElsewhere, Croman has sued another lender, this one an entity of Dalan Capital, to stop an\nauction of his personal home\non the Upper East Side. A judge has postponed that sale as the case plays out.\n",

The price amounts to more than $2.5 million per acre.\nAventura-based Kadima, led by co-founders Alejandro Chaberman and Joseph Melul, partially financed the acquisition with a $17.6 million loan from RMWC. Kadima immediately flipped three of the 12 acres for $12 million to an affiliate of Persea Ventures, a Miami-based, technology-focused venture capital firm led by Mateo Pugliese-Bassi, per records and Vizzda.\nKadima will develop the entire 12 acres into a master-planned community with apartments,\u00a0 condos, retail, entertainment and warehouses, a spokesperson said. The firm will act as project manager for the 3 acres sold to the Persea entity.\nThe firm is planning two other projects in Hallandale Beach.\nKadima started construction in October on\nSeven Park\n, a $70 million mixed-use development at 218-220 Southeast Seventh Street that will have 121 condo units and 4,500 square feet of ground floor retail. The developer tapped Fortune Development Sales to lead sales and marketing, with condo prices starting at $375,000.\nKadima paid $5.3 million for the 1.1-acre site last year. The firm is also developing Blue Park, a $40 million, eight-story, 185-unit multifamily building in Hallandale Beach.\nSoffer acquired the nearly 28-acre former parimutuel property, previously known as Mardi Gras Casino and Race Track, for\n$12.5 million\nin 2018. His firm Fontainebleau Development owns the\nFontainebleau Miami Beach\n, a historic 1,504-room oceanfront hotel that is mired in a recent controversy.\nLast month, dozens of activists, preservationists and residents voiced opposition of a planned waterpark at the Miami Beach property that includes a mid-rise podium connected to a network of waterslides, a kids play pool, new bathrooms and new cabanas.",

        "content": "Billionaire businessman Jorge Mas is on a roll. After selling a waterfront property in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove for over $100 million, the MasTec chairman sold his mansion in Coral Gables for $32 million.\nA trust owned by Mas and his wife sold the 13,500-square-foot home at 6312 Riviera Drive to a land trust managed by attorney Richard Barbara, who is in-house counsel at the Barreto Group and CFO of Coral Gables Title + Escrow.\nThe waterfront two-story home has six bedrooms and six bathrooms and sits on a 1.6-acre lot fronting the Coral Gables Waterway. Mas\u2019 ownership of the property was previously hidden from the public. His trust paid\n$19.4 million\nfor the property in 2021, records show.\u00a0 (Before that, it sold\nfor $14.9 million\nin 2020.)\nMas often hides his ownership of residential properties. He recently sold the\n7.3-acre residential lot\noff of Douglas Road in the Grove to a hidden buyer, sources told\nThe Real Deal\nearlier this month. The off-market trade has not yet been recorded with Miami-Dade County, and the buyer is unknown. Sources said Mas purchased the waterfront lot this year and flipped it. His purchase was not recorded, and it suggests that he acquired the LLC that owned the lot.\nLuxury residential sales are up in Coral Gables. Last week, Royal Caribbean Group\u2019s former chairman and CEO Richard Fain signed a contract to sell his waterfront estate, asking\n$37 million\n, in Gables Estates.\nMas co-founded MasTec, a construction and engineering giant, and is also managing owner of\nInter Miami CF\n, the Major League Soccer team part-owned by David Beckham. Inter Miami is building a $1 billion mixed-use stadium development near Miami International Airport. Construction is underway.\nEarlier this year, the partnership, which includes\nAres Management\n, secured a $450 million loan from JPMorgan Chase for the project.\n",

        "content": "As municipalities across Greater Los Angeles work to meet their housing goals, the\nInland Empire\nis in a notably healthier position for growth.\nWhile Los Angeles, Ventura and Orange counties deal with undersupplied multifamily rental markets, the I.E. is thriving by comparison, L.A. Business First\nreported\n, citing real estate experts at this month\u2019s\nCasden Multifamily Forecast\nand Conference held by the University of Southern California Lusk Center for Real Estate.\nOver the next two years, multifamily rents and vacancies are expected to rise across the region. Average rents in the I.E. are expected to climb 4.6 percent in that same period. Still, they will remain the most affordable market in the region, according to Moussa Diop, an associate professor of real estate at the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy.\nThis year, monthly rents in the Inland Empire averaged $2,112, approximately 10 percent lower than Los Angeles County\u2019s average and 25 percent below Orange County\u2019s. The I.E., consisting of Riverside and San Bernardino counties, has seen about 3.6 percent annual growth in rent over the past five years. Vacancy in the I.E. is the highest in the region at 6.4 percent, though it\u2019s predicted to fall in the coming quarters as demand gobbles up the\nhousing supply\n.\n\u201cThe current very high vacancy is not really something that\u2019s negative in any way,\u201d Diop said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you expect with supply in a responsive market. You need to allow time for the additional supply to be absorbed, and then new development will take place.\u201d\nLos Angeles County\u2019s rental market is \u201cchronically undersupplied,\u201d according to Diop, as years of floundering construction leaves vacancy hovering around 5 percent despite a recent increase in new construction. Average rent in L.A. County rose 0.5 percent to $2,336 per month as rental inventory across the county grew by 1 percent. As of October, the vacancy rate was approximately 5.4 percent. By October 2027, vacancy is expected to fall slightly to 5.2 percent with rents averaging $2,350 a month. Rents will only grow by 0.6 percent over the next two years.\nFinancing for new projects remains the largest hurdle for many developers in Southern California to overcome. Diop credited increasing federal debt,\nelevated interest rates\nand a stock market bubble fueled by artificial intelligence investment as key obstacles to getting shovels in dirt. These issues plague cities across the country.\n\u201cTo cover the shortfall nationally, we will need to increase supply by close to 25 percent to 30 percent annually. It\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Diop said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how to build housing that fast. We need to understand that this is all about regulations. We have regulated our cities and ourselves into this crisis, and the only way to solve this is by changing those regulations.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The NFL\u2019s Chicago Bears are now running the triple option in their drive to score taxpayer financing for a new stadium.\nThe football team is reviving a familiar threat: leave Illinois if taxpayers won\u2019t help pay for a\nnew stadium\n. This time, the team is dangling northwest Indiana as a potential landing spot, openly pitting state and local governments against each other in a bid to extract its ideal public funding package.\nIn an\ninterview\nwith the Chicago Tribune, Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren confirmed the team is looking across state lines as frustration grows over stalled legislation tied to a proposed stadium at\nArlington Park in Arlington Heights\n, a northwest suburb of Chicago. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at opportunities that may exist in the Chicagoland area including northwest Indiana,\u201d Warren said, while stressing that \u201cArlington Park is the most viable location in Cook County.\u201d\nIndiana lawmakers have already laid groundwork. Earlier this year, the state created the Northwest Indiana Professional Sports Development Commission to lure a major franchise.\nHammond Mayor Thomas McDermott Jr. didn\u2019t hide his enthusiasm: \u201cI would bend over backwards to do anything I can to help the Bears come here,\u201d he told the newspaper, even suggesting the city would \u201cknock down buildings\u201d to make room for an NFL stadium.\nIllinois officials weren\u2019t amused. Gov. JB Pritzker\u2019s office called the Indiana consideration \u201ca startling slap in the face\u201d of fans who have supported the team through a so-far successful season. The governor\u2019s spokesperson Matt Hill added that while the Bears are a private business, \u201cthe bottom line for any private business development should not come at the full expense of taxpayers.\u201d\nThe team\u2019s original plan for an enclosed stadium at Arlington Heights involved a $2 billion-plus private commitment. This was followed by a brief pivot, with officials proposing a $4.7 billion new domed stadium on the lakefront to replace its current home venue, Soldier Field. After state leaders took a pass on funding for the lakefront proposal, Warren confirmed the team\u2019s primary focus had returned to the Arlington Heights site.\nAt the heart of the standoff is\nlegislation\nthe Bears want to revive that would allow \u201cmegaprojects\u201d to negotiate long-term property tax payments directly with local taxing bodies. Chicago-area lawmakers have balked, particularly as the team eyes a suburban move and continues to pay just $7 million a year in rent for\nSoldier Field\n, which still carries more than $500 million in publicly financed renovation debt.\nThe Bears insist the legislation would cost the state nothing, but Pritzker has made clear the team \u2014 valued at nearly $9 billion \u2014 should fund its own stadium, with the state potentially helping on infrastructure. Arlington Heights alone would require an estimated\n$855 million\nin road and utility work, should it get the team.\nFrom a negotiating standpoint, the Indiana gambit is textbook. NFL teams have long used relocation threats to juice public subsidies, and Warren denied it\u2019s a ploy. Still, the risks are real. A move out of Illinois could dent local political goodwill, alienate fans and complicate media narratives \u2014 even if the team argues that northwest Indiana remains part of its \u201chome marketing area\u201d for TV and radio rights.\nPolls already show Chicago-area residents want the Bears to stay inside Cook County, just not on their dime. Crossing state lines might unlock more taxpayer cash, but it could come at the cost of civic loyalty and long-term brand equity \u2014 a tradeoff that doesn\u2019t show up neatly in a stadium financing spreadsheet.\n\u2014 Sam Lounsberry\n",

That tally trails only 2022, when nine homes crossed the $10 million mark \u2014 and 2025 could still match it, with a $12.5 million\nMichigan Avenue condo\nowned by Ken Griffin recently going under contract.\nThe sale caps a record year for high-end housing across the metro. It was the region\u2019s 153rd home sale at $4 million or more, blowing past the previous record of 136 set in 2022. Before 2020, the average annual count at that price tier was just 52, showing how dramatically the top end of the market has reset with an increase in volume.\nThe deal is especially notable for\nLake Bluff\n. It\u2019s the village\u2019s highest home sale since 2007, when the 21-acre Lansdowne estate sold to a developer that later subdivided it. In recent years, Lake Bluff\u2019s top sale was $7.65 million, paid in 2022 for a newly built home on the former Lansdowne grounds.\nThe sellers, James and Lisa Zenni, first listed the roughly 10,000-square-foot mansion on 13 acres\nin 2018\nfor $19.5 million. In 2023, they expanded the\noffering\nto roughly 30 acres and raised the asking price to $22.9 million. The final sale, for $11.25 million, came with about 26 acres, according to the listing, at less than half the peak asking price.\nBuilt in 1994, the Italian villa\u2013style home sits on 690 feet of Lake Michigan frontage and includes a vineyard, stable, tennis court and swimming pool. The mansion occupies land once part of the historic Crab Tree Farm, a 370-acre dairy operation dating back to 1906.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "One of Texas\u2019 priciest homes found a buyer, landing a $30.5 million sale in one of Dallas\u2019 most exclusive neighborhoods.\nThe nearly 13,000-square-foot mansion at 6601 Hunters Glen Road in Volk Estates sold after less than two months on the market, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. Alex Perry of Allie Beth Allman &amp; Associates handled the listing. The estate had been listed at $35 million, and traded for about 13 percent less than its asking price. That asking price had briefly earned it the title of the\nmost expensive home\npublicly marketed in Texas.\nThe three-story mansion hit the market on Oct. 31 and quickly became one of Dallas\u2019 highest-profile luxury listings. The property penciled out to roughly $2,346 per square foot, placing it among the most expensive homes ever listed in the city. Even at the final sale price, the deal ranks near the top of recent Park Cities trades.\nBuilt in 1927, the mansion sits on nearly 2 acres \u2014 a rare spread even in\nVolk Estates\n, an enclave known for estate-sized lots and old guard wealth. The home includes five bedrooms, six full bathrooms and three half-bathrooms, with recent updates led by Dallas-based Sebastian Construction Group. The renovation was geared to modernize the interiors, while preserving the home\u2019s historic architecture.\nThe grounds aim to mimic a private resort. Amenities include layered gardens and courtyards, a resurfaced and retiled pool, a full tennis court, a putting green and multiple reworked patios anchored by a two-story cabana. A private gym was also completely overhauled, bringing the compound in line with current ultra-luxury expectations.\nThe property was previously owned by a trust headed by\nJoshua Pack\n, co-CEO of Dallas-based Fortress Investment Group, who died in September at age 51. The buyer was a local family, Perry said, declining to identify them.\nVolk Estates properties\nrarely trade\n, and when they do, they tend to set benchmarks for the region\u2019s luxury market. Dallas Central Appraisal District records show annual property taxes for the mansion are north of $252,000.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Every landlord has a dead tenant story.\n\u201cRemember the lady in 4C with the handwritten notes on the lease?\u201d one recently asked his attorney, Noah Levenson. \u201cAwful smell coming from her apartment. We think she\u2019s dead and decomposing. What do we do?\u201d\nLevenson gave his standard answer:\n\u201cDon\u2019t go in. Call 911. Tell them you think there\u2019s a corpse.\u201d\nWhen someone dies in a home, the police stay with the body until an authorized entity removes it. Usually it\u2019s a funeral home called by the family. But for a tenant without any relatives to step up, the Office of Medical Examiner does the deed.\nFor the landlord, that\u2019s the easy part. The hard part is getting the apartment back.\nLiving tenants are notoriously hard to evict in New York City. But tenants who don\u2019t have any family can cling to their apartments long after they are dead.\nIn a city with a\nhousing emergency\nand many rent-stabilized buildings in financial crisis, this stinks \u2014 figuratively and literally. The unit can easily sit empty for a year or more, providing no affordable housing and generating no rent.\nAnd because it remains sealed for months, the stench of death lingers. No one can go in even to open a window, let alone\nburn coffee grounds\nor disinfect the place. Neighbors have to live with the odor.\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically like a crime scene,\u201d Levenson said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019re protecting the estate. They don\u2019t want the landlord rummaging through their property.\u201d\nThe government doesn\u2019t know if there are stacks of cash under the mattress for an heir or nothing but junk. But it should at least be possible to flip on an exhaust fan, spray some Lysol and dispose of rotting food.\nInstead, the police tape remains across the door.\n\u201cThen the real work starts,\u201d Levenson\nexplained\non LinkedIn. \u201cYou chase every emergency contact. Every cousin. Every \u2018niece.\u2019 Every number ever scribbled in the file.\u201d\nFor a tenant with no assets, getting a relative to take on this burden is a long shot. So the landlord has to do it. That means hiring a lawyer to go to Surrogate\u2019s Court, create an estate for the dead person and get a\npublic administrator\nappointed to represent it.\nLevenson has a Bronx case that went nowhere for more than a year while everyone waited for the court to bring in the public administrator.\nThat office then had an investigator go through the apartment. No last will and testament or anything of value was found, and it was determined that the tenant lived alone.\nThe public administrator looked for a next of kin and filed letters with the court documenting the search. This took months, as it always does.\nThat\u2019s when the owner gets the unit back, right? Not necessarily.\nIn a case like this in Manhattan, Levenson recalled, the administrator did hand over the keys at that point. But in the Bronx, the administrator refused. Levenson had to file an eviction case against a ghost.\nNo one opposed the eviction, obviously, but it still took the owner forever to get the unit back.\n\u201cEventually you get an eviction in housing court,\u201d Levenson said. \u201cIn the Bronx, you\u2019re looking at a warrant backlog of months and months.\u201d\nUncontested cases don\u2019t get priority in housing court. It\u2019s first-come, first-served.\nThe lawyer serves a 14-day notice and waits 10 days for the other party to answer. Then he applies for a warrant, which Levenson said \u201csits in warrant court purgatory\u201d for a while. Ultimately the city marshall schedules a visit to unseal the apartment.\n\u201cMy biggest frustration isn\u2019t even with the housing court,\u201d the attorney said. \u201cIt\u2019s with the public administrator. It just adds to my frustration of\nvacant apartments\nthat\ncannot be put on the market\n.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the unclaimed body sits in cold storage for a year before being shipped to Hart Island for burial at the\npotter\u2019s field\n.\n\u201cOnly in this city can a tenant pass away, go to the morgue, sit on ice for a year and still delay giving the landlord possession back,\u201d Levenson said.\n",

The average buyer is getting a considerable discount, and compared to earlier months of the year, supply has never been higher.\nAbout 1,900 residential deals closed last month, a 16 percent decline compared to last November. That marks the lowest total since February and the steepest year-over-year decline of 2025.\nVolume suffered similarly. Sales dollar volume dropped below $1.1 billion in November, declining by 14.5 percent, year-over-year. That\u2019s likewise the lowest total since February and the largest year-over-year drop so far this year.\nAll the while,\nsupply is piling up\n. The Austin area amassed 6.3 months of inventory in November, a month and a half more than November of last year and the highest level so far in 2025.\nSellers are also compromising more. The ratio of the average sale price to listing price declined to 91.7 percent in November, scraping close to the\nSeptember\ntrough of 91.6 percent.\nThe trend represents a drop-off compared to October, which already trailed last year in closings and dollar volume.\nPrices and sales have been faltering, and supply rising, throughout the Texas Triangle. Alongside Austin, Houston saw the greatest\ndecrease in median home prices\nin the country in September; Dallas and Houston led the nation in\ndiscounted home sales\nin August; and buyers and sellers\nfailed to close deals\nmore in San Antonio than in any other major metro in the country this summer.\nHowever, Austin had farther to fall after its\nIcarian rise\nduring the pandemic.\nAustin suffered the greatest loss in average home value in November nationwide\n, according to Zillow.

        "content": "South Florida\u2019s largest industrial sales of 2025 were dominated by single-tenant logistics campuses and multi-property portfolios, with institutional investors trading heavily in Miami-Dade and Broward even as deal volume slipped from 2024\u2019s frenzied pace.\nThe top ten industrial deals combined for $822 million, compared to $1.1 billion last year, according to analysis by\nThe Real Deal\nof Cushman &amp; Wakefield and Colliers reports.\nBlackstone was the most active seller, unloading more than half of the top 10 assets, while buyers such as Terreno, Ares and TA Realty targeted infill, last\u2011mile warehouses in Doral, Miramar, Opa-locka and Hialeah at pricing that generally held in the mid\u2011$200s to high\u2011$300s per square foot.\u200b\n1. $130.7M | Terreno Realty | Doral\nSan Francisco-based Terreno Realty, led by W. Blake Baird, paid $130.7 million for the Royal Palm Doral industrial portfolio at 6450 and 6550 Northwest 97th Avenue in Doral, making it the priciest warehouse trade in South Florida this year. The two-building complex spans roughly 346,000 square feet and traded for about $378 per square foot. Blackstone sold the fully leased asset to Terreno in August.\n2. $120.5M | Ares Management | Dania Beach and Miramar\nAres Management, led by Michael Arougheti, picked up a three-building portfolio in Miramar and Dania Beach from Blackstone and Link Logistics for $120.5 million in April. The properties, spanning 457,000 square feet, sold for about $263 per square foot and gave Ares additional scale in west Broward\u2019s big-box logistics corridor near major highways. The transaction is part of Blackstone\u2019s broader South Florida industrial sell-off, which has topped the billion-dollar mark over the last two years.\u200b\n3. $105.7M | TA Realty | Opa-Locka\nIn another deal involving Blackstone as the seller, Boston-based TA Realty paid $105.7 million for Phase II of Ironwood Commerce Center, a development site at 12691\u201312705 Northwest 42nd Avenue in Opa-locka. The trade slots in as the third-largest industrial deal of 2025 and reflects investor demand for newly built product near Opa-locka Executive Airport. Industry sources said TA Realty, led by Jim Buckingham, is betting on continued rent growth in Northwest Miami-Dade\u2019s tight logistics submarket.\u200b Last year, Blackstone and Link Logistics also sold an adjacent industrial park to TA Realty for $160 million.\n4. $90.2M | East Capital Partners | Northwest Miami Dade\nBlackstone was the seller in the fourth-biggest industrial sale of 2025. Darien, Connecticut-based East Capital Partners, led by David Archibald and Drew DeWitt, acquired Airport Trade Center at 3108\u20133308 Northwest 72nd Avenue for $90.2 million. The deal breaks down to roughly $241 a square foot for the 375,000-square-foot industrial complex, giving East Capital a large footprint near Miami International Airport at a time when infill sites are scarce. The firm financed the acquisition with a mix of equity and debt and is expected to pursue incremental upgrades as it leases up the property.\n5. $82.3M | Longpoint | Doral\nBoston-based Longpoint Realty Partners, led by Dwight Angelini, picked up America\u2019s Gateway Park, a six-building industrial portfolio in Doral, for $82.3 million in late July. Terreno Realty sold the properties, clustered around Northwest 20th Street and Northwest 89th Place. Longpoint is among the most active institutional investors wheeling and dealing in South Florida industrial properties. The firm notched the largest industrial purchase of 2024 with its $331.2 million South Florida portfolio acquisition from Blackstone.\n6. $69.9M | MIG Real Estate | Davie, Fort Lauderdale and Sunrise\nLongpoint was also involved in the tri-county region\u2019s sixth-largest deal as the seller. MIG Real Estate bought a 10-property industrial portfolio in Davie, Fort Lauderdale and Sunrise from Longpoint for about $69.9 million. The portfolio is a mix of mid-bay and light-industrial buildings spread across central Broward. The deal underscores how investors are still aggregating critical mass in Broward\u2019s older industrial complexes as development sites grow scarce.\u200b\n7. $58.9M | Property Reserve | Hialeah\nThe seventh biggest industrial transaction of 2025 involved Coral Gables Codina Partners striking another warehouse deal with Property Reserve, the real estate arm of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In March, Property Reserve paid $58.9 million for a 226,698-square-foot warehouse at\nBeacon Logistics Park in Hialeah\n. The trade, at about $260 per square foot, extends the church\u2019s industrial holdings in the master-planned complex, following its 2024 purchase of another building at the same complex also sold by Codina. The building is part of a larger complex planned to exceed 1 million square feet once fully built out.\n8. $56M | Ares Management | Weston\nIn Weston, Ares Management paid $56 million for Meridian at Weston, a 231,000-square-foot industrial property at 3425 Meridian Parkway, buying it from Cabot Properties. The late-year sale adds another South Florida warehouse to Ares\u2019 expanding regional portfolio. The property sits within the Weston Park of Commerce and has historically attracted distribution and cold-storage users, according to brokerage data.\u200b\n9. $55.3M | EQT Exeter | Deerfield Beach\nEQT Exeter dropped $55.35 million on a Broward County industrial portfolio previously owned by an affiliate of Miami-based Elion Partners. The buildings, including properties along Northwest 31st Avenue in Deerfield Beach, span 221,000 square feet and sold for about $250 per square foot. The acquisition gives EQT Exeter additional coverage in North Broward\u2019s logistics corridor, where vacancy is among the lowest in the region.\u200b\n10. $52.9M | Martinez Distributors | Hialeah\nRounding out the top ten is Miami-based Martinez Distributors\u2019 $52.9 million acquisition of Countyline East Logistics Center at 16300 Northwest 97th Avenue in Hialeah. In August East Capital Partner sold the 171,200-square-foot building for about $309 per square foot to Martinez. The trade highlights a recurring theme in this year\u2019s rankings: local companies stepping up to buy high-quality distribution space for their own operations, even at institutional pricing.",

It bought a whole office campus. That office campus used to belong to Gerald Haddock\u2019s Silver Star Properties.\nIn the first quarter, H-E-B purchased Commerce Plaza Hillcrest, a three-building office property at 12800-12890 Hillcrest Road, according to a report from Cushman &amp; Wakefield. The 204,650-square-foot Commerce Plaza Hillcrest was built in 1972 and sits on nearly 10 acres. It was valued at $16.8 million in 2025.\nThe deal marks one of the region\u2019s top office purchases of the year, but the purchase was the easy part for H-E-B, led by Chairman Charles Butt. The zoning fight was the challenge. Homeowner groups rallied against the project, calling the store \u201c\nout of character\n\u201d with the area. H-E-B prevailed, and the store is expected to open in 2028.\nThe transaction is a win for the Houston-based real estate investment trust, Silver Star Properties, which has been offloading its portfolio of Class B office properties as it attempts to\nright the ship\namid a bitter proxy war with ex-CEO Allen Hartman.\nSilver Star defaulted on a $259 million CMBS loan from Goldman Sachs in October 2023. Hartman was ousted the same year following accusations of nepotism and mismanagement. He denies the allegations.\nHaddock spearheaded an effort to sell off Silver Star\u2019s 35-property portfolio of low to mid-tier office properties and pivot to self-storage. It\u2019s not been easy. A Silver Star subsidiary filed for bankruptcy in 2023. In August, the firm faced\nforeclosure on three office properties\nin Houston, Dallas and San Antonio backing a $57.8 million loan from Benefit Street Partners.\nH-E-B has been on a different mission this year. It spent the year colonizing Dallas-Fort Worth\u2019s northern fringe, buying land for stores in cities like\nSherman\n, where it picked up 20 acres at the northwest corner of FM 1417 and U.S. Route 75 in June.\n",

        "content": "Helm Equities\u2019\nLive Local Act\nproject in the Miami Design District scored approval, despite some city review board members expressing unease with the tower\u2019s design.\nOn Wednesday, the Miami Urban Development Review Board passed\nHelm\u2019s proposal\nwith some recommended design tweaks.\nIt also approved Namdar Group\u2019s 1,011-unit multifamily tower in Brickell, with some discussion over the neighborhood\u2019s increasing traffic congestion.\nThe board also approved Crescent Heights\u2019 second phase to its Forma apartment tower in Edgewater, with most on the committee speaking positively about the project.\nNew York-based Helm, an affiliate of JEMB Realty, garnered the most debate among board members. Designed by Cube 3, the project will consist of a 36-story tower with 278 residential units and an adjacent eight-story building with over 101,000 square feet of offices and some retail on a nearly 2-acre site at 220 Northeast 43rd Street.\nOut of the 278 units, about 116 will be apartments for rent at workforce rates, and the rest will be condos for sale at market rates. That aligns with Florida\u2019s Live Local Act, which requires at least 40 percent of units be reserved for households earning no more than 120 percent of the area median income. The balance of residences can be either market-rate apartments or condos.\nIn exchange, Live Local Act project developers can build bigger projects than allowed on a site\u2019s zoning or receive\nbig tax breaks\n.\nBoard member Gia Zapattini said the design looks complicated.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on in this project. There\u2019s curves and arches. I understand you are trying to do something unique for the Design District and trying to do something cool,\u201d she told the architect during the meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated little project.\u201d\nThe mix of workforce rentals and high-end condos in one building adds to the complexity, Zapattini said. She encouraged Helm and Cube 3 to simplify the project, arguing that it will be costly and difficult to develop a building as \u201cornamental\u201d as the one shown on renderings.\n\u201cThis is a very tricky project to build,\u201d she said.\nBut others gushed over the design. Board member Ignacio Permuy said the tower has \u201ca lot of things going on \u2026 that are very, very good,\u201d and board member Francisco Perez-Azua said the project is \u201ca bit eclectic\u201d and has \u201ca lot going on.\u201d\n\u201cBut I see the value in that and the interest of that. I think it\u2019s a nice project,\u201d Perez-Azua said.\nThe board voted in favor of Helm\u2019s project, with recommendations that the firm tweak the fa\u00e7ade in places to give it some variation and also tweak the renderings so they\u2019re more truthful to floor plans.\nNamdar Realty, a Great Neck, New York-based firm, plans a 42-story tower, also under the Live Local Act, at 250 and 296 Southwest Seventh Street. Designed by Behar Font &amp; Partners, the tower will include 405 apartments at workforce rents designated for households earning no more than 120 percent of the AMI.\nThe project yielded some discussion about Brickell\u2019s ever-worsening traffic and also about the tower\u2019s garage.\nCrescent Heights\u2019 Arquitectonica-designed project in\nEdgewater\nsailed past the board. Miami-based Crescent \u2013\u2013 led by Sonny Kahn, Russell Galbut and Bruce Menin \u2013\u2013 wants to build a 42-story, 360-unit multifamily building and an adjacent six-story commercial building with retail and office uses at 200 Northeast 30th Street. The site is immediately west of Crescent\u2019s 40-story, 588-unit\nForma\napartment tower, which the firm completed last year.\nThe tower was designed as a \u201csister project\u201d to Forma, the developer\u2019s attorney said.\n",

Ten units are left for sale, ranging from $6.5 million to a penthouse asking $22 million.\nCervera Real Estate is leading sales and marketing of the project.\nA CMC affiliate secured\n$239 million in financing\nfrom Bank OZK two years ago. The completion is a clincher in a 10-year legal\nbattle\nthat\u2019s still playing out in court.\nResident associations re-filed a lawsuit against the city of Miami in January, when the project was well under construction, claiming the development is illegal because the city improperly granted development permits without required land platting on the private island.\nThe developer demolished a residents\u2019 club with a hotel, restaurant, pool and tennis courts to build the condominium, and the lawsuit claimed homeowners were stripped of their use of the club, which they were required to join.\nSettlements related to that claim\nin 2020 helped the developer move forward.\nBesides that, the development pushes the number of residential units on Grove Isle to 589, exceeding the 575-unit cap established in a 1977 covenant signed by the island\u2019s original developers, the lawsuit claimed.\nLoss of unobstructed bay views and possible loss of property values for Grove Isle homeowners are at the heart of the backlash. David Winker, attorney for the homeowners,\ntold\nCoconut Grove Spotlight in February that the project lacks \u201csetbacks or other elements that would come along with platting.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s the only luxury condo building delivered in Coconut Grove this year, according to the release. The homes are attracting domestic buyers, including residents of nearby estate homes who are downsizing to low-maintenance properties, the release said.\nThe project\u2019s large floorplans and finishouts chosen under the eye of Colombo himself are among the selling points, the release said.\nColombo\u2019s condo development work started in the early 1990s with Bristol Tower and Santa Maria in Brickell. His firm is known for projects including Porto Vita, Grovenor House, Epic Hotel &amp; Residences and Brickell Flatiron.\nThe firm only develops two projects at a time, and the next one is the nearby\nFour Seasons Private Residences Coconut Grove\n, in partnership with Fort Partners.\n",

        "content": "A $10 million infusion from Penny Pritzker\u2019s foundation will help build 125 affordable homes in Chicago Lawn and kickstart more construction down the line.\nThe Pritzker Traubert Foundation awarded the $10 million Chicago Prize on Tuesday to Reclaiming Chicago, a coalition of nonprofit developers with the goal to build 2,000 affordable homes in the\nSouth\nand\nWest sides\n. The foundation is led by former U.S. Secretary of Commerce and Chicago real estate veteran\nPenny Pritzker\nand her husband, Bryan Traubert.\nThe grant money will fund the purchase of a 17-acre lot at 74th Street and Talman Avenue, and contribute to a $42 million revolving loan fund to finance the planned 125 affordable homes on that site along with future construction. The project will include a combination of single-family homes and two-flats.\nThe award is the third cycle of the\nChicago Prize\n, an initiative launched in 2019 to spur economic development in Chicago\u2019s South and West sides. It\u2019s the first time the prize has funded building affordable homes in Chicago\u2019s working-class neighborhoods.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for people to create economic wealth when they\u2019re starting at a low income level,\u201d said Cindy Moelis, president of the Pritzker Traubert Foundation.\u00a0 \u201cThis project is trying to get housing built for less money, as well as getting families into affordable homes.\u201d\nThe donation will help speed up the construction process for the Chicago Lawn site, said Richard Townsell, the executive director of Lawndale Christian Development Corporation, one of the groups behind Reclaiming Chicago.\n\u201cAny time you can get that amount of money that you don\u2019t have to borrow, it makes a big difference,\u201d he said. \u201cI can move at a speed and at a pace that I wouldn\u2019t if I had to go through banks and layers of bureaucracy at the city.\u201d\nThe award plan requires the group to begin construction at the site within 18 months, and the group has agreed to complete 100 homes within five years of the award, Moelis said.\nReclaiming Chicago has been at work since 2021, and has already built about 90 homes on previously empty city lots elsewhere, with about 75 under construction. The large lot for the 74th and Talman development will help consolidate construction costs, said Jeff Bartow, executive director of the Southwest Organizing Project, which is leading the effort alongside The Resurrection Project.\n\u201cIt provides an ability to move more efficiently and economically because of the scale,\u201d Bartow said.\nBridging the gap\nReclaiming Chicago is confronting a challenge that makes private development for single-family homes on the South Side difficult: homes generally can\u2019t sell for more than it costs to build them.\nThe group is expecting construction for each home to cost between $400,000 and $450,000, Chicago Prize senior advisor Teresa Prim said. Once constructed, they will be sold to people making between 80 to 120 percent of the area median income with a target price between $260,000 and $280,000, Prim said. The two-flats will be sold for $390,000.\n\u201cThis provides opportunities for families to build equity, to build wealth, and it\u2019s great for our neighborhoods,\u201d Bartow said.\nReclaiming Chicago is taking advantage of state subsidies to cover those costs, and Townsell said he hopes their project can serve as an example to attract more private development in the area.\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost doing a proof of concept that this can be done, so that we can attract some of the larger national builders to come back to Chicago and build at scale,\u201d Townsell said.\nBeyond the initial project in Chicago Lawn, the Chicago Prize will add to an existing loan fund designed to recycle its capital from sales to build more homes. Reclaiming Chicago borrows from the fund to finance construction and repays the loans when homes are sold. The income from those sales will go back into the fund to finance future projects.\nBringing down costs\nReclaiming Chicago is also lobbying for policy changes that will bring down construction costs and make the affordable homes it\u2019s building more feasible. City policies that slow down constructions are one of the major barriers to affordable homebuilding, Townsell said.\nMembers of the coalition have been involved in city initiatives like\nCut the Tape\naimed at speeding up the building process.\n\u201cThe goal of (Reclaiming Chicago) is really to advocate for policy changes that are going to help not just them, but other builders and other community leaders and developers build affordable homes faster and cheaper,\u201d Pritzker Traubert Foundation director of community investment Kareeshma Ali said.\nReclaiming Chicago is led by United Power for Action and Justice and includes the Southwest Organizing Project, The Resurrection Project, Lawndale Christian Development Corporation, Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives, the Hope Center Foundation, and Precious Blood Ministry of Reconciliation. The coalition was chosen for the Chicago Prize from among four finalists, which included proposals in North Lawndale, Pullman/Roseland and Bronzeville.\n",

In the complaint previously\nreported\nby Bloomberg Law, Herschmann alleges he is owed millions in unpaid wages due to Kasowitz\u2019s mismanagement of the company, which caused profits to collapse.\nKasowitz allegedly \u201csecretly saddle[d] the firm with huge amounts of debt to pay partner distributions,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Furthermore, Herschmann claims Kasowitz breached his fiduciary duties.\nIn addition to unpaid wages, Herschmann is calling for \u201can accounting of the firm\u2019s secretive finances.\u201d He did not respond to the publication\u2019s request for comment.\nIn a statement to\nThe Real Deal\n, a spokesperson for Kasowitz LLP said the lawsuit was \u201ca false document filled with inaccuracies and misstatements of fact.\u201d\n\u201cFor 30 years, Mr. Herschmann was paid extraordinarily well for relatively few billable hours and small amounts of business,\u201d the spokesperson added.\nHerschmann was a partner at the firm, long known as Kasowitz Benson Torres, from 1996 to 2020, when he departed to serve as a senior adviser in President Donald Trump\u2019s first term. He previously served on Trump\u2019s legal team during the president\u2019s first impeachment trial.\nAfter leaving the White House, Herschmann was lured back to his old firm after learning from Kasowitz that the company was \u201cfinancially healthy and successful,\u201d according to the lawsuit. He was allegedly promised a role that would drive \u201capproximately $10 million per year in business.\u201d\nThis year, Herschmann and two other ex-partners at Kasowitz \u2014 including one of the namesakes of the firm\u2019s former moniker \u2014 launched Herschmann Benson Bowen. Other departures from Kasowitz\u2019s firm this year include a pair of partners who left in March and a significant litigator who moved on in June.\nKasowitz rebranded in June to remove the names of a pair of former partners.\nThe firm dates back to 1993 and counts industry heavyweights, including\nSL Green\n,\nJDS Development\n, JLL and Related Companies, along with characters like former\nDouglas Elliman chairman Howard Lorber\nand\nbillionaire developer Ben Ashkenazy\n.\nIn 2023, Kasowitz was named Practice Group of the Year for Real Estate by Law360.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

When the new site opens, the bank will shutter nearby branches at\n605 North Michigan Avenue\nand 875 North Michigan Avenue in the former John Hancock Center, folding those operations into the new flagship. Executives said the closures won\u2019t happen until the new branch is up and running.\nThe Michigan Avenue outpost will be one of only three co-located Chase and JP Morgan banking centers in the country, with the others in California. The JP Morgan Financial Center model launched last year in New York and San Francisco and has since grown to about 20 locations nationwide, with another 10 planned next year.\nJPMorgan\u2019s concept is to pursue what it sees as a fast growing,but underserved slice of the wealth market: households worth between $1 million and $5 million, the outlet reported. The offering sits above Chase Private Client, which targets customers with $150,000 to $1 million, and comes with dedicated advisers and broader access to investment and lending services.\nThe move also highlights a trend in how big banks use brick and mortar, the publication reported. JPMorgan has pared back its Chicago area branch count by nearly 30 percent since 2015, even as it keeps investing in higher-profile, experience driven locations. The Michigan Avenue buildout will feature upscale finishes, private meeting rooms and what executives describe as a more \u201cclub-like\u201d feel than a traditional branch.\nThe deal is another data point in the Magnificent Mile\u2019s uneven real estate comeback. Uniqlo exited the space in 2021 as pandemic-era vacancies piled up, joining Gap and Macy\u2019s among the notable departures, but it plans to return to the\ncorridor\nnext year. Since then, the corridor has leaned into experiential and nontraditional retail, from the Museum of Ice Cream at Tribune Tower to Hotel Chocolat\u2019s new U.S. flagship next door.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Bloomberg is doubling down on Midtown East.\nThe media and data giant inked a nearly 500,000-square-foot lease extension at Global Holdings\u2019\n120 Park Avenue\n, locking in space across 20 of the 26-story tower\u2019s floors, the landlord announced. The renewal ranks as the largest office lease of the fourth quarter and one of 2025\u2019s largest overall.\nThe new 11-year deal replaces Bloomberg\u2019s prior lease, which wasn\u2019t set to expire until 2029, and keeps the company anchored across Midtown East. Bloomberg first moved into the building in 2011 and now occupies the majority of the Class A tower, which sits across from Grand Central Terminal between East 41st and East 42nd streets. Asking rent was $135 per square foot, per\nCrain\u2019s\n, which first reported the deal.\nThe Park Avenue renewal is the latest move in Bloomberg\u2019s\nMidtown East expansion spree\n. Last year, the company\nextended its\u00a0 947,000-square-foot\u00a0 lease\nfor the entirety of 731 Lexington Avenue\u2019s office space through 2040. That building, owned by Alexander\u2019s, is home to Bloomberg\u2019s headquarters and 7,000 of its 12,000 New York-based employees. Bloomberg also signed a lease to\nexpand its footprint at SL Green\u2019s 919 Third Avenue\nto nearly 925,000 square feet, up from 749,000 square feet at the property.\nThe Park Avenue extension comes as Eyal Ofer\u2019s firm rolls out a slate of capital improvements at the nearly century-old tower. Planned upgrades include a revamped lobby, elevator modernization and fa\u00e7ade renovations.\nCBRE\u2019s Howard Fiddle, Chris Mansfield and Zachary Weil represented Bloomberg in the deal. Global Holdings was represented in-house by Chris Roth, Craig Panzirer and Alex Radmin, along with JLL\u2019s Paul Glickman and Diana Biasotti.\n",

The Manhattan-based buyer submitted\na $1.6 billion bid\nfor the acquisition in September, which was $6.60 per share, 11 percent below market price.\nSaray Capital, a Dubai-based investment firm with a small stake in Paramount, swooped in this month with an offer of $6.95 per share, according to a regulatory filing. But Paramount\u2019s board recommended the Rithm offer due to \u201cmaterial deficiencies\u201d in Saray\u2019s offer, including a dearth of committed financing.\nIn another notable vote by shareholders, a vast majority rejected Behler\u2019s\n$34 million exit package\n, deemed unwarranted by a proxy adviser ahead of the vote.\nUnfortunately for those shareholders, the vote was not binding and Paramount revealed in a regulatory filing that Behler will likely get his golden parachute as long as a sale goes through. Behler\u2019s compensation will include $10.7 million in cash, $19.97 million in unvested equity awards and $3.3 million in other compensation.\nBehler has been the CEO of Paramount since 1991. He led Paramount through its $2.3 billion initial public offering in 2014, which was the largest IPO for a U.S. REIT at the time.\nHe\u2019s been a controversial figure lately, however. This year, Paramount revealed it paid millions to Behler\u2019s personal companies and interests. The previously undisclosed payments included $3 million to a private jet company \u2014 of which Behler had a 50 percent stake \u2014 and $900,000 for Behler\u2019s personal accounting services.\nIn July, Paramount revealed it was under SEC investigation related to disclosures for related-party transactions, conflicts of interest and executive compensation.\nThe Real Deal\nalso discovered Behler\npushed\nfor a no-bid security contract for 60 Wall Street, a 1.6 million-square-foot vacant office building, to Guardian Services. Behler\u2019s ex-girlfriend worked at Guardian and the two maintained friendly relations after their romantic relationship ended.\nThe sale of Paramount is expected to close by the end of the second quarter. Paramount controls 13 million square feet of office space in New York and San Francisco.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "One of Los Angeles\u2019 biggest landlords is largely shutting its doors to Section 8 renters, according to a new investigation.\nJamison\nroutinely rejected tenants using federal housing vouchers at many of its buildings, Capital &amp; Main\nreported\n. The findings say Jamison violated state law, which bars discrimination against Section 8 voucher holders in California.\nCapital &amp; Main, a Los Angeles-based independent news organization, hired testers posing as Section 8 voucher holders who contacted leasing agents at 65 buildings owned or operated by seven major landlords between late 2024 and early 2025. Of the 21 Jamison properties tested, agents at 15 said they did not accept Section 8 vouchers at all. At others, agents cited income or credit requirements that would effectively exclude voucher holders, or failed to follow up after initially suggesting vouchers might be accepted. Between 2021 and 2024, only one Section 8 tenant moved into a Jamison property, according to housing authority records obtained by Capital &amp; Main.\nJamison said in a statement that its management companies \u201caccept and welcome tenants utilizing Section 8 vouchers.\u201d The firm called some issues found in the report \u201ccompletely wrong and/or misleading,\u201d though it did not specify which, according to Capital &amp; Main.\nState law prevents landlords from rejecting tenants based on source of income, including\nhousing vouchers\n. Since January 2024, landlords have been legally barred from denying Section 8 applicants solely based on credit history and must consider alternative proof of ability to pay. Testers were reportedly told that Jamison buildings were awaiting \u201ccity approvals\u201d or \u201cinspections\u201d before accepting vouchers, but the\nHousing Authority of the City of Los Angeles\nhas no such approval or inspection process, Carlos Van Natter, the agency\u2019s Section 8 director, told Capital &amp; Main. \u201cWe would not inspect the whole building,\u201d Van Natter said, noting that the body only inspects individual apartments to ensure livability after a landlord has accepted a tenant\u2019s rental application.\nSection 8\nsubsidizes rent for approximately 85,000 households in L.A. County through Housing Choice Vouchers. About 40 percent of voucher holders fail to secure housing before their assistance expires \u2014 typically 60 days \u2014 even after years of waiting, Natter said.\nJamison\u2019s portfolio of about 6,000 units at 33 multifamily properties was largely built after 2013, exempting the firm from local rent control laws or the state\u2019s maximum 10 percent per year limit on rent increases at those newer buildings.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A data center startup co-founded by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt is hitching its growth plans to one of Texas\u2019 oldest \u2014 and increasingly valuable \u2014 landowners, betting that cheap power and vast acreage in the Permian Basin can anchor the next wave of AI infrastructure.\nBolt Data &amp; Energy announced it raised $150 million in capital and struck a partnership with Texas Pacific Land Corporation, which is investing another $50 million into the venture, according to a joint press release Wednesday. The tie-up positions Bolt Data to develop large-scale data centers on Texas Pacific\u2019s sprawling West Texas holdings, as demand for energy-hungry AI computers accelerates, Bloomberg\nreported\n.\nTPL will receive an equity stake, warrants and a right of first refusal to supply water to Bolt-affiliated projects and related infrastructure. Bolt, meanwhile, is lining up commercial partners and anchor tenants to build massive data hubs on TPL-controlled land, according to the release.\nThe deal adds a new chapter to Texas Pacific Land\u2019s unlikely transformation from a Wild West-era land trust into a Wall Street darling riding the\nAI boom\n. Founded more than a century ago, the Dallas-based company owns roughly 882,000 acres, most of it in the oil-rich Permian Basin, and has seen its stock more than triple this year, pushing its market value to nearly $40 billion, the release shows.\nBolt is pitching itself as a faster, vertically integrated alternative to traditional data center developers. The company plans to focus not just on building server farms, but also on securing power generation \u2014 from natural gas and renewables initially, with nuclear on the longer-term roadmap \u2014 to shorten the gap between demand and delivery of data at scale, according to the statement.\nFor real estate and infrastructure players, West Texas is emerging as a compelling data center market. Natural gas prices in the Permian are among the cheapest in the country, land is abundant and regulatory hurdles are lighter than in coastal markets. Those advantages have already drawn interest from hyperscalers like Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, all of which are hunting for reliable, low-cost electricity to feed\nAI workloads\n.\nTPL\u2019s business model may make it a particularly attractive partner. While it doesn\u2019t drill for oil or gas itself, the company monetizes its land through royalties, surface leases, easements and permits tied to pipelines, power lines, utilities and industrial uses. Data centers slot neatly into that, offering long-term leases and infrastructure revenue without the commodity risk of energy production, according to the publication.\nThe partnership is the latest in a sprint of multiple players through the state. Open AI\u2019s Stargate push,\nNvidia\n,\nFermi\nand others are plotting data centers in West Texas and elsewhere across Texas.

The price reflects about a 24 percent reduction from the previous ask.\nThe weekly roundup, compiled by Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team, reviews data from listings of $4 million or more in the Multiple Listing Service. When it comes to new inventory, the report includes re-lists.\nVilla Siena\u2019s about 35,000 square feet, making the asking price per square foot roughly $3,857 to move into the eight-bedroom, 20-bathroom home. The estate touts 30-foot glass walls, a four-story floating staircase, retractable roof in the primary suite, 22-seat cinema and jazz bar among other features.\nThe home first entered the market last September with an asking price of $177 million.\nThe listing at the time was held by the Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Rayni and Branden Williams, along with Shana and Emila Tavangarian. The Tavangarians are the daughters of Ardie Tavangarian and\njoined Carolwood Estates\nin April.\nNew to the current listing is Drew Fenton, Carolwood\u2019s founder and CEO, who is co-listing the property with Rayni.\u00a0 Branden and the Tavangarians also remain on the listing.\nLast week, Los Angeles County had 11 properties go into contract, which amounted to $68.7 million in asking volume, according to the Eklund Gomes report. Asking volume was off roughly 37 percent from the year-ago period.\nThe top home to enter into contract last week, based on list price, was 521 Spoleto Drive in the Pacific Palisades. The home is asking nearly $13 million, or $2,536 per square foot.\nThe five-bed, five-bath home is over 5,000 square feet, sitting on a lot that\u2019s about a third of an acre.\nWestside Estate Agency\u2019s Kurt Rappaport holds the listing on behalf of a trust, according to property records.\nThe home last sold in 2017 for $8.9 million, or $1,734 per square foot.\n",

Amidi received a temporary certificate of occupancy for the building in November 2024 and began leasing this February, reaching 95 percent occupancy by the time the Oaktree deal closed.\nThe eight-story building spans 220,018 square feet across 228 studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments ranging in size from 470 to 1,848 square feet. Average monthly rent is $3,972, per Yardi Matrix data cited by Multi-Housing News. Apartments are outfitted with stainless steel appliances and in-unit washers and dryers, with balconies in some units. Building amenities include a resort-style pool and spa, a rooftop terrace, a fitness center with a steam room and sauna and a business center. The ground floor has more than 5,200 square feet of retail space.\nAmidi has expanded its TenTen-branded luxury multifamily developments across California. Other TenTen projects in development include TenTen Hollywood, TenTen Sunnyvale and the second phase of TenTen Wilshire.\nIn July, the Bay Area-based firm sold TenTen Glendale, a 66-unit mid-rise at 111 North Louise Street in\nGlendale\n, to Regent Properties for $33.5 million. That housing came online in 2019 with fully furnished units in studio, one- and two-bedroom floorplans.\nAside from TenTen, Amidi also builds commercial and mixed-use developments under its Hollywood Production Center and Plug and Play Tech Center brands. There are six Hollywood Production Center locations across the Los Angeles area and more than 30 Plug and Play Tech Center properties around the world.\n",

        "content": "Yet another ultra-luxury mansion sold in Dallas, leading to roughly $70 million in sales dollar volume within 10 square miles in the past two weeks.\nThe Sharif Family Revocable Trust, organized by local entrepreneurs Sardar and Rida Sharif, sold their six-bedroom, eight-bathroom Preston Hollow spec mansion at 1 Dorset Place on Monday to a trust owned by Tu and Alex Dao, CEO and president of Orthomed Anesthesia, according to public records.\nThe final sale price is unavailable, but at the time of the sale, the home was asking $23 million. Even if the Sharifs accepted a discount \u2014 which would match recent Texas ultra-luxury trends \u2014 they likely made a tidy profit. They bought the land in 2022 when it was asking $2.8 million, according to Zillow and Redfin.\nThe sellers asked about $1,500 per square foot for the 15,700-square-foot home on an acre lot. Built this year, the home has a neoclassical style with a symmetrical design and a cut stone veneer. Less antiquarian is the property\u2019s 15-car garage. Jonathan Rosen with Compass Real Estate had the listing.\nThe Dorset Place property listed in October with a slew of other ultra-luxury homes, mostly concentrated in Dallas.\nA house on Hunters Glen Road\nasking $26 million narrowly surpassed it as the most expensive new home for sale in the state.\nLarry Lacerte\u2019s home in Highland Park\nand\na castle in Houston\nstole the show that month with listing prices of $35 million and $60 million, respectively.\nWhile Texas sellers have hung some big price tags this year, some of the state\u2019s top luxury deals closed well below the asking prices. Aerospace manufacturing mogul Guinn Crousen\nlisted\nhis Highland Park mansion for $32.5 million and\nsold it\nfor $25.5 million. Soon afterwards, the late Fortress CEO Josh Pack\u2019s University Park home\nsold for $30.5 million\nafter\nasking $35 million\n.\nBoth of these deals took place within the last two weeks, and both are just miles away from the Daos\u2019 new home.\nRosen did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Texas law does not require the disclosure of final sale prices.\nSardar Sharif bought a five-bedroom, eight-bathroom home at 10260 Strait Lane in September, according to public records, apparently in an off-market deal.\n",

        "content": "Land ownership around San Antonio\u2019s most ambitious redevelopment project is starting to shift.\nCity officials formally moved toward acquiring 5.7 acres of federally-owned land in and around Hemisfair, clearing a path for future development tied to Project Marvel, the mixed-use district proposed to include a new San Antonio Spurs arena. The San Antonio Planning Commission voted unanimously this week to recommend the city purchase a federal office building at 727 East C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez Boulevard, along with two nearby parking lots at 610 and 611 Indianola Street, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe properties are owned by the federal government and were placed on the General Services Administration\u2019s accelerated disposition list earlier this year, as part of the Trump administration\u2019s push to reduce\nfederal real estate holdings\n. Sale prices have not been disclosed, and the parcels are not currently assessed for taxable value.\nA city spokesperson said the San Antonio City Council is expected to take up the acquisition in January, with closing anticipated 60 to 120 days after approval.\nIn a memo to the planning commission, city staff said federal employees would remain tenants in the 163,000-square-foot office building for up to five years while predevelopment planning moves forward. Any redevelopment would also be constrained by restrictive covenants overseen by the Texas Historical Commission.\nCity officials framed the acquisition as a necessary fix for longstanding connectivity issues at Hemisfair. The federal properties, they wrote, have functioned as a \u201csignificant buffer\u201d that limits pedestrian and vehicle access to the park, contributing to weak investment and\nstalled redevelopmen\nt in the Tower Park area.\nBringing the land under city control would allow for clearer entry points, better wayfinding and development more consistent with the vision for a dense, mixed-use district surrounding the park.\nThe city\u2019s interest in the site has been public for months. Earlier this year, City Manager Erik Walsh described the building as a priority acquisition after it landed on the federal disposition list. Former Hemisfair CEO Andres Andujar also flagged the property as critical to making Project Marvel succeed, noting that its eventual availability could draw strong interest from private developers.\nMomentum for the broader plan picked up in November, when Bexar County\nvoters approved\n$311 million in public funding for Hemisfair-area development.\nProject Marvel\u2019s broader scope along with a new San Antonio Spurs arena includes expansion of the Henry B. Gonz\u00e1lez Convention Center, a 1,000-room hotel, a 5,000-seat venue and about 50 acres of mixed-use development. The city already approved a Project Finance Zone, allowing it to collect up to $2 billion in hotel taxes over 30 years. The total cost of the arena exceeds $1.2 billion, but the Bexar County money approved on the ballot is only part of the total pot. The city of San Antonio is also expected to chip in $490 million, and the Spurs organization\ncommitted\nto $1 billion toward the district.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Bank OZK was the senior lender pledging $475 million in financing, while GoldenTree and TZ provided the $125 million mezzanine loan.\nLast August, Naftali snagged\n$675 million\nin financing from JP Morgan to close his deal to buy Eliot Spitzer and the Winter Organization\u2019s rental building at 800 Fifth Avenue. Naftali agreed to purchase the building in March 2024 for $800 million.\nNaftali signed a contract to purchase the Williamsburg Wharf site, a former lumberyard, for $180 million in 2019 and closed on a portion of it in 2020 for $100 million. At the time, the site was considered the last piece of undeveloped land along the East River in North Brooklyn.\nThe developers last year\nunveiled plans\nfor the sprawling development, which Naftali described as an \u201curban resort.\u201d Among them was a condo tower, dubbed One Williamsburg Wharf, which has, in the months since, snagged several pricey deals.\nOne Williamsburg Wharf has been battling with Two Trees\u2019 One Domino Square for the record of the\nhighest price per square foot\nfor a condo in Williamsburg. A team with Serhant, led by Peter Zaitzeff, is heading sales at the Wharf building, which has sold more than 60 percent of its units since launching last September, according to the latest data from Marketproof.\nThe developers also notched their\nfirst retail lease\nin March. Israeli celebrity chef Eyal Shani\u2019s restaurant group Good People Group agreed to lease 4,000 square feet on the ground floor with plans to open a new restaurant.\n",

One week later, a third unit on the 42nd floor sold for almost $45 million, according to public records.\nAll three units, the most expensive closings in the building to date, spanned 6,942 square feet and closed for over $6,400 per square foot.\nSome of the most expensive units that have found buyers still have yet to close. Unit 52E, another combination unit spanning nearly 7,000 square feet, nabbed a contract with a last asking price of\n$54.5 million\nlast December. (Mansion Global\nreported\nthis week that the deal is expected to close for that price, but has yet to be recorded.)\nThe recent deals cap off what has been a strong year for the Lincoln Square tower, which has been more than a decade in the making after developer Gary Barnett scooped up the first parcel of the assemblage in 2014.\nBarnett has since had to navigate stiff local opposition to the 775-foot-tower, culminating in a 2019 lawsuit that was ultimately\nthrown out in 2021\n. Following that suit, the law firm Extell hired to defend its project\nsued for unpaid legal\nfees last year.\nBut 2025 has seemed to make the trials and tribulations all worth it. Since starting closings earlier this year, the building is now over 70 percent sold, according to Marketproof.\nAmenities at the 127-unit tower include full-size basketball and pickleball courts, an indoor saltwater lap pool, bowling alley and sauna and steam room. The building will have another set of amenities on the 20th floor that include an outdoor saltwater pool and hot tub.\nBarnett is busy elsewhere on the Upper West Side, where he\u2019s slowly unveiled a number of buildings planned on the site of the former Disney campus.\nIn November, Extell\nfiled plans\nwith the city for a 355-foot-tall building at 37 West 66th Street, which called for 58 residential units and ground-floor retail. The overall lot calls for up to 158 residential units, indicating that more building is likely to come.\nOn another piece of the former Disney Campus, Barnett is hoping to build a\n1,200-foot supertall\non Columbus Avenue that would dwarf his and every other tower in the area.\n",

        "content": "The latest office building sale in downtown Los Angeles is a bright spot in one of the country\u2019s hardest-hit commercial real estate markets in the post-pandemic years.\nL.A. Metro\nbought the 106,004-square-foot office building at 500 South Santa Fe Avenue in the Arts District for $45 million, CoStar\nreported\n. The county\u2019s transit agency acquired the property in an off-market deal from development firm SteelWave. At about $450 per square foot, the sale dwarfs the downtown office average of $240 per square foot and the $342 per square foot average in Greater Los Angeles.\nCushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s Michael Condon Jr., Pete Collins, Steve Marcussen, Brittany Winn, Erica Finke and Reif Gratsch represented SteelWave in the deal. L.A. Metro was represented by Cresa\u2019s Lawson Martin and Clayton Hovivian.\nSan Francisco-based SteelWave\npurchased the property\nin 2021 as part of a two-building, 157,247-square-foot portfolio called The Switchyard from CEG Construction for $80 million. Both buildings were vacant at the time of the sale. The post-pandemic dip in tech tenants seeking space kept SteelWave from finding tenants, leading it to sell off the buildings in separate deals. SteelWave offloaded the neighboring 51,243-square-foot building at 540 South Santa Fe Avenue\nto DTLA Law Group\nin August for $20 million, or $396 per square foot.\nL.A. Metro, a division of the County of Los Angeles, already owns a three-story, 86,000-square-foot building down the street at 590 South Santa Fe Avenue that it developed in 2019. That property has offices, a warehouse for spare parts, 11 maintenance bays for Metro vehicles, a tire shop, a machine shop and a vehicle-washing station. The\nCounty of Los Angeles\nowns 146 properties totaling 12 million square feet across the region.\nThe sale is the newest sign of continued recovery of office sales in Los Angeles overall. Transaction volume in the third quarter was up 56 percent over the same period last year, according to CoStar data. With such a significant improvement from a year ago, the market \u201cmight have finally bottomed out\u201d and appears to be \u201cback on the upswing,\u201d said Catherine Yeh, CoStar\u2019s director of market analytics for Los Angeles.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "It\u2019s almost game, set, match for\nAlexandria Real Estate Equities\nat the embattled San Francisco Tennis Club site.\nPasadena-based Alexandria plans to list the 2.6-acre property at 88 Bluxome Street in the first quarter of next year, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n, citing two sources familiar with the matter. An estimated asking price has not been disclosed.\nAlexandria acquired the Bay Club\u2019s San Francisco Tennis Club in 2017 for $130 million. The site is entitled for both a 1.1 million-square-foot commercial project and a 1,500-unit residential project, giving a potential buyer a choice between the entitlements. Neither option would include a\nreplacement tennis club\nthat Alexandria initially promised to build.\nWhen Alexandria bought the location, the firm plotted renovating the building into a commercial project with 775,000 square feet of office space, a roughly 135,000-square-foot basement-level tennis club and additional commercial and retail space above ground.\nIn early 2019, Pinterest signed a 490,000-square-foot pre-lease to become the property\u2019s anchor tenant, but it terminated the lease in August 2020 and opted to stay at its existing offices in South of Market. With that potential tenant out of the picture, the financial feasibility of the development became difficult to overcome, leading Alexandria to abandon the proposed replacement tennis club and explore selling the property.\nAlexandria secured city approval for a version of the commercial project that did not include new tennis facilities in 2023, prompting a lawsuit from the San Franciscans for Sports and Recreation group that was\nsettled for $7.5 million\n. Still, vertical construction never began.\nIn May,\nStrada Development Group\nproposed building\n1,500 units across two towers\nat the SoMa site, becoming the first firm to take advantage of new regulations allowing large-scale development projects in Central SoMa to pivot from commercial to residential use. The entitlement calls for 785 residential units in one 599-foot tower and 715 units in a smaller 528-foot building, both complying with the San Francisco Planning Commission\u2019s 600-foot height limit for new multifamily projects. Of the 1,500 units, 150 would be set aside for very-low-income residents. The San Francisco Planning Department approved the residential plan earlier this month, SF YIMBY\nreported\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The historic property was built in 1943 for the seller, which supplied glassware for the World War II war effort and produced bottles for Dr Pepper and Lone Star Beer. O-I used the plant until 2023.\nThe 1 million-square foot plant is the largest manufacturing facility between Dallas and\nAustin\n, a vital corridor of the\nTexas Triangle\n, Keating Resources President Alec Keating said. The buyer is subdividing the 907,000-square-foot distribution portion of the building into 100,000-square-foot units for lease or sale as a multi-tenant distribution and manufacturing facility.\nThe property includes two active rail spurs served by Union Pacific; altogether, the site can accommodate 90 boxcars at a time. The property also has natural gas and electric service, clear heights of up to 33 feet, and 20 acres of outdoor storage. Most importantly is its site at the nexus of the Texas Triangle, America\u2019s fastest growing megaregion, cornered by Houston, San Antonio and Dallas/Fort Worth.\nThe sale price is undisclosed, but Keating Resources has now set a lease rate of $6.50 per square foot gross, according to the company\u2019s leasing brochure.\n\u201cWe have soft commitments on about 20 percent of the building,\u201d Keating told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cThere\u2019s basically no vacancy in the Waco market because, unlike\nDallas\nand\nAustin\n, there\u2019s nobody building spec product. So we expect this to lease up pretty quickly, and there\u2019s a strong manufacturing base in Waco.\u201d\nJosh Heiple with CBRE represented the seller, and Jordan Beard with Cromwell Commercial represented the buyer.\nWaco is home to several manufacturing plants, including centers for Mars Wrigley, Graphic Packaging and Barsco.

        "content": "\u201cYou fucked us over good!\u201d\nThat\u2019s what one audience member at Thursday\u2019s City Council meeting yelled after the Committee on Housing and Buildings voted to approve several bills. The parting shot likely captures the sentiment felt by many landlords as well as others in the industry.\nIndeed, on their way out the door, the City Council left its mark on the city\u2019s housing market, a move that some believe will stunt housing construction and scare away investment.\nThe Council, at its final meeting with its current membership, approved a\npackage\nof bills that housing groups claim will hamstring Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani\u2019s housing plan before he even takes office. It also signed off on the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act, or COPA, a measure that landlords and brokers warn will upend the city\u2019s real estate market.\nSupporters of the housing regulation bills, however, believe that the measures will better steer public financing to the types of housing most needed by New Yorkers, including family-sized rentals.\n\u201cToday\u2019s items reflect a shared commitment of this Council that when we use public resources to shape our housing market, we do so with intention, equity and real accountability to New Yorkers,\u201d City Council Majority Leader Amanda Far\u00edas said ahead of the Committee on Land Use\u2019s vote. \u201cTaken together, these bills reflect a clear principle: When the city provides financial assistance, the public should see public benefit in affordability, unit mix and opportunity.\u201d\nThree of the bills set new rules for the kinds of housing the city finances, implementing minimum thresholds for the percentage of rental units dedicated to very-low, and extremely-low income tenants, as well as for the percentage of units with two- and three-bedrooms and those designated as homeownership units.\nThe Council additionally voted in favor of a measure that sets a minimum $40 an hour wage and benefit package for construction workers on housing projects with 150 units or more that are funded by at least $1.5 million in city financing.\nThe Department of Housing Preservation and Development estimates that those bills alone would cost $600 million a year (out of a capital budget of $2 billion) to maintain its current level of housing production and preservation, or result in 3,275 fewer housing units being financed if that money is not procured. During a press conference ahead of the full City Council meeting, Speaker Adrienne Adams didn\u2019t dispute those estimates, but said the Council \u201cstands with our information.\u201d\nA City Hall spokesperson would not say if the mayor plans to veto the measures, but indicated that the mayor is exploring his options.\u00a0If he does, it will be up to the next City Council \u2014\u00a0and its presumed next speaker, Julie Menin \u2014\u00a0to decide whether to override the vetoes. Notably, Menin abstained from voting on COPA, which did not secure a veto-proof majority.\n\u201cThese short-sighted bills will not only worsen the affordability crisis, but will also sandbag the incoming mayor and speaker,\u201d a spokesperson for the mayor said in a statement. \u201cIrresponsible actions like these demonstrate the importance of Mayor Adams\u2019 efforts to modernize the housing approval process through the ballot measures that passed this November.\u201d\nHousing groups argue that these measures threaten to deflate the effect of the various initiatives approved this year aimed at increasing the city\u2019s housing stock, including the just-passed housing\nballot measures\nand\nCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity\n.\nThe New York Housing Conference has warned that the new regulations could complicate Mamdani\u2019s plan to build 200,000 affordable housing units over the next decade. Though Mamdani hasn\u2019t taken a public position on the measure, a group that supports him, the Tenant Bloc, has spoken out against the bills that set thresholds for units with two- and three-bedroom units and for deeply affordable housing.\nThe Council on Thursday also approved\nCOPA\n, which applies to multifamily buildings with four or more units that are considered distressed (defined by various criteria) or that have affordability requirements expiring within the next two years.\nUnder the bill, certain city-approved entities are given the right of first offer and refusal on these multifamily properties, meaning they get first crack to bid on the properties and then a chance to match any competing offer.\nOpponents of the measure argue that it will scare away would-be buyers and delay deals. The bill also underscores a long-simmering tension over assumptions that nonprofits, by virtue of being not-for-profit, are more responsible owners than their for-profit counterparts. Landlord groups have pushed back on this notion and argued that HPD doesn\u2019t have the capacity to oversee COPA.\nHPD representatives\nexpressed\nsimilar concerns during a June hearing, suggesting that the Council should narrow the pool of eligible buildings. The bill has undergone a number of amendments, including limiting the types of buildings eligible and shrinking the exclusivity period for so-called qualified entities. These\nchanges\n, however, failed to win over the measure\u2019s biggest critics.\nCOPA supporters argue that the measure helps level the playing field for nonprofit owners who prioritize affordable housing.\u00a0Council member Sandy Nurse, the bill\u2019s sponsor, noted that she met with various stakeholders, including the Real Estate Board of New York, which led to extensive changes to the bill. She also noted that she inherited the bill, which was first introduced in 2020.\n\u201cWe made a lot of compromises based on feedback from all of those stakeholders,\u201d Nurse said.\nThe City Council did not vote on another bill that would have limited the percentage of city-funded studio apartments in senior housing projects. Members also didn\u2019t consider\na bill\nthat would have allowed owners of one- and two-family homes to rent out their homes short-term, through services like Airbnb, without having to be present in the home.\nThe Council approved other bills followed by the real estate industry, including a measure that will allow the city to sell tax liens to a land bank, rather than a private trust. Another sets\nminimum wages\nfor office security guards, a change proposed after the fatal shootings at Rudin Management\u2019s 345 Park Avenue.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the housing-related bills that passed:\nCOPA\nWhen owners decide to sell a multifamily building with four or more units that has a certain level of unpaid bills or violations or has affordability requirements expiring within the next two years, they must first notify the city, which will alert \u201cqualified entities\u201d \u2014 certain nonprofits and joint ventures between nonprofits and private companies \u2014\u00a0that the property is available.\nThose city-approved entities would then have 25 days to notify an owner that they are interested in bidding on a property. Once that time runs out, the interested qualified entities have 80 days to submit an offer. Qualified entities also have 15 days after a competing bid comes in to match it.\nHPD will determine the criteria for qualified entities, which must demonstrate a commitment to managing affordable housing. The bill is slated to go into effect one year after becoming law.\nConstruction Justice Act\nDevelopers of housing projects with 150 units or more that have construction costs of $3 million or more and receive $1.5 million or more in city financing (not including as-of-right tax breaks such as 485x), must pay construction workers a minimum of $40 per hour in wages and benefits (with at least $25 going specifically to wages). The city\u2019s Comptroller will determine annual increases to this rate.\nDevelopers must also make \u201cbest efforts\u201d to ensure that at least 30 percent of construction workers hired on these city-funded projects reside in the city. That is less stringent than earlier version of the bill.\nThe bill excludes supportive housing projects. The Real Estate Board of New York and HPD\ntestified\nlast year that the measure would be too expensive.\u00a0Still, the measure, which was backed by the city\u2019s laborers\u2019 union, was viewed as\nmore favorable\nthan another minimum wage bill pushed by the carpenters\u2019 union.\nThe new rules are slated to go into effect January 1, 2027.\nTwo-, three-bedroom bill\nThis measure requires that, over a five-year period starting July 1, 2027, at least 25 percent of the new dwelling units financed by the city are two-bedroom units and at least 15 percent have three bedrooms or more.\nHPD can change these thresholds if federal housing funding is cut by 50 percent or more, compared to the prior four years, or if the city sees a \u201ccomplete loss of availability of such resources to fund newly constructed affordable housing.\u201d\nThe measure excludes some projects from counting toward \u201ccovered projects\u201d that would be used to calculate the minimum percentages. Projects where at least 50 percent of the units are reserved for seniors, have fewer than 20 units, where more than 30 percent are supportive housing units and projects that have received key approvals by a certain date won\u2019t count toward those thresholds.\nAdministration sources have, however, pointed out an apparent technical error in this bill: Rather than separating the list of exclusions with an \u201cor\u201d the bill uses an \u201cand.\u201d If applied literally, the bill would result in fewer exclusions, and according to the administration, further drive up the bill\u2019s costs (HPD\u2019s calculations are based on what they believe to be the Council\u2019s intent).\nAffordability thresholds bill\nBeginning July 1, 2027, over a five-year period, at least 50 percent of new units funded by the city must be affordable for extremely low-income households (those earning no more than 30 percent of the area median income) and very low-income households (those earning no more than 50 percent AMI). At least 30 percent must be affordable to extremely low-income households.\nBuildings with fewer than 75 units wouldn\u2019t count toward the percentage calculation.\nHomeownership bill\nOver a five-year period, at least 4 percent of new housing units financed by the city must be homeownership units. This requirement goes into effect July 1, 2026.\nAir conditioning mandate\nLandlords, at the request of their tenants, are required to provide cooling systems (between June 15 and Sept. 12) to keep \u201ccovered rooms\u201d at a maximum air temperature of 78 degrees Fahrenheit. \u201cCovered rooms\u201d apply to a tenant\u2019s primary sleeping space, rather than the whole unit. In a win for rent-stabilized owners, the latest version of the bill requires tenants in regulated units to first consent to improvements needed to comply with the measure, as well as the related charges. Those charges would be applied through rent increases, as permitted by state law, which only allows the landlord to recoup a portion of the cost of individual apartment improvements.\nCo-op timeline\nUnder this measure, a co-op board must notify prospective residents that they have received an application to live at the building within 15 days. The board then has 45 days to accept or reject the application. The Council declined to take up more\ncontroversial\nco-op regulation measures, including one that would have required boards to disclose the reasons for rejecting applicants.\n",

        "content": "Did you read John Catsimatidis\u2019\nwild interview\nwith the New York Editorial Board?\nBefore I get to that, some history:\nCatsimatidis has clashed with me a couple of times \u2014 once because I supported a bill to ban supermarkets from giving away plastic bags (which passed and has worked well), and later because I doubted he would follow through on an idea to run for mayor again (he didn\u2019t).\nCats is a self-made billionaire. That doesn\u2019t happen by accident. It\u2019s fair to say he\u2019s a business savant, especially at buying companies dirt-cheap out of bankruptcy (oil refineries, gas stations/convenience stores) and making them profitable. He\u2019s best known for Gristedes, but that\u2019s not the primary source of his wealth.\nHe has also developed some large buildings in New York City, providing housing in a city that desperately needs it.\nBut his skill set does not extend to policies and politics, which are important for any mayor. That\u2019s why I found him an odd choice for an interview by a board focused on those topics.\nThe transcript was painful to read, as Cats rattled off fake-news talking points and conspiracy theories from the right-wing propaganda machine. I often write about socialist fantasies and propaganda, so you know my objection here isn\u2019t rooted in partisanship. I just prefer reality.\nBut eventually the board asked Cats about the grocery business, a subject he knows well, and he said something I found interesting: Gristedes\u2019 unionized workforce has done nothing to protect his supermarkets from nonunion competition.\nHe seemed bitter about that. He didn\u2019t mention that unions\nkept Walmart out\nof New York City, but that was\nlong ago\n. Today, several\nnonunion supermarket chains\nare\nexpanding aggressively\nhere (a\nboon\nto the real estate industry).\nBy contrast, the Hotel Trades Council\nstopped nonunion hotels\u2019 expansion cold\nby passing a\nspecial permit requirement\nin 2021. This was a pure transactional arrangement with Bill de Blasio and the City Council. Unionized hotels and their landlords were also winners in that deal.\nChampions of capitalism hate that kind of thing. Catsimatidis is certainly a capitalist. But I can understand why he wants the retail workers\u2019 unions to limit competition from nonunion chains. That is part of their job, and he\u2019s paying them. Who could blame him for wondering, \u201cWhat am I getting in return?\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nA City Council bill to allow\nhousing exclusive to artists\nseems like a bad idea. Artists-only housing in Soho was not well enforced, and the rule was routinely ignored. And the principle seems wrong: The bill would create an exception to discrimination law to discriminate against non-artists. Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Any vetoes by Mayor Eric Adams of bills passed Thursday by the City Council will not be subject to overrides until next month, when the Council will have a bunch of new members and, more importantly, a new speaker in Julie Menin. The speaker controls the agenda, so if Menin doesn\u2019t want a vetoed bill to become law, she can prevent a vote to override from even being held.\nElsewhere\u2026\nThe Kingston city council voted to keep rent stabilization by\nmaintaining its \u201chousing emergency\u201d\nstatus despite its housing survey last spring finding a citywide vacancy rate\nabove 7 percent\n.\nVacancy below 5 percent has always been necessary for declaring a housing emergency. And a housing emergency is necessary to have rent stabilization.\nKingston\u2019s vacancy rate is only under 5 percent in the subset of buildings eligible for rent stabilization. What typically matters, however, is the citywide rate, although the law is a bit vague. Landlords will surely sue if rent regulation continues. Is the council pushing the envelope in the hopes that a court will bless this approach?\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$46.8 million\nfor a 6,942-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at Gary Barnett\u2019s\n50 West 66th Street\nin Lincoln Square.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was $16 million for 144-32 and 144-36 Northern Boulevard in Flushing. The latter property, a 1,500-square-foot commercial space, fetched\n$11.2 million\nand 144-32, a single-family house, went for\n$4.8 million\n. An LLC tied to Century Development Group purchased the property.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$3.85 million\nfor a 3,120-square-foot house at 176-12 Kildare Road in Jamaica Estates. Leah Musheyeva with Exit Realty First Choice has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 315,325-square-foot, 156-unit project at 136-48 37th Avenue in Flushing. Frank Fusaro of Handel Architects filed the permit on behalf of Richard Siu of F&amp;T Group.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "South Florida multifamily landlords felt the sting from elevated expenses this year.\nCase in point: The top deal was a $235 million purchase of a Boca Raton apartment building out of bankruptcy proceedings. The seller had put the building into Chapter 11 reorganization, avoiding an impending foreclosure auction from the lender over a $145 million loan.\nNo other deal in this year\u2019s ranking broke $200 million in value.\nSouth Florida has a reputation as a healthier apartment market than other parts of the U.S. due to the tri-county region becoming a magnet for out-of-staters during the first three years of the pandemic. This created\nunprecedented demand\n, record rent growth, and hefty development and investment sales activity.\nBut South Florida also felt the pinch of\neconomic headwinds\nin recent years. The Sunshine State is battered by expensive insurance, despite some stabilization in the market in the past year.\nMeanwhile, higher interest rates made refinancings harder. After the Federal Reserve imposed 11 aggressive benchmark interest rate increases in 2022 and 2023, it cut the rate six times this year and last.\nOn the leasing side, hefty apartment completions in South Florida created a\nsupply overhang\n, slower lease-ups and increased concessions over the past year. Average rental rates across the region decreased\n2.7 percent\nin November from November 2024, according to Realtor.com.\nSome buyers still in the multifamily investment game turned to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae loans, or debt from insurance companies, which generally have more favorable terms. Others assumed sellers\u2019 existing loans on apartment properties or closed all-cash deals. Some buyers relied on fully funded\ndiscretionary funds\n, which allow for lower debt leverage.\nHere are South Florida\u2019s top 10 multifamily deals for 2025.\nGrant Cardone takes the lead \u2014 again\nSocial media personality Grant Cardone, who also is a multifamily syndicator and proffers his 10X platform as a way for companies to supercharge their businesses, partnered with the seller of the distressed 101 Via Mizner to purchase the asset out of bankruptcy.\nThe deal saved Penn-Florida Companies, which had developed 101 Via Mizner and was facing foreclosure from its lender, from losing the building.\nIn July, the bankruptcy court approved for Cardone\u2019s Aventura-based Cardone Capital and Boca Raton-based Penn-Florida to purchase 101 Via Mizner for\n$235 million\n. The 14-story, 366-unit building is at 101 East Camino Real in Boca Raton. The price broke down to $642,077 per apartment.\nUnder the deal, Cardone Capital was responsible for $220 million, and Penn-Florida for $15 million of the price. The joint venture plans to convert the building into condos, projecting roughly $400 million in total unit sales.\nLed by Mark Gensheimer, Penn-Florida completed 101 Via Mizner in 2016 and filed for\nChapter 11 reorganization\nin January, staving off a foreclosure auction. Lender Blackstone Mortgage Trust previously had filed for a Uniform Commercial Code foreclosure for a\n$145 million\nloan.\nCardone\u2019s\nheadline-grabbing multifamily deals also landed him the top spot in\nThe Real Deal South Florida\u2019s\nrankings last year and in 2021.\nFunds affiliated with Cardone Capital paid more than\n$500 million in cash\nfor three Broward County apartment properties last year. They are the 382-unit Manor at Flagler Village building in Fort Lauderdale\u2019s Flagler Village neighborhood; the 332-unit Edge at Flagler Village building, also in Flagler Village; and the 468-unit Laurels at Jacaranda complex in Plantation.\nIn 2021, Cardone bought a four-property portfolio with 1,688 apartments in Broward County\u2019s Fort Lauderdale, Sunrise and Weston for\n$744 million\n, or $441,000 per apartment.\nLet\u2019s circle back\nTA Realty bought a Palm Beach Gardens complex it previously owned.\nThe Boston-based firm paid\n$193 million\nfor the 476-unit San Merano at Mirasol Apartments, consisting of 31 two-story buildings on a 31-acre site at 100 Portofino Drive, in October. TA Realty assumed the existing $108.5 million Freddie Mac loan on the property from the seller, New York-based Blackstone.\nThe purchase price equated to $405,462 per apartment.\nDeveloper Kolter completed San Merano at Mirasol in 2002 and 2003, selling it to TA Realty in 2010 for $69.1 million, according to records. TA Realty sold it to Blackstone in 2017 for $103.6 million.\nTA is led by managing partners James Buckingham, Michael Haggerty and James Raisides.\nFavo\u2019s all-stock, liabilities assumption deal in Hollywood\nPrivate credit firm Favo Capital bought the 1818 Park apartment tower facing Young Circle in Hollywood for\n$190 million\n.\nLauderhill-based Favo, led by Vincent Napolitano, purchased the 22-story, 277-unit building at\u00a0 1818 Hollywood Boulevard in an all-stock and assumption of liabilities deal in August.\nSeller GCF Development, which completed 1818 Park in 2022, received a long-term equity stake in Favo as part of the deal. Hollywood-based GCF Development is led by Charles \u201cChip\u201d Abele.\nThe purchase price broke down to $696,000 per unit.\nDermot Company cashes out of Boynton Beach complex\nInvestment manager IMT Capital bought a 456-unit apartment complex in Boynton Beach for $183.5 million.\nNew York-based Dermot Company sold the apartment complex and townhome rental community at 3501 and 3373 North Federal Highway to Sherman Oaks, California-based IMT Capital. The deal, which closed last month, included a 1.4-acre vacant site at 3456 and 3466 Old Dixie Highway, between the townhome community and apartment community.\nThe purchase broke down to $402,400 per unit.\nIMT Capital took out a $119.3 million Fannie Mae loan for the purchase. Andrew Wizenberg is managing director at IMT Capital.\nPreviously called The Seabourn, the complex was renamed IMT Gulfstream.\nDermot, led by Stephen Benjamin, paid\n$143 million\nfor the property in 2021.\nBillionaire Zara founder invests in Fort Lauderdale\nSpanish billionaire Amancio Ortega bought the 259-unit Veneto Las Olas apartment tower in downtown Fort Lauderdale for\n$165 million\n. The deal was part of Ortega\u2019s global shopping spree this year.\nOrtega, through his family office Ponte Gadea, purchased the 44-story Veneto at 201 South Federal Highway in June. The seller, the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group, completed development of the tower last year.\nThe deal equated to $637,100 per unit.\nOrtega\n, best known as the founder of fast fashion retailers Zara and Bershka, for decades has been investing dividends from his Inditex clothing empire into all-cash real estate purchases. His shopping spree this year coincided with hefty dividends from his retail businesses, meaning his property investments shielded some of his earnings from Spain\u2019s high wealth tax.\nAlso this year in South Florida, Ortega paid\n$274.4 million\nfor the 30-story Sabadell Financial Center office tower in Miami\u2019s Brickell, and about\n$110 million\nfor the Atlas Plaza retail property in the Miami Design District.\nPantzer family invests in Miramar\nPantzer Properties paid\n$161 million\nfor a 393-unit apartment building in Miramar last month, shortly after the New York-based family owned firm closed its $1 billion Panco Strategic Real Estate Fund VI that will target multifamily properties on the East Coast.\nPanzter paid $409,700 per unit for the eight-story building at 1-3 Main Street, and borrowed a\u00a0 $102.4 million Fannie Mae loan for the purchase. Pantzer renamed the building The Point at Miramar.\nThe sellers, Boston-based Rockpoint and the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Coconut Grove-based Related Group, completed the building last year.\nChurch\u2019s investment arm picks up Boca Raton complex\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints picked up a Boca Raton complex for\n$152.5 million\n.\nIn August, Property Reserve, which invests the church\u2019s reserve funds in commercial real estate, bought the 384-unit Del Ola at 7801 North Federal Highway from New York-based Clarion Partners. The purchase broke down to $397,000 per apartment.\nIt marks at least the fourth real estate purchase by Property Reserve in South Florida since 2023. Led by Ashley Powell, Property Reserve owns the 1.3 million-square-foot Beacon Logistics Park in Hialeah, after buying it in several deals. It also owns the 315-unit Ellsworth apartment building in Plantation and the 284-unit Elan Polo Gardens in unincorporated Palm Beach County.\nThe deal activity comes as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has faced criticism in past years over its massive real estate holdings, construction of grandiose temples and opaque financials, partly allowed by limited public disclosure requirements.\nTA Realty kicked off year in Pembroke Pines\nIn January, TA Realty paid\n$118 million\nfor the Pines West apartment complex in Pembroke Pines.\nThe purchase of the 300-unit property at 16700 Sheridan Street broke down to $393,300 per apartment. Greensboro, North Carolina-based Bell Partners sold Pines West, after it had paid\n$91.8 million\nfor the complex in 2018.\nWest Shore invests in Palm Beach Gardens\nBoston-based West Shore picked up a 542-unit apartment complex in Palm Beach Gardens for\n$117.9 million\nlast month, or $217,500 per apartment.\nWest Shore bought Palm Beach Gardens Apartments at 4120 Union Square Boulevard from Aventura-based Advenir. Completed in 1970 and 1971, the complex consists of 34 two-story rental buildings on 21.5 acres.\nAdvenir paid\n$97.3 million\nfor the property in 2018.\nRelated Fund Management buys in Delray Beach\nRelated Fund Management, the investment management arm of New York-based Related Companies, bought a 292-unit complex in Delray Beach for\n$116.9 million\n, or $400,000 per apartment.\nDallas-based Trinsic Residential Group sold the Mira Delray complex at 2095 West Atlantic Avenue to Related Fund Management in August. The buyer took out a $59.1 million Freddie Mac loan for the purchase.\nTrinsic completed development of the complex in 2023.\nSource(s): TRD analysis of deals submitted by Colliers and CoStar.\n",

        "content": "A sprawling estate in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove asking $135 million secured a buyer, adding to a string of big residential deals inked at the end of the year.\nBanyan Ridge, a 4.5-acre waterfront compound at 3585 Anchorage Way, is pending on the Multiple Listing Service as of Thursday. It\u2019s listed with Danny Hertzberg, Jill Hertzberg, Nathan and Judy Zeder of the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker.\nThe trade could set a record for Miami home sales.\nThe property includes a 1920s Mediterranean-style house that was built for former Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan. That house spans 4,100 square feet and includes three bedrooms, according to listing information. The property also has a 5,300-square-foot, four-bedroom home that was built for the late Peter B. Lewis, the former chairman and CEO of Progressive Insurance Company.\nThe seller is the estate of Lewis\u2019 son, the late Jonathan Lewis, who was a prominent Miami restaurateur and LGBT advocate. Jonathan helped open the Grand Bay Hotel in Coconut Grove, and he owned the restaurants Toby\u2019s and Cafe Tu Tu Tango, according to his\nobituary\n. He died in 2023.\nThe compound hit the market in November, but it had\nbeen listed before\nwith Douglas Elliman agents Lourdes Alatriste and Holly Parker.\nThe property sits on a limestone bluff that\u2019s 17 feet above Biscayne Bay, and it includes a dock with a boat lift, a boat house, a pool house, sauna, spa and tropical landscaping. A 100-year-old Banyan Tree surrounds the pool.\nThe sale will likely surpass billionaire businessman Jorge Mas\u2019 sale of a waterfront 7.3-acre lot that\u2019s also in Coconut Grove to a hidden buyer for\nmore than $100 million\n. That off-market trade has not yet been recorded with Miami-Dade County, and the buyer is unknown.\nIn a separate deal, Mas also recently sold his nearby Coral Gables mansion to a land trust for\n$32 million\n.\n",

        "content": "A judge on Thursday cleared the way for Miami Dade College to hand over a valuable downtown Miami site for use as Donald Trump\u2019s presidential library, dismissing a lawsuit that accused the school of violating state transparency laws.\nThe ruling by Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Mavel Ruiz lifts a temporary injunction blocking the college from transferring a parking lot at\n500-540 Biscayne Boulevard\n\u2013 adjacent to the historic Freedom Tower \u2013 to the state, the\nMiami Herald\nreported.\nState officials plan to turn over the site to the nonprofit foundation run by Trump family members to build the planned $950 million project which would entail a high-rise mixed-use complex.\nMiami historian and activist Dr. Marvin Dunn sued Miami Dade College to stop the transfer, alleging the school\u2019s board of trustees violated Florida\u2019s public records and public meetings laws when it first voted to hand over the site in September.\nEarlier this month, the board held a redo vote during a packed public hearing in\nHialeah\n, in which dozens of speakers objected to the giveaway. The outcome was the same: a\nunanimous vote\nto transfer the land to a state board composed of Gov.\nRon DeSantis\nand Florida\u2019s cabinet members, all of whom are Republicans.\nRuiz determined that the college\u2019s second vote met the requirements of Florida\u2019s Sunshine Law, curing the alleged transparency issues that tainted the initial approval.\nDunn alleged trustees failed to properly inform the public before their first vote, which occurred during a special meeting with little discussion or disclosure about the property.\nRuiz\ninitially sided with Dunn, halting the deal and setting an August trial date.\nThe foundation leading the fundraising efforts plans to raise an estimated $950 million over the next three years while Trump is still in office, according to filings with the Internal Revenue Service. Major donors that pledged to the effort this year include ABC News at $15 million, CBS News at nearly $16 million and Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta at $22 million.\nThe foundation has already spent $400,000 paying its directors and trustees: the president\u2019s son Eric Trump of the Trump Organization; Michael Boulous, the husband of the president\u2019s daughter Tiffany Trump; and James Kiley, an attorney for the president.",

        "content": "What began as a gripe over mishandled packages inside a 1960s-era waterfront Miami Beach condo has mushroomed into a federal civil-rights battle over building safety, landlord responsibility and disability protections. Also caught up in the kerfuffle: a Labrador-mix service dog named Ella.\nIn a Nov. 26 complaint filed in Miami federal court, ex-tenants Julio Rumbaut and his daughter Sarah Rumbaut accuse their former landlords and management at Imperial House of retaliation, constructive eviction and violating federal fair housing and disabilities laws.\nBuilt in 1963, Imperial House rises 15 stories with 127 units at 5255 Collins Avenue. In 2023, Camilo Miguel\u2019s Miami-based Mast Capital sought to buy out all the owners at\nImperial House\n.\nThe defendants are Guarav Butani and Sumant Mehta, principals of the entity that owns the 14th floor Imperial House unit the Rumbauts leased; Imperial House property manager Genovev Mendoza and her employer\nFirstService Residential Florida\n; the condo association; and a contractor that performed work in the unit.\nRumbaut is representing himself and his daughter. Kylie Rae Werk, the attorney representing Mendoza, FirstService and the condo association did not respond to requests for comment. Butani and Mehta also did not respond to requests for comment.\nGrocery Delivery Snafu\nThe trouble started when Julio Rumbaut accused Mendoza of providing false information about a mishandled grocery delivery that caused his frozen food to spoil, according to the lawsuit. Mendoza allegedly \u201cbecame hostile and defensive,\u201d blaming another employee and labeled him as \u201cdifficult.\u201d\nWhen Rumbaut complained to her corporate supervisors, Mendoza allegedly became \u201cunforgiving,\u201d turning an administrative misunderstanding into a pattern of hostility and retaliation, the complaint alleges.\nMendoza also allegedly supported and praised a front-desk employee who \u201crepeatedly interrogated Sarah Rumbaut about her unit number despite months of residency and daily familiarity,\u201d the complaint states.\nThe discord allegedly intensified amid a separate set of problems related to Miami-Dade County\u2019s 60-year structural recertification of Imperial House \u2014 one of many midcentury coastal condominiums\nundergoing safety upgrades\nin the wake of the\nChamplain Towers South collapse\nin 2021.\nConstruction Dust Forces Tenants Out\nEarlier this year, Butani and Mehta\u2019s entity hired Contracting Specialists South East to perform interior work linked to recertification, the lawsuit states. The landlords pressed Mendoza to speed things along, and she \u201centhusiastically\u201d urged the contractor to begin demolition and drilling work while the unit was occupied by the Rumbauts, the complaint alleges.\nThe two-bedroom unit was blanketed in dust and debris, creating unsafe breathing conditions that endangered their health, the Rumbauts allege in their court filings. Medical records attached to the complaint claim Sarah Rumbaut suffered respiratory symptoms tied to the construction. The family ultimately vacated the condo in April, a move that the Rumbauts allege amounted to constructive eviction \u2014 a forced departure due to untenable living conditions.\nService Dog Allegations\nJulio Rumbaut also accuses Mendoza of engaging in a retaliatory campaign against him, including violating federal housing and disability laws by discriminating against his service dog, Ella. The lawsuit alleges that Mendoza exaggerated minor incidents involving the animal and sowed conflict over accommodation rules.\nFor instance, Mendoza allegedly forced Julio Rumbaut to use a freight elevator whenever he walked Ella, and attempted to have the canine removed from the property.\nRumbaut alleges these acts formed a separate pattern of discriminatory interference prohibited by federal laws.\n\u201cIn our case, that meant dealing with interference around a service dog and unsafe construction while my daughter\u2019s health was being impacted,\u201d Julio Rumbaut said. \u201cThe bigger issue is how Florida condominium boards, management companies and insurers make sure these situations don\u2019t happen to other residents.\u201d",

        "content": "Two years after snapping up a distressed Loop office tower in an all-cash deal, an Oregon investor pulled off a financing maneuver that all but disappeared from the downtown Chicago office market: a loan equal to the full purchase price.\nPortland-based Menashe Properties secured a $45 million loan from Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Management\u2019s bank lending group on the 29-story tower at 230 West Monroe Street, CoStar\nreported\n. The loan matches exactly what\nMenashe\npaid for the building in September 2023, when it bought the property outright and ended a more than yearlong drought in major downtown office sales.\nFull-value financing is rare in today\u2019s office market and suggests the building\u2019s value has rebounded sharply since Menashe bought it at a steep discount, according to the publication. The tower last traded in 2014 for $122 million, a reminder of how far pricing fell during the pandemic-era collapse.\nThe deal stands out nationally after years of plunging office valuations driven by remote work, higher interest rates and corporate downsizing. Menashe Properties CEO Jordan Menashe said the market has quietly begun to shift, as\nobsolete buildings\nare converted to other uses and new office construction has ground to a halt.\nMenashe told the outlet that the firm was \u201cblessed\u201d by its timing of the 2023 purchase, landing at or near the bottom of office market values.\nChicago\nhas already seen a handful of high-profile refinancings that hint at a bifurcated recovery. Trophy assets like the\nOld Post Office\n, Salesforce Tower and Bank of America Tower have all landed massive commercial mortgage-backed securities loans, even as older, vacancy-plagued buildings continue to trade at prices that fail to cover their debt.\nThe loan for the building at 230 West Monroe closed in October, according to Cook County property records, more than two years after Menashe bought the building without acquisition debt because lenders had largely abandoned the sector.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Boeing officially cashed out of its former Chicago headquarters, selling the 36-story tower along the Chicago River for $22 million, marking another step in the firm\u2019s slow retreat from the city.\nThe aerospace giant sold its leasehold interest in the building at 100 North Riverside Plaza late last month to a joint venture of New York-based Stahl Organization and Houston developer Hines, according to property records and people familiar with the deal, CoStar\nreported\n.\nThe Real Deal\nreported in November that\nHines\nwas in talks to buy the property, though Stahl\u2019s role as a partner was not clear at the time.\nSterling Bay\npreviously had the tower under contract over the summer, reportedly for $25 million to $30 million. That would have been $32 per square foot to $39 per square foot for the 777,400-square-foot building.\nThat deal collapsed, however. A Sterling Bay spokesperson said in a statement to\nTRD\nin November that the firm\u2019s due diligence \u201cdid not support advancing a transaction in the current market conditions.\u201d\nThe Hines-Stahl deal lands the sale at closer to $28 per square foot.\nThe modest price tag reflects the deal\u2019s structure, because it was the leasehold, not the land beneath the tower that changed hands.\nStahl\nalready owns the underlying property and controls it through a 99-year ground lease that runs through 2084. With Stahl now part-owner of the building itself, the complicated ownership structure could eventually be simplified by eliminating the ground lease altogether.\nAs part of the deal, Boeing will lease back about 70,440 square feet across floors 27 through 29, according to property records. The lease runs from September 2026 through August 2032, with options to extend for up to another decade. Boeing, Stahl and Hines declined to comment to CoStar. Cushman &amp; Wakefield brokers Jeff Cole, Cody Hundertmark and Tom Sitz represented Boeing.\nStahl recently refinanced its land ownership beneath the building with a $40 million loan maturing in 2031, Cook County records show.\nHines is a familiar name along the river, having developed nearby River Point and Salesforce Tower. The firm has been on the hunt for large tenants to fill vacancies at 100 North Riverside, a nearly 30-year-old building that needs capital and leasing momentum, but benefits from a prime location in a market short on newer riverfront offices.\nBoeing\nrelocated\nits headquarters from Seattle to Chicago in 2001, later buying the building for $165.2 million in 2005. In 2022, Boeing moved its corporate address to Arlington, Virginia, and said it had about 400 employees remaining in Chicago.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "One of the world\u2019s largest insurance brokerages is zigging while much of corporate America zags, opting to split its Chicago office between two downtown sites rather than consolidating into a single hub.\nAlliant Insurance Services signed a lease for just under 27,000 square feet \u2014 a full floor \u2014 at\n360 North Green Street\nin Fulton Market, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n, according to people familiar with the deal. At the same time, the Irvine, California-based firm is in late-stage talks to lease roughly 18,000 square feet closer to the Loop. Space on or near Wacker Drive is said to be under consideration.\nThe move would break up Alliant\u2019s current Chicago space of about 52,000 square feet, which it subleases from Mesirow Financial at\n353 North Clark Street\nin River North. Once the new leases are finalized, Alliant plans to divide its local workforce between the two offices.\nThat strategy runs counter to a dominant post-pandemic theme in the office market. As remote and hybrid work hollowed out demand, many companies have sought to centralize operations into a single location to cut costs and encourage in-person collaboration.\nA spokesperson for Alliant did not respond to requests for comment from the outlet, but sources said one of the firm\u2019s business units will be based in the Fulton Market office, where rents typically command a premium. Another segment, targeting a different client base, is expected to land in less expensive space near the Loop.\nThe Fulton Market lease is a win for\nSterling Bay\n, the developer of the 24-story, roughly 500,000-square-foot building at 360 North Green. Completed last year, the tower has quickly become a magnet for professional services firms migrating from more traditional downtown addresses. Boston Consulting Group and law firm Greenberg Traurig are among the building\u2019s tenants, marking an early wave of white collar firms following tech companies into the former meatpacking district.\nAlliant appears to be the first major insurance brokerage to establish a foothold in the Fulton Market corridor. Prior to the deal, the Green Street building was about 79 percent leased, according to CoStar.\nAlliant\u2019s Chicago presence dates back to its 2016 acquisition of\nMesirow\u2019s\ninsurance business. It also maintains offices in Bannockburn and Oak Brook.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The seller is Xiaogang Fan, a real estate agent based in Richardson. The sale price was not disclosed.\nThe 19-suite property built in 1985 sits on 4.4 acres and includes three buildings. The property also features a 0.7-acre pad that could be developed, the release said. The property is fully occupied and is home to a Subway and a My Eye Doctor office. Campbell Junction is about 17 miles northeast of downtown Dallas.\nThe property \u201cmay be a candidate for partial redevelopment or mixed-use conversion,\u201d Marcus and Millichap\u2019s Philip Levy said in the release. He marketed the listing.\nWarnings of the death of retail after the Great Financial Crisis scared developers away from building new retail properties over the last decade. But e-commerce didn\u2019t kill retail as everyone expected, and the pandemic left people craving in-person experiences.\nAs a result, retail real estate \u2014 especially in a high growth market like Dallas-Fort Worth \u2014 has proven to be a popular investment, as space is limited from lack of new development and rents are high.\nIn Dallas-Fort Worth, retail rents are up from a year ago, increasing from $19.78 per square foot to $20.28 per square foot, according to Partners Real Estate. Vacancy rates are stable at 4.8 percent.\nThe market\u2019s stability means the region was able to weather the\nclosure of big-box retailers, like Party City\nand Tuesday Morning. The empty space has been quickly gobbled up by\nexperiential users like fitness centers\nand pickleball facilities. Even bookseller\nBarnes &amp; Noble is having a renaissance\n.\n",

        "content": "The Houston Rockets are lining up another big investment at Toyota Center, planning a full renovation of the arena\u2019s suites as the team continues to modernize its 21-year-old downtown home.\nAll suites at the Toyota Center will be renovated in a project estimated to cost $24.6 million, according to a filing with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. Ryan Walsh, CEO of the Harris County Houston Sports Authority,\nconfirmed\nthe plans to the Houston Business Journal. The Rockets will cover the full cost of the work at 1510 Polk Street.\nConstruction is expected to begin in April 2026 and wrap up in October 2027, the\nTDLR filing shows\n, though timelines in such filings are often subject to revision.\nFrom a real estate and venue-operations perspective, the suite project is a prime example of how professional sports teams are investing in premium spaces that drive revenue. The outlet reported that corporate suites and high-end hospitality areas have become a focal point, as teams look to compete for sponsors and affluent fans while keeping older arenas relevant in a market crowded with newer venues.\nThe suite renovation is the latest in a string of team-funded upgrades at\nToyota Center\n. Most recently, the\nRockets\nkicked off a $10.5 million project to replace all 17,000 bowl seats in the arena. The new seats will feature black sports-weave material, replacing the venue\u2019s longstanding red color scheme, without reducing capacity. That project is expected to be completed by July 2026.\nThe team has also wrapped up a $7.5 million roof replacement, addressing another major building system that dated back to the arena\u2019s 2003 opening. In addition, the Rockets spent $22 million to install new LED ribbon boards, and a center-hung scoreboard that was unveiled at the start of the 2024 season. The 6,200-square-foot display increased LED surface area by 84 percent and added four underbelly screens, further pushing\nToyota Center\ntoward a more immersive, tech-forward experience.\nOther recent additions include the Sire Spirits Social Club, which debuted during the 2022-23 season and reflects the broader shift toward\nexperiential and branded\nspaces inside sports venues.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A Nussbaum Lowinger creditor is going after the dissolved firm\u2019s lesser-known partner, Samuel Lowinger.\nLakewood-based Blueberry Funding has filed a lawsuit in Kings County seeking to hold Lowinger responsible for $58.7 million in missing escrow funds. The lawsuit puts the focus on the other half of the now-defunct Nussbaum Lowinger, a Manhattan-based law firm at the center of an escrow fraud scandal where former clients allege they are owed over $400 million.\nThus far, much of the legal ire has been directed at Mark Nussbaum, the better-known and majority partner at the firm. But Blueberry is placing blame on Lowinger, alleging he breached his fiduciary duty to ensure the funds were held in the designated escrow account. Blueberry further alleges Lowinger knew or should have known that distributions were being made from the escrow account and the fund was being depleted. Prior to Blueberry\u2019s lawsuit, Lowinger had only been named as a defendant in one other lawsuit. (The claims against Lowinger in that suit were discontinued.)\nThe mystery of Sam Lowinger\nNussbaum was known as the high-rolling point person for the firm\u2019s escrow business. His personal assets included $2 million in crypto and $91,000 in wine and alcohol, according to recent court filings. He had sold over $200,000 in watches and jewelry.\nLowinger appears to keep a lower profile. His Instagram account is filled with the 30-something-year-old attorney playing saxophone solos. About a month after Nussbaum Lowinger\u2019s closure, Lowinger landed a new job as an associate general counsel at a family office, according to his LinkedIn,\nThe Promote\nreported.\nHe has largely remained quiet since the firm\u2019s collapse, claiming that Nussbaum left him in the dark about the firm\u2019s escrow business and was the only one with viewing access, according to court filings.\nLowinger\u2019s attorney, Rick Supple, said his client had nothing to do with the escrow agreement that Blueberry allegedly made with Nussbaum.\n\u201cIn fact, as plaintiff also knows, once it became known to Mr. Lowinger that the firm\u2019s escrow account may have been infected by improper conduct, he took immediate action to protect all stakeholders,\u201d said Supple. \u201cMr. Lowinger looks forward to addressing and putting to rest Blueberry\u2019s false claims.\u201d\nWhile Lowinger has tried to distance himself from the firm\u2019s collapse and its escrow business, he was closely involved with the transaction side of the business, according to sources and documents reviewed by\nTRD\n. These new details shed light on Lowinger\u2019s role in the embattled firm, which has until now been opaque.\nNussbaum Lowinger\u2019s real estate clients had courted controversy, some of whom have been targets of the Department of Justice\u2019s mortgage fraud probe. Notably, Nussbaum Lowinger was listed as the counsel to Moshe Silber\u2019s Rhodium Capital. (Silber pleaded guilty last year to his role in a mortgage fraud scheme.)\nA voice memo and an email reviewed by\nTRD\nbetween 2022 and 2023 show that Lowinger had extensive dealings with the title insurer Riverside Abstract, which is currently blacklisted by Fannie Mae for acting as the title insurer on a fraudulent transaction in Troy, Michigan. One communication shows Lowinger voicing frustration with Riverside Abstract\u2019s CEO Shaul Greenwald over undisclosed fees that appeared to hold up the closing of a deal with Shaya Prager.\n(Riverside Abstract has not been accused of any wrongdoing. There is no indication Lowinger\u2019s communications involve the Troy deal.)\nIn a March 2022 email, Lowinger wrote to Greenwald expressing his frustration with the title insurer for allegedly imposing last-minute fees on clients on time-of-the-essence deals.\n\u201cThis can\u2019t continue. If you value our relationship and team approach (and you indicated as much when you came down to our office), then there needs to be more transparency. This consistently gets in the way of TOE closings. In time of need, I feel your employees spending more time on settling your accounts rather than doing the title work we have entrusted them with.\u201d\nIn a terse voice recording dated March 2023, Lowinger again voices concern about not having visibility into Riverside\u2019s fees.\n\u201cI can\u2019t have it happen on every deal. I just can\u2019t,\u201d he said.\nGreenwald did not return a request to comment.\nMark Nussbaum has been charged by the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office with grand larceny over allegations he stole $15 million of escrow funds. Nussbaum has pleaded not guilty.\nBlueberry, an alternative lender, is one of the largest creditors of Nussbaum Lowinger. Nussbaum appointed a trustee to handle the claims and take Nussbaum Lowinger through an alternative to bankruptcy known as an assignment for the benefit of creditors.\nThe trustee recently alleged over $300 million of Nussbaum Lowinger\u2019s client money allegedly went to the late Mendel Steiner, a 33-year old Borough Park-based real estate investor, according to a recent lawsuit. A lawsuit brought by the trustee handling the liquidation alleges Steiner diverted that money through phony escrow accounts. Blueberry alleges funds were supposed to be held in the Nussbaum Lowinger escrow account. But the firm failed to return the funds after Steiner died in January.\n",

        "content": "A\nlegal row\nbrought by Douglas Elliman\u2019s former Newport Beach sales manager against the brokerage and one of its former executives is coming to a close.\nAn attorney for former Newport Beach office Executive Manager of Sales Christina Carrillo asked a Los Angeles Superior Court judge last week to dismiss her lawsuit against Elliman of California and Elliman of California Financial, along with the brokerage\u2019s former Western region CEO Stephen Kotler, after they reached a settlement.\nCarrillo brought her\nlawsuit\nagainst the brokerage and Kotler last October, alleging sexual harassment, retaliation and wrongful termination, among other complaints. She filed her suit after resigning that same month.\nThe request for dismissal with prejudice closes the door on any possibility of the same claim being filed again.\nWrapped up in Carrillo\u2019s lawsuit were allegations against Elliman\u2019s Altman Brothers Team, led by brothers Josh and Matt Altman, that accused the agents of soliciting clients from other agents\u2019 and brokers\u2019 active listings. The Altmans were never named as defendants in the lawsuit.\nCarrillo\u2019s allegations against the high-producing team were tied to a claim in her lawsuit that Kotler was dismissive of her concerns, while also accusing the executive of repeatedly telling her to use her \u201csex appeal\u201d to gain more brokerage clients.\nCourt documents for a post-mediation conference on Dec. 1 refer to the case as settled, voiding the jury trial originally scheduled to begin in May. Details of the settlement were not made public.\nCarrillo and an Elliman spokesperson declined to comment.\n\u201cI made no admission of wrongdoing as part of the settlement and I made no personal settlement payment to Ms. Carrillo as part of the settlement,\u201d Kotler said in a statement provided to\nThe Real Deal\n.\nKotler\nstepped down\nas Elliman\u2019s Western region CEO in February to join his son, Max Kotler and brother Michael Kotler on the New York City-based Kotler Team. He\nleft the firm\nin May, ending a 34-year career at Elliman.\nLegal woes\nCarrillo\u2019s lawsuit followed a complaint also filed in October 2024 by former Portfolio Escrow President\nWilliam Grasska\nagainst Elliman and other escrow officers and brokerage executives.\nPortfolio Escrow is the firm Grasska founded and sold to Elliman in 2020. He sued for retaliation, breach of contract, negligence and defamation.\nElliman shot back at Grasska that same month, accusing him of breach of contract, embezzlement, misappropriation of trade secrets and other complaints in a lawsuit of its own. The brokerage alleged Grasska had been working with what was described as a \u201chigh-profile Los Angeles real estate broker\u201d on reality TV in a kickbacks scheme. The unnamed broker\nreportedly\nturned out to be \u201cSelling Sunset\u201d star\nJason Oppenheim\n.\nGrasska and the brokerage settled in December 2024 on undisclosed terms.\n\u201cAny differences between Douglas Elliman, Portfolio Escrow and I have been resolved,\u201d Grasska told\nTRD\nat the time.\n",

        "content": "The longtime Southwest Michigan getaway of Lee Daniels, a former Illinois House Speaker and one of the state\u2019s most influential Republican leaders of the last half-century, sold for just under $7 million.\nDaniels and his wife, Pamela, closed Tuesday on the sale of their five-bedroom, roughly 5,000-square-foot lakefront home at 11869 Marquette Drive in New Buffalo,\naccording\nto Crain\u2019s. The deal wrapped up exactly two months after the property hit the\nmarket\n, a quick turn for a luxury listing heading into winter in a market that typically cools after summer.\nThe sellers also appear to have timed their exit well. Just months earlier, the Daniels had tested the waters at $6.75 million before removing the listing temporarily, about $250,000 less than the price they ultimately achieved.\nThe house sits on a wooded lot along\nMarquette Drive\n, a narrow strip of homes between Lake Michigan and the Galien River. Agents for the buyers said privacy, panoramic lake views and a cabana built midway down the dune to the beach helped seal the deal, along with a glass heavy lake-facing side that blurs the line between indoors and out. The property is also a short walk from Whittaker Street\u2019s restaurants and shops, offering seclusion without isolation.\nThe buyer\u2019s identity has not yet surfaced in Berrien County records, and it\u2019s unclear whether the buyer hails from the Chicago area, roughly 70 miles away.\nThe sale fits neatly into a broader pattern.\nNew Buffalo\nand nearby Union Pier have seen a string of multimillion-dollar listings snap up this year, with several homes at about $6 million quickly going under contract, and at least one Union Pier lakefront deal closing above asking price. Even as winter approaches, agents say calls from would-be buyers keep coming.\nAn inland home on Prospect Drive overlooking the Galien River \u2014 a green-roofed retreat owned by Mal\u00f6rt-maker\nTremaine Atkinson\n\u2014 listed at about $6 million in late August and was under contract within two weeks. A lakefront property a few doors down, also on Marquette Drive, listed at just below $7 million and went under contract in three days.\nDaniels spent 32 years in the Illinois House, serving as minority leader for nearly two decades and as speaker in the mid-1990s, before leaving Springfield in 2007. Records show he and his wife have owned the New Buffalo property since at least 2015, holding it in a trust, though the original purchase price is unclear.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "AvalonBay Communities\nis trimming its San Francisco holdings with the sale of twin apartment towers near Golden Gate Park.\nBridge Capital Partners is under contract to buy the Sunset Towers residences at 6-8 Locksley Avenue for an undisclosed price, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. AvalonBay listed the 243-unit property earlier this year and was reportedly\nfielding bids north of $100 million\n. The deal for the multifamily complex is expected to close in January.\nThe sale serves as evidence of a citywide rebound in the apartment market as demand for units rises. Multifamily investment volume is up more than 35 percent year-over-year, and absorption has returned to 2022 levels, per Avison Young data cited by the Business Times.\nBecause San Francisco is seeing few new market-rate projects across the city, investors have been focusing on existing properties in supply-constrained neighborhoods, such as the Inner Sunset where Sunset Towers is located. More than\n20,000 units\nin San Francisco are in a holding pattern as projects face years of delays or collapse entirely. Last year, only 1,453 residential units were completed and plans were filed for 2,541 new homes, down from more than 5,000 delivered in 2020,\naccording\nto the San Francisco Planning Department.\nBoth demand and rents have been increasing in San Francisco \u2014 a trend that AvalonBay COO Sean Breslin attributes to a surge in tech workers moving to San Francisco as the artificial intelligence sector booms.\n\u201cAI is certainly a big part of that,\u201d Breslin said in May of the\nupward pricing momentum\n. AvalonBay president and CEO Benjamin Schall told investors in September that sales across its portfolio could increase as rents and property values increase. On the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings call, AvalonBay executives reaffirmed that demand in coastal markets like San Francisco is driven by highly educated, higher-paid workers in AI and related fields.\nAvalonBay owns nearly 3,400 apartments in San Francisco with a total value of about $1.2 billion.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Steve Ross, the billionaire focused on turning West Palm Beach into a financial and tech business mecca, scored a record $772 million construction financing package for two office projects.\nThe deal is the biggest known construction loan ever in South Florida, and likely statewide. It comes amid looming questions about the long-term health and success of the tri-county region\u2019s office market.\nRoss, through his Related Ross, is developing the 23-story 10 CityPlace and 26-story 15 CityPlace on a portion of the CityPlace mixed-use retail complex in downtown West Palm. Ares Real Estate funds, part of Los Angeles-based Ares Management, led the lenders providing the financing package, according to a Related Ross news release.\nOthers partnering on the projects\u2019 financing package are Monarch Alternative Capital and HPS Investment Partners, Related Ross\u2019 Jordan Rathlev said in the release.\n10 and 15 CityPlace\nare emblematic of Ross\u2019 investment in West Palm, where he is the king of offices and has about a dozen buildings, including those purchased, developed, under construction and planned.\nAlthough the influx of new-to-market companies to South Florida has calmed compared with the pandemic-induced boom, raising doubts about pre-leasing success of many of the planned offices across the region, Ross isolated his West Palm investments from the slowdown largely by tapping his New York network to secure tenants.\nLast year,\nRoss\n, 85, stepped back from the New York-based Related Companies, which he founded over 50 years ago, to start his West Palm-based Related Ross. The firm primarily focuses on West Palm, where aside from offices, it also has apartment and condo projects, as well as investments in the rest of Palm Beach County and South Florida.\nRoss is nonexecutive chairman of Related Companies and its single biggest shareholder.\nThe 470,000-square-foot 10 CityPlace was designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox, and the 490,000-square-foot 15 CityPlace was designed by Arquitectonica, with interiors by Fogerty Finger. Construction of the towers started in March and completion is expected in 2027.\nThe buildings are under construction roughly on the northeast corner of South Rosemary Avenue and Hibiscus Street, replacing a former AMC theater and restaurant space. Ross, through his Related Companies, completed the CityPlace complex in 2000 as his first project in West Palm.\nCloud computing firm\nServiceNow\n, which helps businesses automate tasks by using AI, will be an anchor tenant at 10 CityPlace. The firm is expected to establish an innovation hub and AI institute in West Palm, which aligns with Ross\u2019 push to make the city into a tech hub.\nCleveland Clinic\nwill anchor 15 CityPlace with a 120,000-square-foot outpatient center that will offer chemotherapy, imaging, outpatient surgery and a concierge medicine program. The facility will be connected to Cleveland Clinic\u2019s planned 150-bed hospital campus nearby that will have an emergency department, an ambulatory surgery center and a medical office building.\nOthers pre-leasing at 15 CityPlace include assurance, tax and advisory services firm\nBDO\n, law firm Shutts &amp; Bowen and private investment firm Inclenberg Investments.\nRoss\u2019 other West Palm office projects include the 25-story\nOne Flagler\n, completed this year at the foot of the Royal Park bridge, and the 25-story 515 Fern, under development on the northwest corner of Fern Street and the Florida East Coast Railway tracks.\nIn other massive South Florida loans, Whitman Family Development scored\n$740 million\nlast year to refinance a $550 million debt on the luxury Bal Harbour Shops and finance a planned 250,000-square-foot expansion of the retail center.\nLast month, Dezer Development landed a\n$630 million\nconstruction loan for the oceanfront\u00a0 61-story, 216-unit Bentley Residences condo tower at tower 18401 Collins Avenue in Sunny Isles Beach. Yamal Yidios\u2019 Ytech landed\n$565 million\nin financing last month for the 70-story, 195-unit The Residences at 1428 Brickell condo tower in Miami.\n",

        "content": "Developers David Martin and the Frisbie Group are one step closer to getting their controversial One Boca mixed-use project off the ground.\nOn Thursday, the Boca Raton Planning and Zoning Board backed a 99-year lease that will enable Martin\u2019s Terra and Palm Beach-based Frisbie Group to build One Boca, a massive project with 947 residential units, a hotel, and other commercial uses on and near 7.8 acres of city-owned land by the Brightline train station.\nThe 7 to 0 planning board vote means that the Boca Raton City Council will now have a positive recommendation when the proposed development agreement comes before the elected body on Jan. 6 for first reading. Should the deal be fully approved by council members, the lease agreement will be put before the city\u2019s voters for final ratification on March 10.\nUnder current plans, Frisbie Group, led by Rob Frisbie Jr. and Cody Crowell, and Terra will build 765 apartments, 180 hotel rooms, 120,000 square feet of office, a 30,000-square-foot grocery store, and 2,100 parking spaces on city land north of Palmetto Park Road, east of Northwest Second Avenue, south of Northwest Fourth Street, and west of Northwest First Avenue, according to a city memo. The apartments, which would be built where the Boca Raton Police Station now stands at 101 Northwest Boca Raton Boulevard, would include 77 workforce apartments.\nFrisbie and Terra also want to build a 210,854-square-foot mixed-use project with 182 condo units on private land they\u2019re under contract to buy. The 12,315-square-foot plot of land at 141 Northwest Fourth Street, is owned by Boca Color Graphics, led by Michael A. Massarella.\nThe entire One Boca project would consist of just over 538,000 square feet of new development, which is far smaller than what Terra and Frisbie initially proposed in February after beating out three other contenders, including Related Ross, for the right to redevelop 30 acres of property that included Boca Raton\u2019s deteriorating city hall as well as the city\u2019s 17-acre Memorial Park. Back then Terra and Frisbie proposed a\n2.5-million-square-foot development\nwith 1,129 residential units, 150 hotel rooms, 250,000 square feet of office, 156,690-square-feet of retail and 3,434 parking spaces.\nWhile the size of the project was later reduced, it still generated\nsignificant opposition from residents\nwho formed Save Boca and collected enough signatures\u00a0 for a referendum that would require a special vote prior to any sale or leasing of public land larger than a half-acre. Although\na judge has blocked\na referendum on public land deals in general (a decision that Save Boca is appealing) city council members still agreed to give\nvoters final say\non the One Boca project.\nIn addition, Frisbie and Terra\nscaled\ntheir proposal back further by limiting development to the east side of Northwest Second Avenue. The 17.5 acres on the west side, including Memorial Park will remain for public use and would include a new city hall, community center, recreational facilities, a police substation, and a public parking garage that would be built by Terra and Frisbie, according to a draft of the 99-year lease. Those facilities would be built in exchange for a developer\u2019s fee that would be negotiated later, although Terra and Frisbie did commit to contributing $7.9 million in off-site public improvements.\nIn exchange for building on the east side of Northwest Second Avenue, the developers would pay the city 7 percent of the gross revenues of the residential component, 4 percent of the gross revenues for the retail, office and hotel components each year. Another 10 percent of the revenues will be paid above what the lease calls a \u201cgross revenue hurdle\u201d related to the developers\u2019 costs.\nThe lease also has \u201cstrong default and termination rights for the city,\u201d Deputy City Manager Andrew Lukasik told the board.\nThe developers have claimed that the revenues would generate more than $2 billion in rent, taxes, and more for the city, per their One Boca website. But two critics of the project, who said they were certified accountants, told board members that the city could count on less than $50 million over 99 years.\nBoard members, however, were instructed not to even consider the financial aspects. Instead, they were to focus only on whether a 99-year lease that paves the way for a transit-oriented development would fulfill the city\u2019s comprehensive plan for the downtown area.\n\u201cYou will not be evaluating the leases themselves in terms of economics, nor the criteria used to select its [developer] partner, nor evaluating the [developers\u2019] ability to implement the project,\u201d Lukasik said.\nBoard member Gergory Mitchell admitted he has concerns about the money aspect of the deal and \u201cimplored\u201d city council members to \u201cget the best bang for our buck.\u201d\nBoard member Timothy Dornblaser said it was only logical to encourage development by the Brightline train station while board chairman Arnold Sevell opined that the redevelopment of downtown was \u201clong overdue\u201d in a city that has attracted increased interest from developers.\n\u201cWe have good momentum and I think we should keep it moving,\u201d Sevell said.\nBut Save Boca founder Jon Pearlman said the One Boca project has generated so much opposition that it\u2019s destined to be voted down by residents.\n\u201cWe are in power. We are in control,\u201d Pearlman said at the podium. \u201cThis is just a show, and it is meaningless and we have the ultimate say and vote.\u201d",

        "content": "A waterfront residential highrise in Fort Lauderdale is among the projects developers pitched in a year-end flurry of applications in the city.\nAn entity tied to Camaco Development, led by Josephine Campeau, wants to develop the 36-unit Harbor Beach Residences building on a 0.8-acre site at 3049 and 3043 Harbor Drive, according to a profile application included in the city\u2019s Planning and Zoning Board meeting agenda. It\u2019s unclear if the units will be apartments or condos.\nThe board is expected to vote on the 21-story proposal at its Jan. 21 meeting.\nDesigned by Adache Group Architects and Kora, the building will include a five-story lobby and garage podium and a seventh story amenity deck.\nThe development site consists of two lots, one owned by Coral Gables-based Camaco Development and the other by Karma Executive Homes, which is managed by Rajiv Sharma,\u00a0 according to records.\nFort Lauderdale and Broward County as a whole were largely overlooked during the hefty development and investment activity in South Florida in the immediate years after the pandemic\u2019s onset. But more recently, luxury condo construction has\nboomed\nin the area.\nEdgardo Defortuna\u2019s Fortune International Group and Ricardo Dunin\u2019s Oak Capital are partnering on their planned\nRitz-Carlton Residences, Pompano Beach\nwith a 32-story, 117-unit Beach Tower and a 14-story, 88-unit Marina Tower. The project is at 1380 South Ocean Boulevard in Pompano Beach.\nAlso in Pompano Beach, the\u00a0 P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group and Motwani family\u2019s Merrimac Ventures plan a\nWaldorf Astoria-branded\ncondo development with a 28-story, 92-unit building at 1213 South Ocean Boulevard.\u00a0In Fort Lauderdale, Related also plans the 46-story, 163-unit\nAndare Residences by Pininfarina\nluxury condo at 521 East Las Olas Boulevard. Cymbal DLT, led by Asi Cymbal and Hector Torres, plans the $1.5 billion\nNautico District\nwith more than 1,200 residential units and a 30-story hotel on the New River south of downtown Fort Lauderdale. The residential units will consist of condos in a 37-story tower and apartments in a 30-story tower. The 6-acre Nautico assemblage is at 413 Southwest Third Avenue.\n",

        "content": "With less than two weeks left in office, Mayor Eric Adams made sure to stack the city\u2019s rent board.\nAdams announced the appointment of two new members: Lliam Finn, a senior financial advisor with Merrill Lynch, as a public representative; and Sagar Sharma, an attorney with Legal Services NYC\u2019s housing unit, as a tenant representative.\nHe also reappointed landlord attorney Christina Smyth as an owner representative and Arpit Gupta as a public one.\nIn a statement, Adams said the appointments \u201cwill serve as responsible stewards of our city\u2019s housing stock, using facts and data to reach the right decision for both tenants and property owners.\u201d\nThe move has been viewed as an attempt to sabotage Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani\u2019s campaign pledge to freeze rents for stabilized tenants for four years. The city\u2019s Rent Guidelines Board decides what rent increases are permitted on one- and two-year leases, though mayors have influenced their decisions.\n\u201cIf rents don\u2019t keep up with operating costs, these buildings will soon be in physical decline as well,\u201d Kenny Burgos, CEO of the New York Apartment Association, said in a statement. \u201cWe hope the new RGB members take into account the risk of deterioration and eventual destruction of stabilized housing when they come to a decision next year.\u201d\nTenant groups remained defiant after news of Adams\u2019 appointments.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting our rent freeze,\u201d Sumathy Kumar, managing director of the New York State Tenant Bloc, said in a statement. \u201cOver one million New Yorkers just voted for a mayor who will freeze the rent.\u201d\nRidding the nine-member board of potential Adams loyalists isn\u2019t as simple as Mamdani cleaning house. Under the city\u2019s\nadministrative code\n, a mayor can only remove members of the board before the end of their term with cause, and \u201cnot without an opportunity to be heard in person or by counsel, in his or her defense.\u201d\nStill, the new mayor can appoint some new members as soon as he takes office, and more in his second year. Mamdani will be able to replace four members (the chair, as well as members representing the public, owners and tenants) when he takes office. The other five, all Adams appointees, could be replaced in 2027.\nIn other words, if these members stand in the way of a rent freeze, they can only do so for one year.\nSome of the other public members have been publicly skeptical of the mayor-elect\u2019s rent freeze promise. In a November\nDaily News op-ed\n, public member Alex Schwartz (who was replaced by Finn) called the proposal \u201cmisguided.\u201d\nAlex Armlovich\ntold the New York Times\nin October that Mamdani\u2019s rent freeze proposal could scare investors away. Ahead of his 2022\nappointment\n, Gupta wrote that he was skeptical of rent regulation as a concept.\nEarlier reports indicated that Adams was considering a close ally, Douglas Elliman agent and reality TV star Eleonora Srugo, for the rent board. Srugo\ntold\nThe Real Deal\nthat she had preliminary conversations with a senior administration official, but had other priorities to consider.\n",

The fresh financing replaces a $540 million construction loan from Bank OZK and Carlyle\u2019s Global Credit business as the mixed-use tower transitions to leasing and sales.\nThe 1,000-foot project located near the Empire State Building now stands as the tallest tower on Fifth Avenue in that stretch of Midtown. The property combines 25 floors of offices and 100 luxury condominiums.\nCondo sales\nlaunched in April 2024 and the building\u2019s private club, Moss, opened in November and the offices are open for tenant move-ins.\nThe developer first filed plans in 2021 for the tower at the corner of East 43rd Street and Fifth Avenue, then envisioned as a 70-story building. The proposal called for 98 residential units spread across 16 floors, with most of the remaining stories devoted to office space and a suite of amenities. Those amenities include restaurants, retail space and a solarium.\nKohn Pedersen Fox is the architect on the project.\nCeruzzi Properties and SMI USA acquired the site for $275 million in 2015, laying the groundwork for the development. But in 2017, founder and president\nLou Ceruzzi died suddenly\nat the age of 64, and his company\u2019s portfolio was thrown into turmoil.\nRabina came on board in 2019, bringing in an equity contribution that helped wipe out roughly $232 million in debt tied to the project and becoming the lead developer.\nThe tower is the biggest project in Mickey Rabina\u2019s six-decade career. Rabina is a familiar name among real estate\u2019s top dealmakers \u2014 in part for his reputation as a fix-it guy. When Ceruzzi died, it seemed the project might never get off the ground.\nRabina declined to comment. Carlyle did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n",

Residents say management pressured them to sign new leases that force them to pay for previously included amenities, such as parking, pest control, trash collection, hot water and package delivery.\nThe tenants association members, representing 34 households at the 290 North Hudson Avenue complex, said they have started paying an additional $400 to $500 per month in new fees, as well as rent increases between 8 percent and 20 percent. The residents claim the move is Hines\u2019 way of skirting California\u2019s cap on annual rent increases, generally limited to 10 percent per year.\n\u201cBefore Hines took over ownership and management of the building, housing here was stable and predictable,\u201d eight-year resident Terey Ross said during Wednesday\u2019s press conference, per Pasadena Now. Ross claims tenants were given little notice of the new lease terms and felt cornered into signing the new agreements without enough time to review them. \u201cTenants are not asking for special treatment. We are asking for lawful rental practices, transparency, and for housing terms not to be unilaterally changed,\u201d Ross said.\nIn response to tenants\u2019 claims, Marisa Monte-Santoro, Hines\u2019 public relations director, told Pasadena Now that answers about the allegations are forthcoming.\nHines purchased the Pasadena Gateway Villas from Washington Capital Management in March for $60 million, or $428,571 per unit. That figure made it the\npriciest sale in Pasadena\nin the first three quarters of the year, according to Los Angeles County tax assessor data. More than 40 entities submitted offers on the property out of a desire to avoid the City of Los Angeles\u2019\nMeasure ULA\nreal estate transfer tax, said Newmark\u2019s Kevin Shannon, who\nhelped broker the sale\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The previous owners of a literary-themed\ndowntown\nChicago\nparking garage\nare on the hook for nearly $10 million after the lender seized the building through foreclosure this fall.\nThe lender, a subsidiary of global reinsurance firm Swiss Re, took over the Poetry Garage at 201 West Madison Street in an October sheriff\u2019s sale with a $21.5 million credit bid. This month, the lender secured a court order holding the ownership entities liable for the $9.6 million shortfall on the loan.\nThe borrowers, a group of investors controlled by Syndicated Equities\u2019 Richard Kaplan and John Hammerschlag of Hammerschlag &amp; Co., defaulted on the $33.2 million loan when it matured in March and they failed to pay the full balance, court records show. Kaplan and Hammerschlag were named as sponsor guarantors on the loan.\nNeither Syndicated Equities nor Hammerschlag immediately responded to requests for comment.\nThe 10-story, 1,157-space garage in\nthe Loop\ngets its name from the dedication to poets, like Emily Dickinson and Robert Frost, that mark each of its floors. The building has 385,310 square feet, including 19,312 square feet of retail.\nSwiss Re began foreclosure proceedings in April, according to Cook County Circuit Court records, seeking repayment of the full loan, as well as $275,000 in default interest.\nIn a December ruling, Judge Debra Ann Seaton found the borrowers owed $33.2 million to Swiss Re. A receiver had been appointed who had nearly $2 million in cash collateral, court records show.\nAfter reducing the total owed by the $21.5 million credit bid and $2 million cash from the receiver, the landlords owed an additional $9.6 million, according to the judge\u2019s ruling.\nCourt records paint a picture of years of financial struggle for the landlords before the $33.2 million loan came due this spring. As downtown\noffice occupancy\nplummeted because of the pandemic, the owners secured three separate loan modifications between June 2020 and March 2021. The agreements granted temporary interest-only periods and swept the borrower\u2019s cash flow to keep the deal intact.\nWhen the loan finally matured this spring, Swiss Re wasn\u2019t in a mood to negotiate. Court records show the lender rejected $800,000 in late payments the borrowers tried to make after the deadline. Swiss Re wrote in its filing that it rejected the payments because \u201cthey do not constitute full payment of the entire outstanding balance.\u201d\n",
