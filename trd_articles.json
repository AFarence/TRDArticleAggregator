        "content": "The year 2025 began with a wave of wildfires that tore through the region, leaving scars that still haven\u2019t healed as rebuilding crawls forward in the Pacific Palisades and Altadena.\nMayor Karen Bass came under fire for\ntraveling to Africa\nduring the windstorm that preceded January\u2019s deadly Los Angeles wildfires, despite receiving advanced warnings from weather officials. She has also been accused of mishandling the aftermath. It wasn\u2019t until the end of November the\nfirst rebuild\nin the Palisades was ready for occupancy.\nVarious people and entities jumped in to help with fire recovery, including Rick Caruso, the billionaire real estate developer who\nfounded Steadfast L.A.\n(He managed to save his own retail center in the Palisades by hiring private firefighters.)\nMeasure ULA continued to rankle industry pros with agents saying it impacted deals across the board and multifamily\ndevelopers talking about pivoting\naway from new construction in the City of Los Angeles.\n\u201cThe math ain\u2019t mathing,\u201d said LaTerra Development\u2019s Chris Tourtellotte on developing new apartment buildings in the City of Los Angeles, at\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s inaugural\nL.A. roundtable event\nin September.\nLocal and state politicians tried to find ways to amend the so-called \u201cmansion tax,\u201d which since April 2023 has imposed a 4 percent tax on property sales above $5 million and 5.5 percent on transactions totaling more than $10 million. Bass asked the L.A. City Council to\nroll it back\ntemporarily for Palisades victims, which led to a Los Angeles City Council committee\nvoting in November\nto explore that. State politicians sought \u2014 and \u2014 failed to\ncut tax rates\nfor some newly built multifamily and commercial properties.\n\u201cIt\u2019s continuing to be challenging and they really need to fix it because it\u2019s the crux of the issues today when we\u2019re selling anything residential, even commercial, it comes up and it really has probably stopped 50 percent of the deals, maybe even more,\u201d\nAaron Kirman\n, CEO of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California, said at\nTRD\n\u2019s event.\nVertical construction for the $10 million One Beverly Hills, near the intersection of Santa Monica and Wilshire boulevards, commenced at the end of November, a milestone celebrated by the City of Beverly Hills and the project\u2019s developers. The two-tower mixed-use development includes residences, an Aman Beverly Hill hotel, up to 45 stores and restaurants and 10 acres of botanical gardens and open space. Beverly Hills Mayor Sharona Nazarian told the\nLos Angeles Times\nthe project is \u201can important addition to Beverly Hills.\u201d\nAlso in Beverly Hills, developer Leo Pustilnikov scored a potentially far-reaching victory when a Los Angeles County superior court judge ruled that the city\nviolated state housing law\nby attempting to block his 19-story, 165-unit apartment building with a hotel and restaurant. The ruling forced the city to resume review of the developer\u2019s project and may impact Beverly Hills\u2019 strategy for blocking other builder\u2019s remedy projects, a California legal loophole allowing developers to override local planning when cities fail to adopt a timely and compliant local housing plan.\nDowntown Los Angeles grappled with a slow recovery in 2025 due to pandemic-related issues, immigration raids and subsequent protests, like the \u201cNo Kings\u201d day of action against the Trump administration.\nDozens of people were arrested following a large-scale U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid in the Los Angeles Fashion District on June 6. The raids\ncreated question marks\naround the state\u2019s homebuilding industry, which was already facing labor shortages. Protests resulted in violence, including the destruction of property, attacks on law enforcement and freeway blockades.\nThere was a glimmer of hope for Downtown L.A. when\nTRD\nreported\nin August that there were two serious buyers vying for Oceanwide Plaza and a deal was expected to close by the end of the year. That didn\u2019t happen and the half-built abandoned eyesore\u2019s future remains uncertain.\nOf course the year was not without some celebrity news and interpersonal industry drama that drew reader interest.\nBeyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z took out a\nsecond $57.75 million mortgage\non their Bel Air mansion, bringing the total amount borrowed on the property to around $110.6 million.\n\u201cMillion Dollar Listing Los Angeles\u201d agent Josh Flagg\nsued\nhis former boss, Stephen Kotler, over alleged hacking. \u201cMillion Dollar Listing\u201d star Tracy Tutor\ndeparted\nDouglas Elliman for Compass after turbulence at the former firm. And billionaire developer Donald Bren\ndisavowed his son\n, David Bren, in the wake of lawsuits in which the younger Bren allegedly used his family name to sell fake Beverly Hills club memberships.\n",

        "content": "\u201cThe Comeback\u201d tickled Bay Area readers and\nstorytellers\nthroughout 2025.\nThe trendline has been particularly pronounced in San Francisco, where observers not so long ago wondered whether the city would ever recover from the pandemic.\nThen came the burgeoning artificial intelligence industry to thrust the gold rush town into its latest boom. Employers began\ncalling workers back to the office en masse\n, pulling the city out of\nits extended work-from-home malaise\n. Sleepy neighborhoods such as the Outer Sunset awoke to new interest, and\nbecame one of the city\u2019s most competitive housing submarkets\nthanks to new shops and restaurants, as well as \u201cwhite collar surfers\u201d seeking to enjoy San Francisco\u2019s beachy side.\nTourism even got some shoring up to its\u00a0 precarious footing, as evinced by\nBlackstone\u2019s move on the downtown Four Seasons hotel,\nwhich it bought for a song at $130 million. As one hotel executive said during an industry panel earlier this month, once Blackstone shows interest in hotels, it was\u00a0 a good sign for the market.\nIn this comeback story, first-year Mayor Daniel Lurie has assumed the dual role of protagonist-evangelist. He\nsat down with The Real Deal in June\n, and talked about the importance of getting a handle on public safety as well as \u201cthe perception\u201d of public safety. He also touted his \u201cFamily Zoning Plan\u201d which upzoned a majority of the city for the first time in decades. The vibes, the mayor said, are high.\nOf course, a comeback story requires something to overcome. After shaping the post-pandemic Bay Area narrative, \u201cThe Struggle\u201d still reared its head for readers in 2025.\nThe San Francisco Centre Mall best encapsulated this archetype. Once a trophy asset situated in the center of a great American city, it more recently has sparked wonderment over\nhow low the shopping center\u2019s value could fall.\nAt more than 90 percent vacant, it eventually went back to\nits lenders for $133 million,\na fraction of its one-time $1.2 billion valuation. Whether the mall can have its own comeback story will be a continuing curiosity of 2026.\nThe mall wasn\u2019t the only property to return to its lenders at a loss. According to experts, one-third of distressed borrowers in San Francisco were\nopting for deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure,\nin which they hand their properties back to their lenders to avoid costly foreclosure proceedings. However, developers were jumping in on deals as well. The buzziest buy was perhaps local firm RedCo\u2019s\npurchase of the Wells Fargo Building at 420 Montgomery Street for $55 million\n. It came on a heavy discount for the 12-story office building, a property in which Wells Fargo Bank had invested more than $90 million in renovations over the last decade.\n\u201cMovements of the Wealthy\u201d continues to be another alluring story line. On television, look no further than The Kardashians or the Real Housewives franchise. In real estate, look to Atherton, the Silicon Valley community where $15 million home sales hardly move an eyebrow. However, $51.5 million still means something in the elite enclave\u2013and that\u2019s how\u00a0 much former Seagate Technology CEO Stephen Luczo and his wife, fashion model Agatha Relota Luczo, got for\ntheir Atherton mansion in March\n. The off-market sale might have been Atherton\u2019s highest of 2025, but it was trounced by Green Gables,\na century-old Woodside estate that sold in September for $85 million\n, topping the list of the Bay Area\u2019s most expensive home sales this year.\nClose observations of the rich and famous extended into San Francisco as well. The Shorensteins, one of the city\u2019s best-known real estate families,\nsold their 8,300-square-foot home in the Sea Cliff neighborhood for $30 million\nin January, about 10 times what they paid in 1988. In January, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\nbought three properties next to his Russian Hill mansion\nfor $14 million according to city records.\nIt\u2019s not just home ownership, either. In June,\nThe Real Deal\nreported that the luxury home rental market has been\n\u201cabsolutely insane\u201d in 2025\n. Leasing agents say the rush for homes at $10,000 to $35,000 per month has been driven by low inventory and more high-income renters returning to the city as more employers have called workers back to the office.\nLast but not least, we have \u201cThe Scandal.\u201d Who doesn\u2019t love reading about a good scandal? Readers particularly enjoyed\nthe scandal of Alexander Beckman\n, the former CEO of the AI company GameOn who allegedly defrauded investors out of $60 million and used the money with his wife to buy two homes in Presidio Heights. Then there was the fall of local Bay Area developer Kenneth Mattson, who in May was\ncuffed by federal agents in a Napa parking lot for allegedly leading\u00a0 a Ponzi scheme\nthat cheated senior citizens and churchgoers out of $46 million.\nYet real estate mogul Michael Shvo\u2019s legal trouble may bring the greatest consequence to Bay Area real estate. In November, Shvo, whose company SHVO rose to prominence in San Francisco after investing $1 billion to buy and revitalize the Transamerica Pyramid, was accused of\nrunning a yearslong Racketeer Influenced Crime Organization (RICO) conspiracy\n. In a lawsuit, Shvo is alleged to have misled \u201cinvestors, condo purchasers, tenants, and business partners into multi-million dollar transactions, the proceeds of which were diverted to enrich Shvo and his associates, and to fund their lavish lifestyles.\u201d The lawsuit was only the latest drama for Shvo in 2025, who has had to fight a barrage of lawsuits, and drew attention for his dramatic exit from a high-profile Miami Beach development.\n",

        "content": "South Florida\u2019s largest retail trades of 2025 were headlined by Simon Property Group\u2019s purchase of Brickell City Centre\u2019s shops and a wave of institutional capital targeting grocery-anchored centers and lifestyle assets from Miami\u2019s urban core to Palm Beach County suburbs.\nThe 10 biggest deals totaled more than $1.2 billion, a significant bump in transaction volume compared to 2024 when the top ten deals totaled\n$556 million\n. Investors were willing to pay high prices per square foot for well-leased retail assets with strong tenant rosters.\u200b\n1. $512M | Brickell City Centre | Simon Property Group\nIndianapolis-based Simon, led by CEO David Simon, claimed the most-expensive retail purchase with a takeover of the 500,000-square-foot retail mall at Brickell City Centre. Simon bought partner Swire Properties\u2019 75 percent stake for $512.6 million. The acquisition, at about $1,367 per square foot, gave Simon control of one of Miami\u2019s highest-profile mixed-use shopping destinations in the heart of Brickell.\n2. $133M | Marketplace at the Outlets | Invesco Real Estate\nComing in second place is Invesco Real Estate\u2019s $133.25 million acquisition of Marketplace at the Outlets, a 303,800-square-foot open-air center in West Palm Beach. The June deal breaks down to $439 per square foot, and the price was roughly $3 million above the sale price three years ago. Atlanta-based Invesco, led by CEO Andrew Schlossberg, assumed a $79 million loan in the transaction.

Pontegadea paid $5,500 a square foot for a 20,000-square-foot retail building that includes longtime Design District restaurant Michael\u2019s Genuine and a Rolex store. A partnership between David Edelsterin\u2019s Tricap, Aby Rosen\u2019s RFR and Commerz Real AG sold Atlas Plaza for $60 million above its sale price a decade ago, underscoring the Design District\u2019s emergence as a luxury retail destination. The seller paid $50 million in 2015.\n6. $88M | CityPlace Doral | Continental Realty Corporation\nBaltimore-based Continental Realty Corp made its first plunge into the South Florida retail market this year. Continental, led by CEO JM Shapiro, acquired CityPlace Doral, a multi-level 235,100-square-foot open-air center in Doral, for $87.5 million, or $372 a square foot. The seller, PGIM Real Estate, co-developed CityPlace Doral, a development that also included two apartment buildings, with Coconut Grove-based Related Group and Coral Gables-based Shoma Group. The retail component is anchored by a Fresh Market store and CMX CineBistro.\n7. $83M | Polo Club Shops | Publix\nPublix went on a South Florida shopping spree this year, buying up retail centers where it has stores. The Lakeland-based grocery chain paid $83 million for Polo Club Shops in Boca Raton. The sale breaks down to $616 a square foot. Publix acquired the 134,800-square-foot retail plaza for $32 million above the sale price a decade ago. Jamestown paid $50.6 million in 2015.\n8. $73M | Galleria Fort Lauderdale | GFO Investments and partners\nA partnership of GFO Investments, InSite Group, Atlas Hill Real Estate and Prime Finance bought Galleria Fort Lauderdale for $73 million. The 799,900-square-foot mall sits on 31.6 acres in Fort Lauderdale that the joint venture plans to redevelop into nine 30-story towers offering about 3,000 housing apartments, a hotel and room for retail, restaurants and office space. The price amounts to $2.3 million per acre. Seller Keystone-Florida Holding Corporation paid $25.1 million for the property in 1993 and was asking over $100 million when it listed in 2023.\n9. $72M | Hammocks Town Center | Publix\nPublix paid $71.9 million in October for Hammocks Town Center in Kendall. The deal breaks down to $347 a square foot for the 207,500-square-foot shopping center anchored by a Publix supermarket. The buyer paid $54 million above the sale price in 1999, when Regency Centers Corporation paid $18 million for the 26.3-acre site.\n10. $68.4M | Village Commons | Kite Realty Group\nIndianapolis-based Kite Realty Group, led by CEO John Kite, paid $68.4 million in January for the 172,500-square-foot West Palm Beach shopping center anchored by a Publix store.

        "content": "Austin\u2019s residential market declined this year\n, but the average price of the top 10 public home sales is higher than it was in 2024. Why?\nIt\u2019s not that Austin is a\nK-shaped\nmarket, with luxury rising while the lower tiers sink. Home prices have fallen across all tiers in Austin\nsince 2022\n, according to the\nTexas Real Estate Research Center\n.\nInstead, the trend may be due to\nAustin\u2019s uniquely robust private market\n, which agents say has been losing high-value homes to the Multiple Listing Service this year.\nAustin has always relished secrecy\n. Dallas-Fort Worth has Billy Bob\u2019s, the world\u2019s biggest honky-tonk; Austin has the Cloak Room, a literally underground speakeasy near the Capitol tunnels. While DFW has Reunion Tower, Austin\u2019s most iconic symbols are alley murals, like Jeremiah the Frog near the University of Texas and the \u201ci love you so much\u201d inscription on South Congress.\nAccordingly,\nAustin has perhaps the most thriving off-market real estate scene in Texas\n. That\u2019s why the biggest public sales of 2025, topping out at $17 million, shrink beside the private deals that have occasionally entered the spotlight, like\nEmma Stone\u2019s $23.5 million home in Tarrytown\n, or\nRoss Moody\u2019s Westlake purchase that almost certainly exceeded $20 million\n.\nHowever,\nAustin is now in a buyer\u2019s market\n, and even luxury sellers are feeling the change. Homes that would have normally sold off-market are increasingly going public, trading the tax advantages of privacy for the competitive boost of exposure.\nWho knows?\nAs more homes above $10 million trickle to the MLS\n, a continued downturn might bring bigger sales to next year\u2019s ranking.\nAll prices below are asking prices; final sales prices are undisclosed.\n13330 Shore Vista Drive | $16.9 million\nThe biggest public sale of the year was also the first.\nA Lake Austin estate at 13330 Shore Vista Drive went under contract on New Year\u2019s Eve\nand closed in February after last listing for almost $17 million, or about $2,000 per square foot for the 8,220-square-foot home. The estate of Abilene insurance agent William Kiker, who in 2021 bought the home from Moody International Companies CEO Brett Moody, sold it to an LLC managed by a David J. Miller for an undisclosed price.\nBuilt in 2013 on 3.17 acres, the five-bedroom, seven-bathroom property is west of Austin proper on the Colorado River, near Horseshoe Bay. The listing paragraph offered the rare amenity of access \u201cby air, land or water, as helicopter landings are allowed.\u201d\nKuper Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent Bridget Ramey had the listing.\n3500 Bunny Run | $13 million\nWith five bedrooms, seven bathrooms and 8,600 square feet, the second-place home is comparable in size and location to the frontrunner. However, the property at 3500 Bunny Run isn\u2019t quite on the river, and the lot is about half the size at 1.64 acres. Its listing price of $13 million comes down to about $1,000 per square foot. Compass Real Estate agents Saira Ukani and Ross Speed marketed the property, which sellers Darren Kocs and Beth Hellerstedt sold in May to Kalan Wagner.\n907 Terrace Mountain Drive | $9.6 million\nMoreland Properties agent Cord Shiflet audaciously marketed the West Lake Hills home at 907 Terrace Mountain Drive with just one full sentence: \u201cDick Clark, architect. John Luce, builder. They say a picture is worth 1,000 words so I\u2019ll just stop here.\u201d With four bedrooms, five bathrooms, a lot under an acre and 4,700 square feet, the value of this home lies in its historically significant design and its location in West Lake Hills, a neighborhood west of the city in the bow of the Colorado River between Highway 360 and Mopac. The listing price amounts to about $1,500 per square foot.\nA trust held by inventor Harold Shockley sold the home to another trust registered to investor and former publisher Sandra Cunningham in February, according to public records.\n1401 North Weston Lane | $9 million\nThis West Lake waterfront home just missed the\nAustin tech boom of 2021 and 2022\n. The sellers, Paul and Jennifer Gregory, listed the house for $13 million in May of 2023 and cut the price several times that year. They took the home off the market until May 2025, when it was listed for $9.4 million. The 5,600-square-foot home finally sold in September with an asking price just under $9 million, about $1,600 per square foot, to a trust connected to Joseph Lum. Eric Moreland of Moreland Properties had the listing.\n5009 Spanish Oaks Club Boulevard | $9 million\nIt helps to be near a golf course\n. The Spanish Oaks neighborhood is a guard-gated community by the Spanish Oaks Golf Club, offering easy access for whoever leads The Perseverance Trust, which bought the property from Norman and Cecilia Davis in April, according to public records.\nThe $9 million listing price for the 10,000-square-foot contemporary comes down to about $890 per square foot.\nThe Davises bought and sold the property at inopportune moments,\nthough some of their neighbors have fared worse\n. The six-bedroom, seven-bathroom home last traded in 2022, the\npeak\nof the\nhoneymoon phase\nbetween Austin and the big tech industry.\nPeyton Tomson of The Agency Austin had the listing.\n5217 South Scout Island Circle | $8.5 million\nBilled by Kuper Sotheby\u2019s agents Joseph Longton and Kirk Lewis as Austin\u2019s \u201cmost spectacular waterfront home under $9 million,\u201d this four-bedroom, five-bathroom property asked about $1,400 per square foot for almost 6,200 square feet on a third of an acre. Seller John Reardon sold the property to an LLC in September, according to public records.\n200 Congress Avenue, Unit 50T | $8.3 million\nThe only condo on the list is also the first deal east of Texas State Highway Loop 1, better known as Mopac. Thomas J. Henry sold this penthouse in the\nAustonian\nto entrepreneur, author and dramatic producer Sir Mallory Factor and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Factor, in May, according to public records. The $8.3 million asking price amounts to about $1,600 per square foot for the 5,000-square-foot condo. Ramey had the listing.\n2701 Slow Turtle Cove | $8 million\nSteven Howse, who may be either the rapper or the creator of Slither.io, sold the 8,000-square-foot, five-bedroom, eight-bathroom Westlake Highlands home to Stewart Hudson in September, according to public records. Howse asked about $1,000 per square foot. Michael Lamendola of The Austin Home Company had the listing.\n2001 Cueva De Oro Cove | $8 million\nVenture capitalist Joe Aragona sold the 7,900-square-foot, five-bedroom, seven-bathroom home at 2001 Cueva de Oro Cove to Vijay and Rachana Iyengar in October, according to public records. The home turned around quickly after listing in September. The asking price equates to about $1,000 per square foot. Shiflet had the listing.\n3500 Ranch Road 620 Road North | $7.9 million\nDubbed \u201cThe Bond House\u201d for its mid-century sleekness, the 5,200-square-foot, four-bedroom, five-bathroom home was designed by renowned Texas architect O\u2019Neil Ford in 1962.\nIt was also the viral listing of \u201cSpy Kids\u201d director Robert Rodriguez\n, who originally listed it for $8.9 million in 2024. It sold when it was asking $7.9 million, or about $1,500 per square foot. The home is on a lot that spans almost 4 acres on Lake Travis.\nThe Ryan Chen and Chia Jung Living Trust purchased the property in March, according to public records.\n",

        "content": "Two attempts to put a lavish resort on the waterfront of a Riverhead hamlet went nowhere. Thanks to the state, there won\u2019t be a third try.\nNew York State finalized a nearly $11 million conservation easement at Broad Cove Preserve, permanently barring construction on land that preservationists long viewed as one of the East End\u2019s most vulnerable large parcels, Newsday\nreported\n. The 100-acre waterfront site in Aquebogue, once floated as the home of a 500-room resort, is officially off the development map.\nThe state Department of Environmental Conservation paid $10.95 million for the easement, which cements protections on the former duck farm overlooking Flanders Bay. The property is owned by Peconic Land Trust, which acquired the site in 2021 while developers were circling, including one proposing a large-scale resort complex.\nThat resort idea wasn\u2019t new: in 2016, a separate developer pitched a 500-room hotel and spa at Broad Cove before abandoning the plan. By the time the land trust moved to buy the property, the owner, Walo LLC, was still entertaining development offers.\nThe trust ultimately\npaid $11.5 million\nusing private donations and short-term credit, betting the state would later step in with permanent protection.\nThe easement, recorded with the deed, prohibits development in perpetuity, even if the land trust eventually sells the property. It also guarantees public access, locking in recreational use at a site spanning roughly 100 acres, including about 8,000 feet of shoreline along Terry Creek and Broad Cove.\nPreservation advocates framed the deal as a close call. Peconic Land Trust officials said development was an \u201cimminent threat\u201d when the group moved to acquire the land, which sits adjacent to Indian Island County Park and has been flagged in the state\u2019s Open Space Conservation Plan since the early 1990s.\n\u201cWhat was once slated for a major waterfront development project has now been preserved and transformed into a beautiful public recreational space in perpetuity,\u201d Riverhead Town Supervisor Tim Hubbard said in a statement.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "South Florida\u2019s top office deal this year was Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega\u2019s $274.4 million purchase of Brickell\u2019s Sabadell Financial Center.\nThe sellers received a higher offer from a buyer who required a loan, but they went with Ortega\u2019s all-cash offer, a source said. Cash deals are often preferred because they take out the uncertainty of closing that comes with financed purchases, experts said.\nDistress was still part of the story for the tri-county office market this year, as high interest rates and remote work trends linger.\nOf the 10 biggest office sales this year, one property traded out of bankruptcy, another out of foreclosure, a third through deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure, and two properties traded for minimal value gains from their previous prices.\nDowntown West Palm Beach, which billionaire Steve Ross is recreating in his own image, is the one submarket that showed immunity to the slowdown. His Related Ross is the biggest office landlord in downtown West Palm, where he has quickly tenanted his top tier buildings at record lease rates partly by tapping his New York connections.\nHere are South Florida\u2019s top office deals for 2025.\nAll-cash fashion\nSpain\u2019s richest person, Amancio Ortega, bought the 30-story Sabadell Financial Center in Brickell for\n$274.4 million\nin cash.\nOrtega\u2019s Pontegadea family office, which invests dividends from Ortega\u2019s retail empire in real estate, bought the 1 million-square-foot tower at 1111 Brickell Avenue in Miami in October. The deal broke down to roughly $274 per square foot.\nTenants include co-working firm Industrious, marketing firm Tibint, Kennedys Law, Law Offices of Wolf &amp; Pravato and commercial real estate services firm Northmarq.\nSellers New York-based KKR and Orlando-based Parkway had paid\n$248.5 million\nfor Sabadell Financial Center in 2018, marking that year\u2019s top office deal. The tower was completed in 2000 as part of a larger mixed-use project that included the adjacent 296-key JW Marriott Miami.\nOrtega\n, best known as the founder of Zara and Bershka, also owns Massimo Dutti, Stradivarius, and Pull and Bear through his Inditex holding company. His Sabadell purchase was part of Ortega\u2019s global real estate shopping spree this year, likely a way for the billionaire to quickly reinvest his hefty Inditex payouts to avoid Spain\u2019s high taxes.\nTrio buys Bank of America Plaza at Las Olas City Centre\nLone Star Funds, through its real estate fund VII, Highline Real Estate Capital and Square2 Capital bought the 23-story Bank of America Plaza at Las Olas City Centre in downtown Fort Lauderdale for\n$221 million\nin February.\nThe 410,600-square-foot building at 401 East Las Olas Boulevard traded for $538 per square foot. Completed in 2003 on a full city block, Bank of America Plaza has averaged 94 percent occupancy over the years.\nDallas-based private equity firm Lone Star Funds is led by CEO Donald Quintin, Miami-based Highline is led by David Moret, and Coconut Grove-based Square2 is led by principals Jay Caplin and Michael Manno.\nSeller Rreef Property Trust, the U.S. subsidiary of German asset manager DWS Group, paid\n$220 million\nfor the building in 2016. This year\u2019s sale was part of\nRreef\u2019s\nyearslong strategy to deweigh its portfolio from offices.\nFirms divesting from offices amid the nationwide leasing and lending slowdown are more likely to part with their South Florida properties, market experts say.\nBecause the tri-county region\u2019s market got a boost during a pandemic-era influx of companies and increases in rents, landlords can sell their South Florida buildings for at least breakeven values or small gains. Elsewhere in the U.S., they would likely sell at a loss, experts have said.\nDWS sold another downtown Fort Lauderdale office property in the same week as the Bank of America Plaza deal.\nChicago firm buys Las Olas City Centre\nDWS sold Las Olas City Centre I &amp; II for\n$208 million\nin February.\nChicago-based Bradford Allen Investment Advisors, led by Jeffrey Bernstein and Laurence Elbaum, bought the 470,800-square-foot complex with an 18-story building at 350 East Las Olas, a 15-story building at 450 East Las Olas, a 1,344-space garage and retail space. The deal broke down to $438 per square foot.\nThe buildings were 76 percent leased at the time of the deal.\nDWS bought Las Olas Centre in 2014 for $204 million, according to records.\nWynwood office gamble goes awry\nNew York-based R&amp;B Realty lost its Wynwood office buildings in bankruptcy court.\nSan Diego-based Cire Equity acquired the\n$89.6 million\ncredit bid in August for the 12-story Gateway at Wynwood, at 2916 North Miami Avenue, and an adjacent single-story bank building, at 2830 North Miami Avenue, from A10 Capital. The price for the 220,900-square-foot property breaks down to $408 a foot.\nCire is led by Joshua Volen and Trevor Smith.\nAfter A10 Capital won a final judgment in its foreclosure case against R&amp;B last year, R&amp;B affiliates filed for\nbankruptcy\n, avoiding foreclosure auction. A10 Capital later won the bankruptcy auction for the properties when no other bids were submitted, though R&amp;B was given a chance to refinance its $112.9 million loan on the building.\nAron Rosenberg\u2019s R&amp;B completed Gateway at Wynwood in 2021, just as the neighborhood gained an image as an office mecca amid the influx of out-of-state companies to South Florida.\nMarket boosters touted Wynwood\u2019s newfound reputation as a magnet for tech firms, with some even rechristening the area \u201cSilicon Valley South.\u201d Yet, Wynwood\u2019s fortunes\nturned\n, and data shows tech firms\ndidn\u2019t account for hefty office leasing\n. In the meantime, landlords got hit with higher interest rates.\nGateway at Wynwood took a financial hit when a cyber attack stole a $3 million-plus payment to the general contractor, R&amp;B said in court filings. Later, its construction loans matured just as aggressive interest rate increases started. It obtained two loans from A10, making partial payments. A10 then sought foreclosure.\nCoconut Grove buildings come full circle\nAzora Private Solutions, a global investment manager that\u2019s a joint venture between Miami-based Exan Capital and Madrid-based Advenir Azora, bought two office buildings in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove for\n$82 million\n, combined.\nIn September, Azora paid $301 per square foot for the seven-story building at 3225 Aviation Avenue and the four-story building at 3250 Mary Street. Azora is led by Juan Jos\u00e9 Zaragoza and Ignacio Gil-Casares.\nThe deal was a buyback for Exan Capital. In 2020, Exan Capital, which was founded by Zaragoza, sold the properties to Washington, D.C.-based Madison Marquette for a combined\n$47.4 million\n.\nTourmaline buys distressed Coral Gables offices\nTourmaline Capital Partners bought Columbus Center in Coral Gables for\n$76 million\nin March, a year after the complex\u2019s debt woes began.\nBryn Mawr, Pennsylvania-based Tourmaline paid $290 per square foot for the 14-story building and eight-story building on a 2.5-acre site at 1 Alhambra Plaza. The complex spans nearly 262,000 square feet.\nThe previous owner, San Antonio, Texas-based Affinius Capital, defaulted on its $71.6 million loan last year, and it\nentered special servicing\n. Affinius had failed to renew an interest rate cap, or a hedge against increases of interest rates, for the floating-rate loan, according to Morningstar Credit. That constituted a default under the financing agreement with lender V\u00e4rde Partners.\nMinneapolis-based V\u00e4rde filed for foreclosure against Affinius last year, alleging it defaulted on a $68.9 million loan and a total amount due of\n$77.4 million\n, including interest and late fees, according to the complaint.\nChris Neilson, the court-appointed receiver overseeing Columbus Center and its financials in the foreclosure suit, sold the building to Tourmaline, writing in a court filing that the deal \u201crepresents a reasonable and fair market value.\u201d\nTourmaline, led by\nBrandon Huffman\n, bought the property free from liens or other financial obligations.\nRyder\u2019s HQ trades at a discount\nRyder System\u2019s Coral Gables headquarters traded this month for\n$70.4million\n, a 13 percent discount from its price over a decade ago.\nFort Worth, Texas-based Crescent Real Estate, led by John Goff and Conrad Suszynski, bought the 11-story, 205,400-square-foot Ryder Colonnade at 169 Coral Way for $331 a foot. Boston-based AEW Capital Management was the seller.\nThe building\u2019s name was changed to include \u201cRyder,\u201d after Miami-Dade County homegrown logistics giant\nRyder System\nmoved its headquarters there last year. Ryder was based previously in a northwest area of the county for roughly 20 years, and moved to a smaller space at Ryder Colonnade, citing the\nremote work shift\n.\nBoston-based TA Associates Realty, through an affiliate, paid\n$81 million\nfor the office building in 2013, records show. In 2015, AEW Capital took over the entity, meaning it likely purchased the entire ownership stake of the building, state corporate records show.\nHamilton\u2019s struggling suburban offices play\nNashville-based Hamilton Development bought three office buildings in Miami-Dade County\u2019s Flagler Station business campus, purchasing the seller\u2019s\n$64 million\nloan on the properties in May.\nSalt Lake City, Utah-based Bridge Investment Group sold the adjacent properties at 9675, 9725 and 10451 Northwest 117th Avenue in an unincorporated area of the county for $158 per square foot. After acquiring the Wells Fargo loan, Hamilton then took over the buildings through deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure.\nThe deed-in-lieu of foreclosure for the building at 9675 Northwest 117th Avenue was valued at\n$20.8 million\n, for the building at 9725 Northwest 117th Avenue was valued at\n$20.4 million\nand for the one for 10451 Northwest 117th Avenue at $21.1 million.\nBridge Investment paid a combined $85.8 million for the buildings in 2018, records show.\nHamilton was founded in 2023 by former executives at Irvine, California-based Panattoni Development. Hamilton is led by\u00a0 Whitfield and Hayne Hamilton.\nThe deal came amid struggles for South Florida\u2019s suburban offices, even as top tier buildings in prime markets such as downtown West Palm Beach and Miami\u2019s Brickell thrive with new-to-market tenant leases and record rents. Aging office campuses in suburban areas have felt the sting from remote work, making them prime targets for redevelopment.\nThe Flagler Station buildings, completed in 2006, 2007 and 2009, struggled with occupancy at the time of Hamilton\u2019s purchase. Two of the buildings had an occupancy in the 40 percent.\nHamilton plans to replace the properties at 9725 Northwest and 10451 Northwest 117th Avenue with a two-building, 300,000-plus-square-foot industrial facility.\nThe building at 9675 Northwest 117th Avenue will remain, recently scoring a\n42,000-square-foot\nlease by the University of Miami for its health care system\u2019s offices.\nSteve Ross can\u2019t stop his West Palm investing\nBillionaire Steve Ross \u2013\u2013 who has at least 11 properties in downtown West Palm, including purchased, developed, under construction and planned \u2013\u2013 added the One Clearlake building to his portfolio.\nLast month, Ross\u2019 West Palm-based Related Ross paid\n$55.4 million\nfor the 18-story, 221,700-square-foot building at 250 South Australian Avenue and adjacent four-story, 669-space garage. The deal broke down to about $250 per square foot.\nIt was the second time One Clearlake traded this year. Seller Bradford Allen bought it for\n$45 million\n, marking a nearly 26 percent discount from its sale price four years ago.\nThe deal gives Ross 7.6 contiguous acres facing Clear Lake. Completed in 1987, One Clearlake sits on 2.9 acres. Ross also owns the adjacent two-story, 70,100-square-foot\nWPTV studio and office building\nat 1100 Banyan Boulevard, completed in 2000 on 4.7 acres.\nRelated Ross hasn\u2019t shared redevelopment plans. Any potential replacement of the buildings would have to wait because the E.W. Scripps Company, WPTV\u2019s parent, leased back its building for a term of at least two and a half years.\nRoss ripple effect\nToronto-based family office Coco Group, led by Jenny Coco, bought the boutique 100-year-old Echo building at 205 Datura Street in downtown West Palm Beach for\n$45.7 million\nin May.\nBoca Raton-based Morning Calm Management, led by Mukang Cho, sold the four-story, 71,700-square-foot building and attached 10-story, 257-space garage for $637 a square foot. Morning Calm renovated Echo in 2021.\nTenants include Stone Point Capital, Alta Rock Partners, Frost Point Capital, Beacon Ridge Capital Management and Bold Ocean, according to its website. Asking lease rates are $68 a foot, triple net.\nWest Palm Beach emerged as one of South Florida\u2019s top office markets largely due to\nRoss\u2019 hefty investment and development activity\nin the area.\nRoss stepped back from New York-based Related Companies, which he founded over 50 years ago, to start and lead Related Ross last year. His buildings were among the first to reach a record lease rate of over $100 a foot, though asking rates have topped that in more recent years.\nSource(s): TRD analysis of deals reported by TRD, Colliers, Cushman &amp; Wakefield and Commercial Observer.\n",

        "content": "Rents in New York City are\nreaching never-before-seen levels\n\u2014 even for the city\u2019s wealthiest.\nAn apartment at the Benson,\nNaftali Group\u2019s 15-unit luxury condominium\non the Upper East Side, rented for $95,000, or $288 per foot, this week. For a 12-month term, the price per square foot appears to be one of the highest in the city\u2019s history.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Lauren Muss, John Giannone and Jac Credaroli had the listing. Serhant\u2019s Peter Zaitzeff brought the tenant.\nSpanning almost 4,000 square feet, Unit 14 has five bedrooms, four full bathrooms and a great room with triple exposures overlooking Madison Avenue.\nThe anonymous owner of the unit at the Benson had bought the condo from the sponsor for $14.5 million in 2022. In 2023, they rented the same unit out for $65,000 per month, according to StreetEasy.\nThe Benson, at 1045 Madison Avenue, has amenities including a landscaped rooftop lounge, a cinema and a spa with sauna and steam rooms.\nIt\u2019s difficult to ascertain a true priciest rent per foot given the lack of public records around rentals, but several say it\u2019s one of the highest numbers they\u2019ve seen for a standard 12-month lease.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not the highest, it\u2019s one of the highest ever,\u201d said Miller Samuel CEO Jonathan Miller, an appraiser who releases a monthly report on the city\u2019s rental market.\nThe luxury rental market has outpaced\nManhattan\u2019s overall red-hot market, according to Miller. In November, Manhattan\u2019s median rent rose over 13 percent annually to a record $4,750, while luxury rents \u2014 defined as the top 10 percent of recorded rents in the month \u2014 rose almost 18 percent to a median price of $11,500.\nOne of the most expensive rentals on a per-square-foot basis in recent memory was Unit 57B at 220 Central Park South, which rented for $90,000 per month, or $336 per square foot, in 2023, according to StreetEasy.\nThe most expensive rent recorded on StreetEasy belongs to a set of units at Jeff Greene\u2019s condo conversion at\n100 Vandam Street\nthat went for $150,000, as well as the penthouse at 24 Leonard Street, which Zaitzeff also rented out for $150,000.\nFurnished residences that rent for a month at a time can rent for even more.\nWhile cracking six figures on rentals is still rare, Giannone, one of the listing agents on unit 14, said he\u2019s seeing a new threshold arising for the luxury market.\n\u201cI personally have never seen prices where they\u2019re at,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the high $100s per square foot for a rental starts to become like the norm, it\u2019s completely different from what we\u2019re used to.\u201d\nMuss said that they likely could have gotten even more for the unit, which was initially asking $85,000, but were given a single two-hour window to show it. Still, she said they had multiple bidders.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just no product, and there\u2019s a lot of money out there,\u201d she said.\nZaitzeff said his clients, who were renovating their townhouse and needed a place to stay, were willing to pay above the asking price to secure the deal.\n\u201cIt speaks to the lack of inventory and people willing to pay what it takes to get a deal done,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "Another piece of Chicago\u2019s early skyscraper history is receiving landmark status, clearing the way for a major residential conversion in the Loop by Igor Gabal and Envoi Partners.\nThe Chicago City Council approved the designation of the former Central YMCA Headquarters this week at 19 South LaSalle Street, a 132-year-old building designed by William Le Baron Jenney, widely credited as the father of the skyscraper, Urbanize Chicago\nreported\n. The vote formally protects the building\u2019s exterior just as local developer Envoi Partners moves forward with plans to redevelop the property into apartments and ground-floor retail.\nEnvoi acquired the 16-story building in October 2024 through a venture backed by Chicago\u00a0 Gabal that bought the troubled 159,000-square-foot building\u2019s loan note for $4.2 million.\nEnvoi Partners\n, led by Nate Ernst and Cory Faulkner, assumed an ownership stake alongside Gabal in the property, and has since secured permits to demolish the interior as part of a $64 million adaptive reuse project,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported.\nHartshorne Plunkard Architecture is designing the conversion, which will deliver 207 apartments on the upper floors and new retail at street level. Power Construction is slated to begin work in spring 2026.\nCity officials found the building met multiple criteria for landmark status, starting with its historical role as the headquarters of the Central YMCA during the organization\u2019s rapid expansion in Chicago in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Unlike most YMCA facilities of the era, the LaSalle Street property combined association programming with a high-rise commercial office component, packing nearly 40,000 square feet of rentable offices into the building to help offset costs in the central business district, according to the outlet.\nFrom the 1920s through the 1950s, the\nbuilding\nserved as the hub of the YMCA\u2019s educational programming, benefiting from its central location and ample classroom space.\nThe designation also rests on architecture. Completed in 1893 by\nJenney &amp; Mundie\nand expanded in 1913 by successor firm Jenney, Mundie &amp; Jensen, the structure is an early example of a fireproof, steel-frame skyscraper. Its design blends late-19th-century historicism with the emerging Chicago School emphasis on structural expression and restrained ornamentation. According to Urbanize, the west tower\u2019s Romanesque and later Classical Revival treatments contrast sharply with the stripped-down south elevation, reflecting Jenney\u2019s functional philosophy.\nThe building is one of only two remaining Jenney-designed structures in the Loop, alongside the New York Life Building across LaSalle Street. Though altered over time, including changes to storefronts and the removal of its cornice, the property retains much of its original massing, materials and window patterns.\n\u2014 Eric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Jeff Sutton is going for the jugular in his fight against his lender on a struggling Herald Square property.\nThe retail titan and head of Wharton Properties fired back against the German bank Helaba after the lender initiated a\nforeclosure\non his property at 27-29 West 34th Street earlier this year.\nSutton\u2019s lawyers, Darren and Terrence Oved of Oved &amp; Oved, are now seeking sanctions and attorney fees from the lender Landesbank Hessen-Th\u00fcringen, also known as Helaba, claiming the lender\u2019s move to pursue Sutton was a \u201ctransparent, orchestrated attempt to tarnish\u201d his reputation.\nHelaba initially provided a $50 million loan in 2018 for the three-story building.\nBut the lender filed a lawsuit in New York Supreme Court in September, alleging the building owner defaulted and failed to pay over $12 million in real estate taxes to New York City. Sutton was also named as a defendant in the lawsuit because he signed a limited guarantee.\nSince then, a New York State Supreme Court judge appointed a temporary receiver for the property.\nBut Sutton\u2019s lawyers have filed a motion to dismiss and are now leveling allegations against the lender itself. At the crux of Sutton\u2019s new legal filings is his limited personal guarantee, which would only make him liable in instances of fraud or other intentional misrepresentations.\nThe lender claimed Sutton\u2019s unpaid tax bill put him in default. But by Sutton\u2019s account, the property\u2019s value was decimated by Covid. The property\u2019s valuation, along with others on 34th Street, was slashed. Two of the property\u2019s prior tenants Geox and Aldo entered bankruptcy, further cutting into rental revenue.\nSutton\u2019s legal filings also take aim at the City\u2019s Department of Finance for assessing real estate taxes on the property as though it were bringing in $6.6 million in gross rental income. In actuality, he claims, the rent was about 10 percent of the city\u2019s total, at $680,000.\nThe property has not received rents anywhere close to the City\u2019s number over the last six years, according to Sutton\u2019s filings.\nSutton claims he eventually entered into an agreement with the city to reduce the amount of taxes owed by millions of dollars.\nAccording to Sutton, the borrower had an \u201cunbroken record of timely principal and interest payments.\u201d\nBut in April, the lender sent over a notice of default, citing the $12 million unpaid real estate taxes.\nSutton\u2019s filing claims the lender was repeatedly made aware of the outstanding tax liability. That liability was also listed on the Department of Finance\u2019s website for years.\nThe lender initiated an event of default anyway, according to Sutton, despite the fact that the tax issues were still being adjudicated with the city.\nBy September, the German lender initiated a foreclosure and named Sutton as a defendant over a limited personal guarantee he signed.\nSutton\u2019s lawyers at Oved &amp; Oved, who have notably gone up and won against sharp-elbowed lenders such as Maverick Real Estate Partners and\nRialto Capital\n, argue that Sutton\u2019s guarantee only applies if the borrower committed fraud or made intentional misrepresentations. They claim Sutton did neither. And all rents from the property have been turned over to the receiver.\n\u201cOur motion to fully dismiss plaintiff\u2019s baseless claims and for sanctions for its utter frivolousness puts plaintiff on notice that its misguided actions have caused our clients significant harm \u2014 harm we are determined to significantly remedy,\u201d said Terrence and Darren Oved.\nSutton initially acquired the buildings through a joint venture with SL Green in 2006. The $30 million deal included a third adjacent building.\nHelaba\u2019s attorney did not return a request for comment.\n",

Despite reported concerns of a slowdown and deterrants for wealthy buyers, the borough still nabbed its second-biggest period for luxury contracts since 2006, when Olshan Realty began tracking data.\nBuyers inked deals for more than 1,400 homes asking $4 million or more this year, up 11 percent from 2024, according to the brokerage\u2019s annual report. The signed contracts totaled just under $12 billion, up from just $11.2 billion last year.\nOlshan Realty chalked the increase up to sellers finally reckoning with the realities of the market and lowering asking prices. The average asking price dropped 4 percent compared to last year. The report also pointed to a strong year for Wall Street as a bolster to the market.\nFor every one co-op to find a buyer, three condo contracts were signed, which has been the case for more than a decade. Half of the condos sold this year were new development apartments.\nMore than 280 homes asking $10 million or more entered contract \u2014 six more than last year, but significantly less than the 400 trophy deals inked in 2021, the highest year on record.\nPriciest deals inked last week\nThe short week leading up to Christmas was a quieter one. Buyers signed just 13 contracts for Manhattan homes asking $4 million or more, which was on par with the last time Christmas was on a Thursday but lower than the decade average of 17 for the week.\nThe total was also less than the 21 deals inked in the\nprevious period\n.\nThe priciest home to land a signed contract was a penthouse at 65 West 13th Street, with an asking price of $13.5 million. The pending deal includes two separate condos sold by different sellers, which could be combined to total roughly 5,400 square feet. The duo hit the market two years ago, asking just under $17 million.\nUnit 11A, which last traded for $6.4 million in 2011, has three bedrooms, three bathrooms and a terrace. It\u2019s unclear when and for what price Unit 11B last sold. The apartment features two bedrooms, two bathrooms and a wraparound terrace.\nAmenities in the 77-residence building, known as the Greenwich, include doormen, a gym and a children\u2019s playroom.\nNest Seekers\u2019 Tamir Shemesh and Patty Lehan had the listing.\nThe second most expensive property to find a buyer was a sponsor unit at CIM Group\u2019s 235 West 75th Street, known as the Astor. Unit 723, which spans 3,800 square feet, last asked just under $8 million. It has five bedrooms, five bathrooms and a library.\nCIM Group foreclosed on the project in 2021,\ntaking it over\nfrom Ziel Feldman\u2019s HFZ Capital, which had converted the pre-war rental building into condos in 2015. At the time, CIM also took control of three other properties that the now-defunct firm had planned to convert.\nAmenities at the building include 24-hour concierge services and a fitness room. Douglas Elliman\u2019s Kyle Egan, Katherine Gauthier and Will Rivera had the listing.\nOf the 13 properties, nine were condos, two were co-ops and two were townhouses.\nThe homes asked a combined $82 million, which works out to an average price of $6.3 million and a median of $5.6 million. The typical home was on the market for more than three years and had a discount of 7 percent.\n",

        "content": "Illinois homeowners insured by Allstate are bracing for another hit next year, as the state\u2019s second-largest provider moves forward with a round of rate increases.\nAllstate plans to raise homeowners insurance premiums in Illinois by an average of 8.8 percent beginning Feb. 24, 2026, according to a recent filing with the Illinois Department of Insurance. The increase will affect more than 209,000 policyholders statewide and comes on top of the\nNorthbrook\n-based insurer\u2019s increase of around 9 percent nearly a year ago, the Chicago Sun Times\nreported\n.\nUnder the new filing, individual\nincreases\nwill range from 4.9 percent to 10.4 percent, with the \u201ctypical\u201d homeowner seeing an 8.8 percent bump when their policy renews.\nIllinois\nlaw requires insurers to notify regulators of rate changes, but the state has limited authority to block or roll back increases, leaving consumers with little recourse.\n\u201cAllstate is the second-largest U.S. home insurer because we have accurate, competitive prices and are there for customers when they need us,\u201d the\ncompany\nsaid in a statement. \u201cIllinois rates are being driven by the state\u2019s severe weather events and higher repair costs.\u201d\nConsumer advocates aren\u2019t buying it. Abe Scarr, director of the Illinois Public Interest Research Group, called the increase excessive, telling the outlet that Allstate reported $3.7 billion in profit in the third quarter this year. He warned that Allstate\u2019s move could open the door for additional hikes from competitors.\nThe stakes are high for homeowners and the real estate market alike. Most mortgage lenders require insurance, and rising premiums can strain borrowers who are already stretched by higher interest rates, property taxes and maintenance costs. The outlet reported that in some cases, insurance costs can be the difference between a deal penciling out or not.\nAllstate\u2019s filing follows a much steeper move by State Farm, the nation\u2019s largest insurer, which implemented a 27 percent homeowners rate increase in Illinois over the summer, citing rising reconstruction costs after severe weather. That hike drew scrutiny from state officials. In November 2024, Illinois Department of Insurance Director Ann Gillespie demanded ZIP code-level policy data from State Farm, while Attorney General Kwame Raoul filed suit to compel the company to turn it over.\nThe pressure is building because homeowners were already reeling before the latest increases. A Consumer Federation of America study released in April found the typical Illinois homeowner paid about $1,000 more for coverage in 2024 than three years earlier \u2014 a roughly 50 percent jump, the second-highest increase in the country.\nEfforts to give regulators more power have stalled. A bill allowing Illinois to reject excessive rate hikes passed the state Senate last fall but died in the House.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The\nCity of San Jose\nhas given the green light to a mid-rise housing project on the city\u2019s western edge near Cupertino.\nBorello Asset Management has received the go-ahead to build a seven-story, 118-unit residential building on a 0.7-acre lot at 1000 South De Anza Boulevard, the Mercury News\nreported\n. The Morgan Hill-based firm will demolish an existing 2,658-square-foot commercial building to construct the new homes.\nBorello submitted its preliminary development application in June 2023. At the time, San Jose\u2019s housing element was not in compliance with state requirements, leaving an opportunity for the developer to take advantage of the builder\u2019s remedy process.\nUnder\nbuilder\u2019s remedy\n, any policies, ordinances, fees and standards in effect at the time of the application are locked into place. The city was also forced to evaluate the proposal as if it met land-use designation and zoning district requirements due to builder\u2019s remedy, though city project manager Alec Atienza said the project site was in a zoning district that would not allow housing unless it was 100 percent affordable or the applicant used another state law to proceed with development.\nBorello\u2019s plan calls for 44 studios, 42 one-bedroom apartments and 32 two-bedroom units. Of the 118 units, 24 will be available at 80 percent of the area\u2019s median income. In 2025, the area median income for one person in\nSanta Clara County\nis $136,650. Construction could begin early next year and take about 14 months to complete, according to an environmental impact report released earlier this year.\nThe project has faced pushback from neighbors living on nearby Ventana Place.\n\u201cIf the ground sinks or settles due to excessive vibrations or from the activity of lots of heavy equipment and machinery, the integrity of the post-tension slab at Ventana could be compromised, leading to potential catastrophic structural failures,\u201d Becky Bender, president of the Ventana Place Homeowners Association, said. \u201cThe ramifications would not only endanger the lives of Ventana Place residents, but also result in astronomical, multi-million-dollar repair costs that may not even fully restore the structure.\u201d\nErik Schoennauer, a land-use consultant representing the developer, tried to assuage those fears by noting that the environmental report included requirements to limit noise impacts and pointed out that construction vibrations wouldn\u2019t affect the nearby townhome buildings. He also addressed concerns that the seven-story building would stand out among shorter buildings along\nDe Anza Boulevard\n.\n\u201cThe city\u2019s plan is that a street like De Anza will be all seven stories some day,\u201d Schoennauer said. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan adopted by the City Council for decades, so our project, just because it\u2019s one of the earliest ones, is not out of place.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The seller was a joint venture between Metropolitan Life Insurance and New York Common Fund. The deal closed Dec. 17, and while the sale price was not disclosed, Crescent lined up $170.4 million in financing to acquire the property, deed records show.\nThe deal caps a banner year for Crescent, which also picked up the\n21-story Texas Capital Center\n. It bought the Uptown tower at 2000 McKinney Avenue from German investor Union Investment Real Estate in September.\nLed by chairman John Goff, Crescent oversees more than $10 billion in assets, according to the company. It\u2019s best known for The Crescent, the iconic mixed-use complex that anchors Uptown. The firm originally helped develop the project in the mid-1980s, later owned it in the 1990s, re-acquired it in 2009, sold it and then bought it back again in 2021 \u2014 the third time it\u2019s taken control of the trophy asset. The firm\u2019s local portfolio also includes the\nRitz-Carlton Dallas\nand Hotel Crescent Court, along with office properties at 2401 Cedar Springs and 2811 Maple Avenue.\nThe newly acquired building sits directly across the street from the Ritz-Carlton, with Klyde Warren Park just a short walk away, placing it squarely in the center of Uptown\u2019s office, hotel and luxury residential ecosystem. Developed by Trammell Crow Company in 1999 and designed by HOK, the brick building underwent a renovation in 2021.\nOne of the building\u2019s most visible tenants is CBRE, which maintains prominent signage atop the tower. The outlet reported that the brokerage recently completed an extensive overhaul of its roughly 95,000-square-foot, two-floor Dallas office inside the building, adding a steel staircase, coffee bar with a barista, concierge desk and even a hidden speakeasy. The space serves as CBRE\u2019s Dallas office, separate from its global headquarters at PwC Tower on Pearl Street.\nThe transaction is one of a number of\nblockbuster office deals in Uptown\nthis year, including the trade of\nThe Link at Uptown\n, which Atlanta-based Cousins Properties bought from Kaizen Development Partners over the summer.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The deal, disclosed in a bankruptcy court filing, is subject to being boxed out by better offers at the Jan. 8 auction.\nThe price point isn\u2019t locked in for Summit, either.

The auction plan came as a result of a bankruptcy case filed by the Wiener-connected parties in May; the bankrupt parties owe lender Flagstar more than $564 million.\nLawyers for the bankrupt entities blamed financial troubles on high interest rates, inflation in expenses, weak collections and tenant-friendly state legislation; the buildings generated more than $84 million in 2024.\nPinnacle fell behind on maintenance in the affected buildings.

Completion is expected in late 2027.\nNew York-based GoldenTree Asset Management is the lender.\nAndrew Warman, Jonathan Blank and Paton Marion of PMG Capital Markets were part of the team that brokered the financing.\nLast year, PMG, led by Ryan Shear and Dan Kaplan, paid\n$19.2 million\nfor the two-story, 16-unit\nco-op\nbuilding circa-1957 that was on the site. Across South Florida, aging co-ops and condo buildings have been quickly scooped for redevelopment in recent years.\nThe property has 200 feet of frontage to the Intracoastal Waterway and views to the Atlantic Ocean. Future development that could hinder the views is unlikely because of the Bonnet House Museum &amp; Gardens, a historic home and gardens, to the northeast of the development site.\nDesigned by Fort Lauderdale-based FSMY Architects, Sage will consist of two-, three- and four-bedroom condos, starting at 2,767 square feet, according to the release. The building will have more than 19,000 square feet of amenities, including Sage Wellness Spa.\nPMG has ramped up its luxury condo development activity in South Florida, and it\u2019s among the developers that have jumped on the branded residences trend. In downtown Miami, PMG and its partners are building the\nWaldorf Astoria-branded\nsupertall with 387 condos and 205 hotel keys.\nIn April, PMG scored a\n$413 million\nconstruction loan for One Twenty Brickell Residences with a 37-story, 266-unit condo tower and a 41-story, 537-unit apartment tower in Miami\u2019s Brickell. The project is under construction at 120 Southwest Eighth Street.\nDespite higher interest rates and a pipeline of towers threatening a potential over-saturation in the market, construction financing for luxury condos has flowed in South Florida.\u00a0Last month, Yamal Yidios\u2019 Ytech secured\n$565 million\nin financing for its 70-story, 195-unit condo tower at 1428 Brickell Avenue in Miami. Also, Edgardo Defortuna\u2019s Fortune International Group and Manuel Grosskopf\u2019s Ch\u00e2teau Group this month boosted an existing construction loan for their St. Regis Residences in Sunny Isles Beach to a total of\n$418.3 million\n. The two-tower project will have 320 condos at 18801 Collins Avenue.\n",

        "content": "A plot of land in Hollywood could be headed for redevelopment with small-lot homes and accessory dwelling units.\nAn application filed with the Los Angeles Department of City Planning calls for six single-family dwellings and six\nADUs\nfor a total of 12 homes at 855 North Orlando Avenue, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n. The applicant is 855 N Orlando LLC,\nlinked\nto Alex Irvine of Irvine &amp; Associates. The approximately 0.2-acre site currently houses a single-family home.\nThe single-family homes would range in size between 1,325 and 1,475 square feet. The ADUs would be a smaller, undetermined size on the ground floor of each dwelling. Next Architecture is designing the three-story residences, according to plans cited by Urbanize.\nThis will be the latest multifamily project in the neighborhood. One block to the west at 925 North Croft Avenue,\ndeveloper Jonathan Harouni\nhas proposed a seven-story, 33-unit residential building that would feature 33 one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments across approximately 50,000 square feet, Urbanize\nreported\n. That development would take advantage of the Citywide Housing Incentive Program, allowing a larger and taller building than what would normally be permitted by zoning rules in a neighborhood of single-family homes in exchange for a handful of affordable apartments.\nSmall-lot homes are one of the City of Los Angeles\u2019 preferred development types for parcels such as 855 North Orlando Avenue. The city\u2019s\n\u201cSmall Lots, Big Impacts\u201d initiative\nseeks to provide unique housing solutions on properties smaller than 1 acre. Officials are\nin the process of finding private developers\nto bring reimagined housing solutions to 12 city-owned properties.\nUnder its\nhousing element\n, Los Angeles must plan to build 456,643 new homes by the end of the decade. Of the more than 450,000 units, 184,721 must be designated for affordable housing. On the state level, California is pursuing a\ngoal\nof building 2.5 million new homes by 2030.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A 50-acre island on the edge of San Francisco Bay is headed for a rebirth.\nThe uninhabited Point Buckler Island in the Suisun Bay estuary will be restored to its natural, marshy state after the nonprofit John Muir Land Trust\npurchased the property early this year\nfor $3.8 million, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n.\nPoint Buckler Island\u2019s restoration ends a more than decade-long saga over its future. In 2011, entrepreneur and former America\u2019s Cup sailor John Sweeney bought the island for $150,000 and began developing what he advertised as a luxury club for kiteboarders. While building a lounge and guest quarters, he allegedly illegally rebuilt levees and interrupted the island\u2019s tidal flows, according to regulators. Sweeney denied the allegations and said that he only made repairs to existing levees. \u201cMaybe 100 years ago it was a marsh, but in the last 75 years it was a duck club and dry land,\u201d he said.\nSolano County placed a lien on the property and ordered its auction in January after Sweeney\nlisted it for sale for $75 million\nin 2023. That year, a\nSupreme Court decision\ncreated jurisdictional uncertainty by dictating which waters are federally protected. That prompted a legal battle involving Sweeney that is still ongoing, as he\u2019s asking the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn the decision that he harmed sensitive habitat under the Clean Water Act and is hoping to have the land returned. Sweeney also faces millions of dollars of fines from the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Board and an unmet order to revive the island\u2019s natural flows.\nUltimately, the John Muir Land Trust submitted the nearly $4 million winning bid.\nThe environmental nonprofit\u2019s first move will be clearing the island of human-made debris, largely from the kitesurfing club, including two helicopter pads, a dock, trailers,\nshipping containers\nand fencing.\nOnce the site is cleaned up, the plan is to start restoring the island\u2019s tidal flows. The revival effort is estimated to cost a total of about $3.5 million and take three to five years to complete.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Brazilian developer Gilberto Bomeny wants to put the brakes on Cirrus Real Estate taking over his distressed downtown Miami redevelopment site, in a predicament playing out between Christmas and New Year\u2019s.\nBomeny entities that own the parcel at\n340 Biscayne Boulevard\n, home to a Holiday Inn built in 1950, asked a Miami federal bankruptcy judge last week to throw out Cirrus\u2019\n$77 million\ncredit-bid victory and order a new auction. In a Dec. 25 motion, the entities allege that \u201cconstant changes and irregularities\u201d in the sale process shut out rival bidders.\nBomeny\u2019s request sets up a showdown before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Laurel Isicoff at a hearing set for Wednesday, Dec. 31. Isicoff will either approve Cirrus\u2019 purchase or reopen bidding for the nearly\n1-acre site\n, which has city approvals for an 82-story, 950,000-square-foot tower with 374 condos, 120 hotel rooms, offices and retail, along with 500 parking spaces.\nAttorneys for Bomeny\u2019s entities and New York-based Cirrus, led by Joseph McDonnell, did not respond to requests for comment.\nBomeny\u2019s entities paid $65 million for the 10-story hotel with 200 rooms in 2015. The owner filed for Chapter 11 protection earlier this year to stave off a\nUCC foreclosure\nby a Cirrus affiliate that alleges Bomeny\u2019s entities defaulted on a $70 million loan. When U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Laurel Isicoff authorized the auction last month, she also approved a $101.5 million credit bid by the Cirrus affiliate, which is the largest creditor.\nCirrus won the Dec. 17 auction by submitting the highest offer at $77 million.\nAttorneys for the lender sought a court order five days later to force Bomeny to sign and finalize the purchase and sale agreement. But the Bomeny entities want the judge to disregard the auction results and reschedule the sale, according to Bomeny\u2019s motion.\nThe auction, conducted by Sotheby\u2019s Concierge Auctions, was initially set to begin at 6 p.m. on Dec. 17, the filing states. But two days before the sale, the auctioneer told Bomeny it would start at 4 p.m., the Bomeny entities allege. Then the evening before, Sotheby\u2019s allegedly pushed the time up again to 2 p.m.\nOn auction day, one of Bomeny\u2019s agents tried to log in at 2 p.m. but couldn\u2019t access the platform and was told by an online support chat that bidding would actually start at 6 p.m., even though the sale in fact ran from about 2:30 p.m. to 2:50 p.m., the motion alleges.\nCirrus\nwas the only bidder to participate in the online sale. Bomeny and his lawyers only learned of the repeated time changes because they \u201ccontacted the auctioneer directly and repeatedly,\u201d and that would-be buyers had no centralized way to track the shifting schedule, the motion states.\nAfter the auction closed, Bomeny learned that \u201cseveral\u201d prospective bidders who intended to participate were unable to do so because of the last-minute time change, a lack of communication from Sotheby\u2019s and technical issues that prevented registration or payment of the registration fee, the motion alleges.\nBrokers told Bomeny they represented clients who intended to bid and \u201cstill desire to submit offers privately or through an auction,\u201d according to the motion. At least one of the bidders was going to bid almost double the $77 million amount by Cirrus, the motion alleges.\nIf the judge approves Cirrus as the winner, no other creditors would receive any proceeds from the sale of 340 Biscayne, the motion states. The Bomeny entities are requesting a new auction date for Feb. 9.",

Entities connected to Pustilnikov, Ely Dromy and Eli Taban are past due on about $39 million as of early November, according to Los Angeles County records.\nThe five-story, roughly 30,000 square-foot\nproperty\nat 1315 3rd Street Promenade is minutes away from the pier and home to Holey Moley, a mini golf-and-cocktail bar scene that has another location at Irvine Company\u2019s Irvine Spectrum. Pustinikov and his partners appear to be scouting for additional tenants with a brochure via leasing representative Matthews Real Estate Investment Services, which teases food hall availabilities.\nPustilnikov, Dromy and Taban, who are listed on various documents as co-owners and borrowers, did not respond to requests for comment.\nDromy helms Dromy International Investment Corporation, and Taban runs Big Law Partners and EJT Ventures. The Taban clan was deemed a\nroyal family\nof Los Angeles real estate by\nThe Real Deal\nnearly a decade ago.\nDromy and Pustilnikov have\npartnered\non real estate before. Three years ago, the two\npurchased\nan AMC theater in Santa Monica at 1310 3rd Street Promenade.\nThird Street Promenade has seen better days. Since the pandemic, shops, bars and restaurants have less foot traffic and more empty storefronts. The city council recently approved a proposal to let people buy alcohol from businesses and drink in the open air, but the jury is still out on whether that\u2019ll revive downtown Santa Monica.\nPustilnikov, last year, said he was working with the lender on a\ndefault\ntied to a third property in the area, retail that covers 1241 to 1247 3rd Street Promenade. The lender indicated about $19 million was past due.\nAt the time, Pustilnikov said it was difficult to refinance in that interest rate environment, which hasn\u2019t changed much despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s few rate cuts.\nThe Santa Monica default has come as Pustilnikov has been busy adding new holdings elsewhere. He recently joined with Kaveh Bral and Josh Javaheri and purchased the PacMutual, three interconnected office buildings, for less than $50 million \u2014 a steep discount compared to the $200 million Ivanhoe Cambridge, now La\u202fCaisse, paid a decade ago. That\ndowntown buy\ncame after Pustilnikov\u2019s purchase of the Original Pantry, a shuttered diner once owned by the late Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan.",

        "content": "Central Health is putting its own spin on the\noffice conversion\namid a broader push for public sector entities to own real estate rather than lease.\nThe Travis County-funded hospital district purchased the Northview Business Center, a 260,000-square-foot office building on roughly 25 acres at 9001 North I-35, according to county property records. The Austin Business Journal\nreported\nthat the deal closed Dec. 9, with the seller listed as Chicago-based Northview Owner.\nThe purchase price was not disclosed in public records, but the Travis Central Appraisal District most recently valued the site at $18.6 million for tax purposes. Internal documents signal a much larger financial commitment. Agenda materials prepared for Central Health\u2019s Oct. 22 Budget and Finance Committee meeting show the district proposed issuing $93.5 million in debt to acquire the property.\nDiscussions about the acquisition were held in closed session, but the agenda documents describe the Northview property as a\n\u201cpriority need area\u201d\nand outline plans to transform the office building into adult and pediatric\nclinical offices\n, along with clinical support space. The move is intended to help Central Health transition services out of leased facilities, though the district has not specified which clinics would relocate, according to the publication.\nThe property is not entirely vacant. About 70,000 square feet is currently leased through 2029, according to the same documents. One of the existing tenants appears to be Workforce Solutions Capital Area, based on publicly available listings tied to the address.\nThe acquisition adds to a growing list of public-sector real estate deals reshaping Central Texas, as government entities increasingly opt to buy large office properties amid softer market conditions. Travis County recently approved the use of eminent domain to acquire an\nEast Austin landfill\nit is being sued over, while the city of Austin has been especially active.\nIn recent months, the city has purchased a former motorcycle dealership, paid $87 million for Tokyo Electron\u2019s former\nSoutheast Austin campus\n, spent $107.6 million on the One and Two Barton Skyway office buildings and shelled out $41.1 million for a 143-acre tract in East Austin. It also bought a 207,000-square-foot office building at 3300 North I-35 for $26.2 million.\nCity officials have framed those acquisitions as part of a long-term strategy to control costs by owning space instead of leasing, arguing that leasing can cost roughly twice as much over time.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "In the final days of the Adams administration, officials are dangling an alternative development site in front of the team jettisoned from building housing at the Elizabeth Street Garden.\nFirst Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro gave Pennrose, Riseboro and Habitat for Humanity New York City and Westchester an ultimatum last week: If they want to develop 22 Suffolk Street, they must drop their lawsuit against the city.\nThe city-owned site is being offered in exchange for the development team abandoning its legal fight over the Elizabeth Street Garden. The city tapped the developers in 2017 to build 123 units of senior housing at the garden site, a project known as Haven Green.\nFor years, the city fended off litigation over the site\u2019s future, and after a key legal victory in 2024, the Adams administration moved forward with plans to\nevict\nthe garden. But soon after Mastro joined the administration, City Hall reversed course.\nIn June, the administration\nannounced\nthat it would leave the garden intact and would instead move forward with housing projects on three other sites: 22 Suffolk Street, 156-166 Bowery Street and 100 Gold Street. Projects on those sites, which need to be rezoned, would net thousands of housing units, including hundreds more affordable units than planned for the garden site.\nAfter Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani made clear that he would\nevict\nthe garden once in office, the Adams administration designated the city-owned site as parkland. At the time, Mamani said that undoing the action would prove nearly impossible because it would require buy-in from the state legislature.\nHowever, the development team\nsued\nthe city in November, arguing that the administration couldn\u2019t unilaterally declare the site a city park. Such a land-use change would need to go through the city\u2019s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, or Ulurp, which is required to map land as a city park, according to the lawsuit.\nIn a letter sent to the development team on Friday, Mastro said the city will designate the companies as the developers of 200 affordable housing units at 22 Suffolk Street as long as they drop their lawsuit by Dec. 31.\nIf the team doesn\u2019t abandon its lawsuit, the city will find another development partner, the letter states.\nMessages to representatives and attorneys for the developers were not immediately returned. A City Hall spokesperson could not immediately provide an explanation as to why the development of the Suffolk site was not decided by a public bidding process.\n\u201cWe hope this group of developers accepts our offer, so together, we can deliver on the Adams administration\u2019s promise to provide a win-win solution for the Elizabeth Street Garden \u2013 preserving cherished community green space while also building far more affordable housing than the 123 units originally contemplated at the garden site alone,\u201d Mastro said in a statement.\nOn Monday, the administration also announced that it had reached a licensing agreement with the nonprofit Elizabeth Street Garden to continue operating the park through the next 10 years, with the option of two five-year extensions.\nThe nonprofit has also agreed to pay $100,000 it owes in back rent for the site, in 10 annual installments over the next decade (the first $10,000 payment is due this week).\nIt\u2019s not clear how the development team will proceed. In November, the developers agreed to\npause\ntheir lawsuit as they negotiated with the city over the Suffolk site. In a Dec. 19 letter, the administration authorized the development team to seek financing for the Suffolk site, but Mastro said the lawsuit \u201cmaterially undermines the City\u2019s ability to maintain the confirmations of support and approvals necessary to advance the Suffolk Street project.\u201d\nHe was referring to an agreement reached with Council member Chris Marte to ensure his support of rezoning the Suffolk Street site, as well as the other planned rezonings, in exchange for leaving Elizabeth Street Garden alone.\nMarte was the sole Manhattan Council member to vote against the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity and previously spoke out against the rezoning planned for 100 Gold Street. Mastro said the three substitute projects would be dead on arrival without Marte\u2019s support, though the passage of ballot measures that\nweaken\nthe City Council\u2019s tradition of member deference may have changed the power dynamics for these rezonings.\nThe Adams administration\u2019s reversal on the Elizabeth Street Garden project raised questions about the risk of partnering with the city on projects. It also traded a project that was closer to shovel-ready for three that need to go through the city\u2019s land-use review process and will be the responsibility of the next administration to push forward.\nThe project\u2019s trajectory also complicates Adams\u2019 housing legacy, which included several initiatives aimed at building more housing throughout the city. The decision to drop Haven Green drew sharp criticism from housing groups, elected officials and developers who saw it as a hypocritical acquiescence to wealthy and celebrity interests.\nProponents of the garden saw the deal with Marte as a vindication of their long-standing argument that the city could find other, better sites for housing while leaving the park alone.\n",

The homes that went pending last week totaled $54.4 million in asking dollar volume and averaged 118 days on the market.\nThe previous week\n, buyers signed 19 contracts totaling $305 million in asking dollar volume, led by a pending deal for a waterfront Coconut Grove estate asking $115 million.\nThe report tracks signed contracts for single-family homes and condos included on the Multiple Listing Service asking $4 million or more in Miami-Dade County. It identified 19 new listings, and a total of 1,315 active listings on the market.\nFive of the properties that went pending last week were single-family homes, and three were condos. The average asking price for the condos is $6.3 million, or $2,318 per square foot. They spent an average of 72 days on the market.\nThe average asking price for the single-family homes is $7.1 million, or $1,762 per square foot, and they spent an average of 145 days on the market.\nThe most expensive listing to find a buyer last week was the 3,900-square-foot house at 2830 Lucerne Avenue in Miami Beach asking $9 million. Records show the seller is Daniel R. Morel, who bought the Sunset Island I home for $4.7 million in 2015. Built in 1936 on 0.3 acres, the house has four bedrooms, four bathrooms, one half-bathroom and a pool, according to property records.\nIt hit the market asking $9.9 million in February, and Nancy Batchelor and Carolyn Batchelor with Compass had the listing.\nThe next priciest home to go pending was the 4,700-square-foot home at 3470 Poinciana Avenue in\nCoconut Grove\nasking $8 million. Records show the sellers are Brian Lippey and Jacqueline MacLeod, who bought the house for $3.8 million in 2020. It was built that year on a quarter acre, and includes five bedrooms, six bathrooms, one half-bathroom\nLippey and MacLeod first listed it last year for $8.8 million, and Riley Smith and Brian Sehmann with Compass had the listing.\n",

        "content": "Another surface parking lot in River North is officially on the clock.\nA full building permit has been issued for ZSD\u2019s mixed-use development at 310 West Huron Street, paving the way for construction to begin on a 149-unit residential project with ground-floor retail. The site, which stretches along Huron Street from Franklin Street to Orleans Street, is currently occupied by a parking lot \u2014 a fading but still familiar sight in one of downtown Chicago\u2019s most built-out neighborhoods, Urbanize Chicago\nreported\n.\nWith caisson and foundation permits already in hand, the final approval allows ZSD, described as a boutique real estate developer on its website, to build the project from top to bottom.\nZSD\n, led by\nZev Salomon\n, bought the parcel for $9 million in April, acquiring it from North Wells Capital, which paid nearly double that price in 2019 and had once pitched a 24-story office building for the site.\nConstruction is expected to kick off imminently, with completion targeted for 2027.\nThe building will occupy nearly the entire site, broken only by a narrow strip of green space along\nNorth Orleans Street\nand a small portion of the western edge carved off into a separate parcel. Urbanize reported that the massing is a clean rectangle, articulated with a mix of facade treatments intended to break down its scale. Plans call for black and dark gray standing-seam siding, random-pattern box rib metal panels and brick cladding at the first two floors, including at the main entry and along the ground-floor residential units.\nStreet-level tenants will be\u00a0 concentrated along Franklin and Huron. Two retail spaces will anchor the corner, while the residential entry sits just west of the storefronts. Inside, residents will access a lobby, management office, package and mail rooms and bike storage.\nThe western end of the ground floor is reserved for 11 duplex units, a design choice that brings a more townhouse-like feel to the block. Those units will feature recessed private terraces facing both the street and the alley, buffered from pedestrians by screening and planters rather than blank walls.\nThe 149 apartments skew toward smaller layouts, reflecting both\nRiver North\ndemand and current financing realities. The mix includes 48 studios and 78 one-bedrooms, alongside 12 two-bedrooms. The duplex inventory adds seven one-bedroom and four two-bedroom units.\nAmenities are stacked at the top of the building, where residents will have access to an indoor lounge, private gathering space, coworking area and fitness center. An outdoor roof deck rounds out the package with lounge seating, fire pits and grilling areas.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Avdoo is looking to capitalize on a rising corner of Lower Manhattan.\nShlomi Avdoo\u2019s firm paid $63 million for a 12,500-square-foot lot on the corner of King and Varick streets in the Hudson Square neighborhood. Valley National Bank financed the purchase with a $40 million loan.\nThe site has over 125,000 square feet of development rights. Avdoo plans to pursue additional floor area through air-rights deals and a transit-related bonus tied to infrastructure improvements.\nThe final shape of the project will depend on the additional development rights Avdoo secures, but the developer said he is targeting high-end residential spanning more than 200,000 square feet.\n\u201cThe neighborhood is changing so quickly, and there\u2019s really no supply,\u201d said Avdoo.\nHudson Square, a newly minted Lower Manhattan neighborhood that sits adjacent to Tribeca, Soho and the West Village, has emerged as an appealing area for developers looking to capitalize on the wealthy buyers\nflocking to downtown\nin recent years.\nAvdoo\u2019s site at 68 King Street falls just outside of the Greenwich Village Historic District, which has limited most residential development on the west side.\n\u201cWhen you look at people who want to live Downtown, who want to live in Soho, want to live in the West Village, they don\u2019t have many options,\u201d Avdoo said. Because of the limited development options in the area, Avdoo said securing the site was \u201cone of the most competitive processes\u201d he\u2019s seen.\nThe site is blocks away from where major corporations like\nGoogle and Disney\nhave set up shop in recent years, one of the biggest factors that has enticed not just developers, but restaurateurs and retailers to look at opening stores in the once-sleepy neighborhood.\nAvdoo\u2019s purchase also comes after nearly one year of sales at\n80 Clarkson\n, the ultra-luxury development from Atlas Capital Group and Zeckendorf Development that is also just a few blocks from 68 King.\nWhile the building has not yet publicly shared sales numbers, the 112-unit development has reportedly been a\nmagnet for wealthy buyers\ntrying to enter the Downtown market. Earlier this month, the building put multiple units into contract for\n$129 million\n, which would far surpass previous sales records Downtown if the deal closes at that price.\nFor Avdoo, the deal is the latest in a string of activity across Manhattan and Brooklyn. In February, the firm paid\n$52 million\nfor five buildings on the Upper East Side, its first project in the neighborhood.\nIt has also launched sales at its 21-unit development at\n110 Boerum Place\nin Cobble Hill and started closings at the\nBergen\n, a 105-unit project at 323 Bergen Street in Boerum Hill.\n",

        "content": "BlockGen founder and CEO Bill Roy sold his condo at Continuum in South Beach for $23.9 million last week, just four years after buying it for half that.\nRoy sold the combined units 2803 and 2804 at 100 South Pointe Drive in Miami Beach to MB Continuum Trust, managed by Patrick Conroy, according to property records. The price amounts to $5,004 per square foot.\nConroy is a managing director and chair of the securities and finance practice at NERA Economic Consulting in New York City. Roy\u2019s Miami-based BlockGen is a fintech startup focused on blockchain products for the mortgage industry. He previously founded the private equity division of JAM Partners, according to published reports.\nRoy bought the Continuum condo for\n$12.1 million\nin 2021, property records show.\nThe 4,800-square-foot unit includes three bedrooms, three bathrooms and one half-bathroom. It is in the Continuum\u2019s 42-story south tower, which Ian Bruce Eichner developed in 2002. He completed the 37-story north tower in 2008. Since then, it has attracted high-profile buyers from across industries. Last year, financier Jim Chanos, who famously shorted Enron, sold his unit for\n$17.8 million\n.\nThe beachfront complex totals 521 units and includes two pools, three tennis courts and an oceanfront restaurant.\nRoy listed his unit for $25.9 million in March and took it off the market in July. It closed off market.\nIt is the latest pricey condo sale in Miami-Dade County in recent months. Earlier this month, Fort Partners sold an oceanfront penthouse at its Seaway at the Surf Club in Surfside for\n$86 million\n, a record price for the county. Shortly after, Fort sold a pair of units to billionaire Pablo Legorreta for\na combined $68.7 million\n.On Fisher Island, Andrew Zaro of the Zaro\u2019s Bakery family in New York\npaid $35.2 million\nfor a penthouse at Palazzo Del Sol this month, making it the private island\u2019s most expensive condo sale this year.",

The records reportedly found dozens of instances in which inspectors flagged crews for allegedly cutting corners, including dumping ash on neighboring parcels, reusing contaminated soil and leaving debris buried on sites cleared for reconstruction.\nEnvironmental Chemical Corporation denied authorizing such practices.\n\u201cAt a high level, ECC does not authorize the placement of wildfire debris or ash on neighboring properties, does not permit the use of contaminated material as fill, and operates under continuous [Army Corps] oversight,\u201d Glenn Sweatt, the Burlingame-based company\u2019s vice president of contracts and compliance, told the Times.\nOverall, FEMA and the Army Corps allocated $60 million to hire personnel to monitor daily cleanup operations and document any health and safety risks observed in the Eaton and Palisades burn zones between February and May.\nOne report cited an April incident in the\nPacific Palisades\nwhere inspectors said workers ordered by an Environmental Chemical Corporation official moved several buckets of fire debris onto an adjacent property after a cleanup truck had already departed. Other reports described crews using ash-contaminated soil to fill holes on fire-damaged properties, which would be a direct violation of state policy prohibiting contaminated material from being reused on site. Inspectors also cited workers for recontaminating cleared lots by walking through them with dirty boot covers, spraying polluted pool water onto neighboring properties and into storm drains and mixing clean and toxic soil with improper excavation equipment.\nThe Army Corps responded to nearly 1,100 public complaints related to the\nfederal fire cleanup\nbetween February and September. More than 20 percent of those were related to quality of work, with some of them aligning with the same issues inspectors pointed out, according to the Army Corps.\nU.S. Rep. Brad Sherman, who represents Los Angeles, wants authorities to investigate further.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to press the Army Corps to look at where the testing indicates there [were] still contaminants and who is the contractor for that, to see whether there are certain contractors that had a high failure rate,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cI want to make sure they\u2019re\u2026 evaluating these contractors vis-\u00e0-vis the next disaster.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Lift Partners is buying back an industrial building in the Peninsula after four years under different ownership.\nThe San Francisco-based firm acquired 100 Utah Avenue in South San Francisco in a sale-leaseback deal for $31.8 million, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nThe seller of the 4.4-acre property was Goodwill San Francisco Bay, which anchors the site and holds a short-term lease there. Lift owned the 120,000-square-foot building from 2018 to 2021 before selling it to\nGoodwill\n.\nLift Partners\u2019 purchase of the property comes after the company closed its fourth discretionary fund, which provided Lift with about $500 million in new capital to deploy for acquisitions such as these. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on hyper-infill opportunities along the West Coast \u2014 Southern California and the Bay Area right now,\u201d Patrick Fisher, a managing partner at Lift, told the Business Times, noting the influx of \u201ca diverse mix of tenants.\u201d\nLift has made a play in the Peninsula in the past. In 2022, the real estate firm paid approximately $10.8 million for a vacant 39,560-square-foot industrial building at\n3575 Haven Avenue in Menlo Park\n. It bought that property using its third discretionary fund, valued at $205 million. The company also owns the 21,906-square-foot 2500 Old Middlefield Way building in Mountain View, which it acquired in 2018.\nThe Peninsula industrial property market has been attracting large investors as logistics space becomes an increasingly hot commodity in the Bay Area. Last month,\nPrologis\n\u2014 the world\u2019s largest industrial real estate company \u2014 spent $314.5 million for an 11-building portfolio in\nCrocker Industrial Park in Brisbane\n, the neighboring city north of South San Francisco. That transaction marked the largest industrial property deal in the Bay Area this year.\nAs of the end of the third quarter, the Peninsula had about 800,000 square feet of active industrial tenant demand, according to CBRE data cited by the Business Journal. Industrial availability was approximately 7 percent and vacancy was about 5.5 percent, which are notably low figures when compared to the rest of the region, per CBRE. At the same time, industrial supply in the Peninsula has continued to shrink.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A champion of\ndowntown Dallas\nis walking away from one of the urban core\u2019s most ambitious redevelopment projects.\nDeveloper Shawn Todd\u2019s firm, Todd Interests is selling its ownership stake in the East Quarter district to partner J.P. Morgan Asset Management, effectively exiting the 20-acre project they launched in 2018. Dallas Morning News got\nconfirmation\nof the deal from Todd, who told the outlet that it is expected to close imminently. Financial terms were not disclosed.\nThe move hands full control of the growing district on the eastern edge of downtown to the global asset manager and marks the end of a partnership that began in 2018. East Quarter was developed by Todd alongside his sons, Philip Todd, the firm\u2019s CEO, and Patrick Todd, a partner at the company.\nOver several years,\nTodd Interests\nassembled more than 30 properties across eight city blocks, stitching together a mix of 1920s and 1930s-era buildings along Cesar Chavez Boulevard, Commerce Street and Jackson Street. The firm repositioned the former industrial and warehouse stock into offices, restaurants and creative space, aiming to bridge downtown\u2019s core with Deep Ellum\u2019s nightlife and residential growth. It also built the 20-story office tower at 300 South Pearl Street.\nThe redevelopment of the East Quarter benefited from the nearby revamp of the Dallas Farmers Market, in which a coalition of investors turned four neglected sheds sitting on 17 underused acres into an open-air pavilion, a food hall, retail and multifamily.\nHow much J.P. Morgan is paying for Todd\u2019s stake remains unclear, but the district is no small asset. Tax records and estimates from Partners Real Estate senior vice president Steve Triolet indicate the district could be worth anywhere from $200 million to more than $300 million, depending on assumptions around income and future development.\nThe buyout comes as J.P. Morgan wraps up its involvement in another high-profile Dallas investment. It acquired a 60 percent stake in\nNorthPark Center\nin 2014 for $362 million. That partnership ended earlier this year, when J.P. Morgan was bought out of its interest in the luxury shopping center.\nThe exit comes after a string of major, capital-intensive downtown projects for Todd Interests. The firm led the roughly $300 million renovation of\nEnergy Plaza\n, rebranding the 49-story, I.M. Pei\u2013designed tower as The Sinclair and converting it into a mix of residential and office space. Todd and partners also spearheaded the $460 million redevelopment of the First National Bank tower, transforming the historic skyscraper into apartments, offices, retail and a luxury hotel.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "What do luggage carts have to do with real estate? Glad you asked.\nIf you can understand politics and economics, you can understand much of what happens in the world. A common sentiment in New York politics is that people should get things for less than they cost, or even free. This explains rent stabilization, at least\nsince 2019\n.\nBut today\u2019s example is the humble airport luggage cart.\nTim Wu, the semi-famous Columbia professor (of law, not economics),\ntweeted\nthat a $6 fee for carts at Kennedy Airport \u201cjust feels extractive\u201d to a family with a lot of luggage.\n\u201cNothing says \u2018welcome to the land of the price gouge\u2019 like the JFK $6 fee for the luggage carts that are free in the rest of the civilized world,\u201d he wrote.\nFirst of all, America is not \u201cthe land of the price gouge.\u201d Lots of things \u2014 gas, gadgets, groceries, blue jeans \u2014 are\ncheaper here\nthan in other developed countries.\nSecond, the $6 fee for luggage carts makes perfect sense. It ensures that people who truly value carts will be able to get them and are the only ones paying for them.\nA basic rule of economics is that the less something costs, the more it will be used. If carts were free or underpriced, more travelers would grab one. That would lead to a shortage, as it has for rent-stabilized apartments.\nA cart shortage would be a problem for people who overpacked or failed to buy luggage with wheels. They would rather pay $6 than struggle to find a cart.\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airports, might respond to a shortage by adding carts. This would result in induced demand, just like widening a highway draws more vehicles to it. You end up with more congestion, be it vehicles on the interstate or luggage carts at baggage claim.\nThe extra carts would also add cost. Lots of \u201cfree\u201d luggage carts would not really be free.\nJay Martin of the New York Apartment Association likes to say, \u201cSomeone has to pay for the housing.\u201d The same is true for luggage carts.\nThe Port Authority, like landlords, is self-funded, not subsidized. If it bought more carts, or paid a vendor to supply \u201cfree\u201d carts, it would pass the cost on to all airport travelers \u2014 even those who don\u2019t use carts \u2014 in the form of ticket fees.\nBesides, a $6 fee for a useful item isn\u2019t \u201cextractive.\u201d What is? Forcing travelers to pay for carts that they don\u2019t use.\nIf the government subsidizes something for a select group of people, that thing should benefit society on the whole. Affordable housing does. Luggage carts, not so much.\n",

        "content": "A Hill Country town has moseyed into a race\ntypically dominated by fast-paced Dallas\n.\nFor the first time all year, a home in Fredericksburg has landed on the top 10 list of the most expensive new residential listings in the state, according to the Houston Association of Realtors.\nRetired banker Don Hanna and philanthropist Gwen Hanna are asking $7.5 million for their 10-acre property 6,200-square-foot home at 371 Achtzehn Road in Fredericksburg, about $1,200 per square foot. Built in 2022, the five-bedroom, six-bathroom home evokes traditional Hill Country architecture, making use of local limestone for most of the home and reclaimed barn wood for the den. The 10-acre property is down the road from Boot Ranch country club and about 6 miles north of downtown Fredericksburg.\nFredericksburg, a town about 80 miles west of Austin, is a\npopular destination spot for family tourism\n, thanks to the region\u2019s quaint architecture, scenic views, thriving\nwine industry\nand country music history. Listing agent Susan Barringer with Austin-based Kuper Sotheby\u2019s International Realty noted the property\u2019s potential as a luxury rental.\nThe most expensive luxury sales this year to date have taken place in\nDallas\n, which usually takes the top spot in HAR\u2019s monthly ranking. The priciest new listing of the month has been in Dallas seven times this year, and\nthe most expensive listing in the state\n\u2014 a 15.7-acre estate in Preston Hollow asking $64 million \u2014 is in Dallas. Houston follows close behind with a $60 million listing. Almost all lower-ranking listings are situated on the perimeter of the Texas Triangle, bound by Interstates 35, 10 and 45.\nWhile Fredericksburg rarely competes with Texas\u2019 big cities in residential luxury, it fields some heavy-hitting contenders in the ranch market. Nearby ranches for sale include the\nJL Bar Ranch, Resort &amp; Spa\n, a 4,600-property which draws between 7,000 and 10,000 guests a year, and the\n3 Creeks Ranch\n, a recreational 886-acre property asking $42.5 million.\nFredericksburg\u2019s Main Street, the town\u2019s primary tourist shopping hub, has attracted significant investment from\nDC Partners\n, which plans to develop a 22-acre mixed-use project by 2027.\n",

        "content": "Israeli billionaire Idan Ofer started the year with an acquisition of a Financial District office building. He\u2019s ending the year with plans in place for Manhattan\u2019s next big conversion.\nOfer\u2019s Quantum Pacific Group and Nathan Berman\u2019s Metro Loft Management filed plans for a 614-unit office-to-residential conversion at 101 Greenwich Street, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The partners bought the 26-story property from BentallGreenOak in February for\nmore than $100 million\n.\nQuantum Pacific could not be reached for comment by the publication, while Metro Loft did not respond to a request for comment.\nQuantum Pacific and Metro Loft already work together elsewhere. Last November, Ofer partnered with Berman\non an $88 million purchase\nof 767 Third Avenue, representing Ofer\u2019s first investment in U.S. commercial real estate. The purchase closed with a $55 million loan from Bank Hapoalim, charting a course for a conversion.\nThe conversion filing for 101 Greenwich was first reported by\nPincusCo\n.\nBGO acquired the building with Cove Property Group and Multi-Employer Property Trust from Kushner Companies and CIM Group in 2016\nfor $225 million\n. Shortly thereafter, ownership embarked on a $70 million renovation.\nTenants at the 400,000-square-foot building have included Independence Point Advisors, Moment Technology and Pro Shop Holdings, according to\nCompStak\n. A few months ago, BGO\nsued\nflex workspace provider Convene, alleging it owes it $10.6 million after failing to make rent payments since February.\nIt\u2019s been a busy end of 2025 for Berman, one of the most prominent office-to-residential converters in New York City. Last week, Metro Loft and InterVest Capital Partners scored\n$779 million\nin financing for their conversion of 111 Wall Street in the Financial District, part of the largest office-to-residential financing package in city history.\nOther prominent FiDi conversion projects in the works include a Metro Loft development at 25 Water Street, as well as projects at 55 Broad Street and One Wall Street.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A handful of prominent players in South Florida\u2019s real estate world spent 2025 in courtrooms, tangled in legal skirmishes that pitted power brokers, luxury brands and even a presidential legacy project against a cast of scorned investors, ousted owners and activist plaintiffs.\nA developer fended off anonymous smear campaigns. A builder accused investors of a hostile takeover of a project. A disgraced lawyer accused his former employers, a Miami\u00a0 Beach real estate power couple, of turning him into a scapegoat in a public corruption probe. And one of Miami\u2019s most prominent residential brokers and his wife settled a wrongful death lawsuit by the family of a college student that his wife ran over.\nHere are the 10 juiciest South Florida lawsuits reported by\nThe Real Deal\nin 2025:\nTrump library land deal lands in court\nThe most high-profile legal fight over South Florida real estate involved a downtown Miami parking lot adjacent to the Freedom Tower linked to the 45th and 47th U.S. president, Donald Trump.\nLocal historian and activist Dr. Marvin Dunn sued Miami Dade College in November over its board of trustees handing over the 2.6-acre site \u2014 free of charge \u2014 for a potential Trump presidential library within a nearly $1 billion mixed-use project. Dunn accused the college\u2019s trustees of violating Florida\u2019s public records and public meetings laws by quietly approving the September transfer with vague notices and little discussion.\nMiami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Mavel Ruiz issued a temporary injunction and set an August 2026 trial. But this month, the college held a do-over vote at a packed public hearing that was broadly advertised. The board again unanimously backed the transfer to a state board controlled by Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida\u2019s four Cabinet members, all of whom have already committed to transferring the land to the nonprofit foundation raising money for the presidential library project.\nRuiz ruled the second vote cured the violations and lifted the injunction. Her decision allowed the parcel, which reportedly has a market value of $60 million-plus, to move one step closer into Trump-branded history.\nThe Centners\u2019 \u201cfall guy\u201d\nJanuary brought fresh legal trouble for David and Leila Centner, the politically connected private school operators and real estate investors. The Miami Beach couple, who own Centner Academy and have significant commercial real estate holdings in Miami, allegedly let their former lawyer and lobbyist William Riley Jr. \u201ctake the fall\u201d for bribery and money laundering charges that state prosecutors brought against him last year, a pending lawsuit alleges. The criminal charges against him were dropped.\nRiley is suing his former clients for damages over the loss of his reputation, his ability to practice law and the expenses he incurred while fighting the criminal charges since his arrest in 2023.\nRiley was accused of funnelling $245,000 in illegal campaign contributions from a Centner entity to a political committee controlled by then-Miami City Commissioner Alex Diaz de la Portilla, who was also arrested and charged with bribery and money laundering. The affidavit contains excerpts of sworn statements by the Centners distancing themselves from the donations and the entity. The case was dropped after prosecutors determined the contributions were, in fact, legal.\nRiley claims Leila Centner directed him to open the entity\u2019s bank account, use it to buy real estate and fund political action committees. He alleges he followed her \u201cspecific and detailed instructions\u201d on contributions.\u200b His lawsuit accuses the Centners of never making an effort to clear his name.\nDe la Vegas face wrongful death suit\nIn February, One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty president Daniel de la Vega and his wife, Veronica Bilbao de la Vega, were hit with a wrongful death lawsuit over a fatal crash that killed University of Miami student Daniel Bishop near Coral Gables Senior High School.\nBishop\u2019s estate, led by his parents, Susan and Jason Bishop, filed the complaint in Miami-Dade Circuit Court. The Bishops allege Bilbao de la Vega negligently turned her husband\u2019s Cadillac Escalade into a crosswalk and struck their son, who was riding an electric scooter. Bishop\u2019s family also accused Daniel de la Vega of negligent entrustment of the vehicle.\nBilbao de la Vega was charged with failure to use due care, a traffic violation, and a second degree misdemeanor of driving with an expired license, court filings show. She pleaded no contest to the charges, and she received probation in January. A Miami-Dade judge ordered her to pay the maximum fine of $1,000, plus court costs, and serve 500 hours of community service.\nThe family and the couple reached a private settlement, and the civil case was dismissed this month.\nMystery smear campaign targets Michael Stern\nAn unknown Internet hater is out to get Michael Stern. In April, Stern and his JDS Development Group sued a John Doe in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, alleging an anonymous rival orchestrated an online smear campaign accusing Stern of fraud.\nThe operator behind JDSpulse.com and affiliated social media accounts allegedly claimed Stern has a \u201cdocumented criminal history\u201d and that his business is \u201cplagued by unethical practices, financial misconduct, and fraudulent dealings.\u201d Stern flatly denied the allegations, and is suing for unspecified damages in his defamation complaint.\nThough the website has since gone dark, the suit says the posts triggered \u201cunpleasant conversations\u201d with investors and seeks to unmask the perpetrator to recover the damages. The complaint is pending.\nElliman clashes with Eichner\u2019s Continuum\nDouglas Elliman had a hard time breaking up with developer Ian Bruce Eichner\u2019s Continuum Company.\nIn January, the brokerage sued a Continuum affiliate that took over sales for a 32-story, 198-unit condominium Eichner is building in North Bay Village.\nThe lawsuit, filed in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, accused Continuum of poaching agents Ruben Alvarez and Karla De La Torre after the developer fired Elliman as the exclusive brokerage for the planned Continuum Club &amp; Residences.\nContinuum breached its contract with Elliman by hiring Alvarz and De La Torre without Elliman\u2019s consent, triggering a $200,000-per-breach clawback, the lawsuit alleged. The brokerage is seeking $400,000 in damages under a marketing agreement.\nElliman and Continuum reached a private settlement that still needs a judge\u2019s signoff, a recent court filing states.\nJustin \u200bRundle versus Canero Group\nA bitter partnership fallout led investor Justin Rundle, son of Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle, to fire off a legal torpedo against Canero Group principals Jose Canero Sr. and his son Jose Jr., nearly wrecking the growing development firm\u2019s project pipeline.\nRundle sued the Caneros and their firm in Miami-Dade Circuit Court in May, alleging his business partners engaged in a scheme in which they allegedly used project funds to pay their company\u2019s expenses without authorization from Rundle and other investors, while also unnecessarily delaying the projects.\nCanero Group began as a luxury home builder but expanded into multifamily and townhome development in recent years. Rundle began investing in 2023 and brought on other investors to fund six Canero Group projects, the complaint states. He sought damages in excess of $3 million.\nThe Caneros denied any wrongdoing and accused Rundle of violating Florida bar conflict of interest rules involving lawyers getting into business with clients. Rundle reached a settlement with the Caneros in October. He walked back his fraud allegations after an independent third-party accountant found no fraud or misappropriation of funds, according to a Rundle spokesperson.\nPrive Group flips the script\nUsually, investors are the ones lining up to accuse South Florida developers of bait-and-switch tactics. But a January lawsuit by Prive Group and CEO Javier Rabinovich aims to flip the antagonists in that familiar script.\nTheir lawsuit in Miami-Dade Circuit Court seeks $20 million in damages from six Peruvian investors and their firm YVY Project Management, claiming they attempted a hostile takeover of an Aventura condo site and a Fort Lauderdale apartment project after Prive secured zoning approvals.\nPrive, known for an Aventura office condo and the Uptown Biscayne mixed-use project, also slapped lis pendens on the two development sites to block any sale while the dispute plays out.\nHowever, the case was placed on inactive status in April, court records show.\nBrickell condo in legal seige\nFed-up owners of a condo complex at 1060 Brickell voted late last year to oust board president Jacob Kassel, spawning a legal tussle that\u2019s raged since January.\nFollowing a $21 million special assessment and the elimination of electronic voting, unit owner Kimberly Spahr and fellow residents sued in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, alleging the Kassel-led condo association improperly canceled the election on the pretext of too few candidates. The complaint alleges the board wrongly disqualified Spahr over a \u201cmonetary obligation\u201d rather than an unpaid assessment, contrary to state law.\nBacked financially and politically by roughly 180 owners, about a third of the two-tower development\u2019s ownership, the plaintiffs are asking a judge to restore the ballot box \u2014 and strip Kassel of power. The case is pending.\nSupermodel fights Fisher Island bigwigs\nSupermodel Karolina Kurkova and her husband, actor and broker Archie Drury, sued the Fisher Island Club in February, accusing it of illegal strong-arming and intimidation that forced them off one of the country\u2019s richest ZIP codes.\nThe complaint alleges the board has been operating under invalid bylaws. Two directors \u2014 Douglas Elliman chairman David Chene and fellow Elliman board member Mark Zeitchick \u2014 used their positions to steer lucrative work to their brokerage on Fisher Island\u2019s last big development site, the lawsuit claims. Kurkova and Drury, recently expelled from the club, allege the board smeared Drury, leveraged threats and bent governance rules to sideline the couple while positioning Elliman as the lead broker on remaining prime land.\nFisher Island Club dismissed the allegations as the gripes of \u201cdisgruntled former members.\u201d\nThe complaint is pending.\nPalm Beach Shores developers dragged over $4.9M\nThe courtroom battles for the developers of a troubled Palm Beach Shores project keep piling up. In January, investor Daniel Perla sued the team behind a planned three-building, 15-unit condominium complex in Palm Beach Circuit Court.\nPerla alleges developers Marc Shulman, Anthony Shafer and a web of entities stiffed him on $4.9 million in loans that were supposed to help fund the project\u2019s construction. The complaint states Perla extended two high-interest loans \u2014 a $2 million note at 15 percent in 2021 and another $2 million at 10 percent in 2022. The complaint is pending.\nAlden Global accused of a multi-million shortchange\nJoseph Miller, a longtime lieutenant to Alden Global Capital boss Randall Smith, accused his ex-employer in January of stiffing him out of millions of dollars.\nMiller sued Alden\u2019s real estate arm Twenty Lake Holdings and an affiliate of hotel developer Blue Suede Hospitality in Delaware court over what he calls a lowball buyout on a national portfolio of hotels and warehouses.\nMiller alleges he spent more than a decade growing the real estate business, earning a 10 percent stake in Twenty Lake and a 3 percent stake in two Blue Suede hotels in Miami Beach and Charlottesville. After he split with Smith and Alden Global, Miller was offered $3.5 million for his equity and $2 million for his hotel interests, which Miller alleged is \u201cnot remotely credible or appropriate.\u201d\nThe complaint pegs the book value of his Twenty Lake stake at more than $15 million based on an August valuation of 88 properties. Miller also said third-party appraisals could push his entitlement north of $26 million, setting up a high-stakes valuation fight.\n\u200b",

        "content": "A\nHolmby Hills\nmansion tied to a business management firm to the stars topped last week\u2019s additions to the local high-end inventory.\nThat\u2019s according to the weekly report compiled by Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team, which counts new active listings and homes under contract in Los Angeles County. The\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\nfactors in only homes listed in the Multiple Listing Service with an asking price of at least $4 million.\nThe resort-inspired estate at 145 North Mapleton Drive, which is listed by Compass\u2019\nGinger Glass\n, is asking $48 million. That pencils out to $3,127 per square foot.\nThe over 15,000-square-foot property sits on nearly a 1-acre lot and last traded in 2020 for $36.5 million, or $2,378 per square foot. That was when a limited liability company called Maple Living purchased the home, striking a deal on a property that first hit the market for $55 million in 2019, according to property records and listing sites.\nMaple Living is managed by Tri Star Sports &amp; Entertainment, according to records obtained through PropertyShark. The West Hollywood firm represents actors, athletes, artists and other high-net-worth clients and has reportedly been linked to stars such as Britney Spears and Kim Kardashian in the past. Earlier this year, the company acquired Miami business management firm LRW Group for an undisclosed sum.\nThe Mapleton Drive home is big on privacy with the property behind 12-foot-tall gates and a guard house with its own kitchen and bathroom. In all, the home counts seven bedrooms and 14 bathrooms with a chef\u2019s kitchen, bar, pool cabanas and home theater.\nAmong last week\u2019s signed contracts was a Malibu home that claimed the No. 1 spot in the Eklund Gomes report, with a listing price of $7.5 million, or $2,707 per square foot.\nThe 1978-built beach house at 6649 Zumirez Drive, with its own private access to Little Dume, is owned by a trust tied to producers Paul Taublieb and Susan Cooper.\nThe Emmy Award winners paid $740,000 for the home in 1996. The duo is behind the documentary \u201cUnchained: The Untold Story of Freestyle Motocross\u201d and \u201cThe Vow,\u201d a movie starring Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams.\nColdwell Banker Realty\u2019s Susan Monus holds the listing.\nTaublieb and Cooper initially asked just under $8 million for the home in September, before reducing the price to $7.5 million in November.\nThe home sits on an over 1-acre lot and counts three beds and three baths across 2,752 square feet.\nOverall, Los Angeles County saw five residential properties added to the for-sale inventory in the week, according to the\nEklund Gomes report\n. Meanwhile, a dozen homes went into contract, which was good for $66.5 million in asking volume. That\u2019s a spike of well over 200 percent compared to the same time last year.\n",

        "content": "Whether Chicago\u2019s real estate dealmakers got the rebound they wanted in 2025 depends on who you ask.\nLuxury residential brokers would say it was one of the\nbest years of their careers\n, and the city\u2019s\nbiggest brokerage\nwas officially absorbed by an even bigger one from New York.\nYet commercial developers and office landlords are still mostly on the sidelines, with only a\nselect few\ngetting back into the game.\nTrophy office towers are roaring again,\nmegaprojects stirred back to life\nand the Midwest\u2019s multifamily landlords are riding some of the\nstrongest rent growth in the nation\n\u2014 a result of dropoffs in new construction that nonetheless helped stave off lenders.\nStill, plenty of players, tenants and banks were\nrattled by distress\n, and lawsuits containing allegations of foul play and fraud flew back and forth.\nThese were Chicago\u2019s juiciest real estate stories of 2025.\nOffice market shows signs of life\nAfter years of headlines about distress and record vacancies, Chicago\u2019s office sector gained real momentum in 2025 \u2014 though only at the top end.\nThe biggest splash came at\nSalesforce Tower\n, where developers Hines and Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises landed a $610 million refinancing. That deal preceded a string of subleases, including space Salesforce rented to\nNewmark\nand private equity firm Wind Point Partners, showing trophy space still draws demand from top-tier tenants.\nThe Bank of America tower at\n110 North Wacker Drive\nsecured a $700 million refinancing led by landlord Oak Hill Advisors, marking the city\u2019s largest commercial mortgage-backed securities office loan since the pandemic. With Bank of America the largest tenant in the building and the tower offering high-end amenities, lenders showed a level of confidence that has grown rare for Chicago office buildings.\nIn Fulton Market, developers Jeff Shapack, Tim Anderson and their partner Walton Street Capital also defied Chicago\u2019s office market woes with a\n$247 million refinancing for 167 North Green Street\n.\nBut the picture wasn\u2019t uniform. Blackstone extended the\n$1.3 billion loan on Willis Tower\nfor a sixth time, as valuation swings and tenant downsizing kept pressure on the skyscraper.\nPlans for office\nconversions into residential chugged along\n. And trades within the sector that did occur extended the streak of extreme losses in value from previous sale prices.\nNew York-based investors were the big buyers:\n601W Cos. bought the building at 525 West Van Buren Street\nfor just $35 million, Mike Kohan paid just $45 million for the skyscraper at 311 South Wacker Drive to mark an 85 percent discount from its last sale, while Namdar Realty Group and Mason Asset Management are working on a deal to snag the tower at 190 South LaSalle Street at a steep loss for the seller,\nBeacon Capital Partners\n. Plus, the New York-based\nStahl Organization\npartnered with Hines to buy the Boeing Building for just $22 million.\nMeanwhile, Neil Bluhm\u2019s aforementioned\nWalton Street Capital is having a tough time\nselling its Magnificent Mile office tower at 401 North Michigan Avenue after drawing initial interest from seriously capitalized buyers.\nMegadevelopment momentum\nChicago\u2019s major development sites, some long-stalled, made real progress in 2025.\nAt\nLincoln Yards\n, new investors emerged to buy undeveloped land off the clearance rack, including\nJDL and Kayne Anderson\n. They paid\n$84 million\nfor land on the north side of the Chicago River from Bank OZK, which seized the property from a venture of the original developer, Sterling Bay and its partner Lone Star Funds.\nMore recently,\nJohn Novak\nemerged as a buyer for much of the southern Lincoln Yards assemblage. The revived momentum pointed to a more phased, modular approach, replacing the bigger, $6 billion buildout originally pitched by\nSterling Bay\n.\nDespite\nsuffering some setbacks\n, Bally\u2019s pushed ahead on its\n$1.7 billion permanent casino\ncomplex in River West. Construction rose on the riverfront site, and remained on track for opening in late 2026.\nRelated Midwest and CRG bought the long-dormant\nformer U.S. Steel site on the South Side\nin partnership with\nBlue Owl\n, teeing up a multibillion-dollar quantum computing project on the lakefront as the anchor of a larger redevelopment play.\nAnd at The 78 megasite, Related and billionaire\nJoe Mansueto\u2019s Chicago Fire FC\nsecured approval to build a privately funded soccer stadium \u2014 the site\u2019s first real vertical development.\nMeanwhile, stadium plans for the\nWhite Sox\nand\nBears\nremained uncertain. The Sox were left out of stadium planning at The 78, and the Bears floated a\nmove to Indiana\nafter Illinois lawmakers ignored funding requests.\n@properties sale to Compass kicks off new consolidation wave\nChicago\u2019s\nbrokerage landscape shifted\nwhen Compass acquired @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate in a $444 million deal that closed early in the year.\nThe move gave Compass a dominant foothold in the city and combined its marketing platform with @properties\u2019 agent base and mortgage and title arms. It also set off a wave of local reactions, as competitors\nrecalibrated, and agents speculated\nabout the merger\u2019s effect on the city\u2019s top firm.\nLocal legacy powerhouse\nBaird &amp; Warner bought\nthe Chicago-focused brokerage Dream Town Real Estate to bolster its scale.\nBut by year-end,\nCompass had agreed to a $1.6 billion all-stock acquisition\nof Anywhere Real Estate, which owns Coldwell Banker and Century 21 among other brokerage brands. If approved, the merger would give\nCompass a sprawling umbrella\nand further consolidate power at the national level, as brokerage industry norms get\nscrutinized and reconsidered\n.\nSouth Side multifamily distress\nWhile rents climbed and inventory stayed tight across Class A apartments, the South Side\u2019s multifamily sector struggled with legal, financial and reputational blows.\nIn South Shore, properties owned by\nWisconsin-based investor Trinity Flood\nwere\nraided by federal immigration agents\nfollowing a wave of tenant complaints and building code issues. The ownership group had already\nfaced foreclosures and lawsuits\ndue to subpar property conditions and loan payment defaults before the stunning law enforcement operation carried out in the middle of the night.\nNearby, legal fights broke out between\nonce-active investors\n. Chikoo Patel, who oversaw a portfolio of dozens of buildings across the South Side, was\nsued by multiple partners\n, including investor Shai Wolkowicki, who claimed Patel improperly siphoned off millions of dollars for his own use. Wolkowicki and Patel also\nfaced a foreclosure lawsuit\nfrom lender Old National Bank. Separately,\nWolkowicki also sued Mitch Goltz\nover claims of mismanagement in their prolific former retail development partnership,\nGW Properties\n.\nBack on the South Side,\nNew York-based Emerald Empire\u2019s apartment portfolio\n, which included over\n$600 million in real estate it purchased in bulk from Pangea Properties\nin 2022, slid into forbearance on a massive Fannie Mae loan.\nAcross Chicagoland,\nThe Real Deal also tracked the nearly $100 million\nthat investors who got blacklisted by Fannie Mae tossed into regional real estate.\nLakefront luxury reaches new peaks\nHigh-end housing\nsurged past previous records\nin 2025, especially along the North Shore and into Wisconsin\u2019s Lake Geneva.\nA\nWinnetka lakefront estate\nowned by Walton Street Capital executive Jeff Quicksilver and his wife Ashley Quicksilver sold for $32.5 million \u2014 the most ever paid for a home in Illinois \u2014 just weeks after another mansion in the same wealthy power town traded for\n$31 million\n.\nThe\nQuicksilvers set another local record\nas they downsized to a\n$14.5 million Kenilworth mansion\n, and a\n$20 million Lake Geneva sale\nalso closed, reinforcing a strong year for waterfront trophy homes. North Shore specialist\nJena Radnay\nclosed both the big Winnetka deals as well as the Kenilworth sale, marking a new peak for her brokerage practice.\nBut it wasn\u2019t all good news for Lake Michigan\u2019s shoreline homeowners. The residents who\nsued the Winnetka government\nfor overhauling rules to make it harder to develop blufftop land along the water\nsuffered a setback in court\n. Yet they\u2019re still fighting to repeal the regulations.\nLake Geneva also saw litigation. The\nhistoric Aloha Lodge\nbecame the\nsubject of a lawsuit\nafter an initial buyer walked away from a $37.5 million contract. But demand overall stayed strong, with multiple bidders vying for move-in-ready estates at about the\n$10 million range\n. Interest rate pressure didn\u2019t seem to reach this end of the market.\nProperty tax troubles plague all of Cook County\nIt\u2019s a perennial theme in Chicago real estate:\nproperty tax chaos\n.\nDelayed bills\nleft buyers in limbo\nand cost\nChicago Public Schools nearly $250,000 a day\nin interest on short-term loans it took on to cover the gap from late property tax revenue. Assessments across the\nSouth and West Sides jumped\n, with some homeowners discovering tax bills that had doubled.\nLate in the year, a federal court ruled the\ncounty\u2019s annual delinquent tax sale system unconstitutional\n, casting uncertainty over how liens would be handled moving forward.\nThe result of it all was\ndeal slowdowns\n, broken underwriting assumptions and increased tension between commercial landlords and homeowners. With no sure fix in place, tax policy remains a key concern heading into 2026.\n",

        "content": "Where Metin Negrin once saw a sales opportunity, he\u2019s instead embracing the office-to-residential conversion trend.\nLexin Capital filed plans to convert 229 West 28th Street in Chelsea from office and retail use to apartments, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. It\u2019s not immediately clear if the units will be rentals or condos.\nThe conversion plans call for the 12-story, 157,000-square-foot building to expand to a 35-story, 207,000-square-foot residential complex. Most of the space would be residential, though there would also be 3,900 square feet of commercial space; the Department of Buildings application references \u201cgeneral wiring for a nightclub\u201d on the ground floor.\nThe conversion plans were first reported by\nPincusCo\n. In comments to the Observer, Negrin said the project \u201cshows the adaptability of this great property,\u201d mentioning how it started as a printing factory a century ago.\nNegrin\u2019s excitement for the conversion is a departure from a few years ago, when the Lexin owner and president appeared ready to wash his hands of the property.\nLexin bought the property on West 28th Street, dubbed the Caxton Building, in 2014 for\n$81.5 million\nand refinanced it in 2016 with a $73 million loan from Aareal Bank. Lexin put the property up for sale in February 2020, at which time it was 90 percent leased, aiming for a price around\n$138 million\n.\nHe never sold the property, though, and leasing activity collapsed as the pandemic\u2019s impact raged across the office landscape. In 2022, Lexin reached maturity default on the property\u2019s non-performing loan, a $65 million debt an Aareal subsidiary\nput up for sale\nin 2023, when the property was only 58 percent leased.\nMonths later, a buyer emerged for the debt: Lexin itself, putting it in control of the building\u2019s future once more. That future doesn\u2019t appear to include existing office tenants, including health tech company Noom and wedding photographer Edward Dye.\nElsewhere, Lexin put the development site at 75 Nassau Street\nup for sale\nlast summer, seeking a valuation of around $75 million in either an outright sale or stake sale for one of the last 421a-eligible development sites in Manhattan.\nThe site \u2014 zoned for mixed-use residential and commercial and eligible to be developed into a rental or condo building with 253 units \u2014 has yet to be sold.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Columbia Property Trust has been hit with a notice of default tied to San Francisco office buildings six months after the debt matured.\nThe New York-based firm\ndefaulted on a $1.7 billion\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities loan in July and received the notice of default from its lenders on Dec. 17, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The loan was backed by\n650 California Street\nand 201 California Street in the Financial District and five other office buildings across the country.\nThe debt has since grown to $1.9 billion, according to the notice. Lenders could pursue foreclosure if Columbia doesn\u2019t rectify the situation and pay back the money owed.\nThe seven-building portfolio also includes three office buildings in Manhattan, one in Boston and one in New Jersey. Columbia\nsought to sell debt backed by 201 California\nthis summer; as of this fall, lenders were negotiating with Ridge Capital Investors to sell the debt for $75 million, but no deal has materialized.\nColumbia first defaulted on the $1.7 billion loan, originated in late 2021 by a group including\nGoldman Sachs\n, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, in January 2023, a few months before its scheduled maturity. Columbia negotiated an extension of the loan\u2019s maturity to July 2025, with an additional six-month extension option, according to CMBS data cited by the Business Times. The firm did not exercise the extension option or pay off the loan at its maturity.\nThe seven-building portfolio was appraised at a total of almost $1.3 billion this year, down from nearly $2.3 billion in October 2021. The appraised value of 650 California dropped to $305 million this year from $479 million over the same period. Columbia bought the building in 2014 for $309 million. The 34-story tower was 87 percent occupied as of September 2024, according to the most recent CMBS data available from lenders cited by the Business Times.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Solomon was an employee at the REIT for more than a dozen years.\nHe was charged last December\nwith stealing more than $9.5 million from the company between 2009 and 2023.\nProsecutors in the U.S. Southern District\u2019s office don\u2019t appear to be buying his argument about the disclosures.\nThey responded to Solomon\u2019s motion, saying that he was trying to shift the focus of the trial away from himself and onto Vornado.\n\u201cIn essence, the defendant seeks to convert a trial about whether he committed wire fraud and aggravated identity theft into a trial about whether Victim Company-1 has complied with securities laws,\u201d prosecutors wrote. \u201cWhether Victim Company-1 has complied with the securities laws is irrelevant to whether the defendant committed the charged offenses.\u201d\nSolomon pleaded not guilty in December and by May prosecutors told the judge overseeing the case that they had reached an agreement in principle with him to change his plea. Solomon switched attorneys, though, and\ndug in his heels\nto fight the charges.\nIf found guilty, he faces up to 20 years in prison.\n",

        "content": "The Department of Veterans affairs must build more than 2,500 housing units on its West Los Angeles campus, a federal appeals court has ruled.\nLast week, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a court order requiring the VA to construct 750 temporary units for veterans within 18 months and 1,800 permanent housing units within six years, LAist\nreported\n. The VA is accused of \u201cstray[ing] from its mission\u201d by leasing land to commercial tenants like the University of California, Los Angeles, for a\nbaseball field and Brentwood School for a sports complex\nrather than using it for veterans.\n\u201cThere are now scores of unhoused veterans trying to survive in and around the greater Los Angeles area despite the acres of land deeded to the VA for their care,\u201d Judge Ana de Alba said in the Powers v. McDonough case opinion. There are more than 3,000 unhoused veterans in the Los Angeles region.\nThe appeals court backed a 2024 ruling from U.S. District Judge David O. Carter that found the VA discriminated against disabled veterans by failing to provide adequate housing on the 388-acre property deeded as a soldiers\u2019 home in 1888. The ruling also invalidates most commercial leases on the property, including Brentwood School\u2019s 22-acre sports complex and an oil company\u2019s drilling license, though the district court\u2019s previous invalidation of UCLA\u2019s lease for its baseball stadium was overturned.\nThe case dates back to a 2015 settlement in which the VA promised to build 1,200 housing units, with more than 770 completed by 2022. The deadline came and went without new housing, which prompted the new lawsuit. The veteran plaintiffs said the dearth of on-campus housing has kept disabled veterans from accessing physical and mental health services at the VA.\nAs of late last year, there were 307 veteran housing units open on the West L.A. campus and 461 units under construction, according to the VA.\nJeffrey Powers, the main plaintiff in the class-action suit, lived in a tent outside the\nVA Medical Center\n. Following the appeal\u2019s court\u2019s ruling, he said the decision comprises \u201cabout 80 percent\u201d of what he\u2019d like to see done.\n\u201cWe got the most important thing, which was to get veterans off the street,\u201d Powers said. \u201cAnd for that, I\u2019m happy with the outcome.\u201d\nIn May, President Donald Trump\nissued an executive order\ninstructing the VA secretary to develop a plan to\nhouse 6,000 people\nat the West Los Angeles VA center by 2028. The case is now back in the hands of the District Court judge to implement the court\u2019s housing order and oversee construction of units.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s already slow development pipeline just hit another snag \u2014 this one self-inflicted.\nThe interim chair of the Chicago City Council\u2019s Zoning Committee is pulling the emergency brake, suspending meetings in an effort to force Mayor Brandon Johnson to finally appoint a permanent leader to one of the most powerful panels in city government, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. North Side Alderman Bennett Lawson, who has chaired the committee on an interim basis since August, said Monday he\u2019s done playing placeholder.\nLawson declined to schedule a January\nzoning\nmeeting, meaning no zoning items can advance to the full City Council next month. The move effectively freezes dozens of developments across the city that need final approval, according to the publication.\n\u201cIf I continue to be in the acting role, it kicks the can down the road,\u201d Lawson told the outlet. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to force the issue and bring about a quick resolution.\u201d\nThe Zoning Committee is where Chicago\u2019s development battles are won or lost, overseeing rezonings, planned developments and issues that routinely touch gentrification, landmarking and design standards. Without a chair and without meetings, projects large and small are stuck in limbo \u2014 an unwelcome delay for developers already navigating high interest rates, elevated construction costs and a cautious lending market.\nThe vacancy itself is the product of months of political gridlock. Johnson\u2019s first pick for the role, former Alderman\nCarlos Ramirez-Rosa\n, resigned amid bullying allegations. The seat then sat open until September, when Johnson tapped longtime zoning powerbroker Walter Burnett Jr. Burnett, however, stepped down from the council in July, reopening the wound.\nLawson has filled the gap twice now, first for nine months after Ramirez-Rosa\u2019s exit and again after Burnett\u2019s departure. He\u2019s made clear he won\u2019t do it indefinitely, citing the workload and political weight of the job, which comes with extra staff, office space and a seat on the Planning Commission.\nJohnson insists a solution is coming. The mayor said Monday he plans to propose a broader reshuffling of committee chairmanships and downplayed concerns about delays. When pressed on timing, he offered a single word: \u201cSoon.\u201d\nBehind the scenes,\ncompeting interests\nhave slowed any resolution. Progressive and moderate blocs, along with the City Council\u2019s Black and Latino caucuses, have jockeyed for control. Johnson\u2019s attempt to install Alderman\nDaniel La Spata\nwas rebuffed. Alderman Gilbert Villegas has floated himself as an alternative. Lawson, a freshman alderman but former zoning staffer, has also said he wants the job.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "In an Elmhurst neighborhood where teardowns have become the norm, a small 1920s house that dodged the wrecking ball is making its case for preservation \u2014 with a glossy, design-forward relaunch.\nA 1925 cottage on Arlington Avenue designed by architect Harold Zook has hit the market just under $1.5 million after a full-scale glow-up that leans into its storybook bones rather than erasing them. The four-bedroom, four-bathroom, 2,900-square-foot home at 231 South Arlington Avenue was listed Dec. 18 by Pattie Murray of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Chicago,\naccording\nto Crain\u2019s, which first reported the sale. The price amounts to $517 per square foot.\nOwner Kristin Luu calls it \u201c\nZook 2.0.\u201d\nThe renovation keeps the chalet-style wood ceiling, gingerbread staircase trim and rolled eaves intact, while layering in a high-contrast color palette, eccentric light fixtures and finishes that skew decidedly 2025. Luu, an executive search consultant, worked remotely with Finnish designer Maya Mhanna via Decorilla to update both form and function, carving out a mudroom and adding a basement powder room without flattening the home\u2019s original character.\nThat balance matters in\nElmhurst\n, where older homes are\nroutinely scrapped\nfor large new construction. The Zook house sits on a one-third-acre lot that would have been catnip for builders. Its two immediate neighbors are replacement homes, and at least four nearby properties have sold to teardown buyers in recent months, according to the publication. One such sale on Illinois Street closed in July for $1.7 million \u2014 for the land alone.\nBy comparison, Luu\u2019s asking price covers both land and a fully reimagined historic house.\nThe property\u2019s prior owner, Regina Bollaert, sold the home in 2023 for $1 million after her family owned it for six decades and actively resisted selling to developers. Luu told the outlet that she wasn\u2019t initially shopping as a preservationist, but the house\u2019s intact details changed the project from a simple redesign into something closer to a rescue.\nIn at least one case, the house won the argument. Luu initially planned to open up the kitchen, then backed off, deciding the closed layout better suited the home\u2019s\nCotswold-style\nfootprint.\nZook, who left his mark across the western suburbs and designed the art deco Pickwick Theater in Park Ridge, isn\u2019t typically associated with modest cottages. That architectural provenance sets this house apart from many of the homes that have disappeared nearby.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Partners include Urbane Development, the Bluestone Organization, Mega Group Development and Triangle Equities Development.\nGoldman Sachs Alternatives\u2019 Urban Investment Group is the anchor lender, alongside a roster of public agencies that underscores the project\u2019s political heft.\nThe capital stack includes the city\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development and Housing Development Corporation, New York State Homes and Community Renewal, plus funding from the City Council and Queens Borough President\u2019s office.\nBuilding D will deliver 230 affordable rental units and 90 homes slated for private ownership. The mix reflects a broader push to blend rental housing with paths to ownership in neighborhoods where prices have long shut residents out.\nConstruction is expected to wrap in 2028.\nArverne East has been in the works for years, born out of post-Sandy planning to rethink development along the Rockaways\u2019 flood-prone coastline. The project leans heavily on climate-resilient design, featuring buildings elevated above flood levels and packed with mitigation measures.\nPlans for Building D include roof-mounted solar panels paired with ground-source heat pumps, bioswale gardens to manage stormwater and flood-proofed ground floors.\nFar Rockaway was among the areas hardest hit by Superstorm Sandy in 2012, and later, by flooding tied to Hurricane Ida. Those disasters pushed city officials and developers to pursue projects that could withstand increasingly volatile weather while still adding housing supply.\nThe financing follows an earlier milestone for Arverne East. In mid-2023, developers completed a 35-acre nature preserve and a Coastal Conservation Center on the site, bringing a community center and Parks Department space to the area.\nFuture phases are slated to add more housing, retail, a community facility and even a boutique hotel.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The fallout from the alleged fraud tied to indicted developer Ken Mattson\u2019s LeFever Mattson firm is getting closer to the embattled developers\u2019 families.\nIn a new court filing, the unsecured creditors committee representing more than 600 defrauded investors won permission to subpoena the 83-year-old mother-in-law of co-founder Tim LeFever, alleging the now-defunct California real estate firm transferred more than $2.4 million to her in the years leading up to the real estate empire\u2019s collapse, the Mercury News\nreported\n. That figure includes more than $1.6 million in the year leading up to LeFever Mattson\u2019s bankruptcy filing.\nJudge Charles Novack approved the request the same day it was filed. LeFever\u2019s mother-in-law, 83-year-old Kathleen Hamlin, has now been identified as a litigation target in the ongoing case.\nHamlin lives near LeFever and his wife Amy in Dixon, California. Creditors are looking for recoverable assets \u2014 such as indicted developer\nKen Mattson\u2019s properties\n\u2014 in the case that prosecutors have described as a long-running Ponzi scheme. Mattson was\nordered to surrender the deed\nto his home in Piedmont earlier this month.\nThe subpoena seeks documents from Hamlin, her accountants, attorneys and family members, including Tim and Amy LeFever. It also targets a web of affiliated nonprofits, construction firms and limited partnerships\nconnected to the firm\u2019s\nreal estate investment vehicles, which at their peak controlled roughly 200 properties valued at about $400 million. Hamlin has until Jan. 9 to share the documents and until Jan. 30 to appear in court for oral testimony.\nProsecutors allege Mattson siphoned funds from investors into secret accounts for personal use, rather than using the money to invest in real estate on investors\u2019 behalf. LeFever has filed more than 60 claims in the bankruptcy proceedings saying he flagged accounting problems to regulators last year.\nThe committee and lawyers representing LeFever Mattson entered into mediation with Tim LeFever this month. LeFever has not been criminally charged, while Mattson has pleaded not guilty to\nnine federal counts\nincluding wire fraud, money laundering and obstruction of justice.\nCourt filings suggest the defrauded investors may ultimately recover between 20 to 40 percent of what they put in. Many were retirees who gave their life savings or retirement funds to LeFever Mattson. Still, many of them haven\u2019t lost hope, and have turned to each other for support, either over text message or in person. Some have even offered their prayers for Mattson, hoping for a \u201cheart change,\u201d the Mercury News\nreported\n.\n\u201cSometimes we joke, or we talk about the pain we\u2019ve experienced,\u201d investor Stephen Crane said of his relationships with fellow victims. \u201cBut there is ultimately justice. There will be a day when he has to stand before God and acknowledge what he\u2019s done.\u201d\n\u201cKen robbed us of our money. But he can\u2019t rob our joy or our peace,\u201d Crane\u2019s wife Maria added.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The company expanded its space at the building multiple times, ultimately moving from a 1,226-square-foot space to a 6,425-square-foot office in May 2024, according to the landlord. Modifications to the agreement included extending the lease until 2035.\nTerms of the lease outlined in the lawsuit show Venetos agreed to a payment schedule that started at a rate of $46 per square foot and incrementally increased to $60 per square foot by the end of the lease.\nRosewood claims Venetos was sporadic on payments starting in July 2024, and stopped paying rent altogether in June 2025. Rosewood terminated the lease in October, and Lurin Capital vacated the space in November.\nAlthough the property is in Dallas\u2019 most coveted office district, Rosewood said it\u2019s been unsuccessful in filling the space. Venetos owes the landlord $5.3 million because has personally guaranteed the lease, Rosewood said. The sum includes past due rent and fees, future rent and attorney fees.\nRosewood joins a growing club of lenders, vendors, cities and landlords suing Jon Venetos over unpaid bills. Acore Capital Mortgage kicked off the crush of lawsuits in the spring when it said\nVenetos defaulted on nearly $400 million\ntied to 12 properties in Florida.\nSince then,\nFannie Mae\nsued Venetos and Lurin over a $77 million default.\nVista Bank\nand\nKeybank\nalso filed lawsuits claiming defaults. In a series of October lawsuits, Acore claimed that Venetos personally guaranteed the money he borrowed from the lender and still\nowes $81 million\n.\nLurin also got slapped with a\ntemporary restraining order\nthat ordered residents of a Lurin-owned property in Plano to vacate due to unsafe conditions, including lack of access to water, sewer or gas.\n",

The deal closed Dec. 12, Brohn Chief Operating Officer Greg Barber\ntold\nthe Houston Business Journal, though the purchase price was not disclosed.\nThe transaction hands Brohn an instant footprint in Greater Houston, including a 30-person local team led by Roderick Flint and active or planned construction across 13 master-planned communities, according to the publication. Those include Sunterra in Katy, Attwater near Waller, Fulshear Lakes in Fort Bend County, Sierra Vista in Iowa Colony and Azalea in Pattison.\nHistoryMaker\nhas been a steady player in the Houston market. The Grapevine-based builder closed 247 homes locally last year and started 238 more, ranking 32nd among area builders by volume. The company entered Houston in 2016 and consistently expanded before this pull back to its core markets, according to the outlet.\nFounded in 1949,\nHistoryMaker\nwill now focus exclusively on\nDallas-Fort Worth\nand San Antonio. CEO Nelson Mitchell framed the sale as a cultural fit, saying the companies\u2019 shared values made the move a \u201cnatural alignment.\u201d\nThe acquisition is a shortcut into Texas\u2019 largest and most competitive housing market for Brohn \u2014 and one it\u2019s had its eye on for years. The builder has operated in Austin since 2003 and was acquired in 2018 by Clayton Properties Group, a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary and one of the country\u2019s largest homebuilding platforms.\nBrohn only expanded to San Antonio earlier this year, but Barber told the outlet that Houston has long been part of the growth plan.\nThe deal boosts Brohn\u2019s headcount from 80 employees in\nAustin\nto about 110 across its Texas operations. Longer term, the company has set an ambitious target: Building 1,000 homes per year in the Houston area within five years.\nThat goal puts Brohn squarely in a crowded field dominated by national giants and well-capitalized regional players, all competing for lots, labor and buyers in a market that has cooled from pandemic highs but remains one of the nation\u2019s most\nresilient\n.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

If voters approve the changes, local governments could lose up to $18 billion in annual revenue.\nThe proposals, to be debated when the\nFlorida Legislature\nconvenes for its yearly session on Jan. 13, mark the boldest effort yet in Florida politicians\u2019 long-running battle over property taxes.\nOne of the measures would wipe out local non-school taxes on homesteads. Others would expand exemptions or create new ones tied to property insurance coverage.\nOrlando and Orange County are among the localities that warn the plans could destabilize budgets that rely on\nproperty taxes\nto fund police, fire, parks and basic infrastructure.\nHouse Speaker Daniel Perez, a Republican legislator from\nMiami\n, said lawmakers want to give voters a \u201cmenu\u201d of options rather than a single plan.\nGov. Ron DeSantis\n, who pushed for eliminating all property taxes, has opposed that approach, warning it could splinter support. But his influence is waning, as a lame-duck governor with no veto power over ballot initiatives.\nLocal officials and fiscal analysts say the proposals threaten to upend municipal finance systems that hinge on the stability of property levies.\nOrlando could lose about $72 million in annual revenue if homestead taxes vanish, while unincorporated Orange County could lose nearly $278 million. Critics argue that loss would inevitably shift the tax burden onto renters and small businesses or force cuts in essential services.\nSupporters, led by GOP legislators and state CFO Blaise Ingoglia, contend property tax growth has become \u201cunsustainable,\u201d arguing homeowners deserve relief amid surging values. Any resolutions that pass the House and Senate with three-fifths majorities will appear on a statewide ballot next year and require 60 percent voter approval.\n\u2013 Francisco Alvarado",

The developer applied using density bonus incentives and the provisions of\nAB 2011\nto build larger than zoning rules would normally allow at the site in exchange for including eight apartments set aside for very-low-income and moderate-income households.\nThe proposed development faced pushback from residents as well as members of the Planning Commission. Some residents said city staff didn\u2019t use its discretion to block or force changes to the project, and others said the project would block views of the ocean and increase traffic on the seaside highway.\nCommissioners cited a lack of sufficient parking on site as part of the reasoning for its denial of the project, the Daily Breeze\nreported\n. The officials said that spillover parking from apartment residents onto nearby streets would hinder potential beachgoers\u2019 entry to the coast below and create congestion that would block access to a nearby fire station.\nIf Redondo Seaside Living chooses to appeal the project, the issue would go before the Redondo Beach City Council.\nRedondo Beach has dealt with builder\u2019s remedy in the past and taken steps to prevent its application in the city. In 2023, city officials\nrepeatedly denied\na permit application from\nprominent Los Angeles developer Leo Pustilnikov\nto build a 35-unit mixed-use apartment complex at a\nformer power plant\nat 1021 North Harbor Drive.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Suzy Welch has staked another claim in the Upper East Side.\nAn entity tied to Welch, the author and widow of former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, closed on a $24.2 million condo on Park Avenue, property records show.\nIt\u2019s Welch\u2019s third purchase in the neighborhood in the last seven years. Earlier this month, she listed her townhouse at 160 East 81st Street, just blocks away, for $26 million.\nIt\u2019s not clear if Welch plans to live in the home. A chief of staff for Welch said, \u201cyour information is incorrect\u201d in response to questions about the purchase, but did not elaborate.\nWelch\u2019s new purchase is the penthouse atop the 11-unit pre-war building, which was converted into condos following a 2006 renovation.\nSpanning 7,200 square feet, the five-bedroom apartment sprawls across three stories, including a top-floor landscaped terrace and home theater.\nA private elevator landing leads into a double-sized living room with 10-foot ceilings, herringbone floors and a limestone gas-burning fireplace. The first floor also features a formal dining room overlooking Park Avenue and a wood-paneled library.\nThe second floor holds two more terraces, one of which features an outdoor kitchen and dining area, a primary suite and a sauna.\nThe seller is billionaire hedge funder\nJoseph Edelman\n, who bought the apartment for $30.5 million in 2008. He initially listed it for over $33 million in 2021, but dropped the asking price several times since then. The condo had a last asking price of nearly $27 million.\nCompass\u2019 Maria Manuche had the listing.\nFor Welch, an author and professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, the purchase is the latest in a series of property moves that have come since her husband\u2019s death in 2020.\nIn 2022, Welch sold her Lenox Hill co-op at 834 Park Avenue for\n$21 million\nafter buying it with her husband, Jack, for about $19 million in 2018.\nThat sale came roughly one year after she bought her now-listed townhouse for nearly\n$23 million\nin 2021. The double-wide home spans almost 7,700 square feet and comes with seven bedrooms and seven bathrooms.\nIn 2022, Welch also listed her Hudson Valley estate for\n$25 million\n.\n",

        "content": "Jeff Sutton is going small with his latest endeavor, a miniscule Soho property lease designed to generate cash through retail rent and a redeveloped group of residential units.\nWharton Properties signed a 35-year ground lease to take over 78 Greene Street from long-time landlord Robert Zeisel, PincusCo\nreported\n. Financial terms of the deal for the six-story, 14,000-square-foot property were not disclosed.\nThe lease was revealed in a memorandum published to public records days before Christmas. The lease doesn\u2019t technically begin until the first day of 2026, but it will run through the end of 2061.\nZeisel could not be reached for comment, while Wharton did not immediately return a request for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe sole broker on the deal was Peter Weisman of Weisman NYC, who shared additional details about what Sutton has in store.\nWharton plans to capitalize on the difference \u201cbetween an increased rent roll and their obligations under the triple net lease,\u201d Weisman told\nTRD\n, pointing to a turnover expected next December on the ground-floor retail space, occupied today by the Veronica Beard clothing boutique.\nWharton also plans to redevelop the upper floors to high-end residential space, according to Weisman; there are five units in place. Weisman applied for rent stabilization exemptions for three floors \u201cas a courtesy to the owner.\u201d\nSutton\u2019s been making moves in Soho. Earlier this year, an entity connected to Ikea purchased 529 Broadway in Soho from Sutton\nfor $213 million\n. The Scandinavian furniture giant will occupy the first and second floors, a space totaling about 25,000 square feet.\nSutton is also in the midst of\nfighting a foreclosure lawsuit\ninitiated by the German bank Helaba on his Herald Square property at 27-29 West 34th Street.\nAs for Zeisel, the ground lease deal allows him to step back from day-to-day management while keeping ownership and avoiding the capital gains tax, for which the implications would have been severe, according to Weisman.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

An LLC led by Servito Morales sold the 6,700-square-foot home, which has six bedrooms and seven and a half bathrooms.\nSuarez\u2019s net worth soared during his time as mayor, from just over $400,000 in 2018 to more than $5 million today, according to financial disclosure records obtained by the\nMiami New Times\n. That net worth included his home in Coconut Grove, investment properties, a $235,000 boat and nearly $600,000 in cryptocurrency. But it did not include his latest home purchase, which closed on Dec. 22.\nThe sale marks one of the priciest non-waterfront home sales in the area.\nThe real estate industry rallied around Suarez during his eight-year tenure as mayor. Suarez helped push through major projects, including the Miami Freedom Park mixed-use stadium development. He was also considered\nMiami\u2019s \u201ctech mayor\u201d\nwho helped woo major Silicon Valley investors to the Magic City.\nAmong his side gigs, Suarez was a private consultant for former developer Rishi Kapoor, who was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly defrauding more than 50 investors who contributed\n$93 million\nfor his real estate projects.\nEileen Higgins\nwas sworn in as mayor days before Suarez\u2019s home purchase closed, following a runoff election earlier this month against former city manager Emilio Gonzalez. Higgins also garnered major support from the real estate industry.\nSuarez\u2019s new home was completed in 2025. It sits on nearly an acre of land with an outdoor grill, fireplace and pool, according to the listing. The property hit the market last summer for just under $10 million.\nMichael Martinez of One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty represented the seller.

        "content": "A longtime anchor of Chicagoland\u2019s Polish-American community is poised for redevelopment, as a local builder lines up a roughly $150 million apartment project to replace the shuttered White Eagle banquet hall.\nNoah Properties plans to raze the restaurant at 6839 North Milwaukee Avenue in Niles and build a 354-unit residential complex across seven acres, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n. The White Eagle, which operated on the site since 1967 and hosted generations of weddings, fundraisers and visiting dignitaries, closed earlier this month.\nBart Przyjemski\n, president of Schiller Park-based Noah Properties, said demolition could begin in January, kicking off a three-phase build expected to wrap up in late 2027. Plans call for clusters of townhouses and four mid-rise buildings designed by Chicago\u2019s\nJonathan Splitt Architects\n, along with a public park, rooftop terraces and a pool.\nIn a nod to the site\u2019s legacy, Przyjemski plans to carve out about 6,000 square feet of retail space along Milwaukee Avenue for a future restaurant, though the concept and operator remain undecided.\nThe developer has zoning approvals in hand but is seeking tax-increment financing to make the numbers work. Village officials are reviewing the request, which would divert future property taxes to help cover project costs.\nAn initial analysis found the development includes \u201ca substantial amount of eligible expenses,\u201d village spokesman Mitch Johnson told the outlet, adding that the public benefits are also significant. Any TIF package would still require Village Board approval.\nPrzyjemski\nsaid the subsidy is needed to address unusually poor soil conditions tied to prior excavation for the Deep Tunnel flood control project. Foundations will have to extend roughly 26 feet deep, he told the outlet, driving up construction costs.\nDemand, however, appears strong. Noah recently completed Novu, a 180-unit rental project a few blocks north at 6633 North Milwaukee, which Przyjemski said is about 60 percent leased. Records show he bought the White Eagle property earlier this month for $5.7 million, financing the purchase with a $3.99 million loan from Genesis Capital.\nThe White Eagle, with capacity for 1,500 guests, welcomed figures ranging from Pope John Paul II to former President Jimmy Carter. Mayor George Alpogianis acknowledged the emotional weight of its closure but said redevelopment is part of the village\u2019s evolution.\nThe project is expected to draw young families and improve the\nMilwaukee Avenue\nstreetscape with landscaping, wider sidewalks and buried power lines. Traffic concerns remain, though officials said a new signal could be added.\nOne last historical question lingers: Beneath the banquet hall\u2019s exterior cladding may be a century-old facade from the Silver Leaf Tavern. The developer is required to see if it can be salvaged and displayed \u2014 a small link to the past amid a major remake.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

At full buildout, the campus would include five\ndata center\nbuildings with 76 megawatts of power capacity each, totaling a $1.5 billion investment. No job count has been released, though most employment would be tied to construction rather than permanent operations.\nThe project has drawn sustained opposition from nearby residents and skepticism from some council members, in part because it\u2019s been conflated with a separate gas-powered\ndata center\nproposed nearby in unincorporated Hays County, according to the publication. This site, however, is different \u2014 and now fully back in play after the council unanimously approved annexation of the remaining 64 acres in August.\nStill, the zoning effort collapsed last time around. Council members voted 5-2 to amend the city\u2019s comprehensive plan in TK, but the move required a six-vote supermajority after the planning commission recommended denial. Rather than triggering a formal denial and mandatory waiting period, the applicant opted to restart the process.\nOne notable shift: Dallas-based\nCyrusOne\nis no longer contractually tied to the development. The data center giant had been associated with the project and even held a community meeting, but delays caused its agreement to expire, Highlander manager John Mayberry said at a Dec. 16 meeting. He added that multiple potential operators remain interested but can\u2019t move forward without zoning in place.\nTo win approval, the developers are offering concessions. They\u2019ve proposed restrictive covenants addressing water use, drainage, impervious cover, noise and LEED standards. Cooling would rely on a closed-loop system requiring a one-time fill of up to 70,000 gallons, with daily water use of roughly 20,000 to 35,000 gallons \u2014 far less than a residential subdivision, city staff said.\nThe stakes are real for\nSan Marcos\n. City officials estimate the project could generate $9 million in property taxes for the city, $15.2 million for the school district and $5.3 million for Hays County. That revenue looms large as the city stares down a projected $13 million budget shortfall by 2029.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Walker &amp; Dunlop disclosed that it may have to repurchase millions of dollars of loans after Freddie Mac discovered borrowers committed\nmortgage fraud\n.\nThe finance and advisory firm revealed in its most recent earnings report and call with analysts that it has received requests from Freddie Mac to repurchase two loan portfolios with $100 million in unpaid balance because of fraudulent documentation submitted by the borrower.\nThe company has already entered into forbearance with Freddie Mac for one of the loan portfolios. It said it expects to enter into forbearance on the second portfolio of loans, totaling $49.3 million. But if it fails to reach an agreement, Walker &amp; Dunlop could be required to repurchase the loans.\nThe firm has hired an outside counsel to investigate suspect transactions in which borrowers may have committed fraud, according to sources familiar with the matter. As part of this process, Walker &amp; Dunlop has put some of its originators who worked on the deals on leave as it looks into the matter, sources said.\nWalker &amp; Dunlop did not return a request for comment.\nThe moves come in light of the federal government\u2019s continued investigation into commercial mortgage fraud. The Department of Justice and the Federal Housing Finance Agency have discovered a variety of schemes in which borrowers were able to obtain mortgages for far more than their properties were worth through inflated financials or purchase prices.\nSo far, the lender\u2019s role in these schemes has been less scrutinized than borrowers. The ease with which borrowers were able to obtain loans has raised questions about the lender\u2019s due diligence and underwriting.\nWalker &amp; Dunlop ranked as the largest Fannie Mae multifamily lender in 2024 with $7 billion in volume.\nAgency lenders such as Walker &amp; Dunlop originate loans and sell them to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. If a borrower commits fraud, the lender is usually responsible for covering Fannie or Freddie\u2019s legal costs or has to repurchase the loans.\nWalker &amp; Dunlop said it expects to use $20 million of its own capital as collateral to indemnify Freddie. It expects to take credit losses tied to the troubled loans in the fourth quarter, the firm\u2019s CFO said in its earnings call with analysts in November.\n\u201cWhile our portfolio performance is exceptional, and we feel extremely good about the credit quality of our book, we continue to investigate, in collaboration with the GSEs (Government Sponsored Enterprises), specific incidences of borrower fraud that took place largely as a result of changes in industry practices in the aftermath of the pandemic,\u201d said Walker and Dunlop\u2019s CFO, Greg Florkowski in the earnings call in November.\nThe firm\u2019s fraudulent loans represent a small fraction of the firm\u2019s overall business. Walker &amp; Dunlop reported a total transaction volume of $15.5 billion in the third quarter.\nWalker and Dunlop did not disclose the names of the borrowers it alleges committed fraud.\nThe firm has made at least three loans to embattled Mordechai Weiss or his wife, Basya Weiss.\nThe Monsey-based\nMordechai Weiss\nis a target of the DOJ and FHFA\u2019s\ninvestigation\n, according to sources familiar with the matter. Weiss is also the subject of a\nlawsuit\nby a lender of a Houston apartment deal over a sham deal where the lender alleges Weiss, along with his title insurer, used a fake purchase to obtain a $69 million loan.\nWalker &amp; Dunlop loans to Weiss\u2019s properties have also led to litigation and foreclosures.\nFannie Mae is seeking to foreclose on a $12 million loan for a multifamily property in Rochester, New York. (Walker &amp; Dunlop originated the loan, sold it to Fannie Mae and then repurchased it in December 2024, according to court documents).\nIn Greenbelt, Maryland, Freddie Mac initiated a foreclosure on a $35 million Walker &amp; Dunlop loan tied to Weiss\u2019s 178-unit multifamily property.

The 571-space garage at 300 Northwest Second Street is on the market with JLL. Brightline wants to lease it back for 25 years.

Landlords are still allowed to raise rents to market rates when new tenants move in. About 651,000 apartments, or approximately three quarters of\nLos Angeles\u2019 multifamily housing\nstock, will be subject to the new\ncaps on rent increases. Owners of older properties will be the most affected, though landlords of exempt apartments worry that the new rules will make it harder to secure tenants with their higher prices, according to the Journal.\n\u201cThe problem facing the nation and most certainly facing our state and city is affordability, and at the core of affordability is the price of housing,\u201d\nMayor Karen Bass\nsaid at a news conference last week after signing the new ordinance. \u201cThis is a step forward.\u201d\nAverage rent for a rent-controlled unit in Los Angeles is about $1,800 per month. Market-rate units typically rent for approximately $2,700.\nMultifamily developers are already shying away from building new properties within Los Angeles city limits. The\nMeasure ULA transfer tax\n, as well as years of rising interest rates, inflation and higher insurance costs, have\npushed developers to explore building\nin other Los Angeles County municipalities. \u201cIt\u2019s been death by a thousand cuts,\u201d\nDaniel Yukelson\n, CEO of landlord trade group Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles, told the Journal.\nCase in point: In the first eight months of this year, the Los Angeles metropolitan area approved the construction of fewer new housing units than the Austin, Texas metro, despite having five times the population, according to census data cited by the Journal.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Intel has had a presence at this site since the 1970s, according to the Business Times.\nIntel\u2019s Bowers Campus in total encompasses approximately 26 acres. The two proposed buildings would be on a 2.4-acre portion of the Bowers Campus. The company\u2019s main headquarters building is about a mile away at 2200 Mission College Boulevard.\nOne of the planned buildings will include manufacturing space, tools, servers and electrical and power facilities. The utility building will hold equipment for heating, cooling and power to support the manufacturing next door. The company plans to have current employees run the new facilities.\nSanta Clara officials are examining Intel\u2019s architectural review application as the proposal makes its way through the planning process. It\u2019s expected to advance at a hearing early next year before Intel receives building permits for the structures. If approved, construction would begin in the middle of next year and take about a year to complete.\nThe proposal marks the latest change to Intel\u2019s real estate holdings in Santa Clara. The corporation sold one of its industrial properties at 1501 Martin Avenue last month, the Mercury News\nreported\n.\nIntel\u2019s biggest competitor, multi-trillion-dollar chipmaker Nvidia, has similarly been shaking up its real estate holdings in its hometown of Santa Clara. Last month, Nvidia\nsubmitted an architectural review\nfor a new building for its headquarters campus slated to span 692,634 square feet.

        "content": "Hotel Daphne hasn\u2019t yet been open for a month, and its owners are already planning to make it bigger.\nThe boutique hotel that opened in the Heights earlier this month is preparing a roughly $15 million expansion that would add a two-story, 10-room wing and new amenities to the property at 347 West 20th Street, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n, citing a filing with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation.\nPlans call for 11,832 square feet of new construction, including king suites, a single-story pool bar with an adjoining terrace, event space, an event kitchen and a meeting room. Construction is expected to begin in spring 2026 and wrap up in early 2027, though state\npermit filings\nare preliminary and often change.\nThe expansion would build on the momentum of\nHotel Daphne\u2019s\nfirst phase, which opened Dec. 3 as a joint venture between Austin-based\nBunkhouse Hotels\nand Houston-based Wood Lane Partners. The five-story hotel was pitched as a \u201cneighborhood guest house\u201d meant to blend into the Heights rather than tower over it \u2014 a positioning that\u2019s increasingly common among boutique hospitality operators looking to tap into Houston\u2019s more residential submarkets.\nThe\nhotel\nfeatures an interior courtyard, a library that doubles as event space, a retail shop and an all-day restaurant called Hypsi. Design-wise, the project leans into the Heights\u2019 recycled industrial aesthetic, with painted brick, stepped parapets and steel windows. Bunkhouse handled the interiors in-house. Rooms at Hotel Daphne start at $359 per night.\nThe expansion marks a win for Wood Lane Partners, which has been trying to crack the Heights hotel market for years. An earlier plan for a smaller\nEuropean-style boutique hotel\n, Maison Robert, stalled after receiving approvals in 2019 as the pandemic upended hospitality development. Hotel Daphne finally broke ground in 2023, the same year Bunkhouse launched construction on its first Houston property, Hotel Saint Augustine in Montrose.\nSaint Augustine opened in 2024 and has since picked up a Michelin Key, marking an early win for Bunkhouse\u2019s brand of design-forward hotels in neighborhood settings.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Austin\u2019s\nbiggest leases\nof the year rang in just shy of one million square feet of office space, with about a third of that area in and around the Domain.\nNvidia led the way in planting its flag in northwest Austin, followed by Apple, BigCommerce and Spectrum in 2025.\nCitywide vacancy ticked up slightly to 22.6 percent in the third quarter of 2025, up 0.1 percent from the same period last year, according to a market report from Colliers. The Domain fared much better than the citywide office market, with a vacancy rate of 13.3 percent, thanks to demand from tech companies.\nBut around town, tech, insurance and healthcare companies are pushing millions of square feet back onto the market in the form of subleases giving tenants bargain options while keeping pressure on landlords. There was just under 4 million square feet of sublease space available at the end of the third quarter, CBRE said. The good news is that number is declining, down 14 percent from the same period last year.\nHere are the biggest office leases of the year in Austin, using data compiled from Newmark and Cushman &amp; Wakefield.\nNvidia | 11515 Burnet Road | 99,370 square feet\nNvidia\nsignificantly expanded its Austin presence with a nearly 100,000-square-foot lease at the Brandywine Realty Trust-owned One Uptown at 11515 Burnet Road. The office building is part of Uptown ATX, a mixed-use development near the Domain. Brandywine is billing the $3 billion, 66-acre hub as \u201cAustin\u2019s second downtown.\u201d Nvidia currently has two smaller leases in Austin \u2014 52,000 sq ft on Lakeline Boulevard and 5,000 sq ft off MoPac Expressway \u2014 and it\u2019s unclear if the new lease will consolidate these.\nOffice of the Texas Governor | 400 West 15th Avenue | 94,211 square feet\nGov. Greg Abbott\u2019s office not only renewed its lease at the 17-story downtown office building at 400 West 15th Avenue; it also set out to renovate 53,000 square feet of the Class A space with federal funds. In October, the Governor\u2019s office filed a permit for $2.6 million in renovations with federal funding at the site, according to a\nfiling\nwith the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, though a timeline for work is still unavailable. Austin-based Sixthriver Architects are providing the designs. The renewal doesn\u2019t help much with the glut of vacancies downtown, where the vacancy rate ticked up to 27.8 percent in the third quarter from 27.5 percent in the prior quarter, Colliers said.\nApple | 12365 Riata Trace Parkway B | 94,000 square feet\nApple renewed its lease of the entire building 8 at Endeavor-owned Riata Corporate Park ahead of the opening of its billion-dollar Northwest Austin campus at 6900 West Parmer Lane. The company employs nearly 10,000 people in the metro, positioning itself as one of the region\u2019s largest private employers, with the expectation that its workforce will grow all over the state, especially after CEO Tim Cook committed to a multibillion-dollar investment in U.S. manufacturing focused heavily on the Texas Triangle during a meeting at the White House in August.\nBigCommerce | 11920 Alterra Parkway | 65,000 square feet\nAustin-based BigCommerce took over space at the Domain 11 building that was offered up by Seattle-based Expedia. The lease spans portions of the eighth and ninth floors of the fully-leased, 338,900-square-foot, 16-story office building, at 11920 Alterra Parkway. Expedia didn\u2019t part ways with the neighborhood, as the firm built-out the top four floors of Domain 11, amounting to more than 250,000 square feet of space.\nFresenius Medical Care | 3711 South MoPac Expressway | 61,500 square feet\nThe global provider of products and services for renal disease patients renewed its office lease at The Park on Barton Creek, at 3711 South MoPac Expressway in\nSouthwest\nAustin. Los Angeles-based BH Properties bought the two-building office campus from\nStarwood Capital\nthis spring, after Starwood listed a $200 million Austin office portfolio. Fresenius, which is based in Germany, also operates kidney dialysis care centers throughout the Austin-San Antonio corridor.\nNinjaOne | 301 Congress Avenue | 60,000 square feet\nNinjaOne took a 60,000-square-foot bite out of the\n100,000-square-foot space RetailMeNot\nput on the sublease market. The 22-story, 436,855-square-foot downtown office tower was built in 1985. It served as RetailMeNot\u2019s headquarters until Ziff Davis acquired the company in 2020, after which it became a hub for all Ziff Davis\u2019 Austin-area employees.\nBasePower | 205 East Riverside Drive | 43,122 square feet\nThe Austin-based power company, which focuses on leasing out residential home backup batteries, renewed its full-building lease at 205 East Riverside Drive. The 44,000-square-foot office building is just south of downtown Austin. In 2025, the startup raised $1 billion in investments.\nSpectrum | 11921 North Mopac Expressway | 40,536 square feet\nThe international internet service provider renewed its second-floor lease at the Domain\u2019s Point 2 in May. The 162,959-square-foot office building sits at the edge of the Domain, overlooking the Mopac Expressway, but it\u2019s within walking distance of the restaurants and hotels that comprise the retail portion of the district.\nSonarSource | 206 East 9th Street | 37,454 square feet\nThe developer of AI coding tools renewed its 37,000-square-foot downtown lease in Capitol Tower, a 9-story, 178,600-square-foot office built in 1984 and renovated in 2018. The building is about 78 percent leased.\nBazaarvoice | 10901 Stonelake Boulevard | 36,592 square feet\nThe Austin-based software company that helps companies interpret user-generated content such as ratings and reviews, renewed its sublease at Quarry Oaks III, a 4-story 138,307-square-foot office built in 2015. The building sits across the Mopac Expressway from the Domain and J. J. Pickle Research Campus of the University of Texas.\n",

The apartment complex will stand six stories and includes its own recreational facilities. The plan also includes nine lakes spanning 35 acres.\nRecords show GL acquired the site for $4.6 million in 2015.

        "content": "Six of the 10 priciest multifamily deals in Los Angeles County were located in the City of L.A., meaning they were taxed extra via Measure ULA, which has slowed commercial trades but wasn\u2019t enough to keep these parties from buying or selling.\nThe 10 deals combined total about $1.2 billion, and the six within the City of Los Angeles accounted for approximately $45 million in Measure ULA taxes, which come at a 5.5 percent rate on sales of more than $10.5 million.\nThis ranking is based on\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nanalysis of data via CBRE and Kidder Mathews through late-September and prior reporting. While there is still time for potential record-breakers, these are the deals that make the top 10 for 2025 by publication.\n1. Kitt at Warner Center\nWaterton\npurchased\nthe apartment complex in Woodland Hills, a neighborhood on the edge of the Santa Monica Mountains in the San Fernando Valley, for about $180 million, or roughly $345,000 per apartment. The seller, AMLI Residential, developed the property at 21200 Kittridge Street around two decades ago. It is within the master-planned community Warner Center, where billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Rams Stanley Kroenke has proposed a $10 billion development. The city transfer tax came out to about $12 million.\nWaterton recently announced it purchased another apartment community at 21021 Erwin Street in Woodland Hills, less than five minutes away from Kitt at Warner Center, but didn\u2019t disclose price.\n2. Ovelo\nAEW Capital Management\npurchased\nthe seven-story apartment complex in Hollywood for $159 million, or about $431,000 per apartment. The sellers were Cal-Coast Development and Rescore, a real estate investment trust managed by Encore Capital Management. They developed the project\u00a0 at 1331 North Cahuenga Boulevard. The city transfer tax, which comprises a base tax and a special tax via Measure ULA, came out to about $9.5 million.\n3. Stella\nCarmel Partners\nbought\nStella, an apartment building in Marina del Rey, from Nuveen for $141 million, or about $578,000 an apartment, the priciest per unit deal on our ranking \u2014 and the priciest multifamily trade in Marina del Rey in more than a decade. Still, it\u2019s 15 percent less than what Nuveen paid for the property at 13488 Maxella Avenue. The city transfer tax came out to roughly $8 million.\n4. Chase Knolls\nJRK Property Holdings purchased the apartment complex in Sherman Oaks, a neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley, for $129 million, or about $322,000 per apartment from Waterton (our ranking\u2019s number one buyer). The sale of 13401 Riverside Drive was part of a more than $300 million deal that included a residential tower in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 The city transfer tax came out to about $7 million.\n5. Highridge Apartments\nThe Bascom Group bought Highridge Apartments, an apartment complex, at 28125 Peacock Ridge Drive in the coastal municipality of Rancho Palos Verdes, from Essex Property Trust for $127 million, or $494,000 per unit.\n6. Adeline\nThe Silicon Valley-based Sobrato Organization\npurchased\nthe apartment building in Glendale, for $126 million, or $536,000 per unit, from Rockwood Capital (recently integrated operations into Harrison Street Asset Management) and Mill Creek Residential, which developed the five-story property in 2015.\n7. Hills at Hacienda\nEagle Partners paid $107 million for a complex at 2401 Hacienda Boulevard in unincorporated Hacienda Height in eastern Los Angeles County. MG Properties was the seller and made about $306,000 per unit.\n8. The Fifty Five Fifty\nGrubb Properties and PCCP acquired a seven-story apartment building at 5550 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood for around $98 million, or $351,000 per unit, from Vanbarton Group. The deal was Grubb Properties\u2019 first buy of an existing community in the market. The city transfer tax came out to around $6 million.\n9. Eleve\nPacific Urban Investors\npurchased\nthe downtown Glendale apartment building. The Marcus &amp; Millichap Company paid $76 million for 200 East Broadway. The seller was Equity Residential. The deal came out to $365,000 an apartment for the property near billionaire Rick Caruso\u2019s Americana at Brand. The prior purchase price was $70.5 million.\n10. Fusion Encore\nThe Lighthouse Group\nbought\nthe Hollywood apartment complex at 1714 North McCadden Place for $74 million, or $339,000 a unit, from New York Life Investments. The price was a 27 percent discount compared with the property\u2019s prior trade. The deal was the second Hollywood multifamily buy in six months for the Lighthouse Group, which\npurchased\nan apartment building at 5750 Hollywood Boulevard for $54.5 million, though that one didn\u2019t make the ranking. The city transfer tax came out to around $4 million.\n",

A fatal shooting at a Midtown office tower raised questions about how best to protect tenants.\nThese and other stories had a major impact on real estate this year, and will continue to influence the industry in the years ahead.\nHere are some of 2025\u2019s most consequential New York real estate stories:\n1) Shooting at 345 Park Avenue\nThe tragic\nshooting\nof four people at Rudin Management\u2019s 345 Park Avenue deeply affected\nfriends, family and colleagues\nof the victims, and ramped up discussions about office security in the city.\nOn July 27, Shane Devon Tamura walked into the office tower with an assault rifle and killed three people in the lobby:\nWesley LePatner\n, chief executive officer of Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust; NYPD officer Didarul Islam; and Aland Etienne, a security guard.\nHe then took the elevator to Rudin\u2019s offices on the 33rd floor, thinking it was where the National Football Association is headquartered. There, he shot and killed\nJulia Hyman\n, an associate at Rudin, before turning the gun on himself.\nThe deaths left the real estate community reeling and sparked\nconversations\nabout potential ways to prevent future incidents and the\nlimitations\nof buildings already equipped with the best technology and security practices. A month after the shootings, Reps. Jerrold Nadler and Dan Goldman called on Congress to pass\ngun safety legislation\nthat, among other things, bans assault weapons and enacts universal background checks. (The gun used by Tamura was illegal to possess in New York but was purchased lawfully in Nevada.)\nThe shootings also inspired the City Council to pass legislation\nsetting minimum wages\nfor security guards and increasing training requirements.\n2)\nMamdani wins mayoral race\nReal estate professionals\ndonated\nmillions of dollars to political action committees\nbacking\nformer Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s run for mayor. When Zohran Mamdani\ndefeated\nhim in the primary (along with several other candidates vying for the job), some in the industry\nhoped\nMayor Eric Adams could gain enough momentum ahead of the general election, though such optimism didn\u2019t last long as the mayor trailed in the polls.\nDuring his campaign, the Democratic Socialist outlined several priorities that rankled landlords and the broader business community, including a promise to freeze rents on stabilized apartments for four years and to push the state to raise corporate and income taxes on the state\u2019s wealthiest.\nStill, Mamdani has also said that he is committed to reforming the city\u2019s property tax system and finding other ways to reduce costs for owners.\n3) Mortgage fraud saga\nFederal agencies ramped up their mortgage fraud investigations this year, extending an already\ntangled web\nof sponsors,\nattorneys\n, title agents and others. These parties were accused of perpetrating schemes that often involved\ninflated financials\nor sales prices to secure larger loans from various lenders.\nThis year saw the sentencing of some key players, including\nMoshe Silber\n, Fred Schulman,\nBaruch Drillman\nand\nEli Puretz\n. These cases involved properties and players outside New York but had larger implications for New York City-based firms. Fannie Mae blacklisted some title firms that were mentioned in fraud cases, though it\nreinstated\nMadison Title as an approved vendor in June.\n4) FARE Act goes into effect\nThe Fairness in Apartment Rental Expenses, or FARE Act,\nwent into effect\non June 11. The new law requires whoever hires a rental broker to pay said broker\u2019s fee. A broker who publishes a listing, however, is assumed to have been hired by the property\u2019s owner. In its\nlawsuit\nchallenging the law, the Real Estate Board of New York alleged that this provision violates the First Amendment because it discourages a specific type of speech (listings). REBNY has\nappealed\nthe case to the Second Circuit and is waiting on a decision.\nPublic rental\nlistings\nhave dropped and median rent prices have increased since the law was implemented, but it is tricky to disentangle the\nimpact\nof the law from other factors that influence such shifts, such as lack of supply and high demand.\n5) Housing approval overhaul\nMayor Eric Adams is leaving office with a legacy complicated by scandal. He was the first sitting mayor in recent history to face\ncriminal charges\n, which were\ndropped\nat the behest of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration in what was seen (including by federal prosecutors who resigned over it) as a trading of favors between the president and mayor.\nBut the Adams administration also shepherded major changes that will allow more housing to be built throughout the city. City of Yes for Housing Opportunity was approved last year, and this year, the mayor\u2019s Charter Revision Commission placed four proposals on the ballot that would allow certain housing projects to either sidestep City Council approval or would allow the City Council\u2019s rejection of a project to be appealed.\nThe measures,\napproved\nby voters in November, shorten some project approval timelines and weaken the tradition of member deference, in which Council members voted on land use issues according to the wishes of the local member. To what extent these changes lead to more housing remains to be seen, and will rely on many factors, including capital available for housing and the relationship between the next mayor and City Council leaders.\n",

        "content": "Eric Adams\u2019 administration is leaving Zohran Mamdani with another task: fixing the Hunts Point Produce Market.\nAdams announced a project to redevelop the Bronx wholesale complex responsible for distributing much of the city\u2019s fresh fruit and vegetables, Bloomberg\nreported\n. The project comes as the aging facility is weighed down by pollution and old infrastructure.\nExpected to cost $635 million, the redevelopment is expected to replace the facility with an all-electric market with better access to freight and rail transport. A joint venture led by Aurora Contractors and Primus Builders will eliminate diesel-powered transport refrigeration units, add refrigerated warehouse space and increase site-wide circulation, according to\nNew York YIMBY\n.\nFinancing for the project is split relatively evenly between federal grants ($145 million), New York City ($130 million) and New York State ($130 million). The city is also expecting to land $230 million in federal debt from the Department of Transportation.\nThe 100-acre facility handles more than 2.5 billion pounds of fruits and vegetables annually and is responsible for supplying approximately a quarter of the city\u2019s produce to its restaurants, bodegas and independent grocers.\nIn addition to creating 2,000 construction jobs, the redevelopment is expected to preserve existing employment at the facility. The next step in the project will be design work and environmental reviews overseen by the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation. Construction is being targeted for a start late next year.\n\u201cThis agreement represents an important milestone and creates a clear framework for the next phase of work as we advance planning and design for a modern, more sustainable market that supports our mission of feeding New York City with fresh produce from around the world,\u201d said Hunts Point Produce Market co-president Stephen Katzman, who added that he looked forward to collaborating with the Mamdani administration on the project.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Caesars owns the gambling facility, formerly\nIsle Casino\n.\nMillrose entered into an option arrangement giving Lennar the right to acquire the finished homesites, a structure that keeps the homebuilder\u2019s balance sheet relatively light on land while preserving control of future inventory.\nMillrose typically acquires residential land, installs infrastructure and then sells finished lots back to Lennar through option contracts shortly before the homes are sold to buyers.\nLennar filed plans in 2024 with 344 condos in seven midrise buildings and 82 townhouses in 10 three-story buildings, along with a clubhouse, fitness center, pool and 878 parking spaces.\nThe project reflects Lennar\u2019s increasing focus on multifamily-style, midrise residential buildings in land-constrained South Florida markets where assembling large tracts for traditional single-family subdivisions has become difficult.\nThe condo and townhouse community represents the latest residential phase at The Pomp, where Harrah\u2019s casino and a TopGolf facility are already operating, and developers are rolling out industrial and apartment components.\nIn 2022, TopGolf paid\n$14.7 million\nfor a nearly 11-acre site, where it built a three-story entertainment facility. A year later, Cordish and Caesars sold 87.8 acres within The Pomp to Boston-based Rockpoint, which is planning 1.5 million square feet of warehouses.

        "content": "Lenders across the Chicago metro went to court this year to settle troubled loans, bringing major foreclosure lawsuits downtown, in the suburbs and on the South Side.\nThe distress spread into hospitality, retail and even niche assets such as downtown parking garages, but the city\u2019s office buildings were the major target. Chicago\u2019s office market has\nstruggled to recover\nfrom the pandemic-era drop-off, with vacancy rates still twice as high as their pre-pandemic level. In October, the central business district\u2019s vacancy rate hit 28 percent, according to CBRE.\nThe Real Deal\ntallied the largest foreclosure lawsuits we saw in 2025. Properties are listed along with the amount lenders are looking to recover.\nThe list includes only cases where lenders filed foreclosure lawsuits. In some cases, landlords were able to stay out of court by handing over the keys to buildings through deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure. In other instances, lenders and special servicers refused compromise and went to court.\nIllinois Center | $260 million\nIn a dispute that spilled into court in 2024 but continued through 2025, AmTrust Realty\u2019s grip on the massive Illinois Center complex slipped after months of trying to stave off distress.\nIn November 2024, special servicer LNR Partners\nfiled to foreclose\non the New York-based landlord\u2019s $260 million loan for the two-tower property at 111 East Wacker Drive and 233 North Michigan Avenue. The trouble started when the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services vacated 170,000 square feet in 2023, leaving a hole in the 2.1 million-square-foot complex.\nAmTrust CEO Jonathan Bennett had previously claimed the firm was working toward a resolution, but LNR alleged the landlord stopped paying full debt service in January. Complicating matters, LNR claimed AmTrust never properly updated the loan\u2019s guarantor after the 2016 death of co-founder Michael Karfunkel\u2014a technical default that could pile on massive interest penalties.\n1100 South Michigan &amp; 1101 South Wabash | $187 million\nSu-Mei Yen, a longtime fixture in Chicago\u2019s hospitality scene, faced a double-barreled legal crisis this summer.\nSan Francisco-based lender ACORE Capital hit Yen and her firm, SB Yen, with a\n$187 million foreclosure suit\ntargeting two major South Loop hotels: the 172-room Best Western Grant Park and the 30-story Homewood Suites by Hilton. ACORE alleged that Yen\u2019s firm not only defaulted on the loan but also failed to deposit hotel revenues into the required accounts, diverting cash to pay back affiliates instead.\nThe foreclosure came as Yen battled a separate lawsuit from Chinese EB-5 investors who claim they were defrauded out of over $18 million meant for the projects. The investors allege Yen and her daughter, Cassie Yen, mismanaged funds and intentionally allowed the loans to default, jeopardizing their green card prospects.\nACORE has been coming after debtors elsewhere in Chicago this year. The lender\nseized a 16-story River North building\nfrom landlord JRE Partners in September through a deed-in-lieu. Property records show JRE borrowed $73 million from ACORE to finance the purchase, and the deed in lieu valued the property at nearly $60 million.\nWestbrook Corporate Center | $87 million\nIn the suburbs, CWCapital Asset Management rejected a lowball buyout offer from Group RMC and instead\nfiled an $87 million foreclosure\nsuit against the New York-based landlord.\nGroup RMC had offered to buy out the note on the five-building Westbrook Corporate Center in Westchester for $52.5 million\u2014roughly half the loan\u2019s original balance\u2014after a major tenant, Follett Higher Education Group, slashed its footprint.\nDespite the landlord\u2019s offer to inject $6 million in fresh equity to stabilize the 1.1 million-square-foot campus, CWCapital rejected the proposal and moved to seize the property. It\u2019s a harsh blow for Group RMC, which had spent the last few years aggressively acquiring suburban office campuses across the Midwest, betting on a recovery that has yet to materialize.\nRuben Espinoza\u2019s Southwest Side Portfolio | $68 million\nFlorida-based investor Ruben Espinoza spent 2025 mired in legal fights, capped by a\n$68 million foreclosure filed\nby Wilmington National Trust on two Southwest Side commercial properties.\nThe unpaid debt is split between two properties: Espinoza allegedly owes $43 million, including interest and fees, on the 661,000-square-foot Chicago Business Center at 2600 West 35th Street, according to Wilmington. He owes another $24 million at a 110,000-square-foot distribution center on South Damen Avenue.\nA receiver has already been appointed to take control of the assets, but that was just the start of Espinoza\u2019s legal troubles this year.\nEspinoza is\nfacing a lawsuit\nfrom a commercial tenant at the South Damen Avenue building Wilmington is foreclosing on. Produce wholesaler Galfresh Produce alleges Espinoza took a deposit and first month\u2019s rent but never allowed them to move into the building.\nEspinoza\nsued business partner Igor Gabal\nover a $6.2 million insurance payout at a West Adams Street building. Both investors are claiming the other misappropriated funds and trying to shut each other out of shared bank accounts. In October, a judge\nordered Espinoza to pay $631,000\nin a separate case where state Sen. Robert F. Martwick Jr. accused Espinoza of not paying Martwick\u2019s law firm.\nElsewhere, Espinoza is\nbatting a lender\nwho is moving to foreclose on a $9.6 million loan tied to a River North loft portfolio. Rialto Capital filed a foreclosure in March, but Espinoza is disputing the foreclosure.\nThe Poetry Garage | $33 million\nIn a dispute over a downtown parking garage, lender Swiss Re wasn\u2019t satisfied with taking back the troubled building. It came after the investors too.\nLender Swiss Re\nmoved to foreclose over a $33 million loan\non the literary-themed Poetry Garage at 201 West Madison Street. The investor group led by\u00a0 Richard Kaplan of Syndicated Equities and John Hammerschlag of Hammerschlag &amp; Co. defaulted on the loan in March, reinsurance giant Swiss Re said in court.\nSwiss Re gained control of the property with a $21.5 million credit bid this fall, and later secured a $9.6 million deficiency judgment against the owner group to cover the rest of the loan balance.\nThe investors had struggled with the parking structure since the pandemic decimated Loop office occupancy, securing multiple loan modifications before finally defaulting on the $33.2 million debt when it matured this spring.\n",

The location spans five parcels: 36-45 37th Street, 47-61 37th Street, 36-61 37th Street, 37-21 Northern Boulevard and 37-15 Northern Boulevard.\nThe properties are owned by Vesta Industries and Vecta Industries, according to property records. The site was once a Cadillac dealership \u2014 even featured in the 1990 movie \u201cCadillac Man\u201d \u2014 before recently housing the stage lighting equipment supplier arm of Kaufman Astoria Studios.\nTerms of the 10-year lease \u2014 which encompasses a warehouse, mechanic shop and showroom space \u2014 were not disclosed. The average asking rent for Queens industrial space in the third quarter was $34.27 per square foot, according to CBRE.\nJaffe Realty\u2019s Brian Jaffe represented the tenant in the deal, while Sholom &amp; Zuckerbrot Realty\u2019s Franklin Zuckerbrot and Joe Eliasoph represented the owner.\nThe Long Island City location will be Teddy Volkswagen\u2019s second in the city, following the operation of a dealership in the Bronx. The newest location is expected to generate 100 local jobs, according to the car dealer.\nThe flagship is across the boulevard from the Standard Motors Product Building, involved in its own real estate transaction in recent months.\nIn September, Scott Rechler\u2019s RXR\nsold\nthe property at 37-18 Northern Boulevard to Jack Guttman\u2019s Pearl Realty Management for $42 million. The sale of the 300,000-square-foot Queens office building broke down to $140 per square foot; Rechler purchased the former automotive parts manufacturing facility\nfor $110 million\nin 2014.\nOther notable dealership leases in the past 18 months include Ferrari signing a 10-year lease for 7,600 square feet at 425 Park Avenue in April for a showroom and private club Classic Car Club Manhattan taking 60,000 square feet for a flagship at 645 11th Avenue in Hell\u2019s Kitchen last June.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "California is entering an affordable housing refinancing crunch, with Yardi Matrix reporting that roughly $860 million in commercial mortgages on fully affordable properties will mature in 2026.\nThat figure rises sharply to $6.9 billion by 2030 and $13.3 billion over the next decade, underscoring the scale of upcoming capital needs. The 2026 maturities are concentrated in the state\u2019s largest markets:\nLos Angeles\n($390.3 million), the\nBay Area\n($223.1 million), Orange County ($64.1 million), and the San Fernando Valley ($76 million),\nGlobest reported\n. That\u2019s a total of $21 billion needed in the next three years.\nDespite these looming maturities, the sector is not facing widespread distress.\nAffordable housing benefits from government-backed financing, subsidized revenue streams and longer loan terms, all of which have historically limited defaults. Recent policy changes in the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act further reinforce stability. Enhancements to the\nLow-Income Housing Tax Credit program\nare expected to\nexpand opportunities\nfor recapitalization through resyndication, supporting both capital improvements and long-term affordability.\nYardi\u2019s analysis draws from a national database of 26,000 fully affordable properties \u2014 defined as assets where at least 90 percent of units are rent-restricted through government programs \u2014 totaling 3.5 million units.\nIndustry leaders echo the view that the refinancing environment, while challenging, remains fundamentally strong.\nCalifornia continues to attract lender participation due to high rental demand, meaningful rent advantages, and regulatory frameworks such as the Community Reinvestment Act and mandates for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, according to JLL\u2019s David Lott. State-level supports \u2014 including the California Welfare Exemption and various soft subordinate debt programs\n\u2014 further bolster refinancing prospects.\nLott highlighted the recent reduction of the LIHTC \u201c50 percent test\u201d to 25 percent, a shift expected to unlock constrained tax-exempt bond capacity and stimulate both renovation and new development. The new law stipulates that to qualify for 4 percent bonds, a property must have at least 25 percent of its units affordable, compared to a previous threshold of half.\nFrom a talent perspective, the new market is \u201ccreating opportunity\u201d for people with the right skill set, Chris Papa of executive search firm Jackson Lucas told Globest.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing owners, lenders, and public agencies prioritize leaders who know how to navigate complex capital stacks, work with government programs, and stabilize assets,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, refinancing will be more complicated in a higher-rate, higher-cost environment \u2014 but that pressure is precisely what\u2019s driving demand for experienced talent.\u201d\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s housing market is refusing to take the hint.\nWhile home prices across much of the country are flattening out or sliding, the Chicago area just posted the fastest price growth of any major U.S. metro, highlighting the city\u2019s durability even as buyers feel a squeeze from inflation and higher interest rates. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat the median home price in the Chicago region rose by\u00a0 5.83 percent in October, to $365,000, from a year earlier, according to S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices data released Tuesday. That was the highest increase among the 19 major cities tracked in the report and more than four times the national growth rate of 1.36 percent. (Detroit was excluded this month because of incomplete data.)\nThe gain also comfortably\noutpaced inflation\n. While a federal government shutdown delayed a national inflation reading for October, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported\nChicago-area\ninflation of 2.9 percent in September and 2.5 percent in November, putting local home price growth at roughly twice the pace of rising consumer prices.\nIt marked the second consecutive month Chicago topped the Case-Shiller leaderboard. In September, prices were up 5.45 percent year over year, again roughly four times the national increase, according to the index.\nNicholas Godec, head of fixed income tradables and commodities at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, said in a statement that Chicago now leads all major markets, breaking with a slight decline in inflation-adjusted home values over the past year nationally.\nThe broader picture shows just how much Chicago is swimming\nagainst the current\n. According to the index, home prices fell in nine of the 19 cities tracked in October and were essentially flat in four others. Tampa posted the steepest annual drop, down 4.17 percent. New York was the next-strongest major market after Chicago, with prices up 4.95 percent, followed by Cleveland at 4.06 percent.\nA year ago,\nChicago\nwas rising quickly but not wildly out of step with the nation. In October 2024, prices here were up 6.24 percent year over year, compared to a national gain of 3.6 percent. Since then, growth elsewhere has cooled sharply. Nationwide price growth is now running at about 62 percent of its pace a year ago, while Chicago\u2019s is still at roughly 93 percent.\nThe resilience traces back to the pandemic boom, when Chicago never fully joined the froth. At the peak in October 2021, local prices were up 11.5 percent annually \u2014 the slowest growth among the 20 Case-Shiller cities \u2014 while places like Phoenix surged more than 30 percent.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "South Florida real estate hit highs and lows in 2025, but construction financing flowed \u2014 for the right projects \u2014 and billionaire developers and investors like Amancio Ortega and Steve Ross pumped money into the tri-county region.\nOffice and multifamily developers backpedalled, despite a series of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Condo developers slogged through the summer, but demand picked up in the fall.\nDrama in the real estate scene was wilder than\n\u201cMembers Only: Palm Beach,\u201d\nfrom\ncondo association fights\nto legal battles involving some of the\nbiggest real estate dynasties\n.\nMeanwhile, in Tallahassee, Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Legislature pitched a number of proposals to\nreduce or eliminate property taxes\n\u2014 the fate of those will be determined in 2026.\nThe industry also mourned the deaths of influential players.\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the top stories of the year:\nBillionaire moves\nRoss, owner of the Miami Dolphins and founder and CEO of Related Ross, is among the billionaires making moves. Ross has about a dozen office properties (completed and in the pipeline) in West Palm Beach and was one of the most successful office landlords this year. Of this year\u2019s 10 biggest office leases in South Florida, Related Ross was the only landlord to sign a new-to-market firm: tech company ServiceNow took space at one of Ross\u2019 office buildings.\nRoss made downtown West Palm his\nplayground\nthrough Related Ross, his new company. His portfolio includes at least 18 buildings and a mixed-use complex collectively spanning more than 3.8 million square feet of offices, retail and restaurants, as well as about 1,500 condo, apartment and hotel units, according to\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nanalysis.\nZara billionaire Ortega doubled down on South Florida, making two big plays in Miami-Dade in 2025: his family office paid\n$274.4 million\nfor the 30-story Sabadell Financial Center in Brickell in October. A month earlier, the family office paid about\n$110 million\nfor Atlas Plaza in Miami\u2019s Design District.\nWe can\u2019t ignore Ken Griffin, billionaire hedge fund manager, who acquired fewer properties than in previous years but is still moving forward with plans for a\n$2.5 billion\nbayfront supertall in Miami that will house his Citadel hedge fund and sister firm, Citadel Securities. He also scored approval for a 30,000-plus-square-foot private marina with a crew pavilion, owner\u2019s suite and a pool on Terminal Island in Miami Beach.\nOn the residential front, Rockstar Energy billionaire\nRussell Savage\n, previously known as Russell Weiner, picked up trophy properties in Palm Beach County and Miami Beach as he builds his ultra-luxury residential portfolio.\nMegadeals\nDealflow at the highest end of the market soared to new levels.\nOak Row Equities and Vlad Doronin\u2019s OKO Group closed last month on their\nrecord $520 million\npurchase of Aimco\u2019s waterfront Brickell assemblage, where they plan an Aman-branded hotel and residential development. Mariposa Real Estate is also a partner. The deal marks the priciest development site sale in South Florida.\nOff-market resi sales set city and county records as well. In Palm Beach, billionaire cosmetics mogul\nWilliam Lauder\nreportedly sold 2.3 oceanfront acres for more than $160 million to billionaire Microsoft Excel creator Charles Simonyi, as part of a $350 million assemblage on the island. The deal was not recorded publicly.\nTwo Roads hits dead end in condo buyout litigation\nTwo Roads Development took a big blow in October, when Florida\u2019s Supreme Court\ndeclined to take up\nthe Biscayne 21 condo buyout case.\nThe story is complicated, but it started in 2022, when Taylor Collins and Reid Boren\u2019s Two Roads acquired the majority of condos at Biscayne 21, an older Miami condo building in Edgewater. The developer-controlled condo association then voted to amend the condo declaration\u2019s termination statute, lowering the threshold to 80 percent from 100 percent. A termination of the association is a required legal step so the developer could eventually knock the building down.\nTwo Roads launched sales later that year of an Edition Residences planned for the site. Then, the holdout owners sued the developer and the developer-controlled association. All the residents eventually had to move out, and the building is no longer habitable.\nThe lawsuit moved its way through the courts, and the Third District Court of Appeal issued an opinion earlier this year siding with the holdout unit owners. The court affirmed that the original condo declaration required unanimous consent for termination, invalidating the developer-controlled association\u2019s amendment.\nThe developer vowed to take the issue to Florida\u2019s Supreme Court, but the court\ndeclined to hear the issue\n, giving the holdout owners more leverage. Many expect Two Roads will settle with them.\nIn memoriam\nThe industry mourned the deaths of influential players, including developer\nDonald Soffer\n, who founded the city of Aventura.\nDarin Tansey, a longtime residential agent in Miami Beach, died unexpectedly in September at the age of 50. The Douglas Elliman agent moved to the city nearly two decades earlier, and built his business in the luxury sector. Tansey was a mentor to many:\ntributes poured in\nonline and at a celebration of life held at the La Gorce Country Club.\nIn August, Isaac Kodsi, a developer and real estate attorney,\ndied at the age of 59\nat his Coconut Grove home. Isaac, the brother of developer Dan Kodsi, was developing Arbor Residences, a previously stalled condo project he acquired out of foreclosure in 2023. Kodsi also founded Shake Wellness, a trampoline-based fitness business that he ran out of his home.\nMultifamily developers list their sites\nMany developers\nput their sites up for sale\nin 2025, in part due to higher construction costs, interest rates, a supply overhang and slower rent growth. A flood of completed projects in 2023 and 2024 suppressed rent growth, with prices falling in some neighborhoods, and developers had to offer tenants concessions to lease up their buildings.\nAt\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s Miami Forum in November, developers\npushed back\non the idea that a supply overhang exists. Developers Bruce Menin, Erik Rutter and Joe Lubeck instead pointed to skittish equity investment and other barriers to entry.\nA recent uptick in construction loans for multifamily projects suggests the market may be improving. In one of the larger deals that was recorded in December, Focus and Group Fox scored a\n$250 million construction loan\nfor their planned multifamily tower called Brickell Starlite, on the site of the former Starlite Motel at 128 Southwest Seventh Street in Miami.\n",

        "content": "A Beverly Hills residence with an A-list history that includes crooner Ricky Martin sold for $35 million, making a big splash to cap 2025.\nThe purchase price of\n1309 Davies Drive\n, which neighbors some of the market\u2019s most legendary homes, amounts to over $3,804 per square foot, according to listing sites. That would be a steal given the residence first hit the market in August for $75 million. Later that month, the price was reduced to just under $50 million.\nCarl Gambino\nof the Gambino Group at Compass represented the buyer and the seller. He declined to comment on the sale Wednesday.\nThe sale of 1309 Davies Drive is now one of Gambino\u2019s priciest Beverly Hills closings this year, after representing the buyer in the April sale of 942 North Alpine Drive for $51.8 million.\nA deed on the Davies Drive property with the buyer\u2019s information is not yet available, as the transaction closed Tuesday.\nProperty records show a shell company bearing the home\u2019s address for its name as the seller. It\u2019s registered with a Broomfield, Colo. address with ties to Blue Spruce Capital Corp.\nIt\u2019s the home\u2019s previous ownership dating back to before the LLC bought the property that makes for a robust celebrity lineage.\nAside from Martin, Oscar winner Michael Caine, who appeared in \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d and \u201cThe Cider House Rules\u201d also once called the property home, as did the family of singer and actress Doris Day.\nSurrounding the property are some of the market\u2019s most prominent residences and listings.\nThat includes 1261 Angelo Drive, also known as the\nPritzker Estate\n, listed for $175 million. A roughly 10-minute walk from the Davies Drive property will get someone to the residence being sold by Hyatt Hotels heir Anthony Pritzker and his ex-wife and philanthropist Jeanne Pritzker.\nA little farther out is Chartwell Estate at 875 Nimes Road. The property sits about 3 miles away and is known for its appearance in the opening credits of \u201cThe Beverly Hillbillies.\u201d\nLachlan Murdoch\n, son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, paid $150 million for Chartwell Estate in 2019 to notch a state record at the time. That\u2019s since been eclipsed by 2024\u2019s\n$210 million sale\nof a Malibu home once owned by Oakley founder Jim Jannard.\nThe new resident of 1309 Davies Drive is working with quite the spread. The six-bedroom, 12-bathroom home sits on over 2 acres.\nIn addition to the main residence, the estate has a motor court for over 20 vehicles, a tennis court, a children\u2019s playground, gardens, a separate house for security as well as a guest house.\n",

        "content": "Owner-user deals that have become popular in Houston are spreading north to Dallas.\nProvident Realty Advisors is the latest company to choose office ownership over leasing in the acquisition of One Lincoln Park, a 10-story office building at 8401 North Central Expressway near Northwest Highway. The Dallas Morning News first reported the trade, citing Dallas County deed records.\nThe\nfirm\ndescribed the property as \u201cour future home\u201d in a LinkedIn post announcing the deal, signaling plans to occupy the building rather than treat it as a pure investment play, a trend that has been playing out elsewhere in the\nTexas Triangle\n, specifically Houston.\nOwner-user deals \u2014 meaning deals where the business using the space buys the property rather than leasing it \u2014 have boosted Houston\u2019s sluggish office sector, where depressed values make buying more appealing than leasing.\nThe seller was Dallas-based\nTriumph Financial\n, which bought the property just last year with plans to make it its own headquarters. The transaction closed Dec. 17. A purchase price was not disclosed, though the Dallas Central Appraisal District values the 257,000-square-foot building at nearly $56.6 million.\nColliers executive vice president Jack Crews led the brokerage team that assisted Provident in the acquisition.\nTriumph\u2019s quick flip underscores the opportunistic churn still shaping the Dallas-Fort Worth office market. The financial holding company, whose portfolio includes TriumphPay, Triumph and TBK Bank, acquired the property in 2024 in an off-market, all-cash deal after Atlanta-based Piedmont Office Realty Trust owned it for roughly a decade. Piedmont sold the building for $54 million.\nAt the time of Triumph\u2019s purchase, the building was just 12 percent occupied, according to Colliers data. Triumph began clearing out tenants as part of a plan to reposition the 1999-vintage property \u2014 which was renovated in 2022 \u2014 ahead of a headquarters move-in slated for 2026.\nBut market interest intervened. As conditions improved, the company decided selling was in its best interest.\n\u201cWhile our initial plan was to make it our headquarters, we received significant interest from potential buyers during the preparation phase,\u201d Triumph Financial said in a statement.\nProvident\u2019s\nbuy comes as the DFW office market shows signs of stabilization, though the recovery remains uneven. Leasing activity picked up last quarter, helping push the region\u2019s overall vacancy rate down 30 basis points to 25 percent, according to Partners Real Estate\u2019s third-quarter 2025 report.\nThat momentum has largely favored newer, well-located buildings, reinforcing a flight-to-quality trend that continues to punish older stock and downtown submarkets. Downtown Dallas posted a 27.2 percent vacancy rate, the second-highest of any U.S. downtown, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Mayor Eric Adams\u2019\nefforts to stack the Rent Guidelines Board\nhave hit a snag.\nLliam Finn, a senior financial advisor with Merrill Lynch, has decided against serving as a public representative on the board less than two weeks after Adams appointed him, three sources with knowledge of the decision confirmed to\nThe Real Deal\nWednesday. This gives the mayor less than 12 hours to find a replacement appointment before he leaves office. It is unclear if he will be able to do so.\nA spokesperson for the mayor did not immediately comment. Finn did not return a message seeking more information.\nAdams this month announced\nthe appointment of two new members\nto the board, Finn and Sagar Sharma, an attorney with Legal Services NYC\u2019s housing unit, as a tenant representative.\nHe also reappointed landlord attorney Christina Smyth as an owner representative and Arpit Gupta as a public one.\nThe last-minute appointments were viewed by some as an attempt to sabotage Mayor-elect\nZohran Mamdani\u2019s campaign pledge to freeze rents\nfor stabilized tenants for four years. The city\u2019s Rent Guidelines Board decides what rent increases are permitted on one- and two-year leases, though mayors have influenced their decisions.\nThe appointments meant that most of the board\u2019s members in Mamdani\u2019s first year would be Adams\u2019 appointees. He can replace four members (the chair, as well as members whose terms are expired that represent the public, owners and tenants) when he takes office. He can replace the other five in 2027.\nIf Adams doesn\u2019t replace Finn, Mamdani would then have five potential appointees in his first year in office, meaning that he might have an easier time convincing the board of a rent freeze. However, the board is supposed to be an independent body, and a rent freeze could lead to a legal challenge from landlords.\n",

        "content": "After years of unrealized condo dreams, a well-located Gold Coast property is headed for a more grounded reset.\nChicago-based developer Mavrek acquired 12\u201316 West Maple Street, a four-story, roughly 20,000-square-foot building near the corner of State and Maple streets for $6.5 million, with plans to renovate and reposition the asset as a modern retail and office property, CoStar reported. Urbanize Chicago\nreported\nthat the deal was announced by the buyer, which is betting on the corridor\u2019s foot traffic and scarcity of available space rather than another high-rise swing.\nThe\nbuilding\nsits on a 7,900-square-foot site with 75 feet of frontage along Maple Street, a high-visibility stretch just east of State Street. It\u2019s partially occupied, including by CorePower Yoga on the fourth floor, providing some in-place income as\nMavrek\nmaps out its overhaul.\nCalmwater Capital\n, the California-based lender that took control of the property through a deed in lieu of foreclosure nearly five years ago, sold the site. Greenstone Partners was hired to market the asset.\nThe transaction closes a long and winding chapter for a property that has repeatedly tempted developers aiming sky-high. Maple &amp; Ash co-owners David Pisor and Jim Lasky bought the site in 2017 for $13.1 million and pitched an ultra-luxury 22-story condominium tower with just 12 units. That plan stalled, as did a later proposal in 2022 for a 34-story condo tower by another development group.\nInstead of chasing entitlements for a vertical project, Mavrek is leaning into what the site already has: ground-level retail potential in one of Chicago\u2019s priciest and most pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods. The\nGold Coast\nremains a magnet for luxury brands, high-end dining and affluent shoppers, anchored by Oak Street boutiques like Herm\u00e8s, Dior and Chanel and restaurant heavyweights including Gibsons and Maple &amp; Ash next door.\n\u201cThere\u2019s very limited sites like this available that come around,\u201d Greenstone Partners CEO Danny Spitz said in a\nstatement\n. \u201cThe location sells itself.\u201d\nMavrek tapped Mid-America Real Estate Group to handle leasing, signaling a push to land top-tier retail and office tenants rather than speculative concepts.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The expansion of artificial intelligence wealth across the Bay Area is reshaping luxury residential markets throughout Northern and Central California, driving a surge in purchases from Napa to Carmel.\nBrokers said that many of these properties are not primary residences, but\nweekend retreats\n, long\u2011term investments or future retirement homes for tech professionals with growing liquidity, the San Francisco Business Times reported. Data confirmed the trend.\nIn the North Bay, there has been a strong influx of affluent buyers acquiring second, third and even fourth homes, Ohana Realty\u2019s Soren Olsen said. At Montage Residences Healdsburg, a project with 25 turnkey luxury homes, only one remains unsold, with roughly 30 percent of buyers coming from the Bay Area. Olsen attributed the demand to the spillover of new AI wealth from Silicon Valley and the East Bay into drive\u2011to destinations like wine country.\nSince September, luxury and ultraluxury home sales in Napa and Sonoma counties have risen 58 percent year\u2011over\u2011year, according to Compass analyst Patrick Carlisle. The region now has the highest number of $5 million\u2011plus homes in contract in at least two years. Napa and Sonoma also offer the widest selection of high\u2011end listings in the Bay Area, including 114 active listings above $5 million, 31 above $10 million, and eight above $20 million. A key differentiator for these markets is the amount of land that comes with the house.\n\u201cThe median lot size for homes listed in the two counties at $10 million-plus is well over 50 acres, while in the rest of the Bay Area, it is just a little above 1 acre,\u201d Carlisle told the San Francisco Business Times. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different style of living for the most affluent homebuyers.\u201d\nAgents across the region described a diverse mix of tech buyers.\nGrace Lucero of Vanguard Properties said she has seen weekend home seekers, early retirees and long\u2011term planners building multi\u2011lot compounds. Many are in their 30s and 40s, often paying all cash and leveraging stock wealth.\nTech buyers\n, especially those tied to AI, continue to favor\nNapa Valley\n, with some acquiring large tracts of land for future vineyard estates, Robyn Bentley of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate said. Several brokerages have expanded their wine country agent count, including\nChristie\u2019s Sereno\nand\nColdwell Banker\n.\nThe trend extends beyond wine country.\nMarin County\u2019s Stinson Beach is seeing increased AI\u2011driven demand, while Carmel and Pebble Beach are attracting Bay Area professionals seeking a two\u2011hour escape with natural beauty and hybrid\u2011work convenience. Monterey County\u2019s largest 2025 sale so far involved buyers from an AI infrastructure company, according to agent Simona Martin.\nFarther south, San Luis Obispo County is drawing younger tech buyers, many in their early 30s, purchasing second homes, Airbnbs and investment properties near Avila Beach, Pismo Beach and Paso Robles. Many have ties to Cal Poly.\nSome AI\u2011affluent buyers are even looking internationally. Compass agent Joske Thompson said he has seen growing interest in second homes in Panama and other countries, driven by asset diversification and favorable currency exchange rates.\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "Investors have become major buyers of housing lots in the neighborhoods hardest hit by the January 2025 California wildfires, accounting for roughly 40 percent of all lots sold in the most affected ZIP codes.\nAn analysis of county records shows that in Pacific Palisades, investors purchased 48 of 119 lots, or 40.3 percent, sold in the third quarter of 2025 \u2014 compared with zero lot sales of any kind a year earlier,\nRedfin News reported\n. In Altadena, investors bought 27 of 61 lots (44.3 percent), also up from zero the prior year. And in Malibu, investors purchased 19 of 43 lots (44.2 percent), more than double their 21.4 percent share a year earlier.\nAround 80 percent of those lots previously had homes on them.\nThe surge in investor purchases comes as fire\u2011damaged neighborhoods face slow rebuilding timelines, insurance challenges and a glut of land listings. Redfin agents report that many\nAltadena\nresidents, especially elderly homeowners and those who were underinsured, are accepting low offers because they lack the financial means to rebuild. Many homes destroyed there dated to the 1940s and 1950s, and owners have waited nearly a year for permits. Some residents remain in nearby rentals; others have left the area entirely.\nPacific Palisades presents a stark contrast. With average household incomes near $400,000, many displaced homeowners have purchased temporary residences \u2014 often multimillion\u2011dollar homes in Santa Monica, Santa Barbara, Manhattan Beach, Orange County or San Diego \u2014 while planning high\u2011end rebuilds. One buyer purchased a $3.8 million Santa Monica home while preparing to rebuild with a prominent architect; another bought a $4.7 million Pacific Palisades home after losing a Malibu property.\nAcross the analyzed ZIP codes in the neighborhoods, listings far exceed sales. Lot listings have surged to 309 in Pacific Palisades, from seven a year earlier. In Altadena, 225 homes are listed for sale, up from two a year ago. And in Malibu, 214 properties are on the market compared to 125 a year ago.\nWith so much supply, sellers are cutting prices.\n\u201cMany of the lots that are selling in Altadena are in the $500,000- to $600,000-range\u201d said Redfin agent Sylva Khayalian. \u201cIf there was still a home on them, they might sell for $1 million or more.\u201d\nTypical lot sale prices were $510,000 in Altadena, $1.6 million in Pacific Palisades, and $1.3 million in Malibu.\nSingle\u2011family home sales remain depressed relative to pre\u2011fire levels, though they have rebounded from record lows immediately after the disaster. Pacific Palisades reported 31 home sales in the three months ending Nov. 30, down from 45 a year earlier, while Altadena saw 58 sales, down from 67. Lot sales now outnumber home sales in both areas, reversing historical patterns and prices that faced\ndownward pressure\n.\nIt\u2019s common for investors to buy homes after a\nnatural disaster\n, as Insurance costs and remediation burdens present major obstacles to rebuilding. Redfin agents note that some homeowners, overwhelmed by ash, smoke and lead\nremediation expenses\n, grimly joke that rebuilding is harder than losing the home outright.\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

In addition to Tesla, several other Elon Musk-associated firms have left the state, namely SpaceX and X. Oracle, led by Larry Ellison,\nrelocated its headquarters\nin 2020.\nA number of these companies \u2014 In\u2011N\u2011Out, Playboy, Oracle and Musk\u2019s companies \u2014 tie directly to California\u2019s image as a center of glamor, cars and tech-created wealth. \u201cThe California dream is about the opportunity to be discovered, but today you can do that from anywhere with a social media account,\u201d WeHo Online said.\nMotivations cited by departing companies\nand residents\nare consistent. They include high taxes, extensive regulation, elevated business costs, homelessness, public safety concerns, school system challenges, and political or social tensions.\nCalifornia\u2019s business climate rankings reinforce these concerns. The Tax Foundation places the state 49th in its Business Tax Climate Index, far behind states like Tennessee, Texas and Florida \u2014 destinations now attracting California companies.\nPopulation trends mirror the corporate shifts. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, California saw net emigration exceeding 200,000 people between 2024 and 2025. Fiscal pressures are mounting as well. The state faces a projected $50 billion to $70 billion deficit in 2025-2026, a stark reversal from the $97 billion surplus recorded in 2021-2022. The Reform California and Tax Foundation attributes the swing to California\u2019s reliance on income taxes from high earners and capital gains \u2014 revenues that decline when wealthy residents and major employers leave.\nLooking ahead, the state\u2019s new 2026 \u201cBillionaire Tax,\u201d which would require individuals classified as billionaires to pay 5 percent of their wealth annually, is expected by critics to accelerate the outflow of high\u2011net\u2011worth individuals and job\u2011creating companies.\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "The branding is set for one of Downtown San Antonio\u2019s most closely watched redevelopment sites on the River Walk.\nLaredo-based International Bank of Commerce plans to convert part of its downtown office complex at 175 East Houston Street into a roughly 300-key JW Marriott, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n.\nDesign documents submitted to the city reveal IBC\u2019s plans to plant Marriott International\u2019s luxury flag at IBC Centre I, while keeping the bank\u2019s adjacent tower, IBC Centre II, as office space. The project also includes plans to develop a third structure on a 0.2-acre parcel at 151 East Travis Street. IBC\nbought the land\nlast year from Equity Secured Investments, which picked the parcel up at auction from Harris Bay who scrapped plans for a 121-room hotel.\nThe third building is set to include parking, a rooftop pool and other hotel amenities. Renderings depict a multi-level addition designed to support parking and guest amenities, adding variety to a property long dominated by office use. HKS Architects &amp; Designers and SWA Group are leading the design team. Dimension Hospitality, which manages the Embassy Suites by Hilton San Antonio Riverwalk Downtown, is attached as the hotel operator.\nIn a statement to city staff, the project team framed the development as a statement piece for the urban core. The proposed hotel would serve as a \u201ccultural and architectural anchor,\u201d the team wrote, tying together the historic 1926 Texas Theater fa\u00e7ade with the adaptive reuse of O\u2019Neil Ford\u2019s 1983 office building. The goal, according to the submission, is a hospitality destination that honors San Antonio\u2019s architectural heritage while leaning into the energy of the River Walk.\nThe move formalizes a pivot IBC has been signaling since a major office tenant walked away.\nVisionworks\nannounced in 2024 that it would vacate its large lease in the roughly 280,000-square-foot building, creating a hole that bank executives were reluctant to try to refill in a\nsoft downtown office market\n.\nIBC Bank Executive Vice President Bernardo De La Garza has previously stated that office tenants are still avoiding moves downtown. Newer buildings with deeper amenity packages, he added, have made it harder for older towers to compete.\nIBC told city officials it wants to begin construction in spring 2026, though the timeline still hinges on approvals. The proposal has been referred to the Historic and Design Review Commission, which will weigh in on the project\u2019s massing and treatment of nearby historic elements. A hearing date had not been set.\nIf approved, the\nJW Marriott\nwould add to downtown\u2019s hotel mix and highlight a broader trend playing out in Texas cities, where office owners are increasingly looking to hospitality and mixed-use conversions as a more viable path forward than trying to lease their way back to full occupancy.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Thanks, but no thanks.\nThat was the development team\u2019s response to the Adams administration\u2019s offer to build housing at another city-owned site if the developers dropped their lawsuit over their abandoned Elizabeth Street Garden project.\nThe administration\ndemanded\nlast week that Pennrose, Riseboro and Habitat for Humanity New York City and Westchester drop their legal fight over the garden project, known as Haven Green. In exchange, the city would designate the team as the developers of another city-owned site at 22 Suffolk Street.\nIn a Dec. 26 letter, First Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro gave the development team until Dec. 31 to abandon its\nlawsuit\n, which alleged that the administration did not have the legal authority to unilaterally declare Elizabeth Street Garden a city park.\nDevelopers shared a letter with\nThe Real Deal\nthat they sent to Mastro on Wednesday, stating that the offer provided in the \u201cwaning hours of the Adams Administration is not sufficient for us to abandon litigation that we believe is in the public interest.\u201d\nThe administration did not issue a request for proposals for the Suffolk Street site, intending to select the Haven Green developers using a \u201csole source\u201d method. City agencies typically bid out the opportunity to build on city-owned sites to determine the best team for the job. (The team led by Pennrose went through a public bidding process to win Haven Green.)\nWhen asked about the rejection, Mastro said, \u201cShame on them.\u201d\n\u201cYou can lead a horse to water but you can\u2019t make them drink,\u201d Mastro said in a statement. \u201cWe offered this group of affordable housing developers a chance to develop even more affordable housing at a neighboring site, but they turned it down because they would rather pursue a frivolous lawsuit over a site that has already been designated parkland and that they have no chance of reversing.\u201d\nThe developers want to try their luck in court and with the next mayor, and they believe a few factors are on their side.\nFor one, they argue that in order to turn Elizabeth Street Garden into an official park, such a land-use change would need to go through the city\u2019s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, or Ulurp. Another factor in their favor is that incoming Mayor Zohran Mamdani planned to evict the garden before Adams declared the site a city park.\n\u201cUltimately, the new administration should have the opportunity to determine whether to issue a designation letter [for Suffolk Street], how to address the legal issues surrounding the Elizabeth Street site, and how best to accomplish a feasible, sustainable, and trustworthy affordable housing plan for the city,\u201d the letter states.\nThe last-minute offer and rejection follow years\u2019 worth of controversy over the site. In 2017, the city awarded the developers the right to build 123 units of senior housing at the garden site. After several years of litigation, the city won the ability to move forward with its eviction of the nonprofit running the garden, but when Mastro joined this administration this year, he halted plans for the housing project.\nTo make up for\nabandoning\nHaven Green, Mastro said the city would pursue housing projects on three other sites: 22 Suffolk Street, 156-166 Bowery Street and 100 Gold Street. Mastro also received assurances from local Council member Chris Marte that he would support the rezonings necessary to build thousands of units across these sites.\nWhen Mamdani made clear that he would\nevict\nthe garden once in office, the Adams administration designated the city-owned site as parkland. Mamdani said at the time that undoing that action would prove nearly impossible because it would require buy-in from the state legislature.\nBut if a court decides that designation isn\u2019t valid, Mamdani\u2019s options may open up.\nThe developers also note in their letter that ballot measures approved in November weaken an individual Council member\u2019s ability to kill a rezoning that results in affordable housing.\n\u201cAlthough we hope the Council Member would support truly viable additional affordable housing sites regardless the outcome of the ongoing litigation, the reality is that the incoming administration does not need his approval to do so,\u201d the letter states. \u201cThus, by also maintaining the Elizabeth Street site, our lawsuit advances the cause of affordable housing.\u201d\nComplicating matters is the fact that the Adams administration also reached a licensing agreement with the nonprofit Elizabeth Street Garden to continue operating the park through the next 10 years, with the option of two five-year extensions. The nonprofit has also agreed to pay $100,000 it owes in back rent for the site, in 10 annual installments over the next decade.\nThe developers indicate in their letter that the licensing agreement reinforced their decision to stick with their lawsuit.\n",

        "content": "Zohran Mamdani has added a Department of Buildings commissioner to his incoming administration.\nThe mayor-elect announced on Wednesday the appointment of Ahmed Tigani, Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 acting commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, as the head of the agency.\nThe announcement comes hours before Mamdani is set to take over as New York City\u2019s 112th mayor. The 34-year-old former Assembly member will be sworn in at midnight during a ceremony held in an out-of-service subway station under City Hall.\nTigani took over HPD in March, after stints as the first deputy commissioner and chief diversity officer of the department. His promotion came after Adams\ntapped the previous commissioner\n, Adolfo Carri\u00f3n, to step in as the deputy mayor of housing, economic development and workforce after Maria Torres-Springer resigned from the post amid the fallout from the Department of Justice\u2019s corruption charges against Adams.\nBefore joining HPD, Tigani served as the deputy commissioner of the Office of Neighborhood Strategies and the chief of staff to the Department of Buildings commissioner under former Mayor Bill De Blasio.\nIn a press release, Mamdani\u2019s team described Tigani\u2019s appointment as demonstrating the administration\u2019s \u201cfocus on experienced public servants with a proven track record of translating progressive vision into operational results.\u201d\nTigani in a statement described his vision for the agency as \u201ctransparent, efficient, and focused on serving New Yorkers.\u201d His appointment was announced alongside two others, including Louise Yeung as chief climate officer and Emmy Liss as executive director of the Office of Child Care.\nLast week, Mamdani\nappointed Leila Bozorg\nas the deputy mayor of housing and planning. Bozorg previously served in the Adams administration as the executive director of housing, a position he created two years ago. She was also a member of Adams\u2019 Charter Revision Commission, the group responsible for the four housing-related ballot measures that New Yorkers voted on last month.\nIn the press release, Bozorg, who worked with Tigani under the Adams administration, cast the incoming commissioner as a \u201cproven leader who has tackled the hardest housing problems head-on.\u201d\n",

        "content": "In his final day in office, Mayor Eric Adams handed a win to multifamily landlords and brokers.\nAdams on Wednesday vetoed the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act, or COPA, a measure\nderided\nby landlord groups as an unconstitutional intrusion into private deals. He also vetoed 18 other bills, including three that create new rules for city-financed housing.\nIn doing so, Adams both shot down a measure favored by the incoming mayor while also halting bills that the Mayor-elect\u2019s allies believe would hurt Zohran Mamdani\u2019s housing agenda.\nIt will be up to the next City Council and presumed Speaker Julie Menin to try to override these vetoes, though it\u2019s\nunclear\nif members will elect to do so. Most of the housing bills were passed by a supermajority of the Council, with the exception of COPA, which was approved with 30 votes. Notably, Menin was one of eight members who abstained from voting on COPA.\nIn a statement, Menin said the Council is considering its \u201cnext steps.\u201d\n\u201cRather than working collaboratively with the Council, the Adams administration has too often sidelined the legislative process,\u201d Menin said in a statement. \u201cFor years, agencies failed to provide basic data, commissioners skipped hearings, and meaningful negotiations were pushed to the last minute.\u201d\nCOPA would give city-approved nonprofits and joint ventures between nonprofits and for-profit companies the first opportunity to purchase certain multifamily buildings that are distressed or have a soon-to-expire affordability requirement. Landlord groups have said the measure will slow down sales and deter investment in the city.\nSoon after they were announced, real estate groups celebrated the vetoes. Real Estate Board of New York President Jim Whelan said the mayor\u2019s action \u201cprevented our housing supply crisis from worsening and the cost of housing from becoming even more unaffordable.\u201d Ann Korchak, of the Small Property Owners of New York, said that \u201csanity prevailed.\u201d\nMamdani, meanwhile, has\ncited\nCOPA as part of his strategy to take on bad landlords. Absent a veto override, the next Council could also work to pass another version of the bill with the new administration\u2019s support.\nThree of the other vetoed\nmeasures\nset new restrictions on the kinds of housing that the city finances, creating minimums for the percentage of units with two- and three-bedrooms, those affordable to New York\u2019s poorest and those designated as homeownership units.\nThough the administration\nvoiced concern\nabout the cost of another bill that creates a minimum wage for construction workers on certain housing projects, the mayor did not veto that measure. Under the Construction Justice Act, construction workers must be paid $40 per hour in wages and benefits on housing projects with 150 units or more that have construction costs of $3 million or more and receive $1.5 million or more in city financing.\nHousing groups warned that the measures threatened Mamdani\u2019s plan to build 200,000 new affordable housing units over the next decade.\u00a0The administration estimated that these bills would add $600 million to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development\u2019s annual budget needs. Most of that added cost, $425 million, was attributed to the Construction Justice Act.\nA spokesperson for City Hall could not provide an explanation for the mayor\u2019s decision not to veto the construction wage bill, given the administration\u2019s own calculations.\nIn a statement, Adams called the Council\u2019s legislation \u201creckless,\u201d and said that the vetoed housing measures would \u201cworsen our affordable housing crisis with new, unfunded mandates and red tape.\u201d\nAdams also vetoed a measure that would have set\nminimum wages\nfor building security guards and another that would allow the city to sell tax liens to a land bank, rather than a private trust. REBNY raised concerns about the legality of the city setting wages for these guards, which appears to be part of the impetus for the mayor\u2019s veto.\nHe additionally axed a bill that would have set\ntime limits\nfor co-op boards to respond to prospective residents about applications to live in a building and for accepting or rejecting them. This bill, as well as the land bank and security guard measures, passed the City Council with a supermajority of support.\nCOPA has percolated for several years but only gained momentum in the passed few months. It was first introduced in 2020 and has since undergone several changes that reduced the pool of eligible buildings and shrunk the period of time that nonprofits and eligible joint ventures can exclusively vie for properties.\nThe law would have required owners looking to sell certain multifamily buildings with four or more units to first notify the city and its list of approved prospective buyers.\nThose would-be buyers would then have 25 days to notify an owner that they are interested in bidding on a property. Once that time runs out, the interested qualified entities have 80 days to submit an offer. Qualified entities also have 15 days after a competing bid comes in to match it.\nThe vetoes top off what became an acrimonious relationship between the mayor and Speaker Adrienne Adams, especially over the last two years. The housing bills,\npassed\nat the City Council\u2019s final meeting this year, came after the Council unsuccessfully fought against three ballot measures approved in November. City Council leadership called the\nmeasures\n, which\u00a0 weakened the Council\u2019s sway over land use decisions, an unlawful power grab by the administration.\n\u201cThrough their actions, the Council continues to demonstrate the importance of our administration\u2019s proposals to streamline the city\u2019s housing approval process, which the Council fiercely opposed but voters overwhelmingly approved in November,\u201d the mayor said in a statement.\nIn a parting shot, Adrienne Adams said it was \u201cunsurprising that this mayor is ending his term by demonstrating, once again, that protecting and supporting working-class New Yorkers is not his priority.\u201d She said the \u201cvetoes put special interests above greater affordability and opportunity for hardworking New Yorkers.\u201d\n",

        "content": "An 114\u2011unit complex in Santa Clara, known as Montecito Apartments, has sold for $51.7 million, according to a deed recorded on Dec. 23.\nLocated at 3760 and 3765 Tamarack Lane near the border with Sunnyvale, the property was sold by an affiliate of Pacific Urban Investors, the\nSilicon Valley Business Journal reported\n. Pacific Urban had acquired it three years earlier for $50.7 million. Pacific Urban, a Palo Alto-based multifamily owner and investment manager, has been active in the market, recently selling an apartment complex in Fremont to\nBenedict Canyon Equities\nfor about $50 million. The company has other holdings in the Silicon Valley\nmarket\n.\nThe buyer is an affiliate of Las Palmas Housing and Belveron Partners. Belveron Partners is an investment firm specializing in affordable housing ownership, while Las Palmas Housing is a nonprofit public benefit corporation involved in affordable housing development and social service programs. Neither organization commented to the Business Journal.\nThe sale price equates to roughly $453,000 per unit, slightly below Santa Clara County\u2019s five\u2011year average of about $458,000 per unit for multifamily properties with more than 100 units, based on CBRE\u2019s analysis of MSCI Real Capital Analytics. Built 55 years ago, Montecito Apartments includes amenities such as a pool and fitness center.\nThe transaction fits with Las Palmas\u2019 mission of \u201cacquiring, developing, rehabilitating and supporting affordable housing,\u201d according to its website. The Encinitas-based organization has development partners that include Amcal Housing, Related Companies and Aimco Capital Development.\nEarlier in 2025\n, Las Palmas and a partner paid $52 million, or $317,000 per unit, for apartments in San Jose.\nThe organization, which has 71 affordable housing projects with more than 6,500 units, is run by President Joseph Michaels.\nSan Francisco-based Belveron Partners runs funds for investors\ninterested in multifamily\n. It has acquired nearly 30,000 units in 14 states. Since 2006, it has raised more than $1.2 billion in equity financing for affordable projects. The company\u2019s founder and managing partner is Paul Odland, who was previously CEO of Concierge Asset Management.\n\u2013 Joel Russell\n",

The new design is significantly taller and denser than earlier proposals dating back a decade, when the site operated as a Honda dealership.\nCrescent Heights, which also built the nearby NEMA apartment tower, has taken steps to meet its affordability obligations by purchasing and donating a Mission District parcel next to the 16th Street BART Station for future affordable housing. That site had previously been the focus of\nintense opposition\nto a market\u2011rate project known as the \u201cMonster in the Mission.\u201d After it switched to affordable housing, San Francisco gave $60 million to\nthe project\n.\nIf completed, 10 South Van Ness would trail only Salesforce Tower and the Transamerica Pyramid in height, though other proposed towers \u2014 including Hines\u2019 77 Beale Street redevelopment and the stalled Oceanwide Center \u2014 could eventually surpass it. Construction could begin as early as 2027.\nMiami-based Crescent Heights, led by CEO Russell Galbut, has extensive experience in market-rate multifamily development in\nLos Angeles\n,\nChicago\nand its home market. Projects vary from conversions and redevelopments to ground-up buildings.The company owns 93 properties, according to its website.\n\u2014\nJoel Russell\n",

        "content": "Salim and Kamil Chraibi have achieved great success in South Florida by building\nworkforce housing\n\u2014 that is, somewhere between \u201caffordable\u201d and \u201cluxury.\u201d\nPolicy people call this the \u201cmissing middle\u201d of the market. So much development is either high-end or income-restricted that the in-between homes are essentially missing.\nThe Chraibi brothers, as\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s\nLidia Dinkova\ndetailed in an\ninteresting profile\n, realized that if you build what\u2019s missing, it sells. Their buyers are Americans who make too much money to qualify for affordable housing but too little to get a mortgage for a luxury home.\nBuyers might also just not be inclined to buy more house than they need. These are my kind of people \u2014 practical, not\nextravagant\n, and focused on financial security rather than on keeping up with the Joneses.\nTo them, an oversized house means having rooms that you never use but still need to clean, heat and cool. An oversized lawn just means more mowing and higher property taxes.\nI recently visited relatives in Seattle \u2014 empty nesters \u2014 who had closed off half of their house rather than heat it. I also visited relatives in Los Angeles whose formal living room is sealed off like a crime scene, and filled to the brim with stuff that they will never use again.\nThe Chraibis\u2019 homes don\u2019t have redundant spaces like a living room and a family room on the same floor. But they sell faster than houses that do.\nThe profit margin on each home is lower, but the brothers make up for that with volume and quick sales. Their challenge is that south Miami-Dade, like much of America, is typically zoned for single-family homes on large lots. That inflates the cost of each lot and makes a starter home unprofitable to build.\nTo overcome this, the brothers ask localities to rezone their sites to allow more dwellings and more types of housing. For one development, instead of 30 so-called McMansions they are building 57 townhomes.\nThe risk is that the locality will cave to pressure from NIMBY neighbors and not rezone.\n\u201cYou build townhomes [nearby and] they are mad,\u201d Salim Chraibi told\nTRD\n. \u201cPeople think of workforce housing as, \u2018Oh, these people are going to come and they are going to destroy my neighborhood.\u2019 No, these are teachers, teaching your kids at school, these are people who show up at your door when you call 911.\u201d\nPlenty of home shoppers are interested in this kind of housing in New York City, which loses a lot of these folks to the suburbs. Homes for them don\u2019t get built because it\u2019s more profitable to build luxury housing in rich neighborhoods, affordable housing in poor ones, and 421a/485x housing everywhere else.\nThe market-rate units in 421a and 485x developments must have high enough rents to subsidize the affordable units required by these tax abatement programs. The result is a barbell-style rent structure \u2014 high-priced units, low-priced units and nothing in between.\nThe \u201cmissing middle\u201d is inherent in the politics-driven design of 485x, even more so than it was with predecessor 421a. Progressives required lower-rent units and construction unions demanded higher wages.\nThe gap between each end of the barbell can get even wider if rezoning is involved because it triggers Mandatory Inclusionary Housing and the local City Council member often demands even cheaper rents for the affordable units.\nOne exception was 970 Franklin Avenue in Brooklyn, which Bruce Eichner got the City Council to\nrezone\nafter a seven-year struggle. The key was unions\u2019 testimony that for the project to get financing (from their pension funds), the lower-rent units had to be workforce housing rather than deeply affordable.\nSouth Miami-Dade is very different from New York City, but both markets have a missing middle \u2014 and developers like the Chraibi brothers willing to fill it. New York state and city lawmakers must figure out why 485x, Mandatory Inclusionary Housing and current zoning are making that all but impossible.\n",

Instead Mastro orchestrated it.\nRemember when the City Council refused to confirm Mastro as corporation counsel because he was too conservative? Adams\u2019 argument was that he was competent. Guess not!\nTwo days ago Adams and Mastro publicly\nannounced\nthat Pennrose would be designated as the developer of a city project at 22 Suffolk Street. Then the press release noted that Pennrose had not actually agreed to that.\nI started covering city government in 1992. Never have I seen the city announce a deal before it was reached.\nPennrose had two days to agree to the city\u2019s offer. In exchange, the developer would have to drop its\nlawsuit\nagainst the city for designating the Elizabeth Street Garden as parkland, blocking Pennrose\u2019s project to build affordable housing for seniors there.\nI doubt I can fit all the ways that Adams and Mastro screwed this up into a column. Here\u2019s the Cliff Notes version:\nAdams was gung-ho to evict the statue garden and let Pennrose build the housing, preserving some open space for the community. His lawyers won the court case, ending a 10-year battle with statue guy Allan Reiver, his son Joseph Reiver and privileged Nolita residents who opposed the project.\nThen Adams appointed Mastro and suddenly everything changed. The city\nreversed its position\n, siding with the Reivers and against Pennrose. It was the political equivalent of Aaron Judge switching from the Yankees to the Mets in the middle of a World Series between them.\nMastro then cut a deal with the local Council member, real estate hater\nChris Marte\n, who promised to approve three future housing projects if the statue garden could stay. Mastro continues to insist that without Marte\u2019s approval, that housing cannot be built. That is false.\nIn November, voters\napproved City Charter revisions\nthat remove much of Marte\u2019s leverage to stop projects. The incoming mayor, Zohran Mamdani, should be able to get the affordable housing done without Marte\u2019s cooperation.\nWhen Mamdani won the election and promised to revive the housing plan, Adams and Mastro had to act before Mamdani shuts the City Hall doors behind them and changes the locks. Their brilliant idea was to designate the site as parkland so housing couldn\u2019t be built there.\nPennrose sued, saying the city didn\u2019t follow any process in designating the land. That\u2019s the lawsuit that Adams and Mastro wanted the developer (which was partnering on the project with RiseBoro Community Partnership and Habitat for Humanity) to drop.\nNo way were Pennrose, RiseBoro and Habitat going to do that. They\u2019ll likely win the lawsuit, and if not, Mamdani can get Albany to reverse the parkland designation.\nBesides, had they accepted Adams\u2019 offer, there\u2019s no guarantee it would have held up with Adams and Mastro out of power. And the developers would have had to start from scratch on the Suffolk Street site, wasting 10 years\u2019 of effort on Elizabeth Street.\nThe kicker in the city\u2019s press release Monday was that the statue garden, which was to receive a 10-year lease, is behind on its rent for the city-owned site. It owes $10,000.\nRewarding a deadbeat tenant is bad optics. But optics went out the window long ago on Elizabeth Street \u2014 and the Adams administration.\n",

        "content": "For months, real estate professionals have\nspeculated\nabout what Mayor Zohran Mamdani will mean for the industry.\nNow, these conversations aren\u2019t hypothetical.\nMamdani was sworn in as the new mayor of New York City during a midnight ceremony Thursday by state Attorney General Letitia James. A separate public swearing-in ceremony will be held on the steps of City Hall on Thursday afternoon. Sen. Bernie Sanders will deliver the oath of office at that event.\nTop of mind for owners of rent-stabilized housing is Mamdani\u2019s campaign promise to freeze rents for regulated tenants for four years. The city\u2019s Rent Guidelines Board decides how much landlords can increase rents on one- and two-year leases on rent-stabilized apartments, though mayors have\ninfluenced\nthe board\u2019s decisions.\nMamdani\u2019s pledge was\ncomplicated\nby Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 last-minute appointments, though one appointee decided against serving on the board.\nHe has also, however, acknowledged that a rent freeze alone cannot solve the city\u2019s housing crisis. He also wants to change the city\u2019s property tax system and work with the state to find alternative insurance options to help owners reduce costs.\nMamdani has shown support for a lawsuit challenging the city\u2019s property tax regime, and his administration could make changes that are being\npushed\nby Tax Equity Now New York, the industry-backed group that filed the lawsuit. Still, broader changes, including the designation of condos and co-ops that determines how they are assessed, would require state intervention.\nHe also wants the state to raise corporate and income taxes to help pay for his policy priorities, both of which have faced opposition from the business community.\nMamdani has also vowed to crack down on bad landlords and to revamp the city\u2019s Office to Protect Tenants, which was launched under Mayor Bill de Blasio but has\nlanguished\nover the past few years. Mamdani wants the office to identify distressed multifamily buildings with unpaid fines or unaddressed dangerous conditions and\nfind ways\nfor the city to take control of these buildings, either through foreclosing on the properties or cutting deals with the owners.\nThough many in the industry supported former Gov. Andrew Cuomo ahead of the June primary, some were heartened by Mamdani\u2019s recognition of the private sector\u2019s role in addressing the housing crisis.\nAfter Mamdani\u2019s win in November, David Kramer, president of Hudson Companies, told\nThe Real Deal\nthat when he and other affordable housing developers met with Mamdani, the mayoral hopeful assured them that he wasn\u2019t running to punish landlords.\n\u201cIn our conversations with him, he struck me as somebody that was going to be practical,\u201d Kramer said at the time.\nThe new mayor has said that he wants to build 200,000 units of new affordable housing over the next decade. Some were concerned that last-minute action by the City Council would hurt his ability to execute that plan. Specifically, housing groups worried that a package of bills that set new requirements for the kinds of housing the city finances would add hundreds of millions of dollars to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development\u2019s budget needs.\nBut in his final hours as mayor, Eric Adams vetoed those measures as well as the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act, or COPA. It\u2019s unclear whether the next City Council speaker will try to override the vetoes on these measures. Mamdani has been supportive of COPA, so he could also encourage the City Council to approve a new version of the policy instead.\nThe new administration is also tasked with implementing the housing ballot measures approved in November that create new pathways for housing projects to be approved. The changes allow certain projects to avoid City Council approval and for an appeals board to reverse the Council\u2019s rejection of others. Adams has\nleft behind\nother initiatives for Mamdani to potentially pick up, including the\nso-called Manhattan Plan\n, which recommends different ways of ramping up construction in the borough.\nMamdani is still filling out his administration, but has\nappointed\nAdams administration alum Leila Bozorg as his deputy mayor of housing and planning. He also named Ahmed Tigani, who has served as acting HPD commissioner under Adams, as his Department of Buildings commissioner. He has not yet announced who will lead HPD or the Department of City Planning.\nIn the coming months, the new mayor\u2019s policy priorities will become clearer, as will his ability to deliver on campaign promises as he navigates working with the City Council and state legislature.\n",

        "content": "One benefit of being a reporter is having access to the press offices at otherwise impenetrable government agencies.\nYou might wonder, \u201cShouldn\u2019t I as a building owner have at least as much access as the media does?\u201d In a perfect world, yes, but \u2014 reality check \u2014 you don\u2019t.\nThere is some logic to this. The press office can share information with a reporter who in turn shares it with thousands of customers, as I am about to do on a law affecting multifamily buildings.\nThe Department of Buildings has one of the most responsive press offices in city government. So when I got a curious letter from JTG Master Plumbing about new fees for gas inspections, I checked it out with DOB.\nLocal Law 152, enacted in 2016, requires an inspection of gas piping in\nmost multifamily buildings\nevery four years by a city-licensed master plumber (or a qualified person working for one).\nInspections began in 2020 and the second round is underway. Plumbers have generally charged $600 per inspection, but at least there was no DOB filing fee.\nSoon, however, there will be, the letter from JTG warned.\nBut I was skeptical of its claim that \u201cafter Feb. 22, 2026, filing fees of\nup to $480\nwill apply for extensions, corrections, and no gas filings. This will slow down scheduling &amp; increase costs for everyone.\u201d\nThen came the pitch: \u201cAvoid these new costs by completing your inspection before the rule change takes effect in February. We recommend that you complete your inspection and filing before the Dec. 31 due date to prevent fees and penalties.\u201d\nFrom the letter, I couldn\u2019t tell what the fee for my building would be and whether the deadline to avoid it is Feb. 22 or Dec. 31.\nI wrote to JPG, which replied, but I was still confused. So I emailed the DOB press office. Here are the facts:\nNew rules\nfor Local Law 152 took effect Jan. 3, 2026. Fourteen people commented at the October hearing for the proposed rules \u2014 hats off to these folks! \u2014 but DOB didn\u2019t make any changes.\nThe new fee for certification of the gas piping inspection will be $35. Requesting an extension or submitting a corrected filing will also set you back $35.\nWhat about the February deadline? There is none. DOB will start collecting fees this summer, probably after posting a service notice\nhere\n.\nAnd the $480 filing fee that JPG put in\nboldface and italics\nbut failed to explain? That\u2019s for buildings without active gas service but with gas piping that could be used in the future. Not too many of those.\nIf your property was built\nall-electric\n, congratulations \u2026 but you\u2019re not off the hook. Local Law 152 still obliges you to certify that your building has no gas piping.\nA\nstory in The Real Deal\nabout your all-electric coolness does not suffice. You still need to hire a master plumber and pay $375 for the filing fee. The good news is that you only have to do it once.\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s restrictive lending environment is finally starting to ease up.\nA look at Cook County\u2019s biggest commercial loans in 2025 shows mega-lenders moving away from their\npandemic-era reliance on the industrial sector\nand embracing a variety of property types, according to data compiled by\nThe Real Deal.\nAfter interest rates began to rise in 2022, lenders tightened their pursestrings and Chicago felt the pain acutely. While many cities saw financing slow down, Chicago also dealt with negative perceptions from lenders tied to its\nunpredictable property tax environment\nand\nprogressive city council\n.\nBut constraints on developers put pressure on Chicago\u2019s existing multifamily supply, driving rents\nup more rapidly than the rest of the country\n. As a result,\nthe multifamily market heated up this year\nand buyers and owners started to score appealing debt packages from lenders.\nMeanwhile, top-tier office developments reaped the benefits of forging ahead during the coronavirus crisis. The city\u2019s top two commercial loans of the year were both office loans that came in over $600 million and were sold off on the bond market.\nThe top contenders in 2025\ncontrast last year\u2019s biggest commercial loans\ngetting bolstered by data center developments, with the priciest debt package below $300 million. Though data center and industrial projects still secured financing in Cook County this year, the heftiest deals were part of larger portfolios that spanned the country.\nBank of America tower | $700 million\nWhile many of Chicago\u2019s office landlords were fighting for survival, the owners of the Bank of America Tower bucked trends and scored a\n$700 million refinancing\nin November.\nThe refinancing was led by JPMorgan Chase and also included debt from Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and BMO, according to a statement from the borrowers. It was then repackaged and sold off on the bond market.\nThe transaction stands out in a city where few investors have been willing to touch office paper.\nThe tower\u2019s owners are a joint venture of Oak Hill Advisors, Callahan Capital Partners and Affinius Capital. The move marks the largest office-backed bond offering in Chicago since the pandemic, a sign that commercial mortgage-backed securities buyers will still write checks for top-tier assets.\nThe 57-story building at 110 North Wacker Drive is 98 percent leased, with Bank of America anchoring 17 floors and contributing roughly a third of total rent, according to bond documents.\nIts riverfront site and proximity to Union Station and Ogilvie Transportation Center have kept it competitive, and its slate of amenities \u2014 including restaurants from celebrity chefs such as Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s \u2014 gives it the kind of hospitality edge landlords now need to draw tenants.\nThe refinancing replaces a loan held by a group of banks and landed at a moment when a small drop in interest rates started to thaw capital markets.\nSalesforce Tower | $610 million\nThe owners of Salesforce Tower on the bank of the Chicago River secured a\n$610 million long-term debt deal\nin March, marking a milestone in the aftermath of Chicago\u2019s pandemic-stricken economy.\nThe property was developed by a political powerhouse\u2019s family office in the Kennedys, as well as Hines and the AFL-CIO\u2019s real estate investment arm. It stands as a contrarian bet that worked out amid economic uncertainty.\nThe refinancing package, with Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs serving as the lenders, replaced the property\u2019s $549 million construction debt and is projected to carry an interest rate of 6.525 percent until its maturity in March 2030.\nConceived during the early days of the pandemic, Salesforce Tower has upended market trends by maintaining high occupancy levels, with leases covering over 95 percent of its 1.2 million square feet. Key tenants include Salesforce, which rents more than 477,000 square feet, and Kirkland &amp; Ellis, which is on a 677,000-square-foot lease; those deals run into the 2040s.\nKirkland has poured over $207 million beyond its tenant-improvement allowance to create its ideal workspaces, while Salesforce has put up an additional $78 million for its interior buildout, the Moody\u2019s report on the new loan showed.\n167 North Green | $247 million\nA venture of Shapack Partners, Tim Anderson\u2019s Focus Development and Neil Bluhm\u2019s Walton Street Capital secured\na $247 million refinancing\nfor the largest office building in Fulton Market, in another win for downtown office owners.\nThe venture closed in July on a five-year, interest-only loan backed by 167 North Green Street, according to a presale report from ratings agency KBRA.\nThe deal paid off a $232 million Deutsche Bank loan from 2021, giving the group breathing room until interest rates settle and the office market stabilizes. The refinancing amounts to $387 per square foot.\nThe 17-story, 638,800-square-foot building was nearly 92 percent leased at the time of the refinancing compared to 73 percent for downtown Chicago overall. It was appraised at $370 million, or $570 per square foot, this year according to KBRA.\nTenants include CCC Intelligent Solutions, which leases more than 140,000 square feet through 2037. MoLo Solutions signed for roughly 94,000 square feet through 2034 but has marketed some space for sublease. WeWork still occupies over 93,000 square feet, keeping its lease intact after filing for bankruptcy in 2023. Virginia-based consulting firm Guidehouse subleased nearly 47,000 square feet in the building from Kroll in February.\nThe Row | $212 million\nA luxury high-rise in Fulton Market developed by Related Midwest nabbed a $212 million refinancing from Mizuho Financial Group two years after opening. The refinancing signaled the strength of both the Fulton Market neighborhood and Chicago\u2019s multifamily market in general.\nRelated built The Row at 164 North Peoria Street with a $164 million construction loan issued by the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio. Additional expenses likely added to the total development cost.\nThe 43-story, 300-unit tower opened in 2023 and features a rooftop pool, coworking space and other luxury amenities. About 20 percent of the units in the building were set aside as affordable to comply with the city\u2019s affordable housing requirements.\nMarket rate rents range from $4,000 per month to upwards of $10,000 per month for penthouse-style residences.\nMarshall Field Garden Apartments | $192 million\nA historic affordable housing complex secured a $192 million refinancing deal in May, indicating its value has grown since owner Related Midwest took over in 2016.\nThe Marshall Field Garden Apartments, which consist of a sprawling complex of 10 buildings totaling 628 units, were originally built by the estate of department store magnate Marshall Fields in 1929.\nThe estate\u2019s goal was to maintain the property as affordable housing. Since then, the Old Town property has cycled through two private owners, both of which agreed to maintaining below-market rents.\nRelated Midwest bought The Marshall Field Garden Apartments in 2016 with an agreement to maintain their affordability until 2045. The company spent $175 million on upgrades to the property and most recently refinanced it with Chicago\u2019s fifth-biggest loan of 2025.\nThe Renaissance Chicago Hotel | $165 million\nThe only hotel to make Chicago\u2019s list of top commercial loans in 2025, The Renaissance Chicago Downtown received a $165 million refinancing from Citibank.\nThe riverfront hotel at 1 West Wacker Drive underwent extensive renovations in 2013.\nCarey Watermark Investors Inc. bought the 553-room hotel for $139 million and planned to pour $27 million into rehabbing it. Since then, the hospitality industry took a hit during the pandemic, hampering many investors\u2019 abilities to sell or secure financing.\nBut this year, the Democratic National Convention, and other marquee events like the Lollapalooza music festival and NASCAR race, drove record demand for downtown hotel rooms.\nThe city\u2019s overall hotel revenue generated in June, July and August totaled nearly $950 million and set a record for the central business district.\nGrand Plaza | $160 million\nMorgan Stanley originated\na $160 million loan\nfor the 481-unit apartment tower called Grand Plaza, at 540 North State Street in March. The property is owned by an LLC led by New York-based investor Teresa Tsai and several other investors.\nEven after scoring the loan, however, Tsai faced a $16 million shortfall from the property\u2019s previous debt, a $186 million mortgage taken out in 2014, property records show. It\u2019s unclear how Tsai closed the gap \u2014 she could have paid out of pocket or raised the money from another investor in exchange for a piece of the property\u2019s equity.\nRegardless, landing a CMBS deal on relatively favorable terms was a strong sign for Chicago\u2019s apartment market.\nThe new Grand Plaza loan, $93 million of which was set to be sold in a CMBS package, marked the largest deal in the offering, which totals more than $934 million across 40 loans, according to KBRA.\nGrand Plaza was appraised at $241 million during the loan underwriting process. The debt comes with a five-year term and requires only the interest to be paid until its maturity, when the principal becomes fully due, according to a KBRA analysis. The estimated property value was down nearly 20 percent from its 2014 appraisal of $300 million.\nThe Tsai venture bought the property \u2014 along with a huge parking garage and 100,000-square-foot retail assets connected to the complex \u2014 for $265 million in 2007. It then refinanced with the $186 million loan in 2014, but appeared to only use the apartment tower as collateral, allowing the retail and parking assets to operate debt-free, property records show.\nIn the first nine months of 2024, Grand Plaza brought in $19 million in revenue and $9.2 million in net cash flow, after accounting for its operating expenses, according to loan data compiled by Morningstar Credit.\n370 North Morgan | $151 million\nVista Properties scored $173 million in financing to begin construction work on an apartment tower in Fulton Market in May.\nThe funds come from\na $151 million construction loan from CIBC\nand a $22 million preferred equity investment from PGIM Real Estate. The financing equates to $350,000 per unit. Cushman &amp; Wakefield represented Vista in securing the CIBC loan.\nThe 31-story tower will include 494 units and over 45,000 square feet of amenities. It is replacing the former Fox Deluxe Foods building at 370 North Morgan Street and is expected to be completed in the Spring of 2027.\nChicago-based Skender is the general contractor, and Antunovich Associates designed the building. DeSimone is the structural engineer.\n1475 North Kingsbury Street | $135 million\nThe team behind a Lincoln Park apartment high-rise\nsecured a $135 million refinancing from Rialto Capital Advisors\nin June.\nA joint venture made up of Cleveland-based PCP Generational Partners, Chicago-based Structured Development and White Oak Realty Partners finished construction on the 327-unit development at 1475 North Kingsbury Street in late 2023. The refinancing worked out to $412,000 per unit.\nThe ownership venture took out a $89 million construction loan to fund the 27-story project in 2022. It was the last multifamily tower to be completed as a part of a broader, $250 million mixed-used development called Wendelin Park, previously known as The Shops At Big Deahl.\nThe development is bordered by Kingsbury Street to the west and Dayton Street to the east, and bound by Blackhawk Street to the north and Eastman Street to the south.\nOther buildings included in the project are The Seng, a 34-unit affordable condo development and Post Chicago, a 126-unit apartment building. At The Post, 107 units are co-living spaces, and the remaining 19 units are standard apartments. The properties surround a park that was built by the developers but is open to the public. On the east end of the development, the venture built a climbing gym known as Movement Lincoln Park.\nThe Residences at Arlington Heights | $134 million\nIn an early sign that Chicago\u2019s multifamily market was going to have\na strong showing for the year\n, the owners of The Residences at Arlington Heights secured a $134 million refinancing in February.\nLos Angeles-based JRK Property Holdings bought the massive 838-unit suburban complex formerly known as The Tanglewood Apartments in 2014 for $78 million with a $65 million loan from Walker &amp; Dunlop.\nThe Residences at Arlington have gotten more than $20 million in renovations under JRK Property\u2019s ownership.\nNot long after the refinancing, JRK listed the property for sale. At the time the listing went public in July, the complex was fully leased. Marketing materials listed an average monthly rent of about $1,500, or $2 per square foot.",

        "content": "It may be one of the country\u2019s most sprawling metros, but Houston has a surprisingly\nnarrow\nluxury market for single-family homes.\nNine of the 10 most expensive homes sold in Harris County this year are strung along the Buffalo Bayou, and five of these are within one square mile of each other in the\nRiver Oaks\nneighborhood. Contrast Travis County, home to the denser, more constricted city of\nAustin\n, where the top 10 deals fan out westward from downtown as far as Bee Cave and Horseshoe Bend, which are up to 20 miles away.\nDallas-Fort Worth\nrivals Space City in geographic grouping \u2014\u00a0 none of the top 10 homes sold this year in the Metroplex is more than a mile and a half from the Dallas North Tollway \u2014 but Houston may be home to the clubbiest luxury resi market.\nIn Houston, the buyers and sellers of the top 10 deals shared 10 agents over just five brokerages. Austin and Dallas were far more diverse, with 18 different agents apiece represented in the top 10 deals for each city.\nThe home that topped the list reflects a trend that became more pronounced in Houston this year: As the wobbliness of the resi market finally infected the luxury set, some pockets were immune, including\nhistoric homes\n. The most expensive home sold in Houston in 2025 was built in 1938 by legendary Houston architect John Staub. Of the top ten, three were built in the last two years.\nHere are the top 10 residential sales of the year in Harris County, based on TRD Data and Redfin. Since Texas is a non-disclosure state, the final sales prices aren\u2019t public; the list is sorted by last listing price.\n2110 River Oaks Boulevard, Houston | $19 million\nThis gated estate, which is one of the 31 River Oaks homes Staub designed between 1924 and 1958, sold in the hot season when it was asking $18.9 million, about $2,000 per square foot. The 9,400-square-foot main house, remodeled in 2000, shares 1.6 acres with a guest apartment and an entertainment pavilion built in 2012. The estate of Larry Brookshire, former owner of Fisk Electric, sold the property to philanthropists Martha Long and Sean Wade. Compass Real Estate agents Dee Dee Guggenheim Howes and Laura Sweeney, two of the city\u2019s top producers, represented the seller and buyer, respectively.\n2307 River Oaks Boulevard, Houston | $16 million\nDown the street is the silver medal sale,\nanother River Oaks historic mansion\n. Steel industry mogul Daniel Benditz sold the 11,200-square-foot home built in 1952 to a trust in November. The six-bedroom, 10-bathroom home was last listed for $16 million, or about $1,400 per square foot. Compass\u2019 Sweeney represented both parties in the transaction.\n3996 Inverness Drive, Houston | $14 million\nInverness Drive fielded two of the year\u2019s top sales in May\n, and Nan &amp; Co founder Nancy Almodovar represented both listings. The first was a Tudoresque mansion at 3996 Inverness, which was listed for just under $14 million, or about $843 per square foot, when it sold. The six-bedroom, nine-bathroom home built in 2011 is the largest on the list, with more than 16,600 square feet. The property had previously been listed for $17.9 million in 2024.\n1 Longfellow Lane, Houston | $10.6 million\nAn outlier among the top 10 homes\n, the five-bedroom, five-bathroom, 9,800-square-foot property at 1 Longfellow Lane is the only one south of I-69. The sellers, Kenneth and Cara Moczulski, were recognized by Preservation Houston in 2021 for restoring the home built in 1926, designed by Rice University architect and professor William Ward Watkin. Rancher and political donor Ashley Watt bought the property. The Moczulskis originally listed the home at $11.8 million in April 2023. Martha Turner Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent Victoria Minton had the listing, and Guggenheim Howes represented the buyer.\n11264 Memorial Drive, Houston | $10 million\nThis Piney Point spec mansion was built in 2024 by the seller, an entity managed by Ghandi Saad. Guggenheim Howes and fellow Compass agent Nasseim Saad shared the listing, and Guggenheim Howes also represented the buyers, Dani Bidros and Shaghayegh Nikkhah. The six-bedroom, nine-bathroom home sold on June 30 when it was listed for $10 million, which comes out to about $815 per square foot for the 12,200-square-foot property.\n813 W Friar Tuck Lane, Houston | $10 million\nLocal custom builder Rob Ryan completed this home \u2014 that required the teardown of a home built in 1950 \u2014 in July and sold it to Robert Micah McDonald in September, according to public records. The 9,000-square-foot home is on a 1.7-acre lot on Friar Tuck Lane, a Memorial neighborhood street which\nfrequently\nappears\nin coverage of Houston\u2019s most expensive homes. The asking price amounts to about $1,100 per square foot. Sweeney represented both the buyer and the seller.\n11321 Green Vale Drive, Houston | $9.8 million\nAnother spec mansion, the five-bedroom, six-bathroom home at 11321 Green Vale Drive was built by Thompson Custom Homes in 2024 and sold to Wilber and Judy Baker in February. At the time of the sale, the home was listed for $9.8 million, or about $900 per square foot for the 10,799-square-foot home.\n4004 Inverness Drive, Houston | $8.85 million\nHouston architect Charles Tapley designed the 1974 home at 4004 Inverness Drive, down the street from the third-most expensive home on the list. Jacquelyn Fisher, owner of Houston-based moving company 3 Men Movers, sold the property to Jentry Kelley and Kenneth Shawn Lynch in May. At the time of the sale, the seller asked $1,180 per square foot.\n19 West Lane, Houston | $8.5 million\nOn a 0.9-acre lot, this five-bedroom, seven-bathroom, 10,800-square-foot home, built in 2000, was listed at $8.5 million when it sold, or about $785 per square foot. Yun Bo Li sold the property to Thomas and Barbara Skeuse in March, according to public records. Compass agent Mike Mahlstedt had the listing.\n302 Timberwilde Lane, Houston | $8.25 million\nThe mid-century home at 302 Timberwilde Lane may just survive after being purchased by Kelly Barnhart, a local restaurateur with a background in art history. The house built in 1956 was marketed as a teardown opportunity, with William Wheless of Wheless Realty calling the 2.73-acre property \u201cone of the last remaining building sites\u201d on Timberwilde, a street whose other properties include the home at\n412 Timberwilde\n, listed for $12.25 million, and the\nLodge at Hunters Creek\n, a palatial estate asking $60 million. The house at 302 Timberwilde has six bedrooms, seven bathrooms and 7,400 square feet, making the asking price about $1,100 per square foot.\nNot bad for a teardown\n.\n",

The transfer tax, known as Measure ULA, didn\u2019t come into play on our ranking of the priciest hotel sales in Los Angeles County because they were all either in other cities or were bought out of foreclosure.\nHere are Los Angeles County\u2019s top five hotel sales in 2025 based on the publication\u2019s analysis of public records and prior reporting.\nThe Line\n3515 Wilshire Boulevard\nLos Angeles\nCorten Real Estate Partners\npurchased\nThe Line in Koreatown for $68 million. The 384-key hotel was developed in 2014 by an entity connected to billionaire investor Ron Burkle and his Yucaipa Companies. Yucaipa secured a $100 million\nloan\nfrom Corten but later defaulted \u2014 then the lender made the buy. The distressed deal came out to $177,000 a room. No transfer taxes were paid due to the change of title via foreclosure.\nThe Montrose\n900 Hammond Street\nWest Hollywood\nPebblebrook Hotel Trust\nsold\nthe 133-key Montrose hotel in West Hollywood for roughly $44 million. The boutique hotel, near Sunset Boulevard, traded for about $333,000 a room. The company did not disclose the buyer at the time of sale, but a person familiar said it is a high-net-worth individual who has roots in Los Angeles, believes in its future and shops bargains in distressed markets. We now know that is Daniel Negari, founder and chief executive of XYZ, according to property records. He recently purchased two Irvine Company office towers in Downtown San Diego at a discount before the giant made its\nexit\n.\nThe Surfrider\n23033 Pacific Coast Highway\nMalibu\nLuxury fashion brand Chrome Hearts, owned by Richard and Laurie Stark,\npurchased\nthe Surfrider, a 20-key Malibu hotel, for $37.5 million. At about $1.9 million a room, it was California\u2019s priciest per-key deal all year, and one of the priciest ever. The seller of the luxe, oceanfront hotel at 23033 Pacific Coast Highway was Dauntless Capital Partners.\nMaison 140 &amp; the Mosaic\n140 South Lasky Drive and 125 South Spalding Drive\nBeverly HIlls\nMalta-based Corinthia Group and Kuwait-based Action Real Estate\npurchased\ntwo Beverly Hills hotels \u2014 the 44-room Maison 140 and the 49-room Mosaic Hotel \u2014 for $35 million. That comes out to roughly $376,000 per key. The seller of the two hotels, at 140 South Lasky Drive and 125 South Spalding Drive, is connected to Sandip Chadha, of the Chadha Family Trust, per records.\nThe Hyatt House\n810 South Douglas Street\nEl Segundo\nThe Mayer Corporation\u2019s Hyatt House hotel sold after it headed to a\nforeclosure auction\n. The company developed the five-story, 200-key hotel on the University of Southern California\u2019s health sciences campus, landed a $61.5 million loan from Westbrook Partners and then defaulted. The hotel at 810 South Douglas Street in El Segundo sold for $29 million or $105,000 a room. The buyer is not immediately known.\n",

The case could shift control of 5,100 rent-stabilized apartments across 93 buildings.\nWeaver told\nthe New York Times\nthe city was looking to ensure the new owner would pursue repairs and compliance with rent-stabilization laws.\nThe firm placed the buildings into Chapter 11 protection in May, after lender Flagstar Bank\nmoved toward foreclosure\non over $600 million in debt.\nThe portfolio spans Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, making Pinnacle Group one of New York\u2019s largest landlords.\nThe mayor\u2019s office\nsaid the buildings have been the subject of more than 5,000 violations, 14,000 complaints across 83 buildings over the years, and owed money to the city.\nPinnacle has argued in court filings the properties were compromised by a combination of factors, including high leverage,\nrising interest rates\n, increased operating and repair costs, and\nlimits on rent growth\nimposed by New York\u2019s rent-stabilization laws.\nWeaver brushed off the landlord\u2019s claims, telling\nthe Times\nthat the firm has a \u201clong track record \u2026 of egregiously treating renters in their buildings\u201d before the rent laws were passed in 2019.\nThe company \u201crelied on pushing people out of their homes and rent hikes that were untenable when you consider the affordability challenges that our city has,\u201d Weaver told the outlet.\nThe move kicked off Mamdani\u2019s time in office after a campaign that promised a four-year rent freeze for rent-stabilized tenants, a crackdown on bad landlords by revamping the Office to Protect Tenants, and exploring options for the city to take control of distressed properties.\nThe city\u2019s intervention in the Pinnacle bankruptcy would aim to enforce rent-stabilization laws and ensure any buyer is held responsible for fixing long-neglected building conditions, Mamdani said. He framed the case as a test of his administration\u2019s commitment to putting tenant safety and habitability ahead of distressed landlords\u2019 financial restructuring.\nThe move came days after Summit Properties USA made a\n$451 million stalking horse offer\nto acquire the 5,100 distressed units.\nThe bankruptcy paused foreclosure actions while the properties are marketed for sale under court supervision. Any sale would have to be approved by a judge.\n\u2014Rachel Stone",

        "content": "It wouldn\u2019t be the end of 2025 without one more office distress scenario playing out in Manhattan.\nThe debt backing Brookfield\u2019s\nOne New York Plaza\nwas shipped to special servicing recently, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The goal of the maneuver is to aid Brookfield in modifying the $835 million CMBS loan backing the 2.5 million-square-foot tower at the intersection of South and Whitehall streets in the Financial District.\nIt\u2019s unclear what prompted the transfer of the loan, but time is of the essence, as it\u2019s set to mature on Jan. 9. Brookfield has never been delinquent or late to make a payment on the debt.\nWells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and BMO Harris Bank provided the loan in 2020, refinancing a $750 million debt issued by Wells Fargo four years earlier. The refinancing included three-year extension options.\nBut cash flow and occupancy both declined at the 50-story tower in recent years. The loan was underwritten with an assumed net cash flow of $84.4 million, according to Morningstar Credit Analytics\u2019 David Putro, but last year\u2019s net cash flow was only $51.2 million.\nOccupancy, meanwhile, has fallen from 100 percent in 2022 to 83 percent as of this September. Office tenants include Morgan Stanley, law firm Fried Frank, and the New York State Office of General Services, while Starbucks and Chipotle are on the retail tenant roster.\nPutro expects Brookfield to pursue an extension on the loan. For its part, Brookfield appears ready to start 2026 with a breakthrough on the CMBS debt.\n\u201cGiven the circumstances and the constructive conversations to date, we are very confident that mutually agreeable extension terms can be achieved quickly with the special servicer,\u201d a spokesperson told the Observer.\nBrookfield can lean on recent success in this realm.

        "content": "Miki Naftali walks us on white marble floors to an indoor pool at the top of an\nUpper East Side\ncondo tower. He is eager to talk about the ceiling\u2019s heights.\n\u201cI mean, look at the size of the windows here,\u201d Naftali says, pointing to large arched openings that produce unobstructed views, all desired features of the building on East 83rd Street.\nListening to Naftali on the minutia, you momentarily forget he was the guy whose most sweeping deal was buying The Plaza Hotel in 2004 for what was then a record price per room.\nNow, the short and upbeat 63-year-old in clear-framed glasses has paid about a record price per square foot for a residential development site at 800 Fifth Avenue, where he plans to demolish the current structure and put up a 26-story\nRobert A.M. Stern tower\nfor New York\u2019s blue bloods and billionaires.\nIt\u2019s a project that celebrity broker Ryan Serhant believes will be the one the \u201cworld talks about for the next 30 years.\u201d\nIf Serhant is right, Naftali will be etching his name beside the city\u2019s real estate legends, along with Gary Barnett, the Dursts, Rudins, Silversteins and Elghanayans.\nNaftali became a major player in New York real estate seemingly overnight when he bought The Plaza for $675 million while at his former employer El Ad, ruffling feathers of the city\u2019s powerful hotel union and over plans to convert hotel rooms to luxury condos.\nThat splash laid a foundation for Naftali as a dealmaker \u2013 even before final numbers for the Plaza conversion came in. After that, he struck out on his own and did small but successful projects, gaining a reputation as an uptown tastemaker. His buildings are subtle, often with limestone facades, in line with the neighborhood and their residents\u2019 disdain for glass and steel structures favored by New York condo kings. His projects have brought in $1.6 billion worth of financing this year, he said.\n\u201c\u200b\u200bThese are not projects that are done in three years.\u201d\nJonah Sonnenborn, Access Industries, on why Naftali\u2019s big swings need patient capital\nEven before 800 Fifth, Naftali had begun doing deals on the level of The Plaza, while also expanding outside Manhattan. He\u2019s bringing 950 residential units to North Brooklyn with a project called the\nWilliamsburg Wharf,\na 67-story tower to Miami and a luxury-branded condo to Fort Lauderdale.\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the next couple of years, we have about $5 billion between New York and South Florida to sell, and this is in addition to about 2,000 rental units, right?\u201d\nThe question is whether Naftali can work on this scale with the laser precision and approach to windows and ceiling heights that have made projects like 200 East 83rd Street so successful. Condo development is always risky, in sway to foreign currency fluctuations, timing and the whims of a few buyers whose complaints about finishes can halt sales.\nNaftali combats the uncertainty with diligence. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do your research, you have no chance to be successful. And even if you do your research, sometimes you can make mistakes,\u201d he said.\nS\ningles and doubles\nNaftali moved to the United States from Israel in the 1980s and studied engineering at the University of Southern California. He got a job at El Ad Properties \u2014 run by Israeli billionaire Yitzhak Tshuva \u2014 in 2000 and was surprised to be working on straightforward projects out of a nondescript office in Fort Lee, New Jersey.\nBut he picked up bigger and bigger deals until he purchased The Plaza, which overnight made him a major player.\nNaftali had wanted to strike out on his own, but the financial crisis delayed his plans to exit El Ad. In 2011, he opened the Naftali Group.\n\u201cPeople were skeptical, and rightly so,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I had to start with smaller properties and start to grow the business and get the confidence [to] tap into investors in equity funds that I didn\u2019t know before.\u201d\nNaftali\u2019s first independent deals were a handful of rental buildings in Brooklyn; condos in Gramercy Park, Chelsea and the West Village; and a slew of uptown buildings on either side of Central Park.\n\u201cI tend to shy away from the ultra-tall buildings,\u201d he said.\nHe gained a reputation for luxurious, highly amenitized buildings that catered to Manhattan\u2019s upper crust. While he\u2019s ventured downtown and put up a few glassy structures, he\u2019s mostly known for the quiet limestone look that evokes old money status.\n\u201cHe\u2019s more of the Robert Stern school of architecture: limestone facades, classic finishes, not really pushing the envelope but more timeless,\u201d Craig George of Sotheby\u2019s said.\nGeorge added that while Naftali might not have the international recognition of a developer like, say, Extell\u2019s Gary Barnett, he\u2019s definitely got clout with local buyers: \u201cNew Yorkers know his reputation.\u201d\nHe\u2019s done four buildings so far with Robert A.M. Stern\u2019s office (800 Fifth will be the fifth and, possibly one of the last that the famed architect ever worked on \u2014 Stern died last year; see page 56).\nCompass\u2019 Alexa Lambert, who\u2019s headed sales on many of Naftali\u2019s buildings, agreed with the developer\u2019s own assessment that the details matter, even if construction is longer and more expensive.\n\u201cHe bet that people will appreciate it if you do things the right way,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so far he\u2019s been both right and lucky.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no shortcuts, no noise, no ego,\u201d Serhant said. \u201cThat\u2019s the trifecta for creating greatness in the development business, it\u2019s hard to find a developer who has one of those themes, let alone all three.\u201d\nNaftali\u2019s character sets him apart from other developers. He\u2019s not brash or physically imposing. When he was working in Israel, he said he felt out of place because people were always yelling to get the attention of contractors or subcontractors.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t think that he knows everything,\u201d said Glenn Grimaldi, the former head of U.S. commercial real estate at HSBC who now works at Naftali.\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked with him on a dozen projects over 15 and 20 years,\u201d Stuart Saft, who leads Holland &amp; Knight\u2019s real estate practice group, said. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard him raise his voice, he has authority, he delegates, but he\u2019s not one of these guys when a problem arises he starts screaming at everyone.\u201d\nT\naking Fifth Avenue\nBernard Spitzer developed 800 Fifth Avenue in 1978 on a prime corner at East 61st Street, a stone\u2019s throw away from Grand Army Plaza at the southeast corner of Central Park.\nThe building never really fit the location. Built during the financial struggles of the 1970s, units have low ceilings and basic layouts; the facade never stood up to its grand limestone neighbors.\nAfter Naftali went into contract in March to buy 800 Fifth Avenue from Spitzer Enterprises and the Winter Organization for $810 million, Adam Doneger of Newmark took to LinkedIn to announce that it was the highest price per square foot for land ever. Based on square footage from Property Shark, that would put the price per square foot at about $2,275.\nNaftali acknowledged the high price.\n\u201cWe looked at 800 Fifth and we said, there is only one,\u201d he said. This is the only opportunity anyone will ever have to develop such a prime piece of land overlooking Central Park. \u201cWe think that you pay a big price for a special property. So, time will tell if we are right.\u201d\nThe opportunity is similar to what The Plaza offered in 2004. The condos there drew in buyers like Harry Macklowe, Tommy Hilfiger and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\nBut The Plaza\u2019s conversion had obstacles.\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy right now. In the next couple of years, we have about $5 billion between New York and South Florida to sell, and this is in addition to about 2,000 rental units.\u201d\nMiki Naftali\nIn February 2007, Russian hedge fund manager Andrei Vavilov went into contract to buy two of the project\u2019s condos for $53.5 million. But he sued El Ad, insisting the apartments were \u201cattic like\u201d due to small windows, low ceilings, obstructed views and ugly drainage grates \u2014 demanding his $10.7 million deposit back and $36 million in damages.\nEl Ad countersued, saying the lawsuit was full of false and defamatory statements, and that Vavilov was just trying to get out of his obligation to buy the apartments.\nThe two sides settled, and Vavilov agreed to buy the smaller of the two units for $11.2 million, which he quickly turned around and sold for a $2.8 million loss.\nA number of owners, in fact, have sold their homes for a loss or just broken even.\nHilfiger bought his two units for $25.5 million and reportedly spent another $20 million, combining them into a penthouse. He put it up for sale \u2014 at one point asking $80 million \u2014 and after 11 years sold it for $31.5 million.\nExperts have said that The Plaza\u2019s best sales happened during pre-sales before people could see their units, and resales were hurt by competition from newer buildings like One Central Park South and 432 Park Avenue.\nV\nenture to Brooklyn\nAs Naftali was selling out new condo towers uptown, he had his eyes on a site across the East River. Naftali was among the many Manhattan luxury builders over the past decade who saw potential in a 3.7-acre site in Williamsburg.\nThey saw the property as the last undeveloped land site in North Brooklyn. It was owned since the 1980s by Abraham and Isaac Rosenberg, for their lumber business. They had their own plans to redevelop the property but were stalled by infighting within the brothers\u2019 Satmar Hasidic community, where two factions, the Aronites and the Zalmanites, were bickering over the best use of the property.\nThe Rosenbergs put the property on the market in 2013. HFZ Capital and Vornado Realty Trust both looked at it, according to The Real Deal articles from the time.\nBut the Rosenbergs discovered that petroleum, pesticides, PCBs and other pollutants had contaminated the site, quashing interest. Three years after that, Isaac died in a drowning accident while swimming off the coast of North Miami Beach.\nNaftali said he became friendly with Abraham at some point that decade. In 2019, it emerged that he\u2019d persuaded Abraham Rosenberg to sell.\n\u201cIt took me about two years to get them to agree to sell it to us,\u201d Naftali previously told\nTRD\n.\nNaftali could make the deal work, unlike developers who\u2019d been scared off. He had the time and money from a big-money equity partner in Len Blavatnik\u2019s Access Industries to go through the cleanup and remediation process. Naftali paid $180 million in 2019 and $100 million in 2020 for the parcels.\n\u201cA lot of [other potential bidders on the site] couldn\u2019t figure out the complexity of a complicated seller counterparty. They also knew that given the amount of buildable square footage that it was going to be a very significant equity requirement,\u201d Jonah Sonnenborn of Access Industries said.\nAccess also wasn\u2019t worried about a complicated deal. It was the firm, along with Witkoff, which ultimately took over the unfinished XI condo project on Manhattan\u2019s High Line when HFZ Capital collapsed.\nAccess and Naftali plan to bring a\nmini-neighborhood\nto Williamsburg.\nWilliamsburg Wharf\nwill span five residential towers with 500 rental units and about 450 condos.\n\u201cIn projects that are larger and more ambitious, it requires more patient capital. It requires permanent capital. These are not projects that are done in three years,\u201d Sonnenborn said.\nCondo sales have already impressed the industry. Williamsburg is a less tested market than the Upper East Side because there are fewer comps. But Naftali is already setting records. An 89-unit condo portion of the project sold 50 percent as of April, making it the city\u2019s top-selling building, according to Marketproof.\nE\nxpansion Mode\nNaftali is not a trend follower.\nSo when his peers started building in Miami Beach and Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood in the late 2010s, Naftali stayed put in New York. He missed the wave of wealthy New Yorkers seeking new condos in South Florida during Covid.\nIn 2022, Naftali saw an opportunity in a less glamorous part of Miami. He joined with Cara Real Estate Management and paid $40.5 million for a 1-acre site in a development site dubbed The WorldCenter. The building will be Naftali\u2019s tallest, a 67-story tower with a mix of condos and rental apartments.\nIn Miami, Naftali\u2019s pitch is similar to that of other New York developers: that he can bring New York-level living to Miami.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to get the quality in South Florida and in Miami. I mean, we\u2019re sitting in a building that\u2019s not the most expensive building in New York by any stretch of imagination, but the quality here is really good quality,\u201d Naftali said, gesturing around the East 83rd Street condo\u2019s amenity floor.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to get it in New York,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more difficult to get it in South Florida.\u201d\nMiamians roll their eyes at these sorts of claims, and Naftali makes clear there are talented developers in South Florida. Still, fewer condo builders are able to meet buyer expectations, according to Naftali.\n\u201cSpeak with brokers in Miami, and I think the last couple of years, they see it more and more, there is a big difference between some of the projects, between the beautiful renderings at the beginning and the end product,\u201d he said.\nOutside of Miami, Naftali is making an even bolder bet in Fort Lauderdale. The city is seeking to change its reputation as a hub for spring breakers and boat enthusiasts, and Naftali is betting on this potential with a 45-story branded condo.\nHe has also expanded into the debt business, launching a credit arm in 2019 and hiring Grimaldi in 2022. The business focuses on mezzanine loans to other builders.\nMiki\u2019s daughter Danielle is head of marketing sales and design \u2014 she keeps him on his toes, he said. Together, the two review every offer they get.\n\u201cIf, God forbid, I don\u2019t see it for five minutes, Danielle immediately texts me and \u2014 she doesn\u2019t call me dad, she calls me Miki \u2014 \u2018Miki did you see this offer?\u2019\u201d\nT\nhe Cycle\nNaftali\u2019s buildings tend to blend admirably into their surroundings instead of standing out like the towers on Billionaire\u2019s Row or those with flashy architecture.\nAnd the same could be said about the man himself.\nYet 800 Fifth will inevitably draw comparisons to the Zeckendorf\u2019s Stern-designed \u201cLimestone Jesus\u201d at 15 Central Park West, the supertalls on 57th Street and, to some extent, Naftali\u2019s Plaza conversion.\n(Things did not go well for the last developer who sought to do large-scale condo developments uptown: Ziel Feldman\u2019s HFZ Capital collapsed during Covid, losing historic Beaux Arts buildings such as the Belnord and the Astor to foreclosure. HFZ\u2019s managing principal Nir Meir was indicted in early 2024, accused of masterminding a $86 million fraud scheme in which he allegedly siphoned money out of the project accounts. Meir has pleaded not guilty.)\nSo what gives the developer the confidence he can pull it all off? It\u2019s the small successes, built over time. The attention to detail that hasn\u2019t wavered as projects have grown more ambitious.\n\u201cWe started to build it, and now we\u2019re 14 years after that,\u201d Naftali said of what might seem like a fast rise. \u201cSo this didn\u2019t happen in a day or a month.\u201d\nNaftali also points back to The Plaza. He\u2019s already got the experience, he said.\n\u201cI did it back at El Ad.\u201d",

        "content": "Days after Zohran Mamdani won the Democratic nomination in New York City\u2019s mayoral primary election, he joined NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d to answer questions about his platform.\nHe\ntold\nthe show\u2019s host, Kristen Welker, that his primary victory over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo came down to his campaign\u2019s simple slogans \u2014 \u201cfree buses,\u201d \u201cfreeze the rents\u201d and raise taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers.\nA less publicized part of the \u201ctax the rich\u201d slogan is updating the city\u2019s\nproperty tax system\n, a notoriously complicated setup that observers of various political leanings find unfair. In campaign proposals, Mamdani said he planned to \u201cshift the tax burden from overtaxed homeowners in the outer boroughs to more expensive homes in richer and Whiter neighborhoods.\u201d (Mamdani later qualified his comment: \u201cIt\u2019s not driven by race. It\u2019s more an assessment of what neighborhoods are being overtaxed versus undertaxed.\u201d)\nThat pledge expanded the \u201ctax the rich\u201d fear to wealthy, upper-middle class and middle-class homeowners who have enjoyed relatively low rates even as the values of their properties have surged.\n\u201cReading the tea leaves, it feels like personal tax is off the table, but corporate and real estate taxes don\u2019t seem to have the same \u2018no\u2019 fervor,\u201d Compass\u2019 Jason Haber said.\nMamdani reiterated to The Real Dealhis commitment to an across-the-board overhaul the week before he took office.\n\u201cWhen the city\u2019s wealthiest homeowners pay less in property taxes than working families across the five boroughs, it\u2019s clear our property tax system is broken,\u201d Dora Pekec, his spokesperson wrote. \u201cMayor-elect Zohran Mamdani will use the full power of the mayor\u2019s office to fix this inequity and ensure that the wealthiest homeowners pay their fair share and working New Yorkers aren\u2019t left carrying the burden.\u201d\nT\nhe politics of it\nFor decades, New York City property tax reform has been a chimera. Most agree it\u2019s necessary, yet no one has managed to make it real.\nOne of the biggest obstacles is that comprehensive reform will require action at both the city and state level. There\u2019s been a lack of political will to be the administration that picks winners and losers.\nWhile the city has purview over how properties are assessed, the main governing law is a state-level statute, which means substantive changes to it would need to be approved by Albany. But in order to make reform a reality, a New York City mayor would likely need to propose and shepherd the updates through the state legislature.\nMayor Bill de Blasio may have gotten closest when he set up an advisory commission to study the issue, but by the time it released recommendations, he was already on his way out. Mayor Eric Adams campaigned on a promise to \u201cimmediately\u201d overhaul the system but took no meaningful steps forward.\nNow the buck passes to Mamdani, who has a few things on his side that his predecessors did not, indicating that his vow to tackle the issue might not be another empty promise. For one, as TRD pointed out in October, he\u2019s made taxing the rich a central part of his platform, so previous mayors\u2019 concerns about upsetting residents with deep pockets likely won\u2019t weigh as heavily on him.\n\u201cIt feels like personal tax is off the table, but corporate and real estate taxes don\u2019t seem to have the same \u2018no\u2019 fervor.\u201d\nCompass\u2019 Jason Haber\nHe\u2019s also stepping into the role after the state\u2019s highest court gave a relevant, long-running lawsuit new legs. The Court of Appeals in 2024 ruled in favor of Tax Equity Now New York\u2019s petition to revive some of its claims against the city, arguing that the current property tax system is \u201cunfair, inequitable and has a discriminatory disparate impact on certain protected classes of New York City property owners.\u201d The group brought the lawsuit against the city and state in 2017, although the appellate court agreed to drop the group\u2019s claims against the state.\nThe lawsuit argues that homeowners in outer boroughs and working class neighborhoods are on the hook for higher tax rates compared to those in the city\u2019s wealthiest areas.\nUnder New York property tax law, condos and co-ops must be assessed in relation to rental buildings, and current city practice is to tie many of those values to rent-stabilized buildings. TENNY\u2019s\ncomplaint\nalso calls for the city to begin taxing some co-ops and condos at the same rate as market-rate rental buildings, a power it argues is under the city\u2019s control.\nWith part of TENNY\u2019s case reopened, the group and the city went back to the state Supreme Court and presented oral arguments in October. They\u2019re awaiting the judge\u2019s decision, which TENNY\u2019s policy director, Martha Stark, said should be handed down by press time.\nBut Stark also said that the appellate judges\u2019 order already paved the way for the city to make changes to its assessment practices without the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion.\nFor owners of properties with rent-stabilized units, property tax reform is a welcome prospect. Mamdani\u2019s commitment to freezing rents has so far meant he is open to hearing from these landlords about how to bring down their spending, including on property taxes, so they don\u2019t go broke.\nT\nax burden\nThe prospect of an overhaul is a touchy subject for a certain cohort of New Yorkers, especially owners of co-ops and condos in buildings where sales have been pricey, making them ripe for reform.\nIn court documents, TENNY pointed to several luxury co-ops that had been assessed using rent-stabilized buildings last year, including 998 Fifth Avenue, where Est\u00e9e Lauder chairman William Lauder sold his apartment for nearly $38 million in September.\nUnder the current system\u2019s wonky math, the swanky co-op was compared to a rental building at 945 Fifth Avenue, which includes both market-rate and rent-stabilized units, and then given a lower assessment.\nBut assessing properties in line with market-rate rentals could raise some tax bills to levels unsustainable for many owners, according to Rebecca Poole, membership director for the Council of New York Cooperatives &amp; Condominiums.\n\u201cNo matter what changes are made, there will obviously be winners and losers, and some of the losers shouldn\u2019t be losers,\u201d Poole said. \u201cHopefully, [Mamdani will] see the needs of the middle class homeowners.\u201d\nOne potential tool to make sure \u201closers\u201d don\u2019t lose too badly would be for Mamdani to push for so-called circuit breakers, stop gaps that cap or slow the rise of an assessed value or tax bill if it goes above a certain level, a mechanism he\u2019s already acknowledged he\u2019s considering.\nCo-ops and condo owners also don\u2019t have the same protections as owners of one-to-three-family homes, where a cap bars the city from raising assessed values more than 6 percent each year or more than 20 percent over five years. That cap is especially important for homeowners in neighborhoods where property values have skyrocketed.\nBut the future of that cap could be in question, given Mamdani\u2019s campaign\u2019s stance on shifting the tax burden to richer, Whiter neighborhoods.\nS\nooner or later\nGiven the lawsuit, it\u2019s likely that the city could decide to change how it assesses co-ops and condos as soon as Mamdani takes office, although some say any significant shifts would likely be phased in or out, not immediately instituted. Mamdani, unlike other mayors, has expressed support for TENNY\u2019s lawsuit, signaling he\u2019s more open to going along with its findings than his predecessors. That includes changing assessment ratios, which could lower bills for homeowners in some working class neighborhoods.\nBut more substantive changes to taxation would happen later. If Mamdani does introduce a plan to, for example, change the cap on assessed values for one-to three- family homes, passage and implementation would most likely be years away.\nThat may not be much comfort to the city\u2019s 1 million homeowners. If Mamdani were to adopt the issue as one of his priorities, the back and forth over the fate of property taxes could stall sales or give buyers the upper hand in negotiations for homes likely to be affected by any changes.\n\u201cIf you want to make consumers scared of investing in New York City real estate, the worst thing you can do is play this out over a long time,\u201d appraiser Jonathan Miller said. \u201cUncertainty does no favors to the housing market.\u201d",

        "content": "The seven-story building at the Northeast corner of Walker and Church streets in Tribeca is mostly scaffolding \u2014 for now.\nBut behind the curtain of beams and blue netting, the team at 32 Walker Street has been busy. Serhant\u2019s Peter Zaitzeff has been quietly shopping five full-floor condos, one of which has already sold after asking close to $10 million.\nZaitzeff, who is heading sales at the project, said his goal is to lock in three buyers before putting up any public listings.\nThe quiet sales process is not a one-off, and is becoming something of a perk offered by the top shelf in New York new development.\nAfter some brokers in 2023\ndeclared the death of the sales gallery, the latest wave of projects came online with little to no public listings, sales offices akin to Harry Potter\u2019s elusive Platform 9 3/4 and scarce Internet presence.\nThis includes several of the city\u2019s \u201c\nIt buildings\n,\u201d like 80 Clarkson, Zeckendorf Development and Atlas Capital Group\u2019s buzzy development, and Aurora Capital Group\u2019s and William Gottlieb Real Estate\u2019s exclusive boutique at 140 Jane Street, which\nfound a buyer\nfor a penthouse asking $87.5 million.\nWhen The Real Deal reached out to Corcoran\u2019s Tara King-Brown, who is leading sales at 140 Jane along with Corcoran Sunshine, a spokesperson for the project responded, saying that \u201cin the spirit of a quiet new development sales strategy, the team will not be commenting for the story.\u201d\nAt 80 Clarkson, which has eschewed publicity down to filing piecemeal offering plans with the Attorney General\u2019s Office that only revealed a handful of units at a time, the project is well on its way to a $2 billion sellout. The project has not even recorded contracts, an even more extreme level of stealth than competitors. In December,\nTRD\nreported that the building found a buyer willing to pay $129 million for multiple units in the building, which would smash the record for priciest sale downtown.\nRepresentatives for 80 Clarkson did not respond to requests for comment.\nThey really have no need to. The city is bursting at the seams with wealthy buyers who are only getting richer yet aren\u2019t finding enough homes that meet their standards. Quiet sales have also created a hierarchy among brokers, with the select few who gain access because of the caliber of their clients signing contracts at places that the rest of the market hasn\u2019t even heard about.\nThe trend has sparked big market moves even at smaller projects. At a nondescript brick garage in the West Village, four buyers have already signed contracts for homes in what will become a seven-unit boutique condo at 125 Perry Street. One of them bought a unit asking $57.5 million, making it among the most expensive downtown condos.\nCompass\u2019 Stephen Ferrara, one of the agents marketing the building, said that as soon as the sales team started talking about the project, they had a \u201cconsiderable inbound response.\u201d\n\u201cI think people really underestimate how deep the buying pool is,\u201d he said.\nN\nothing to buy\nBefore 2020, it was not unusual to see multiple developments looking to sell more than $500 million \u2014 or in some cases, $1 billion \u2014 in condos.\nDuring those heady days, buildings had to do what they could to break through the noise: splashy spreads in the New York Times, elaborate launch parties and sales offices designed to stick out amid the crowd.\nIn 2012, Gary Barnett\u2019s first Billionaires\u2019 Row tower, One57, had a model of the building\u2019s library with a 24-foot aquarium installed in one wall in its sales office. When HFZ\nlaunched\nits twisting towers along the High Line known as XI in 2018, the project\u2019s sales office had pieces installed by the stage designer for Kanye West and Lady Gaga, including a foyer with a eucalyptus wall and screens with simulated river views.\nSix years later, the game has changed.\nThe project at 80 Clarkson is the first to attempt to do more than $2 billion in sales since the XI, now known as One High Line, and no other approved condo project this year even topped $400 million. The years of shrinking developments have pushed unsold condo units to a 10-year low, according to data shared by Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Herm\u00e8s bag that nobody else can get.\u201d\nPeter Zaitzeff on quiet luxury listings\nThe vanishing competition has given sales teams free rein to handle their processes as they see fit.\n\u201cIt put sellers in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d Zaitzeff said of the limited supply of new condos. \u201cI feel like I could sell a C-plus project right now. The lack of inventory gives us a lot more leverage to get a better price and also to sell out a lot more quickly.\u201d\nCorcoran\u2019s Nicole Hechter has sold six buildings for the development firm Grid Group, all with a typical public-facing sales rollout.\nBut for the seventh, a 22-unit boutique building called The Myles, she\u2019s instead taking appointments at the development\u2019s VIP sales gallery. (Corcoran denied The Real Deal access to the office.)\nHechter said the decision was made after seeing the success of other downtown developments and the inbound calls she received before even doing any marketing.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just such a lack of inventory in this specific segment of the market that I think we\u2019re getting a tremendous amount of outreach,\u201d she said.\nAn 18-unit boutique at 220 East 9th Street, Ferrara had over 1,000 registrations on the \u201cComing Soon\u201d website before putting up a single listing. \u201cIt caught all of us by surprise,\u201d he said.\nBrokers said that projects with units asking at least $3,000 per foot or $10 million are a typical threshold, where the buyer is already inherently limited by the price.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to a small network of buyers,\u201d Zaitzeff said. In that price bracket, \u201cit\u2019s the 5 percent of agents who do 95 percent of deals.\u201d\nBut beyond being expensive, it seems that projects need a certain something \u2014 a name-brand architect or developer, a superprime location or a truly superior product (something every marketing team says it has).\nEach project has an unreplicable selling point. At 80 Clarkson, buyers have the chance to pick up a piece of a revolutionary phenomenon: a Billionaires\u2019 Row-caliber offering, downtown. The prime units in 125 Perry Street and 140 Jane Street offer incomparable location, and the design from Leroy Street Studio have been major draws. There is only one triangle-shaped Flatiron Building.\nMass marketing can still work for projects with a wider potential pool of buyers, at a certain threshold, the exclusivity becomes another selling point.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Herm\u00e8s bag that nobody else can get,\u201d Zaitzeff said. \u201cThat\u2019s the perception that we\u2019re getting to the market with a product like this.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s not a simple plug-and-play for buildings that cater to the high end of the market.\nAt the Aman Residences at 730 Fifth Avenue, the OKO Group eschewed a public-facing sales office and launched just a handful of its original 22 units in 2017. Developer Vlad Doronin told the Wall Street Journal at the time that the restrained sales strategy spoke to the brand\u2019s exclusivity. But by 2022, the building still had 17 unsold condos, according to an update filed with the Attorney General\u2019s office.\nLuxury housing report author Donna Olshan said the strategy at the time was to market to foreign buyers with brand loyalty \u2014 but she\u2019s skeptical of the whole proposition.\n\u201cIn my over 45 years of experience, the best results are achieved by pricing the property correctly, presenting it in its best light, and immediately marketing to the entire brokerage community to generate maximum activity and create an auction effect,\u201d she writes on her website.\nD\nesperate money\nIt remains to be seen just how restrictive incoming additions to New York\u2019s new development scene can be. But the trend is likely here to stay in the city where the richest have gotten richer in the last few years.\nAfter the first half of 2025, Wall Street firms were on pace for more than $60 billion in profits, after having already seen those numbers jump 90 percent the previous year, to $50 billion. The bonus pool hit record numbers in 2025 as well, and could be on pace to do so again this year, according to a report from the state comptroller\u2019s office.\nThe money flowing through the city has been reflected in a strong luxury market, where contracts for homes asking at least $4 million rose 51 percent in November compared to a year earlier.\nDevelopers are poised with a new playbook to entice future big spenders.\nSome buildings have rolled out pricing on a handful of units, giving developers more flexibility to up the pricing of other units later if the market seems to call for it. \u201cPsychologically it\u2019s easier to push pricing if you haven\u2019t already stated what your pricing is going to be,\u201d said Stephen Kliegerman, president of Brown Harris Stevens Development Marketing.\nIn a market flush with cash buyers and tight inventory, developers can then pitch buyers on getting in early \u2014 before the rest of the market comes flooding in.\nA quiet sales process can also be a way to appeal to those buyers, Kliegerman said, setting off a win-win-win scenario for developers, brokers and buyers.\n\u201cPeople of great means love shiny new items that very few other people can afford, or avail themselves of,\u201d he said. \u201cLike-minded people like to know that they\u2019re special and they like to know that their broker or their name carries enough weight to get them access.\u201d",

        "content": "Since the pandemic, New York City affordable developer Phipps has been giving more and getting less.\nPhipps manages about 10,000 affordable housing units using a comprehensive model, meaning that it provides social services to tenants \u2014 even to those who\nhaven\u2019t paid their rent\n.\n\u201cIt\u2019s become quite a burden on us for property management and social services to try to get the help needed for our families,\u201d Cathy Pennington of Phipps said.\nDistress in New York\u2019s subsidized affordable housing has been worsening since the 2019 Housing Stability &amp; Tenant Protection Act became law and then soaring insurance payments, high utility bills and increasingly expensive maintenance added pressure from the cost side.\nBut buried in the conversation is the fact that the revenue side of the equation has also taken a hit. Tenants, it seems, just don\u2019t\npay their rent\nlike they used to.\nThose in the affordable housing space have their theories about why that is: cultural shifts, economic forces and a system that helps only the renters in the worst shape. One thing they can agree on? It\u2019s not clear that collections will ever naturally recover.\n\u201cAs a lender, we\u2019re treating this as the new normal,\u201d said said Robert Riggs, from Community Preservation Corporation, a nonprofit lender.\nThe drop in collections and squeezing of revenue might on its own be brutal to New York\u2019s affordable housing. But combined with sharply rising expenses, the prognosis may be fatal.\nS\ntaying put\nAt Enterprise Community Partners, a nonprofit lender, the average rent collection in its New York affordable projects was once 95 percent. Now, it\u2019s\ncloser to 90\n.\nThe number of projects experiencing more concerning collection rates has also more than tripled. In 2017, just 3 percent of projects had collection rates below 80 percent. Now that figure is 11 percent.\nA shift from 95 to 90 percent may not seem big. But it can mean a loss of about $6,000 per month or $75,000 per year, according to Enterprise. That\u2019s as much as the annual insurance payment on three or four units.\n\u201cThat really does represent a lot of lost income to the properties,\u201d Patrick Boyle of Enterprise said.\nDuring the pandemic, market-rate units had increasing vacancies and lower rents, since tenants moved out of the city and supply overtook demand. But those living in regulated housing were both more likely to see their jobs cut and less likely to move away. They stayed where they were, and those who couldn\u2019t pay just \u2026 didn\u2019t.\nAnother nonprofit lender, Community Preservation Corporation, had collections at projects in its portfolio dip close to 70 percent during that time. Before the pandemic, the lender would underwrite all its projects to 95 percent collections, and it expected an even higher rate.\n\u201cThey kind of have to roll their dice out to the edge. Which is awful, right? But they won\u2019t help you unless you\u2019re in that position.\u201d\nJohn Crotty, founding member at Workforce Housing Group\n\u201cBefore the pandemic, it was just a truism in the industry that people with below-market rents paid their rent,\u201d Riggs said.\nSince then, CPC has had to revise its strategy.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t underwrite to 95 percent collections anymore,\u201d Riggs said. \u201cThere\u2019s no track record of that happening in the last 5 years.\u201d\nThe collections numbers still hover at about 92 percent.\nAffordable housing in New York is developed by both nonprofit and for-profit operators, who agree to certain conditions to access city and state funding and financing. One is pegging maximum rent increases to levels set by the city\u2019s Rent Guidelines Board. A freeze on those increases, the marquee campaign promise of mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, would stymie revenue even further.\nIt\u2019s not totally clear to what extent the trend in New York\u2019s affordable housing mirrors collection declines in the market-rate and national housing markets. Data is difficult to come by, especially pre-pandemic data. The American Apartment Owners Association says that traffic to its collections agency has stabilized since the pandemic, and the National Multifamily Housing Council has stopped monitoring national rent collections.\nThose who study these numbers say that they believe national collections in market-rate housing are just slightly below where they were pre-pandemic, but that\u2019s based more on educated hunches than on hard numbers.\n\u201cEverything within our data suggests that even when renters do fall behind, they show a high priority to catch back up,\u201d Jonathan O\u2019Kane of Chandan Economics, which monitors rental performance, said.\nBoyle, at Enterprise, said that he believes the issue is most acute in the affordable space, but not just in the city. About one-quarter of the projects in the nonprofit\u2019s data are outside the five boroughs.\nO\nut on the edge\nAmong borrowers in CPC\u2019s portfolio, collections are uneven across properties, Riggs said. But the lender has so far failed to find a pattern. Did the pandemic and the eviction moratorium change how tenants think about and prioritize rent? Are tenants who don\u2019t pay making their neighbors wonder why they don\u2019t do the same?\n\u201cSometimes we see an owner with similar buildings and the same management company in the same neighborhood and they have completely different collections,\u201d Riggs said.\nBut at the base of the issue, some in the affordable space say, is a tight financial reality.\n\u201cIf you have no money and there\u2019s three choices you have, and one of them is food, then there\u2019s the other two,\u201d John Crotty, a founding member at Workforce Housing Group and former city official, said. \u201cPeople are broke, they\u2019re hurting.\u201d\nThose in lower-cost housing are more likely to find themselves in a pinch.\n\u201cEveryone is concerned with affordability,\u201d Oksana Mironova, a housing policy analyst at the Community Service Society, said. \u201cLower-income people are the ones who are always hit.\u201d\nAt the same time, some city policies incentivize tenants to fall deeper into arrears. Housing court takes months, keeping renters in units they can\u2019t pay for without help.\nSometimes it takes being nearly evicted for a tenant to qualify for city resources.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to prevent eviction, but unfortunately, after a period of time and as the arrears grow, we do have to turn to the courts to help us,\u201d Pennington of Phipps said. \u201cAnd sometimes in court, they finally get the help they need.\u201d\nFor example, the city\u2019s \u201cone shot\u201d deal helps the neediest New Yorkers get out of arrears with a lump sum payment. But prioritizing only those in severe distress, some say, makes renters go through greater deprivation in the hopes of getting help.\n\u201cThey kind of have to roll their dice out to the edge,\u201d Crotty said. \u201cWhich is awful, right? But they won\u2019t help you unless you\u2019re in that position.\u201d\nOther rental assistance programs, such as the CityFHEPS voucher program, can end quickly, leaving a tenant in a unit they can\u2019t afford, Pennington said.\nThe highest levels of rent nonpayment are likely in metropolitan areas where rents have risen steeply since the pandemic and salaries have not kept up, according to Alexandra Alvarado of the American Apartment Owners Association. The median rent for a new lease in Manhattan has risen 13 percent in the past year, according to a December report from Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel.\n\u201cThe majority of people are just struggling financially,\u201d Alvarado said of those who aren\u2019t paying nationally. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s necessarily a choice.\u201d\nP\nush and pull\nThose in the affordable and nonprofit space are keen to discuss carrots, not sticks. They focus on easing access to city resources.\nThe New York Housing Conference, which advocates for affordable housing, has proposed a separate housing court specifically for those in subsidized units. Staff there could assist with accessing city one-shot deals and other rental assistance programs. This could, at least in theory, save the city money by helping tenants when they have less in arrears.\n\u201cThe tenant gets so far in the hole in accumulated arrears that they can\u2019t dig their way out,\u201d Rachel Fee, the group\u2019s executive director, said.\nBut speeding up housing court could also ease evictions.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s some hope \u2014 and this is terrible to say \u2014 that as evictions start to happen at a faster rate, that behavior will change,\u201d said Riggs.\nBut in the meantime, they say, something has to give. Piling on expenses without more revenue is pushing affordable housing toward a cliff.\n\u201cThe lack of cash coming in from failure to pay rent, and the court system not changing that in any timely fashion, indeed making it longer, is fatal,\u201d Crotty said via email. \u201cBuilding owners can\u2019t withstand it.",

        "content": "Sales slow, costs mount and investors grumble and place blame on e-commerce, tariffs or a pandemic:\nAnother\nretail\nchain\nis filing for bankruptcy. While creditors cross their fingers and lawyers go to court, landlords brace for missed payments.\nThis is when Ivan Friedman\u2019s phone rings.\n\u201cIn my business, bad is good,\u201d he said.\nOn the line, often, are the private equity firms and ownership groups who want to swoop in and buy low. To rescue a bankrupt chain, the companies need someone to renegotiate rents on hundreds of stores. It\u2019s unpleasant but critical grunt work, and many believe Friedman does it best.\nPlenty of mall mainstays have hit bottom during the four decades of his career. Friedman\u2019s company, Manhattan-based RCS Real Estate Advisors, was the go-between for retailers and their landlords for many of them. Friedman\u2019s arrangements can enable their survival. When\nClaire\u2019s\n, facing a $496 million loan it couldn\u2019t afford, filed for Chapter 11 last summer, the buyer turned to Friedman to\nfix its leases\nbefore closing on the sale. During Simon Property Group and Brookfield Corporation\u2019s purchase of Express out of bankruptcy in 2024, RCS saved the brand nearly $100 million on real estate obligations, court records show.\nEven those that have stayed out of bankruptcy, like Vans, Gap, Cole Hahn and Hollister, have used RCS\u2019 services to pay less for spaces or strategize expansions.\nThe typical story played out one Friday night a few years ago. Friedman was en route to his beach house when a call came in from an unfamiliar number. It was the head of a private equity firm that had recently purchased a national retailer out of bankruptcy.\n\u201cWe got a problem,\u201d the executive said.\nThe retailer and one of its landlords, a major shopping mall owner, could not agree on a reduced rent, putting nearly 300 of its more than 1,200 stores, and their revenue, at risk. As the court deadline approached and negotiations failed to advance, the executive started to sweat.\nFriedman worked out the numbers. If he could reduce the rent on that group of stores to 40 percent of the original, would the firm take that deal?\nAbsolutely, the executive said.\nAt the house, Friedman called the landlord. Only a handful of owners own most of the country\u2019s\nmalls\n, so a call from Friedman doesn\u2019t just mean they\u2019re about to accept less money at one location but that they may have to reduce the rent across several properties. In this case, if the landlord agreed, Friedman told him, the firm would accept all of the leases by the next day. \u201cTake it or leave it,\u201d Friedman said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s like the guys who play the Bond villain, and he plays the Bond villain better than anybody,\u201d another major mall landlord who sits opposite Friedman in negotiations like this told\nThe Real Deal.\n\u201cNot a lot of people want to do this job because they want to be liked.\u201d\n\u201cI holler a lot and tell them what they\u2019re going to be doing, and sometimes I get away with it.\u201d\nIvan Friedman\nThe next morning, the landlord called Friedman to accept the terms. The good news and the speed of its delivery stunned the private equity executive.\nFor the last two decades, about half of Friedman\u2019s career, the phones have been ringing in a world where the realities of retail are rapidly changing. The last few years have been particularly jarring. Foot traffic has dwindled at mid- and lower-tier malls, with 10 and 18-percent drops, respectively, compared to 2019, according to Placer.ai, which tracks consumer movement. Even one-time high-performing malls have fallen on hard times, landing in\nforeclosure\nand wiping out bondholders.\nThe king of the discounted mall lease isn\u2019t worried.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of years, and a lot of experience,\u201d he said. \u201cYou either get old and you benefit from the years, or you get old and die. And I ain\u2019t dying.\u201d\nH\nolding the line\nFriedman follows the retail industry like a sports team, so Claire\u2019s demise was no surprise. \u201cClaire\u2019s had been a mess for 10 years,\u201d he said. As Maryland-based private equity firm Ames Watson began circling the 64-year-old retailer, Friedman expected a call from co-founder Lawrence Berger, whom he\u2019s known for 15 years. Ames Watson\u2019s purchase would require saving several million dollars per year on rent across the U.S. portfolio.\nFriedman determined Ames Watson needed to keep at least 675 of Claire\u2019s roughly 1,300 U.S. locations for the deal to pencil. Then, Friedman swung into action. \u201cOnce we lock up a deal, Ivan has to go perform,\u201d Berger said.\nOver the next six weeks, Friedman and his team of 17 examined each individual Claire\u2019s lease, dialed the landlords and haggled.\nFriedman doesn\u2019t hire accomplished, successful negotiators. \u201cThey don\u2019t exist,\u201d he said. Instead, he brings on employees he can tell are \u201canxious for success, for money, to learn, and to become established.\u201d Negotiation is something you teach, Friedman said, often through fire.\n\u201cYou give someone 20 landlords and see how long it takes them to cry,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cAnd when they come back, because they were made to cry, they start asking the right questions. They start understanding that all landlords have the same stories of why what you\u2019re asking is too expensive and why they can\u2019t do it.\u201d\nFor the leases held by REITs such as Simon Property Group, Brookfield and Macerich, Friedman makes personal calls to top executives.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of \u2018Hey guy, here are the numbers, here is what I\u2019m going to need, and this is why I\u2019m going to need it, you\u2019re in or you\u2019re out,\u2019\u201d Friedman said. \u201cI holler a lot and tell them what they\u2019re going to be doing, and sometimes I get away with it.\u201d\nFriedman is adamant that the keys to his success are relatively banal: age, experience and relationships. Yet, he and his team have crafted creative ways to convince landlords to lower rents.\nSince Covid, percentage agreements, in which the landlord agrees to accept a lower base rent in exchange for a percentage of the store\u2019s sales revenue, have become more popular in shopping mall leases. The breakpoint percentage clause outlines the shape of this agreement, and sets the revenue threshold a store must reach before cutting the landlord in. For a retailer that spends $120,000 on annual rent, the landlord might set a breakpoint rate of 5 percent. This means that after $2.4 million in sales ($120,000 divided by 0.05), the landlord begins earning 5 percent of the store\u2019s revenue.\n\u201cI throw that out,\u201d Friedman said.\nIn that example, Friedman would instead aim to get the gross rent down to about 12 percent of total sales and then cut the landlord in on 12 percent of the sales revenue growth moving forward. These post-bankruptcy leases are often short-term, aimed at giving the retailer a chance to reset and begin growing the business again.\n\u201cI\u2019m selling them on the idea of keeping a long-term business that has value,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they want 18 to 20 percent of sales for rent, I can\u2019t grow. I\u2019m dead.\u201d\nMany in the industry respect his touch and gamesmanship. Still, Friedman knows his reputation: People have called him an animal, the enemy and the devil.\n\u201cBut that\u2019s probably because they lost the last transaction,\u201d the mall exec countered. In their small world, you\u2019re likely to\u00a0 encounter Friedman more than once, which helps the sides stay civil.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any landlord gets excited to hear from Ivan, but the reality is that it has to be done and he\u2019s a pretty rational person,\u201d Berger said.\nThis playbook worked for Claire\u2019s. When Ames Watson closed on its purchase in October, Friedman and RCS had successfully renegotiated more than 900 leases at heavy discounts.\nB\norn this way\nFriedman, now 84, is the child of Russian immigrants who came to Brooklyn in the early 20th century. The family lived above his father\u2019s shop, a women\u2019s clothing store in East New York, where Friedman began sweeping floors at age 5.\nAbout 1960, Friedman, not yet 20, opened his own ladies\u2019 clothing shop. An Army reservist, Friedman was briefly pulled back into active duty during the Cuban missile crisis. When he returned to New York, he expanded his business to \u201cfive or six stores,\u201d he said. Then, picking up the pace, he bought a department store chain with 150 locations in the late 1970s.\n\u201cHaving grown up in retail, there was nothing else for me to do besides the natural progression of opening up my own stores,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cImmigrant families are very much always focused on one thing, and don\u2019t always have the breadth of opening up to other possibilities.\u201d\nYet, he increasingly found the business exhausting, and as the 1980s approached, Friedman began looking for a way out.\u00a0 He found it in real estate.\nFriedman discovered he could make more money from selling off his brick-and-mortar leases than what the stores would earn over the next decade. \u201cThat business was worth more dead than alive,\u201d he said.\nFriedman didn\u2019t yet have a plan for his next chapter when General Electric Capital called later that year. An executive asked him to go down to Oklahoma on a semi-clandestine mission to gather information on the CEO of a retailer the company had invested in. Using his retail expertise, Friedman would operate as a \u201creal estate consultant,\u201d on behalf of General Electric.\n\u201cThen they said, \u2018While you\u2019re down there, maybe you can call some landlords and see if you could get some rent relief or something,\u2019\u201d Friedman said. \u201cI said, hmm, that could be a business. And it was.\u201d\nWord got around that Friedman was a worthy advisor, and he soon started hearing from more retail executives with real estate problems. He then founded RCS Real Estate Advisors.\n\u201cIvan and RCS have the power to say, \u2018We\u2019ll rip the lease up if you don\u2019t renegotiate.\u2019 And now we have the power to say, \u2018I\u2019ll take the space back,\u2019 especially in a market like this.\u201d\nanonymous mall executive\nUpon reflection, Friedman doesn\u2019t see too many other ways it all could have gone. He avoids grand conclusions about life or work. \u201cBusiness is business, life is life\u201d is a common Friedman-ism.\nIn life, he said he mostly avoids malls, except \u201cwhen my wife asks me to shop.\u201d\nBut business was the order of the day on a recent Thursday afternoon as he arrived at the entrance of Simon Property Group\u2019s Jersey Gardens Outlet Mall in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Friedman stepped out from the backseat of a black Lincoln Town Car and adjusted his Paul Stuart overcoat as he scanned the property. It\u2019s the state\u2019s largest indoor outlet mall, and Friedman\u2019s fingerprints are all over it. Of the 200 brands here, he\u2019s negotiated for 26 of them.\nFrom his coat pocket he took out a schematic of the mall\u2019s retail spaces, printed on two sheets of paper stapled together. Red lines mark the spaces of the retailers he has represented.\n\u201cYou judge a mall by how much business it does per square foot,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cShitty malls do $200 to 300 per [square foot].\u201d\nThis one does $930, roughly $1.2 billion per year, making it \u201cone of the better-performing malls, especially for an outlet,\u201d he said.\nInside, Friedman could barely walk 20 feet without pointing out former or current clients, Gap and Old Navy, Brooks Brothers, Ann Taylor Loft, True Religion and Vans. Eventually, he made it to Claire\u2019s.\n\u201cMy Claire\u2019s,\u201d he said.\nFriedman hesitates to talk specifics about his partners, deals, nemeses or numbers. But standing among his stores, he opened up, the storefronts surfacing war stories from the negotiation room. Friedman described Covid as \u201ca godsend\u201d for his company. His phone barely stopped ringing with brands desperate to renegotiate their leases. Yet, few contracts had contingencies for global pandemics, which meant many retailers found themselves stuck in closed malls.\n\u201cI called up David Simon and said, \u2018Don\u2019t give me this force majeure stuff,\u2019\u201d he recalled.\nInstead of going to court, he suggested an informal plan: \u201cFor the companies that aren\u2019t in trouble, how about we pay a month of rent, and then you pay a month. We share the pain.\u201d\nSimon eventually agreed.\nTouring the mall, Friedman seemed to sense that at least some of the brands he hadn\u2019t worked with yet would eventually call.\n\u201cThere will always be a supply of weaker companies,\u201d Friedman said \u2014 future customers.\nU\npper hand?\nMarket conditions used to give Friedman the clear advantage in lease negotiations. From the 1980s into the early 2000s, malls boomed, and landlords had to compete to retain tenants. Friedman could more easily predict the answer to the question: \u201cHey, do you want some rent or no rent?\u201d\nBut these are different times, as malls continue to close while demand for retail space climbs.\n\u201cThis has been described as probably the best two-year period of retail demand in the last decade,\u201d Vince Tibone, head of industrial and mall research at financial services firm Green Street, said. However, in this inverse reality where landlords have the power, quality is key.\nIn Class A malls \u2014 those that make more than $630 per square foot in revenue \u2014 occupancy has hovered near 95 percent in recent years. A November Green Street report showed Tanger\u2019s third-quarter occupancy rate at 98 percent; Simon Property Group\u2019s 96 percent occupancy is within a percentage point of its all-time high. For these landlords, a vacancy might be a chance to bring in a growing chain, like an Alo, Sephora or Everlane.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the circle of life,\u201d the mall exec said. \u201cIvan and RCS have the power to say, \u2018We\u2019ll rip the lease up if you don\u2019t renegotiate.\u2019 And now we have the power to say, \u2018I\u2019ll take the space back,\u2019 especially in a market like this.\u201d\n\u201cWe can say, \u2018Okay, give me my five best stores back, you can keep the five worst, and we make deals,\u2019\u201d the exec added. \u201cIf you want to give me 100,000 square feet back of Claire\u2019s, I can absorb that without being killed now, especially when I know I can re-lease it for higher.\u201d\nThe landlord said Friedman has an advantage over the mid- and lower-tier mom-and-pop mall owners who can\u2019t risk the expense of a vacancy. Between 2017 and 2022, an average of 40 malls per year shut down, and experts believe that trend is likely to continue among the weaker malls in the U.S.\nYet demand at the high end can mask underlying weakness. In October, a distressed debt fund\nseized\ncontrol of The Palisades Center in West Nyack, one of the largest malls in the country, leaving CMBS bondholders with a $231 million loss. It was only the second time AAA CMBS bondholders suffered losses since the financial crisis, Bloomberg reported. Meanwhile, the 1.5 million-square-foot San Francisco Centre, another Class A mall, is over 90 percent vacant, and AAA CMBS bondholders could also take losses on at least four other deals, according to a Barclays\u2019 report.\nRetail\u2019s been declared dead before, but Friedman believes that the industry will outlast turbulence as it always has, from department store consolidation in the 1990s, the Great Recession of 2008, the so-called retail apocalypse brought on by e-commerce in the mid 2010s and the 2020 pandemic.\nPeople, on the other hand, don\u2019t last forever. Friedman counts himself among a respected group of peers still working. He half jokingly compares himself to Mick Jagger and admires Vornado CEO Steven Roth, also 84. \u201cHe comes to work every single day.\u201d (He disagrees with Roth\u2019s decision to let his hair go gray. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in that.\u201d) Although he has a succession plan in place, Friedman has no plan to step away.\n\u201cIf I could move a coffin into my office so that I could die at my desk and they just wheel it over and drop me in, that would be fine,\u201d Friedman said.",

        "content": "Nick P\u00e9rez has a clear view of South Florida\u2019s condo market, especially the ultra-high-end segment. From September to early December of 2025, his family\u2019s Related Group sold $450 million worth of condos, with more to come. Between October 2025 and this coming March, Related and its partners are completing condo projects totaling 1,500 units, including the Crosby at Miami Worldcenter and Nomad Residences Wynwood.\nP\u00e9rez is president of the condo division at Related, where he and his brother, CEO\nJon Paul P\u00e9rez\n, have been taking on more leadership, though the Miami-based firm is still led by Nick\u2019s father, billionaire developer Jorge P\u00e9rez.\n\u201cThe strength is definitely in the ultra-luxury product,\u201d Nick P\u00e9rez said in an interview with\nThe Real Deal\n.\nWith partners, the firm is under construction at\nSix Fisher Island\nResidences, where buyers are paying an average price per foot of $4,000, high for preconstruction.\nBut he\u2019s also noticed that at cheaper, short-term-rental-friendly projects, developers are all fighting for the same buyer.\n\u201cTake a step down into the more affordable range, or once you\u2019re down in the range of $1,000 to $1,400 per square foot, that market is very saturated,\u201d P\u00e9rez said. That range includes Viceroy Residences, where\nTRD\nconducted this interview.\nSome developers are overleveraged and may fail, P\u00e9rez observed. But Related is pushing ahead with projects from Miami to West Palm Beach to Tampa, and holding onto a handful of sites with big plans, including one rumored to be a Ritz-Carlton-branded high-rise development in North Bay Village with Harry Macklowe\u2019s firm.\nIt\u2019s not 2008, when Related had to hand the keys over to its lenders on four condo projects.\nThe summer was slow, but an autumn boom emerged, thanks mostly to sales at three luxury waterfront condo projects: $70 million presold at Rivage Bal Harbour, which Related is co-developing with Two Roads Development; $80 million at the Ritz-Carlton Residences, West Palm Beach (with BH Group); and $100 million presold at the St. Regis Residences Miami, with partner Integra Investments.\nBaccarat Residences, a 75-story, 355-unit tower that\u2019s under construction in Miami\u2019s Brickell in the same complex as Viceroy, has fewer than 10 units left, P\u00e9rez said, though sales launched in 2021.\nHere\u2019s what else Nick had to say about the market and the firm\u2019s pipeline.\nThe interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\nTell me about 2025.\nIt was kind of a roller-coaster year. We had a new U.S. president, which the industry was super excited about. There was certainty on where we were going. Then Liberation Day came and the stock market took a tank. That caused a ton of\nuncertainty\n, not only in the real estate market, but in investment decisions across private equity, across data, every industry. Because uncertainty kills all investments. You don\u2019t know how to invest without knowing you know what your cost of goods is going to be. Are you going to hire? Are you going to fire? This summer was not a great summer, but come Sept. 1 there was some calm in the market. Interest rates have gone down, which has helped but still not enough.\nThere\u2019s still a lot of money on the sidelines waiting for further rate cuts.\nIs the Mamdani effect [of New Yorkers migrating to Southern Florida] overhyped?\nThis happens every time. Trump gets elected, some people think the world\u2019s going to end. Or Biden got elected, people think the world\u2019s going to end. Or when Mamdani got elected, New York\u2019s \u201cgone forever.\u201d Developers are talking with Mamdani. There\u2019s always a little bit of\noverhype\nbecause of, again, the uncertainty.\nYes, there\u2019s been more interest, more calls, more web leads, more form fills. But it hasn\u2019t been the rush that everyone has [predicted].\nThere is so much competition in lower price points. How do you stand out?\nBetween Miami-Dade and Broward, 144 projects have been announced. The vast majority are [like the Viceroy Residences]. But they don\u2019t have this location that we have [riverfront in Brickell], but it\u2019s that type of unit, size and price point.\nMiami has become extremely expensive. We\u2019re selling Icon Beach right now at $1,200, $1,300 [per square] foot in Hollywood. Six years ago, we sold out Hyde Beach House at $670 a foot. Prices have grown astronomically. Wages have not followed, and especially South American wages; and the dollar is strong. So, the purchasing power of South Americans has not kept up with the price appreciation that\u2019s happened in the market.\nAre you holding back on launching projects?\nWe are preparing, going through the design process, and getting all of our marketing material ready on a lot of jobs. Our Aventura multifamily site, we\u2019re going through the design process to get all the materials ready.\nNorth Bay Village\n, we cleared the site, we are going through the design process and getting through the marketing materials. That takes eight to 10 months.\nBird Road, which we bought with 13th Floor Investments, is another one, we think with product type, location, price entry point, young families. That one we\u2019re branding in a unique way, which we\u2019ll get to later next year. But that is going to have an entry point, about $1,200, $1,300 a [square] foot. It\u2019s right by the metro, in between Coconut Grove and Coral Gables.\nWe are getting all those ready \u2014 and watching the market.\nAre you expecting a price correction?\nPrice increases will be difficult. I don\u2019t think there will be a decrease. Immigration is starting to take effect on some labor issues. We haven\u2019t seen it but we\u2019re hearing labor is hard to come by. Construction costs, we haven\u2019t seen them spike a lot but it\u2019s starting to trickle in as we\u2019re pricing new jobs. There\u2019s no way someone can build cheaper in two years than they can today. The only thing that can adjust is owners\u2019 expectations of the value of the land. That\u2019s really hard to change also. You will see some people get in trouble for overpaying and realize how expensive it is to build.\nAre you offering incentives to sell condos?\nYes, they\u2019re definitely in the market. A lot of those are not very wide blasted. Once word gets out, then everyone else starts doing it.\nAre you looking at picking up stalled project sites?\nNot actively. We have enough. Maybe those buyers, if their projects don\u2019t come through, they come to our projects.\nI won\u2019t tell you where but we gobbled up a bunch of units in a condo to create a blocking position in case someone comes in. We\u2019re planting seeds for the next big run.\nNewly elected Miami Mayor Eileen Higgins campaigned on increasing affordable housing, restoring trust to City Hall and improving permitting issues. What policies or incentives would help create more affordable housing?\nAffordability is the biggest issue. People are spending over 50 percent of their income on rent, when the norm used to be 30 percent. It\u2019s not going to change overnight, but that has to change. We have the right mayor that was elected by the city of Miami to try.\nMayor Higgins was instrumental within the county in promoting affordable housing. She was probably one of our biggest cheerleaders. The county has massive amounts of land, so they\u2019re able to do affordable housing by executing 99-year ground leases to the developer. The city of Miami doesn\u2019t have that much land, so I don\u2019t know exactly what she\u2019s going to try to do.",

        "content": "I\nn California, there\u2019s Irvine Company, owned by the country\u2019s richest developer, and there\u2019s everyone else.\nBut calling FivePoint Holdings an also-ran doesn\u2019t convey the importance of what the land developer has done \u2014 or could do \u2014 in the state. The coastal California master-planned communities developer, connected to deep-pocketed Lennar, has delivered thousands of homes in a state that is underbuilt by millions, and managed to turn a profit.\nNew megadevelopments are rare in sought-after parts of the Golden State, but the company has three: one in Orange County, one in Los Angeles County and a third in San Francisco, with 12,500 homesites completed so far. All together, they plan to deliver 40,000 homes and 23 million square feet of commercial space. FivePoint began to develop the first two, Great Park Neighborhoods and Valencia, under singularly difficult conditions, including lender bankruptcies, municipal bait-and-switches, community resistance and \u2014 this being California \u2014 battles over native fish and carbon emissions.\nNonetheless, the developer has recently sold sites at Great Park, the Orange County community, for about\n$10 million an acre\n, much more than their pre-2020 price.\nBut if Great Park and Valencia, the L.A. community, seemed feasible only to the kind of developer who could pull off the hardest stuff, the difficulty of developing FivePoint\u2019s San Francisco project, called Candlestick and The San Francisco Shipyard, veered toward impossible.\nIn 1999, San Francisco named Lennar the master developer of the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, which the Navy had used to decontaminate ships after nuclear tests. A decade earlier, the Environmental Protection Agency declared the area a Superfund site, and the Navy hired a firm called Tetra Tech to investigate, test and remediate much of the land in advance of handing it over to the developer. In the meantime, two things happened: In 2006, Lennar won development rights to the nearby Candlestick, once home to the San Francisco 49ers and Giants, and in 2009, Lennar spun out FivePoint to make the latter a focused land developer (or perhaps to satisfy a promising executive who may have wanted his own domain). Little went as planned. In 2014, it came out that Tetra Tech employees had falsified soil samples, swapping in clean dirt for contaminated in tests. Criminal and civil lawsuits dogged the remediator, and the development site, for years. Several, including one with FivePoint, are still winding their way through the courts. Two Tetra Tech employees were sentenced to federal prison in 2018 after pleading guilty.\nThe saga seemed to change FivePoint, which in 2022 installed a tight-lipped, Irvine Company-trained operator named Daniel Hedigan in place of its original chief executive, Emile Haddad, known industry-wide as a creative visionary not overly concerned with stock prices. The macro environment was changing too. Interest rates shot up, making financing more difficult, even as California\u2019s politicians finally came around to the idea that the state had to build more places to live. Per a state requirement, San Francisco is supposed to add 82,000 new homes by 2031. Together, FivePoint\u2019s Candlestick and Shipyard \u2014 neighboring peninsulas jutting out into the San Francisco Bay \u2014 could deliver 12,000, or 15 percent.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s there to do? Nothing really.\u201d\na Shipyard resident, where about 450 of a planned 12,000 homes have been built\nIn late 2024 came a sign that development could proceed.\nThe San Francisco Board of Supervisors granted approvals to transfer approximately 2 million square feet of the Shipyard\u2019s entitlements to Candlestick for research and development and office space. While this doesn\u2019t solve the problem of the Shipyard or its soil, it does mean that FivePoint will be able to develop land for\na little more than half the housing\nit originally planned \u2014 about 7,000 homes \u2014 if it can find the funding after all this time.\nThe San Francisco project could cost \u201chundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars, to develop,\u201d according to Walker &amp; Dunlop analyst Alan Ratner. And that\u2019s if the company can nab a partner at attractive terms.\nIf not, \u201cthe asset becomes worthless,\u201d Ratner said.\nFivePoint declined to make Hedigan or Haddad available for an interview. Lennar declined to participate.\nD\none it before\nGreat Park Neighborhoods, in Irvine, is among the best master-planned communities in the country, according to John Burns, who runs a research and consulting firm. Homes are modern and very uniform; residents report on Reddit that kids run around and families like the amenities, though some say landscaping is more sterile than in other Irvine developments. Either way, there are few other choices for buyers who want new builds. Valencia, in the Santa Clarita Valley, is the kind of place that began to do well during the pandemic as millennials simultaneously had kids and secured hybrid jobs that made the hourlong commute down the 5 freeway to L.A. proper tolerable. Valencia sells them angular townhomes, duplexes and single-family homes with model names like \u201cWren\u201d and \u201cSkylar\u201d for upwards of $800,000.\nGreat Park came into being after Lennar won an auction to buy the former El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in Irvine in 2005,\npaying\n$650 million for the ex-military base. In 2008, its lender, Lehman Brothers, declared bankruptcy, kicking off the global financial crisis. Development stalled until FivePoint, post-Lennar spin-off, landed\nfresh financing\nthree years later.\nHere, too, there was contamination from the military, but after a Navy cleanup, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took the majority of El Toro off the Superfund site list in 2014.\nThere were other problems. When Lennar purchased the land, it had transferred more than 1,000 acres to the city of Irvine and paid hundreds of millions of dollars in development fees. The idea was that the city would build a world-class park, and the development\u2019s homes and businesses would surround it. But the city\nspent\nmost of the $200 million Lennar paid without making much progress. By the time FivePoint took over the project, it had to figure out how to extend a private-public partnership and wrangle an agreement allowing the company to develop a scaled-back park and to double the number of homes planned.\nFivePoint made its first land sales that year, but a\nbattle\nover a cemetery tempered the victory. The city promised a veterans cemetery in the park, but Haddad, concerned about how a cemetery would be perceived by million-dollar buyers, proposed another location. The back and forth went on for a decade.\nBut development continued, and 9,400 homesites have now been sold to builders, including Lennar, as of September 2025. The homebuilders have sold 7,300 homes, and FivePoint is eyeing entitlements for more sites.\nThe road to Valencia wasn\u2019t any easier. A 2015 California Supreme Court decision required an amended analysis of the development\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and measures to protect the unarmored threespine stickleback fish, following uproar from environmental groups. In 2016, FivePoint filed an updated environmental review for the Santa Clarita Valley development, then called Newhall Ranch, which deemed the development net zero \u2014 no emissions ever. A year later, the developer reached a settlement to provide $25 million for conservation efforts and received reapprovals from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Builders have picked up about 3,100 homesites and sold nearly 1,800 to buyers as of the third quarter of 2025, according to quarterly filings.\nBut land sales have slowed while builders wait for buyers to be able to afford new homes and interest rates to ease. FivePoint has not sold any land at Valencia in about a year but said in its most recent quarterly report that it is \u201cworking with builders on two residential land sales that are expected to close in 2026.\u201d\nT\nhe missing element\nFifteen years ago, Newsom, then mayor of San Francisco, wearing a suit and signature blue tie, his hair only beginning to grey, held a press conference.\nHe signed 12 pieces of legislation to greenlight the second phase of what he said would be the largest redevelopment project in San Francisco\u2019s history \u2014 the future Shipyard and Candlestick.\nHe pitched the project well enough for at least one member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, Sophie Maxwell, to actually thank the private homebuilder at the press conference.\n\u201cI know that\u2019s the boogeyman,\u201d Maxwell said, \u201cbut I still want to thank Lennar for hanging in there with us.\u201d\nNewsom continued to beat the housing drum, and when he campaigned for governor in 2017, he promised to shepherd the addition of 3.5 million homes.\nIt made sense that Lennar and FivePoint, firms able to turn less-than-desirable land into thousands of homes, would be allies of politicians with even a slightly YIMBY bent. That\u2019s especially true in San Francisco, which is now so short of housing goals that the state could invoke a punishment called builder\u2019s remedy.\nInstead of its mandated 82,000 new units by 2031, the city\u2019s Family Zoning Plan is likely to deliver only half that, and in twice the time, according to a recent report by local economist Ted Egan. A group called the California Housing Defense Fund, which sues municipalities over noncompliant zoning, has already threatened legal action against the City of San Francisco, which could force the issue.\n\u201cThis is a pure play California strategy.\u201d\nStuart Miller, Lennar CEO, on the FivePoint spin-off\nIf triggered, builder\u2019s remedy would automatically allow some development proposals, even if they surpass local height limits or threaten rent-controlled units, essentially neutering local zoning power.\nMeanwhile, Newsom\u2019s second and final term is near an end, and there are nowhere near 3.5 million new places to live. (In 2022, running for reelection, he walked the number back to 2.5 million by 2030.) Just 650,000 new homes were permitted in the state between 2019, when he took office, and 2023, according to the San Francisco Chronicle\u2019s late 2024\nreporting\n.\nIn the same period, many developers and investors left rather than take on the feat that is building in California. That includes the country\u2019s fourth-largest apartment developer, Wood Partners, which in 2024 announced it was no longer pursuing new development projects in the state.\nA\nnew leader\nBut FivePoint pushes on in California, thanks to two sharply different personalities who have led the way through the development gauntlet.\nThe first was Emile Haddad, who came to the United States from Lebanon at age 27, following the civil war.\nThe war \u201cleft a scar \u2014 a scar of seeing communities being torn apart, families torn apart, friends torn apart,\u201d he once told a group of University of Southern California students. \u201cI started realizing that really what I have is a passion for building communities.\u201d\nHe started at Lennar in 1996.\nHaddad looked to Lennar CEO and executive chairman Stuart Miller as a mentor, a person familiar with the company said. Miller, who is also executive chairman at FivePoint, took a chance on Haddad, who rose through the ranks to chief investment officer. The two had an almost father-son relationship, though they sometimes clashed, the source said.\nAt $14, FivePoint\u2019s opening share price was below the expected range. On the first day of trading, Lennar purchased $100 million worth of shares. Lennar still owns a 40 percent share in its spin-off.\nBut FivePoint wasn\u2019t trying to be a national leader like Lennar, and Haddad\u2019s calling appeared to be on the ground in California, building alliances, wooing the press and bolstering his defenses against naysayers. Lennar\u2019s Miller may have seen that as an opportunity.\n\u201cThis is a pure play California strategy,\u201d Miller said the day of the IPO.\nAnd Haddad was all in from the start. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled,\u201d he said when Lennar outbid others on what would become Great Park. In 2011, he got financing for the stalled development in a tight lending environment. \u201cIt is very unusual in today\u2019s world to be talking about a project of this magnitude as one that is moving forward,\u201d Haddad said at a press conference then. He innovated on marketing, selling a lifestyle \u201cbefore it was a thing,\u201d a source familiar with the firm said.\nAfter the city of Irvine spent the Lennar money meant for a new park, Haddad had to win over the five-person city council on a new plan. FivePoint would develop the park in exchange for the right to sell more homesites. During a 10-minute break before the vote, in 2013, he walked to a private council room to offer some last-minute concessions, the OC Register reported. The vote, at 1:48 a.m., gave FivePoint most of what it needed. Haddad felt \u201cexcited and relieved,\u201d he said, \u201cand now I just want to go get some sleep.\u201d\nStill, over time FivePoint\u2019s board soured on Haddad. They felt he cared more about vision rather than selling land at a premium, the person familiar with the company said. In came Hedigan, an Irvine Company alum and an attorney, though Haddad remained on the board and is an advisor.\nHedigan oversaw the crucial shift of entitlements from Shipyard to Candlestick, beginning in 2023 when he said on an earnings call that the company had initiated the process to \u201cobtain an approvable plan that rebalances the current development entitlements,\u201d or the right to keep going on Candlestick while while the Shipyard remains stalled.\nCandlestick would become a \u201cstandalone development,\u201d he said, later adding in a 2024 earnings call that the approvals would serve \u201cas a catalyst for advancing conversations\u201d with potential partners. The approvals came November that year. Still, the company\u2019s shares are trading at about $6 lately, compared to about $15 at the end of the day it went public, and shareholders have all but written off the San Francisco project.\nT\nhe parcel that could\nThere was one piece of the Shipyard whose remediation went smoothly, about 70 acres on the tip of Hunters Point. The Navy had handed it to San Francisco all the way back in 2004, before the project\u2019s troubles began. In 2005, San Francisco conveyed the parcel, known as Parcel A, to Lennar, who fought its usual fight \u2014 securing approvals, negotiating land deals, and battling complaints and concerns about gentrification\u2014 before breaking ground in 2013.\nLennar never transferred Parcel A to FivePoint and itself built hundreds of homes. \u201cIt will be the next full neighborhood in San Francisco,\u201d a Lennar executive said in 2014. \u201cAlmost a city within a city.\u201d\nThe first 88 townhomes sold out in early 2015, a sign that even once-toxic sites could spur demand if they could get to the finish line.\nAll the while, Candlestick was undergoing demolition \u2014 and in Southern California, Great Park was\nbeginning\nto bloom, and Valencia was getting closer to take-off.\nBut at the Shipyard, everything outside of Parcel A was frozen. Though Lennar eventually delivered 450 townhomes and condos, the skeleton crew who moved in never felt like they lived in a flourishing master-planned urban community (there\u2019s not even a grocery store yet), though they were grateful for the neighborhood\u2019s affordability.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s there to do? Nothing really,\u201d one resident told the San Francisco Standard in 2024, conceding that he wasn\u2019t bothered by the quiet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not very walkable,\u201d another said to the same reporter. \u201cIf you want to go out to dinner, you\u2019re driving.\u201d\nHomes still for sale at Lennar\u2019s Shipyard are asking for as low as $400,000. Listings describe them as in a prime location directly on the San Francisco Bay. Four are move-in ready, two are labeled \u201cfuture release.\u201d\nS\ntaying relevant\nCandlestick could finally break ground this year, though on the adjacent peninsula. FivePoint now has to solidify its financing in a very different world.\nSan Francisco\u2019s Office of Community Investment and Infrastructure head told the San Francisco Business Times in 2024 that FivePoint informed him it had the funds on hand to break ground. The company does have $350 million cash on its balance sheet and access to another $217.5 million revolving credit facility, according to filings. That, plus Great Park Neighborhoods revenues could fund early development of Candlestick, and perhaps the firm can pace itself there until it has more clarity on when it\u2019ll actually get some or all of Shipyard from the Navy, according to Robert Rulla, a Fitch Ratings analyst.\nWhen it does need more capital, a pipeline of sites at Candlestick could provide more collateral to a lender. During recent earnings calls, Hedigan has changed his wording from saying the company continues to \u201cexplore opportunities to bring in a strategic partner or other capital sources\u201d to a slightly looser phrasing: The company \u201cremains engaged with potential capital sources to advance development,\u201d he said in the latest earnings call in October, reporting third-quarter 2025 results. Other firms on the West Coast that already have entitlements can\u2019t finance them, a knowledgeable insider said.\nThere will be plenty of time to engage lenders. Although cases concerning the botched cleanup could finally head to trial early this year, the Navy doesn\u2019t expect to transfer the Shipyard land until at least 2036, according to an agreement between San Francisco and the developer.\nWill California have solved the housing crisis by then? Will demand for San Francisco living persuade homebuyers to try these twin peninsulas?\nIf FivePoint finishes Candlestick and Shipyard, it may owe its success to Hedigan, who\u2019s kept the developer\u2019s reputation for doing hard things, even if the market doesn\u2019t have the patience for his timeline. But to bring them to life, the company could do well to heed the advice from its ex-CEO\u2019s 2012 TED Talk, about relevance.\n\u201cWe cannot survive unless we\u2019re relevant,\u201d Haddad said.",

        "content": "Multifamily syndication is an unlikely corner of real estate for a guy like Jon Venetos.\nInvestors who adopted the pooled-equity model of multifamily acquisition have a reputation. They\u2019re snake-oil salesmen for passive income, spreading the gospel of the value-add proposition to lawyers and doctors on LinkedIn: Give us money, and we\u2019ll buy old apartments, fix them up, raise the rents, sell the properties and get you an easy profit.\nMany syndicators got into the game when they were young and inexperienced. Take Sean Kia, who co-founded Tides Equities in 2016 at the age of 25. His work spawned headlines like Entrepreneur\u2019s \u201cThis 31-Year-Old Investor Nearly Quadrupled His Multifamily Housing Empire From California to Texas in Just 3 Years.\u201d\nWithin nine months of that story, Kia and his partner Ryan Andrade were begging investors for more cash. The foreclosures ramped up in 2024 as Tides\u2019 shabby apartment assets deteriorated. Then, lenders started pursuing the pair down for the loans they personally guaranteed.\nThe unraveling of Tides was the canary in the coal mine for aggressive multifamily investors and syndicators. The wave of distress then buffeted Alan Stalcup\u2019s GVA and Jay Gajavelli\u2019s Applesway Investment Group.\nVenetoses opened Lurin Capital the same year as Tides. The value proposition was similar, but the guy in charge seemed different.\nVenetos and his wife, Ashley, came up at prestigious banks and hedge funds. After launching at Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank, Jon joined Citadel in 2006, rising to head of one of the fund\u2019s stock-picking units, Surveyor Capital. Ashley did investor relations at Bill Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square.\nThe pair enjoyed the fruits of their finance paychecks, buying two penthouses in a five-story building at 87 Mercer Street in Soho. They combined the units and tapped Tony Ingrao to remodel them into a luxurious 6,700-square-foot pad, complete with a multi-level rooftop whose hot tub installation required a crane. They again hired Ingrao to design a shingled Hamptons mansion for the 2.3-acre tract they bought in Sagaponack in 2013.\nBut in 2016, a purge at Surveyor \u2014 whose primary funds tumbled at the beginning of the year \u2014 included Jon. He took a sharp turn, listing the penthouse, selling the 12,000-square-foot Hamptons estate for $15.8 million, moving to Dallas and pivoting to real estate.\n\u201cI saw a really inefficient market in real estate, specifically in the multifamily space,\u201d Venetos said on the Real Crowd Podcast in October 2022, the only time he\u2019s spoken publicly.\nHe thought he could professionalize the niche, introducing best practices from the big dogs on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \u201cThere was a significant amount of what we could define in the fundamental equity business as \u2018alpha,\u2019\u201d he said.\nThis thesis formed the basis of his multifamily portfolio, which peaked at 10,000 apartment units in 19 markets across five states.\nPlus, he had a family advantage: The Venetoses had been investing in apartments in Chicago for decades, he said.\nBut neither pedigree nor legacy were enough to save him, and it was just a matter of time before he met the same fate as his contemporaries. In the fall of 2025 came a\ncrush\nof foreclosures, default lawsuits and receivership appointments. In the hunt for money still owed to lenders and limited partners, suggestions of fraudulent dealings surfaced.\nLenders were suing on a near-daily basis by early December. Lurin Capital\u2019s mounting legal trouble started to hint of more than mismanagement or bad timing: One lawsuit accused Venetos of falsifying documents to lenders; another accused him of pocketing loan proceeds while in default. That\u2019s when former employees started coming out of the woodwork with claims that fraud was part of Lurin\u2019s operation \u2014 not just a symptom of distress.\nThat fits with trends loan servicers have tracked, according to Trimont\u2019s Rob Walton. Fraud is prevalent in Class C Texas multifamily \u201cin a way I didn\u2019t ever expect to see,\u201d he said at a multifamily conference in Dallas in August.\nIt is unclear where the Venetos are; the family moved to an Aspen mansion for a while this fall before lenders sued to foreclose on that property too. Venetos did not agree to be interviewed for the story or comment on the claims. Lurin and Venetos have denied claims made in lawsuits by their lenders.\nD\nown to Dallas\nThe Venetoses swapped their posh New York life for the large-format stateliness of Dallas\u2019 well-heeled.\nJon and Ashley moved to Highland Park, the neighborhood where Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones lives.\nThey bought the Italianate Craftsman at 4001 Miramar Avenue in 2021, a few months after the nearly 6,000-square-foot tan brick home got a glowing profile in local real estate blog Candy\u2019s Dirt. Built in 1920 for a Waco cotton merchant, it\u2019s framed by mature trees that shade the backyard and pool on an almost half-acre lot.\nThe mansion is also a block from the Dallas Country Club, and Ashley embraced the role of Highland Park wife, making multiple appearances in the Lone Star State\u2019s society rag, Paper City.\n\u201cJust give me my damn K1 and I can write this off.\u201d\nReddit user who claimed to have invested in Lurin and is ready to count their losses\nIn October 2024, she was photographed at the grand finale of Two x Two for AIDS and Art Gala, a storied Dallas fete that has drawn celebs like Alan Cumming, Natasha Richardson and Sigourney Weaver during its two-decade run. She cut a chic figure in a white skirt and cropped short-sleeve jacket, bracelets piled past her wrist; guests drank Dom Perignon and ate a four-course meal that included Regiis Ova ossetra caviar, per Culture Map.\nMeanwhile, Jon wasted no time building his multifamily empire.\nLurin launched four funds between June 2016 and January 2017, Securities and Exchange filings show. The first fund didn\u2019t have a capped offering, but the second fund offered $3 million and sold $2.98 million. The third offered $7 million and sold $6.95 million. The fourth fund sold $4.8 million of its $5 million offering. The minimum investment in the Lurin funds ranged from $5,000 to $10,000.\nIn December 2018, he signed an office lease at Rosewood Court at 2101 Cedar Springs Road, a prestigious office address in Uptown, across the street from the Crescent, the mixed-use development that anchors the sought-after neighborhood.\nFrom 2016 on, he bought a few apartment complexes in the Sun Belt each year. Purchasing ramped up in 2021 and 2022. The priciest was The Delmar, a 689-unit waterfront apartment building in Tampa that he picked up for $132.8 million in 2022. The acquisition seemed to announce that Lurin had moved into a bigger sandbox, capable of managing assets that were bigger and more centrally located than prior purchases, like The Beacon, a 223-unit complex in Huntsville, Alabama, which Lurin snapped up for $15.8 million in 2021.\nThe local business world took notice. Lurin Capital came in seventh on the annual list of fastest-growing small private companies in North Texas conducted by Southern Methodist University\u2019s Cox School of Business. The list is based on percentage growth and absolute dollar growth.\nT\nhe Venetos playbook\nLike fellow syndicators, Venetos focused on buying rental properties built after 1970 in high-growth markets. Unlike his peers, the cornerstone of the Venetos approach was rate caps.\nWhen syndicators were sweeping through Texas and picking up apartment complexes, interest rates were low. Some syndicators seemed to think they\u2019d always be. But this wasn\u2019t Venetos\u2019 first rodeo. He sensed rates would come back up again, and he paid to protect himself from that inevitability.\nDocuments provided by a former employee show that Lurin spent between 0.54 and 0.59 percent of the loan value on rate caps for three properties the firm purchased in Alabama in April 2021. The cost of rate caps quickly shot up when rates started increasing: Lurin bought a rate cap that cost more than 2.3 percent of the loan tied to a fourth Alabama property purchased in June 2022. The four caps in question cost between $76,000 and $406,000, including a $6,000 rate cap broker fee for each. They were attached to loans whose values ranged from $12.8 million to $21.8 million.\n\u201cWe have a deal where we paid sub $300,000 for interest rate cap. Today that\u2019s worth $4 million,\u201d he said in the 2022 podcast interview.\nVenetos\u2019 playbook also involved reducing exposure to external cost drivers like inflation by keeping things in the family. The Lurin Capital umbrella includes Lurin\u2019s in-house property management company Steward + Helm (which rebranded in 2024), Lurin Construction Services, Lurin Construction Management and Integrated Solutions and Integrated Renovations, two Lurin-owned companies that perform repairs, like roofing and unit upgrades.\nVenetos doesn\u2019t come off as braggadocious in the one-hour episode, but he gives the impression of an outsider who knows he\u2019s the expert.\nHe was \u201csuper surprised to hear\u201d that data-driven decision-making \u201cwas an exception rather than a rule\u201d in real estate, he said to the host. Government didn\u2019t have the answers. \u201cI think the Fed will overshoot and cause a deeper recession,\u201d he said.\nC\nrash out\nThe rapid interest rate hikes starting in 2022 proved a fatal blow for multifamily syndicators who took out floating rate debt and didn\u2019t have rate caps.\nDebt service payments ballooned. Construction costs soared. Outfits like Tides Equities and GVA effectively lost everything.\nVenetos held on longer, thanks to the rate cap play.\nBut three years later, problems hit in quick succession.\nIn April, lender Acore Capital Mortgage said Lurin defaulted on $384 million in loans tied to 12 properties in the Florida panhandle. The lender started auctioning off those properties in the spring and went after Venetos for what was left, claiming he\u2019d personally guaranteed the loans and still owed $81 million.\nBy fall, Lurin\u2019s lenders were in various stages of wresting control of Lurin properties and trying to get Venetos to pay what he still owed. Fannie Mae sued Venetos in November for defaulting on a $77.2 million loan tied to a Houston apartment complex and asked the court to appoint a receiver, claiming the conditions \u201cpresent immediate danger to tenants.\u201d Keybank did the same, claiming in a lawsuit that Lurin defaulted on $24 million in loans tied to two Dallas properties. In its lawsuit, Vista Bank alleged that he still owed $3 million after the lender took back a Lurin property at a foreclosure sale. A lender from Luxembourg, Select Securities Europe, sued Lurin, claiming it defaulted on 15 loans totaling $40.5 million.\nAll told, at least five lenders accused Lurin of defaulting on $710 million in loans tied to Sun Belt properties.\nA December lawsuit from Lurin\u2019s office landlord lays out a similar timeline.\nLurin missed a rent payment in October 2024 but caught up after two notices of default in November, landlord Rosewood Property Company wrote in a lawsuit. Lurin\u2019s last rent payment was made in May 2025. Rosewood terminated the lease in October and ordered the company to vacate, which it did in November.\nBy the end of six months, more than half of Lurin\u2019s holdings were in foreclosure proceedings or had already been handed back to lenders.\nLurin\u2019s remaining properties are mostly in receivership or foreclosure proceedings. Local municipalities have gotten involved after complaints about the decrepit state of the complexes.\nA Collin County judge on Oct. 27 issued a temporary restraining order on behalf of the city of Plano against Lurin and ordered residents of Evana Grove Apartments, an apartment complex there, to evacuate, deeming the property \u201cuninhabitable.\u201d\nThe property had racked up nearly 1,500 code violations. At the time the order was issued, residents did not have access to water, sewer or gas at the apartment complex. City official Curtis Howard called it \u201cthe worst apartment complex we have in the city of Plano.\u201d\nThis reality was starkly different from Venetos\u2019s take in 2022, when he critiqued the real estate world for not valuing human capital.\n\u201cThe people who operate your property, the people who support your properties, the people who reside in your property, the community, are all paramount to your success of that asset,\u201d he said in the same podcast interview.\nNow, it\u2019s the same groups \u2014 investors, tenants and employees \u2014 suffering most from his collapse.\n\u201cI have accepted that we as investors are totally screwed, there won\u2019t be any scraps after the banks and attorneys get whatever is left. Just give me my damn K1 and I can write this off,\u201d one Reddit user wrote on a thread about Lurin.\nDispatches from current and former residents of former Lurin properties paint a grisly picture of what can happen when value-add multifamily investors have financial trouble.\nAlondra Mendoza has lived at Estancia Estates, an apartment complex at 2222 Graycliff Drive in Dallas, for 15 years. The place was recently taken over by Dallas-based Indio Management, but during Lurin\u2019s tenure, work orders went unanswered.\n\u201cMy dad would fix everything at home,\u201d she said. When the building had a plumbing issue, Mendoza\u2019s family and her upstairs neighbor forked over $1,000 each to fix it, since Lurin wouldn\u2019t, she claimed.\nRegina Carruth, a resident of the Declan, at 1615 John West Road in Dallas, under Lurin\u2019s ownership, said the property fell into such disarray that \u201csquatters were coming in, kicking into empty apartments and staying in there.\u201d Her air conditioning didn\u2019t work for two months during the summer of 2023, the third-hottest summer in Dallas-Fort Worth on record.\n\u201cIt was just horrible,\u201d she said.\nThings got worse when Lurin stopped paying vendors altogether. Trash was an issue. At Estancia Estates, Mendoza said the dumpster was overflowing to the extent that \u201cthe trash took up half of the street.\u201d\nI\nnner workings\nOne investor surmised that Lurin didn\u2019t repurchase rate caps after they expired in 2023 and 2024, \u201cwhich made many of their properties [go] to a 3-4x higher rate, making things go to sh*t and belly up,\u201d per a Reddit post.\nBut lender lawsuits provide a first glimpse of something worse.\nKeybank alleged Venetos transferred $24,570 from his accounts with the bank to a personal account. Vista accused him of falsifying account statements from the lender in an attempt to take out loans elsewhere.\nEmployees say the fraud went deeper.\nA former employee who worked in property management and asked to remain anonymous claimed Lurin lied on reimbursement requests to lenders by inflating costs of repairs and submitting invoices for work that wasn\u2019t done. That meant Venetos could access new tranches of money before he\u2019d reached the thresholds in his renovations when they were supposed to be disbursed.\nIn an email sent after an inspection of The Sutton in Alabama, a lender rep picked up on the problem. \u201cNone of the units inspected are 100% complete as requested in the draw,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe roofing line item is 97% drawn with no work completed or materials on site.\u201d\n\u201cUninhabitable.\u201d\nA Collin County judge ordering residents of Evana Grove Apartments, a Lurin property in Plano, Texas, to evacuate\nThe lender also points out dramatic inconsistencies between the value of repairs and what was invoiced to complete the work: \u201cFor example the parking lot on the LURIN pay app is valued at ~52K and is 100% drawn while the Integrated Solutions deposit invoice values parking lot work at $210K\u201d \u2014 meaning Lurin budgeted $52,000 for the repair on an application and certification document, but submitted an invoice to its lender for $210,000. Integrated Solutions is Lurin\u2019s in-house renovations company.\n\u201cThe LURIN schedule of values need to line up with the contracts you have in place,\u201d the lender wrote.\nReal estate owners often create their own property management and construction companies to do the work at properties they own \u2014 in that, Lurin wasn\u2019t unusual.\nAt best, the coziness of these entities simply means they\u2019re fully integrated. But at worse, it means that operators can move money from an operating firm to a property management firm with little oversight.\nVenetos didn\u2019t just mislead lenders, employees claim.\nTwo former employees said Lurin stopped being eligible to offer a 401(k) plan to employees this fall but never informed employees. They provided documentation that shows their 401(k) contributions were withdrawn from their paychecks in November but not deposited into their Fidelity-managed 401(k) accounts.\nC\nonundrum Valley\nWhen things started going south, the Venetoses went north and west \u2014 to Aspen.\nThe family moved to a 4,882-square-foot manse, at 82 Winding Way Road, which they bought in April 2022. It\u2019s billed as a \u201cluxury estate compound in the Conundrum Valley,\u201d an apt location for the Dallas refugees. The blocky home, covered in reclaimed vintage barnwood, looks more like an angular office building. They bought the house and an adjacent 7.6 acres for $18 million.\nIn a Dec. 22 response to the lawsuit brought by Keybank, Venetos confirmed he and Ashley are living in Colorado, but little has emerged about what they are doing there.\nThe house\u2019s lender foreclosed in December, and it\u2019s not clear where the Venetoses are living now. A recent legal document identified a Venetos-backed LLC as having an address at 625 East Main Street, Suite 102, in Aspen.\nThe couple also finally sold their Soho penthouse \u2014 the traditional way, though below asking. The new buyer paid $17.4 million, less than a quarter of the $81 million judgment Acore is seeking. The penthouse was first listed in 2017, long before the Lurin collapse, for $29.9 million.\nMeanwhile, Lurin is fighting the default lawsuits on its remaining properties. The firm denies allegations made by Fannie Mae, claiming the lender interfered in the management of the property and forced Lurin to miss a loan payment \u201cwhich created a domino effect from which Lurin could not possibly recover.\u201d\nLurin has hung onto a few properties, like Valley Estates, at 929 Saint Paul Drive in Richardson, outside Dallas. Indio was tapped to manage two DFW properties currently in receivership, including Estancia Estates, where Mendoza lives.\nOn a December morning, reps from Indio were putting up Christmas decorations in the leasing office, and a team of men were working all over the property. Most of the doors and windows had been boarded up with plywood.\n\u201cIt looks promising,\u201d Mendoza said of the repairs.\nVenetos\u2019 victims up the chain are looking for answers too. They\u2019re also looking for Venetos, in Aspen \u201cor wherever else he may be found,\u201d as Rosewood put it in their December lawsuit against him.",
