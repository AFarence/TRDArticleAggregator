        "content": "There\u2019s a common belief these days that there\u2019s nowhere left to build in the city.\nBut Rockrose Development\u2019s $100 million purchase of a Brooklyn city block, which closed Friday, shows that\u2019s not entirely true \u2014 it just might not be easy.\nThe sale follows Rockrose dropping $65 million on a neighboring parcel in Cobble Hill that had been the site of many plans and zero apartments. Both sites were once the home of Long Island College Hospital, which Rockrose has now pieced back together.\nAn entity tied to LICH and SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University sold Rockrose the most recent site, which covers 363 Hicks Street, 365 Hicks Street, 97 Amity Street and 340 Henry Street. Newmark\u2019s Dan O\u2019Brien and Jimmy Kuhn brokered the sale.\nMadison Realty Capital owned the other site at 91-95 Pacific Street. The lender had bought it from Fortis Property Group after the developer\u2019s plans for the parcels failed to materialize and it faced foreclosure on its $48 million loan.\nFortis seemed to have bought first and planned second.\nIts initial rezoning vision was shot down by then-City Council member Brad Lander, who was looking for more affordable housing and community benefits than Fortis seemed equipped to provide. Meanwhile, the developer became locked up in a lawsuit with SUNY over what the college claims was Fortis\u2019 failure to close on a second part of the deal that would have served as a medical campus for New York University.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Rockrose may not need to pursue a rezoning and has now pieced together a prime stretch of real estate for a multi-family development. It also successfully navigated the New York State Attorney General\u2019s office, which had to approve the purchase, given the non-profit involved in the sale.\nWhile the deals don\u2019t quite amount to adaptive reuse, they show that there\u2019s still plenty of prime real estate for developers who know what to do with it.\nNow if only there was a new plan for that\nleaning tower in FiDi\n\u2026\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Home sales in January were disappointing and one economist blamed it on the weather. New York has been a tundra as of late, but if somebody\u2019s going to buy a house, is an extra layer really going to stop them? Let me know if I\u2019m wrong by emailing me at\njacob.indursky@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: In the mood for love? Head to the most loveless place on earth, Times Square, where you can watch two engagements and two actual wedding ceremonies on\nValentine\u2019s Day\n. Nothing says romance like a life-size Elmo pointing at his watch because a new couple needs to get married.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 The online prediction market Polymarket launched its free grocery store on Thursday, Curbed\nreported\n. The store is only open through Sunday and stocked with Kirkland-brand olive oil and milk that seemed to have been purchased by a nearby Aldi. One shopper told the outlet they spent 11 hours in line for $120 worth of free groceries.\n\u2014 A Long Island town issued a three-month ban on new pickleball courts, Newsday\nreported\n. Glen Cove\u2019s City Council voted unanimously to prevent residents from putting new courts on their property, mostly to quell complaints about noise. But the courts aren\u2019t gone forever. The local law was put in place so that the city can undertake a \u201cthorough examination of the impacts playing pickleball may pose to city residents.\u201d\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$57 million\nfor 70 Vestry Street, PHS. The Tribeca condo unit is 7,800 square feet.\nThe Modlin Group\u2019s\nAdam Modlin has the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$15.3 million\nfor 158 Lafayette Street. The seven-unit, mixed-use building in Soho is 19,500 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $28.9 million for 217 West 57th Street, Unit 86E. The Midtown Central condo unit is new construction and 4,300 square feet.\nThe Corcoran Group\u2019s\nKane Manera and Janet Wang have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permits filed were for a proposed 40,239-square-foot, three-story building with 59 dwelling units at 480 Rosedale Avenue in Soundview Park. Lawrence Pinner of Pinner Architect is the applicant of record.\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "Chikoo Patel and Shai Wolkowicki have once again drawn the wrath of Old National Bank, as the investors face at least the second foreclosure from the lender as their own infighting rages on in multiple court battles.\nOld National Bank filed a foreclosure\nlawsuit this week targeting a mixed-use multifamily and retail property suited for ground-floor medical or dental office space at 316-324 Lake Street in Oak Park, according to public records.\nThe bank alleges that the duo, operating through Halsted South Partners, LLC, defaulted on a debt totaling approximately $2.32 million. According to the complaint, the borrowers failed to make monthly installments starting in November 2025, prompting the lender to accelerate the debt and seek a receiver to take over the property\u2019s management while the court case plays out.\nThe Oak Park filing is just the latest headache for\nPatel and Wolkowicki\n, whose partnership has dissolved into a thicket of litigation and allegations of financial misconduct. Old National is already pursuing a $16 million foreclosure against the pair for a larger multifamily property downstate in Springfield, a case that remains pending in court.\nThe broader collapse began with the implosion of Patel\u2019s firm, CKO Real Estate, which fashioned itself as an experienced property manager prepared to operate South and West Side multifamily buildings in challenging Chicago neighborhoods. It raised money from people who said they depended on CKO to handle repairs, rent collection and working with tenants in affordable housing programs funded by state and federal sources.\nBut multiple investors \u2014 including Wolkowicki and his wife Lauren Lampert, who have Chicago roots but now live in Boca Raton, Florida \u2014 have sued Patel, alleging he misappropriated or \u201cstole\u201d roughly millions of dollars from various businesses. Wolkwowicki and Lampert specifically claim Patel wasted over $10 million in investment capital by mismanaging properties and siphoning funds away from business operations into his own personal accounts.\nThe unraveling has also caught the attention of corporate creditors; American Express recently sued Patel for unpaid credit card debt of more than $63,000 as his firm\u2019s portfolio faced a wave of building code violations and habitability complaints from tenants.\nWolkowicki didn\u2019t return requests for comment and Patel and an attorney for Patel didn\u2019t return requests for comment. Patel\u2019s lawyer has previously said his client denies Wolkowicki\u2019s allegations.\nWhile the two were once frequent collaborators, Wolkowicki has another once-productive relationship that has soured into a legal civil war. Last year, Wolkowicki\nfiled a separate lawsuit pitting him against Mitch Goltz\n, the former partner in their old firm GW Properties, which has been selling off real estate throughout Chicagoland to wind down.\nGoltz, who now heads the firm GTZ Development, declined to comment on the dispute with Wolkowicki, which centers around how Goltz handled the distribution of proceeds from last year\u2019s\n$31 million sale of the Church Street Plaza\nproperty in Evanston. Goltz reiterated a separate\nforeclosure suit he and Wolkowicki are facing on a LaGrange property\nthat remains in the GW portfolio, filed by a venture of Chicago real estate firm Wolcott Group, and is still in the process of being resolved through new financing.\nWhile Wolkowicki deals with the fallout of his distressed multifamily holdings, Goltz is pivoting toward big redevelopment further west into the suburbs. GTZ is in talks to bring an\nAmazon large-store retail format and an Ashley Furniture store\nto an office campus in Oak Brook that his firm\nacquired at a deep discount out of distress\n. The seven office buildings on the property may be torn down to make way for the retailers.\nHowever, legal and financial pressures mark a downturn for Wolkowicki, who previously made headlines for reasons outside of real estate. In 2014, he was a victim in a boating accident on Lake Michigan that killed three of his friends, leaving him stranded on the water only to be discovered the next day. He was the sole survivor who was aboard the watercraft, whose fractional ownership company, insurers and repair company agreed in 2018 to a $27.9 million settlement with Wolkowicki and the estates of the other victims.\nThe next court date in the lawsuit Wolkowicki brought against Patel is scheduled for a March 9 hearing.\n",

        "content": "While the headlines in post-Super Bowl San Francisco were taken up by an extended teachers\u2019 strike that kept children out of school all week, Mayor Daniel Lurie \u2014 whose own frustrations with the strike fed the news cycle \u2014 quietly signed what could end up as one of the most impactful pieces of housing legislation in his tenure.\nOn Thursday, Lurie formally established a new public financing program he hopes will incentivize the conversion of the old office buildings of San Francisco\u2019s urban core into housing. The so-called Downtown Revitalization Financing District will direct increases in property tax revenue toward annual incentive payments for eligible conversion projects. The district\u2019s boundaries include the Financial District, Union Square, and parts of the Market Corridor and SOMA.\nSan Francisco rose as the poster child for the pandemic\u2019s decimation of America\u2019s traditional central business districts. Cities across the country concluded that a resilient downtown meant a transition from a strictly commercial center into a more mixed-use neighborhood. Thus, converting office towers into apartments was viewed as a key strategy. However, these projects proved expensive and logistically complex. Like some other cities, San Francisco has seen zero conversions, despite the hyped up potential.\nThe tax increment financing district set up by Lurie and the San Francisco Board of Supervisors could put more than $1.2 billion of redirected property tax increases into these projects over the next 30 years, according to city documents. The city estimates that about 50 buildings within the district could make for a good conversion, with the potential to add up to 7,000 new homes. One source inside the city\u2019s Office of Economic and Workforce Development\ntold the San Francisco Chronicle\nthat the typical project could receive about $100,000 per unit in incentives.\nYet, conversions are most feasible when the commercial real estate market has hit the floor, and investors can purchase old towers for steep discounts. Over the last year, the city\u2019s\ncommercial real estate market has bounced back profoundly\n. However, much of that activity has been confined to Class A and trophy buildings, which has left mid-to-low tier office towers,\nsuch as the one at 260 California Street,\nwith big question marks looming overhead.\nNew life for capped taxes\nSince it went into effect nearly three years ago,\nMeasure United to House L.A.\nhas drawn the attention of housing developers up and down California. Approved by voters in Los Angeles, ULA, which implements a 4-to-5.5 percent real estate transfer tax on home sales of greater than $5 million, has been criticized for stalling new housing construction in the city. Late last month, the\nLos Angeles City Council rejected proposed amendments to the legislation\n\u2014 which would have to be approved by voters \u2014 that would have carved out exemptions to the tax for multifamily properties.\nThwarted development in Los Angeles has seemed to fuel interest in a statewide limit on local real estate transfer taxes. A petition is now circling the state that asks whether they want to vote capping real estate transfer taxes throughout California. If it qualifies, which the president of the sponsoring Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association told CalMatters he is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about, Californians would vote on the tax cap in November. The League of California Cities estimates the measure, if approved, could trim tax revenue up to $3 billion per year, with the shortfall spread over municipalities big and small.\nYet, it may not be the only citizen-initiated tax limit on the ballot in November. Earlier this week, a petition began making its way through California that would exempt homeowners 60 and older from paying property taxes on their primary residence. According to the Secretary of State\u2019s office, the initiative could cost local governments and school districts up to $20 billion per year.\nCalifornia homeowners already enjoy the benefits of Prop 13. Passed in 1978 after a tax revolt, Prop 13 changed the landscape of homeownership in California, as it tightly limited how much a home\u2019s assessed value could increase. It is essentially rent control for owners. The legislation has resulted in fewer houses hitting the market, and has been cited as exacerbating the state\u2019s housing crisis.\n",

        "content": "Hilton &amp; Hyland\nlost its managing director, and you could call industry reaction to the latest in the brokerage\u2019s saga muted to say the least.\nSteve Katz, who joined the brokerage a\u00a0 little over a year ago, exited quietly shortly after New Year\u2019s Day, and was succeeded by Felix Pena.\nA lack of buzz about the latest twist at Hilton &amp; Hyland calls into question the brokerage\u2019s relevance in the market, and it comes off of what could be viewed as a particularly tough stretch for the business. That includes agent and executive departures, a lawsuit from what is now Hilton &amp; Hyland\u2019s former landlord over alleged unpaid rent, and a move to smaller offices on Maple Drive in Beverly Hills\u2019s Golden Triangle.\nInterestingly, the Maple Drive address is the same building where Hilton Hilton \u2014 the brokerage led by Hilton &amp; Hyland co-founder Rick Hilton \u2014 has set up shop. That business also seems to be at its own inflection point.\nThe Real Deal\nreported earlier this month The Agency poached\nJustin Alexander\nand two of his team members from Hilton Hilton. That\u2019s left the brokerage with an agent headcount of four, according to records pulled from the California Department of Real Estate on Friday.\nOn the primaries\nWant another example of a muted reaction from this past week? Look no further than L.A.\u2019s mayoral race, which saw Fourth District Councilmember\nNithya Raman\n\u2019s last-minute entry about a week ago.\nIf residential real estate cared about this latest development for the June primaries, the industry hid it well.\nRaman, a Democratic Socialists of America member, turned the heads of some within real estate late last month with her proposed\nMeasure United to House L.A.\ncarveouts, which mainly speak to commercial developers. That\u2019s a 15-year exemption from the tax for newly built multifamily, commercial and mixed-use projects. For existing commercial and residential properties, the proposed amendments do little outside a carveout in instances of a natural disaster. This could explain the largely silent reaction to the latest development at city hall.\nStill, when it comes to mayor of Los Angeles, the question is whether the industry\u2019s residential segment will offer a collective \u2014 or at least stronger \u2014 voice on the matter.\nWhat people are saying\nIn residential real estate, market dynamics are often oversimplified to either a buyer\u2019s or seller\u2019s market. What\u2019s playing out right now is more nuanced.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019 Jonathan Mogharrabi and Marci Kays are coming off a busy week in which they closed on\ntwo Los Feliz properties\n. That\u2019s no easy feat in an Eastside market Mogharrabi described as being more \u201csensitive\u201d in terms of deal flow. It\u2019s not that the market is slow, he said. It could be that the sell strategy of other listings may be missing the mark or buyer expectations.\nWhat he\u2019s saying holds weight considering he and Kays just double ended Wednesday\u2019s closing of Fear of God founder and designer Jerry Lorenzo\u2019s Los Feliz home at 2401 Nottingham Avenue for $8.6 million. Then, on Friday, the two represented the buyer and seller on 2720 Glendower Avenue for $7.4 million.\nWhat Mogharrabi is saying lines up with a point Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Nicole Plaxen noted last month when the listing at\n1200 Bel Air Road\nwas reduced to just under $100 million. That price cut wasn\u2019t the result of no buyer interest, she pointed out. Instead, it was about meeting \u201ctoday\u2019s buyer mindset.\u201d\nLA\u2019s condo market\nNext week sales are expected to resume on the former Pendry Residences, now called the\nSun Rose Residences\n.\nThere are a dozen units left at the 40-residence property sitting at 8420 Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood. They\u2019ll be priced from $4.3 million to $8 million and range from 3,010 square feet to 4,656 square feet of interior space.\nCondo building relaunches and resets are not an anomaly in a market often viewed as less mature than New York or Miami. Salespeople like to talk about the demand for security and services at a condo tower that are supposedly boosting local demand, but one can\u2019t turn away from all the about-faces on strategies to sell.\nLast June,\nTRD\nreported on the\nreintroduction\nof the Mandarin Oriental Residences in Beverly Hills and The Harland in West Hollywood. Each property has its own reason for the why behind the retooling. Part of it was a pricing mismatch. Sometimes it comes down to understanding the market and what amenities make sense.\nAll that to say, it will be interesting to see what\u2019s in store for when the Aman Residences \u2014 the ultra-luxe condos at Cain\u2019s\nOne Beverly Hills\nmixed-use project \u2014 are delivered to the market.\n",

Gallego, painted as the ringleader by prosecutors, is the only one still in jail after being\ndenied bond\n.\nSince the initial charges, the West Kendall HOA went through\nreceivership\n, multiple civil suits and board elections. The criminal case? It periodically pops up for brief status hearings that shed no light on when trial will begin. Sometimes, hearings are postponed, including one for Feb. 6 moved to Tuesday.\n\u201cWe all want a conclusion,\u201d said Ana Danton, one of the roughly 18,000 Hammocks residents.\nAt issue:\nHOA\nfraud cases are massive, involving voluminous evidentiary files, and many witnesses and subpoenas, experts say. The problem is especially pronounced at the Hammocks due to its size and the fact that the HOA kept paper records. The court called it a \u201cmonster\u201d case.\nBy last spring, the state submitted its final evidence, so Judge Laura Cruz called on defense attorneys to schedule depositions and said that continually blaming the amount of paperwork would eventually become\n\u201cproblematic.\n\u201d Gallego\u2019s attorney,\nSabino Jauregui\n, countered the state had years to review files but the defense gets\nmonths.\nHe then filed a motion to disqualify or recuse Cruz, which was denied. (Judge Andrea Ricker Wolfson now presides, which a court spokesperson previously said was due to regular judge rotation.)\nJauregui and most defense attorneys didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Gonzalez\u2019s attorney declined to comment.\nGeorge Pallas, an attorney for\nIvan Dario Diez\n, accused of posing as a vendor, said the state controls the investigation\u2019s pace and built its case \u201cincrementally,\u201d hence Diez\u2019s 2024 arrest, showing \u201cthe probe is still active and evolving.\u201d\n\u201cMy client is entitled to a complete picture of the evidence, not piecemeal revelations that keep extending the proceedings,\u201d said Pallas, who has said Diez did legitimate work and was targeted by others who took plea deals.\nFor Hammocks residents, the protracted case has been years in the making. It took five years after investigators started poking into the HOA for the 2022 charges to be filed.\n\u201cWe want it to end, and it\u2019s been so long,\u201d Danton said.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill California\u2019s wealth tax send even more billionaires fleeing to South Florida?

        "content": "Ron Perelman is one step closer to shedding his worldly possessions.\nThe billionaire sold his Upper East Side townhouse at 36 East 63rd Street for $46.75 million, a source close to the deal told\nThe Real Deal\n. The townhouse had been asking $49.5 million.\nThe Modlin Group\u2019s Adam Modlin and Brown Harris Stevens\u2019 Sami Hassoumi had the listing. Leslie Garfield\u2019s Matt Lesser represented the buyer.\nPerelman listed the home for $60 million in 2021 during a period in which he sold off many of his assets in an attempt to live a \u201csimpler life.\u201d In 2022, he sold his Hamptons estate for\n$84 million\n.\nHis 40-foot-wide Neo Georgian Mansion proved harder to unload, and the listing rotated through a number of the top townhouse brokers in the city.\nPerelman initially tried to sell both the larger home and an attached smaller townhouse for\n$75 million in 2020\n, before listing his 16,000-square-foot house separately in\nApril 2021\n. Both listings were with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Serena Boardman.\nBHS\u2019 Paula Del Nunzio joined as a co-broker several months later. In 2023, John Burger and Sami Hassoumi of BHS\ntook over the listing\nat the same $60 million price tag.\nThe next year, Modlin replaced Burger. He and Hassoumi kept the home priced at $60 million until finally lowering the price to $55 million in October 2024, and then to its last asking price of $49.5 million in June 2025.\nThe property had served as Perelman\u2019s primary residence for years. Built in 1930, it once served as a private club for aviators, known as the Hangar Club. The home has 10 bedrooms and more than 10 bathrooms across its three floors. It has a private screening room, a home gym, a wine cellar and a landscaped roof.\nAt one point in the 1980s, Perelman was considered the richest man in America. His firm, MacAndrews &amp; Forbes, owned a number of high-profile brands, including Marvel Comics and later, Revlon. The firm suffered during the pandemic as Revlon\u2019s share price plummeted from $25 to $5. It was during this time that Perelman sold a number of his personal assets, including planes, yachts and part of his art collection.\nThe townhouse is the latest in what has been a string of marquee Upper East Side homes to sell after years on the market.\nLast year, the\nWoolworth Mansion\nat 4 East 80th Street sold for $38 million after asking as high as $90 million back in 2011. Less than one block away from Perelman\u2019s home, Oleg Cassini\u2019s former townhouse, which one asked $65 million, is awaiting court approval for a sale after receiving\nan offer of $35 million\nlast fall.",

        "content": "High-profile Chicago real estate industry figures are pouring donations into the Cook County Board President\u2019s race, but are showing less of a united front than they are in the\nTax Assessor\u2019s race,\ncampaign finance data shows.\nChicago Alderman Brendan Reilly, who represents much of the Loop and River North, is challenging longtime incumbent Toni Preckwinkle in the Democratic primary for Cook County Board President, which is set for March 17.\nAs final donations roll in, industry leaders including Fifield Companies\u2019 Steve Fifield, Riverside Investment\u2019s John O\u2019Donnell, Hubbard Street Group\u2019s John McLinden, developer Scott Greenberg, Waterton CEO David Schwartz, Equity Commonwealth REIT CEO David Helfand and members of\nbillionaire Neil Bluhm\u2019s family\nare some of Reilly\u2019s most prominent real estate donors. Neil Bluhm, his son Andrew and daughter Meredith Bluhm each gave $17,000 to the Reilly campaign.\nOne of Reilly\u2019s most impactful real estate donors is former Cinespace owner-turned-real estate investor and lender\nAlexander Pissios\nwho gave the campaign $50,000. Other business community donors include trading and real estate investment firm DRW\u2019s founder\nDon Wilson\nand Lettuce Entertain You restaurant group founder Rich Melman.\nWhile Preckwinkle has courted fewer industry heavy-hitters than Reilly, she still secured some donations from prominent real estate names, including\nCapri Investment\u2019s Quintin Primo\nand Clayco\u2019s Michael Fassnacht. She has also enjoyed broad support from construction companies and trade unions like The Chicago Federation of Labor and the International Association of Operating Engineers.\nReilly has raised at least $609,000 since the start of 2026, when his campaign had over $1.2 million on hand, compared to Preckwinkle raising at least $480,000 raised since the start of the year, when she had more than $614,000 in campaign cash, according to state campaign finance reports.\nThe labor and business split is a departure from patterns seen in donations in the Cook County Tax Assessor\u2019s race. Both groups are coalescing around challenger Patrick Hynes instead of incumbent Fritz Kaegi, a recent analysis by\nThe Real Deal\nfound.\nBoth Kaegi and Preckwinkle are supported by progressive organization Citizens Action Illinois. But Preckwinkle hasn\u2019t faced as much public scrutiny as Kaegi, who has borne the brunt of the blame from real estate investors frustrated by\nwild fluctuations in Cook County tax bills\nsince the pandemic. Preckwinkle also secured a $150,000 donation from Governor J.B. Pritzker.\nFurther, she\ncommissioned a study of Chicago\u2019s property tax system\nmore broadly with a goal of making the process more predictable for investors and homeowners alike. Kaegi has said he supports the recommendations in the study, which includes improving communication and data sharing between the tax assessor and the Board of Review so that initial assessments and appealed assessments\ndon\u2019t vary as widely as they do now\n.\nMeanwhile, Reilly, a moderate Democrat on Chicago City Council, is running a critical campaign against Preckwinkle amid backlash against progressives more generally. As Chicago\u2019s progressive\nMayor Brandon Johnson struggles\nto maintain support, real estate figures have been strategizing ways to regain influence in local politics.\nReilly has tried to pin blame on Preckwinkle for recently blown deadlines during a technology update for Cook County\u2019s property tax data and billing systems that severely delayed tax bills. The systemic setbacks causing the late tax bills forced local school districts to incur steep interest costs on loans while they waited for their share of tax revenue.\nReilly even suggested he would cancel the county\u2019s long-running contract with Tyler Technologies \u2014 the firm tasked with the tech upgrade \u2014 if the delays persist.\nPreckwinkle has pushed back against this narrative, noting that the property tax system is a multi-agency effort involving other independently elected officials, like the assessor and treasurer, who handle valuations and billing. She maintains that the solution lies in collaborative problem-solving rather than finding fault or attacking colleagues in other departments.\nHer supporters point out she hasn\u2019t raised Cook County\u2019s portion of the property tax levy for her entire tenure, nearly 16 years.\nWhoever wins the March primary is expected to win the general election in November because Cook County is considered a safely Democratic county.",

        "content": "Billionaire John Goff\u2019s firm, Crescent Real Estate, is locking in fresh debt on one of Uptown Dallas\u2019 signature properties.\nThe Fort Worth-based investor secured a $596 million refinancing for The Crescent, a 1.3 million-square-foot mixed-use complex of three interconnected buildings at 100, 200, 300 and 500 Crescent Court. Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan Chase Bank originated the three-year, floating-rate CMBS loan, with JLL Capital Markets arranging it, Commercial Property Executive\nreported\n.\nCrescent\nbought the 10-acre property in 2021 from J.P. Morgan Asset Management for $700 million, or roughly $495 per square foot, according to Yardi Matrix. At the time, Goldman provided a $465 million acquisition loan. Los Angeles-based Gibson Dunn advised Goldman on the latest refinancing.\nLast year,\nCrescent paid\n$292 million for the 21-story\nTexas Capital Center\n, at 2000 McKinney Avenue, in what was the city\u2019s largest office deal in years and the second biggest deal in Dallas-Fort Worth in 2025.\nCompleted in 1983, The Crescent includes three LEED Gold-certified office towers totaling 1.2 million square feet, plus a 167,510-square-foot retail and atrium component, according to the publication. The 18-story and 19-story buildings feature 30,500-square-foot floorplates and a roster of blue-chip tenants, including Jefferies, BankUnited, BMO Harris Bank, Wells Fargo, PNC Bank, Raymond James, UBS, Regus and Dentons. The property was 90 percent leased at closing.\nBeyond office space, the complex functions as a mini mixed-use district. Amenities include a fitness center, art gallery, two salons and a 3,600-space parking garage, according to a news release. The site is also home to 11 restaurants, the Hotel Crescent Court and its adjoining spa.\nElsewhere in Uptown, Crescent closed on CBRE\u2019s 19-story headquarters at\n2100 McKinney Avenue\nin December, with $170.4 million in financing.\nThe refinancing for The Crescent comes as Dallas\u2019 office market shows tentative signs of stabilization. In December, average asking rents hit $32 per square foot, up 2.8 percent, year-over-year, though slightly below the national average of $33, according to Yardi Matrix. Vacancies fell from the same period a year earlier to 21.1 percent \u2014 still above the 18.4 percent national rate, but part of a broader trend that saw 17 of the top 25 U.S. office markets post year-over-year vacancy declines in 2025.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "There\u2019s not much left of Harwood District that still belongs to\nHarwood International\n; after March\u2019s foreclosure sale, there may be even less.\nGabriel Barbier-Mueller\u2019s beleaguered Uptown development firm risks losing a block of condo units at Bleu Ciel, at 3130 North Harwood Street. It marks the first foreclosure of the year for the firm which gave up ownership of seven office properties in 2025 in a spate of foreclosures and sales.\nThe company\u2019s latest predicament involves an alleged default on a loan from TexasBank, according to a foreclosure notice. Loan documents show TexasBank provided a $30 million loan in December 2024 backed by 26 units at Bleu Ciel. Since the loan was provided, at least six units were sold, causing Harwood to be relieved of parts of its debt burden.\nHowever, the fact that Harwood still owns any condos at the property appears to indicate that about 10 percent of the property\u2019s 158 units never originally sold \u2014 eight years after Bleu Ciel opened in 2018. The property\u2019s website says it\u2019s 85 percent sold and advertises 16 units, including four penthouses.\nThis is the first time Harwood\u2019s distress has bled from its office portfolio into another asset class.\nIt comes a week after San Francisco-based private equity fund TPG announced it would be\nHarwood\u2019s recapitalization partner\n. Harwood quietly sold off five office properties, totalling 1.2 million square feet, to TPG starting in the fall:\nHarwood No. 2, at 2728 North Harwood Street;\nHarwood No. 3, at 2727 North Harwood Street;\nHarwood No. 6 (also known as Saint Ann Court), at 2501 North Harwood Street;\nHarwood No. 7 (also known as Frost Tower), at 2950 North Harwood Street; and\nHarwood No. 10, at 2850 North Harwood Street.\nTPG has plans to renovate the properties. According to the announcement, Harwood retains a minority stake.\nThe firm also lost two properties to foreclosure in 2025.\nIt handed back the keys to\nHarwood No. 4\nin April and lost\nHarwood No. 1\nin November. San Francisco-based Spear Street Capital took back Harwood No. 4, at 2828 North Harwood Street, in a $73 million credit bid.\nFirst United Bank seized\nHarwood\u2019s first development, at 2651 North Harwood Street, with a $27 million credit bid. Bill Cawley\u2019s\nCawley Partners bought the property\non Dec. 30.\nThe\nforeclosures started with Harwood No. 6\n, which Harwood saved from a January 2025 auction with a last-minute recapitalization deal.\nAnother blow came for the company when Jones Day, which was supposed to anchor the upcoming Harwood No. 15,\npulled out of the project\nlate last year.\nThe firm\u2019s distress is glaringly out of sync with Uptown\u2019s otherwise robust office market. The submarket has been a reliable outlier in a region that continues to struggle with\nhigh vacancy rates\n.\nThe coveted submarket has become synonymous with\nY\u2019all Street\n, with banks like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America selecting Uptown for expensive built-to-suit projects. Uptown also boasts the highest rents of any submarket in Dallas-Fort Worth, with an overall average gross rent of $62.21 per square foot, according to a recent report from Partners Real Estate.\n",

Opened in 1976, the Fairfield plant has operated for nearly 50 years as a major brewing, packaging and distribution hub, occupying a prominent site visible from Interstate 80.\nThe shutdown follows a wave of industrial pullbacks across the region from other manufacturers including USS-Posco Industries in Pittsburg, Valero\u2019s refinery in Benicia and the Mare Island dry dock.\nAnheuser-Busch announced the Fairfield closure in December as part of a broader restructuring of its U.S. manufacturing footprint, which also includes shuttering a plant in Merrimack, New Hampshire, and selling its Newark, New Jersey, facility.\nCompany officials said production from the three sites has been shifted to other U.S. breweries following nearly $2 billion in nationwide manufacturing investments.\nCity Manager David Gassaway said officials are already exploring potential reuse options for the highly specialized site, though redevelopment could prove challenging.\n\u201cTo be clear, I don\u2019t think it will be an easy task given the large and highly specialized nature of the facility,\u201d Gassaway said. \u201cI hope I\u2019m wrong though.\u201d\nThe complex spans more than 1 million square feet across 10 parcels and includes solar and gas power infrastructure as well as two wind turbines. Nearby, California Forever is planning a large-scale development east of the brewery along Highway 12.\nState filings show 238 Fairfield employees received layoff notices, per the Business Times, though the company said workers were offered transfers to other facilities. Fairfield Mayor Catherine Moy warned the impacts extend further, estimating that more than 500 workers at auxiliary companies could also be displaced, with millions in lost tax revenue for the city and state.\n\u2014\nLauren Elkies Schram\n",

        "content": "After less than a year with a development startup, Caitlin Chagan is returning to Douglas Elliman.\nThe former development marketing executive, who\nleft the firm\nafter a decade-long stint, is joining the brokerage once again, this time as the president of Douglas Elliman Development Marketing in New York.\n\u201cThis is really a homecoming for me,\u201d said Chagan, whose previous roles at Elliman included managing its Brooklyn portfolio and the Eklund-Gomes Team\u2019s portfolio. \u201cI left, I explored, and I came back more convinced than ever.\u201d\nChagan exited Elliman in July to serve as a co-founder and managing partner of Redeavor, a development advisory firm\nlaunched early last year\nby executives from the Agency, Official Partners, ST Residential and Formida Capital. While at Redeavor, Chagan was tasked with heading up the firm\u2019s expansion to the New York market.\nThe firm does not appear to have any active projects in the region, according to its website. Among its projects are the Ritz Carlton Residences and Hotel in Houston, Texas, the Pendry Residences in Nashville, The Ainsley in West Hollywood and other developments in California and Las Vegas.\n\u201cI left [Elliman] back in July really to pursue a vision, and that vision was to create the best in class services to my clients,\u201d Chagan said. She added that after a few months with Redeavor, she realized, \u201cthe only place that I could have that vision truly realized is back here.\u201d\nMike Leipart, a Redeavor co-founder and managing partner, said in a statement that he and his partners were \u201cbig fans\u201d of Chagan and \u201cappreciate her contributions\u201d to the team.\n\u201cThis is an incredible opportunity, and we wish her continued success as she returns to Douglas Elliman,\u201d Leipart said.\nBack at Elliman, Chagan will oversee all New York operations for the firm\u2019s new development arm, including jumping in on existing projects as well as working on the pre-development of upcoming developments in the city, Long Island, the Hamptons and Westchester. Her position as president is a new one for the company, which is run on a national scale by longtime Elliman executive,\nSusan de Fran\u00e7a\n.\nElliman CEO Michael Liebowitz billed Chagan\u2019s move as a \u201cbig victory\u201d for the firm, which has lost several of its top agents and leaders following the\nabrupt retirement\nof Elliman\u2019s longtime leader, Howard Lorber, in October 2024. Liebowitz took the helm shortly after with the promise of\nushering in a \u201cnew era\u201d\nfor the firm.\nLiebowitz said that establishing Chagan as a leader in the New York region joins his efforts to double down on the company\u2019s development sector, which he described as Elliman\u2019s \u201cmarquee crown jewel.\u201d He added that the firm plans to invest in its New York operations specifically.\n\u201cDevelopers are demanding, and we want to meet that demand,\u201d Liebowitz said. \u201cI\u2019m bullish on New York. New development in New York is going to be much stronger than people believe.\u201d\n",

The 10-year deal spans the entire 37th floor and part of the 36th floor at the 42-story tower. The asking rent was not disclosed.\nJLL\u2019s Lisa Kiell and Andrew Coe represented the tenant in the deal, which was first reported by the New York Post.

The property has faced a wave of turnover over the past few years after\nseveral major tenants\nvacated nearly 700,000 square feet across 25 floors.\nRecent lease signings and pending deals leave just 24,000 square feet of that rollover space to backfill, CEO Marc Holliday said during the firm\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call.\nThe rebound comes as Sixth Avenue emerges as one of Manhattan\u2019s strongest submarkets, with rents rising thanks to constrained supply along Park Avenue.\nManhattan office leasing\nposted its strongest quarter at the end of last year since before the pandemic.\n\u201cSixth Avenue is the new Park Avenue,\u201d Holliday said. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing rents rise dramatically on the avenue, given the tightening of supply.\u201d\nLeasing activity jumped more than 25 percent quarter-over-quarter to 11.9 million square feet, the borough\u2019s most active quarter since late 2019.Demand surged, availability tightened and rents pushed higher across much of the city, according to Colliers data.\nLocated between West 46th and West 47th streets in the Plaza District, 1185 Sixth Avenue sits steps from Rockefeller Center and major transit hubs. SL Green overhauled the 1.1 million-square-foot 1971 building with a newly-renovated entryway, lobby, elevator cabs and corridor to compete with gleaming new developments.\nGroombridge, Wu, Baughman &amp; Stone did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",

        "content": "The family of former Texas state Sen. Don Huffines quietly acquired the late Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s infamous Zorro Ranch in New Mexico in 2023, four years after the disgraced financier\u2019s death in federal custody.\nA limited liability company tied to the Huffines family bought the property at public auction in 2023 for an undisclosed price. The purchase was first\nreported\nby the Santa Fe New Mexican, which cited public records obtained through information requests. According to the paper, proceeds from the sale benefited Epstein\u2019s victims, the Texas Tribune\nreported\n.\nAs previously reported in\nThe Real Deal\n, San Rafael Ranch LLC was\nregistered\nwith New Mexico\u2019s secretary of state office in July of 2023, though its tie to the Huffines family was not revealed at the time.\nThe property, in southern Santa Fe County, features a 26,700-square-foot\u00a0 mansion, private airstrip, hangar, helipad, ranch office, firehouse and heated garage as part of the expansive ranch.\nThe Huffines purchasing entity later challenged the ranch\u2019s tax valuation, arguing it should be reduced to $13.4 million in part because of the property\u2019s \u201cnotoriety,\u201d according to the New Mexican. The records obtained by the publication show the property was renamed in 2024 to San Rafael Ranch and its address is now 49 Rancho San Rafael Road, near Stanley, New Mexico.\nIn a statement Friday, Huffines\u2019 campaign spokesperson Allen Blakemore said the family had \u201cnever visited the property\u201d before it was listed, and purchased it four years after Epstein\u2019s death. In a follow-up statement Monday, Blakemore added that the family has not been contacted by authorities about searching the ranch, but would cooperate if asked.\nAlthough he was never charged in New Mexico, the state\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office had confirmed an investigation into\nEpstein\u2019s activities\nat the ranch. The renewed scrutiny comes after emails recently surfaced alleging that two girls may be buried at or near the property, prompting calls from New Mexico officials for federal and state authorities to open a probe.\nThe deal surfaced as Huffines campaigns for\nTexas comptroller\n, the state\u2019s chief financial officer overseeing taxes and investments. News of the ranch\u2019s ownership also comes as the U.S. Department of Justice released the latest tranche of documents tied to\nEpstein\nrevealing more of the billionaire\u2019s ties to the elected officials and other notable leaders.\nHuffines previously lost a 2022 primary challenge to Gov. Greg Abbott and now faces Acting Comptroller Kelly Hancock, Michael Berlanga and Railroad Commissioner Christi Craddick in the March 3 Republican primary. A poll released this week shows Huffines leading ahead of early voting.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Pakistan is back to square one with its attempt to sell the multi-billion-dollar\nRoosevelt Hotel\nproject site.\nThe government\u2019s privatization commission is once again trying to find a broker to help monetize the development site at 45 East 45th Street, just across from Grand Central Terminal \u2014 which could be redeveloped into a 1.8 million square foot office tower.\nThe commission put out a call for brokers and financial advisors who have \u201cproven experience of successful completion of similar transactions in [the] New York metropolitan area (more specifically in Manhattan\u2013NYC) or any other metropolitan city of [the] USA,\u201d according to a request for proposals.\nThe 1920s era, 1,205-room hotel is a prime office development site that\u2019s available at a time when\ndevelopers\nare\neager\nto build new commercial towers for tenants willing to pay a premium for the newest, best spaces. But the new RFP comes after a few failed attempts to come up with a deal for the site over the past year.\nThe Pakistani government in 2024 hired JLL to market the property either for an outright sale or a joint venture development partnership. JPMorgan kicked the tires and\nShahal Khan\u2019s Burkhan World Investments\npitched a plan to co-develop the site.\nBut no agreement materialized and in July JLL resigned. The company cited a conflict of interest from clients who were interested in bidding on the site. But considering that brokerages deal with that potential conflict every day, the explanation was seen as a gracious way for both sides to part ways.\nPakistani officials at that time said they were intent on fast-tracking the process of hiring a new advisor, and in late November, it was reported that a team of CBRE and Morgan Stanley was the frontrunner to win the assignment. The Pakistani government said there was increased interest in the site after New York City terminated its contract to use the hotel as a migrant shelter.\nBut in January the privatization commission announced that it had hit reset on the hiring process after five of the seven proposals under consideration were rejected for non-compliance. (It\u2019s not clear who the candidates were, but when JLL won the process in 2024, a consortium led by Savills came in second place.)\nAnd this time around, the government has ruled out selling the property outright.\nPakistani prime minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s adviser on privatisation, Muhammad Ali, said the government is intent on redeveloping the property as part of a JV, according to\nmedia reports\n.\nUnder the plan the government would contribute the land into the venture and a development partner would pony up about $1 billion in equity, with the JV taking on another $2 billion to $3 billion in debt. The Pakistani government intends to have an ownership stake of around 40 to 50 percent.\nMany in New York\u2019s development community, however, remain skeptical as Pakistan\u2019s bureaucratic government has waffled over what to do with the hotel since acquiring it in 2000.\nPakistan is privatizing the Roosevelt along with other government-owned assets as part of a $7 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.\n",

The nine-building campus totals roughly 433,000 square feet, putting the deal at $536 per square foot.\nThe deal closes the book on a yearslong effort to transform the aging property into a residential neighborhood, as the entitled site will be redeveloped into over 400 homes.\nA Lennar spokesperson\ndeclined to comment\non the sale to the Orange County Business Journal, but IRA Capital officials confirmed that Lennar will build homes on the site.\nBuilt in 1988, the campus once served as a high-end office complex, but demand never fully recovered after the pandemic.\nIrvine-based IRA bought it in 2023 for $102.4 million from EQ Office, a Chicago unit of New York-based Blackstone. At the time, Kasm told the\nBusiness Journal\n: \u201cThe value of this property is in the land.\u201d\nInitial plans called for an industrial redevelopment. City officials later urged IRA to pivot toward housing as Irvine faced mounting state housing mandates.\nThe city conditionally offered to buy the site for more than $300 million if housing failed to materialize \u2014 a backstop that helped ensure a residential outcome. Ultimately, IRA secured entitlements for 426 homes, including detached houses, townhomes and stacked flats, in what IRA said was an unusually fast approval process.\nIrvine Mayor Larry Agran called the project a step forward in the city\u2019s long-term vision for the business complex, which was rezoned to allow up to 15,000 homes.\nConstruction is expected to begin within months, with completion targeted in 18 to 24 months.\nThe joint venture\u2019s purchase ranks among the most expensive single-property deals in Orange County in recent times. Five Point Holdings sold 326 home sites in Great Park Neighborhoods during the third quarter of 2025,\nfor $257.7 million\n. In April, Miami-based Crescent Heights\npaid $240 million\nfor Essex Property Trust\u2019s 350-unit Skyline at MacArthur Place in Santa Ana, per Commercial Observer.\n\u2014\nLauren Elkies Schram\n",

        "content": "The prospect of builder\u2019s remedy could return to San Francisco, and one prominent city official wants to get ahead of the possibility by dedicating more funding and land to residential development if necessary.\nSupervisor Chyanne Chen, one of 11 members of the Board of Supervisors, which functions as the legislative body for the city, recently called for an audit of where the city stands on its goals for affordable housing, the\nSan Francisco Business Times reported\n. Inherent in the request is a check-up on whether the city is in line to meet the state-imposed mandate of 47,000 new units of housing by 2031. Missing the mandate, known as the \u201chousing element,\u201d would\ntrigger builder\u2019s remedy\n, which allows developers to skip local zoning approvals provided they include a certain amount of affordable housing in their projects.\nChen said the city\u2019s funds for affordable housing are largely committed or exhausted and noted the cuts to the minimum requirements on how many affordable units must be included in new projects have reduced affordable housing production. A cut in fees has, meanwhile, put a dent in funding, she said.\nChen called for the city to gauge where it stands on meeting its goals under the housing element as the Family Zoning Plan initiated by Mayor Daniel Lurie starts to take effect. The plan would allow significantly more residential development in designated areas of the city, but faces legal challenges.\nPlanning Director Sarah Dennis-Phillips said city staff will report on Chen\u2019s request by the end of the month, with a hearing\u00a0 to review production and funding levels slated for March.\nA recent report by the city noted that the rise in interest rates in recent years and increases in construction costs have put a damper on the development of affordable housing. The city also faces a $1 billion budget deficit.\nChen said the plan San Francisco devised to meet its state mandate on housing included more than 200 policies billed as \u201cadvancing equity\u201d and boosting \u201cpublic investment in affordable units,\u201d but is failing to make full use of them.\n\u201cI am disappointed to see that implementation of these equity-oriented policy actions has been incomplete, opaque and often delayed,\u201d Chen told the Business Times.\n\u2014 Jerry Sullivan\n",

The Chicago Tribune\nreported\nthat they\u2019re now trying to offload their longtime perch atop One Magnificent Mile, listing their 46th-floor penthouse at 950 North Michigan Avenue for $5.5 million after a recent price cut.\nThe Bayers first listed the six-bedroom, roughly 9,000-square-foot duplex penthouse in September for just under $6 million before trimming the asking price in January. The unit carries monthly homeowners association dues of $12,081.\nDesigned by Wheeler Kearns Architects, the condo has seven-inch-wide European white oak floors, Grigio Piesantina limestone, a Crestron lighting system and a sculptural staircase framed by floor-to-ceiling windows, according to the outlet. The great room includes a custom burl wood wet bar and glass wine room, opening to a private terrace. The Valcucine kitchen is outfitted with Sub-Zero and Miele appliances.\nUpstairs, a second-level \u201cwellness and entertainment sanctuary\u201d features a sunroom with a marble-clad wet bar. The primary suite includes a sitting area and two custom walk-in closets. In total, the home has eight full bathrooms and three half baths.\nRyan Preuett and Tim Salm\nof Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty have the listing. The pair also represented the sellers of the Dickens Avenue mansion. It closed at $14.25 million, or about $950 per square foot. The previous owners \u2014 retired Chicago Trading Company executive Paul Kepes and his wife Monica \u2014 spent $20 million to buy the land and build the Lincoln Park property.\nSusan Miner of Premiere Relocation represented the Bayers in that purchase. At the time, the home\u2019s $15 million list price made it the second priciest listing in the city, following a Park Tower penthouse owned by billionaire\nKen Griffin\nlisted at $15.75 million.\nThe couple assembled their\nStreeterville duplex penthouse\nin stages between 2010 and 2014, a period when ultra-luxury condo development along North Michigan Avenue was still regaining its footing post-recession.

The commercial mortgage-backed securities debt totaled $36.5 million when originated a decade ago but has a current balance of about $33 million via three loan pieces. The borrower reached out to lenders to pay the debt, according to recent servicer commentary, but indicated there could be a potential issue as a new loan would fall significantly short.\nJade\u2019s latest Los Angeles time bomb at 1950 Sawtelle Boulevard is a three-story, 100,000-square-foot, red-brick building \u2014 and it has a vacancy problem. The property was only 43 percent occupied last summer. Its largest tenant, Butterfield Productions, reduced its space by 10 percent, to 32 percent of the gross leasable area, and another Kung Fu Factory left, leaving 14 percent of the space vacant, according to Morningstar. The borrower said it was in discussions with a tenant for a large portion of the vacant space, recent servicer commentary noted . The office building (that can be used for medical or some retail, per a recent JLL marketing brochure) was 94 percent occupied at underwriting, and it was part of a portfolio buy in 2016.\nJade\npurchased\na five-office building portfolio including the Sawtelle property that totaled 350,000 square feet, from Blackstone for a reported $159 million then. The other offices were all on the Westside, in Beverly Hills, Santa Monica and Culver City. The Sawtelle office building hasn\u2019t received a fresh appraisal since 2016, when it was worth $54 million, per Morningstar.\nDowntown Los Angeles-based Jade Enterprises has seen its fair share of post-pandemic office distress. In 2024, it put a mostly vacant office tower in downtown Los Angeles on the\nmarket\nafter purchasing it for $80 million and spending millions more on renovations. Last year, the investment and development company\nfaced\nforeclosure on an office building in Pasadena after a $40 million debt default and an appraisal that slashed the property value in half.\nJade Enterprises and Taban did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "A planned 1 million-square-foot ICE detention hub in southern Dallas County is off the table for now.\nMajestic Realty Company said Monday it will not sell or lease its Hutchins warehouse to the federal government, backing away from discussions that would have converted the property into one of the largest migrant detention centers in the country,\naccording\nto the Dallas Morning News.\n\u201cGod answered our prayers,\u201d Hutchins Mayor Mario Vasquez told the outlet after learning of the decision.\nU.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, who represents the congressional district that includes Hutchins, released a statement that her office had not received communication from the Department of Homeland Security or ICE regarding the detention center, but that her office has remained in close contact with city officials and other regional elected officials \u201cto ensure a unified and informed response.\u201d\nInternal ICE documents had identified the Majestic-owned PointSouth Logistics &amp; Commerce Centre Building 1, at 950\nI-45 North\n, as a candidate to house up to 9,500 migrants as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s renewed mass deportation push. The facility was one of four proposed new detention centers in Texas, alongside sites in El Paso and San Antonio that the Department of Homeland Security has already acquired, according to the publication.\nIn January,\nmultiple outlets reported\nthat DHS had purchased the Hutchins warehouse with plans to retrofit it for detention use. Majestic pushed back this week, saying it had been contacted about a potential sale but \u201chas not and will not\u201d enter into an agreement with DHS for use as a detention facility. The City of Industry, California-based firm confirmed it still owns the building.\nA Majestic Realty listing for the address shows a building of just over 1 million square feet, aligning with earlier descriptions. The Dallas Central Appraisal District values the property at $80.1 million.\nThe reversal highlights the political and reputational tightrope\nindustrial landlords\nface, as federal agencies look to repurpose big-box logistics space for nontraditional uses. A document from the project\u2019s builder shows the warehouse was originally designed for Amazon. Vasquez said he warned the company that turning the property into a detention center would \u201cdevastate\u201d Hutchins, a small city that has leaned on warehouse development for tax base growth.\nMajestic framed its decision as part of a broader economic strategy, saying it looks forward to finding a buyer or tenant that will \u201chelp drive economic growth.\u201d The firm is one of the largest privately held developers of master-planned business parks in the U.S., with more than 400 buildings totaling about 92 million square feet nationwide. In North Texas, it\u2019s perhaps best known for its role in redeveloping the\nFort Worth Stockyards\n.\nCommunity opposition also played a role. Local leaders warned that Hutchins lacks the water and sewer capacity to support what would effectively double its population overnight, as previously reported in\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe Rev. Eric Folkerth of Kessler Park United Methodist Church told the Dallas Morning News that local pressure and outrage likely influenced the outcome, questioning the need for a \u201cmega center\u201d amid reports that thousands without criminal records would be detained at the site.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "To plug a more than $5 billion budget gap, Mayor Zohran Mamdani sees two options: Either raise taxes on corporations and New York\u2019s wealthiest or increase property taxes by 9.5 percent while tapping into the city\u2019s reserves.\nGov. Kathy Hochul has rejected the former, which requires state action, and the latter, which Mamdani unveiled Tuesday as part of his administration\u2019s preliminary budget, swiftly drew criticism from landlord groups.\n\u201cThis proposal, coupled with Mamdani\u2019s pledge to freeze rents for four years, virtually guarantees the physical destruction of tens of thousands of units of housing,\u201d Kenny Burgos, CEO of the New York Apartment Association, said in a statement.\nJim Whelan, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, said \u201ctax hikes of any kind, including increases to an already egregiously regressive property tax system, to raise revenue or plug budget holes is a non-starter.\u201d\nAnn Korchak, board president of Small Property Owners of New York, said that owners of small rental properties \u201care sick and tired of being treated like ATM machines every time the city needs to balance the budget.\u201d\nWhen presenting his $127 billion preliminary budget, the mayor said that his administration will do everything in its power to avoid the second path, calling raising property taxes the \u201ctool of very last resort.\u201d\n\u201cThe second path is painful,\u201d Mamdani said on Tuesday. \u201cWe will continue to work with Albany to avoid it.\u201d\nHochul didn\u2019t include the mayor\u2019s proposal to increase taxes on corporations or those earning more than $1 million in her own executive budget, and hasn\u2019t shown any appetite for taking up either cause. On Tuesday, she told reporters that she also doesn\u2019t support raising property taxes.\nThe city\u2019s property tax rates ranged from 10.8 to 19.8 percent in fiscal year 2026. The administration estimates that a 9.5 percent increase across the city\u2019s four property classes will increase revenues by $3.7 billion in the next fiscal year.\nThe prospect of property tax hikes comes after Hochul and Mamdani announced on Monday that the state would allocate another $1.5 billion to the city over the next two years, $510 million of which is recurring funding stemming from costs that had shifted from the state to the city in previous years.\nBut that still left the city with an estimated $5.4 billion deficit for fiscal years 2026 and 2027.\nThe mayor\u2019s preliminary budget dips into the city\u2019s rainy day fund, taking $980 million in fiscal year 2026 and $229 million from the city\u2019s Retiree Health Benefit Trust in fiscal year 2027. Taking into account $1.2 billion in general reserves used to bring down the deficit, along with the $980 million in rainy day funds targeted by the mayor\u2019s budget, the city expects to log $6.3 billion in reserves for fiscal 2026, down from a reserve originally pegged at $8.5 billion. For 2027, again accounting for general reserves ($1.1 billion, leaving only $100 million for in-year funds) and a planned raid of the retiree trust, that number is expected to drop to $6.1 billion.\nUsing reserves is a one-time fix that leaves the city with a smaller cushion in the event of recession or other crises. The mayor indicated that the rainy day fund and retiree trust would be replenished by fiscal year 2028, though doing so could be complicated by future economic pressures.\n\u201cAssuming the city will replenish the funds in FY28, when the budget shows a $6.7 billion gap, is at best extremely tenuous and at worst a gamble,\u201d Andrew Rein, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, said in a statement.\nEven as he laid out the possibility of raising property taxes, Mamdani reiterated that his administration plans to send Albany a proposal to reform the city\u2019s property tax system in the next few weeks. Sherif Soliman, director of the mayor\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, said the proposed bill would build on the recommendations laid out in the 2021 report by the city\u2019s Advisory Commission on Property Tax Reform. He noted the commission\u2019s recommendation to eliminate assessed value growth caps and use sales-based market value to assess condos and co-ops.\nThe mayor also reiterated that the plan is not final.\nCity Council leadership believes there are additional areas of savings and revenue \u201cthat deserve careful scrutiny\u201d before increasing property taxes.\n\u201cAt a time when New Yorkers are already grappling with an affordability crisis, dipping into rainy day reserves and proposing significant property tax increases should not be on the table whatsoever,\u201d Speaker Julie Menin and Council member Linda Lee, chair of the Committee on Finance, said in a joint statement.\nComptroller Mark Levine also said the city needs to search for other sources of savings, indicating that the mayor\u2019s plan might not be enough to bridge the budget gap because it assumes \u201can aggressive revenue projection,\u201d and presumes that the city will not move forward with the\nplanned expansion\nof CityFHEPS rental assistance.\n\u201cDrawing down reserves during a period of economic growth would leave us vulnerable to economic turbulence next year,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "Legion Investment Group and Nahla Capital\u2019s Upper East Side development snagged the two priciest deals inked in Manhattan last week.\nThe condos at 1122 Madison Avenue topped a busy period for the borough\u2019s luxury market, where buyers signed 31 contracts for properties asking $4 million or more between Feb. 9 and Feb. 15, according to Olshan Realty\u2019s report. The total followed\nanother banner week\n, during which 36 luxury Manhattan homes entered contract, including 13 properties asking $10 million or more.\nThe most expensive unit to land an inked deal was the 18th floor of the 26-unit development, which had an asking price of $39 million. The apartment spans 5,300 square feet and has five bedrooms and five bathrooms. It also features two balconies, 11-foot ceilings and views of Central Park.\nThe building\u2019s 16th floor, asking $36.5 million, snagged the No. 2 spot in the report. The unit\u2019s layout is similar to the 18th floor, though its two balconies total more than 170 square feet instead of 150 square feet.\nThe developers launched sales at the building last month with a team from Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, led by Cathy Franklin, and have already found buyers for 16 condos. Just a week into selling, the development\nnabbed the top spot\nin Olshan\u2019s weekly report when a buyer signed a contract to purchase Unit 11 North, which was asking just under $15 million.\nLegion and Nahla shelled out $95 million between 2019 and early 2024 to assemble six parcels for the development site. The duo scored\n$195 million\nin construction financing from Deutsche Bank JVP Management in August 2024.\nThe building\u2019s planned amenities include a fitness center with a squash court, cold plunge pool and sauna, as well as a bar, media room and billiards room. Construction is expected to be completed in the fall of 2027.\nThe 1122 Madison condos aren\u2019t Legion\u2019s first rodeo on the Upper East Side. The firm also developed 109 East 79th Street, which marked its founder and CEO Victor Sigoura\u2019s\nfirst major Manhattan project\nafter he left his executive post at Naftali Group in 2016. A penthouse at the development sold to investment banker Joseph Rallo and his wife, Ashley, for\n$25 million\nin 2023.\nDown in Miami Beach, Nahla, led by Genghis Hadi, paid $270 million to buy the\nRaleigh Rosewood Residences\nfrom its former development team led by Michael Shvo. Its other New York-based projects have included 221 West 77th Street and 152 Elizabeth Street.\n",

The\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n, which is compiled by\nEklund Gomes\n\u2019 Marcy Roth, counts properties listed for $4 million or more in the Multiple Listing Service.\nThe asking price for the home at 10444 Charing Cross Road equates to $1,753 per square foot and was first listed in February 2025 for $18.5 million, or $2,002 per square foot. Since then, it\u2019s been taken off and put back on the market, reappearing with new pricing.\nThe six-bedroom, eight-bathroom home is over 9,200 square feet, with a theater, a gym, an elevator, two laundry rooms and a wine cellar.\nProperty records show the seller is a limited partnership that counts as a partner Michael Shore, an attorney in Beverly Hills. The LP purchased the property in 2022 for $6.5 million, or $703 per square foot.\nLaura Brau of Compass holds the listing.\nLast week also saw 1520 Carla Ridge in Beverly Hills go into contract to make for the seven-day period\u2019s next priciest pending deal based on listing price.\nLocated in Trousdale Estates, the roughly 7,300-square-foot home has five beds and six baths, with an asking price just under $15 million, or $2,053 per square foot. Built in 2020, the residence sits on nearly half an acre.\nThe property has been on the market since August 2024, first hanging up the for-sale sign with a nearly $23 million asking price. The home has since seen several price reductions and was also listed for rent last May for $85,000 per month.\nThe seller is Kentaro Abe, a trustee for the P&amp;G Trust, according to property records.\nNicholas Property Group\u2019s Dustin Nicholas is the listing agent.\nThe Westwood and Beverly Hills properties were two of 16 homes that went into contract last week, amounting to $122.2 million in asking volume.\nThat activity represented nine fewer signed contracts and about 39 percent less in asking volume compared to a year earlier, according to the Eklund Gomes report.\nOne point to consider when factoring in the year-ago comparisons is the Los Angeles residential market is now lapping the post-Palisades and Eaton fires time period, which saw a significant increase in both leasing and sales activity as impacted homeowners scrambled for temporary or new housing.\n",

One of the suits is against CTBC Bank, which holds the loan on the apartment complex.\nCTBC Bank is seeking to take the property through foreclosure in weeks or months, with timing likely to be subject to rulings in the bankruptcy case and a separate legal action in Santa Clara County court.\nThe Neo isn\u2019t the only multifamily development in downtown San Jose in distress. A lender foreclosed on a 336-unit complex called The Fay last month over a\n$182.5 million construction loan\n.\nThat deal also pointed to a gap between debt levels and property values, with the lender claiming the Fay was worth $110 million. The Fay stood out on San Jose\u2019s skyline at 23 stories, and bought an upscale entry to the boundary between downtown and the city\u2019s SoFa district.\nU.K.-based developer Scape paid $16.5 million for the parcel for The Fay and took the $182.5 million construction loan for the project from an affiliate of Madison Capital Realty, which had foreclosed on it.\n",

        "content": "Texas thawed this month, but the ultra-luxury market remains cold.\nLast week, the first sale of the top 10 most expensive homes listed in Texas in January closed: a spec mansion at 4527 North Lindhurst Avenue in Dallas, asking $8.3 million at the time of sale, according to public records and the Houston Association of Realtors.\nIt was the least expensive of January\u2019s top 10 homes on HAR\u2019s monthly ranking, which covers the major metro areas of the state. A Highland Park home at\n3711 Lexington Avenue\nin Dallas led the ranking with an asking price of $29.9 million.\nSeller Bart Plaskoff, president of Summit Trucking and an\noccasional real estate developer\n, originally listed the Lindhurst Avenue home for $12 million in April 2024, according to Zillow. The low-slung contemporary mansion spans over 8,800 square feet on a 0.8-acre lot, with five bedrooms and eight bathrooms. Amenities include a sauna, pool and fire pit.\nCompass agents Julie Provenanzo and Meridith Hayes had the listing. Fellow Compass agent Stanley Williams represented the buyer, Kenneth Willey. The purchase was finalized on Feb. 12, according to public records.\nThe seller lowered the price gradually throughout 2025, delisting and relisting the home, before settling at an asking price of $8.3 million in January. The final sale price is not disclosed.\nThe most expensive listings of January include\na large share of relistings\n, many with significant discounts. The 20,500-square-foot Lexington Avenue home at the top of the list was asking\n$36.5 million last summer\n; today, it\u2019s asking $29.9 million. The second-most expensive listing of January, a Preston Hollow home owned by the founder of Cinemark, listed last September for\n$22 million\n; today, it\u2019s asking $18 million. Coming in third place, the home at 603 West Friar Tuck Lane in Houston hit the market with an asking price of $20 million in June. Today, it\u2019s asking $14 million.\nIn addition to his spec mansion enterprise, Plaskoff has undertaken community-scale development projects through his company, Jobar Development. Jobar floated a\n1,400-unit mixed-use development in Oak Cliff to city authorities in 2024\n, but the project\u2019s future is uncertain. The company sold the land to JMR Investments Group last February, public records show.\n",

The units are at the center of an\nownership dispute\nbetween\nHarry Macklowe\nand\nCIM Group\n, which is tied to the selling entity. Macklowe had lost the condos last year when he defaulted on the mortgages he took out from CIM to buy the units. The developer paid about $47 million for the units along with a smaller pad on the 28th floor, which is not included in the latest sale.\nSerhant\u2019s Glenn Davis\nand\nNicholas Compagnone\nhad the off-market listing. The buyer was\n78 Purchaser LLC.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nSoho had the top commercial deal to hit records, with the sale of the Nomo Soho Hotel at\n9 Crosby Street\nfor $121 million. The seller was\nAlex Sapir\u2019s\nv\nSapir Organization\n, which had purchased the more than 121,000-square-foot, 26-story property in 2015 for $200 million via a foreclosure sale.

The seller,\nRidgewood 57 II LLC\n, purchased the five-bedroom pad in 2023 for $13.5 million. It went back on the market nearly a year later, with an asking price of $17.5 million. Corcoran\u2019s\nCarrie Chiang\nand\nAndres Perea-Garzon\nhad the listing. The buyer in the latest sale was\nVision Start VIII, LLC.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nIn Lenox Hill,\nMichael L.

Spanning 6,000 square feet, the residence has five bedrooms, access to the secluded Jones Wood Garden, a gym, a multipurpose room and an elevator. It first hit the market in 2022 for just under $14 million; its most recent asking price was just under $12 million.

        "content": "Christine Quinn\u2019s nonprofit released an\nanalysis\nshowing CityFHEPS rental voucher expansion would save $635 million, contrary to a\nfinding\nby the Citizens Budget Commission.\nBut consider the source: Quinn\u2019s mission is to help the homeless, so it\u2019s no surprise that her study concluded that giving them vouchers saves the city money.\nThe budget group\u2019s agenda is fiscal prudence. If vouchers saved money, the CBC would have every incentive to endorse issuing more of them.\nInstead it found that \u201cshort-term savings are fleeting and vouchers cost more than shelter over time.\u201d\n\u201cRental housing vouchers require substantial subsidy and have not reduced the demand for shelter,\u201d the commission wrote. \u201cThe city cannot voucher its way out of the housing affordability crisis.\u201d\nA CityFHEPS voucher costs $54.80 per day. Shelters cost $144 for an individual and $270 for a family. But voucher payments run for five years or more. The average shelter stay is 15 months.\nAlso, the state and federal governments contribute to shelter costs, while the city pays for CityFHEPS on its own.\nQuinn\u2019s nonprofit, WIN, doesn\u2019t want families to spend 15 months in shelters. That likely influenced its decision to use a methodology that showed vouchers save money.\nWIN claims that CBC didn\u2019t account for people returning to shelters, which WIN says vouchers would reduce. CBC says it did account for that.\nI didn\u2019t get into the weeds on their math, but shelter population counts suggest that CBC is right: As the city handed out lots more vouchers in the past two years, the\nshelter head count\ndid not go down. It went up \u2014 even with the migrant surge ending.\nOver that time, the number of single adults in shelters rose by 22 percent. The small number of adult couples in shelters remained flat.\nThe families-with-children shelter population has dropped by 10 percent since January 2024, but largely because migrants stopped arriving. The family shelter head count has more than doubled since January 2022, even as voucher funding increased\nnearly sevenfold\n.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhen the House passed the Housing in the 21st Century Act\n390-9\non Feb. 9, one of the \u201cnay\u201d votes came from California, the state with the most acute housing shortage. It was cast by Republican Tom McClintock. Three Arizona representatives also voted against it. Lizzie Fletcher of Houston was the only Democrat to oppose\nthe bill\n. Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Compass has rolled out a\n$225 fee\npaid by the buyer or seller at every closing, which has upset some of the brokerage\u2019s agents \u2014 as have some other upcharges that Compass is testing. Share your comments with residential reporter Jake Indursky:\njacob.indursky@therealdeal.com\n.\nElsewhere\u2026\nIs earthquake evacuation a legitimate reason to oppose residential development? Earthquakes are unpredictable and last an average of 12 seconds, which doesn\u2019t provide much opportunity to evacuate. But that didn\u2019t stop a\nNIMBY group\nin Los Angeles County from writing in a newsletter to its members, \u201cWind driven fires, earthquakes and floods happen without warning. Are we prepared to handle evacuation of our neighborhoods as more housing is being built?\u201d Locals are\nfighting plans\nto redevelop part of a Woodland Hills golf course.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$52.5 million\nfor 432 Park Avenue, 78A/B.

        "content": "Two South Beach condo association employees were arrested over a kickback scheme that partly hinged on 40-year\nrecertification\nwork for the aging building, according to prosecutors.\nEuclid East Condominium\u2019s property manager Francisco Obispo, 38, was charged with one count of organized scheme to defraud and 18 counts of receiving a kickback. A maintenance worker, Jose Luis Hernandez-Aguiar, 52, was charged with one count of organized scheme to defraud.\nThe six-story, 57-unit building at 1545 Euclid Avenue was built in 1967.\nA Miami-Dade State Attorney\u2019s investigator started poking around in June, after a former board member pointed out financial discrepancies, including payments from the association to JLH Repair, a company registered to Hernandez. A review of financial records, including bank records obtained through a subpoena of JLH, showed that the alleged scheme capitalized on Euclid East\u2019s impending 40-year recertification.\nFlorida and Miami-Dade County tightened its structural integrity and recertification requirements after the 2021 Surfside condo collapse, imposing recertifications at the 30-year mark and every 10 years thereafter. The rules are stricter for buildings near the coast.\nThe Euclid East association paid JLH $25,000 for permit processing for the recertification, though the city of Miami Beach had no record of JLH pulling permits, according to the arrest warrant. JLH also received $24,500 for pulling recertification electrical permits, but the city had no record of JLH applying for or securing the permits, the warrant says.\nAround the time JLH received payments from the association, it cut checks to Obispo and a company registered in his name, Skyline Management Solutions, bank records allegedly showed.\nThe investigator tracked 18 money transfers, including nearly $200,000 allegedly paid from the association to JLH, with $66,100 of that allegedly transferred to Obispo. Another firm, led by a man who identified himself as the licensed contractor retained by JLH to pull permits for Euclid East, received $61,800 from the association, with $29,400 then transferred to Obispo, according to the warrant.\nObispo told the investigator he received nothing of value from Hernandez.\nEuclid East employed Obispo and Hernandez through a condo management company. Hernandez, the maintenance worker, was later switched to a direct employee of the association around the time Obispo, the property manager, was assigned to Euclid East in 2024, the arrest warrant states.\n\u201c[We] scratched our head, going where did this come from,\u201d a board member told the investigator, according to the warrant. \u201cNobody talked to us about it. One minute he\u2019s the janitor, the next thing you know, he\u2019s running $500,000 in construction projects.\u201d\nHernandez\u2019s bond was set at $15,000, and Obispo\u2019s at $105,000. They could not be reached for comment.\nThe arrests mark the latest incident in a string of alleged\nfraudulent dealings\nby condo association staff members.\u00a0Residents living in communities governed by condo or homeowners associations across South Florida have accused board members of\nwrongdoing\n, from diverting funds to themselves to election fraud and bullying of those who spoke out.

It\u2019s new digs? Business-friendly Miami.\nThe publicly traded AI software firm, led by Alex Karp, said in a brief X post on Tuesday that it moved its headquarters from Denver to Miami, the Denver Post\nreported\n.\nThe firm, with a market value of $312.2 billion and about 4,000 employees, hasn\u2019t announced its office location.\nThe planned move aligns with Miami\u2019s yearslong effort to become a magnet for tech firms and gives a boost to the city\u2019s push to grow its AI sector.\nThe company has faced regulatory and political headwinds in Colorado.\nPalantir has faced protests in Denver partly due to its work using AI to aid Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportations.\nA Colorado law will take effect in June creating more stringent regulation for data mining and predictive tools, though it didn\u2019t target Palantir directly.\nIn its move to Miami, Palantir is following the footsteps of its co-founder and board chair Peter Thiel, whose San Francisco-based venture capital firm Founders Fund opened a Miami office in 2021, first in\nBrickell\nand then moved to\nWynwood\n. His Los Angeles-based Thiel Capital investment firm opened a Miami office last year.\nPalantir isn\u2019t the only one opting for a Miami headquarters.\nPrivate equity firm Trinity Investments moved its headquarters to Miami from Honolulu; Canadian waste management firm GFL Environmental moved to Miami Beach from Vaughan, Ontario; and Danish retailer Danish Flying Tiger Copenhagen announced it will open its Americas administrative base at Miami Beach\u2019s Lincoln Road.\nTrinity, founded in 1996 and led by Sean Hehir, kept a Honolulu office and also has outposts in\u00a0 Los Angeles and London, a company news release states. Its recent investments include the 240-key The Hoxton, Poblenou hotel in Barcelona, and the 450-room Fairmont Olympic Hotel in downtown Seattle.\nIt leased\n3,000 square feet\nat Comras Company\u2019s The Canopy Offices at 2982 Grand Avenue in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove neighborhood.\nIn South Florida, Trinity, in partnership with Credit Suisse Asset Management, owns the 1,000-key oceanfront Diplomat Beach Resort in Hollywood.

Buyers will have the option to occupy, lease or resell their units.\nFour West plans to market the suites to small business owners and commercial investors priced out of office submarkets in\nAventura\nand Miami, the release states.\nFortune Development Sales, the brokerage arm of Edgardo Defortuna\u2019s Fortune International Group, is handling marketing and sales.\nFour West paid $8 million for the development site in 2024, records show. The developer plans to begin construction later this year.\nThe project\u2019s 18,000 square feet of amenities will include a terrace with pickleball and padel courts, a social lounge, and a fitness center with a cold plunge pool, sauna and studio. It will also have 18,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space.\nBroward\u2019s office vacancy rate hit the mid-teens at the end of last year, according to Newmark. Average asking rents pushed into the low $40s per square foot, cheaper than Miami-Dade but high enough that some smaller users are looking for alternatives to traditional leases, Newmark found. Brokers say tenants are gravitating either to high-quality, amenity-rich buildings or deeply discounted second-tier spaces.\nChaberman is an active developer in Hallandale Beach. His other firm, Kadima Developers, is planning\nSeven Park\n, a $70 million, eight-story mixed-use project with 121 condos and 4,500 square feet of ground-floor retail. Kadima purchased 12.2 vacant acres around the Big Easy Casino at 831 North Federal Highway for\n$31.1 million\nin December.

The loan will fund Marquette\u2019s Union Villa Park development at 110 South Villa Avenue in Villa Park, Illinois, which will include 238 apartments consisting of studios, two and three-bedroom units, as well as 8,000 square feet of commercial space. MetLife is serving as an equity partner in the project which is expected to cost $90 million, a release from Marquette shows.\nThe village of Villa Park approved an incentive agreement with Marquette for the development in 2025 that includes a garage with 94 parking spaces open to the public, The Daily Herald reported.\nThe financing follows a trend of lenders feeling more confident in non-Cook County suburbs than in the city of Chicago. Early last year, suburban apartment building sales between $1 million and $50 million\njumped 65 percent, year-over-year\n, Interra Realty found. The brokerage, which specializes in midsize deals, found that 53 midsize apartment buildings sold between March 2024 and March 2025, compared to 32 sold between March 2023 and March 2024.\nSince last year, investing activity continues to hold strong.

Tension over property tax adjustments in the wake of the pandemic have led to\na contentious race\nfor Cook County Tax Assessor, with donations from the real estate community flooding into Democratic Primary challenger Patrick Hynes\u2019 campaign.\nStill, activity is hardly at a standstill in Chicago.

        "content": "The \u201ctake your licks until 2026\u201d mantra has officially expired for the owners of the\nEmbassy Suites by Hilton hotel in Lombard\n, as they\u2019re still feeling the post-pandemic pain of depressed commercial real estate values.\nMonths after the 263-key hotel slipped into distress, a group of lenders steered by special servicer KeyBank are moving to strip operational control from its landlord, a joint venture of Corona del Mar, California-based Seaview Investors and San Diego-based Chelsea Hospitality Partners. The lenders asked a DuPage County judge to appoint Jeff Kolessar of GF Hotels &amp; Resorts as receiver to manage the property amid a $24 million foreclosure lawsuit, with a hearing set for March 3, public records show.\nThe move signals a cold reality for suburban hotel owners: Even as downtown Chicago hotels enjoyed a summer of 2019-level revenue, the suburbs remain a landscape of steep haircuts and aggressive foreclosures.\nThe lawsuit highlights a ballooning debt stack for the hotel. While the principal sits at $21.5 million, the bill has been padded by $1.6 million in default interest, $576,000 in deferred interest and various late fees.\nThe lender, a consortium of investors that bought the debt after it originated in 2019 as part of a commercial mortgage-backed securities deal, alleged the Seaview and Chelsea venture defaulted by failing to repay the loan upon its summertime maturity date last year. The landlords previously indicated they wouldn\u2019t try to refinance the property to save the deal, an acknowledgment of its value sliding too far since the loan origination before the pandemic.\nNow, the owners signed a pre-negotiation agreement with the lender and are \u201cengaged in discussions regarding possible exit strategies,\u201d according to KeyBank. \u201cThe special servicer continues to assess all options to maximize recoveries,\u201d it said last month in a report on the deal.\nThe lender is also seeking permission to fast-track $200,000 to $300,000 in tenant improvements without court oversight \u2014 a sign the group of banks that hold the note are already prepping the hotel for a post-foreclosure life.\nIf appointed, GF Hotels affiliate LOIL Associates would manage the property for $7,000 a month or 3 percent of gross revenue, whichever is higher, according to legal documents.\nStill, the Lombard Embassy Suites deal remains profitable on paper. The property has had no trouble bringing in enough revenue to cover its debt service costs, loan data shows, as it generated over $11.4 million for the 12-month period ending in March of last year, with expenses of just under $8 million and debt service costs of $2.4 million, leaving a roughly $1 million cushion.\nThe legal pressure extends beyond the real estate. The loan was guaranteed by trusts tied to hospitality industry veterans Robert Alter and Gary Stougaard, who have ties to Seaview. Their trusts were required to maintain a combined net worth of at least $35 million. So far, the borrowers haven\u2019t indicated they will fight the receivership.\nNeither Seaview nor an attorney for KeyBank returned requests for comment.\nThe Lombard case is the latest data point in a harrowing Chicagoland hospitality market. Suburban properties are especially desperate, as business travel and corporate visits to office campuses stay muted, while workspace vacancy hovers at a record high of over 30 percent in the suburbs.\nLast year, a\n318-key Crowne Plaza hotel in Northbrook sold out of foreclosure\nfor just $6.5 million, a 50 percent discount from its last purchase price in 2021, and the former\nTremont Hotel in Chicago\u2019s Gold Coast fetched just $13 million\nafter a stint as a shelter and a foreclosure dispute. Locally based investor Parag Patel has bought multiple properties at steep bargains in both the city and suburbs, including the Aloft Bolingbrook property he bought out of foreclosure, making him a potential candidate to buy the nearby Lombard Embassy Suites grappling with distress.\nYet, the pain is climbing into bigger hotel deals, too. Just blocks from the renowned Magnificent Mile,\nQuadrum Global\nis currently moving to foreclose on Oxford Capital\u2019s Godfrey Hotel in an $88 million debt dispute.",

He emphasized that the property is not zoned for detention and that, to the village\u2019s understanding, the space is being used for administrative purposes only.\n\u201cIt is not zoned for a detention facility,\u201d Herman said. \u201cIf they were to attempt to do so, it would be prohibited by our zoning.\u201d\nA\nprocessing and detention facility\nused by ICE and Customs and Border Protection already operates in\nBroadview\n, about six miles away.\nIn a statement to the broadcaster, DHS declined to confirm details about the Oak Brook site, saying: \u201cIs it really news that when a federal agency hires more personnel, that they need more space?\u201d The agency added that ICE plans to add 10,000 law enforcement professionals and cited an increase in threats against officers.\nLewis University said it hopes to continue using its Oak Brook classrooms as planned this semester, but has not made any decisions about its future lease.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A planned 402-acre Islamic-centered community northeast of Dallas is drawing fresh federal and state scrutiny, threatening to complicate one of the region\u2019s most ambitious master-planned projects.\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said Friday its Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity launched an investigation into EPIC Real Properties and Community Capital Partners over potential violations of the Fair Housing Act, including alleged religious and national origin discrimination tied to\nThe Meadow\n, formerly branded as EPIC City, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. EPIC stands for the East Plano Islamic Center.\nHUD said it received a complaint from the Texas Workforce Commission detailing a \u201clarge-scale pattern of religious discriminatory conduct.\u201d Among the allegations: marketing materials promoting the project as an exclusively Muslim community and \u201cthe epicenter of Islam in America,\u201d financial terms requiring lot owners to subsidize a mosque and Islamic educational centers, as well as a two-tier lottery system for lot sales that favored certain buyers, according to the outlet.\nHUD Secretary Scott Turner said the agency would ensure a \u201cthorough investigation so that this community is open to all Texans.\u201d\nCommunity Capital Partners, a for-profit development arm formed by members of the East Plano Islamic Center, denied discrimination claims and said it remains committed to complying with\nstate\nand\nfederal\nhousing laws. The group argues many of the issues raised were addressed in a prior settlement with the Texas Workforce Commission.\nThe\ndevelopment envisions\nmore than 1,000 homes, a K-12 faith-based school, mosque, senior housing, apartments, retail and sports fields across land in Collin and Hunt counties, roughly 40 miles from downtown Dallas.\nAt the same time, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton\nfiled a separate lawsuit\nin Collin County, his agency announced Monday, targeting Double R Municipal Utility District No. 2A, accusing board members of improperly expanding the district\u2019s boundaries to support what he called the \u201cillegal\u201d EPIC project.\nMunicipal utility districts, authorized by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, are critical to financing infrastructure for large-scale residential developments. Developers front the costs, then recoup them through bond issuances repaid by property taxes within the district.\nPaxton alleges that in September, the Double R board was replaced at a rural meeting and quickly approved a petition to annex roughly 400 acres tied to The Meadow \u2014 despite questions about whether the new directors met statutory qualifications or even resided within the district. His office is seeking to block further district action and strip the project land from its boundaries.\nThe developer\u2019s attorney, Eric Hudson, called the suit the latest escalation in \u201clawfare\u201d by Paxton and Gov. Greg Abbott, arguing the district process has been handled by Texas law firm Winstead for 18 months and that technical issues will be resolved in court.\nThe project has already weathered a securities lawsuit from Paxton as well as a now-closed civil rights inquiry by the Justice Department.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The Houston suburb of Kingwood continues to attract the attention of\nmultifamily investors\nand developers after becoming the site of\nHigh Street Residential\n\u2019s first apartment development outside the city.\nSentinel Capital, which is based in Houston, purchased Elm Creek Apartments from HGA, a firm headquartered in Hamburg, Germany, according to a release from Berkadia, which arranged the deal. Berkadia\u2019s Chris Curry, Jeffrey Skipworth, Chris Young, Joey Rippel, Kyle Whitney and Jed Dalton marketed the property as part of a four-property portfolio, according to the brokerage.\nSentinel Capital borrowed $10.6 million from JLL Real Estate Capital for the purchase, loan documents show. Terms of the deal weren\u2019t disclosed, but the property was last valued for tax purposes at $14.5 million.\nElm Creek Apartments, at 2911 Sycamore Springs Drive, was built in 1982. The 168-unit property offers one- and two-bedroom garden-style apartments. The property has not been renovated, according to the release. Appraisal district records show the last remodel was in 2012.\nThe property is in\nKingwood\n, a master-planned community about 27 miles northeast of downtown Houston. Billed as \u201cThe Livable Forest,\u201d the 14,000-acre development was created in 1971 as a joint venture between Friendswood Development Company and King Ranch. Kingwood has a population of about 80,000 people.\nThe suburb has become a favorite of heavy-hitter developers like High Street Residential, an arm of Trammell Crow Company. The firm\npartnered with Japanese developer Daiwa House Group\nto develop two apartment communities: Residences at Kingwood, a 289-unit property at 6519 Kings Glen Drive, and Residences at Kingwood East, a 181-unit property at 6518 Kings Glen Drive. Residences at Kingwood was High Street Residential\u2019s first suburban Houston multifamily development.\nCaldwell Companies is building an \u201cactive adult\u201d community in the neighborhood, Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.

        "content": "Before the pandemic, generational wealth migration and the seemingly endless stream of headlines about Steve Ross transforming West Palm Beach, there was Jeff Greene.\nHe saw a diamond in the rough more than a decade ago.\n\u201cSitting in my private plane at the airport, it struck me that there were 300 to 400 other private jets there,\u201d he told\nThe Real Deal\nin a 2016 interview. \u201cHow can a city with this much wealth and education have so few amazing buildings, restaurants and hotels?\u201d\nThe billionaire real estate investor\nlaid out his plans\nfor reinventing the coastal city. By that point, he\u2019d amassed a 75-acre portfolio in West Palm Beach and was dreaming up apartments, condos, a hotel, an office tower, retail and a school.\nA decade later, West Palm is threatening Greene with\na $5 million fine if he doesn\u2019t finish\nhis premier mixed-use development soon. Earlier this month, the city commission certified an agreement with the developer that he will complete the two-tower, 30-story One West Palm by the end of 2027. Otherwise, he\u2019ll have to fork over the hefty late fee.\nGreene said he plans to complete One West Palm before the deadline.\nIt\u2019s a squeeze play for a city widely seen as a partner to the real estate industry and the titans who want to build in it. And it\u2019s in sharp contrast to\nRoss\n\u2019 gargantuan efforts, which have produced millions of square feet of office and apartment developments in the same amount of time.\nBut to Greene, his delays at One West Palm distract from his myriad of projects throughout West Palm and Palm Beach County.\n\u201cWe\u2019re building stuff all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone focuses on the one building that seems to be taking a very long time.\u201d\nRed light, Greene light\nGreene\u2019s vision for his West Palm Beach projects came together at a time of great personal change.\nIn 2009, Greene bought a 3.6-acre oceanfront Palm Beach estate for $24 million. Comparable properties today trade for more than $100 million, but that was long before the pandemic altered market dynamics on the island. He had married his wife Mei Sze Chan a few years earlier, and the couple had just welcomed their first child. In 2010, he launched an unsuccessful bid for U.S. Senate.\nBut his political ambitions were dogged by his past.\nHe is among the mythologized figures who had the prescience to bet against the housing market in the mid-aughts, a move that earned him an $800 million windfall when Wall Street came crashing down in 2008. A profile in\nForbes\nthat year titled \u201cThe Reluctant Billionaire\u201d elevated his reputation nationally, along with tales of his bachelor days in Beverly Hills. For years, most articles about Greene mentioned that his best man was Mike Tyson, that he partied with Paris Hilton and Lindsey Lohan, and that he hosted infamous Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss in his guest house for a year, describing her as a \u201cnice girl.\u201d\nIt didn\u2019t play well with voters, and he lost to his rival in the Democratic primary that year.\nBut Greene had other irons in the fire. He was quietly amassing a sprawling portfolio in Palm Beach County, banking property as South Florida crawled out of its post-financial crisis pit.\nHe bought an incomplete 548-unit apartment complex in West Palm Beach for $6.8 million in 2011 and finished construction of the complex in 2015. He bought the former Palm Beach Post Office for $3.7 million \u2013\u2013 which he sold later to the Breakers for\n$28 million\n. He bought the oceanfront Palm Beach resort now known as Tideline for $42 million.\nHe also snapped up hundreds of condos in newly completed buildings like\nthe Whitney\nat 410 Evernia Street, City Palms at 480 Hibiscus Street and the Strand at 255 Evernia Street. In 2015, he paid $24 million for a 3.3-acre parcel at 419 Lakeview Avenue, still a vacant lot with seasonal pumpkin and Christmas tree markets.\nGreene estimates his property holdings in the county are worth billions.\n\u201cI did buy an enormous amount of land,\u201d he said, adding he\u2019s been intentionally restrained in pacing his developments. \u201cIf I built it all at once, it would flood the market.\u201d\nThe sites that have made headlines recently are a 26-acre spread he acquired between 2012 and 2016 in West Palm\u2019s Currie Park Mixed Use District. It was during this time Greene paid $10 million for the 3.3-acre One West Palm development site at 550 North Quadrille Boulevard.\nDesigned by Arquitectonica, One West Palm is set to include 200,000 square feet of office space, 326 apartments, 201 hotel rooms and amenities like a fitness club, spa, movie theater, pools and indoor tennis courts.\nConstruction started in 2019, with the expectation it would be finished in 2022.\nBut Greene found himself bogged down in conflict from early days. He clashed with both the contractor and the city, and\nultimately fired Kast Construction\nfrom the project in 2024.\nWhile other developers have investors and lenders breathing down their necks when construction runs behind, the self-financing billionaire didn\u2019t \u201chave anyone to answer to,\u201d he said.\nWhile One West Palm faced delays, Greene was at work on another major two-tower development nearby. He announced plans for the Herzog &amp; de Meuron-designed project at 2175 and 2251 North Flagler Drive in 2023, touting the Swiss architecture firm as a major get for a maturing city. The 76-unit project is predicated on a 2021 upzoning of the Currie Park Mixed Use District.\nIt was the upzoning, which allowed Greene to build well beyond previously allowed height limits, that was targeted by the city this fall while he was attempting to get final approvals for the condos. A letter from Mayor Keith James stating the city would retract the height allowances prompted Greene to sue the city in October, alleging West Palm was improperly dragging out the approval process.\n\u201cIf this mayor wants me to just be a land banker and not build anything, I won\u2019t build anything,\u201d he said at the time.\nGreene cut a deal with the city, agreeing to the potential $5 million One West Palm penalty, while securing the height for his Herzog &amp; de Meuron condos. He also committed to a land swap and a $6 million payment to the city for the connection of Northwood Road and Currie Park.\nA decade in the making, Greene\u2019s vision for his West Palm portfolio hasn\u2019t totally materialized. He completed the 198-unit Brandon Estates apartment complex in 2024, and he\u2019s finished industrial projects farther inland. He also opened the Greene School in 2016, and it now runs from pre-K to 12th grade with\nan admissions waitlist\n.\nHe still needs to get the condos through final approval and One West Palm its certificate of occupancy. He\u2019s also working on Live Local projects in the city\u2019s downtown, a land donation to the proposed Vanderbilt University graduate campus, and plans for an 8.4-acre waterfront site on Flagler Drive. To him, timing is everything. And with\nso many other developers building\naround his sites, the timing seems better than ever.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of luck in real estate development. I\u2019m not stupid, I know you can be an idiot and make money in a great cycle, and you can be a genius and lose money in a bad cycle,\u201d he said. \u201cWe delayed [One West Palm] to get the perfect project, and just by luck, everything around it has blossomed.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A San Clemente-based housing developer has sued the trade group Orange County Realtors, accusing it of trying to block a $130 million senior housing project that already obtained city approvals.\nNick Buchanan, an infill developer based in San Clemente, plans to build a\n180-unit senior housing development\non a 4-acre shopping center he owns along La Paz Road in Laguna Hills. But Buchanan says the neighboring property owner \u2014 Orange County Realtors \u2014 has interfered with the project,\nforcing him to take legal action\n, according to the Orange County Business Journal.\nBuchanan\u2019s La Paz Village Investors filed a lawsuit Jan. 7 in Orange County Superior Court, alleging the trade group and its contractors conducted unauthorized construction on his property, including excavating asphalt, staging heavy equipment and blocking access to the shopping center, according to the complaint.\n\u201cThis was a project we tried very hard to work through collaboratively,\u201d Buchanan told the Business Journal. \u201cI just want to sit in a room with them and figure out how we move forward so we can build this important housing project.\u201d\nOrange County Realtors did not respond to the Business Journal\u2019s requests for comment.\nThe dispute centers on the redevelopment of La Paz Village, an aging retail center located just south of Interstate 5. Buchanan purchased the property in 2022 for $23.5 million and initially proposed townhomes before pivoting to senior housing. The five-story project would include independent living units, underground parking and amenities such as a gym, theater and rooftop deck, with 10 percent of units reserved for very low-income seniors.\nBuchanan used California\u2019s \u201cbuilder\u2019s remedy\u201d law to secure approvals after Laguna Hills was found out of compliance with state housing requirements. The Laguna Hills City Council approved the project in September, despite some opposition.\nAccording to Buchanan, Orange County Realtors owns the adjacent site and holds access easements across portions of the property. He said the group initially appeared open to the redevelopment but stopped communicating after construction activity escalated last fall.\n\u201cThey dug up our property without asking,\u201d Buchanan said. \u201cThat creates liability for us as a landlord.\u201d\nBuchanan said the lawsuit is aimed at clearing the way for construction to proceed.\n\u201cThis is exactly the kind of housing California says it wants,\u201d he said, with housing scarce across Southern California.\n\u2014\nLauren Elkies Schram\n",

        "content": "Mayor Zohran Mamdani named five new members to the city\u2019s Rent Guidelines Board, meaning the mayor\u2019s appointees make up a majority of the body as he calls for freezing rents for stabilized apartments.\nMamdani announced Wednesday that he tapped Chatnella Mitchell, program director at the New York Community Trust, as the new chair, replacing Doug Apple. Maksim Wynn, director of development and supportive housing at Bronx-based Procida Development Group, is joining as an owner representative. Wynn previously worked for the city\u2019s Department of Homeless Services and the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, where he focused on homelessness.\nThe mayor also named to the board Sina Sinai, senior research associate at the Jain Family Institute; Lauren Melodia, director of economic and fiscal policy at the Center for New York City Affairs at The New School; and Brandon Mancilla, a regional director of the United Auto Workers; as public members.\nDespite\nefforts\nby outgoing Mayor Eric Adams to leave the board with a majority of his own appointees, Mamdani entered office with the ability to appoint up to five of the nine board members in his first year, with the ability to replace the remaining four in his second.\nBut another spot was freed up when public member Alex Armlovich, who has been publicly\nskeptical\nof freezing rents, announced Tuesday that he was stepping down ahead of schedule. In a letter\nposted\non X, Armlovich said he was leaving to take a new position at Coefficient Giving, where he\u2019ll work on housing supply policy.\n\u201cIn a democracy, the mayor who wins an election has some right to appoint people who reflect his policy priorities, including on the RGB,\u201d he states in the letter, adding that he has confidence that the mayor\u2019s housing priorities are being guided by a team \u2014\u00a0he mentions Deputy Mayor of Housing and Planning\nLeila Bozorg\n\u2014 that is \u201cengaging with the full complexity of the problem.\u201d\nArmlovich urged board members to consider a proposal by Arpit Gupta, one of the owner representatives on the board. The proposal, dubbed a \u201cslumlord freeze\u201d by Armlovich, would only freeze rents for property owners whose buildings have the highest number of hazardous violations.\n\u201cIt directly ties a landlord\u2019s revenue to their performance as a housing provider, and it addresses the legitimate concern that blanket guidelines reward negligent and responsible ones alike,\u201d Armlovich writes.\nArmlovich\u2019s decision to step down before his term was up at the end of the year was first reported by The City.\nInstead of naming a sixth new member, Mamdani opted to reappoint Ad\u00e1n Soltren, a tenant representative, appointed by Adams whose term had expired.\nThe terms of the remaining members, Gupta and Christina Smyth, both owner representatives, and tenant representative Sagar Sharma, expire at the end of the year.\nAppointing a majority of the rent board\u2019s members doesn\u2019t guarantee that the body will ultimately freeze rents this year, let alone over the next four. The board is supposed to act independently of the mayor, though past administrations have influenced its decisions.\nIn a press release, the mayor didn\u2019t mention his pledge to freeze rents on stabilized apartments for the next four years. In a statement, he said that under Mitchell\u2019s leadership as chair, \u201cthe board will take a clear-eyed look at the complex housing landscape and the realities facing our city\u2019s two million rent-stabilized tenants.\u201d\nThe news of the appointments comes one day after the mayor unveiled his preliminary budget, which calls for a blanket\n9.5 percent property increase\nif the state doesn\u2019t hike corporate tax and income tax rates for New York\u2019s wealthiest.\n",

        "content": "Jeffrey Epstein surrounded himself with sultans, former heads of state, British royalty and tech visionaries to cultivate the image of a high-flying financier.\nBut in real estate, Epstein often leaned on a down-on-his-luck New York City developer with a trail of lawsuits and an array of business ventures that ranged from a deli to a houseware retailer to boutique luxury condos: David Mitchell.\nEpstein\u2019s previously undisclosed real estate investments with Mitchell show deeper insight into Epstein\u2019s business strategy. He invested in real estate not just for paper returns but to enhance his connections and stature, specifically turning to Mitchell to build out his ever-expanding Rolodex.\nOne source who knows Mitchell said that Epstein saw Mitchell \u2014 whose father was a famed NYC restaurateur \u2014 as someone who could open doors and make social connections for the outer borough-born Epstein in New York\u2019s upper-crust society. The relationship evolved as Mitchell\u2019s investments went south and he relied on Epstein for short-term loans and financial advice. Epstein provided at least $7 million in loans and investments in Mitchell\u2019s projects, according to a\nTRD\nestimate based on transactions specified in the documents.\nThe thousands of emails exchanged between Epstein, Mitchell and Epstein\u2019s assistants were released as part of 3.5 million pages of documents by the Department of Justice into the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. The emails suggest the relationship was mostly transactional, although they did occasionally exchange birthday and holiday messages. Epstein once asked Mitchell about an erectile dysfunction drug and Mitchell invited Epstein to a birthday party in Tel Aviv, telling him it should be \u201cquite demonic and fun.\u201d\nEpstein provided Mitchell funding for many of his projects, including a $1.5 million loan in 2017 to cover shortfalls at the Life Hotel, Mitchell\u2019s ambitious rebrand of the Herald Square Hotel. Epstein also invested in at least four of Mitchell\u2019s ventures, including a six-unit condo development on the Upper East Side, according to emails released by the Department of Justice.\nMitchell, despite his blue blood bona fides, often found himself needing cash infusions from Epstein, emails show. Epstein, whose liquid assets were in the hundreds of millions for most of their relationship, seemed happy to help, providing over $2 million in loans to Mitchell.\n\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it, life is long . No stress from me,\u201d Epstein said in response to Mitchell trying to negotiate a repayment plan for one of the loans he had received.\nEpstein did not appear to financially benefit from his relationship with Mitchell. But after the Department of Justice charged Epstein with sex trafficking dozens of underage girls in July 2019, Epstein\u2019s attorneys sought to put assets from two individuals up for a bond package: Epstein\u2019s brother and Mitchell, who was described by Epstein\u2019s attorneys as a \u201cfriend.\u201d\nBetween 2009 and 2019, Epstein also regularly sought connections from Mitchell. Epstein turned to the dealmaker to find a friend of Woody Allen\u2019s son a restaurant job. Epstein asked Mitchell for a rabbi who would do a conversion for \u201cshiksas,\u201d or non-jewish women. And he requested Mitchell\u2019s help with a Soho House membership.\nEpstein also offered Mitchell career advice, warning him he was in too many deals.\n\u201cTry to be disciplined about deals. breaking the addiction is not easy,\u201d said Epstein in an email to Mitchell in 2016. \u201cAs your friend i think too many\u2026 slow down, I need you around.\u201d\nMitchell did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\nTwo connectors\nMitchell hailed from the world Epstein always aspired to be a part of. Mitchell\u2019s father, Jan Mitchell, revived famed New York restaurants L\u00fcchow\u2019s and Longchamps. He bought an estate in Southampton modeled after the Villa Medici in Rome and amassed a collection of pre-Columbian gold, donating some to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\nJan\u2019s son dabbled in real estate, focusing on retailers and small high-end condos in Manhattan and Brooklyn Heights. Among his more notable ventures was Gracious Homes, an upscale housewares chain, which filed for bankruptcy in 2016.\nEpstein and Mitchell had a longstanding relationship. When Epstein\u2019s cushy 13-month jail sentence in Palm Beach County ended for charges of soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor for prostitution in July 2009, Mitchell called Epstein\u2019s office to offer \u201ccongratulations\u2026 or welcome back.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just so happy for you. Give me a call when you can,\u201d Mitchell said.\nMitchell acted as deal guy for Epstein. Over the course of their relationship, Mitchell brought a number of investment opportunities and business ideas to Epstein.\nMitchell\u2019s pitches were often for new and off-the-beaten-path deals, getting into loansharking, buying properties in Alberta, Canada, and a self-storage property in Tampa. But Mitchell rarely seemed to have the funds to close on these investments.\nAfter Epstein\u2019s prison sentence in Palm Beach ended in 2009, Epstein viewed Mitchell as a trusted confidante. Epstein asked Mitchell to arrange meetings with some of his most valued contacts. In 2010, Epstein requested that Mitchell go to Dubai with an Epstein associate to meet Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, the CEO of logistics giant DP World. A year later, Mitchell was asking Epstein, then a convicted sex offender, for \u201ccredibility help\u201d in the U.K., while he attempted to make a bid on the Silverstone racing track with Guggenheim Partners. Epstein hosted a meeting at his NYC townhouse with Peter Mandelson, a member of the U.K\u2019s House of Lords, and Mitchell. The deal fizzled out and Mitchell said he was looking for new partners and asked Epstein if he could pitch the deal to the \u201cSultan.\u201d\nBack in 2011, Epstein appeared to have nearly blind trust in Mitchell.\n\u201c[I\u2019m] closing today on your deal\u201e with no due diligence. I am merely relying on your representations . thanks and good luck,\u201d said Epstein in one email.\nEpstein also offered to help Mitchell out when was short on capital. In 2011, Mitchell asked for Epstein to show \u201cproof of funds\u201d to purchase 7 million British pounds. Mitchell said he just needed a \u201cflash.\u201d In 2012, Mitchell once again asked Epstein to provide a \u201cproof of funds\u201d letter for $21 million to satisfy an \u201cedgy\u201d seller in another deal.\nA partnership in the red\nEpstein invested millions with Mitchell, in addition to loaning him money directly, according to financial documents made public by the DOJ. Many of those investments did not reap returns.\nMitchell and Epstein were partners on multiple condo developments, including an Upper East Side condo conversion project of a Beaux-Arts mansion at 320 East 82nd Street that Mitchell had purchased for $16 million in 2015. They also co-invested in a four-unit condo project in Flatiron that attracted A-listers like Chelsea Clinton, Jeff Gordon and Jennifer Lopez after launching sales in 2013.\nBut the Upper East Side development hardly saw any buyers, let alone celebrities, come through the door after Mitchell\u2019s then-wife, Douglas Elliman agent Jamie Mitchell, launched sales in 2017. After pestering Mitchell for months about a project update, Epstein\u2019s accountant Richard Kahn was dismayed at the numbers Mitchell sent over in May 2018. \u201cThis summary sheet is useless and [Mitchell] is clearly lost,\u201d he wrote to Epstein. \u201cIt appears from sales scenario\u2026we get back $0 on our $3,480,000 investment.\u201d\nMitchell\u2019s other projects were quickly unraveling, as well.\nHe bought the Herald Square Hotel for $40 million in 2015 and sunk $30 million into renovations and rebranding as the boutique, 98-room Life Hotel, with ground-floor dining from restaurateur Steven Hanson, who also invested in the project.\nNearly immediately, the hotel appeared to be a losing proposition. Emails from October 2017 show Mitchell asking his partner Hanson for $2,600 to cover overdraft fees, and by 2018 he was looking to sell the property but couldn\u2019t find a bidder to make him and his investors whole, according to a lawsuit filed against Mitchell in state court.\nEpstein played the role of strategic advisor and, when necessary, bridge lender. He told Mitchell he wanted \u201cno tie to hotel.\u201d In 2017, Epstein\u2019s company, Financial Trust Real Estate, agreed to extend a $1.5 million loan to Mitchell for the Life Hotel. In 2023, Mitchell lost the hotel after the lender foreclosed on the underlying loan.\nAs Mitchell became more indebted to Epstein, Epstein provided Mitchell other ways to make some cash, like helping broker Epstein\u2019s purchase of his neighbor, Bill Cosby\u2019s townhome on East 71st Street. He also enlisted Mitchell to auction off a Hercules statue and another Roman statue with a projected value of $1.5 million.\nStill, Mitchell continued to ask Epstein for multiple short-term loans.\nIn October 2018, Epstein wired Mitchell $70,000. In January 2019, Mitchell asked Epstein for $100,000 wire. Epstein\u2019s accountant emailed Epstein, \u201che\u2019s desperate.\u201d\nEpstein\u2019s accountant was especially dubious of Mitchell\u2019s ability to repay his debts and the whereabouts of the statues.\n\u201cSeems like he is stumbling out of control all answers noncommittal..and info he gives us is never accurate,\u201d said Kahn.\nKahn emailed Mitchell, \u201cquite disturbing that your story keeps changing\u2026 you should be more careful as jeffrey trusts you yet you give me bad info every day.\u201d\nRecords of ledgers from Epstein\u2019s accounts show that Mitchell and his wife made payments in increments as small as $2,200 to Epstein over the course, totaling over $600,000, ending in April 2019.\nMitchell\u2019s money problems\nAfter Epstein\u2019s death in a federal detention center while awaiting charges of sex trafficking minors, Mitchell continued to face financial and legal challenges.\nA New York judge found he owed over $6 million to a broker he stiffed on a land deal in Las Vegas over a decade prior. Two different law firms sued him for unpaid legal fees, he was evicted from his Midtown East co-op for failing to pay 18 months of maintenance fees and his wife filed for divorce.\nIn 2020, a roughly $42,000 check bounced for his children\u2019s tuition at elite private school Columbia Grammar &amp; Preparatory. When the school administrator was informed over email, she responded: \u201cYou did not tell me\u2026but it does not surprise me at all.\u201d\nBy 2021, he listed just $1,200 in his Chase bank account, according to a court filing.\nJust last month, Mitchell was sued by an art gallery owner who collects Pre-Columbian art for an unpaid loan of $34,200.\nIn an email, the gallery owner offered Mitchell one last chance to pay up before commencing litigation.\n\u201cThis situation has been prolonged by repeated misrepresentations and delays,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Illinois\u2019 data center boom may be headed for a time-out.\nGov. JB Pritzker is expected on Wednesday to call for a two-year suspension of the state\u2019s tax incentives for new data centers, a sharp pivot for a governor who has long touted business recruitment. The proposal, first\nreported\nby NBC News, would take effect July 1 and halt eligibility for Illinois\u2019 data center tax credit program while the state studies the industry\u2019s impact.\nUnder the plan,\nPritzker\nwill direct state agencies to examine how existing facilities are affecting the power grid, consumer energy bills and the broader economy. The goal, according to his office, is to ensure data centers are financially sustainable, don\u2019t drive up utility costs and fairly allocate infrastructure resources. The Democratic-controlled\nGeneral Assembly\nwould need to sign off.\nThe move comes as hyperscale facilities tied to artificial intelligence demands proliferate nationwide, often with rich incentive packages attached. Illinois has been part of that push. But\nbacklash\nhas been building from Oregon to Texas to Virginia, where residents have raised concerns about electricity consumption, water usage and limited permanent job creation.\nPritzker\nsignaled earlier this month that he\u2019s wary of approving projects that could push residential rates higher.\n\u201cIf they do threaten to raise rates, we\u2019ve got to slow them down,\u201d he said, adding that lawmakers will take up the issue this spring.\nOther governors are recalibrating, too. Pennsylvania\u2019s Josh Shapiro recently outlined new criteria for developers seeking state resources, while Florida\u2019s Ron DeSantis has backed guardrails around growth. In Georgia, lawmakers passed a bill last year to curb incentives, though Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed it.\nA freeze in Illinois could complicate land purchases and speculative infrastructure wagers in exurban and industrial corridors that have been marketed as prime data center territory, the outlet reported. The sector has been one of the few bright spots for large-scale development sites amid sluggish office and uneven multifamily growth.\nPritzker\u2019s office stressed that Illinois still exports roughly 20 percent of the electricity it generates and remains open to business, but the message is clear that the AI gold rush won\u2019t grow unchecked for the next couple of years.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The 8,200-square-foot house sits on nearly an acre just outside of the gated Cocoplum neighborhood.\nJeter, via a Delaware LLC, paid $6.5 million for the home in 2018, which means the property just sold for more than double that amount. It was on the market with Alex Pirez\u2019s Mocca Realty, most recently asking $14.9 million. Compass agent Maurice Boschetti represented the buyer.\nJeter, a hall of famer and five-time World Series champion, set team records during his 20-year career with the Yankees with the most hits, doubles and games played. Jeter headed to Miami in 2017 when he became CEO and part owner of the Miami Marlins, a role he held until 2022.\nIn 2021, Jeter and his wife, Hannah, sold their waterfront estate in Tampa\nfor $22.5 million\n, then a record for the Tampa Bay region. The property, on the Davis Islands, had been rented to\nTom Brady and his then-wife\n, model and businesswoman Gisele B\u00fcndchen.\nThe Old Cutler Road home includes a pool, basketball court, summer kitchen and outdoor entertaining areas. The house also has a primary suite, a chef\u2019s kitchen, wine cellar, office and elevator. It was built in 2004.\nThe LLC linked to Jeter paid $16.6 million in 2021 for a double-lot nearby in Gables Estates, where he is building a waterfront mansion, records show.\nCoral Gables has seen a big increase in home prices at the very high end amid a flurry of ultra luxury sales. Last month, University of Miami booster John Ruiz listed his waterfront Gables Estates mansion\nfor $175 million\n, marking the second most expensive listing in Miami-Dade.\u00a0Last year, luxury homebuilder Alex Pirez sold his waterfront Gables Estates mansion\nfor $55 million\n, and in a separate sale, billionaire businessman Jorge Mas recently purchased a mansion in the same gated community\nfor $75 million\n, a source previously told\nTRD\n.\n",

The pair are joining the brokerage\u2019s Evanston office. Vogel and Blair were previously at @properties.\nThe move comes as major Chicago brokerages\njockey for talent\namid a shakeup in the real estate industry. Compass\u2019 acquisition of Anywhere Real Estate has brought many of\nChicago\u2019s top brokerages\nunder its ownership and forced legacy brokerages like\nBHHS Chicago\nto hone their pitch to agents.\nVogel founded the group in 2009, according to the release.

Vogel and Blair did not respond to a request for comment.\nBHHS Chicago has more than 1,000 agents in Chicagoland and nearby regions in Indiana and Michigan, the release said.\nThe move comes after some prominent agents left BHHS Chicago for rival agencies in recent months.\nSteve Jasinski\n, who leads a team in La Grange, moved from Berkshire to Baird &amp; Warner in December,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported. And\nRory Mone\njoined Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty from BHHS Chicago earlier this year.\nAmong other recent brokerage moves, @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate tapped\nJim Barcelona\nto be executive vice president of brokerage services at the Chicago-based firm, following the retirement of Thomas Downing.\n",

The heightened demand and diminished supply as\nnew apartment projects come to a halt\nhave contributed to the rent increase in recent years, according to the Business Times.\nIn January, median monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment was up 16.1 percent year-over-year to $3,670, per Zumper data cited by the Business Times. In the same period, median rents for two-bedroom units were up 19.1 percent to $5,010.\nRising nine stories above Folsom Street, 923 Folsom consists of a mix of junior one-bedroom, one-bedroom and two-bedroom units. The building was 97 percent occupied as of last September, per the Business Times.\nIn October 2022, a J.P. Morgan affiliate secured a $25.5 million loan backed by 923 Folsom with maturity slated for November 2029. The residential property was appraised at $69.1 million that year. It is not clear if Stockbridge assumed that debt as part of its acquisition of the building.\nElsewhere in Greater San Francisco, Stockbridge is one of three firms working to redevelop\nTreasure Island\noff the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.

Zeckendorf and Atlas Capital also snagged a\n$129 million\nsigned contract for multiple units at their 80 Clarkson development in December.\nWeinreb purchased the then-unfinished condo from the building\u2019s developer, Scott Resnick, for\n$38 million\nin 2017. Four years later, he sought to offload the 6,500-square-foot condo for $50 million, though after nearly a year on the market without finding a buyer, Weinreb pulled the unit and finished construction. He\nlisted it again\nin April for $75 million, but removed it just three months later.\nKlein declined to comment on the identity of the tenant.\nThe five-bedroom, five-bathroom condo has more than 4,500 square feet of outdoor space, including a rooftop terrace featuring what the Streeteasy listing describes as the \u201clargest private outdoor pool\u201d in the city. It also has a kitchen designed by celebrity chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten.\nAmenities in the 44-unit building, designed by Norman Foster\u2019s firm, include 24-hour doormen, fitness center, yoga studio and residents\u2019 lounge.\nResnick\u2019s SR Capital filed plans for the building in 2013 and completed construction on the project roughly two years later.

        "content": "Gov. JB Pritzker made policies to increase housing supply a key focus of his annual budget address on Wednesday, marking a win for the\nIllinois Realtors\ntrade association\u2019s yearslong push for the policies in Springfield.\nIllinois Realtors CEO Jeff Baker told\nThe Real Deal\nthe governor\u2019s backing is a turning point for the group\u2019s policy efforts.\n\u201cThis is a major step forward for the real estate industry in Illinois,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWe have seen supply and inventory put pressure on brokerages, on families, on city budgets. To have this get to this point is a major win.\u201d\nDuring his State of the State address on Wednesday, Pritzker endorsed legislation that would strip municipalities of the ability to ban certain types of multi-unit housing, allowing the construction of larger buildings in areas typically zoned for single-family homes. It also calls for allowing\naccessory dwelling units\nstatewide.\n\u201cThe problem is clear. Rent is too high, and homeownership is too far out of reach,\u201d Pritzker said in the address. \u201cThe cause is clear, too. We are not building enough homes fast enough.\u201d\nThe plan, called \u201cBuilding Up Illinois Developments\u201d and first reported by Capitol News Illinois, is aimed at addressing Illinois\u2019\npersistent housing shortage\n. The state ranked 48th out of the 50 states in 2024 for new housing construction per capita, according to an analysis from Construction Coverage. The proposal is similar to the bills that Illinois Realtors, the statewide group representing real estate agents, has supported in recent years.\nThe proposal would set a statewide standard that allows building multi-unit buildings on lots zoned for any residential use of 5,000 square feet or more. The allowed density will be on a sliding scale, with eight-unit buildings allowed on the largest lots without the need to seek zoning approval.\nThe plan would also allow accessory dwelling units to be built on any land zoned for residential use. Chicago officials passed an ordinance allowing accessory dwelling units in certain areas last year.\nMany lawmakers in the Democratic-majority legislature have seen the need for these policies, Baker said. But opposition from local governments that don\u2019t want to lose zoning authority have stunted their passage, he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of other issues that can grab attention, and for this one to be on (Pritzker\u2019s) short list \u2026 that\u2019s a huge win for the real estate industry,\u201d Baker said.\nIn addition to zoning reform, Pritzker\u2019s plan aims to address the soft costs of development. The plan calls for a uniform standard for impact fees \u2014 charges levied by local governments on new development to pay for public services, Baker said.\nCurrently, municipalities often divert those fees into their general funds rather than infrastructure specific to the new housing, Baker said. The new law would standardize the formula and penalize towns that don\u2019t use the money for its intended purpose.\nAlthough the realtors\u2019 lobbying group has made some headway in changing local policies, Baker said municipalities have largely resisted changing zoning and impact fee policies on their own.\n\u201cWe have shown state leaders that NIMBYism is ingrained at that local level to the point that if we\u2019re really going to make a difference here, it\u2019s going to require statewide change,\u201d Baker said.\nPritzker is proposing committing $250 million to fund the policy shifts. The funding includes $100 million for infrastructure grants to help prepare sites for denser housing, $100 million to assist developments with limited access to capital, and $50 million to boost the Illinois Housing Development Authority\u2019s low-income housing programs, Baker said.\nIllinois Realtors\nbuilt up its lobbying team\nearlier this year to prepare for the legislative session, bringing on former local government staffers to work with Cook County and Chicago officials. The group added Melia Carter, formerly leading government affairs for the Midwest for Verizon, as vice president of governmental affairs.\nThe governor will hold a roundtable with industry leaders Wednesday on the proposal, Baker said. The group will be working with local government officials and state lawmakers over the next few months as the legislation is being considered, he said.\n",

        "content": "San Francisco\u2019s recently approved Family Zoning plan is under fire from both sides of the housing debate, with dueling lawsuits challenging the city\u2019s newly adopted blueprint for growth.\nIn December, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors approved\nMayor Daniel Lurie\u2019s rezoning plan\nthat allows for more housing options in neighborhoods with greater access to growth-supporting economic opportunities and services like public transit, parks, retail and community facilities. One lawsuit alleges the city\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t go far enough to increase housing supply, while the other claims the ordinance threatens neighborhoods and needs further study before implementation, the San Francisco Examiner\nreported\n.\nThe opposition lawsuit, filed last month by a coalition of neighborhood and small business groups including Neighborhoods United SF and Small Business Forward, claims the city rushed a \u201chaphazard\u201d plan through and \u201capproved [it] with little meaningful analysis.\u201d\nThe complaint claims that the\nCalifornia Environmental Quality Act\nrequires additional consideration. According to the groups, the final plan is \u201cdramatically\u201d different from the city\u2019s 2023 housing element and includes provisions for denser and taller development in historic northern neighborhoods that were not studied as part of the earlier housing element. Opponents believe the Family Zoning plan will incentivize speculative redevelopment, strain infrastructure and displace rent-controlled tenants and small businesses.\n\u201cIt was the ultimate game of goalpost moving,\u201d Romalyn Schmaltz, a 20-year North Beach resident and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, told the Examiner of the development process behind Lurie\u2019s law. \u201cThe Family Zoning plan was inappropriately planned and was rushed through without sufficient input and was understudied.\u201d\nA second lawsuit, filed by pro-housing groups\nYIMBY Law\n, the California Housing Defense Fund and Californians for Homeownership, argues the rezoning doesn\u2019t go far enough to meet state housing production targets and unlawfully deviates from the housing element\u2019s commitments. The organizations cite city projections showing the plan could yield as few as 8,500 to 14,600 units by 2045,\nwell short of the 82,069 units\nthat San Francisco is required by the state to plan for by 2031.\n\u201cThe Family Zoning plan is not good enough,\u201d Sonja Trauss, executive director of YIMBY Law, told the Examiner. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t implement what was promised in the housing element. Maybe it\u2019s better than what we had before, but it\u2019s not going to produce the 82,000 units the city needs.\u201d\nSan Francisco Supervisors approved the upzoning plan to avoid missing a Jan. 31 state deadline, after which the city faced the\npotential implementation of builder\u2019s remedy\n, forcing officials to approve any proposed projects that meet basic standards, as well as the loss of more than $100 million per year in state funding. Lurie\u2019s office is standing by the approved plan.\n\u201cAs the cost of housing continues to rise, the Family Zoning Plan is going to help ensure that the next generation of San Franciscans can afford to raise their kids here,\u201d a Lurie spokesperson told the Examiner. \u201cBut our administration is not going to hand the keys to Sacramento. We\u2019re going to meet state requirements while protecting what\u2019s so special about our neighborhoods and our city.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Plano is making a giant offer to secure a telecom giant.\nThe Collin County suburb is prepared to offer AT&amp;T a $20 million incentive package \u2014 the largest in the city\u2019s history \u2014 plus a 65 percent property tax rebate on improvements for 25 years, as part of a bid to lock in AT&amp;T\u2019s planned multibillion-dollar global headquarters. The Dallas Morning News\nreported\nthat City Council members are slated to vote on the deal on Monday.\nUnder the proposal, AT&amp;T must invest at least $1.4 billion to build a minimum 2 million square feet of office, amenity and retail space on 54 acres at\n5400 Legacy Drive\n. The company would be required to employ 10,000 full-time workers at the campus and occupy it for at least 25 years. Partial occupancy is targeted for the second half of 2028.\nCEO John Stankey\nannounced in January that the Fortune 500 firm would relocate its global headquarters to Plano, marking a major reinvestment in the city\u2019s Legacy business district. The land is part of a 215-acre tract owned by Dallas-based NexPoint that includes the former Electronic Data Systems campus founded by H. Ross Perot Sr.\nHalf of the $20 million grant would offset redevelopment costs at the site. Even so, Plano\u2019s economic development fund would retain roughly $36.8 million for future projects, according to city documents. AT&amp;T must meet specified construction and employment benchmarks to receive the grants and rebates.\nPlano Mayor John Muns has framed the relocation as a generational win, building on the suburb\u2019s track record of luring corporate heavyweights such as Toyota Motor North America and JCPenney.\nThe flip side:\nDowntown Dallas\nstands to take a hit.\nAT&amp;T has been headquartered in Downtown Dallas\nsince 2008\nand leases the 37-story Whitacre Tower at 208 South Akard Street, owned by Pacific Elm Properties and Dundon Capital Partners, through the end of 2031. The company occupies roughly 3 million square feet in the city \u2014 more than any other private employer, according to CoStar \u2014 and invested $100 million in its Discovery District, which opened in 2021.\nDowntown Dallas has estimated a full relocation could slash downtown property values by as much as 30 percent, or about $2.7 billion.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Owners Dr. Aaron Rollins, a cosmetic surgeon and inventor of AirSculpt, and his wife, Marine Rollins, listed the estate for\n$200 million\nin November. Marine Rollins did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\nDanny and Jill Hertzberg with the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker Realty have the listing. They declined to comment for this story.\nA media frenzy exploded around the billionaire couple when the Wall Street Journal reported they were in contract to buy the newly completed Indian Creek Island mansion of\nJersey Mike\u2019s Subs founder Peter Cancro\nand his wife, Tatiana Cancro. The purported deal was touted as another victory for Florida in the Sunshine vs. Golden State battle for billionaires, and a sign that\nCalifornia\u2019s proposed 5 percent wealth tax\nwas driving out its richest residents.\nBut multiple market insiders confirmed to\nThe Real Deal\nthat the\nCancros are not selling their estate\n, a revelation that triggered a hunt for Zuckerberg and Chan\u2019s true target.\nWith the 7 Indian Creek Island Road compound identified, it remains unclear how seriously the couple is considering the purchase or whether it would involve a relocation to Florida. The estate would likely not be completed until mid-2027 at the earliest. A move at that time would not spare them from the multi-billion dollar tax bill they would get if California voters in November approve the wealth tax, which would apply to assets held as of Jan. 1, 2026.\n\u2013\u2013\nKate Hinsche",

        "content": "A River North parking lot that has cycled through condo and office dreams is finally getting a firm plan.\nA joint venture of Chicago-based firms Third Coast Real Estate and ZSD landed $44 million in construction financing for a nine-story, 149-unit apartment project at 300-324 West Huron Street, a site that has sat largely untouched for a decade, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. JLL arranged the capital stack, which includes a three-year, $38.1 million construction loan from CIBC and $6 million in preferred equity from N3 Capital Management.\nThe total development cost is pegged at $57 million.\nThe project is breaking ground as downtown Chicago\u2019s multifamily pipeline has thinned to a trickle. Just three major apartment developments totaling fewer than 600 units are slated for completion in 2026, according to Integra Realty Resources. The publication reported that with debt and equity markets still tight, that scarcity has helped push rents higher and given well-capitalized sponsors an opening.\nThird Coast founder\nReed Edwards\nsaid the venture is betting its March 2027 completion will align with continued strength in Chicago\u2019s rental fundamentals. Translation: fewer cranes today could mean pricing power tomorrow.\nThe development will rise on a full-block surface lot along Huron Street between Orleans and Franklin streets. ZSD, led by Zev Salomon,\nbought the land\nfor $9 million from North Wells Capital, which had\npreviously planned\na 260,000-square-foot office building before shelving the proposal amid pandemic-era office fallout. At one point,\nanother developer\nhad approvals for a 24-story condo tower, but that plan also fizzled.\nUnlike many recent city projects, the West Huron development is proceeding under existing zoning, according to the outlet. That means it sidesteps Chicago\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance, which mandates that developers seeking zoning changes set aside 20 percent of units as affordable or pay an in-lieu fee.\nPlans call for a mix of studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments, along with roughly 3,700 square feet of ground-floor retail and 21 parking spaces.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Property records show a sale price of $270 million, but that figure does not typically include fixtures and non-real estate assets.\nBanco Inbursa provided a $235 million loan for the acquisition, according to property records.

The hotel is the latest acquisition in Gencom\u2019s recent New York buying spree. In 2024, the firm acquired the\nThompson Central Park Hotel\n, followed by the\nInterContinental New York Times Square\nin December 2025.\nFounded in 1987 by Karim Alibhai, Gencom has nearly $8 billion in assets under management.

But\nwhile he pursues\nmulti-million-dollar redevelopment plans for the site, lenders have claimed Morton stopped repaying the debts.\nAtlanta-based U.S. Strategic Capital, a short-term lender to small businesses, filed a lawsuit this month to foreclose on two of Morton\u2019s East Hampton properties. The suit, filed in Suffolk County, claimed his development firm, Excelsior Development NY, defaulted on a $3.8 million loan from July.\nMorton personally guaranteed the loan, allowing USSC to pursue the developer\u2019s personal assets if a potential foreclosure sale doesn\u2019t cover his debts, which the suit places at more than $4 million.\nA foreclosure sale would also need to cover the senior loans on Morton\u2019s homes, according to the complaint. The developer took out a mortgage of over $5 million last March on the property at 38 Chatfields Ridge Road, which appears to be one of his personal residences. He also took out a mortgage with a principal amount of around $3.8 million in 2023 on the home at 126 Long Lane.\n\u201cI am addressing these matters in the ordinary course,\u201d Morton said in a statement. \u201cI take my obligations seriously and will continue to work constructively with all stakeholders as issues are evaluated and resolved.\u201d\nNonpayment accusations land on local developer\nOne day after USSC\u2019s lawsuit, Morton was hit with another complaint, claiming he defaulted on roughly $200,000 worth of small business loans that he personally guaranteed in 2021. The loans were tied to an entity with the same address as Provisions Natural Foods, a local grocery chain with locations in Sag Harbor and, formerly, Water Mill. The Water Mill store\nannounced\nin 2024 that it would not be reopening, and would instead debut a new branch at the Southampton commercial corner Morton bought in 2024.\nThe action followed a roughly $330,000 judgment secured by a building supplies company against Morton\u2019s development firm last month over unpaid materials purchased last summer. Morton personally guaranteed the debt and signed a confession of judgment, allowing the judgment to be entered against him.\nThe two lawsuits and confession of judgment claim that Morton stopped making payments \u2014 for the supplies and on his loans \u2014 in November.\nIt was around this time that Morton\u2019s development firm took out a cash advance from Simply Funding, a source of short-term capital that buys discounted receivables from companies. Simply Funding paid Morton $310,000 for $415,000 worth of receivables, requiring him to repay roughly $10,000 each month until hitting the $415,000 he owed, according to documents in a lawsuit filed last month by Simply Funding.\nBut Morton only made it two weeks before he stopped making payments, Simply Funding claimed. The developer also signed a confession judgment and personally guaranteed the amount owed, which is almost $400,000, according to a court judgment.\nAll told, Morton has personally guaranteed roughly $5 million in loans and other debts in the last year, according to these four filings.\nFor now, Morton is advancing on his plans to redevelop the downtown Sag Harbor retail properties at 2 Main Street and 22 Long Island Avenue. He secured a\n$40 million loan\nin February 2025 from Mavick Capital to fund the acquisition and redevelopment of the properties.\nBut beyond appearing at local meetings to curry favor and discuss his plans for the properties, the developer has avoided making public waves for his projects. He previously declined to confirm the acquisition to 27East.\n\u201cPeople are buying properties in the Hamptons every day,\u201d\nhe told the outlet\n. \u201cIs there some kind of obligation for the media to write about it?\u201d\n",

        "content": "The owner of Miami Beach\u2019s Sixty Sixty Resort thwarted a foreclosure auction at the last minute by filing for bankruptcy.\nCoconut Grove-based Bloom Hotels 6060 filed a chapter 11 petition in Miami federal court on Monday, a day before the 16-story waterfront building at 6060 Indian Creek Drive was set to be sold to satisfy a lender\u2019s $23.7 million judgment, the South Florida Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe owner listed \u200bassets and liabilities each in the $10 million to $50 million range, according to the petition signed by the entity\u2019s manager, Richard Valdes. Bloom Hotels 6060 owns all 87 condo-hotel units at the Sixty Sixty, which was completed in 1992 and converted to a condo-hotel in 2005.\nIn 2022, an affiliate of Bloom Hotels 6060 paid\n$23.5 million\nfor the then-82-key property, acquiring all of the units from a joint venture between\nIntegra Investments\nand Sagar Desai\u2019s\nActivate Hospitality\n.\nAt the time, the buyer included Miami-based Bloom Ventures, led by CEO David Harari, as the lead partner of Bloom Hotels 6060. The firm planned to operate Sixty Sixty as a full hotel, possibly under a Hilton brand, expand the room count and renovate the building. But Bloom Ventures sold its interest shortly after the 2020 purchase.\nIn June of last year,\nDe Paz Family Investment\nfiled a foreclosure lawsuit against Bloom Hotels 6060, the property\u2019s condo association and loan guarantors Valdes, Daniel Araf and Todd Linden. The trio manage Miami-based entities that own Bloom Hotels 6060, corporate records show. Linden and Valdes lead Miami-based Circle Capital Partners.\nDe Paz alleged Bloom Hotels 6060 defaulted on a $21 million loan taken out in 2023. In December, Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Beatrice Butchko Sanchez granted final judgment in favor of De Paz, including missed interest payments and fees. A week ago, the judge denied Bloom Hotels 6060\u2019s motion to cancel the Feb. 17 foreclosure sale, court records show.\nBloom Hotels 6060\u2019s largest unsecured creditors include Turkey-based GNCR Holdings, which is owed $2 million; Miami law firm Garcia-Menocal, Irias &amp; Pastori, which is owed $1.16 million; and Davie-based ACOE 1, which is owed $867,863, the bankruptcy petition states.\n\u2014 Francisco Alvarado",

        "content": "The most unusual feature of this latest mansion sale isn\u2019t the chandeliers and disco balls motif. It\u2019s the $7.5 million price tag in\nPlano\n.\nThe six-bedroom, nine-bathroom home at 6509 Sudbury Road in Plano sold at the end of January, according to public records. With a listing price of $7.5 million, it was\none of the most expensive December listings\nin the state, according to the Houston Association of Realtors, which tracks residential listings in the major metro areas of Texas.\nIt\u2019s also near the top of Plano\u2019s luxury market. At present, just one home in Plano is currently listed at a higher price: a $12.8 million, 14,100-square-foot mansion at 6413 Old Gate Road.\nThe asking price of the home on Sudbury amounts to about $580 per square foot. The final sale price was not disclosed.\nThe sellers are Rahim and Salima Dhanani, and the buyer is the Andrew J. McFaul Trust, public records show. Compass agent Jackie Dorbritz represented the sellers, but the buyer was unrepresented, according to Redfin.\nThe home spans about 13,000 square feet on a lot of 0.86 acres. Designed by\nSimmie Cooper\n\u2014 better known for work in Dallas\u2019 luxury enclaves, the Park Citie \u2014, the home melds elements of traditional European villas with contemporary glitz. Fluted columns frame the front entrance and line the halls, and a Swarovski chandelier hangs in the primary suite. Additionally, the house has a dance room with an illuminated dance floor and a disco ball.\nThe sellers had some difficulty selling the home. They listed the property for brief periods between 2020 and 2024, pricing it between $7.2 million and $6.9 million. It last hit the market in December, outranking three of the top 10 most expensive residential listings in Texas for that month.\nThe top sales in the state have historically clustered in the Park Cities in Dallas. However, last year a new Collin County residential price record was set when BuzzBalls founder Merrilee Kick bought the 6.75-acre estate at\n5805 Red Wolf Lane for $15.9 million\n. It was the only Plano home to rank in the top 10 luxury sales in the Metroplex in 2025.\n",

        "content": "A luxury hotel on the San Antonio River Walk is heading to the courthouse steps.\nThe Thompson San Antonio \u2013 Riverwalk is slated for a March 3 foreclosure auction after affiliated lenders Sunrise Realty Trust and Southern Realty Trust issued a notice of default on the hotel portion of the mixed-use property at 115 Lexington Avenue, according to Bexar County records. The San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\nthat the two real estate investment trusts refinanced the property with a $44 million senior loan in 2024.\nOnly the hotel \u2014 aside from the building\u2019s 59 residential condos \u2014 is subject to the foreclosure notice. The Thompson Hotels banner falls under the\nHyatt\nLifestyle umbrella.\nIn the Feb. 6 filing, the lenders said they gave developer DC Partners four opportunities throughout 2025 to cure the default. West Palm Beach, Florida-based Sunrise and Southern declined to comment.\nHouston-based DC Partners, which completed the project in 2021, attributed the distress to a convergence of market headwinds. In a statement through a spokesperson, the firm cited slower than expected stabilization, a wave of\nnew downtown hotel supply\nand persistently high interest rates.\nOpening during the pandemic didn\u2019t help.\n\u201cThese factors \u2014 including opening during Covid and a broader softness in the San Antonio hotel market \u2014 created challenges that were not anticipated and challenging to overcome,\u201d the firm\u2019s spokesperson told the outlet, adding that the situation reflects market conditions rather than the property\u2019s long-term viability.\nThe foreclosure comes less than two years after Miami-based 3650 REIT provided a $38 million refinancing in 2022, followed by the $44 million refinancing from Sunrise and Southern in 2024. At the time, Sunrise and Southern CEO Brian Sedrish said the loan highlighted confidence in DC Partners as well as demand for upscale accommodations in Texas.\nNow that notion is being tested.\nThe 162-key hotel was among a new class of high-end\nhospitality projects\naimed at elevating San Antonio\u2019s\nRiver Walk offerings\n. But as new rooms have come online and borrowing costs have climbed, operators have faced margin pressure in a market that historically depends on convention and leisure demand, according to the publication.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Soon-ish, housing projects filed in certain community districts can skip City Council review.\nIn\nNovember\n, voters\napproved\nthe \u201chousing fast-track,\u201d a condensed version of the city\u2019s land use review process.\nThe fast-track will be available to some projects proposed in the 12 community districts with the lowest rates of affordable housing development. To be eligible, a housing project must be (at least) subject to the affordability requirements under the city\u2019s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program.\nSuch projects will avoid City Council review during the city\u2019s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, or Ulurp. The local community board and borough president will also review the project concurrently for 60 days, further cutting down the review timeline.\nBut first, the city has to identify the districts.\nThe city will look at new affordable housing development in each district every five years. The first tally will look at apartments initiated between July 1, 2021, and June 30, 2026.\nThe Department of City Planning recently released proposed rules for calculating development rates in each community district.\nThe proposed methodology relies on two metrics. The first: The number of new affordable housing units added to a community district over a five-year period. \u201cNew units\u201d are counted if a regulatory agreement or restrictive declaration has been signed and a permit has been issued by the Department of Buildings.\nRequiring both of those milestones \u201censures that new affordable units are sufficiently far along in the development process that they are reasonably certain to be delivered,\u201d the proposed rules state.\nThe second: The total number of housing units in a district at the start of each five-year cycle, based on the latest Census (plus or minus any units built or demolished in the intervening years, based on DOB records). To establish the development rate in each district, the number of new units will be divided by the total number of housing units in the district.\nCity Planning has to release the list of 12 districts by Oct. 1, and then every five years after that. Projects can apply for the fast track in these districts starting Jan. 1.\nA hearing on the proposed rules is slated for April 1.\nThe \u201cfast-track\u201d is one of three approved ballot measures aimed at easing housing approvals. One allows developers to appeal the City Council\u2019s rejection of a housing project, while another creates a shorter review process (dubbed Expedited Land Use Review Procedure, or Elurp) for modest projects.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Are you working on a project that may be affected by the housing ballot measures? Are you eyeing a development in a district that you suspect will make the fast-track list? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: An appellate court this week upheld the\ndismissal\nof a lawsuit brought by the Carnegie House co-op board, which sought to halt ground lease negotiations and the state\u2019s rent laws as they pertain to setting initial rents in the event that the co-op building is deconverted and turned into rent-stabilized apartments. Last year, Judge Arthur Engoron threw the lawsuit out, calling it \u201cpremature.\u201d\nThe appellate court agreed, noting that \u201cdeconversion and the ensuing harms\nenvisaged by plaintiffs may never come to pass.\u201d\nThe recent ruling is the latest win for landowners, Rubie Schron and David Werner. Late last year, another court\nfound\nin favor of the owners, signing off on increasing the ground rent from $4.36 million to $24 million.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 The Public Authorities Control Board on Wednesday advanced plans to build 105 income-restricted homeownership units at the former Lincoln Correctional Facility at 31-33 West 110th Street. The board signed off on $18.7 million in funding from the state Homes and Community Renewal\u2019s Affordable Homeownership Program. The project is being developed by Infinite Horizons, L+M Development Partners, Urbane Development Group and Lemor Development Group.\n\u2014 The Mamdani administration on Wednesday broke ground on 341 affordable housing units at a former NYPD parking lot in East Harlem. The project, dubbed Timbale Terrace, has been a long time in the making. The project was proposed in 2016 as part of the East Harlem Neighborhood Plan. A developer for the site was\nselected\nin 2021.\n\u2014 ICYMI, the mayor\nappointed\nfive new members to the Rent Guidelines Board. He also reappointed one of the tenant reps.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$24.2 million\nfor a 3,547-square-foot sponsor-sale condominium unit at 50 West 66th Street in Lincoln Square. Beth Benalloul and Hilary Landis of the Corcoran Group\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was $269.7 million for the\nhotel\nand\ncommercial\nportions of The Ritz-Carlton New York, Central Park, at 50 Central Park South. As\nTRD reported\ntoday, the full price of the acquisition was $320 million.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$33.7 million\nfor a 4,628-square-foot condo at 520 Park Avenue in Lenox Hill. Lisa Larson and Angela Wu with Sotheby\u2019s have the listing. The unit last sold for\n$28.25 million in 2022\n.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permits filed were for a proposed 13,331-square-foot, 16-unit project at 4572 Manhattan College Parkway in Kingsbridge.

After the community was developed, the lots went up for sale in the early \u201990s for a reported starting price of $2.5 million.\nSeveral A-listers have called Brentwood Country Estates home over the years. Past homeowners include Arnold Schwarzenegger, Heidi Klum, Tom Brady and his now ex-wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen. Dr. Dre (n\u00e9e Andre Young) bought the home once owned by Brady and B\u00fcndchen for $40 million in 2014.\nThe Goldens\u2019 home is about a five-minute walk from\n12833 Chalon Road\n, which is owned by Douglas Emmett founder Ken Panzer. Panzer put his home up for sale last July, with a $58.5 million asking price that made it the most expensive listing in Brentwood at the time. It was bested not too long after by 3099 Mandeville Canyon Road, which is on the market for $70 million, or $3,500 per square foot.\nThe asking price for Panzer\u2019s Chalon Road residence was cut to $49.5 million in October, with a deal pending on the home since January.\n",

Business First\nand the\nDesert Sun\nreported.\nIt will be Ikea\u2019s 10th outpost in Southern California. The company runs full-sized Ikea locations in Burbank, Carson, Costa Mesa and Covina, as well as one small-format store in Arcadia and plan-and-order points with pickup in Santa Monica, Thousand Oaks and Ontario. Ikea\u2019s city-center stores comprise showroom-like outposts rather than the company\u2019s typical suburban warehouse sites, allowing urban customers to explore products in person and have them delivered to their homes.\nThe Culver City Ikea is planned to span approximately\u202f38,050\u202fsquare feet and feature a central planning area and the chain\u2019s signature food court. Ikea is planning to open 10 new stores across the country this year, including locations in Chicago; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and Fort Collins, Colorado.\nIkea first announced its Culver City plans in its\nfiscal year 2025 annual summary\n, per L.A. Business First. Last fiscal year, the company reported $5.3 billion in total sales, including $1.9 billion in e-commerce, despite \u201cchallenging external factors including increased inflation and waning consumer confidence.\u201d Ikea stores saw nearly 61 million guests, with more than 457 million online visitors.\nThe company in recent years has been sinking more money into expansion efforts across the country. In 2023, Ingka Group, the largest owner and operator of Ikea stores, announced a\nnearly $2.2 billion investment\nto open more than a dozen new outposts. Ikea has 12 franchisees overall.\nIngka Group is also\nacquiring a portfolio of malls\nfrom coast to coast with plans to anchor those retail centers with Ikea stores. The owner and operator hopes to position the new sites as go-to destinations for customers with eateries, children\u2019s play areas and new WeWork-style spaces as part of its\nHej! Workshop\ncoworking brand. In 2024, Ingka Group\u2019s Ingka Centres finished the transformation of a six-story property in San Francisco into the city\u2019s\nfirst Ikea store\n, outfitted with a 46,000-square-foot Hej!

        "content": "The West Loop\u2019s most complicated game of financial chicken has finally hit the courthouse steps.\nLess than two weeks after\nThe Real Deal\nrevealed a foreclosure lawsuit was under serious consideration by the lenders for the 23-story office building at\n300 South Riverside Plaza\nin Chicago, the debt\u2019s special servicer, LNR Partners, officially pulled the trigger. LNR on Friday filed a $167 million complaint against the landlord, a joint venture of\nRubin Schron\u2019s Cammeby\u2019s International\nand David Lowenfeld\u2019s World Wide Group, according to public records.\nLNR, acting on behalf of bondholders in pools of securitized debt, has moved to seize the 1.1 million-square-foot office tower, ramping up a months-long standoff over multiple alleged defaults on a combined $342 million in debt tied to the property.\nThe lawsuit marks the messy climax of a bifurcated ownership structure gone wrong. On one side are the leasehold owners, David Werner and Joseph Mizrachi, who have been allegedly underwater on their own $175 million building loan since late 2022. On the other side are the fee owners \u2014 a venture of Rubin Schron\u2019s Cammeby\u2019s International and David Lowenfeld\u2019s World Wide Group \u2014 who hold the land with a lease requiring ground rent payments from Werner and Mizrachi.\nThe house of cards collapsed in October when Werner and Mizrachi allegedly stopped paying ground rent checks. Without the cash flow, the landowners allegedly couldn\u2019t service their own $167 million loan taken out in 2015 to fund their $220 million purchase of the ground from Werner and Mizrachi. LNR didn\u2019t wait long to lose patience; after issuing a notice of default in November and accelerating the debt in December, the servicer is now asking a judge for a receiver to take the property away from the Cammeby\u2019s and World Wide venture. LNR wants Scott Shefman of Farmington Hills, Michigan-based Friedman Real Estate appointed as receiver, legal filings show.\nFor Schron, the lawsuit marks a rare public slipup for his well-known New York-based firm, Cammeby\u2019s.\nFor Werner and Mizrachi \u2014 prolific buyers known for high-leverage plays \u2014 the 300 South Riverside foreclosure filing is a stinging rebuke of the\nground lease model once seeming like a clever way\nto slice the capital stack.\nAfter buying the property for $194 million in 2010, they tried previously to sell it in the mid-2010s, but failed to generate offers matching their pricing ambitions of about $335 million. They eventually settled on selling the land only in 2015 and continuing to hunt for the right buyer for the building. But one never materialized before the office market got rocked by the pandemic, vaporizing values for properties carrying heavy debt, like the landlords at the 300 South Riverside building.\nAn attorney for LNR declined to comment. Representatives of Cammeby\u2019s, World Wide, David Werner and Mizrachi\u2019s firm Third Millennium Group didn\u2019t return requests for comment. Shinhan Investment Corp., the South Korean lender whose $175 million loan to Werner and Mizrachi originated in 2017 before it fell into default several years ago, hasn\u2019t returned multiple requests for comment on how it intends to resolve the broken deal tied to the building portion at 300 South Riverside.\nDespite the fallout, Werner remains on an office distress buying spree in both Chicago and New York. Earlier this year, he and 601W Cos. nabbed the\nLoop\u2019s 175 West Jackson Boulevard building for $41 million\n\u2014 an 87 percent discount from its 2017 price \u2014 following another bargain buy of the building at 303 East Wacker.\nWerner\u2019s 2025 New York run featured discounted acquisitions of the properties at\nOne Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld Plaza for $270 million\nand 205 East 42nd Street for $165 million, plus a $700 million office-to-residential conversion loan for the building at 235 East 42nd Street.\nBack in Chicago,\nMizrachi and Hines are hunting an anchor tenant\nfor a proposed 600,000-square-foot tower at 590 West Madison.\nThe foreclosure lawsuit for the 300 South Riverside property is set for an initial hearing in August, online court records show, but additional motions filed in the lawsuit between now and then could prompt an earlier hearing.\n",

        "content": "The strength of the Chicago area\u2019s multifamily market now extends to the Wisconsin border, too.\nWestmont, Illinois-based Santefort Real Estate Group recently expanded into the market with its first two apartment complex purchases in the Badger State.\nSantefort bought The Fountain Ridge and Cobblestone Creek Apartments in Pleasant Prairie Wisconsin near the Illinois border for a combined $100 million, or about $234,000 per unit. The purchase of the two properties, which total 426 units, was backed by a $66 million loan arranged by Berkadia, according to people familiar with the deal.\nThe recent deals in southeast Wisconsin highlight a growing demand from multifamily investors for properties in the Chicago metro area and the\nMidwest in general.\nThe Midwest region began seeing momentum around 2022 when formerly hot markets like Austin, Nashville and Phoenix began to cool off. As interest rates began to tick up, Sun Belt cities\nstruggled with multifamily distress\nand an influx of development led to concerns of oversupply, weighing rents down.\nOn the other hand, effective rents in Chicago climbed 3.8 percent year-over-year to about $1,800, in the last quarter of 2025, according to MMG Real Estate Advisors. Nationally, average rent grew 0.6 percent to about $1,700 during the same time period, MMG found.\nIn southeast Wisconsin, investors benefit from proximity to both Chicago and Milwaukee, Santefort COO John Perkowski said, and it presents a \u201ctremendous long-term upside.\u201d\nThere\u2019s enthusiasm for the area across asset classes in the property market.\nOn the single-family side, neighboring Kenosha, Wisconsin ranked as the\nthird-hottest real estate market nationally\nlast fall, a Realtor.com analysis found. The city, about 60 miles north of Chicago, was joined by six other Wisconsin markets and two in Illinois in the top 20, when ranked by days on the market and activity on the website\u2019s listing page, a September report found.\nThe rankings reveal buyers are increasingly interested in low-cost markets outside major hubs like Chicago, where prices are rising and low inventory is squeezing availability.\nAnd renters are branching out too. Apartments in\nChicago\u2019s suburbs\nhave seen increased demand as\nrent in the city ticks up\namid dwindling multifamily supply. Lenders have been more eager to fund new developments and\nacquisitions\nin\nthe outer suburbs\nthan the city because of the\ncity\u2019s volatile political and property tax environment\n.\nThis year, Chicago is on track to see\nthe lowest number of new apartments completed since 2012\n, according to a recent report from Marcus &amp; Millichap. Less than 4,000 new units will be completed by the end of 2026, the brokerage found. But the Lake County-Kenosha submarket in the far northern suburbs of Chicago is slated to receive the most new units in 2026, the brokerage found.\nSantefort took note of that trend and\nbought a 181-unit apartment complex\nin Lombard, in the western suburbs where development remains more suppressed, for $46 million last year.\n",

        "content": "A long-stalled stretch of Chicago riverfront is back to development.\nChicago\u2019s City Council approved zoning for Foundry Park on Wednesday, a $3 billion, 6 million-square-foot mixed-use development pitched for 34 acres along the Chicago River between Lincoln Park and Bucktown. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat the sign-off clears a major hurdle for the joint venture of Chicago-based JDL Development and Boca Raton-based Kayne Anderson Real Estate, which aim to break ground on the first phase this fall.\nThe approval marks a dramatic reset for the northern portion of the failed Lincoln Yards megaproject, originally approved in 2019 under Chicago-based developer Sterling Bay. That 14 million-square-foot vision ultimately collapsed under the weight of infrastructure costs and frozen capital markets, with lender Bank OZK seizing most of the site last year.\nFoundry Park is\nnotably slimmer\n. Plans call for roughly 3,207 residential units \u2014 including 305 for-sale homes and 2,902 rentals \u2014 alongside up to 350,000 square feet of office space, 420,000 square feet of retail and 250,000 square feet of hospitality uses. About 641 rental units would be set aside as affordable housing.\nThe first phase alone is projected to cost $800 million and span 1.6 million square feet, anchored by a 39-story apartment and condo tower on a triangular parcel bounded by North Southport Avenue, West Cortland and North Kingsbury streets. JDL CEO\nJim Letchinger\ndubbed it the \u201cmonument\u201d of the development.\nBut while aldermen signed off on zoning, the harder part may lie ahead.\nThe City Council has yet to approve plans for new roads, utilities and other infrastructure needed to support the historically industrial site, long plagued by congestion, according to the publication.\nUnder the 2019 Lincoln Yards redevelopment agreement, Sterling Bay was to front major infrastructure costs and be reimbursed with up to $1.3 billion in\ntax-increment financing\nonce projects were completed, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.\nAn initial\n$490 million\nworth of public infrastructure consisting of 13 City Council-approved projects were outlined for TIF reimbursement at the time,\naccording\nto city documents. Those projects included bridge extensions and viaduct work, a pedestrian and bike trail extension and various street and Chicago River sea wall improvements.\nUntangling that agreement to fit Foundry Park\u2019s smaller space remains an open question.\nAld. Brian Hopkins, whose former ward included the site, voted against the rezoning, arguing that promised improvements \u2014 including a redesign of the Elston-Ashland-Armitage intersection and two new river bridges \u2014 remain unresolved.\n\u201cAll those things that were promised to the neighborhood \u2026 and as of now, we\u2019re walking away from it,\u201d he said at the meeting.\nAld. Scott Waguespack, whose 32nd Ward now includes the site, acknowledged \u201csignificant transportation challenges,\u201d but framed the vote as a signal that Chicago can still execute large-scale projects after years of stalled deals.\nPlans include new stretches of Dominick Street and Southport Avenue, 3,000 linear feet of riverwalk and roughly 10 acres of open space. A proposed bridge connection to the 606 trail would follow a future extension of the trail.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Some rules are meant to be broken.\nConsider this message I received from an owner of rent-stabilized buildings:\n\u201cThere are countless units that have been in the same tenant\u2019s name or family for decades while their needs and family makeup have changed. For example, they have a 3 or 4 bedroom apartment for a family of 1 and perhaps 2. They will then rent the spare bedrooms for $175 to $250 per week, per room.\u201d\nThis is not the way rent stabilization is supposed to work. But is it a victimless crime? The landlord didn\u2019t think so.\n\u201cWhen the tenant has a rent-stabilized apartment for less than $1,000 [and is renting out rooms], everyone gets hurt and the leaseholder is enriched on the backs of the landlord and other people in the public who need housing for their families.\u201d\nI would say it\u2019s bad for families and good for individuals who just want to rent a room but cannot find one of the few remaining single-room occupancy buildings (a shortage that this\nCity Council bill\naims to\nchange\n).\nThe illegal renting of rooms is a consequence of a rent-stabilization system that incentivizes people to stay in large apartments long after their kids have grown up and moved out. The system practically forces them to stay because it makes vacancies scarce.\nEven if smaller, rent-stabilized units were readily available, they typically have higher rents because they turned over more often when vacancy allowed for rent increases (before the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019).\nGiven the city\u2019s housing shortage, it\u2019s better for spare bedrooms to be rented than to remain empty. But landlords should get a cut of the revenue, if for no other reason than that more tenants mean higher water bills and other operating costs.\nBringing this out into the open would also allow owners to screen room-renters, reducing the risk of nuisance tenants and squatters. Being on the lease would give subletters more rights as well.\nSome politicians might oppose this idea because they love the principle of the primary residency requirement. Reality check: It doesn\u2019t exist \u2014 because there is virtually no enforcement.\nBefore the HSTPA, enforcement was largely left to landlords; the 20 percent vacancy bonus and the chance to do a substantial individual apartment improvement gave them an incentive to evict rule-breakers.\nBut now that the law has eliminated the vacancy bonus and the opportunity to do a real IAI, owners have little incentive to police fraud as long as the tenant is paying the rent. There was no enforcement mechanism to fall back on, nor did the state bother to create one after the law changed.\nThe reader had more to say.\n\u201cThere are countless people who are not paying their rent, working off the books, getting one-shot deals (over and over again), meanwhile have the funds to go on months-long vacations to the Caribbean while wearing $250+ shoes and designer sunglasses,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThese practices are running rampant.\u201d\nNo one really knows how common they are. When I was a reporter in Sheepshead Bay in the 1990s, locals would complain to me about Russian women in fur coats and designer boots using food stamps at the supermarket. That was probably a small percentage of SNAP users, but it bothered people.\nAs I have\nwritten before\n, the perfect amount of fraud is not zero, because the enforcement regime needed to achieve zero fraud would handcuff a program for people who truly need it. But tolerating rampant fraud undercuts public support for a program. There has to be a balance.\n",

Under an agreement between the seller and the buyer, Voloridge has the right of first offer to purchase a marina that may be built at 100 and 102 North Coastal Way.\nLed by Barry Miller, Voloridge plans to develop a new building on part of its holdings, hinting at company expansion plans, including 100 to 200 new tech and other jobs, according to the firm\u2019s news release on the purchase.\nVoloridge consists of a quantitative investment management division, and a data-driven health and wellness tech division, according to the release.\nThe 1-acre 110 Front Street lot consists of a 51,600-square-foot building with offices, retail, restaurants and a garage. The 0.7-acre 115 Front Street property has a 42,300-square-foot office and retail building, property records show. The 100 North Coastal Way property is a 0.7-acre vacant lot, and the 0.5-acre lot at 102 North Coastal Way lot has a small commercial building.\nHarbourside Place, which fronts the Intracoastal Waterway, was completed in 2014. Aside from offices, retail and restaurants, it also has a hotel. Part of the project was financed with about\n$99.5 million\nfrom 199 EB-5 investors, which led to now-settled litigation filed by some of the investors.\nIn a 2020 lawsuit, the investors claimed Mastroianni and others involved in the Harbourside Place development raised the EB-5 money for a construction loan that would be repaid but \u201chad no intention of keeping their promise to repay.\u201d They also claimed he purposefully was one investor short of the $100 million raise. Mastroianni and Harbourside Place denied the allegations, countersued the investors and the lawsuits later settled.\nMastroianni also leads U.S. Immigration Fund, an EB-5 regional center in Jupiter.\nThe\nEB-5 program\ngives foreign investors a path to green cards for them and their children in exchange for at least $800,000 in investment, which is higher than the previous EB-5 threshold of $500,000.\nVoloridge\u2019s planned expansion comes as Palm Beach County is becoming an epicenter for company relocations and growth, though much of it has focused on West Palm Beach due to billionaire Steve Ross\u2019 hefty investment and development activity in the city.\nRoss, through his West Palm-based Related Ross, has tapped his New York network to help lease up his new office towers. While most activity has been by financial service firms, Ross has pressed on lately with a vision for turning Palm Beach County into a tech hub.\nIn September, Fortune 500 cloud computing firm ServiceNow pre-leased\n211,900 square feet\nat Related Ross\u2019 10 CityPlace that\u2019s under construction in downtown West Palm.\n",

The unpaid debt and costs amounted to about $38 million, or more than $200,000 a room.\nKing did not respond to requests for comment; LCP declined to comment.\nThe Real Deal\npreviously\nreported\na UCC foreclosure auction was scheduled late last year, and the lender was seeking to foreclose on the equity interests in the slim, 10-story, 178-key hotel, a block south of Hollywood Boulevard and a block north of Sunset Boulevard. King said at the time that Relevant was working on a loan recapitalization and extension with the lender.\nLCP issued a $33 million senior mortgage refinancing loan to Relevant three years ago. Relevant previously raised money via EB-5 investors, too.\nKing still owns the land underneath Tao, the restaurant nestled next to the boutique hotel that has a rooftop pool and bar. LCP is leasing the space, according to a person familiar with the situation.\nDream isn\u2019t the only hotel lost recently by King after Relevant Group\nraised\nhundreds of millions of dollars and developed three establishments \u2014 Dream, Tommie and Thompson \u2014 all in Hollywood between Selma and Wilcox avenues. King lost the latter two when the mezzanine lenders on the hotels acquired both through foreclosure in 2023, only a couple years after completion. Recent records revealed the lenders acquired the properties through credit bids via a $72 million loan for the two hotels. (The two sport different names and brands now).\nThe turn of events at Dream Hollywood is emblematic of recent troubles for the Los Angeles\u2019 hotel\nmarket\n. Numerous\nhoteliers\nare defaulting on debt and facing foreclosure, while the Measure ULA property-transfer tax has slowed commercial trades. Homelessness contributes to a dip in tourism that hurts revenues \u2014 and a $30 minimum wage for hotel workers is another spooking investors.\n",

        "content": "U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders aimed for California\u2019s class of tech titans and struck the heart of the Golden State\u2019s luxury residential real estate market in leading a rally for the proposed\n2026 Billionaire Tax Act\nthat calls for a one-time five-percent tax on the net worths of individuals exceeding $1 billion.\nThe Vermont independent, who identifies as a democratic socialist and generally operates as part of the Democratic Party in the Senate, served up some choice words\u00a0 about California\u2019s\nbillionaires\n, calling their level of wealth \u201cgrotesque\u201d and \u201coutrageous.\u201d He took particular aim at several tech executives, including Meta founder and CEO\nMark Zuckerberg\n, citing the 11 Palo Alto homes he\u2019s purchased over more than a decade as proof he can pay his \u201cfair share of taxes.\u201d\nSander\u2019s vitriol came Wednesday evening at The Wiltern Theatre, a green-tinged, Art Deco\u00a0 landmark at Wilshire Boulevard and Western Avenue in the Koreatown district of Los Angeles. The crowd included organizers engaged in gathering the 900,000 or so signatures of registered voters that will be needed to place the tax on the ballot on the November ballot.\nThe tax would apply to individuals with a net worth of $1 billion are deemed by the state to be residents of California as of Jan. 1,\n2026.\nIt would be due in 2027.\nSome of California\u2019s most famous and wealthy tech executives are pushing back, including Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who is reportedly leading an effort by a\u00a0 group called Building a Better California to head off the billionaire tax. Brin recently shelled out $42 million for a mansion on the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe\u2013which also has shoreline in California\u2013 and has offered about $50 million for a Miami Beach home,\nThe Real Deal reported\nin January.\nSanders waived off\u00a0 fears of an\nexodus of wealthy from California\nif the tax passes, calling reports of such concerns as a \u201cdisgusting\u201d advertising ploy by those looking to dodge paying their \u201cfair share.\u201d\nThe senator likened attempts by the wealthy to push back against the proposed tax as following the same playbook used by companies threatening to move overseas if their employees unionize.\n\u201cNow, whether they do it or not, I don\u2019t know. I think they lie a lot,\u201d he said.\nHe also drew a comparison to criticisms that have accompanied the rise of\u00a0 New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani, also a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, or DSA.\n\u201cAnd, by the way, when [Mayor Zohran] Mamdani was running in New York City, that\u2019s what the oligarch says, \u2018Oh, [if] Mamdani wins, we\u2019re all fleeing New York,\u201d Sanders told the crowd at the Wiltern. \u201cThey didn\u2019t and I doubt that they will flee the great state of California.\u201d\nSanders spent some time criticizing recent actions by the federal government\u2019s\u00a0 Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Minneapolis, but he didn\u2019t stray elsewhere during his roughly half hour on stage, avoiding any indication of where, if at all, he might throw his weight in the city\u2019s mayoral race.\nWhile Sanders endorsed 4th District City Councilmember member\nNithya Raman\nin an upset victory of an incumbent to win her seat\u00a0 2020, who is backed by the DSA.\u00a0 Sanders has yet to bestow his political blessing in L.A.\u2019s mayoral campaign, where Raman is bidding to unseat incumbent Mayor Karen Bass, with the June primary a first test..\nMore to come on what real estate thinks of California\u2019s proposed 2026 Billionaire Tax Act.\n",

WS Communities and Gortikov Capital sold the 60-unit Luxe Villas at 11640 Mayfield Avenue in\nBrentwood\n, while Cityview offloaded the 97-unit Haven Apartments at 11924 Washington Boulevard in\nCulver City\n.\nAt Luxe Villas,\nWS Communities\nand Gortikov Capital invested $4.1 million in renovations. The property consists largely of two-bedroom units as well as 18 co-living suites. Amenities there include a rooftop lounge, a central courtyard with seating and electric vehicle charging stations.\nCityview\ndeveloped Haven Apartments with the help of a $45 million construction loan from PNC Bank. The property, opened in 2019, includes 13,183 square feet of ground-floor retail space below studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments averaging 1,044 square feet.\nTruAmerica intends to maintain the existing buildings, Wes LaBar, the company\u2019s head of acquisitions, told Multi-Housing News. The company is one of the largest multifamily owners in the U.S., holding roughly 65,000 apartments across more than 35 markets in 16 states. TruAmerica is no stranger to Los Angeles, having owned and managed more than 6,700 units across 47 properties in L.A.

The amount of multifamily units sold in L.A. County increased in both 2024 and 2025 since hitting a post-pandemic low in 2023, according to a fourth-quarter\nreport\nfrom Kidder Mathews. Almost 30,000 units across L.A.

The firm\u2019s Stuart Wernick, Drew Garrison, Geoff Smith and Mike Dunsheath put together the refinancing.\nDallas-based GenCap built the 372-unit property on 16 acres at 4103 Rogers Road last year. The loan works out to $125,000 per unit. Park at Westover Hills features one-, two- and three-bedroom units with private yards. In terms of amenities, the property includes a golf simulator, coffee bar, pool and dog parks.\nWhen GenCap took on the project, the developer noted that the development site\u2019s terrain would create a challenge.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one big rock hill,\u201d GenCap\u2019s Mark Johnson said at the time. \u201cThere\u2019s about six inches of dirt and the rest of it is rock. There\u2019s a lot of dirt work required to get this project going.\u201d\nBut the firm persisted, largely due to the property\u2019s prime location in a major growth corridor.\nThe property is in San Antonio\u2019s Far West submarket, about 17 miles northwest of Downtown San Antonio. It\u2019s near SeaWorld and Alamo Ranch, the city\u2019s largest master-planning community and a hotspot for growth. Work on that community started around 2005 after the Cordi Marian Sisters sold about 160 acres to developers Walt Busby and Brad Galo.\nAlamo Ranch\u2019s population\njumped more than 50 percent between 2018 and 2025 from 53,000 residents to 82,000, according to data from Texas Demographics.\nThe area\u2019s rapid growth also shields projects like this from the region\u2019s\nsluggish multifamily market\n, which is plagued by oversupply.\nLike other Texas metros, San Antonio\u2019s new multifamily supply has put downward pressure on rents. Monthly rents were down 2.5 percent, year-over-year, in the third quarter of 2025, to $1,240, according to a report from Cushman &amp; Wakefield.\n",

Slated for the 1.2-acre site at 400 Biscayne Boulevard, the project is set to rise 850 feet, or 90 stories with 421 units.\nPMG\u2019s Ryan Shear said the development will likely take about five years to complete. Supertalls, due to their height, are more complex construction projects and take longer to build than other kinds of developments. Shear acknowledged the longer timeline can leave developers open to more risk.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why development is true gambling,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not pouring concrete today.\u201d\nDespite others\u2019 concerns about possible oversaturation in the market, Shear said PMG sees this as a prime moment to launch its second supertall.\n\u201cThe metrics all make sense to us,\u201d he said.\nPMG Residential will lead the sales and marketing effort kicking off in March, with prices starting at $800,000, the release shows.\nThe supertall\u2019s design team includes Carlos Ott, Cube 3 and interiors firm Meyer Davis. Units will span from studios to three bedrooms, and amenities in the tower will include a fitness center, a pool and spa facilities through the hotel\u2019s The Source by Delano wellness program, the release states. The project will also have a Delano Members\u2019 Club and Delano Rose Bar.\nPMG bought the Biscayne Boulevard site for\n$53.6 million\nin 2017, three years after buying the adjacent Waldorf Astoria site for\n$80 million\n.\nThe original Delano at 1685 Collins Avenue is one of Miami Beach\u2019s iconic Art Deco hotels. First opened in 1947, it became a hub of nightlife and celebrity after a mid-1990s renovation by architect Philippe Starck. The hotel, owned by a partnership of Accor\u2019s Ennismore and Cain International\u2019s Eldridge Industries, closed during the pandemic in 2020, and is slated to reopen this year, according to published reports.\nEnnismore is looking to expand the Delano brand to New York and London,\nHotel Dive\nreported this fall.\nHospitality branding has played a key role in Miami\u2019s current condo boom and PMG\u2019s own portfolio in the region. It landed\na $668 million construction loan\nfor the Waldorf Astoria supertall in 2024, which is set to be complete in 2028.",

        "content": "Disgraced attorney and fixer Mark Nussbaum is turning against his former friend and deal partner as creditors seek to collect more than $400 million in missing escrow funds.\nSheldon Eisenberger, an attorney handling the wind-down and liquidation of Nussbaum\u2019s former law firms, has launched a lawsuit against nursing home entrepreneur and Nussbaum\u2019s former friend Tzali Chopp of Opal Healthcare.\nThe lawsuit filed in the Southern District of New York alleges Chopp failed to pay back a $3 million loan from Nussbaum. Eisenberger now alleges Chopp owes $6.3 million with interest.\nWhatsapp messages between Nussbaum and Chopp included in the lawsuit offer a rare window into\nNussbaum\u2019s business.\nNussbaum has admitted to running a Ponzi scheme with his associate\nMendel Steiner\n. Part of the scheme involved using Nussbaum\u2019s escrow funds to lend money to real estate dealmakers as short-term loans.\nThe messages illustrate Nussbaum\u2019s nonchalance when it came to extending loans or making investments. Some messages show that Nussbaum lent money first and asked questions later.\n[6/8/22, 12:21:44\u202fPM] Tzally Chopp: I needed originally 3.5 u gave me like 2.3 need another million and I\u2019m good\n[6/8/22, 12:22:44\u202fPM] \u00a0 Mark Nussbaaum: not sure i can do another MM, and i need to understand how money coming back, etc., can we speak at 2?\nOthers show that Chopp appears to request proof of funds for his company, Opal Healthcare, in an unrelated deal. (Nussbaum used a tactic called show capital where he would provide short term loans to make borrowers look capitalized).\n[8/11/22, 1:42:55\u202fPM] Tzally Chopp: Please send me letter saying opal Hcs has 15M\nfor operating ty if this works I make crazy money\n[8/11/22, 1:46:04\u202fPM] Nussbaum: and you will remember that i helped you so i can make some crazy money also, yes?\nNussbaum diverted about\n$336 million\nof his clients\u2019 escrow money through to late Brooklyn-based investor Mendel Steiner who allegedly moved money through his shell companies and his family, lawsuits allege.\nBut tens of millions went to\nother real estate dealmakers\n, including Boruch Drillman, Shaya Prager and Mark Meisner, usually as loans or preferred equity. Eisenberger is tasked with collecting on those outstanding debts in order to help pay the creditors back.\nCollecting from these debtors will be a challenge given Nussbaum\u2019s penchant for handshake deals and lack of formal record keeping.\nFor instance, Chopp\u2019s attorneys allege the $3 million in alleged loans which Eisenberger seeks to collect on are usurious and unenforceable. Chopp\u2019s attorneys, who declined to comment, allege the interest on the loans amounted to 35.7 percent of the alleged principal loan account, which is beyond the legal limit of 25 percent.\nEisenberger, who is known as the assignee in the process, \u201cis unable to challenge this basic math, so instead offers inadmissible testimony from the disgraced and now indicted attorney Mark Nussbaum,\u201d Chopp\u2019s attorneys claim in a legal filing.\nIn response Eisenberger\u2019s team denies the loans were usurious. Eisenberger alleges Chopp made a $120,000 payment on the loans, which specifically went to paying accrued interest.\nTo further support their argument, Eisenberger\u2019s legal team included a statement from Nussbaum.\nNussbaum said he met Chopp at his house in Suffern, New York in 2022 and reached an agreement to provide up to $3 million revolving line of credit to Chopp through four transactions at a 2 percent monthly rate.\nNussbaum claims he made the loans to Chopp through various accounts. This included $1 million from a Nussbaum Lowinger bank account to Opal Healthcare WI, a nursing home venture in Wisconsin controlled by Chopp. (Opal Holdings\u2019 Shaya Prager, known for his controversial ground lease structure, has ties to the venture as well, based on lawsuits and public records).\nThe WhatsApp messages between Nussbaum and Chopp clearly show the two setting up meetings at Nussbaum\u2019s house and other locations.\n[8/18/24, 12:18:17\u202fPM] Nussbaum: When can we speak. Happy to meet also. Need to get comfortable with September.\n[8/19/24, 11:08:15\u202fAM] Nussbaum: lmk pls\n[8/19/24, 11:08:53\u202fAM] Tzally Chopp: Meet Friday in Monsey on the way up to Catskills\n[8/19/24, 11:09:02\u202fAM] Nussbaum: DEAL! \ud83d\ude42\n[8/19/24, 11:09:08\u202fAM] Tzally Chopp: Ty\n[8/19/24, 11:09:16\u202fAM] Nussbaum: lmk when, appreciate, miss u anyway, been too long\nAND pls bring tefilin! \ud83d\ude42\n[8/23/24, 8:27:10\u202fAM] Nussbaum: Lmk when we meeting.

And now after telling\nthem I am meeting you Friday I look like an ass. And now they asking me how the\nmeeting went\nNussbaum continued to reach out to Chopp about a \u201cdebt\u201d throughout 2024, carrying on their chummy rapport.\n[9/17/24, 3:56:33\u202fPM] Nussbaum: How we looking?\n[9/18/24, 6:32:19\u202fPM] Nussbaum: Lmk\n[9/19/24, 3:00:54\u202fPM] Nussbaum: talk to me bro\n[9/19/24, 3:03:20\u202fPM] Tzally Chopp: Looking good call u tomorrow\n[9/19/24, 3:03:33\u202fPM] Nussbaum: ty bHHHHH\n[9/23/24, 8:49:07\u202fAM] Nussbaum: When can we speak?\nJust a few months later, Nussbaum and Steiner\u2019s alleged Ponzi scheme started to unravel as Nussbaum faced a gaping deficit owed to his escrow clients. Nussbaum shut down his law firm Nussbaum Lowinger in January 2025 days after Steiner died by suicide in a Manhattan hotel room. In May, the Manhattan District Attorney indicted Nussbaum alleging he stole over $15 million from clients\u2019 escrow accounts. Nussbaum has pleaded not guilty. His next court date is scheduled for March 3.\nClick above to view the full lawsuit\n",

        "content": "Half a decade after retreating from Chicago\u2019s most famous shopping strip, Gap is plotting a return to the Magnificent Mile.\nThe San Francisco-based apparel chain is in advanced talks to lease 8,325 square feet at 700 North Michigan Avenue,\naccording\nto CoStar News. The deal isn\u2019t finalized and could still fall apart, but if completed it would mark a symbolic comeback for a retailer that once anchored the corridor with a three-level flagship at 555 North Michigan.\nGap\u2019s prospective new home is a former T-Mobile space at the base of a 49-story residential tower at 100 East Huron Street. The building\u2019s other retail tenants include Saks Fifth Avenue and Zara. New York-based\nAshkenazy Acquisitions\nand Aurora Capital Associates own the property.\nIn September, the joint venture had to pay $65 million to lender Aareal Capital Corporation in order to keep the retail spot known as the Chicago Place Mall, according to property records. As previously\nreported\nin\nThe Real Deal\n, Aareal in turn extended a new $33 million senior mortgage loan against the 300,000-square-foot property.\nThe move would add to a string of recent leases along the one-mile stretch of North Michigan Avenue, which has been clawing back from pandemic-era vacancies and unrest. Availability is projected to fall to 23.5 percent by the end of 2026, down from a peak of 33.9 percent early last year, according to a Kirsch Agency report cited by CoStar.\nGap would be the latest boomerang tenant. Spanish retailer Mango and Japanese fashion brand Uniqlo have also committed to large new spaces after previously exiting the avenue. Aritzia\nbackfilled\nGap\u2019s former flagship, while a Harry Potter-themed store, Alo Yoga, Intimissimi and Falconeri have all inked deals in recent leasing cycles.\nThe contrast with early 2021 is stark. Gap shuttered its store at 555 North Michigan in January of that year, part of the San Francisco-based parent company\u2019s nationwide plan to close 350 Gap and Banana Republic stores. The exit came as Michigan Avenue tourism stalled during the pandemic, and retailers grappled with waves of property damage and theft following the murder of George Floyd. Macy\u2019s also closed its\nWater Tower Place\nanchor around the same time.\nPlenty of hurdles remain for a full comeback in the shopping corridor, including stubborn vacancies at Water Tower Place and the Shops at North Bridge.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The one-story building was previously home to vegan eatery Zen Bakery.\nRBM\u2019s plans call for 85 studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments above 3,268 square feet of ground-floor retail space as well as a rooftop amenity deck and parking for 72 vehicles. The developer is requesting entitlements including Opportunity Corridor incentives that would allow a larger structure than zoning rules would typically permit. In exchange, 15 of the new apartments would be designated for rent by very-low-income households. In Los Angeles County, very-low-income is\ncategorized\nas making less than $53,000 annually, or $75,750 for a household of four.\nThe section of Pico Boulevard around the proposed site has other new developments in the works. One 207-unit development complete with retail is set to rise on a long-vacant parcel across the street from 10990 West Pico Boulevard. Another recently opened next to the former Westside Pavilion mall, which itself is headed for new life as the\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\n\u2019 Research Park.\nRBM of California\nis no stranger to Los Angeles\u2019 Westside. The subsidiary of Japanese real estate investment firm Residence Building Management Company has developed mixed-use projects in Mid-Wilshire and Palms in the past, according to Urbanize.\nThe firm is currently building a five-story apartment structure at 11250 La Grange Avenue in Sawtelle, complete with 38 two- and three-bedroom apartments above a 100-car subterranean parking garage. That project, similar to 10990 West Pico Boulevard, utilizes\ndensity bonus incentives\nto permit a larger structure than allowed by zoning rules in exchange for setting aside five apartments for very-low-income renters.\nRBM of California is also building more residences near Rancho Park at 2107-2121 South Westwood Boulevard in West Los Angeles. The project will feature 92 studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments above roughly 1,500 square feet of ground-floor retail and a 125-vehicle parking garage. The development also takes advantage of density bonus incentives to permit a larger structure than allowed by zoning rules in exchange for eight affordable apartments.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Saks Global Enterprises\nis hoping to stop a shutdown of its Palo Alto location by Simon Property Group.\nSimon is looking to seize control of the\nSaks Fifth Avenue store\nat the Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto, claiming Saks didn\u2019t pay rent and other costs before the company went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month, Bloomberg\nreported\n. In addition to the Palo Alto outpost, Simon is also looking to shutter a Saks Off Fifth discount store at an outlet mall in Woodbury, New York.\nOn Monday, Saks responded in a court filing claiming that its agreements regarding the store allow the firm time to pay back any rent it allegedly owes, as well as any potential missed payments related to taxes, utilities and maintenance in common areas. Saks also believes it has the additional protection of bankruptcy to keep Simon from disrupting its business operations. Saks senior noteholders and a committee representing the retailer\u2019s unsecured creditors are supporting the company\u2019s efforts in stopping Simon\u2019s request.\nThe move to stop Simon\u2019s Palo Alto shutdown comes after Saks announced earlier this month that it was closing more than 10 percent of its full-price stores across the U.S. as it works to restructure in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Nearly all of its Saks Off Fifth discount stores\nhave been closed\n.\n\u201cSimon has decided that it can make more money on certain of the leases by re-letting them at higher rates,\u201d Saks said in its court filing. In forcing Saks to shut down two currently operating stores, Simon would hurt its business and prevent \u201cany possibility of selling these valuable leases\u201d to raise money that would benefit all company creditors.\nSimon argues that Saks was required to vacate its Palo Alto store by Jan. 18, days after Saks Global sought bankruptcy protection. The retail property owner claims Saks Global owes at least $5.7 million tied to the two sites.\nThe unsecured creditors committee said Saks\u2019 leases weren\u2019t properly terminated by Simon before the bankruptcy filing. Simon believes it still should have the power to take back the Palo Alto store despite the Chapter 11 filing and Saks\u2019 bankruptcy stay because the lease was terminated shortly before the retailer sought court protection.\nSaks and Simon worked in partnership prior to\nSaks\u2019 bankruptcy filing\nlast month. In December 2024, Simon invested $100 million for Saks Global\u2019s acquisition of Neiman Marcus. Saks Global is Simon\u2019s sixth-largest anchor tenant by leased square footage nationally.\nSimon\u2019s request will be reviewed by a Texas bankruptcy judge overseeing Saks\u2019 Chapter 11 case at a to-be-determined date.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The 1.5 million-square-foot property, originally built for Motorola in 1984 and later operated by Freescale Semiconductor, has served as NXP\u2019s U.S. headquarters since it acquired Freescale in 2015.\nNXP\nsaid its search for new space \u201cwas driven by the need to modernize and create a vibrant environment that enhances how we work and engage.\u201d The lease has already been communicated to Austin employees, a company spokesperson told the outlet, and declined to comment on a potential campus sale.\nCBRE\u2019s Trey Low is marketing the Oak Hill site, though it does not appear to be publicly listed. The property was most recently appraised at $43 million, according to the Travis Central Appraisal District. No sale has been recorded as of mid-February.\nThe shift marks a notable reversal. In 2023, the Austin City Council approved incentives tied to a planned $291 million investment to expand NXP\u2019s two local campuses. That agreement was terminated earlier this year, according to published reports.\nNXP\u2019s recalibration comes amid broader changes. The company reported $3.2 billion in third-quarter revenue in October, down 2 percent, year-over-year, and announced plans in December to shutter a\nPhoenix-area manufacturing facility\n. It employed about 4,000 people in Austin as of last March, ranking among the city\u2019s\nlargest tech employers\n.\nSouthwest Austin\u2019s Oak Hill \u2014 where the chipmaker is selling its current home \u2014 remains one of the metro\u2019s tighter submarkets, with 14.1 percent vacancy in the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to roughly 25 percent metro-wide, according to CBRE. If NXP ultimately vacates the campus, it would put a 1.5 million-square-foot question mark in one of Austin\u2019s more resilient corridors.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A jury handed down a nearly $8.7 million verdict in a shoddy construction lawsuit over a Dania Beach apartment building, though an attorney in the case said claims had already settled during the trial.\nA Broward County jury determined AHS Development Group and Resia Construction were negligent and violated the Florida Building Code in a seven-story development, The Palace at Dania Beach at 180 East Dania Beach Boulevard, according to the verdict issued on Friday.\nReal estate investor Guillermina Dawson\u2019s trust bought the 144-unit property for\n$38 million\nin 2018, a year after Resia Construction and AHS Development completed development.\nDawson\u2019s affiliates Dawson Operations and Dawson Johnson Operations sued AHS Development and Resia Construction in 2023 over alleged latent defects to the garage, roof, balconies, walls and pool room, which caused \u201cpremature deterioration\u201d to other areas of the building, according to the complaint.\nThe Dawson entities retained Hollywood-based engineering firm VLC One in 2022 to inspect the property. The engineering firm found defects with metal HVAC stands, floors, walls, waterproofing and the steel canopy in the roof, according to court filings. VLC estimated it would cost $10.4 million to fix the defects, Dawson alleged.\nAHS Development and Resia denied any wrongdoing, arguing in part that any building defects were due to the landlord\u2019s lack of maintenance, according to court filings. AHS and Resia then sued 13 subcontractors and other firms that had worked on the project.\nIn its verdict, the jury assigned 49 percent of the negligence to AHS Development, 50 percent to Resia Construction, and 1 percent to concrete subcontractor Pre-Cast Specialties. The jury found no fault with the project\u2019s architect.\nThe jury pegged damages at $3.8 million for the building\u2019s concrete, $2.3 million for HVAC stands, $1.4 million for handrails, and nearly $274,200 for the roof canopy, according to the verdict. It also included $770,800 for miscellaneous items such as taxes and fees.\nBut by the time the verdict came down on Friday, the Dawson entities and AHS Development and Resia Construction had come to an agreement, said Gabriel Saade, an attorney for AHS and Resia.\nThe details of the settlement agreement weren\u2019t disclosed.\nRoger Brown and William Lewis, the Morgan &amp; Morgan attorneys for the Dawson entities, declined to comment on the settlement, saying the claims \u201chave been amicably resolved.\u201d\nSubcontractors \u201cwere not responsible\u201d for the defects and violations, Lewis and Brown said they argued at the trial, and the jury placed 99 percent of the responsibility for negligence on AHS Residential and Resia Construction.\nThe verdict was for 100 percent of the Dawson entities\u2019 alleged damages, Lewis said.\nAttorneys for Pre-Cast didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nConstruction defects lawsuits are common in South Florida. Last month, the association for the 60-story, 249-unit Missoni Baia conto tower in Miami\u2019s Edgewater\nsued\ndeveloper OKO Group, led by billionaire Vlad Doronin, as well as the general contractor, architects and subcontractors over alleged construction defects.\nLast year, The Seminole Tribe of Florida\nsued\nMiami-based homebuilding giant Lennar for allegedly building 465 defective homes on tribal land across Florida.\n",

The project would include 300 apartments, with 20 percent set aside as affordable under the city\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance, Block Club Chicago first\nreported\n.\nCity leaders framed the proposal as a transit-oriented development in a part of downtown that has struggled to regain its retail footing. The site is close to the CTA\u2019s Harold Washington Library and Jackson stations, allowing the developer to take advantage of an ordinance passed last July eliminating parking minimums near public transit. Despite 300 units, the building would include just 60 parking spaces.\n\u201cIn addition to bringing 300 mixed-income units to a key transit node downtown, the project aligns with Central Area Plan strategies to revitalize the southern part of the State Street shopping corridor,\u201d planning commissioner Ciere Boatright said in a statement.\nBeyond apartments, the building would include ground-floor retail, restaurant space and coworking space.\nChicago-based DL3\nalso pledged $1.5 million in upgrades to nearby Pritzker Park at State and Van Buren streets, including a new performance space, improved lighting and public art.\nThe Plymouth Court site is not part of the city\u2019s\nLaSalle Street Reimagined\ninitiative, which offers tax increment financing support but requires 30 percent affordability. DL3 is already involved in that program through its work with Chicago-based Riverside Investment &amp; Development and New York-based AmTrust on the property at 135 South\nLaSalle Street\n. While this parcel is outside a TIF district, the developer could pursue a $5 million community development grant, according to the planning department.\nDL3 CEO\nLeon Walker\ntold the publication that the project will include live-work duplex lofts aimed at emerging entrepreneurs, a model the firm piloted at its Thrive Englewood development. He described the site \u2014 adjacent to the Standard Club at 320 South Plymouth Court, which recently ceased operating as a migrant shelter \u2014 as a \u201cdiamond in the rough.\u201d\nBacked by Alderman Lamont Robinson, the proposal is expected to clear the City Council\u2019s zoning committee and full council.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Nick Mastroianni\u2019s U.S. Immigration Fund claims entities tied to Fortress Investment Group and L&amp;L Holding Company wrongly transferred control of a 46-story tower in Times Square and are now personally on the hook for upwards of $890 million.\nUSIF on Wednesday filed a lawsuit against various Fortress entities and L&amp;L, claiming that the developers violated terms of a mezzanine loan agreement when they\ntransferred\ncontrol of\nTSX Broadway\nto a group of lenders led by Goldman Sachs in 2024.\nUnder the loan agreement, the developers needed prior written consent from USIF before making such a move, according to the lawsuit. Failing that, the developers triggered a \u201cbad boy\u201d guarantee holding the Fortress and L&amp;L entities personally liable for a $520 million loan, plus at least $370 million in interest and an unspecified amount of damages, the complaint alleges.\nA spokesperson for Fortress said the firm believes the lawsuit is \u201cwithout merit.\u201d L&amp;L and Goldman declined to comment.\nUSIF, which pooled funds raised through \u200b\u200bthe\ncash-for-visas EB-5 program\nto provide the mezzanine loan, claims that the borrowers have failed to make interest payments since May 2023.\nThe developers received a $1.1 billion construction loan from Goldman in 2018. The mixed-used building at 1568 Broadway was completed in 2024. It features a Hilton-branded Tempo hotel, 75,000 square feet of retail space and the Palace Theatre.\nWhen Fortress and L&amp;L failed to repay their mezzanine loan by its July 2023 maturity date, USIF\nindicated\nthat it would either sell the debt or bring on a new partner.\nThe lawsuit alleges that USIF was \u201clulled and misled\u201d into thinking that as the developers struggled to repay their debt, they were trying to restructure the project\u2019s entire financing package.\nInstead, the developers were quietly working to hand the keys to Goldman to avoid foreclosure and tens of millions of dollars in transfer taxes, which would have otherwise kicked in.\nThe developers and Goldman inked an amendment to their loan agreement in December 2023 that added provisions allowing the lender to move forward with a deed or assignment in lieu of foreclosure of the property. They also signed a management transition agreement permitting Goldman to name a new manager of the building.\nThat management agreement was held in escrow until it was released and became effective in August 2024, according to the lawsuit. USIF claims it was kept in the dark and simply provided redacted documents that hid the true nature of the amended loan agreement.\nIt\u2019s unclear if Fortress and L&amp;L have yet executed the deed-in-lieu documents. As for the management agreement, the lawsuit points to a\nBloomberg\nstory from 2024, which reported that after failing to repay the senior lender, a consortium of lenders led by Goldman took control of the building and named SL Green Realty as manager.\nUSIF alleges, citing intel from a \u201cformer senior officer of Fortress,\u201d that the deal with Goldman was \u201cdesigned and implemented in order to deprive [USIF] of their bargained-for rights.\u201d\nFortress is involved with USIF in other projects. The company is part of a joint venture\ndeveloping the remaining sites at Pacific Park in Brooklyn\n, though they, alongside Greenland USA, do not have an active role in managing the project.\n",

The property is on empty desert land northeast of the Lancaster city center.\nJensen plans to build a 400,000-square-foot precast concrete manufacturing facility on the property at the corner of 30th Street East and East Avenue G. Proficiency Capital will serve as the developer of the project. Construction on the project \u2014 bolstered by undisclosed financing from 3G Capital Partners \u2014 is expected to begin by the end of next month with completion slated for March 2027.\nJensen opted to build in Lancaster partially due to \u201cthe City of\nLancaster\n\u2019s pro-business and pro-jobs approach and its logistical proximity to L.A.,\u201d JLL\u2019s Hunter McDonald, who represented Jensen in the transaction, told CO, calling Jensen\u2019s investment \u201ca testament to the dynamic Southern California economy.\u201d\nMore developers are looking into the Antelope Valley, home to Lancaster in north Los Angeles County, as the Inland Empire deals with low vacancy rates. Overall, the Antelope Valley is one of the smallest industrial markets in L.A. County with roughly 8.3 million square feet of existing inventory. Yet, the\nAntelope Valley\nhas the most projects in the pipeline by far in the county with nearly 1.3 million square feet in development, per Avison Young data cited by CO. The forthcoming projects should help alleviate the area\u2019s space shortage, as the Antelope Valley has by far the highest direct vacancy rate in L.A.

The RealReal confirmed it is opening a \u201creimagined\u201d flagship at 253 Post Street on Feb. 26, according to the Chronicle.\nThe RealReal\u2019s outpost will comprise two stories selling clothing, jewelry and watches and offer consignor appointments for shoppers. The six-story 253 Post Street sold last October to an affiliate of Beverly Hills-based investor\nBijan Chadorchi\nfor $30.5 million. The RealReal\u2019s decision to reopen is a result of its \u201coptimism and confidence in the city\u2019s long-term vitality,\u201d Rati Sahi Levesque, CEO of The RealReal, said in a statement, per the Chronicle.\nAT&amp;T and The RealReal\u2019s returns are two of the instances of companies reopening locations in the San Francisco market after closing their doors following the pandemic\u2019s outbreak. Last year, H&amp;M returned to its same space in Stonestown Galleria mall that it shuttered in 2022. Uniqlo, which departed the Powell Street area in 2021, is slated to come back at 101 Market Street, a few blocks away from its former flagship.\nAs retailers and shoppers return to Union Square, the area has seen an uptick in leasing and foot traffic as well as free outdoor events planned throughout the year, according to the Chronicle. Popular toy store Pop Mart, Dandelion Chocolate and Bourbon Steak have all recently broken into the Union Square market. Japanese streetwear brand Bape is set to join the ranks of retailers in the area with a lease at 216 Stockton Street.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A prominent Central Texas developer is seeking breathing room from its lenders.\nSan Antonio-based Casey Development, led by CEO Darren Casey, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Feb. 2 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas. The case ropes in 31 affiliated entities that control a mix of multifamily, retail and other properties across the state, with roughly $196 million in debt tied to the portfolio, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe filing came after Randolph-Brooks Federal Credit Union and Fifth Third Bank issued default acceleration notices on loans totaling about $7.4 million and $44.6 million, respectively. Most of the debt is backed by properties in the San Antonio and Austin areas and is personally guaranteed by\nCasey\n.\nJefferson Bank, American National Insurance Company and FirstBank Southwest are also among the developer\u2019s largest creditors, according to the outlet.\nIn court last week, Garrick Smith of Munsch Hardt Kopf &amp; Harr, representing Casey, told Judge Edward Morris that a confluence of factors pushed the firm into bankruptcy. He cited shifting economic conditions in\nCentral and South Texas\n, construction delays, rising costs and funding challenges. Softening effective rents and increased concessions in the multifamily market added pressure to cash flow.\n\u201cObviously there\u2019s been in Central and South Texas some lower effective rates and concessions that have had to be made, as the market has shifted,\u201d Smith said, adding that the goal is a \u201cglobal solution\u201d to avoid piecemeal foreclosures and further acceleration notices.\nThe court agreed to consolidate the 31 entities into a single proceeding, a move that could\nstreamline negotiations\nbut also heightens tension among lenders with exposure to stronger assets, according to the publication.\nKenneth Ottaviano, counsel for Fifth Third Bank, objected to Casey\u2019s request to use cash collateral to cover administrative expenses, warning it would amount to robbing \u201cPeter to pay Paul.\u201d The bank argued that cash-flow-positive properties tied to its loans should not subsidize weaker entities. Judge Morris ultimately allowed the use of cash to pay staff, taxes and other obligations over Fifth Third\u2019s objections.\nCasey has enlisted Douglas Brickley, managing director at Houston-based Stout Risius Ross, as chief restructuring officer.\nCasey Development was founded in 1992 and has primarily focused on projects within the\nAustin-San Antonio corridor\n. The company has either developed or acquired more than 3 million square feet of industrial, multifamily, office, retail and self storage space since 2000, according to its website.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Turnberry won initial approval in a Riviera Beach zoning case Wednesday that could make it easier for developers to construct denser buildings on the Singer Island waterfront.\nThe Aventura-based developer is planning a 200-foot-tall building with 52 condo units atop a 121-space parking pedestal on a narrow 3.3-acre lot at 3930 North Ocean Drive.\nThe development firm, controlled by the Soffer family, wants to skirt setback requirements in exchange for a payment of at least $100,000 to the city\u2019s park fund.\nTurnberry COO Aly-khan Merali said the project would provide about $7 million a year in property taxes and $2.2 million in impact fees.\nTurnberry is requesting an amendment to city code, meaning the elimination of setbacks in exchange for donations to the city would apply to other projects.\nFor something like that, the city should have public outreach and hearings on the topic, Council Member Glen Spiritis said.\n\u201cWe are just going to do this at night with a simple stroke of the pen,\u201d Spiritis said.\nThe council voted 3-2 in favor of the change, which requires a second vote to take effect.\nMost high-rises on Singer Island\u2019s waterfront are required to be set back from other properties by 20 feet on the first two floors. After that, the setbacks increase by 2 feet every story.\nThe proposed amendment would eliminate setback requirements in exchange for a donation of $50,000 for every quarter acre of open space not provided, with a minimum payment of $100,000 per project.\nTurnberry\u2019s project would have setbacks of 25 feet on the ground floor, said Hope Calhoun, an attorney for the developer. But the project needs a break from the setback requirement above the 10th floor, she said.\nThe proposed building would be shorter than its neighbors: the two 314-foot-tall Martinique buildings (completed in 1986) and the two 254-foot-tall Oasis towers (built in 2024), per city documents.\nThe city is in desperate need of more tax revenue to help pay for the $400 million estimated cost to replace Riviera Beach\u2019s defunct water plant.\n\u201cOur water rates are about to double in four years, and a lot of people in our community cannot afford it,\u201d Council Member Bruce Guyton said.\nSinger Island is a 5 mile long peninsula where home prices average $1 million, according to\nRedfin\n. Most of Singer Island is in Riviera Beach, a 9-square mile area where home prices average $505,000, per\nRedfin\n.\nTurnberry is a majority owner of\nAventura Mall\nand co-developer of a planned\n$392 million convention hotel in Miami Beach\n.\nA few other projects are being proposed on Riviera Beach\u2019 mainland, including two apartment buildings at\nMarina Village\nthat will be co-developed by The Related Group\u2019s Related Urban, and\nSobelCo\u2019s 1.2 million-square-foot\n1117 Broadway.",

        "content": "A San Francisco church is set to be foreclosed at a site once floated for housing.\nOn Thursday, lender AGP Funding REIT, the discretionary private debt fund of AGP Capital, will pursue a foreclosure auction for two neighboring parcels at 450 O\u2019Farrell Street and 474 O\u2019Farrell Street in the Tenderloin neighborhood, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nAGP Funding REIT served the Fifth Church of Christ, Scientist and\nForge Development Partners\nwith a notice of default last May for a $6.8 million loan tied to the church\u2019s land at 450 O\u2019Farrell and an adjacent parcel at 474 O\u2019Farrell owned by a Forge affiliate. AGP Funding REIT originated the $6.8 million loan in March 2022; the debt matured in January 2024. The notices said the amount of outstanding debt tied to the two pieces of land was more than $8.4 million.\nThe Fifth Church of Christ, Scientist site was previously proposed for housing. Four years ago, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors derailed the plans to redevelop the location into residences, according to CO. The church is committed to its project but is \u201cin ongoing negotiations regarding this process,\u201d Forge CEO\nRichard Hannum\ntold CO.\nThe O\u2019Farrell sites total about 0.4 acres. The church has been looking to build residences with space for a new charge on the ground floor.\nThe project started as a 13-story, 176-unit apartment building but underwent several iterations before being considered by the Planning Commission in 2021 as a group housing development with more than 300 units. Neighborhood advocates appealed the project\u2019s approval to the\nBoard of Supervisors\n, claiming the development team did not adequately assess the project\u2019s environmental impact or the neighborhood\u2019s preference for regular apartments over group housing. The board upheld the appeal.\nForge and the church sued the Board of Supervisors over its upholding of the appeal. The sides settled that lawsuit in 2023. That same year, Forge and the church secured approvals for a revised version of the 450 O\u2019Farrell project that would rise 17 stories and include 261 apartments as well as space for ground-floor retail and a new church.\nIn early 2024, Forge beefed up its plans, submitting a new proposal for a 20-story version of the project at 450 O\u2019Farrell. The city issued Forge a notice of incomplete application that March, and the application has not moved forward since then, Dan Sider, chief of staff for the San Francisco Planning Department, told the Business Times.\nWhile Forge still has approvals for the 17-story version, the developer has not broken ground at 450 O\u2019Farrell. It joins other developers who have shied away from breaking ground on new residential projects in San Francisco amid\nrising construction costs\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The diverging trendlines may be due to a constrained supply of luxury homes and a burgeoning supply of cheaper homes.\nLast year, the average median sale price in Houston\u2019s overall market was about $328,000, a slight drop from $330,000 in 2024, according to HAR. A difference of $2,000 means little to the average mortgagor, but it\u2019s a meaningful shift after years of appreciation.

        "content": "Fifty days into Zohran Mamdani\u2019s mayoralty, the real estate industry\u2019s worst fears have not been realized.\nBut give him time!\nDuring the mayor\u2019s race I wrote a bunch of columns criticizing Mamdani\u2019s simplistic or unrealistic promises, while realizing that the point of campaigns is to win. Candidates with complicated, plausible proposals tend to lose, as Hillary Clinton could tell you.\nI also felt that Mamdani would moderate his views, appoint some experienced and pro-housing people and try to govern, rather than let the Democratic Socialists of America take over City Hall, impose Sharia law and replace the Stars and Stripes at municipal buildings with Palestinian flags, as some paranoid people expected.\nIt looks like I got that right. The narrative matters to Mamdani, which is why he is resuming sweeps of homeless encampments, even if encampments were not the reason people died during the cold spell.\nWhere does all this leave real estate? Depends. If you\u2019re an office landlord, a condo developer or an agent for luxury homes, you\u2019re pretty happy. Commercial tenants are looking for space and wealthy buyers are more active than they were pre-Mamdani.\nClearly, there won\u2019t be an apocalypse.\nUnless you own a fully rent-stabilized building. Then you are at least as worried or desperate as you were before the election.\nBecause Eric Adams failed to appoint all of the Rent Guidelines Board members he could before leaving office, and reality-based member Alex Armlovich resigned Tuesday (citing a new job), Mamdani was able to bring in five of his own people and reappoint a sixth. It\u2019s reasonable to assume that they will go through the motions of considering the data, then vote to do what Mamdani wants: freeze rents.\n\u201cI trust that they will consider all the factors facing the city\u2019s rent-stabilized tenants and come to an appropriate decision,\u201d Mamdani said in\nannouncing\nthe appointments.\nThe mayor conspicuously failed to mention that they are also required by law to consider the factors facing\nlandlords\n.\nThe one \u201cowner representative\u201d he named \u2014 Maksim Wynn, who manages affordable and transitional housing development at\nProcida Development Group\n\u2014 used to work for the Department of Homeless Services and HPD. These are not landlords\u2019 favorite agencies.\nBut at least Wynn must know how the RGB\u2019s consistently below-inflation rent increases have squeezed buildings.\nMamdani bookended these appointments with a plan for \u201crental ripoff\u201d dog-and-pony shows, a threat to raise property taxes and support for reviving the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act.\nCOPA would rub salt in the wounds of owners of distressed rental properties by making them wait 105 days to sell to the highest bidder \u2014 akin to Mamdani\u2019s effort to stop the Pinnacle portfolio sale.\n\u201cOur administration looks forward to working closely with Council member [Sandy] Nurse to reintroduce and pass the legislation,\u201d a Mamdani spokesperson told\nAMNY\n.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nA housing lottery\nlisting\nfor the dozen affordable apartments Cheskel Schwimmer\u2019s 59-unit project at 554 West 46th Street says, \u201cPets up to 30 lbs are welcome, with no dangerous breeds permitted. Service animals are allowed as an exception.\u201d So if you have a dangerous service animal, that\u2019s OK. Send your thoughts on pet policies to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: In only one of the 20 largest metro areas last quarter did homes sell for more than the asking price (on average), according to Redfin: San Francisco. The AI bonanza likely had something to do with that, along with optimism spurred by the new mayor, Dan Lurie. Lurie spoke with\nTRD\nlast year for\nThe Closing\n.\nElsewhere\u2026\nWill Islip Town, Nassau County and New York state manage to develop the land between the Ronkonkoma Long Island Rail Road station and MacArthur Airport? Not if they repeat the government infighting that has kept the Nassau Hub mostly vacant for years.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a glaring example of what not to do in Nassau,\u201d Islip Town Supervisor Angie Carpenter\ntold Newsday\n. Ed Blumenfeld is one of several developers interested in the transit-oriented site. A mixed-use project would complement the spiffy new\nStation Yards development\n, which Tritec Real Estate and Olayan Group are building on the other side of the tracks.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$9.4 million\nfor a 4,888-square-foot, sponsor-sale townhouse at 40 East End Avenue in Yorkville. Leighton Candler and Jennifer Reardon with Corcoran had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$143 million\nfor a 47,880-square-foot development site at 250 Water Street in the Financial District.\nThe Real Deal\nreported\non the trade by Seaport Entertainment Group to Tavros Capital in August.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$20 million\nfor a 2,500-square-foot condo at 110 Central Park South. James Jeffrey Schoenfeld of Compass has\nthe listing\n. The property last traded for\n$9.6 million\nin 2007.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permits filed were for a proposed 66,170-square-foot, five-story school at 2970 Third Avenue in Melrose. De-Jan Lu filed the permit on behalf of Shimon Kleinman of Borough Developers.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

Sellers repay the loan when the home closes, with no upfront fees.\n@properties\nis joining several major brokerages that offer such a service in conjunction with the financial technology firm Notable. Notable has partnerships with Redfin, Compass, FirstTeam Real Estate and others to offer loans for pre-listing renovations.\nThe program is partially a response to the\ndemands of buyers\n, who are increasingly looking for turnkey homes and are willing to spend more to avoid renovations. Bonnie Hawksworth, an agent with @properties in Northwest Indiana, said the program gives agents more confidence to suggest improvements without feeling like they are just adding to a seller\u2019s to-do list.\n\u201cFirst impressions count, and if you can help a client to make their home look good when buyers are there looking, then I think it\u2019s a great resource for that,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not just suggesting all of these changes and making the burden on the seller, you\u2019re offering that solution to help them pay for it.\u201d\n@properties co-founder and co-CEO Mike Golden said in the release that the program gives agents a tool to win listings, and helps sellers prepare their homes for the market.\n\u201cProviding fast, easy access to capital removes one of the biggest barriers to bringing a listing to market in optimal condition,\u201d Golden said in a statement.\nThrough the Concierge program, sellers with homes listed up to $4 million can borrow a maximum of $50,000, or 10 percent of the list price, whichever amount is less. Unlike a standard home equity line of credit, borrowers don\u2019t need to make principal or interest payments until the property sells, the release says.\nThe loan terms specify the loan must be repaid if the property doesn\u2019t sell within 12 months or the seller ends the listing agreement.\nAfter approval, sellers receive funds through a debit card, cash or check and can choose their own vendors for improvements, according to the release.\nNotable Chief Revenue Officer Amorah Sandberg said improvements financed by the company lead to 31 percent faster home sales and 9 percent higher prices on average, with about a four times return on the seller\u2019s investment. She said loans are often used \u201con the high [return on investment] improvements\u201d that can affect a buyer\u2019s perception and lead to a sale, like painting, staging, landscaping, flooring and other light cosmetic upgrades.\n\u201cMost people want a home that\u2019s move-in ready,\u201d Hawksworth said. \u201cStaged homes, or homes that present really well, they spend less time on the market, and they sell for a higher price.\u201d\nLast year, Notable partnered with Redfin to provide loans through Redfin\u2019s similarly named Concierge program. The company has provided more than $1 billion in credit to 36,000 homeowners through its lending program, according to the release.\nIn September, Notable said it raised $6 million in funding led by W.R. Berkley Corporation with participation from Second Century Ventures, the venture capital arm of the National Association of Realtors.\n",

        "content": "Indiana lawmakers are moving quickly to poach the Chicago Bears.\nOn Thursday, the Indiana House Ways and Means Committee voted 24-0 to create a Northwest Indiana stadium authority empowered to issue bonds to finance, construct and lease a new stadium for the NFL franchise near Wolf Lake in Hammond. The Chicago Tribune\nreported\nthat the proposal, sponsored by Republican House Speaker Todd Huston, now advances as GOP leaders in Indianapolis press what they\u2019ve framed as a generational economic opportunity for \u201cThe Region,\u201d referring to Northwest Indiana.\nThe authority would acquire land and tap local tax revenue to support a publicly financed stadium just across the Illinois border. Under the framework outlined by Huston,\nthe Bears\nwould contribute $2 billion toward construction costs, while Indiana would issue bonds backed by Hammond\u2019s admissions tax and a professional sports development area tax district.\nThe state used a similar structure to finance Lucas Oil Stadium for the\nIndianapolis Colts\n, appropriating funds in its budget to reassure bondholders, while relying on stadium-related tax revenue to cover debt service. Huston said the state also plans to renegotiate its lease of the Indiana Toll Road to support infrastructure improvements. Lake and Porter counties would be asked to adopt a 1 percent food and beverage tax, and Lake County a 5 percent innkeepers tax.\nThe Bears called the Indiana vote \u201cthe most meaningful step forward in our stadium planning efforts to date,\u201d though\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker\nsaid the team later characterized the statement as a sign of ongoing negotiations, not a relocation decision.\nHammond Mayor Thomas McDermott\u2019s pitch is straightforward: a 20-minute drive from Soldier Field \u2014 the Bear\u2019s current stadium in Chicago \u2014 a built-in fan base and what he called a \u201conce-in-a-generation\u201d chance to anchor regional development.\nPritzker said he was \u201csurprised, dismayed and very disappointed,\u201d noting that his staff and legislators had just met with team representatives for three hours to discuss legislation that could facilitate a new $2 billion stadium in the Northwest Chicago suburb of\nArlington Heights\n.\nHours earlier, an Illinois House committee canceled a scheduled hearing on a bill that would allow the Bears or another megaproject developer to negotiate long-term property tax agreements with local taxing bodies \u2014 a mechanism the team has said it needs to privately finance a stadium in the northwest suburbs.\nPritzker has maintained that Illinois won\u2019t pay for a stadium, though he has expressed support for up to $855 million in infrastructure funding. Meanwhile, some Chicago lawmakers have insisted the team address more than $500 million in remaining debt from the 2003 renovation of Soldier Field before leaving the city.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The center, built in the early 1980s along North Collins Street south of I-30, is anchored by tenants including Studio Movie Grill, Office Depot and Olive Garden, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nUnder the deal,\nTrademark\nmust invest at least $100 million \u2014 excluding tenant costs \u2014 in exchange for up to $24.48 million in infrastructure grants paid out between 2026 and 2031. Site work must begin by Sept. 30 and reach substantial completion by Jan. 31, 2030.\nThe\nredevelopment\nwould include upgrades to infrastructure, facades, parking lots and entryways, along with landscaping and new public spaces. Plans also call for demolishing a small portion of existing retail to open up the project and potentially add a new office building. The EDC is considering purchasing a pad site for a future office development for $3.4 million.\nTo unlock the public dollars,\nTrademark\nmust maintain at least 325 jobs at the property and secure 70,000 square feet of new leases. The developer is also required to invest at least $500,000 in community or project amenities. If the project outperforms Trademark\u2019s projected internal rate of return upon a sale, the city and EDC would receive 15 percent of the excess returns \u2014 a rare clawback-style upside provision in suburban retail deals, according to the outlet.\nThe agreement now heads to the Arlington City Council, which is expected to vote Feb. 24.\nTrademark has pitched Anthem as a \u201cmodern gateway\u201d to North Arlington, near the city\u2019s entertainment district. The City Council approved zoning in March 2024 allowing for higher density, and early plans included a 200-room hotel, 355 apartments and 125,000 square feet of office and coworking space.\nThose ambitions have since been scaled back. Amid softer apartment rents and difficulty landing a luxury flag, Trademark dropped the hotel and multifamily components.\nCEO Terry Montesi\nsaid during a zoning hearing last fall that the project would still represent a significant upgrade.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "One of Brownstone Brooklyn\u2019s most active townhouse developers is trying to make it in Manhattan.\nEckstrom, the\neight-year-old development firm\nrun by husband and wife duo Carlos Saavedra and Nicole Eckstrom, is expanding into the city with two West Village properties. The firm\u2019s jump across the river is in partnership with Compass agent Carl Gambino on a portfolio of five properties that will launch in the next two years.\nFor Eckstrom, the expansion comes after an ascendant two years developing homes in Brooklyn\u2019s toniest neighborhoods. The company, which began by doing condo conversions in more affordable parts of Brooklyn, found a niche turning multifamily properties in Brooklyn Heights and Cobble Hill into high-end townhomes.\nThe developer has notched a spate of pricey sales, including a conversion at\n170 Clinton Street\nthat closed for $14 million this month, on the back of a\nhot luxury townhouse market\n.\nA different ballgame\nEckstrom is betting it can ride the\nwave of wealthy buyers\nto pricier submarkets.\nIn the last three months, the firm has picked up properties at 59 Morton Street, a landmarked residence in Greenwich Village, and 248 West 12th Street, a two-family home in the West Village. In December, Eckstrom closed on the Morton Street property for roughly $12 million.\nThe closing price is around three times what Eckstrom has paid for most of its Brooklyn properties. But Saavedra says the higher price points in neighborhoods like the West Village will allow him to absorb rising building costs while maintaining the quality he says has defined the Eckstrom brand thus far.\nNavigating the Manhattan market is also where Gambino comes in. The pair met because they were neighbors in Brooklyn Heights and, through their skateboard-loving sons, struck up a friendship of their own that eventually turned to business.\nThe Compass agent, who grew up in the West Village, is licensed in Los Angeles and New York and known for\nbrokering deals with celebrity and wealthy clientele\n.\n\u201cWhat I felt like our team could do specifically is expose Carlos to all the other markets we work in,\u201d said Gambino. \u201cTheir company should be known as the go-to for people looking for townhomes in the West Village and prime areas of Brooklyn.\u201d\nSaavedra has at least three more developments planned in Brooklyn Heights, including a home at 487 Henry Street slated to launch this spring. Eckstrom bought the property for $4.65 million in 2024, according to public records.\nOne of Eckstrom\u2019s development quirks has been marketing its homes well before they\u2019re done in the hopes of finding a buyer who will come in and collaborate on the finishes. So far, the strategy has appeared to work. In addition to its sale at 170 Clinton Street, Eckstrom has a signed contract for a home at 307 Hicks Street asking $15.5 million, and closed an $11.5 million sale at 51 Tompkins Place last year.\nSaavedra said the marketing for the rest of the homes will vary depending on factors like timing and the project\u2019s complexity. The Morton Street home is already structured as a single-family home, which Saavedra says makes it more palatable for early marketing. The other Manhattan project also requires less structural work compared to some of the multifamily conversions Eckstrom has done in the past.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done so many things in Brooklyn that are so ambitious, and we\u2019ve done well, that I feel like now we deserve a little respite in keeping things a little more simple,\u201d said Saavedra.\nSaavedra also has his eyes on other markets, like the Hamptons, although the plans are a little less fleshed out there. Saavedra closed on a property in Sag Harbor for $4.4 million for himself, with plans to renovate the home in a test of the market.\n",

Irvine leaders approved the demolition of the asphalt plant in April 2023 after\npurchasing the site\nin April 2023 for over $285 million.\nThe housing location near the Bowerman Landfill might prove to be an issue due to the scents coming from the\ntrash\nsite. Since Jan. 1, the South Coast Air Quality Management District has registered more than 130 public complaints describing \u201crotten, sour, garbage-type odors\u201d in the area, officials said, according to Voice of OC. Bowerman has received three notices of violation this year associated with odor emissions and five since 2020 related to excess nitrous oxide.\nIrvine Mayor Larry Agran shot down hopes of shutting down the Bowerman Landfill, though he noted that the city was working with the county to determine ways to lower impacts on residents like building a new freeway off-ramp into the dump for trash trucks.\n\u201cThe odor problem, which is an intermittent occasional problem, has to be managed and dealt with and it will be,\u201d Agran told Voice of OC. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with it all the time, working with the county on this and working on longer range\nlandfill\nplans and so forth.\u201d Agran\u2019s ideas for long-term alternatives to the Bowerman Landfill include a trash train throughout Southern California to transport waste to a new, larger landfill farther away from populated areas.\n\u201cIn the immediate future, we want to be making sure that landfill practices are absolutely the best, the most protective of residents and others,\u201d Agran said. The city has already forced people moving into the area to deal with the smell; in 2024, city leaders began requiring future residents of\nBrookfield\n\u2019s planned\nGateway Village\nto waive their right to sue the landfill over nuisances, unless it is found to violate the law.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Really?\nThat\u2019s what some in Los Angeles real estate are asking as proponents look to put a proposed\nbillionaire tax\nonto the November ballot.\n\u201cThis will be the icing on the cake and the most detrimental thing to happen to California, putting this billionaire tax proposal on the ballot and passing it,\u201d The Agency Principal Santiago Arana said. \u201cIt will be very difficult to get back from that point.\u201d\nBranden Williams, co-founder and president of the Beverly Hills Estates, likened increasing costs in the state to a second-rate storyline.\n\u201cThis is a bad comic book out of Batman and Gotham City and pretty soon the state\u2019s going to lose everybody,\u201d Williams said.\nEven the whiff of the tax proposal has been enough to send some of the\nstate\u2019s wealthiest packing\n, kicking a real estate market that\u2019s already been facing a confluence of challenges in recent years, including the city of Los Angeles\u2019s two-tier\nMeasure United to House L.A.\n, insurance headwinds in the wake of the Palisades and Eaton wildfires, concerns over crime and homelessness, not to mention a shrinking customer base in the traditional pillar of the local entertainment industry.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why but, for some reason, California has just consistently made it more and more difficult for the wealthy to live here, which are the people who also contribute and stimulate the economy and pay higher taxes as it is,\u201d said Carl Gambino, who helms the Gambino Group at Compass.\nWhile not on the ballot, the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act is in the signature-gathering phase.\nWhat\u2019s on the table is a one-time, 5 percent tax on the assets of anyone living in the state as of Jan. 1, 2026 with a net worth in excess of $1 billion. The state\u2019s Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office estimated the impact to be on a \u201cfew hundred\u201d individuals.\nCalifornia would begin collecting in 2027, but payers would have the option of spreading that out over a five-year period. An individual who meets the minimum threshold of $1 billion would, for example, face a payment of $50 million regardless of whether the assets in question are liquid, such as cash, or illiquid, such as property.\nA chief supporter of the bid for tax is the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West (SEIU-UHW), with health care services billed as being in line for the largest\u00a0 share of revenue generated from the tax. Smaller streams would go to education and food assistance.\nThe Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office has projected the possibility of the state getting a short-term boost in revenue from the tax, with an exodus of ultra-wealthy residents causing an eventual decline over the long haul.\nFlorida brokers who spoke to\nThe Real Deal\nlast month said they\u2019ve already begun to benefit from some billionaires\u2019 fears over the tax who are now headed to the state for their residential buys. That includes Google co-founder\nSergey Brin\n. Meta founder and CEO\nMark Zuckerberg\n, along with his wife Priscilla Chan, have reportedly been eyeing an Indian Creek Island spec mansion, also\u00a0 in Florida.\nU.S. Senator\nBernie Sanders\nfrom Vermont waived off any fears of an exodus as unproven.\nThe independent, who spoke at a rally Wednesday evening at The Wiltern to kick off a campaign in support of the tax, argued employers and the wealthy often use threats of fleeing to other states to stop policies or other actions from moving forward. He said companies do that to workers looking to unionize and some in New York City threatened the same when now-Mayor Zohran Mamdani was running for office.\n\u201c[New Yorkers[ didn\u2019t [leave] and I doubt that they will flee the great state of California,\u201d Sanders said during his speech.\nLeaky market\nIf anyone knows the wealthy\u2019s pattern of movement well, it would be Gambino, whose team is spread out across California, Florida and New York. The group recently expanded into Bucks County, Penn. \u2014 a wealthy \u201ccollar county\u201d in the Philadelphia metropolitan area \u2014 as it looks to keep up with clients.\n\u201cMoney is very movable, especially at that level,\u201d Gambino said. \u201cThese people have homes all over the place as it is. They\u2019re just not tied to California like they used to be.\u201d\nClients have expressed concern about the tax, with Gambino saying he\u2019s already seen several, particularly tech entrepreneurs, make the move to Florida. The exodus ramped late last year in the high-end as some sought to beat the Jan. 1 retroactive deadline should the tax end up on the ballot and pass.\nThe Gambino Group\u2019s business in New York City is robust, despite any negative news around Mamdani, Gambino said. The same goes for the North Fork of Long Island and in Bucks County, there\u2019s been an influx of entertainment industry professionals flocking to that submarket\u2019s idyllic, farmhouse lifestyle.\nFor Williams, he\u2019s referred business out of L.A. to places such as Nashville, Texas, Montana, Nevada and Arizona. Though he chalks up the departures to a bigger problem: \u201cThis isn\u2019t the taxes; this is the corruption.\u201d\n\u201cThese people aren\u2019t coming back,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll come and visit California, but they\u2019re not going to come back and claim residency.\u201d\nOther points of consideration\nThe rollout of\nMeasure ULA\nmight offer a good blueprint for cause and effect should a billionaire tax pass, some say.\nThe so-called mansion tax in the city of Los Angeles \u2014 4 percent for all deals starting at $5.3 million and 5.5 percent for those $10.6 million or more \u2014 has impacted deal flow and construction financing across residential and commercial.\n\u201cThey\u2019re taxing the rich to give to the poor, which is a really great idea when it works, not when there is corruption,\u201d Arana said of\nULA\u2019s impact\n. \u201cThey haven\u2019t done anything for the homeless. It didn\u2019t work.\u201d\nProponents of ULA point out the tax has raised over $1 billion in revenue since its 2023 implementation. The measure originally estimated $600 million to $1.1 billion per year in revenue generated from the tax.\nThus, Arana\u2019s skeptical of the efficacy a billionaire tax would have to fund health care services.\nEven with the concerns, there\u2019s always a flip side. Billionaires are not extinct in the market, he said. He\u2019s now shown\nBen Affleck and J.Lo\n\u2019s former home at 2571 Wallingford Drive in Beverly Hills to 24 buyers. Eighteen of those were billionaires. The property was last listed for $52 million. He\u2019s shown his $65 million listing at\n401 North Tigertail Road\nin Brentwood eight times since putting it on the market late last month.\nArana\u2019s colleague at The Agency, Paul Lester, offered another view. Lester said he tapped two of his billionaire clients for their thoughts on the tax.\n\u201cThey feel the time has not come for this and it will not get done this round and this is more political signaling than a real solution,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth felt there are ways to ratchet up taxation incrementally above certain thresholds to deal with deficits over time, but not this blanket proposal.\u201d\nBilly Rose, a founder and vice chair at The Agency, pointed out the state doesn\u2019t have to look any farther than its own backyard and\nHollywood\u2019s troubles\nas an analogy for what the billionaire tax could bring.\n\u201cIf our top end activity slows materially, the downstream impact is real,\u201d said Rose, who was previously an entertainment lawyer and talent agent. \u201cHollywood is getting decimated. The top end is still doing well, but the middle is disappearing in terms of those in the entertainment industry who are working. People don\u2019t have the disposable income and in Los Angeles, capital isn\u2019t an abstract. It builds homes. It funds trades. It supports municipal budgets. We need to really evaluate any policy not just on a moral basis, but an economical one.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The Olayan Group locked in an $800 million loan for its revamped Midtown office building, better known as the Sony building.\nING Capital added $230 million of new debt to the existing $570 million loan balance on 550 Madison Avenue, according to property records. ING issued the original loan in 2016, when Olayan purchased the 41-story, 800,000-square-foot Midtown building between East 55th and East 56th streets for $1.4 billion.\nThe refinance comes nine months after Global financial services firm Aquarian Holdings signed a lease for 75,000 square feet, boosting occupancy to about 96 percent. Olayan recently renovated the building, hiring Scott Rechler\u2019s RXR as a development advisor and spending $300 million to redesign the lower floors and the lobby and to add retail windows to the pink facade. The project was complicated by a\ncontentious landmarking process\n.\nOlayan\nbought\nthe building, designed by renowned architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee, from Chetrit Group and David Bistricer\u2019s Clipper Equity. At the time, the former headquarters for AT&amp;T, and later Sony Corporation of America, had been vacated to make way for a condo conversion.\nOther tenants at the building include global insurance giant Chubb Limited, which has a 10-floor,\n240,000-square-foot lease\n; luxury brand Herm\u00e8s, which has a 72,000-square-foot headquarters lease; advisory firm Junto Capital, which occupies 25,000 square feet; and Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice, a private investment advisory firm that agreed to\ntake 144,000 square feet\nin 2023.\nOlayan Group, an often-secretive Saudi-based firm headed by sisters Lubna and Huthan Olayan, has been increasingly helping\nbridge ties\nwith Wall Street players and Saudi Arabia. The Olayan family has become one of the world\u2019s richest, with a value exceeding $50 billion, per Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaire Index.\nOlayan and ING Capital did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Just when it appeared Pakistan was\nback at square one\nin figuring out the future of the Roosevelt Hotel, an unexpected partner came along: the White House.\nThe federal government signed a pact with the Pakistani government, which owns the site at 45 East 45th Street, to jointly redevelop the famed hotel, Reuters\nreported\n. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed in the memorandum.\nNotably, the agreement was negotiated by real estate developer and U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, whose presence has been felt in international diplomacy throughout the past year.\nThe agreement pertains to the cooperation between the parties on the redevelopment, renovation, operation and maintenance of the property. It says the project will be \u201cfacilitated by the United States General Services Administration and by the Pakistan Ministry of Defence,\u201d putting the GSA in an unusual position compared to its typical federal property management duties.\nThe introduction of the federal government is an added complexity to an already winding process.\nEarlier this week, Pakistan\u2019s privatization commission was reportedly looking for a broker to help monetize the site, which has the potential to be redeveloped into a 1.8-million-square-foot office building.\nThe Pakistani government in 2024 hired JLL to market the property either for an outright sale or a joint venture development partnership, but after JPMorgan kicked the tires on it, JLL resigned in July, citing a conflict of interest from clients who were interested in bidding on the site.\nIn late November, it was reported that a team of CBRE and Morgan Stanley was the frontrunner to win the marketing assignment. The Pakistani government said there was increased interest in the site after New York City terminated its contract to use the hotel as a migrant shelter.\nBut last month, the privatization commission announced it had hit reset on the hiring process after five of the seven proposals under consideration were rejected for non-compliance. Around the same time, the Pakistani government ruled out a sale of the property.\nUnder Pakistan\u2019s plan, the government would contribute the land into the venture while a development partner would put up about $1 billion in equity; the JV would take on another $2 billion to $3 billion in debt. The Pakistani government aims to have an ownership stake of around 40 to 50 percent.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

In St. Helena, Gallo is cutting its staff at the Ranch Winery, Louis M. Martini\nWinery\nand the Orin Swift Tasting Room; the company is also lowering its headcount in Healdsburg at its J Vineyards &amp; Winery and Frei Ranch facilities.\nGallo is continuing to slim down its portfolio with the latest Napa Valley closures. In 2024, the company sold two winemaking facilities. Last July, it announced the closure of another in San Miguel.\nIt isn\u2019t the only wine maker trimming its real estate holdings on the West Coast. Earlier this month, Foley Family Wines &amp; Spirits sold its production facility on the Central Coast. Trinchero Family Wine &amp; Spirits, the country\u2019s third-largest wine company, has listed two of its vineyards for sale.\nMeanwhile, in San Francisco, local spirits producer Hotaling &amp; Company announced the closure of its Pier 50 distillery, Robb Report\nreported\n. Hotaling was originally founded in 1993 as Anchor Distilling Company, an offshoot of the popular brewery purchased by magnate Fritz Maytag in the 1960s that made Anchor Steam, among other beers.\nSapporo\nacquired the company in 2017 and split the distillery and brewery operations, but the brewery ultimately closed in 2023. Chobani CEO Hamdi Ulukaya announced his intention to\npurchase Anchor\nin 2024, though no deal actually happened, according to Robb Report.\nThe decision to close the Pier 50\ndistillery\ncame after \u201ca comprehensive review of [Hotaling\u2019s] long-term growth priorities and capital allocation,\u201d Hotaling told Robb Report.

Shomof\npaid $58.5 million\nfor the more than 400,000-square-foot building last year.\nIn order to become a reality, the project will need certain allowances from city management including an exception from parking regulations, per Urbanize. Adaptive reuse efforts in Glendale are less common than in areas like downtown L.A., though some projects have risen in recent years, such as the conversion of 520 North Central Avenue and the Harrower Village property on Broadway into housing. The forthcoming office-to-residential conversion is across the street from Rick Caruso\u2019s Americana at Brand shopping mall.\nShomof\u2019s adaptive reuse endeavors span Los Angeles County.\nIn October, Shomof purchased a 24-story, 460,000-square-foot property at 111 West Ocean Boulevard in Long Beach,\nThe Real Deal previously reported\n. Earlier this month, Shomof filed an application with the Long Beach Planning Bureau to\nconvert the building into housing\n. The existing structure, which spans more than 480,000 square feet, would be turned into 391 residential units if approved.\nIn 2023, Shomof revealed plans to\nbuild 200 homes next to the Panorama Tower\nin the San Fernando Valley. The units are slated to complement the 14-story, 194-unit Panorama Tower that Shomof previously converted from offices to apartments.\nResidential adaptive reuse projects from other developers, most notably\nJamison Properties\n, are sprouting across L.A. County. Near 111 West Ocean Boulevard at 200 West Ocean Boulevard in Long Beach, a high-rise built in the 1960s reopened as housing in 2023, per Urbanize. The Breakers Building at 210 East Ocean Boulevard made its debut as the\nFremont Breakers Long Beach hotel\nin 2024. The Ocean Center Building at 110 West Ocean Boulevard, across the street from Shomof\u2019s 111 West Ocean Boulevard project, completed its transition to housing and opened to tenants in 2023.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "CLK Properties lined up permanent financing on one of Chicagoland\u2019s largest condo deconversions.\nThe Long Island-based investor secured $115 million in Freddie Mac-backed debt to refinance its 918-unit Courtlands on the Park complex in Des Plaines, Commercial Observer first\nreported\n. Greystone originated the nonrecourse, fixed-rate loan, which carries a five-year term, 30-year amortization and three years of interest-only payments.\nThe fresh debt retires the bridge financing CLK used to acquire the sprawling garden-style property at 10020 Holly Lane, roughly\n19 miles northwest of downtown Chicago\n. Senior Managing Director Eric Rosenstock said in a statement that the loan provides a \u201cpermanent solution\u201d as CLK continues executing its business plan.\nIn early 2020, CLK\nbought the complex\nthat was built in 1973 for $94 million, or about $102,000 per unit, as part of what was then the largest condo deconversion by unit count in the Chicago area,\nThe Real Deal\nreported at the time. The property, formerly known as Heritage Village, spans 153 low-rise buildings filled with one- and two-bedroom units.\nCLK has since poured nearly $37 million into renovations, repositioning the former for-sale units into market-rate rentals \u2014 wagering that suburban multifamily demand would outpace the economics of fractured condo ownership.\nThe refinancing suggests lenders are still willing to back stabilized suburban rentals, particularly those with agency support, according to the publication. Freddie Mac executions remain a critical source of liquidity for large workforce-style communities in and around\nChicago\n, where rent growth has moderated but occupancy remains relatively steady by national standards.\nCLK has also been active outside Illinois. In 2022, Greystone provided a $33.7 million Fannie Mae-backed loan for the firm\u2019s acquisition of Willow Creek Apartments in Jonesboro, Arkansas, according to the publication.\nIn 2024, CLK\nhired brokers\nat CBRE to market Courtlands on the Park for sale, preparing a potential exit after completing its value-add program, though it\u2019s unclear whether CLK is still actively looking to off-load the property.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Bachman Realty closed $245 million in sales volume last year with 650 transactions, and it boasts a four-year streak as Fathom\u2019s top national team, the release states.\nAt the northern side of the Metroplex, Denton and the surrounding area have grown rapidly in recent years and continue to attract new development. Houston-based Johnson Development is working with landowners on a 3,100-acre project named\nCole Ranch\n, set to include 4,365 single-family homes just south of the Denton Enterprise Airport. The\nAlpha Ranch\n, a Centurion American development, will add another 4,000 homes to the area along Highway 114. Hillwood is planning a $10 billion development named\nLandmark\nin Denton that Hillwood Chairman Ross Perot Jr. says will include 6,000 single-family homes and 3,000 apartments.\nA flood of new housing supply contributed to a 4.3 decline in home sale prices last year in Denton County, which simultaneously saw a 2.2 percent increase in closings.\nAlong with Denton County, Bachman Realty Group covers other markets around the Metroplex, including Collin County,\nhome to Princeton, the fastest-growing city in the country\n, and Cooke County on the\nOklahoma border\n.\nMiami-based Real Brokerage describes itself as a tech-first firm, touting a proprietary software named reZEN intended to help agents with marketing and back-office work. Bachman co-founder Tiffany Bachman stated in the release that tech was Real Brokerage\u2019s primary draw.\nThe company is on a swift recruiting streak,\nhaving added 20,000 agents since 2023\n.\nBachman claimed on\nInstagram\nin 2025 that Cary, North Carolina-based Fathom Realty recognized it as the top team in the nation, and that it was recognized as the number one team for volume in 2022. Co-founder Greg Bachman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTwo of the three teams that have joined Real Brokerage this year are from Texas. Bachman Realty Group followed\nHouston Properties Team\n, a highly ranked group of 17 agents in Houston that joined Real from Keller Williams.\n",

        "content": "A housing project in the Bronx will go through a speedier land use review process, the first to test out one of three housing-related ballot measures approved by voters in November.\nThe Powerhouse Apartments project will go through the Expedited Land Use Review Procedure, or Elurp, which will last 90 days instead of the usual 200-plus days required under the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure.\nDevelopers Lemle &amp; Wolff Companies, HELPDevCo and True Development New York plan to add 84 affordable housing units to the site at 351 Powers Avenue, which is currently being used as a parking lot for the city\u2019s Department of Education.\nVoters approved Elurp in November, as part of a package of ballot measures aimed at speeding up housing approvals. The other\nchanges\nincluded the creation of an appeals board that can reverse City Council rejections of projects that add affordable housing in one borough and a \u201cfast track\u201d approval process for projects proposed in 12 community districts that have added the least amount of affordable housing. The administration recently\nproposed rules\nfor identifying those districts. The fast track is expected to become available in January.\nAnother \u201cfast track\u201d path allows the Board of Standards and Appeals to instead sign off on certain publicly-financed housing projects.\nThe Bronx project, planned in a medium-density residential district, doesn\u2019t require a zoning change but would have needed to go through the full Ulurp process under previous rules as a disposition of city-owned land.\nUnder Elurp, the local community board and Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson will have 60 days to review the application, which will run concurrently.\nBecause the project is seeking an Article XI tax exemption, review will end with the City Council, which has 30 days to consider the proposal. Other Elurp applications that aren\u2019t seeking that kind of tax exemption can instead receive final approval from the City Planning Commission.\nProjects seeking zoning changes can also qualify for Elurp, so long as they increase residential capacity by no more than 30 percent (if located in a medium- or high-density district) or, if in a low-density district, are no taller than 45 feet and have a maximum floor area ratio of two.\nThe Powers Avenue project underscores the hoops that even a small, 100 percent affordable housing project on city-owned land must go through, even without zoning changes, absent the ballot measures and other recent changes. For instance, the project is able to bypass environmental review through the city\u2019s \u201c\ngreen fast track\n,\u201d because it has fewer than 250 units and will be all electric.\nEnvironmental review can sometimes add years to a project\u2019s timeline, on top of the seven-month Ulurp process. As part of her executive budget, Gov. Kathy Hochul has proposed exempting more projects from environmental review.\nThe project has already been a few years in the making. The Adams administration selected the development team in 2024 after releasing a request for proposals in 2022.\nThe project will also include 30,000 square feet of community facility space, P.S. 65 Mother Hale Academy public school, nearly 4,000 square feet of community theater space and 30 parking spots to replace the existing staff parking.\n",

Continua, the U.S. arm of Colombia-based Constructora Capital, and SP demolished a school and a church on the site to make way for Urbania NoMi 6ave, designed by Denver-based G3 Architecture.

That represents a 97 percent increase compared to affordable apartment deliveries between 2015 to 2019.\nWhen\nNorth Miami\ncity officials approved Urbania NoMi 6ave in 2024, representatives for the developers said they would consider using tax benefits afforded by Florida\u2019s Live Local Act by setting aside at least 70 of a project\u2019s apartments for households earning between 80 percent and 120 percent of the area median income.

        "content": "A fully entitled high-rise site close to Austin FC\u2019s home pitch is up for grabs.\nAustin-based Wilson Capital is marketing its development site, planned for a 28-story apartment tower at 2500 Braker Lane, just across from the Aguilar Street entrance to Q2 Stadium in North Austin. The offering includes three contiguous lots totaling roughly 1.3 acres, with approvals in place for a 307-unit multifamily project, according to marketing materials first\nreported\nby the Austin Business Journal.\nJLL\u2019s Graham Schmergel and Reid Gilbreath are handling the listing. The brokers declined to comment.\nThe approved site plan calls for a 289,393-square-foot tower with a mix of studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom units averaging 943 square feet. More than 300 parking spaces would be wrapped into floors one through six. One parcel is vacant; the other two contain small commercial buildings that appear to be empty, according to the outlet.\nIn a statement, Wilson Capital President\nTaylor Wilson\nsaid the sale is part of an \u201congoing review\u201d of the firm\u2019s portfolio. He declined further comment.\nThe move marks a shift from earlier signals. In March 2025, while addressing delays at the firm\u2019s downtown\nWilson Tower project\n, Wilson said the company still intended to move forward on its project at 2500 Braker. Since then, plans appear to have changed.\nWilson Tower, once expected to break ground in 2023 at the northeast corner of\nFifth and Trinity\nstreets in Austin, remains stalled. The site plan for that project \u2014 on the former Avenue Lofts site \u2014 is set to expire July 10.\nThe Braker Lane listing offers a rare, fully entitled high-rise opportunity in North Austin\u2019s stadium district \u2014 without the entitlement risk that has bogged down many urban towers, according to the publication.\nInstead, Wilson Capital has been focusing on suburban multifamily development in Pflugerville, Round Rock, Lakeway and Dripping Springs.\nWilson is also pursuing large-scale land acquisitions, including the $2.15 billion, 932-acre Blue Sky master-planned community in\nLockhart\n.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "NBA Hall of Famer\nAlonzo Mourning\nand Housing Trust Group landed a $47 million financing package for a seniors-only affordable apartment project in Hollywood.\nMourning\u2019s AM Affordable Housing and Coconut Grove-based Housing Trust Group started construction of the 96-unit Villa Jordana at 826 South Dixie Highway, according to the developers\u2019 news release. Completion is expected next year.\nThe financing includes $33.8 million in low-income housing tax credit equity syndicated by Raymond James, and a $32 million construction loan and a $10.2 million permanent loan, both from Capital One through Freddie Mac, according to the release. The city of Hollywood also provided a $640,000 loan.\nVilla Jordana will be restricted to renters who are 62 and older, earning between 33 percent and 60 percent of the area median income, the release says.\nMonthly rents will range from $713 to $1,555. That\u2019s a break from Hollywood\u2019s average rent this month of $2,179, according to RentCafe.\nLed by Matthew A. Rieger, Housing Trust Group develops multifamily for a mix of incomes, with more than $4 billion on commercial, residential and land developments in Florida, as well as Arizona, Illinois and Texas, the release says. It has nearly 2,700 units in South Florida.\nHousing Trust Group and AM Affordable Housing, a nonprofit launched by Mourning, who retired from the Miami Heat in 2009, have partnered on affordable housing projects across Florida.\nThis includes the two-phase Courtside apartment project in Miami\u2019s Overtown, consisting of a six-story,\n94-unit building\nat 1699 Northwest Fourth Avenue completed in 2016, and a pair of seven-story buildings with\n120 units\n, combined, at 1698 Northwest Third Avenue and 1501 Northwest Fourth Avenue.\nLast year, the partners completed the five-story, 120-unit Astoria on 9th affordable senior housing project in Bradenton, on Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast, according to Housing Trust Group\u2019s website. Also last year, Housing Trust Group and AM Affordable Housing finished the eight-story, 96-unit Oasis at Aventura affordable senior building at 18700 Northeast 25th Avenue in the Ojus neighborhood.\nOn its own, Housing Trust Group has seized on Hollywood. In October, it scored approval for the 110-unit\nHillcrest Village\non Pembroke Road, west of I-95. The firm completed the 96-unit Hudson Village in 2022 and the 216-unit\nUniversity Station\nlast year, both in Hollywood.\nAffordable housing development is an attractive niche in South Florida\u2019s real estate market. The region is still feeling the crush from a supply overhang of luxury and market-rate rentals, defined by slower lease-ups and a drop in rents, following years of hefty completions.\nDevelopers who can master the complexities of securing low-income housing tax credits and other state and local government financing mechanisms and subsidies have a near ensured demand for their affordable buildings.\nThe average asking home price in South Florida was $500,000 last month, according to Realtor.com. Yet, the median income in Miami-Dade County is $87,200, while it\u2019s $96,200 in Broward County and $111,800 in Palm Beach County, according to the Florida Housing Finance Corporation.\n",

        "content": "Los Angeles County has a long way to go before fixing its\nhousing shortage\nafter decades of building too little housing to meet growing demand.\nOver a 40-year period since the 1970s, California built 325 new housing units for every 1,000 new people added to the state population, LAist\nreported\n.\nIn order to meet the crisis, the state would have to plan to build 2.5 million new homes between 2021 and 2029, more than double its target for the previous eight-year housing production cycle. With three years to go, Southern California still needs to plan for 1.3 million new homes to meet state goals. All of the cities in Los Angeles County are responsible for a combined total of 812,000 units; of those, 450,000 would come from the City of Los Angeles.\nIn order to meet the lofty housing creation goals, the 88 cities in Los Angeles County would have to add roughly 101,500 units per year to stay on track. In 2024, the municipalities together built 28,453, LAist reported, citing\ndata\nfrom the California Department of Housing and Community Development.\nZoning\nrules have been a major hurdle as cities across Los Angeles County lag in creating housing density. When Los Angeles received its mission to build 450,000 new homes, the city\u2019s regulations only allowed for about half of those units to be built. As a result, the city had to update its laws about what kinds of housing can be built and where.\nRed tape and slow bureaucratic processes have bogged down the approval process as various departments review plans and some projects face public hearings, lawsuits, City Council discussions and other obstacles.\nConstruction costs also have made\ndevelopers\nwary of taking on new projects. Supply chain disruptions, scarce materials, labor shortages, inflation and other factors have thrown wrenches into development plans. Relief with regard to imported materials likely won\u2019t come soon, given President Donald Trump\u2019s commitment to a new 10 percent global tariff despite the Supreme Court striking down his\nsweeping tariffs\nfrom last year.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Veteran Chicago developer Mike Reschke and investor\nTheodore Koenig\nare taking their former partner to court, accusing David Trandel of defrauding them in a residential investment gone wrong.\nIn a complaint filed in Cook County Circuit Court on Feb. 13, Reschke,\nCEO of Prime Group\n, and Koenig, CEO of Monroe Capital, accuse Trandel of effectively stealing a Wisconsin residential development site after Reschke and Koenig invested in its purchase. The complaint also accuses Trandel of misappropriating up to $2 million in funds and misleading investors about where the money was going.\nReschke, Koenig and\nTrandel\nfounded Primestone Residential in 2022 to identify and purchase vacant land, rezone it for residential use and sell it to homebuilders, according to the lawsuit. Trandel was the day-to-day manager of Primestone, while Reschke and Koenig provided capital, the lawsuit says.\nTrandel is a longtime associate of Reschke, having served as COO of Reschke\u2019s\nPrime Group\nfrom 2003 to 2011.\nReschke told\nThe Real Deal\nthat he\u2019s hoping for a quick settlement of the dispute.\n\u201cHow it ended up is disheartening, based on our very long relationship that we had together,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just sort of shocked at what happened here, and dismayed.\u201d\nTrandel did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe investors are asking a court to force Trandel to hand the disputed property back to the company. They\u2019re also demanding he return their $2 million investment, pay back the management fees he collected and provide a full record of the company\u2019s accounting.\nThe fallout centers on the plan to purchase a 34-acre property in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin. The lot, which Trandel contracted to purchase in 2022, was the first successful purchase after Trandel unsuccessfully tried to buy other parcels, the lawsuit says.\nThe funding\nDuring the three years after the site went under contract in 2022, Reshke and Koenig provided hundreds of thousands of dollars to fund Primestone\u2019s development costs for the parcel, according to the lawsuit. In January 2025, Trandel requested an additional $75,000 to continue working on the deal.\nIn May, Trandel said he had secured a deal to sell the site to Lennar Corporation for $3.2 million, calling it \u201can important first [win] for Primestone Residential.\u201d He requested additional funding, which included a $25,000 fee to himself. Later in May, Trandel requested another $25,000 from Koenig, which he said was \u201cneeded today to facilitate the Mount Pleasant land sale to Lennar,\u201d according to the suit.\nAfter Trandel made an additional $68,000 request in July, Koenig replied asking about the purpose of the $25,000 payment and questioned where the funds were going, the suit says.\n\u201cI know you are stretched for money these days, and I am sympathetic to that, but we have paid over $1.2mm already in direct payments to you,\u201d Koenig said in an email included in court documents. \u201cThat was not what we all signed up for, our last discussion was that this was supposed to stop.\u201d\nIn a reply included in court documents, Trandel said the fee \u201cis for me personally \u2026 to live \u2026 it is my means.\u201d\nAfter the dispute, Reschke and Koenig agreed to lower Trandel\u2019s monthly fee to $12,500, according to the complaint.\nThe purchase\nIn September, Trandel emailed Reschke and Koenig that he had formed a new LLC, SST Old Green Bay Road, to handle the purchase of the Mount Pleasant site. When Reschke questioned why Trandel was the sole member of that LLC, Trandel asked Primestone\u2019s attorney, Ed Gausselin, to change the member to Primestone, according to communications attached to the lawsuit.\nAfter Koenig and Reschke approved more funding, they allege Trandel stopped communicating with them altogether last fall. In December, the suit says, Trandel closed on the deal with the LLC that was still solely in his name, despite his earlier agreement to put the LLC under the Primestone company\u2019s name.\nThe purchase, according to the lawsuit, was a \u201cgross usurpation of a company opportunity\u201d and \u201ctantamount to theft.\u201d\nThe mortgage\nThe lawsuit also alleges that Trandel took out a $1.5 million mortgage on the property, without Koenig and Reschke\u2019s knowledge, from an entity managed by Lowell Kraff, a Miami-based investor described as Trandel\u2019s friend.\nThe loan amount was \u201ccommercially unreasonable\u201d because it was far higher than the $925,000 purchase price of the parcel, the lawsuit claims. The lawsuit also argues Kraff knew Trandel was working with Reschke and Koenig and should have inquired about the source of his funds, including the earnest money deposits that were made by Primestone.\nKraff and his entity are named as respondents in discovery in the lawsuit. Kraff did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe site is still under contract to sell to Lennar, and the lawsuit says the plaintiffs believe its sale \u201cmay be imminent, which would cause plaintiffs irreparable harm.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A proposed apartment tower that could reset the height and density ceiling in Fulton Market is headed to the City Council \u2014 after surviving an unusual rebuke from the city\u2019s own zoning gatekeepers.\nThe Chicago Plan Commission voted 11-2 to approve a 29-story, 347-unit residential project at 215 North Racine Avenue, despite a recommendation from Chicago\u2019s zoning administrator to reject it, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The $160 million development from Chicago-based Domus Real Estate Group now advances to the City Council\u2019s Zoning Committee.\nAt issue is Domus\u2019 request for\nDX-16 zoning\n, the city\u2019s most dense base designation \u2014 typically reserved for downtown skyscrapers. The classification allows developers to multiply a site\u2019s square footage by 16 to determine maximum buildable area, and crucially, imposes no cap on bonus density purchases through Chicago\u2019s Neighborhood Opportunity Bonus program.\nFulton Market projects to date have topped out at\nDX-7 base zoning\n, with limits on how much additional density could be bought.\nDomus\u2019 13,251-square-foot mid-block site\nwould include a bonus payment, pushing its effective multiplier to 24.7, according to its application.\nChicago Zoning Administrator Patrick Murphey urged commissioners to reject the plan, arguing it breaks from years of planning guidelines crafted to manage growth, infrastructure strain and historic preservation in the former meatpacking district. He warned it could spur other developers to chase similar upzoning, potentially eroding the framework that has governed one of the country\u2019s hottest commercial corridors.\nStill, Department of Planning &amp; Development commissioner\nCiere Boatright\nacknowledged the \u201cslippery slope,\u201d but backed the project, citing the citywide need for housing. The commission\u2019s approval came with a twist: Domus must attach a so-called no-flip clause to its planned development, tying the DX-16 zoning exclusively to the current ownership entity. Any change to the project\u2019s economic disclosure form could revert the site to its existing zoning, according to the clause.\nThe political calculus may matter more than the planning debate, as under Chicago\u2019s long-standing aldermanic prerogative tradition, local support often dictates outcomes. Alderman Walter \u201cRed\u201d Burnett, who took over the 27th Ward seat from his father in September, endorsed the project, highlighting a planned small public park and a heavy mix of two-bedroom units.\nMoments after the vote, commissioners quickly approved another Fulton Market apartment high-rise at 1338 West Lake Street, a 33-story proposal from Cedar Street seeking the district\u2019s first DX-10 zoning.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Mayor Zohran Mamdani said his property tax reform plan is imminent. New Yorkers have heard that before.\nEarlier this week, the administration released its preliminary budget, which included\nraising property taxes\nin the city by 9.5 percent in order to cover a $5 billion shortfall \u2014 a move Mamdani said he\u2019d only tap as a \u201ctool of very last resort\u201d and one Gov. Kathy Hochul doesn\u2019t seem inclined to support.\nAlongside the budget, Mamdani also indicated he planned to float a proposal to reform the city\u2019s property tax system to New York State legislators in the next few weeks, echoing a promise former Mayor Eric Adams made almost exactly a year ago.\nAdams, who campaigned, in part, on reforming property taxes, told a state senator on\nTin Cup Day\nlast year that his administration was working on its own reform proposals. That plan never materialized.\nNow Mamdani is reiterating his earlier vows to take up the mantle with Albany. His budget director, Sherif Soliman, said on Tuesday that those reforms would be based on the de Blasio administration\u2019s property tax commission\u2019s 2021 report and would likely include scrapping limits on increasing assessed values and assessing co-ops and condos using a sales-based market value instead of rentals.\nThat timeline and framework for reform, though vague, could be an indication that his administration is\ncloser than its predecessors\nto actually changing the tax system, yet they appear to be falling back on the same excuse that has largely kept reform at bay.\n\u201cNew York City doesn\u2019t need Albany\u2019s permission to fix the property tax system,\u201d Martha Stark, policy director for Tax Equity Now New York, said in a statement. Stark\u2019s organization, also known as TENNY, is in the midst of a decade-long lawsuit against the city over alleged inequities in the system.\nProperty tax reform is New York\u2019s hot potato. Mayors punt the issue to their successors, arguing the power to change the system rests with Albany. Meanwhile state lawmakers say the only way to greenlight reform is if a plan is championed by the mayor.\nThe back-and-forth is one of the reasons reform has remained elusive, though Stark\u2019s group has pushed back against previous administrations\u2019 positions that the city doesn\u2019t have the authority to make meaningful changes. While the system is established under state law, TENNY has argued that the city has control over how properties are assessed and could amend assessment methods that have led to the alleged overtaxation of homeowners in lower-income neighborhoods.\nA Court of Appeals judge\nessentially agreed\nwith TENNY in 2024 when it opted to revive some of the organization\u2019s claims against the city and dismissed others involving the state.\n\u201cThe Court of Appeals made it clear that the City has the authority and legal obligation to assess properties uniformly,\u201d Stark said in the statement. \u201cA lawful system can start today. The law is clear, and every day that uniform assessments are delayed, New Yorkers pay the price.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nThe Alexander brothers\u2019 federal trial resumes next week, with disgraced brokers Tal and Oren Alexander and their brother, Alon, facing 12 charges related to sex trafficking. I\u2019ll be back in the courtroom with my colleague, Katherine Kallergis, on Tuesday. What do you want to know about the trial so far? Send thoughts to\nsheridan.wall@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nIn Montreal, sanitation workers use a snow vacuum to clean up streets after a storm \u2014 a machine New York City officials attempted to use decades ago but couldn\u2019t due to the amount of trash buried in snow piles, according to\nGothamist\n. The Canadian city also has a snow removal budget of more than $200 million, which is more than double the average amount spent in New York over the past five years.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 Speaking of snow, New York City and the surrounding area, including Long Island, Westchester and parts of Connecticut, could be on tap for more on Sunday. The amount of snow forecast differs between reports \u2014\nGothamist\nprojected three to five inches, while\nNewsday\nestimated as much as six to 10 inches.\n\u2014 The roughly 4,000 nurses still on strike in New York City agreed to a tentative deal with New York Presbyterian and Columbia hospitals, ending a nearly six-week-long strike, according to the\nNew York Times\n. The agreement follows another reached with nurses at the Mount Sinai hospital system last week.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$19.8 million\nfor 200 East 75th Street, 12A. The Lenox Hill condo is 6,100 square feet.\nCompass\u2019\nAlexa Lambert, Susan Wires and Marc Achilles have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$10.5 million\nfor 3 East 9th Street. The Greenwich Village apartment is five stories and 8,200 square feet.\nThe Corcoran Group\u2019s\nSteve Gold and William McLarnon have the listing.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $10 million for 10 Gracie Square, Unit 3/4C. The Upper East Side co-op is 5,200 square feet.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\nhas the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permits filed were for a proposed 41,400-square-foot, seven-story building at 87 Havemeyer Street in Williamsburg. Kao-Hwa Lee Architects is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "The Sunny Isles Beach City Commission voted in favor of Related Group, Dezer Development and BH Group\u2019s proposed condo tower, despite mounting concerns from neighboring residents and disagreements on the commission.\nRelated, Dezer and BH filed plans for a 62-story, 145-unit condo tower on the site of the former Miami Beach Club at 19051 Collins Avenue months after they completed\na $131.8 million buyout\nof the 108-unit complex.\nThe 2-acre site is immediately north of\nResidences by Armani/Casa\n, a luxury condo tower that Related and Dezer co-developed.\nAs a result of residents\u2019 concerns about safety and the effect on structural integrity of surrounding buildings, the developers agreed to monitor vibrations and subsidence during construction and for one year after.\nThe city agreed to sell development rights and assign them to the site for more than $26 million, allowing for a larger project. The transfer of development rights (TDRs) would give the developers an additional 121,000 square feet of floor area ratio, but they plan to build fewer units than they can by right.\nAfter 10 p.m. on Thursday, commissioners Alex Lama, Fabiola Stuyvesant and Jennifer Viscarra and Mayor Larisa Svechin voted in favor, and commissioner Jerry Joseph was the sole no vote. They granted site plan approval and a resolution tied to the TDRs.\n\u201cAfter this leaves tonight, there is nothing that the city can do to protect the residents,\u201d Joseph said in response to dialogue about the developers continuing to work with residents on an agreement that would ease their concerns.\nStuyvesant suggested Mayor Svechin\u2019s vote was compromised because the developers made \u201ca massive investment\u201d helping get her elected, Stuyvesant said.\nSvechin said the city is bound by its own code. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about what we personally want,\u201d she said.\nOne neighboring resident, Dr. Oliver Drabkin, made the point that none of the commissioners live on the east side of Collins Avenue, where the project is planned: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like somebody in Oklahoma giving zoning in downtown Manhattan.\u201d Drabkin said he felt \u201cbetrayed\u201d by the commission.\nIn an ironic turn of events, owners at Armani/Casa hired their own attorney, Alessandra Stivelman, to represent them in their opposition to this project. Stivelman told\nThe Real Deal\nearlier this week that Thursday\u2019s meeting marked the city commission\u2019s last opportunity to vote on the plans.\nStivelman said that the developers failed to address her clients\u2019 concerns, including emergency access, traffic and fears following the deadly collapse of Champlain Towers South in Surfside in 2021.\n\u201cThe developer is giving us a big middle finger,\u201d Stivelman said.\nTMB RE Investments LLC is the developer. An ownership chart submitted to Sunny Isles in December 2024 shows that a Delaware entity, BLFO MBC Member LLC, owns 75 percent. That LLC is owned by Bahamian entities tied to a Brazilian family. The remaining 25 percent is owned by the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related, the Dezer family firm and Isaac and Liat Toledano\u2019s BH.\nIn their application, the developers stated that the project could cost about $294 million to build, and it has an anticipated completion date of December 2031. The developers are seeking up to five years from approval to obtain a building permit, and up to five years from the issuance of a building permit to complete the tower.\nThe tower is expected to include a padel court, pool deck, water features and a sculpture garden on the west-facing side of the property, and a lap pool, outdoor spa, cabanas and beach access on the east.\nThe owners\u2019 complicated buyout of Miami Beach Club dragged on for more than a decade. Miami Beach Club\u2019s condo association and at least\none unit owner\nsued the Related/Dezer entity that developed Residences by Armani/Casa. One lawsuit over construction next door was dismissed in 2022.\n",

        "content": "The Florida House of Representatives voted to eliminate non-school property taxes on primary residences, in a measure that still requires approval from the state Senate and 60 percent of voters in a November election.\nThe House vote marked the first approval of the proposal following months of debate and controversy after Gov. Ron DeSantis first floated the\nidea\nlast year.\nLawmakers approved House Joint Resolution 203, introduced by Rep. Monique Miller, a Republican of Palm Bay, after they substantially revised her item to entirely nix property taxes on homesteads, WLRN\nreported\n.\nThe\noriginal proposal\ncalled for a phaseout of taxes by increasing homestead exemptions by $100,000 annually for 10 years until 2037. On Thursday, the House voted 80-30 along party lines, with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposing.\nThe resolution mandates that counties and municipalities cannot decrease funding for law enforcement, firefighters and other first responders.\nFlorida would become the first state to scrap property taxes on homesteads, though the item is far from final. Before it gets to voters in the November ballot, where it would need 60 percent approval, it still needs a nod from the Senate.\nIt\u2019s widely expected the Senate and DeSantis would prefer to have the measure vetted and voted on during a special session held after the legislative session ends on March 13.\n\u201cRegarding a property tax proposal for the 2026 ballot: we\u2019ve been working with members of the Senate who have been great partners,\u201d DeSantis posted on\nX\non Thursday, before the House vote. \u201cGiven that it can\u2019t be voted on by the people before November, it\u2019s better to do it right than do it quick!\u201d\nDeSantis, who doesn\u2019t have to sign off on the measure, floated\neliminating property taxes\nas a way to alleviate Florida\u2019s affordability crisis and promote homeownership, saying in a\nstatement\nlast year the taxes \u201ceffectively require homeowners to pay rent to the government.\u201d\nFlorida\u2019s Revenue Estimating Conference projects a\n$13.3 billion\nannual hit to local governments\u2019 budgets from HJR 203.\nDuring debate on Thursday, Rep. Rita Harris, a Democrat of Orlando called out the measure.\n\u201cWe are defunding the police,\u201d Harris said, according to WLRN. \u201cWe are defunding the fire. We are defunding the garbage. We are defunding the schools. We are defunding the waste management. We are defunding people cutting your trees during storm season. We are defunding the state of Florida.\u201d\nLawmakers have proposed seven constitutional amendments this year proposing various property tax cuts on homesteads. Aside from HJR 203, only two others have advanced through House committees.\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\nLidia Dinkova\n",

        "content": "A civil war is erupting within the Ozinga concrete dynasty, threatening to crack the foundation of one of the most influential forces in Chicago\u2019s construction materials and real estate industries.\nBrothers Justin and Karl Ozinga filed a lawsuit Wednesday against their four other brothers in Cook County court, alleging that their sibling and CEO of Mokena-based Ozinga, Martin \u201cMarty\u201d Ozinga IV, has orchestrated a \u201ccalculated effort\u201d to strip them of their oversight of the prominent multi-generational family business.\nThe lawsuit, seeking emergency injunctive relief, claims Marty is attempting to bypass a strict family consensus requirement to push through a $50 million acquisition of a rival ready-mix concrete company.\n\u201cOur clients, Justin and Karl Ozinga, have been a big part of the Ozinga story, which is the story of a great Chicago family and an iconic Chicago company. Everyone who lives in this area recognizes Ozinga\u2019s signature red and white striped Ready-Mix Concrete trucks,\u201d their lawyer John C. Sciaccotta said in a statement. \u201cJustin and Karl Ozinga\u2019s father left an identical 15.34 percent of the family business to each of his six sons. Our clients filed this lawsuit in order to protect their legacy, their inheritance, and, ultimately, to protect the Ozinga family of companies.\u201d\nIn addition to the company\u2019s prominent position as a concrete supplier to major property developers, the family\u2019s investment arm, Ozinga Ventures, has made several significant real estate investments. They include planning the controversial and still unstarted project known as\n\u201cThe Invert\u201d on the Southeast Side\nthat proposes to build a 6 million-square-foot storage facility deep underground a former steel mill site. The investment arm, headed by Aaron Ozinga, also lists investments in\nco-working company Workbox\nand Chicago-based multifamily firm Concord Capital.\n\u201cWhile we do not comment on family matters, we want to assure our coworkers, customers and communities that our operations remain unaffected and that our commitment to making a positive impact carries on,\u201d a company spokesperson for Ozinga said in a statement. The spokesperson didn\u2019t make Marty Ozinga IV available for an interview requested by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe dispute centers on the Ozinga Children\u2019s Investment Trust, established by the family\u2019s late patriarch, Martin Ozinga III, who\ndied in 2021 at age 71\n. To ensure his six sons remained equal, the elder Ozinga required a \u201cSpecial Fiduciary Committee\u201d to approve all trust investments through a unanimous vote, according to the suit.\nMarty Ozinga IV has allegedly ignored this \u201cultimate protection,\u201d the suit says. The plaintiffs claim Marty diverted roughly $30 million in\nOzinga Bros.\nprofit distributions away from the brothers\u2019 individual trusts and into \u201cOzinga Stewards,\u201d a family office entity Marty Ozinga allegedly uses as a personal war chest. The suit alleges he plans to use these \u201cparked\u201d funds to finance the $50 million acquisition of the competing concrete company, despite formal objections from Justin and Karl Ozinga.\nThe lawsuit reveals internal tension regarding the financial stability of the Ozinga enterprise, specifically highlighting debt-related concerns. Despite the large scale of the Ozinga enterprise \u2014 one of Illinois\u2019 largest private family-owned companies \u2014 its principal lender, which isn\u2019t named in the suit, requires a personal guarantee and a pledge of Ozinga Bros. stock from every individual owner, creating personal financial exposure for each brother, the suit says.\nIt also details massive cost overruns, with concerns escalating with the 2022 groundbreaking on an Ozinga grinding mill in East Chicago,\nIndiana,\njust over the state line from Chicago city limits. Originally budgeted at $65 million, the project\u2019s total cost skyrocketed to over $150 million by the end of 2025 without formal board approval for the increased amount, the suit claims.\nLast year, the company was allegedly forced to refinance its principal loan facility to avoid, or remedy, violations of loan covenants. According to the suit, his maneuver increased Ozinga Bros. cost of capital due to a higher interest rate and incurred about $300,000 in fees, despite the plaintiffs\u2019 objections and the availability of cash reserves that could have addressed the crisis.\nThe financial strain was so heavy that Justin Ozinga proposed selling the core Midwest ready-mix concrete business \u2014 the family\u2019s nearly 100-year-old legacy \u2014 as a means to eliminate the debt load, a suggestion Marty Ozinga IV reportedly characterized as a \u201ccoup\u201d when he heard the idea had been discussed with other siblings, the suit says.\nWith a \u201cdrop dead\u201d closing date for the new $50 million acquisition set for Feb. 28, the plaintiffs are asking the court to freeze the funds. If they fail, they warn the Ozinga empire will be forced into a transaction that \u201ccannot be unwound,\u201d forever altering the legacy of a Chicago business institution.\n",

        "content": "A century-old Chicago lender is trading LaSalle Street for Wacker Drive, as the Loop\u2019s office-to-resi push reshapes its longtime home.\nAmalgamated Bank of Chicago, also known as ABOC, signed a 12-year lease for roughly 40,000 square feet at the building at 101 North Wacker Drive, the bank\nconfirmed\nto CoStar News. The deal will house a new branch and executive offices, with a move-in slated for the fall.\nThe relocation pulls the 104-year-old institution from its current headquarters at\n30 North LaSalle Street\n, a 43-story tower slated for a partial residential\nconversion\n. Plans call for 349 apartments as part of the city\u2019s broader effort to swap aging Loop office space for housing, particularly along the LaSalle Street corridor.\nThe lease comes a little more than a decade after ABOC moved into the building at 30 North LaSalle Street following the sale of its prior\n100 South State Street\nheadquarters building. This time, the bank is opting for a riverfront address in a 23-story tower completed in 1976 and owned by LaSalle Investment Management. The building is more than 81 percent leased, according to CoStar data.\nJeff Dowdell and Lauren Sharpe of Telos Group represent the landlord in leasing.\nIn a statement to CoStar, a bank spokesperson cited the move as modernizing and a chance to plant itself in one of the city\u2019s most sought-after office corridors. The shift also reflects a broader tenant recalibration in the Loop, where firms are gravitating toward newer or recently updated buildings, as older towers struggle with vacancies and repositionings, according to the publication.\nFounded in 1922 by the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union, now known as Workers United, the bank historically served union members and local businesses. It remains independent after a proposed $98 million sale to New York-based Amalgamated Bank\u2019s publicly traded parent company, Amalgamated Financial,\nfell apart in 2022\n. The parent company cited an inability to obtain Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation approval and walked away from the deal, prompting pushback from the Chicago bank.\nThe New York bank was founded by labor organizer Sidney Hillman in 1923 and the leaders of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, according to its website, though the two banks remain unaffiliated.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The seller was Chicago-based Convexity Properties. The deal closed Wednesday evening, but has yet to be recorded in county property records.\nPricing wasn\u2019t disclosed, though the Dallas Central Appraisal District recently valued the property at about $131 million for tax purposes. Northmarq, the brokerage that represented\nConvexity\nin the sale, said in a news release that the sale marks the second-largest single-property apartment sale in North Texas since late 2022 and ranks among the top 10 largest single-property multifamily trades in the past seven years.\nEastline Residences has kept about 95 percent average occupancy since opening, as well as 4 percent rent growth in the past 12 months,\nNorthmarq\nSenior Vice President Eric Stockley said in a statement. Stockley was joined by Northmarq\u2019s Taylor Snoddy, Charles Hubbard, Lauren Bresky and Kevin Leamy.\nEastline\u2019s development began in 2018 after Convexity acquired the neighboring Twin Sixties office tower and hotel. The 28-story project features a 28th-floor sky lounge and an outdoor pool overlooking Dallas and the Park Cities, and offers 330 Class A units. The apartments opened in 2021.\nFor the\nKushner Companies\n, the acquisition adds to a growing Texas portfolio. The multigenerational firm owns more than 27,000 apartments across 14 states and has roughly 10,000 units under development, according to its website. In Texas, it controls more than 2,300 units, including Mansfield on the Green in Mansfield southeast of\nDallas\nnear Joe Pool Lake.\nThe company was previously led by Jared Kushner, who stepped down as CEO in 2017 to serve as a senior adviser to his father-in-law, Donald Trump. Kushner retains a 20 percent stake in the firm, valued at $560 million in late 2025, according to Forbes.\nLarge, single-property trades have been scarce since 2022, making Eastline\u2019s sale a bellwether for pricing at the top end of the market in a supply-constrained corridor, according to the release.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Data on trophy rentals is tough to pin down, but this is likely among the most expensive leases ever inked in New York City.\nThe two hefty leases came as inventory for Manhattan\u2019s trophy rentals \u2014 which appraiser Jonathan Miller defines as the top 1 percent of the market, with rates starting at $25,000 a month \u2014 was down more than 40 percent year-over-year in January, as new leases climbed (albeit, at a more modest pace).\nThe momentum has been building since before the pandemic and\naccelerated early last year,\nwhen leases asking $20,000 a month or more picked up, according to data from UrbanDigs.\nThough prices have been on the rise, agents say the big-ticket numbers are exceeding their expectations.\n\u201cI personally have never seen prices where they\u2019re at,\u201d Douglas Elliman\u2019s John Giannone told\nThe Real Deal\nin December. \u201cWhen the high $100s per square foot for a rental starts to become like the norm, it\u2019s completely different from what we\u2019re used to.\u201d\nMiller attributed the uptick in rentals to the strength of the ultra-luxury market, which logged a number of notable deals through the end of 2025 and early 2026.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really so dominant,\u201d Miller said of the ultraluxury market. When deep-pocketed buyers \u201ccan\u2019t get the place they want, they lease.\u201d\nSerhant\u2019s Peter Zaitzeff, who worked on the rental deal at Naftali\u2019s the Benson with Giannone and the Lauran Muss Team, chalked the monthly price up to a dearth of supply and \u201cpeople willing to pay what it takes to get a deal done.\u201d\nMarket data show ultra high-end rentals are on the rise, but remain a limited field as leases of this caliber are often the result of particular circumstances in the lives of the owner or the tenant.\nZaitzeff\u2019s clients, for example, were looking to rent while renovating their townhouse. Julia Haart, co-owner of the modeling agency Elite World Group,\nopted to rent\nthe sprawling 70 Vestry Street penthouse she bought with her estranged husband, Silvio Scaglia, for $125,000 a month during their contentious divorce battle. (Haart, who kept the triplex in the divorce, sold it earlier this month for\n$57 million\n.)\nNot so fast\u2026\nIn a market starved for inventory, the shiny new stuff is winning.\nLegion Investment Group and Nahla Capital\u2019s 1122 Madison Avenue claimed the top two spots in\nOlshan Realty\u2019s weekly report\n, with contracts out for condos asking $39 million and $36.5 million. They were the priciest of the 31 Manhattan homes asking $4 million or more that found buyers between Feb. 9 and Feb. 15.\nThe 26-unit Upper East Side building has already\ntopped weekly contract reports\ntwice since launching sales last month and is also muscling its way into monthly new development reports.\nCorcoran Sunshine, which is handling sales, reported the project logged 10 signed contracts in January \u2014 more than any other new development \u2014 at an average asking price north of $4,200 a foot. Marketproof\ngave the monthly crown\nto the Strathmore with 13 deals inked, but flagged a nearly $23 million pending contract at 1122 Madison as one of January\u2019s standouts.\nThe early momentum isn\u2019t happening in a vacuum. Manhattan\u2019s new development pipeline has\nwaned significantly\n, with few projects launching even as demand remains high.\n\u201cIn terms of actual inventory delivery to the market, you\u2019re seeing a lull,\u201d Reuveni Development Marketing\u2019s Daniel Pupke told\nTRD\nlast fall. \u201cWe\u2019re in between two eras of cycles.\u201d\nIn the meantime, developers like Legion and Nahla are betting on\nboutique projects\nin blue-chip neighborhoods, instead of the Billionaires\u2019 Row supertalls that once drove the luxury new development market in Manhattan.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nTwo 78th-floor units at 432 Park Avenue traded for\n$52.5 million\n, marking the priciest deal to hit the city\u2019s rolls this week. The apartments were at the heart of a dispute between the buildings\u2019 developers, Harry Maclowe and CIM Group. Macklowe forfeited the units to CIM Group last year after defaulting on loans from the company.\n",

        "content": "The groundbreaking on Wednesday for Timbale Terrace, a project by Emanuel Kokinakis\u2019 Mega Group and Dan Kent\u2019s Lantern Organization, was a perfect event for Mayor Zohran Mamdani to attend. It\u2019s a model for what he wants to build: 100 percent affordable housing on city land.\nBut is it a perfect model? Far from it.\nMamdani\u2019s goal is to build 200,000 units in 10 years. Don\u2019t hold your breath. Because the city\u2019s processes are so cumbersome, Timbale Terrace took 10 years just to break ground and won\u2019t open until 2028.\nIt took five years for the city to pick a developer and another five years for the environmental review, rezoning and financing, \u201can incredibly slow pace that\u2019s not appropriate to the urgency of this crisis,\u201d said Annemarie Gray of pro-housing group Open New York.\nIf all projects took 13 years as this one will, for Mamdani to meet his deadline, he would have had to start the process for 200,000 units three years ago.\nThe mayor doesn\u2019t even have a City Planning director yet, but maybe his new\nchief technology officer\ncan build him a time machine.\nTime is one problem. Another is money. Timbale Terrace is costing $255 million for 341 apartments, which is $750,000 per unit \u2014\ntypical for affordable housing\n, but 50 percent more than Mamdani aims to spend. (The price tag includes an NYPD garage and a 21,000-square-foot cultural space, but the land was free.)\nA third issue is that city agencies are generally reluctant to give up their property for housing, as it did here. That, to me, is a greater concern than what Alicia Glen, the former deputy mayor, said at a\nTRD\nSalon Series\ninterview\n, which is that the city no longer owns much buildable land.\nIt has some. CUNY has\nmore than 80 acres\nof surface parking, and every NYCHA campus has underused or unusable space. Some public schools have staff parking \u2014 a perquisite, not a prerequisite. Timbale Terrace is replacing an NYPD lot.\nPutting housing on such land always involves a fight. The Related Companies\u2019\nproject\nat the Elliott-Chelsea Houses in Manhattan is a case in point.\nThe NYPD is already so desperate for its beloved parking that cops routinely plant their personal vehicles and patrol cars on sidewalks. The police don\u2019t even like to give up their impound lots.\nA fourth shortcoming of Timbale Terrace is something politicians avoid discussing: the\ndownside of concentrating poverty\n.\nAlthough Mamdani said at the groundbreaking that \u201cby building deeply affordable homes across the five boroughs, we are making New York City a place families can afford to stay and thrive,\u201d children in such homes typically don\u2019t thrive.\nWhen surrounded by poor role models and folks without social capital, it\u2019s hard to see pathways to success.\nAs Eva Chan, who helped create the Harlem East Block Association and owns a three-unit rental building across from the Timbale Terrace site, told the\nNew York Times\n, the city consistently places projects for low-income and homeless people in East Harlem. I\u2019m no fan of NIMBYs, but she has a point.\nMamdani, like Chan, believes wealthier neighborhoods should get more affordable housing. But they almost never do.\nIt\u2019s not just because the resistance would be severe. It\u2019s that the economics of building affordable housing in rich areas rarely work. Where in Tribeca could Timbale Terrace conceivably go?\nUnfortunately, project economics can\u2019t factor in the long-term benefits that low-income children reap from growing up in high-opportunity neighborhoods, with peers who have high aspirations and lots of connections.\nHarvard economist Raz Chetty just published another\nbrilliant study\nabout these gains. For details, check out this\nPlanet Money podcast\nor this\nAtlantic story\n.\nI emailed those links on Feb. 15 to Layla Law-Gisiko, a leading opponent of Related\u2019s mixed-income project in West Chelsea, to see if they might change her opinion. She hasn\u2019t replied. I\u2019m not holding my breath.\n",

        "content": "Gencom planted another flag along Central Park South.\nThe Miami-based investor\npaid about $320 million\nfor the 253-key Ritz-Carlton Central Park South at 50 Central Park South, adding a third Manhattan hotel to a rapidly expanding local portfolio.\nProperty records show a $270 million transfer price, though that figure excludes fixtures and other non-real estate assets. Banco Inbursa provided a $235 million acquisition loan, assuming and upsizing debt originally issued by KeyBank.\nThe seller, Westbrook Partners, had owned a stake in the property since 2012, when it paid $105 million for an interest from Millennium Partners.\nThe deal pushes Gencom deeper into New York at a moment when other markets remain choppy and financing is still selective.\nIn 2024, the firm acquired the Thompson Central Park, followed by the InterContinental New York Times Square this past year. The Ritz-Carlton Central Park South deal gives Gencom a trio of high-profile, brand-name assets in core Manhattan locations \u2014 Central Park South and Times Square \u2014 effectively doubling down on the city\u2019s top leisure and corporate corridors.\nThe strategy tracks with Gencom\u2019s broader luxury push. Founded in 1987, the firm manages nearly $8 billion in assets and has built its brand around institutional-quality hospitality tied to flags such as Four Seasons, St. Regis and Auberge. In New York, it appears to be leaning into irreplaceable locations with strong rate power rather than chasing distressed, outer-borough or conversion plays.\nThe city\u2019s luxury hotel segment has quietly reasserted itself, buoyed by international tourism, constrained new supply and resilient room rates at the high end. Trophy trades remain rare, but well-capitalized buyers are circling.\nAt roughly $1.26 million per key based on the headline price, the Ritz-Carlton deal signals confidence that Manhattan\u2019s upper-tier hotels can sustain premium pricing.\nThis week\u2019s medal podium couldn\u2019t be contained to a gold, silver and bronze story. There\u2019s simply too much going on in New York City real estate.\nNext up, rent freeze? Mamdani names five new members to rent board\nMayor Zohran Mamdani named five new members to the Rent Guidelines Board, meaning his appointees make up a majority of the body as he advocates for a rent freeze on stabilized apartments.\nThe mayor tapped Chatnella Mitchell as the new chair and appointees include owner representative Maksim Wynn and public members Sina Sinai, Lauren Melodia, and Brandon Mancilla.\nPublic member Alex Armlovich stepped down early, urging the board to consider owner representative Arpit Gupta\u2019s \u201cslumlord freeze\u201d proposal, which would tie rent freezes to a landlord\u2019s performance.\nThe mayor opted to reappoint tenant representative Ad\u00e1n Soltren instead of naming a sixth new member.\nRon Perelman offloads Upper East Side townhouse for $47M\nBillionaire Ron Perelman sold his Upper East Side townhouse at 36 East 63rd Street for $46.75 million, which was nearly six years after it was first listed with an asking price of $65 million.\nThe sale is part of a broader effort by Perelman to sell off assets \u2014 including his Hamptons estate for $84 million in 2022 \u2014 to pursue a \u201csimpler life.\u201d\nThe 40-foot-wide Neo Georgian Mansion, which was once a private club for aviators, rotated through several top brokers over the years, with the final price significantly lower than its initial and later reduced asking prices.\nMark Nussbaum turns on former \u201cbro\u201d Tzali Chopp over unpaid debt\nDisgraced attorney and fixer Mark Nussbaum is turning against his former friend and deal partner as creditors seek to collect more than $400 million in missing escrow funds.\nSheldon Eisenberger, an attorney handling the wind-down and liquidation of Nussbaum\u2019s former law firms, has launched a lawsuit against nursing home entrepreneur and Nussbaum\u2019s former friend Tzali Chopp of Opal Healthcare.\nThe lawsuit filed in the Southern District of New York alleges Chopp failed to pay back a $3 million loan from Nussbaum. Eisenberger now alleges Chopp owes $6.3 million with interest.\nMeet David Mitchell: The down-on-his-luck real estate guy Jeffrey Epstein kept close\nFinally,\nThe Real Deal\nlooked into the relationship between Jeffrey Epstein and New York developer David Mitchell, which was primarily transactional: Epstein sought to leverage Mitchell for social connections to New York\u2019s upper crust, while Mitchell relied on Epstein for short-term loans and financial assistance.\nEpstein provided more than $2 million in loans and invested in Mitchell\u2019s ventures, such as the Life Hotel and an Upper East Side condo project, none of which appeared to be financially successful for Epstein.\nFollowing Epstein\u2019s death, Mitchell continued to face severe financial and legal challenges.\n",

        "content": "Santa Monica-based\nMacerich has joined the parade of REITs selling off real estate, with the retail specialist dumping more than a billion dollars worth of property in the last year and a half.\nAnd it isn\u2019t through.\nMacerich is now under contract to offload a mall in coastal Santa Barbara, which should close next quarter and command an $11 million price tag, the company said during a fourth-quarter and full-year earnings call, when chief executive Jack Hsieh touted the \u201cpath forward plan\u201d he introduced two years ago when he snagged the corner office and set out to pay down debt.\nMacerich sold a sprawling shopping center in the Long Beach suburb of Lakewood for $332 million, last year \u2014 a deal that included the buyer\u2019s assumption of a $317 million loan, which was set to mature soon. That was an improvement from a year earlier, when the company surrendered its hometown Santa Monica Place mall to lenders after defaulting on a $300 million loan.\nMacerich isn\u2019t the only REIT in the L.A. area offloading real estate. Rexford\u2019s recent earnings call included words on the industrial specialist\u2019s\nplans\nto dispose of $400 million to $500 million of assets this year (it had already peddled seven properties for a total of $217.5 million in 2025). Kilroy, similarly, said it would continue to\ndispose\nof non-core real estate during its call after selling offices in Santa Monica, Hollywood and San Diego.\nVictor Coleman\u2019s Hudson Pacific Properties is next to report earnings, so stay tuned. Hudson Pac\u2019s losses have been ballooning amid\noffice and studio pain. It\u2019s been sorting out its portfolio, too \u2014 in December it\nsold\na Los Angeles office campus to its tenant at a price that allowed it to pay off the commercial mortgage-backed securities debt connected to the property.\nOn retainer\nOne California Plaza \u2014 the Bunker Hill office tower that Rising Realty Partners and DigitalBridge own but lost to a\nreceiver\nafter a $300 million default amid downtown Los Angeles\u2019 distress \u2014 still brings Chris Rising\u2019s outfit some revenue.\nReceiver Trigild kept Rising Realty on to manage the million-square-foot tower downtown days after it was appointed by the court in late August. The latest receiver report notes Rising Realty Partners\u2019 third-party property management business was paid $265,000 via a management fee for the five months ended December. JLL, responsible for leasing, made $90,000 during the same period, part of the tower\u2019s total operating expenses, which amounted to almost $9 million.\nRising said he pitched the business at a discounted rate and because his team has a relationship with tenants. That\u2019s good for bond holders and good for the receiver, who wants continuity, he said.\nJLL, Trigild and an attorney for the receiver did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nHalf price\nThe price of TruAmerica\u2019s recent Luxe Villas and Haven Apartments purchase was previously\nundisclosed\n. The mystery is half-solved. Luxe Villas located in Brentwood traded for about $50 million, or more than $800,000 per unit. That covers the refinancing loan Gortikov Capital\nlanded\ntwo years ago for the 60-unit property. How much Cityview sold its 97 units, called the Haven Apartments, in Culver City to TruAmerica is still unknown \u2026 for now. IPA\u2019s Kevin Green, Joseph Grabiec and Gregory Harris brokered the deals.\nMore pain\nLos Angeles\u2019 office and hotel distress persists, whether it be Jade Enterprises\u2019 loan backing Sawtelle offices\nlanding\nin special servicing, or Grant King\nhanding back\nthe keys to a Hollywood hotel \u2014 his last in Tinseltown, where he dreamed of developing a mini-hotel empire.\nThe commercial mortgage-backed securities debt on the office building at 1950 Sawtelle Boulevard in West Los Angeles\u2019 Sawtelle Japantown neighborhood went to special servicing after the borrower failed to pay it off at its January maturity date. The three-story, 100,000-square-foot, red-brick building was only 43 percent occupied last summer after its largest tenant reduced its space and another left.\nLender LCP Group snatched the trendy Dream Hollywood Hotel at 6417 Selma Avenue via a deed in lieu of foreclosure signed by King. He lost his other two Hollywood hotels, the Tommie and Thompson, to lenders, three years ago.\n",

        "content": "Tech billionaires have upped their political ante in recent years. The latest cause d\u2019action is the specter of a statewide vote on a billionaires tax in November.\nThat proposal would impose a one-time, 5 percent tax on California residents with a net worth of more than $1 billion. This figures to affect about 200 people, and is estimated to raise $100 billion. The petition began circulating in late December, and will need to secure nearly 875,000 signatures to qualify for the November election.\nObservers have disagreed on whether this tax would have a meaningful impact on the real estate market in California. Billionaires operate at the top echelons of the market, so an exodus that leads to them selling their property would certainly hit the very tip of the residential market but wouldn\u2019t have a direct downstream effect on housing.\nHowever, the tax could scare business owners from moving their companies to the state, which could weaken demand downstream. And, as one realtor\ntold the San Francisco Chronicle last week\n, entrepreneurs may choose to\u00a0 launch a new business outside of California for fear that the state could impose another wealth tax in the future. There is also the concern that a particularly peeved CEO could take their business out of California because of the tax.\nOf course, the state\u2019s billionaires, generally, are not in favor. Neither is Gov. Gavin Newsom.\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is\n, though, and politicians have clashed over the issue. Newsom believes statewide wealth taxes create a disadvantage for the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, and is working to spike the initiative before it qualifies for the ballot.\nBloomberg and Politico report that Building a Better California, the nonprofit political organization backed by former and current executives at companies like Google, DoorDash, and Stripe, is planning to help circulate a series of alternative petitions that, if qualified and passed, would invalidate the billionaires tax. The largest supporter is former Google president and co-founder Sergey Brin, who appears to have already fled the state for Nevada.\nHowever, Building a Better California will be worth watching because of its other pursuits beyond the billionaire\u2019s tax. The group spent $6 million in backing a ballot initiative that seeks to make it easier for middle-income earners to enter the housing market. It also put $5 million behind a group pushing for housing-centric changes to the California Environmental Quality Act.\nJanuary condo sales in San Francisco dip to eight-year lows\nCondo sales in San Francisco during the month of January dropped to 94, marking the second slowest January since at least 2018, according to a report from Compass earlier this week. The average price per square foot for those sales hit $997, the lowest January mark over that same time period.\nAverage time on the market for condo listings in the city also eclipsed 100 for the first time in at least a year.\nThese numbers counter the red-hot narrative around San Francisco\u2019s residential market over the last year, which has\nseen rents soar\nand\nmillionaires experience a mansion shortage\n. However, Compass\u2019 Krysen Heathwood, who oversees condo sales in the Western U.S., said in a statement that February is shaping up to be a strong month.\nCondos have\u00a0 hardly been developed in California since the Great Recession. Between 2011 and 2021 (the latest data available) only 3 percent of the multifamily housing built in the state were for-sale units. The state\u2019s condo defect laws take much of the blame here, which leave developers vulnerable to costly defect lawsuits for a decade after the condominium is completed.\nFreedom West 2.0 inches forward\nThe $2.3 billion mixed-use proposal in San Francisco\u2019s Western Addition neighborhood crept forward last week after the city\u2019s planning commission advanced the project into environmental review.\nThe public now has the chance to comment on the draft environmental impact report, arguably the most onerous part of project approval in California. The project, led by local developer MacFarlane Partners,\nhad stalled as the developers worked to raise capital.\nNow it could break ground on the three-phase development as early as next year. Freedom West 2.0, at full build-out, will include 15 buildings, 2,291 apartments, 668,600 square feet of retail, 14,800 square feet of cultural, institutional, or educational-zoned area, and a 150-key hotel.\nCEO Victor MacFarlane told The Real Deal last year that this project\nwould be his firm\u2019s swan song\n.\n",
