        "content": "A judge is blasting OYO Hotels for its actions at a Times Square hotel, where a\ndispute\nis raging between the company and its former manager, Highgate Hotels.\nOn Tuesday, a judge found OYO Hotels in contempt after violating a previous order, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The decision puts OYO on the hook for legal fees in the dispute, which could fall in the six-figure range when determined next week.\nThe judge pulled no punches in finding OYO in contempt for firing the property\u2019s manager and dozens of unionized employees, despite\nan order\nnot to do so.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what more you could do to be in contempt. I really don\u2019t,\u201d New York state Supreme Court Judge Andrea Masley said. \u201cThis is contempt if I ever saw it.\u201d\nThe judge also admonished OYO for not adhering to a contract that dictated how the company and Highgate would go their separate ways.\nOYO did not respond to a request for comment about the contempt finding or the dispute with Highgate.\nIn early August, OYO allegedly blindsided the property manager Highgate with a notice canceling its contract, according to a lawsuit filed by Highgate. The cancellation attempt came four years ahead of schedule and included the citation of issues related to an entirely different property Highgate operates.\nThe 10-year management agreement entitled Highgate to a 3.25 percent cut of the 208-key hotel\u2019s gross revenue. OYO is supposed to provide working capital to the property, which Highgate described as \u201cwell-performing.\u201d\nOYO disagreed with Highgate\u2019s characterization of performance in the termination notice. The hotel owner said it plans to welcome a new property manager, though at the moment, that property manager appears to be OYO.\nTerminating Highgate\u2019s contract could be a way for OYO to cut expenses and boost earnings before an expected initial public offering.\nOYO,\nbacked by SoftBank\n, bought Motel 6 from Blackstone for $525 million and is preparing an IPO that could value the company at $8 billion.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The slowdown in demand for life sciences space is leading one of the Bay Area\u2019s biggest landlords in the sector to sell its land for residential use.\nAlexandria Real Estate Equities is\nplanning\nfor up to 35 percent of its $2.9 billion in asset sales this year to be land, with most of it poised for possible housing development, the San Francisco Business Times reported.\nThe Pasadena-based firm is already moving to offload some of its properties in the region. Alexandria is expected to\nput its 88 Bluxome Street site in San Francisco on the market\nin the first half of the year. The company has also begun marketing sites near Stanford University in Palo Alto for housing and is expected to sell the land within the next year.\nAlexandria saw almost $1.9 billion in write-downs last year, marking a nearly tenfold increase from 2024. With heightened surplus supply across the Bay Area, many developers are shying away from building new life sciences projects after the pre-pandemic biotech boom. Vacancy is approximately 24 percent, according to Savills data cited by the Business Times.\nLeasing in the life sciences market is picking up steam and some demand remains, according to the Business Times. Alexandria executives believe\nrecovery is coming\n, but it isn\u2019t moving fast enough to absorb excess supply. Rather than bet on life sciences, buyers for surplus land are instead looking to acquire property at lower prices and plan for housing instead.\nAn increasing portion of Alexandria\u2019s land and aging properties are now being positioned for housing upon sale, Peter Moglia, Alexandria\u2019s CEO and CIO, said. Much of Alexandria\u2019s recent write-downs were linked to land, a direct result of oversupply in the Bay Area and other parts of the country, Marc Binda, Alexandria\u2019s CFO noted.\nSome Alexandria-owned land is being primed for housing without even selling. Last month, Strada Investment Group unveiled a\nproposal to demolish\nfour office buildings on Alexandria-owned land in Palo Alto to make way for 145 residential units.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Four years after topping out Brooklyn\u2019s office skyline, JEMB Realty pulled off a financial reset at 1 Willoughby Square, bringing in partners and refinancing a tangle of construction-era debt to keep control of the 35-story tower.\nThe 500,000-square-foot Downtown Brooklyn building was recapitalized through a complex transaction that included new equity, splitting the tower into condos and a $125 million mortgage from Deutsche Bank, according to\nBisnow\nand a recent Fitch Ratings report.\nAmong the latest round of investors is Edmond Safra, a member of the Safra banking family, alongside Adnane Mousannif\u2019s AVRS Partners and KSR Capital principals Abraham Kassin and Morris Sabbagh.\nThe Deutsche loan is tied to the lower portion of the building and includes a $75 million A-note sold into a CMBS conduit. JEMB executives Joseph, Morris, Jacob and Louis Jerome are listed as sponsors on the financing, along with the new partners.\nThe sponsors also kicked in $68.5 million in fresh equity, according to Fitch, used largely to retire $179.5 million of existing debt, cover closing costs and seed a nearly $10 million reserve.\nAs part of the deal, the tower was split into two condo units: floors one through 21 and floors 22 through 35. Only the lower unit carries the Deutsche debt, while the upper floors are debt-free for now. Fitch flagged the layered capital stack as a potential risk, noting remaining EB-5 mezzanine debt and $65 million in convertible loans tied to the joint venture.\nJEMB said the building is being repositioned with a spec suite program, including prebuilt offices as large as 10,000 square feet. The landlord recently signed CorePower Yoga to a 5,000-square-foot flagship retail lease on the ground floor and expanded Rubenstein Law into a 10,000-square-foot office on the 21st floor.\nThe recap comes against a tough backdrop for Brooklyn offices.\nDowntown Brooklyn\u2019s vacancy rate stood at 21.1 percent at the end of the third quarter, well above the citywide average, Fitch reported. The Willoughby Square tower is 53.5 percent occupied, though the portion tied to the CMBS loan is nearly full, anchored by the city\u2019s Albee Square Montessori Public School, which leases 86,000 square feet.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Mark Nussbaum, a disgraced Manhattan attorney and real estate fixer, said in new legal filings that he diverted $336 million from his law firm\u2019s escrow clients to real estate investor Mendel Steiner between 2022 and 2025.\nThe filings reveal the inner workings of Nussbaum and Steiner\u2019s alleged Ponzi scheme, where some creditors were offered \u201cfictitious investment opportunities regarding supposed proof of funds transactions or purchases of real property that did not really exist,\u201d said Nussbaum.\n\u201cPhony emails, escrow agreements, and deal documentation were used; non-existent third-parties in whose names the deals were supposedly being done were invented,\u201d the filings state.\nNussbaum said that most of his escrow clients, who are now creditors of Nussbaum\u2019s estate, were introduced to him by Steiner, who died by suicide at a hotel in Manhattan in January 2025 as the alleged scheme was about to spill into public view. Nussbaum Lowinger shut down days later and lawsuits started piling up from escrow clients demanding their money back.\nShelden Eisenberger, the lawyer handling the liquidation process \u2014 known as assignment for the benefit of creditors \u2014 of Nussbaum\u2019s former law firms, Nussbaum Lowinger and Mark J Nussbaum &amp; Associates, is zeroing in on the transfers to Steiner\u2019s family in an attempt to recoup the hundreds of millions owed to Nussbaum\u2019s creditors.\nThe new filings paint the clearest picture to date of the money flow between Nussbaum and Steiner and his family. Nussbaum said he directly transferred about $24 million to Steiner or to companies controlled by members of his family.\nIn addition to direct transfers, Nussbaum transferred escrow money to Steiner\u2019s companies Aven Realty and Real Green Management. Those companies then transferred at least $68 million to companies controlled by Steiner\u2019s father, brother and wife, according to Eisenberger.\nTo compensate Nussbaum for his role in the scheme, Aven Realty and Real Green sent $104 million, according to Eisenberger\u2019s affirmation.\nEisenberger said he does not yet have access to all of Aven Realty and Real Green\u2019s books and records. But his legal team has been able to document some transfers.\nThis includes $4.3 million to DS Lending, a company owned by Steiner\u2019s wife Dini Endzweig Steiner; $361,500 to Olivii, a clothing company owned by Dini; $6.4 million to 365 12th Avenue LLC, a company owned by Steiner\u2019s brother Naftali; and $6.7 million to 198 President Realty LLC, another company owned by Naftali Steiner.\nEisenberger is seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent Aven Realty or Real Green from transferring any assets.\nHe notes recovery efforts are on behalf of 52 creditors of Nussbaum\u2019s who lost a significant amount of money as a result of the alleged ponzi scheme.\n\u201cSome of those creditors are themselves threatened with insolvency as a result of those losses,\u201d said Eisenberger in his affirmation. \u201cThis is a very important case and this is an urgent matter.\u201d\nThe filings also explicitly lay out how Nussbaum and Steiner\u2019s Ponzi\nscheme\nworked. Nussbaum and Steiner pitched three types of investments to possible investors. One offered clients high monthly fees in exchange for deposits into Nussbaum Lowinger escrow accounts. The money was supposed to be held in escrow but was instead used by Steiner to\nshow\nlenders or sellers that he was capitalized. The second method was through fraudulent real estate purchases, where Steiner provided Nussbaum\u2019s clients a chance to finance his real estate acquisitions or deposit. The third was by offering clients a chance to deposit money for a short-time in exchange for \u201cexorbitant interest and fees.\u201d The money was supposed to be used for \u201cshow capital\u201d transactions. Instead, Nussbaum used the money to make\nbridge loans\nto real estate dealmakers.\n",

Houston\u2019s suburbs had 10 master-planned communities land in the 50 top-selling MPCs in total last year. Developers Land Tejas and Starwood Land\u2019s\nSunterra\nnotched the highest sales in the state with 1,024 last year. D.R. Horton\u2019s Tamarron inked 974 home sales.\nBuilders competed with a rising supply of resale homes, and many buyers remained sidelined by elevated mortgage rates,\naccording\nto the Houston Chronicle. Despite the broader trend,\ngains were posted\nin several developments across the Houston metro. Across the state as a whole, the only other state to come close to Texas\u2019 tally of top-performing master-planned communities was Florida, with 16.\nSunterra\u2019s 2,300 acres includes resort-style amenities that might serve as the extra incentive attracting new residents, such as a\ncrystal lagoon\nthat opened last year along a 2.7-acre white sand manmade beach, according to the outlet. Resident-only perks also include a pool and lazy river, splash pad and walking trails, all within zoning for Katy Independent School District and parts in Royal ISD.\nTodd LaRue, a Texas-based managing director at RCLCO, told the outlet that he expects Houston\u2019s master-planned communities to outperform the rest of the U.S. in 2026.\n\u201cIt is unlikely to be dethroned as the \u2018Top-Selling Metro Area\u2019 for master-planned communities in the near future,\u201d LaRue said.\nNot to be outdone,\nOxland Group\u2019s\nPainted Tree development in McKinney was the top Dallas-Fort Worth metro MPC to land on the list, with 643 home sales. The development, 30 miles north of Dallas and west of I-75, includes three districts surrounding wooded lakes and parks. In Denton County, D.R. Horton\u2019s Silverado development, at 2604 O\u2019Connell Circle in Aubrey, sold 446 homes, according to the data.\nRounding out the Texas Triangle, the San Antonio community of Riverstone \u2014 another D.R. Horton development \u2014 sold 529 homes. Riverstone is near the Far West Side Alamo Ranch and Loop 1604 Hwy 151 corridor. Platform Ventures and Capitol Realty\u2019s master-planned community of Santa Rita Ranch just north of Austin in Liberty Hill sold 483 homes, according to RCLCO.\n",

        "content": "A Long Island investor who leaned on pandemic-era stopgaps to keep Midtown hotels afloat has now lost both properties.\nParamdeep Singh, who owns gas stations and operated the hotels through Premier Hotels, was stripped of control\nat 59 West 46th Street\nand 129 West 46th Street after defaults, foreclosure actions and investor infighting, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nAt 59 West 46th Street, a nine-story, 234-room hotel just off Sixth Avenue, Singh was undone by a former partner-turned-lender. Boris Aronov, a cab driver who later became a Diamond District diamond dealer, acquired the building\u2019s distressed mortgage last summer and then moved to foreclose when Singh failed to repay the debt by the end of the year. Court filings show the obligation had swelled to $57 million.\nThe deed, recorded last week, pegs the property\u2019s value at roughly $53 million, below the $59.5 million Singh\u2019s group paid for the hotel in 2022 when it bought it from Apple Core. That acquisition was heavily leveraged with more than $32 million in debt.\nOnce a budget-brand flag, the hotel more recently functioned as supportive housing under a nonprofit lease that is expected to remain in place.\nAronov is also eyeing a different future for part of the building: the property spans through to 47th Street, where he plans to bring in diamond merchants, extending his jewelry-focused portfolio in the neighborhood.\nSingh tried to stop the takeover in court, accusing Aronov of bad-faith tactics and arguing that international trade policies \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 scuttled a last-minute refinancing. The effort failed.\nA few doors east, Singh\u2019s grip recently loosened at 129 West 46th Street, a 79-room prewar hotel he bought in 2019 for $24 million. When tourism collapsed, Singh pivoted the building into a city-contracted migrant shelter, generating steady cash flow but complicating long-term repositioning.\nA\nplanned revival\nwith hotel operator LuxUrban fizzled and the operator\u2019s bankruptcy cleared the way for foreclosure. A judge entered a $21.6 million judgment last fall and the property sold at auction this month to bridge lender W Financial for $23.8 million.\nInvestor lawsuits accusing Singh of mismanagement and opaque finances added pressure behind the scenes. Singh did not comment on the loss of the hotels.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The 0.3-acre site is owned by Monique Benson, who bought it for $480,000 in 2002, according to property records.\nK\u0131rk\u0131nc\u0131o\u011flu tapped Kobi Karp to design the project, dubbed Shelton Miami.\nThe building will have two five-bedroom, 3,000-square-foot units on floors three through 11.\nIts amenities will include a spa, fitness center, pool, hobby room and meeting room, according to Shelton\u2019s website. The developer is also offering residents shuttle services to the beach, boating and the airport, the project\u2019s website shows.\nThe developer has not yet announced pricing for the units. Shelton has not confirmed a timeline for launching sales or starting construction.\nIt marks the developer\u2019s first project in the U.S. Shelton\u2019s portfolio includes developments in Ankara and Bodrum in Turkey, and its three completed developments are all single-family residential communities.\nWhile the real estate boom has spread across the broader Miami metropolitan region and drawn billions of dollars in investment, North Miami hasn\u2019t had the same pull on condo developers as other enclaves. But the tide is turning.\nIn November, the Eichner family\u2019s Continuum Company completed its buyout of a waterfront condo building in the city for\n$48.5 million\n. The firm previously\nsecured approval\nfor a 22-story, 267-unit project on the site, but the Eichners have yet to release details for their site plans.\nAcross the water, Bay Harbor Islands has a packed pipeline of condos in the works.\nOne Sotheby\u2019s International Realty took over sales and marketing of 9900 West,\nHorizon Group\u2019s planned 23-unit condominium\nin Bay Harbor Islands, in December.

County city, the Los Angeles Daily News reported. The property is valued at $7.4 million, per auction documents.\nManning Beef closed last October after filing for bankruptcy in 2024. Manning Land Company, which owns the land where Manning Beef operated,\nfiled for bankruptcy\nin California Central Bankruptcy Court on Tuesday. It isn\u2019t clear if the delay for the auction was tied to Manning Land\u2019s bankruptcy, though the filing could mean the sale of the land could take several more months, Ben Williamson, executive director of national animal advocacy nonprofit Animal Outlook, said.\nPico Rivera city officials are hopeful that the Manning site will have a future outside the meat industry.

        "content": "A Bucktown strip mall could soon give way to a mid-rise apartment building, as a longtime local owner moves to redevelop a prominent stretch of Milwaukee Avenue.\nBroker-developer\nBill Senne\nintroduced a zoning change request to Chicago City Council for a seven-story, 60-unit apartment building at 1704 North Milwaukee Avenue, replacing a low-rise shopping center he has owned for decades, Block Club Chicago\nreported\n. The proposal calls for ground-floor retail, two levels of parking and apartments above.\nThe site currently houses a Garfield\u2019s Beverage Express liquor store and a CorePower Yoga studio, along with a surface parking lot across the street from the\nBucktown\n-Wicker Park library. Under the latest plans, the new building would include nearly 11,000 square feet of retail space along\nMilwaukee Avenue\n. Both tenants have expressed interest in returning after construction, according to Senne.\nPlans submitted to the city show 60 apartments spread across the upper floors, including a mix of one-, two- and three-bedroom units, plus two studios. Twelve apartments would be designated affordable to comply with city requirements. A two-level parking garage on the second and third floors would provide 67 spaces, with 12 reserved for residents and the remainder available as paid public parking.\nThe parking count is down sharply from earlier iterations. According to the publication, Senne, president of Chicago-based brokerage\nProperty Consultants Realty\n, and his team first presented the project to neighbors in early September, when plans called for roughly 100 spaces. Since then, the development has added two units and trimmed parking, though the building\u2019s exterior design has stayed the same.\n\u201cThe changes we made prior to filing are reflected on the floor plans, but the building\u2019s exterior elevations and massing stayed the same,\u201d zoning attorney Nicholas Ftikas said in an email to the outlet.\nThe zoning change was formally introduced to the City Council last week. It still needs approval from the Council\u2019s Committee on Zoning, Landmarks and Building Standards, followed by a vote of the full council. The timing is uncertain: The zoning committee hasn\u2019t met since December as aldermen jockey to become its permanent chair, as previously reported by\nThe Real Deal\n, and a February meeting has yet to be scheduled.\nCommunity reaction has been mostly supportive, according to the outlet, based on meetings hosted by the Wicker Park Committee and Bucktown Community Organization last fall. Some residents raised concerns about the building\u2019s height and potential traffic impacts on Wabansia Avenue and nearby streets.\nSenne has argued the parking garage would help replace spaces lost when protected bike lanes were added to Milwaukee Avenue. According to Block Club, Senne told neighbors in September that he was framing the garage as both a business necessity and a neighborhood amenity.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Alan Stalcup says collapsing multifamily fundamentals \u2014 not alleged fraud \u2014 are to blame for a string of failed investments by the syndicator that have landed his firm in court.\nStalcup, CEO of Austin-based apartment investor and operator GVA Property Management, pushed back in an\ninterview\nwith the Austin Business Journal on claims made by Austin-based investor Bryan Kastleman, who has accused GVA and its leadership of falsifying financials and\nsiphoning money\nfor personal use. Kastleman said he invested $11.3 million across several GVA deals and alleges the firm\n\u201ccooked the books\u201d\nto obtain and refinance loans, according to a lawsuit filed last year. GVA and Stalcup have denied the allegations and countersued Kastleman for defamation and business disparagement, among other claims.\nStalcup is also named in a lawsuit from New York-based private lender Benefit Street Partners in February 2025, and in January the Securities and Exchange Commission announced an investigation alleging he misappropriated as much as\n$100 million from investors\n.\nWith the suits and countersuits gearing up in court, Stalcup is publicly laying out a different explanation for GVA\u2019s unraveling: a brutal mix of rising interest rates, inflation and a wave of new apartment supply that crushed values across the Sun Belt, according to the publication.\nFrom the early 2010s through the pandemic, GVA\u2019s strategy of buying older apartment complexes, renovating them and boosting rents worked, Stalcup told the outlet. That changed around 2022, when the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates aggressively while simultaneously valuations in some markets fell by as much as 40 percent.\n\u201cNot only do the valuations go down, but debt service went up, and we\u2019re fighting costs of inflation, labor, property tax and insurance,\u201d Stalcup said. \u201cThen supply really kicked in in 2023 and 2024.\u201d\nThe oversupply problem in markets such as Austin is well documented. Patton Jones, vice chairman of Newmark\u2019s Central Texas office, told the outlet that the region entered 2024 with roughly 50,000 units in the development pipeline after years of pandemic-fueled in-migration to Sun Belt cities. That surge drove rents down just as borrowing costs spiked, a one-two punch for leveraged apartment owners.\nThose conditions, Stalcup said, hit GVA especially hard because of timing. The firm bought roughly $4 billion worth of real estate, with about 80 percent of the portfolio acquired post-pandemic, characterizing his firm\u2019s purchases of older apartments as all underwater.\nGVA defaulted on multiple loans in San Antonio, including at\nSolara\n, Bella Madera and Melia Apartment Homes, and sold other properties below assessed values. The firm also shrank the total number of is managed apartments from a peak of about 30,000 units to roughly 5,000 today.\nSince 2023, GVA has pursued sales, equity recaps and negotiations with lenders, though Stalcup said many lenders were unwilling to modify loans, paving the way for foreclosures. Still, he said the firm continues to operate with about 150 employees and a stabilized core portfolio.\nThe truth of Kastleman\u2019s allegations \u2014 and GVA\u2019s counterclaims \u2014 will ultimately be decided in court. For now, Stalcup said his firm is waiting out debt maturities, hoping values rebound before a major tranche of loans comes due around 2028.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

But the day before the auction, the\nTuttle entities\nfiled chapter 11 petitions in Miami bankruptcy court.\nSince then, the amount owed to Fort Lauderdale-based Fuse, led by Eyal Peretz, has ballooned to $60.1 million including accrued interest and fees, bankruptcy filings show.\nTuttle has not started construction on the project, known as The Mainstreet at Tuttle. The development was planned with 401 apartments, a 125-key hotel, 400,000 square feet of retail, 82,900 square feet of offices and 3,435 parking spaces. The property is among\n13 South Florida development sites\nthat have fallen into distress since 2024.\nRepresentatives for the Tuttle entities, Fuse Group, Concord and Ardent did not respond to requests for comment.\nFuse initially sought to dismiss the bankruptcy petitions by alleging in a motion that Tuttle filed for chapter 11 to stall the auction. In November, Fuse, Tuttle and Ardent representatives attended a settlement conference in which they hashed out the terms of the reorganization plan.\nIf the sale to Concord goes through, $1.8 million would pay unsecured creditors, $471,000 would pay delinquent property taxes, and an undetermined amount would pay attorney fees for the Tuttle entities, the Jan. 23 motion states. The balance would pay off Fuse.\nIf the deal falls through, Ardent would pay Fuse $50 million after acquiring the unified Tuttle entity. Tuttle would also remain as a personal guarantor to the\nFuse\nloans. The largest unsecured creditors include another lender that is owed $7.8 million and BC Architects, which is owed $1.5 million in fees, bankruptcy court filings show.\nU.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Erik Kimball is set to rule on the reorganization plan on Friday.",

        "content": "A pair of adjacent properties in the Golden Triangle of Beverly Hills has traded hands for about $25 million, a deal that sets a recent high-water mark of roughly $1,500 per square foot, according to property records dated early January.\nThe deal involves legacy wealth and newer found fortune in Los Angeles. The seller is connected to Anderson Real Estate, a private, family-owned real estate company. Anderson Real Estate is linked to Topa Equities \u2014 founded by late billionaire and Los Angeles businessman John Anderson, who has a University of California, Los Angeles, school named after him. The buyer is connected to David Mirharooni, a real estate investor via his Brickstar Capital, business records reveal.\nMirharooni, who is chair of the Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce, declined to comment. Anderson Real Estate did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Golden Triangle trade encompasses two adjacent parcels that combine for about 16,400 feet at 202 North Canon Drive, a one-story home to Rodeo Realty, and 208 North Canon Drive, which can be used for office or retail. Newmark\u2019s Jay Luchs and Gavin Ketchum brokered the off-market transaction; Luchs confirmed the trade.\nA person familiar with the matter said the buy isn\u2019t necessarily an office play, and the new owner might want to eventually tap its retail use.\nBeverly Hills prices fall into a different category for retail located directly on the famed high-end shopping strip of Rodeo Drive, where a property leased to Tom Ford, Moncler and Balenciaga\nsold\nfor $400 million-plus, which amounted to more than $14,000 per square foot.\nThe deal on Canon is nevertheless pricey given its location and the current office market conditions in areas beyond Rodeo. It commanded more on a square-footage basis than publicly traded real estate investment trust Kilroy Realty\u2019s $200 million-plus Beverly Hills office campus\nbuy\nfrom Tishman Speyer last year, which came to around $700 per square foot. Mirharooni\u2019s deal is also pricier per square foot than Alo Yoga\u2019s $90 million\npurchase\nof a Beverly Hills headquarters that came out to almost $1,100 a square foot late last year.\nBrickstar Capital\u2019s Mirharooni and Daniel Mirharooni recently made another Beverly Hills buy: a retail property on South Robertson Boulevard for almost $8 million, or $985 per square foot, Traded L.A.\nreported\n. The Mirharoonis own Mastro\u2019s on Canon Drive.\nAnderson Real Estate, chaired by Patrick Haden, owns properties throughout the city, including two office towers on Century City\u2019s Avenue of the Stars and another in Beverly Hills\u2019 Golden Triangle on Wilshire Boulevard.\n",

        "content": "Indiana senators took a step toward luring the Chicago Bears across state lines, approving legislation that would set up the legal and financial scaffolding for a new NFL stadium in northwest Indiana.\nIn a 46-2 vote on Tuesday, the Indiana Senate passed Senate Bill 27, which would create the Northwest Indiana Stadium Authority \u2014 a quasi-public entity empowered to issue bonds, acquire land, finance construction and lease a stadium to a private team, the Indianapolis Business Journal\nreported\n. The bill, authored by Republican Sens. Ryan Mishler and Chris Garten, now heads to the House.\nMishler stressed that the legislation stops short of sealing a deal, but rather creates a framework around how ongoing negotiations with the Bears will work, according to the publication.\nIn a December interview with the Chicago Tribune, Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren confirmed the team is looking across state lines. Officials in the southeast Chicago suburbs on the Indiana side of the metro of Hammond and Gary have floated concepts so far.\nThe vote does signal Indiana\u2019s intent as it\npositions itself\nagainst Illinois, where the Bears have\ngrown frustrated by stalled talks\nwith Gov. JB Pritzker and state lawmakers over a long-discussed stadium project tied to the team\u2019s suburban Arlington Heights\nracetrack site\n. The Bears have played at Soldier Field in Chicago since 1971, but have openly floated alternatives.\nThe team welcomed the Senate action in a statement, calling it a positive step forward for Bears fans across\nChicagoland\n.\nUnder SB 27, the stadium authority would effectively stand in for the state as the owner of a new facility. Its three-member board would be composed of top state budget and finance officials, according to the outlet. The authority could issue 40-year bonds to fund land acquisition and construction, with repayment tied to rent, insurance proceeds and other pledged revenues. Any deal would require the Bears to commit to a 35-year lease.\nWhile the authority would own the stadium, the team would cover operating and repair costs and keep stadium-generated revenue. The Bears could buy the venue outright by assuming remaining debt \u2014 or for $1 once the bonds are fully paid.\nSome issues were left intentionally unresolved, including local tax arrangements and adding municipal representation to the authority, the outlet reported. A proposed requirement for minority business participation goals was stripped out during committee review.\nThe House is expected to take up the bill next. Speaker Todd Huston voiced support, but wants a firm commitment from the Bears before anything is finalized.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Donald Bren\u2019s firm, Irvine Company, might be preparing to test how much market appetite remains for top-tier office buildings in downtown Chicago.\nThe Newport Beach, California-based firm is moving toward a potential sale of the 50-story tower at\n1 North Wacker Drive\n, according to sources familiar with the matter and first\nreported\nin Crain\u2019s. Irvine recently interviewed brokerage teams and tapped Eastdil Secured to conduct a strategic review of the 1.4 million-square-foot skyscraper. Should Irvine formally list the tower, it would be the company\u2019s first Chicago office sale since it entered the market in 2010.\nEastdil Managing Director Bryan Rosenberg confirmed to the publication that the firm was retained, but said the property has not been listed.\nAny sale would be closely watched, as\ndowntown office values\nhave been battered by recent market conditions. But the tower at 1 North Wacker possesses a lot to work with,\u00a0 such as a prime riverfront address, strong cash flow and a roster of blue-chip tenants, according to the outlet.\nThe tower generated $47.2 million in net operating income in 2023, according to Bloomberg data tied to its $353 million commercial mortgage-based securities mortgage, which Irvine put in place during a 2021 refinancing. The building was appraised at $664 million at the time.\nThe tower would likely trade far above recent Chicago office deals, many of which involved distressed or sparsely leased properties. Just a couple blocks south, towers at 125 and 200 South Wacker Drive sold last year for under $100 per square foot.\nIrvine, led by the 93-year-old billionaire\nBren\n, has long cultivated a reputation as a patient, long-term holder. In Chicago, the firm also owns the building at 71 South Wacker Drive and last year paid off a $431 million loan on its tower at 300 North LaSalle Street, signaling staying power. But the company has shown it will sell when the timing suits it, having unloaded its\nentire downtown San Diego office portfolio\nover the past two years.\nWhile downtown Chicago office vacancy sits at about 28 percent, 1 North Wacker is roughly 92 percent leased, according to CoStar. Trophy buildings citywide are faring much better than the broader market, with vacancy closer to 11 percent, Colliers data shows.\nThe tower has also proven resilient post-pandemic. PricewaterhouseCoopers signed a 10-year lease extension last year for more than 282,000 square feet, pushing its term to 2038, while Barnes &amp; Thornburg expanded and extended its lease through 2036. Irvine also recently poured $10 million into upgrading the building\u2019s amenity floor.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The locally based nutrition company occupies 118,767 square feet at the EmeryTech campus.\nEmeryTech is currently 66.9 percent occupied, according to the Business Times. The complex has undergone more than $37.9 million in capital improvements, including upgrades to HVAC tech and solar panel installation. On-site amenities include fitness center, rock-climbing gym, showers, outdoor patios and cafeteria.\nAn eventual offloading of the property is expected to be a short sale, meaning it would sell for less than the balance of the debt linked to the property, a source familiar with the site told the Business Times. Such a transaction would resemble other office property sales in Emeryville.\nIn September, LBA Realty bought a 16-story, 350,000-square-foot office building at\n2100 Powell Street\nfor $72.5 million, or $200 per square foot, representing a 57.6 percent drop from the $170.9 million that CBRE Investment Management paid for it in 2018. The $72.5 million transaction price was also a short sale, according to the Business Times. If the EmeryTech property were to be sold at $200 per square foot, the purchase price would total approximately $47 million, per the Business Times.\nAnother Emeryville property once owned by Blackstone also traded hands last year.\nSutter Health bought\na 12-acre life sciences campus in the East Bay city from Blackstone\u2019s\nBioMed Realty\nfor $450 million, or $615 per square foot, with plans to turn the site into a 1.3-million-square hospital and medical center.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Boone Pickens\n, traded last month, closing a choppy chapter in the property\u2019s history.\nMesa Vista Ranch LLC, owned by a group of investors that includes Midland oilman Bailey Peyton and Georgia-based investor J. Bradford Smith, sold the MV2 Ranch in Roberts County to Botas Rotas LLC, owned by Southlake businessman Tim Cummings, according to public records.\nSpanning 12,061 contiguous acres, the property includes several improvements designed to support game, especially quail. A seven-mile water line operates constantly with sprinkler heads set every thousand feet, and the land\u2019s position above the Ogallala Aquifer offers the potential for up to 50 new water wells, according to the listing.\nRepublic Ranches agent Bryan Pickens \u2014 no relation to the late corporate raider and wildcatter \u2014 had the listing. The final sale price is undisclosed, but the property was listed for $16.5 million, almost $1,400 per acre. It was originally listed for $19.6 million last spring.\nThe original Mesa Vista Ranch grew from an initial 2,900-acre purchase Boone Pickens made in 1971. Over the next four decades, the ranch swelled to more than 64,000 acres and improved into a luxury hunting destination, served by an FAA-approved airport and anchored by a 25,000-square-foot mansion dubbed \u201cthe Lodge,\u201d according to published reports. When Pickens decided to list the property in 2017 for $250 million,\nit was the most expensive property on the market in the country\n.\nAfter several price cuts, the Mesa Vista Ranch\nsold\nin 2022 within 10 percent of its final asking price of $170 million, according to\nLand Report\n. Oil investor Bill Kent bought 36,000 acres that included the mansion. A rancher named Travis Chester bought the portion that would become the MV2 Ranch, which he sold to Mesa Vista Ranch LLC in 2023.\nThe company quickly landed in a\nlegal squabble over Pickens\u2019 prestige\n. Kent\u2019s company filed a lawsuit alleging that Peyton and Smith formed Mesa Vista Ranch LLC to flip the 12,000 acres. By using the Mesa Vista name in their marketing materials, the lawsuit claimed, Peyton and Smith misrepresented their largely unimproved acreage as part of the luxurious resort Pickens created. The suit was resolved in\nApril\nwhen Peyton and Smith agreed not to use the Mesa Vista name in their marketing.\nBryan Pickens\u2019 ambitious listing campaign included a video produced last spring in which executives from the outdoor lifestyle magazine \u201cField and Stream\u201d hunted and camped on the ranch with country singer Ben Roberts.",

        "content": "The City Council on Thursday overrode a bevy of mayoral vetoes, including measures that set new restrictions on what types of housing the city finances.\nThe Council reversed 17 of former Mayor Eric Adams\u2019\nvetoes\n, most of which he made on his last day in office. That\u2019s more than the number of vetoes voided by the Council over the last decade, according to Speaker Julie Menin.\nTwo of those\nmeasures\nset minimum percentages for homeownership and low-income units financed by the city, which housing groups argued would interfere with the new mayor\u2019s housing agenda. The Council overrode vetoes on several other real estate-related measures, including one that sets minimum wages for building security officers.\nThe Council, however, didn\u2019t override Adams\u2019 veto of the industry-derided Community Opportunity to Purchase Act, or COPA.\nNew unit requirements\nOne of the bills revived by the Council requires that over a five-year period, at least 4 percent of new housing units financed by the city must be homeownership units. That requirement goes into effect on July 1, 2026.\nAnother measure mandates that at least 50 percent of new units funded by the city be affordable for extremely low-income households (those earning no more than 30 percent of the area median income) and very low-income households (those earning no more than 50 percent AMI). At least 30 percent must be affordable to extremely low-income households. Those thresholds apply over a five-year period and kick in July 1, 2027.\nThe Adams administration estimated that those bills would cost $110 million each year to maintain the city\u2019s current level of housing production and preservation. Though the administration argued against the cost of these and other bills, the mayor didn\u2019t veto a measure that sets minimum construction wages on city-funded housing projects, which his administration estimated would cost more than $400 million annually.\nMayor Zohran Mamdani had voiced concerns about the bills that set minimum thresholds for city-financed housing and their potential effect on his goal to build 200,000 affordable housing units over the next decade.\nA representative for the mayor didn\u2019t immediately comment on the two measures being revived by the City Council on Thursday.\nSome bills remain vetoed\nSome of Adams\u2019 housing-related vetoes, however, weren\u2019t revived. The Council didn\u2019t override the mayor\u2019s veto of another housing regulation bill that would set a minimum percentage of city-financed units with two- and three-bedrooms.\nIt also became clear early this week that COPA\ndidn\u2019t garner enough votes\nto overrule Adams\u2019 veto. Still, progressive Council members, the speaker and the mayor appear determined to revive the measure.\nDuring Thursday\u2019s meeting, Menin acknowledged that bills vetoed by Adams that were not resuscitated by the Council still have a path forward \u201cwhere we can get a supermajority support and address legal issues.\u201d\nThe city\u2019s Law Department flagged constitutional issues around COPA, which would have given city-approved non-profits, as well as joint ventures between for- and not-for-profit firms, the first opportunity to bid on certain distressed multifamily buildings when their owners decide to sell.\nCouncil member Sandy Nurse, the bill\u2019s sponsor, has\nmade clear\nthat she plans to reintroduce the measure.\n\u201cThe bottom line is this: if we do not have stronger protections to keep working class New Yorkers here, they will continue to leave,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cI look forward to working with Speaker Menin on re-introducing the bill and passing it this year.\u201d\nAdditional overrides\nThe Council overrode Adams\u2019 veto of a bill that sets\nminimum wages\nfor office security guards, a change proposed after the fatal shootings at Rudin Management\u2019s 345 Park Avenue last year. The Real Estate Board of New York has raised concerns about the bill, arguing that it undermines labor negotiations and is barred by state law.\nThe body additionally revived a measure aimed at increasing transparency around the co-op application process. Under the measure,\nco-op boards\nmust notify prospective residents that they have received an application to live at a building within 15 days. The board then has 45 days to accept or reject the application.\nThe Council reversed the former mayor\u2019s vetoes of bills that would create a city-run land bank (as long as the state approves it) and allow the city to sell tax liens to the land bank, rather than a private trust.\n",

        "content": "It only took three months for a new record sale on the North Fork.\nA waterfront Southold property at 59600 Main Road closed for $12.4 million, the highest price achieved for a single-lot on Long Island\u2019s North Fork. A bayfront home in Cutchogue sold by the estate of the late gallerist Barbara Gladstone held the previous record after its\n$11.2 million\nsale in October.\nThe Gladstone property, which spans 1.2 acres and works out to over $9 million per acre, still dwarfs the recent Southold one in terms of price per acre.\nThe Southold property spans over 21 acres on the Peconic Bay and offers 470 feet of water frontage and a private beach. Two homes sit on either end of the property: a 3,500-square-foot waterfront residence on the south end and a 2,200-square-foot home on the north end near Main Road.\nA local family had owned the property for three generations when Christian Baiz, who owned the estate with his wife Rosamond Phelps Baiz, died last February. The family had used the property to run Old Field Vineyard, which closed at the end of November.\nCompass\u2019 Bridget Elkin, who had the listing with her husband Eric and also sold the Gladstone estate, said the parents lived in the house by the water while their daughter lived on the north side of the property.\nDespite the scale of the property, Elkin said, most of the interest came from parties with a \u201cresidential eye.\u201d About half of the land is covered in mature vines, and the zoning comes with an agricultural exception that allows for expanded farm operations, including the processing and sales of products like wine, crops and jams, according to the listing.\nElkin said the buyer has already re-hired the same staff that currently manages the vineyard, but its days as a commercial winery are likely over. \u201cIt will probably be more of a vibe of a vineyard,\u201d she said.\nPricing on the North Fork has followed the trajectory of the entire East End, where homes on either side of Peconic Bay have gotten vastly more expensive since 2020.\nThe median sale price $2.3 million for homes in the Hamptons set a new record in the fourth quarter of last year, while the quarterly median sales price on the North Fork broke $1 million for the first time ever last year, according to data from appraisal firm Miller Samuel.\nElkin said the recent sales, including another $8 million home she sold in Cutchogue earlier this year, are \u201cestablishing a new price tier on the North Fork that is possible.\u201d Each sale \u201ccreates data points for people coming into the area considering buying or selling a property of that magnitude,\u201d she added.\nShelter Island has not been immune to the runup in prices, either.

        "content": "As a raft of attorneys\nduke it out in a Manhattan courtroom\nover commercial sex trafficking charges levied against the Alexander brothers, a new lawsuit claims the brothers enacted their alleged scheme in South Florida and were aided and abetted by their family and employers.\nIn a complaint\nfiled in Florida\u2019s Southern District last week\n, Tiffany Rodriguez accused twins Oren and Alon Alexander of a sex trafficking scheme enabled by a Miami club, their parents Orly and Shlomy Alexander, the family\u2019s security firm, Oren\u2019s longtime brokerage Douglas Elliman and the firm\u2019s former chairman and CEO Howard Lorber. Rodriguez named all of these players as defendants.\nThe suit adds to at least 30 civil actions filed against the Alexander brothers (though some have been dismissed) on top of federal sex trafficking charges. Rodriguez alleges the twin brothers, who are on trial in New York with their older brother Tal, \u201cused a network of entities and other individuals who helped facilitate, fund, and enable their sex trafficking scheme.\u201d\nThe suit includes many similar claims to a suit filed by\na group of women in February 2025\n. The past action, filed against all three brothers, raised allegations of attacks that took place between 2009 and 2017 in New York and Florida, and also alleged negligence and encouragement by those closest to the brothers, including their parents and Lorber, who previously denied the allegations through a lawyer. (Rodriguez\u2019s suit does not name Tal as a defendant.)\nThe brothers have denied all allegations and pleaded not guilty to the federal charges.\nSpokespeople for Douglas Elliman, Marriott International, the owner of Edition Hotels, and Orly and Shlomy Alexander did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe assault\nRodriguez says she met the brothers in September 2016 after a promoter invited her and a friend to \u201chang out\u201d with Oren and Alon at Basement Miami, a club under the Edition Hotel.\nAfter drinking in the club\u2019s VIP section, she was in and out of consciousness and later woke up restrained to an office chair. She says in the complaint she was being raped by Oren and Alon \u201csimultaneously,\u201d with the brothers switching off filming on a cell phone.\nShe eventually fled the room and the apartment with her friend, whom she told about the attack, according to the complaint. Later the next day, her boyfriend received a video of the attack, she says in the lawsuit.\nShortly after telling a friend about the attack, she heard from a private investigator acting on Oren\u2019s behalf, \u201cwho conveyed a threatening and coercive message: \u2018the Alexander Brothers asserted that the sexual acts were consensual and that Plaintiff\u2019s credibility would be attacked,\u2019\u201d the lawsuit reads.\nRodriguez said in the complaint she was \u201cunaware of the breadth of Defendants\u2019 conduct\u201d until their\narrests by federal authorities in December 2024\n.\nJuda Engelmayer, a spokesperson for the brothers, denied on their behalf the existence of any video in a statement\nto the Miami Herald\n.\n\u201cAs with the other allegations in this civil filing, these assertions remain unproven,\u201d Engelmayer told the outlet. \u201cQuestions of consent and criminal conduct are determined by evidence, not by hindsight, personal relationships, or narrative claims made years later.\u201d\nThe family firm\nRodriguez named parents Orly and Shlomy as defendants in their capacity as executives at Kent Security, the family-founded private security firm that operates in South Florida and New York, where Alon worked as an executive for much of his adult career.\nShlomy co-founded the firm, where Orly worked as chief financial officer and her brother, Gil Neuman, worked as chief executive officer.\nOrly and Shlomy continued \u201cto employ Alon despite reports dating back to high school that he, along with his brothers, were sexually assaulting and raping women,\u201d the lawsuit says.\nRodriguez added in the complaint that Kent benefited from Alon and Oren\u2019s close relationship, which exposed the firm to the increased visibility, prestige and access to elite client networks that Oren enjoyed as a top luxury broker.\nThe accused enablers at Elliman\n\u201cLorber, and other senior [Elliman] leadership, had knowledge of Oren Alexander\u2019s propensity to sexually abuse women but continued to fund, facilitate, and promote the sex trafficking scheme,\u201d Rodriguez wrote in the complaint.\nLorber was chairman and CEO during Oren and his brother Tal\u2019s 10-year stint at Elliman, and also served as a mentor to the budding star brokers. Oren wrote in the New York Post in 2013 his own father, Shlomy, referred to Lorber as Oren\u2019s \u201csecond father.\u201d\n\u201cMultiple real estate professionals reported that they either had personally told executives at Douglas Elliman about assaults by the Alexander Brothers or had been told about said assaults by company executives,\u201d Rodriguez claimed in the complaint.\nThe claim echoes previous reports that Lorber was aware of specific incidents involving the brothers\u2019 behavior with women. The brothers\u2019 behavior was \u201can open secret\u201d in the industry, former Elliman broker Brian Meier told the New York Times in August 2014, and it was understood Lorber was aware of \u201cat least one incident.\u201d\nTwo claims that reportedly made it to Elliman executives were those of Tracy Tutor, a former top Elliman agent who has appeared on \u201cMillion Dollar Listing Los Angeles\u201d who told the Times she shared a drink with Oren after an event in 2014 before blacking out, and agent Jessica Cohen, who said she attended a 2010 birthday party with Tal, Alon and Oren Alexander hours before passing out and waking up in the hospital after someone found her alone in the street.\nCohen said she told Lorber in 2012, when the two were playing chess after work, that she thought she\u2019d been drugged by Tal and Oren. A spokesperson for Elliman confirmed that Lorber had heard of an incident but maintained that it was confidential and not an official human resources complaint.\n\u201cThe allegations in the complaint concerning Howard Lorber are conclusory and false,\u201d Marc Kasowitz, a lawyer for Lorber, said in a statement. \u201cMr. Lorber had absolutely no role in or knowledge of the Alexander brothers\u2019 alleged sex trafficking venture. Mr. Lorber intends to get the case against him dismissed.\u201d\nElliman\nhas previously denied\nany knowledge of allegations against the Alexanders and Lorber\u2019s possible knowledge of any allegations.",

Business First reported. The sale price was not disclosed.\nJules San Pedro is slated to occupy a 1.3-acre block at 155 West 6th Street in San Pedro\u2019s Waterfront Arts District. The residences will rise next to the $250 million\nWest Harbor development\n, a 42-acre mixed-use entertainment hub set to open this summer.\nThe Jules San Pedro property will consist of a combination of studio, one- and two-bedroom units with amenities including a pool deck, courtyard, sauna, spa, clubhouse, sky lounge, rooftop deck, barbecue areas, pet spa and coworking space with conference rooms. Another 1,276 square feet of ground-floor retail space is planned for the site.\nConstruction on Jules San Pedro is expected to begin this quarter, with the units planned to open to residents by the second quarter of 2028.\nDallas-based High Street Residential is no stranger to the area near the San Pedro Port Complex.\nThe Trammell Crow residential arm recently completed another multifamily development near West Harbor called\nVivo on Harbor\n. The 137-unit residential community is located one block north of the future Jules San Pedro site. The eight-story building at 511 South Harbor Boulevard has 16 units set aside as affordable housing as the developer received a density bonus incentive allowing it to reach 85 feet, or 24 feet higher than zoning allows. Nearly 1,500 square feet of shops and restaurants are also included.\nIn late 2024, Trammell Crow acquired an approved project to build 281 apartments at\n625 South Beacon Street\nin San Pedro. Vancouver, Washington-based Holland Partner Group, which sold the property, was greenlit to build studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments above 2,300 square feet of ground-floor shops and restaurants.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "NASA is officially inviting the private sector deeper into its orbit near Houston, opening the door for commercial development on nearly 184 acres of excess land adjacent to the Johnson Space Center.\nThe space agency issued an announcement for proposals seeking tenants for 183.7 acres within Exploration Park, a site just outside JSC that agency leaders have been positioning as a hub for space-related industry, according to filings posted to the federal contracting site SAM.gov and\nreported\nby the Houston Business Journal. Proposals are due April 30, with NASA hosting site visits on Feb. 18. JLL was named leasing broker for Exploration Park earlier this year.\nA map included with the AFP shows the land carved largely into 10-acre parcels, along with several smaller tracts and a 13-acre section labeled \u201cOption Arrow.\u201d The site is accessible via Saturn Lane and sits inside JSC\u2019s secured perimeter \u2014 a detail that could shape how developers and tenants approach the opportunity, according to the publication.\nNASA\nis offering long-term ground leases with a 20-year base term and two additional 20-year options. Rents range from roughly $8,100 per acre to $11,800 per acre per year, depending on the parcel, with annual rent escalations of 3 percent. According to the AFP, tenants would be responsible for utilities and would need to propose access points that comply with NASA\u2019s security requirements, since all available parcels currently require badge access.\nNASA said it expects office, factory and storage tenants and could allow assembly, university and even mercantile uses, depending on the proposal.\nResidential development\n, however, is explicitly off the table.\nJohnson Space Center leadership has been laying the groundwork for years. Director Vanessa Wyche said in a January interview with the outlet that\nNASA\nviews the effort as a way to accelerate partnerships with commercial space companies and related industries.\nMomentum is already building around JSC, as Texas A&amp;M University\nbroke ground\nin November on its $200 million TAMU Space Institute nearby, backed by state funding. The facility has lined up tenants including Astrolab, Intuitive Machines and Interlune, and is expected to be substantially completed this year.\nElsewhere in Exploration Park, Austin-based American Center for Manufacturing and Innovation has been tapped to develop a 22-building campus across 207 acres, while Houston-based KBR signed a letter of intent this year to build a 45,000-square-foot facility focused on advanced human-centric systems.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Investors in a Brookfield Opportunity Zone fund that invests in New York and Connecticut real estate have been absolutely crushed, but don\u2019t know why.\nThe fund, Brookfield Opportunity 71IV7, had an internal rate of return of negative 18.3 percent through the third quarter of last year. Since mid 2019 it had lost 71 percent of its value.\nOne investor in the fund told me the massive loss \u201cmakes no reasonable sense.\u201d\nIndeed, except for rent-stabilized housing, New York City real estate has bounced back since the pandemic. Even Class B and Class C office space written off for dead has recovered some value, thanks to return-to-office and office-to-resi conversions.\nBut the rise in interest rates alone wiped out billions of dollars in equity, and some individual properties have fared badly. And this Brookfield fund was apparently quite concentrated. It is said to have sunk $1 billion into just a few assets, notably a new apartment building in the Bronx and a mall in Connecticut.\nThe investor thought the Bronx property was a four-tower development at 2401 Third Avenue, but that doesn\u2019t really track because that project appears to be doing well enough. It was able to refinance its construction loan in 2024, as\nThe Real Deal\nreported\n:\n\u201cAres Management refinanced construction debt secured by 460 new apartments at 2401 Third Avenue in the Bronx, and 410 new units at 1 Bell Slip in Brooklyn, both owned by Brookfield Properties. Brookfield has invested heavily in master-planned developments in New York, building 1,350 multifamily units at its Bankside campus in Mott Haven, and 1,200 new units at Greenpoint Landing.\u201d\nThe report added, \u201cRents have held strong in New York. In Mott Haven, at 2401 Third Avenue, units list for $2,900 to $3,900 per month.\u201d The housing lottery for affordable units at the 921-unit development\u2019s four towers, dubbed Lincoln at Bankside (aka 101 Lincoln Avenue),\nlaunched\nin 2023.\nOnly five of the 145 units set aside for 130 percent AMI households are available, according to this\nlisting page\n. However, Brookfield is offering four months of free base rent on a two-year lease and shows\n95 available units\n.\nThat would put the vacancy rate at just above 10 percent, assuming the 921-unit project is complete. That\u2019s not bad for a market-rate project in Mott Haven. It certainly wouldn\u2019t explain the investment fund\u2019s 71 percent drop.\nHowever, there might be more vacant units than the 95 listed as available by Brookfield. And interest rates are much higher now than they were seven years ago, which has broadly devalued real estate. Operating expenses have probably risen more than market-rate rents in Mott Haven, and rents on the affordable units have risen below the rate of inflation.\nAlso, it\u2019s quite conceivable that the fund\u2019s Connecticut mall has tanked since 2019.\nCould all of that add up to a 71 percent loss? Brookfield isn\u2019t saying. Its press team has not responded to three messages sent over the past four weeks.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nEvery new year is\npredicted\n(or at least hoped) to be the year that C-PACE lending gets going in New York. But it never happens. Meanwhile,\ndevelopers\nin\nTexas\n,\nFlorida\n,\nSan Francisco\nand elsewhere are getting\nC-PACE loans\nlike candy from a busted pi\u00f1ata. Why can\u2019t New York lawmakers and bureaucrats make this possible in the alleged finance capital of the world? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Next year, Con Ed will break out the portion of customers\u2019 gas and electricity bills that goes toward property taxes.\nElsewhere\u2026\nWhile the Mamdani administration slams rent-stabilized landlords and praises resident-run housing, three developments in the latter category didn\u2019t exactly shine in an\naudit\nby the state comptroller.\nThe auditors at Thomas DiNapoli\u2019s office looked at the Mitchell-Lama projects Clinton Towers, Evergreen Gardens and Tivoli Towers and found problems with all of them.\nHazardous physical conditions cited included facade damage, broken self-closing and fire doors and units with mold, water damage and peeling paint. One commercial tenant \u2014 a day care center \u2014 had mouse droppings.\nOn the financial side, the affordable co-ops spent $114,000 on bonuses, holiday parties and gratuities over six years. Another $50,000 went to unknown expenditures.\nAll three developments spent $100,000 on vendors without notifying the Department of Housing Preservation and Development as required. \u201cEvergreen contracted with five vendors with payments over $100,000 without receiving HPD approval and no evidence of competitive bidding,\u201d the audit noted.\nClinton and Tivoli towers left some units vacant for four months or more, leaving $328,000 in rent uncollected.\nThese are not huge problems, but they shed light on the kind of oversight required for Mitchell-Lamas.\nThe main issue with this housing model seems to be that it is not sustainable without government support that other building types \u2014 rent-stabilized, for example \u2014 do not have. As Mitchell-Lama buildings wear down and require more capital investment, and tax breaks expire, their residents run to the government for money.\nLast month, the Hochul administration said it would give Bay Ridge Towers $49 million, or $60,400 per unit. Jimerson Apartments in Brownsville got $39 million, or\n$92,600 per unit\n.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$18.5 million\nfor Unit 16B at the Aman, 730 Fifth Avenue.

The Lenox Hill rentals total 20 units and over 20,000 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $19.5 million for 123 East 61st Street.

The seller was\nJohn Backus\n, and the buyer was a trust. The waterfront home, built in 2019, has five bedrooms and six and a half baths. Backus purchased the home in 2022 for $13 million. It went on the market in September 2024, with an asking price of $15.9 million.\nMichael LeDuc\nwith One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty had the listing, and\nJessica Nasib\nwith JMK Real Estate Agents brought the buyer.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nWest Palm Beach had the top commercial real estate transaction to hit records, thanks to the sale of a Delta Hotels by Marriott branded property at\n1301 Belvedere Road\nfor $23.8 million. The seller of the more than 130,000-square-foot property was\nSagar Dasai\u2019s Activate Hospitality,\nwhich had acquired the building and an adjacent empty development site in 2023.

The seller was an LLC managed by\nJoseph Loren Connor\n, and the buyer was\nZAD PB LLC\n. The two-bedroom pad spans about 2,100 square feet, pricing the deal at roughly $4,300 per square foot.

        "content": "Henry Bott is stepping down as president of Swire Properties in Miami after just three years.\nThe Hong Kong-based firm promoted Dave Martin to take over effective Mar. 16, according to a news release. Bott is moving back to his hometown of London with his family after a career with Swire that spans more than a decade and posts in China, Vietnam and Florida. He was named president in 2023 after\nSwire\u2019s Kieran Bowers\nstepped down to move back to the U.K. as well.\nMartin is also a longtime Swire executive. He joined the firm in 2018 as a vice president focused on the firm\u2019s retail portfolio in South Florida, namely Brickell City Centre, which reached 100 percent occupancy under his leadership. He was promoted to senior vice president in 2023, according to LinkedIn.\nMartin spearheaded Swire\u2019s sale of its majority stake in Brickell City Centre to Simon Property Group for\n$512 million\n, a deal that closed in June. As Swire moved to divest from its Brickell retail holdings, it also sold a dev site to Dubai-based hospitality firm Kerzner International for\n$45 million\nin August.\nNow the firm is focused squarely on its planned Residences at Mandarin Oriental, Miami, the condo-hotel project in Brickell Key.\nThe development includes 298 condos, 121 hotel keys and 28 hotel residences, the release shows. The design team includes Kohn Pedersen Fox, Tristan Auer, Laura Gonzalez and Shma. Fortune Development Sales is leading marketing for the project, which launched in 2023. Prices started at $3.5 million at the time.\nPre-sales total more than $1.2 billion, and construction is slated for later this year, according to the release.\nSwire Properties is a division of global conglomerate John Swire &amp; Sons, the British firm founded in 1816 by John Swire. Swire Properties\u2019 real estate investments are primarily in Asian markets in China, Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and Japan. Miami is its only American market.\nScions of the billionaire Swire family, including Barnaby Swire and Merlin Swire, remain involved in the business as directors of John Swire &amp; Sons.",

        "content": "Retail vacancy in the Loop fell for the second straight year in 2025, offering a modest but meaningful signal that the central business district is clawing its way back from the pandemic-era wipeout.\nThe Loop\u2019s retail vacancy rate dropped to 28.5 percent in 2025, down from 29.8 percent the year before, according to a report from Chicago-based brokerage Stone Real Estate. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat after years of shuttered storefronts and\nstalled leasing\n, the market appears to have hit bottom. Stone principal John Vance told the outlet that renewed activity in key corridors and a slow return of foot traffic contributed to that observation.\nState Street, long the poster child for downtown retail distress, has been a bright spot. A new Gap Factory store at 17 North State Street and a high-profile lease by Barnes &amp; Noble at 150 North State Street helped chip away at vacancies on the corridor, even as some big names continued to leave. The deals suggest retailers with an existing foothold downtown are seeing enough sales to double down, Vance said.\nGap\u2019s return comes eight years after the company closed its flagship State Street store. Vance said the move likely reflects steady performance at the Banana Republic Factory inside Block 37. Barnes &amp; Noble\u2019s lease \u2014 one of the largest State Street has landed in years \u2014 also turned heads.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what momentum does, whether it be bad or good,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAnd right now we\u2019ve got some good momentum.\u201d\nThe picture isn\u2019t\nuniformly rosy\n. State Street lost Saks Off Fifth and Anthropologie in 2024, and the vacancy rate remains elevated. More broadly, the Central Loop submarket saw its vacancy rate fall to 24.7 percent from 26 percent a year earlier, according to the report.\nElsewhere downtown,\nleasing followed\nthe office workers. In the LaSalle/Wacker corridor, improving office occupancy helped draw food-and-beverage tenants to the bases of well-capitalized towers. New arrivals included a butcher shop at 222 North LaSalle Street and fast-casual chains Cava and Mendocino Farms in Willis Tower, according to the publication. That submarket\u2019s vacancy rate dropped to 26.8 percent from 28.6 percent.\nAlong\nMichigan Avenue\nsouth of the river, tourist-oriented concepts drove most of the activity, including Portillo\u2019s and a Hello Kitty-themed caf\u00e9 at 360 North Michigan. Even so, the corridor\u2019s vacancy ticked up to 27.8 percent after a CVS closed at 300 South Michigan.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Another artificial intelligence company is growing in San Francisco.\nAI-powered customer service startup Decagon is\nin talks to lease\ntwo floors of offices spanning approximately 70,000 square feet at 680 Folsom Street, the San Francisco Business Times reported. The firm\u2019s search has been ongoing for months and no deal has closed with landlord\nBXP\n, according to the Business Times.\nThe news comes after an announcement Wednesday that the three-year-old company raised $250 million in a Series D funding round that placed the firm\u2019s value at $4.5 billion. Decagon\u2019s valuation has tripled in the past six months, with a $131 million Series C round last June valuing the company at $1.5 billion. The company said the following month that it planned to use the Series C capital for product development and to increase its employee headcount.\nDecagon is currently based at 100 First Street, across the street from\nSalesforce Tower\nin the city\u2019s Financial District. The size of its offices there are not clear.\nBXP is in negotiations with tenants to lease out 132,000 square feet of offices at 680 Folsom and the adjacent 50 Hawthorne Street. As of Wednesday, BXP has completed two deals for approximately 69,000 square feet at the two buildings, according to the Business Times. The two structures together total 522,406 square feet and were 65.8 percent occupied as of the fourth quarter, up from 59.2 percent the previous quarter, according to the Business Times.\nAI firms have been credited with\ndriving down vacancy and increasing demand\nfor office space in the San Francisco market. The amount of office space that was vacant or available for lease\ndecreased\nby nearly 2 million square feet in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter, marking the steepest drop in office availability in four consecutive quarters of decline, according to CoStar Group.\nCompanies in San Francisco leased\n1 million more square feet than they vacated in the fourth quarter, making for the largest such instance of positive absorption since 2018, per CBRE data cited by the Business Times.\nAI startup\nSierra inked the largest lease deal\nof last year in San Francisco, taking up 300,000 square feet at 185 Berry Street in China Basin. AI-focused companies account for about 2.8 million square feet of the approximately 8 million square feet of offices that firms are currently searching for in San Francisco, according to the Business Times. About 24 percent of office space in San Francisco is empty or available for lease, per CoStar.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The owner of a nearly half-century-old office building in downtown Fort Worth is framing the pending departure of a longtime anchor tenant as an opening, not a setback.\nRange Resources Corporation plans to vacate Two City Place at 100 Throckmorton Street when its lease expires in 2027, relocating to the 40-story 777 Main tower less than a mile away. The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat the Fort Worth-based energy company has occupied the building since 2007 and leases about 112,000 square feet \u2014 roughly 35 percent of the 320,000-square-foot tower \u2014 according to\nCitadel Partners\n, which handles leasing at the property.\nJon Ruff, president and COO of Dallas-based owner Spire Realty Group, confirmed the move and said Range\u2019s decision wasn\u2019t driven by issues at the building. Instead, Ruff said, Spire is already positioning Two City Place to capitalize on what will become one of the largest contiguous blocks of available office space in\ndowntown Fort Worth\n.\n\u201cWe expect that the space is going to lease,\u201d Ruff said. \u201cAnd we expect that it\u2019s going to lease at a rate that is probably better than we would have gotten if we would have renewed Range Resources.\u201d\nRange will take four floors at the 777 Main new trophy tower, which is rising in the central business district. A company spokesman said the new space will be similar in size to its current space, but declined to elaborate on the rationale for the move.\nTwo City Place \u2014 formerly part of the\nTandy Towers complex\n\u2014 is one of two 19-story buildings tied to an annex with retail and a parking garage. The broader City Place complex totals about 1.2 million square feet and once served as RadioShack\u2019s headquarters. Two City Place was last renovated in 2008, while its sister tower was updated in 2014, according to the outlet.\nSpire plans to use the transition to freshen the building, including a \u201cmajor overhaul\u201d of common areas with a focus on the lobby, Ruff said. New ground-floor retail is also on the way, including a coffee shop and Italian restaurant Buonissimo.\nDowntown\nFort Worth\u2019s\ncombined Class A and B vacancy rate sits at about 11 percent, and large blocks of space are scarce, according to Citadel. Two City Place is currently just under 90 percent leased and will be able to offer roughly 120,000 contiguous square feet once Range leaves.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Los Angeles renters looking for a deal might be in luck.\nThe median monthly rent in the Los Angeles metro area\nfell\nto $2,167 in December, marking the lowest price in four years, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing\ndata\nfrom Apartment List. The median rent in Los Angeles County also fell to a four-year low of $2,035 per month.\nRents in L.A. haven\u2019t been that low since January 2022 when apartments were emptier and prices were diminished after former renters went on a pandemic-era homebuying spree.\nThe decrease in rents is in line with national trends, as the U.S. median rent also dropped a four-year low in December. In Southern California, L.A. stands as an outlier. Over the past four years, rents in Orange, Ventura and\nSan Bernardino Counties either rose\nor remained flat.\nWhether the drop is a sign of a further decline or a simple blip remains to be seen. Some experts believe it\u2019s a harbinger of things to come, while others see it as a brief price plateau before rents rise again this year, according to the Times. The winter rental market is usually slower than the summer, and the December 2025 low is only 4.2 percent below the all-time high of $2,262 in August 2022.\nLos Angeles has largely fallen behind other cities like\nSan Diego\nwhen it comes to housing construction, but last year marked a significant uptick in new apartments hitting the market, according to the Times. In total, 15,095 multifamily units were completed in Los Angeles, marking an 18 percent increase year-over-year and the second-highest amount in the past decade, per CoStar data cited by Kidder Mathews in its fourth-quarter multifamily\nreport\n.\nStill, as multifamily housing supply increased, demand fell as L.A. County\u2019s population contracted by 28,000 last year. In turn,\nvacancy\nrates rose to 5.3 percent in December, the highest point since April 2021, according to Apartment List.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Let Baylor University students rejoice \u2014 a\nchurch\ncomplex near the college is set to make room for a\nstudent housing development\n.\nAustin-based owner-operator Parallel plans to spend $59 million to build a seven-story student housing development on the northeastern portion of Seventh and James Baptist Church in Waco, according to a Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation\nfiling\n. The development will have 264 units accommodating 630 beds in a metal frame construction, the filing and Parallel\u2019s\nplans\nshow. TDLR filings are preliminary and subject to change.\nThe 127-year-old congregation owns about 4.5 acres next to Baylor University, and the 2.4-acre parcel allotted to the upcoming project is now under contract, according to Cromwell Commercial Group associate Caleb Loudamy, who has the listing for the property.\nThe new building will replace the sanctuary of the church, which was built in 1955, a student newspaper\nreported\n.\nAttorney and theologian Kent McKeever, a Baylor affiliate and member of the church, has an organizational role in the project, according to the filing. McKeever, founding partner of nonprofit legal aid organization, Waco Legal Services, attracted national attention some years ago for\nwearing a prison jumpsuit for Lent\n.\nNeither McKeever nor an associate with Parallel immediately responded to requests for comment.\nIn a trend dubbed \u201cYes in God\u2019s Backyard,\u201d developers around the country are scouting land owned by religious organizations, which are among the biggest landowners in America. In\nHouston\n, a senior housing project is planned for land owned by a Methodist church in the Third Ward neighborhood. In\nAustin\n, a church is developing a mixed-use project around its next branch. And in\nDallas\n, Generation Housing Partners is planning to replace a defunct church building with an affordable apartment complex.Waco isn\u2019t the only college town in Texas where developers are putting millions into student housing. In College Station, where\nlocal ordinances constricted student rental housing supply until last year\n, Subtext plans to spend\n$160 million\non a 21-story tower a block and a half from Texas A&amp;M University.\n",

        "content": "Cirrus Real Estate Partners won the do-over bankruptcy auction for a distressed downtown Miami development site, only this time it will pony up $18 million more than its previous winning bid.\nNew York-based Cirrus, the lender on the nearly 1-acre property at 340 Biscayne Boulevard, made the opening $77 million credit bid Wednesday and competed with an unknown bidder in $5 million increments, with Cirrus ultimately winning at $95 million, Bisnow\nreported\n.\nConcierge Auctions held the second auction after Brazilian developer Gilberto Bomeny\u2019s\nlegal complaint\ngot Cirrus\u2019 initial win tossed. Gabriel Flores of One Commercial, a subsidiary of One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, listed the site.\nThe sale isn\u2019t final until approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Laurel Isicoff in Miami, who is expected to take up the deal in a Feb. 11 hearing.\nThe outcome marks another chapter in the saga between Cirrus and the property owner, Bomeny, over the 10-story, 200-key Holiday Inn, which has approvals for an 82-story redevelopment.\nCirrus filed a Uniform Commercial Code foreclosure in 2024 against Bomeny\u2019s entity, alleging it defaulted on a\n$70 million\nloan.\nBomeny paid $65 million in 2015 for the site and 1950-built hotel. The property was already approved for an Arquitectonica-designed tower with\n374 condos\n, 120 hotel rooms, offices and retail, along with 500 parking spaces.\nAfter the UCC foreclosure filing, Bomeny\u2019s affiliate filed for Chapter 11 reorganization, leading to the first bankruptcy auction last month. Bidding had opened at $72 million. Cirrus, led by Joseph McDonnell, won with a\n$77 million\ncredit bid.\nBut Bomeny\u2019s ownership entity convinced the judge to order a do-over auction, alleging \u201cconstant changes and irregularities\u201d in the auction process that barred bidders who would have ponied up more money for the site.\nCirrus disputed that in court filings, accusing Bomeny of being \u201cunwilling to accept the auction\u2019s outcome\u201d and arguing that other potential bidders hadn\u2019t registered for the auction and submitted a required $250,000 deposit.\nThe judge\nordered\nthe do-over auction this month.\nCirrus representatives and attorneys for Bomeny\u2019s entities didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. Bomeny was a development partner in the Zaha Hadid-designed One Thousand Museum condo tower in downtown Miami and the Regalia Residences condo in Sunny Isles Beach.\nThe UCC foreclosure and subsequent bankruptcy auctions came as landlords are struggling with elevated interest rates that shot up following increases in 2022 and 2023. This increased loan obligations for property owners with floating-rate debt and\nno interest rate caps\n, and made refinancing maturing loans more expensive.\nAlthough the Federal Reserve made several cuts to the benchmark rate in 2024 and last year, it kept rates steady this month.\nSouth Florida owners also felt an additional sting from skyrocketing insurance premiums in recent years and increases in other expenses due to higher labor and materials costs.\nSome multifamily development site owners who had planned to seize on South Florida\u2019s rental boom of recent years instead\nput their properties on the for-sale market\n, either looking for project equity partners or scrapping projects altogether.\nOther landlords lost their properties in foreclosure.\nAlso in downtown Miami, Raoul Thomas\u2019 CGI Merchant lost its 129-key Gabriel Downtown Miami hotel in a UCC foreclosure to lender Madison Realty Capital in 2024 over a\n$60.4 million loan\n. The hotel is on the first 14 floors at the luxury Marquis condo tower at 1100 Biscayne Boulevard.\n",

        "content": "Two 432 Park Avenue condos\nat the center of an ownership\ndispute between Harry Macklowe and CIM Group have gone into contract.\nA buyer in the building has agreed to pay $53 million for units 78A and 78B, which combine to span the entire 78th floor, two sources familiar with the deal told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe seller is an entity tied to the building\u2019s sponsor, CIM Group, and not, as some had previously been led to believe, Harry Macklowe, who lost the units last year after he defaulted on the loans he had taken out from CIM to purchase the units in 2021.\nIf the deal closes at that price, it would be nearly exactly how much CIM claimed Macklowe owed in October 2023, when it had originally scheduled a foreclosure sale for the units, according to court filings.\nMacklowe paid roughly $47 million for the two 78th-floor units and a smaller 28th-floor unit, according to public records. The deal does not include the accessory unit, a source told\nTRD\n.\nThe kerfuffle over who owned the units began after a Douglas Elliman agent approached the Wall Street Journal with an exclusive story last year about Macklowe\u2019s plan to list the 78th-floor units for $75 million.\nThose plans were shot once it was revealed that Macklowe\nno longer controlled the units\n. CIM had provided the mezzanine financing for Macklowe when he purchased the units in 2022, over a decade after CIM had helped finance Macklowe\u2019s purchase of the Drake Hotel, which would ultimately become the 432 Park development. A year after buying the penthouse units, in 2023, CIM initiated foreclosure proceedings, which were ultimately halted due to a settlement that gave Macklowe a five-month period to refinance or sell the units.\nMacklowe was unable to fulfill the settlement requirements. A court order from July of last year confirmed that the units had been transferred to CIM and that Macklowe and his wife, Patricia Landeau, were ordered to vacate the premises by the end of August.\nThe 78th-floor spans 8,300 square feet and is divided into one larger 7,000-square-foot unit and a smaller 1,200-square-foot unit. The second unit could be \u201cseamlessly combined or maintained as a separate guest apartment,\u201d according to marketing materials provided to the Journal.\nSerhant\u2019s Glenn Davis and Nicholas Compagnone had the off-market listing, according to multiple sources.\nManaging to sell the units for more than Macklowe paid is still a win in a building that has faced a slew of bad press around lawsuits between the condo board and the developers, Macklowe and CIM, in the last few years.\nA lawsuit filed by the condo\nin 2021\nalleged that the 125-unit building was plagued with noise issues, leaks and broken elevators. The developers have denied those claims, but the residents followed up last year with\nanother lawsuit\nclaiming Macklowe and CIM knew the building would have problems and proceeded anyway.\nThe drama has seemed to weigh on the prices of units for sale. Ten of the 13 units currently listed on StreetEasy have experienced a price drop. Unit 84B, one of the units without a price drop, is listed for $75 million after its owner, Jose Cuervo owner Juan Beckmann Vidal, had\nreportedly\noriginally considered listing it for $90 million.",

For a deal to cross the finish line, the biggest issue that needs to be worked out is rent payments for Cooper Union, which owns the ground underneath the building. The ground rent is expected to hit $41 million in two years, according to the college\u2019s financial statement.\nIt would be a return for Rob Speyer\u2019s firm, which acquired the Chrysler Building in 1997 for $220 million. Over the next couple of decades, its interest in the property dwindled, finally washed away for good in 2019 when RFR and Signa Holding bought Tishman\u2019s remaining stake for $150 million.\nBut Cooper Union has been\nworking with Savills\nfor the better part of a year to find fresh ownership as RFR was kicked out and Signa went bankrupt.\nLast January, a judge\nterminated RFR\u2019s ground lease\nat the property, ejecting it from the skyscraper.\nRFR had sued Cooper Union in September 2024 after the school moved to terminate the company\u2019s ground lease. Cooper Union claimed the developer stopped paying rent several months earlier and racked up arrears to the tune of $21 million.\nSL Green\u2019s Marc Holliday\nexpressed interest\nin acquiring the property several months ago, but his interest reportedly cooled since then. Savanna, a Midtown office owner that\u2019s been making moves left and right, was also interested in the building.\nShould Tishman lock in its return, it will have work to do to restore the Chrysler Building to its former glory. The tenant roster includes law firm Moses &amp; Singer, Creative Artists Agency and architect Ted Moudis, but there have been complaints about elevator outages and mice. The vacancy rate of the 1-million-square-foot building is 14 percent, according to CoStar.\nTishman declined to comment to the publication.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Otaola lost to Levine Cava, placing third in an August 2024 election that the incumbent won by a landslide.\nThe county\u2019s Republican Party is supporting the recall effort against\nLevine Cava\n, a Democrat, through social media, paid ads and a website to promote the petition, which needs to be signed by at least 4 percent of Miami-Dade\u2019s 1.6 million registered voters to trigger an election.\nHowever, Levine Cava will surely count on South Florida\u2019s real estate industry to financially back efforts to tamp down the recall.\nDuring her 2024 campaign, roughly a quarter of the\n$4.6 million\nher political action committee raised prior to the August election came from 17 real estate developers and commercial property investors, finance reports analyzed by\nThe Real Deal\nshow.\nBillionaire hedge fund manager\nKen Griffin\ngave the largest contribution, with a $500,000 donation. Recently, the county approved plans for his firm Citadel\u2019s planned high-rise headquarters in Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood.\nLevine Cava\u2019s PAC collected $110,000 between October and December with half of the funds donated by real estate developers, a campaign finance report shows.\nSince she was first elected in 2020, the county has added 9,000 affordable and workforce housing units, and it will aim to add 12,000 more by the time she leaves office in 2028, Levine Cava said during her speech.\nHer administration has negotiated deals with developers to build mixed-income projects on county-owned land, including agreements to redevelop dilapidated public housing sites. The mayor identified two projects,\nGallery at River Parc\nand Brisas del Rio, by Coconut Grove-based Related Group as examples of her efforts.\n\u201cWhat was once outdated, public housing is now a walkable, mixed income community with more homes, shops, green spaces and support services,\u201d Levine Cava said. \u201cBut there\u2019s still more work to do. I directed our housing team to identify vacant county land that can be transformed into housing.\u201d\nLevine Cava highlighted permitting kiosks placed around the county to help small businesses cut through bureaucratic hurdles, and a program that provides financing to condo owners who don\u2019t have funds to pay for special assessments. During the speech, she pointed to Harrison Bloom, a constituent in the audience who opened a frozen yogurt store in Miami Beach.\n\u201cHarrison ran into familiar problems,\u201d Levine Cava said. \u201cHis plans were stalled by red tape, and city and county permitting. Through our new Strive 305 permitting kiosks, Harrison was able to complete all his permits in just 16 days.\u201d\nThe special assessment assistance program has provided a combined $53 million in interest-free loans to nearly 2,000 households in Miami-Dade, Levine Cava said.",

        "content": "Concern and offense were aired Thursday by members of an oversight committee following an attempt earlier this week to jam\namendments\nto LA\u2019s so-called mansion tax onto the June ballot.\nThursday\u2019s vote by the Measure United to House L.A. Citizens Oversight Committee, the group established through the November 2022 ballot measure to monitor use of Measure ULA funds, could offer a look at the uphill battle proposed carveouts to the two-tier property tax could face in the coming months.\nMeasure ULA\n, which went into effect in April 2023, applies a 4 percent tax on all real estate deals \u2013 commercial or single-family \u2013 starting at $5.3 million. The tax bumps up to 5.5 percent on deals of $10.6 million or more.\nThe 15-member oversight committee agreed on Thursday to send a letter to the city council expressing concern for being excluded from any process to amend Measure ULA, The body also appointed its own ad hoc committee to take a closer look at the exemptions being sought.\n\u201cHonestly, it is so offensive that this amendment was proposed [to the] city council without even once coming to the COC,\u201d committee member Jeanne Nishimoto said during the meeting. She went on to say the bid for a fast-tracked move to make changes to ULA \u201chighlights that this body is being pushed aside.\u201d\nDemocratic Socialist Nithya Raman, a leader among local progressives who represents the 4th District on the City Council, introduced her proposed changes on Friday. They seek a 15-year exemption from ULA on new multifamily, commercial and mixed-use projects in what is the most significant proposed change to the ordinance since it rolled out nearly three years ago. In addition, the motion called for a one-time, three-year carveout from ULA for property owners impacted by a natural disaster and retroactive to Jan. 7, 2025 to address Palisades Fire damages.\nRaman and supporters of the ULA changes had hoped for consideration and a vote from the 15-person council this week. However, the bid to push it onto the June ballot evaporated on Wednesday, the deadline for the city attorney to prepare a resolution for such a measure.\nInstead, Tuesday\u2019s council meeting kicked Raman\u2019s proposal down to the\nHousing and Homelessness Committee\n, which has yet to place the item on a future meeting agenda.\nWhile the ULA oversight committee\u2019s decisions do not create policy, the group acts as an advisor to the city and is billed as a cross-section of individuals with experience in housing development and finance, renter protection,\u00a0 and also includes two youth \u2014 ages 16 to 21\u2014 advisory seats.\n\u201cUnintended consequences\u201d\nAs of Thursday, Measure ULA has raised $1.1 billion across 1,497 transactions since inception. Supporters of the tax often point to the metric as proof of its\nsuccesses\n.\nCritics often take aim at the figure and harken back to 2022, when the ballot measure and its backers estimated to voters that $600 million to $1.1 billion could be generated each year from ULA.\nThe largest contributing segment to that total has been single-family residential of which 864 deals have brought in $441.5 million, according to data from the Los Angeles Housing Department through the end of 2025.\nMultifamily, which generally refers to apartments and\u00a0 is the driver behind Raman\u2019s proposed changes, is the third-largest bucket of ULA revenue, behind offices and various other types of commercial properties. Since April 2023, the multifamily segment generated has $171.9 million, or 13 percent of the overall pie.\nRaman and others, including real estate industry executives, argue that the tax has stifled multifamily construction, which runs counter to ULA\u2019s stated goal of housing affordability and homelessness prevention. Across the real estate industry brokers, agents and developers have offered similar takes as deals and construction stalls.\nMike Leipart, co-founder and managing principal of real estate sales and advisory firm Redeavor, told a crowd gathered Tuesday in Beverly Hills for\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s \u201cBuilding Luxury\u201d panel that he\u2019s seen apartment owners go for conversions and sell units individually rather than try to market a whole building and pay the ULA tax.\nSean Burton, CEO and chief investment officer of Cityview, told\nTRD\non Monday he\u2019s seeing a similar trend play out.\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting the way ULA is structured, it\u2019s actually an incentive for many landlords and property owners to break up their multifamily projects and sell them as individual units and take them out of the renter pool,\u201d Burton said. \u201cI think that\u2019s just starting to happen, but I\u2019ve heard a number of landlords talk about that because they simply feel they have no choice. I think that would be really unfortunate because the last thing we need is to be taking multifamily units out of the renter pool. It\u2019s only going to drive rents up for everybody else.\u201d\nWhile the changes would be a boon to apartment and commercial construction, some say they don\u2019t address the pain points of what luxury single-family residential agents have faced with deals falling apart or extended negotiations over the tax.\n\u201cNatural disaster exemptions are especially important, but there is still work to be done to ensure ULA does not continue to discourage investment at a time when Los Angeles needs housing and economic momentum,\u201d Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California founder and CEO Aaron Kirman told\nTRD\nthis week.\n",

        "content": "The Hamptons\u2019 residential market rode Wall Street money and tight inventory to a banner quarter.\nDuring the last three months of 2025, median home prices rose over 33 percent annually to over $2.3 million, according to a report from appraisal firm Miller Samuel for Douglas Elliman. The price marks an all-time high for the wealthy enclave.\nThe fourth quarter saw a second record for the market, with 82 homes sold for over $5 million.\nThe period caps off a return to form in the Hamptons in 2025, swept up by\na strong luxury wave\nin markets around the country. The Hamptons submarket has been hit by a double-whammy for surging prices: a booming stock market and no inventory, according to report author Jonathan Miller.\nLike other markets, the Hamptons saw deals for more affordable homes lag amid high mortgage rates, while luxury homes trade for peak prices and typically to all-cash buyers.\nMedian prices had cracked $2 million for the first time at the start of 2025. The share of homes sold for over $1 million has historically been 50 percent in the Hamptons, according to Miller, but last quarter it fell to below 30 percent.\n\u201cA big part of this price growth, it\u2019s not appreciation as much as it is a shift in the mix towards larger units,\u201d said Miller.\nThe very top of the market felt that movement last year. In 2025, the top 10 priciest deals in the Hamptons accounted for $579 million in transaction volume, a significant increase from $327 million in 2024.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all driven by the economy,\u201d said Douglas Elliman\u2019s Martha Gundersen, who had the listing for a\n$57 million sale\nin Bridgehampton in October. Gundersen noted that Wall Street bonuses drive much of the first-time Hamptons buyers who look in the sub-$20 million market, while the deals over $20 million often attract \u201cunique buyers.\u201d\n\u201c[They] sold a company, own a company [are] CEO of a company that is a financial institution that does really, really well,\u201d she said of the buyer profile of the ultra-luxury housing stock.\nThis year also saw the most expensive single-lot residential sale in Hamptons history, when Access Industries\u2019\nLen Blavatnik paid a record $115 million\nfor eight-and-a-half acres at 408 Further Lane.\nThere were roughly 1,000 homes on the market in the fourth quarter, well below the long-term historical average. The 470 sales were above the 10-year average for the fourth quarter.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the wild card in terms of seeing more activity in the Hamptons in 2026 will be, whether more sellers dip their toe into the market,\u201d he said.\n",

The refinancing will help with carrying costs for the unsold units at the West Chelsea site.\nWalker &amp; Dunlop Capital Markets Institutional Advisory arranged the financing.\nThe debt is the latest sign of how far the development has come in the years since Access and Witkoff took the reins from the now-defunct HFZ Capital Group.\nWitkoff and Access\ntook over\nthe Eleventh Avenue site in 2021 after the project\u2019s primary lender foreclosed on HFZ\u2019s stake. Under HFZ, the development was plagued by conflicts with contractors, sluggish sales and concern over the company\u2019s financial standing.\nAccess and Witkoff paid $900 million for the property, roughly the same amount HFZ paid for it in 2015. But it was already nearly two-thirds complete when it was sold by HFZ.\nWhen the developers resumed work, they put their own stamp on the property, updating unit designs so that no two in either of the twisting towers were identical. They also changed the amenity package and the finishes and swapped out a planned Six Senses Hotels Resorts Spas for a five-star Faena Hotel.\nIn the summer of 2022,\nsales re-launched\nat the project rebranded as One High Line from The XI.

        "content": "A North Side Chicago congregation is moving closer to a major lakefront-adjacent redevelopment that could bring hundreds of apartments, retail and a new place of worship to Sheridan Road.\nEmanuel Congregation, which has occupied its campus at 5959 North Sheridan Road since the 1950s, is working with Chicago-based developer Fern Hill Company on a mixed-use plan that would replace and expand the synagogue while adding residential buildings on both sides of the street,\naccording\nto Block Club Chicago. After months of meetings with congregants and neighborhood groups, the team submitted a zoning change request to 48th Ward Alderman Leni Manaa-Hoppenworth\u2019s office.\nThe proposal would allow two new buildings, the centerpiece being a 12-story, U-shaped structure fronting Sheridan Road that would incorporate a new synagogue on its lower floors, ground-floor commercial space and apartments above. Across the street, Fern Hill plans a five-story apartment building at 5948\nNorth Sheridan Road\n, a vacant parcel the firm bought last year for $5 million from Chicago-based Quest Realty Group, the outlet reported. Quest had previously explored a smaller, 59-unit\napartment project\non the site.\nIf approved, the larger building would also absorb Emanuel\u2019s existing synagogue and a neighboring home at 5965 North Sheridan, which Fern Hill would acquire as part of the deal, Fern Hill President Nick Anderson told Block Club. Renderings show the project opening south toward Lane Beach, an orientation the current building lacks.\nThe final unit count and parking totals are still in flux and will be shaped by further\ncommunity input\n, Anderson said. But under the zoning envelope the team is seeking, the development could support up to 605\napartments\nacross both buildings. Any rezoning would trigger Chicago\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance, requiring 20 percent of the units to be affordable.\nFor the congregation, the redevelopment is as much about right-sizing as it is about location. Emanuel\u2019s existing 35,000-square-foot synagogue opened in 1955, when planners expected DuSable Lake Shore Drive to extend north through the site. Designed with a highway in mind, the building\u2019s east wall is largely windowless and soundproofed, according to the publication, even though the road was never built and Lake Michigan now sits just steps away.\nToday, Emanuel counts about 250 households and said the aging building is too large and costly to maintain. Plans call for a more efficient synagogue occupying the second and third floors of the new building, with a sanctuary, chapel, social halls, classrooms and offices. Housing revenue would help fund construction.\nManaa-Hoppenworth said her office will host a community meeting on the proposal next month.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Three Oakland office properties have been taken over by a receiver after falling into \u201csignificant disrepair\u201d following a loan default.\nLender Rialto Capital Management\nfiled a lawsuit\nin Alameda County Superior Court to foreclose on a portfolio that includes\nOakland\u2019s Tribune Tower\n, the Financial Center building at 405 14th Street and offices at 1500 Broadway, the San Francisco Business Times reported. The move comes after Highbridge Equity Partners defaulted on a $111 million Rialto loan last year. Touchstone Commercial Partners\u2019 Christian Diggs has been appointed as receiver, operating and managing the property in Highbridge\u2019s place.\nThe three buildings have seen better days, according to the lawsuit. The legal filings claim the structures have broken windows, asbestos, and faulty elevators among other debris. People have reportedly been entering the buildings illegally and stealing copper wiring and others have been illegally camping inside, a receiver report said.\nTribune Tower at 401 13th Street reportedly has significant flood damage and is riddled with drug paraphernalia, abandoned mattresses and health and safety hazards like dog feces. The 16-story Financial Center Building a block away at 405 14th Street has a large amount of asbestos and debris with broken elevators. The 1500 Broadway building has broken windows and is plagued with plumbing and electrical issues.\nIn addition to defaulting on the $111 million loan, Highbridge also owed approximately $650,000 in property taxes across all three properties when the receiver took over last fall, which the receiver worked with Rialto to pay off. Another $650,000 payment is due in April. Rialto provided the $111 million loan in 2022 to refinance $91.1 million in existing debt and to pay for future renovations and improvements on the properties.\nHighbridge reportedly stopped making monthly payments on the debt last June and was\nserved a notice of default\ntwo months later. The unpaid balance is reportedly north of $100 million.\nHighbridge bought the three buildings between 2016 and 2019, for a total of $119.6 million. Whether Highbridge\u2019s lenders choose to sell the buildings to recoup all or some of the $111 million loan remains to be seen.\nOakland and the rest of the Bay Area have seen a\nstring of loan defaults and foreclosures\nat commercial properties in recent years. This week alone, Deutsche Bank\nseized\nthree other office towers in downtown Oakland via deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, taking control of 2101 Webster Street, 1901 Harrison Street and 2100 Franklin Street.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

In total, the landlords reportedly booked almost 3,000 reservations that violated the city\u2019s Residential Leasing Requirements Ordinance.\nAccording to city attorneys, the landlords would wait for long-term tenants to move out, list the unit online, rent it out for month-to-month stays and cover up their tracks with what the city calls a \u201csham\u201d one-year lease after the booking was confirmed. Guests allegedly booked their intended stays on Airbnb and then were asked to sign leases that made the rentals look compliant with city laws even though neither tenant nor landlord intended for there to be a year-long tenancy.\nThe rentals were usually furnished and not used as primary residences by\nthe tenants\n, both of which are illegal under the ordinance. The landlords in some cases also allegedly did not file rent-control vacancy registration forms. Santa Monica\u2019s Residential Leasing Requirements Ordinance was passed in 2020 and requires leases to be one year or longer for unfurnished units and for tenants to use the units as their primary residence. The goal with the legislation is to keep much-needed multifamily housing off the short-term rental market.\n\u201cPreserving rent-controlled apartment homes and keeping rents down are top priorities for the city,\u201d Jonathan Frank, deputy city attorney for the City of Santa Monica, said in a\nstatement\n. \u201cThe city takes violations of its short-term rental ordinances seriously and will enforce them when needed.\u201d\nCity officials are asking the county to step in and put a stop to the alleged rental violations, force the disgorgement of the roughly $18 million in profits made and hand down civil penalties of $2,500 per violation. The case is pending in Los Angeles County Superior Court.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The building, long known as the Tremont Hotel, last traded after being swept up in a foreclosure and briefly repurposed by the city during Chicago\u2019s migrant crisis, CoStar\nreported\n.\nThe sale comes as signs of life return to the Magnificent Mile, the city\u2019s marquee retail strip along Michigan Avenue that struggled with vacancies and muted leasing since the pandemic. Hotel investors are starting to show up again, and late last year,\nVinayaka Hospitality\npaid $72 million for the 752-room Westin Michigan Avenue Chicago at 909 North Michigan Avenue, one of the corridor\u2019s biggest recent lodging trades.\nThe Chestnut Street property has had a turbulent few years. It housed\nMike Ditka\u2019s\nlongtime namesake restaurant, a neighborhood fixture that closed in early 2020 after more than two decades, shortly after the hotel \u2014 then operating under the Selina brand \u2014 shut down as a result of the pandemic, according to the outlet.\nIndianapolis-based Hotel Capital owned the vacant property when it was hit with a $25 million foreclosure lawsuit in 2023 by a lender affiliated with\nLaSalle Investment Management\n. After the legal process played out,\nthe city leased the building\nin 2023 and 2024 as a temporary homeless shelter to help absorb an influx of migrants and a shortage of beds for unhoused residents. The shelter closed in September 2024.\nLaSalle Investment Management seized the property through a judicial sale last fall and sold it to Avasa. The $13.2 million acquisition was financed with a $10 million loan from Millennium Bank, records show. Paramount Lodging Advisors\u2019 Sanjeev Misra represented the seller.\nAvasa Hospitality, based in Elk Grove Village, has five suburban Chicago hotels in its portfolio as well as experience in hotel design and management, according to their website.

In May, the nonprofit\npurchased 2,490 acres\nof land at the ranch. The previous October, the trust bought the adjacent 1,340-acre Pescadero Ranch, which was previously part of the Sargent Ranch. Peninsula Open Space Trust made the latest acquisition with financial help from the Santa Clara Valley Water District, Land Trust of Santa Cruz County and other unnamed donors. The nonprofit now owns 6,114 acres of the 6,500-acre ranch and is in contract to buy the remaining acreage later this year.\nSargent Ranch Partners LLC, an investor group led by\nSan Diego\nbusinessman Howard Justus that previously owned the land, sought to develop a 403-acre mining operation at the ranch to extract 38 million tons of sand and gravel over 30 years. The proposal faced fierce backlash from locals out of concern for noise, congestion and damage to the landscape. The developer hasn\u2019t officially killed its quarry plan, though the sale of the property is likely the end of that endeavor. Owners also had floated various commercial ventures at the location, including hotels, golf courses and a casino.\nThe region\u2019s\nNative American\ncommunity, the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band, helped lead efforts to stop development on the land, which they call Juristac.

        "content": "A long-simmering grievance among homeowners is hardening into a national political push to eliminate property taxes on primary residences altogether.\nRising assessments have juiced tax payments across the country, and Republican lawmakers in several states are now floating plans that would upend one of local government\u2019s core revenue streams \u2014 with sweeping implications for housing, schools and municipal finance, the Associated Press\nreported\n. The movement is gaining traction in oil-rich North Dakota and Sun Belt growth states alike.\nNorth Dakota Republicans said they are already on a path to zeroing out homeowner property taxes by tapping the state\u2019s $13.4 billion oil tax savings account. In Georgia, House Republicans this week rolled out a plan to phase out most homeowner property taxes by 2032. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis embraced a similar goal, while Texas Gov. Greg Abbott wants to eliminate property taxes that fund schools, the outlet reported.\nTexas has been using its surplus funds to finance property tax reductions. In November, Texas voters increased the state\u2019s\nhomestead exemption\n\u2014 the portion of a home\u2019s value shielded from school property taxes \u2014 from $100,000 to $140,000. That translates to roughly $490 in annual savings for the owner of a typical $302,000 Texas home,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported.\nFollowing the vote, Abbott launched his reelection campaign in November by pitching a six-point plan that would slash appraisal growth, restrict local spending and give voters far greater control over tax increases.\nAccording to Abbott, the Legislature\u2019s record $51 billion allocation for tax relief in 2025 was blunted by local governments raising their own levies. Abbott now wants to\ntie local spending growth\nto 3.5 percent, or population growth plus inflation, whichever is lower, and by extending the state\u2019s debt and deficit limits to counties, cities and school districts.\nProperty taxes generate billions \u2014 or tens of billions \u2014 annually in most states, underwriting K-12 schools, police and fire departments and basic municipal services. Replacing that revenue without\ngutting services\nwould require higher sales taxes, new fees or deep spending cuts.\nIn Georgia, House Speaker Jon Burns wants to wipe out $5.2 billion in homeowner property taxes, more than a quarter of the state\u2019s total property tax haul in 2024. Cities, counties and school districts would be pushed to lean on existing or newly approved sales taxes, capped at a combined local rate of 5 percent on top of the state\u2019s 4 percent. The plan would also allow local governments to bill homeowners separately for services like garbage pickup and fire protection \u2014 fees lawmakers insist are not taxes.\n\u201cNo one should ever face the loss of their home because they can\u2019t pay rent to the government,\u201d Burns said as he unveiled his plan.\nThe appeal is obvious for real estate, as property taxes are often baked into housing affordability calculations, and sharp increases have been especially painful for retirees and owners who have paid off their mortgages. In fast-growing metros, tax relief could buoy home values and reduce pressure to sell, according to the publication.\nBut policy analysts warn the cure could be worse than the disease, as past revolts, like California\u2019s Proposition 13, reshaped development patterns and constrained local budgets for decades. Critics cited by the outlet said that eliminating\nhomeowner taxes\nrisks shifting the burden onto renters, commercial property owners or consumers through higher sales taxes.\nNorth Dakota\u2019s approach \u2014 using state oil revenues to subsidize local governments \u2014 is the cleanest case, but it\u2019s also the hardest to replicate. The outlet reported that elsewhere, proposals face political hurdles, constitutional amendments and voter approval.\nThe property tax revolt is back, but whether it becomes law \u2014 or just another campaign-season promise \u2014 will determine who really pays for the American home.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Getting an apartment project off the ground in today\u2019s tight lending environment and sluggish multifamily market isn\u2019t easy, but\npublic-private partnerships and North Texas growth\ncan provide a much-needed boost.\nStryker Properties and Griffon Capital Management scored financing for Freemont Frisco Apartments, a planned project with an affordable component in fast-growing\nFrisco\n. BridgeInvest is providing a $57 million construction loan for the 313-unit development that will be built at 9402 Frisco Street, according to a news release from the lender. The financing works out to about $182,000 per unit.\nAn undisclosed portion of the units will be available at\naffordable rates\n, as part of the project\u2019s partnership with the Housing Authority of the City of Frisco. The developer team did a sale-leaseback with the organization and entered into a ground lease, property records show.\nPublic-private partnerships have been critical to getting projects to pencil while institutional lending is harder to access.\nPlus, Frisco\u2019s rapid growth insulates projects from the region\u2019s multifamily headwinds. The average monthly rent for Dallas-Fort Worth multifamily projects was down 0.4 percent from the second to the third quarter of 2025 to $1,541 per month, according to a recent report from CBRE. Frisco, a city of more than 200,000 people about 30 miles north of Dallas, is a consistently strong submarket, thanks to its population growth. In 2024, its population jumped 6.9 percent, BridgeInvest\u2019s release shows.\nThe combination of public funding and high-growth submarket is the same recipe JPI recently used to help finance the development of Jefferson Ownsby, a 436-unit apartment complex it\u2019s building in Celina. JPI landed $23.5 million in\nC-PACE funding\n, the state policy-enabled green lending program, for the project at 317 East Ownsby Parkway.\nStryker Properties is a multifamily syndicator based in Plano. Griffon Capital Management is an apartment developer based in Corpus Christi.\n",

        "content": "Elk Grove Village is giving Nexstar Media Group more time to jump-start its long-planned data center redevelopment of the WGN radio transmitter site, pushing the construction deadline to fall 2027 as power issues continue to dog the project.\nVillage officials agreed this week to extend the deadline to begin construction at 720 Rohlwing Road to Sept. 30, 2027, nearly five years after the Irving, Texas-based media company first floated plans to redevelop the property. The core holdup of getting enough electricity to the site hasn\u2019t changed, Mayor Craig Johnson told the Daily Herald, which first\nreported\nthe matter.\nNexstar acquired the 50,000-watt AM station in 2019 and in 2022 proposed selling off the southern 35 acres of the 102-acre property for a three-building\ndata center campus\n, along with an electrical substation and six public pickleball courts to be leased to the Elk Grove Park District. According to the outlet, the plan also called for demolishing and relocating the site\u2019s iconic 750-foot radio tower and its 250-foot backup, while keeping the small transmitter building intact.\nThose plans have since evolved, as Johnson said Nexstar is now envisioning four data center buildings spread across a larger portion of the site and no longer needs to replace the old towers, as radio transmission can be handled through other means. Nexstar declined to detail the revised plan, but said WGN listeners would not lose over-the-air or online service.\nWhen the property was annexed into Elk Grove Village in July 2023, Nexstar signed a redevelopment agreement laying out a phased construction schedule, landscaping buffers and flood control protections for nearby homes, as well as the pickleball courts. Under that deal, construction of the first data center was supposed to begin within two years \u2014 a deadline that has now passed.\nJohnson, an outspoken champion of\ndata centers\n, told the outlet that\nElk Grove Village\nalready hosts 15 facilities, with another 17 proposed. He previously steered Nexstar away from a trucking and logistics concept, arguing data centers would be a better fit next to\nresidential neighborhoods\n.\nA solution to the power situation constraints is progressing. Earlier this month, the village agreed to sell a vacant 1.2-acre parcel at 300 East Devon Avenue to Commonwealth Edison for about $3.6 million. Johnson said the utility has contracts on five neighboring parcels, signaling groundwork for the infrastructure needed to finally bring the data center campus to life.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The former principal of DJE Texas Management Group agreed to plead guilty to wire fraud, capping a fast-moving collapse of a once-active Texas real estate investment firm and setting up a major restitution payment for defrauded investors.\nSan Antonio-based syndicator Devin Elder reached a plea agreement with the U.S. government in the Western District of Texas, according to court filings. While the terms of the deal remain under seal, the documents state that Elder will be required to repay roughly $66 million to investors, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n. The FBI opened a criminal investigation into DJE in 2025, prompting federal authorities to pause a parallel civil case in favor of the\ncriminal probe\n.\nIn charging documents filed Wednesday, prosecutors allege Elder solicited investors nationwide by pitching 10 percent returns and touting conservative deal structures, including claims that properties would be acquired without debt and that investor funds would not be commingled between projects. Prosecutors say those representations were false.\nInstead, Elder allegedly used a bank account under the name \u201cDJE Equity 01, LLC\u201d to disguise the source and movement of investor funds, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. The outlet reported that the government said Elder and DJE used new investor money to make so-called interest payments and other distributions to earlier investors, creating the appearance of successful projects while allegedly concealing cash shortfalls and misuse of funds \u2014 a playbook prosecutors said helped lure additional capital.\nRed flags began surfacing publicly in April 2025, when Elder told investors he planned to lay off staff and sell assets in response to economic headwinds. DJE hired an outside\nconsultant\nto wind down operations, but multiple investors later told the publication that communication had broken down and they feared their capital was gone.\nIn July, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office\nfiled a warrant\nto seize about 1,000 acres of land tied to DJE across six South Texas counties.\nThe criminal case landed on top of a growing pile of lawsuits from vendors and investors alleging breach of contract and fraud. In one high-profile dispute, a buyer of an apartment complex formerly owned by DJE \u2014 Denver-based Platte Canyon Capital \u2014 accused Elder of\nsiphoning rents\nand misrepresenting the property\u2019s financial condition.\nA court hearing has not yet been scheduled. Elder and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A sprawling warehouse on San Antonio\u2019s East Side once billed as the city\u2019s largest industrial development might be headed for an unusual new buyer: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nICE is considering acquiring Oakmont 410, a 639,595-square-foot warehouse at 542 Southeast Loop 410, according to sources\ncited\nby the San Antonio Business Journal. The building, completed in 2022 and owned by Oakmont Industrial Group, has sat vacant despite nearly three years on the lease market.\nMultiple real estate sources told the outlet that\nICE\nis expected to close on the property imminently, though no transaction has yet to be recorded in Bexar County records. Oakmont and ICE did not respond to requests for comment. The property is marketed by Partners Real Estate, whose brokers declined to comment.\nIf the deal goes through, it would align with\nICE\u2019s broader nationwide push\nto secure \u201csubstantially large\u201d warehouse facilities for detainee processing and detention. Another source told the publication that a private contractor is handling site selection for\nICE\n, with one in McAllen also under consideration.\nSimilar searches have surfaced elsewhere: the Kansas City Business Journal recently reported that ICE was evaluating a 920,400-square-foot warehouse there, following a December Washington Post report on the agency\u2019s hunt for warehouse-style facilities across the country.\nD Magazine confirmed a planned\n1-million-square-foot detention\ncenter in Hutchins \u2014 a small town in Dallas County southeast of Dallas, first mentioned in that Washington Post report. The warehouse at 950 North I-45, next to the Hutchins State Jail, is capable of holding up to 9,500 people, more than 10 times the capacity of the nearest ICE facility in Prairieland.\nThe Oakmont building\u2019s zoning could complicate matters. While it carries an industrial designation, that zoning does not allow human occupancy, meaning a special use permit from the city would likely be required if the facility were converted to house detainees, according to the publication. The property did receive a zoning verification letter from the city in December, a common step ahead of a potential sale.\nLocal officials are already signaling resistance. Bexar County Commissioner Tommy Calvert, who represents the area, said he was unaware of ICE\u2019s interest, but forcefully opposed the idea, calling detention facilities \u201cthe most disreputable commercial activity since WWII\u201d and vowing to fight any such use. A spokesperson for District 2 Councilmember Jalen McKee-Rodriguez declined to comment, labeling the reports speculative.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Soon thereafter, they applied for and received city approval to\ndemolish the home\nand build a new residence from the ground up. In 2024, city officials\ndesignated Monroe\u2019s former home\na\nLos Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument\nafter Milstein and Bank\u2019s permits were already approved.\n\u201cIn doing so, the city has turned the property into a tourist attraction, attracting (as the city wanted and expected) traffic congestion on the short, narrow dead-end street adjacent to the property along with numerous trespassers leaping over and onto property walls to get into the \u201cdesignated\u201d house (which cannot be seen from the public realm due to the property wall and landscaping),\u201d the court filings state, according to the Post.\nAs a result of the heightened interest around the home, the homeowners claim that burglars searching for memorabilia broke into the home in November. They even had to hire their own private security for the property.\nMilstein and Bank said that the city never worked to deem the building historically significant in the decades since Monroe\u2019s death after it changed hands multiple times and underwent several renovations. By declaring the structure a historic-cultural monument, the city \u201crendered the property useless,\u201d the couple said.\nThe homeowners are asking the court to either allow them to proceed with their demolition plans or force the city to pay them the value of the home.

        "content": "Even an office building built for pandemic realities isn\u2019t immune to tenant downsizing.\nCosmetic laser company Alma Lasers listed its 10,600 square-foot space on the fifth floor of the office building called Fulton East in Chicago\u2019s trendy Fulton Market neighborhood. The lease has three years remaining, according to the Cushman &amp; Wakefield listing for the space.\nThe downsizing is the first setback for the building at 215 North Peoria Street, owned and developed by Chicago-based Parkside Realty. In 2020, the newly completed Fulton East building made headlines for incorporating high-tech, health-focused amenities to combat the spread of Covid, such as full building air purification, touchless elevators and antibacterial interior paint.\nThe building\u2019s scale and location were also well-suited to shifts in office trends. At 12 stories and 90,000 square feet, Fulton East is generally easier to fill than the massive skyscrapers languishing in the Chicago loop, like the city\u2019s largest office building,\nthe Willis Tower\n.\nFulton East first reached\nfull occupancy in June 2023\n.\nAlma Lasers, a subsidiary of Israel-based Sisram Medical Group, hired Chicago-based general contractor Redmond to build out space on the first and ninth floors of the Fulton East building in 2023. The first floor is an Alma-owned MedSpa called Sisram Wellness Center, and the ninth floor serves as space for the company\u2019s corporate offices. Alma later hired Redmond again to build out additional office space on the fifth floor, according to Redmond\u2019s website.\nThe status of the fifth floor work is unclear. Redmond\u2019s website describes fifth floor construction as completed in 2025, but the Cushman &amp; Wakefield sublease listing posted earlier this month states that the space is \u201ccurrently under construction.\u201d\nCushman &amp; Wakefield brokers Jeffrey Skender and Jonathan Metzl are representing the landlord. Skender, Metzl and representatives of Alma, Redmond and Parkside did not respond to requests for comment.\nOver the past 10 years, Fulton Market has transformed from a meatpacking hub to a mixed-use district filled with loft office space and trendy bars, restaurants and stores. As a result, it leads the city in office leasing, as tenants search for buildings that draw employees out of the home office with amenities and nearby attractions. In the last quarter of 2025, Fulton Market had a 16.8 percent vacancy rate, compared to a 26.6 percent vacancy rate in the city overall, according to CBRE.\nYet, since the pandemic, some\ntenants have been scaling back\nin the trendy neighborhood.\nHealthcare software company Waystar and employer review platform Glassdoor\nboth listed a combined 63,000 square feet\nof sublease space in Fulton Market in early 2024.\nOther companies that listed sublease space in the neighborhood around the same time included\npublic relations firm WPP\n, upscale coffee and snack retailer Foxtrot, tech company Hologram,\nadvisory firm Kroll\nand food packaging company\nHazel Technologies\n.\nStill, interest from prospective new tenants remains high.\nMcLean, Virginia-based candy giant\nMars reached an agreement\nto lease a large space at Trammell Crow\u2019s office building at 400 North Aberdeen Street in Fulton Market last month. Those familiar with the deal said the company is expected to lease over 100,000 square feet of space.",

        "content": "Yet another artificial intelligence-powered company is\nexpanding its office footprint\nin San Francisco.\nIntercom, a locally based tech firm that makes AI customer service software,\nleased\napproximately 45,000 square feet of offices at 85 Second Street in the Financial District, the San Francisco Business Times reported. The firm isn\u2019t moving far from its current 40,000 square feet at the KPMG Building next door at 55 Second Street.\nIntercom was reportedly expected to renew its lease at 55 Second Street, according to sources close to the matter cited by the Business Times. Paramount Group, a Manhattan-based investor that operates the building, reportedly couldn\u2019t keep up with its timeline for completing the renewal, leading Intercom to sign the lease at 85 Second, per the Business Times.\nThe AI firm\u2019s departure from 55 Second Street marks the latest exit from the building.\nKPMG, the building\u2019s namesake tenant, announced in late 2024 that it planned to move out of the structure in September this year. The professional services firm will relocate into a new 96,296-square-foot space at 505 Howard Street, the Business Times\nreported\n. Workforce management software company Rippling signed a lease to shift its headquarters to 430 California Street from 55 Second in June 2024.\nThe 380,000-square-foot 55 Second Street is backed by a $187.5 million loan that matures in October. Last year, Paramount\u2019s lenders\nlisted the debt for sale\n, though no deal for the loan has emerged yet.\nAI companies like Intercom have been key players in\ndriving demand for office space\nin post-pandemic San Francisco. Earlier this week, news surfaced that Decagon, another AI-powered customer service company, is\nin negotiations\nto lease approximately 70,000 square feet at 680 Folsom Street.\nOverall, vacant or available office space in San Francisco decreased by nearly 2 million square feet last quarter, making for the steepest\ndrop in office availability\nin four consecutive quarters of decline. Companies, many of them tech and AI firms, leased more than 1 million more square feet that they vacated in the fourth quarter, marking the biggest rate of positive absorption since 2018.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Gary Barnett is having a moment in Midtown, and it\u2019s not just\nabout new construction\n.\nWithin days, the Extell Development founder popped up on two very different fronts: quietly\nlocking up one of the most consequential development assemblages on Park Avenue\nand winning a court ruling that clears the way for him to\npotentially take control of a deeply distressed office tower\nowned by rivals SL Green and RXR.\nTogether, the moves underscore Barnett\u2019s playbook in a market still working through pain: lean into prime locations, exploit dislocation and don\u2019t shy away from conflict.\nOn the growth side, Barnett is\nin contract\nto buy 405-415 Park Avenue, air rights from Central Synagogue and is negotiating for the adjacent office building at 110 East 55th Street, according to people familiar with the deal.\nSellers were shopping the pieces for north of $500 million, The Promote first reported, and the combined site could support roughly 700,000 square feet with additional air rights. The assemblage sits just steps from JPMorgan Chase\u2019s new 270 Park headquarters and near Citadel and Vornado\u2019s planned 350 Park tower, placing it squarely in the corridor where trophy office capital is concentrated.\nAt the same time, Barnett is pressing his advantage on the other end of the market. A state Supreme Court judge this week\ndenied\nSL Green and RXR\u2019s attempt to block a UCC foreclosure auction tied to Worldwide Plaza, clearing the way for Extell to move forward after quietly acquiring the senior mezzanine debt.\nThe owners had argued the auction was a sham designed to hand Barnett the keys. The judge disagreed, emphasizing that sophisticated parties are bound by the contracts they sign.\nWorldwide Plaza is a case study in office distress: roughly 40 percent vacant after Cravath\u2019s exit, burdened by nearly $1 billion in senior CMBS debt and now headed toward a mezz sale where Extell is the only qualified bidder. Control of the debt would give Barnett enormous leverage over the 1.8 million-square-foot tower\u2019s future.\nTaken together, the Park Avenue assemblage and the Worldwide Plaza fight show Barnett operating on two tracks at once \u2014 assembling blue-chip dirt for the next cycle while using debt to pry opportunities out of this one.\nIn a bifurcated Midtown market, he\u2019s betting both ends will pay off.\nGary Barnett isn\u2019t the only one making news in New York City real estate this week. Here are other top stories of the week:\n\u201cCheap hookers\u201d: Email from Tal Alexander revealed in Hamptons accuser\u2019s cross-examination\nThe third day of the Alexander brothers\u2019 sex trafficking trial focused on the cross-examination of Maya Miller, a woman who accused Tal Alexander of raping her in the Hamptons in 2014.\nProsecutors allege Oren, Alon and Tal engaged in a\nconspiracy to commit sex trafficking\nfrom 2008 to 2021, including drugging and sexually assaulting women. The brothers have denied the allegations and pleaded not guilty to the charges.\nAlso, check out\nthe first episode\nof our documentary on the Alexander brothers.\nFictitious deals and phony emails: New Nussbaum filings lay bare alleged Ponzi scheme\nDisgraced attorney Mark Nussbaum admitted in legal filings to diverting $336 million from his law firm\u2019s escrow clients to real estate investor Mendel Steiner and his family between 2022 and 2025 as part of an alleged Ponzi scheme.\nThe filings reveal Nussbaum directly transferred $24 million to Steiner or his family\u2019s companies, and an additional $68 million was routed to his family via Steiner\u2019s companies, Aven Realty and Real Green Management, which also paid Nussbaum $104 million.\nCarmel Partners buys piece of $500M UWS apartment portfolio\nRon Zeff\u2019s Carmel Partners is buying into a $500 million\nmultifamily portfolio\nthat was pitched as an investment shielded from a potential\nrent freeze\nunder Mayor Zohran Mamdani.\nThe investment firm is nearing a deal to buy MetLife\u2019s minority stake in a five-building, 710-unit portfolio near Columbus Circle. Four of the five buildings are free market and the fifth is subject to an\nolder 421a agreement\nunder which an owner could raise rents by 47 percent before hitting legal rent limits.\nEli Karp sues Greystone, BBG over alleged \u201cloan-to-own\u201d appraisal scheme\nDeveloper Eli Karp is suing lender Greystone and appraisal firm BBG, alleging they engineered a \u201cloan-to-own\u201d scheme by intentionally overvaluing his 271 Lenox Road apartment building.\nThe suit claims BBG\u2019s 2019 appraisal of $46.2 million was used to lure Karp into a $34.5 million bridge loan; a subsequent 2024 appraisal valued the property at $29.6 million, which Karp uses as evidence of fraudulent inflation.\nAfter defaulting, the property sold at foreclosure for $10 million, leaving Karp responsible for a $15 million personal guarantee.\nHe is seeking $16.6 million in damages for the alleged appraisal inflation and an additional $122 million from Greystone for lost opportunities.\nCouncil revives two housing regulation bills, COPA remains vetoed\nFinally, the City Council overrode 17 of former Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 vetoes, including two housing regulation bills that set minimum percentages for homeownership and low-income units in city-financed projects.\nThe Council, however, did not override the veto of the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act, though the bill\u2019s sponsor plans to reintroduce the measure.\nOther vetoes reversed included measures to set minimum wages for building security guards, increase transparency in the co-op application process and create a city-run land bank.\n",

        "content": "With fresh snow piled high and temperatures below freezing, reporters with\nThe Real Deal\ntrudged to a Lower Manhattan courthouse this week to watch the Alexanders brothers\u2019 federal sex trafficking unfold.\nThe proceedings marked the culmination of nearly two years of reporting on allegations that disgraced brokers Tal and Oren Alexander and Oren\u2019s twin brother, Alon Alexander, sexually assaulted multiple women. The brothers were arrested in December 2024 on federal sex trafficking charges and have remained in custody at a Brooklyn jail since January 2025.\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s happened so far.\nProsecutors with the Southern District of New York\nkicked off Tuesday\nwith an opening statement detailing their case against the brothers, including accusing them of working together between 2008 and 2021 to lure women to destinations like the Hamptons and the Bahamas with the promise of luxury travel and exclusive experiences. However, once the women arrived, they were sexually assaulted and, in some cases, drugged by one or more of the brothers, prosecutors allege.\nDefense attorneys pushed back against prosecutors\u2019 characterization of the brothers\u2019 lifestyle, arguing instead that the brothers\u2019 womanizing behavior was \u201ccrude\u201d but not criminal. They also challenged prosecutors\u2019 allegations that the Alexanders drugged women to attack them, pointing to a lack of toxicology or medical reports to corroborate accusers\u2019 claims. (\n about opening statements here\n.)\nTwo women took the stand this week. One testified on Tuesday under the pseudonym \u201cKatie Moore\u201d to describe how she met Tal and Alon at a 2012 NBA Championships watch party at actor Zac Efron\u2019s apartment before she was drugged while at a nightclub with the brothers. She told the court she blacked out and woke up naked in a bed with Alon standing over her. She said he laughed when she told him she didn\u2019t want to have sex and told her she already had. She alleges he then raped her again. (\nRead the story on her testimony here\n.)\nOn Wednesday,\na woman using the pseudonym \u201cMaya Miller\u201d recounted her claim that she was drugged and raped by Tal in the Hamptons in August 2014. She claimed that on her second night at a weekend trip in a Sag Harbor mansion, she felt the mood shift and began to fear for her and her friend\u2019s safety. As Miller was trying to leave the next morning, she claimed Tal cornered her in the shower and raped her. (\nRead the story on her testimony here\n.)\nAttorneys representing the defendants cross-examined each alleged victim, questioning both women on who they told and when, including pressing Miller on why she didn\u2019t seek help from her friend, who was in the bathroom while she was allegedly being attacked by Tal in the shower.\nAttorneys also questioned the women about their alcohol consumption, including their prior habits and leading up to the alleged rapes. Howard Srebnick, an attorney for Alon, asked Moore several questions about the \u201clittle bit\u201d of MDMA she admitted to taking early on in the night.\nBy Thursday, the proceedings\nhad touched on allegations concerning\neach of the three brothers, including the start of testimony related to a sexual exploitation of a minor charge that Oren is facing over an alleged rape in 2009 captured on video. Prosecutors wrapped up the week by walking jurors through a series of photos and videos taken on the night of the alleged attack.\nThe Alexanders, their attorneys and\nTRD\nwill be back in the courtroom on Monday, when the woman depicted in the video is expected to testify.\nNot so fast\u2026\nBrooklyn\u2019s ultra-luxury market\nhit a growth spurt\nlast year, though it\u2019s still trailing behind its golden years following the pandemic.\nIn 2025, the borough notched 12 deals for $10 million or more, up 50 percent from 8 the previous year, according to\nCompass\u2019 annual report\n. The sales totaled $143 million, up 34 percent year-over-year from $107 million.\nDespite the uptick, the market is still down from 2022, a banner year for Brooklyn\u2019s luxury deals as buyers flocked to the outer boroughs in the wake of the pandemic. That year, 13 deals closed for homes priced at $10 million or more for a volume of more than $170 million.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe most expensive sale to hit the city rolls this week was for two adjacent townhouses in the West Village. New York University\u2019s Law School sold the pair of properties at 63 and 65 Charles Street for $33.4 million. The buyer was an anonymous LLC with an address in the Cayman Islands.\n",

        "content": "New York City is a dangerous place for birds.\nFor the second year in a row, a record number of migrating birds were killed after flying headfirst into the city\u2019s nearly invisible skyline, according to the\nNew York Post\n. At least 1,250 warblers, flickers and other birds died during their annual fall migration, surpassing last year\u2019s grim record of nearly 1,000. And conservationists say the true toll is likely far higher, thanks to an unusually heavy migration season that sent thousands more birds through the five boroughs.\nCity Hall has come up with at least one answer \u2014 bird-friendly glass. In 2021, Local Law 15 went into effect, requiring most new buildings and major renovations to use bird-safe materials on 90 percent of their facade up to the first 75 feet, the danger zone where birds are most likely to collide with glass.\nThe idea is simple \u2014 make buildings visible to birds and fewer of them will die. On paper, it\u2019s hard to argue with that. Fewer dead birds is a clear win.\nBut the law also comes with a price tag, and that\u2019s where the debate gets complicated. Related Companies\u2019 Jeff Blau recently pointed to an affordable housing project he\u2019s building at Willets Point, where complying with the bird-glass requirement will cost roughly $2 million. Those extra costs, Blau argued, could otherwise go toward building more apartments. The development is subsidized by the city, he added, so it\u2019s helping foot the bill.\n\u201cThe city is paying the money for bird glass instead of more affordable apartments,\u201d Blau said at last month\u2019s NYU Schack capital markets conference. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense.\u201d\nIt\u2019s an uncomfortable tradeoff. Saving wildlife is important. So is building housing in a city with a chronic shortage. When the same public dollars are funding both, it\u2019s fair to ask whether the policy is delivering the biggest bang for its buck.\nConservation advocates counter that prices for bird-friendly glass have fallen as demand has grown, and that the upfront cost can help building owners avoid expensive repairs from bird collisions or the potential cost to retrofit existing buildings. The Council introduced a new bill in 2024 that would require most landlords to comply with bird-friendly standards in existing buildings by 2030.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a challenge in a city like this, with housing so scarce and the need for affordable housing so great,\u201d said Jessica Wilson of NYC Bird Alliance. \u201cThere are many benefits to protecting birds and saving biodiversity, including improving human health and mental well-being.\u201d\nGlass is one of several threats to birds. Advocates support complementary measures like turning off unused lights at night to reduce bird deaths. Public education about lighting rules or even investing in habitat restoration could arguably save more birds per dollar spent, but conservationists argue that these broader strategies don\u2019t replace the need for bird-friendly building measures.\n\u201cBirds and biodiversity are a critical part of a sustainable and resilient city, and when you make the city better for wildlife, [you] make it healthier and a better place for people also,\u201d Wilson said.\nNone of this is an argument against protecting wildlife. New York can love birds and build housing at the same time. The question is whether bird glass, as currently mandated, is the smartest way to do both.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nAI voice analytics company Rilla inked a 57,000-square-foot lease this month at Global Holdings\u2019\n25 Kent\nin Williamsburg in one of the borough\u2019s biggest office deals of the past year. Leases of that size are rare for Class A buildings in the borough, where last year\u2019s\nbiggest signings\nlargely landed in Class B and C towers. Could the AI boom finally give Brooklyn\u2019s top-tier office market a lift? Send a note to\nelizabeth.cryan@therealdeal.com\nwith your thoughts.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nSome people have pet nannies. I know this because a listing for a full-time nanny for a four-year-old Lagotto Romagnolo in my Brooklyn neighborhood recently surfaced on my Instagram feed. The link led to the profile page for staffing agency\nHousehold Staffing\n, where I found multiple listings for pet nannies, both live-in and live-out.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 President Trump announced on Friday that he has picked lawyer and former Federal Reserve official Kevin Warsh to be the next chairman of the central bank, according to the\nNew York Times\n. If confirmed, Warsh would succeed Jerome Powell, who has faced attacks from Trump over his reluctance to cut interest rates more aggressively. Powell\u2019s term as chair ends in May.\n\u2014 Mayor Zohran Mamdani has called an AI chatbot released by the Adams administration \u201cfunctionally unusable,\u201d\nreports\nThe City. The software was intended to provide business owners with information about city rules and other pertinent information. Previous reporting found the chatbot giving erroneous information that could have caused businesses to make illegal decisions. Now, Mamdani says his administration is axing the program as part of cost-cutting.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$9.9 million\nfor 211 West 84th Street, 5C. The Upper West Side condo at The Henry is 3,400 square feet of new construction.\nCompass\u2019\nAlexa Lambert, Alison Black and Elizabeth Goss have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$17.7 million\nfor 35-25 Steinway Street. The Astoria building has three units and is 18,400 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $23.9 million for 116 East 70th Street. The Lenox Hill townhome is 5,700 square feet.\nSloane Square\u2019s\nVicki Warner has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 27,242-square-foot, eight-story, 10-family, mixed-use building at 717 Myrtle Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Nikolai Katz Architect is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "Sometimes when the lights come on at the club, you finally see just who you were dancing with.\nThat\u2019s how unsecured creditors of bankrupt nightclub Brooklyn Mirage might be feeling. The group pulled its support for a bankruptcy plan that would have\nsold the venue\nto Axar Capital Management LLC after finding out the debt fund had struck a deal with a third party. The withdrawal was first reported by\nBloomberg Law\n.\nThe unsecured creditors appear to have first heard about the deal in the pages of BKMAG, which\nreported\non New Year\u2019s Day that Axar was expecting to enter a deal with global nightlife brand Pacha and its parent FIVE to sell the Mirage and turn it into Pacha New York. BKMAG attributed the information to an anonymous industry source.\nThe about-face by creditors is the latest twist in a saga that seemed to finally be coming to an end. The popular venue Brooklyn Mirage, owned by the company Avant Gardner, began undergoing a comprehensive renovation in 2024. It sold a season of tickets for the following year and then canceled every show. The debacle ultimately ended in Avant Gardner\u2019s parent company filing for bankruptcy last August, reporting $153.3 million in funded debt obligations.\nAn Axar affiliate won court approval in October to buy the Mirage stage and other assets from Avant Gardner in a $110 million credit bid, according to Bloomberg Law. Creditors would get a payout if Axar was able to reach a certain monetary threshold.\nAxar, meanwhile, allegedly negotiated the deal with Pacha\u2019s parent in the dark, away from the eyes of creditors and the court.\nAfter learning of\nthe plans in the news\n, the creditors approached Axar\u2019s counsel, who allegedly said the reports were incorrect, although discussions were allegedly ongoing. Then, on January 12, the creditors\u2019 attorney was allegedly told the deal was all but done.\nThe creditors will not sign off on any plan that permits the \u201ctrickery Axar has attempted,\u201d they wrote to the court. The deal \u201cdestroys the value\u201d of parts of the plan and Axar hasn\u2019t permitted the terms of the deal to be shared with the Delaware bankruptcy court or with the Mirage parent\u2019s board of directors.\nThe affiliate\u2019s deal with Pacha and its parent FIVE includes a purchase option that, if exercised, would wipe out a potential payout to the unsecured creditors. The creditors include vendors and artists who worked with the club.\nAxar has asked the court to determine that the creditors are unreasonably withholding their support. Axar is pursuing the demolition and rebuilding of the Mirage, but needs a partner to finance the process as well as $2 million in monthly costs for the closed stages.\nThe creditors can\u2019t turn around and fight a plan they once endorsed just because their assumption that they would get a payout turned out to be false, Axar argued to the court.\n\u201c[N]o party submitted a proposal valuing the enterprise higher than the offer from the venue management firm,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cThis is the unfortunate reality all of the parties have to live with.\u201d\nAxar did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Avant Gardner complex that included the Mirage was one of the largest clubs in New York, at 80,000 square feet. The Mirage opened in East Williamsburg in 2017 and became a popular venue for electronic music, despite fights with the state liquor license authority and community board.\nIn 2024, the company brought on new CEO Josh Wyatt to manage a revamp of the Mirage stage. The club closed for what was supposed to be a massive renovation. But just before it was supposed to open for a full summer of shows, the city\u2019s buildings department yanked its permit.\nAlthough Mirage owners said the venue was show-ready, the buildings commissioner told Brooklyn Paper the revamp was \u201ccombustible\u201d and \u201cillegal.\u201d As shows were canceled, 90,000 ticketholders were left at least temporarily in the lurch. Wyatt was fired in May of 2025, and Avant Gardner filed for bankruptcy three months later.\nA confirmation hearing for the bankruptcy plan is currently scheduled for February 12.\n",

        "content": "IMC Equity Group bought a Princeton apartment complex for nearly 24 percent less than its sale price four years ago, as the investment firm capitalizes on distress in South Florida.\nNorth Miami-based IMC Equity, led by Yoram Izhak, bought the 204-unit garden-style Pine Groves at 24101 South Dixie Highway in unincorporated Miami-Dade County from an entity led by Elliot Kazarnovsky of Toronto-based Marlin Spring Developments, according to records.\nIMC Equity borrowed a $27.8 million loan from Wells Fargo for the purchase and property.\nCompleted in 2020, Pine Groves consists of four three-story buildings and a clubhouse on a nearly 6-acre lot, property records show. It has one- and two-bedroom units, with monthly rents ranging from $1,635 to $1,925.\nThe Kazarnovsky-led entity, which is in the care of Marlin Spring US Realty, bought Pine Groves from the developer in 2021 for $44 million.\nThe discounted sale comes amid higher interest rates, increases in other costs and a slower South Florida multifamily market compared with the pandemic-induced boom.\nThe elevated rates have translated to higher debt obligations for landlords with floating-rate loans and more expensive refinancing for those with maturing loans. At the same time, South Florida has experienced skyrocketing insurance premiums and stabilizing though still-high costs for labor and materials.\nMeanwhile, demand for rentals has cooled. After South Florida became a magnet for out-of-staters, creating unprecedented apartment demand and record rent growth, developers rushed to build multifamily. They completed a record 18,600 units last year, outpacing net leasing, just as the influx of residents slowed, prompting a decrease in rents and an increase in concessions.\nSome multifamily properties have traded at a discount. In September, Waterton Residential sold the 427-unit District West Gables complex at 2001 and 2101 Ludlam Road/Southwest 67th Avenue in West Miami for $111 million, a\n4.7 percent\ndiscount from what it had paid nearly a decade ago.\nIMC Equity is among the firms seizing on the distress playing out in multifamily and other property types. It bought the 515,000-square-foot Sawgrass Technology Park in Sunrise for\n$49 million\nin 2024, marking a 34 percent discount from its 2019 price.\u00a0It also bagged the Miracle Marketplace at 3301 Coral Way in Miami in 2024 for\n$62 million\n, or 32.6 percent less than the retail center\u2019s price over a decade prior.\n",

        "content": "Embattled South Side home flipper Chris Urban clapped back against the storm of foreclosures surrounding dozens of his properties in legal filings this month, as more lenders took him to court over unpaid debts.\nUrban and his sister, Aneta Urban, have been named in a\ngrowing number of foreclosures\nand lawsuits related to a portfolio of dozens of properties across Chicago\u2019s South Side and south suburbs that started to buckle under the weight of unpaid debts in 2024. The pair borrowed money from fellow investors in a real estate training program run by Andrew Holmes, who is\nalso suing them for fraud\n.\nIn filings across several lawsuits in January, the Urbans argued their lenders failed to credit payments received, either directly or indirectly, to reduce the amount the Urbans owed the lenders. The filings argue the amount the Urbans owe should be offset by any money the lenders received from selling any collateral or other payments from the Urbans.\nAlthough the Urbans didn\u2019t provide proof of payments to the lenders, they denied the amount that the lenders claim is owed and demanded \u201cstrict proof\u201d of the accounting in the filings.\nThe argument reflects the precarious financing of the Urbans\u2019 portfolio. As financial troubles mounted in 2024 and 2025, Chris Urban used short sales to give lenders partial payments while using other properties as collateral for unpaid debts,\nThe Real Deal previously reported\n. In other cases, Urban would sell a home from one LLC to another he operates, satisfying one mortgage while taking out another for the purchase, property records show.\nThe defense comes as the Urbans are facing foreclosures on more than 80 properties between lender Renovo Financial and a handful of private lenders, amounting to millions in debt. While some lawsuits from early last year have been resolved, foreclosure suits continued to pile up late last year.\nMeanwhile, business loan company OnDeck Capital brought a third lawsuit for unpaid debt against one of Urban\u2019s LLCs in November. American Express also filed a lawsuit against the same LLC, and a separate one against Chris Urban personally, alleging he defaulted on debt, in January.\nChris Urban declined to comment, saying he would resolve the disputes \u201cthrough the courts, not the media.\u201d\nNew foreclosure\nSince mid-October, lenders have brought two more lawsuits against the Urbans for alleged unpaid debts. In both cases, the Urbans filed the same defenses, arguing the lenders did not credit any repayment they had received to the loan balance.\nIn October, Shirley Pollock, through her LLC Best Funding Solutions, filed to foreclose on five properties in Chicago and Calumet Park where she loaned the Urbans money. Pollock\u2019s lawsuit claims the combined unpaid debt, including late fees, amounts to more than $1 million across the five properties.\nAt three of those homes, the Urbans took out second mortgages between $50,000 and $65,000 with two other lenders \u2014 Homes by MB and Misener Wealth Builder \u2014 that are also named as defendants.\nIt\u2019s the second foreclosure suit from Pollock, following a lawsuit earlier that same month alleging unpaid debts of almost $500,000 across three properties.\nShe is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit brought by Holmes and his business partner, Mary DeSloover, alleging fraud. That\nlawsuit argues Pollock aided\nthe Urbans in covering up their financial pitfalls as they took on more debt from other investors. Pollock has denied the charge and said she is also a victim of the Urbans in legal filings.\nPollock did not respond to a request for comment.\nOlmos Private Equity\nAnother lender, Edmund Olmos, is also moving to seize two of Chris Urban\u2019s properties through foreclosure.\nThrough his LLC, Olmos Private Equity, Olmos issued Urban a $150,000 mortgage for a home on Burley Avenue and $236,000 for a home on 88th street in 2023 and 2024. The lawsuit alleges Urban failed to pay back the loans when they matured, and the balance has grown to more than $468,000.\nUrban took out a second mortgage at both those properties, records show. Olmos issued mortgages to the Urbans on more than a dozen properties between 2023 and 2024, often as second mortgages, property records show.\nMitchell Lieberman, an attorney for Olmos Private Equity and other investors foreclosing on the Urbans\u2019 properties, did not respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Rumors have been swirling for months in San Francisco, with C-suite executives, broker agents and private equity managers speculating that Michael Shvo might soon be out from the Transamerica Pyramid, the emblematic piece of city skyline that is now firmly linked to the brash developer\u2019s persona.\nThe San Francisco Standard and the San Francisco Chronicle each published stories attempting to drill down on the rumors, and both reported growing discontent with Shvo and his eponymous development company, SHVO, among the institutional German investors who have financed the acquisition and renovations that returned the pyramid to its premiere status.\nThe outlets say Bayerische Versorgungskammer (BVK), Germany\u2019s largest public pension group, and investment firm Deutsche Finance Group, have moved to oust Shvo as the asset manager, citing waning confidence against the backdrop of a series of recent issues involving Shvo, including his\ndramatic exit from the Raleigh Hotel development\nin Miami Beach, defaulting on a $200 million loan that led to the sale-in-lieu-of-foreclosure\nat the Mandarin Oriental in Beverly Hills\n, and\nan ongoing lawsuit with Core Club\n. In November, the Core Club filed a lawsuit against Shvo\naccusing him of being engaged in a yearslong\nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) conspiracy.\nBVK has reportedly faced pressure from its members to clean up its U.S. strategy after the fund apparently lost more $1 billion on its American investments, some of which involve Shvo. Deutsche Finance Group told the Chronicle that BVK was \u201ccurrently reviewing the appointment of a new operating asset manager for the U.S. real estate portfolio as part of a structured selection process.\u201d However, the group did not specify that this involved Shvo.\nA spokesperson for SHVO has rejected the reporting as \u201cfalse.\u201d Last week, SHVO announced three new leases at the Transamerica Pyramid. One of the leases, for 4,000 square feet, went for more than $300 per square foot, according to the announcement,\nwhich allegedly set a West Coast record for office space\n. The new contracts put the Transamerica Pyramid at 85 percent leased.\nOf note: Shvo has tapped Goldin Solutions, a PR firm that, among other things, specializes in crisis communications. Goldin Solutions has managed the media strategy for the likes of WeWork founder Adam Neumann, Gawker Media during the Hulk Hogan trial, a branch of the Sackler family amidst the opioid crisis, and former Today Show host Billy Bush following fallout from then-presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s Access Hollywood tapes.\nCould California get another governor with mayoral experience?\nMatt Mahan, the first-term mayor of San Jose, has thrown his hat into an already crowded but uninspiring field for California governor.\nMahan, 43, is a Harvard graduate who got his start as a tech entrepreneur before waging a successful campaign for San Jose City Council in 2020. Mid-way through his first term, he jumped into the mayor\u2019s race and edged out political veteran Cindy Chavez for the seat. He now looks to continue his streak of first-term political promotions.\nIn a state with a wide left-of-center political spectrum, Mahan has fashioned himself as a moderate and pragmatist, cut in a similar shape as San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie. Mahan has hyperfocused on housing, homelessness, and crime during his three years at the helm.\nHe sponsored a change to the city\u2019s camping ordinance that allowed police to arrest and charge unhoused who camp on public property and repeatedly refuse shelter. Under Mahan, San Jose was the first city to opt-in to a state law that allowed homeowners to sell accessory dwelling units at condos, and this week the San Jose City Council unanimously approved a series of changes that lower affordability thresholds on developers and clear expensive bureaucratic hurdles to convert empty downtown offices buildings into housing. He racked up potential campaign talking points on public-safety as the most prominent Democrat to take on Gov. Gavin Newsom in campaigning for 2024\u2019s Prop 36, which sought to employ harsher penalties for crimes of desperation, such as drug offenses and theft. Nearly 70 percent of voters supported the measure. He has supported adding officers to the San Jose Police Department.\nMahan also made a splash last summer when he called out Newsom\u2019s high-profile communications strategy of mirroring Trump\u2019s rambling, petulant and often petty approach to social media.\n\u201cMaintaining our success requires a relentless focus on the facts in the real world, not a blind leap into meme land,\u201d Mahan wrote in an\nAugust op-ed for the San Francisco Standard\n.\nThe mayor\u2019s entrance into the race has already earned a ringing endorsement from one of the state\u2019s most powerful developers, Rick Caruso.\nCaruso wrote on X\nthat he \u201cencouraged\u201d Mahan to run, \u201cand I\u2019m delighted he is entering the race.\u201d\nMany believe Mahan\u2019s campaign will benefit from his ties to the tech community, for which San Jose has remained at the center of gravity. Shortly after Mahan\u2019s announcement, Garry Tan, president and CEO of the \u00fcberinfluential Silicon Valley tech accelerator Y Combinator, posted on X that the\nSan Jose mayor was \u201cthe real deal.\u201d\n\u201cCalifornia desperately needs this. Not more vibes. Not more trolling. RESULTS,\u201d Tan wrote.\nMahan enters a race that includes Rep. Eric Swalwell, former gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter, former state attorney general and U.S. health and human services secretary Xavier Beccera, billionaire entrepreneur Tom Steyer, and former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, among others.\n",

        "content": "The Alexander brothers\u2019 sex trafficking trial began last week in a Manhattan courtroom.\nThe proceedings may be more than 1,200 miles away from Miami, but the city looms large in the case.\nAnd, in the days leading up to the trial, a Miami woman alleged in a\nnew lawsuit\nthat in 2016 she was raped by Oren and Alon \u201csimultaneously,\u201d with the brothers switching off who was filming on a cell phone. The woman, Tiffany Rodriguez, also names the nightclub, Basement at the Edition Miami Beach; the brothers\u2019 parents, Orly and Shlomy; the family\u2019s security firm, Kent Security; Oren\u2019s longtime brokerage, Douglas Elliman; and the firm\u2019s former chairman and CEO, Howard Lorber, as defendants.\nThe brothers have denied all allegations and pleaded not guilty to the federal charges.\nThe federal trial began a day late because of the winter storm that brought more than a foot of snow to New York.\nAlon\u2019s attorney Howard Srebnick, the only Miami lawyer involved in the federal case, walked into the courthouse with two coconut waters in his backpack. The brothers\u2019 parents, Orly and Shlomy, attended the trial each day, as did Shani Alexander, Alon\u2019s wife. Kamila Hansen Alexander, Oren\u2019s wife, showed up on Thursday in a long fur coat.\nThe brothers, who face a minimum of 15 years in prison if convicted, could be seen scanning the courtroom throughout the week. Oren and Alon whispered to their attorneys during cross-examination, likely guiding their lawyers\u2019 questions. Family members spoke Hebrew to each other, and were warned by the court officers to not speak or whisper.\nThe brothers\u2019 attorney said that the Alexanders were \u201csingle men who liked and pursued women.\u201d Oren\u2019s lawyer, Teny Geragos, described them as \u201carrogant.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not trafficking. That\u2019s dating,\u201d she said.\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are working to paint a picture of the brothers enticing women with promises of luxury travel, only to then allegedly drug and rape them.\n\u201cThe brothers used whatever means necessary. Sometimes drugs, sometimes alcohol, sometimes brute force to carry out their rapes. Some of their victims were underage. Some said no. Some were incoherent,\u201d said Assistant U.S. Attorney Madison Smyser in her opening remarks. \u201cFor over a decade, these three brothers, the defendants, masqueraded as party boys, when really they were predators.\u201d\nTwo women testified last week using pseudonyms: Katie Moore, who alleged that Alon raped her in 2012 after meeting him at Zac Efron\u2019s apartment for an NBA championship watch party, and Maya Miller, who alleged that Tal raped her in the Hamptons one weekend in 2014. [Read Moore\u2019s account\nhere\nand Miller\u2019s\nhere\n.]\nIn the two years after Miller\u2019s alleged rape, she and a friend stayed at the homes of people in Tal\u2019s orbit, said Milton Williams, Tal\u2019s attorney. That included the homes of Max Leifer and Jim Ferraro. Ferraro, a prominent mesothelioma attorney based in Miami, gave Oren his big break when he hired him to represent him in the $8.2 million sale of his Park Imperial penthouse in the summer of 2009. Ferraro also briefly represented Oren and Alon in the initial two civil lawsuits alleging rape.\nThe prosecution also called friends of the women to the stand, as well as an FBI agent and a New York Police Department detective involved in the case.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill other owners at Five Park join a penthouse buyer who recently\nsued the developers\nof the Miami Beach tower? A trust is alleging that luxury short-term guest suites were promised to unit owners in marketing materials, but that the developers are now offering them for sale.

        "content": "Fannie Mae says it is seeing fewer cases of multifamily mortgage fraud following a years-long crackdown, a finding that surprised some market watchers who say misconduct may be shifting elsewhere rather than disappearing.\nThe government-supported mortgage giant reported that tips and investigations into multifamily fraud have fallen to 12-month lows, according to a partially redacted analysis published by its regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\nThe decline follows a sharp surge in reported activity just a year earlier. Fannie said it received a flood of tips related to multifamily mortgage fraud in 2024, prompting 193 investigations, up from 14 in 2022. The agency confirmed fraud in 87 cases last year, compared with just three two years earlier.\nFannie said those numbers are now trending down, noting it did not find any potential fraud in its sample of 44 high-risk loans between September 2024 and January 2025. As of July 2025, multifamily mortgage fraud tips and investigations at Fannie were at their lowest levels in a year.\nThe findings were part of an analysis by the FHFA, that examined Fannie\u2019s allowance for loan losses, or the amount of money Fannie is setting aside to cover losses. Fannie, which does not originate loans but buys loans from private lenders, set aside\n$752 million in 2024\nto cover loan losses, citing mortgage fraud as a key factor.\nThe conclusions landed amid significant upheaval at the housing finance agencies. In 2025, FHFA Director Bill Pulte named himself chairman of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and removed 14 board members. Fannie\u2019s CEO departed abruptly later that year, and several senior executives in its multifamily division have since exited, including a\nformer deputy general counsel\ninvolved in overseeing fraud investigations.\nPrior to the FHFA report, there had been few indications that multifamily mortgage fraud was easing. Apartment owners continued to struggle in 2025 as higher interest rates strained cash flows, and lenders including Walker &amp; Dunlop and Merchants Bank of Indiana publicly disclosed fraud-related problems in earnings reports.\n\u201cThe report makes it sound like multifamily fraud largely disappeared \u2014 and was mostly an early-2020s issue but I don\u2019t think it simply went away,\u201d said Joseph Kahn of VisionRE, a real estate advisory firm. \u201cMore likely, tighter agency scrutiny pushed much of it into CMBS, and we\u2019re seeing the consequences as those loans sour.\u201d\nOthers echoed the sentiment. Christopher Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors, which consults and analyzes financial institutions, said \u201cFraud is a continuing problem for both enterprises [Fannie and Freddie]. I suspect it will go up in 2025-26.\u201d\nWhalen said neither Fannie nor Freddie should be involved in the multifamily space.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have the people or resources to underwrite the credit. Same goes for HUD. As multifamily assets sink further in quality, this becomes the new subprime asset class.\u201d\nAfter the Covid-19 pandemic, Fannie, Freddie Mac and the FHFA discovered an increasing amount of\nmortgage fraud\nwhere borrowers either\ninflated rent rolls\nor flipped properties to related parties. The goal was to secure loans larger than they otherwise would have received. The investigations have led to Fannie and Freddie blacklisting dozens of industry players, including title agencies, brokers, borrowers and attorneys along with guilty pleas and criminal charges.\nThe FHFA\u2019s report also revealed the findings of one of Fannie\u2019s first fraud investigations. In November 2023, Fannie suspended doing new business with an unnamed mortgage brokerage. Fannie reviewed 126 high-risk loans at the brokerage. It hired outside counsel and accountants and found seven loans with \u201cconfirmed signs of fraud,\u201d according to the FHFA report.\nWhile the brokerage was not identified, Meridian Capital was blacklisted by the agencies around the same time. Meridian was removed from the agency\u2019s blacklist in 2025. Meridian did not return a request to comment.\nFrom there, the agency received more tips about multifamily fraud, most submitted internally. Fannie said the majority of the tips led to investigations which were closed with \u201cno fraud found.\u201d\nBut Fannie reported a huge uptick in tips and investigations in 2024. The influx caused the agency to report the increase in mortgage fraud referrals as an emerging risk to Fannie Mae\u2019s board of directors.\nFannie said, as of late, investigations into mortgage fraud started to decline.\nFraud was not listed as a major factor in its allowance for multifamily loan losses in Fannie\u2019s most recent report with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nFannie has made internal changes to prevent mortgage fraud. It said it increased requirements for appraisals and hired more staff to review appraisals and property conditions.\nThe agency has also taken further action against certain lenders where mortgage fraud was discovered.\nFannie required three lenders to repurchase five loans. Fannie has kicked eight lenders off its preferential delegation, which means they have to pass more hurdles to originate Fannie loans.\n\u201cFannie Mae takes mortgage fraud very seriously and we hold accountable those who enable or participate in fraud schemes and other criminal activities,\u201d said Fannie in a statement.\n",

Anyone working in New York City real estate knows the outline of the project\u2019s\ntwo decades of problems\n: how a development once described as a \u201cGarden of Eden\u201d got bogged down by opposition, financial problems and politics. By late 2022, the developer was in default on $350 million in loans tied to the megadevelopment, and a year later the lender moved to foreclose on the site.\nIt was hard to imagine who\u2019d want to jump in and finish the job. Anyone replacing the developer, Greenland USA, a subsidiary of Shanghai-based Greenland Holdings, would have to lay out a new vision, get state approval, negotiate hefty fines and set new deadlines.\nBut Cirrus\u2019 executives\nsaw\na salvage operation, and they\npurchased the debt\n.\n\u201cWe thought it was a no-brainer,\u201d McDonnell said during a recent interview in Cirrus\u2019 Midtown office.\nCirrus, which McDonnell runs with Anthony Tufariello, seemed a less obvious choice to others.\nAs a company, Cirrus hasn\u2019t built anything from the ground up and lacks the name recognition of Related Companies, another firm that toyed with taking over Pacific Park. Still, the pair has overseen $150 billion in real estate finance transactions, $10 billion in real estate equity investments and more than 10,000 multifamily units.\nNow, by relying on deep industry connections and experience from a long list of projects, McDonnell and Tufariello have positioned their firm as a backer of major projects that could deliver New York City thousands of affordable housing units after decades of delay, not just a quiet provider of rescue capital.\nAt Pacific Park, Cirrus brought on an experienced multifamily developer, LCOR, which oversees a portfolio of 10,000 residential units across the U.S. Then, the city tapped the two firms to build 3,000 housing units\nat a defunct airport in Flushing, Queens\n.\nAnother substantial project materialized in May 2025, when Cirrus formed a joint venture with Resorts World New York City to build up to 50,000 housing units across the five boroughs, a promise that sweetened the latter\u2019s bid to expand its slot parlor in Queens into a full-blown casino. In December, Resorts World\nclinched\none of three licenses awarded by the state.\nBut Cirrus\u2019 visibility wasn\u2019t quite as sudden as it seemed. The principals had gradually built a public profile. In March 2024, the company reached an agreement with Mayor Eric Adams and the Building and Construction Trades Council, signing a memorandum of understanding to raise money from the construction union pension funds to finance workforce housing throughout the city.\nInitially, $100 million was raised, but the fund is expected to cap out at $400 million, according to McDonnell.\nThe idea, which isn\u2019t unheard-of, is to invest in union-built, ground-up housing projects that are affordable to moderate-income residents. In other words, the workers whose pension funds are financing the construction can ultimately live in the buildings. All of Cirrus\u2019 proposed housing projects would be built this way.\nBut they are making their plans in a state with a raging debate about mandating union labor in housing production, especially affordable housing. Cirrus and the unions would like to prove that financing such projects with union pension funds is the solution, and one that can be scaled up to address the affordability crisis.\nThough Cirrus\u2019 proposed unit count is in the tens of thousands, success in these projects still doesn\u2019t guarantee that other developers, on other kinds of projects, would flock to the model.\n\u201cThis is proof of concept,\u201d Gary LaBarbera, head of the city and state chapters of the Building and Construction Trades Council, said.\nOf course, it\u2019s only proof if it\u2019s built.\nO\nrigin story\nBefore joining forces, McDonnell and Tufariello were rivals.\nAfter the 2008 financial crisis, the two competed for restructuring and rescue-capital deals \u2014 McDonnell at BlueMountain Capital and Tufariello at Fortress Investment Group.\nThe pair decided to leave their larger firms at about the same time, in 2017, and learned from industry scuttlebutt about each other\u2019s departure. They began working together informally and eventually registered as an investment advisor in January 2020. The timing was not ideal.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I would start a business just before Covid again,\u201d McDonnell said.\nWithout being able to travel and network, the pair leaned on investor relationships they\u2019d built over the course of their careers, even as other firms struggled to raise capital.\nTufariello, who has a home in Boca Raton, toured properties in Florida.\n\u201cHow fast can this approach be ramped up to meet the demand?\u201d\nLou Coletti, former president of the  Building Trades Employers\u2019 Association\nEarly deals included providing a $90 million inventory loan to the developers of the Zaha Hadid-designed One Thousand Museum condo tower in Miami. The team, led by Louis Birdman, Kevin Venger, Gregg Covin, Gilberto Bomeny and Todd Michael Glaser, were fending off foreclosure. An entity tied to Reuben Brothers had bought out Fortress\u2019 stake in the property in February 2021 and soon after filed a lawsuit to foreclose on the remaining 15 unsold condo units. The developers paid off the inventory loan that December.\nCirrus worked with the developers on two more deals, providing financing for development sites in Edgewater in Florida.\n\u201cWhenever we\u2019re taking down land, initially, they always have first look because they are just easy to deal with, very reasonable guys, who know the market well,\u201d Kevin Venger, co-founder of One Thousand Group, said.\nAt the beginning, McDonnell and Tufariello grew their credit business in New York, Miami, Los Angeles and San Francisco, with some work in Chicago and Washington, D.C. They recently created a joint venue to issue construction loans, though McDonnell wouldn\u2019t name the firm\u2019s partner on that.\nSince branching out to become developers, they have focused on New York, with plans to invest in Philadelphia, Boston and New Jersey. They say they\u2019ll announce a solo ground-up project in the coming months. Everything else is with partners.\nFor now, the firm works out of a temporary space on the sixth floor of Savanna\u2019s 106 West 56th Street; it bought a note secured by the office building in November 2023. On a January morning, employees filled cubicles in six-desk rows, though the space had the feeling of not being fully set up, with computer monitors propped up against empty bright white walls.\nThe principals named the company after cirrus clouds, the wisps that form at very high altitudes. McDonnell evoked the lofty feeling, leaning on the word \u201celevate\u201d when discussing the firm\u2019s interactions with investors, partners and residents.\nHe also takes the name literally.\n\u201cWhen you look at where Cirrus invests generally, it tends to be really only the top four or five markets in the U.S., where buildings tend to be taller,\u201d McDonnell said.\nT\nhe union connect\nThe deal to build with union labor and pension funds came together with the help of Kevin Gallagher, who\u2019d known LaBarbera for 20 years and introduced him to McDonnell and Tufariello.\nGallagher, a veteran of both the union and workforce housing scenes, then joined Cirrus in 2024 as head of origination and structuring for Cirrus\u2019 workforce housing fund.\nIn 2006, as director of housing for the New York City Central Labor Council of the AFL-CIO, he helped lead the union\u2019s charge to raise $4 billion to bid on Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, an effort that failed when Tishman Speyer agreed to pay $5.4 billion for the complex.\nHe later made a similar play for Starrett City with former associates, with whom he is locked in a bitter legal fight.\nIn 2015, he sued John Crotty, John Warren and John Fitzgerald, accusing them of closing him out of a lucrative partnership between their company, Workforce Housing Advisors, and JPMorgan. The trio, which now runs a separate company called Workforce Housing Group, argue that they worked with Gallagher through limited partnerships tied to individual projects, not as a formal company. According to their responses to the lawsuit, the agreement didn\u2019t prevent them from pursuing opportunities without Gallagher, whom their attorney describes in court filings as \u201cgreedy.\u201d\n\u201cKevin has demonstrated a total disregard for affordable housing in his actions with us,\u201d Crotty said in an interview. \u201cHim presenting himself as an affordable-housing person to the people of Brooklyn is laugh-out-loud funny.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Cirrus declined to comment on the litigation but said Kevin was proud of his work on Stuyvesant Town and Starrett City, which he believed brought more attention to affordable housing: \u201cHe is overjoyed that today\u2019s political landscape has finally caught up with those priorities.\u201d\nLitigation aside, Gallagher\u2019s model at Cirrus has some elements of his earlier workforce housing ventures. Then, he targeted overleveraged multifamily buildings, bought up the notes on underperforming loans and, in cases where the owner couldn\u2019t pay up, foreclosed and submitted a credit bid to take control of the property. Partners would then secure permanent financing, with the goal of \u201cmoving properties out of the cycle of bad investment into responsible, long-term ownership,\u201d according to an investor deck for one of the previous company\u2019s funds, which was filed with court documents.\nThough Cirrus still buys overleveraged loans and takes over properties, McDonnell said he doesn\u2019t consider Cirrus to be in the business of \u201cdistressed debt,\u201d and that the company prefers to work out solutions for borrowers. This has resulted in repeat customers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re brought into these situations, usually when it\u2019s very strong real estate, but it\u2019s a complex situation,\u201d he said.\nW\norkforce housing for NYC\nNew York City has many housing initiatives but few for the \u201cmissing middle,\u201d Cirrus\u2019 audience.\nCirrus\u2019 plan to finance and build these units made sense to LaBarbera, who met with the Cirrus executives.\nAbout the same time, LaBarbera was talking with Mayor Adams, he recalled. \u201cWe got to a point where [Adams] loved the concept. I said to him, \u2018Look, give us a year.\u2019\u201d\nThey got individual union pension funds on board and raised the initial $100 million. The mayor traveled to the buildings trades\u2019 conference in Florida to sign the MOU. Since then, they have pooled pension funds from more than a dozen construction unions.\nThe fund will take equity positions in Pacific Park, as well as\nat the Flushing airport site\n. Some have questioned whether the deal with the city gave Cirrus an edge in the competition for the latter site. Cirrus and LCOR were one of seven teams that bid on the project, according to a response provided to The Real Deal following a freedom of information request. Cirrus\u2019 proposal called for more housing units than most of the other proposals. One team pitched constructing a cement alternative factory on the site.\nStill, Andrew Esposito of Apex Development, one of the bidders, said that \u201cgiven the challenges presented at the site, \u2026 we query how the selected group with a glaringly absent track record of completing development projects will address these real issues, while also incorporating promises of extensive union involvement.\u201d\nUnions have struggled to increase their market share of affordable housing projects in New York City, and attempts to legislate such growth have been met with resistance from developers. For example, the property break 485x sets a construction wage floor for all projects with 100 or more units, and even higher for projects above 150. Developers have avoided these mandates by capping units at 99.\nIt remains to be seen what level of public subsidy these projects will require, even with the union pension fund investments. Cirrus is seeking the property tax break 485x at the airport site, and McDonnell has said that the final housing plan for Pacific Park will rely on what city and state subsidies are available.\nLaBarbera, however, believes that the city signing on to the model indicates that projects will pencil out.\n\u201cThere was always this position of the real estate industry that this couldn\u2019t be done, that you can\u2019t build residential, affordable, workforce housing under a union model,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have just disproved that.\u201d\nB\nehind the scenes\u00a0at Pacific Park\nGreenland USA\u2019s lender on the Pacific Park sites was Nick Mastroianni\u2019s U.S. Immigration Fund, which had raised capital through the cash-for-visas EB-5 program.\nCirrus then took over $200 million in Greenland\u2019s outstanding debt across the U.S., and was in a position to also take on the more than\n$350 million\nattached to six sites at Pacific Park, which USIF had provided; Fortress also owned a stake in the debt.\n\u201cThat was a very difficult and challenging deal to do,\u201d Mastroianni said. \u201cI\u2019d been negotiating with Greenland for five years, I couldn\u2019t get them to move.\u201d\nIn early 2025, Mastroianni and McDonnell got lunch at Cipriani\u2019s on Fifth Avenue.\nThey disagree on who asked whom but align on the subject of the meeting: what to do about Pacific Park.\n\u201cI said, listen you\u2019re willing,\nlet\u2019s put it together\n,\u201d Mastroianni recalled.\nThe two had previously worked together at The Bryant, HFZ Capital Group\u2019s luxury condo hotel on West 40th Street, which Cirrus recapitalized, providing a loan to USIF, after HFZ collapsed.\nCirrus\u2019 principals had previous run-ins with the defunct real estate firm. Through the Versant Group, Tufariello invested in commercial lender Allegiant Capital in 2017, alongside HFZ executives Ziel Feldman and Nir Meir. An October filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission lists Tufariello as a chair of the company, as well as an indirect owner alongside Feldman and Meir. Both Feldman and Meir have previously claimed to own significant stakes in Versant, according to court filings.\nRepresentatives for Cirrus said the filing was an error and that Tufariello hasn\u2019t been involved with Allegiant since 2019. They indicated that Tufariello didn\u2019t have a relationship with HFZ.\nMastroianni credits Cirrus\u2019 purchase of most of Greenland\u2019s debt for moving the megadevelopment forward. Related Companies was in talks for the project in 2024, but ultimately decided against sticking around.\nCirrus\u2019 ability to absorb the rail yard sites, as well as a separate property across from the Barclays Center, likely played in its favor. At the very least, the fact that the company could incorporate the site into its broader plans strengthened its pitch to state officials, who needed to approve the development team replacing Greenland.\nCirrus and LCOR officially took over the train sites in October, through a foreclosure auction and with the blessing of Empire State Development and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.\nAnthony Tortora, co-chief investment officer at LCOR, said he was introduced to the Cirrus leaders through a mutual friend at Plaza Construction. The skill sets of the two companies complemented each other, he said. Cirrus brought extensive capital markets experience and a good relationship with the unions to the table, while LCOR had a history in multifamily development, as well as its work at another rail yard in Hoboken, New Jersey.\nThe companies also shared a commitment to building workforce housing.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of alignment in terms of how we think about the world,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere was always this position of the real estate industry that this couldn\u2019t be done, that you can\u2019t build residential,  affordable, workforce housing under a union model. We have just disproved that.\u201d\nGary LaBarbera on hopes for Cirrus\u2019 union-pension-funded development model\nPacific Park, originally called Atlantic Yards, was first announced in 2003, and has since been held up by various forces, including litigation, construction defects, the departure of developers and in the case of Greenland, the financial woes of its parent company in China.\nOver the past two decades, nine buildings (including the Barclays Center) have been completed, with more than 3,200 apartments built by Forest City Ratner, Greenland USA and other developers who, over the years, have taken over individual sites.\nCirrus and LCOR have pitched what they\u2019ve called \u201ccontours of a plan\u201d for the remaining sites. This vision would result in taller towers than previously planned and would ultimately net 9,000 units instead of 6,430.\nMcDonnell is the most public-facing of the Cirrus executives. Soft-spoken and measured at public meetings, he has described the vision he and his partners have devised so far as what is \u201cfeasible\u201d but not final.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to bring a very realistic and transparent approach to this,\u201d he said.\nHe also has emphasized the \u201cmission-driven\u201d nature of the workforce housing fund, and that Cirrus\u2019 plan is guided by wanting to build as much housing as quickly as possible, and to make it affordable to a range of incomes. For that reason, Cirrus and LCOR are considering not building on one of the six rail yard sites and instead shifting density there to the other planned towers.\nThe affordable units would target moderate to middle-income residents, capping rent at levels affordable to those earning 130 percent of the area median income.\nThat threshold has already drawn criticism from advocates who have long followed the project, arguing that more units need to be accessible to very low-income earners.\nF\nuture looking\nA number of the company\u2019s projects are in transition. In December, Cirrus won a bankruptcy auction for a Miami redevelopment site with a $77 million credit bid. The company had moved to foreclose after the developer Gilberto Bomeny defaulted on a $70 million loan tied to the property. A judge, however, ordered a new auction, in which Cirrus ultimately won with a $95 million bid. Cirrus\u2019 plans for the site are unclear.\nA judge, however, ordered a new auction, finding that \u201cconstant changes and irregularities\u201d prevented other bidders from competing. Cirrus\u2019 plans for the site, should they ultimately hold onto it, are unclear.\nIn New York, the board charged with reviewing applications for state casino licenses urged gaming officials to closely track all commitments made by the three winning teams \u2014 including the housing pledge made by Resorts World, which it described as vague. McDonnell said no sites have been selected yet as part of its partnership with Resorts World.\nAt Pacific Park, Cirrus and LCOR must ink a memorandum of understanding outlining the project by July 31, 2026. Otherwise, the state could renew fines against the firm that were supposed to kick in in June 2025, a previous deadline for completing the project\u2019s affordable housing units that Greenland failed to meet.\nIt\u2019s been nearly two years since the agreement was reached with the city and the construction unions, and Cirrus also must work with a new administration. Mayor Zohran Mamdani has said that he wants to build 200,000 affordable housing units in the next decade, exclusively with union labor. He hasn\u2019t specified how he is going to do that nor if he\u2019s planning to lean on the model employed by Cirrus. (Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, by contrast, cited Cirrus by name in his housing plan.)\nMcDonnell sees a potential champion in Leila Bozorg, deputy mayor of housing and planning, who formerly served in the Adams administration and was involved in the agreement with the union pension funds.\nIn an interview, she said she is committed to work with the building trades to develop more workforce housing models and is working with the city and state comptrollers to explore other pension fund investments into housing.\nLou Coletti, a senior advisor with government relations firm Davidoff, Hutcher &amp; Citron and former president of the Building Trades Employers\u2019 Association, which represents general contractors, said the model could be difficult to replicate on a grand scale, given that the individual board of trustees for each pension fund has to sign off on investing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite a lengthy process,\u201d he said. \u201cHow fast can this approach be ramped up to meet the demand?\u201d",

        "content": "Protesters waving signs reading \u201cFreeze the Rent\u201d and \u201cREBNY Raised My Rent\u201d stationed themselves on the sidewalk outside the Glasshouse, a Hell\u2019s Kitchen venue where the Real Estate Board of New York was hosting its annual gala last year.\nAmong the tenants and activists gathered outside the event, nicknamed the \u201cLiar\u2019s Ball,\u201d was Zohran Mamdani, then a New York assemblymember and mayoral hopeful. He\u2019d just announced his candidacy three months prior, and though his winning was seen by most as a longshot, Mamdani\u2019s campaign fundraising efforts had already started to outpace some of his opponents.\nOne of the pillars of his platform was a vow to halt rent hikes for tenants of rent-stabilized properties \u2014 a pledge he repeated loudly and proudly that didn\u2019t win him any favors with the city\u2019s real estate players, many of whom were looking down on the protests from six floors above.\nFast forward a year,\nand Mamdani is now the 112th mayor of New York City, much to the chagrin of many in the industry, who shelled out millions in an effort to thwart his victory and keep his Democratic socialist ideologies out of Gracie Mansion. After four years of a relative reprieve under Mayor Eric Adams, it seemed real estate would be back as the city government\u2019s ghouls.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not demonize real estate,\u201d David Schechtman of Meridian Investment Sales said at the 2026 edition of the REBNY gala, at the Waldorf Astoria. \u201cFor many years, we\u2019ve held up this city.\u201d\nDespite its opposition to Mamdani, after the general election, it seemed the mayor \u2014 who had already admitted he\u2019d changed his mind about the role of private developers in solving the city\u2019s housing crisis \u2014 was prepared to at least listen to industry stakeholders.\nShortly after his win, Mamdani held closed-door meetings with developers, lenders and investors including Tishman Speyer CEO Rob Speyer, Two Trees CEO and REBNY chair Jed Walentas and Nadeem Meghji, global co-head of real estate at Blackstone, among others, where he assured them that his administration would be open to hearing their concerns.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for the politicians to embrace the real estate industry. We pay the bills.\u201d\nJames Wacht, Lee &amp; Associates\nThen he made a series of appointments that appeared relatively promising. He tapped Leila Bozorg as the deputy mayor of housing and planning. Bozorg previously served as Adams\u2019 executive director of housing and has been credited as a key figure in passing the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity legislation, which many in the industry heralded as a significant step toward increasing development.\nHe also added Ahmed Tigani, another Adams alumnus, to his administration as the Commissioner of the Department of Buildings.\nBut his first\nfew official actions\ndidn\u2019t signal cooperation, though he continues to hammer the idea that the private sector should play a role in new development. He tapped a longtime foe of landlords to oversee a tenant protection agency, then announced the city would host a series of hearings that set the stage for public landlord shaming sessions.\n\u201cIt absolutely smelled, looked and felt like a very meaningful signal shift,\u201d said Peter Hungerford, CEO of PH Realty Capital, which, along with its partners, has been one of the most active buyers of rent-stabilized buildings in recent years. He described several of Mamdani\u2019s first moves as \u201cmore confrontational and aggressive to owners.\u201d\nNow many in the industry are once again preparing to be cast as henchmen contributing to all of the city\u2019s ills.\n\u201cWithin just a few hours of the inauguration, [Mamdani] immediately maintained the position that current property owners are the bogeyman,\u201d Kenny Burgos, CEO of the New York Apartment Association, said. \u201cIt cannot be true that every single operator is suddenly a slumlord.\u201d\nHal Fetner, CEO of Fetner Properties, expressed uncertainty about the new mayoral administration, pointing to Mamdani\u2019s focus on relying on city government to improve housing affordability, rather than through partnership with the private sector.\n\u201cPolitics in the city right now, I would say, it\u2019s scary,\u201d Fetner said at the gala. \u201cIt\u2019s not about freezing the rents.\u201d\nO\nut of the gates\nOnce sworn into office, Mamdani hit the ground running.\nOn his first day as mayor, Mamdani signed an executive order reviving the city\u2019s dormant Office to Protect Tenants and appointing renter activist Cea Weaver as its director.\nThe choice to tap Weaver, viewed as an adversary by many in the landlord contingent, was a concerning one for many of the city\u2019s multifamily players. Weaver, previously the director of New York State Tenant Bloc and Housing Justice for All, played a central role in passing the 2019 rent laws, which owners of rent-stabilized properties credit for the distress plaguing their portfolios.\nThe scrutiny intensified days later when a few of her old tweets resurfaced in news articles, including one calling homeownership \u201ca weapon of white supremacy.\u201d (Weaver later backtracked on the sentiments expressed in her previous posts in an interview with NY1\u2019s Errol Louis, describing the language in the tweets as \u201cinelegant\u201d and \u201cregretful.\u201d )\nWeaver \u201cseems pretty committed to destroying property rights,\u201d Hungerford said.\nHungerford also criticized her previous comments advocating for more city-owned housing through the New York City Housing Authority, or NYCHA, which he called the \u201cabsolute poster child for New York City\u2019s worst landlord.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental disconnect between this administration right now and reality, and if that\u2019s who Mamdani is going to appoint and that\u2019s their belief, it\u2019s so far from realistic,\u201d Hungerford said.\nTwo days later, Mamdani and Weaver announced the city\u2019s intention to\nintervene\nin the legal battle over 5,000 rent-stabilized apartments owned by one of the city\u2019s largest landlords, Joel Weiner\u2019s Pinnacle Group \u2014 a portfolio which was then set to be auctioned off on Jan. 8. The administration attempted to pause the sale to the proposed buyer, Summit Properties, over concerns that the firm wouldn\u2019t be able to make the necessary repairs \u2014 a bid a bankruptcy judge ultimately rejected. Summit, which had agreed to pay roughly $450 million for the portfolio, was confirmed as the buyer a week later.\nThen came the \u201c\nRental Ripoff\n\u201d hearings announcement. On his first Monday at the helm of the city, Mamdani signed another executive order instituting the hearings aimed at allowing tenants to air their grievances with landlords in front of a group of city agencies including Weaver\u2019s. The order mandated that hearings in every borough be underway within Mamdani\u2019s first 100 days in office, with the goal of producing a report based on the content.\nThough the order mentioned landlords and property managers as potential speakers, as The Real Deal\u2019s Erik Engquist pointed out in a column, \u201cthat is kind of like inviting sheep to a gathering of wolves.\u201d The administration intends the hearings to be a place for renters and activists to share stories of \u201cillegal, unfair, abusive, deceptive, or unconscionable landlord practices\u201d \u2014 likely setting the stage for future policy decisions, such as freezing the rents for rent-stabilized properties, a goal Mamdani has been vocal about achieving (though, the authority to do so rests with the Rent Guidelines Board).\n\u201cA lot of this comes off as very theatrical and not policy-based,\u201d Burgos said. \u201cIt\u2019s simply a public display to build up support for his goal of a rent freeze come June. He knows the numbers won\u2019t support a rent freeze, so he needs to create the story arc.\u201d\nWhen Mamdani was a no-show at\nREBNY\u2019s January gala\n, real estate players took note.\n\u201cThe fact that our mayor is not going to be here tonight, I think, is wrong,\u201d James Wacht, founding partner and managing principal of Lee &amp; Associates, said at the gala. \u201dIt\u2019s important for the politicians to embrace the real estate industry. We pay the bills.\u201d\nThe Soloviev Group\u2019s Michael Hershman told\nTRD\nthe mayor\u2019s absence was a \u201cmissed opportunity.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the best interests of the real estate community and the mayor to be able to sit down and talk about what\u2019s best for the city, what\u2019s best for the people of the city,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we do that with kind of an open mind, I think we can find common ground.\u201d\nAlso at the gala, David Falk, president of Newmark\u2019s tri-state region, expressed concern about a breakdown in communication between the city and real estate.\n\u201cWe are not adversaries,\u201d he said. \u201cForget what was going on during the running for office and the different candidates, the real estate industry just wants someone that can be their advocate.\u201d\nF\nriends, enemies\u00a0or frenemies?\nWhat do you call a builder who hasn\u2019t started collecting rent? A developer. And for now, it appears that distinction still provides them with cover from Mamdani.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very optimistic about this administration\u2019s real focus on affordable housing. I think it\u2019s the clearest focus on affordable housing we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said David Schwartz, co-founder of Slate Property Group, nodding to the appointments of Bozorg and Tigani as positive signs.\nWhile landlords are once again back in the hot seat, the mayor appears much more willing to engage with the city\u2019s developers. He\u2019s acknowledged multiple times that the city is in desperate need of more housing, and has even relaxed his previous views that the only way to build more housing is by working with nonprofit developers to construct city-owned properties.\n\u201cAt first we were worried, but I give him a lot of credit,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cI don\u2019t think a lot of politicians do that and change their opinion, even when they realize they may have said something wrong. I think some of them double down.\u201d\nMamdani\u2019s tentative friendliness is different from previous administrations, such as Mayor Bill De Blasio\u2019s, which equated development with gentrification and often vilified developers.\n\u201cIf we look at the story arc of Mayor Mamdani\u2019s primary campaign until today, there certainly has been a moderation, specifically in terms of the development of housing and the role of private industry,\u201d Burgos said.\nBozorg and Tigani did show up to the gala, signaling that hope is not lost in terms of the industry having a seat at the table.\n\u201cI\u2019m the optimistic one in the room,\u201d said developer Spencer Levine, president of RAL Companies. \u201cSince the inauguration, there definitely has been a different projection of the conversation and attitude, but that might just be him feeling his ground. It\u2019s way too early to see.\u201d\nHowever, others say an understanding between the city and the industry won\u2019t happen if the mayor doesn\u2019t tone down his rhetoric.\n\u201cHe needs to pivot and stop campaigning and start governing,\u201d Peter Rigardi, chairman and president of JLL\u2019s tri-state region, said at the REBNY gala.\n\u201cHis mission for affordable housing is a noble and needed one, but it\u2019s not going to happen with just energetic, young ideas,\u201d he added. \u201cHe needs to marry that with experience and the right capital that makes these types of projects happen.\u201d\nKathy Wylde, the former head of the Partnership for New York City who helped organize initial meetings between the mayor and industry leaders, said the administration is still getting up and running, and that the first few actions were likely easy fixes that would signal to his base that he\u2019s staying true to his word.\nHowever, she emphasized that the administration is by no means closed off to the idea of continued meetings with real estate stakeholders, and reported that members of the administration have said that they will likely open their schedules around March, after they finish hiring and the city budget proposal.\n\u201cThis administration really had to campaign until the polls closed on Nov. 5, so to be fair, they did not have the usual window in regard to key appointments,\u201d Wylde said. \u201cMy message is just give it a little time.\u201d\n\u2014 Lilah Burke contributed reporting",

        "content": "Tenants, activists and press crowded the halls of Lower Manhattan bankruptcy court, eager to see the new landlord, Zohar Levy.\nLevy\u2019s Summit placed a $451 million stalking-horse bid for a 93-building, approximately 5,200-unit portfolio put into bankruptcy by Pinnacle Group. Now, the little-known investor, taking a break from a family vacation in Europe to answer questions from the city and tenants\u2019 attorneys by video call, was about to become a New York City rent-stabilized landlord.\nDid he know what would come next?\n\u201cWe are aware of the responsibility attached to managing such a portfolio,\u201d Levy said at his testimony in January.\nBankruptcy court, usually procedural, had turned into a testing ground for how the city would fulfill its promises to tenants, as New York City\u2019s\nnew mayor Zohran Mamdani\nobjected\nto Summit\u2019s bid at the last minute and sought a delay in the bankruptcy. The city questioned whether\nthe deal was financially viable\n, noting that nearly all of the units were rent-stabilized with below-market rents. In filings, attorneys asked how the property\u2019s income could cover its debt costs.\nThose in the industry had similar questions. Investor interest in rent-stabilized portfolios plunged after the passage of Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, which made it impossible for landlords to substantially raise rents, even following a vacancy. The Federal Reserve\u2019s rate hikes starting in 2022 only made things worse. The asset class was deemed uninvestable, and the doomsday scenario spun out: Owners would no longer pay for basic maintenance, properties would fall into the hands of vulture investors, the city\u2019s housing stock would further erode and banks would be left on the hook with millions in bad loans.\n\u201cEverything can be done with less money.\u201d\nZohar Levy, in a 2005 interview in the Israeli press [translated from Hebrew]\nEven typically level-headed advisors and think-tank fellows began to sound the alarm.\n\u201cUnless we vastly increase the amount of budget for subsidized housing, almost all of it is going to have to go to rescuing these buildings,\u201d Mark Willis of NYU\u2019s Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy said in a presentation last April. He suggested that an intervention might be needed to save the buildings.\nYet Zohar Levy is neither a government intervention, an out-of-town speculator nor an optimist expecting the state\u2019s rent law to change. Now in his late 50s, Levy made a fortune investing in Germany\u2019s real estate market, and amid all the noise, he believes the numbers simply pencil out.\n\u201cThe fundamentals of the portfolio provide a steady, albeit conservative, return on the investment,\u201d a Summit spokesperson said.\nIf he\u2019s right, the\ndeal\nthrows water on the fiery arguments of both tenant and landlord advocates.\nT\nhe buyer\nLevy was born in Haifa, Israel, and studied accounting at school. He became the CFO of Engel Resources, a real estate firm run by his father-in-law, billionaire Jacob Engel, who made one of his many fortunes building housing for post-Soviet immigrants to Israel in the early 1990s.\nLevy went out on his own in about 2002. In his first deal, he bought a struggling real estate company in Israel, known as Chayel Holdings. He saw an opportunity to cut costs, restructure its debt and find profitability.\n\u201cIt all started with an ad I saw in the newspaper for the sale of Chayel Holdings,\u201d Levy said in an interview with the Israeli business publication Globes in 2005.\nLevy slashed management costs at Chayel from 12 million shekels to 1.5 million shekels a year, telling Globes that income-producing real estate companies did not need so many expenses such as managers, cell phones or engineers on hand.\n\u201cI discovered that everything can be done with less money,\u201d he said in Hebrew in the Globes interview. Collectively, press about Levy describes him as a private person with an analytical mind.\nHe rebanded the firm as Summit and raised money by issuing bonds in Israel\u2019s capital markets.\nIn 2004, Levy saw Germany as the next frontier for undervalued assets. At the time, Germany\u2019s economic growth was stagnant. It was not a popular destination for international investors. But Levy started acquiring grocery-anchored retail centers and other commercial and residential properties.\nStarting in 2007, Summit\u2019s German business grew rapidly. The company raised 300 million euros on the London Stock Exchange. It acquired Deutsche Real Estate AG, a publicly traded company on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.\nLevy decided to move out of the German market in the early 2020s. He unloaded most of Summit\u2019s German portfolio, grossing over 1 billion euros and reinvested the money into U.S. real estate. Summit created a U.S. subsidiary, which acquired stakes in 90 residential buildings with 3,100 units, two unspecified hotels in New York City and 27 retail centers and malls across the country.\nLevy\u2019s work was not limited to real estate. Summit took a 16 percent stake in Paz, an Israeli energy and retail company, which he sold in July 2025 for 1.1 billion Israeli shekels, or $350 million. It was one of the largest deals in Tel Aviv Stock Exchange history, according to Globes.\nSummit\u2019s deals also include value-add opportunities with higher risk. In October 2025, Summit acquired the leasehold on 444 Madison Avenue, a 42-story Class B office tower for just $42 million. The previous owner, Westbrook, bought the lease on the 1930s-era office building for $314 million in 2007.\nBut Levy was still not a known player in New York City real estate. His acquisitions of rental buildings were made through a limited partnership. When The Real Deal reached out to sources about Levy, few had heard of him.\nThen came the Pinnacle auction.\nT\nhe portfolio\nIn 1997, Pinnacle Group owned 267 apartments in New York City, the New York Times reported. Joel Wiener slowly grew the business to over 20,000 units, largely rent-stabilized, across Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan and the Bronx. He also converted over a dozen of the rent-stabilized apartment buildings into condominiums.\nOver the years, tenant groups accused Wiener and his company Pinnacle of shoddy repairs and rent overcharges, especially as demand ratcheted up for the gentrifying neighborhoods where he owned.\nWiener was among the first U.S. developers to sell bonds in Israel, providing him with over $500 million in cheap financing. By 2017, his portfolio was valued at $2 billion and Wiener himself was a billionaire, according to Bloomberg.\nThings started to go south for Pinnacle in 2019, after the state law limited stabilized landlords from raising rents after making improvements. It also made it more difficult for landlords to convert rent-stabilized buildings into condos.\nIn May 2025, Pinnacle\u2019s lender, Flagstar Bank, initiated a foreclosure on a $564 million loan tied to the 5,200-unit portfolio. To stop the foreclosure, Pinnacle put those properties into bankruptcy protection, valuing the portfolio at $826 million.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t view it as a heavy lift.\u201d\nPeter Hungerford, who bid on the Pinnacle portfolio\nA month later, Levy met with Wiener and his associates, according to Globes. (Wiener has an Israeli subsidiary called Zarasai Group.)\nSummit was also seeking to make a deal with Pinnacle\u2019s Israeli bondholders, Globes reported. The bonds, which were trading for junk status, would be converted to shares of a new real estate company controlled by Summit.\nA Summit spokesperson said the deal never materialized.\nInstead, Summit decided to enter the contentious bankruptcy process for a much bigger slice of Pinnacle\u2019s portfolio. Eastdil Secured ran the marketing process attracting 14 offers on the first round of bidding and seven qualified offers in the second round. Summit was the stalking horse bidder.\nPH Realty\u2019s Peter Hungerford, whose firm\nhas acquired\n4,100 apartment units, including recent purchases of stabilized stock, said he made a bid on the Pinnacle portfolio. After tours, he found the conditions to be \u201cgood overall.\u201d\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t view it as a heavy lift,\u201d he said.\nBut Summit was the winning bidder after a multi-round process, offering $451.3 million or $87,000 per unit.\nFlagstar slashed its debt and offered Summit a $338.5 million loan for the acquisition at an attractive rate of 5.25 percent. (Summit\u2019s spokesperson said the terms of the loan were part of a negotiation. Flagstar did not return a request to comment.)\nT\nhe plan\nSummit had penciled the deal as a run-of-the-mill apartment deal, with lower debt costs that will allow the firm to increase cash flow, according to Summit. The firm expects to bring in $36 million in net operating income annually which amounts to a capitalization rate of about 8 percent. (The cap rate, a metric showing the property\u2019s potential return, for New York City walk-up apartment transactions during the fourth quarter of 2025, averaged 7.46 percent, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield.)\nBut the city\u2019s legal team appeared unwilling to accept Summit\u2019s numbers. During the bankruptcy process, lawyers raised questions about Summit\u2019s financial ability to cure violations, history as a property owner and limited experience running real estate in New York.\nSummit responded, noting that only 420 units, or 8 percent of the portfolio, account for all of the violations. It said it would spend $10 million in the first year fixing violations and addressing maintenance needs with $3 million specifically on existing violations. In five years, it would spend a total of $30 million in capital improvements.\nThe city\u2019s close involvement wasn\u2019t a deterrent.\n\u201cThis is a high profile deal with a lot of public attention. It is not surprising that the City took such an active role,\u201d a Summit spokesperson said. \u201cWe understand the City\u2019s concern and look forward to working with them to improve the buildings.\u201d\nOn Jan. 16, David Jones, the bankruptcy court judge,\napproved the sale\n.\n\u201cSummit\u2019s statements make clear its commitment to do what is needed,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe city\u2019s approach to this case gives me confidence that the city will monitor and police Summit\u2019s performance.\u201d\nIf Summit\u2019s assessment is to be believed, about 92 percent of the portfolio is in good shape. Summit is budgeting only $30 million, or $97 per unit per month, to repairs. In the big picture, that\u2019s not very much. Because Mamdani has vowed to \u201cfreeze the rent\u201d by appointing new representatives to the nine-member Rent Guidelines Board, the landlord won\u2019t get annual increases on the units if it has underestimated the work.\nWith no expectation of vacancy decontrol or substantial rent increases, the numbers may be tougher to hit \u2014 the landlord advocates and the city now both admit the expenses are high and the income too low.\nBut if Levy, the accountant, has it right, he may get back to an older way of running rent-stabilization buildings, where owners held property for long periods of time, expecting steady cash flow rather than large returns on future sales.",

        "content": "Some of the usual suspects of the Southern California commercial real estate crowd chatted over breakfast burritos and coffee at a Hilton hotel in Little Tokyo on Wednesday, perhaps\u00a0 in hopes of getting some deals done in what panelists would later describe as another hard year.\nThree chief executives of family-owned businesses, among others, sat on the panel at Bisnow\u2019s first Los Angeles event of the year: Nadine Watt of Watt Capital Partners, Mike Lowe of Lowe Enterprise, and Christopher Rising of Rising Realty Partners.\nAll three said this year won\u2019t be easy, with no white knight to save the day, or downtown. Institutional capital, even if it hasn\u2019t written off Los Angeles, is in wait-and-see mode, Lowe said.\nRising was a hit for his mix of humor and straight talk.\n\u201cAt our height we were the second largest landlord behind Brookfield in downtown L.A., and we\u2019re still around \u2014 they\u2019re not,\u201d Rising said, alluding to his efforts to hold on to One California Plaza as opposed to the hundreds of millions of dollars worth of downtown office towers Brookfield has defaulted upon in an exit being made mostly via lenders or receivers.Brookfield has multiple\nofferings\nthroughout downtown\u2019s Financial District that account for about a fifth of Class A office space.\nThat elicited some laughs, but Rising then commanded attention with a serious assessment of current events. The son of the late Nelson Rising, who was very involved in California politics, said \u201cthere is a broken trust with Wall Street,\u201d and it stems from Measure ULA. That\u2019s the City of Los Angeles\u2019 property-transfer tax that\u2019s also known as the mansion tax despite the fact that it hits the commercial as well as residential sectors with a 4 percent levy on deals of more than $5 million, and 5.5 percent on deals priced at more than $10 million.\nWall Street believes elected officials specifically went after corporate profit, Rising said, with Measure ULA, which drew rumbings of\nreform\nthis week before being\nkicked\nto committee by the city council.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to rebuild trust,\u201d Rising said. \u201cI would like to see our mayor and our city council get on an airplane and go down where all the private equity firms are and say, \u2018we\u2019re open for business\u2019 \u2026 I don\u2019t think that will happen \u2026 I\u2019d be happy to \u2026 make introductions.\u201d\nBack to back to work\nRising, who co-owns One California Plaza, the office tower on Bunker Hill that\u2019s now in the hands of a\nreceiver\nafter a $300 million default, wants workers back at their desks, particularly government employees downtown. He shared a conversation he said he had with Mayor Karen Bass a couple years ago, where he asked her what it would take to get people back in the office. Her response, he said, was that her staff comes in but she can\u2019t force other city personnel to do so.\nRising called the mayor\u2019s response \u201cinappropriate,\u201d and that he told her she could change department heads, but she wouldn\u2019t.\nHis goal wasn\u2019t to attack her but something\u2019s gotta give. \u201cOur elected officials are so hostile to the business environment,\u201d he said.\nNew money meets old\nDavid and Daniel Mirharooni purchased a pair of adjacent properties in Beverly Hills\u2019 Golden Triangle for about $25 million, or around $1,500 per square foot, from Anderson Real Estate, founded by late billionaire and Los Angeles businessman John Anderson, whose name adorns the business school at the UCLA. Newmark\u2019s Jay Luchs and Gavin Ketchum brokered the off-market transaction.\nThe deal was for 202 North Canon Drive, a one-story home to Rodeo Realty, and 208 North Canon Drive, which can be used for office or retail \u2014 the two buildings amount to about 16,400 square feet.\nIt\u2019s a pricey\ntrade\n, and a notable one. The Mirharoonis have made other Beverly Hills buys, where commercial deals are untouched by the mansion tax. They own a Mastro\u2019s on Canon, and recently purchased retail on South Robertson Boulevard for almost $8 million, or $985 per square foot. But why did Anderson sell? It still owns 9720 Wilshire, a stunning office tower in Beverly Hills\u2019 Golden Triangle.\nKnockout\nOlympic gold medalist and 10-time world champion boxer Oscar De La Hoya\ndefaulted\non a $27 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan connected to an office building at 626 Wilshire Boulevard in the Financial District of downtown LA.\u00a0 The \u201cGolden Boy\u201d looks tarnished on this deal, with about $23 million in date and foreclosure looming.\nEyesore no more?\nCreditors reached a bankruptcy-exit agreement over Oceanwide Plaza downtown,\naccording to\nBloomberg. That clears the way for a possible sale of the undone towers covered in graffiti. A potential investor is in talks to buy the property, but the deal hinges on resolving the bankruptcy, Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.\n",

        "content": "For 13 years in a row, South Shore\u2019s multifamily market had an argument for being crowned the hottest in Chicago.\nFrom 2011 through 2023, the predominantly Black lakefront community just south of Jackson Park, where the new Obama Presidential Center is opening this summer, notched the most sales of any Chicago neighborhood for buildings with five units or more, according to the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University.\nIn some years during that stretch, South Shore, where working-class families have traditionally settled and moved up the economic rungs, saw more than twice as many such sales as runner-up neighborhoods. The area had more than 100 sales in two separate years, 2018 and 2022. No other Chicago community area tallied more than 80 sales in a single year during the entire 13-year period.\nBut in 2024, the activity fell off. South Shore \u2014 which is much more densely filled with larger buildings than most other South Side neighborhoods \u2014 came in fourth in Chicago, with only 34 sales of buildings with at least five units, the fewest since 2010.\nOf course, interest rate hikes in recent years slowed deal velocity, but that impacted everywhere. Landlords in South Shore have historically been more prone to financial trouble. According to DePaul data, the area notched the most foreclosure filings out of all city neighborhoods for buildings with at least five units most years since 2010.\nBehind the slower deal flow is a wave of distress now cresting in South Shore and placing it in riskier territory than other Chicago neighborhoods, especially as fragile financials turn into\nreal-life problems\n: heat that goes out in winter, code violations and revenue that can\u2019t cover rising property taxes. The trouble may be more than just the result of miscalculations by buyers. Much of the underwater real estate in the area was drowned by out-of-state investors whose strategies have drawn scrutiny as federal regulators and lenders look for causes of rampant\nmortgage distress\nin the multifamily industry.\n\u201cWe have certainly seen out-of-state buyers that have invested in the South Side of Chicago,\u201d Matthew Tarshis of Chicago-based Frontline Real Estate Partners said. Frontline frequently serves as a court-appointed receiver for distressed Chicago property. \u201cSome may have been well-intentioned, others may have committed fraud and others may not have known what they were doing. The overarching theme is that a lot of their assumptions were not true to market.\u201d\nCorey Oliver\u2019s Chicago-based property management firm Strength in Management helped stabilize South Side properties caught up in the Better Housing Foundation scam last decade, but he contends that the recent\nspate of problems across the area\u2019s real estate market\nhas had a worse impact.\n\u201cBecause you have artificially inflated the values of properties in this area to an unsustainable level,\u201d Oliver explained.\nOliver was working for landlord Trinity Flood when United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement along with other federal agencies raided her South Shore building last fall, drawing attention to its foreclosure fight. He wouldn\u2019t discuss that property, at 7500 South South Shore Drive, but he and others have grown concerned with\ndubious dealmaking and lending\nthat have left dozens of other nearby buildings in disrepair or uninhabitable due to mismanagement.\n\u201cThere were a lot of guys who came in with less-than-admirable intentions, and built the system,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they did was create comps that unsuspecting people were using to determine the value of their acquisitions. You also have a lot of people who saw buildings sell for $100,000 to $115,000 a door and they saw something at $90,000 a door thinking they were getting a good deal, only to realize it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\nLenders filed 20 foreclosure lawsuits for South Shore buildings with at least five units in 2024, the most in a decade and by far the most out of any Chicago neighborhood that year, the DePaul data shows. The next closest neighborhood was 11 in Chatham, just to the west, where some of South Shore\u2019s same landlords are also grappling with distress, records show.\nFurthermore, out of the 25 Chicago multifamily loans sold into pools of debt on the commercial mortgage-backed securities market and now marked as delinquent for payment, six of them, or nearly a quarter, are backed by property in South Shore. Within the entire Chicago metro area, there are 31 such CMBS loans, meaning nearly 20 percent trace back to South Shore.\nT\nhe rise\nSpeculation within South Shore ramped up in 2017, around the same time affiliates of a firm called Rhodium Capital began buying big chunks of multifamily on Chicago\u2019s South and West sides. Several of them were in South Shore. The firm obtained at least $46 million in Fannie Mae-backed debt from the likes of Arbor Realty Trust and Keybank to assemble a portfolio of more than 540 apartments throughout the city, records show. The investors behind Rhodium, Moshe Silber and Frederick Schulman, were sentenced last year to prison for their involvement in a mortgage fraud scandal in Ohio. Their Chicago real estate activity wasn\u2019t a factor in the criminal case.\nWord seemed to catch on that South Shore was a money maker. Prices for lower-cost multifamily properties in Chicago \u2014 which characterizes South Shore\u2019s stock \u2014 rose to nearly $73,000 per unit in 2024, up from less than $60,000 in 2019, according to the DePaul data that adjusted for inflation and showed the prices for each year in 2024 dollars. That marked a significantly higher relative rise compared to moderately priced apartment buildings while the prices of high-cost units fell over that period. And some of the New York-based buyers were paying well more than average, even though rents and renter incomes didn\u2019t change much over the last few years in the South Side as a whole, DePaul data shows.\n\u201cWhen you have these inflated transactions not driven by market realities, you\u2019re seeing everyday renters feel an affordability impact,\u201d Geoff Smith, executive director and principal investigator of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul, said.\nChicago-based multifamily operators who buy aged buildings and invest into upgrades were boxed out of the market by offers they could never match. Locals were baffled by how buyers like Brooklyn-based Yissocher \u201cIzzy\u201d Rotenberg and Boruch Gottesman were paying so much for properties that, in the estimation of Chicagoans, required extensive repairs.\nT\nhe fall\nBut some of the speculative landlords declined to invest in needed upgrades, and their buildings fell into disrepair. Tenants left for better conditions, and problems spiraled.\nRotenberg had become a prominent landlord in South Shore, owning five buildings there with nearly 100 combined units, plus over a dozen others totaling more than 500 apartments throughout Chicago, mostly in nearby Chatham, Greater Grand Crossing and Auburn Gresham.\nHe eventually landed in the most trouble.\nRecords show that a Rotenberg portfolio purchased for $48 million with $40 million in loans fell into foreclosure, and lenders have seized many of his apartment buildings. He has also drawn lawsuits from multiple people who said they were investors in his Chicago real estate ventures but got cut out of the deals. According to one lawsuit brought by Shulim Kiwak and Yitschok Piller, Rotenberg allegedly kept $1.3 million in insurance proceeds paid out from a fire that destroyed a South Shore property at 7756 South Phillips Avenue and declined to pay his partners $900,000 they said they were owed. The other suit was brought by an investor named Shlomo Horowitz, who claimed Rotenberg never distributed proceeds from a sale of a South Shore property made to Eli Tauber.\n\u201cInvestors come to Chicago because they see good cap rates on paper. What they don\u2019t know is the level of capabilities you need, the level of field team operations, the level of people being there every single day.\u201d\nShaya Wurzberger, Levav Properties\nJudgments against Rotenberg have been issued in both. But he hasn\u2019t appeared in any of the court cases, not since selling property to Tauber, another player facing significant Chicago property distress after partnering with\nMark Nussbaum\n\u2014 the New York real estate attorney indicted for allegedly stealing $15 million from client escrow funds. Tauber and Nussbaum, who pleaded not guilty in the criminal case, bought batches of Chicago properties at surging prices despite the presence of building code violations and, in the case of property previously owned by Rotenberg, even existing foreclosure suits.\nNow, Nussbaum and Tauber are facing 29 foreclosure lawsuits totaling at least $24 million in mortgage debt.\n\u201cInvestors come to Chicago because they see good cap rates on paper. What they don\u2019t know is the level of capabilities you need, the level of field team operations, the level of people being there every single day,\u201d Shaya Wurzberger, an investor from New York, said. Wurzberger is the CEO of Levav Properties, which has been a big buyer of Chicago multifamily in recent years.\nLevav is dealing with its own $12 million foreclosure lawsuit for a portion of its South Side portfolio, though Wurzberger insisted his firm overall isn\u2019t in distress. He claimed Levav bought $100 million of real estate consisting of more than 1,000 apartments in Chicago since 2021. (Property records confirm Levav bought at least 500 units, including some in South Shore, for $50 million between 2022 and early 2025.)\n\u201cAt that time when everybody was buying, prices were going up, I got a little bit involved in that and paid a little too much for this [portion of Levav\u2019s] portfolio,\u201d Wurzberger said.\nWurzberger tried to get the foreclosure lawsuit filed by his lender, New York-based Roc Capital, thrown out of court, but his motion was recently denied by a judge and the case is advancing. But at least he showed up in court.\nBy contrast, other area landlords seem to have turned into shadows, untrackable to their lenders or investors.\nT\nhe mess\nTo be sure, some Chicago-based operators have also played a hand in racking up South Shore\u2019s rate of multifamily distress. A firm called Catalyst Realty run by Stephen Lee and Tyler DeRoo has been facing legal issues, including foreclosures, of properties in the area. (DeRoo was previously involved in the infamous EquityBuild real estate scam in Chicago in the 2010s.)\nChikoo Patel\u2019s Chicago-based firm CKO Real Estate also melted down as tenants in its portfolio of South Side properties, including in South Shore, allegedly went without heat in the winter and the landlord racked up debts he couldn\u2019t repay, including with a credit card company. Patel\u2019s financial backer, Shai Wolkowicki, is suing him; Wolkowicki alleges Patel siphoned $10 million in multifamily investments for personal use.\nBut local groups in distress so far are facing fewer large foreclosure cases than East Coast investors. One difference is that the out-of-state investors entered the South Side multifamily market, and its centerpiece South Shore, late in the game, so they couldn\u2019t get out when interest rate hikes began crushing margins and closing offramps.\nWhile some investors have started to buy up properties from investors like Gottesman and Rotenberg and turn them around with repairs and new leasing strategies, there\u2019s still plenty more financial distress to clean up.\nAnd details about recent deals continue to come out, helping explain what happened.\n\u201cI would guess many of these don\u2019t start out as fraud and maybe they eventually, you know, evolve into that,\u201d said one experienced South Side landlord who bought a portfolio previously controlled by an investor who Fannie Mae blacklisted.\nT\nhe clean-up\nEither way, players grew desperate and began to look for exits. One of them was Mendel Steiner, who died by suicide last year, facing daunting mortgage debt.\nSteiner accumulated a large real estate portfolio nationally; his total Chicago holdings aren\u2019t known. Now, at least seven properties he owned on the South Side, including several in South Shore, are in the midst of foreclosure lawsuits, with lenders alleging that over $11 million in Chicago loans are in default. Steiner\u2019s representatives and estate have been notably absent from court events tied to his property since it started running into trouble; this was true of Steiner before his death.\nA total of nearly $142 million in CMBS loans to Steiner-controlled real estate companies are in default, with the underlying property consisting of apartments in Chicago, Indianapolis and Cincinnati, according to loan servicer notes. There are nearly $61 million in loans for buildings in Steiner\u2019s portfolio that are still making regular payments, the data shows.\nScott Shefman, a court-appointed receiver to Steiner\u2019s distressed Chicago properties, alleged that Leib Steiner, who\u2019s representing Steiner\u2019s estate, isn\u2019t cooperating, even continuing to collect rent from Chicago properties that Steiner owned instead of turning over revenue to the receivership as the court has ordered. The receiver is trying to get the court to compel the estate\u2019s compliance.\nShefman declined to comment and attempts to reach the Steiner estate weren\u2019t successful. Neither Rotenberg nor a member of the Tauber family who has partnered on Chicago transactions with Nussbaum returned requests for comment.\nA lawsuit filed in December seeks to recover approximately $330 million from two entities tied to Steiner, alleging the late investor ran a Ponzi scheme that lured clients and prospective clients of Nussbaum\u2019s law firm, Nussbaum Lowinger, into two investment ploys through which escrow funds were supposedly used to \u201cshow capital\u201d for real estate deals, and another involving fabricated joint ventures tied to property acquisitions.\nPlenty of Chicago property has already turned over to new ownership after foreclosures or other legal problems, as local players get back into buying with plans to spruce up properties using additional capital. Chicago-based Sleeping Bear Capital late last year paid about $2.7 million to buy one of Rotenberg\u2019s former properties from lender Roc Capital, well less than the $3.7 million mortgage Rotenberg borrowed against the property before defaulting, records show. Sleeping Bear obtained a construction mortgage from Providence Bank for over $3.6 million, with plans for updates.\n\u201cThe market now is in a much better place. The people buying now are actual operators,\u201d Wurzberger said.\nBut there\u2019s still plenty of distress working its way through the system tied to out-of-state landlords, regardless of whether mortgage missteps were behind the demise of the deals. In December, Fannie Mae initiated an $18 million foreclosure lawsuit against an entity controlled by Lakewood, New Jersey-based investor Israel Bialostozky, who records show bought the 291-unit South Side portfolio in 2023 from Chaim Joseph Bialostozky; both the buyer and seller have shared the same residential address, according to public records databases. The current owner didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had multiple properties trading at prices that don\u2019t make sense,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cThe only people who really suffer in the end are the community members. Because you end up with a 20-unit building boarded up, that\u2019s no longer part of the tax base, which means your portion of property taxes for your area goes up. Plus you have this blight on your street, which, depending on how it\u2019s maintained by the bank, becomes a haven for crime or becomes a dilapidated building.\u201d",

        "content": "When Igor Gabal bought an office building in downtown Chicago for a 90 percent discount from its last appraisal, the $4 million price tag had one of two interpretations: either the deal was a sign that the property had become virtually worthless since the pandemic or Gabal had just made the best decision of his life.\nThe building, at 300 West Adams, is 12 stories and 240,000 square feet, with decorative terracotta detailing that shows off its era \u2014 the 1920s. But occupancy was only 50 percent, and any owner would have to pay the annual ground lease of about $1.4 million to start.\nFire sales are everywhere. In Houston, San Francisco, Manhattan, Washington, D.C., and Dallas, over 60 percent of office buildings traded in 2025 sold at a markdown from their prior sale price, according to analysis from Yardi Matrix.\nBut what a buyer does after the closing says more about the worth of a building than the headline number or percentage off. Adding value can mean doing updates, increasing tenancy or rebranding.\nFor Gabal, trouble began soon after headlines announced the deal in early 2024, and his investment in the building veered off course. He\u2019s gone through legal trouble and sparred with partners. Meanwhile, the office market hasn\u2019t really recovered, with potential tenants eyeing new or newly renovated Class A office buildings, not older stock.\nHe still has hope. This year, Gabal\u2019s investment will either prove the naysayers wrong or serve as a cautionary tale for bargain buyers who\u2019ve cashed in on what seemed like post-pandemic bargains.\n\u201cThe value is definitely there,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s like we bought $100 for $1.\u201d\nD\naunting competition\nSince Gabal\u2019s purchase, the broader office market has not performed well.\nOut of the full inventory of downtown office space in Chicago, about 29.5 percent is available for rent. That percentage stayed nearly stagnant from 2024, when it came in at 29.4 percent, according to a 2025 year-end report from Savills.\nOne factor keeping vacancy high: new Class A. Just three blocks north of 300 West Adams, the shiny glass-paneled Bank of America tower at 110 North Wacker Drive looms over the Loop. Built in 2020 and 98 percent leased, the building is a glittering example of the high-risk, high-reward landscape of the current office market.\nIn November, lenders threw their confidence behind it, issuing\na $700 million refinancing\nto its landlords, a joint venture of power players Oak Hill Advisors, Callahan Capital Partners and Affinius Capital. It was the largest commercial loan issued in Chicago in 2025, data analysis from The Real Deal found.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like we bought $100 for $1.\u201d\nIgor Gabal\nMeanwhile, former meat-packing district Fulton Market in the West Loop is emerging as the go-to destination for office tenants. Sterling Bay recently listed a building the firm developed at 345 North Morgan with a $70 million construction loan. The 11-story building is a similar size as 300 West Adams but is 94 percent leased with an average lease term of 11 years.\nIf Sterling Bay manages to turn a profit on the sale, the deal will solidify Fulton Market\u2019s dominance in Chicago\u2019s office sector.\nGabal felt the tension. Directly south of Bank of America Tower and west of 345 North Morgan, he spent the two years leading up to that landmark $700 million refinancing languishing in Cook County Circuit Court with his redevelopment plans on hold.\nT\naxes, insurance &amp; lawsuits\nThe auction for 300 West Adams had attracted buyers with less traditional real estate backgrounds, and some of the hopefuls were still circling, unhappy they hadn\u2019t won. A few months after the sale closed in December 2023, a pair of local investors sued Gabal and JLL (on behalf of its brokers), claiming they were cut out of a deal to buy the building.\nThe plaintiffs, John Thomas and a little-known investor, Chris Hansen, alleged that they had planned to buy the building with Gabal but he had put in an offer on his own without their financial backing.\nHad he gotten in on the deal, Thomas hoped to revive the office building along with his own reputation.\nThomas has led a tumultuous career involving two criminal convictions, one stint in federal prison and a role as a mole for the FBI during the investigation of Chicago political fixer Tony Rezko, an associate of disgraced former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. He has said he built a $150 million real estate empire after his 2017 release from prison, but he filed for bankruptcy twice in 2022. He has since exited bankruptcy, public records show.\nThe lawsuit ultimately went in Gabal\u2019s favor but not before the two traded barbs in the press.\n\u201cThey have no wherewithal to execute and are just trying to disturb the normal people who are willing and have the capability to do this,\u201d Gabal said of Thomas and Hansen at the time.\nAfter seeing how things went at the property over the past two years, Thomas said he\u2019s glad he didn\u2019t get in on the deal.\n\u201cI have heart issues now. I actually do. But I think I would have had massive heart attacks if I had been this buyer,\u201d he said.\nNot long after the dust settled with Thomas and Hansen, Gabal was hit with another lawsuit, this time from his business partner, Ruben Espinoza. In a May filing, Espinoza accused Gabal of mishandling a $6.2 million insurance payout tied to water damage at the building.\nIn response, Gabal claimed Espinoza was the one mishandling funds set aside for the building\u2019s operations.\nGabal alleges that Espinoza has withdrawn $1.5 million from the partners\u2019 shared business account without Gabal\u2019s permission and did not respond to repeated requests to stop.\n\u201cI have heart issues now. I actually do. But I think I would have had massive heart attacks if I had been this buyer.\u201d\nJohn Thomas, would-be buyer of 300 West Adams\nAs a result, they were unable to pay property taxes on the building in 2023 and 2024, Gabal\u2019s filing claims.\nMeanwhile, Espinoza has been dealing with a barrage of lawsuits against him. Since 2022, he has been served with at least nine legal complaints from fellow investors, commercial tenants, lenders and even a state senator, at one point topping $80 million in disputes.\nOn top of facing foreclosures filed by lenders, two commercial tenants of Espinoza\u2019s claim he took deposits and first month\u2019s rent for spaces he had already filled with other tenants and refused to refund them.\nMany of the legal disputes involving Espinoza are still pending.\nGabal claims he and Espinoza are close to settling their dispute and that he plans to buy Espinoza out of the ownership of the building.\n\u201cObviously the lawsuits set me back,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I managed to sit down with Espinoza and satisfy his requirements so I can pursue my vision and plan for the building.\u201d Espinoza and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment.\nE\nking out a profit\nSoon free to make decisions on his own, Gabal still has to figure out how to run the building.\nStabilizing a\ndistressed\nbuilding can generate impressive returns but buyers need to have a plan to stay afloat financially during the turnaround process, David Levy of Keen-Summit Capital Partners said. (Levy is also former president of the Midwest chapter of an organization called the Turnaround Management Association.)\n\u201cWhile real estate assets are more illiquid than a stock, the market is dynamic, it\u2019s competitive, and it could take longer than anticipated to to lease up space,\u201d he said.\nAt 300 West Adams, each month that Gabal goes without additional tenants or financing erodes the investor\u2019s bottom line because of the ground lease owned to\nHawaii-based investor Jay Shidler\n, who owns swaths of such ground leases throughout the U.S.\nThe terms of Shidler\u2019s 99-year ground lease include a 3 percent increase each year until 2042, after which the annual payment plateaus to $2.5 million for the remainder of the lease, according to former loan data reports. The amount started at $1 million in 2012.\nGabal plans to convert the first two to three floors to a data center, due to the building\u2019s proximity to a fiber route and the Centrio cooling station. With the right improvements, the remaining space can remain offices, he said.\nFollowing a similar plan, a venture of heavy hitters Mike Reschke\u2019s Prime Group and Quintin Primo\u2019s Capri Investment Group sold the 385,000-square-foot former Cboe Global Markets headquarters at 400 South LaSalle Street for $40 million last fall. The sale came in at almost $104 per square foot \u2014 more than triple the $12 million, or $31 per square foot, that they paid for it a year earlier.\nPrime and Capri bought the wide concrete-and-steel building in July 2024 with an eye toward data center redevelopment. Before selling, they completed early-phase work, including upgrades to power capacity \u2014 a desirable commodity nationwide.\nThe buyer, Arlington, Virginia-based Legacy Investing, plans to transform the six-story property into a 33-megawatt data center slated to go online by late 2026, according to co-founder and managing partner Daniel English.\nBut even doing the groundwork for such a project is expensive. The longer it takes to get started, the more operating costs a building owner incurs in the meantime.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to buy these things and then say, \u2018Okay, now what?\u2019 You want to have a clear plan going in,\u201d Levy said.\nS\nale rack\nDespite two years of struggle at 300 West Adams, Gabal is undeterred from a broader plan to increase his presence in the Loop.\nThe Ukranian-born investor got his start in Chicago real estate by investing in multifamily properties in the \u201990s. But he sold off most of his buildings in 2012 in favor of building a business that specializes in importing European consumer goods ranging from high-end snacks and beverages to supplements and even painter\u2019s tape.\nAfter Covid, the call of real estate was too strong to resist. Gabal continues to look for deals in the Loop, though he feels there\u2019s now more competition.\n\u201cWe came at the lowest point in the market,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the last 24 months \u2026 everybody came into the Loop and started buying.\u201d\nSo far, it\u2019s not clear if the market has reached the bottom. Other bargain hunters are still circling. In early 2025, Namdar, known for buying distressed malls, bought 70 West Madison for $85 million, a 77 percent discount from its last sale price of $375 million in 2014.\nGabal has also been pursuing a purchase of the distressed debt tied to the ground lease (also held by the Shidler Group) under The Burnham Center, the historic 22-story office building at 111 West Washington where he\u2019s partnering with Reschke on the acquisition.\nLike his plans at 300 West Adams, the deal has yet to finalize.",

        "content": "It\u2019s not just the blue states: Some local leaders in the Lone Star State are turning a cold shoulder to their federal colleagues with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nThe federal agency, currently under fire for its hand in civilian killings in Minneapolis, reportedly\nbought a 1-million-square-foot warehouse\nin the Dallas suburb of Hutchins, with plans to turn it into a detention center, the Washington Post first reported in December.\nThe facility would be able to hold up to 9,500 people, rattling a city with a population under 8,000. Hutchins Mayor Mario Vasquez told local ABC affiliate\nWFAA\nthat he\u2019s opposed to the plan, saying warehouses in the town of 8,000 \u201care for storage, not for holding people.\u201d\n\u201cWho wants an ICE facility in their backyard?\u201d he asked rhetorically when pressed about his opposition.\nICE hasn\u2019t confirmed the purchase, but the Clergy League for Emergency Action and Response said the transaction and location, at 950 North I-45, are an open secret, D Magazine\nreported\n.\nElsewhere in the Texas Triangle, ICE is eyeing a 640,000-square-foot warehouse in San Antonio, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n. The warehouse has been unoccupied for almost three years. The source that confirmed ICE is considering the property at 542 SE Loop 410 also told the outlet that the agency is scouting property in McAllen, on the U.S.-Mexico border..\nBexar County Commissioner Tommy Calvert vowed to fight the purchase.\n\u201cThese facilities are a front for more nefarious things to come if we don\u2019t stop them,\u201d he said in a statement to the San Antonio Business Journal.\nThere\u2019s no record of a transaction, but the rumors come amid a flood of reports that ICE is juicing up its real estate holdings across the country.\nHoles in S2\u2019s shield against syndicator crash out\nWhen Scott Everett\nlaunched the largest private REIT\nin 2024, the move was hailed by the industry as a clever escape hatch from the all-too-familiar syndicator crash out that took down his peers.

        "content": "There\u2019s been chatter around\nalternative building materials\nin the fire rebuild, but do ultra-high-net-worth buyers care?\nThe audience for\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s \u201cBuilding Luxury\u201d panel held Jan. 27 in Beverly Hills was keen to bat the idea around.\nTRD\nhosted Coldwell Banker Realty\u2019s Jade Mills, Redeavor\u2019s Mike Leipart and Huntington Estate Properties\u2019 Ramtin Ray Nosrati for a wide-ranging discussion, but the one topic that got most people talking? Alternatives to homes built with wood.\nTo date, the market has seen steel frame makers, panelized housing manufacturers and others using concrete enter the picture with pitches of more fire-resistant structures. About a week ago, press, local government officials and residents gathered to watch a pre-fab home get dropped onto an\nAltadena lot\nby crane.\nLuxury home developer Ardie Tavangarian, whose Arya Group is focused on fire-resistant homes, told\nTRD\nearlier this week it\u2019s not realistic \u201cto continue constructing wood-frame houses the same way,\u201d and the outstanding question is whether such elements add to a home\u2019s value as much as, say, imported finishes from Milan or health and wellness amenities.\nThe consensus Tuesday was there is no consensus.\nA big test may come in Malibu where\nZuru Tech US\nis looking to test its prefab housing made in off-site factories at lots it bought in Malibu. Will the alternative building materials pique buyer interest, command a premium, or be an afterthought?\nMeasure ULA relief?\nNot quite. And, for residential, not really.\nThat\u2019s the short of it when it comes to a\nproposal to amend\nL.A.\u2019s so-called mansion tax, which was introduced by City Councilmember Nithya Raman on Jan. 23. The fourth district representative on Tuesday sought to get her peers on the 15-member city council to fast-track a\nJune ballot measure\namending Measure United to House L.A. She proposed a 15-year exemption on new multifamily, commercial and mixed-use projects. The driver behind the proposal is to promote more multifamily construction \u2014 a major tenet of ULA, when voters agreed to pass the two-tier tax on real estate transactions to fund housing and homelessness prevention programs.\nFor L.A. \u2018s single-family, residential market, properties impacted by a natural disaster would be eligible for a one-time, three-year carveout from ULA in Raman\u2019s proposal. It\u2019s a small bone tossed at the industry segment, with many residential agents saying for the nearly three years the tax has been around that it\u2019s stalled deals and chilled interest among spec developers to want to buy land and build homes within the city. Some agents point to the argument that many property owners\u2019 retirements are bound up in the value of their homes. Others argue $5.3 million \u2014 the floor triggering the 4 percent levy (its 5.5 percent on deals of $10.3 million or more) \u2014 doesn\u2019t really buy a mansion in L.A.\nAs of December, the median sales price for a home in the city was a little over $1 million, up about 2 percent from the year-ago comparison, according to Redfin.\nNumbers game\nOne more point on\nULA\n. Both sides of the issue have weaponized data to prove their point.\nThat\u2019s not noteworthy. What is notable is what Raman pointed out to her City Council peers on Tuesday in apologizing for \u201csurprising\u201d anyone with her proposal, which skipped over public discourse in any committee before she brought it to the floor of the body.\nRaman said she was in conversation with housing groups, Measure ULA coalition members, labor, the business community. In some cases, she added, fellow elected officials were also involved in talks during the months leading up to her motion.\n\u201cBut after many months, we weren\u2019t even able to agree on what data was important to monitor or what people cared about,\u201d she pointed out Tuesday.\nWhile the possibility of getting the idea onto the June ballot is gone with the Jan. 28 deadline lapsed for the council to instruct the city attorney to formalize such a move, changes to the tax remain up for consideration in the Housing and Homelessness Committee and with the ULA Citizen Oversight Committee.\nStill, if a baseline to gauge success can\u2019t even be determined, any ULA changes would seem to face an uphill battle.\nBouncing back\nIn case you missed it, this week saw sellers creep back into the market. With holiday travels over and kids going back to school, agents expect a buying bounceback.\nNinety-nine properties listed in the Multiple Listing Service for at least $4 million were added to Los Angeles County\u2019s inventory for the week ended Jan. 25, according to Douglas Elliman\u2019s\nEklund Gomes\nteam. That brought the number of active listings to 1,131.\nAmong the new entrants is spec developer and The Agency principal\nSantiago Arana\n\u2019s 401 North Tigertail Road in Brentwood. It\u2019s listed for $65 million, or $3,250 per square foot, after the \u201cBuying Beverly Hills\u201d cast member spent four years on construction.\nThere\u2019s also the historic Hollywood Hills home once owned by \u201cThe Price is Right\u201d host\nBob Barker\n. That property reappeared on the market last week with an asking price of $7.4 million, or $1,252 per square foot, for the home in the Outpost Estates neighborhood. The property\u2019s got history with Los Angeles Times Publisher Harrison Gray Otis and later Hollywood developer Charles Toberman also calling 1851 Outpost Drive home at one time or another.\nListing agent Zac Mostame, of Carolwood Estates, said he\u2019s optimistic with activity picking back up that Barker\u2019s former home will trade before summer.\n",

        "content": "The most expensive house in Texas is nearing its 90th birthday.\nDesigned for an Italian count by Swiss-American architect Maurice Fatio, whose other clients included the Rockefellers and the Vanderbilts, the\nCrespi Estate\nat 5619 Walnut Hill Lane in Dallas is asking $64 million, about $2,300 per square foot. The Coxes, family of Edwin Cox, primary benefactor of Southern Methodist University\u2019s Cox School of Business, are the sellers.\nUnlike its closest rival at the top of the Texas residential market, a\nHouston castle\nbuilt by the seller in 2005 and listed for $60 million, the Crespi Estate has proved its mettle before. It was the state\u2019s most expensive sale of 2016 according to Dallas real estate titan Allie Beth Allman, when Texas Rangers owner Tom Hicks sold it to billionaire banker Andy Beal. It topped the list again a year later, when developer\nMehrdad Moayedi\nbought it at auction for $36.2 million. He sold it to the Cox family two years later with an asking price of $38 million.\nThe Jazz Age mansion, on a 16-acre lot in one of Dallas\u2019 most prestigious neighborhoods, has more than 27,000 square feet of living space, including a ballroom. It shares the lot with gardens, greenhouses, tennis courts, a guest room, a heliport and, of course, a pool.\nThe Texas luxury market is steadying after a pendulous five years, and sellers could use a sure thing. If the home sells for anywhere close to asking, it could settle the score on an open question about the value of being old in a land known for building new: Is it good or bad that Crespi hails from 1938?\nC\noncrete crumbles,\ns\ntone holds\nAs the Texas luxury market slows, many agents say the right buyer will pay a premium for a well-preserved masterwork.\n\u201cHistoric homes tend to perform better long-term,\u201d said Emily Waldmann, a Douglas Elliman agent who specializes in architecturally significant properties. \u201cIf [a] home that\u2019s really special, that\u2019s been around for a hundred years, finally hits the market \u2014 and this is your one chance before it switches ownership for another 30 years \u2014 you\u2019re more likely going to swing the bat.\u201d\nLocal data illustrates her point. Since 2000, the Swedish Hill Historic District in 78702 has appreciated more than any other ZIP code in the Austin area, with average home sale prices nearly nine times higher now than at the turn of the century, according to\nTeam Price Real Estate\n. It was one of a minority of neighborhoods where values continued to go up between 2024 and 2025, a period when\nluxury inventory grew\nand\nsales declined\nin every major Texas metro.\nMeanwhile, the average home sale price in Tarrytown, the prestigious neighborhood where actress Emma Stone recently sold her home, appreciated at a far slower rate: barely quadrupling in the last 25 years. The area\u2019s homes depreciated more than any other ZIP code in the city between 2024 and 2025, with home sale prices declining by 10.5 percent.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where I hope that they engage a great architect.\u201d\nPogir on new builds that succeed historic homes\nStudies throughout the country have found that designated historic homes appreciate faster than other properties in most cycles and generally track the rate of the market in the worst case, according to an\nanalysis\nof research conducted in several states, including Texas.\nAgents in other areas of the state agree that a properly maintained piece of history can motivate a buyer in a way that contemporary homes can\u2019t. Pogir, the Briggs Freeman Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent who\u2019s co-listing the Crespi Estate with Diane DuVall, saw such enchantment firsthand with the Grady Vaughn house at 5350 South Dentwood Drive, a 9,500-square-foot Mid-Century Modern designed by Robert Goodwin in 1951, one of the largest of its kind. In 2020, a New York businessman bought the property sight unseen.\nThat buyer tapped an architect from Austin who specialized in renovating these older homes, a crucial move.\nA good restoration matters. If a house hasn\u2019t been \u201cflipperized with gray everything,\u201d its history \u2014 and therefore its scarcity \u2014 will carry it through the stormiest markets, according to Houston agent Robert Searcy, who specializes in architecturally significant properties and formerly owned the oldest documented privately owned home in\nHouston\n.\n\u201cThe houses that retain their historical character and have not been \u2014 the term I use is \u2018remuddled\u2019 \u2014 I think that the demand will always outstrip the supply,\u201d Searcy said. \u201cGood times, bad times.\u201d\nD\nirt-rich\nFor historic homes in the luxury class, the good times can prove more challenging than the bad. Even if the invisible hand passes over the state\u2019s Georgian manors, Victorian gingerbreads and Mid-Century Modern pads during downturns, it threatens them during upswings.\nThat\u2019s the case in Dallas, one of the fastest-appreciating areas in the country in the last 25 years. The state\u2019s ultra-luxury hub is also notably flashier than the other metros; while Austin\u2019s top sales tend to spread along the more remote stretches of the Colorado River, far west of the city, Dallas\u2019 top neighborhoods are nestled in the center of town, often right on the sidewalk. An\nAustin mansion\nis a hideaway; a Dallas mansion is a statement. (In the Park Cities, shallow lots\nreportedly\nsell better than deep, tree-hidden parcels.)\nTexas historic homes can weather recession; growth is another matter.\nAlthough data shows that historic districts remain buoyant during downturns, few historic homes qualify as luxury. Conversely, even to luxury buyers who are in the market for a historic home, craftsmanship and character matter more than official recognition, according to agents. That\u2019s why it\u2019s difficult to gauge the market performance of luxury homes considered historic \u2014 there\u2019s no way to comprehensively measure the value of a home with a respected architect and rare materials against another property that\u2019s simply old.\n\u201cThe plaque by the front door or the front gate is more novelty than anything. Whether it\u2019s designated historic or not, it\u2019s all about the architecture and the character and the vibe of the house,\u201d Searcy said.\n\u201cAn appraiser does not have a line item to assign value [to] things [like] architectural interest, character [or] charm,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the real world, they absolutely make an incredible difference in the value and the days on market.\u201d\nBecause urban historic homes tend to be centrally located, and rural historic homes tend to nest in legacy ranches, their high land value further complicates appraisals of the homes themselves.\nAn hour west of Austin in the Hill Country, Sotheby\u2019s agent Kris Forks is representing a 417-acre homestead outside of Fredericksburg with a main house built in the 1870s. While the two-bedroom stone house is unlikely to become a millionaire\u2019s party pad, it\u2019s a significant selling point, Forks says. The property\u2019s $7 million asking price amounts to almost $17,000 per acre, a fair stretch above the area\u2019s average sale price of $14,500 per acre for unimproved rural land, according to the Texas Real Estate Research Center.\n\u201cIf this home was in the middle of downtown, versus the contemporary home in the middle of downtown, there\u2019s absolutely a buyer for the historic home,\u201d Forks said.\nBut that downtown two-bed faces a different economic pressure. For urban historic properties, land can swallow up a greater share of the properties\u2019 total value over time as the cities grow around them, particularly if they\u2019re on large lots or in neighborhoods going through periods of rapid appreciation.\nFew cities have appreciated faster than Dallas, which has earned a reputation for demolishing historic mansions.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of times when the dirt outweighs what the value is worth to redo it, and it makes more sense to tear them down,\u201d according to Michael Humphries, an agent with the hyper-local Dallas brokerage Allie Beth Allman &amp; Associates.\nIn other words, treasure to historic-homes enthusiasts, blight to contemporary spec builders and their buyers.\nAnd while an original Hal Thomson \u2014 he designed grand Beaux-Arts and French Eclectic mansions throughout Dallas in the 1910s and \u201920s \u2014 might stay buoyed in a low market, a rising tide can easily overwhelm it.\n\u201cNobody can stop anybody from knocking anything down,\u201d Pogir said. \u201cSome incredible homes in Dallas \u2026 have been demolished,\u201d he added, mentioning the 105-year-old Trammell Crow estate, torn down in 2017, and the Cox Estate, a Beaux-Arts mansion razed in 2024. A 1918 neoclassical designed by Thomson at 4908 Lakeside Drive was reduced to land three years ago by William and Marilyn Oates, who sold it to an LLC.\nN\new history\nA significant architect can preserve the worth of a classic luxury home, but that won\u2019t bulletproof it. The Crespi Estate itself came close to demolition.\nBeal reportedly gutted much of the kitchen before he sold it to Moayedi, and Moayedi trimmed away parcels of the property\u2019s valuable dirt to develop the Crespi Estates, a subdivision of spec luxury homes, before he sold it to the Cox family.\nIronically, neoclassical imitations of prewar mansions often replace the doomed originals in Dallas. Newer homes in Preston Hollow and the Park Cities evince the influence of Italian villas and French chateaux, much like the mansions that preceded them under the wrecking ball. The signature of architect Robbie Fusch, a traditionalist who draws his plans by hand, boosts any listing; Fusch is famous for the $7.3 million Theta sorority house at Southern Methodist University, a Georgian design that replaced a smaller 1951 construction. He also designed the second most expensive sale of 2025, a $25.5 million manor at 4000 Euclid Avenue in Dallas with a gilded basilica-style dome and limestone floors, corniced fireplace and bronze hardware imported from France.\nAnother Fusch design, the \u201cWhite House of Dallas\u201d at 10777 Strait Lane, was on the market for $40 million for several months last year. The third most expensive home to sell in Texas last year was a neoclassical spec mansion at 1 Dorset Place in Dallas \u2014 complete with a pediment, a Diocletian window and an entablature above the front entrance \u2014 designed by Richard Drummond Davis Architects, another firm that specializes in classic architecture, which sold after asking $23 million.\nOverall, the top sales and listings of the state suggest a significant appetite among ultra-luxury buyers for homes that feel historic \u2014 pillars and pediments, quoins and quadrangles. If the Carrera marble floor was laid before World War II, all the better. If not, does it matter?\nAnd in a century, when Fusch, Davis and other neoclassical designers have acquired the patina of history, will it shield their work from the demands of Texas\u2019 elite?\nThe survival of the Crespi Estate through several record-setting sales and brushes with the bulldozer demonstrates the yin-and-yang relationship between the connoisseur and the developer in Texas. The estate could easily go to a buyer who envisions a bigger, better, bespoke home on 16 acres in Preston Hollow. At the same time, its value depends at least partially on such developers culling the competition for the right buyer\u2019s eye.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where I hope that they engage a great architect,\u201d Pogir said of buyers who demolish historic homes. \u201cSo at least they\u2019ve knocked something down of quality. They\u2019re putting something else up of quality.\u201d",

Shawn Todd\u2019s firm spent $460 million carving the project out of the long-vacant former First National Bank Tower.\nTodd Interests still owes about $230 million on the $245 million loan from Starwood, Todd told the Dallas Morning News.\nThe news comes at a difficult time for Downtown Dallas, which is still reeling from AT&amp;T\u2019s announcement of plans to move its headquarters from downtown to Plano. The foreclosure also follows Todd Interests\u2019 sale of its stake in the nearby East Quarter to J.P. Morgan Asset Management.\nThe Starwood loan makes up more than a quarter of the value of troubled loans in the Texas Triangle headed to auction this month. The sum totals $805 million, making February the third month in a row where the value of troubled CRE loans\ntops $800 million\nin Texas.\nHere are the biggest loans up for auction. It\u2019s possible that some of these borrowers and lenders will reach agreements to avoid auction.\nHouston\nThis month\u2019s largest new loan flagged for auction in Harris County is a nearly 150-acre swath of partially developed land zoned for industrial development. The property at 2012 Miller Cut Off Road in La Porte is the site of an old power plant. An entity tied to industrial developer Genover provided a $30 million loan for the property in 2022. The owner is St. Petersburg, Florida-based Trak Commercial. Loan documents dated Thursday show the owner secured new financing for the property, a $38.8 million loan from JGB Capital.\nAustin\nIt\u2019s been less than a year since Austin-based One Development secured a $14 million loan for townhome project Rosemark Woodland, and it\u2019s already being accused of default. The 27-unit Austin condo community, at 2209 Woodland Avenue, opened last year. Arixa provided the loan, which works out to just under $519,000 per condo.\nSan Antonio\nThe\nfallout from the passage of House Bill 21\ncontinues with the foreclosure of Acadia on the Lake Apartments, at 4031 Thousand Oaks Drive in San Antonio. David Shippy\u2019s Quantum Leap Property Management allegedly defaulted on a $31.3 million loan provided by CBRE in 2025 for the 304-unit property built in 1982. Quantum Leap faced foreclosure on another San Antonio apartment complex for the same reason just last month.\nQuantum Leap partnered with Edcouch Community Housing Finance Corporation to get property tax breaks on Acadia on the Lake Apartments, using a loophole known as a \u201ctraveling\u201d housing finance corporation. Quantum Leap sold the property to Edcouch, an affordable housing organization 250 miles from San Antonio, and leased the ground.\nGov. Greg Abbott signed a bill closing the loophole\n, which became a popular cost-cutting tool for multifamily syndicators and investors. Some appraisal districts have interpreted the new law as justification to remove tax credits for loophole users, even though the law gives operators a few years to come into compliance.\nDallas\nAs detailed above, the biggest troubled loan in Dallas this cycle is the one tied to The National. In addition to the financing from Starwood, the redevelopment project was buoyed by about $100 million in historic credits and $50 million in city tax increment financing. The project transformed the long-vacant skyscraper into a blend of apartments, hotel rooms, offices and retail.\nFort Worth\nVertical Street Ventures is facing foreclosure on The Sherry, a 252-unit apartment complex at 2208 East Park Row Drive in Arlington. ReadyCap provided the $24.4 million mortgage for the property in 2021. The debt on the property built in 1968 works out to $97,000 per unit.\nRepeat offenders\nOf the properties scheduled for auction, nine have been flagged for foreclosure multiple times, sometimes reflecting a loan modification or ongoing litigation. Here are the properties that have been on the block before:\nLatitude 2976\n, a 734-unit apartment complex at 201 and 301 Wilcrest Drive in Houston ($77.2 million loan);\nVeranda Village, a 330-unit apartment complex at 3536 Shaver Street in Pasadena ($47.2 million loan);\nThe Co-Op at the Med Center, a 199-unit apartment complex at 7710 Main Street in Houston ($25 million loan);\nSan Antonio Marriott Northwest Medical Center, at 3323 Northwest Loop 410 in San Antonio ($18.5 million loan)\nWyndham Garden Austin, at 3401 South Interstate 35 ($13.4 million loan);\nA 270,000-square-foot office building at 10777 Clay Road\u00a0 in Houston ($10.5 million loan);\nA retail building at 6610 Low Bid Lane home to Soccer Central in San Antonio ($10.5 million loan);\nMar Del Sol Apartments, a 248-unit building at 9303 Woodfair Drive in Houston ($10 million loan); and\nLa Bella Vista Apartments, a 152-unit complex at 3600 South Shaver Street in Houston ($9.2 million loan).\n",

The approval allows Minto to build a maximum of 13,270 dwelling units, with 11,880 single-family homes and 1,390 multifamily and mixed-use units \u2014 double the amount of single-family homes permitted under the land\u2019s former zoning, according to\ncity documents\n. Minto plans to include townhomes as well as apartments.\nThe yet-to-be-named community will be the largest residential and mixed-use development in the area, Minto said in a press release. Based on household occupancy estimates, the community could house up to 33,902 people, about 65 percent of Waxahachie\u2019s current population, according to the city council.\nThe land is mostly agricultural, but it also includes a Presbyterian Children\u2019s Homes and Services location and a smattering of single-family houses. Arizona-based land asset manager Walton Global currently owns most of the land. Minto has an agreement with Walton to purchase it, according to a memorandum filed with the county last year.\nDense development plans have led to controversy in the area recently. Local landowners sued another developer, Lillian Custom Homes, for allegedly violating deed restrictions that prevent more than two homes on any 5-acre tract in Oak Creek Ranch, a project underway just across FM 875.\nThe Supreme Court of Texas sided with the developer\nlast summer.\nMinto plans to include 400 acres of open space and parks, according to the release. The community will also include a middle school and multiple elementary schools, the company stated.\nTexas is a leading market for master-planned communities, hosting 20 of the top 50 best-selling communities in America in 2025, according to\nRCLCO\n.\nStarwood recently bought a portfolio of master-planned communities from Hines\n, including Myrtle Creek, a 1,260-acre community set to include 2,500 homes in Waxahachie.\n",

        "content": "The standoff in Boca Raton started with a prayer.\n\u201cAs we conduct the people\u2019s business here today, we pray that we do so with wisdom, maintaining a sense of proportion,\u201d Boca Raton City Council Member Andy Thomson said.\nThe call wasn\u2019t exactly answered.\nThomson was presiding over a city council meeting in February 2025 at which elected officials would select a partner for a major public-private redevelopment. By the end of the meeting, Thomson and the council unanimously approved a bid from Terra and Frisbie Group for a 2.5 million-square-foot multi-use project on Boca\u2019s aging government campus, 30 acres of public land. The vision was to transform Boca\u2019s downtown into a tropical modern transit-oriented mini metropolis fit for an emerging hub of wealth and commerce. It was called \u201cOne Boca.\u201d\nOne Boca had its skeptics. Where some saw a beautiful update, others saw a travesty of monstrous proportions. At issue was the project site, which included Boca\u2019s 17-acre Memorial Park, named in 1947 to honor World War II veterans. The current city hall, community center, two baseball fields, a skate park, shuffleboard courts, the Boca Raton Tennis Center and six beloved banyan trees all sit within Memorial Park.\nThe way Jon Pearlman saw it, \u201cthey were going to destroy all of that and build high-rise condos.\u201d\nPearlman, a resident and tennis player who knew the Memorial Park courts well, had never been involved in community organizing before One Boca. But after he started talking to neighbors, he chartered a\ngrassroots movement\n, gathering signatures for petitions to fight the project. He called it \u201cSave Boca.\u201d\n\u201cThe world is changing faster than it ever has before. We don\u2019t want to miss the future.\u201d\nCody Crowell, Frisbie Group\nCoconut Grove-based Terra, led by David Martin, has wrangled with public dissent before. So has its partner, the Palm Beach-based family firm Frisbie, led by Rob Frisbie Jr. and his brother-in-law Cody Crowell.\n\u201cIn the beginning, there were some very serious concerns that would resonate with a lot of people,\u201d Frisbie said, acknowledging the resistance around parkland preservation and honoring veterans.\nAs local development fights so often do, things got heated. Terra and Frisbie adapted plans to heed Save Boca\u2019s major concerns, but the group remained staunch in its opposition, Frisbie said. Decorum lapsed at tense city meetings. Lawsuits were filed. City officials, Terra, Frisbie, Pearlman and even appraisers were all at some point accused of ill intentions, of lying, of misleading \u201cthe people.\u201d\nBut allegations of compromised public servants and systems silenced a simpler truth: Boca was changing, and to many of its residents, it was too much, too fast.\nThe events that came next suggest that developer-community standoffs have reached a new pitch in an age of fraying truth and trust. Within six months of that first vote on the One Boca bid, wisdom and any sense of proportion were gone. A developer might note the rise of distrust and conspiratorial thinking elsewhere in society, but it\u2019s hard to prepare for when your project inspires the rallying cry to revolt.\nSeeing few other options, Terra, Frisbie and the city council agreed to a new approach. By the end of the summer they had conceded to send One Boca to a\nreferendum\n, leaving the future of the project up to the people.\n\u201cI hope that they take the time to consider the facts and vote their conscience,\u201d Mayor Scott Singer said.\nThe vote is set for Tuesday, March 10.\nH\now it started\nBoca had been looking at redeveloping its government campus for years. The facilities are more than 30 years old and have damage from floods. The city\u2019s bidding process for the project pitted titans of South Florida real estate against one another.\nMartin\u2019s Terra and Frisbie teamed up on a proposal. Also in the mix was Related Ross, the West Palm Beach-based Goliath helmed by billionaire Steve Ross.\nMartin is no amateur, but he was sidling up to Ross on his home turf. For Frisbie and Crowell, the campus redevelopment was an opportunity to level up. The company, founded by Frisbie\u2019s father and uncles, has historically focused on small, luxury projects: spec homes, townhomes, a boutique resort in the Florida Keys. The second generation has grander ambitions. They have partnered with 1789 Capital on a $1 billion real estate investment fund and are planning another project with Martin with more than 1,000 residential units.\nThey had some early stumbles. In 2021, they partnered with Hines to buy a West Palm Beach development site and planned a Robert A.M. Stern-designed condo project now known as South Flagler House. After a legal spat with Two Roads Development, the partners sold the project to Steve Ross for $194.6 million. The Frisbie Group\u2019s Suzanne Frisbie is leading sales with the Corcoran Group at the project. In 2024, the family sought to redevelop a rare 5.8-acre Palm Beach site, but local pushback killed the project.\nOne Boca represents an untested scale and scope for the Frisbies, a project that could establish them on the new path.\nTheir initial vision for One Boca spanned a 30-acre city-owned site at 201 West Palmetto Park Road. Designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox, the architecture firm that envisioned Hudson Yards in New York and Covent Garden in London, it would have 250,000 square feet of offices, 157,000 square feet of retail, 1,129 residential units, a 150-key hotel and 3,434 parking spaces, all adjacent to the city\u2019s Brightline station.\nThe developers would replace the existing city hall with one totaling 100,000 square feet, as well as a 50,600-square-foot community center. In this iteration of the proposal, the city planned to sign a 99-year lease with Terra and Frisbie, with the developers paying $5.1 million in annual rent. Their projections showed the developers paying the city more than $3 billion over the course of the lease.\nGlossy renderings showed a smooth, bright, lushly landscaped civic center packed with pedestrians relishing the spectacular Boca of tomorrow.\n\u201cThe world is changing faster than it ever has before,\u201d Crowell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to miss the future.\u201d\nT\nhe future is Florida\nThe pandemic instigated a generational boom in South Florida. In Boca, single-family home prices nearly doubled in a five-year span. A town that 60 years ago did not have a hospital was becoming a magnet for billionaires who liked the low taxes and private airport.\nThis spurred a wave of real estate investment unparalleled almost anywhere in the country. Residents in Boca watched what happened as developers poured billions into projects across the region, with particular concentration in Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach. Some didn\u2019t want to be part of the wave.\n\u201cBoca Raton is not what West Palm Beach is becoming,\u201d Pearlman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a Fort Lauderdale and it\u2019s not a Miami.\u201d\nThe sartorial signature of his opposition movement is a graphic T-shirt in stark white with a bright green block around the navy text: SAVE BOCA. Every email, flyer and blog post from the organization comes bolded, in all caps, seeming to mimic the urgent, assertive speaking style of the group\u2019s founder.\nSpeaking from the podium is new for Pearlman, who works in investment management. The former Harvard tennis player also started a fitness brand, Mission Lean, with his wife Lyudmila Bouzinova, a one-time \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Top Model\u201d contestant.\nHe has compared the One Boca project to destroying Central Park. On Save Boca\u2019s YouTube channel, a video of AI-generated bulldozers plowing down Memorial Park\u2019s banyan trees has more than 80,000 views.\nAfter its launch, Save Boca issued two nearly identical petitions. They called for city ordinance and charter amendments that would restrict the city\u2019s ability to lease and sell its public lands. Under Save Boca\u2019s proposed laws, decisions concerning public parcels half an acre or larger would require a referendum.\nThis would mean that nearly every public land use decision would require mobilizing the electorate. City officials raised the alarm.\n\u201cIf the ordinance proposed by this petition had been in place, Boca Raton would\u2019ve lost out on our new Blue Lake Elementary School and more than a thousand needed student seats,\u201d Singer, the mayor, wrote in a statement in July.\nThrough the summer, support for Save Boca swelled. By September, Pearlman had thousands of signatures, although the precise count is a source of debate between the Save Boca and One Boca camps. Pearlman claims Save Boca has 12,900 supporters throughout the city. According to Singer, that is a double count of about 6,000 people who signed both petitions.\nAfter submitting the petitions to send his proposals to a vote, Pearlman started expanding his political movement. He launched a campaign for city council in October, running against incumbent Marc Widger, a consistent supporter of One Boca. The mounting support for the Save Boca laws inspired concerns from a new entrant: locals who feared the consequences of handicapping city decisionmaking. In November, attorney Ned Kimmelman filed suit against Pearlman and Save Boca, seeking an emergency injunction to block the referendums concerning the public land use rules.\n\u201cSave Boca and Pearlman are conducting an audacious scheme to evade Florida law and abuse our electoral process in Palm Beach County and the City,\u201d the lawsuit read.\nWithin a few weeks, the judge granted the injunction. Kimmelman responded to the decision in a letter to the editor published in the Boca Raton Tribune.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t use an atomic bomb to kill a single government project or anything else, for that matter, because it will kill you, too,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTo the good people who got snookered and almost destroyed our city, they need to read the tale of the Pied Piper of Hamelin because it almost happened to them, to all of us. Jon Pearlman and all of the Save Boca founders cannot be permitted to run for public office.\u201d\nThe lawsuit is ongoing. Like so many elements of the battle over One Boca, the divergent sides disagree on the details. They give alternating reasons for why the judge granted the injunction, and whether Pearlman\u2019s proposed laws were themselves legal.\nAsked why he thinks Kimmelman sued him, Pearlman said, \u201cI have no idea about his motivations, but everything he alleges is false.\u201d\nF\nacts and fictions\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Terra, Frisbie or the Boca electeds have encountered unhappy communities. Developers have playbooks for this kind of fight: collaborate, make concessions, give back.\n\u201cOne of his main attributes, especially when dealing with government, is listening to what the other side needs, and trying to get them what they need,\u201d Bilzin Sumberg attorney Suzanne Amaducci said of Martin, Terra\u2019s head, in\nThe Real Deal\nprofile\nof Martin from 2024.\nAgainst the backdrop of Save Boca\u2019s allegations and demands, Terra and Frisbie have altered their proposal, keeping it alive. In September, they\nreduced the scale\nof the project, and in October, they shrunk it again.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the mega project has necessarily gone miniature. The 99-year lease between the city and the developers includes 7.8 acres, and One Boca will cover 538,000 square feet. The plans include 120,000 square feet of office, a 30,000-square-foot grocery store, 765 apartments, a 180-key hotel and 2,100 parking spaces. Terra and Frisbie are also in contract to buy the adjacent 0.8-acre site at 140 Northwest 4th Street, where they plan a 182-unit condominium. Recreation and green space increases from 7.6 acres to 15.6 acres. Projections now show One Boca generating $4 billion in revenue for the city from rent and tax revenues over the life of the deal. Terra and Frisbie have also agreed to maintain their contributions to Boca even if Gov. Ron DeSantis is successful in his push to abolish property taxes. Under the latest plan, the city will lead the redesign of Memorial Park and its playgrounds, tennis courts and other recreational uses. It would also include a dedicated veterans memorial. The baseball fields would be relocated, as would the police department\u2019s headquarters. The Memorial Park site would still include a\nredeveloped\ncity hall, community center and police substation.\nOn Jan. 20, seven weeks before the referendum, the city council voted to approve the Master Partnership Agreement (MPA) with Terra and Frisbie, officially sending this proposal to the March ballot.\nBut the changes have done nothing to sway Pearlman, who continues to assert that the developers aren\u2019t preserving the park. He also suggests Boca has plenty of money to redevelop city hall on its own, claiming it has more than $600 million in the bank, which Singer denies.\n\u201cThe city could not pay for these improvements just from existing funds,\u201d he said. Without a public private partnership, Boca would need to raise taxes, do a bond or cut funding for services to afford the needed updates.\nAs of publication, both sides are projecting confidence.\n\u200b\u200b\u201cThe fate of this project could very well shape the entire future of this city,\u201d Pearlman said. He still maintains that Terra and Frisbie will bulldoze the banyans, cut off access to Memorial Park and inflate the revenue benefits for the city.\n\u201cSome people just live in a state of confusion,\u201d Frisbie\u2019s Crowell said. \u201cThe other side has not been listening.\u201d\nHe insists the developers are listening to citizens. \u201cPeople can trust us.\u201d",

The property, at 1775, 1757 and 1751 Collins Avenue, includes the historic Raleigh hotel. Developer Michael Shvo and his partners exited the project. One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty previously handled sales.\nThe new sales team is made up of Compass agents Miltiadis Kastanis, Pablo Alfaro, Ivan Chorney, Michael Martirena and Liz Hogan, according to a news release. Morgan Ball, senior managing director of Florida for Compass\u2019 development marketing arm, and Kastanis were involved in securing the deal starting last year.\nKastanis, who\nleft Douglas Elliman nearly a year ago\n, said the sales team will focus on buyers and brokers who appreciate and understand the project.\n\u201cThe brokerage community becomes your buyer,\u201d he said. \u201cOne thing that will have changed is the sales approach. As much as it will be private and exclusive, it\u2019s going to be approachable.\u201d\nThe developer will announce a sales director and timeline to re-launch sales at a later date. Ball, who moved to Miami late last year, said Compass has a \u201clong and extensive\u201d history with Nahla.

        "content": "\u201c\nI\nt\u2019s a long way down.\u201d\nWhen Cedar Street Partners\u2019\nJonathan Curtis\nsaid this to a guest peering over the edge of the 20th floor patio at a Glendale co-working space, it was hard not to hear something deeper.\nCedar Street just came out victorious in a multi-year saga with the city of\nLa Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge\n, winning the first successful builder\u2019s remedy case in\nCalifornia Superior Court\nfor its 80-unit mixed-use project at 600 Foothill Boulevard and setting a path for other developers to build.\nBut the fight may have left its scars, in time, stress and now soured relationships with some officials.\nStill, there was an enormous payoff. The Foothill project set new case law and is now viewed as a warning to municipalities that this isn\u2019t the time to mess around with the state\u2019s pro-housing goals. The La Ca\u00f1ada mayor at the time of the Foothill project settlements, Mike Davitt, referred questions to current Mayor Kim Bowman. Bowman declined to comment for this story.\nBy the time it won city council approval last year, the Cedar Street development ultimately had the backing of Gov.\nGavin Newsom\nand state Attorney General Rob Bonta, who have been focused in their pursuit of more housing.\nNow, Curtis, a 25-year La Ca\u00f1ada resident who once sat on the city council, is looking at draft plans of the project, excited to show off the designs as Cedar Street lines up capital and considers its building materials.\n\u201cNow, there\u2019s the will to enforce.\u201d\nJonathan Curtis, Cedar Street Partners\n\u201cIf you were to look back during the time I was on the council and housing elements were a requirement under the state, the [California Department of Housing and Community Development, or HCD] and others didn\u2019t have the tools to enforce it, and there wasn\u2019t the will to enforce it,\u201d Curtis said.\n\u201cNow, there\u2019s the will to enforce.\u201d\nSpurred by a governor who wants action on housing development, builder\u2019s remedy project proposals have surged in the past few years. But getting a project through the legal system isn\u2019t easy, which is why the Cedar Street win matters so much.\nCurtis\u2019s \u201clong way down\u201d is apt, since the story starts in 1969, when California required cities and counties to map out long-term housing plans for residents at various income levels. Known as housing elements, these plans are part of local governments\u2019 general plans and get updated either every five or eight years; the HCD must approve them.\nThe period when a housing element is awaiting certification is especially filled with possibility for developers. Until a plan has approval, developers can bypass local zoning laws and file what\u2019s known as a builder\u2019s remedy project application. This \u201cremedy\u201d has been possible since 1990 but was rarely used until recently.\nThough discord among developers, local governments and residents over control of local land-use decisions continues, the Cedar Street win is a clear sign of California\u2019s direction: The state can dictate local development and land use.\nThe rest of the nation, grappling with a housing shortage, is watching how this will play out.\nB\nuilding on\nt\nheir own terms\nThink of the parties to housing element plans as three legs on a stool: developers, residents and city councils.\nAt various points, any of their perspectives could be considered right in a theoretical argument. But under Newsom, the winning position is whichever gets moving on housing starts.\nThe case law set with the Cedar Street win crystallizes that point. In the event housing law and the interpretation of builder\u2019s remedy wasn\u2019t clear, Bonta made sure to attach the Foothill project court decision to a June legal alert sent to all 539 jurisdictions in the state.\nThis reality has made its way to local lawmakers.\n\u201cThe production of housing is very important to HCD,\u201d Bryan Swanson, community development director in Saratoga, said in November. He was advising the city council in the Santa Clara County city to accept a memorandum of understanding with a developer called City Connect Real Estate Development. The state approved Saratoga\u2019s housing element in July 2024, with the plan, good through 2031, identifying a need for 1,712 additional homes. In the time before the housing element\u2019s approval, developers clamored to get their builder\u2019s remedy applications in, and the city faced more than 20 proposed projects.\nThe agreement Swanson suggested had to do with a project known as Vineyard One. The proposed idea was to take the unit count from 231 to 64. In exchange for the approval, City Connect would eventually pull its builder\u2019s remedy application.\nCouncil members wanted to know whether the smaller unit count could lead to a decertification of the city\u2019s housing element.\nSwanson explained that the 64-unit proposal would be in compliance; approving it was the \u201cfastest way to get to the end zone,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cThey want to see units entitled.\u201d\nA different approach was taken in Yorba Linda, the north Orange County birthplace of Richard Nixon, where horseback riders can be seen on more than 100 miles of trails.\nIn 2024, the residents of Yorba Linda voted on zoning changes called Measure JJ before the city\u2019s housing element was certified by the state. The city council wanted locals to embrace the overarching plan so they felt like they had a say in what was ultimately developed. At the same time, the measure, which passed with over 90 percent of the vote, let the council fulfill state requirements. The city, which did not respond to requests for comment, essentially headed off any public backlash to increased density or the possibility of a builder\u2019s remedy project by embracing development on its own terms.\nW\nhat remedy?\nNot every municipality has found such a win-win-win.\nHuntington Beach\nhas fought with the state over the constitutionality of a housing element in so-called charter cities, even though the city doesn\u2019t have a specific builder\u2019s remedy project it\u2019s trying to fight.\nIn December, the California Supreme Court refused to review a lower court decision on whether Huntington Beach\u2019s status as a charter city offered it a loophole to bypass the need for a housing element. The decision kicked the case back to San Diego Superior Court, with a judge telling the city to have its housing element done in 120 days.\nNewsom seized on the win, accusing the city of \u201cpathetic NIMBY behavior.\u201d\nIn the coastal Orange County city of\nNewport Beach\n, residents want to reduce the overall unit count of their state-approved housing element, even if it puts them out of compliance.\n\u201cWe want to honor what the state is doing. We\u2019re all pulling on the same oar, so we\u2019re not trying to be a rogue city at all.\u201d\nMarshall Duffield, Newport Beach Stewardship Association and former Newport Beach mayor\nThe current plan requires that Newport Beach add more than 8,000 units by 2030, which the state approved in October 2022 after several rounds of edits with the housing department.\nBut residents cried foul over the plan, arguing it went against the voter-approved Greenlight Initiative of 2000, which requires a referendum on any major land use or zoning decision.\nThe issue will now go on November\u2019s ballot as the Responsible Housing Initiative, which would reduce future housing requirements to less than 3,000 units.\nIt took about a week to gather enough signatures to get the initiative on the ballot, said Marshall \u201cDuffy\u201d Duffield, a member of the Newport Beach Stewardship Association and a former Newport Beach mayor. If shopping center and other property managers had allowed signature collectors on site, he thinks it could have been done faster.\nPassing the initiative would help the city avoid builder\u2019s remedy applications, Duffield argued, though it\u2019s unclear if the change would lead to the city falling out of compliance since it has an approved housing element. The city and HCD did not respond to an inquiry on the matter.\nThe initiative would give the community one thing it wants: less congestion. On a Thursday in January, Duffield was running late to his office thanks to traffic on two miles of Pacific Coast Highway. The congestion is an example of the lack of infrastructure, Duffield pointed out. With roads like this now, how could the city bring in more residents?\nStill, he concedes on the larger goal.\n\u201cWe want to honor what the state is doing,\u201d Duffield said. \u201cWe\u2019re all pulling on the same oar, so we\u2019re not trying to be a rogue city at all.\u201d\nAvoiding the fight sounds like a smart strategy to Curtis.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of ill feelings,\u201d Curtis said, reflecting on the past few years. \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult but hopefully it\u2019s making a positive dent in the housing crisis and, bottom line, the economy.\u201d",

        "content": "After a record December, Manhattan\u2019s office market hit a seasonal slowdown in January.\nManhattan\u2019s leasing activity totaled almost 3.7 million square feet, down nearly 30 percent from December but a slight increase year over year, according to a new Colliers report. The drop was not surprising, as January declines occurred in six of the past ten years, and December posted the\nhighest monthly leasing volume since 2019\n, per Colliers.\nMidtown nabbed the top two deals, led by law firm Gibson Dunn\u2019s 362,000-square-foot renewal at Irvine Company\u2019s MetLife Building. Landlord BXP scored the second-largest deal, Global insurance and investment firm C.V. Starr\u2019s\n274,000-square-foot new lease\nat 343 Madison Avenue, per Colliers. The third-largest was Burlington Stores\u2019 206,000-square-foot extension and expansion at Empire State Realty Trust\u2019s\n1400 Broadway\nin Midtown South.\nThe availability rate tightened to 13.5 percent, marking the 23rd consecutive month of stable or decreasing supply. Sublet supply fell for the 16th straight month to 10.7 million square feet, a 38 percent year-over-year decrease and the lowest since September 2019. Asking rents averaged $77 per square foot, up about 5 percent year over year, but still about 3 percent below March 2020.\nMidtown captured 47 percent of the month\u2019s activity as availability crept almost back to March 2020 levels, when it was only 7.7 percent lower. Midtown South followed a similar trend, with large deals helping push leasing activity almost 73 percent above the ten-year average. Despite leasing lagging, even Downtown sublet space tightened to its lowest point since mid-2020, while rents rose to levels not seen since February 2021, per Colliers.\nManhattan was coming off a hot quarter, posting its strongest results since before the pandemic. Leasing activity jumped more than 25 percent quarter over quarter at the end of last year.\n",

        "content": "Henry Elghanayan\u2019s Rockrose Development is back to pick up what it left behind at Long Island College Hospital\u2019s former Cobble Hill site.\nRockrose is in contract to buy a Brooklyn city block from an entity tied to LICH and SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, PincusCo\nreported\n. The $100 million contract is subject to approval from the New York State Attorney General\u2019s office, due to the nonprofit involved.\nThe 258,000-square-foot building stretches across four parcels: 363 Hicks Street, 365 Hicks Street, 97 Amity Street and 340 Henry Street. It last traded hands in 2011 for $44.3 million, though the city valued it at $120.7 million in 2022.\nA representative from SUNY Downstate did not immediately respond to a request for comment from\nThe Real\nDeal\n. Rockrose could not be reached.\nLess than two years ago, Rockrose bought 91-95 Pacific Street \u2014 just north of the latest pending acquisition \u2014 from Madison Realty Capital\nfor $65 million\n. Previous plans at the site called for a condominium project, which Rockrose did not confirm would be in the offing.\nThere\u2019s been plenty of controversy around the larger LICH holding.\nFortis Property Group\nsold\nthe Pacific Street site, along with 350 Hicks Street, to Madison Realty in October 2022 to avoid foreclosure. Fortis planned to build two condo buildings with a total of 150 units, most of which would be at the Pacific Street site.\nMadison, the project\u2019s lender, initiated a UCC foreclosure on the equity interests in the sites after Fortis defaulted on $47.7 million in debt, but the parties reached a settlement; Madison held onto the Hicks Street site for the time being, but it\u2019s unclear if it\u2019s changed hands since.\nFortis bought the former hospital campus from the State University of New York\nin 2015 for $240 million\nafter state officials voted to close the hospital, which had been operating for more than 150 years.\nFortis later abandoned plans to rezone the site after failing to come to terms with then-City Council member Brad Lander, who sought robust affordable housing, a school and other community benefits. The developer instead pursued a plan to build a smaller, market-rate project that required no political approval.\nSubsequently, Fortis and SUNY\naccused\neach other of failing to fulfill their obligations under the 2015 sale. The university system sued Fortis for failing to close on the second phase of the deal. Fortis, in response, said SUNY should have covered costs associated with construction delays, which the developer blamed for holding up 2 River Park.\nThere are still two active court cases related to the dispute, though they aren\u2019t expected to hold up the sale.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Michael Shvo\u2019s Mandarin Oriental Residences\nare getting a new sales team \u2014 and new pricing.\nA Serhant team led by Peter Zaitzeff and Glenn Davis is taking over sales at the building in the latest bid to breathe life back into the 65-unit project, which has sold just about one-third of its condos since launching in 2021.\nThe newly priced units feature steep discounts. A two-bedroom is now listed for just $5.3 million, down more than 12 percent from its original asking price, while a one-bedroom unit spanning over 1,000 square feet is asking $4.25 million, after it was priced at almost $6 million in the property\u2019s offering plan.\n\u201cWe want to trade those things close to where we listed them, and I think we can, because we reduced significantly,\u201d Zaitzeff said of the new pricing.\nA Douglas Elliman team led by Jade Chan and Alexander Boriskin had previously overseen sales at the building.\nThe latest sales revamp comes\nafter it was reported last fall\nthat Shvo and other investors, including Deutsche Finance America and German pension fund Bayerische Versorgungskammer, hired Eastdil Secured to try and unload the unsold condos in a bulk deal.\nZaitzeff said that while there\u2019s always the opportunity for a bulk sale of the remaining units, \u201cthe goal here is to sell these to the general public.\u201d\nIn September 2024, the project\u2019s developers secured a\n$120 million inventory loan\nfrom Northwind Group for the building\u2019s unsold condos. At the time, just 15 condos had sold at the project, which had a projected sellout of $340 million. The building still has 45 units left to sell.\nRepresentatives for Shvo and DFA did not respond to requests for comment. Northwind CEO Ran Eliasaf said the new sales team was brought in to \u201cexecute on the business plan.\u201d\nShvo and his partners bought what was\nformerly known as the Gucci building\nfor $135 million in 2018, and converted the office portion of the building into condos while adding five floors of residences. The condo is the first residential-only property managed by Mandarin Oriental on the East Coast, and gives residents access to a private restaurant and bar run by Daniel Boulud.\nIn 2024, two buyers alleged the finishes in their $6 million one-bedroom condo fell short of the agreed-upon plans in a lawsuit filed in New York. A judge dismissed Shvo as an individual defendant. The case is still pending.\nWhile Shvo tries to make good on his investment at 685 Fifth, the rest of his portfolio remains in turmoil.\nShvo sold the Raleigh Rosewood Residences, a condo and hotel project in Miami Beach, for\n$270 million\nin October to Nahla Capital, despite his efforts to match their offer.\u00a0 The new owners\ntapped Compass\nto lead sales and marketing at the project.\nHe also defaulted on a $200 million loan at the\nMandarin Oriental in Beverly Hills\n, leading to a sale-in-lieu-of-foreclosure, and is entangled in a messy lawsuit with Core Club, which sued him in November and\naccused him\nof being involved in a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) conspiracy.\nMost recently, rumors have swirled that Shvo is in line to lose the\nTransamerica Pyramid\n, one of the eye-catching pieces of the San Francisco skyline. A spokesperson for Shvo told\nThe Real Deal\nthose rumors are \u201cfalse.\u201d\nThe building is home to a bright spot for Shvo, after landing what the developer has claimed is a West Coast rent record. An anonymous tenant agreed to pay $300 per square foot for approximately 4,000 square feet on the building\u2019s 44th floor, the San Francisco Chronicle reported earlier this month. The property was 85 percent leased as of December.\n",

        "content": "Some of Manhattan\u2019s marquee properties are reeling in marquee loans. From rent-stabilized megacomplexes and trophy office condos to supertall towers and converted office blocks, lenders wrote nine-figure (and one ten-figure) checks to refinance, reset or reposition some of the city\u2019s most closely watched properties. December\u2019s top deals spanned neighborhoods and property types, but all involved high-profile buildings with well-capitalized owners.\nAll told, lenders on the five largest deals in Manhattan parted ways with almost $5.6 billion.\nHere are more details.\nStuy Town shuffle | $3.15B | Stuyvesant Town\nWells Fargo\nprovided a $3.15 billion loan to refinance Blackstone\u2019s Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village as a $3 billion debt from Fannie Mae backing Manhattan\u2019s largest apartment complex was nearing maturity. Since purchasing the complex alongside a Canadian pension fund for $5.5 billion in 2015, Blackstone has invested $460 million into the property. That includes renovations, expansions and the installation of 9,600 solar panels. All of the 11,250 units are rent-stabilized.\nConversion cash-in | $835M | Financial District\nApollo and GIC\nprovided an $835 million loan to refinance 25 Water Street, the 1,320-unit\noffice-to-residential conversion\nby GFP Real Estate, Metro Loft and Rockwood Capital. The fresh financing replaced\na $536 million loan\nfrom Michael Dell\u2019s MSD Partners and Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance. At the time in 2022, the loan was the largest for an office-to-residential conversion in United States history. Leasing began at the former 1.1 million-square-foot office property \u2014 dubbed SoMA for South Manhattan \u2014 in the last days of January 2025 and move-ins began the following month.\nSupertall haul | $640M | Midtown\nCarlyle Group\nprovided a $640 million condo inventory loan for Rabina\u2019s supertall at 520 Fifth Avenue. The fresh financing replaces a $540 million construction loan from Bank OZK and Carlyle\u2019s Global Credit business as the mixed-use tower transitions to leasing and sales. The 1,000-foot project located near the Empire State Building now stands as the tallest tower on Fifth Avenue in that stretch of Midtown. The property combines 25 floors of offices and 100 luxury condominiums.\nCondo sales\nlaunched in April 2024 and the building\u2019s private club, Moss, opened in November and the offices are open for tenant move-ins.\nKKR ca-ching | $500M | Hudson Yards\nBank of America\nprovided a $500 million loan to KKR for two office condominiums at 30 Hudson Yards. The fresh financing replaced a $490 million loan from Deutsche Bank. KKR purchased the top 10 office floors of the building, spanning about 343,000 square feet, in 2015 and moved its corporate offices there. It later inked a\n220,000-square-foot lease\nfor space vacated by Facebook parent company Meta Platforms. The company also\nbought a majority stake\nin the observation deck \u2013 the tallest outdoor deck in the Western hemisphere \u2013 for more than $500 million in 2021.\nRetail refi | $450M | Midtown\nCredit Agricole\nprovided a $450 million loan for the retail portion of 715-717 Fifth Avenue after Kering sold a 60 percent stake in the property to private equity firm Ardian. Kering bought the 115,000-square-foot property about two years ago from Jeff Sutton and SL Green\nfor $963 million\n. The parent company of Gucci, Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen scored $690 million in proceeds in the deal, which valued the property at $900 million. Kering has been looking to offload properties to improve its balance sheet after its debt soared to approximately $12 billion at the end of 2024.\n",

        "content": "A unit at\nCentral Park Tower\nscored the priciest contract in Manhattan last week, just beating out a unit at another building by Gary Barnett\u2019s firm at 50 West 66th Street, according to Olshan Realty.\nUnit 82E at Central Park Tower had a last asking price of $26.7 million, which was reduced from $34.5 million, the price included in the property\u2019s offering plan. Spanning almost 4,300 square feet, the apartment features four bedrooms and four full bathrooms. Nearly all of the floor-to-ceiling windows have views of the park.\nThe tower has over 50,000 square feet of amenities, including indoor and outdoor pools, a fitness center and a 100th-floor club room that comes with a ballroom, bar, dining and cigar lounge.\nAn in-house Extell team led by Gabriele Tonini and Tim Rizzo is heading sales, alongside a team from Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group helmed by Kane Manera and Janet Wang.\nThe 1,550-foot-tall building, marketed as the tallest residential building in the world, has seen a number of units close after steep discounts. Another unit on the building\u2019s E line, 84E, closed over two years ago for $25 million, according to Olshan.\nA\n116th full-floor\nunit closed for $46 million last year, down $7 million from its last asking price and almost $20 million from its initial price listed in the developer\u2019s offering plan. Another unit spanning the entire 121st floor closed for $47.5 million in November after dropping its asking price to\n$55 million\nfrom the more than $65 million listed in the offering plan.\nThe second most expensive contract signed last week went to Unit 43S at\n50 West 66th\n, another Extell tower. The home was asking almost $24 million.\nThe four-bedroom, four-bathroom condo spans roughly 3,500 square feet. Its living room has ceilings stretching over 14 feet and faces Central Park. Prices at the 70-story building have tended to go the other way compared to Central Park Tower; unit 43S originally asked just over $22 million in the building\u2019s original offering plan.\nAn in-house team from Extell Marketing Group, a team from Douglas Elliman led by Janice Chang and Timothy Hsu and a team from Corcoran led by Beth Benalloul and Hilary Landis are overseeing sales at the building. Chang brought the buyer for the deal at unit 43S.\nExtell has also created a number of supersized units, which have scored some of the priciest sales in the building, like\nUnit 41E\n, a 7,000-square-foot, six-bedroom apartment that closed for over $46 million in December.\nThe building includes 50,000 square feet of amenities, including indoor and outdoor pools, squash, basketball and pickleball courts and a porte-cochere entrance.\nLast week saw 33 contracts signed in Manhattan for homes asking at least $4 million, up from\n23 in the previous period\n. Twenty-five condos snagged deals, along with five co-ops, one cond-op and three townhouses.\nThe January luxury market in Manhattan ended roughly in line with last year. There were 103 contracts signed for $885 million this year, compared to 96 contracts signed for $896 million last year.\n",

        "content": "Flagstar Bank eked out its first\nprofitable quarter\nsince narrowly avoiding collapse in 2024, a milestone driven by aggressive cuts to its multifamily and commercial real estate loan book.\nThe lender reported $21 million in net income in the fourth quarter, swinging from a $45 million loss the prior quarter, according to an earnings report posted Friday. For all of last year, Flagstar still lost $177 million, but that was a sharp improvement from its roughly $1 billion loss the year before, Bisnow\nreported\n.\nWall Street wasn\u2019t expecting the comeback quite so soon; Flagstar posted $557 million in quarterly revenue, beating consensus estimates by about 4 percent, while earnings per share came in at 5 cents, ahead of projections. The stock nonetheless slipped about 1 percent midday Friday, a sign investors remain wary of what\u2019s left on the balance sheet.\nThat caution isn\u2019t unfounded. Flagstar still has about $3 billion in troubled loans and remains deeply entangled in New York City\u2019s rent-stabilized housing market, long a core business line for New York Community Bancorp and Signature Bank before both ran aground.\nAt the end of 2023, Flagstar \u2014 built on the husk of NYCB \u2014 held $50.6 billion in commercial real estate loans. By the end of last year, that figure had fallen to $38.3 billion. In the fourth quarter, Flagstar shed $2.3 billion of CRE exposure, including $1.5 billion tied to multifamily.\nSince early 2024, the bank has reviewed 97 percent of its New York City rent-regulated loan book, which totals $14.6 billion today. More than $9 billion is backed by buildings where at least half the units are regulated. Nonaccrual loans in that portfolio stand at $2 billion.\nFlagstar has logged $1.7 billion in payoffs and $375 million in charge-offs tied to those loans, while boosting its allowance for credit losses to 5.6 percent.\nOne particularly painful example of the rent-stabilized market\u2019s impact was a $564 million loan tied to more than 5,000 rent-stabilized apartments formerly owned by Pinnacle Group. The properties were sold in a bankruptcy auction, costing the bank a roughly $113 million write-down.\nThe political backdrop remains a wild card. Mayor Zohran Mamdani pledged to freeze rents for stabilized units, a move that would further strain landlords\u2019 ability to service debt. Flagstar executives said they\u2019re modeling scenarios with flat rents and rising expenses and closely scrutinizing borrowers with outstanding violations.\nStill, management signaled it isn\u2019t abandoning commercial real estate altogether. As it works through legacy New York exposure, Flagstar plans to selectively ramp up originations in markets like Michigan, California and Florida.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The deal is expected to close in the spring, but will need court approval.\nThe contracted buyers are the Rockefeller Group and Atlas Capital Group, which are paying $96 million for the property. They plan to preserve the church and rectory, but convert other parts of the facility into housing.\nThe developers will take advantage of the 485x tax abatement program, which mandates 25 percent of the units built to be affordable. The amount of units set to be developed, however, was not disclosed. The project is also expected to have residential amenities and retail space.\nThis is just the latest example of the church shrinking its portfolio, partially in an effort to compensate victims of abuse from the clergy; in December, Cardinal Timothy Dolan told parishioners that the church would keep liquidating real estate to fill a widening financial hole tied to settlements.\nAt that time, the Archdiocese\nagreed to sell\nthe ground lease under the Lotte New York Palace for $490 million to the luxury hotel operator.\nIn July, the church unloaded its longtime headquarters at 1011 First Avenue to Vanbarton Group for $103 million; Vanbarton plans to\nconvert\nthe office tower to residential.\nAn Archdiocese spokesperson said the 1011 First Avenue proceeds could also be routed toward the global settlement as the Church continues to mine its portfolio to meet obligations.\nAtlas Capital is off to a busy start this year, having recently\npurchased\nthe 13-story, 130-unit former \u201cRed Square\u201d multifamily rental building at 250 East Houston Street for $112 million from Dermot Company and Rockwood Capital.\nMeanwhile, the Rockefeller Group recently\nexpanded\ninto the Pacific Northwest with the acquisition of a new 187,000-square-foot warehouse.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "University of Miami booster John Ruiz listed his waterfront Gables Estates mansion for $175 million, marking the second most expensive listing in Miami-Dade.\nRuiz, founder and CEO of Coral Gables-based MSP Recovery,\npaid $46 million\nfor the 2.2-acre property at 600-620 Arvida Parkway in 2020. He\u2019s now looking to sell it for nearly four times that price.\nThe nearly 15,000-square-foot estate includes 10 bedrooms, 14 bathrooms and two half-baths, a two-bedroom guest house, staff quarters, a gym, spa, salon, speakeasy lounge, a wine cellar, an eight-car garage, a pool and dock. It also has a panic room and backup generators, according to the listing.\nThe tropical modern mansion was built in 2017 and expanded in 2022, records show. It was designed by architect Cesar Molina.\nThe property, which includes 335 feet of water frontage, is on the market with Mocca Realty\u2019s Alex Pirez, who also brokered the previous sale.\nRuiz\u2019s insurance claims company was the target of a three-year Securities and Exchange Commission investigation over issues that included the company\u2019s projected financial results to investors. The\nMiami Herald\nreported in late September that the SEC completed its investigation and it did not plan to pursue legal action.\nRuiz has also spent millions of dollars endorsing University of Miami student athletes. In 2021, Ruiz acquired the Cigarette Racing Team brand.\nHis Gables Estates property marks the fifth most expensive listing in Florida, according to\nRealtor.com\n.\nGables Estates is one of the waterfront neighborhoods in Miami that has recently benefitted from a boom in ultra-luxury sales.\nLast year, Pirez, a luxury homebuilder, sold his waterfront Gables Estates mansion at 340 Leucadendra Drive\nfor $55 million\n. That deal marked a record for home sales in Coral Gables.\nBillionaire businessman Jorge Mas recently purchased a mansion in the same gated community, on Casuarina Concourse,\nfor $75 million\n, a source previously told\nThe Real Deal.\n",

        "content": "Developers in Los Angeles have been some of the most active in erecting affordable housing across the country in the post-pandemic years.\nLos Angeles\nranked\nseventh nationwide for affordable housing between 2020 and 2024, Westside Today reported, citing a new report from RentCafe. A total of 9,406 income-restricted apartments were completed in Los Angeles in the post-Covid period, accounting for approximately 20.5 percent of all apartment construction in the L.A. metro area in those years.\nOf the country\u2019s 20 largest affordable housing markets, Los Angeles has one of the highest proportions of income-restricted units to overall new construction, according to RentCafe\u2019s analysis. About one-third of new apartment development in New York City and\nSan Francisco was for affordable units\n; by contrast, about 5 percent of new construction in Dallas consists of income-restricted housing. Seattle\nclaimed\nthe top spot with 14,290 new affordable units constructed between 2020 and 2024.\nAffordable housing development has been rapidly picking up speed in recent years, per the RentCafe report. Between 2020 and 2024, the number of affordable units completed represented a 79.5 percent increase compared to the previous five-year period between 2015 and 2019.\nExecutive Directive 1\n, enacted by Mayor Karen Bass in late 2022, has helped kick affordable housing development into high gear. The directive expedites approvals for\n100 percent affordable projects\nas developers who apply to build fully affordable developments can skip the lengthy public hearings process and avoid city council votes, cutting down approval timelines from nine months to a few weeks in most cases, according to the mayor\u2019s office.\nDevelopers have taken note as they increasingly opt to build affordable housing instead of market rate.\n\u201cMarket-rate housing [construction] has been essentially canceled at this point,\u201d Chris Aiello, founding partner at Six Peak Capital, which has been among the firms increasingly pursuing affordable housing, told\nCoStar\n. \u201cVirtually no land makes sense from an investment perspective to build market rate.\u201d\n\u201cED1 is the only reason we came out here,\u201d Passo principal Daniel Glimcher\ntold\nthe Wall Street Journal. \u201cMarket-rate multifamily just really doesn\u2019t pencil out in L.A.\u201d\nSince\nED1\u2019s implementation\n, developers have submitted proposals for 35,000 units under ED1 and secured approvals for approximately 29,000 of those units as of last August. That far outdoes the number of affordable housing submissions from 2020 to 2022 as well as the 17,556 units total housing units approved in L.A. during the last fiscal year.\nThe state of California is getting behind the effort to build more income-restricted housing. Last month, the California Strategic Growth Council approved $866 million in grant funding for\naffordable housing projects\nacross the state, including more than $182 million for efforts in the Los Angeles area.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The developer plans to turn the existing building, spanning more than 480,000 square feet, into 391 residential units.\nShomof acquired the property, known as Landmark Square, last fall for $50 million,\nThe Real Deal previously reported\n. A Manulife Financial Corporation affiliate sold the property at a steep discount, having purchased the offices in 2013 from Brookfield Properties for $135.5 million.\nThe structure is one of downtown Long Beach\u2019s newer and taller office buildings. Adaptive reuse has made more of an impact in downtown L.A. than downtown Long Beach, but Ocean Boulevard has seen a number of historic buildings converted into new uses in recent years.\nNear 111 West Ocean Boulevard at 200 West Ocean Boulevard, a high-rise built in the 1960s reopened as housing in 2023, according to Urbanize. The Breakers Building at 210 East Ocean Boulevard made its debut as the\nFremont Breakers Long Beach hotel\nin 2024. The Ocean Center Building at 110 West Ocean Boulevard, across the street from Shomoff\u2019s latest office-to-residential pursuit, completed its housing transition and opened to tenants in 2023.\nMore housing\nadaptive reuse projects\nare on the way. At 400 Oceangate, a 14-story office building is slated for conversion into housing. The 120-year-old First National Bank Building at 115 Pine Avenue, around the corner from 111 West Ocean Boulevard, is also set for residential units, according to Urbanize.\nShomof\u2019s office purchase in Long Beach is his latest in the Greater Los Angeles area as the developer appears poised for more adaptive reuse endeavors. A year ago, Shomof\npurchased\n101 North Brand Boulevard in Glendale for $58.5 million from Beacon Capital Partners, which bought the property in 2016 for $128.5 million. In 2024, he bought 617 West 7th Street in downtown Los Angeles\u2019 Financial District\nfrom Swig Company\nfor $20.5 million \u2014 nearly half off from its price over a decade prior.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Buyers seeking reprieve from surging prices of wealthy North Shore lakefront communities can find it just to the west in Northfield, where residential real estate is having its moment.\nLocated just west of Winnetka, Northfield was the site of the fifth- and sixth-most expensive home sales in Cook County last month, each bringing in more than $3 million.\nThe deals are among the seven highest Northfield home sales in the last five years, according to listing services, and signal a shift in buyer interest as prices in nearby Winnetka\nreach unprecedented levels\n, said Baird &amp; Warner agent Ben Fisher, who closed the larger of the two transactions. He said buyers are looking to Northfield for more space and amenities while staying close to the lake and in the same school district.\n\u201cWhen you look at Northfield, you get a bigger house, a bigger lot, New Trier Schools,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cAnd people have finally opened their eyes up to this incredible small town of not even 6,000 people.\u201d\nA sprawling 21,000-square-foot home in Northfield sold for nearly $3.6 million on Jan. 5, the fifth-priciest sale in Cook County last month. The mansion at 2202 Martin Lane was designed and built by a real estate developer in 2013, said Fisher, who represented the buyer on the deal. Property records show commercial developer Stanislaw Pluta was the seller, while Fisher wouldn\u2019t identify his client and public documents of the sale aren\u2019t yet public.\n\u201cIt is really over the top because it was built for a guy who builds for a living,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cSo there\u2019s a ton of stone, almost commercial systems in terms of the electrical, the plumbing. The bones are incredible.\u201d\nLukas Pluta with Wilmot Realty represented the seller.\nA modern transitional home at 2064 Norfork Road in Northfield brought in $3.5 million on Jan. 14, the sixth-priciest sale in Cook County last month. Built in 2020, the home is 5,380 square feet and has six bedrooms and five bathrooms. @properties broker\nJena Radnay\nand Baird &amp; Warner\u2019s Richard Murawski represented the sellers.\nThe biggest listed sale in Northfield in the last five years was $5 million for a 7,000-square-foot home on Old Farm Road, according to listing data.\nThe comparison between Northfield and Winnetka is borne out in the January sales data: the priciest home sale in the latter was a non-lakefront home at 861 Bell Lane, which sold for $3.35 million. The 7,218-square-foot house brought in $464 per square foot, while the Martin Lane mansion in Northfield sold for $170 per square foot.\nAcross Cook County\n, there were 163 sales over $1 million in January, compared to 193 in January 2025, according to data gathered from Redfin and\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nmost recent Cook County broker ranking. Outside Chicago, Wilmette and Glenview led the pack in home sales over $1 million, with nine sales each in January.\nStill, the highest end of the luxury market was relatively quiet last month. Only one home broke the $5 million mark, a five-story greystone at 1540 N Dearborn Parkway in Chicago that brought in $5.1 million on Jan. 12.\nThe five-bedroom, eight bathroom, 7,600-square-foot home features a central spiral staircase, outdoor terraces and a two-car garage, according to listing services.\nBrad Lippitz\nand Brittany Shapiro of Compass represented the seller, while Rubina Bokhari represented the buyer.\nThe sellers were Ferdinand and Bernadette Korndorf, according to public records. Details on the buyer\u2019s identity are not yet available.\nThe second-priciest trade was a massive, 14,600-square-foot mansion at\n6655 Lee Court in Burr Ridge\n, which sold for just over $4 million. The most expensive sale in Burr Ridge since 2024, the home was once owned by former NBA player Eddy Curry before he lost it through foreclosure. The home sits on a secluded cul-de-sac on a spacious one-acre lot. Compass\u2019 Rafael Murillo represented the buyers, while Ginny Stewart and Paige Kelly of Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty represented the sellers.\nOral surgeon Louis Korompilas was the seller and Sadia Rizwan was the buyer, according to property records.\n",

Osso secured a $71 million loan originated by JLL Real Estate Capital and sold it off on the commercial mortgage-backed securities market, according to Will County records and CMBS tracking firm Morningstar Credit. John declined to comment on the sale.\nThe property was first listed in July. JLL\u2019s Mark Stern brokered the deal on behalf of the seller.\nStern declined to comment on the sale, but said the market in general performed well in 2025 and is on track to improve in 2026. Listings often receive several offers, and institutional investors have started to\ncome off of the sidelines\n, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since everyone was focused on Chicago and the Midwest in particular,\u201d Stern said.\nOther recently closed suburban multifamily deals include the sales of The Arrowhead Apartments in Arlington Heights, The Fox Pointe Apartments in Aurora and The Carriage Creek Apartments in Richton Park, public records show.\nThe flurry of activity indicates that 2026 may be\nanother busy year for Chicago\u2019s suburban multifamily market.\nDuring the first three quarters of 2025, Interra recorded 155 apartment building sales between $1 million and $50 million, compared with 115 deals in the same time price range during the same period in 2024.\nThe Chicago multifamily market in general performed well in 2025 due to a low supply of new units and steady job growth. But the\nsuburbs have outperformed the city\nbecause investors perceive them as having more predictable political and property tax atmospheres.\nThe Arrowhead Apartments, Arlington Heights\nIn Arlington Heights, where speculation about a new Chicago Bears Stadium continues to circulate, the Hispanic Housing Development Corporation sold the Arrowhead Apartments to Artisan Capital Group, records show. Both firms are based in Chicago.\nArtisan, led by Ryan Cahalan and Michael Perry, bought the 200-unit complex for $31.4 million or about $157,000 per unit. Public records do not yet show a new mortgage recorded against the property.\nThe HHDC, led by Tony Hernandez, originally bought the Arrowhead Apartments at 1950 Cambridge Court for $23.6 million in 2018 with a $18.8 million mortgage from First America Bank, according to Cook County records.\nRepresentatives of Artisan Capital and the HHDC did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe Fox Pointe Apartments, Aurora\nAbout 40 miles west of Chicago, a Miami-based investment firm bought a 248-unit apartment complex known as The Fox Pointe Apartments at 2074 Fox Point Circle in Aurora.\nPalatine Capital Partners, led by Alex Hurst, paid $40.1 million for the property, or about $162,000 per unit.\nThe seller, Jeb Scherb\u2019s Chicago-based Ameritus, originally bought the apartment community in 2020 for $25 million. It secured a $17.9 million mortgage that was originated by Grandbridge Real Estate Capital and sold off on the CMBS market, according to Kane County records and CMBS tracking firm Morningstar Credit.\nRepresentatives of Ameritus and Palatine Capital Partners did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe Carriage Creek Apartments, Richton Park\nA longtime owner cashed in on the Carriage Creek Apartments by selling them for $11.9 million to\nChicago-based Bender Companies\n. The sale of the 226-unit tower at 22400 Butterfield Road in the south suburb of Richton Park came out to about $53,000 per unit.\nIt\u2019s unclear how long the seller, local investor Daniel Kotcher, owned the complex, but he took out a $7.5 million mortgage against the property in 2013, records show.\nKotcher could not be reached for comment, and representatives of Bender Companies did not respond to requests for comment.\nMarcus &amp; Millichaps\u2019 Ryan D. Engle and Andrean Angelov represented the buyer and the seller in the deal.",

        "content": "The first FDIC-insured bank failure of 2026 slipped by with little fanfare late Friday, but court records suggest a long-simmering real estate loan exposure may have played a key role.\nIllinois regulators seized Chicago-based Metropolitan Capital Bank &amp; Trust, which held about $261 million in assets, and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver, Bisnow\nreported\n. FDIC transferred all deposits and most assets to Detroit-based First Independence Bank, which plans to reopen Metropolitan\u2019s lone\nRiver North\nbranch at 9 East Ontario Street under its own banner. It was the largest bank failure in Illinois since 2017.\nRegulators have not publicly identified the cause of the collapse, and FDIC has yet to release a post-seizure analysis. But a review by the outlet of court filings and enforcement actions points to a problematic commercial real estate loan tied to the largest default in the federal government\u2019s\nskilled nursing facility lending program\n.\nMetropolitan held a $4.5 million loan originated in 2014 to entities controlled by Chicago real estate investor,\nRabbi Zvi Feiner\n. The debt helped restructure obligations across 13 Rosewood Care Centers facilities in the Midwest and sat junior to a $146 million HUD-insured mortgage. That senior loan ultimately defaulted, and the Department of Justice later charged Feiner with running a\nPonzi scheme\n.\nAs Rosewood\u2019s finances deteriorated, Metropolitan modified its loan five times between 2014 and 2017, extending repayment terms without demanding additional collateral, court records show. In the fifth modification, the bank accepted collateral already pledged elsewhere. An Illinois appellate court ruled in 2020 that while Feiner made material misrepresentations, Metropolitan failed to conduct basic due diligence and was left with no enforceable claim.\nThe $4.5 million exposure loomed large for a bank of Metropolitan\u2019s size and drew regulatory scrutiny. In 2019, regulators imposed a consent order citing \u201cunsafe and unsound conditions,\u201d an impaired capital position and substandard lending practices, according to the publication. The order required management changes, higher capital levels and tighter controls.\nMetropolitan Capital was founded in 2005 by Michael Rose, former executive director of the Illinois Housing Development Authority. Rose departed the bank last July to become managing partner at Affinitas Capital.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A long-empty Super Kmart that once anchored a\nRound Lake Beach\nshopping center is heading for the wrecking ball, and Target is stepping in to revive the site.\nTarget Stores closed on the purchase of the former Super Kmart at 400 East Rollins Road at the Rollins Crossing shopping center in December and plans to demolish the roughly 190,000-square-foot building and replace it with a new Target, the company\nconfirmed\nto the Daily Herald. The old big-box store shuttered more than 12 years ago and has sat vacant ever since, with imprints of taken-down signs still lingering on the building\u2019s side.\nThe new Target is slated to span about 148,570 square feet. The retailer has applied for a demolition permit, though it has not released a\nconstruction timeline\nor opening date, according to the publication.\nThe company said in a statement that more details will come closer to opening.\nThe deal caps years of frustration with a property\nvillage officials\nincreasingly viewed as an eyesore. Mayor Scott Nickles, elected in 2021, said redeveloping the former Kmart was a top priority, the outlet reported. The village even explored buying the building itself after Kmart closed, but the owner wouldn\u2019t sell, Nickles said.\nAfter more than a decade of inactivity, the village initiated legal action to have the structure condemned. Target\u2019s purchase came before those proceedings concluded.\nThe site sits along busy Rollins Road near the village municipal complex and is part of a broader retail corridor that includes grocery stores, restaurants and entertainment uses. Village officials have described the former Kmart as the\ncornerstone\nof Rollins Crossing \u2014 and its vacancy as a drag on the center\u2019s potential.\nTarget\u2019s move fits with its broader expansion push. The retailer plans to open about 30 new stores this year and more than 300 by 2035, according to the company.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The Chicago Tribune\nreported\nthat the plan would bring a blend of for-sale housing and neighborhood retail to the corridor in what Predovich pegged as a $50 million to $60 million investment, according to materials presented to the Village Board this week.\nThe proposal centers on two three-story buildings fronting 159th Street, with about 30,000 square feet of retail on the ground floor and condos above, village planning and zoning director Christopher Gruba said. Each building would include 13 condos, ranging from roughly 1,250 square feet to 1,500 square feet with balconies, plus larger penthouses up to 1,800 square feet with outdoor terraces.\nBehind the mixed-use buildings, the plan calls for a gated enclave of 20 duplex buildings \u2014 40 homes total \u2014 set along an internal drive.\nPrices\nfor the duplexes could start in the upper $500,000s or $600,000s, Predovich said.\nNotably absent from the mix are\napartments\n, as Predovich made clear he isn\u2019t interested in rentals. Homer Glen residents and officials have\nhistorically pushed back\nagainst apartment development, according to the outlet.\nRetail could be spread across as many as 16 storefronts, Predovich said, with potential tenants including restaurants, boutiques and coffee shops. The development is designed to be walkable and function as a gathering place rather than a standalone subdivision. Homes would be built in brick with varied elevations and color palettes to avoid a \u201ccookie-cutter\u201d feel, the development team said.\nThe plan is still early. Trustees heard the concept at a committee meeting Wednesday, but no approvals were granted. The proposal must still go before the plan commission and ultimately return to the Village Board for a vote. It would also require the creation of a new zoning district, as Homer Glen doesn\u2019t currently have a classification tailored to mixed-use development of this type, Gruba said.\nSeveral village trustees said the project could appeal to longtime residents looking to downsize without leaving the village, while adding the kind of retail amenities the corridor lacks.\nMayor Christina Neitzke-Troike stressed that resident input will shape what happens next, calling the project a \u201cbig deal.\u201d The village will gather public feedback ahead of its Feb. 11 meeting.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

With\noffice construction slowing\nin the area, office users could soon run into a shortage of new, top-tier space in the Peninsula and Silicon Valley.\nRoblox\u2019s newest\noffices in San Mateo\nare one instance of a company doubling down on transit-oriented offices. The online gaming company expanded by 112,000 square feet at Bay Meadows in offices surrounded by housing, shops and Caltrain.\nNorth of San Mateo in Burlingame, fintech firm Upstart Holdings leased 54,000 square feet at the newly built 220 Park, a six-story office building near\nBurlingame\u2019s Caltrain station\n. CBRE\u2019s coworking company Industrious is also at 220 Park,\nsigning a lease last quarter\nfor 19,800 square feet.\nIn Redwood City, law firm Paul Hastings is planning to move into 45,000 square feet as the company doubles down on offices in transit-adjacent areas across the country, according to the Business Times. And in Sunnyvale,\nDatabricks\nhas continued its Bay Area expansion with three floors at Cityline\u2019s seven-story 250 West Washington Avenue, bringing its total footprint at the Cityline development near the Sunnyvale Caltrain station to 455,000 square feet.\nLast year, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed\nSenate Bill 79\n, which increased zoning in areas near transit stops, allowing developers to build residential structures between six and nine stories within a half-mile of bus and train stops. The goal with the legislation is ostensibly to incentivize developers to initiate new projects near those transportation connections.\nLandlords overall filled 17,674 square feet in the quarter, marking the second consecutive quarter of positive absorption when more space was leased than vacated. In total, office vacancy in the Peninsula rose to 19.2 percent in the fourth quarter, while asking rents dropped 5 percent quarter-over-quarter. The vacancy increase can be partially attributed to\nOracle\n\u2019s decision to vacate 294,000 square feet at its longtime Redwood City campus, per the Business Times.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A long-simmering debate over what to do with Dallas City Hall now includes a proposal from Ray Washburne to move local government operations into one of his downtown buildings.\nAt issue is the aging seven-story, 1 million-square-foot Brutalist building at 1500 Marilla Street and whether the city should\nspend nine figures\nto overhaul it or decamp to a new home, potentially unlocking one of the largest redevelopment sites in the urban core.\nA City Hall move\ncould clear the way for a mixed-use redevelopment tied to a new Dallas Mavericks arena, while keeping the building would mean doubling down on preservation and reinvestment, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe latest volley came via the Dallas Morning News editorial section, which launched a series dubbed \u201cSaving Downtown.\u201d The opening installment featured dueling op-eds from\nRay Washburne\n, vice chairman of Gillon Property Group and a heavy investor in downtown properties, as well as a\ntrio of prominent architects\narguing for City Hall\u2019s preservation.\nWashburne\nframed his proposal as a reset moment for downtown. He argued the city is at a \u201ccrossroads\u201d and should rethink how to maximize what he called \u201cthe largest property tax base for a primary residential city.\u201d In his telling, a roughly $2 billion\nMavericks arena\nand entertainment district on the City Hall site would generate far more tax revenue than a government-owned building that pays none, while catalyzing a broader development wave.\nWashburne said the arena project, paired with other initiatives like the overhaul of the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center, could spark as much as $10 billion in downtown investment. As part of that vision, he suggested relocating City Hall a few blocks away to Founders Square, a circa-1915 building at 1000 Jackson Street that he owns.\nThe counterargument, laid out by GFF co-founder Duncan Fulton, Omniplan principal emeritus Tipton Housewright and AIA Dallas executive director Zaida Basora, focused heavily on both dollars and civic identity. While acknowledging City Hall\u2019s \u201creal problems,\u201d the architects said they could be addressed \u201ceasily and affordably\u201d through redesigned entrances, modernized interiors and better wayfinding.\nThey also pitched a radical redesign of the windswept plaza outside City Hall, recasting it as a pocket park with trees, water and space for performances. The building\u2019s central location, they argued, is an asset, not a liability. An expanded City Hall campus could even house a long-sought one-stop permitting center for developers, turning the complex into a daily engine of downtown activity.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava blocked an industrial project planned on 245 acres outside the Urban Development Boundary, citing concerns over wetlands and other issues.\nOn Monday, Levine Cava vetoed the commission\u2019s approval of the project, igniting what will likely be yet another showdown between the mayor and commissioners over expansion of the UDB.\nCounty commissioners, sitting as the comprehensive development master plan and zoning board,\ngreenlit\na text amendment on Jan. 22 that would have allowed heavy equipment company Kelly Tractor to build its headquarters, where it would sell, store and repair machinery, on land outside the UDB, including on more than 160 acres of wetlands. The site is west of Sweetwater.\nA supermajority vote by county commissioners is required to override the veto. Commissioners will take up the item on Feb. 18.\nKelly Tractor, a Florida-based firm since the 1930s that supplies equipment such as hydraulic drills for excavators, is based in Doral and has said it needs a bigger headquarters to support county infrastructure projects, such as highways and airports, South Florida NPR affiliate\nWLRN\nreported.\nThe county board approved the text amendment, despite Miami-Dade staff members recommending denial, claiming that the county has plenty of land for industrial development within the UDB and that Kelly Tractor\u2019s application failed to show how it will mitigate wetlands that the project would pave over.\nMiami-Dade is generally a developer-friendly county, with elected officials often helping the private sector score approval for projects, as real estate is a major economic driver in the county. But building outside the UDB, an invisible boundary meant to stop suburban sprawl onto farmland, wetlands and the Everglades, is one of the most controversial proposals a developer can make, with few projects scoring approval and, often, those that do face other challenges.\nIn a Sunday memo, Levine Cava said she vetoed the project because it didn\u2019t sufficiently address impacts on wetlands of exceptional environmental value and because the approval was for a text amendment, circumventing the traditional application process for development outside the UDB. County staff had previously said in records the wetlands on the Kelly Tractor site are top tier.\nAt the Jan. 22 meeting, Kelly Tractor agreed to commissioners\u2019 request that any portion of the 60 acres of wetlands not mitigated on the site be mitigated elsewhere within Miami-Dade. But Kelly Tractor didn\u2019t commit to county staff\u2019s request to prioritize mitigation in the North Trail Basin, Levine Cava said in her memo.\nWetlands have multiple purposes, including flood protection and filtration of water before it reaches Miami-Dade\u2019s drinking water aquifer, she said. They also are a habitat for wildlife.\nProposals for projects outside the UDB have to go through an amendment process, but text amendment applications lack the \u201crobust growth analysis and planning procedures\u201d that a traditional UDB expansion process would require, Levine Cava said in her memo. .\n\u201cThe presentation of a text change in this case enabled substantially less specificity and commitment on the future development than an application that followed a UDB amendment process,\u201d Levine Cava wrote in the memo.\nChris Kelly, president of Kelly Tractor, declined to comment on the veto. He pointed\nThe Real Deal\nto a 2017 study prepared by engineering firm CH2M for Miami-Dade, looking at several potential sites for a new county wastewater treatment plant, determining Kelly Tractor\u2019s property outside the UDB is the most suitable location. That project never panned out.\nThe last time county commissioners approved a massive project outside the UDB was in 2022 when they greenlit the South Dade Logistics &amp; Technology District on 379 acres. It took developers Stephen Blumenthal and Jose Hevia five public hearings to get the approval, with the pair giving concessions along the way, including cutting the project size by about half.\nLevine Cava\nvetoed\nthat project, too, and commissioners subsequently\noverrode\nher veto.\nSouth Dade Logistics\nfizzled out\nin court in 2024.\n",

With the\u00a0 P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group, Rockpoint completed the 393-unit The Point at Miramar apartment building in the Broward County city in 2024, selling it for\n$161 million\nlast year.\nAlso last year, Rockpoint was part of a joint venture that sold the One Clearlake office building in West Palm Beach for\n$45 million\n, marking a nearly 26 percent discount from what the JV paid in 2021.\nSouth Florida\u2019s apartment supply overhang is the result of developers seizing on the pandemic-induced influx of newcomers with plans for new projects. In 2024, they completed a record of more than\n18,600 units\n, according to CoStar Group.\nDevelopers with planned or under construction projects say that by the time their buildings are finished, between this year and 2028, demand will\ncatch up\n. They are confident in the lease-up of the projects, arguing construction starts have slowed, which will allow for supply to be absorbed.\nLast year, 12,718 apartments were completed in South Florida, according to CoStar. That\u2019s fewer than the record in 2024 and the 15,426 unit completions in 2023, but still more than the 11,002 and 11,660 unit completions in 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nMultifamily construction financing has flowed in South Florida, despite higher interest rates. In December, Trilogy Real Estate Group landed an\n$82.3 million\nconstruction loan for a 247-unit project in Miami\u2019s Edgewater, and Focus and Group Fox scored\n$250 million\nto build a 517-unit apartment tower in Brickell.\n",

The portfolio spans roughly 3,600 units split between Los Angeles-Orange County and the San Diego-Inland Empire region, according to Piper Sandler.\nIf completed, the sale would mark a sharp pullback from one of the country\u2019s most expensive and tightly regulated housing markets. Camden is one of the nation\u2019s larger\napartment owners\n, developers and operators, with 177 communities totaling more than 60,000 units across 15 markets, according to the outlet. The bulk of its portfolio sits in Sun Belt metros, with smaller beachheads in California and Washington, D.C.\nCamden wouldn\u2019t be the first major\napartment player\nto rethink its West Coast exposure. Atlanta-based\nWood Partners\nsaid last year it would wind down its California operations after finishing projects already underway. While Wood didn\u2019t spell out its reasons, developers have long complained about the difficulty of entitling, building and operating apartments in the state, according\u00a0 to the outlet.\nExecutives at\nCamden\n, however, have been more explicit, repeatedly flagging California\u2019s regulatory environment, high operating costs and shifting renter dynamics as headwinds. According to the publication, during the company\u2019s first quarter 2025 earnings call, Executive Vice Chairman Keith Oden summed up the uncertainty by suggesting multifamily operators always have to ask what the next regulatory \u201cbullet\u201d will be in the state.\nAnalysts appear supportive of a potential exit. In comments to Multifamily Dive, Mizuho Securities managing director Haendel St. Juste said Camden has \u201cdocumented its frustration\u201d with the state\u2019s rules, pandemic-era rent policies and tenant behavior. Reducing exposure, he said, would be a net positive for the REIT\u2019s long-term strategy.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "When it comes to ultra-luxury residential sales, Dallas is\nstill on top\n.\nDallas/Fort Worth\nled the state in sales dollar volume for homes listed above $10 million last year, according to Compass\u2019s ultra-luxury report, which draws from local Multiple Listing Service data. According to some agents, the metro\u2019s desirable neighborhoods and durable business environment do much to propel it past Houston, which has a hot but\ntightly concentrated enclave\nof ultra-luxury stock, and Austin, a\nmore diffuse market\nwhich depended almost singularly on the\ntech industry\nfor its most recent boom.\nIn 2025, 15 homes listed above $10 million sold in Dallas/Fort Worth, adding up to more than $231 million in ultra-luxury sales volume, according to Compass. Houston took second place with 10 sales and $121 million in ultra-luxury volume, and Austin was a distant third with two sales totaling about $25 million in volume.\nTexas is a non-disclosure state, so the final sale prices of these homes aren\u2019t available.\nThe Dallas ultra-luxury market benefits from a steady stream of businesses moving to the area, according to Compass agent Amy Detwiler, co-founder of Compass\u2019s top-producing team in Texas.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the economy in Dallas and the pro-business attitude. There are large companies moving to Dallas and expanding their headquarters, and everyone is very excited about the expansion of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley,\u201d Detwiler said.\nBased on MLS data\n, Dallas has been the steadiest ultra-luxury market in the state since the housing boom of 2021 and 2022. Eleven homes over $10 million sold in\nAustin in 2021\nduring the city\u2019s tech industry boom \u2014 just one more than the 10 sales in Dallas/Fort Worth that year, according to Compass\u2019 report. Just three years later, in 2024, Austin had zero ultra-luxury sales while Dallas/Fort Worth had 13.\nWith 10 sales totaling $121 million in ultra-luxury dollar volume last year, Houston barely surpassed half the $234 million of volume completed in Dallas. However, Space City has enjoyed a meteoric rise in attention from the wealthiest buyers in the past few years. Last year\u2019s numbers represent quite a boost after\nHouston had zero residential sales above $10 million in 2020 and 2021\n.\nIn Houston, ultra-luxury buyers scramble for a relatively limited set of homes in the River Oaks neighborhood. Five of the\ntop 10 residential sales in Harris County\nlast year took place within one square mile. Between Highland Park, University Park and Preston Hollow, Dallas has a broader range of options for ultra-wealthy buyers, Detwiler said.\nMeanwhile,\nAustin\u2019s top sales are almost all outside the city\n, with many strung on large lots along the Colorado River, indicating relatively weak demand for the city\u2019s central neighborhoods.\n",

The complaint centers on Urban East Apartments, a 381-unit complex at 6400 East Riverside Drive in the Montopolis neighborhood.\nGreystar\nalleges a hot water pipe failure triggered \u201ccatastrophic damage\u201d throughout the building after the system was improperly installed. The Charleston, South Carolina-based multifamily giant claims the fault lies with Bartlett Cocke and its\nsubcontractors\n, pointing to inadequate oversight and construction errors.\nAccording to the lawsuit, plumbers failed to install a thermostatic mixing valve in one of the buildings\u2019 hot water systems, a device designed to limit water temperature. When the boilers were turned on in December 2023, the water temperature allegedly surged to the system\u2019s maximum of 180 degrees, Bisnow\nreported\n. The heat caused a PVC pipe on the fourth floor to separate from the system, unleashing water that damaged multiple parts of the property.\nGreystar\nis seeking damages for negligence from Bartlett Cocke as well as several subcontractors, including Liberty Hill-based Basey Plumbing, Houston-based FCS Mechanical, plumber Enrique Corona Ramirez and Austin-based Nichols Engineering. The complaint alleges each defendant bears responsibility through improper installation, failure to review system design or failure to reduce water temperatures.\nThree insurers \u2014 Allianz Underwriters, Steadfast Insurance Company and Starr Surplus Lines Insurance Company \u2014 have also joined the case in an effort to recoup insurance payouts tied to the damage.\nThe lawsuit was filed Jan. 16 in the 126th District Civil Court of Travis County under Judge Aurora Martinez Jones and was transferred to Texas\u2019 Business Court on Jan. 27 at Bartlett Cocke\u2019s request.\nConstruction on the project began in 2022, and the pipe failure occurred roughly a year later, the suit states. Greystar\u2019s attorneys allege Bartlett Cocke\u2019s \u201cnegligent undertaking\u201d was a substantial factor in the failure and the resulting damage.\nBartlett Cocke,\nGreystar and their attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Karen Bass with 3980 Bill Robertson Lane in Los Angeles\n*please pull Getty and/or Google Maps images of LA Mayor Karen Bass and the Expo Center at 3980 Bill Robertson Lane in Los Angeles. This is art for Bass\u2019s state of the city address, which will be held at the Expo Center\nReal estate was left wanting more \u2014 a lot more when it came to Los Angeles Mayor\nKaren Bass\n\u2019s\nState of the City\non Monday.\nThis summer\u2019s FIFA World Cup and U.S. Women\u2019s Open, along with the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic games, dominated much of Bass\u2019s address beginning with the remarks being delivered about five miles southwest of city hall at the Expo Center in Los Angeles\u2019s Exposition Park neighborhood south of downtown.\nAfter last week\u2019s messy battle over the two-tier property-transfer tax, Measure United to House L.A. (Measure ULA), Bass offered little to shed light on where she stands on major reforms proposed by Councilmember\nNithya Raman\nthat would create aggressive carveouts across commercial and residential real estate. Bass\u2019s own push to get Palisades Fire-impacted property owners relief from the tax, which she introduced in\nOctober\n, was also absent from Monday\u2019s address.\nMeasure ULA applies to sales of properties that sell for at least $5.3 million, applying a 4 percent levy on the deal and increases to 5.5 percent for those trading for $10.6 million or more.\nRaman is a Democratic Socialist and prominent local progressive. She represents the city\u2019s 4th District and attempted last week to get her City Council peers to consider and vote on a 15-year exemption from the so-called mansion tax for newly constructed apartments, commercial and mixed-use projects. Raman had hoped to push the item onto the June ballot, but it was instead kicked to the\nHousing and Homelessness Committee\n. Her move raised hopes among real estate executives in the commercial and residential sectors, who want to see the city roll back ULA,\u00a0 while also inflaming the\nMeasure ULA Citizen Oversight Committee\nfor bypassing the group established to monitor implementation of the tax.\nInstead, the only reference to ULA on Monday was when Bass confirmed the approval of $14 million in rental assistance for seniors and individuals with disabilities. The city confirmed those funds came from the over $1 billion ULA has generated since its inception in April 2023.\nWhile Bass stressed the need to \u201ccontinue accelerating the construction of permanent affordable housing\u201d \u2014 a key point in Raman\u2019s explanation for her proposed carveouts \u2014 a firm stance on the mansion tax didn\u2019t factor into the mayor\u2019s address.\nRebuild: year two\nSpecifics around the Pacific Palisades in year two of the rebuild were also thin.\nBass said she, along with Councilmember Traci Park and Palisades residents, would travel to Sacramento next week \u201cto make clear to the state that continued investment in building the Palisades is not optional; it is essential.\u201d\nWhile permitting was mentioned by Bass, it was to confirm more than 400 homes are under construction in the neighborhood, while \u201chundreds more\u201d have received approvals.\nThe remarks come as the mayor and California Gov. Gavin Newsom fend off heat from the federal government over permitting delays. Late last month President Donald Trump signed off on an executive order authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Small Business Administration to leap over local permitting to create a self-certification process for builders, which a federally appointed agency would oversee.\nIt\u2019s unclear if the Trump\nadministration\nhas authority to step into local permitting processes, and whether it also\u00a0 plans to inject itself into California\u2019s tangled insurance ecosystem, which has been a major cause of delays in jumpstarting rebuilding.\nA total of 10 homes have been rebuilt and about 2,500 projects have been permitted post-Palisades and Eaton fires, according to the federal government.\nElection year\nThe rosy outlook was delivered in an\nelection year\n, crowded with 25 hopefuls looking to unseat Bass as mayor of Los Angeles.\nThe most recent to enter the field was former \u201cThe Hills\u201d reality TV star\nSpencer Pratt\n, who announced his bid for the seat in January on the anniversary of the Palisades Fire. There\u2019s also Austin Beutner, a former L.A. deputy mayor and Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent, and Democratic Socialist of America Rae Chen Huang, who some call a longshot candidate likened to New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani.\nBass has pulled in the lion\u2019s share of funding, so far raising $2.4 million in campaign contributions as of Dec. 31, according to the Los Angeles Ethics Commission. Meanwhile, Beutner\u2019s raised $314,601, while Huang \u2014 who announced her bid for mayor in mid-November \u2014 has drawn $107,644 as of Dec. 31.\n",

To see the top office sales in Culver City last year click\nhere\n.\nFenway Capital, which has an office in Solana Beach and Dallas, acquired the 315,000-square-foot office building at 6181 Centinela Avenue in April for about $413 per square foot.\nThe $130 million price tag didn\u2019t cover the $142.5 million in debt sellers, Lincoln Property Company and Goldman Sachs affiliate Broad Street Principal Investments, took on six years prior to develop Entrada.\nA source told\nTRD\nat the time of the sale that the $130 million deal was a \u201crecapitalization\u201d of the 11-story property.\nDallas-based Lincoln Property retained a minority stake in the property and was set to continue managing it, the source said.\nThe joint venture partners bought the formerly stalled development site in 2018 for $33 million and took out a $142.5 million construction loan from Singapore-based United Overseas Bank the following year, per property records. The building was completed in 2022.\nPrior to the sale to Fenway Capital, Equinox signed a lease in the building. The deal brought the property to roughly 75 percent leased, with global accounting firm Deloitte, digital ad platform The Trade Desk and toy manufacturer Jazwares on the tenant roster, according to the source.\nReal estate investment firm Fenway Capital\u2019s portfolio spans Arizona, California, Nevada, Oklahoma and Texas.\nIts eight other California properties include the Terrace on Cedros three-building commercial project in Solana Beach and E Street, a 20-unit apartment complex in San Diego.\nThe firm has underway the 4-acre Marea Village in Encinitas which will include 96 rental units and a 30-key expansion of the Alila Marea Resort, as well as retail space and public amenities.\n",

An unnamed investor is already negotiating to buy the property, according to Bloomberg.\nOceanwide filed for bankruptcy in 2024 and has failed to attract a buyer since then, in part due to the cost of completing the project and preparing for residential and retail tenants once acquired. \u201cWe get a lot of interest, and it\u2019s just finding a billion and a half dollars to complete the project is proving difficult,\u201d Colliers\u2019 Mark Tarczynski, part of the team marketing the building,\ntold The Real Deal\nlast year.\nOceanwide Holdings owes roughly $400 million to creditors, including $180 million to\nEB-5 visa investors\n, $175 million to contractors led by Lendlease Corporation and $18 million for county taxes,\nTRD\npreviously reported. Under the bankruptcy-exit agreement, lender group LA Development Investment LP is entitled to a $230 million claim. Other creditors also have hundreds of millions of dollars in additional claims.\n\u201cA prompt sale and eventual completion of the project is a major priority for the city and the public at large, particularly with the upcoming\n2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles\n,\u201d lawyers for Oceanwide Plaza said in a\ncourt filing\nlate last month, noting the city \u201cfully supports the approval of the [bankruptcy] settlement agreement.\u201d\nIn reaching the settlement agreement, creditors and the project owner put an \u201cimmediate stop\u201d to the \u201cvalue-destructive litigation, preserving estate assets and allowing the debtor to pivot from endless legal battles to the productive work of selling the project and confirming a plan,\u201d lawyers for Oceanwide said in the filing.\nConstruction at\nOceanwide Plaza\nhas been stalled since 2019 when China Oceanwide ran out of funding for the project. The buildings were never fully enclosed, leaving them open to members of the public trespassing and marking the street-facing floors with graffiti. In the post-pandemic years, the buildings became symbolic of\nDowntown Los Angeles\u2019 tepid office market\n\u2014 a period from which it still has yet to emerge.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Mark Furman began his career at a nonprofit doing what Mayor Zohran Mamdani would call God\u2019s work: helping affordable housing residents take over their buildings.\nBut the laws of physics and finance prevailed in the end, as they always do.\nIn the early 1980s, his nonprofit used Section 8 and other federal funds to renovate aging, low-rise buildings in Madison, Wisconsin, and taught the subsidized residents how to self-manage and keep costs down.\n\u201cThe staff provided guidance and support \u2014 helping develop budgets, working with residents to identify maintenance needs,\u201d Furman said by email. \u201cIt was a great model and I loved helping folks take control of a small corner of their own lives. But it ultimately failed.\u201d\nThe government had adequately funded the initial work but not the long-term needs of the properties, and the restricted rents did not make up the shortfall.\n\u201cThere simply was not enough money in reserves or other funding available to fix the structural and capital problems that are inevitable with any real estate, let alone renovated older properties,\u201d Furman wrote. \u201cRoofs, HVAC systems, old pipes \u2014 buildings require constant feeding and care, as any property manager well knows.\u201d\nNew York City\u2019s own property crisis is like the one he encountered in Wisconsin but on a massive scale: Hundreds of rent-stabilized buildings are\nin distress\nas escalating expenses and a\ntourniquet on rents\nforce owners to defer maintenance.\nFurman is on the front lines. He was hired by a lender to manage 38 rent-stabilized buildings in\nSpanish Harlem\n, on which it is foreclosing. The owner stopped sinking money into the 900-unit portfolio but still couldn\u2019t make the mortgage payments.\n\u201cWe are just trying to keep the units habitable and operational while the lender seeks to gain title and then dispose of the properties to offset its losses,\u201d Furman wrote.\nBut even without having to pay debt service, the rent revenue \u2014 which Mamdani\naims to freeze\n\u2014 simply isn\u2019t enough.\n\u201cIt is often hard to cover basic operating costs, taxes, and rising insurance premiums for many of the buildings given the restricted rents, let alone try to address years and years of deferred maintenance on boilers, roofs, pipes, gas lines, cameras, etc.,\u201d Furman explained.\n\u201cMy staff and I respond as quickly as possible to problems with failing boilers, rotting gas lines, decaying roofs, moldy bathrooms with inadequate ventilation, but the litany of problems in these long-neglected properties is staggering.\u201d\nThe property manager\u2019s 876-word message to\nThe Real Deal\nshould be required reading for Mamdani. The mayor hasn\u2019t acknowledged the impossibility of maintaining aging buildings with\nuncontrollable expenses\nand\nlow rents\nthat tenants increasingly\ndon\u2019t pay\n.\nInstead, he has blamed landlords for the dilapidated condition of buildings and announced\n\u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings\nto let tenants do the same \u2014 as if shaming owners changes the math when regulated rents are already too low to keep properties up to code.\nBeneath the surface of Mamdani\u2019s public narrative, his\ncourt filings\nand\nlobbying\nshow his strategies for distressed, rent-stabilized buildings include\ndevaluing them\nto reduce debt service and\nsteering them to nonprofits\nto eliminate property taxes.\nThe mayor has also said he wants to work with the real estate industry, but nothing indicates he has spoken to people like Furman. The property manager\u2019s reward for trying valiantly to stabilize the buildings was a place on Public Advocate Jumaane Williams\u2019\n\u201cworst landlords\u201d list\n.\nA simple check of\nproperty records\nshows the six properties that landed Furman on the list are actually owned by Isaac Kassirer, who bought them with financing from California-based Sabal Capital just before the rent laws changed in 2019.\n\u201cI guarantee that we are doing much better than the last group that owned these apartments, but it is going to take more than patching them up to ensure long-term stability for these units,\u201d Furman wrote. \u201cIt requires a significant capital improvement plan that the restricted rents cannot support on their own.\u201d\nFurman said he would love to live in a world where people without means are guaranteed housing. But his decades of experience with affordable housing \u201cmakes it clear that this cannot happen solely on the backs of the free market.\u201d\n\u201cI have heard it said that Republicans like to privatize profits and socialize costs,\u201d Furman observed. \u201cMamdani is the inverse, it seems, seeking to privatize the social costs of affordable housing. It will not work.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The REST Act has not been put to rest.\nThe acronyms that plague the real estate industry are having a moment.\nLast week, the City Council decided\nagainst\noverriding former Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 veto of the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act, or COPA. The bill\u2019s sponsor, the mayor and Council leadership, however, made clear that they are committed to reintroducing the bill.\nAs that\ndrama\nunfolded last week, state lawmakers and tenant advocates recommitted to a\nmeasure\nthat would make it easier for localities outside New York City to adopt rent regulation, dubbed the Rent Emergency Stabilization for Tenants, or REST, Act.\nTowns and cities in the state can opt into rent stabilization if they find that a housing emergency exists, which is defined as having a housing vacancy rate of 5 percent or less.\nThe REST Act created another avenue for localities to declare a housing emergency. In addition to basing the emergency on vacancy rates, they can declare an emergency after considering publicly available data, such as local rent burdens and availability of affordable housing, and hold public hearings.\nSen. Brian Kavanagh, the bill\u2019s sponsor and chair of his chamber\u2019s Committee on Housing, Construction and Community Development, called the measure \u201ca critical priority\u201d during a press conference hosted by lawmakers and Housing Justice for All, adding that he hopes it is approved this year. Assembly member Linda Rosenthal said there is no reason why other parts of the state \u201cshould not have the same rights and protections that we in New York City have.\u201d\nHomeowners for an Affordable New York, a coalition of landlord groups, disagree.\n\u201cExpanding these policies to municipalities statewide will only deepen the affordable housing shortage, raise costs for residents and hurt the people who need housing the most,\u201d the coalition said in a statement.\nGov. Kathy Hochul did not include the measure in her executive budget, nor another priority for the tenant advocates: an increase in funding for the state\u2019s housing voucher program. Hochul\u2019s budget calls for $50 million for the Housing Voucher Access Program, the same amount as last year and well short of the $250 million sought by lawmakers and advocates.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: What changes will the City Council make to\nCOPA\nbefore reintroducing the bill? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Vornado Realty Trust is listed as part of one of the teams vying to take over the Penn Station overhaul. New York Focus\nreports\nthat the real estate investment trust appeared on an Amtrak memo describing the members of each team that was selected as a finalist in the competition to become the station\u2019s master developer. Vornado was listed among several firms that make up the team led by Halmar.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\u00a0 On Saturday, Mayor Zohran Mamdani tapped Dr. Alister Martin as the commissioner of the city\u2019s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. The mayor also named Stanley Richards as commissioner of the city\u2019s Department of Correction and Yesenia Mata as commissioner of the Department of Veterans\u2019 Services.\n\u2014 Con Edison says salt mixed with melted ice and snow that has seeped to underground powerlines is to blame for outages in Brooklyn,\nGothamist reports\n. As of Monday, 2,000 customers in the borough were without power, according to Con Ed.\n\u2014 As of Friday, the city\u2019s snow-melting machines, spread out across eight sites, had liquified 23 million pounds of snow, according to the mayor.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$29.5 million\nfor a condominium unit at 53 West 53rd Street. The condo is new construction and 6,500 square feet.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s\nRenee Micheli, Jade Chan, Frances Katzen and Michelle Griffith had the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$12.5 million\nfor 639 Grand Street. The Williamsburg retail building is 9,500 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $57.5 million for 8 East 62nd Street. The Lenox Hill home is nearly 15,000 square feet. It last sold on the market in 2022 for $48 million.\nThe Modlin Group\nhas the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 42,075-square-foot, nine-story, 78-unit residential building at 622 Ocean Avenue in Flatbush. Leandro Dickson of LND Architect is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "On a cold morning in January, the head of the city\u2019s housing agency, Dina Levy, toured apartment buildings in Hell\u2019s Kitchen.\nThe buildings, at 351-357 West 45th Street, were once owned by notorious landlord Steve Croman and are undergoing a $20 million renovation by the new owners, SMJ Development, High Point Property Group and Services for the UnderServed.\nThe transformation of these buildings is linked to both Levy\u2019s past roles and her new one as the city\u2019s new commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. Before joining Mayor Zohran Mamdani\u2019s administration, Levy was working as a senior advisor to the New York Attorney General when that office brought criminal and civil charges related to allegations of mortgage fraud and\ntenant harassment\nagainst Croman in 2016. Years later, HPD provided financing for a significant renovation of the properties, which were dilapidated and rodent-infested when the new owners took over.\nLevy is taking HPD\u2019s helm as it navigates how best to handle buildings in deep distress, and as it gears up to take on bad landlords through the\nOffice to Protect Tenants\nand \u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings. For extreme cases, Mayor Mamdani\nhas said\nthat the city will seize buildings from\nslumlords who fail\nto make urgent repairs, and administration officials have\nenumerated\nthe benefits of city ownership.\nBut in an interview last week, Levy said the city doesn\u2019t just seize property. She pointed to the city\u2019s 7a program, under which court-appointed administrators take over management of buildings where conditions are unsafe. Properties with unpaid tax bills have also been transferred through the city\u2019s\nthird-party transfer program\nand the lien sale.\nBefore working for the state Attorney General, Levy was the director of organizing at the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board (a nonprofit that has taken over buildings through the third-party transfer program and worked with tenants to convert the properties into limited-equity co-ops).\nMost recently, she served as the senior vice president of single-family and community development with the state\u2019s Division of Homes and Community Renewal, or HCR.\nLevy was charged with a broad portfolio at HCR, where she ran the agency\u2019s homeownership new construction program, as well as some small, multifamily rental construction, while also\u00a0 overseeing its resiliency work and the State of New York Mortgage Agency.\n\u201cWhat I think I missed when I was at the state was a place-based perspective. You\u2019re running to Syracuse, Rochester, Long Island and New York City,\u201d she said in a recent interview. \u201cThere\u2019s something nice about being back in a place where you are focused on the metes and bounds of the city, and can be a lot more strategic.\u201d\nDuring an interview last week, Levy described how she\u2019s thinking of her new role. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\nWhat do you see as your priorities coming into HPD?\nI\u2019ve been cautious about jumping to conclusions because it\u2019s a big agency. But I had a sense of the top issues from a meta-perspective. Probably in this order, there is a lot of fragility in the existing affordable stock, but also in the privately-owned stock, in the rent-regulated and also the market-rate. That\u2019s largely driven by a significant rise in expenses, with insurance, taxes and utilities. I think a big piece of what we\u2019ll be focused on is: preservation, shoring up both our partners who are already subsidized and also opportunities [where] there [are] struggling portfolios that the city can intervene and then bring under a regulatory framework that preserves and actually expands the amount of affordable housing.\nWhat else?\nWe obviously have to build a lot more. I think the big challenge [is] the rising cost of construction. I was doing a lot of work at the state, looking at new technologies, looking at off-site construction, factory-built. I know we\u2019ve tried some modular projects that haven\u2019t necessarily achieved the full success that everybody\u2019s hoping for, but I think there\u2019s some interesting diagnostics that we\u2019re doing right now about why that isn\u2019t working, and what we could do to make it work.\nThe third thing is efficiencies to bring into HPD and across other city agencies to build faster, more efficiently. Sometimes HPD gets a bad rap that somehow we\u2019re slowing things down, or we\u2019re too bureaucratic. I would say the work that comes out of that agency is awe-inspiring, but that is not to say there aren\u2019t efficiencies or improvements that I think we can bring to bear.\nThere\u2019s a fourth [that will be the focus of the mayor\u2019s Office to Protect Tenants]: Are we doing everything we need to do in terms of enforcement? When I was at the AG, we formed this task force that still goes on between HCR, the AG, HPD and Department of Buildings. I think that that needs to be looked at again, to say, are we getting out to portfolios, early upstream, to prevent that [systemic] deterioration?\nWhat should the city\u2019s role be in taking over such properties?\nWe don\u2019t take over properties. It\u2019s not quite how I would put it. We typically don\u2019t own real estate, and probably shouldn\u2019t own real estate. I do think we should be facilitating transactions like [the Croman property]. We need to have the ability to both use our enforcement tools to bring the bad actors to the table, and then finance preservation purchases. I think that is our role with the Office to Protect Tenants.\nWith that office, though, there\u2019s been a lot of talk about seizing properties.\nI think we should be careful about seizing property. There\u2019s a constitution. We can\u2019t take property. But I think there are enforcement actions that we can bring to bear, that we can do things like\n7a\n, and when there is complete willful disregard for the law, we can remove a manager, or remove an owner and put in responsible management. We have a huge network of affordable for-profits and nonprofit partners who are willing to take on projects. Our job is to make those matches and facilitate, from a financial perspective, those transactions.\nDo you think nonprofits are in a better position to stabilize these properties?\nWe need a big tent, right? There is certainly a huge role for the nonprofits to play, but also for the for-profit, mission-based affordable housing providers. Nonprofits, by definition, are doing this without a motivation for profit, which is important when you\u2019re creating affordable housing. I think they have a particularly important role to play, but not to the exclusion of a bunch of really good for-profit developers who are mission-focused, who are not looking to exceedingly take profit out of buildings, but actually want to invest in their buildings. I think we need both. There\u2019s also a third option, which is tenant ownership, which has a role to play in that debate.\nWhen you were at UHAB, you helped organize tenants at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue to avoid sale of the building to what was seen as a predatory buyer. But under the owner who took over, the property has many active violations. Do you still see that deal as a model?\nWorkforce Housing Group is [a] for-profit mission-based group. They\u2019ve owned the building a really long time, and the tenants made that selection. This was not foisted upon them. They selected Workforce Housing, and I think, have a really nice partnership. That building is going through [a multi-million-dollar] renovation. You have a responsible for-profit who is in partnership with the tenants, and now that it\u2019s time to recapitalize the building, they\u2019re doing that. It\u2019s understandable that as things age, they need to be recapitalized, but that\u2019s what a responsible landlord does. It\u2019s 100 percent the right model.\nThe City Council revived two bills that were vetoed by Mayor Eric Adams that create new regulations for city-financed housing. How will they affect HPD\u2019s ability to produce housing?\nThe question right now is: do these bills go too far in prescribing what\u2019s viable? In an effort to make sure we [are] building big enough units, are building enough homeownership, you can get over-prescriptive in a way that makes it really hard to respond to the market, so I think that\u2019s the balance that we have to strike.\nThe \u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings are focused on giving tenants an opportunity to testify about their experiences. But do you think the hearings will result in any policies that will help landlords?\nThe way we\u2019ve been thinking about the hearings, from HPD\u2019s perspective, is where we need to make improvements around code enforcement. One is a need to potentially expand the 7a program. That\u2019s been underutilized in the last few years. The second is really how we coordinate our efforts with other agencies, particularly DOB.\nThe thing that\u2019s come up most recently is we\u2019re hearing that some landlords or managers are using the threat of ICE to retaliate against tenants who complain or call 311, and I think that needs to be looked at very closely.\nOn the landlord question, which I haven\u2019t been thinking [about] as much through the lens of the hearings, I think there is fragility in the market, which means landlords are also struggling. We are exploring a number of ways to bring resources to well-meaning, law-abiding landlords that are potentially struggling. I think that struggle is largely being driven by expenses, which have increased significantly in just the last five years. One of the things we\u2019re looking closely at is insurance.\nWould that coincide with the rent freeze?\nWe\u2019re not going to solve this dislocation between expenses and income right now with a rent increase. I think the right thing to be doing is focusing on resources to make sure landlords can maintain their buildings, and what we can do to bring down some of the expenses. You can get overly focused on freezing rents or [not freezing] rents, but I think it sort of misses the point.\nWe hear a lot from developers about 485x and the construction wages attached to the property tax break.\nI\u2019ve started to have some conversations with landlords who are would-be users or actual users of\n485x\nabout what is working and what is not working. I want to have some real conversations to find out [if] we need to make some accommodations in light of the prevailing wage and the deeper affordability restrictions. I think there\u2019s an interesting question there about what the city and HPD specifically needs to do to make sure that program remains usable and effective, because I think it will be a big part of achieving the mayor\u2019s housing plan.\nDo you think there will be more examples of the city intervening in situations like the sale of the Pinnacle portfolio?\nI know there will. There are several portfolios that we have been watching. I think there will be some more portfolios coming down the pike that are going to either end up in foreclosure or bankruptcy or something similar. I think having the administration so directly focused on that is great. I see it as an opportunity to bring some of these units into HPD regulatory structures, potentially through financing, and also to be watching them very closely to make sure whoever is buying them \u2014\u00a0like in the case of Summit\nbuying\nthe Pinnacle portfolio \u2014 that we will be watching that very closely, and that they will be expected to repair the building, put in all the resources, not be harassing tenants.\n",

        "content": "The second week of the Alexander brothers\u2019 sex trafficking trial resumed testimony on the\nfirst video of an alleged attack presented in the case\n, showing Oren Alexander having sex with a 17-year-old woman who says she had no memory of the encounter or recording before she was contacted by the government.\nThe video and two witnesses that led off the week\u2019s proceedings add to the growing list of evidence and women presented to the court by prosecutors\nalleging brothers Oren, Alon and Tal\nworked together in a conspiracy to lure, incapacitate and attack women. The brothers have pleaded not guilty and deny the allegations.\nAttorneys for the brothers on Monday morning contended with potential complications from outside the courtroom, requesting a mistrial following reporting that the brothers were named in the DOJ\u2019s latest tranche of files related to the\nJeffrey Epstein case\n. After questioning individual jury members on whether they had been made aware of anything about the Alexander brothers outside of the courtroom, which all of the jurors denied, Judge Valerie Caproni denied the request.\nMonday\u2019s proceedings picked back up on testimony from a woman seen in a video that prosecutors have cited as the basis of\nOren\u2019s sexual exploitation of a minor charge\n. The file, found on a backup of Oren\u2019s computer, was sent the same night it was captured.\nA woman testifying under the pseudonym Amelia Rosen told the court that she was contacted by the government with a video of the alleged rape, which she had no recollection of and had never seen. The video was shown privately to individual members of the jury.\nShe described working as a model when she was 17 years old, including taking cocaine and other drugs and knowing promoters who invited models to dinners and other events. Rosen, who was born in what was then the U.S.S.R. and is now Ukraine, emigrated to the U.S. when she was 14 years old.\n\u201cIt was very painful and upsetting and very confusing for me to see the things in the video,\u201d she said, calling it \u201cone of the hardest moments of my life.\u201d\nThe video, she said, showed two men having sex with her. \u201cI\u2019m not in an alert state. I look under the influence and I\u2019m not present,\u201d she said.\nMarc Agnifilo, an attorney for Oren, briefly cross-examined Rosen, first confirming the video was captured two months shy of her 18th birthday. He also pressed her on the identities of promoters she came into contact with at the time, who worked with nightclubs and would take models to dinner in exchange for their attendance at certain nightlife spots.\nAnother weekend in the Hamptons allegedly gone wrong\nMonday also saw testimony from a woman testifying under the pseudonym Bela Koval, who alleges she was raped by Oren in 2016.\nKoval testified that she was drugged and raped by Oren during a weekend in the Hamptons in the summer of 2016. Koval, then 23 years old, matched with Alon on the dating app Raya and her friend matched with Oren. Through her friend, the brothers invited them to an all-expenses-paid trip to the Hamptons over Labor Day weekend, Koval said, with a private chef, boat trips and more. She and her friend were promised a private bedroom.\nKoval, who had recovered from a major abdominal surgery about eight to nine months earlier, said she was looking forward to the trip. \u201cI had just had surgery, I was recently single. I wanted to explore the Hamptons for the first time,\u201d she said.\nThe brothers \u2014 Oren, Tal and Alon \u2014 \u201cseemed genuinely happy for us to be there,\u201d Koval said about their arrival at the Hamptons house, which appears to be the\nsame home\ndescribed in testimony delivered last week by a woman who says she was raped by Tal in 2014.\nOn the second day of the trip, the brothers told the women, including others, to wear swimsuits for a party later that day. But when other guests, including clients of the Alexanders, began arriving, Koval said they were dressed more formally than she expected, so she changed into a red jumpsuit. At some point, Oren came up to her and gave her a drink. She took a few sips, but avoided drinking more because of her surgery and subsequent Crohn\u2019s disease diagnosis.\nKoval then described feeling like a switch went off and not feeling like herself. She began to lose control of her body and struggled to make it inside the house, where she planned to go straight to her bedroom. \u201cNever in my life\u201d had she felt like that, she said. That\u2019s when Alon saw her and pulled her into another bedroom, where she laid down.\n\u201cI closed my eyes and I was awoken to the door opening and Oren walking into the room. This is when I realized that I had lost the ability to move my legs and limbs,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mind, I was fully awake and aware. I was able to speak, but it was very faint.\u201d\nShe said that Oren pulled out a condom, got on top of her, pinned her down and raped her. \u201cHe had this brooding energy, almost like anger. He did not say a single word to me,\u201d she said, adding that she woke up the next day in the same bedroom.\nKoval said she and her friend felt trapped and had to stay the day after the alleged rape. \u201cIt felt like I was forced to be around the person who raped me.\u201d They were able to leave the house without the Alexanders noticing the next day, thanks to a friend of a friend.\nProsecutors also questioned Koval on inconsistencies in the story she initially shared with them and her testimony, including what she was wearing at the time of the attack and whether she joined the Alexanders and others on a boat the following day.\n",

Fessler sold his oceanfront Manalapan estate for $31.5 million,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nFessler sold the mansion at 880 South Ocean Boulevard, according to listing agents Antonio and Pascal Liguori with Premier Estate Properties. The Liguoris also represented the buyer in the deal. They declined to comment on the buyer\u2019s identity and the deed has yet to appear in public records.\nFessler is an aviation executive with ties to several aftermarket aircraft products companies, including Magellan Aviation Group and Aeronautical Support International, according to records and published reports. He has also invested in other luxury residential properties in Palm Beach County over the years. In 2017, he sold a spec mansion in Palm Beach for $49 million, the\nPalm Beach Daily News\nreported.\nRecords show he and Daphne Fessler bought the Manalapan mansion for $5.3 million in 2000. Built in 1988, the 1.6-acre estate includes a 6,700-square-foot main house with four bedrooms and four bathrooms, according to property records. It also has a two-bedroom, two-bathroom guest house, the listing shows. The estate\u2019s amenities include a theater, a pool, a dock and 150 feet of frontage on both the ocean and Intracoastal Waterway.\nFessler renovated the home in the 2000s, Antonio Liguori confirmed. He declined to comment on the buyer\u2019s plans for the property, but said the adjacent estate sold as a teardown in 2023 for\n$37 million\n.\nFessler first listed the property for $45 million in 2024, and dropped the price to $38.5 million in February of last year, according to Zillow.\nLiguori said there\u2019s significant demand for the Manalapan market, but buyers are particularly focused on new construction homes, and sites and teardowns for building their own homes. Agents say ultra-luxury buyers like\nManalapan\nfor its larger lots, proximity to Palm Beach, and ocean-to-lake estates, which allow homeowners to have beach frontage as well as a personal dock on the Intracoastal Waterway.\n\u201cThey love the fact that there are other high caliber billionaires that live in the neighborhood,\u201d Liguori said.\nBillionaire Larry Ellison set a record in 2022 when he bought a 16-acre oceanfront compound for\n$173 million\n. Ellison then dropped\n$277.4 million\non the town\u2019s Eau Palm Beach Resort &amp; Spa in 2024.\nIn other recent Manalapan deals,\nbillionaire Randal Kirk\nfound a buyer for his estate asking $90 million after a significant price cut.",

        "content": "One of downtown Chicago\u2019s larger office buildings just sold at a bargain price to\na joint venture\nof two New York-based companies that includes the developer-owner of the Old Post Office.\nDavid Werner Real Estate and 601W Companies paid $41 million for the 1.4 million-square-foot office building at 175 West Jackson Boulevard, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The deal, which closed late last week, values the 22-story building at roughly $29 per square foot.\nNorthwind Group, a New York-based private equity firm, financed the purchase with a $58.5 million loan that included $33.5 million toward the acquisition and another $25 million earmarked for future leasing costs, according to a statement from the lender and people familiar with the deal. JLL brokers Jaime Fink, Bruce Miller and Sam DiFrancesca represented the seller.\nThe sale price is about 87 percent below the $306 million price Brookfield Asset Management\npaid for the Daniel Burnham\u2013designed property in 2018\n, or nearly $219 per square foot. Brookfield also poured roughly $24 million into renovations before the market turned, the outlet reported.\nThe transaction completes a painful haircut for Brookfield and for bondholders tied to the building\u2019s $280 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan, which landed the prooerty in foreclosure in 2022. LNR Partners, the special servicer overseeing the debt, confirmed the sale, but declined to comment. Brookfield also declined to comment, according to the publication.\nThe building \u2014 which spans an entire city block from West Jackson Boulevard to West Van Buren Street \u2014 was 47 percent leased as of the middle of last year, according to JLL marketing materials. A court-appointed receiver managed to stabilize things somewhat by extending the lease of anchor tenant Enova International, though the fintech firm downsized. Wolverine Trading, the property\u2019s second-largest tenant, is\nset to vacate\nabout 88,000 square feet in 2027 for the Old Post Office.\nThe purchase adds to a growing Loop portfolio for 601W, built on distress. The firm and Werner paid about $63 million late last year for the building at 303 East Wacker Drive, a roughly 66 percent discount off its 2018 price, with Northwind also providing financing. In November, 601W paid $35 million for the building at\n525 West Van Buren Street\n, down 74 percent from its prior sale price.\nThe buying spree comes even as 601W grapples with its own office headaches, including looming debt on the Aon Center and 1 South Wacker Drive in Chicago.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Two very different corners of Austin are lining up for major new development, with city approvals advancing a pair of high-rise towers near the University of Texas and clearing the path for a sprawling mixed-use project in South Austin\u2019s St. Elmo Arts District.\nNear\nUT\n, a full city block along West Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and West 18th Street could be remade with two towers rising 37 stories and 34 stories, according to city filings. The Austin Business Journal\nreported\nthat one building would house a 287-key hotel with 61 condos, while the other building would have 318 apartments. Together, the towers would include about 11,400 square feet of retail at street level.\nThe site, bound by Rio Grande Street, is currently a patchwork of low-rise uses, including Jack Brown Cleaners, the original Tiff\u2019s Treats location, a Jimmy John\u2019s and small apartment buildings. The Austin Planning Commission voted to advance zoning changes requested for the project Jan. 27.\nThe developer has not been publicly identified, but the applicant is seeking increased height allowances under Austin\u2019s Downtown Density Bonus Program, which would require City Council approval. The roughly 1.9-acre assemblage is split into two nearly 1-acre parcels separated by an alley that would remain in place, with one tower planned for each side.\nLandowners\ninclude 1806 Group LP, Jack Brown Family II Limited Partnership, Triple Play Properties LTD and Scott Sayers.\nFarther south, a very different type of development is moving forward at 4201 South Congress Avenue, where an eight-building\nmixed-use concept\nsecured a site development permit from the city. The approval, granted Jan. 23, allows construction to proceed through January 2029, the outlet\nreported\n.\nThe project, dubbed 4201 S Congress, calls for roughly 200,000 square feet of retail, restaurant and office space spread across mid-rise buildings at South Congress Avenue and Industrial Boulevard. The owner is 4201 S Congress Ave Owner LLC, which shares an address with California-based Redcar Properties, a developer active elsewhere in the\nSt. Elmo Arts District\n, according to the outlet.\nPlans show a mix of building sizes and uses, including restaurant and office buildings ranging from about 10,500 square feet to nearly 68,000 square feet, several standalone office structures and a six-story parking garage with 494 spaces and ground-floor restaurant space.\nThough Austin\u2019s office vacancy rate hovered around 26 percent at the end of last year, according to CBRE, new development has slowed sharply and absorption has begun to tick up. That might mean that by the time the South Congress project is completed, the current glut of space could look very different.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Fannie Mae said in the filing that Uniondale, New York-based Arbor Realty Trust lent the pair $11.5 million in July 2023 for the 152-unit apartment complex built in 1980.\nLoan trouble began for Del Sol\u2019s owners after\na 2024 fire\nat the property displaced a dozen residents and damaged at least 16 units at the complex. The incident also sparked a dispute between owner and lender over loan payments and property repairs, Fannie Mae said in the suit.\nThe foreclosure process began nearly a year ago when Fannie issued a foreclosure notice in March after claiming the owner defaulted on the loan. Sorotzkin and Menchel sued to block a May sale, according to the filing. The parties settled the dispute in Galveston County District Court, and the investors agreed to have a receiver appointed, Fannie Mae alleges in the suit.\nJudge Jeffrey V. Brown issued an order appointing a receiver in a Jan. 27 filing, court records show. Jacqueline Elizabeth Kimaz of Southlake, a Dallas suburb, will manage the property.\nMultifamily distress has hit Texas hard, as apartment investors struggled to hang onto properties they purchased when interest rates were low at the start of the pandemic. Experts warn the\nwave of foreclosures and receiverships is rising\n, as $19 billion in commercial mortgage-backed securities debt tied to Texas multifamily is set to mature this year.\n",

        "content": "A borrower has accused\nMaverick Real Estate Partners\nof muddying the waters of a loan extension to foreclose on a property.\nNow, the borrower has notched a temporary win with a court ordering the lender to halt any foreclosure.\nThe borrower, connected to\nHilson Management and the Schwalbe family\n, owes a Maverick affiliate $41 million. But when the borrower tried to extend the loan, Maverick\u2019s affiliate allegedly engaged in \u201cvulturous tactics\u201d \u2014 agreeing to take a $400,000 fee to settle the issue, taking the money and then refusing to hold up its end of the bargain, according to the complaint.\nMaverick has gained a reputation as an aggressive real estate lender\n, buying up debt to foreclose. The allegations in the complaint provide an inside look at the firm\u2019s playbook, including conduct that may be over the line for the court.\nThe building at the center of the loan is an early 20th-century property known as the Gorham Building, located at 390 Fifth Avenue. The building has been connected with the Schwalbe family since at least 1969, according to public records.\nThe borrowers owed a $41 million payoff to Maverick due this past New Year\u2019s Eve. But the agreement included an option to extend the loan, one that the borrowers intended to exercise.\nBut after the borrowers reached out and paid a $200,000 extension fee, Maverick allegedly piled on additional requirements. Maverick told borrowers they had to pay $1.5 million in interest shortfall to extend the maturity date, contrary to the loan agreement, the complaint alleges.\nThe parties allegedly agreed to a $400,000 sum instead, one that the borrower wired over.\nBut when Maverick sent out an extension agreement, that number suddenly became $750,000. After the borrower sent over more money, Maverick allegedly said it would refuse to extend the loan at all without the $1.5 million and would instead file for foreclosure on the property.\nThe complaint alleges that Maverick has yet to declare an event of default, but has nonetheless instituted a full cash sweep, leaving the borrower unable to pay for operating expenses.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, Terrence and Darren Oved of Oved &amp; Oved, said the court\u2019s order sends a message to the defendant that its attempts at coercion will fail.\n\u201cOur client\u2019s $50 million damages claim underscores the significant harm caused by Defendant, a harm which we intend to remedy,\u201d the attorneys said in a statement.\nNeither Maverick nor its attorneys on the case immediately responded to a request for comment.\nIn a letter to the court, attorneys for Maverick said the plaintiffs had a \u201ctortured reading\u201d of the loan agreement, which they say plainly requires the interest shortfall paid to secure an extension.\n",

        "content": "And just like that, a group of Boyle Heights residents could become homeless thanks to a former \u201cSex and the City\u201d background actor.\nOn Feb. 5, 85-year-old Columba Torralba and her family are set to be\nevicted\nfrom their apartment on Cesar E. Chavez Avenue after a years-long battle between the tenants and property owner Will Tiao, a former actor and director who left the entertainment industry for real estate and founded Tiao Properties in 2012, the Los Angeles Times reported.\nTiao, once a background actor on \u201cSex and the City,\u201d is planning to demolish the building containing three rent-controlled units to build a six-story residential building with 50 units above ground-floor retail space.\nTiao bought the property near the intersection of Cesar Chavez Avenue and Chicago Street in 2020 for $2.1 million. The landlord and his company, Tiao Properties, first\napplied to redevelop the lots the following year\n, earning city approvals in August 2023. The Los Angeles Department of City Planning gave the project a thumbs-up and said it believes the development will contribute \u201cto the revitalization of Cesar Chavez Avenue\u201d by inviting more\nfoot traffic\nand business, according to the Times.\nThe property owner argued that the development would help Los Angeles meet its housing production goals during a housing crisis. Five of the planned 50 units are reserved for extremely-low-income households, providing more\naffordable housing\nthan the current three units on the property.\nViva Padilla, who ran a bookstore called Re/Arte Centro Librario on the ground floor of one of Tiao\u2019s buildings on Cesar Chavez Avenue, filed an appeal of the city\u2019s decision to allow the development to continue. The appeal was considered by the East Los Angeles Area Planning Commission in early 2024. The Planning Department warned the commission that approving the appeal could open the city up to legal liability because Tiao\u2019s proposal did comply with the law.\nThe commission approved the appeal, and Tiao filed a lawsuit against the city in June 2024, saying the commissioners committed a \u201cblatant and knowing\u201d violation of the state\u2019s Housing Accountability Act. In early 2025, a\njudge ruled\nthat the East Los Angeles Area Planning Commission acted in bad faith in the case and directed the city to approve Tiao\u2019s project again. The city settled the case with Tiao for more than $170,000.\nShortly thereafter, the Torralba family received their first notice to vacate their apartment. They got another letter in December informing them Tiao will provide $25,700 in relocation assistance but would forfeit that money and be subject to \u201cimmediate eviction\u201d if they aren\u2019t out by Feb. 5.\nTiao\u2019s attorney, Cynthia Juno, told the Times the $25,700 was the maximum Tiao Properties could give the Garcia family in relocation assistance. \u201cWe understand why residents are concerned about displacement and rising costs in Boyle Heights,\u201d Juno said. \u201cThese are real pressures across Los Angeles and especially in neighborhoods with deep cultural roots.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "California\u2019s proposed billionaire tax isn\u2019t on the ballot yet, but fears about its impact are already mounting.\nSome billionaires are already leaving California to escape the potential tax, though its overall impact\nisn\u2019t expected\nto be catastrophic for the Bay Area or the state, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nIf the tax qualifies for the November ballot and is approved by a majority of California voters, the state would impose a one-time 5 percent tax on more than 200 billionaires residing in California based on their net worth as of Dec. 31.\nGov. Gavin Newsom\nis among the opponents of the measure, saying California\u2019s wealthiest taxpayers would flee the Golden State. Others believe the tax could lead entrepreneurs to shy away from the Bay Area, in turn lowering job growth and chilling housing demand in the region.\nIf the tax passes, some startup founders could launch companies elsewhere out of fear that California could levy another wealth tax in the future. \u201cEveryone assumes they\u2019re going to be a billionaire,\u201d Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s John Young told the Chronicle. But most homebuyers likely won\u2019t experience much impact from the tax, as billionaires have little reason to relocate their companies outside of California, Redfin economists told the Chronicle.\nThe potential \u2014 though unlikely \u2014 departure of many tech companies wouldn\u2019t do much to drive down home prices, as housing supply in the Bay Area faces geographic and regulatory constraints that keep the market highly competitive, according to the Chronicle. The presence of top-tier universities and other large non-tech companies are also expected to uphold a high baseline demand for Bay Area homes.\nBuyers hoping for affordable housing after\nbillionaires\u2019 flight\nwill likely be disappointed, some unnamed industry insiders told the Chronicle. \u201cIt\u2019d have to be a mass exodus,\u201d Adam Touni, a Silicon Valley real estate broker with Compass, said. \u201cAnd moving\u2019s not easy.\u201d\nBillionaire residents hypothetically\nleaving the state\nin droves would affect California\u2019s revenue in the long term, as the top 1 percent of earners in the state have accounted for more than 40 percent of taxes paid by Californians, according to the California Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office. If that revenue took a sizable hit, the state would lack funding for many social services, including affordable housing.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Eliot Spitzer is crossing over to Connecticut for a development project shrouded in mystery.\nSpitzer Enterprises \u2014 the real estate firm helmed by the former governor of New York \u2014 purchased several contiguous parcels close to the Stamford train station, CT Insider\nreported\n. The purchase price was not disclosed and public records didn\u2019t include the purchase prices of 495 Pacific Street and 560 Atlantic Street.\nA representative of Spitzer\u2019s firm confirmed the series of real estate purchases to the outlet and tipped the plan of apartment development, but said little more.\nThe lots \u2014 which are also tied to Garden Street \u2014 were largely demolished before the pandemic, leaving them vacant for years. That could give Spitzer leeway for development. The projects don\u2019t appear on upcoming agendas for the city\u2019s planning and zoning boards.\nSpitzer could not immediately be reached for further comment by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nDon Corbo, who brokered the sale to Spitzer, pointed to the importance of the \u201ctransit-oriented zone\u201d and said architectural plans were in the works for a \u201cbig\u201d finished project.\nSpitzer\u2019s never shown any fear of a large project, though. Or a large fight.\nIn 2023, Spitzer\nreceived the green light\nfrom the Landmarks Preservation Commission to demolish an existing property at 985 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan to develop a 19-story luxury condo building with 26 units.\nWhile the property was able to be built as-of-right, the co-op board of the neighboring property filed an adverse possession lawsuit over a pit on the south side of Spitzer\u2019s property, arguing that it had been a storage site for more than a decade.\nMore recently, Miki Naftali agreed to buy Spitzer\u2019s rental tower at 800 Fifth Avenue on the Upper East Side for\nmore than $800 million\n.\nDemand for rental space is strong in Stamford, which is along the Metro North, but also has its own office and retail corridors. Rents are expected to rise by 4 percent this year in Stamford, according to a recent report from Marcus &amp; Millichap.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Clipper Equity\u2019s riverfront residential tower landed long-term financing from JPMorgan Chase and Citibank, and Madison Realty Capital scored a bridge loan for its 473-unit multifamily development Greenpoint Central.\nEven office made a cameo, with JEMB Realty securing fresh debt as part of a recapitalization at 1 Willoughby Square in Downtown Brooklyn.\nHere are December\u2019s top five outer borough loans.\nCarlyle cash | $486M | multiple neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens\nWalker &amp; Dunlop\noriginated a $485.6 million Freddie Mac loan to refinance a sprawling multifamily portfolio owned by Greenbrook Partners and Carlyle Group. The fresh financing for the 262-townhouse portfolio spanning multiple Brooklyn and Queens neighborhoods replaced a $500 million loan from Invesco. Walker &amp; Dunlop\u2019s Matthew Wallach, Stephen West and Walker Layne arranged the 10-year floating-rate loan.\nCarlyle teamed up with Greenbrook in 2021\nand stitched together a half-billion-dollar portfolio of small apartment buildings that fall into the city\u2019s 2A/2B tax designation, which limits increases on real estate taxes to no more than 8 percent a year. These properties have no more than 10 units and tend to be mostly free-market, avoiding the severe restrictions\nimposed on owners by the 2019 rent stabilization law.\nRiverfront refi | $405M | Greenpoint\nJPMorgan Chase and Citibank\nprovided a $405 million loan to refinance Clipper Equity\u2019s Tower 77 in Greenpoint. The fresh financing for a 746-unit complex at 77 Commercial Street converted last year\u2019s\n$430 million bridge loan\ninto a five-year term. Clipper landed the bridge loan last May, months after topping out construction on the three-building complex. That debt retired a $386 million construction loan provided by the Bank of China and SL Green shortly into the pandemic. The 799,000-square-foot property, unspooled along the East River, was designed by CentraRuddy Architecture. There are 230 affordable units, as well as 40,000 square feet of amenities, including a pool, a sauna, a fitness center, a tennis court, a game room and a pet spa.\nMultifamily moolah | $285M | Greenpoint\nTPG Real Estate Credit\nprovided a $285\u202fmillion loan for Madison Realty Capital\u2019s 473-unit multifamily development Greenpoint Central. The bridge loan for 65 and 75 Dupont Street replaces a $180 million construction loan from Elliott Investment Management. Located on a Superfund site once belonging to a\nplastics factory\n, the development includes studio, one\u2011 and two\u2011bedroom apartments, 30 percent of them affordable. Madison took ownership of the troubled project in 2021 after Bo Jin Zhu\u2019s DuPont Street Developers filed for bankruptcy.\nBlackstone bucks | $269M | Forest Hills\nWells Fargo\nprovided a $269 million loan to Blackstone for a sprawling multifamily apartment complex and an adjacent office building in Forest Hills. The fresh financing for 104-20 and 104-70 Queens Boulevard replaced a $269 million loan from Newmark. Blackstone bought the 1,327-unit three-tower apartment complex, known as Parker Towers, and the adjacent office building in 2018 for $475 million.\nJEMB juice | $125M | Downtown Brooklyn\nDeutsche Bank\nprovided a $125 million loan for the lower floors of JEMB Realty\u2019s office tower at 1 Willoughby Square. The new mortgage was part of a complex transaction that included new equity and the division of the 35-story tower into condos. Among the latest round of investors is\nEdmond Safra, a member of the Safra banking family\n, alongside Adnane Mousannif\u2019s AVRS Partners and KSR Capital principals Abraham Kassin and Morris Sabbagh. The Deutsche loan includes a $75 million A-note sold into a CMBS conduit. The sponsors also kicked in $68.5 million in fresh equity, according to Fitch, used largely to retire $179.5 million of existing debt, cover closing costs and seed a nearly $10 million reserve.\n",

        "content": "CGI Merchant Group is catching zero breaks, as its South Florida portfolio unravels under the crushing weight of debt woes.\nIn the latest trouble, the firm lost the 15-story 550 Biltmore office building, at 550 Biltmore Way, in Coral Gables.\nMiami-Dade Circuit Judge Abby Cynamon issued a judgment last month for $61.3 million in favor of lender SDI Biltmore Borrower, an entity tied to Coral Gables-based Secured Debt Investments, ordering a foreclosure sale March 23. The amount breaks down to $49.2 million owed in principal for a 2021 loan, $12.1 million in default interest and $68,000 for attorney fees and for other expenses.\nBut CGI Merchant already had lost the building in a Uniform Commercial Code proceeding before the judicial foreclosure, according to the lender.\n550 Biltmore, completed in 1986 on a 1-acre site, has a Mediterranean Revival style that\u2019s common in Coral Gables. CGI Merchant paid\n$54.4 million\nfor the building in 2019, borrowing $46.5 million from MSD Partners (now called BDT &amp; MSD Partners). In 2021, New York-based Cerberus Capital Management refinanced the loan, bumping it to $48.7 million, records show.\nCGI Merchant\u2019s affiliate, CGI Fund I Biltmore, defaulted on the loan when it matured in May 2024, according to a Miami-Dade Circuit Court complaint filed in August.\nCerberus first filed a UCC foreclosure on the building in late 2024. A UCC foreclosure is generally much quicker than a judicial proceeding and is a foreclosure on the interest in the entity that owns an asset, instead of on the property itself.\nCerberus assigned the loan to Secured Debt Investments in May, records show. Secured Debt Investments finalized the UCC foreclosure, essentially acquiring the interest in CGI Fund I Biltmore but then filed the August judicial foreclosure suit in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, according to Secured Debt Investments\u2019 Orlando Garcia. The judicial proceeding is done to ensure there are no liens or other issues with the property, he said.\nSecured Debt Investments plans to submit a credit bid at the foreclosure sale and also to see who else bids, Garcia added.\nCGI representatives and Thomas didn\u2019t return requests to comment for this story.\nSince 2024, the firm has been bleeding assets as landlords nationwide felt the sting from elevated interest rates. Landlords in South Florida also were hit with skyrocketing insurance and other increases in overhead and maintenance expenses. The higher interest rates translated to larger debt obligations for landlords with floating-rate loans and no loan interest caps, and it made refinancing for maturing debt more expensive.\nIn\nprevious interviews,\nThomas said he was diligently working to refinance some of his debt, saying he had capital and equity lined up for some of his properties and was working to try to take back title to buildings he already lost to lenders.\nAt the time of Cerberus\u2019 UCC foreclosure, a CGI representative said in a statement the firm \u201cis working with all parties for a mutually positive resolution.\u201d\nIn December, CGI lost its 140-key Gabriel South Beach hotel in a court-ordered sale, with Park Central Lender acquiring the property for a $77,800 bid, according to court records. Park Central Lender, which had assumed the property\u2019s loan from Deutsche Bank, filed for foreclosure in July over the\n$69 million\nloan.\nOn the same August day in 2024, CGI lost both the 129-key\nGabriel Downtown Miami hotel\nand the Waldorf Astoria Washington DC, which the firm had bought in 2022 from the Trump Organization.\nCGI has staved off foreclosure on some of its properties, selling 65 commercial units at Ten Aragon Condominium in Coral Gables last year for\n$28.5 million\n. This allowed it to pay off most of the allegedly delinquent $24.2 million loan on the units that were in foreclosure.\nCGI Merchant sold its five-property Nexus co-working office portfolio in Palm Beach and Martin counties to Coral Springs-based commercial real estate investment firm TMT Properties for\n$31 million\nin November. TMT has a licensing agreement to continue operating the buildings under the Nexus name. At the time of the deal, three of the properties had loans that entered special servicing in January of last year due to delinquent debt payments, according to Morningstar Credit.\n",

The\ndevelopers\nplan to demolish the existing structure within months, start construction this fall and complete the first apartments in spring 2028.\nThe site sits near the North Branch of the Chicago River, an area that has seen a wave of residential proposals since the city loosened zoning restrictions in what was once a largely industrial stretch.\nNew housing\nis increasingly complementing the retail-heavy Clybourn Corridor, though large developable parcels in\nLincoln Park\nremain scarce, according to the outlet.\nThat scarcity is part of the wager, as downtown rents jumped last year amid a thin development pipeline, and popular neighborhoods like Lincoln Park have seen relatively little new supply compared to the West Loop.\n\u201cSupply in Chicago is already constrained,\u201d Shenouda said. \u201cLincoln Park in particular, there hasn\u2019t been a lot of new development.\u201d\nThe glass tower would rise from a six-story masonry podium housing amenities, including a fitness center, coworking space and a courtyard. About 80 percent of the apartments would be market-rate, with the remaining 20 percent \u2014 68 units \u2014 set aside as affordable under the city\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance, according to the site plans. Market-rate rents are projected at $4 per square foot to $5 per square foot.\nThe developers paid nearly $3.5 million for the Dayton Street property in 2024, records show.\nPeerless CEO Michael Cordaro told the outlet the team\u2019s low land basis and unique setup offer confidence. The project would mark Honore and Peerless\u2019 first ground-up high-rise after collaborating on several mid-rise conversions across the city.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Fort Worth\n\u2019s public hospital system, JPS Health Network, partnered with\nNRP Group\nto turn an old parking lot into an apartment complex.\nJPS formed a\npublic facility corporation\nto be a partner in the development of Thrive on Crawford, a 67-unit affordable housing project at 1310 Crawford Street, according to Cleveland-based NRP Group\u2019s Max Whipple, the firm\u2019s vice president of development. The recently completed project is adjacent to JPS\u2019 Southside Fort Worth campus.\nJPS owns the land the project is built on, and NRP Group leases the ground. Of the property\u2019s 67 units, seven are reserved for people making 30 percent of area median income; 24 are set aside for folks earning 50 percent AMI; and 29 are reserved for renters making 60 percent AMI. Seven units will be offered at market rate.\nThe project is part of the state\u2019s 9 percent housing tax credit program. The Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs selects projects for the competitive program, which provides equity for affordable housing development. The project also received financing from the Near Southside tax increment financing zone.\nThrive on Crawford cost about $21.8 million to develop, and the tax credits provided $15 million of the financing, Whipple said.\nThe pair teamed up in 2020 for the project, which opened in January. The pandemic got JPS leadership thinking about employees\u2019 commute times and sparked interest in providing affordable housing options for employees, Whipple said.\nNRP Group has developed similar projects in Ohio, partnering with Metro Health and Cleveland Clinic, Whipple said. To his knowledge, this project is the first of its kind in the state of Texas, but the developer has plans to utilize the public facility corporation program more widely in Texas. It is\npartnering with Austin Independent School District\non a $142 million, 674-unit multifamily project on property owned by the school district at 4900 Gonzales Street, Whipple said.\nThrive on Crawford is just one example of a hospital system becoming more involved in Texas real estate. On the office side, health care institutions are taking advantage of office distress by purchasing office properties they plan to use. For example,\nUniversity Health purchased\na 143,00-square-foot office building 6200 Northwest Parkway on San Antonio\u2019s Northwest Side in 2024 for $28 million or $196 per square foot.\n",

        "content": "San Antonio logged a stiff year-over-year drop in new home listings in December \u2014 the largest among the nation\u2019s biggest housing markets \u2014 a sign that would-be sellers are blinking as buyer demand thins and homes sit idle on the market.\nThe metro saw 2,120 new residential listings in December, down about 20 percent from a year earlier, according to Redfin data. That was the steepest decline among the top 50 U.S. metros and followed another weak month in November, when San Antonio ranked third nationwide with a 17.8 percent drop, the San Antonio Express-News\nreported\n.\nNationwide, new listings slipped a far milder 4.9 percent over the same period, highlighting how sellers in the Alamo City are retreating.\nThe pullback comes as San Antonio grapples with one of the\nmost lopsided housing markets\nin the country. As of December, the metro had 102.5 percent more sellers than buyers, the fifth-largest imbalance among major markets, according to Redfin. Many would-be buyers \u2014 especially first-timers \u2014 are\nopting to rent\nrather than lock in today\u2019s mortgage rates.\n\u201cThe rental market is quite appealing right now,\u201d Redfin economist Daryl Fairweather told the outlet, pointing to\nstable rents\nand borrowing costs that remain a hurdle, despite modest declines. San Antonio\u2019s large veteran population, which often relies on low down payment loans, is particularly sensitive to rate increases, she added.\nPeer cities across the Lone Star State aren\u2019t faring much better. Austin posted the nation\u2019s biggest seller-buyer imbalance in December, with 128 percent more sellers than buyers, alongside an 11.4 percent drop in new listings.\nDallas\nalso landed near the top of the imbalance rankings, with 86.8 percent more sellers than buyers, a gap fueled in part by years of aggressive homebuilding, according to the publication.\nThe imbalance is stretching out selling timelines. San Antonio homes spent a median of 99 days on the market in December, up 17 days from a year earlier \u2014 the second-largest increase among major metros, according to Redfin. Only Houston saw a bigger jump. In Austin, listings lingered even longer, at 106 days.\nSales are feeling the strain. In November, San Antonio recorded the largest year-over-year decline in closed sales nationwide, plunging from 2,683 in November 2024 to 2,082 closings in November 2025, or nearly 25 percent, according to Redfin.\nHigher mortgage rates remain a key choke point. More than half of U.S. mortgage holders are locked into rates at or below 4 percent, the Wall Street Journal reported, while 30-year rates hovered around 6.1 percent in late January, according to Freddie Mac. That gap is keeping many owners on the sidelines.\nThere is a glimmer of momentum, however, as pending sales in San Antonio ticked up 1.1 percent in December, year-over-year.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "One of New York\u2019s top\nbankruptcy\nattorneys Jonathan Pasternak has received a three-year suspension from practicing law in New York\u2019s Southern District Court.\nPasternak, of the law firm Davidoff Hutcher &amp; Citron, was suspended by the U.S. District Court of New York\u2019s Southern District, related to receiving $260,000 in undisclosed payments from controversial real estate investor Sam Sprei during a bankruptcy case.\nPasternak admitted to using most of the proceeds from Sprei to purchase a house.\nPasternak is a go-to bankruptcy attorney for mid-market dealmakers. His past clients included entities tied to\nYitzhak Tessler\n,\nJeff Simpson of Arch Companies\nand Steven Ostad.\nPasternak was working for the law firm DelBello Donnellan Weingarten Wise &amp; Wiederkehr at the time of the incidents leading to his suspension. He joined Davidoff Hutcher &amp; Citron in 2019.\nDespite the suspension, Pasternak remains employed at Davidoff Hutcher &amp; Citron and is allowed to practice in other courts.\n\u201cAll of the events occurred well before he was employed with us,\u201d said Larry Hutcher, a founding partner of Davidoff Hutcher &amp; Citron. \u201cThere has been no question about his integrity with us.\u201d\nHutcher noted that Pasternak is a \u201cgood lawyer\u201d who \u201cmade one mistake\u201d in a multi-decade career.\nAt the center of Pasternak\u2019s troubles is a contentious bankruptcy of a medical office property at\u00a0261 East 78th Street, according to an opinion issued by a grievances committee for New York\u2019s Southern District.\nThe owner of the property, Lee Moncho, hired Pasternak as his attorney to put the property into bankruptcy after it faced foreclosure from its lender MB Financial.\nDuring that process, Pasternak suggested to Moncho that he reach out to Sprei about serving as the funder of the bankruptcy plan. By early 2014, Moncho\u2019s bankruptcy plan was approved by the court. The property was sold to a company majority owned by Sprei.\nBut Pasternak never disclosed to his client or the court about his other deals with Sprei.\nSprei had previously offered to pay Pasternak a finder\u2019s fee for bankruptcy deals. In the case of the 261 East 78th Street bankruptcy, Sprei would also pay Pasternak after reaching certain milestones in the bankruptcy process. This included the court\u2019s approval of the bankruptcy plan.\nBetween September 2013 and February 2014, Sprei sent over four payments to Pasternak totaling $260,000.\nSprei made his largest payment when the bankruptcy plan was confirmed by the court on February 28, 2014. On that day, Sprei hand-delivered a $200,000 check to Pasternak, according to the grievances committee.\nFor years, Pasternak never disclosed these payments to his client Moncho, his law firm, or to the bankruptcy court, the U.S. trustee\u2019s office or the IRS, according to the Grievance Committee.\nMoncho filed a malpractice suit against Pasternak and others in 2017, claiming Pasternak negligently introduced him and encouraged him to do business with Sprei and his business partner Chaim Miller.\nA year later, an ethics counsel for Pasternak\u2019s law firm DelBello Donnellan Weingarten Wise &amp; Wiederkehr conducted an internal investigation and sent a letter to the bankruptcy judge admitting Pasternak accepted a $25,000 payment.\nBut Pasternak was less forthcoming about the other payments, according to the grievance committee. He had claimed his counsel disclosed the $200,000 payment to the U.S. Trustee in 2018, but the trustee overseeing the bankruptcy denied that Pasternak\u2019s counsel ever made the disclosure.\nThe grievance committee claims Pasternak only disclosed the $200,000 payment when the payment came to light during the discovery process as part of the lawsuit brought by Moncho.\nPasternak submitted a declaration on November 7, 2025, admitting to wrongdoing and taking responsibility for violating the court\u2019s rules. He consented to the three-year suspension.\nPasternak\u2019s suspension begins on February 9. He did not return a request for comment. An attorney for Sprei also did not return a request for comment.\nFor the better part of a decade, Sprei and his former partner\nChaim Miller\nbecame known for the lengthy legal battles with creditors and investors. Sprei was tasked with finding deals for Miller, but now he appears to be on his own. In August 2024, Sprei\npurchased\na 41-unit rental property from Madison Realty Capital.\n",

        "content": "Joe Cafiero shared some interesting details about what it\u2019s like to take over buildings whose owners have essentially walked away.\nAccording to Cafiero, a receiver whom the public advocate\nerroneously included\non the \u201cworst landlords\u201d list, one of the hardest tasks is collecting rent.\n\u201cIn most cases, the rent collection rate is 40 percent or 50 percent,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cThe tenants are not paying.\u201d\nBut he doesn\u2019t blame them because of the condition of the buildings.\n\u201cThey\u2019re in disrepair. Open accessways, doors, roofs are open, boilers haven\u2019t been serviced, sometimes there\u2019s no heat, tons of water intrusion,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody is angry [because of] the deferred maintenance. Now we\u2019ve got to make friends with everybody.\u201d\nMaking his job tougher, he\u2019s not the first stranger to have come knocking on tenants\u2019 doors.\n\u201cSome of these old landlords, they\u2019ve sold their collection rights to somebody else,\u201d Cafiero said. \u201cSo now you have three or four different guys coming in to collect rent saying they\u2019re the new manager. They\u2019re collecting cash. Now we come along and [the tenants] say, \u2018Who are you?\u2019\u201d\nIt would help if he had a list of tenants\u2019 names, but often the landlord doesn\u2019t turn over those records. So Cafiero tries to tag along with an inspector from the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.\n\u201cIf I introduce myself with HPD, I come in with credibility,\u201d the receiver said.\nBut often, that\u2019s not possible. So Cafiero and his staff also come with court orders,\ncompany ID tags\nand body cameras.\nA lot of the buildings he services are in Williamsburg and Borough Park. \u201cProbably 40 percent of my population is Spanish speaking,\u201d said Cafiero, adding that the buildings also have many African tenants.\nCommunication with tenants can be challenging. \u201cBut when you show them a court order,\u201d he said, \u201cthey see it\u2019s an official document. You start to have a little more faith.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nState Sen. Brian Kavanagh, who chairs the upper chamber\u2019s housing committee,\ntold Politico\nhe doesn\u2019t expect the legislature to change 485x this year to solve the\n99-unit problem\n(which comes as\nno surprise to me\n). The senator denied that the wage floor and associated risk triggered by 485x projects of 100 or more units are the reason developers are building so few of them. Rather, he blamed high interest rates and the fact that developers are busy doing office-to-residential conversions and finishing 421a projects. Does that ring true? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Cynthia Allison Malkin, the sister of Empire State Realty Trust CEO Tony Malkin, is married to U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut. Their engagement, when the bride-to-be was a senior at Harvard University and Blumenthal was 35, was\ncovered\nby the New York Times in 1981. \u201cMiss Malkin Plans Bridal\u201d was the headline.\nElsewhere\u2026\nIn the arcane world of New York rent regulation, three-bedroom apartments have lower rents, on average, than one-bedroom apartments, according to the New York Apartment Association.\nFrom a housing policy or economics perspective, that makes no sense whatsoever. But if you know the history of rent stabilization in New York, it makes perfect sense.\nLarge, low-rent units are incredibly valuable to tenants, so people keep them in the family for decades. Under the previous rent regulation regime, low turnover for a given apartment meant its rent grew exceptionally slowly.\nHigh turnover did the opposite: Vacancy allowed for a 20 percent rent hike plus the opportunity to make improvements and raise the rent commensurately.\nAll that changed with the new rent law of 2019, but the inversely proportional rent discrepancy between large and small apartments remains to this day. In fact, it\u2019s locked in.\nOn social media, the NYAA\u2019s Kenny Burgos\nhighlighted\na unit vacant since 2022 that needs more than $200,000 in renovations but has a legal rent of $815.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$11.8 million\nfor a 3,008-square-foot resale condominium at 212 Fifth Avenue in Flatiron. J. Chris Sousa with Sousa Real Estate had the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was $22.25 million for\n242 Elizabeth Street\nand\n236 Elizabeth Street\nfor a combined 12 units and 14,450 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$23 million\nfor a 3,547-square-foot condominium at 50 West 66th Street on the Upper West Side. Janice Chang with Douglas Elliman has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 43,937-square-foot, 10-story, 89-unit mixed-use project at 311 East 148th Street in Mott Haven. Nikolai Katz filed the permit on behalf of developer Joel Guttman.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Aston Martin Residences developer\nGerm\u00e1n Coto\nis accused of siphoning millions of dollars from condo owners, according to a bombshell lawsuit being reported for the first time by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nCoto is accused of running \u201can immense shell game\u201d via condo association contracts to vendors with close ties to Coto.\nThe 300 Biscayne Boulevard Way Condo Association sued Coto and a web of his business entities, as well as his mother and associates who allegedly helped him defraud the association before unit owners took over the board.\nThe complaint, filed in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, accuses the developer and his alleged cohorts of self-dealing, fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of Florida\u2019s Condominium Act. The association claims the alleged scheme left the building with incomplete records, misappropriated funds and long-term financial harm.\nThe lawsuit is seeking more than $5 million in damages.\nThe condo association hired lawyers and forensic accountants \u201cto uncover a lot of self-dealing, a lot of theft and a lot of manipulation by the management company to benefit the developer at the financial expense of the owners and the association,\u201d said Michael Diaz Jr., an attorney and Aston Martin Residences condo owner who was elected the association\u2019s president last year.\nAmong the accusations are allegedly bogus or inflated invoices paid for cleaning, security and water-damage repairs, as well as payments for concierge services that allegedly weren\u2019t provided and $70,000 in rent for an alleged sales office that Coto is accused of signing off on unilaterally.\nThe 66-story ultra-luxury tower was completed in April 2024 by an affiliate of Coto\u2019s Miami-based G&amp;G Business Developments, in a joint venture with the British automaker.\nIt was built with a\n$200 million\nconstruction loan, and the sellout for its 391 units reportedly topped $1 billion. Buyers included the scion of a medical device maker, who paid\n$23 million\nfor a condo on the 60th floor, and a Mexican industrial magnate, who paid\n$18 million\nfor a 62nd floor unit.\nCoto and Lewis Conwell, the attorney representing Coto\u2019s development entity, declined comment. Conwell said he has not seen the complaint and that his client has not been served with the lawsuit.\nNetwork rife with conflicts\nAston Martin condo buyers were lured with promises of a marina, helipad and exclusive beach club access, along with assurances of ethical governance and legal compliance, only to discover missing amenities and a developer-run board that allegedly raided association coffers, the lawsuit alleges.\nCoto and his allies used \u201ca network of interconnected companies\u201d to enrich themselves at the expense of the association and owners, the lawsuit alleges. Coto served as the association\u2019s original president and director, from November 30, 2023 through the turnover, while controlling multiple developer-related entities.\nOther defendants are Gloria Garcia, Coto\u2019s mother and a G&amp;G principal; former condo association secretary and treasurer Marcelo Scarinci and former vice president Guillermo Cacagno, both employees of the developer entities who were appointed by Coto; and Leonardo Polo and his wife Maria Eliana Polo, who are managers of the security firm and cleaning services company hired by the Coto-led condo association. Maria Eliana Polo allegedly was another G&amp;G employee.\nScarinci, Cacagno and the Polos did not respond to requests for comment.\nScarinci and Cacagno allegedly pushed through and signed key contracts with the Polo\u2019s companies, as well as with other entities controlled by Coto.\nFor instance, Scarinci allegedly authorized a lease agreement in October 2024 between the association and an entity managed by Coto that owns a unit on the third floor of\nAston Martin Residences\n.\nThe Coto-led board leased the condo for $8,500 a month to use as its management office even though the association already has a designated office space in the building that is free of charge, the complaint states. Coto was serving as the condo board president while designated as the landlord in the lease agreement. Yet, there are no meeting minutes reflecting a vote approving the lease and no disclosure of Coto\u2019s conflict of interest, the lawsuit alleges.\nCoto is accused in the lawsuit of using the unit as a sales office to market remaining units. He allegedly charged the condo association rent that far exceeded market rates, charged for furnishings that were not provided, and overstated the condo\u2019s leasable square footage, the complaint states.\nThe association paid roughly $70,000 in rent until the new board terminated the lease last year.\nCoto\u2019s entity that owns the unit responded by filing a lawsuit, which is still pending, against the condo association for $100,000 in damages.\nWhen it rains, it pours\nThe lawsuit accuses Coto of an alleged repair scheme tied to water damage in the building in May 2024.\nCoto allegedly arranged for his general contracting firm GC Builders to perform repair work without competitive bids, a board vote or disclosure of Coto\u2019s dual role, and without any written contract between the association and GC Builders.\nDespite scant documentation of what work, if any, was actually done, the Coto-controlled board and GC Builders profited from two insurance claims, the lawsuit alleges.\nCoto is also accused in the lawsuit of paying his own company for concierge services that weren\u2019t delivered.\nG&amp;G employee and then-board member Scarinci allegedly signed an agreement to pay $34,334 a month to International Booking, an entity tied to G&amp;G, but there are no board meeting minutes approving it, and that the conflict of interest allegedly was not disclosed.\nInternational Booking allegedly submitted boiler plate invoices for concierge services that lacked detail for exorbitant charges. When the owner-run board terminated the contract in April of last year, International Booking sued the condo association seeking payment for three months after the agreement was canceled.\nThe Coto-controlled board allegedly entered into agreements with the security firm and cleaning services owned by the Polos, the lawsuit states.\nThe security company was paid close to $800,000 despite having no prior experience, no web site and no track record, the lawsuit alleges. The cleaning services firm allegedly won its contract in April 2024 without competitive bidding and without a board vote, and improperly billed for items not in the contract, as well as excess hours unsupported by records.\nAriella Gutman, the attorney for the Aston Martin Residences condo association, said the developer and his associates grabbed as much money as they could from the association.\n\u201cThey took every financial advantage they could\u00a0 \u2026 there was nobody who was independent and that was not related to the main entities that developed this building,\u201d she said.",

Workforce management company Workday sold the five-story property totaling 209,000 square feet.

        "content": "Large apartments are overtaking detached homes in the nation\u2019s rental supply, and Dallas is leading the race, according to a decade-long study.\nThe share of single-family homes in the country\u2019s rental stock is shrinking, and Dallas has shifted faster than any other major city. From 2014 to 2024, units at large multifamily buildings in Dallas rose from 29.2 percent to 46.3 percent of the rental inventory, the largest increase among the top 50 metropolitan areas in the country,\nRedfin\nreports.\nMultifamily growth has acquainted Dallas with some strange bedfellows. The sprawling metro ranks eighth in America for multifamily units as a share of total rental inventory, right alongside some of the densest cities in the country. New York is first, with multifamily units taking up 69 percent of the rental inventory. Dallas lands between Chicago, where large apartments make up 45 percent of the rental inventory, and Washington, D.C., where multifamily units\u2019 share is 47.3 percent.\n\u201cWe have a little bit of a multifamily glut,\u201d said Steve Triolet, senior vice president of research and market forecasting at Partners Real Estate.\nVacancy rates in apartments with at least five units exceeded 11 percent across the Dallas/Fort Worth area last year. That pushed the 8 percent to 10 percent bound conventionally considered to show a neutral landlord-tenant relationship, according to Partners.\n\u201cSome of the submarkets I would consider tenant-favorable. You can get a lot of\nconcessions\n, free rent, stuff like that,\u201d Triolet said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the urban core \u2014 if you\u2019re in downtown, specifically \u2014 it\u2019s not uncommon to get six to eight weeks of free rent for signing a lease of a year or more. When you do the math on that, that shows a little bit of\ndistress\n.\u201d\nMultifamily builders in Dallas only recently\nput the brakes on a swift construction run\nthat led to some oversupply. At 92.6 percent, the Metroplex registered one of the lowest multifamily occupancy rates of the largest cities in the country last year, according to\nYardi Matrix\n.\nSingle-family builders have kept busy in North Texas as well, but they\u2019re also slowing. Construction began on about 8,300 homes in the fourth quarter of 2025, a\n17.7 percent year-over-year decrease\nfrom 10,190 starts in the same period of 2024.\nWhile multifamily and residential builders slowed last year,\nbuilt-to-rent developers\naccelerated. Over 5,800 units of built-to-rent homes were underway in Dallas in September, up 6.7 percent from June, according to\nRealPage\n. Dallas remains one of the nation\u2019s leading markets for built-to-rent development, which could suffer from a glut in the overall rental supply.\n\u201cThat\u2019s really new, and there\u2019s not really a proven exit strategy,\u201d Triolet said.\n",

        "content": "AT&amp;T is so far being welcomed with open arms by\nPlano officials\n, notching off one regulatory hurdle to move out of Downtown Dallas.\nThe Plano Planning and Zoning Commission on Monday unanimously approved a rezoning request from the telecom giant at the former Electronic Data Systems headquarters, where the company wants to relocate its global headquarters, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe planned redevelopment needs commercial employment zoning, which would provide the property owner greater leeway in redevelopment plans for different portions of the site. Dallas-based NexPoint controls 215 acres that include the former headquarters of Electronic Data Systems, including the nearly 100 acres at the southeast corner of Legacy Drive and Parkwood Boulevard identified for the zoning.\nThe commission also passed a waiver for the new zoning application to go through, as the suburb north of Dallas currently has a two\u2013year waiting period on the books until February of next year, according to the outlet. The full Plano City Council still needs to vote on the changes.\nRestoring the zoning would allow the site at 5400 Legacy Drive in\nPlano\u2019s Legacy development\nto be used for the\ncorporate headquarters\nalong with offices, retail, research facilities and light industrial uses. In January, AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey said the move was for office consolidation, saying the Plano site will allow AT&amp;T to \u201ccost effectively consolidate all Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex administrative space,\u201d including major offices in Dallas, Plano and Irving, while creating a purpose-built corporate campus,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported.\nStankey targeted the second half of 2028 for workers to begin decamping from the 37-story Whitacre Tower at 208 South Akard Street in Dallas, where its lease runs through 2030. The company relocated its headquarters to Dallas in 2008 after\nleaving San Antonio\n.\nNexPoint had previously sought another use for the Plano site before AT&amp;T\u2019s interest, as the firm secured zoning for a life sciences and research campus in 2023, according to the publication. That site plan included a utility plant, infrastructure and parking upgrades as well as a 200,000-square-foot manufacturing facility.\nNexPoint might be looking for a way to retain some of the life sciences on the rest of the site not contained in this round of zoning. Along with the old EDS headquarters, which was the information technology company founded by Ross Perot, a source told the outlet that the firm might try to attract life sciences firms to future satellite buildings within the area.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Owner plans also include parking for 419 vehicles and a rooftop deck.\nSanta Monica planning officials will have to review the proposal before it is scheduled for public hearings.\nThe site is located around the corner from\nBergamot Station\nArts Center, which the City of Santa Monica is hoping to transform into mixed-income housing. Last year, Santa Monica officials\nbegan searching for developers\nto build affordable housing on city land.\nThe 26th Street proposal is one of several in Santa Monica consisting of residences, including some affordable, above retail.\nLast month,\nTrammell Crow Company proposed\nreplacing an existing office complex at 2716 Ocean Park Boulevard with 456 residential units, including 46 affordable apartments, above 6,200 square feet of ground-floor retail.

        "content": "Shaya Prager has been officially kicked out of one of his suburban Chicago office properties \u2014 at least from the buildings.\nA\nforeclosure saga at the Corporate 500 office complex in Deerfield\nthat Prager\u2019s firm Opal Holdings spent $178 million to buy in 2022 reached a conclusion last month, when a Lake County judge approved Iowa-based lender GreenState Credit Union\u2019s seizure of the property through a court-ordered sheriff\u2019s sale, public records show.\nGreenState took over the four-building, 697,000-square-foot campus in a deal finalized late last month, with the discharge of a court-appointed receiver who managed the property during the foreclosure litigation. (I would note here if the deal has been finalized). The lender bought the $104 million loan note from previous lender Unify Financial Credit Union, which originated the loan to\nPrager\u2019s company\nfor the property\u2019s acquisition before it fell into default in late 2023.\nIt\u2019s unclear how much GreenState paid Unify to obtain the loan, but it traded while already facing foreclosure over Prager\u2019s firm missing property tax payments as well as monthly loan payments owed to Unify.\nA judgment amount of more than $130 million was entered in November against Prager\u2019s borrower entities in the foreclosure case. Prager fought GreenState\u2019s move to take over the property through a sheriff sale with some last-ditch legal motions filed late last year, court records show.\nAn Opal affiliate, Liberty Deerfield LLC, argued it should be allowed to file an objection to the approval of the sheriff\u2019s sale later than the deadline the court imposed because an attorney mistakenly believed filings were due a week later than they were. It also claimed the borrowers weren\u2019t given proper notice of the sheriff\u2019s sale before it was held, claiming GreenState only sent a notice of the auction five business days before the sale when it\u2019s required to give 10 such days.\nThe court wasn\u2019t swayed by the Opal affiliates, however, and approved the sale in November to GreenState, which won the sheriff\u2019s auction through a credit bid of $66 million, leaving a $64.9 million deficiency from the judgment against Shulamit Prager, who is Shaya Prager\u2019s wife, and the Opal entities. A spokesperson and an attorney for Opal didn\u2019t return requests for comment, while lawyers for GreenState and Unify also didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\nIn a move to stabilize the asset, the credit union appointed JLL last fall as the exclusive property manager and leasing agent, with about 25 percent of the office space still available to lease after Baxter-backed kidney care spinoff Vantive agreed to rent an entire building on the campus. GreenState has committed to spending additional funds on concessions such as tenant improvement allowances to build out interior office space and leasing commissions to attract additional occupants.\nWith the Opal-affiliated entities officially purged from the property\u2019s leasehold title, another challenge for the new ownership will be navigating a complex ground lease structure that defines the property \u2014 and Opal\u2019s broader controversial strategy.\nWhile GreenState now controls the buildings, it remains unclear if it\u2019s obligated to continue making ground lease payments to an entity led by Katherine Cartagena, who has been a frequent deal partner in Opal\u2019s acquisitions since 2020, often serving as the ground landlord in deals that allowed Opal to bifurcate land and building ownership to maximize leverage. The building ownership was required to make regular lease payments to the ground ownership, often on deals that span decades, as part of the transactions. The Deerfield ground rent was about $5 million annually, records show.\nThis foreclosure is merely one piece of a disintegrating portfolio.\nPrager spent billions on suburban office parks\nacross the U.S. as well as a Wacker Drive skyscraper in downtown Chicago during an aggressive mid-pandemic shopping spree, but is now mired in litigation across the Midwest.\nWhile the Deerfield foreclosure concludes, Prager\u2019s broader portfolio remains in turmoil as he faces ongoing litigation from Wisconsin nursing home investors alongside a trail of foreclosures spanning the\nTwin Cities\nand Fort Worth\u2019s\nBurnett Plaza\n.\n",

The loan goes toward the 421-unit QLIC, which opened its doors to residents more than a decade ago.\n\u201cQLIC exemplifies the type of high-quality, stabilized asset we look to support, with durable cash flow, high occupancy, and a prime, transit-oriented location in Long Island City,\u201d KKR managing director Adam Simon said in a statement.\nA JLL team led by Christopher Peck, Lauren Kaufman and Michael Shmuely negotiated the refinancing.\nThe building features 55 studio apartments, 297 one-bedroom apartments, 53 two-bedroom units and 16 three-bedroom units, as well as 8,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space. Amenities include a fitness center, a rooftop pool with cabanas, a media lounge, a communal workspace and on-site parking.\nThe magic number at QLIC is 421. In addition to that being the number of units in the building, the developers also benefited from a tax abatement secured under the city\u2019s former 421a program (which has since been replaced by 485x).\nElsewhere in Long Island City, M &amp; T Realty Capital Corporation recently provided a\n$347 million loan\nto refinance TF Cornerstone\u2019s luxury waterfront tower. The loan for the 575-unit building at 2-20 Malt Drive is backed by Fannie Mae\u2019s Near Stabilization program.\nLate last year, Rabina locked down a refinancing package for its Fifth Avenue supertall. Carlyle Group provided a\n$640 million condo inventory loan\nfor 520 Fifth Avenue, replacing a $540 million construction loan from Bank OZK and Carlyle\u2019s Global Credit business as the mixed-use tower moves towards leasing and sales.\nIn June, KKR\u2019s private commercial real estate financing pipeline reached a\nrecord $42 billion\n, driven by dislocations in the traditional lending market.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Monthly rents range from $1,920 to $3,759, according to the property\u2019s website.

The asking price amounts to $291,700 per unit.\nMiami-based Resia developed Village at Mangonia Lake, and the property\u2019s ownership entity ties to Resia. But Turkell said CIX Capital, a S\u00e3o Paulo-based investment firm that\u2019s part of Brazil\u2019s investment and development firm Maiz, is listing the site.\nCIX Capital launched CIX AHS Multifamily Income Bond in 2021 to co-invest with Resia in multifamily. It announced plans in 2024 to direct its investments to South Florida multifamily, according to its website and Brazilian news reports.\nSouth Florida\u2019s multifamily market has been recalibrating.\nAfter a pandemic-induced influx of out-of-staters, unprecedented demand prompted record rents, and developers seized on the\nboom\nwith hefty apartment completions. As a result, the market has felt the sting from a\nsupply overhand\namid slower in-migration, leading to a drop in rents and increased concessions.\nIn December, the median asking rent in South Florida hit $2,262, a 3.4 percent decline year-over-year, according to\nRealtor.com\n.\nStill, the decision to sell a complex also is tied to when the landlord bought the properties and their investment strategy, Turkell said.\nThe apartment properties\u2019 listing comes as RFR Realty put on the for-sale market this month the 30-story 100 Biscayne office tower, at 100 Biscayne Boulevard, in downtown Miami for about\n$130 million\n.\n",

The homes that went pending last week total $273.5 million in asking dollar volume and averaged 84 days on the market. The previous week, buyers signed 21 contracts totaling\n$132.5 million\n.\nThe report tracks signed contracts for single-family homes and condos asking $3 million or more in the Beaches MLS. It identified 61 new listings, and 1,268 active listings on the market.\nOf the properties that went pending last week, 26 were single-family homes, and 11 were condos.

They spent an average of 81 days on the market.\nThe average asking price for the single-family homes was $8.4 million, or $1,687 per square foot, and they spent an average of 88 days on the market.\nThe most expensive listing to find a buyer last week was the 4,700-square-foot waterfront home at 751 Island Drive in\nPalm Beach\nasking $35 million.\nRecords show the seller is the estate of the late Patsy Johnson, who was the widow of financier and Flagler National Bank founder Dick Johnson. She died in July. The couple bought the home for $2.4 million in 1994. It was built on 0.4 acres in 1988 and had five bedrooms, four bathrooms, one half-bathroom, a pool and a dock, records show.\nThe home listed for $35 million in November with Jim McCann of Premier Estate Properties.\nThe next most expensive home to go pending last week was the 5,600-square-foot house at 242 Tangier Avenue asking $17.8 million.\nRecords show the sellers are Julie and Thomas Frist III, who bought it for $7.9 million in 2016. Thomas Frist III\u2019s grandfather and namesake founded HCA Healthcare, a multi-billion dollar operator of health care facilities. The Tangier Avenue home was built on 0.3 acres in 2008 and includes five bedrooms, six bathrooms, two half-bathrooms, a pool and a guest house.\nIt hit the market for $17.8 million in December with Crista Fanjul Ryan of Tina Fanjul Associates.",

The penthouse went into contract with a last asking price of $17.5 million, according to StreetEasy.\nThe deal comes three years after the building\u2019s other penthouse on the 33rd floor appeared to go into contract with an asking price $17.5 million. That unit then appeared back on StreetEasy asking $15 million last summer without having closed, before being taken off the market at the end of the year. (The New York Post\nreported\nthe wishy-washy buyer was actor Michael B. Jordan).\nIf Penthouse B closes at that price, it would be the second most-expensive condo sold in the borough and the most expensive on a price per square foot basis, at over $3,550 per square foot, according to a spokesperson for the building. A condo at Quay Tower that\nsold for $20.3 million\nstill holds the record for the borough\u2019s most expensive condo trade.\nSpanning almost 5,000 square feet across the entire 32nd floor of the sail-shaped building on 30 Front Street known as the Olympia Dumbo, the 10-room condo features five bedrooms, four full bathrooms and a home office.\nThe home has 360-degree views and a private terrace that spans over 500 square feet and looks out to Manhattan\u2019s southern skyline.\nAmenities include a 24-hour doorman and concierge, a full-size tennis court, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and a fitness center with a boxing gym and spin studio.\nAfter launching sales in 2021, the project has sold roughly two-third of its units, according to Marketproof, and rotated through a number of sales teams, many of whom claim ownership to this latest contract, along with Douglas Elliman Development Marketing.\nThe group includes Elliman\u2019s Jessica Peters and Carl Ekroth of the Jessica Peters Team, Karen Heyman and Casey Heyman of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, and Elliman\u2019s Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes of the Eklund Gomes Team.\nDespite sponsor sales moving in fits and starts, the building still lays claim to being the\nmost expensive in Brooklyn\n, with units on average selling for $2,436 per foot, roughly $400 more than notoriously pricey developments on the Williamsburg waterfront like Williamsburg Wharf and One Domino Square.\nThe building also scored its first resale last year, when\nunit 27A sold for nearly $10 million\n, or roughly $3,300 per foot, less than two years after the seller had purchased the condo for $8 million. Former Brooklyn Net Ben Simmons listed his duplex apartment in the building last year for\nnearly $17 million\n, after purchasing the condo in 2023 for $14 million.\n",

        "content": "A Dutch trading firm is expanding its presence in Chicago\u2019s most iconic skyscraper, adding space for the second time while most office tenants in the Loop are doing the opposite.\nIMC struck a deal to add about 100,000 square feet of office space at Willis Tower, boosting its space in the 110-story, 4.5-million-square-foot skyscraper at 233 South Wacker Drive to more than 250,000 square feet, according to people familiar with the situation and first\nreported\nby CoStar. The expansion marks IMC\u2019s\nsecond significant growth spurt\nin the building in less than four years.\nThe deal builds on a 2022 lease extension in which IMC added roughly 50,000 square feet at the former Sears Tower as part of a 10-year commitment. JLL broker Matt Carolan represented the tenant in the latest transaction. Blackstone, the owner of Willis Tower, was represented by Telos Group brokers\nNikki Kearn\n, Jamey Dix, JD Parcheta and Jamai Brown.\nLarge tenant expansions have been scarce across major U.S. cities as companies reassess space needs in a hybrid work era, the outlet reported. Scoring a six-figure expansion in the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere is no small feat.\nThe deal follows Blackstone\u2019s recent agreement with lenders to extend the maturity on more than $1.3 billion in debt tied to Willis Tower as far as 2030, with extension options. The refinancing bought time for the private equity giant, which has poured hundreds of millions into upgrading the 1,451-foot-tall property since buying it in 2015.\nIn recent months, Blackstone has also\nquietly approached\na small group of investors willing to assume the building\u2019s $1.3 billion securitized mortgage, according to a Green Street\u2019s Real Estate Alert published in January. Eastdil Secured is running those conversations, sources told the outlet.\nIMC declined to comment to CoStar on why it needs more space. The Amsterdam-based market maker has steadily expanded its Chicago presence since opening a local office in 2000. The Chicago operation is now the firm\u2019s largest globally, employing more than 650 people, according to IMC\u2019s website. The company also maintains offices in London; Hong Kong; Sydney;\u00a0 Mumbai; Zug, Switzerland; and Aarhus, Denmark.\nIMC\u2019s expansion isn\u2019t the only sign of life in the Loop. Engineering firm Sargent &amp; Lundy recently added three more floors at the building at\n77 West Wacker Drive\n, pushing its total stake there past 447,000 square feet ahead of an August move from 55 East Monroe Street. Smaller expansions have also cropped up in the Loop and River North in recent months.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Recology shut down that location the following year. Amazon filed formal plans with the city to construct an industrial building in 2021.\nThe project has faced regulatory hurdles along the way that have kept shovels from hitting dirt. In 2022, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors approved what was essentially a moratorium on new parcel delivery facilities, requiring developments like Amazon\u2019s to get conditional-use authorization, or approval after additional city review, even if the site was already zoned for the proposed project. The city made the changes permanent in 2024.\nSet to rise three stories, the industrial building will include 17,700 square feet of offices, approximately 3,600 square feet of ground-floor retail and 510 parking spaces for employees as well as 13,700 square feet of public open space. The site is around the corner from the California College of the Arts campus, which Vanderbilt University\nacquired earlier this month\nas part of its San Francisco satellite plans, and is a few blocks west of the growing Mission Bay neighborhood, home to large companies like\nOpenAI\n,\nNvidia\n, Visa and Coinbase.\nWhen complete, the delivery station is expected to \u201cprovide better service and faster delivery to customers in San Francisco while reducing delivery mileage, since many packages are currently dispatched from outside the city,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson told the Business Times. The environmental review stage is a preliminary step in the project moving forward, and the company is planning to work in tandem with the city and community members to get it across the finish line.\nThe San Francisco Planning Department will convene a meeting to hear community feedback on the project on Feb. 12.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

More than 20 Palisades residents and fire survivors urged the city council to approve the aid before leaders ultimately gave it a thumbs-up.\nIn greenlighting the subsidies, the city council asked the city attorney\u2019s office to prepare an ordinance to officially establish the program and a framework to execute it. Under the subsidy program, all structures, including single-family homes, duplexes, accessory dwelling units, multifamily housing, townhomes, condos and commercial buildings, would be covered if homeowners rebuild within 110 percent size of the original property footprint and use the structures for the same purposes. Property owners would be responsible for fees in excess of the 110 percent rebuild and repair limit.\nThe city administrative officer, Matt Szabo, and his office have been instructed by the council to recommend a funding strategy to the city council and\nMayor Karen Bass\n, which would be incorporated into the budget for fiscal year 2026 and 2027.\nThe council also approved a measure introduced by Council member Monica Rodriguez that implements protections to confirm that taxpayer funds are used for rebuilding and recovery and that property owners can\u2019t take the money and run. \u201cMy amendment is simply to ensure that we\u2019re trying to ensure the people would be required to reimburse the city and taxpayers for the subsidy should the owner sell the property before the certificate of occupancy is issued,\u201d Rodriguez said, per My News L.A.\nThe City of Los Angeles, which includes Pacific Palisades, has issued nearly 1,700 rebuild permits in the more than one year since the fires ripped through the seaside neighborhood, according to the state\u2019s permitting\ntracker\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

A new 10-bedroom, 10-bathroom building in the Third Ward for instance is one of roughly 33 newly built or in-progress co-living properties backed by investors working with the Passive Investor Network, a Houston-based real estate investor network,\naccording\nto the Houston Chronicle.\nRather than carving up older houses, PIN projects are purposely built for PadSplit, an Atlanta-based firm that rents out private bedrooms in shared homes. Often described as a grown-up version of a dorm, PadSplit pitches itself as an\naffordable alternative\nfor renters priced out of traditional apartments by deposits, income requirements and bundled fees.\nThe new homes are scattered across the Third Ward and University of Houston area, Near Northside, Independence Heights and the East End. Most PadSplit listings in Houston \u2014 nearly 2,000 rooms metro-wide \u2014 are still in\nolder properties\n, the outlet reported.

Each room has its own bathroom, the outlet reported. An Art Deco speakeasy theme runs throughout, with private rooms named after cocktails and finished with brass fixtures and dark tile.\nRents for PIN Group\u2019s new-build co-living rooms run from about $1,000 to $1,200 a month, depending on the site. That\u2019s roughly in line with Houston\u2019s average rent for a Class B one-bedroom apartment and still well below\nnewer Class A units\n, which average about $1,471 per month, according to MRI Software. Newer build-to-rent single-family homes typically lease closer to $2,000, according to John Burns Research and Consulting.\nPadSplit backers argue the savings show up elsewhere. Utilities, internet, furniture and cleaning are usually included, and tenants aren\u2019t locked into yearlong leases. Move-in fees are typically about $100, sometimes waived, compared to $1,600 to $1,800 upfront for many apartments in the Third Ward area, based on the publication\u2019s analysis.\nPadSplit also skips traditional credit checks and steep income thresholds, the outlet reported, lowering barriers for renters who might otherwise be shut out, tying investment opportunity to density rather than rent growth.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Beacon took out a more than $106.4 million floating-rate loan from Morgan Stanley that same year with plans to revamp the facility for life sciences tenants. The loan comes due in March.\nBeacon renamed the property from Hollis Business Center to Ratio Innovation Campus in 2022 as part of that repositioning effort. The Boston-based firm invested more than $39 million for building and mechanical upgrades and improvements to amenities and common areas.\nWhen Beacon purchased the property, funding for the life sciences and biotech sectors was at an all-time high, and confidence in the market\u2019s future was strong. But after President Donald Trump took office last year, federal\nfunding for life sciences\nand related sectors began to disappear, causing demand for life sciences real estate to evaporate. In the fourth quarter, the R&amp;D market in Emeryville saw a 43 percent vacancy rate, per CBRE data cited by the Business Times, higher than the 28.5 percent overall life sciences vacancy rate in the East Bay corridor.\nThe Ratio Innovation Campus is currently 71 percent leased to six tenants, about half of which are life sciences companies including Totus Medicines and Arcadia Science, as well as the Rocky Mountain Cancer Center medical facility. Whole Foods Market has an office there, as does LifeStance Health.\nWhether the Ratio Innovation Campus itself hits the market \u2014 and for what price \u2014 remains to be seen. Last month, Blackstone\nlisted the 234,016-square-foot EmeryTech campus\nat 1400 65th Street in Emeryville. That property is expected to trade hands in a short sale, meaning it would sell for less than the debt tied to the site.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A boutique luxury hotel and condo tower with a nine-figure development cost is angling for zoning approval in one of Dallas\u2019 most tightly contested districts.\nHotel developer and restaurateur Robert Colombo is seeking city approval to build the Montclair Hotel and Residences, a roughly 23-story building planned for 2516 Maple Avenue in Uptown. The project would rise as high as 350 feet, requiring a height variance and other zoning adjustments,\naccording\nto city filings cited by The Dallas Morning News.\nThe proposal is scheduled to go before the City Planning &amp; Zoning Commission on Thursday, with Colombo targeting a Dallas City Council vote by the end of the month. If approved, the project would add a rare mix of\nhigh-end hospitality\nand for-sale residential units to a corridor heavy with apartments and medical offices.\nColombo told the outlet that the Montclair would include 65 hotel rooms and suites, 12 to 15 luxury condos, a spa, multiple restaurants and a small banquet facility. The development aims to compete on finishes and exclusivity rather than scale.\nThe condos would sit atop the building\u2019s upper 10 floors, with units averaging about 3,000 square feet. Buyers could also purchase full-floor units of roughly 6,000 square feet, Colombo said. Retail and restaurant space would anchor the ground floor, with the hotel stacked above.\nBranding for both the\nhotel and condos\nis still being negotiated. Colombo pegged total development costs between $200 million and $250 million.\nIf approvals fall into place, Colombo expects design work to wrap this spring. Construction could begin as early as May 2027, with a projected opening in spring 2030.\nThe project would replace the former Hotel St. Germain, a Victorian mansion built in 1897 that has been renovated multiple times over the past century. Colombo said he\u2019s working with city planners and preservation-minded groups to relocate the historic structure rather than demolish it. Estimates to move the building range from $300,000 to $500,000, he said.\nThe development is being led by Colombo\u2019s Ivy P3 Group alongside McKinney-based\nHorizon Capital Partners\n, with Dallas-based Nunzio Marc Desantis Architects serving as lead designer. The Oak Lawn Committee, an influential neighborhood group, signed off on the proposal last summer, a nonbinding but politically helpful endorsement.\nColombo, a New York native and hospitality veteran, has helped shape Dallas\u2019 dining and hotel scene since the 1980s. He previously worked on projects like\nThe Joule\nhotel downtown.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The billionaire couple, whose wealth Forbes estimates to be $10.8 billion, own privately held The Wonderful Company \u2014 which includes consumer brands such as POM Wonderful, Fiji Water and Wonderful Pistachios \u2014 and are some of the state\u2019s largest owners of land and water rights. The Resnicks, through a spokesperson for The Wonderful Company, declined to comment on Bass or their contributions.\nThe Resnicks weren\u2019t the only ones to open their pocketbooks to Bass.\nRichard Ziman, co-founder of\nRexford Industrial\n, was one of the first to respond to Bass\u2019 initial 2024 fundraiser by contributing $1,800 in July 2024. Developer Steve Soboroff was another early contributor back in July 2024, with $500. Soboroff\nsupported Bass in 2022\n, saying she \u201cis exactly who Los Angeles needs right now.\u201d That was before his relationship with city hall soured once he was tapped by Bass to be\nchief recovery officer\npost-Palisades fire in April 2025. That was followed in short order by a very public unraveling mired in accusations by Soboroff that he was sidelined from key decisions.\nFrom homebuilders, there was a $1,500 contribution in November from luxury developer\nArdie Tavangarian\n, who sold the mansion at\n1601 San Onofre Drive\nin the Pacific Palisades for $83 million in 2021 to tech billionaire Austin Russell. The Arya Group CEO declined to comment on Bass or specific policies of the mayor that he supports.\nElsewhere on the residential real estate side, six individuals from Compass donated a combined $3,550 to Bass\u2019 campaign. There were also agents from Coldwell Banker Realty, Oppenheim Group, Nourmand &amp; Associates and Keller Williams pitching in for the current mayor.\nLooking to unseat\nWhile the challengers to Bass may be many, only a handful have turned the heads of donors.\nFormer L.A. deputy mayor and Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Austin Beutner is leading that pack with $314,601 raised and 4.4 percent, or over $13,750, of it from the real estate industry, according to Ethics Commission records.\nAmong the biggest donors so far were Cushman &amp; Wakefield broker Eric Olofson ($1,800), El Segundo real estate investor Charles Lyons ($1,800), and Stevenson Ranch broker Amber Dolle-Field ($1,800).\nCivil engineer Asaad Alnajjar, who counts over 35 years working for the city, has raised the next largest pot with $109,368. About $1,900 of that, or nearly 2 percent, was drawn from real estate. The largest of those contributions was $1,800 from Ruben Gamerberg of Los Angeles-based Caltron Construction.\nThere\u2019s also Democratic Socialists of America member and Presbyterian minister\nRae Chen Huang\n, who announced in November her candidacy for mayor. She\u2019s considered a longshot but has also drawn comparisons to New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani and Seattle Mayor Katie Wilson.\nLittle funds are flowing from real estate for Huang\u2019s campaign, although that comes as no surprise. Huang called her campaign \u201cpeople powered\u201d and made clear in a January fundraising email she\u2019s not taking money from \u201ccorporate interests, developers or political insiders.\u201d\nFormer \u201cThe Hills\u201d reality TV star and Palisades resident\nSpencer Pratt\nfiled his intention to run for mayor on Tuesday with the city clerk. He officially kicks off his campaign on Wednesday.\n",

        "content": "After a fight with its landlord, the National Action Network is out of its long-time headquarters in Harlem.\nRev. Al Sharpton\u2019s civil rights organization left its office at 106-108 West 145th Street at the end of January. The move makes way for the housing development known as One45 and comes after landlord Bruce Teitelbaum threatened to evict NAN.\nTeitelbaum filed a\npetition\nto evict NAN in\nSeptember\n, claiming that after multiple lease extensions, the most recent of which expired at the end of August, the organization refused to leave 106-108 West 145th Street.\nThe one-story building is part of the site where Teitelbaum plans a 1,000-unit\napartment complex\n. At the time of the eviction filing, an attorney for the developer indicated that NAN was the only tenant holding up the project.\nA judge signed an eviction order in January, which was stayed on the condition that NAN would leave the building by Jan. 31.\nIn a statement Sharpton said NAN will move into its new headquarters in March, though didn\u2019t disclose the location. The organization will operate out of the Harlem Commonwealth Council\u2019s office in the meantime, and will host rallies to celebrate Black History Month at the Mother AME Zion Church.\nThe dispute with NAN was the latest speed bump for a project that has faced years of delays.\nThe City Council\napproved\nOne45 in July, after Teitelbaum abandoned an earlier proposal due to resistance from the local Council member. After years of fits and starts, he rebooted the project in 2024 with an updated unit count. The project is now expected to include 1,000 apartments across three buildings, of which at least 338 will be affordable.\n\u201cNow that NAN finally moved, we can proceed with our plan to build $1,000+ new homes for Harlem, which is just the start, but any more depends on the cooperation of the administration,\u201d Teitelbaum said.\nTeitelbaum has said he\u2019s willing to increase the unit counts and share of affordable apartments, but doing so would require public subsidies. He indicated Wednesday that he hasn\u2019t spoken with anyone in the Mamdani administration but \u201cis hopeful and certainly willing to work with the mayor.\u201d\nThe developer also hopes to qualify for the\nnow-expired property tax break\n421a. To do so, the project must be completed by June 15, 2031.\nPlans for One45 previously included offices for NAN and a civil rights museum founded by\nSharpton and Judge Jonathan Lippman. The museum was later pitched for\nanother project\n, but neither plan moved forward.\nAt the time, Teitelbaum\u2019s project was facing opposition from local Council member Kristin Richardson Jordan, which ultimately led to his\nwithdrawing\nhis project application in May 2022. Once a new Council member was in place and the state extended a key construction deadline for the property tax break 421a, Teitelbaum released new plans for the project and restarted the city\u2019s land use review process.\n",

But the burst of activity was short-lived, with second quarter dollar volume dropping to just $594 million and $495 million in Palm Beach and Miami, respectively.\nPresident Trump began announcing tariff policies in March, but it was his April 2 Liberation Day announcement that triggered the most significant market decline since the pandemic in 2020.\nIn the months that followed Liberation Day, stock markets showed an equally historic rebound \u2013\u2013 as of publication the S&amp;P 500 is up 14 percent, year-over-year \u2013\u2013 but market insiders say the shakeup created uncertainty for ultra-luxury buyers.\nWith markets back on more even footing, there are signs the early 2025 \u201cTrump bump\u201d momentum is returning. Palm Beach had $302 million in luxury dollar volume in the fourth quarter, up from $197 million in the third quarter of the year. Miami\u2019s dollar volume reached $769 million, up from $403 million.\nPending luxury contracts are also on the rise in both markets. Palm Beach County luxury buyers signed 37 contracts totaling\n$273.5 million\nin asking dollar volume last week. Miami-Dade\u2019s luxury buyers signed 24 contracts for\n$204.6 million\nin asking dollar volume in the same window.",

The buyer financed the 6,900-square-foot acquisition with an $8.5 million loan from City National Bank of Florida.\nThe sale price amounts to $1,685 per square foot.\nSimkins, who also leads Lion Development Group and is co-developing a pair of downtown Miami condo towers, joins other major commercial real estate investors, like\nMichael Comras\nand\nRobert Rivani\n, who have recently acquired Lincoln Road properties.\nSimkins acquired his building for nearly $23 million below the previous sale price 12 years ago.\nThe seller, an affiliate of New York-based JSRE Acquisitions, paid\n$34.5 million\n\u2014 almost $5,000 per square foot \u2014 in 2014, records show. Completed in 1936, the building has one tenant, Captain Candy Store, which opened last year, and two vacant spaces, online listings show.\nWhen JSRE acquired the building more than a decade ago,\nLincoln Road\nwas among the most expensive retail streets in South Florida, with rents ballooning from $150 a square foot to $300-plus a square foot and national tenants establishing flagship stores along the open-air mall.\nCompetition from Miami\u2019s Design District, Wynwood and Brickell neighborhoods caused a retail exodus from Lincoln Road in the late 2010s, and landlords struggled to attract new tenants that could sustain high rents.\nIn the past year, rents have become more affordable for local tenants, and Lincoln Road is going through renewed momentum that has brought in players like Comras and Rivani.\nComras\u2019 namesake firm acquired 11 Lincoln Road storefronts for\n$140 million\nin November. Comras plans to transform the properties into a 150,000-square-foot boutique shopping district called NoLi, which is short for North Lincoln Road.\nRivani purchased the historic Lincoln Theatre building on Lincoln Road for\n$37 million\nin August. In addition to anchor tenant H&amp;M, the fully leased property\u2019s other tenants are Swatch, Tapelia Spanish Cuisine restaurant and Myka, a Greek frozen yogurt shop.",

The G.H. Palmer Associates founder, known for his Italian-style properties, has\nbeen a big backer\nof President Donald Trump. He donated millions to his campaigns and hosted fundraisers for him in L.A.\nPalmer wasn\u2019t Hilton\u2019s only Southern California real estate donor either last year. Frank Suryan Jr., chairman and chief executive of Lyon Living, donated $39,200 in December and Steven Craig of Craig Realty Group gave the same amount in May. The two commercial real estate companies are Newport Beach-based. Hilton\u2019s old boss, Rupert Murdoch, whose family media empire includes Fox News, gave $39,200.\nRepresentatives for Palmer, Suryan and Craig did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nHilton, a Republican candidate for governor of very-blue California, raked in more campaign cash than almost any other hopeful in the second half of last year, according to a review of documents recently filed with the secretary of state\u2019s office. Hilton raised $4.2 million between July and December last year \u2014 and a total of $5.7 million the entire year.\nLiberal billionaire Tom Steyer outpaced Hilton, but the bulk of his $28.9 million haul was self-funded \u2014 and though Hilton raised more than her in the latter half of the year, for all of 2025, he raised slightly less than Katie Porter, who served as a U.S. representative from California from 2019 to 2025. She pulled in $6.1 million. After Porter, Hilton still collected more than any other hopeful all year besides Steyer.\nFormer Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa received donations from Newmark broker Jay Luchs, and Related California\u2019s Bill Witte,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously\nreported\n. Villaraigosa\u2019s total contributions amounted to $3.2 million last year.\nAnother Republican candidate, Riverside County sheriff Chad Bianco received $3.7 million in total contributions. Alexander Haagen III, chairman and chief executive of Haagen Company, is one of his supporters, donating $39,200.\nDemocratic candidate and former secretary of health and human services Xavier Becerra pulled in $5.2 million. Another Democratic candidate, Rep. Eric Swalwell, received $3.1 million in contributions.\nThe other four candidates, Democratic and Republican, didn\u2019t reach the million-dollar mark.\nNewly announced candidate San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan did not have to disclose campaign funds, but he earned an\nendorsement\nfrom billionaire developer Rick Caruso, who said he\nwouldn\u2019t run\nfor either Los Angeles mayor or California governor after months of chatter.\n",

        "content": "A $30 million renovation now getting underway at the tower at 200 South Wacker Drive will test whether aggressive reinvestment \u2014 not just bargain buying \u2014 can still unlock value from the general office distress in Downtown Chicago.\nChicago-based Glenstar and Minnesota investor Patrick Halloran this week rolled out plans for a sweeping overhaul of the 41-story, 761,775-square-foot tower overlooking the South Branch of the Chicago River,\naccording\nto Crain\u2019s. Work is slated to begin this month, roughly a year after the partners bought the building for about\n$68 million\nin an all-cash deal.\nThe project comes as downtown office vacancy hovers near record highs and a wave of troubled buildings trade at steep discounts, the outlet reported. Many new owners have stayed on the sidelines, wary of pouring capital into older towers amid uncertain demand, high construction costs and lingering questions about whether tenants will pay up.\nAt the tower at 200 South Wacker Drive,\nGlenstar\nand Halloran are betting they will. The building is currently 57 percent leased, a figure that includes a pending departure by law firm Goldman Ismail Tomaselli Brennan &amp; Baum, and trails the downtown average of roughly 72 percent. Glenstar managing principal Michael Klein told the outlet that the goal is not just to\nout-lease competitors\n, but to do so at higher rents.\nRenderings reveal an amenity blitz, with the owners planning to gut and remake the lobby, two mezzanine levels and the lower floors with luxury finishes, a river-facing health club, golf simulators, a parlor gaming area and an outdoor lounge with fire pits that will cantilever over the riverwalk. New pavers aim to enhance the Adams Street entrance, and a 180-seat conference center on the 34th floor will be fully reworked.\nGlenstar pegs the core amenity package at about $25 million, with several million more earmarked for restroom and corridor upgrades, back-of-house improvements and roughly 52,000 square feet of spec suites designed for tenants seeking\nmove-in-ready space\n. Construction is expected to wrap by the end of the year.\nThe math works in Glenstar and Halloran\u2019s favor, according to the publication, as they paid about $89 per square foot for the building, a fraction of the $282 per square foot the building fetched in 2013.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The 83,000 square feet of unleashed space includes floor plates ranging from about 9,200 to 27,000 square feet.\nThe building has seven years of average lease term and assumable fixed-rate debt at 2.83 percent through December 2030.\nA Newmark team led by Adam Spies, Joshua King and Marcella Fasulo is overseeing the sales process.\nESRT has been moving to rebalance its portfolio away from office buildings into areas like multifamily and retail.

        "content": "Sen. Brian Kavanagh will not seek reelection, leaving his seat and his role as housing chair up for grabs.\nKavanagh, who announced this week that he will leave office after his term ends this year, has been chair of the Senate Committee on Housing, Construction and Community Development since January 2019, which proved to be a pivotal year for the real estate industry. Buoyed by the Senate\u2019s newly-gained majority that year, the legislature approved the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019. The legislature also passed good cause eviction, created a state-based housing voucher program and approved a replacement to 421a during his tenure.\nIn a statement, he pointed to his pitch to voters in his first-ever campaign, during which he said it was time to elect \u201ca new generation of leadership.\u201d He said now it\u2019s his turn to make room.\n\u201cI believe that all of us in elected office owe it to our constituents to recognize when we have reached a point when we have given it our all and they would be well served by electing someone new,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, that point is now.\u201d\nThe industry will be watching for who takes over the committee chair role and whether that person is further to the left than Kavanagh. Personally, and speaking solely from the perspective of an anxious reporter, I will be watching to see if his successor can also get really into the weeds on housing policy and field questions about specific bill language as Kavanagh has done.\nPossible replacements are already lining up for his Manhattan seat. Assembly member Grace Lee posted on social media that she is considering a run, and former Assembly member Yuh-Line Niou announced she plans to run, citing the need for \u201cbold, aggressive, truly progressive leadership.\u201d Lee waged an unsuccessful campaign to unseat Niou in 2020, but won the seat two years later when Niou left the Assembly. In these previous races, the real estate industry preferred Lee. But we\u2019ll see who else throws their hat in the ring.\nIn other legislative news: Diana Moreno on Tuesday night won a special election to fill Mayor Zohran Mamdani\u2019s seat in the Assembly. Moreno had the backing of the mayor and the Democratic Socialists of America. The win brings the number of state\n\u201cSocialists in Office\u201d\n(a term used by the DSA to describe electeds who were endorsed by the organization) back up to nine.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Who do you think will take over as the housing chair in the state Senate? Who would you like to see in that role? What are your thoughts on Kavanagh\u2019s tenure? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nDina Levy, commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, says she is open to talking about adjustments to 485x. \u201cI want to have some real conversations to find out [if] we need to make some accommodations in light of the prevailing wage and the deeper affordability restrictions,\u201d she\ntold me\nlast week.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nGov. Kathy Hochul on Wednesday\nannounced\nthat former City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams will be her running mate as she runs for reelection. Adams would serve as her lieutenant governor, replacing Antonio Delgado, who is challenging Hochul in the primary.\n\u2014\nMayor Zohran Mamdani plans to endorse Hochul\u2019s reelection bid this week\n,\nPolitico New York reports\n. That\u2019s a major blow to Delgado as he tries to shore up support from the far left.\n\u2014\nDuring a breakfast held by the Association for a Better New York, Council Speaker Julie Menin said the Council is studying city-owned sites, community rezonings and public libraries for potential housing opportunities. \u201cInstead of responding to private land use applications, or ULURPs, instead of hoping that they net us an amount of housing that addresses the current shortage, we are going to survey neighborhoods ourselves across the five boroughs,\u201d she told the crowd.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$10.8 million\nfor a 4,357-square-foot co-op unit at 995 Fifth Avenue on the Upper East Side. Leslie R. Coleman and Christina Lee with Brown Harris Stevens\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$13 million\nfor a 30,200-square-foot industrial building at 54-60 48th Street in Flushing.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$15 million\nfor a 6,338-square-foot condominium at 455 Central Park West on the Upper West Side. Corey Mittenthal and Brian K. Meier at Brown Harris Stevens have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 139,746-square-foot, seven-story, 88-unit mixed-use project at 50-02 Skillman Avenue in Sunnyside. Thomas Lang filed the permit on behalf of Amin Siad.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "A property manager for condo associations was hit with criminal charges, accused of misappropriating about $600,000 from a Pembroke Pines complex.\nIt was the third arrest on a theft charge against Michael Curtis, who also faces allegations in two cases filed last year of allegedly siphoning funds from two other Broward County condo associations.\nCurtis, 38, has pleaded not guilty on the charges in all three cases, and his attorney denied any wrongdoing.\nCurtis\u2019 case comes as many South Florida residential communities governed by condo and homeowner associations for decades have struggled with their leadership. Residents have claimed wrongdoing, from fund misappropriation and lack of maintenance and transparency to high assessments,\nelection fraud\nand bullying of those who speak out, against\nboard members\n.\nBut some associations also have raised issues with their\nproperty managers\n, which are hired by boards and paid by the association.\nThe latest allegations accuse Curtis of forging the signatures of two former board members at the Windmill Lakes condo complex in Pembroke Pines to sign checks from the association accounts to his own companies BDM Property Management, Private Parking Managers and All Florida Rental Management, according to a probable cause affidavit.\nCurtis, hired to manage Windmill Lakes, at 350 Southwest 88th Street, in 2017, allegedly signed over 350 checks to his companies, totaling about $1 million. Investigators determined his financial gain at about $600,000, the affidavit says.\nThe two former board members told investigators they neither knew nor consented to the use of their signatures on the checks, as well as on insurance settlement documents. The settlements from the insurer also yielded checks to BDM Property Management, even though the firm separately billed the association, according to the affidavit.\nThe affidavit consists of a 2023 Pembroke Pines police report. The Broward County State Attorney charged Curtis last month with grand theft and use of another person\u2019s ID without their consent.\nCurtis self-surrendered on Jan. 17, and posted a $22,500 bond, court records show.\nCurtis previously was charged with grand theft in two separate state cases.\nThe Broward State Attorney\u2019s office charged Curtis last year with theft in connection to his tenure as property manager at the Fairways of Sunrise homeowners association, at Northwest 80th Avenue and Northwest 28th Street in Sunrise, and at Colonies II condo association, between Middle River and Northwest 26th Street in Lauderdale Lakes.\nIn the Fairways case, prosecutors said Curtis in 2020 signed off on an $885,000 insurance settlement for the association for damage from Hurricane Irma in 2017, which would give the association $444,750 after payments to attorneys in the insurance claim and other fees.\nBut as $551,620, which included insurance settlement funds, was deposited to the association account, $439,000 was transferred from the association to BDM, according to the affidavit. Yet, in the years after the insurance settlement, Curtis told homeowners that the insurance litigation was \u201cthrown out,\u201d according to the affidavit.\nFairways sued its former board members and BDM in 2022, accusing BDM of failing to account for a substantial amount of Hurricane Irma insurance disbursements.\nBDM won that case. A jury in October found the property management firm didn\u2019t negligently breach its fiduciary duties to the association in connection to Hurricane Irma insurance proceeds and other funds.\nThe latest charges came after a Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation investigation into alleged misappropriation of funds from Colonies II, again following hurricane insurance proceeds disbursements, according to the probable cause affidavit.\nCurtis couldn\u2019t be reached for comment, and his attorney, Elias Hilal, didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment.\nIn a statement to the Miami Herald, Hilal said Curtis\u2019 most recent arrest is tied to \u201cpersonal vendettas.\u201d\nIn other recent allegations involving condo associations, the Miami-Dade State Attorney\u2019s Office charged Yissely Herrouet, a former manager at The Club at Brickell Bay condo tower in Miami, over allegations she hired\n\u201cphantom employees\u201d\nto work at the building, who in reality were her family members and acquaintances, according to the arrest warrant. She is accused of diverting $142,000 from the association.\nUnit owners at the Palm Bay Yacht Club Condominium won a\n$5.8 million\njury verdict in December against South Florida Condominium Management and a $550,000 jury verdict against D&amp;R Contracting in connection to a hefty 40-year recertification assessment for the building. In that case, considered one of the largest in South Florida concerning condo management, unit owners in part alleged some of the work was falsely presented as \u201cemergency,\u201d allowing for the circumvention of approval by unit owners.\n",

        "content": "The $10 million sale of a\nMar Vista\nhome has set new records for the Westside neighborhood.\nThe five-bedroom, six-and-a-half-bathroom home at 11948 Modjeska Place bests the community\u2019s previous priciest-ever residential deal set in September 2024, when 3400 Greenwood Avenue sold for $7.1 million. Modjeska Place, which traded off market for roughly $1,639 per square foot, is also\nMar Vista\n\u2019s first residential deal ever to hit eight figures.\nCompass\u2019 Paul Salazar was the listing agent, while the brokerage\u2019s Tracey Becker brought the buyer.\nProperty records show a trust tied to Robert Green was the seller, who had tapped architecture firm Woods + Dangaran to design the custom build that was completed about five years ago to serve as the family home.\nNow, a Venice family that was looking for more room will enjoy the residence\u2019s more than 6,100 square feet looking out onto the San Gabriel Mountains and Downtown Los Angeles.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rare property,\u201d Salazar said of the home and the price it commanded. \u201cThis just shows that there are a lot of buyers in this price range looking in Mar Vista.\u201d\nIn the neighborhood\u2019s hill section, located east of Centinela Avenue, lot sizes of 10,000 square feet or more are common and about double Mar Vista\u2019s average lot size of around 5,000 to 6,000 square feet, Salazar pointed out. The Modjeska Place home sits on about a 16,000-square-foot lot.\nSalazar said his client had several buyers view the property and sales in the $4 million to $7 million range are not uncommon for the neighborhood, pointing out \u201cit\u2019s just a matter of time\u201d before Mar Vista sees more $10 million sales.\nBecker, who was one of the listing agents on last June\u2019s sale of 1215 Appleton Way in nearby Venice, said buyers looking for more room and who want to remain on the Westside are helping drive demand in Mar Vista and the general area. The Appleton Way property sold for $9.5 million, or $1,109 per square foot, to become Venice\u2019s priciest residential deal.\nThe hunt by families seeking more room has been further padded with increased demand from Palisades fire-impacted property owners who remain looking for either temporary or permanent housing.\n\u201cWe had the big surge of people looking for homes post-fire and now we\u2019re seeing that there are a lot of families who have finally settled with insurance and are finally figuring out what they\u2019re able to do,\u201d Becker said. \u201cThey\u2019ve had a moment to sit with it and decide if they want to rebuild and settle in the Palisades. It\u2019s an ever-evolving process because there are different tranches of people in different phases of their recovery.\u201d\nThe\nMeasure United to House L.A. tax\nwithin the city of Los Angeles, of which Mar Vista is a part of, hasn\u2019t stopped dealmaking.\nThe so-called\nmansion tax\n, which assesses a 4 percent levy on real estate deals starting at $5.3 million and then jumps to 5.5 percent beginning with sales of $10.6 million, applied to the Modjeska Place trade.\nThe seller on Modjeska Place was already aware of the\ntax\n, which triggered the 4 percent tier, and amounted to about $400,000.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a conversation with the sellers,\u201d Salazar said of Measure ULA. \u201cThey\u2019re not happy about it and they\u2019re always asking is there a way to get around it.\u201d\nIn short, the answer is no.\nFor a furnished home, a seller might break out the sale of the pieces into a separate transaction. In other cases, buyers and sellers may agree to split the price of ULA, although regardless of whether that conversation happens, the\ntax\nis still factored into pricing.\n",

Business First reported, citing new\ndata\nfrom StorageCafe. In the past decade, the city has seen 1.4 million square feet of real estate repurposed into self-storage space.\nThe city ranks eighth in the country when it comes to the most self-storage space converted from other uses;\nChicago\ntops the chart with nearly 4.4 million square feet over the past decade. Los Angeles is expected to add more than 226,000 square feet of new self-storage space through adaptive reuse, making up 60 percent of the current under-construction storage space in the city. That puts L.A. in second place when it comes to under-construction storage conversions behind Irving, Texas.\nA majority of the converted space is in buildings that were once offices. Those office-to-storage projects make up 57 percent of the total conversion inventory in the city with more than 806,000 square feet. Industrial properties are the second-most popular conversion type with more than 529,000 square feet being turned into self-storage.\nDespite being one of the country\u2019s top markets for self-storage conversions, Los Angeles is still considered undersupplied, according to StorageCafe. Los Angeles and New York City each have 2.1 square feet of storage space per person \u2014 the lowest ratio among the top 10 markets. Philadelphia and St. Paul, Minnesota, have 3.3 square feet per person, and Chicago boasts 3.5 square feet per person.\nAll of Los Angeles\u2019 self-storage conversion projects are located in federally designated\nOpportunity Zone\nareas, signifying the focus on revitalizing underutilized neighborhoods.\n\u201cLos Angeles stands out as a prime example of an undersupplied urban market where self-storage conversions offer a practical, community-oriented solution\u2026 by repurposing underperforming commercial buildings,\u201d StorageCafe said in a statement, per L.A.

        "content": "More Chicago suburbs are tightening regulations on short-term rentals.\nSkokie officials passed an ordinance Monday setting up a pilot program to ban new investor-owned short-term rentals in the village. And the Evanston City Council is considering passing tighter regulations to cap the number of short-term rentals in the city.\nThe changes add to a\ngrowing list\nof\nlocal governments\naiming to clamp down on the number of vacation rentals offered through apps like Airbnb and Vrbo. Neighbors have complained that dedicated vacation rentals create noise, disruptions and drive up costs in an already strained housing market.\nSkokie\u2019s\nordinance, passed Monday in a 5 to 1 vote by the Board of Trustees, sets up an 18-month test period that will limit new short-term rentals and place fees and regulations on existing ones.\nThe rules prohibit new short-term rentals for investor-owned homes, while allowing existing investors to register to maintain their rentals. New licenses at owner-occupied short-term rentals will be allowed, but the ordinance caps the number of licenses to one per block. The rules also set a minimum of five consecutive nights per stay and limit hosts to only 18 total bookings over the 18-month test period.\nThe rules require owners of existing short-term rentals to register by April 1 in order to keep their license, and the regulations take effect May 1. The rules set a $1,200 license fee for new and existing short-term rentals, and require operators to pay a registration fee of $2,400 for owner-occupied units and $3,600 for non-owner-occupied units. Operators who violate the rules could be fined up to $1,500.\nCommunity Development Director Johanna Nyden said during Monday\u2019s meeting the ordinance would give the village more power to address violations. Nyden said Skokie has 75 to 90 active short-term rental units.\n\u201cWe have no teeth right now,\u201d she said. \u201cThe real problem is we don\u2019t have these enforcement tools to address. We can only suggest right now.\u201d\nVillage Trustee Gail Schechter voted against the ordinance, arguing the limits were arbitrary. Schecter told\nThe Real Deal\nshe would have liked to collect more data on who owns rental properties and the existing demand before limiting them.\n\u201cWe\u2019re ostensibly doing the pilot to collect the data, but I feel like we should have used data to decide how we\u2019re regulating this,\u201d she said.\nIn\nEvanston\n, where a moratorium is currently in effect on new short-term rentals, city officials are proposing overhauling the rules to set a hard cap on the number of short-term rentals in the city and incentivize units owned by the occupant or by city residents, rather than by outside investors.\nThe City Council will consider the proposal at its meeting on Monday, after it was discussed and amended at the Jan. 12 meeting.\nThe proposal would limit the number of short-term rental licenses in the city to 1 per 100 rental units and change the definition of a short-term rental to a rental lasting less than one year, up from less than 30 days. It would also require that new offerings be at least 600 feet from other short-term rentals. Currently, 135 active short-term rentals are in the city, city staff said in January.\nCity officials also proposed a rule requiring the property manager of short-term rentals to live within three miles of Evanston, in an effort to ensure rentals are being operated by Evanston residents. Council members considered creating a hard requirement that short-term rental operators be city residents, but the city\u2019s attorney said during the January meeting that it may open the city up to lawsuits.\nBobby Burns, the 5th Ward council member and a member of the Housing and Community Development Committee, told\nThe Real Deal\nthat Evanston\u2019s\nrising housing costs\nare pricing out residents, and he\u2019s opposed to outside investors using the limited housing supply for vacation rentals.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable with people that are only using it to make a profit, who don\u2019t live in Evanston, who don\u2019t necessarily have a strong commitment to Evanston,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause of how limited we are in terms of land and units that could be used for affordable housing.\u201d\nIn Glen Ellyn, a full ban on short-term rentals is facing a legal challenge from an Airbnb operator in the village. A federal judge in December blocked the city from enforcing the ban against Blakelick Properties, the company suing the village, while allowing the ban to be enforced against other short-term rentals while the lawsuit plays out. The ban took effect in January for other properties, after it was initially paused by the judge and then delayed by the village board.\n",

The property hit the market in February 2025 as part of a three-home portfolio\nPortillo\nand his partners were pitching for a combined $57.4 million.\nThe Dolphin Court sale leaves two properties still on the market, both now repriced. A 16,800-square-foot\npenthouse\nat the Seasons tower on Seagate Drive is asking just under $25 million, down from $32.5 million a year ago. A 5,000-square-foot house on Second Avenue has been trimmed to about $11 million from an initial $12.5 million asking price.\nPortillo\u2019s name was featured prominently in the original listings, but it was removed by the time the Dolphin Court home sold. Still, he remains involved, Chris Covelli told the outlet. He is a principal at C&amp;E Construction, which partnered with Portillo and Theory Design\u2019s Ruta Menaghlazi on the developments.\nCovelli said the team is pleased with the sale, but has no additional projects planned together for now. Portillo and listing agent Dawn McKenna of Coldwell Banker Realty declined to comment.\nRecords show a Covelli-led entity bought the roughly 0.4-acre Dolphin Court site for $5.6 million in late 2022, razed the existing house and built the contemporary waterfront home. The\nproperty features\na glass-edged pool overlooking the bay and high-end finishes, including matte wood floors, black-framed doors and stone countertops.\nThe buyers were represented by Re/Max Alliance Group\u2019s Pat Wilkins, who declined to identify them.\nPortillo sold his namesake hot dog chain in 2014 in a deal reportedly nearing $1 billion. Since then, he has focused on real estate, including retail landlord plays and high-end residential projects.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Goldman Sachs provided the floating-rate, interest-only bridge loan. Walker &amp; Dunlop\u2019s Walker Layne, Stephen West, Matthew Wallach, Austin Sneed and Tyler Evenson arranged the deal.\nThe Henley offers one- and two-bedroom units as well as a two-story gym, pool and dog park.

The development would also include a 15-acre Pilot Point ISD elementary school site, 27 acres of mixed-use space and more than 100 acres of open space, plus trails, parks and amenity centers.\nHillwood\nestimates Lantern could be worth $1.2 billion at buildout.\nUnder the TIRZ agreement, 50 percent of ad valorem taxes generated by the property would be reinvested for 25 years to help fund roads, water, sewer and drainage. The outlet reported that Hillwood executives acknowledged the project\u2019s strain on\ncounty services\n, but argued the incentive is critical to feasibility, particularly before annexation into Pilot Point, which approved a development agreement last fall.\nFarther east,\nOld Prosper Partners\nlocked up an even bigger assemblage. The firm closed Jan. 30 on the 2,870-acre\nCraver Ranch near Denton\n, setting the stage for what city officials have pegged as a $5.1 billion, 17-year buildout.\nPlans call for 7,091 homes, 584 townhomes and 1,515 apartments, along with 1.2 million square feet of commercial space and three schools. A defining feature is its built-in open space, which includes about 380 acres of parks, including a 358-acre central park and more than 30 miles of trails and shared paths. Construction is expected to begin in 2028 and stretch into the mid-2040s.\nDenton has already annexed the land and approved rezoning, along with the creation of a municipal management district that allows infrastructure costs to be financed through future assessments and bond reimbursements.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Elected officials should honor the wishes of tenants who vote for them, right? Not necessarily.\nIn upstate New York, the newly Democratic-controlled City Council just announced it will implement\ngood cause eviction\n.\n\u201cClearly, this is something that the voters wanted,\u201d Council President Sue Steele told the\nTimes Union\n. \u201cThey made it very clear in the outcome of the last election.\u201d\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned from years of covering politics is that no one knows exactly why people vote the way they do. The reasons vary tremendously from one voter to the next. Rarely do they come down to one issue \u2014 or even issues in general.\nThe idea that Troy Democrats won November\u2019s election because they favored good cause eviction is nonsense. Democrats last year (and\nlast week in Texas\n) won races across the country in places that have never heard of good cause eviction.\nThe tailwinds that Democratic candidates now enjoy \u2014 especially a base energized by the Trump presidency \u2014 certainly were a factor in those results.\nBut, for the sake of argument, let\u2019s assume Troy voters did elect Democrats for the express purpose of passing good cause eviction. Should they automatically enact the policy? This is a democracy, after all.\nActually, the United States is a republic. It\u2019s a representative democracy, not a direct democracy. The leaders we elect are supposed to make decisions based on what\u2019s best for society. \u201cThis is what voters want\u201d is not a reason to do something.\nGood cause eviction must be considered on its merits. Like any policy, it has benefits and drawbacks, as I detailed in\na 2022 column\n. Two years later, NYU\u2019s Furman Center spelled out the\nunintended consequences\nlikely to result from a drastic version of good cause proposed for New York.\nThat bill, after furious lobbying by the real estate industry and a two-year statewide campaign executed on landlords\u2019 behalf by\nGeorge Fontas\n, was\nwatered down\nby Gov. Kathy Hochul and passed in April 2024. It established good cause for most multifamily buildings in New York City and gave localities outside the city the option of implementing it. That\u2019s what Troy is pondering now.\nAlbany was the first city to adopt good cause and was followed by Kingston, Poughkeepsie, Ithaca, Beacon, Hudson, Rochester, Newburgh and Binghamton, the town of Fishkill and the villages of Nyack, Catskill, Croton-on-Hudson and New Paltz. If Troy\u2019s bill passes, the Republican mayor is likely to veto it, but she could be overridden.\nUnder good cause, if a tenant is not behind on rent, the landlord must offer a lease renewal \u2014 and if raising the rent more than 5 percent plus the rate of inflation (or more than 10 percent), he can be forced to justify the increase in court. The current threshold is 8.79 percent. Luxury rentals are\nexempt\n.\nHochul pushed the percentages up enough to avoid strangling rents the way her predecessor Andrew Cuomo did by signing the rent stabilization overhaul of 2019.\nBut landlords still hate the idea that they can be compelled to renew a tenant\u2019s lease. That leaves eviction \u2014 a long, expensive and uncertain process \u2014 as the only way to get rid of a disruptive tenant. That can be bad news for the good tenants of a building, too. And it makes it hard to empty a building to fully renovate it.\nRegulations like good cause also deter developers from building rentals, resulting in\nhousing scarcity\nand higher rents.\nThe debate in Troy seems focused on whether tenants need the protection of good cause to be able to report possible housing violations to code enforcement without fear of retaliation. But as noted, that\u2019s just one of many factors to consider.\nOne factor not to consider is the results of November\u2019s election, where much larger forces were at play. Donald Trump has been busy on many fronts, but good cause eviction is not one of them.\n",

        "content": "Texas homebuyers are scoring discounts in droves.\nThree of every four homes in\nthe major cities of Texas\nsold for well under asking price last year, making Texas one of the most buyer-favorable states in the country, according to\nRedfin\n. Nationwide, only Florida exceeds Texas in residential discounts, with West Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale and Miami pushing Austin to fourth place among the country\u2019s biggest metro areas.\nOver 82 percent of homes sold below their original listing price in Austin, the most discounted metro in the state. The share of discounted sales was 79.4 percent in Dallas, 78 percent in Houston and 74 percent in Fort Worth. Altogether, nearly 80 percent of homes sold in the Texas Triangle last year traded at a discount, Redfin shows. Florida tops out with 87.9 percent of homes selling below list price in West Palm Beach and 81.9 percent among all six of the state\u2019s major metros.\nThe data suggests that sellers are still coming to terms with\nthe end of the pandemic-era boom\nthat gave them the advantage during the early 2020s. With\nhousing inventory pushing levels not seen since 2011 across the Texas Triangle\n, the question is whether Texas cities are simply returning to pre-pandemic norms or beginning a substantial decline.\n\u201cI do have a sense that we\u2019re still seeing the unfair comparison, if you will, to Austin at the peak. And it can skew the perception of how well Austin is doing,\u201d said Vaike O\u2019Grady, market research adviser for Unlock MLS.\nAustin-area homes have suffered the greatest drop in value among the top metros in the country since their respective market peaks, according to\nZillow\n. For Austin, that peak was 2022, when the city was enjoying a tech industry renaissance and concomitant migration from California.\nThe post-pandemic decline may already be over, though. Median sale prices and sales activity within the city of Austin itself remained generally stable last year, compared to the year before. Inside city limits, total sales and median prices\nheld flat between 2024 and 2025\n.\nEven so, outlying areas have declined, O\u2019Grady allowed.\n\u201cWilliamson County did see a significant shift in terms of its median sale price [last year], and that\u2019s probably because there\u2019s so much relatively new inventory. It was such a focus of growth for so many years,\u201d O\u2019Grady said.\nAustin doesn\u2019t only have one of the nation\u2019s highest shares of discounted sales; it also saw some of the nation\u2019s steepest discounts. The average price cut for homes that sold below original list price was 9 percent in Austin last year, putting it in 10th place among the country\u2019s top metros, Redfin reports.\nHomebuilding also contributed to oversupply in the exurbs around the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, according to Thaddius Watson, vice president of the Greater Fort Worth Association of Realtors.\n\u201c\nAledo\nis a prime example,\u201d Watson said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of development\nwest\n. Aledo, Weatherford and even further out.\nSouth of the Metroplex\nis the same way.\u201d\nSimilar to Austin, median sale prices dipped only slightly in the Metroplex \u2014 with\nMetroTex\nreporting a single-family sale price decline of 1 percent in 2025, year-over-year \u2014 but fell steeply in outlying areas like Denton County, which saw a\n4.3 percent decline\n.\n\u201cThis narrative that the Austin market is in trouble is just false. I think it\u2019s just in comparison to where we were,\u201d O\u2019Grady said.\n",

Funds managed by New York-based Blue Owl Capital provided the floating-rate refinancing, according to an L&amp;L Holding news release.\nA Walker &amp; Dunlop team that included Dustin Stolly and Aaron Appel, andL&amp;L Holding\u2019s Yong Cho and Susan Raffo arranged the financing.\nThe debt pays off the\n$215 million\nconstruction loan the developers secured in 2023 from Little Rock, Arkansas-based Bank OZK, according to records. It also funds the balance of the office and apartment leasing costs, the release says.\nOak Row, based in Miami and New York, is led by Erik Rutter and David Weitz. The pair have several Miami-Dade County projects on tap, most recently making a splash with the record\n$520 million\npurchase of a waterfront Brickell development site that can be developed with multiple supertalls totaling over 3 million square feet. OKO Group, led by Vlad Doronin, is a partner on the purchase and planned redevelopment.\nNew York-based L&amp;L is led by David Levinson and Robert Lapidus, and San Francisco-based Shorenstein is led by Brandon Shorenstein. Claure Group is former Sprint and SoftBank Group International CEO Marcelo Claure\u2019s investment firm.\nWynwood Plaza\u2019s office building has commitments for 60 percent of the space, according to L&amp;L Holding\u2019s spokesperson. Jeff Bezos\u2019\nAmazon\nleased about 75,500 square feet, and Claure Group leased space for its headquarters. Also,\nOKO Group\nand law firm Weitz &amp; Luxenberg \u2013\u2013 co-led by Perry Weitz, David Weitz\u2019s father and an Oak Row investor \u2013\u2013 have leased offices at Wynwood Plaza.\nThe retail and dining tenants at Wynwood Plaza will include Italian-style steakhouse Luca Steak by Miami chef Giorgio Rapicavoli, according to L&amp;L\u2019s release.\nNearly half of the apartments are leased, according to L&amp;L Holding\u2019s spokesperson.\nElsewhere in Miami, Oak Row is developing a\n399-unit\napartment tower and a\n324-unit\napartment tower, both in Edgewater. It also plans rental projects in\ndowntown Miami\n, across from the Brightline passenger train station, and in North Miami Beach.\nIn other recent refinancings, Terra and New Valley scored\n$129.7 million\nfor the 460-unit Natura Gardens multifamily complex in northwest Miami-Dade County, and Resident Group landed\n$113.8 million\nfor its 279-unit Metro Edgewater rental tower in Miami\u2019s Edgewater. Both deals closed in October.\n",

        "content": "Even as David Werner is on a dealmaking streak in the distressed office market, he and partner Joseph Mizrachi have dragged fellow investors Rubin Schron and David Lowenfeld into a $167 million alleged loan default in Chicago.\nSchron\u2019s New York-based firm\nCammeby\u2019s International\nand David Lowenfeld\u2019s New York-based World Wide Group allegedly defaulted on a commercial mortgage-backed securities debt tied to the ground beneath the building at\n300 South Riverside Plaza\n, according to loan servicer reports. The alleged default marks a dramatic escalation of distress at the 1.1 million-square-foot West Loop office tower, where a complex ownership structure has finally buckled.\nThe alleged ground default was triggered by the building\u2019s leasehold owners, New York-based Werner\u2019s eponymous firm and Boca Raton, Florida-based Mizrachi\u2019s Third Millennium Group. While they\u2019ve been in alleged default on their own $175 million building loan from South Korea-based Shinhan Investment Corp. since 2023, they had still been making ground lease payments to Schron and Lowenfeld. But those stopped late last year, too, as the October installment was the first payment missed, loan servicer reports show.\nBy allegedly withholding rent, the building\u2019s owners effectively pulled their ground landlords into the abyss. Schron and Lowenfeld\u2019s $167 million ground debt \u2014 originated by Morgan Stanely and split across the MSBAM 2015-C22 and MSC 2015-MS1 loan pools \u2014 was transferred to special servicer LNR Partners, a subsidiary of Starwood Property Trust, in November for \u201cimminent default,\u201d loan data shows.\nThe hammer has already dropped. Arne Shulkin\u2019s team at LNR sent a formal notice of default on Nov. 21 and officially accelerated the loan to be fully due ahead of maturity on Dec. 11, notes from the special servicer said. A local lawyer has been retained to explore foreclosure litigation and the appointment of a receiver. While LNR is \u201cdual-tracking\u201d the process by discussing workout alternatives, the move toward litigation suggests the era of extend and pretend has reached its limit.\nSo far, the path forward for the leasehold default is unclear. Shinhan didn\u2019t return a request for comment on whether it would resume ground lease payments if it seized the building from Werner and Mizrachi.\nRepresentatives of the firms led by Werner, Mizrachi, Schron and Lowenfeld also didn\u2019t return requests for comment, nor did LNR Partners.\nThis collapse highlights the inherent volatility of the bifurcated ownership model, which splits the land from the building to boost returns \u2014 a strategy long championed by players like\nJay Shidler\n, whose similar gambits have sunk multiple deals in Chicago, including at the Loop\u2019s\nBurnham Center\n.\nWhile these deals may offer upfront benefits, they often become unsellable in high interest rate environments. The strategy has also fueled recent carnage for\nShaya Prager of Opal Holdings\n. Lender GreenState Credit Union recently completed a foreclosure on Prager\u2019s suburban Chicago office campus, after his firm\u2019s default on the $104 million Deerfield property encumbered by a similar ground lease structure.\nAt the 23-story tower on 300 South Riverside, the property\u2019s fundamentals have been shredded by tenant departures. Zurich North America recently\nditched the property for the Willis Tower\n, and\nCars.com slashed its footprint\n. Now, with the ground and the building in simultaneous alleged loan defaults, the very foundation of the deal is being wiped out.\nStill, the setback at the property hasn\u2019t stopped Werner from making other plays. He and partner 601W Cos. just this week purchased the building at\n175 West Jackson Boulevard\nout of distress for $41 million. That is about 87 percent less than the $306 million prior owner Brookfield Properties spent to buy it in 2017.\nWerner also teamed up with 601W last year to buy the building at\n303 East Wacker Drive\nat a big discount from its previous purchase price.\nHe\u2019s going even bigger in New York. To close 2025, Werner struck a\n$270 million deal to buy One Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld Plaza\nat 885 2nd Avenue in Midtown East, about half off its previous purchase price in 2019. And earlier in 2025,\nWerner and partner MetroLoft scored a $700 million loan\nfrom Madison Realty Capital for the office-to-residential conversion project at 235 East 42nd Street.\nWerner and 601W in November also closed a\n$165 million purchase\nof the 532,000-square-foot office building at 205 East 42nd Street in New York.\nAt the same time, Mizrachi\u2019s firm is also trying to make moves. Third Millennium last year\nrevived its effort, in partnership with Hines\n, to find an anchor tenant for an office development it wants to build in Chicago\u2019s West Loop, next to the 31-story building they constructed together at 540 West Madison Street a decade ago. The new plan would be a 28-story tower consisting of over 600,000 square feet of office space at 590 West Madison.\n",
