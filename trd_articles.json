        "content": "After a post-primary spike in donations from real estate executives, Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 campaign saw contributions from the industry level off.\nReal estate donors gave Adams a little more than $60,500 between July 12 and August 18, according to the latest filings with the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board. That\u2019s down considerably from the more than $480,000 he received from the industry between June 25 and July 11, following former Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s defeat in the Democratic primary.\nThe sudden boost from the industry was\nseen\nas an early sign that real estate professionals \u2014\u00a0who had rallied behind Cuomo\u2019s campaign leading up to the primary \u2014\u00a0were shifting support to the mayor\u2019s re-election bid.\nBut over the last month, Adams, who is running as an independent, has ranked fourth in multiple\npolls\n, trailing behind Assembly member and Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, Cuomo and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa. Though he escaped federal corruption charges himself, allegations have continued to plague his inner circle. Last week, current and former members of his administration were\nindicted\non charges related to speeding up construction approvals and steering contracts to certain developers.\nThe real estate contributions during the latest filing period \u2014 based on donors who self-reported working within various sectors of the industry \u2014 represent roughly 14 percent of the total $425,000 Adams brought in over the last month. During the previous filing period, he received $1.5 million in total donations.\nTodd Shapiro, a spokesperson for the Adams campaign, brushed off any suggestion that the latest donations indicate waning enthusiasm among industry players. He pointed to a number of fundraisers held by real estate executives after the primary.\nSL Green Realty\u2019s Marc Holliday hosted a fundraiser for Adams in July, and employees of the real estate investment trust\ndonated\nmore than $67,000 to the mayor\u2019s re-election period after the primary. Shapiro noted that the donations and fundraisers happen at different times, and looking at one filing period fails to account for big-picture support from the industry.\n\u201cThe real estate industry wholeheartedly supports Mayor Eric Adams,\u201d he said.\nBefore news of the indictments, as well as\nreports\nthat one of his campaign advisors handed a reporter a potato chip bag stuffed with cash, real estate executives gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to Empower NYC, a super PAC backing Adams.\nAn LLC tied to Two Trees Management gave the super PAC $100,000 on August 11. GFP Real Estate\u2019s Jeff Gural contributed $25,000 on August 15. In an email, Gural said he still thinks Adams is the best choice, but acknowledged that the \u201clatest batch of arrests make it much harder for that to happen.\u201d He doesn\u2019t, however, intend to support another candidate.\nDeveloper Gary Barnett gave the PAC $250,000 on July 2, and billionaire Alexander Rovt donated $15,000 on June 6. Officials paused a city office lease at Rovt\u2019s 14 Wall Street in November amid questions of whether the property got special treatment because of Rovt\u2019s previous support of Adams. The administration ultimately allowed the lease to\nmove\nforward.\n\nThose who gave the Adams campaign the maximum $2,100 include Tao Group Hospitality co-CEOs Noah Tepperberg and Jason Strauss, based out of Manhattan and Las Vegas, respectively; Harry Bajraktari, whose eponymous Bronx firm owns and manages more than 70 buildings; Corcoran broker Dana Power; Nest Seekers broker Andy Kim; Adam Falk, a principal and co-portfolio manager at BH3 Management in Manhattan; Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s Gil Gideon; and Broadway Construction Group\u2019s Joseph Aiello.\nLandlord Paul Gjonaj gave $1,000, while his brother, former Bronx Council member Mark Gjonaj, also an owner and property manager, gave $500. The former Council member, who had been subject to a\nprobe\nrelated to government contracts awarded to campaign donors (no charges or discipline were ever announced), dropped his bid for re-election in 2021, telling City &amp; State that the \u201ccurrent political climate is not favorable to a centrist ideology.\u201d\nCuomo\u2019s donations from the industry have bounced back since the last filing period. Over the last month, he brought in a little more than $53,700 from the real estate industry. After the primary through July 11, he only received $2,115 in total, with a $25 donation from one real estate agent (at the time, Cuomo\u2019s team indicated that the campaign had stopped fundraising after maxing out on donations ahead of the primary).\nRFR Realty\u2019s Charles and Gabriel Rosen each gave $2,100 in August. Others who gave the maximum amount to Cuomo during this filing period include Icon Realty Management\u2019s Todd Cohen, CBRE\u2019s Ken Meyerson, Florida developer Peter Brock and Rob Vecsler, CEO of Hyperion Group, a development firm based in Manhattan and Miami.\nBetween July 12 and August 18, the Cuomo campaign reported receiving just over $472,500 in donations. The campaign also transferred\n$68,000 from a state account\n.\nThe super PAC, Fix the City, received millions of dollars from industry donors in the lead-up to the primary. The PAC has indicated that it will still support Cuomo in the general election, but it hasn\u2019t received many contributions from real estate donors since the June primary. Equity Residential gave it $10,000 earlier this month.\nMeanwhile, Mamdani reported taking in more than $1 million during this period. Though many in the industry have been critical of Mamdani\u2019s policies,\nsome have donated\nto his campaign. They tend, however, to be nonprofit or affordable developers or otherwise smaller industry players.\nOne developer who donated to Mamdani explained that his support was a product simply of Mamdani being the Democratic nominee, and that the developer\u2019s kids are roughly the same age as the Assembly member and are supporting him.\nMamdani\u2019s latest filings indicate that roughly $19,700 came from real estate-related donors. That included a $2,100 contribution from Obaid Khan, chief financial officer at Tishman Realty.\nOver the last month, Sliwa raised roughly $406,400, with more than $9,000 coming from real estate donors. Attorney Jim Walden, who is running as an independent, received a total of $8,200 over the last month and reported some small donations from construction professionals.\n",

        "content": "Thrive Living\u2019s affordable housing development in East Hollywood is moving forward with the help of a $65 million construction loan.\nThe Los Angeles-based developer, an affiliate of New York-based Magnum Real Estate Group, secured the loan from J.P. Morgan for a seven-story building at 1141 North Vermont Avenue, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n.\nThe development will feature 290 studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom units for residents making up to 80 percent of the area median income. In Los Angeles County, this is\ndefined\nas a maximum annual income of $84,850 for one person or $121,450 for a household of four.\nTo bring the 1141 Vermont development to life, Thrive Living will use prefabricated modular units, thus allowing for a speedier construction timeline. Work on the site could be completed within 14 months, according to Urbanize. The property will feature amenities like a rooftop deck, a community room and various landscaped outdoor spaces.\nAnother modular Thrive Living project, a 376-unit development at 1457 North Main Street in Chinatown, also benefited from a J.P. Morgan construction loan, per Urbanize. By using modular construction there, Thrive\nexpects\nto cut costs by 15 percent.\n\nThe area near the Vermont/Santa Monica Metro station, where the 1141 Vermont development will rise, is in the midst of a transformation as other affordable housing projects get underway nearby.\nOutside the train station entrance, Little Tokyo Service Center built a 187-unit affordable housing complex, while one block to the east, Jamison Properties is similarly building a 177-unit mixed-income development.\nPrefabricated modular projects such as Thrive Living\u2019s latest East Hollywood endeavor are proving to be beneficial in the Los Angeles area for both single-family and multifamily developments.\nIn the wake of January\u2019s deadly wildfires, some homeowners in the Eaton and Palisades burn zones have turned to\nprefabricated models\nto erect\ntemporary housing\non their property. As Altadena, the Pacific Palisades, Malibu and other surrounding areas emerge from the ashes, modular housing could end up being a boon for these homeowners .\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The complex at 21200 Kittridge Street is now called The Kitt at Warner Center and boasts a resort-inspired pool and spa, al fresco dining and an outdoor fireplace. The value-add, Chicago-based investor plans to renovate the one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments and revamp common areas.\n\n\u201cWhat made it attractive was primarily the value-add upside. The vast majority of units are in either original condition from 2007 or have been partially upgraded over the years. The common areas and amenities can be reconfigured and improved,\u201d Kol Rath, vice president of acquisitions at Waterton, said when the deal was announced. The company, founded and helmed by David Schwartz, owns thousands of apartments in Los Angeles.\nThe Kitt at Warner Center is within a master-planned community, the Warner Center, where the billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Rams, Stanley Kroenke, has proposed a $10 billion\ndevelopment\n.\nWoodland Hills has a 4.3 percent multifamily vacancy rate, and commands $2,788 average rent per apartment, according to a second-quarter CBRE market\nreport\n. That\u2019s on par with typical vacancies and rents throughout the Los Angeles market. The highest multifamily sale price for that period was $126 million for a 235-unit apartment building in Glendale, according to the report.\nWaterton has been pretty active, on the buy and sell side. The company recently began\nmarketing\ntwo 14-story apartment buildings in Chicago. Waterton paid about $82 million for the complex, called Grand Central, two years earlier. In another deal, last year Waterton\npurchased\na San Francisco complex encompassing seven six-story buildings from Brookfield for $177.5 million.\nAMLI last summer\nsold\na 325-unit apartment complex for around $89 million in South Florida.",

        "content": "Dry Creek Capital is getting in position to gain a second foothold in the office market with distressed debt deals surrounding Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International Airport.\nThe Denver-based firm acquired the loan note for the $47.3 million non-performing mortgage tied to the O\u2019Hare International Center, a two-building, 530,000-square-foot property at 10255 and 10275 Higgins Road in Rosemont, Steve Emerson of Dry Creek confirmed. The property is owned by Utah-based Bridge Investment Group\nThe loan note traded for about $26.5 million, according to a person familiar with the deal. Emerson declined to discuss the price. But a transaction for that amount would have dealt a blow to Alabama-based lender Regions Bank, which originated a $50 million mortgage loan to Bridge in 2018 for the landlord\u2019s $64 million purchase of the property. Bridge poured another $8 million into improvements during its ownership, meaning the landlord is feeling some financial pain as the property\u2019s value is likely well below its investment.\nThe deal sets Dry Creek up to seize the property from Bridge, though Emerson said the path forward is still being discussed between the companies. The asset is 76 percent leased, according to JLL.\nThis is the buyer\u2019s second distressed debt acquisition in the O\u2019Hare office market. Dry Creek seized the 210,000-square-foot building at 25 Northwest Point Boulevard in Elk Grove Village earlier this summer from a venture of Michigan-based landlord Farbman Group.\nIt may not be Dry Creek\u2019s last deal in the area, either, though it has recently been active in the Washington, D.C., region, Emerson said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a ton of dry powder,\u201d he said. \u201cWe mainly purchase loans from banks.\u201d\nBridge and Farbman are far from the only victims of the downturn for suburban Chicago office properties. The sector is rough for landlords, as vacancy is hovering near record highs of over 30 percent on average, with demand from tenants shrinking as companies cut space while remote and hybrid work schedules linger and interest rates are elevated. Landlords are being forced to offer steep concessions just to attract or keep tenants.\nOn top of that, landlords are skittish about sinking more money into their properties when leasing absorption has been negative for years, leaving a lot of suburban offices stuck in limbo.\nDry Creek stripped Farbman of the Northwest Point property two years after buying the loan note for the building, which took its second consecutive nosedive in value as the former landlord\u2019s loan came due, Cook County property records show. Farbman bought the property for just under $20 million in 2013 from a John Buck Company venture that had bought it in 2007 for $31.5 million. Farbman used a $16 million mortgage loan from KeyBank to finance its acquisition, and distressed debt specialist Dry Creek acquired the note in 2023.\nJLL\u2019s Tom Hall, Kyle Kaminski, Pat Shields and Sam DiFrancesca marketed the O\u2019Hare International Center loan for sale.\n",

That puts the price at about $95 per square foot. The six-story, 52,500-square-foot building at 225 West Ohio Street was sold well below its going price a decade earlier of $13.3 million. Green Bay-based lender Associated Bank seized the property last year to resolve an outstanding loan on the building.\nAssociated took over the deed in a foreclosure from Dallas-based Transwestern Investment Group last summer. Transwestern refinanced the property in 2020 with a $9.4 million mortgage from Associated. Transwestern paid down the loan balance by $2.7 million, buying an extension beyond the original maturity date in 2023, but eventually the lender seized it.\nThe discounted price reflects the struggle office buildings have faced across the country post-pandemic, as high interest rates and work-from-home policies became the norm.\n\nCubed and R2 are betting on discounted offices increasing in value amid the trend of converting larger office towers into residential, removing some competition, Cubed principal Eric Weber told the outlet.\nThe River North building is 78 percent leased, and the buyers plan to lease it up. The largest tenant in the building is engineering and landscape design firm Terra Engineering. R2 has been testing investor interest in net-leased properties, which are characterized by a single long-term tenant covering most operational costs.\nThe purchase follows a\ntrend\nfor R2, which purchased another six-story building in\nRiver North\nearlier in August.The 70,000-square-foot\noffice\nproperty at 303 West Erie Street sold for $7.5 million, and it followed a similar steep discount pattern. The seller, New York-based Alvarez &amp; Marsal Property Investments, paid double that for the building in 2017.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Glencoe officials are debating how far the village should go to preserve its historic housing stock, as teardown pressure chips away at the North Shore suburb\u2019s architectural legacy.\nThe Preservation Commission pitched a package of new incentives, from tax rebates to permit fee discounts, aimed at encouraging owners to landmark their properties, the Record North Shore\nreported\n. But trustees balked at the potential price tag, questioning whether the village should shoulder the cost of keeping older homes intact.\nGlencoe designates homes in three categories: \u201ccertified landmarks,\u201d which carry strict protections and qualify for state and local incentives; \u201chonorary landmarks,\u201d subject only to demolition delays and advisory reviews; and \u201chistorically significant\u201d homes, which come with no regulatory teeth. Since 2013, when the state limited tax benefits to certified landmarks only, honorary designations have plummeted \u2014 and demolitions have picked up. Just three homes have received honorary status in the past 12 years, compared with 92 between 1990 and 2013. Eight honorary landmarks have been torn down since 2013, nearly matching the 13 lost over the prior two decades.\nIn an effort to reverse the trend, the commission proposed giving certified landmark owners rebates of up to 90 percent on building permit fees and $2,000 annual property tax breaks for eight years. Honorary landmarks would qualify for 50 percent fee rebates. Both programs would be capped annually to control village costs.\n\nThe group also asked trustees to consider zoning incentives, such as flexible setbacks and height allowances, as a lower-cost way to make preservation more appealing. Other recommendations included doubling demolition delays to 360 days and requiring owners to consent to honorary designations. The Village Board asked staff for more detail and is set to revisit the issue at its Sept. 18 meeting.\nThe question of preservation versus development is also being put to the test in other high-end\nChicagoland\nsuburbs. Last year, buyers in Winnetka wanted to tear down a $12.3 million historic mansion known as the\nClement Stone Mansio\nn, at 445 Sheridan Road, a Spanish revival built in 1912. And after rolling out an anti-teardown incentives package in\nHinsdale\nthree years ago, that town\u2019s Historic Preservation Commission changed the minds of the buyers of a 1930s colonial mansion set to be demolished.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The buyers were attorney\nPeter Sluka\nand\nYixiao Feng.\nThe price for the more than 4,100-square-foot, split-level unit works out to about $1,900 per square foot. The condo has six bedrooms and two terraces measuring a combined 1,500 square feet. It had been on and off the market since 2022, when its asking price was $11.5 million, but its most recent asking price was just under $9 million. Compass\u2019\nMichael Keith Davis\nand\nSuzanne Johansson-Cawley\nhad the listing.

The property had been home to Gulliver\u2019s Gate and National Geographic before the pandemic. It once belonged to the Kushners, who lost the property to foreclosure last year after paying $295 million for the space a decade ago. The buyer took over the property from the lender and plans to redevelop the property, which is about 35 percent occupied.

        "content": "A month\u2019s worth of political donations isn\u2019t the definitive record of who the real estate industry is supporting in the mayoral race.\nIt is, however, a pulse check. Leading up to the primary, the big industry players were overwhelmingly donating to former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. That changed after he lost, and then Mayor Eric Adams saw a sudden surge in industry donations. He brought in more than $489,000 from real estate donors after the primary, up through July 11.\nNow we have the latest donations, received between July 12 through August 18:\nZohran Mamdani\nReal estate donations: $19,720\nTotal contributions reported this period: $1 million\nEric Adams\nReal estate donations: $60,545\nTotal contributions reported this period: $425,181\nAndrew Cuomo\nReal estate donations: $53,720\nTotal contributions reported this period: $472,537 (plus a $68,225 transfer from a state fund)\nCurtis Sliwa\nReal estate donations: $9,939\nTotal contributions reported this period: $406,392\nJim Walden\n\nReal estate donations: $250\nTotal contributions reported this period: $8,222\nThe bottom line? The industry is still by and large supporting Adams and Cuomo. Donations to the mayor have slowed since the last filing period, but that seemed to be driven by an immediate (panicked) reaction to Cuomo\u2019s primary loss.\nThe next filing deadline is Oct. 3, at which point we should have a better sense of whether the industry is deciding to pull back further on its spending ahead of the general election. Of course, if someone drops out, everything could change.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill anyone drop out of the mayoral race before the general election? Have you heard anything about the land use ballot questions lately? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nThe term synanthrope (undomesticated creatures that live in close proximity to humans, such as rats, pigeons or squirrels) comes from the Greek \u201csyn,\u201d meaning \u201ctogether with\u201d and anthropos, which is \u201cman,\u201d according to the book \u201cThe 99% Invisible City: A Field Guide to The Hidden World of Everyday Design.\u201d\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 former chief advisor, Ingrid Lewis-Martin, was indicted last week on charges that she accepted kickbacks, including a brief cameo on the TV show \u201cGodfather of Harlem\u201d, in exchange for interfering with a controversial traffic redesign. But she isn\u2019t the only member of the mayor\u2019s inner circle to get a gig with the show.\nGothamist\nreported that Adams\u2019 son, Jordan Coleman, acted as personal assistant to actor Forest Whitaker during the show\u2019s second season, in what was described by two production employees as a \u201cpolitical hire.\u201d\n\u2014 Gothamist\nprofiled\nDrew Warshaw, who is emerging as a challenger to state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli. Warshaw\u2019s platform focused on the affordability crisis. As part of his campaign, he wants to invest $10 billion of the state pension fund into affordable housing projects.\n\u2014 Zohran Mamdani\u2019s campaign held a scavenger hunt over the weekend,\nNewsweek\nreported. The activity dovetailed with the mayoral candidate\u2019s campaign promise of fast, free buses, as participants used public transit to cross the city to various stops, several of them transit-themed. \u2014\nQuinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was for a condominium unit at 63 West 17th Street for\n$7.8 million\n. The unit at The Lyla Condominium is 4,100 square feet and listed by\nCompass\u2019\nThe Davis Team.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$5.4 million\nfor 856 Greene Avenue. The Bedford-Stuyvesant rental building is three stories, has six units and is 5,800 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $7 million for a penthouse unit at 545 West 110th Street. The Morningside Heights condo is 3,100 square feet.\nCompass\u2019\nDeirdre De Risi and Marissa Galletti have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for a proposed 222,596-square-foot, six-story school building at 153-10 Hillside Avenue in Queens. Carrie Moore of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill is the applicant of record.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

The sale price of the 6,400-square-foot property isn\u2019t available, but it was asking $5 million when it sold after 101 days on the market, about $777 per square foot and $1 million higher than its last tax appraisal.\nThe listing agent, Eklund Gomes\u2019 Jeff Burke, didn\u2019t mince words in the listing summary: This single-family home is a business. The Bouldin Compound, as it\u2019s known on Vrbo, is projected to generate $700,000 in revenue this year as a short-term rental. (It\u2019s booked already for Labor Day weekend.) Catering to corporate retreats, the property managers have planned a conference area among other renovations. They\u2019re also \u201cactively working to build partnerships with major events like SXSW, ACL, F1 and the BLAST.tv Major, one of the world\u2019s largest e-sports tournaments,\u201d according to the listing.\n\nThe Bouldin Creek neighborhood is just across the river from downtown Austin and the Rainey Street Historic District, a nightlife hotspot.\nThe property has changed hands three times since it was built in 2018, and every owner after the original \u2014 a couple named Samuel and Lucia Ruiz \u2014 has been a business. The seller, an LLC registered to Adam Coleman, acquired the property last summer. Travis County hasn\u2019t published records relating to the sale yet.\nThe Bouldin Compound shouldered a West Austin new build to second place in the city\u2019s most-expensive residential sales last month. A five-bedroom mansion on 0.62 acres at 1604 Barclay Drive was asking $3.9 million when it sold last week.\n",

        "content": "The developers of a $1 billion project in Leander were dealt another setback by the Austin suburb.\nAustin-based iLand Development Group\u2019s updated plans for the 78-acre Leander Springs project was denied by the Leander City Council last week, Austin Business Journal\nreported\n. The unanimous vote denied amendments to its public utility district agreement with the city, further delaying any dirt moving on the ambitious mixed-use project centered around a 4-acre artificial lagoon, which was first announced five years ago.\nThe developer requested amendments to reduce the required number of apartments from 1,600 to 1,200, as well as some changes to the timeline. It asked for removal of the date required for certificate of completion on the lagoon, and to remove the time requirement for hotel construction and delivery. The PUD requires the hotel to be complete by the end of 2028.\nThe amendment also would\u2019ve removed the requirement that the Lagoon be open to the public, with admission offered at a discount to Leander residents.\nKey sticking points in moving the development forward have been water usage, stakeholder investment, a terminated\n$22 million\ncity incentive package \u2014 lost by tapping the federal EB-5 program, which trades permanent resident status to foreign investors and their families in exchange for investment in commercial enterprises. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality\u2019s website lists a permit application for an entity tied to the project to discharge up an average of 1.4 million gallons of treated effluent and stormwater per day. Leander Mayor Christine DeLisle has long been skeptical of the project due to concerns over water usage.\n\nAnother request in the PUD amendment was to designate the lagoon as a \u201cnon-essential use\u201d in terms of water so that it would have had to comply with conservation.\nAfter\u00a0 the Aug. 21 meeting, iLand said in a statement that the company is eager to move forward with the project, and that the water management plan presented to the City Council and residents is robust. iLand dropped Miami-based Crystal Lagoons as the lagoon developer, and Austin-based VVater has replaced it.\nThe setbacks don\u2019t stop with just water-use concerns for the project, at FM 2243 and the 183A frontage, intended to transform Leander into a\nCentral Texas\ndestination. Since announcing the project in 2020, iLand has faced setbacks that include $3 million in liens to contractors.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The leases bring the property\u2019s occupancy to 80 percent, according to a release from property owners Glenstar and Singerman Real Estate, which are based in Chicago.\nThe resi brokerage, which had a 17,000-square-foot office in Grapevine, will occupy 18,000 square feet on the first floor of the 278,000-square-foot Building 8 starting in September.\nIn addition, workforce development company Pluralsight moved its headquarters from Draper, Utah, to a 26,000-square-foot space in Building 6. Defense contractor M1 Support Services is shifting its headquarters from Denton to Building 5 of Terraces, where it inked a deal for 26,000 square feet of the 124,000-square-foot building.\nThe leasing momentum at the property follows a $25 million renovation completed in 2021. The campus now has 50,000 square feet of amenity space, including a restaurant, conference center, gym and covered parking.\n\nThe amenities sealed the deal for Century 21 Mike Bowman, said president Dave Bowman. Specifically, the brokerage will be able to host national events in the conference center.\nThese wins for the property speak to the strength of the office market in Dallas-Fort Worth suburbs. Companies are eager to locate closer to where employees live, in places like Westlake, which is an upscale suburb about 30 miles northwest of Dallas.\nHalfway through the year, JLL reported positive net absorption for the North Texas office market. It was highest in the second quarter in suburbs like Plano, McKinney and Irving\u2019s Las Colinas area.\nVacancy is stuck at 27.7 percent across Dallas-Fort Worth, according to JLL. The high rate is attributable to empty space in the region\u2019s office properties built in the \u201980s and \u201990s.\nThe vacancy rate has declined for Class A properties, CBRE reported, highlighting the continued prevalence of the flight-to-quality trend that has office users seeking properties with high-end amenities to lure their remote workers back to the office.\n",

        "content": "Dallas has been working behind the scenes to map out a new home for the Mavericks, even as officials keep the details under wraps.\nThe city hired Hillwood Urban Services this spring under a $75,000 consulting deal to identify potential sites for a new NBA arena, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. The three-month contract \u2014 approved administratively without City Council sign-off \u2014 tasked Hillwood with site evaluations, feasibility analysis and final recommendations for where the Mavs might land after their lease at American Airlines Center expires in 2031, in time to open an arena by the 2031-2032 NBA season.\nNeither the city nor Hillwood, the developer behind the AAC and Victory Park, disclosed what sites were studied. Dallas rejected a public records request\u00a0 from the outlet for related documents, citing confidentiality exemptions tied to economic development negotiations. The city appealed to the Texas Attorney General to keep the information sealed, saying disclosure would reveal incentive offers still in play.\n\nThe cloak-and-dagger approach comes as speculation mounts. Mavericks CEO Rick Welts confirmed last month that officials floated several possible locations and said the team is assessing two of them, though he cautioned that \u201cneither may work.\u201d Sources have suggested possibilities ranging from land near the planned convention center downtown to the former Valley View mall site in North Dallas. The county-owned jail land has also been floated, though officials say no talks have occurred.\nWelts, who previously oversaw the development of the $1.4 billion Chase Center in San Francisco during his time with the\nGolden State Warriors\n, said the\nMavericks\nare leaning toward a basketball-only facility. Hiring Welts to lead the organization last year might also provide fuel to the idea of anchoring a new stadium to a\ncasino\n.\nThe hunt for a site is only half the battle \u2014 financing could prove far trickier. In San Antonio, where officials are mulling a $1.3 billion arena for the\nSpurs\n, the funding plan includes $311 million in tourism taxes and up to $489 million in city money, alongside $500 million from the team.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Two decades ago, the\nFallon Company\ndeveloped a 20-unit condominium on Sackett Street in Brooklyn. Since then the Boston-based builder has finished more than $5 billion worth of projects, but not a single one in New York City.\nIt\u2019s not because CEO Michael Fallon, whose father\nJoseph Fallon\nfounded the company in 1993, has anything against New York City.\n\u201cNew York is such a fabulous place,\u201d he said, describing it as the social, cultural and business mecca of the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s such a deep pool of opportunity.\u201d\nYet Fallon sees greener pastures for his firm in the Southeast, in particular Nashville and Charlotte, as well as his home market of Boston.\n\u201cWhy are we focused on the markets we\u2019re focused on? Scale and access to capital,\u201d the 36-year-old said in a Zoom interview with\nThe Real Deal\n.\nFallon likes building in Nashville and Charlotte because of their good infrastructure, financial health, amenable stakeholders, business-friendly political climates and nice weather. Also, both have a National Football League franchise.\nMost of Fallon\u2019s $6 billion pipeline is in the Southeast. There, he doesn\u2019t have to worry that locals will elect political leaders eager to \u201cdecommoditize\u201d housing \u2014 a concept that popped up as Fallon researched\nZohran Mamdani\nin preparation for his\nTRD\ninterview.\nIn one campaign video, Mamdani says, \u201cIf we want to end the housing crisis, the solution has to be moving toward the\nfull de-commodification of housing\n.\u201d\nTo the contrary, the only feasible strategy to end \u2014 or prevent \u2014 a housing crisis is to allow for-profit development at scale.\nFallon does that by building affordable units the traditional way, typically with Low Income Housing Tax Credits, partnerships with big insurers such as Mass Mutual and Prudential, and debt from major lenders including\nFortress Investment Group\n; Santander,\nBank OZK\n, Wells Fargo and Key Bank.\nThe first phase of his next\nNashville project\nwill be 100 percent affordable and have north of 300 units. In the second phase, 10 percent of the units will be income-restricted. The\n$3 billion project\n, of which Fallon is the master developer, is expected to break ground next year.\n\nFallon is also working with\nCharlotte\u2019s housing authority\non a mixed-use project with 975 residential units, 405,000 square feet of office, 36,000 square feet of retail and amenities, and a 180-key hotel. Phase one includes 329 units, 20 percent of which will be affordable.\nTo be sure, the Fallon Company\u2019s last New York project was long before the socialist Mamdani came along. It has steered clear because like most developers, it prefers to operate in markets where it knows the players and the regulatory, cultural and political environment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about de-risking that whole spectrum of development as much as you can,\u201d the CEO said. \u201cIn New York, it\u2019s very complex and challenging to build.\u201d\nHis company has been in Charlotte since 2016, Raleigh since 2018 and Nashville since 2019.\n\u201cNashville in particular is very focused on \u2018how do we make this a compelling investment opportunity for a company relocation?\u2019\u201d Fallon said. \u201cYou need the city to remove friction points, and that is what the city and state are really good at.\u201d\nTennessee\u2019s capital city is pursuing smart growth and striving to be competitive with other Southeast markets in attracting development, the CEO said.\nNew York has become more\nhospitable\nto new housing since the city\u2019s vacancy rate was found to have sunk to a\nrecord low of 1.4 percent\nin 2023, but it still requires\nhigh wages\nand\nsubstantial affordability\nin large multifamily projects. The hotel workers union has effectively\nblocked nonunion hotels\n. Rezoning remains a\ncrapshoot\n, and\nhistoric districts\nand\nlocal opposition\nare major obstacles.\nDoing a big project in New York would mean navigating these pitfalls and competing with firms familiar with the ins and outs of the city; Fallon cited the Related Companies\u2019\nHudson Yards\nand Tishman Speyer\u2019s\nthe Spiral\nas among his favorite developments. He would also have to find investors to bet on that proposition.\n\u201cWe need to focus on markets where we have a competitive edge in product, in relationships, in policy,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cThat works for partners with very long-term capital.\u201d\n",

Additionally, Vistria Group, in its first ground-up development, is infusing $120 million in equity and taking a majority stake in the project as a limited partner. Alloy, as general partner, will continue to lead development and is kicking in $40 million.\nAccording to Alloy, the 730-foot tower is slated to be the world\u2019s tallest built to passive house standards, a design method aimed at cutting energy costs through extreme insulation. The project is the second phase of \u201cAlloy Block,\u201d which includes the city\u2019s first all-electric skyscraper at 505 State Street and two public schools (also passive house) at 489 State Street.\n\nOne Third Avenue will include 143 affordable housing units, with monthly rents starting at $1,023 per month. These apartments will be reserved for tenants earning, on average, 60 percent of the area median income.\nResidential space will span the 11th through 60th floors, and the tower\u2019s podium will include 60,000 square feet of office space. Two buildings constructed in the 1800s on State Street and Schermerhorn Street will also be incorporated into the development, and house 30,000 square feet of retail space.\nDemolition work on the site began earlier this year, and the development team expects to begin construction in the fall.\nWhen finished, Alloy Block is expected to include more than 1,000 homes, with 200 set aside as permanently affordable. The electric tower at 505 State Street was completed in July 2024. The developers\nsecured\n$290 million to replace a $210 million construction loan in December.\n",

        "content": "The family-run Rosenwach Group is thinking of adding opportunities for hundreds of families to live at the site of a shopping center in Astoria.\nRosenwach filed an application with the Department of City Planning to rezone the LaGuardia Center at 43-02 Ditmars Boulevard in the Queens neighborhood, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The firm wants to turn the low-rise shopping center into a mixed-use complex with nearly 500 units.\nRosenwach proposed a 412,000-square-foot complex that would be between eight and ten stories tall. The property would include 492 residential units, 25 percent of which would be affordable for those earning a maximum of 60 percent of the area median income.\nThe proposal also includes a significant retail component \u2014 62,000 square feet in all on the ground floor, including a 2,300-square-foot cafe and gallery \u2014 which would allow the tenants of LaGuardia Center to remain in place when the redevelopment is completed. Tenants include a supermarket, a laundromat, a bank and restaurants.\nAdditional aspects of the proposal include a landscaped public terrace and parking for 175 vehicles.\n\n\u201cWe always thought that the center \u2014 now and hopefully in the future \u2014 was the heartbeat of the neighborhood,\u201d director of operations Henry Rosenwach told the outlet. \u201cWe really just want to take it one step further for the community.\u201d\nDevelopment costs and timeline were not disclosed. Because of previous work, however, Rosenwach expects to qualify for the lapsed 421a tax break, for which construction needs to be completed by the middle of June 2031 after the deadline was extended last year.\nRosenwach acquired the site in 1989 for an undisclosed price and operates out of the address. In addition to being a landlord, the firm also helped develop rooftop water towers across the city.\nElsewhere on Ditmars, Pasadena-based hospitality investor ASAP Holdings\nfiled a rezoning application\ntowards the end of 2023 to replace the 410 parking spaces at the New York LaGuardia Airport Marriott with a mixed-use building containing 437 apartments and a separate structure containing 98 affordable residences for seniors.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Catellus Development and Deca are looking to turn a petroleum refinery near Long Beach into a modern industrial hub with restaurants and retail.\nThe developers have proposed replacing 406 acres of oil-refining operations and another 228-acre refinery site into millions of square feet of industrial space with grocers, restaurants, sports facilities and greenways available to nearby residents, CoStar\nreported\n. If approved, it would be among the largest conversions of previously environmentally hazardous land in California history.\nLast year,\noil giant Phillips 66\ntapped Catellus and Deca to help redevelop its Los Angeles refinery operations which include the 406-acre site at 1660 West Anaheim Street in Wilmington and a 228-acre site at 1520 East Sepulveda Boulevard in Carson. Catellus and Deca have filed plans with the city of Los Angeles for its Five Points Union Specific Plan, which would require zoning changes before any shovels can hit dirt.\nAt the Wilmington site, the Anaheim Street land will be split into two portions: A commercial and recreation strip along Anaheim Street with grocery stores, cafes, sports courts and greenways, and a logistics area with warehouses to the south.\n\nThe Wilmington development would stretch across three parcels including the 410-acre refinery site, a 10-acre vacant lot north of Anaheim Street and a 20-acre propane and butane storage yard. Plans have yet to be announced for the Carson site, though it could be redeveloped for industrial logistics use. It could also face separate legal and logistical hurdles due to its location in the city of Carson.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time Catellus has undertaken such a project.\nIn 2003, the Emeryville-based firm redeveloped the 200-acre former Pacific Refinery Company near San Francisco into a residential subdivision known as Victoria by the Bay. In order to do that, the company had to remove contaminants from the site, not unlike what it will have to do in Wilmington and Carson.\nMeanwhile, in Huntington Beach, Shopoff Realty is\nlooking to redevelop\nthe\nMagnolia Tank Farm\nwith housing.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",
