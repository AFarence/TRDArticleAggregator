        "content": "The Seminole Tribe of Florida is suing Lennar for allegedly building 465 defective homes on tribal land across Florida.\nIn an amended Aug. 29 lawsuit in Broward County Circuit Court, the Seminole Tribe alleges\nLennar\n, a Miami-based national homebuilder led by Executive Chairman and co-CEO Stuart Miller and co-CEO and President Jon Jaffe, built shoddy houses that have damaged hundreds of tribal members. As a result, the\nSeminole Tribe\nis on the hook for reimbursing damages and out-of-pocket relocation expenses amounting to \u201ctens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars,\u201d the complaint states.\nThe Seminole Tribe alleges that houses Lennar developed on Seminole reservations in the state have significant construction issues, including faulty roofing and ventilation systems, leading to potentially hazardous mold growth.\n\u201cIt is just a huge disappointment for people in the tribe that relied on Lennar,\u201d said Wiliam Scherer, the Seminole Tribe\u2019s attorney. \u201cWe were working in good faith, and [Lennar] led us down a garden path. They promised they would fix the homes. The longer it went, our engineers examining the homes kept finding more problems.\u201d\nThe defects are so serious that the Seminole Tribe has to move families out of the 462 homes into temporary housing, Scherer said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a few years,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a major undertaking.\u201d\n\nA Lennar spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe Seminole Tribe and Lennar entered into a community development agreement in 2019. The two sides attempted mediation in March, but were not successful, the complaint states. The same month, the Seminole Tribe had filed its initial lawsuit, and the case was briefly stayed on April 29, as Lennar attempted remediation efforts on the homes that were unsuccessful, court filings show.\nThis month, Lennar filed two separate motions to compel arbitration and again stay the lawsuit, according to court records.\nBased in Hollywood, the Seminole Tribe owns the\nSeminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Hollywood\n, which includes a guitar-shaped hotel with 638 rooms.\nLennar, a publicly traded firm, is among the largest homebuilders in the U.S. Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway bought more than 7 million shares in Lennar for nearly\n$800 million\nin the first half of this year.\nLennar is heavily invested in south Miami-Dade County where the firm has several developments on tap. The company recently submitted plans for\nRetro West\n, a 106-townhome development near Homestead. The 10-acre project would include 11 townhomes set aside for workforce housing.",

        "content": "Elon Musk\u2019s Texas land grab is bigger than anyone realized.\nHis companies own more than 500 properties covering 6,000 acres across the state, from Cybertruck assembly lines outside of Austin to rocket launch pads at the Mexican border, an analysis by the Houston Chronicle\nfound\n.\nProperty records from all 254 Texas counties tracked holdings tied to Tesla, SpaceX, the Boring Company and 11 other Musk entities, which often hide behind banal names like \u201cColorado River Project\u201d or \u201cDogleg Park.\u201d\nThe crown jewel is Giga Texas, Tesla\u2019s 2,500-acre Austin factory complex that has ballooned to more than 10 million square feet of production space and could double if filings for another wave of buildings move forward. The plant cranks out Model Ys and the Cybertruck, which are shuttled through a Boring Co. tunnel beneath Texas 130 to staging areas. The main facility is nearly three quarters of a mile long.\nAbout 20 miles east, in Bastrop, Musk\u2019s tunneling startup has carved out more than 350 acres for testing\ngiant boring machines\nand housing staff in a makeshift village called Snailbrook. Across the road, SpaceX runs a 700,000-square-foot Starlink factory that turns out 70,000 satellite kits a week, with plans to double in size. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott sweetened the deal earlier this year with a $17.3 million grant tied to a $280 million SpaceX expansion.\nFarther south, SpaceX has converted scrubland near\nBrownsville\ninto \u201cStarbase,\u201d\na de facto company town\nof nearly 500 residents and thousands of workers. The site hosts Starship, the tallest rocket ever built, along with more than 1 million square feet of manufacturing. The company is\npushing to expand\nits launchpad and add housing, retail and a grocery store.\n\nTesla\u2019s reach extends beyond Austin and Brownsville. Near Corpus Christi, the automaker is bringing a lithium refinery online in Robstown, meant to supply battery-grade material for 1 million EVs a year. Outside Dallas, Tesla Energy is building a 125-megawatt battery storage plant in Royse City, one of the largest in ERCOT\u2019s pipeline.\nBesides these properties, Musk\u2019s companies have leased facilities around the state. Southwest of Waco in McGregor, SpaceX leased land to test rockets. Plans are in place for Tesla to lease a 1.03 million-square-foot building in Brookshire, west of Houston, for a battery manufacturing plant.\nMusk has made no secret of why he\u2019s gone \u201call in\u201d on Texas: lighter regulation, lower taxes and control.\n\u201cElon Musk has more control in Texas than he does anywhere else,\u201d said Goran Calic, a McMaster University professor who studies Musk\u2019s management style.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The sellers were former Bank of America COO\nThomas Montag and his wife\n, philanthropist and former banker\nJanet Montag\n, who purchased the townhouse in 2008 for $32.5 million. The latest transaction represents a 19 percent discount from its prior trade price. The renovated property was built in 1904 by Stanford White and measures 10,000 square feet. It has six bedrooms, five bathrooms, a basketball court, an elevator and a garden.\nPatricia Farman-Farmaian\nand\nLaurie Stolowitz\nwith Compass represented the sellers, who first put the home on the market in April 2024 for $36 million. The new owner is an LLC, which took out a $17.1 million mortgage with\nJPMorgan Chase Bank\nfor the purchase.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe estate of\nCarol Bernstein\nand an LLC managed by\nStanley Levin\nshed a three-story, mental health facility at\n38-11 Broadway\nin Astoria for about $9.8 million, marking the top commercial deal recorded in the city. The buyer was an LLC tied to\nJack Cohen\u2019s Comjem Associates.\nThe nearly 32,000-square-foot building appears to have been tied to the Bernstein and Levin families for decades.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nTwo neighboring apartment complexes, at\n499 and 503 Evergreen Avenue\nin Bushwick, traded for $8.3 million. The buyer was an affiliate of Great Neck, New York-based\nParkview Properties\n. The seller was developer\nUrban View Development Group\n. The property at 499 Evergreen Avenue stands five stories tall and has eight apartments, and the building at 503 Evergreen Avenue is four stories high, with nine apartments.\nLev Mavashev\nand\nEli Yusupov\nwith Alpha Realty had the listing.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nPsychologist\nDavid Guggenheim\nand\nMichael Bosworth\n, an attorney who once served as deputy assistant and deputy counsel to President Barack Obama, purchased a co-op at\n15 West 72nd Street\nfrom a trust linked to\nElizabeth Ann Mandell-Fine\nfor $9 million. The unit, located in the Mayfair Towers in the Upper West Side, has six bedrooms and five bathrooms, according to an old listing. The most recent sale appears to have been off-market.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nIn Chelsea,\nZoe Martineau\nand\nElia Zaitsev\n, chief technology officer at CrowdStrike, parted with a 3,000-square-foot condo at the Spears Building at\n525 West 22nd Street\n. The buyer,\nBrownie Batter LLC\n, paid $7.2 million, or $2,400 per square foot, for the unit. Martineau and Zaitsev had purchased the condo in March 2024 for $6.4 million. The latest transaction appears to have been off-market.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nA sliver of land at\n21 Park Place\nin Tribeca traded for $8 million. The seller of the almost 2,000-square-foot lot was an entity tied to\nMark Schneiderman\nthat had purchased the site in 2018 for $9 million.

        "content": "A long-delayed plan to legalize casitas and granny flats across Chicago is moving forward, but only after aldermen scaled it back with restrictions designed to protect single-family neighborhoods.\nAldermen Bennett Lawson and Marty Quinn ended a year-long stalemate over the\ncitywide expansion\nof accessory dwelling units, or ADUs. Their compromise kept Quinn\u2019s union-backed amendment requiring contractors to hire through certified apprentice programs for new construction, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The Chicago Federation of Labor and building trades had pressed hard for the measure, warning they would sink the ordinance otherwise.\nThe compromise, however, also gave aldermen near-total control over ADUs in single-family zones. Detached units will be banned in low-density districts unless a local alderman opts in. Even then, construction will be capped at one to three ADUs per block, depending on zoning. Detached houses that add an ADU must be owner-occupied. For multi-unit districts, ADUs will be allowed by right.\nThe legislation also scrapped a 700-square-foot size cap on coach houses but maintains a 22-foot height limit and other spacing rules. A Chicago City Council vote is expected Thursday.\nLawson had pushed for a broader legalization effort, framing ADUs as a way to chip away at Chicago\u2019s estimated 120,000-unit affordable housing shortage by creating unsubsidized, naturally occurring affordable units.\n\n\u201cIf you could build a two-flat, you can build an ADU,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cThis is a citywide ordinance. It\u2019s a big expansion.\u201d\nBut Quinn and allies leveraged organized labor\u2019s support to force concessions, arguing aldermen must retain veto power over zoning changes in their wards. The compromise underscores the Council\u2019s long-standing practice of\n\u201caldermanic prerogative.\u201d\nProgressives, including Mayor Brandon Johnson, had championed ADUs as a modest but citywide affordability fix. Johnson struck a diplomatic tone, saying he was \u201cgrateful\u201d the measure advanced despite aldermanic resistance.\nThe compromise leaves Chicago with a narrower ADU policy than housing advocates hoped for, but it marks the first meaningful\nexpansion\nsince the city launched a\nlimited pilot program\nin 2021.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

That land is not part of the listing.\nThe home has a saltwater aquarium, crystal chandeliers, hand-carved marble fireplaces and an outdoor waterfall.

It was built in 2016 and features six bedrooms, six bathrooms, three half bathrooms, coffered ceilings, wide-plank oak floors, a walnut-paneled elevator and two-story foyer.\nIt has a whole-home generator, smart home automation, more than 20 surveillance cameras and a safe room with a ballistic door.

If Highland Park Village is Dallas\u2019 Rodeo Drive, then Knox/Henderson will be Melrose Avenue and Abbot Kinney Boulevard, Weitzman\u2019s Vice President of Research Rob Darnell told the outlet.\n\nThe corridor has luxury momentum.

The area already has a wealthy population, and luxury highrises are expected to bring more.\nCBRE subsidiary Trammell Crow Company and a slate of partners are developing a 150-unit luxury condo tower and Auberge Resorts Collection hotel at 3319 Knox Street, expected to open next year.

        "content": "After a\nlong and controversial road\n, the Department for the Aging is officially relocating to 14 Wall Street in Lower Manhattan.\nThe Department of Citywide Administrative Services signed a 20-year lease for 81,000 square feet at Alexander Rovt\u2019s property, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The deal at the property owned by Rovt, an investor who has donated to Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 campaigns and legal fund, is worth $77 million.\nIn the first five years of the lease, the city will pay Rovt $33 per square foot. Every five years, the price per square foot will escalate, capped at $44 per square foot. It\u2019s unclear when the Department for the Aging will relocate from 2 Lafayette Street.\n\u201cI evaluated the deal, and it was clear that 14 Wall St. was the best economic deal for the city,\u201d DCAS Commissioner Louis Molina said.\nThe process for securing the lease has been ripe with criticism, particularly accusations that city officials steered the move towards an Adams donor. Former DCAS deputy commissioner Jesse Hamilton, who\nresigned\nlast month, has been at the center of the controversy involving city office leases. He\u2019s been indicted on corruption charges, though 14 Wall Street was not part of the indictment.\n\nHamilton reportedly stepped into the lease procurement process to push the deal towards Rovt, even though AmTrust Realty\u2019s 250 Broadway was the top pick for the lease, based on an internal scoring system.\nAn internal review by DCAS \u2014 which did not look at Hamilton\u2019s actions \u2014 determined that the agency followed proper procedures when it came to evaluating the lease possibilities. Additionally, DCAS claimed the 250 Broadway lease would\u2019ve cost a total of an additional $16 million for taxpayers and said Department of the Aging officials preferred 14 Wall.\nRovt donated $9,200 to Adams\u2019 mayoral and Brooklyn borough president campaigns and a further $5,000 for his legal defense fund. His wife and son have also made donations to the mayor.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Compass\u2019 plan to acquire Anywhere Real Estate for $1.6 billion would further consolidate the brokerages\u2019 dominance in South Florida, where brands carry significant weight.\nCompass, already a Goliath in residential real estate, will have more than 340,000 agents under its banner, representing about 20 percent of all Realtors in the country, if the\nacquisition\nis completed in the second half of next year. Still, Compass won\u2019t control the majority of the market nationwide.\nYet, an analysis by\nThe Real Deal\nshows the deal would cement the new Compass-owned company\u2019s position as the top brokerage in Miami-Dade County. Combined, Compass and Anywhere\u2019s brands closed $9.5 billion in on-market sales in Miami-Dade County in the 12 months ended in August,\nTRD\nresearch shows.\nCompass, led by CEO Robert Reffkin, will control five of the top 10 performing brokerages in Miami-Dade. In addition to its own brand and Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, which it bought last year in a\n$444 million\npurchase of @properties, the brokerage will own the legacy brands that include Coldwell Banker, the Corcoran Group, Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, Century 21, Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate and ERA.\nThough the Anywhere brands will stay intact, Compass will absorb its fiercest competition in Miami-Dade: Coldwell Banker. With that comes the\nJills Zeder Group\n, led by Jill Eber, Jill Hertzberg and Judy Zeder, which consistently ranks as the top agent team in the U.S. Last year, the Jills Zeder Group ranked first with $923 million in on-market sales, according to\nTRD research\n.\nAmong other top agents that will come under the new company\u2019s umbrella are Corcoran\u2019s Julian Johnston, Mick Duchon and Eloy Carmenate.\nCompass and Anywhere agents represent about half of the top 25 agents in Miami-Dade, as determined by on-market sales volume in the 12 months ended in August. The agents\u2019 combined dollar volume totaled $3.4 billion in on-market sales, according to\nTRD\nresearch.\nTime will tell how the acquisition will affect recruiting, but it could drive away agents who are looking for a more personalized firm, some brokers say.\n\n\u201cYou now have homogenized a bunch of brands under one brand,\u201d said Mercedes Saewitz, senior vice president of operations at Aperture Global Real Estate, a Florida-based national brokerage firm. \u201cYou are sort of losing the identity of it.\u201d\nIt\u2019s still early, Saewitz said.\n\u201cPeople are digesting it, [but] there\u2019s no rush of the gates. They\u2019re not slated to close on this until Q2 2026,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m interested in seeing what the movement is from those brands into Compass.\u201d\nThe deal will mark the latest chapter in the industry\u2019s history of increased consolidation, as profit margins continue to shrink.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a high volume, low profit business,\u201d said Mike Pappas, CEO of the Keyes Company, the largest independent brokerage firm in Florida. \u201cUnless they\u2019re going to transform the commission structure in their business, we don\u2019t see how it\u2019s going to be anything different than it\u2019s historically been.\u201d\nCompetitors\n, including smaller brokerages and local heavyweights, have already claimed the news as a win. Pappas sees opportunities to pick up people and office space post-merger, as the new Compass entity looks to cut $250 million in efficiencies.\nSaewitz, who left Compass at the end of last year, said she always expected the brokerage would make a major acquisition, but not this big. \u201cThey just proved to the world that consolidation is the new normal for our industry,\u201d she said.\nSheridan Wall contributed reporting.\n",

At the same time, the popular Los Angeles neighborhood \u201ccontinues to experience low vacancy and attractive rent growth,\u201d Westerberg added.\nBroadstone Los Feliz has a mix of studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments with access to a rooftop lounge, barbecue area, indoor swimming pool and spa, fitness center and electric vehicle charging stations. The property, at 1800 North New Hampshire Avenue, includes a total of 134 units. The outdoor lounge area offers unobstructed views of the Griffith Observatory and the Hollywood Sign, according to the Times.\nThe joint venture between Alliance and PCCP acquired the property in 2022 and has invested more than $1 million since then to revamp the common areas and upgrade the interiors of 33 units with hardwood flooring, quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances and new woodgrain cabinets. In total, two-thirds of the units have been renovated; the remaining ones will be renovated within the next two years, according to the Times. At the time of loan closing, the property was 95 percent occupied.\n\nMesa West has swooped in with eight-figure loans to various residential and commercial ventures in Southern California in recent months.\nEarlier this month, Mesa West\nprovided a $68.5 million acquisition loan\nto Legacy Partners for an apartment community in Azusa. Legacy Partners bought the vacant apartments at 801 East Alosta Avenue from Azusa Pacific University for a total of $91.8 million.\nIn July, Mesa West\nlent $55 million to an affiliate of Seaview Investors\nfor the Burton House Beverly Hills hotel.

        "content": "Sergio Pino\u2019s widow, Tatiana, and their daughters filed a new lawsuit against Pino\u2019s longtime mistress and others they claim were involved in allegedly fraudulent transfers in the days before and after his suicide.\nSergio Pino\n, a prominent South Florida homebuilder, died in July 2024 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound as FBI agents were closing in on raiding his waterfront Coral Gables home and arresting him over allegations he attempted to murder his wife through poisoning and the hiring of hitmen.\nPino founded Coral Gables-based Century Homebuilders Group, one of the biggest Hispanic-owned homebuilders nationwide. He and\nTatiana\nPino were in the midst of a highly contentious divorce when he died.\nHis death\nsparked a fight\nover the future of Century Homebuilders. Pino had a longtime girlfriend, Nancy Pastor, whom he had started dating in the early 2000s, according to court filings.\nPastor\u2019s involvement at Century Midtown in\nDoral\nis at the center of this latest lawsuit. Tatiana Pino, Century Homebuilders (which Tatiana Pino now leads as president), Century Real Estate Fund GP, and the former couple\u2019s daughters, Alessandra and Carolina Pino, sued Pastor, Century Midtown Club and Fitness Center LLC, attorney Eugenio Duarte and Century\u2019s former CFO Joseline Pereira last week in Miami-Dade Circuit Court.\nThe lawsuit focuses on trust and lease documents created or amended by Duarte in March and July of last year related to Century Midtown, a mixed-use development with condos, apartments and a clubhouse.\n\u201cIn July 2024 as Sergio Pino\u2019s multi-year efforts to kill Tatiana, his joint partner/owner by the entireties of CHG, failed, and with the FBI and the police closing in, certain documents related to the collateralized clubhouse were purportedly executed by Sergio without the consent of the bank, his project partners, Tatiana, or those he sought to transfer control to all of his interests in Century Fitness and the Clubhouse, among other things,\u201d the complaint states.\nThe documents include a 99-year lease and two trusts, which Tatiana Pino and her daughters allege are likely invalid and were meant to benefit Pastor, according to the complaint.\n\u201cThese efforts were criminal, fraudulent, intentional and otherwise wrongful,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\nPastor\u2019s attorney, Michael Schlesinger, said in a statement to\nThe Real Deal\nthat Pastor did not receive any copies of the trusts until after Pino\u2019s death. Schlesinger wrote that Pastor\u2019s \u201csuccessful efforts in the sales and management of Sergio Pino projects led to Mr. Pino and his companies profiting by millions\u201d and that she was put in management positions because of her experience.\n\u201cTo set the record straight, for over the past decade that Ms. Pastor was affiliated with Mr. Pino\u2019s businesses and ventures, she never witnessed Ms. [Tatiana] Pino involved in any business transaction until she took over after his untimely death,\u201d he said. \u201cMs. Pastor has never done anything illegal and has always been ethical and transparent in all Estate matters.\u201d\nThe trust signed and dated March 11, 2024 has metadata that demonstrates it was actually created and sent on March 13, 2024. Tatiana and her daughters allege the March 11 date is not a coincidence. It\u2019s about the time when Sergio learned the Feds were onto his alleged plot to have Tatiana Pino killed. It\u2019s when one of the hitmen, Bayron Bennett, had his court hearing following his arrest.\nThe second trust was dated July 15, 2024, one day before Sergio\u2019s death.\nPereira, Century Homebuilders\u2019 former CFO, directed Duarte to prepare the 99-year lease of the clubhouse at Century Midtown. In an email included in the complaint, Duarte expressed his concerns over a transfer.\n\u201cEach transfer, assignment, appointment, etc., can potentially alter the relationship with third parties (or even require the consent of third parties) and we have to be careful not to make any decisions in haste without considering all the possible consequences with Century\u2019s relationship with others,\u201d Duarte wrote. \u201cAll changes should be made considering the ultimate purpose, consequence, and need for each change. I do not want to question any decisions, but I am concerned that some of these changes are not needed, and in fact they may bring detrimental consequences.\u201d\nDuarte did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe ownership of the Century Midtown property at 2038, 8075 and 8175 Northwest 107th Avenue is creating issues for the sale or refinancing of Century Town Center, the lawsuit alleges.\nCBRE was hired to secure lenders or potential buyers for the property. But it has not been able to obtain a refinancing because third party lenders \u201cdetermined that the existing partners would not be acceptable guarantors,\u201d which means that Century Midtown would have to be sold or recapitalized with a new partner, according to the complaint.\n",

        "content": "Compass\u2019 intention to\nacquire Anywhere Real Estate\nsent shockwaves through the industry this week, and it solidified Compass as the Goliath of Chicago\u2019s real estate market.\nThe $1.6 billion all-stock merger will combine two national real estate powerhouses and bring Anywhere\u2019s brands \u2014 including Coldwell Banker, Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, Century 21 and Corcoran Group \u2014 under Compass\u2019 ownership.\nThe deal represents a significant boost in market share for Compass and affiliated brands, which will be especially pronounced in Chicago, since Compass grabbed a huge share of the market with its purchase of\n@properties and Christie\u2019s International Real Estate\nlast year.\nBrands that would be affiliated with Compass after the merger accounted for nearly $18 billion in sales in Chicago last year, according to\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nranking of\nChicago\u2019s top brokerages\n. The rest of the top 20 brokerages amounted to $11.33 billion in sales.\nMany brokerages under Anywhere\u2019s brands are franchise-based, though, so Compass won\u2019t be directly owning those brokerages. Franchised brokerages are owned independently and pay fees for access to technology, marketing and other support.\nOne example is Chicago\u2019s Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. The luxury-focused franchise made $1.53 billion in sales last year across 1,977 transactions, according to the\nTRD\nranking. Linda Levin, a Jameson Sotheby\u2019s broker, said she expects business as usual once her brokerage comes under the Compass umbrella.\n\u201cOur brand holds its own,\u201d Levin said. \u201cFrom what I understand, our world at Jameson Sotheby\u2019s is going to stay primarily the same.\u201d\nMark Ahmad, a broker with Century 21 Circle, a Century 21 franchise, said he doesn\u2019t expect anything to change in his day-to-day once his franchise comes under Compass. He said his brokerage has changed hands before \u2014 first it was under Coldwell Banker, then Century 21 \u2014 and he has learned not to worry because he hasn\u2019t seen it affect his business.\nBut locally based brokerages see a chance to distinguish themselves in a more consolidated industry.\nSteve Baird, CEO and president of Baird &amp; Warner, said the merger strengthens his firm\u2019s position as a local, independent brokerage in an increasingly national and centralized industry. Baird &amp; Warner \u2014 which has been family owned since its inception in the 1850s \u2014\nbought Dream Town earlier this year\n. The firms made a combined $3.53 billion in Cook County sales last year and $6.7 billion in sales overall.\n\nBaird also said he expects some agents will leave the firms Compass picked up, and Baird &amp; Warner will be an attractive option for them.\n\u201cI think it only helps us. It\u2019s only a positive thing,\u201d Baird said. \u201cBecause it creates disruption in the marketplace. It also shows the people that work at that company that the main interest is in profit, and not in what\u2019s good for the agents or good for customers.\u201d\nBaird called the move a \u201cWall Street play\u201d and said it follows Compass\u2019 path of chasing growth through acquisitions, but he questioned whether it would help Compass turn profits.\n\u201cThey keep buying other companies. Great for them, but I don\u2019t quite know how that works. I run a company where it\u2019s important to make money and be successful.\u201d Baird said. \u201cThey\u2019re playing more to the investors than they are about the future potential of all this.\u201d\nReffkin said in the Monday call the merger will allow the company to cut costs by streamlining operations between the two companies, and that income streams from Anywhere\u2019s title, escrow and relocation businesses will help diversify cash flow.\nMatt Laricy, managing broker at Americorp, was shocked by the news and equated it to Pepsi buying Coca-Cola or McDonald\u2019s buying Burger King. In the long term, he said, Compass\u2019 growth could crucially alter the industry \u2014 including how listings are distributed to other brokerages and consumers, which has become increasingly controversial as Compass has taken aim at rules upheld by multiple listing services and the National Association of Realtors limiting some of the brokerage\u2019s preferred marketing techniques.\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t want an MLS, they don\u2019t have to have an MLS,\u201d Laricy said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t want NAR, they don\u2019t have to have NAR. If they want to keep all listings private, they can keep all listings private. Who\u2019s going to stop them?\u201d\nCompass has fought with the National Association of Realtors, multiple listing services and Zillow\nover public listing mandates like Clear Cooperation Policy\nand has pushed a marketing strategy that features some houses starting as exclusive listings marketed only to Compass agents.\u00a0 Reffkin has argued that listing service rules limit choices for sellers and agents and use agents\u2019 products without compensation.\nWhen asked for comment on the merger, a spokesperson for NAR said the trade organization \u201cdoes not comment on the business models of industry participants.\u201d\nLaricy said he sees potential as an independent broker to find success among the bigger players in the industry. Agents who don\u2019t want to be connected to a big corporation will be more motivated to look to a small firm to work with, he said.\n\u201cYou can be a lot more nimble. You can be a lot more creative,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can be a lot more innovative, because you don\u2019t have to go through all those steps. For independents, that\u2019s where you can take advantage of it.\u201d",

The reports of jilted customers prompted letters to the bankruptcy judge, requesting an emergency hearing due to potential consumer harm.\nCloudbeds, an online booking platform, wrote to the bankruptcy judge that it had reason to believe at least one of LuxUrban\u2019s four hotels closed, but LuxUrban had not updated the status of the property with the platform.\nAn attorney for the Department of Justice also wrote a letter to the bankruptcy judge, expressing concerns regarding wages and consumer protections. Workers reportedly walked off the job where they weren\u2019t receiving pay.\nThe trustee letter came the same day the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council alleged LuxUrban owed weeks of wages to unionized workers and managers. The union also alleged the company was illegally withholding at least $57 million in retirement contributions.\nThe New York Fire Department ordered LuxUrban to vacate one of its properties, but despite a safety complaint, it hasn\u2019t enforced any orders and has not uncovered any violations.\nThe bankruptcy judge scheduled a virtual conference to respond to the various claims.\n\nLeo Jacobs, who is the lead restructuring counsel for LuxUrban, declined to comment to Bisnow.\nLuxUrban filed for bankruptcy protection less than two weeks ago, citing more than $15 million in secured debts and $22 million in unsecured claims. The company claimed less than $10 million in assets.\nLuxUrban\u2019s issues, especially in New York City, are well-known. At the 166-key property known as The Herald, LuxUrban allegedly\nracked up at least $1.6 million in arrears\nthrough December, leading a judge to approve the landlord\u2019s eviction request this summer as ownership tries to fend off foreclosure.\nOther\nissues\nrange from\na $1.2 million city fine\nover illegal Airbnb rentals to a Nasdaq delisting. The company\u2019s been accused of overstating its hotel holdings and is facing a shareholder class action lawsuit.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A suburb south of Chicago is putting pressure on single-family landlords with vacant properties to sell by extending a moratorium on home rentals.\nMarkham added a year to its single-family rental ban by unanimous vote from the city council last week, CBS News\nreported\n.\nA test run of the moratorium launched in December and was set to end this month. The extension bans new single-family leases in the city limits. Landlords renting homes prior to the moratorium can still renew tenant leases.\nMayor Roger Agpawa wants\nsingle-family home\nrental rates to drop from 19 percent of all homes in Markham down to 10 percent. The hope is that owners will renovate and place the homes on the market.\nCity leaders view the initiative as a way to improve the \u201ctransient\u201d portion of the housing market, reducing high turnover and vacancy.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of long-term renters here,\u201d Agpawa said. \u201cWell, stay here, and this will never affect you.\u201d\n\nIllinois Realtors lobbied to stop the moratorium extension, arguing the policy infringes on property rights and prevents south suburban Chicago residents from accessing affordable housing.\n\u201cMany people can\u2019t get a\nmortgage\n, but they\u2019re still able to pay\nrent\n, so this is preventing people from accessing housing they can afford in communities they want to live in,\u201d said Nora Gruenberg, government affairs director for Illinois Realtors.\nThe home ownership rate in Markham is higher than all of Cook County and Illinois, at about 72 percent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, whose five-year estimate clocks the town\u2019s population at 11,434 and\nmore than 70 percent\nBlack.\nAgpawa and other city officials argued the number of rentals increasing in the area puts a squeeze on fire, police and other city services. For now, residents and city officials will find out if the rental freeze brings in new homeowners or creates more vacant homes.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The fallout of Bernie Madoff\u2019s infamous Ponzi scheme is still wreaking havoc on lives as the estate\u2019s trustee takes aim at a swanky Greenwich Village condo owned by a New York power couple.\nIrving Picard, the lawyer who\u2019s already clawed back nearly $15 billion for Madoff\u2019s defrauded investors, is pressing attorney Malcolm Sage and his wife, cosmetics executive Lynne Florio, to surrender two of the three units they combined decades ago at 45 Christopher Street, the New York Post\nreported\n.\nA court found in 2022 that Sage was among the rare \u201cnet winners\u201d from Madoff\u2019s $65 billion fraud, pocketing $16.9 million more than he invested.\nPicard argues that since the apartments were never legally merged, he can seize the 1,210- and 902-square-foot units, which he values at a combined $4.6 million. That would leave Sage and Florio in a 930-square-foot one-bedroom unit, a far cry from the 3,000-square-foot spread they\u2019ve enjoyed for decades in one of the Village\u2019s most coveted Art Deco buildings.\n\nThe couple, who once moved in New York\u2019s social circuit and were fixtures at galas, are now fighting the case without legal counsel. They insist the units can\u2019t be physically divided and accuse Picard of misleading the judge, calling the clawback \u201ca fraud on the court.\u201d Picard\u2019s team countered that New Yorkers combine and separate apartments all the time and that Sage\u2019s holdings are the only viable way to enforce the judgment.\nThe push underscores how far Picard is still going, 17 years after Madoff\u2019s fund imploded, to recover money for thousands of victims, including celebrities, sports stars and major institutions. Sage\u2019s siblings have already quietly settled similar clawback claims. Sage and Florio are not accused of criminal wrongdoing or possessing knowledge of Madoff\u2019s Ponzi scheme.\nIt\u2019s another reminder that Manhattan luxury property is still feeling the effects of the Madoff fallout.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The city-owned parking lots are on Oak Grove Avenue between University Drive and El Camino Real.\nThe plan would convert three parking lots in downtown\nMenlo Park\ninto\naffordable housing\nbuildings. Interested developers must submit development proposals that would help the city create at least 345 residential units for extremely low to low-income households, which in San Mateo County is between $40,600 and $108,300 annually for a single person.\nSo far, Menlo Park officials have approved Alliant Communities, MidPen Housing, Presidio Bay Ventures and a joint venture between Related Companies and Alta Housing to each submit one proposal. Other developers can throw their hats into the ring.\nThe idea of developing apartments above parking garages drew backlash from local business owners, who opposed replacing surface parking lots their customers use.\n\nPro-business group Save Downtown Menlo\nopposed the plan\n, collecting signatures and raising legal fees to block the parking lot redevelopment. More than 115 businesses signed an online plea to the city to prevent the endeavor from proceeding.\nThe redevelopment plan was the last straw for one business owner, Save Downtown Menlo organizer Kevin Cunningham\ntold\nthe Mercury News.\n\u201cHe said he didn\u2019t even want to see how this plays out and is just so frustrated with doing business downtown that the decision to pursue these lots was the tipping point,\u201d Cunningham said.\nMenlo Park isn\u2019t the only city in the Bay Area to consider erecting housing-over-parking developments; Palo Alto and\nLos Altos\nare exploring similar options to turn parking into housing, according to the Business Journal.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

Tai Architecture created the approved design.\nThe eight-story project, at 1907-1933 Wilshire Boulevard, will have 26\naffordable housing\nunits, about 21,500 square feet of ground-floor retail, and four levels of subterranean parking.

The proposal also features more open courtyards and increased natural light access throughout the building.\nThere\u2019s still more work for the developer, however, as the approval came with numerous conditions that must be addressed before construction can begin. The developer is required to find an alternative support system for a large architectural frame, increase the number of sun-shade fins on the building\u2019s exterior, and plan to plant bigger trees in the second-floor courtyard than was proposed, as well as tweak some balcony proportions and how metal panels will wrap around corners of the building.\nThe project must still go through final plan review and building permit approval before shovels can hit dirt.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Depper ran Dutch Girl Cleaners at 2094 Mount Diablo Boulevard for more than two decades before retiring and selling the business while remaining its landlord.\nThe development comes on the back of the city\u2019s West Downtown Specific Plan, which rezoned the site in 2018 from commercial to mixed-use residential and commercial use, according to the Business Times. Depper applied to build on the site using SB 330 to secure streamlined approvals and a 50 percent density bonus, committing to eight very-low-income units. In Contra Costa County, very-low-income for one person is\ndefined\nas making less than $55,950 annually.\nWalnut Creek\n\u2019s\nHousing Element\ncalled out the location as a potential site for development as the city works to meet its state-mandated\nhousing construction\ngoals, according to the Business Times. Under the Housing Element, the city must prepare to build 5,805 new units of housing \u2014 including 3,501 affordable homes \u2014 by 2031.\n\n\u201cI have four daughters, I know how important it is to young people that they have day cares they rely on,\u201d Depper told the Business Times of his\namenity\nplans for the mixed-use site. \u201cI think it\u2019s something we should do if we\u2019re building for residential.\u201d\nEarlier this year, Depper filed a complaint against the owners of the Speedway Express gas station next door, claiming that emissions from the fuel site could threaten any development at the Dutch Girl site. The regional board declared the location safe to build on, though Depper believes the construction process will\nreveal toxic soil\nthat would be a costly and time-consuming headache to clean up, according to the Business Times.\nThe local\nfire department\nis reviewing the project plans after residents raised concerns about fire access on the sliver of commercial property. Depper will reportedly have to wait for a thumbs-up from the fire department before seeking final approvals from the city\u2019s Planning Commission for final approvals.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A CMBS loan tied to apartments in Austin was transferred to special servicing in fallout from Texas\u2019 House Bill 21.\nThe $60 million loan backed by Langdon at Walnut Park was flagged after borrower Langdon Street Capital didn\u2019t make the required principal paydown. The Beverly Hills, California-based firm previously agreed to pay down the loan to a debt service coverage ratio of 1.28 if the affordable housing property tax exemption wasn\u2019t granted by Aug. 29, but did not make the payment after failing to get the exemption. The firm lost its exemption after the passage of HB 21, which took aim at a loophole in an affordable housing law, which Langdon used to acquire the property.\nThe property was valued at $90.1 million, assuming the exemption. Without the exemption, the property is valued at $67.1 million.\nLangdon Street Capital used what\u2019s known as the \u201ctraveling\u201d housing finance corporation loophole to get tax credits on the property. The loophole allows multifamily operators to get property tax exemptions by partnering with far-flung affordable housing organizations, thus removing properties in major Texas metros off the tax rolls without the approval of local municipalities.\nThe firm, which was founded by Adam Daneshgar, purchased the property at 12101 N. Lamar Boulevard in 2021, did a sale-leaseback of the property with Pleasanton Housing Finance Corporation, an affordable housing organization more than 100 miles from Austin. The property reserves some units for people whose household income is less than $78,640.\nDaneshgar didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nHouse Bill 21, which was authored by Houston multifamily operator Rep. Gary Gates,\ntook aim at these deals\nby requiring that apartment owners partner with organizations in the same jurisdiction. It also created additional affordability requirements.\nBut the law also gives prior deals, including those that used the loophole, until 2027 to come into compliance with new requirements. In this case and others, appraisal districts appear to be exercising their own interpretation and denying property tax exemptions for these deals now.\n\nGates said some appraisal districts filed temporary restraining orders against the organizations often used in traveling HFC deals, including Pleasanton, but Travis Central Appraisal District didn\u2019t take that route.\nWhen asked if the district was denying exemptions for deals that used the loophole, chief strategy officer Cynthia Martinez only said property owners \u201cmust submit an application and meet the requirements outlined by Chapter 394 of the Local Government Code\u201d to receive the exemption.\nThat\u2019s the crux of a\nlawsuit challenging HB 21\n, filed by the Texas Workforce Housing Commission and the ground lease tenant of Willowbend Apartments in San Antonio. The apartment complex is a traveling housing finance corporation deal where Los Angeles-based Post Investment Group partnered with a housing finance corporation in Brownsville.\nThe lawsuit claims the passage of HB 21 has emboldened appraisal districts to go after the properties that used this loophole by denying their exemptions before the new law goes into effect in 2027, putting 2025 and 2026 exemptions \u201cin jeopardy.\u201d Specifically, the Bexar Appraisal District required Post Investment Group to submit a renewal request to maintain its exemption and has, so far, failed to make a determination.\n\u201cI could see where an appraisal district would take the position: we think your deal is a scam, and we\u2019re not going to give a tax exemption until you have a court determine that it\u2019s a valid HFC,\u201d Gates said.\n\u201cI think they have every right to deny it.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Believing she couldn\u2019t afford Manhattan, Ayana Green was house hunting in Queens when she saw a StreetEasy listing for an East Harlem co-op. At $450,000, it was one-third of Manhattan\u2019s median home price.\nBetter yet, it was a two-bedroom with maintenance charges of only $585 a month. She saw the apartment and made an offer.\nOne thing seemed odd, though. The seller\u2019s broker urged her to use Midtown-based mortgage provider GuardHill Financial.\n\u201cI was told during the showing that they had a heavy preference for GuardHill,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t go through GuardHill, there was another process and it would take a lot longer, and you would forfeit a portion of the down payment if the loan didn\u2019t come through.\u201d\nGreen went with GuardHill.\nShe closed on the apartment last year, at 123-25 East 102nd Street, but the experience gave her pause. Green and other new shareholders grew suspicious when the co-op board was unable to immediately provide documents they requested to file tax returns and were rebuffed upon asking when the annual shareholder meeting would be.\nThe building\u2019s issues, it turned out, ran a lot deeper.\nBuyers at the affordable co-op, classified as a Housing Development Fund Corporation, cannot have high incomes and shareholders\u2019 units must be their primary residence, according to city rules.\nYet some shareholders of the 95-year-old East Harlem building owned multiple units or had never lived there. One owned seven of the 31 apartments at the same time \u2014\u00a0and didn\u2019t reside in any. Another owned four.\nOther shareholders seem to have exploited the HDFC co-op for financial gain, and in recent years, $800,000 had been drained from the co-op\u2019s account, bank records show.\nGreen and other skeptical shareholders requested help from a nonprofit for homeowners, which found red flags about how the co-op operated and referred them to a lawyer.\nWhen the co-op\u2019s leadership kept control of the board in a contested election last December, 13 dissident shareholders sued. Their attorney soon unearthed a convoluted history of insider deals that ran afoul of the building\u2019s rules and its legally mandated mission to provide affordable homeownership.\nGood intentions\nThe story of 123-25 East 102nd Street is, in part, about how lack of oversight and increasing property values in New York City can turn even highly regulated housing into a cash cow.\nHDFCs are co-ops\nlegally designated\nto house low-income people. During New York\u2019s dark years, the city created more than a thousand of them from tax-delinquent rental buildings whose owners had walked away.\nThey tended to be in areas that were struggling, and their apartments were nearly worthless. Today, though, they are in demand. However, because of affordability rules, shareholders of HDFC co-ops cannot simply rent or sell units to the highest bidder.\n\u201cNobody ever thought that somebody would offer them $500,000 for their apartments,\u201d said Oscar McDonald of the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board, which monitors and assists HDFCs. \u201cThese neighborhoods have changed. It tests people\u2019s honesty and integrity.\u201d\nAfter seizing 123-25 East 102nd Street for unpaid property taxes, the city converted the 1930-built rental to a co-op and sold it to the tenants in 2001 for $250 per unit.\nLately, the apartments have fetched up to $499,000, although sale prices are limited by the fact that buyers cannot earn more than 165 percent of the area median income.\nThis form of housing and ownership is specifically designed for owner occupancy.\nScott Kinder, absentee owner, in 2017\nIf their incomes increase after buying, they can stay, but the unit must remain their primary residence \u2014 occupied by the shareholder at least 183 days a year, or 275 days in newer HDFCs. Sublet rents are capped at 110 percent of the maintenance fee.\nThe restrictions aim to prevent units from being treated as investment properties. For that reason, HDFCs present a rare opportunity for working-class New Yorkers to buy a quality, affordable home. It\u2019s a goal that elected officials have increasingly endorsed as the city\u2019s housing crisis has worsened.\nThe vast majority of the city\u2019s approximately 1,300 HDFCs are well run and follow the rules, McDonald said. However, HDFCs lacking regulatory agreements with the city, such as 123-25 East 102nd Street, have no regular oversight. They are essentially self-policing.\nIt is a responsibility that the East Harlem co-op board, by routinely granting exceptions, appeared to purposefully ignore.\n\u201cLiberal subletting\u201d\nThe broker who sold Green her unit, Scott Kinder, had warned the co-op about its rule-bending when the board asked him in 2017 to handle sales. Kinder even foresaw the shareholder revolt now underway.\n\u201cThis form of housing and ownership is specifically designed for owner occupancy,\u201d he emailed the board president and her husband at the time.\n\u201cIn the current market, new shareholders can be expected to demonstrate more control and concern,\u201d he predicted. \u201cLikewise, to satisfy some of those concerns, the coop is going to have to tighten up and/or eliminate its current liberal subletting policy.\u201d\nThe city\u2019s\nHDFC website\nis clear: \u201cIn general, short-term subletting with Board of Directors\u2019 permission is acceptable where the shareholder intends to return to the apartment, but long-term sublets are not permissible.\u201d\nNew shareholders at East 102nd Street were informed of this, yet long-term subletting continued for the insiders, as did apartment hoarding and other curious \u2014 and lucrative \u2014 arrangements. The mutual backscratching may have been so rampant that for years no shareholders raised a fuss, as they were also benefiting from the permissive policies.\nKinder himself was purportedly an absentee owner when he wrote that 2017 message and remains one today. His five-year contract as exclusive sales broker includes a $100,000 termination clause, and his pay to manage the property was recently doubled to $3,000 a month by a five-member board that included his daughter and her mother.\nThe board president has a combined unit, yet her husband owned a two-bedroom. One board member, Maxcine Holder, had four units simultaneously. Another, Nettie Elenion, had seven, and never lived in any of them.\nWeb of relationships\nAlthough the building\u2019s insiders swapped and sold apartments like baseball cards, city property records show not a single transaction between the co-op\u2019s inception in 2001 and 2019, when Marcus Cintron, the board president\u2019s son, sold a unit for $245,000.\nKeeping track of the characters and schemes at the six-story co-op requires a whiteboard, like the ones detectives use to chart connections among suspects.\nHolder, who sold 2A to Green last year, was one of the hubs. She owns Unit 3D and rents it to Charles Richardson, whose mother,\nJune Richardson\n, was the loan officer Green was steered to by Kinder.\nHolder and Kinder have two children together. Their daughter Courtney Kinder also owns a unit in the co-op, though she, like her parents and Elenion, lives in a condo at\n309 East 108th Street\n.\nMichael Zampella, whom Kinder has known for at least 15 years, picked up a unit in 2014 but has never lived in it \u2014 though he was on the board from 2022 to 2024. He owns LLCs that do business with the co-op and its shareholders.\nHolder formed\nMaxnettie LLC\n, combining her first name and Elenion\u2019s, and registered it at their East 108th Street condo. Elenion has an LLC too, named Elendil Mar, which is also the name of the\nVermont Airbnb\nshe owns. (A repeat guest named \u201cNettie\u201d posted three positive reviews.)\nThe personal and business connections may explain how the various players became shareholders in the HDFC and used it to bolster their financial and property portfolios.\nZampella, who lives in Alexandria, Virginia, and works at the Pentagon, did not disclose his businesses in an affidavit filed in response to the lawsuit. Rather, he said he was a Navy reservist when he acquired his unit in 2014 and intended to move in upon being discharged, but never was.\n\u201cWith the [co-op] board\u2019s permission, the resident living in the apartment at that time was permitted to stay and pay monthly rent and maintenance fees to the HDFC,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cI have not realized any income from apartment 6C since my purchase 11 years ago.\u201d\nZampella failed to mention his income from other units. His MZ Capital Funding LLC received $359,517 from the sale of Unit 2D and $285,000 when Holder sold 2A.\nApartments collected and traded\nUnit 2A exemplifies the HDFC\u2019s secretive wheeling and dealing. The apartment was passed around like a blunt at a frat party before being sold to the outsider Green.\nIts confusing journey began in 2007 when Ramon Ruiz, also known as Ray Cintron, somehow acquired it from original owner Matilda Reyes. In 2020, the board, led by Ruiz\u2019s wife, Victoria Guzman, exempted Ruiz\u2019s future sale of the unit from the building\u2019s 20 percent flip tax on profits.\nBy 2023, Unit 2A had mysteriously migrated to Elenion\u2019s collection. She sold it that year for $450,000 to her condo neighbor Holder, whose daughter Courtney Kinder paid the $44,900 deposit. Courtney made out her check to \u201cNettie Elenion care of Elendil Mar LLC\u201d (the Vermont Airbnb entity) and wrote \u201cgift to Maxcine Holder\u201d in the memo section.\nA year later, Holder sold Unit 2A for the same price she had paid Elenion. The flip yielded zero profit for Holder, but records show it got her a $314,000 mortgage from GuardHill.\nKinder (who, remember, has two children with Holder) pocketed an $18,000 commission from the sale, and Holder took home $120,000. They are not presently in a relationship but remain close, Holder said in an affidavit.\nShe did not explain why Zampella received $285,000. No loan appears in city records. The 2023 sale is also missing.\nIn all, at least seven HDFC insiders touched Unit 2A: Ruiz, the president\u2019s husband; Elenion, the seven-unit and Airbnb owner; Holder; her ex Scott Kinder; their daughter Courtney; Navy reservist Zampella; and the loan broker Richardson.\n\nSystematic withdrawals\nGuzman, the board president who gave her blessing to the co-op\u2019s practices, benefited in a different way. She paid herself and her husband $100,000 over the past few years from the co-op\u2019s account, which saw its balance fall from more than $1.1 million to less than $400,000.\nGuzman received at least $70,918, and Ruiz got $29,710. Florida resident Vanessa Ramirez, the mother of their grandchildren, received $14,443, apparently to serve as an officer of the co-op.\nRamirez lives with Marcus Cintron and their kids in a home owned by Guzman and Ruiz, Marcus\u2019 parents, in Kissimmee, a thousand miles south of East Harlem.\nFormer board member Emma Rodriguez, who until recently owned Unit 2D, also worked for the co-op from her home in Florida, receiving checks totaling at least $21,200. She and Guzman co-signed the checks to themselves and others.\nAsked what duties were performed to justify the payments, plaintiff Ayana Green said, \u201cI would love to know. We have no idea.\u201d\nThe board exempted Rodriguez and Guzman\u2019s apartments, like that of Guzman\u2019s husband, from the flip tax as they got ready to cash out. Nettie Elenion\u2019s five remaining units were also exempted, as was Jaime De La Vega\u2019s Unit 2C.\nHolder was not included in the flip tax exemption, yet she was allowed to sell two units without giving the co-op a cut.\n\u201cA flip tax is very important for the ongoing successful operation of an HDFC co-op,\u201d the city\u2019s housing agency says on its website. \u201cThe HDFC co-op re-invests the flip taxes it collects into capital repairs and other building needs.\u201d\nRecords missing\nBecause of the unexplained void in ACRIS, the city\u2019s property transaction database, it is unclear how Marcus Cintron, his father and several other insiders obtained their units.\nAffidavits\nfiled by the defendants offer some clues.\nElenion said she received \u201cseveral units\u201d \u2014 seven, it appears \u2014 in 2016 as payment for a defaulted loan that she made in 2012 to an unnamed person. She said she immediately gave Scott and Courtney Kinder one unit apiece (5B and 5E).\nElenion said she let the board rent out her remaining five apartments and keep the income. She later sold three and kept two.\nIn her affidavit, Courtney Kinder did not explain why Elenion gave her an apartment worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. \u201cAt the time that she came into possession of several units in the building, a unit was transferred to me,\u201d she said.\nShe seemed resentful that the new shareholders\u2019 lawsuit questions her ownership, as it does of 10 other units.\n\u201cIt seems very late to complain about a transaction that was approved at the time,\u201d Kinder said, \u201cand long before any of the plaintiffs moved into the building.\u201d\nThe new owners don\u2019t see it that way. If past practices inappropriately enriched individuals at the expense of the co-op, current and future shareholders will have to pay higher fees to maintain the aging building.\nThey also want the HDFC to fulfill its mission of providing affordable, owner-occupied housing.\nTo that end, they are demanding 11 units be returned to the co-op to sell, or that the building be paid up to $5.5 million for them.\n\u201cWe want to be able to take the units, transact them out, provide housing for people and keep middle-income New Yorkers in New York \u2014 and refresh the building,\u201d Green said. \u201cWe want a safe, clean building where people can enjoy living.\u201d\nUgly confrontation\nTensions have been high since last fall, when several dissidents sought election to the board but lost when the old guard let absentee shareholders vote by email.\nThings got so heated that in February, Ruiz warned plaintiff Alex Loule during a profanity-laced diatribe that he would be \u201ccarried out of here.\u201d Loule\u2019s young son stood feet away, open-mouthed, as his father recorded the encounter.\nIn his affidavit, Ruiz admitted making the statement but claimed he meant Loule could be arrested for falsely reporting building conditions.\nBut Marcus Cintron, Ruiz\u2019s son, was more explicit.\nAnother video recorded by Loule shows Cintron following him outside the building and yelling, \u201cI am not making a threat. That is a fuckin\u2019 promise, you fuckin\u2019 little piece of shit. You fuck with me, I will fuckin\u2019 kill you, n\u2014\u2013. Straight up. I don\u2019t give a fuck\u2026 You want to go to the basement and fight?\u201d\nCintron explained in an affidavit that he was upset because Loule had harassed him and his father.\nDigging through documents\nThe dispute figures to be settled in a law firm conference room, not in the bowels of the East Harlem building.\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, Gregory Byrnes, has subpoenaed and sorted through thousands of pages of records like a bomb-sniffing dog. They depict, he said, an intricate social network of shareholders, relatives, friends, business partners and lovers who took advantage of the co-op.\nByrnes\u2019 clients have a long list of demands. Three will be fiercely resisted: that a receiver be appointed to run the building; that Elenion, Holder, Zampella and the Kinders give back their 11 \u201cillegally transferred\u201d units or pay the co-op for them; and that the \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars taken by current and former board members, officers and the \u2018property manager\u2019\u201d be repaid.\nThe suit also calls for:\nan audit of the building\u2019s finances, which by rule is supposed to be done annually\nrepeal of the flip tax exemption and other board resolutions passed for \u201cpersonal benefit\u201d\nenforcement of the residency rules\npayment of the defendants\u2019 maintenance arrears, and\ncancelation of Scott Kinder\u2019s management and broker agreements.\nIt is unclear how much shareholders owe in maintenance fees, which are low because the building\u2019s annual property tax is only $53,000. Records obtained by Byrnes show collection from 2020 through 2024 ranged from 44 to 65 percent.\nAccording to Guzman\u2019s affidavit, Courtney Kinder is responsible for collecting rent and maintenance and has done so \u201cwithout issue since 2022.\u201d\nGuzman also defended the decision to hire Kinder, a shareholder.\nWhile the board may have engaged in several technical violations of the bylaws, there has been no showing of actual loss or waste.\nMatthew Mehnert, attorney for the co-op\n\u201cWe were aware that there was potential for a conflict,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the board determined that it was in the HDFC\u2019s best interest to have someone with Mr. Kinder\u2019s knowledge and experience assisting with day-to-day operation of the building.\u201d\nByrnes, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer, had requested the board\u2019s files for all closings in the building but was given only those for his clients\u2019 purchases. In legal filings, the co-op said it would take time to produce the rest and claimed the unit transfers were proper.\nThe co-op\u2019s insurance provider replaced the board\u2019s initial lawyer in the case. The new legal team argues that the plaintiffs have blown minor infractions out of proportion.\nLead attorney Matthew Mehnert wrote to the presiding judge, Paul Goetz, that appointing a receiver would be drastic and unjustified. He wants the whole case dismissed.\n\u201cWhile the board may have engaged in several technical violations of the bylaws, there has been no showing of actual loss or waste,\u201d Mehnert asserted in a court filing. \u201cThere has been no showing of self-dealing or impropriety by the board.\u201d\nThe Real Deal\nemailed questions to Guzman, Ruiz, Kinder and Kinder\u2019s personal attorney, Daniel Laguardia, but received no responses.\nResidency requirements, flip taxes and limits on sublet rents and duration are found in the governing documents of HDFC co-ops, which must also abide by the state\u2019s\nBusiness Corporation Law\nand\nArticle XI\nof the Private Housing Finance Law.\n\u201cThese are highly regulated buildings,\u201d said UHAB\u2019s McDonald. \u201cThey have to be more careful than a market-rate co-op.\u201d\nByrnes has reported his findings to the Manhattan district attorney and state attorney general but does not expect either to bring a case, given their limited resources and large universe of complaints.\nHe is likely correct. By the standards of New York real estate, the co-op at 123-25 East 102nd Street is small potatoes. It involves ordinary New Yorkers and modest sums, not the kind of villains and dollar figures that make headlines.\nBut to HDFC experts like McDonald, ethical management by affordable co-ops matters.\nBeyond abiding by the law, HDFCs have a responsibility to live up to the promise of the program, he said. They were not created for people to hoard units and cut insider deals every time a unit becomes vacant.\n\u201cConflict is not always a legal conflict,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the appearance of impropriety.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Workman Real Estate Ventures bought its fourth Miami-Dade industrial property, buying a Miami facility for $16 million. But the deal was almost derailed by an aggressive foreclosure action by a lender seeking repayment of a $9.2 million mortgage debt, court records show.\nAn affiliate of Miami-based Workman, also known as WREV, led by Tyler Workman, acquired the 72,477-square-foot industrial building at 3400 Northwest 67th Street, records and real estate database Vizzda show. The buyer also obtained a $9.2 million loan from BankUnited.\nThe deal breaks down to $220 a square foot. In August, WREV dropped\n$22.7 million\nfor a three-warehouse portfolio in\nMedley\nfrom real estate investors\nScott Sime\nand Belinda Sime.\nThe seller of the Miami warehouse, an entity managed by Morty Josh Yashar in Brooklyn, paid $11.5 million for the 2.1-acre site in 2023, records show. The building was completed in 1959.\nYashar\u2019s entity financed its 2023 acquisition of the warehouse with a $9.2 million loan from NW 68th Street Holdings, an entity tracing to Basil and Wendy Beck in\nCoral Gables\n.\n\nOn June 23, NW 68th Street Holdings filed a foreclosure complaint in Miami-Dade Circuit Court against Yashar\u2019s entity, alleging it failed to make a monthly interest payment in May. Yashar\u2019s entity filed a counterclaim on Sept. 1, alleging the lender was responsible for the default over an issue with the May payment being made late.\nYashar\u2019s entity acknowledged it wired the May payment after the due date. But the counterclaim alleges that when Yashar\u2019s entity subsequently attempted to wire a $2,119 late fee into the NW 67th St. Holding\u2019s account, it was rejected by the lender\u2019s bank.\nThe counterclaim accuses the lender of \u201cbad faith actions directing its bank to put a restriction on receipt of electronic payments from\u201d Yashar\u2019s entity.\nYashar paid the late fee and June\u2019s payment, roughly $44,000, by going directly to the lender\u2019s bank and depositing a check into the lender\u2019s account, the counterclaim alleges. Yashar\u2019s entity alleges the lender filed the foreclosure complaint despite receiving the funds owed.\nYashar\u2019s entity continued to make interest-only payments in July, August and September, but the lender refused to cooperate in the pending sale to WREV by not providing a mortgage payoff estoppel letter, the counterclaim alleges.\nOn Sept. 18, NW 68th Street Holdings voluntarily dismissed the foreclosure complaint and four days later provided Yashar\u2019s entity with a satisfaction of mortgage document, records show.",

        "content": "A Central Texas town known for pine forests and barbecue is at the center of an ambitious real estate play, along with Elon Musk\u2019s latest tunneling experiment.\nBastrop officials are weighing plans for a 390-acre mixed-use development dubbed Bastrop West that would pack in a regional hospital, hotel and convention center, entertainment venues, retail and multifamily\nspace\n. Meanwhile, Musk\u2019s Boring Company, headquartered just outside city limits, is in talks with the city about digging three pedestrian tunnels to link up Bastrop\u2019s expanding trail system, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nKazem Khonshari\u2019s Palms Properties owns the mixed-use development site, spanning two parcels off Highway 21 between FM 20 and Bear Hunter Drive. Khonshari has previous projects in Bastrop and is assembling partners for components like a hotel operator and convention center developer. A master developer hasn\u2019t been chosen.\nThe project is pitched as a game-changer for the 13,000-person town 30 miles east of Austin. A domed sports facility is being discussed for the recreation parcel, while the entertainment area could attract a big-box user such as TopGolf.\nThe vision includes a 41-acre hotel and convention center site, a 25-acre medical mall anchored by a regional hospital, a 37-acre education hub, a 28-acre sports and recreation complex, 25 acres of entertainment space, nearly 100 acres of commercial parcels and 58 acres of multifamily and retail.\n\nMeanwhile, Boring Company is exploring three tunnel alignments: one from a Buc-ee\u2019s under Highway 95 to Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, another from Mayfest Park to Bastrop State Park, and a possible extension to Ferry Park along the Colorado River. If built, it would be the company\u2019s first Austin-area project.\nThe Bastrop West plan will require annexation, zoning changes and significant infrastructure financing. Developers are expected to seek a public improvement district and tax increment reinvestment zone, while the city may tap Bastrop\u2019s economic development arm and state transportation approvals for funding.\nThe project comes as Boring Company looks for momentum beyond its Las Vegas tunnel, where it has operated since 2021. The company has since\nstruggled to win\ndeals elsewhere, facing fines and stalled\nproposals\n, including in\nKyle\njust south of Austin. But its Bastrop R&amp;D campus \u2014 an 80,000-square-foot facility on 73 acres \u2014 signals Musk\u2019s tunneling outfit isn\u2019t leaving Texas anytime soon.\nElsewhere in Bastrop, a $100 million, 75-acre \u201cnon-woke\u201d film studio dubbed\nWyldwood Studios\nis in the works by actor Zachary Levi.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s not quite Park Avenue, but the Seaport\u2019s Park Row has carved out its spot as the go-to lane for big deals on the southern tip of Manhattan.\nThe latest is a contract for one of the penthouse units at 33 Park Row asking $19.5 million.\n\u201cPenthouse Three\u201d went into contract Wednesday morning for \u201cvery close to the asking price,\u201d said Compass\u2019 Huihui Geng, who brought the buyer. The deal is expected to close later this year.\nA Compass New Development Marketing team led by Leonard Steinberg and Herve Senequier has led sales since the building launched in 2020. Closings began in 2022, and only four of the building\u2019s 30 units remain unsold, according to Marketproof.\nThe unit\u2019s asking price places it neck-and-neck with the Financial District\u2019s top sale, which happened next door at 25 Park Row where a penthouse unit closed for $19.5 million in 2021.\nThat unit briefly hit the market last year asking $22 million, but was taken off this past June.\nIt\u2019s been an up-and-down several years for Fidi, which has contended with\nsignificant amounts of inventory\ncoming to the market and\ndampening values\n. But as the city navigates condo shortages in desirable neighborhoods like Tribeca and the West Village, FiDi has shown signs of life.\n\nIn August, a unit at Harry Macklowe\u2019s One Wall Street\nclosed for over $9 million\n, marking the highest condo sale in the neighborhood since October 2022.\nIn February, a penthouse at 130 William Street sold for $7.7 million, or just over $3,000 per square foot, according to public records. That unit originally sold for $7.36 million in 2021 before hitting the market again for almost $9 million in 2023.\nGeng said his client was interested in looking downtown, and found the Seaport neighborhood to be an affordable alternative to Tribeca.\nOriginally developed by Urban Muse\u2019s Glauco Lolli-Ghetti, it is the first residential property in New York City designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners\u2019 Richard Rogers. Centurion Real Estate Partners later joined the project.\nThe 5,400-square-foot unit has five bedrooms, five bathrooms and views of City Hall Park.\nThe unit, which contains twin private elevator landings, was initially conceived of as two separate duplexes on the 19th and 20th floors before being combined into one, according to documents filed with the state attorney\u2019s general office in 2021.\nThe first floor contains a spacious open-plan kitchen and great room, which feature 21-foot ceilings, floor-to-ceiling glass windows facing the park and 108-square-foot juliet balconies.\n",

But on Tuesday, the ownership entity, managed by project developer\nBrian Tuttle\n, filed a Chapter 11 petition in Miami federal bankruptcy court that temporarily halted the auction.\nThe bankruptcy filing was a direct response to mounting pressure from Mainstreet at Tuttle\u2019s largest creditor, an affiliate of\nThe Fuse Group\n, a Fort Lauderdale-based firm led by Eyal Peretz, that won a $47.4 million foreclosure judgment against the ownership entity in July, Tuttle told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nIn its lawsuit filed last year, The Fuse Group affiliate alleged Mainstreet at Tuttle defaulted on three loans totaling\n$38.4 million\n. The judgment includes interest and fees, Palm Beach County Circuit Court records show.\nThe Fuse Group backed out of an agreement with a new lender that would have resolved the debt, Tuttle said.\n\u201cWe are incredibly disappointed over the bank\u2019s actions,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get in front of it. The bank told us what they wanted \u2014 we delivered what they wanted, and then they refused to accept it.\u201d\n\nThrough its attorney, The Fuse Group affiliate declined comment.\nTuttle has not broken ground on Mainstreet at Tuttle, a planned mixed-use project with 400,000 square feet of retail, 401 apartments, a 125-key hotel, nearly 83,000 square feet of medical offices and three parking garages with 3,435 total spaces.\nMainstreet at Tuttle had lined up Atlanta-based The Ardent Companies to take over as lender, a press release states. On Sept. 16, Ardent agreed to The Fuse Group\u2019s terms that entailed $48 million to buy the loans, a $3 million non-refundable deposit, an additional 25 days of interest charges and a closing within 25 days, Mainstreet at Tuttle\u2019s ownership entity alleged.\nDespite receiving a confirmed offer from The Ardent Companies, The Fuse Group allegedly refused to honor the agreement and \u201cdeclined to accept the full cash payment\u201d on Sept. 19, the release states. As a result, according to the release, Mainstreet at Tuttle had no viable option other than filing for bankruptcy protection.\nOther projects with Tuttle Royale remain on track. Tuttle and San Antonio-based Lynd recently completed\nThe Villas at Tuttle Royale,\na 400-unit apartment complex at 11200 Nicole Drive. Tuttle has sold other portions of the master-planned community to other developers, including Coconut Grove-based Related Group, which completed a 392-unit apartment complex at 10900 and 11020 Town Circle in 2019. Two years later, Related sold it to New York-based Pantzer Properties for\n$119.4 million\n.\nRecently, FCI Residential, a subsidiary of the Fanjul family\u2019s sugar empire, started construction of a\n320-unit\napartment complex consisting of 11 three-story buildings and two two-story townhouse buildings at Tuttle Royale.",

        "content": "The Chicago Housing Authority picked another developer to take on one of the city\u2019s most storied pieces of real estate, replacing a team that collapsed under financing woes.\nEvergreen Real Estate Group and KLEO Enterprises, working as Cabrini New Vision, will lead redevelopment of a 7-acre site at Clybourn Avenue and Larrabee Street, near the footprint of the demolished Cabrini-Green towers, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n. The housing authority approved the plan last week, several months after Hunt Development Group and its partners\nabandoned\nthe deal when they couldn\u2019t secure funding, according to the CHA.\nThe property, at 1450 North Larrabee Street, is a wedge-shaped parcel once home to Near North High School, which closed in 2001 and was demolished last year. The last Cabrini-Green high-rise came down in 2011, clearing the way for a redevelopment process that has sputtered for more than a decade.\nThe location is slated for mixed-income housing, with at least 180 CHA-subsidized units under a long-term lease. The previous team\nproposed\n750 units, then pivoted to a 480-unit mid-rise plan, but failed to\nsecure financing\n.\nKLEO founder\nTorrey Barrett\nwas previously part of Imagine Development, a partner on Hunt\u2019s failed bid. Imagine has since dissolved, but Barrett said the Cabrini opportunity pushed him to team up again, this time with Evergreen. The duo recently completed the Auburn Gresham Apartments on the South Side, turning city-owned land into affordable housing.\n\nEvergreen, which has built CHA-backed projects across Chicago for more than a decade, is making its first foray into redeveloping a former public housing site. Director of Development David Block said the team intentionally structured a different proposal from Hunt\u2019s, mindful of interest rate volatility and shifting construction costs that have tripped up recent projects.\nThe plan calls for roughly 450 rental apartments spread across four buildings, with 180 units subsidized by the CHA, plus another 75 condos and townhomes. Market-rate housing makes up a larger share than Hunt\u2019s proposal, which Block said is a reflection of Chicago\u2019s resilient rental market compared to overheated boomtowns like Austin.\nFinancing is the central hurdle. Evergreen and KLEO expect to layer low-income housing tax credits, tax-increment financing, grants and other subsidies to make the project feasible. The developers are also eyeing ways to expand the number of for-sale townhomes on site.\nThe project would mark the most significant addition of housing at the Cabrini-Green site since the CHA began demolishing the infamous towers more than 20 years ago.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has had his hands full this offseason: an investigation into tampering claims made against the Los Angeles Clippers and their star forward Kawhi Leonard, multiple star players recovering from devastating injuries heading into the season and, apparently, shopping his Upper West Side apartment.\nAt least he can check the apartment off his list.\nSilver sold his three-bedroom spread at The Beresford, a co-op building at 211 Central Park West, for $8.5 million in an off-market deal, according to public records.\nThe buyer, Louise Riggio, is the widow of Barnes &amp; Noble founder Leonard Riggio, who passed away last year. She told the New York Times in February\nshe was looking to downsize\nboth her Park Avenue apartment and her art collection, which she sold for over $270 million in an auction held by Christie\u2019s earlier this year.\n\nSilver paid $6.8 million for the unit in 2012 before transferring it into a trust in 2017, according to public records. (Evidence of Silver\u2019s purchase may be hard to find because Jared Kushner ordered the\noriginal scoop from the New York Observer\ntaken down while he was running the outlet in 2012.)\nIt\u2019s not clear where Silver is off to next, but the NBA headquarters will be staying put for at least another 10 years \u2014 the organization\nextended its lease at 645 Madison Avenue\n, also known as Olympia Tower, through 2035 back in 2016.\nDesigned by Emery Roth in 1929, the 20-story co-op has\nhoused a number of well-known names\nover the years. Actor Jerry Seinfeld, actress Glenn Close, singer Diana Ross and Fox News host turned Trump family insider Kimberly Guilfoyle have all been buyers in the building.\nIn August, billionaire\nBill Ackman sold unit 8F\nat the building for $9.4 million, down from the $13.5 million he paid for it in 2017. Ackman still has the unit next door, although it\u2019s on the market for $8.25 million.\n",

If a landlord does not give sufficient advanced notice of a rent increase or termination of a tenancy, they must pay relocation costs to the tenants.\nDetails of the ordinance were still being amended shortly before the meeting but were not discussed at length during the meeting.\nThe landlord requirements will apply to a pilot area of the South Shore and are likely to become a sticking point for real estate groups.\nOther provisions in the ordinance increase funding for existing programs like long term homeowner home improvement grants, rental assistance, property tax debt relief and programs aimed at reducing costs of rehabilitating residential properties.\nAmong those are funding set aside to create a Preservation of Existing Affordable Rentals program that will help developers purchase or refinance multifamily properties used for affordable housing, and funding set aside for rehabilitation of vacant homes to buyers under certain income restrictions.\nThe proposal by 5th Ward Alderman Desmon Yancy passed the housing committee unanimously despite prior attempts to pass a similar measure stalling for nearly two years.\nAldermen expressed support for the measure, citing the impending opening of the Obama Presidential Library as a harbinger of change.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t keep our eye on the South Shore, we will lose it,\u201d 4th Ward Alderman Lamont Robinson said. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t keep our eye on Bronzeville, we will lose it.\u201d",

        "content": "Eli Lilly is planting a flag in Houston with a $6.5 billion biomanufacturing complex, the biggest biotech investment in Texas history and one of the largest single corporate projects ever in the region, fueled by a weightloss drug.\nThe global drugmaker will build a 236-acre facility in Generation Park, a master-planned business hub off Beltway 8 near George Bush Intercontinental Airport, the Houston Chronicle\nreported\n. The project will create 4,000 construction jobs and 615 permanent roles, ranging from lab technicians to engineers, with average pay topping $100,000.\nLilly\nacquired the land\nwithin the last month and is already moving dirt. McCord Development, which is steering\nGeneration Park\n, will invest $100 million in infrastructure upgrades, while Lilly will handle the buildings.\nThe state sweetened the deal with $146 million in incentives, plus $5.5 million from the Texas Enterprise Fund. Gov. Greg Abbott compared the project to Tesla\u2019s speedy Gigafactory build in Austin, vowing Texas regulators will cut red tape to fast-track Lilly\u2019s plans. Local rebates and abatements from the Generation Park Management District are also expected.\nThe development cements Houston\u2019s bid to be a national biomanufacturing hub with innovations in the booming weight-loss drug market. Lilly hopes the site will eventually churn out Orforglipron, an experimental oral version of the wildly popular GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy. If approved, the pill could become a blockbuster by offering patients an alternative to injections. Lilly already manufactures the GLP-1 tirzepatide brands Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a hurry here,\u201d CEO David Ricks told the outlet, noting the company wants foundations and steel rising by 2027. \u201cIf the FDA approves, we\u2019ll be on the clock to ramp this up quickly.\u201d\nBeyond obesity drugs, the facility could manufacture small molecule medicines targeting cancer, immunology and neuroscience.\nWhile Houston lacks a deep biotech labor pool, the city has become home to an adjacent life sciences sector, with more than\n700 life science\ncompanies making Houston\nhome\n. Ricks pointed to the Gulf Coast\u2019s chemical workforce as a ready talent base. San Jacinto College is launching a biotech program at Generation Park to train workers for the new jobs. Proximity to chemical suppliers along the coast also helped tip the scales in Houston\u2019s favor.\nThe announcement came amid Lilly\u2019s push to onshore production amid growing demand. Alongside a plant in Virginia, the company expects to announce two more U.S. sites later this year.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "During the six years since New York\u2019s rent law crushed rent-stabilized revenue, the industry opinion\nbecame almost unanimous\n: The legislation would be the death of much of the regulated housing stock.\nBut landlord anecdotes have now given way to court data on increased foreclosure filings and damning reports by watchdog groups and researchers, widening the consensus. Some say the problem is a time bomb: If the state doesn\u2019t step in and alter the law, New York City will have to pick up the pieces of the coming explosion, whether it can afford to or not.\nAnd yet, neither government has acknowledged the threat. Rather, electeds have flat-out denied the distressed narrative. Their doubt, perhaps, stemmed from their distance from the issue. Neither had been forced to shoulder\nthe losses that landlords have\n.\nUntil now.\nAn analysis of city records by\nThe Real Deal\nfound that two city-managed pension funds that are invested in majority rent-stabilized housing \u2014 the subset most affected by the rent law\u2019s revenue constraints \u2014 have cratered, losing more than two-thirds of their value since 2019. (A\ntweet\nin August tipped reporters off to the loss, and a\nBisnow article\nearlier this month explained how the investment happened.)\nInvestments made in partnership with Related and Hudson, once worth $531 million, are now valued at $165 million, a 69 percent decrease.\nPart of that drop emerged after buildings sold, many of them at a loss. But the values of properties still held by the funds have eroded, too.\nOwner groups say the numbers are irrefutable evidence that the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, which effectively capped revenue at rent-stabilized buildings, has driven outsized vacancies that are sending values into the ground \u2014\u00a0and also that politicians can no longer deny this.\n\u201cNew York City\u2019s own pension fund proves the damage of the 2019 rent laws,\u201d Kenny Burgos, CEO of the New York Apartment Association, said. The NYAA represents owners of rent-stabilized housing.\nThe question is whether Albany or New York City, the latter now a victim of the law itself, will see the data for what it is before very bad turns to worse.\nA good idea (at the time)\nThe rent-stabilized investments came out of Hurricane Sandy.\nIn 2013, then-Comptroller John Liu allocated $300 million and $200 million to affordable housing developers Related and Hudson, respectively, to finance housing repair and construction in the wake of Sandy\u2019s $19 billion economic blow.\nThe money was an equity stake to secure an additional $1 billion in loans for Sandy-related construction or repair of about 3,000 affordable units \u2014\u00a0some rent-stabilized, some market rate. At the time, Crain\u2019s New York Business reported that the city estimated that the funds would provide returns between 9 and 14 percent.\nFor a time, they more or less hit those marks.\nThe Related investment boasted an annualized net internal rate of return of 14.3 percent, pension performance reports from 2019 show. The Hudson investment in the same period posted an IRR of 8.6 percent.\nBut after the 2019 rent law passed, performance plummeted.\nThe investments\u2019 multiples \u2014\u00a0another way to gauge value \u2014 slipped. In the quarter after the legislation went live, Related\u2019s multiple dropped 30 percent to 1.14 from 1.63, and Hudson\u2019s fell by about 9 percent to 1.16 from 1.27.\nFast forward to 2025: Related\u2019s multiple now stands at 0.49, meaning the investment has lost over half its value; Hudson\u2019s is 1.09.\nThe actual value may be even less than reported.\n\u201cYou have to assume that they\u2019re always overestimating,\u201d John Murphy, who ran the city employees\u2019 retirement system from 1990 to 2005, said. The retirement system is New York City\u2019s largest pension fund.\nBecause there\u2019s no open market for this type of real estate investment, the way there is for stocks, it\u2019s impossible to know the value of these buildings until they sell.\nIt\u2019s like trying to determine the value of a used car, Murphy said.\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t have an independent market to refer to, you get people\u2019s guesses and they\u2019re always biased,\u201d he added.\nThe devil\u2019s in the data\nBut a spate of recent sales now puts numbers and a visual to value declines.\nIn May of this year, rent-stabilized investors and frequent partners PH Realty and Rockledge\npurchased a portfolio\nof 34 rent-stabilized buildings in the Bronx from Related Fund Management, and by extension, from the pension funds.\nPH, run by Hungerford, paid $192.5 million for the portfolio, 24 percent less than the $253 million the pension fund paid in 2014 (and that\u2019s before accounting for the $30 million sunk into renovations).\nOf the 2,020 units in the portfolio, 263 of them, or 13 percent, were vacant on closing, many because of their poor condition.\nCollectively, the portfolio carried 3,105 housing code violations, 923 of which were designated immediately hazardous: roach and mouse infestations, lack of hot water, mold and lead paint.\n\u201cThey were making deliberate business choices to leave units vacant instead of renting them,\u201d Hungerford said. \u201cThat to me is just like, \u2018Wow.\u2019\u201d\nTo be fair, the rent law likely wasn\u2019t the only factor that drove the Related buildings into disrepair.\u00a0 Stubborn inflation, soaring insurance premiums, rising property taxes and water bills, and high interest rates have all pressured the business model. But the rent law made it impossible for many owners to raise rents enough to cover these increased costs.\nThrough a wider lens, a\nTRD\nanalysis of property records found that 43 Related buildings bought with pension funds between 2014 and 2016 were later sold at a loss between 2023 and 2025.\nThe median haircut was 24 percent. One Bronx building sold at a near-60 percent loss.\nThese 43 properties represent only a portion of the pension fund\u2019s investments; many are held under separate companies that are hard to track, and\nTRD\u2019s\nanalysis excludes buildings sold before 2019, many of which appreciated in value.\nThe Hudson investments are now generating a 1.4 percent return \u2014\u00a0effectively, peanuts \u2014 and the Related fund is operating at an 18.4 percent loss.\nThe difference between the returns underscores the severity of the rent-stabilized crisis.\nBoth investments are in workforce housing, meaning apartments that are priced to be affordable for residents below a certain percentage of the area median income.\nAccording to a former official familiar with the investments, the Hudson investment was focused more on buildings directly in the Sandy flood zone. These buildings have a higher mix of market-rate units.\n\nThe Related portfolio was invested in a higher percentage of pure-play rent-stabilized buildings, and thus was more exposed to the asset class\u2019s downturn.\nScreaming into the void\nThe pension fund losses aren\u2019t news to the industry. Rather, they support the vacancy data, sales numbers and on-the-ground anecdotes that landlords for years have begged the city to recognize as facts and figures that amount to a five-alarm fire.\nCommunity Preservation Corporation, the nonprofit lender, recently\nreported\neight times as many\nforeclosure\nfilings against the 100 percent rent-stabilized buildings in its portfolio as in 2022. (The more rent-stabilized a building, the more constrained its revenues.)\nNearly 30 percent of CPC\u2019s entirely rent-stabilized portfolio doesn\u2019t rake in sufficient rent to cover debt service.\nNew York University\u2019s Furman Center this spring found the cost of operating older, entirely rent-stabilized properties, particularly those in the Bronx,\nexceeded their rent rolls\nby an average of $1,444 annually in 2024.\nCitizens Budget Commission, a watchdog, warned of an imminent\n\u201cmaintenance death spiral\u201d\nif the city did not step in.\nConfronted with those claims, the city has largely refused to acknowledge the pain. Instead, numerous council members, including Speaker Adrienne Adams, have repeatedly called on the Rent Guidelines Board,\u00a0the body that approves annual rent adjustments for stabilized units, to minimize increases to protect tenants.\nZohran Mamdani, leading in the New York City mayoral race, is running on a rent freeze.\nComptroller Brad Lander, meanwhile, has refuted claims that the surge in rent-stabilized vacancies is a problem. In a 2024 report, the comptroller found \u201cno evidence that the HSTPA led to an increase in vacancies, or distress on the city\u2019s rent stabilized housing.\u201d\nThe report went on to say proposals to allow landlords to deregulate units after vacancy are \u201ca dramatic overreaction.\u201d\nThe Community Housing Improvement Program, a trade association that\u2019s now part of NYAA, had pushed for a so-called rent reset bill that would allow owners to boost rents to closer to affordability levels connected to area median income; but critically, those apartments would remain rent-stabilized.\nMoving the needle?\nIt\u2019s unlikely the pension data, though glaring, will compel electeds to listen.\nA spokesperson for Lander\u2019s office did not respond to questions about the losses in the report.\n\u201cAs financial stewards of New York City\u2019s five public pension funds, investing in rent-stabilized housing reflects our commitment to utilizing our pension systems to steadily deliver long-term risk-adjusted investment returns while preserving access to stable and affordable housing as our housing crisis grows more dire,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nTo be sure, the city\u2019s pension fund on the whole is humming along just fine. It beat expectations in fiscal year 2025, earning a 10.3 percent return across the five systems, well above the 7 percent benchmark, Lander recently announced. And the $500 million rent-stabilized investment is a tiny piece of the pension fund, which was\u00a0valued at $294.6 billion in June.\nThat means the rent-stabilized stuff is no threat to city workers\u2019 retirements.\nEven faced with the numbers, the man who made the investment, then-comptroller Liu, has stood by the decision. Liu, a state senator who co-sponsored HSTPA, disputed the premise that rents aren\u2019t keeping pace with costs.\n\u201cFor every landlord that is facing financial hardship, there are still many more landlords that are doing just fine,\u201d he said in an interview with\nTRD\n.\nHe did acknowledge that some owners were struggling but said there could be any number of causes, including the pandemic or the Rent Guidelines Board \u201cnot providing the rent increases that probably should have been granted.\u201d\nHe underscored the law\u2019s wins: that it rightly blocked bad actors from speculating on rent-stabilized apartments or buying portfolios with the hope of deregulating units to boost rents.\n\u201cThank heaven we enacted the Tenant Protection Act in 2019 that reversed 20 years of a consistent pattern of apartment deregulation and people and families losing their homes,\u201d Liu said.\nMark Levine, the Democratic nominee for comptroller and the current Manhattan Borough President has said that he wants to beef up pension investment in affordable housing. He proposed investing $2.5 billion from unallocated ETI funds to offer affordable financing to developers to create or preserve affordable units. In the plan, he called affordable housing development \u201can increasingly safe investment.\u201d\nHis investments would be structured differently than Liu\u2019s Sandy investments, mostly acting as mezzanine debt that could eventually be converted to equity. That financing would allow projects that are sitting in line for other discretionary financing options to receive funding faster, in exchange for developers improving their project\u2019s affordability by either adding affordable units or making planned units more affordable.\nHe says that the investments would not be in the same kind of distressed, existing rent-regulated housing as the 2013 investment.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for that sweet spot where we have some certainty on a stable investment with regular returns, but also providing financing that might not otherwise be available to developers,\u201d Levine said in an interview with\nTRD\n.\nHe acknowledged that these investments \u201cmay on average have a slightly lower return than more typical investments but they\u2019re part of a broad portfolio and the pension fund has a really good track record of meeting its target of 7 percent returns on average over years.\u201d\nHowever it\u2019s discussed, the numbers show that protections against potential profiteers have\ndevalued rent-stabilized buildings\n.\nDevaluation doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect the physical condition of rent-stabilized buildings, sources say. It could reflect a market free from investors buying with the intent to deregulate, raise rents and value.\nThis, according to one former official, could be what the comptroller\u2019s office is arguing when it considers the poor performance of the rent-stabilized pension investments, that the numbers might look alarming, but they\u2019re just a natural reaction to long-term tenant protection.\nAdvocates and observers of the industry believe the city\u2019s dismissal of the data is purely political.\n\u201cThe politics is dictating the reaction to the rent law and its impact on the housing quality,\u201d Jay Martin, an executive at NYAA, said.\nThat is: Even if the rent law is creating vacancies that kill property values, exacerbating the housing crisis and driving losses \u2014 albeit small \u2014 to city workers\u2019 retirement accounts, electeds are not going to advocate for any change that would drive rents higher.\nTenants are their largest constituency, and tenants, as their advocates at every Rent Guidelines Board meeting this year have cried, are drowning, too.\nTo acknowledge the landlords\u2019 plight would be a bad look, Sherwin Belkin, a rent-stabilized attorney, said.\n\u201cIf they say, \u2018We made a mistake,\u2019 \u2014\u00a0and I think they made a whopper of a mistake by so many aspects of the 2019 law \u2014 that will lead to putting their re-election in jeopardy,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd first and foremost is, \u2018I want to stay in office.\u2019\u201d\n",

        "content": "Sterling Bay is continuing its sell-off streak, taking a $1.9 million loss on a prime Fulton Market parcel where the firm envisioned a 39-story apartment tower.\nThe Chicago developer sold the vacant site at 350 North Morgan Street for $18 million to a venture led by local investor Marc Bortz, Cook County property records show. The deal closed months after Sterling Bay secured Chicago City Council approval for the high-rise, but the firm has been trimming its\npipeline\nas financial pressure mounts, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nSterling Bay bought the parcel in March 2020 for $19.9 million. At the time, it planned an 18-story office building for Google, which would have marked a major expansion for the tech giant. The pandemic killed that deal, and like many developers, Sterling Bay pivoted to residential. The city signed off earlier this year on its plan for 500-plus apartments.\nSterling Bay has struggled to keep momentum at Lincoln Yards, the $6 billion megaproject it planned on the North Side. The company handed control of the northern portion to a lender and is reportedly preparing to sell off the southern half as well. Last month the firm listed a vacant, 284,000-square-foot lab-and-office building at\n1229 West Concord Place\nin Lincoln Yards. That building has a $67 million loan from Bank OZK maturing this month.\nIt has listed other Fulton Market sites, a Loop office building and land near\nLincoln Yards\n, even as it nears a deal to acquire Boeing\u2019s former Chicago headquarters in the West Loop, a 36-story building at\n100 North Riverside Plaza\n, which Boeing has owned since 2005.\nBortz\u2019s group could press forward with the entitled resi tower or pursue a new concept altogether. If apartments are the play, they\u2019d land in a hot rental market: Class A downtown rents climbed to $3.99 per square foot midway through 2025, up 6.4 percent year-over-year.\n\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Jonas Woods, a longtime force in downtown Dallas real estate, is shifting gears.\nThe developer handed day-to-day control of Pacific Elm Properties to co-founder and chief investment officer Billy Prewitt while teaming with Ignite-Rebees to form a new platform, 3-O Real Estate Partners, with a $4 billion pipeline in the works, D Magazine\nreported\n.\nThe move marks another pivot for Woods, who made his name launching Victory Park for Hillwood before spinning out on his own in 2008. He recapitalized Woods Capital as Pacific Elm in 2022, and under that banner has been a leader in Dallas\u2019\nadaptive reuse wave\n. Santander Tower, his 50-story trophy on Elm Street, was redeveloped with offices, apartments under the Peridot brand, a Mint House hotel and the Tower Club.\nPacific Elm and Ignite-Rebees are pooling assets into 3-O, a venture led by Woods alongside\nIgnite-Rebees\nfounders Tristan Simon, Mark Masinter and Tom Paterson. The companies didn\u2019t specify which properties would roll in, but said 3-O will manage 2 million square feet across Dallas, Austin, Houston, San Antonio, Nashville and Los Angeles, with billions in development queued up.\nPrewitt is stepping up as Pacific Elm\u2019s CEO after 17 years working alongside Woods.\n\n\u201cBilly has been intricately involved in every aspect of our business,\u201d Woods told the outlet. He will remain Pacific Elm\u2019s second-largest investor and strategic advisor.\nPacific Elm is hardly winding down. Its portfolio spans six Class A towers totaling 4.4 million square feet and 10 acres of development sites, including One Dallas Center, 2100 Ross, and the 500,000-square-foot\nBank of America Tower\nat Parkside, which is under construction. Santander Tower is getting a second Peridot phase, while the firm\u2019s broader pipeline spans 9.2 million square feet across Dallas and Raleigh, North Carolina, Bisnow\nreported\n.\nPacific Elm also promoted Clint Corn to chief investment officer, joining chief financial officer John Rutledge, chief managing officer Sara Terry and executive vice president Ashley Becker on the senior team. Prewitt said the succession plan, set in motion months ago, will keep the firm on track.\nThe handoff clears the way for Woods to focus on 3-O\u2019s expansion. Ignite-Rebees brings its own set of mixed-use plays, from\nHenderson Avenue\nin Dallas in partnership with Acadia Realty Trust to a 66-acre\nUptown ATX\npartnership with Brandywine Realty Trust, billed as a transit-oriented mixed-use community.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The lawsuit was filed by the special servicer of the debt, KeyBank National Association.\nThe Upper Manhattan buildings at risk of foreclosure are 517 West 161st Street, 446 West 164th Street, 1484 Amsterdam Avenue, 537 West 150th Street, 541 West 144th Street, 516 West 136th Street and 3694 Broadway. The Bronx buildings are at 1075 Nelson Avenue and 2105 Ryer Avenue.\nAll told, the buildings include 269 units, only two of which appear to be available on StreetEasy; both of those are in contract, too. Most of the buildings were acquired between 2014 and 2017, though a couple were acquired in 2010.\n\nThis is hardly Peterson\u2019s first run-in with distress across his portfolio, which totals nearly 1,300 units. In 2023, he\ndefaulted on loans\ntied to five rent-regulated buildings. Months later, he was\nhit by pre-foreclosure filings\nfrom Fannie Mae on 11 buildings in Upper Manhattan and the Bronx, though it doesn\u2019t appear any of the buildings match the latest batch of distressed properties.\nThose defaults totaled $72 million, bringing the firm\u2019s distressed debt to $108 million at the time, or about one-third of City Skyline\u2019s $316 million portfolio.\nIt\u2019s unclear how many of the units in City Skyline\u2019s latest foreclosure fight are rent-stabilized.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Bay Harbor Islands-based Blue Road, led by CEO Jorge Savloff, and Ilia, led by investment banker Germ\u00e1n Osorio, plan to tap into EB-5 investment for the project, adding to a growing pipeline of projects doing the same.\nThe minimum investment for EB-5 investors is $1.05 million.\nThe developers tapped Fortune International Real Estate\u2019s development sales arm to lead sales and marketing of the project, according to a press release. Units are priced from $380,000 to more than $1 million. The units will range from 552-square-foot studios to 1,412-square-foot three-bedroom condos, the release states.\nShort-term rentals will not be allowed, a spokesperson said.\nThe 40,000-plus square feet of amenities will include a pool deck, outdoor kitchens and lounge, spa rooms, a co-working space, market and cafe, pickleball court and pet spa.\n\nConstruction is expected to begin in mid 2026 and will take about three years to complete, according to the spokesperson.\nAn affiliate of the developers paid $7.5 million for the property in 2022, records show.\nThe project is named after the late William Fulford, a U.S. Coast Guard captain dating back more than a century who acquired a 160-acre plot of land that eventually became part of North Miami Beach.\nArchitect Carlos Ott and Behar Font &amp; Partners are designing the project, with interiors by Urban Robot, according to the release.\nThe project will mark at the least the second collaboration between Blue Road and\nEdgardo Defortuna\n\u2019s Fortune International Group in North Miami Beach. Fortune and Blue Road are building their\nNexo Residences,\na 16-story, 254-unit short-term rental-friendly condo building at 13899 Biscayne Boulevard.

He described his team as the launching pad for several top producers, including Michael Lorber, co-founder of his eponymous team, and Eleonora Srugo, the star of Netflix\u2019s \u201cSelling the City.\u201d\nBefore his departure, Sroka was advising the firm on its\ninternational expansion\n, a move CEO Michael Liebowitz announced earlier this year after ending a 15-year partnership with London-based Knight Frank.\nSroka\u2019s exit follows leaders of some of Elliman\u2019s top-producing teams, including Holly Parker, who left to join Compass in February, and Noble Black,\nwho returned\nto the Corcoran Group earlier this month.\n",

Therefore, it should come as no surprise that a building with the Kodak Film Lab as a tenant fit into the former category.\nThe firm\u2019s Standard Motors Product Building at 37-18 Northern Boulevard in Long Island City traded for $42 million, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The buyer was Jack Guttman\u2019s Pearl Realty Management.\nThe sale of the 300,000-square-foot Queens office building breaks down to $140 per square foot. It\u2019s likely a disappointing result for Rechler, which purchased the former automotive parts manufacturing facility\nfor $110 million\nin 2014.\nA Newmark team including Brett Siegel, Dan O\u2019Brien and Adam Spies brokered the sale.

        "content": "Developers from across the Los Angeles region came together to discuss the state of the construction market, the city, rebuilding efforts and more at\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s inaugural roundtable event in Hollywood.\nTop of mind, among other issues, was\nMeasure ULA\n, the so-called \u201cmansion tax\u201d that has\ndriven many developers\nout of L.A. city limits. Homeowners have similarly been repelled by the legislation.\n\u201cBuyers and sellers are absolutely disgruntled over ULA, and it is not going away. It\u2019s actually getting worse every day,\u201d\nAaron Kirman, CEO of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\n, said. \u201cWhen you are doing these deals and sellers can be charged anywhere between 4.5 and 5 percent additional fees on top of commissions and closing costs and everything else, it\u2019s make it or break it for a lot of these developers, not only on the luxury level, but for apartments, for retail, and everything in the middle.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s continuing to be challenging and they really need to fix it because it\u2019s the crux of the issues today when we\u2019re selling anything residential, even commercial, it comes up and it really has probably stopped 50 percent of the deals, maybe even more,\u201d Kirman added.\nSean Burton, chairman and CEO of Cityview\n, noted that local officials don\u2019t appear to see the issues with ULA.\n\u201cWhen you talk to city council members and others, I think they don\u2019t believe that ULA is slowing housing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think it\u2019s interest rates. They think it\u2019s ICE raids. They think it\u2019s tariffs. They don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s slowing housing. And we\u2019ve been working to provide data [to show that].\u201d\nIn July, the Los Angeles City Council voted to\ncommit $425 million of Measure ULA funds\nto affordable housing and homelessness programs. Dan Yukelson, CEO of the Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles, doesn\u2019t believe all that money is going to be used to help people by building housing.\n\u201cA big chunk of that is going to enrich attorneys to help tenants who are facing evictions for whatever violation that might have occurred under their lease agreement. Some of it would hopefully go to rental assistance, which is more direct relief to tenants,\u201d Yukelson said. \u201cBut\u2026 this is coming from a former planning commissioner in Beverly Hills: I don\u2019t have hopes that the City of L.A. could build anything reasonably efficiently at all. And that\u2019s why our organization has joined forces with the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association to try to overturn Measure ULA. It\u2019s just bad legislation.\u201d\nUltimately, ULA still presents a hurdle too high for some developers to overcome.\n\n\u201cWe have developers that would love to develop in L.A., that do develop in L.A., that are just saying until ULA gets off the books or changed substantially they\u2019re not going to do it,\u201d Burton said.\nMeanwhile, investor and developer Leo Pustilnikov served as an inspiration for some attendees for his\nchallenging of Beverly Hills officials over builder\u2019s remedy\n.\n\u201cI think what you\u2019re doing is the most important thing happening in the broader city, quite honestly,\u201d Larry Green, managing director of Cain Development, told Pustilnikov. \u201cYou really have shaken it up\u2026 I sit with the council [members] and they\u2019re afraid.\u201d\n\u201cWithout you sort of doing what you\u2019re doing, people would be still twiddling their fingers worrying about stuff,\u201d Green said. \u201cNow stuff is happening because you\u2019ve taken initiative and you\u2019re going for it and it\u2019s creating a carrot-and-stick approach. It\u2019s like, \u2018Guys, either get on board and do something or you know what? We\u2019re going to figure out another way.\u2019 And it\u2019s been dynamite.\u201d\nPustilnikov\u2019s view of his process was simple. \u201cIt\u2019s the Roosevelt approach: Speak softly and carry a big stick,\u201d Pustilnikov said. \u201cBut Beverly Hills is doing it to themselves. They had an opportunity to just have Linden [Surgical Center as builder\u2019s remedy]. And they refused to cooperate and now they have 12 projects.\u201d\nAs for the fire rebuilding process in the Pacific Palisades and Altadena,\nBalaciano Group founder and CEO Shawn Evenhaim\n, who lost his Malibu home in the January blazes, has given up on rebuilding there thanks to municipal missteps.\n\u201cMalibu is doing everything wrong and it\u2019s not surprising,\u201d he said. \u201cThey took the governor\u2019s order, which was pretty simple: Let them build, let them build quick, and let them build 10 percent more than what they had. And they put so many regulations on it,\u201d Evenhaim said. \u201cMy feeling is this time it\u2019s going to be even worse [than the 2018 Camp Fire in Northern California\u2019s Butte County], especially on the beach where they lost over 300 homes, and one of the homes was ours.\u201d\nTRD\n\u2019s Building Back LA Roundtable was filmed at Mother Wolf restaurant in Hollywood. Thanks to\nB/S/H\nfor sponsoring the event and making it possible.\n",

Hilton and Tessa Hilton have abruptly headed for the exit as they set up shop under the Compass banner in Beverly Hills and Palm Beach.\nNews of the husband-and-wife team\u2019s new move came today, fresh off Monday\u2019s announcement that Compass is in a deal to\npurchase Anywhere Real Estate\nfor $1.6 billion. The\ndeal\nis expected to close in the second half of next year.\n\u201cWe are making a strategic move to Compass to position not only ourselves, but most importantly, our clients for long-term success in an increasingly competitive market,\u201d Barron and Tessa Hilton said in a joint statement provided to\nThe Real Deal\n.\nBarron and Tessa Hilton were co-founders and co-CEOs of Hilton Hilton, which listed 12 licensed brokers and salespeople in California as of early Thursday, according to Department of Real Estate records. That\u2019s in addition to an unknown number of office staff. It\u2019s unclear at this point how many of its agents or support staff will make the move with them.\nThe couple cited Compass\u2019 scale, technology and marketing as they thanked their agents, employees and clients.\n\u201cAs part of this next chapter, we invite our agents to join us at Compass, where they will have access to the tools and platform needed to thrive,\u201d the Hiltons said.\nThe couple said they plan to build a multi-market team, beginning with a base in Compass\u2019 Beverly Hills office and what they described in the brokerage\u2019s announcement as a \u201cstrategic presence\u201d in Palm Beach.

That includes\nCarolwood Estates\nfounders Drew Fenton and Ed Leyson and the Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Rayni and Branden Williams.\nHilton Hilton became tangled up in\nlitigatio\nn not long after its start, when Rick Hilton\u2019s former firm alleged in a January 2024 lawsuit it was owed back rent from subleased space on the ground floor of Hilton &amp; Hyland\u2019s offices at 270 North Canon Drive.\nSince the litigation, Hilton Hilton has largely remained out of the spotlight up until the June sale of a residence once owned by Mark Wahlberg in the gated Beverly Park Community to\nParis Hilton\n. Tessa and Barron Hilton represented his sister, Paris, and her husband Carter Reum in the $63.1 million deal for 71 Beverly Park.\nThe following month, Barron Hilton and Tessa Hilton represented Scale AI co-founder Lucy Guo in her $29.5 million purchase of 1680 North Doheny Drive.\n",

        "content": "Three years after Brookfield Properties landed in foreclosure at 175 West Jackson Boulevard, one of Chicago\u2019s most troubled Loop office towers may soon have a buyer \u2014 at a steep discount.\nNew York-based 601W Companies is in talks to acquire the 1.4 million-square-foot property, CoStar\nreported\n. The deal is not finalized and could still collapse given high borrowing costs, weak office demand and limited financing options. But if it closes, it would extend 601W\u2019s run as one of Chicago\u2019s most\nactive buyers of distressed office space\n, adding to its holdings that include the\nOld Post Office\nand the\nAon Center\n.\nThe price is unclear, but sources told CoStar it\u2019s expected to be just a fraction of the roughly $250 million balance tied to the property\u2019s CMBS loan. Brookfield paid nearly $306 million in 2018 \u2014 that\u2019s about $218 per square foot \u2014 financing the acquisition with $280 million in debt later bundled and sold off to investors. By 2022, the trustee for bondholders had filed a foreclosure suit, and the loan matured last fall with $250.5 million still outstanding. Special servicer LNR Partners never moved to take control, instead working toward a discounted sale to cut losses.\n\nThe building faces daunting fundamentals. Marketing materials from JLL, which is brokering the sale, peg vacancy at 53 percent, set to climb to nearly 60 percent with upcoming departures. The weighted average lease term is just under six years. Even after $24 million in recent upgrades, from spec suites to system overhauls, demand has not rebounded.\nThe 22-story Daniel Burnham\u2013designed building, constructed in phases in 1912 and 1927, is among the largest distressed office assets in the Loop. It joins a string of fire-sale deals across downtown, including this year\u2019s $45 million sale of 311 South Wacker Drive, a figure well below its $302 million 2014 trade.\nOpportunistic buyers like 601W might see a long play in the distressed Loop market, on the hunt for massive discounts. The firm has also circled\n525 West Van Buren Street\n, across from the Old Post Office, earlier this year. At the time of negotiations, the 516,000-square-foot tower was expected to go for a dramatic drop from the $135 million Boston-based AEW Capital Management paid for the building in 2015, down from roughly $261 per square foot to a range of $58-$68 per square foot.\n",

Igoe led projects through Sares Regis Group, the seventh-largest commercial\nreal estate developer\nin the Bay Area.\nBorn in Philadelphia in 1941, Igoe spent his high school years playing football and basketball while dating his eventual wife Peggy. He studied civil engineering at Villanova University and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1963.\nFrom there, Igoe spent five years in the\nU.S. Air Force\n, completing his stint in 1968. While in the Air Force, he was involved in one of the Air Force\u2019s spy aircraft programs and the military branch\u2019s California housing projects. He became a captain before returning to the classroom, going to Stanford to earn a graduate degree in civil engineering and Drexel for a master\u2019s in business administration. Those steps laid the groundwork for his career in real estate development.\nIgoe later oversaw the construction and design of PeopleSoft\u2019s 1-million-square-foot campus in Pleasanton. The company was acquired by Oracle in 2004. Since then, Oracle has sold and leased parts of the campus to other companies like\nKaiser Permanente\n.\n\nWhile working with Sares Regis, Igoe oversaw the development of the award-winning Taube Koret Campus for Jewish Life in Palo Alto. He also spearheaded notable projects in Southern California, like the corporate campus for enterprise cybersecurity provider Symantec in Culver City.\nAt Google, Igoe worked as the tech giant\u2019s director of design and construction. In that role, he helped guide\nGoogle\u2019s real estate\nexpansion, including managing the development of more than 23 million square feet of offices. That included its Bay View Campus in Mountain View and its mass timber office in Sunnyvale.\nIgoe is survived by his wife of 59 years, Peggy, five children and 13 grandchildren.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The REIT expects to price the deal Sept. 30 and begin trading Oct. 1 on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, with a dual listing planned for London.

The venture is setting its sights on more deals and counts powerful backers among the ranks.\nInvestors in the venture include Baupost Group, King Street Capital Management, Criterion Real Estate Capital, Liberty Mutual Investments and Abrams Capital. Last month, RXR announced an expanded credit partnership with Liberty Mutual to deploy up to $1 billion in the multifamily market.\n\u201cThe last 18- to 24 months now, we\u2019ve been buying office, primarily from institutions that are seeking to reduce their office exposure as the markets were going through this transition,\u201d Rechler said in a statement.

It was the city\u2019s largest investment deal in three years.\nGemini, which owns 49 to 51 percent of the buildings in its portfolio, also backed the acquisition of a minority stake of a Midtown office tower. At the start of the year, RXR bought a\n49 percent stake\nin Ivanhoe Cambridge\u2019s 1211 Sixth Avenue, a property valued at $1.2 billion.\nGemini also has a stake in the Starrett-Lehigh building in West Chelsea, where Ralph Lauren\nrenewed\n250,000 square feet two years ago.\nNew York City\u2019s office market is piquing investors looking to snap up deals at discounts and bank on the city\u2019s recovery.

The lease with the Battery Park City Authority, a state agency, isn\u2019t scheduled to expire until 2119.\nAs part of the extension for the office complex, Brookfield agreed to pay higher ground-rent payments. The payments are expected to generate $1.5 billion for the city and a joint fund supporting affordable housing development across the city. Last year, the governor, mayor and comptroller announced a $500 million investment in the same fund.\nAnother aspect of the extension is a commitment from Brookfield to reduce emissions, aimed at a net-zero goal by 2050. Additionally, the firm will contribute up to $2.5 million to improve West Street and designate 10,000 square feet of office space for nonprofits and community organizations.\n\u201cThis agreement not only ensures the stability of Battery Park City while building and preserving more affordable homes throughout New York City \u2014 it also uplifts the city\u2019s economy with the continued lease to Brookfield Place,\u201d Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a statement.\n\nDarcy Stacom and CBRE\u2019s Eric Negrin were among those to advise the Battery Park City Authority on the lease negotiations, while Savills\u2019 David Heller and Mark Todrys were among those to advise Brookfield.\nOffice rents at Brookfield Place range from $53 to $65 per square foot, according to CoStar. Brookfield acquired the complex from bankrupt Olympia and York in 1992, spending $900 million to modernize the asset in the last decade.\nEarlier this year, Jane Street Capital\nexpanded\nits footprint at Brookfield\u2019s 250 Vesey Street in Battery Park City to nearly 1 million square feet. The expansion of roughly 400,000 square feet added to the 600,000 square feet Jane Street previously occupied.\nOther tenants at the complex include Royal Bank of Canada and Jones Day. Scotiabank occupies 131,000 square feet, but that space appears to be in jeopardy as it\nrelocates\nto another Brookfield building, 660 Fifth Avenue.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Robert Rivani continued to shrink his Miami commercial condo portfolio with the $19.8 million sale of a two-story space in Miami\u2019s Edgewater leased to a Michael Schwartz restaurant.\nHis Miami-based firm\nRivani\n, formerly called Black Lion, sold the 12,316-square-foot unit at 3101 Northeast Seventh Avenue within the Paraiso Bay condominium complex, a press release states. The space is occupied by Amara at Paraiso, a Latin-infused restaurant owned and operated by Schwartz\u2019s The Genuine Hospitality Group.\nA JLL team led by Alex Sharrin and Jeffrey Cicurel represented Rivani, the release states. The buyer is a Chicago real estate investor \u201cmaking their first splash in South Florida,\u201d Sharrin said in a statement. Rivani and the brokers declined to reveal the buyer\u2019s identity.\nRivani is among the most active firms selling and buying hospitality, retail and restaurant properties in South Florida. Last month, Rivani dropped\n$37 million\nfor Lincoln Theatre, a historic Art Deco building at 551 Lincoln Road in Miami Beach. The 98 percent leased property is anchored by fashion retailer H&amp;M. Other tenants include Swatch and Tapelia Spanish Cuisine.\n\nAlso in August, Rivani landed Beverly Hills-based\nPlayboy\nas the anchor tenant for The Rivani, a seven-story, mixed-use building at 1691 Michigan Avenue, just off Lincoln Road. The iconic media brand is planning to move its global headquarters to Miami Beach.\nPlayboy signed a 10-year lease for a 20,000-square-foot penthouse space at The Rivani. But the high-profile tenant can cancel the agreement if the\ncity of Miami Beach\ndeclines to provide $800,000 in incentives.\nLast year, Rivani purchased that building and a ground lease underneath the land for\n$62.5 million\n. The land is owned by the city of Miami Beach. Rivani is also spending $40 million to renovate the building, which will include a speakeasy lounge and a sushi restaurant.\nSince January, Rivani has sold three other commercial condos leased to high-end restaurants, starting with the\n$28.2 million\nsale of a commercial building in Miami Beach\u2019s South of Fifth neighborhood occupied by seafood restaurant Catch.\nIn May, the firm sold a space at SLS Lux Brickell leased to Gekk\u00f5, a Japanese steakhouse owned by musician Bad Bunny and Miami Beach-based hospitality mogul David Grutman, and a space at Dua Miami Hotel leased to Mexican restaurant RosaNegra Miami. The units sold for a combined\n$38.2 million\n.",

        "content": "Compass\u2019\n$1.6 billion deal to buy\nAnywhere Real Estate set off market-share talk across the industry, but boutiques on the high end of the Los Angeles market aren\u2019t sweating it.\nCarolwood\u2019s Drew Fenton, CEO and co-founder of Los Angeles County\u2019s fastest-growing boutique brokerage, offered a bullish take via text: \u201cThe merger is 110 percent beneficial for Carolwood and other boutique brokerages.\u201d\nTo be sure, he\u2019s part of an elite tier of L.A.\u2019s high end. This year, he and his Beverly Hills-based brokerage appeared on both of the megadeals tied for priciest in Los Angeles County:\n630 Nimes Road\nin Bel-Air and\nSpelling Manor\nat 594 South Mapleton Drive. Both sold for $110 million.\nThe brokerage firms may be small, but claim an outsized influence in Los Angeles. Among the market\u2019s\ntop 20 brokerages\n, the nine independents made up a little over one-third of the $51 billion generated between July 1, 2024, and July 1, 2025, according to analysis by\nThe Real Deal\nof closed deals in the Multiple Listing Service.\nOnce closed,\nCompass\u2019 deal for Anywhere\nwill create an entity with about 50 percent share of the market. (Compass and Coldwell Banker Realty alone ranked No. 1 and 2, respectively, in\nTRD\u2019s most recent ranking\n.)\nThere\u2019s plenty of room for the rest of the field with the other 50 percent, said Beverly Hills-based Nourmand &amp; Associates President Michael Nourmand.\n\u201cIt gives the boutique brokerages a lot of opportunity,\u201d said Nourmand. \u201cThe upside is opportunity that there will be movement, that there will be agents that aren\u2019t happy with the sale.\nAs a result, the merger could shake loose some talent into the laps of independents, but it\u2019s not an apples-to-apples move.\n\u201cWith this purchase, they\u2019re not buying a boutique and rolling them into a conglomerate,\u201d said Stephen Shapiro, co-founder of Beverly Hills-based Westside Estate Agency. \u201cThey\u2019re buying another conglomerate, so the agents are already with Coldwell Banker or Sotheby\u2019s or however many damn names they have.\u201d\nOn closer examination\nThe changes one can count on are logistical cuts to reduce operational efficiencies are inevitable and could change the office real estate landscape.\nIn Beverly Hills alone, Compass, Coldwell Banker Realty, Sotheby\u2019s International Realty and Christie\u2019s International Real Estate each have their own offices. That\u2019s low-hanging fruit to cut two of a brokerage\u2019s biggest expenses: staff and rent, according to Nourmand.\n\u201cThis is M&amp;A 101,\u201d Nourmand said. \u201cThe first thing you do is say, \u2018Nothing\u2019s going to change\u2019 and then you slowly make changes, and you try to plan them out and make them incremental enough.\u201d\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t come and make this bold, risky acquisition to let the brands be independent,\u201d Nourmand added. \u201cYou buy companies to make changes.\u201d\n\nSome in L.A. agree, this is a market share play, whether that\u2019s with respect to agent headcount or owning the inventory and getting sellers to place their properties on the Compass listings or Compass Private Exclusives platforms.\nIf a sizable chunk of inventory sits on a Compass platform, another L.A. brokerage executive said the implications are more than just share. It could lead to the toppling of commission structures as agents know them today.\n\u201cThis is more about Compass positioning itself to better overturn Clear Cooperation and become a real estate search \u201cportal\u201d with listings no one else has. If this is successful, they will create a direct link with the consumer and use that link to \u2018sell\u2019 that consumer back to the agent in the form of a lower percentage of the commission.\n\u201cWhat the agents fail to understand is that this is the first play in a long game to reduce their splits,\u201d the executive added. \u201cI do not expect Compass to admit to this.\u201d\nGuessing game\nAsk an L.A. executive if they see\nmore acquisitions\nfor the market and the responses are mixed.\n\u201cMoves of this scale will certainly accelerate further consolidation across the industry,\u201d The Agency CEO and founder Mauricio Umansky said in a statement provided to\nTRD\n. \u201cAt the same time, they open even more space for boutique firms like The Agency \u2014 where independence, creativity and collaboration allow us to deliver an elevated and deeply personal real estate experience.\u201d\nWestside Estate Agency\u2019s Shapiro said he\u2019s not so sure about the M&amp;A wave continuing.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s left? Prudential? There really isn\u2019t much more to consolidate,\u201d he said.\nFor boutique consolidation, Shapiro doesn\u2019t buy that either. He referenced the initial idea for WEA, which was to structure the brokerage like a law firm where partners divided the profits annually.\n\u201cThe agents at the larger companies that were successful were afraid to leave the mothership,\u201d he said of the market reception. \u201cThey weren\u2019t entrepreneurial. And if you\u2019re talking about boutiques getting together, then who\u2019s the head of that snake? You have a bunch of independent people getting together that still want to be\nindependent\nand then it becomes the same problem.\u201d\nIndustry gossip and speculation runs part and parcel with the rush from mega closings. While no one really knows with certainty which way the deal goes, it\u2019s still entertaining for some to ruminate over the what-ifs.\n\u201cWhat do I know,\u201d Shapiro said, \u201cand, furthermore, what do I care? But it\u2019s fun to talk about.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Edward Hassan and Adam Firsel cashed out while they were up big this summer from a bet on distressed suburban Chicago retail they made back in 2019.\nA joint venture of Firsel\u2019s Deerfield-based firm\nCore Acquisitions\nand Hassan\u2019s Orland Park-based Edwards Realty fetched $55 million for its nearly 200,000-square-foot\nBurr Ridge Village Center\nshopping destination in the western suburbs. They sold the property for $275 per square foot to Chicago-based investor David L. Husman\u2019s company Heartland Real Estate Partners, according to public records.\nThe deal completed a lucrative turnaround for Core and Edwards, who paid just $15 million six years ago to buy the property out of distress from an offshoot of its original developer. Soon after buying, Core and Edwards dealt with losing a couple of tenants due to their respective companies\u2019 bankruptcies, Firsel said.\nThe property was built by Minnesota-based\nOpus Group\nback in 2007 at a cost of $85 million, according to previous reports, but Core and Edwards took it over from an affiliate of the developer known as Founders Properties at a fraction of that cost. Founders had refinanced Burr Ridge Village Center for a little more than $18.5 million in 2014, but brick-and-mortar retail was struggling at the time.\nHowever, the sector has bounced back, as evidenced by Core\u2019s ensuing renovations and a leasing campaign that cost another $7 million to refill the property to over 95 percent, from just 60 percent at the time of its acquisition. Its improvements included creating an \u201centertainment district\u201d by closing off a road and replacing it with a brick-laden pedestrian-only zone between tenant stores Hampton Social and Topaz Cafe, Firsel said.\n\n\u201cWe also brought in a lot of medical tenants,\u201d he said, noting that Core rented to dermatology, veterinary, physical therapy and healthcare tenants.\nHusman didn\u2019t comment on the transaction. But his firm has invested previously with Core Acquisitions and is keeping Core as Burr Ridge Village Center\u2019s property manager. Retail broker Mid-America Real Estate led the lease-up effort for Core and is still advertising the property.\nWhile the Burr Ridge deal was completed quietly this summer in an off-market transaction without real estate brokers, it set the stage for another big gain recently posted for a suburban Chicago retail property revived from financial disaster.\nTo the north, the\n600,000-square-foot Algonquin Commons\nshopping center traded this month to Chicago-based asset manager Nuveen for $100 million, four years after its previous owners Red Mountain Group and F&amp;F Capital bought it for just $30 million and then spent another $33 million on its comeback. In 2006, it had been valued at $154 million in a purchase by Inland Real Estate that resulted in a big loan default.\n",

Ganger\n, was a prominent advertising executive credited with popularizing diet soda and filtered cigarettes.\nThe father-son duo bought Miradero for an undisclosed amount in 1970, according to the younger Ganger\u2019s obituary. Robert W. Ganger restored the property with his wife, Anneli Ganger, in the 1990s. The three-building compound totals nine bedrooms, 10 bathrooms and a pool and spans 121 feet of beachfront, records show.\nThe Ganger family listed it for $25 million last month, Zillow shows. It marks the latest expensive\nGulf Stream\nsale in recent months. Earlier this month, attorney Henry Rosen\ndropped $22 million\non the oceanfront home at 3435 North Ocean Boulevard. Last year, Debra Levitetz, the ex-wife of Purity Wholesale Grocers founder Jeffrey Levitetz, set the price record for the coastal town when she sold her oceanfront teardown for\n$39 million\n.",

The lawsuit also names the West Palm Beach Community Redevelopment Agency, or CRA, as a defendant.\nThe CRA owns the 2.4-acre property at 801 South Dixie Highway, and entered into a ground lease in 2020 with the Cohen affiliate, which is planning\nWest Palm Point\n, a 23-story tower with 352,000 square feet of offices and 25,000 square feet of ground-floor retail, records show.\n\nCohen Brothers has not been served with any foreclosure filing, \u201cbut our lender has confirmed that the foreclosure complaint is being withdrawn immediately,\u201d Cohen Brothers Senior Vice President Ross Cohen told\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\u201cWe are in the process of refinancing the existing loan via our project financing, which is closing imminently,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThe existing loan is also in the process of being extended in the interim.\u201d\nMichael Woodbury, an attorney representing Union Labor, did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe Cohen affiliate filed a notice of commencement for West Palm Point last year, records show. Ross Cohen said the firm plans to break ground soon.\nThe West Palm Point foreclosure complaint is the latest headache for Cohen, whose net worth Forbes pegs at $1.6 billion. In New York, Cohen Brothers last month struck a deal to sell a distressed office building at 623 Fifth Avenue for\n$188 million\n, as part of its efforts to repay a $187 million judgment to Fortress Investment Group. A portion of the sale proceeds would cover some of the debt owed to Fortress.\nAnother lender won a foreclosure judgment in July for Cohen\u2019s Midtown East, a 31-story office tower at 750 Lexington Avenue that was recently valued at\n$41 million\n. That\u2019s more than an 85 percent drop from the property\u2019s $300 million valuation in 2015, according to Morningstar Credit.",

The development will feature one- and two-bedroom units and parking for 54 vehicles. All apartments will be reserved for low- and moderate-income households; in Los Angeles County, that\u2019s a maximum of $89,550.\nThe project is a joint venture between Meta Housing and the Foundation for Affordable Housing, according to the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee.

That adds to its headquarters footprint of more than 230,000 square feet across the street at Foundry Square IV.\nOpen AI, meanwhile, has similarly\nbeen on a tear in San Francisco\nin recent years. In 2023, the Sam Altman-led giant subleased nearly 500,000 square feet of offices from Uber at 1455 and 1515 Third Street in Mission Bay. The following year, it picked up\nanother 315,000 square feet\nnext door at 550 Terry A. Francois Boulevard. As it stands, the ChatGPT creator boasts more than 1 million square feet of offices in the city.\n\nNew tenants entering the San Francisco office market have sought an average of 34,000 square feet, the Business Times reported.\n\u201cWhile New York showcases resilient growth within its diverse industry base, San Francisco presents an even more dramatic, tech-concentrated boom, with office demand skyrocketing since the public release of ChatGPT and the cascading demand for AI that was created,\u201d Saia said.\nAs of last month, San Francisco saw a 107 percent year-over-year increase in office demand \u2014 up more than 350 percent since ChatGPT was first released to the public in late 2022, according to the Business Times.\nSan Francisco and the Bay Area are expected to see an influx of more than 50,000 workers in the AI sector by 2030,\naccording\nto a recent report from CBRE.

        "content": "Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s plan to reset committee leadership and recalibrate his alliances landed dead on arrival Thursday as Chicago City Council wouldn\u2019t provide the 26 votes necessary to fill several vacancies.\nJohnson\u2019s plan was to fill the opening left by Chicago City Council dean Walter Burnett\u2019s retirement with progressives that might appease criticism from both the Latino Caucus and Black Caucus, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Although Burnett\u2019s replacement \u2014 his son, 29-year-old Walter \u201cRed\u201d Burnett \u2014 was unanimously confirmed to take over the 27th Ward seat, no committee chairmanships were voted on.\nThe biggest prize \u2014 chair of the zoning committee \u2014 Johnson slated for 1st Ward Alderman Daniel La Spata, a progressive who helped Johnson push through a landmark ordinance slashing parking requirements for\ntransit-oriented developments\n, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n. A cycling advocate known for championing protected bike lanes, La Spata is set to lead high-stakes negotiations with developers that shape the city\u2019s growth and housing pipeline.\nIf confirmed, La Spata would have sidelined 44th Ward Alderman Bennett Lawson, who\u2019d been serving as interim chair since the fall but was deemed too green to keep the role. Kennedy Bartley, the mayor\u2019s chief of external affairs, told the outlet that La Spata\u2019s efforts around parking minimums and other reforms made it easier to\nbuild housing\nin the city.\n\nWhoever ends up as chair of zoning will lead discussions with developers and either help push Johnson\u2019s effort to increase the speed of affordable housing development or come at odds with it. The city is still\nshort\nof an estimated 120,000 affordable units currently needed in the community, leaving the mayor to bet that La Spata can drive reforms to speed up housing construction.\nThe other key move in Johnson\u2019s plan was for 37th Ward Alderman Emma Mitts to replace Burnett as vice mayor. The veteran alderman has a long and sometimes fraught history with Johnson, including a very public spat last year when she accused him of reneging on a promised housing committee\nchairmanship\n. Burnett\u2019s version of the vice mayor role came with a $400,000 budget and an assignment as Johnson\u2019s political envoy; Mitts, who has criticized the mayor\u2019s handling of council relations, said she didn\u2019t expect the same perks and vowed to keep her independence.\nOther stalled moves included who would take La Spata\u2019s pedestrian and traffic safety committee. Johnson wanted that to shift to 40th Ward Alderman Andre Vasquez, a frequent Johnson critic who led the charge against the mayor\u2019s failed $300 million property tax hike during last year\u2019s bruising budget battle. Vasquez\u2019s former committee, immigrant and refugee rights, would then have been chaired by first-year 26th Ward Alderman Jessie Fuentes, a close Johnson ally. The contracting oversight and equity committee, previously held by Mitts, was proposed for 17th Ward Alderman David Moore to take over.\nThe planned reshuffle provided a glimpse into Johnson\u2019s effort to both shore up his base and placate critics. But critics were unappeased, pushing votes on committee chairmanships further into the fall.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "As Texas Gov. Greg Abbott sees it, the state is primed for a massive influx of data center and AI-related investments unlike any so far.\nAbbott said diversifying the state economy with nontraditional industries was paramount, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\u00a0 Abbott\u2019s remarks, at a Texas Economic Development investor summit this week, came amid Oracle\u2019s plans with OpenAI and SoftBank to invest $400 billion over the next three years to open AI data centers across the country, in a joint venture dubbed \u201cProject Stargate.\u201d\nThe first Stargate campus opened in Abilene earlier this year.\nAbbott teased to-be-announced AI-related investments coming soon to\nTexas\n, which he claimed could be bigger than Stargate.\nFive more Stargate centers are on tap, including locations in Shackleford County and Milam County in Texas, as well as Lordstown, Ohio and Do\u00f1a Ana County, New Mexico. Another is planned for the midwest.\nSeven gigawatts of capacity for AI-related data processing will be reached once all five are completed, along with 25,000 onsite jobs and thousands of ancillary positions across the country.\n\nThe data center in Abilene is projected to consume 6 GW, nearly double the daily usage of the Texas Rio Grande Valley, for example.\nPlentiful land and infrastructure has made Texas a hub for data centers, according to CBRE. The Dallas-Fort Worth metro has about one-tenth of the U.S. data center market, the largest share after Northern Virginia. But power capacity is a\nchief concern\n. Abbott said the state produces more electricity than any other, generating 12 percent of the nation\u2019s total.\nIData Center equating to more than a gigawatt of capacity are under construction in Dallas-Fort Worth, said Curt Holcomb, managing director for data center solutions at JLL. Holcomb estimated another four gigawatts are in planning stages.\nHow that fares against the increased need for water and electricity created by these data centers remains to be seen, with\ndata computing\nexpected to increase electricity demand by 7 percent this year and 15 percent in 2026 according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\nSome developers are proposing electricity production\u00a0 along with the whole data center package. Fermi Inc., the real estate investment trust co-founded by former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, is pitching\n\u201cProject Matador\u201d\non land owned by Texas Tech University, a 5,000-acre advanced energy and intelligence campus aiming to attract data center and hyperscaler tenants, with plans for 11 gigawatts of power by 2038 from natural gas, solar, and nuclear sources.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "\u201cMember deference\u201d is not dead, but it cracked more than ever on Thursday.\nThe City Council, in an unprecedented move, voted twice at the same meeting to approve real estate projects over the objections of the local Council members.\nThe two most recent examples of this break from Council custom had been single votes in 2021 and 2009.\nOne of Thursday\u2019s votes was expected, as Council leaders had\nmade clear\nearlier in the week that the chamber would approve\n58 units of supportive housing\nin the Bronx for people just released from incarceration.\nIn that case, the overwhelming Democratic chamber defied Republican Kristy Marmorato, who in 2023\nousted a Democratic incumbent\nin part by campaigning against the project. Mayor Eric Adams, who is warring with Council leaders, also opposed the Bronx project after previously supporting it.\nBecause of that unique set of circumstances, the Council\u2019s action does not necessarily signal an increased willingness to buck the local member.\nThe other vote, on a more typical project, came a bit out of the blue. It may be more relevant to the real estate industry, which for decades has been held hostage by the local Council member on rezonings because the other 50 members nearly always parrot their colleague\u2019s vote.\nBy a vote of 37 to 8, members approved a\nrezoning\nto allow 53 units of affordable housing for seniors at 1946 East Seventh Street in Homecrest, a block from Ocean Parkway.\nOne of the \u201cno\u201d votes was from that district\u2019s representative, the conservative, convivial Democrat Simcha Felder. Some neighbors of the project site were opposed to the seven-story project, calling it too big. It will replace two vacant, four-story apartment buildings built in 1925.\n\nSome NIMBY opposition is almost always inevitable, even for utterly harmless projects like the one proposed for East Seventh Street by Ahi Ezer Congregation, an Orthodox Jewish organization. Felder is also Orthodox, and is at no risk of losing his seat, yet he folded like a cheap suit at the behest of the noisy neighbors.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good project,\u201d one of Felder\u2019s colleagues texted\nThe Real Deal\nmoments after the vote. \u201cI\u2019m glad we passed it.\u201d\nAffordable housing for seniors is among the easiest uses to get through the Council. Letting people on fixed incomes age in place appeals to progressives and conservatives alike. Local opposition is generally muted because elderly people are quiet and law-abiding, and don\u2019t contribute to traffic congestion or school or subway crowding.\nStill, Community Board 15 voted 32-0 against the application for East Seventh Street, calling the project\u2019s height \u201cdetrimental to the community in terms of congestion, traffic, and the shadows it will cause on neighboring properties.\u201d\n\u201cIt is way out of character for the neighborhood,\u201d the board concluded in a characteristic, knee-jerk reaction to any increase in housing density.\nAhi Ezer\u2019s proposal was supported by Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and the City Planning Commission. \u201cThe change in zoning from R5 to R6A/R7A will facilitate much needed senior affordable housing in the area,\u201d Reynoso\u2019s recommendation stated.\nBut the override of Felder had more to do with outgoing Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, who vowed early in her tenure that the chamber would increase housing production, and with the chamber\u2019s Progressive Caucus, which has embraced \u201cabundance\u201d as an answer to the housing shortage.\nThursday\u2019s votes were a promising sign that the Council is more willing than ever to put the city\u2019s housing shortage ahead of narrow-minded neighbors and their local representative.\n",

        "content": "The\nair rights revolution\nwas just getting started when\nThe Real Deal\ncovered it in June. At that time, however, the evidence was anecdotal.\nNow we have data.\nDevelopment rights transfers are on pace to increase by 39 percent this year and to reach their highest level since 2016, according to PropertyScout CEO Wilson Parry.\nThe jump will actually be much higher, broker Bob Knakal predicted, because so many deals are pending.\n\u201cIt\u2019s off the charts,\u201d Knakal said. \u201cBy the end of the year it\u2019s going to be triple what it was last year.\u201d\n\u201cThe assemblage game has totally changed.\u201d\nWilson Parry, PropertyScout\nCredit the\nCity of Yes\nlegislation, passed last fall, which\ngreatly increased\nproperty owners\u2019 ability to sell their unused development rights, and last month\u2019s\nMidtown South rezoning\n, which gave buildings in the neighborhood more of them to sell.\nCity of Yes eased air-rights transfers for split districts and landmarked properties, and introduced more flexible zoning envelopes, giving developers more ability to use air rights.\nFor example, to build a tower on an Upper East Side avenue, one can now purchase development rights from scores of townhomes on lower-density side streets nearby.\nA typical Upper East Side townhouse might have 2,000 to 4,000 square feet of unused air rights, sometimes more. That can add two to four apartments to a project that buys them.\nA development site can also now shop for landmarked properties\u2019 air rights from an area about 10 times larger than before.\n\u201cYou used to have two or three potential buyers of your air rights,\u201d Knakal said. \u201cNow you have 30 or 40.\u201d\nLandmark air rights are said to be selling for $180 to $400 per square foot of zoning floor area, meaning buildable square footage, but generally for $200 to $250. If a developer has a site worth $500 a foot, and can buy air rights for $250 a foot, the path to a deal is clear.\nThe other two types of transfers liberalized by the City of Yes were Zoning Law Development Agreements, or ZLDAs (pronounced zeldas), and special district transfers. The latter might allow a Theater District property to sell development rights to any of several dozen parcels.\nTo take advantage of the changes, Genessy Jaramillo, a managing director at Knakal\u2019s shop, BKREA, is exclusively working on air-rights deals. \u201cIt\u2019s on fire,\u201d said. \u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer to be in this niche right now.\u201d\nDevelopers and investment sales brokers, not property owners, are driving the activity. Many owners don\u2019t even know they have air rights to sell, or that they can now transfer them to parcels farther away than just next door or across the street.\nTheir ignorance is understandable. Air rights are an esoteric concept that few New Yorkers pay attention to, if they have heard of it at all. It never comes up in media appearances by Mayor Eric Adams because it is too far in the weeds for a general audience.\nAs a result, what the air rights revolution means for real estate and the city\u2019s skyline has been entirely overlooked by the mainstream media \u2014 and to a large extent by industry publications, too.\nNot by the industry, though.\n\n\u201cThe assemblage game has totally changed with this,\u201d Parry said. \u201cAny developer that\u2019s doing something in Manhattan is definitely keen to this.\u201d\nHe can see their excitement from the vantage point of his business. PropertyScout subscriptions have more than tripled in part because its software lets users see what unused air rights any Manhattan property has and where they can be transferred.\nParry has been fielding calls from users who reach the maximum number of daily property searches \u2014 typically 50 \u2014 allowed by their subscription tier and plead for an exception to see more.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a toy, what you built,\u201d one told him. \u201cIt\u2019s like a game.\u201d\nThe City of Yes has made the assemblage game more fun for builders and brokers. For example, clicking on a landmarked property now highlights a plethora of parcels that can buy its air rights, instead of merely several.\n\u201cIt went from four to six lots before City of Yes to like 60,\u201d Parry said. \u201cIt\u2019s a 10x increase.\u201d\nSurges in development-rights transfers previously occurred from 2005 to 2007 (averaging 115 per year) and from 2013 to 2016 (averaging 109), triggered by a combination of high land prices and rising applications for new buildings, Parry\nreported\non LinkedIn.\nThis year\u2019s projected total of 92 is probably understated, as Knakal noted, because transfers involving landmarked properties take longer than for the two other types. Dozens of these transfers are said to be in the works but had not been recorded yet when Parry tallied the numbers through Aug. 1.\n\u201cLandmark expansion hasn\u2019t shown up yet,\u201d Parry said, citing a certification step that delays deals. \u201cIt\u2019s lagging.\u201d\nPrior to the law changing, only 15 landmark transfers happened in 50 years. \u201cBefore the City of Yes, the landmarks transfer was a total failure,\u201d Parry said.\nNot only were transfer options limited to a few properties for each landmark, but the process was cumbersome and expensive. It required a special permit, which involves a public review and City Council approval.\nCertification is now much easier: The Department of City Planning takes the potential deal to the Landmarks Preservation Commission, which verifies that the seller has a plan to maintain the historic property.\n\u201cWhat used to take a couple of years now takes six to nine months,\u201d Knakal said, adding that a seller can close in 60 to 90 days and leave the certification process to the buyer.\nThe longtime broker, famed for his \u201cmap room\u201d of Manhattan properties, has charted every landmarked building south of 96th Street.\n\u201cWe\u2019re calling all those owners,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have real estate professionals selling air rights, institutions selling air rights, public companies selling air rights, and we have the proverbial little old ladies selling air rights.\u201d\nKnakal\u2019s pitch to property owners is fairly simple: There\u2019s no way to monetize air rights without selling them, and selling them doesn\u2019t reduce a building\u2019s revenue.\nManhattan has 1,220 landmarked buildings. The new law changed the rules for individual landmarks, not all properties in historic districts.\nAir rights do not automatically allow developers to build bigger projects. Height limits, setback requirements, street wall parameters and other factors collectively determine a site\u2019s potential. A massing study must be done to lay out the possibilities.\nFiguring that out, and how to transfer air rights to where you want them, \u201cis like three-dimensional chess,\u201d Knakal said.\n",

Developers in the outer boroughs locked in nine-figure loans to finish construction, refinance aging debt and reimagine retail hubs.\nThe month\u2019s top deals totaled almost $1.3 billion, led by a $340 million loan from Affinius Capital for Sky Equity Group\u2019s Gowanus multifamily project. Beitel borrowed $305 million for its multifamily project in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the Bronx. And Douglaston Development and Corebridge Real Estate Investors reeled in $287 million for their luxury rental tower on the Williamsburg waterfront.\nHere are the top five loans in the outer boroughs.\nSky high | $340M | Gowanus\nAffinius Capital\nprovided a $340 million loan to Sky Equity Group for its Gowanus multifamily development. The loan will allow the builders to finish construction and lease the 603-unit, mixed-use complex at 313 Bond Street. The luxury development, between Union and President streets, includes two multifamily buildings and 51,600 square feet of retail space. Sky Equity is reportedly affiliated with Simon Duchinsky\u2019s Rabsky group; the loan for the project replaces Rabsky\u2019s existing\n$286 million construction loan\nthat G4 Capital provided last year.\nScaling up | $305M | Mott Haven\nScale Lending\n, Slate Property Group\u2019s lending arm, provided a $305 million loan to Beitel for its multifamily project in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the Bronx. The loan will finance ground-up construction for the two-building, 515,000-square-foot development at 355 Exterior Street. The project will consist of connected 40-story and 26-story buildings. The development will include nearly 200 parking spaces, more than 11,000 square feet of retail space and residential amenities such as an outdoor pool, outdoor terrace, a gym and a pickleball court. At least 25 percent of the units will be affordable under the\nexpired 421a program\n. Landstone Capital arranged the 18-month whole-term loan, which includes two six-month extension options.\n\nWaterfront windfall | $287M | Williamsburg\nKKR Real Estate Credit\nprovided a $287 million loan to Douglaston Development and Corebridge Real Estate Investors for their luxury rental tower on the Williamsburg waterfront. The 41-story residential property at 1 North Fourth Place was built in 2015 and contains 509 units, and Douglaston has claimed it as the first high-rise rental project on the Williamsburg waterfront. The fresh financing replaced a $206 million loan from Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company.\nBronx booty | $201M | Concourse Village\nMerchants Capital\nprovided a $201 million loan to Arker Companies for 17 Bronx affordable housing developments. The fresh financing replaced a $178 million loan from Freddie Mac and the NYC Housing Development Corporation. The properties have 679 units and include 1041 Findlay Avenue, 1280 Sheridan Avenue and 1055 Findlay Avenue in Concourse Village.\nRentar refi | $160M | Middle Village\nDeutsche Bank and UBS\noriginated a $160 CMBS loan for Rentar Development\u2019s mixed-use plaza in Middle Village, which is in the midst of a retail overhaul. The fresh financing for Rentar Plaza at 66-26 Metropolitan Avenue replaced a $132 million loan backed by the complex. The three-story, 1.4 million-square-foot asset includes both retail and industrial space. The city is the property\u2019s largest industrial tenant, while BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club anchors the retail component.\n",

        "content": "There were 237 transactions totaling $368 million recorded in New York City over the 24 hours before 4:00 p.m. on Thursday, Sept. 25.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Residential:\nA Lincoln Square sponsor unit marked the top residential sale recorded in New York City.\nRobert Lourie\n, an executive at the hedge fund\nRenaissance Technologies,\nnabbed the unit\nat\nSJP Properties\u2019 200 Amsterdam Avenue\nfor $19.6 million. The four-bedroom residence spans about 4,700 square feet, pricing the deal at roughly $4,200 per square foot. Serhant\u2019s\nPeter Zaitzeff\nand\nJamie Hannon\nhad the listing. The unit has been on and off the market since at least 2019, when it was listed for $21 million.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded in the city was in Bushwick, where a one-story retail property at\n321 Starr Street\ntraded for $17.5 million. The buyer was an affiliate of\nYale Properties USA\n. The seller was a company tied to\nRichard Leibovitch\u2019s Arel Capital\n. The building spans 26,600 square feet. The deal pencils out to about $660 per square foot. The property last traded a decade ago for $9 million.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nIn Soho, a duplex penthouse at the landmarked building\n87 Mercer Street\nchanged hands for $17.4 million.\nJon and Ashley Venetos\n, founders of investment management firm Lurin, were the sellers of the unit, which has a two-level rooftop terrace. The four-bedroom pad has an outdoor wood-burning fireplace, outdoor kitchen, library and solarium. The transaction also included private storage space and a private gym in the lower level of the building. The unit has been on and off the market since 2017, when its asking price was just under $25 million. Its most recent asking price was just under $20 million. The buyer was an LLC.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Kammy Moalemzadeh\n, founder and managing partner of Arcadia Investment Partners, purchased a three-bedroom condo at\n25 Bond Street\nin Noho for $10.4 million. The seller was an LLC that had paid $8.7 million for the unit in 2013. The transaction appears to have been off-market.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nAn LLC tied to Beverly Hills-based hotelier\nEfrem Harkahm\npaid $8.9 million for a 62-unit, 75,000-square-foot apartment complex at\n263 Eastern Parkway\nin Crown Heights. The transaction comes out to almost $120 per square foot. The seller of the six-story building was\nMichelin Partners LLC\n, which has owned the complex since at least the 1970s.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nIn the Bronx, a retail property at\n3500 White Plains Road\ntraded for $8 million. The seller was\nCinquemani Partners LLC\n, which had owned the 10,000-square-foot building for decades. The buyer was a company managed by developer\nAziz Tareb.\nBy the Numbers:\nWhich U.S. county has the most pressured housing market?\nAmid a nationwide affordability crisis, Honolulu County in Hawaii stands out as the most cost-pressured housing market in the U.S.\nAttom\npulled third-quarter housing and income data for counties with at least 100,000 residents and at least 50 home sales. Among those 580 counties,\nThe Real Deal\nanalyzed the ones that are not only unaffordable but are also experiencing\nrapid housing price growth\n, along with a high volume of sales.\nThe typical homeowner in Honolulu County in the third quarter needed to spend 61.3 percent of their annual wages on the homeownership costs, which include property taxes, home insurance, mortgage payments and mortgage insurance. This placed the county among the top 8 percent.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "With no discussion, Chicago City Council passed a far-reaching anti-gentrification ordinance for Chicago\u2019s South Shore and Woodlawn neighborhoods Thursday evening, giving tenants the controversial right of first refusal to buy their buildings and establishing requirements for \u201cjust cause\u201d evictions when a building owner plans to sell.\nThe proposal, known as the Jackson Park Housing Pilot Ordinance, was led by 5th Ward Alderman Desmon Yancy and passed despite prior attempts to enact a similar measure stalling for nearly two years.\nIts similarities to another hotly-debated anti-gentrification effort, known as the\nNorthwest Housing Preservation Ordinance\n, prompted pushback from the real estate industry.\n\u201cThe Jackson Park Housing Pilot Ordinance contains hazardous housing policy that could deter much-needed investment, worsen the affordability crisis, and ultimately harm the very tenants it claims to help,\u201d said Jon Kozlowski, Government Affairs Director for the Chicagoland Apartment Association. \u201cThis updated proposal was rushed forward with little input from those who actually provide housing for working families and without careful scrutiny such a sweeping measure deserves.\u201d\nThe new version of the ordinance includes some key differences that are helpful to the real estate industry and others that are not.\nLosses for the industry:\nThe new ordinance gives tenants the right of first refusal to purchase properties when their landlords look to sell, which was a feature of the\nNorthwest anti-gentrification effort\nthat has been sharply criticized by the industry for\nhampering multifamily properties\u2019 resale values\n.\nTenants have a longer timeline to close on a building purchase under the new version of the ordinance\u2019s right of first refusal provision. Instead of being given 120 days to close, tenants are given 180 days to close.\nWins for the industry:\n\nThe new ordinance limits the right of first refusal to buildings with 10 or more units.\nThe original ordinance stated that landlords in South Shore could not evict tenants for any reason other than \u201cjust cause,\u201d which is defined as a breach of a lease agreement or illegal activity. The new ordinance only places that restriction on landlords while they are trying to sell a building, presumably to stop a landlord from evicting tenants before they have time to form a tenants union.\nThe new ordinance removes a provision that states landlords must reimburse the city for relocation assistance provided to tenants under certain circumstances.\nThe new ordinance does not place limits on lease application fees and other moving fees charged by landlords.\nDuring a committee meeting to discuss the ordinance\nheld Wednesday\n, aldermen expressed support for the measure, citing the impending opening of the Obama Presidential Library as a harbinger of change. Johnson echoed those statements after the full council meeting.\n\u201cThis ordinance is a meaningful step in our mission to grow our city\u2019s housing supply while\nincreasing affordability in our neighborhoods,\u201d Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a Sept. 25 statement.\nMedian rent in the pilot area since 2015 has increased by 43 percent, while home values have risen by 130 percent, according to the city.\nOther provisions in the ordinance increased funding for initiatives like property tax debt relief and programs aimed at reducing costs of rehabilitating residential properties.\nChicago City Council\u2019s Committee on Housing and Real Estate voted unanimously to approve the South Shore ordinance Wednesday, in a process that industry lobbying group Neighborhood Building Owners Alliance of Chicago accused of being rushed through the system because it was posted publicly for the first time the day before the committee meeting, which was also during the Jewish high holiday Rosh Hashanah.",

        "content": "Homes on Lake Geneva\u2019s waterfront are selling at gold-medal speed, as two more mansions priced north of $8 million traded in recent weeks.\nThe Wisconsin resort town is forecasting a record year for its most exclusive stretch of shoreline.\nFour lakefront homes have closed at $8 million and up this year, with three more under contract,\naccording\nto Crain\u2019s. Four homes hit that price point last year, including the $22 million sale of the storied\nAloha Lodge\n.\nThe latest deals underscore just how fast buyers are snapping up lakefront inventory. A five-bedroom, 7,500-square-foot home at\n835 Bayview Drive\nhit the \u201ccoming soon\u201d section of listings Sept. 13 with for $8.5 million, or about $1,130 per square foot. A contract was signed Sept. 22, listing agent Gina Nocek of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate told the outlet.\nFive showings occurred soon after the listing, and multiple offers came through, she said. Nocek would not disclose the contract price, but the speed suggests buyers bid up.\nAnother home is right behind it: a new-construction, 7,800-square-foot, eight-bedroom house on Lake Shore Drive with an asking price just under $10 million, or $1,282 per square foot. David Curry of Geneva Lakefront Realty, who\u2019s marketing the property, said it\u2019s already drawing strong interest ahead of showings.\n\u201cThe momentum in this market is out of control right now,\u201d Curry told the outlet.\n\nIn late August\ntwo lakefront homes\nwere listed for nearly $10 million each, located at 620 South Lake Shore Drive and N2224 Bonnie Brae Lane. Those properties \u2014 along with 835 Bayview Drive \u2014 were rare public listings for the hot market and would rank among the priciest homes sold in high-end Wisconsin getaway this year at that price.\nRecent trades highlight the frenzy. A mansion that sold in June fetched $20 million after only three days on the market. In August, another closed for $10.1 million in an\nunsolicited deal\nstruck directly between buyer and seller. The price worked out to $1,442 per square foot.\nWhile brokers cite stock market gains and wealthy buyers\u2019 indifference to high borrowing costs, Curry added another driver: FOMO (fear of missing out).\nFor more than a century, Lake Geneva has been the summer playground of Chicago\u2019s elite. But even seasoned brokers say the pace of today\u2019s trophy-home market is unprecedented.\n\u201cFive years ago, you\u2019d have been out of your mind to build a $9 million spec house. Now it makes sense,\u201d Curry said.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "After a series of delays and contentious debates, Chicago City Council passed a citywide ordinance allowing accessory dwelling units \u2014 also known as granny flats \u2014 with\nmore restrictions\nthan housing advocates would have liked.\nAn original version of the ordinance would have allowed ADUs throughout most of the city with few barriers to the approval process. But a debate about aldermanic control over individual\nADU proposals\nturned into a year-long stalemate.\nAs a compromise, the ordinance approved Thursday bans detached units in low-density districts unless a local alderman opts in. Even then, construction will be capped at one to three ADUs per block, depending on zoning. Detached houses that add an ADU must be owner-occupied. For multi-unit districts, ADUs will be allowed by right.\nStill aldermen, industry groups and the mayor celebrated the outcome.\n\u201cThis ordinance offers a practical, balanced solution that supports both renters and the long-term health of Chicago\u2019s housing market,\u201d said Michael Mini of the Chicagoland Apartment Association. \u201cOur collective efforts should prioritize developing more housing options, particularly housing that is affordable to local residents who need them most.\u201d\nAldermen Marty Quinn\u2019s union-backed amendment requiring contractors to hire through certified apprentice programs for new construction also remained attached to the new ordinance. The Chicago Federation of Labor and building trades had pressed hard for the measure, warning they would sink the ordinance otherwise.\n\u201cI feel this revised ordinance better represents Chicago\u2019s values by lifting up our labor unions and workers,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cChicago is a union town, and including our labor unions in this process was critical.\u201d\n\nThe legislation also scrapped a 700-square-foot size cap on coach houses but maintains a 22-foot height limit and other spacing rules.\nAlderman Bennett Lawson, who originally proposed the ordinance, had pushed for a broader legalization effort, framing\nADUs as a way to chip away\nat Chicago\u2019s estimated 120,000-unit affordable housing shortage by creating unsubsidized, naturally occurring affordable units.\nLawson said the new version of the ordinance should still help the city\u2019s housing needs.\n\u201cThis is something that is very impactful,\u201d he said \u201cIt will bring hundreds of new units, hopefully a year, but in ways that you may not even notice in a neighborhood.\u201d\nQuinn and his allies, however, leveraged organized labor\u2019s support to force concessions, arguing aldermen must retain veto power over zoning changes in their wards. The compromise underscores the council\u2019s long-standing practice of \u201caldermanic prerogative.\u201d\nProgressives, including Mayor Brandon Johnson, had championed ADUs as a modest but citywide affordability fix.\n\u201cBy expanding ADUs to communities across the city, we are increasing housing availability and driving sustainable neighborhood investment,\u201d Johnson said.",

        "content": "JPI is thinking outside the financing playbook in Denton, where it\u2019s building a $132 million apartment community with the help of tax-exempt municipal bonds.\nThe prolific Dallas-based multifamily builder started construction in June on the 461-unit\u00a0 development at North Bonnie Brae Street and Bronco Way, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. The project is JPI\u2019s first bond-financed, public-private partnership, structured through the Denton Housing Authority, which owns the land. Berkadia Affordable Housing arranged the municipal bond financing, while\nJPI\nis overseeing development, construction and asset management.\nThe unusual funding model provided a way to deliver workforce housing while sidestepping traditional capital markets, JPI CEO Payton Mayes said. While not common in Texas, bond-funded development occasionally\npops up\nin other corners of the country.\n\u201cThe capital markets have been challenging over the past few years, but this was another tool in our tool chest that we could really bring value to the municipalities,\u201d Mayes told the outlet.\nJPI is in talks with other municipalities about replicating the model, Mayes said, suggesting\nbond-backed\nworkforce housing deals could become a more common fixture in Texas development.\n\u201cAs more municipalities kind of get to understand the structure \u2026 we think that more and more municipalities will favor this over some alternatives,\u201d Mayes told the outlet.\n\nDenton Housing Authority is projected to receive $35 million in equity from the deal over the first decade.\nHalf of the units will be designated affordable: 35 percent for households earning up to 80 percent of area median income, 10 percent at 60 percent AMI, and 5 percent at 50 percent AMI. The balance will be market-rate apartments. The first deliveries are slated for next fall, with full completion in the first half of 2027.\nElsewhere in Denton, Holt Lunsford\u2019s multifamily arm HL Communities is developing workforce\nhousing\ntargeting hospital workers near Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital and Texas Woman\u2019s University.\nJPI has seven active projects under construction across DFW, including a $100 million community in Haltom City and the $80 million Jefferson Ridglea Village in Fort Worth.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A historic Dallas listing aims to capture the momentum of upcoming projects meant to revitalize downtown Dallas.\nTanya Ragan\u2019s Wildcat Management is selling the Purse Building, a six-story, 75,000-square-foot landmark at 601 Elm Street that was once home to Purse &amp; Company Wholesale Furniture.\nThe brick building constructed in 1905 was used by the FBI as an investigative command center after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in nearby Dealey Plaza. It\u2019s on the National Register of Historic Place and is approved for state and federal historic tax credits as well as the city\u2019s 10-year historic tax abatement.\nWhen Ragan bought it in 2017, it had been vacant for decades. She began rehabbing the Purse Building by removing the outdated carpet and drop ceilings to reveal the building\u2019s original pine floors and timber beams. She originally planned to lease it to an office user, put in a rooftop deck and ground-level retail. At one point, she considered converting the building into a hotel.\nThe property could be transformed into \u201cmultifamily or condo development, creative office, or a flagship destination for a single use,\u201d per the marketing materials.\nThe property is \u201can irreplaceable piece of Dallas history,\u201d Ragan said.\n\nRagan, an advocate for the revitalization of downtown Dallas, got her start in oil and gas leasing. She specializes in adaptive reuse and helped with the redevelopment of the Dallas Farmers Market from a collection of old warehouses into a vibrant mixed-use district with a daily market.\nThe Purse Building listing reflects the challenges real estate operators are facing downtown Dallas, which has lost much of its luster to Uptown. Following the \u201cflight-to-quality\u201d office trend, countless companies have relocated from downtown to new trophy buildings across Klyde Warren Park.\nDowntown is also at risk of\nlosing AT&amp;T headquarters\n, with the telecommunications giant scouting a new location in the suburbs. AT&amp;T currently occupies Whitacre Tower, also known as One AT&amp;T Plaza. In addition,\nthe Neiman Marcus flagship store\n, a downtown landmark, hangs in the balance after a groundswell of support delayed the closure of the beloved store this spring.\nDallas\u2019 central business district struggled under the weight of excess older office space, which brings the area\u2019s office vacancy to nearly 35 percent, compared to the overall market, where vacancy is 25.3 percent, according to a recent report from Partners Real Estate.\nConverting obsolete buildings to other uses provided a much-hyped solution to the glut of office space, but making those projects pencil is a challenge.\nDespite the area\u2019s office market woes, the city is embarking on a $3.5 billion revamp of the Kay Bailey Hutchinson Convention Center. Meanwhile, Hunt Realty is planning a $5 billion redevelopment of Reunion Tower. Both projects would unfold within blocks of the Purse Building.",

        "content": "Developer Neighborlee Living, led by Kurt Jetta, won approval from Palm Beach County for a four-story, 38-unit affordable multifamily project with micro-units as small as 240 square feet.\nThe county commission greenlit the project, dubbed Neighborlee Living Westgate, at a zoning hearing on Thursday. Slated for the 0.7-acre site at 2818 Westgate Avenue, the project is in unincorporated Palm Beach County near\nWest Palm Beach\n, in an area zoned for growth governed by the Westgate Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA).\nJetta said his target renter for the project is recent college graduates.\nMicro-units are a growing segment of the pipeline for planned apartments nationwide. In April, Lyle Stern and Kerry Newman proposed a 400-unit Live Local Act project in Miami\u2019s Allapattah neighborhood that will\ninclude 40 micro-units\n. Proponents see the small scale of the units as an answer to the affordability crunch facing cities around the country. In Seattle, 66 percent of the city\u2019s planned apartments are micro-units,\nMultifamily Dive\nreported in June.\nNeighborlee Living Westgate will have 26\nmicro-units\nspanning 240 square feet, 10 studios spanning 360 square feet and two one-bedroom units spanning 538 square feet. The majority of the units are set aside for renters earning between 60 percent and 80 percent of Palm Beach County\u2019s area median income (AMI), which is $104,000 as of 2024.\nAccording to Neighborlee\u2019s website, micro-units will rent for $1,200 per month, studios for $1,600, and one-bedrooms for $2,000. The studios and one-bedroom units also will come with a $250 per month voucher for childcare costs, the developer confirmed.\n\nWest Palm Beach has\nthousands of residential units\nin the pipeline, but the majority target a luxury demographic. Related Ross\u2019 322-unit apartment tower,\nthe Laurel\n, opened last year, and one-bedroom rents start at $3,500, according to its website.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been wired to pay attention to the people making $50,000 and below,\u201d Jetta said. \u201cI just felt like they were underserved and misunderstood.\u201d\nHe also pointed out that revenue per square foot is significantly higher in micro-units than in traditional units. Still, he said it\u2019s difficult to pencil out the math of developing affordable projects.\n\u201cWe were taken aback by the costs [of construction],\u201d he said.\nThe Westgate micro-unit project is Jetta\u2019s first development in Palm Beach County. Following his approval, he said he has a new understanding of how the process slows down much needed growth in the housing pipeline.\n\u201cWe never ran into some cumbersome regulation,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s well-meaning, everybody\u2019s doing their job, but still, you don\u2019t get the affordable housing output people want to see.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The owners of a nine-story building known as Pasadena Office Tower face foreclosure in the wake of a notice of default on $40 million debt and election to sell that was recorded earlier this month.\nThe commercial mortgage-backed securities loan connected to the office building at 150 South Los Robles Avenue earlier landed in special servicing, with default considered likely and imminent. Borrowers acknowledged they would be unable to pay off the loan prior to maturity, blaming \u201ctenant flight to higher quality space, reduced office demand and inflationary pressures,\u201d according to servicer commentary via Morningstar Credit.\nThe owners, two entities connected to Albert Taban and Michael Pashaie, managing partners at Jade Enterprises and Golden West Properties, saw the property\u2019s\nvalue\nslashed by more than half as tenants fled. The offices were recently appraised at $23 million compared to $57 million at loan issuance in May 2015, per Morningstar.\n\nThat means the 142,000-square-foot property is worth less than the debt connected to it, which the landlords have defaulted on, but still worth around a million dollars more than what it was purchased for in 2002. Taban and Pashaie did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe offices, which were built in the 1970s, are 69 percent occupied compared to 93 percent occupancy at underwriting 10 years ago. The five largest leases combine to account for 39 percent of the space, and include the city of Pasadena, a California Department of Rehabilitation and the Pasadena Community Access Corporation. The three entities\u2019 leases are set to expire before the end of 2027.\nPasadena offices are not seeing the sort of post-pandemic revival that has lifted submarkets such as Century City on the Westside of Los Angeles, where newer, amenity-laden properties are billed as ways to lure workers back to their desks. Buildings in Pasadena, meanwhile, are generally selling at discounts. An office building at 790 East Colorado Boulevard recently\nsold\nfor $31.5 million \u2014 it was previously purchased for $59 million. An office complex at 55 South Lake Avenue and 800 East Colorado Boulevard\nsold\nfor $120 million compared to its $256 million previous price.\n",

        "content": "Shorewood Real Estate Group is the latest developer jumping into the frenzy in one of the Bronx\u2019s hottest neighborhoods.\nS. Lawrence Davis\u2019 firm is planning a 304-unit project at 350 Grand Concourse in Mott Haven, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Shorewood applied with the Department of City Planning nine months after acquiring the site for $28.5 million.\nThe 14-story, 244,000-square-foot development would be a mixed-use building, including a grocery store, which would span 40,000 square feet. Food Bazaar is the prospective tenant for the store. Plans also call for a 60-car parking garage.\nShorewood intends to utilize the 485x program, meaning 25 percent of the units would be set aside for affordable housing; in this case, they would be for families earning up to 60 percent of the area median income, on average.\nIn terms of the subsidy, Davis said rents would be pegged to \u201csupport the higher construction costs associated with the $40-an-hour wage,\u201d eschewing concerns about the wage floor\nattached to the 485x property tax abatement\n.\n\nThe firm projects the development will cost $175 million. It plans to begin construction in the first quarter and wrap in the first half of 2028.\nShorewood has more than 1000 residential units in its pipeline, along with prominent projects in Brooklyn and Queens. The firm was\nsued\nby tenants at 1 Archer Avenue in Jamaica at the start of the year, accused of manipulating rent concessions to dodge the requirements tied to the now-expired 421a tax program.\nAs for Mott Haven, it\u2019s one of the hottest development spots in all of New York City. This summer, Scale Lending provided the Beitel Group with\na $305 million loan\nfor a 755-unit development in the South Bronx neighborhood.\nScale previously\nprovided $150 million\nto Beitel for a 450-unit multifamily project at 120 East 144th Street in Mott Haven. RXR and Brookfield are also among the significant names to get involved in the neighborhood.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The newly named Christie\u2019s International Real Estate First Coast, led by founder Corey Hastings, has 130 agents and focuses on the Jacksonville metropolitan area, the release shows.\nHastings, a former Ohio University football player, is\none of many NFL hopefuls who pivoted to real estate\nafter leaving the league.

First Coast falls under the Compass umbrella of brands, via Compass\u2019\n$444 acquisition\nof @properties and Christie\u2019s last year.\nConsolidation is on the rise across the industry, and brokerages have been jockeying for more territory in Florida since the state\u2019s pandemic market boom.

The residential component will join a fitness club that has partially filled a one-time\nMacy\u2019s\ndepartment store, various smaller retail shops, a 26-story Sheraton hotel, and 33 floors of office space that already comprise The Bloc.\nThe project will proceed under the guidance of the firm\u2019s CEO, Jerry Kanne, who comes to the rough-and-tumble world of real estate development via the Peace Corps. The Iowa native didn\u2019t go directly from do-gooder duty to development, though\n\u2014\nhe did some lumber trading, got his undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Iowa, worked for the Washington, D.C. law firm of Arnold &amp; Porter, and then cofounded Counts &amp; Kanne.\nKanne, who didn\u2019t respond to an inquiry for this piece, eventually landed with the parent of National Real Estate, which has about $4 billion in assets under management and is best known for its multifamily and office development. That was 38 years ago, and he has spanned various aspects of real estate development since.\nIn 2000, multi-billion-dollar pension fund National Electrical Benefit Fund formed an investment team to invest in real estate projects and Kanne ran its in-house real estate operations. In 2010, National Electrical Benefit Fund established National Real Estate Advisors as a subsidiary to manage real estate investments for pension funds and other institutional investors.\nUnder his leadership, National Real Estate Advisors formed a joint venture with\nCatalyst Healthcare Real Estate\nin November 2021 to focus on strategic capital investments in health care real estate. They paid $420 million to acquire and recapitalize two multistate health care portfolios by January 2022,\nCitybiz\nreported.\nThat deal \u201cnot only significantly scales our medical office portfolio, but furthers National\u2019s geographic diversification,\u201d Kanne said at the time.\n\nNational Real Estate, which is co-developing the 2,000-apartment mixed-use project The Stacks in Washington, D.C., has also made significant investments in the data center space. Through a joint venture with Sabey Corporation, Sabey Data Centers has a portfolio of more than 4 million square feet of efficient multitenant data centers. The firm has raised $1.2 billion to invest in data centers, the\nWashington Business Journal\nsaid.\nThe Bloc\nThe project in Downtown Los Angeles brings the development firmly back to the multifamily sector in a big and splashy way. The 41-story residential tower will be among the tallest buildings on the city\u2019s skyline at 710 feet, a status made possible because it starts atop an existing parking structure. The development\u2019s 466 apartments would include a mix of studio, one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments. Also on tape is a sculpted glass rooftop with an open-air amenity deck. A swimming pool, fitness center and lawn are planned.\nCalifornia-based The Ratkovich Company acquired the 2.4-million-square-foot site that was then called Macy\u2019s Plaza in 2013 for\n$241 million\n, according to the Los Angeles Times, and commenced plans for a $180 million transformation. Five years later, Ratkovich\nsold its interest\nto National Real Estate, its financial partner.\nAt the time, Kanne told the Times: \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to build a residential tower on top of the parking garage. Maybe 40 stories.\u201d\nThe recent approval from the City Council means he\u2019s positioned to make good on that hope\n\u2014\nalthough the developer will put in some some extras for the city\nNational Real Estate will make a nearly $16.8 million public benefits payment for a transfer of development rights from the Los Angeles Convention Center, with funds allocated for unspecified public amenities, affordable housing, and street lighting repair.\n",

Along with nine fireplaces, a wine cellar, a creek in the yard and a wedding-ready pavilion with a catering kitchen, amenities include a soundproof theater that can accommodate 20 viewers. Ann Shaw of Briggs Freeman Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has the listing.\nThe asking price amounts to $1,571 per square foot.\nThe Mitchells founded Cinemark in 1984, and Lee Roy led the company until 2022. They\u2019ve owned the house at 9769 Audubon Place since building it in 1995.\n\nThe six-bedroom, 12-bathroom home spans 14,000 square feet and sits on a 3.4-acre lot . The pavilion is 2,500 square feet. The property\u2019s taxable value is $11.8 million, a little more than half of the asking price.\nIt\u2019s the most-expensive residential listing in Texas this month, and also the biggest of the top 10 listings, according to the Houston Association of Realtors. The second-priciest property listed this month is 6 miles away at 3612 Crescent Avenue in Highland Park, an 11,000-square-foot home marketed by Compass for $18.5 million. That\u2019s $1,682 per square foot.\nThe luxury market tends to\nfly above economic turbulence\n, especially in Dallas, the\nultra-luxury capital of Texas\n. Austin has been a\nnotable exception\nthis year, with price cuts and rising inventory as its\nrelationship to the tech industry\nfrays.

Neither Zillow nor Dallas County records indicate that a contract has been signed.\nA Southlake mansion that was originally listed for $27.5 million, one of the most expensive listings in Texas last year,\nrecently sold at auction for $14.22 million\n, less than the suggested starting bid.",

        "content": "Media rooms aren\u2019t rare in ultra-luxury homes, but few were built by movie theater magnates.\nCinemark founders Lee Roy Mitchell and his wife, Tandy, are asking $22 million for his Preston Hollow property at 9769 Audubon Place. Along with nine fireplaces, a wine cellar, a creek in the yard and a wedding-ready pavilion with a catering kitchen, amenities include a soundproof theater that can accommodate 20 viewers. Ann Shaw of Briggs Freeman Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has the listing.\nThe asking price amounts to $1,571 per square foot.\nThe Mitchells founded Cinemark in 1984, and Lee Roy led the company until 2022. They\u2019ve owned the house at 9769 Audubon Place since building it in 1995.\n\nThe six-bedroom, 12-bathroom home spans 14,000 square feet and sits on a 3.4-acre lot . The pavilion is 2,500 square feet. The property\u2019s taxable value is $11.8 million, a little more than half of the asking price.\nIt\u2019s the most-expensive residential listing in Texas this month, and also the biggest of the top 10 listings, according to the Houston Association of Realtors. The second-priciest property listed this month is 6 miles away at 3612 Crescent Avenue in Highland Park, an 11,000-square-foot home marketed by Compass for $18.5 million. That\u2019s $1,682 per square foot.\nThe luxury market tends to\nfly above economic turbulence\n, especially in Dallas, the\nultra-luxury capital of Texas\n. Austin has been a\nnotable exception\nthis year, with price cuts and rising inventory as its\nrelationship to the tech industry\nfrays. In Dallas, Plano and Irving, however, luxury home prices have risen at about the same rate that starter and mid-tier homes have fallen this year, according to First American Data &amp; Analytics.\nAnother Preston Hollow home\nlisted for $28.5 million earlier this month\nbut was taken off the market after less than two weeks, according to Zillow. Neither Zillow nor Dallas County records indicate that a contract has been signed.\nA Southlake mansion that was originally listed for $27.5 million, one of the most expensive listings in Texas last year,\nrecently sold at auction for $14.22 million\n, less than the suggested starting bid.",

During a debate on Sunday, according to\nGothamist\n, real estate took the spotlight during a critical moment.\nWhen asked about lowering rents, Sherrill retorted that her opponent was \u201cnot going to do anything about it because one of his biggest donors is actually being taken to court and sued on this very issue.\u201d\nThe oblique reference was about Jeff Kurtz\u2019s Kamson Corporation, one of 10 landlords being sued by the state alongside RealPage for the use of rent-setting algorithms, which the state argues is collusive.\nKurtz justified the use of the algorithm and Kamson was part of a motion in July to dismiss the state\u2019s lawsuit.\nThe Kurtzes have contributed more than $750,000 to Ciattarelli\u2019s campaigns since 2021, including multiple runs for the governorship. In June, they provided a $200,000 contribution to a political action committee attacking Sherrill.\n\nKamson owns and operates more than 10,000 units across the state. It drew scrutiny two years ago when two small children were killed in a fire at a Kamson complex.\nCiatarelli\u2019s campaign has brought in more than $250,000 from the real industry. Sherrill\u2019s campaign, meanwhile, has landed more than $100,000 in donations from the industry, counting developers Steven Plofker and Chris Yegen among her base.\nNeither candidate commented to Gothamist on the contributions.\nOn the policy front, Sherrill\u2019s real estate focus is on going after negligent landlords and cracking down on drastic rent increases tied to software use. Ciattarelli wants to lower property taxes and energy costs to improve affordability.\nAn Emerson College Polling/PIX11/The Hill survey\nreleased\non Thursday put the race between the two candidates at a dead heat.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The Miami City Commission finalized a controversial deal to transfer ownership of the historic Olympia Theater in downtown Miami to a charter school company co-founded by rapper Pitbull, whose real name is Armando Christian Perez.\nOn Thursday, city commissioners voted unanimously, 5-0, to sell the\n1926 landmark\nand its adjacent 10-story office building to Sports Leadership Arts Management, or SLAM, for just $10. In exchange,\nPitbull\u2019s\nSLAM pledged to invest a minimum of $57 million into restoring the deteriorating venue\u2019s interior performance space and seating area, with an additional $20 million budgeted for renovations to the theater\u2019s upper floors.\n\u201cThis is the best of both worlds,\u201d said commissioner Joe Carollo. \u201cThey\u2019re putting the money to upgrade the whole building, and we\u2019ll still have the Olympia Theater.\u201d\nOpened in 1926 as a silent movie palace, the Olympia Theater has long been considered a crown jewel of downtown Miami\u2019s\nFlagler Street\n. Designed by John Eberson and renovated decades later by Morris Lapidus, the theater was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It has hosted cultural icons including B.B. King, Luciano Pavarotti and Etta James.\nThe property\u2019s condition, however, has worsened in recent years. Leaks, structural damage and outdated systems have left the building in disrepair, city records show. Required upgrades in the SLAM agreement include reconstructing dressing and crew rooms, repairing water-damaged decorative plaster, retrofitting mechanical systems and restoring the marquee, fa\u00e7ade, roof and ticket booth.\nThe sale also resolves an ongoing legal dispute with the heirs of Maurice Gusman, the late developer who rescued the property from demolition in the 1970s. In 2019, his family sued the city for allegedly violating a covenant involving its management of the theater via the semiautonomous Miami Parking Authority. Under the SLAM deal, the city and the\nGusman family\nwill settle the lawsuit if SLAM restores the property within five years of receiving building permits.\n\nSLAM, which operates several\ncharter schools\nin South Florida, plans to open Miami Tech at Mater Innovation Academy within the Olympia Theater complex. The campus would likely partner with Miami Dade College for dual enrollment programs, and the building would be renamed the Miami Innovation &amp; Arts Academy. SLAM must also host programming that is available to the general public for at least 180 days of the year.\nDozens of charter school employees and parents whose children attend SLAM-affiliated schools spoke in favor of the agreement during the public comment portion of the city commission meeting.\n\u201cOlympia is an iconic landmark that must be preserved,\u201d said SLAM co-founder and CEO Millie Sanchez. \u201cOur proposal saves the Olympia Theater, and it saves the city and its taxpayers from bearing that cost. The Gusman family, the original benefactor, supports this plan.\u201d\nHowever, dozens of city residents spoke against giving Olympia Theater away to SLAM. Longtime Miami activist Elvis Cruz said the city was prioritizing its own convenience over residents\u2019 concerns.\n\u201cOver 45 years of civic activism I have learned the city of Miami loves to do things for its own comfort and convenience, even if it causes discomfort and inconvenience for residents,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cDon\u2019t sell the Olympia Theater. Please restore it.\u201d\nAnother activist, Sandy Moise, criticized city leaders for ramming the agreement through. \u201cCity officials have been acting like lobbyists,\u201d Moise said. \u201cWhat we are closer to is giving away one of Miami\u2019s greatest public treasures in a backroom deal that does not reflect the will or the best interests of the people.\u201d",

        "content": "Joe Mansueto is in the clear to start construction on a 22,000-seat soccer stadium for Chicago Fire FC at Related Midwest\u2019s megadevelopment The 78.\nThe Chicago City Council gave final approval for the plans this week, meaning dirt can start moving to meet the soccer club\u2019s goal of having the project finished in time for Major League Soccer\u2019s 2028 season, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. The stadium was previously reported to be a $650 million investment by\nMansueto\n, but recent reports pegged it at $750 million. It\u2019s unclear what has caused the discrepancy. The zoning amendment needed to allow the stadium to be built passed unanimously.\nThe\nprivately-funded stadium\nwill anchor Related Midwest\u2019s 62-acre South Loop megaproject. The 78 is expected to be an $8 billion mixed-use campus along the South Branch of the Chicago River, currently a vacant swath of riverfront land between Roosevelt Road and Ping Tom Memorial Park in Chinatown.\nThe soccer team agreed to cap major events at the stadium to 45 per year, including the Fire\u2019s 17 home games per season. Building a dedicated soccer stadium would enable the team to control its own schedule, create a more intimate fan experience,and host a range of events throughout the year. The team has experienced years of frustration sharing Soldier Field with the\nChicago Bears\n.\n\nAbout 5,000 apartment units are part of Related Midwest\u2019s plans around the stadium, along with over a mile of bike trails, 3 acres of sports fields, public parking and a water taxi stop along the 1,400 feet of riverfront.\nFirst proposed in 2019, Related Midwest\u2019s redevelopment agreement called for the developer to spend $551 million on rebuilding local transportation infrastructure for the site, which was to include a CTA Red Line stop and adjustment of nearby Metra train tracks. Tax increment financing would then be used to reimburse the developer.\nLast week Curt Bailey, president of Related Midwest, told the Chicago Plan Commission that the 2019 plan was no longer needed and had become too costly. A new proposal would scrap the realignment of Metra tracks and the Red Line station, Bailey said. The 2019 agreement is expected to be\nrenegotiated\n, according to Ciere Boatright, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Planning and Development.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Other clothing giants like\nMacy\u2019s\nand\nBloomingdale\u2019s\nfled the city and shut down their flagship locations.\nThe timing for Uniqlo\u2019s return feels right, company officials said. The company is getting close to confirming a location and considers San Francisco an important market, said Tomo Yasuda, Uniqlo\u2019s North America real estate director.\n\nYasuda and other Uniqlo bigwigs met with Mayor Daniel Lurie and his staff this summer. Uniqlo reportedly was looking to discuss how the company could \u201cpartner with the city to rejuvenate the city and have a successful opening.\u201d Uniqlo also sought to discuss \u201ccommitments to making the downtown better\u201d and how to \u201chelp to speed up our permitting process.\u201d\nWhile the location of the new Uniqlo outpost hasn\u2019t been confirmed, a representative for investment firm Pontegadea said earlier this year that it was \u201cworking on a lease with Uniqlo for Pac Place.\u201d The Pacific Place building, at 801 Market Street, is owned by Pontegadea and was formerly occupied by Old Navy before it closed in 2023.\nUniqlo\u2019s comeback in San Francisco would mark a major step in the company\u2019s post-pandemic growth, though it wouldn\u2019t be the only store location in the Bay Area. The\nStonestown Galleria mall\nhas had a Uniqlo location since 2013. An Emeryville location also opened that same year.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

But the judge sided with Core, pointing to a memorandum of understanding the parties drafted last year that restructured payment terms.\nShvo never signed the document, but Masley found the club had shown \u201cgood faith\u201d by paying rent in line with its modified obligations. The judge ordered Core to keep paying under the terms of its 2021 lease and barred Shvo from taking steps to evict.\n\nShvo\u2019s camp took the ruling as a win, emphasizing that the court affirmed Core still needs to abide by its original lease. An attorney for Core framed the decision as shutting down a \u201cbaseless eviction attempt\u201d and said the club will continue pressing for damages tied to what it describes as Shvo\u2019s \u201cegregious misconduct.\u201d\nCore, which relocated to Fifth Avenue in 2022 from East 55th Street, has roughly 1,500 members paying upward of $10,000 annually. Court filings show it pulled in $25 million of revenue last year with net income of $2.7 million. But the glossy brand has traded insults with its landlord, accusing Shvo of neglecting basic building services, from cold showers to clogged toilets.\nThe two sides are entangled in other disputes, including a separate judgment that Core owes Shvo $1 million on an old loan.\nMeanwhile, Shvo faces pressure of his own. Sales have reportedly stalled at his Miami Beach condo project, putting his ownership in jeopardy, and he\u2019s separately\nweighing bulk sales\nof units at the Mandarin Oriental residences on Fifth.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Compass touted unity among the 340,000 real estate professionals it would add under its umbrella by acquiring Anywhere Real Estate, but Texas brokers aren\u2019t clear on how the move will change the game.\nThe move followed another blockbuster deal. Last year, Compass agreed to acquire Chicago-born @properties for a stunning $444 million. The deal for its competitor in the market built on their first- and second-place spots in the brokerage scene and secured Compass\u2019 foothold. If the merger with Anywhere goes through next year, brands affiliated with Compass will account for most of the sales volume of the\ntop 20 brokerages in Chicago\n, according to an analysis of last year\u2019s sales.\nNorth Texas is a more varied market. The top 20 brokerages in the Metroplex charted $37.9 billion in volume last year. Compass and the brands that it will absorb completed $12.39 billion altogether, meaning that Compass stands to gain about a third of the market share in North Texas. Other brokerages completed $25.55 billion in volume.\nColdwell Banker Apex, Coldwell Banker Realty, Briggs Freeman Sotheby\u2019s International Real Estate, Century 21 Mike Bowman and Century 21 Judge Fite are the top North Texas brokerages that operate under the Anywhere brand. With Compass, their combined volume of $12.4 billion would dwarf the No. 1 brokerage, Berkshire Hathaway-owned Ebby Halliday Real Estate, which completed $5.84 billion.\nA caveat: Coldwell Banker, Sotheby\u2019s International Real Estate and Century 21 are franchisors, so the local offices affiliated with their brand are independently operated. Compass owns its Dallas office, but Anywhere doesn\u2019t own the businesses that pay to use its brands, which compete with each other to varying degrees. The merger won\u2019t combine these businesses into one.\n\u201cWe have a franchise agreement with Anywhere, and that will stay in place for the long term,\u201d said Jim Fite, owner of Century 21 Judge Fite.\nA change in the guard doesn\u2019t make much difference in the day-to-day work of a franchisee, said Jerry Mooty Jr., CEO and broker of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate @properties Lone Star, which Compass also recently\nacquired\n.\n\u201cWe still report to the same Christie\u2019s leadership; if anything\u2019s happened, it\u2019s actually helped us on the recruiting side,\u201d Mooty said, adding that branding matters in the luxury world.\nChristie\u2019s brass told agents last year that the Compass name would boost prestige. Not all agents accepted the encouragement. Nancy Almodovar, founder of leading Houston luxury brokerage Nan &amp; Co, said her office was \u201c\nblindsided\n\u201d by Compass.\n\n\u201cI actually believe the consumer maybe even pays more attention to the brand of the individual agent than they do the company,\u201d argued Tommy Flood, head of the GO Network, the largest franchise in Keller Williams, which stands to become the second biggest brokerage in the country after the acquisition.\nFite said he doesn\u2019t expect his company or the Century 21 brand to be affected. His primary concern is data sharing.\n\u201cThe ownership of data is very important. I don\u2019t want my company data in the hands of my competitor, and I believe my franchise agreement prevents that,\u201d Fite said.\nCompass can collect \u201cagnostic data\u201d without violating franchise agreements using a multitenant technology structure that would protect each office\u2019s data, Mooty said.\n\u201cYou can build a technology stack on what\u2019s called a single-tenant model, where everybody plugs in and all that data is included in one big database. That\u2019s what Compass was originally when it was just Compass,\u201d Mooty said. For franchises, though, \u201cthere might be some agnostic data or whatever the word is \u2014 it\u2019s not identifiable data \u2014 that might pool up to where you get a bigger picture of the real estate market.\u201d\nCompass ranked second among North Texas brokerages last year in TRD Data, and Century 21 Judge Fite ranked 11th with $1.3 billion in volume. The nearest competitor to Compass under the Anywhere brand is Coldwell Banker Apex, which ranked fifth with $2.2 billion in volume.\n\u201cI think our presence is smaller in the more medium price range in the suburbs,\u201d said Michelle Wood, founding partner of the Detwiler+Wood Group, the highest-producing Compass team in the Dallas market.\nWhen asked if the acquisition might resolve any rivalries between brokerages, as it\u2019s expected to in\nMiami\n, Wood said that Anywhere brokerages \u201cdon\u2019t compete with us in the Dallas market.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Rithm Capital\u2019s\ndeal to buy\nParamount Group for $1.6 billion came as a bit of a surprise.\nAfter bids from Blackstone, SL Green and Empire State Realty Trust, it was Rithm, a lesser-known but still deep-pocketed asset manager with a focus on mortgage servicing, that came out on top.\nThe company is set to take on Paramount\u2019s 13 million square feet of office space in New York and San Francisco at a 40 percent discount to its book value.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very patient in the office sector, and we believe now is the right time to do so,\u201d said\u00a0 Rithm CEO Michael Nierenberg in a conference call with analysts on September 17.\nThe deal comes after Paramount and its long-time CEO Albert Behler have\nbeen in the news\nfor all the wrong reasons. Earlier this year, the company revealed it made millions of dollars in previously undisclosed payments to CEO Albert Behler\u2019s companies. Paramount also disclosed it is under an SEC investigation. Meanwhile, TRD further discovered that Behler gave a no-bid contract to a company tied to his ex-girlfriend.\nBut those days should soon be behind Paramount. Rithm\u2019s deal still requires shareholder approval, but is expected to close at the end of the year.\nParamount\u2019s sale is being closely scrutinized by analysts. It is among the first large-scale acquisitions of offices since the pandemic. And depending on who you talk to, either paints a positive picture of the New York office landscape or a dismal one for Paramount shareholders.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the deal:\nThe offer and other key numbers:\nRithm will pay: $6.60 per diluted share\nTotal offer amount: $1.6B\nParamount stock price, prior to Rithm\u2019s deal: $7.39\nParamount\u2019s highest stock price in last five years: $11.53\nParamount\u2019s portfolio:\nParamount\u2019s portfolio includes 13 owned and four managed office assets in New York City and San Francisco. About 8.7 million square feet of space is located in New York.\nOver 85 percent of the portfolio is leased as of June 2025 and annualized average rent is $90 per square foot, according to an investor presentation.\nIn New York, its buildings include: 1633 Broadway, 1301 Avenue of the Americas and 1325 Avenue of the Americas. In San Francisco, Paramount owns One Market Plaza, 300 Mission Street and One Front Street.\nWhy was Paramount put up for sale?\nParamount was facing pressure from shareholders and analysts over its high compensation to executives relative to its stock performance.\nIn early 2025, Paramount disclosed that it paid millions of dollars to Behler\u2019s outside companies or personal interests, including $3 million for a private jet firm Behler co-owned.\nA short time later, Paramount announced it was undergoing a strategic review and hired Bank of America as its financial advisor. The overall office market in New York had improved and investor appetite was growing. Paramount signed over 400,000 square feet of leases in the second quarter, its most in a quarter since 2019.\nBut despite the uptick in leasing, Paramount reported a net loss of $19.8 million for the second quarter, compared to $7.8 million a year prior. The losses included $7.5 million of expenses related to the acceleration of equity awards and severance payments.\nWho is Rithm?\n\nRithm was founded in 2013 as an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group with a focus on residential mortgage servicing under the name New Residential Investment.\nThe company internalized management and rebranded to Rithm in 2022. Since then, Rithm has gone on an acquisition spree. In 2023, Rithm acquired Sculptor Capital Management, which had $33 billion in assets under management. This month, Rithm inked a deal to buy Crestline Management, an alternative asset manager with $17 billion in assets.\nRithm now has $100 billion in investable assets. It lends across commercial and residential real estate.\nWhy did Rithm want to buy Paramount?\nRithm CEO Michael Nierenberg said on a call with analysts that the firm is seeking to diversify its investment strategies. Paramount presented a rare opportunity to acquire commercial real estate in gateway cities at a discount during a period when fundamentals are improving. Nierenberg repeatedly mentioned expected future rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. The cuts will lead to cap rate compression, allowing values to increase.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very bullish on office as we look at this so-called dislocated recovery trade or investment,\u201d said Nierenberg on the call.\nParamount\u2019s office towers are around 15 percent unoccupied with an additional 800,000 square feet of leases expiring in 2026, according to its investor presentation. Rithm can put in some upgrades, lease out the remaining space and hike rents, adding revenue to an existing portfolio.\n\u201cThis is\nan absolute value-add opportunity,\u201d said Dylan Burzinski, an analyst with Green Street Advisors, in an interview.\nRithm executives mentioned the deal will be balance sheet light in its call with analysts. In other words, the company will only use a portion of its own money to fund the deal and can raise money from co-investors and limited partners. Nierenberg said interest is already high. He added that Rithm could syndicate the whole deal if wanted to do so.\nRithm expects to 2x its investment.\nWhat does this mean for the NYC office market?\nRithm\u2019s offer could be looked at in one of two ways. It is either a huge testament to New York City\u2019s office recovery or a major disappointment for Paramount shareholders. Wall Street analysts covering Paramount have competing viewpoints.\nEvercore ISI analyst Steve Sakwa predicted Paramount was worth at least $7.58 a share and as much as $12, Crain\u2019s reported. Sakwa said Paramount shareholders may reject the offer based on the low offer.\nBut Dylan Burzinski, an analyst with Green Street, said Rithm\u2019s deal was in line with his team\u2019s expectations. He mentioned Rithm will likely have to put in a significant amount of money in capital improvements for Paramount\u2019s office buildings, which adds to the risk.\n\u201cThe public market just got a little bit ahead of itself in terms of where valuation would shake out,\u201d said Burzinski. \u201cThis is a very value-add portfolio.\u201d\nParamount claims to have a Class A portfolio. But the office market recovery has not spread across all office towers. Paramount\u2019s buildings are largely unrecognizable to most New Yorkers, most of which were built or redeveloped in the 1980s. It has no ultra-modern trophy asset like One Vanderbilt.\n\u201cWhat SL Green and Vornado [have] tends to be the best of the best in the New York City office. What Paramount has is good, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s as high of quality,\u201d said Burzinski.\nOverall, Burzinski said the reported interest in Paramount from big-name investors like SL Green, Vornado and Empire State Realty was a positive sign for the office market.\n\u201cOne year ago, I don\u2019t think you would have had that many buyers lined up wanting to take a look at this,\u201d said Burzinski. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good indicator that capital is looking more at office than in recent memory.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s next for Behler?\nIt seems hard to imagine Behler, who\u2019s been CEO of Paramount since 1991, will stay on when the deal closes. Most of the recent scrutiny surrounding Paramount stemmed from his cushy perks and unorthodox dealmaking. Rithm did not specifically mention Behler in its investor call. Nierenberg stressed that Paramount had a large management team.\nBut anything is possible. This is New York City real estate, crazier things have happened.\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s not actually called the Plumber Employment Act. But it should be.\nWhat other rationale could the City Council have for passing a bill on Thursday requiring a master plumber for basic installations of gas stoves and dryers?\nThe legislation could also be called the Keep Your Old Appliances Act.\nA basic rule of economics is that if you make something more expensive, you get less of it. Requiring a master plumber or specially qualified installers to put in a gas stove or dryer will add hundreds of dollars to the cost. As a result, landlords and homeowners will hold on to their old appliances longer.\nIf anything,\nIntro 429-A\nwill make New York more dangerous. Old gas stoves pollute indoor air and make people sick. Lint can build up in old dryers and vents, creating a fire hazard. The Council should be incentivizing replacement of old appliances, not discouraging them by dramatically raising installation costs.\nThe sponsor of the bill, Bronx Council member Pierina Ana Sanchez,\njustified it\nby pointing to an illegal gas hookup that led to an\nEast Village explosion\nin 2015.\nBut that tragedy was caused by amateurs running pipes from one building to another, not a standard stove or dryer installation that requires no piping to be moved. The city has already responded to the 2015 explosion by passing\nLocal Law 152\nof 2016, which mandates that multifamily buildings\u2019 gas pipes be checked by a master plumber every four years.\nSanchez\u2019s bill appears to drastically raise the usual $600 cost of those inspections by expanding them to include the point of connection to every gas appliance. It seems to me that instead of just popping in and out of the cellar, the master plumber would have to go into apartments and pull out every gas stove and dryer to check the connection.\nMy inquiry to Sanchez\u2019s office was not immediately answered.\nTo my knowledge, no tragedies have ever happened in New York City as a result of a standard stove or dryer replacement. These have generally been handled by a two-person crew that delivers appliances ordered from retailers such as PC Richard or AJ Madison.\n\nNow, crews will deliver, but not install, gas appliances; customers will have to find a master plumber on their own.\nI don\u2019t see how delivery crews will be able to haul off old appliances without disconnecting them from the gas valve, which would appear to violate this new law. So even replacing a gas unit with an electric one would require a master plumber.\nThink of how many thousands of basic appliance replacements have been made without a single one causing an explosion. What problem is Sanchez trying to solve, other than the potential lack of an endorsement by\nPlumbers Local No. 1\nfor her future political campaigns? The union pushed relentlessly for the bill, as did the\nPlumbing Foundation of New York City\nand Master Plumbers Council.\nSanchez knows that Mayor Eric Adams, who is making a desperate bid for re-election and welcomes union endorsements, is unlikely to veto the bill. But he should, because it increases costs. Also, his own Department of Buildings\ntestified against\nprovisions of the bill and has pointed out that only 1,100 master plumbers exist in a city of 8.6 million people. Why divert them to simple tasks?\nIncredibly, Sanchez claims her bill is merely a \u201c\nclarification\n\u201d that \u201cmakes explicit what has long been practice.\u201d What city has she been living in? In the Real World, gas appliances have routinely been replaced by people who are not licensed master plumbers.\nIt could have been worse. Sanchez\u2019s original\nIntro 429\ncalled for a licensed plumber to install dishwashers, garbage disposers and refrigerators with icemakers. These are also routinely installed without issue by appliance delivery people. The Real Estate Board of New York, as well as condominium and co-op interests, lobbied to narrow the bill\u2019s scope.\nMeanwhile, a similar battle lies ahead for the industry.\nCouncil member Farah Louis has\na bill\nrequiring owners of multiple dwellings to have a\nlicensed master plumber\nannually inspect all steam radiators in units with children under 6.\nLouis is responding to the death of an 11-month-old in her Brooklyn district. But her bill would\nimpose a great cost\non multifamily buildings, raising rents. And it likely would not prevent any deaths, as steam radiators are already inspected regularly and tragedies like\nthe one in Midwood\nare exceedingly rare.\n",

In 2018, the IMC affiliate paid $56 million for it, records show. Three years later, IMC sold a parking lot adjacent to the flea market for $16 million.\nFestival Marketplace closed in June.\nFoundry and Wheelock are planning Festival Logistics Park, a 474,000-square-foot complex divided into three buildings ranging from 60,000 square feet to 300,000 square feet, the release states. Demolition of the existing building and initial construction of the new project are slated to begin later this year, according to the joint venture. Festival Logistics Park\u2019s expected completion is in 2026.\n\nThe joint venture hired Nick Wigoda and Steve Medwin with Stream Realty Partners to lease up the planned industrial park, the release states.\nSince 2015, Foundry has developed and purchased $5 billion worth of commercial real estate assets across the country totaling 31 million square feet. The firm\u2019s south Florida portfolio is roughly 10 million square feet and more than $1.5 billion in project volume, the release states.\nIn July, Foundry and a real estate fund advised by Dallas-based Crow Holdings Capital paid\n$23.1 million\nfor a 10.2-acre parking lot near Festival Marketplace where the partnership is planning a pair of warehouses.\nSince its inception in 2005, Wheelock has acquired $11 billion-plus in real estate assets, primarily focusing on hospitality, industrial, retail and mixed-use projects, the firm\u2019s website states.\nThis month, Wheelock, Giles Capital Group, Rosemurgy Properties and Schmier Property Group sold the retail component of Uptown Boca, a mixed-use project in Boca Raton, for $118.4 million.

The move unwinds a deal the Garland City Council blessed in June, when it authorized a lease for city-owned land at Holford Road and the President George Bush Turnpike, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nAtl\u00e9tico Dallas envisioned a headquarters and training hub with a 2,000-seat \u201cshow pitch,\u201d academy fields, and a 28,000-square-foot building with team offices, locker rooms, therapy space and a dining hall. Plans also included futsal courts, a plaza and the possibility of a 127-acre sports and entertainment district nearby.\nExecutives called the reversal \u201cdeeply disappointing.\u201d Club co-founder Matt Valentine told the outlet that Garland residents had rallied around the project and that the decision \u201ccame out of left field.\u201d He added that Atl\u00e9tico had already been sourcing materials for the facility and offered to fund certain components privately to ease what he described as the city\u2019s \u201clegal concerns\u201d about the lease. Garland officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe proposed\nfinancing\nincluded $25 million for the fields, $20 million for the multipurpose building and $26 million for road improvements and a planned extension of Naaman Forest Boulevard. The club was also prepared to lease the complex from the city under a 20-year agreement with an annual rent of $75,000 for the fields with a 2.5 percent annual escalation\nWhile Garland was still in play, Atl\u00e9tico secured agreements with Dallas to stage home matches at the Cotton Bowl and to take over MoneyGram Soccer Park, a tournament hub at 2200 Walnut Hill Lane in Northwest Dallas. That arrangement won Dallas City Council approval in June. Valentine declined to say whether Garland\u2019s about-face was tied to the\nDallas\ndeal but acknowledged the timing raised questions.\nLosing\nGarland\nas a partner means the club\u2019s front office will look closer to Fair Park for its headquarters. Valentine said Atl\u00e9tico, currently operating out of Richardson, has begun scouting Dallas sites and expects to lean on MoneyGram for training.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Mayor Brandon Johnson scored a procedural win for his environmental agenda this week, moving a long-stalled zoning measure out of legislative purgatory.\nBut the fight over the\nHazel Johnson Cumulative Impacts Ordinance\nis far from over.\nThe city council voted to send the proposal to the zoning committee after it languished for months, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Named for the late Southeast Side environmental justice advocate, the ordinance would force developers seeking heavy industrial rezonings to study how projects would add to pollution in Black and Brown neighborhoods that already bear the brunt of emissions.\nSupporters cast it as a long-overdue check on environmental racism. Opponents \u2014 an unusual coalition of business groups and organized labor \u2014 say it could spook investors and threaten blue-collar jobs. The Johnson administration floated amendments last week clarifying that an environmental review board would only serve in an advisory role, not override city departments. But critics say the tweaks don\u2019t go far enough.\nThe opposition had planned to fight a motion to reroute the measure, but backed off after Alderman Julia Ramirez, a sponsor, agreed to further negotiations. Alderman Gilbert Villegas, who is against the ordinance as written, said he was encouraged by the compromise.\n\nChicago is trying to balance its economic development ambitions while advancing\ncommunity health\n. In the past, the city\u2019s patchwork approach to industrial zoning fueled frustration on both sides: developers face\nregulatory uncertainty\n, while residents fear being saddled with new smokestacks without meaningful input.\nDuring former Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s\nadministration\nthere was the General Iron saga \u2014 when the city first greenlit, then blocked, the scrap metal firm\u2019s move from Lincoln Park to the Southeast Side \u2014 remains a cautionary tale. That reversal triggered a hunger strike, multiple lawsuits and a claim for $100 million damages by the firm that is still winding through the courts.\nJack Lavin of the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce summed up the business position bluntly: companies need predictable rules before committing capital. Environmental advocates counter that predictability shouldn\u2019t come at the expense of neighborhoods already overburdened by pollution.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Meanwhile, the median rent for a two-bedroom climbed up to $5,000, a record for Zumper\u2019s reports which started tracking rents in 2016.\nYear over year, San Francisco topped the list for rent growth for a two-bedroom apartment, up 17.1 percent from last year. One-bedroom rent prices in the city were up 10.7 percent year-over-year, the third-highest increase nationally.\n\n\u201cThe\nAI boom\nhas brought an influx of\nhigh-paying jobs and investor activity\nback to San Francisco, fueling housing demand in a city where supply has long been constrained,\u201d Zumper spokesperson Crystal Chen told the Business Times. \u201cCombined with generally stricter\nreturn-to-office policies\n, it\u2019s not entirely surprising that the one-bedroom rent hit its pre-pandemic benchmark this year.\u201d\nIt\u2019s only a matter of time before median prices for a one-bedroom surpass the pre-pandemic record of $3,720 from June 2019. The city could leave its pre-pandemic records in the dust next year, Chen said, citing heightened renter demand and limited new housing supply as possible drivers of price increases.\nSan Francisco\u2019s rising rents are in stark contrast to nationwide trends. Rents across much of the country have either fallen or remained flat for the past three months, according to Zumper\u2019s National Rent Index.\nMeanwhile, as rents across San Francisco grow, home prices are trending in the opposite direction. They\u2019ve dropped to 2018 levels, according to the Business Times. Still, high home prices and mortgage rates as well as increasing insurance premiums have forced potential buyers to settle on renting for now.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "A partnership featuring billionaire Barry Sternlicht is putting on hold a request for zoning changes to the site of The Standard Spa, Miami Beach that would have allowed a major renovation of the hotel.\nThe Miami Beach City Commission was set to vote on the rezoning at its Sept. 16 meeting, but The Standard Spa, Miami Beach ownership group requested that the item be removed from the agenda, according to a letter obtained by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nFor the past year, plans to revamp the 100-key hotel at 40 Island Avenue have been embroiled in controversy tied to an agreement between the hotel\u2019s owner,\nNomade Lido\n, and the Belle Isle Residents Association that entailed a $1.2 million payment in exchange for the association\u2019s support.\nMiami Beach commissioner David Suarez has maintained that the deal may violate the city\u2019s ethics code barring any person or entity from receiving payments in exchange for securing government approvals.\nSternlicht\n, CEO of Miami Beach-based Starwood Capital Group, owns 15.4 percent of Nomade Lido. Other major partners include star architect Bjarke Ingels, Argentinian businessman and lawyer Antonio de la Rua, Argentinian hotelier Sebastian Sas and Miguel Isla, CEO of Miami Beach-based Nomade People and managing partner of\nThe Standard Spa, Miami Beach\n.\nMinority investors include tech billionaire and political activist Peter Thiel and his husband Matt Danzeisen, biotech investor Jeff Aronin, businessman Martin Franklin and former CEO of Softbank Group International Marcelo Claure.\n\n\u201cWhat should have been an honest, collaborative process has been poisoned by Commissioner Suarez\u2019s personal attacks, misinformation campaigns, and deliberate attempts to pit neighbor against neighbor,\u201d Isla said in an emailed statement to\nTRD\n. \u201cSuch conduct erodes the confidence that has been built for both residents and businesses who see Miami Beach as a place worthy of long-term investment.\u201d\nIsla made similar comments in a Sept. 17 correspondence with Miami Beach commissioner Laura Dominguez, who sponsored legislation to approve the rezoning, which would allow Nomade Lido to add condo units to The Standard Spa, Miami Beach. Isla requested that Dominguez not move forward with the item.\n\u201cI believe it is in the best interest of our community that you withdraw the pending item from further consideration,\u201d Isla wrote. \u201cWe will seek to move the project forward in a different way and not under the duress, distortions and smears of those seeking to make headlines.\u201d\nIn a recent newsletter to his constituents, Suarez took credit for Nomade Lido\u2019s retreat. \u201cThe bottom line is this: we stopped The Standard\u2019s upzoning scheme,\u201d Suarez wrote in the newsletter. \u201cResidents spoke out, the truth came to light, and once exposed to public scrutiny, the developer backed down.\u201d\nNomade Lido planned to replace the east wing of\nThe Standard Spa, Miami Beach\nwith a five-story building featuring six luxury condos, 50 hotel rooms and 66 parking spaces. The hotel owner also sought to renovate the three-story west wing, including reducing the room count to 50 from 67, according to plans filed with the city.\nHowever, Suarez was adamantly opposed to the renovation plan largely due to the previously undisclosed deal between Nomade Lido and Belle Isle Residents Association, or BIRA. Nomade Lido had agreed to pay a nonprofit entity created by BIRA\n$1.2 million\nin three separate installments for public improvements to Belle Isle, the Miami Beach neighborhood that is home to the hotel.",

Prager has yet to file a motion objecting to the sale, with a deadline of Oct. 24.\nNeither Prager, GreenState nor attorneys for the investors in Wisconsin nursing homes who are suing Opal returned requests for comment.\nGreenState entered the picture after buying the loan note tied to the Corporate 500 property\u2019s leasehold interest, which is separately owned from the ground beneath it \u2014 such bifurcations were implemented frequently by Prager and his investment partner Katherine Cartagena during their buying spree.\nIn the case of the Deerfield property, Prager\u2019s Opal took out a $104 million loan from Unify Financial Credit Union to buy the building portion of the property, while also entering a 99-year ground lease with a Cartagena-led entity serving as landlord of the dirt. Prager\u2019s building ownership was set to pay annual rents to Cartagena\u2019s entity starting at $4.8 million per year in 2022, with 2 percent annual hikes as part of the deal.\nBut Prager allegedly defaulted on the leasehold loan from Unify in 2023, leading to a $106 million foreclosure lawsuit against the property\u2019s ownership.\nAlthough Prager initially tried to fight the foreclosure and the appointment of a receiver, a judge found Opal to be in default on the debt, and issued a $130 million judgment against the landlord that accounted for interest and fees. It\u2019s unclear how much GreenState paid Unify to take over the troubled loan note, but it was likely at a substantial discount to its face value.\nGreenState was able to use the judgment to make a credit bid for $66 million for the property at last month\u2019s sheriff\u2019s sale, meaning $64 million is still owed by the leasehold owner, a Prager affiliate, court records show.\n\nMeanwhile, Opal lost an initial ruling while trying to beat back the Wisconsin nursing homes investors\u2019 claims that they were shorted on payments by Prager\u2019s firm for years on deals involving four properties in small towns.\nA lawsuit the investors filed in a New Jersey court earlier this year alleged Opal transferred $860,000 out of the nursing homes to other parties, despite claiming the properties generated negative income of nearly $5 million between 2022 and 2024. The investors who sued say they were owed base rent payments by Opal as part of the operating agreements for the nursing homes, but that they were ignored. Simultaneously, unpaid property tax bills and assessments owed to the state of Wisconsin Department of Health Services stacked up, and the investors claim Opal owes more than $3 million to the state.\nWhile the New Jersey lawsuit was settled without prejudice earlier this year, meaning the claims could be revived later on, the investors have similar allegations against Opal moving forward through a suit in Wisconsin court. The investors are the funders of entities called GPH Fort Atkinson LLC; GPH Greenfield LLC; GPH Muscoda LLC; and Silver Spring Acquisition LLC.\nAt the nursing home Opal was operating in Fort Atkinson, deferred maintenance and a lack of repairs led to the property being named a \u201cSpecial Focus Facility\u201d under a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services program meant to get problematic assets back on track.\n\u201cThe Special Focus Facility program designates nursing facilities that have had a history of serious quality problems for increased visitations by state surveyors and more stringent enforcement actions for deficiencies identified by those state surveyors,\u201d the investors said in their suit. \u201cIn Wisconsin, only two of the approximately 330 nursing facilities in the state are designated as Special Focus Facilities.\u201d\nTwo more of the Opal-run facilities became candidates for the Special Focus program, the investors said. As of late last year, each of the facilities was under either an active designation or a candidate for the \u201cDenial of Payment for New Admissions\u201d designation by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, meaning the properties were suspended or close to being suspended from the right to receive reimbursement for admitting new Medicare patients.\nAs of Thursday, the Fort Atkinson property remains under the Special Focus designation, while another, the Silver Springs Health Care Center in Glendale, is still a candidate, according to\na list\npublished by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid.\nA Wisconsin federal judge denied Opal\u2019s motion to dismiss the allegations earlier this summer. The landlord has since answered the investors\u2019 complaint and raised affirmative defenses, including that they didn\u2019t take reasonable steps to reduce their own losses; that Opal may have had reasons for not paying the investors; and that Opal already paid at least some of what the investors say they are owed.\nThe parties have been tasked with working toward a settlement and, if unable to reach one, completing written discovery in the case by May.\nBack in suburban Chicago, however, the Corporate 500 property\u2019s financial health seems to be improving. During the foreclosure proceedings against Opal, the property\nlured a tenant to lease the entire campus\n, with the help of Illinois tax incentives. Vantive, a kidney care spinoff of medical device giant Baxter International, is set to invest $23 million into the property and make it a headquarters.\nThe lease was agreed to while the property was in control of a court-appointed receiver, and details of the deal have been obscured by the receiver\u2019s heavily redacted reports to the judge. It\u2019s unclear whether Prager, his partner Cartagena\u2019s ground landlord entity, GreenState or none of them will reap the benefits of the massive lease.\n",

        "content": "A Bay Area prep school is turning to municipal bonds to redevelop the historic anchor property of its campus on the San Francisco Peninsula.\nCrystal Springs Uplands School, located at 400 Uplands Drive in Hillsborough, is borrowing $26 million in\nmuni bonds\nto revamp the Uplands Mansion, a century-old former home, Bloomberg\nreported\n.\nThe $26 million from the California Enterprise Development Authority will help pay for the nearly $50 million makeover of the mansion that has served as the school\u2019s educational hub for nearly seven decades, according to Bloomberg.\n\u201cThis is really modernizing all of our teaching spaces,\u201d Brian Talbott, chief financial and operating officer of the school, told Bloomberg. \u201cClasses were being taught in rooms that were formerly bedrooms, and we had offices in rooms that were clearly formerly bathrooms, including multiple spaces where bathtubs were still in the person\u2019s office. So it was still very much a house.\u201d\nBuilt in 1917 for the grandson of railroad tycoon Charles Crocker, the Uplands Mansion features high-end touches like handmade marble fixtures from a 16th-century Italian castle. Crystal Springs acquired the mansion in 1956 as the first permanent location for the private school. It was originally founded as a girls\u2019 school and went co-ed in 1977.\nIn the years since then, Crystal Springs has built various facilities including a gymnasium, theater and artificial turf field on the 10 acres of land surrounding the mansion. It also grew into a second campus for its middle school. Today, the Uplands Mansion is now the centerpiece of the upper school campus, hosting several classrooms, offices and meeting spaces as well as a library.\n\nWith the funding injection, the school will renovate the building to add a modernized robotics workshop, physics lab and elevator, as well as structural improvements like a new HVAC system.\nThe $26 million deal marks Crystal Springs\u2019 first venture into the muni market for financing, having worked with private banks in the past to build its second location in\nBelmont\n. Other private schools similarly dove into the muni market last year after the 2023 banking crisis.\n\u201cWe have a loan with\nFirst Citizens Bank, formerly Silicon Valley Bank\n, on our middle school campus here,\u201d Talbott said. \u201cAs we started looking at our financing needs for the project at our upper school on the mansion, we explored essentially another loan with First Citizens as well as a debt offering.\u201d\nNaturally, the\ncollapse of Silicon Valley Bank\nduring the 2023 crisis made the school wary of working with a private bank again. \u201cThat did give pause, not just to us, but I imagine to many independent schools just because the market changed,\u201d Talbott said. \u201cHaving different options made a lot of sense then and still makes sense to my mind.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Rubin was arrested at his home in Fairfield, Connecticut. He also faces a bank fraud charge for allegedly lying to a lender about ongoing litigation while securing a mortgage for Powers\u2019 Texas home, which he financed.\nLawyers for Rubin and Powers declined to comment.\nThe case adds a criminal chapter to years of civil\nlitigation\nagainst Rubin. In 2022, he was ordered to pay $3.85 million to women who testified they were lured to his Manhattan penthouse for abusive encounters. His attorneys argued the women had consented and signed agreements, but a Brooklyn jury found him liable for sex trafficking and battery.\n\nProsecutors now allege Rubin and Powers ran a scheme that spanned a decade, arranging travel for women to meet Rubin under false pretenses.\nRubin\u2019s career trajectory once epitomized the excesses and innovations of 1980s Wall Street. At Salomon Brothers, he helped pioneer the collateralized mortgage obligation, a derivative that reshaped global finance. Lewis portrayed him in \u201cLiar\u2019s Poker\u201d as a cerebral young trader who analyzed homeowner behavior to predict mortgage prepayments. Rubin later parlayed that expertise into a $1 million-a-year deal at\nMerrill Lynch\n, before stints at Bear Stearns and, eventually,\nSoros Fund Management\n, where he ran mortgage-backed securities until 2015.\nRubin\u2019s name, once associated with financial engineering that fueled decades of real estate and credit growth, is now linked to an alleged criminal enterprise of coercion and abuse. His case also highlights the vulnerability of women recruited into sex work under the guise of consensual arrangements \u2014 a dynamic prosecutors say Rubin exploited with his wealth and power.\nIf convicted, Rubin faces the possibility of a lengthy prison sentence.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The building boasts valet parking \u2014 a notable draw for a gym company known for attracting high-end clients.\nEquinox\nis gearing up to occupy a 30,000-square-foot retail space on the ground floor of an under-construction apartment building in Santa Monica. The Related-developed mixed-use building at 700 Broadway will include 196 apartments with luxury concierge services for residents. The new location is planned to open later this year.\nGold\u2019s Gym\nrecently had a soft opening for a 33,000-square-foot ground-level operation at the Beverly Center in Beverly Grove, according to CoStar. That location\u2019s opening comes about a year after Gold\u2019s opened a similarly sized 35,000-square-foot outpost at The Pike Outlets in Long Beach.\n\nPlanet Fitness, meanwhile, is picking up smaller spaces in suburban areas like Palmdale and Santa Clarita.\nVacant Rite Aid locations\nwith an average of 15,000 square feet appear to be Planet Fitness\u2019 spaces of choice.\nFor context, gym operators in Los Angeles typically sign leases for 5,000 square feet, according to CoStar. After the pandemic forced gym closures and decreased traffic for safety, it appears that the fitness business sector could be on the up and up. At the same time, retail vacancy ticked up in the second quarter to 5.6 percent, according to Kidder Mathews\u2019 Q2\nreport\n.\nFitness memberships climbed to a record 77 million last year from 72.9 million the year before, according to CoStar, citing data from the Health &amp; Fitness Association. In the first half of 2025, gym visits increased 3.5 percent compared to the first half of 2024.\nEquinox and Barry\u2019s Bootcamp are among the brands looking to capitalize on the growing demand for workout space. Last month, for example, Equinox\nsigned a similar 35,000-square-foot lease in Fort Lauderdale\n, Florida. Barry\u2019s is looking at opening 20 new studios annually in the coming years, according to CoStar.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "After a\nwhirlwind week of public meetings\n, Chicago real estate leaders are voicing concern about a new anti-gentrification ordinance that gives some South Side tenants in buildings with 10 or more units the right of first refusal when property owners look to sell.\nAs a result, City Council plans to host hearings on the ordinance, known as the Jackson Park Housing Pilot Program, next month, according to sources familiar with the city\u2019s plans.\n\u201cWe oppose the Jackson Park Housing Pilot Program ordinance and its onerous provisions for a tenant right of first refusal, but we are pleased that the City Council, under the leadership of Alderman Gilbert Villegas, will hold hearings on this policy. We are confident the hearings will lead to meaningful reforms,\u201d said Michael Glasser, president of the Neighborhood Building Owners Alliance lobbying group.\nVillegas did not respond to requests for comment regarding specific details of the hearings.\nCity council on Thursday passed the program that gives tenants in buildings with more than 10 units the right of first refusal, among other features aimed at preventing resident displacement. The new policies apply to much of the South Shore and Woodlawn neighborhoods.\nCritics have said giving tenants 180 days to form a union and purchase a building will slow down the sale process regardless of whether or not they\u2019re interested in banding together to buy the property. The possibility could deter future investment as well, opponents added.\n\u201cI imagine banks would not like that. Banks don\u2019t really like anything new and that provision is only going to kind of make it a little harder to get a deal done, and deals are already hard to get done,\u201d said Craig Yarborough of South Side-based Click Development.\n\nThe new ordinance is similar to another anti-gentrification effort that recently took effect in some Northwest Side neighborhoods known as the Northwest Side Housing Preservation Ordinance. Villegas\nrequested that his ward be removed\nfrom its purview, as did Alderman Felix Cardona Jr.\n\u201cIf a prospective buyer needs to wait 180 days from an offer, there will be no buyers. Owners will not invest and banks will not lend with this obstacle and why would they? It limits liquidity for the parties,\u201d David Goss, co-founder of multifamily brokerage Interra Realty, said on social media. \u201cLook no further than the northwest side of Chicago where this ROFR has been such an abject failure that two aldermen removed their wards.\u201d\nSo far, no South Side aldermen have opposed the Jackson Park ordinance.\nBut at least one developer has cited the Northwest Side Preservation Ordinance as reason not to build in the area.\n\u201cAs the person that does acquisitions, that\u2019s probably an area we wouldn\u2019t really target right now because of that. It just adds complication \u2026 and we operate at very low margins. We\u2019re a nonprofit. We\u2019re not maximizing rent,\u201d said Russell Rydin, COO of nonprofit affordable housing development firm Chicago Metropolitan Housing Development Corporation.\nProponents of the Jackson Park plan, which also calls for the sale of vacant city-owned lots for redevelopment into multifamily housing, say it\u2019s a necessary backstop ahead of the opening of the Obama Presidential Library, which is expected to drive investment to the area that could raise property values and, thus, taxes that burden low-income households and lead to their exits from the neighborhood.\n\u201cAnybody who does not want to support this or be a part of the solution, you are part of the problem,\u201d Alderwoman Jeanette Taylor of the 20th Ward said at\na Wednesday committee meeting\nreviewing the ordinance.\nWhile the new rule identifies 184 city-owned lots for potential redevelopment into multifamily residences, the right of first refusal could give some developers pause.\n\u201cInstead of addressing supply challenges, policies like this only make the problem worse. Chicago doesn\u2019t have a demand issue, it has a supply issue,\u201d KMA Properties president Devin Rowland wrote on social media. \u201cUntil policy shifts toward encouraging development and investment, affordability and growth will remain out of reach.\u201d",

        "content": "The lure of a Salesforce tower sublease is blowing Wind Point Partners away from its longtime Magnificent Mile office for a shiny perch along the river.\nThe Chicago-based private equity firm is in advanced talks to sublease about 24,000 square feet at\nSalesforce Tower\n, the 60-story building at 333 West Wolf Point Plaza, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. If completed, Wind Point would leave its offices at 676 North Michigan Avenue, continuing the broader trend of firms abandoning the corridor for modern spaces clustered near transit and the city\u2019s central business hub.\nSan Francisco-based Salesforce has been marketing roughly 120,000 square feet it leased two-and-a-half years ago but\nnever occupied\nin the 1.2 million-square-foot Wolf Point Plaza tower.\nNewmark\ngrabbed a portion of that space this summer, making Wind Point the latest tenant to buy into the appeal of Chicago\u2019s newest office skyscraper.\nThe tower was developed by Hines and Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises and delivered in 2023.\nIn the Loop submarket, even as overall office vacancy hovers near record highs, demand for premium buildings has pushed rents at trophy towers up 26 percent since 2020, according to Colliers. In contrast, average asking rents across downtown have barely budged.\nMag Mile landlords, meanwhile, are\nlosing ground\n. A generation ago, ad agencies and creative shops filled its towers, but much of that demand has been replaced by health care institutions looking for clinics and admin space in Streeterville. Some traditional office landlords have been forced to pivot entirely: Connecticut-based Marc Realty recently bought the mostly vacant 500 North Michigan Avenue to convert its offices into 320 apartments.\n\nWind Point would not be the first private equity firm to bail on 676 North Michigan. Flexpoint Ford decamped for Wacker Drive late last year. The tower, which also houses the Omni Chicago Hotel, has struggled to hold onto tenants as firms gravitate toward newer glass-and-steel high-rises. TRT Holdings, the Dallas-based owner, did not return a request for comment.\nFounded in 1984, Wind Point manages about $6 billion in assets and raised its largest fund ever \u2014 $2.3 billion \u2014 last year. Savills brokers Brandon Nasatir and John Goodman are representing the firm in lease negotiations, while CBRE is marketing Salesforce\u2019s sublease space.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The family behind Dallas\u2019 NorthPark Center is close to sealing a $900 million refinancing that would restructure the mall\u2019s debt and buy out its institutional partner, bringing full ownership back to the Nasher-Haemisegger clan for the first time in a decade.\nA Fitch Ratings presale report shows the family lined up a two-year, floating-rate CMBS loan from Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, plus $300 million in mezzanine financing, Bisnow\nreported\n. Proceeds will wipe out $650 million of old debt and acquire J.P. Morgan Asset Management\u2019s 60 percent equity stake in the mall, at 8687 North Central Expressway. The bank bought into the 1.9 million-square-foot property in 2014 through its Strategic Property Fund.\nNorthPark \u2014 developed in 1965 by\nRaymond Nasher\nand now operated by his daughter Nancy Nasher and her husband David Haemisegger through NorthPark Management Company \u2014 is one of the most successful malls in the country. Cushman &amp; Wakefield appraised it at $1.6 billion in August, pegging the debt package at a 55.5 percent loan-to-value ratio, or 63.5 percent when mezzanine loans are included. The mall generated $1.4 billion in sales last year, with anchors\nDillard\u2019s\n, Macy\u2019s, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Eataly and AMC accounting for $499 million of that haul.\n\nNorthPark is almost fully leased. Occupancy hit nearly 99 percent in June, and it hasn\u2019t dipped below 93 percent in the past decade. Nearly 40 percent of tenants are exclusive to the mall within the Dallas market, helping drive repeat traffic despite a crowded luxury landscape. CBRE\u2019s Elizabeth Herman Fulton said the property\u2019s private ownership structure allows for an unusually curated tenant mix, keeping NorthPark \u201ccool\u201d while other regional malls have lost their luster.\nThe Nasher-Haemiseggers have invested more than $25 million into capital improvements, including a south exterior revamp in 2018 and roof and HVAC replacements last year. Only Galleria Dallas and Grapevine Mills boast similar occupancy levels in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metro, according to Fitch.\nStill, competition looms. Just south, along Knox Street and Henderson Avenue, two\nmixed-use projects\nare slated to deliver about 180,000 square feet of high-end retail and dining next year.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher",

He\nbought the property\nat 809 Madison on the Upper East Side\u2019s \u201cGold Coast\u201d from Churchill Real Estate Holdings for $49 million.\nOne obstacle to the site is the Landmarks Preservation Commission, but Macklowe was able to get the LPC on board with his plans, sources told\nThe Real Deal\n, which include using air rights he acquired to expand the building and convert it into large, 4,000-square-foot single-floor apartments.\nMacklowe, who turned 88 last month, hasn\u2019t launched a Manhattan development project in a decade, when he bought One Wall Street for $585 million. The $2 billion conversion project has had its ups and downs, but after a period of slow sales, there\u2019s been\nan increase in contracts\n.\n\nCasino developments, however, will not be in the cards for Manhattan. A community advisory committee\ndashed\nthe Soloviev Group\u2019s hopes for a casino on a vacant lot near the United Nations building, voting against the proposal by a 4-2 tally.\nThe Freedom Plaza project was the third casino to be rolled out of Manhattan over the course of a couple of weeks, adding to defeats suffered by SL Green (Times Square) and Silverstein Properties (Far West Side).\nThe \u201cracinos\u201d had\nfar better luck\nlater in the week. MGM Empire City in Yonkers and the Queens Aqueduct Casino, operated by Resorts World, received unanimous approval from their CACs, moving their casino proposals on to the state gaming commission.\nShould they secure downstate gaming licenses, as expected, there would be one left up for grabs. Among those wanting it: Steve Cohen in Queens, Bally\u2019s in the Bronx and Joe Sitt in Brooklyn.\nAnd finally, on the celebrity real estate front, Sabrina Carpenter has a new home for her to offer prospective suitors a \u201cHouse Tour.\u201d\nAn entity tied to Carpenter, who is touring a recent album release, closed on a duplex at 108 Leonard Street for\nnearly $10 million\n.\nThe 2,900-square-foot pad is connected by a private elevator and features four private terraces. The home comes with three bedrooms and three full bathrooms.\n",

        "content": "Compass\u2019 quest for dominance\nis no industry secret, but it pulled off a shocking reveal.\nThe nation\u2019s largest brokerage by sales volume announced on Monday that it would merge with the industry\u2019s No. 2 heavy hitter, Anywhere Real Estate.\nThe acquisition, set to close next year, values Anywhere at\n$1.6 billion\nand would put Compass CEO Robert Reffkin at the helm of the titanic brokerage with his firm holding on to 78 percent of the ownership. Together, the agent count of the two firms would total around 340,000, and the companies, once combined, estimated their enterprise value at a whopping $10 billion.\nNews of the deal\nsent shockwaves\nacross the industry and raised questions about the duo\u2019s control over the residential market, especially in markets where the firms are most active.\nIn New York City, Anywhere is better known through its subsidiaries, some of which are among the city\u2019s top-producing brokerages. A deal to combine it with Compass would bring the two leading firms in Manhattan and Brooklyn under the same umbrella.\nTogether, Compass and Corcoran closed more than $9 billion in sell-side deals in Manhattan and $3.2 billion in Brooklyn in 2024, according to\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nlatest ranking\nof the city\u2019s top brokerages.\nCompass and Anywhere\u2019s brands and franchises accounted for roughly $15 billion in on-market, sell-side transactions across Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens last year \u2014 about 26 percent of the $57 billion in deals closed in the boroughs during the same time period.\nCompass, three Anywhere brands \u2014 Corcoran, Sotheby\u2019s International and Coldwell Banker Warburg \u2014 and Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, which Compass acquired this year, were among the top 10 brokerages in Manhattan with a combined sales volume of roughly $11 billion.\nThough the companies represent just a quarter of the total volume across the three boroughs, their presence in the luxury market is likely more outsized, as Compass, Corcoran and Sotheby\u2019s International Real Estate are leaders in those markets.\nMamdani or not, NYC real estate is doing just fine\nThat\u2019s the sentiment Compass agent Heather Domi expressed at a panel discussion on Thursday hosted by the New York Residential Agent Continuum, an organization she helped found in 2018, and the Master Brokers Forum in Miami.\n\u201cNever bet against New York City and New Yorkers,\u201d Domi said, referencing a quote from Barbara Corcoran. \u201cThat has held true time and time and time again. We will be fine.\u201d\n\nLuxury brokers seized on the Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani to hypothesize that wealthy New Yorkers could ditch the city for greener, more tax- and business-friendly, pastures. Some South Florida-based agents have jumped on the bandwagon, with one top broker, Dina Goldentayer,\ntaking out an ad\nin Times Square urging Manhattanites to move to Miami.\n\u201cI love New York and I want New York to always, always shine,\u201d said Alicia Cervera Lamadrid of Florida-based Cervera Real Estate. \u201cI am not excited about your mayoral election. I am terrified.\u201d\n\u201cBut New York\u2019s success is Miami\u2019s success,\u201d she added.\nDomi said she has seen contract activity in the Big Apple\nhas dipped\n22 percent year-over-year in the first three weeks of September, a drop-off she attributed, in part, to a hesitancy in the market ahead of the mayoral election in November.\nBut even if the numbers show signs of slowing down, Domi said that deals are still coming in and her business is running full steam ahead.\n\u201cWe are getting impacted,\u201d Domi said. \u201cBut anecdotally, we\u2019ve got lower interest rates, and I\u2019m super busy. People who have been dragging their feet and waiting are now pulling the trigger.\u201d\nSerhant expands to the Ocean State\nRyan Serhant is continuing his\nEast Coast sprawl\nwith an outpost in Rhode Island.\nThe celebrity broker is opening an office in Newport, Rhode Island, in October, HousingWire first reported on Friday. He\u2019s launching his eponymous firm in the tony New England beach town with five founding agents who, together, notched roughly $550 million in sales over the past 12 months.\nSerhant\u2019s latest expansion marks the 13th state where the brokerage now has operations after the firm started spreading its reach beyond New York City two years ago. The brokerage initially set up shops along the East Coast, though it has since planted its flag in Arizona.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe priciest deal to hit the city register this week was for a co-op at 998 Fifth Avenue, which sold for roughly\n$38 million\n. Evan Cheng, the co-founder of a cryptocurrency company, bought the four-bedroom apartment from cosmetics heir William Lauder in an off-market deal.\nLauder, the grandchild of the Est\u00e9e Lauder founders, purchased Unit 6W for about $24 million in 2017. The co-op also features five bathrooms, an eat-in kitchen and views of Central Park.\n",

        "content": "Want a\nhot take\non Compass\u2019 $1.6 billion deal for Anywhere Real Estate that you haven\u2019t already heard?\nLet\u2019s start from the top and work our way down.\nAn industry veteran in L.A.\u2019s high end jumped a few steps forward to conjecture about the end game. No, that doesn\u2019t mean market share and stamping out competition. Those are the tactics to achieve the strategic end of Compass creating a proprietary marketplace that gives them more control over splits, suggested this executive, who requested anonymity.\n\u201cI suspect this is not about creating a bigger brokerage per se because, at least for the foreseeable future, you would just have a bigger, less profitable brokerage with a lot of debt,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is more about Compass positioning itself to better overturn Clear Cooperation and become a real estate search \u2018portal\u2019 with listings no one else has.\n\u201cIf this is successful, they will create a direct link with the consumer and use that link to \u2018sell\u2019 that consumer back to the agent in the form of a lower percentage of the commission. What the agents fail to understand is that this is the first play in a long game to reduce their splits. I do not expect Compass to admit this.\u201d\nEveryone\u2019s been dissecting the consumer-facing implications of market-share consolidation. This view speculates that Compass will use scale of listings to roll back the generous splits that have been used by Compass and others to woo and retain star agents.\nAfter all, once you\u2019re large enough, rubbing a star Beverly Hills or Malibu agent the wrong way may not matter like it still does these days.\nRedundancies and such\nRent and staff.\nThey\u2019re the two biggest expenses on a balance sheet, Nourmand &amp; Associates President Michael Nourmand pointed out this past week in chatting about the Compass-Anywhere news. They\u2019re also the first things to be scrutinized when reducing expenditures.\nThis is M&amp;A 101,\u201d Nourmand said. \u201cWhat is M&amp;A 101? The first thing you do is say, \u2018Nothing\u2019s going to change\u2019 and then you slowly make changes, and you try to plan them out and make them incremental enough that people say, \u2018Oh, well, we had to move offices, but I still have my manager so it\u2019s OK.\u2019 And then \u2018Oh, the marketing guy or marketing lady I really liked they got rid of her, but I heard this other one\u2019s good.\u2019 [Compass] didn\u2019t come and make this bold, risky acquisition to let the brands be independent. You buy companies to make changes.\u201d\nIn fact, rent across what would be the combined entity\u2019s brokerage brand portfolio was one of the first subjects brought up by those who weighed in on the Compass-Anywhere deal this week.\n\u201cYou have too many of the same thing in the same area,\u201d said Westside Estate Agency co-founder Stephen Shapiro, \u201cIf it were me, I\u2019d be consolidating. Rents aren\u2019t cheap and then you have to have staffing. You have to have computers. You have to have telephones and all the things it takes to run an office. It\u2019s unwieldy.\u201d\nPlease, sir, can I have more paper clips?\nThe pending deal and the presence of so many major boutique players in L.A. leads to the question of what makes people tick and why some choose to remain fiercely\nindependent\n.\nSo, I asked\nWestside Estate Agency\nco-founder Stephen Shapiro why. He and business partner Kurt Rappaport have remained independent for the past 26 years.\n\u201cOnce you own your own ship and you make your own decisions, you don\u2019t want to go and make a request to New York or New Jersey for paper clips,\u201d Shapiro said.\nOther factors range from risk tolerance to maintaining speed of operations.\n\u201cOver the years, we have fielded offers to buy us out, but it never made any sense to lose the independence,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cSome years we make a lot of money. Some years we don\u2019t make any money, but that\u2019s up to us to decide what happens at the end of the day. I can\u2019t imagine having to talk to some regional manager to say \u2018Oh, I came across a great new video program. How do we get to use this?\u2019 and then not getting an answer. It\u2019s not the nature of the owner of an independent business unless you\u2019re paid enough to walk away. And you\u2019re not paid enough to walk away because everything is based on future performance.\u201d\n\nFor as much talk of tech as the differentiator in nearly any business, WEA and others like it tout a more personalized route.\n\u201cWhen one of my agents has a problem, they have me to come to,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cThey have Kurt [Rappaport] to come to. They have [executive vice president and general manager] Colin [Keenan] to come to. Between me and Kurt, there\u2019s no deal that could possibly be made that we haven\u2019t been a part of one just like it and know how to answer.\u201d\nHiltons head to Compass\nAs many ponder whether\nboutiques\nwill benefit from corporate brokerage consolidation,\nBarron Hilton and Tessa Hilton\nwent another way. They announced their jump to Compass on Thursday.\nIntriguing move.\nThe Hiltons were co-founders and co-CEOs of Beverly Hills-based Hilton Hilton. Their departure leaves co-founder and Hilton Hilton chair\nRick Hilton\nnow steering the ship.\nStatements provided to\nThe Real Deal\nfrom Barron and Tessa Hilton, who were unavailable for an interview, offered some additional insight on their decision.\n\u201cWe are making a strategic move to Compass to position not only ourselves, but most importantly our clients, for long-term success in an increasingly competitive market,\u201d the Hiltons said.\nThe husband-and-wife duo will be based in Beverly Hills and will also have a presence in Palm Beach with plans to expand in additional markets.\nHow many Hilton Hilton agents follow the couple to Compass or move elsewhere is likely to play out over the coming weeks and months.\nWhat Mark said\nOne more for the road,\u00a0 sticking with the Compass-Anywhere theme.\nIn case you missed it,\nTRD\ncaught up with former Compass California president and, more recently, chief real estate strategist Mark McLaughlin earlier this month after it was learned the executive had transitioned to a part-time mergers and acquisitions\nadvisory role\nat the brokerage.\nDigging into the\nsubject of M&amp;A\n, McLaughlin projected the pace of deals could quicken beyond what the industry\u2019s seen the past couple of years.\nResidential brokerages, McLaughlin said, generally trade at a multiple of 3 to 5.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. But, today\u2019s M&amp;A deals aren\u2019t simple multiplication.\nNon-recurring expenses must be factored in. That includes legal fees or last year\u2019s National Association of Realtors-related commission settlement that can impact EBITDA, which is used to gauge a business\u2019s cash flow, ability to pay down debt or valuation.\n\u201cThe thing you have to keep in context is four years ago, five years ago, the negotiation between buyer and seller was, \u2018What\u2019s my multiple of EBITDA going to be?\u2019\u201d McLaughlin said at the time. \u201cNow, it\u2019s \u2018How many adjustments can I make to my EBITDA so we can work out a deal?\u2019\u201d\nIf McLaughlin is correct, let\u2019s see what else emerges on the sales block.\n",

        "content": "Fights over multifamily policy, suburban retail revival and fresh investment in the office sector shaped Chicago real estate markets this week. From Fulton Market to Burr Ridge to South Shore, here\u2019s what mattered.\nThe drama surrounding embattled multifamily firm CKO Real Estate escalated when its\nex-investor Shai Wolkowicki\nlobbed a $10.8 million lawsuit at\nfounder Chikoo Patel, accusing him of running the firm as a \u201cPonzi-like scheme.\u201d\nThe allegations \u2014 misuse of investor funds, siphoning money into personal accounts \u2014 read like a playbook from the worst days of cheap credit. The dispute extends a trend of lawsuits popping up nationally as cracks form in the multifamily syndication boom of the last five years that thrived on low rates and easy money.\nIn Fulton Market,\nSterling Bay\nunloaded an\nentitled development site for $18 million\n, taking a loss from its previous purchase price. Local investor Marc Bortz was the buyer. While still the hottest ZIP in town for trophy developments,\nFulton Market land prices\nare cooling as rising construction and operational costs reset property values everywhere.\nSuburban retail told the opposite story. Edward Hassan and\nAdam Firsel\nsold the once-distressed\nBurr Ridge Village Center for $55 million\n, notching a tidy payday that shows how open air commerce centers have become a winner amid\nbrick and mortar retail\u2019s rebound\n.\nAlso in Burr Ridge, the late rapper\nJuice WRLD\u2019s mother listed her estate for $7.2 million\nafter three years of owning the home, which is currently the second-priciest listing in the western suburb, behind a\n$10 million ask\n.\n\nAt Chicago\u2019s high end, a\nSt. Regis penthouse fetched $7.5 million\n, another data point showing Chicago\u2019s ultra-luxury condo market is climbing out from a hole. A West Loop penthouse condo in a\nSulo Development project\nthis week also fetched over $5.2 million as raw space, meaning the sellers are likely to spend significantly more on finishing the unit.\nChicago residential brokers were\nbuzzing about the planned Compass acquisition\nof Anywhere Real Estate and its impact on the local market. The tie-up\nconsolidates power\nin an industry already wrestling with commission lawsuits and shifting consumer behavior.\nOn the policy front, activists scored wins in the Housing Committee and Chicago City Council this week by pushing\nSouth Side right-of-first-refusal and just-cause eviction rules\n. Landlords and investors, unsurprisingly, are\ngearing up to fight\n. Chicago\u2019s battle lines\necho national trends as cities from Washington D.C. to San Francisco debate\nsimilar anti-gentrification tools.\nThe office market produced two substantial Chicago investments, one a purchase and another a lease.\n601W Companies is circling the\nlong-distressed Brookfield-owned property at 175 West Jackson Boulevard\n. The New York-based buyer has\nmade a business of scooping up Chicago\u2019s troubled towers\n, and its latest move fits a broader national playbook: opportunistic capital targeting landlords caught on refinancing cliffs.\nMeanwhile, private equity firm\nWind Point Partners is subleasing office space in Salesforce Tower\n, highlighting how trophy assets are weathering the storm. The deal underscores a national trend \u2014 even as office demand slumps, the newest Class A towers are still drawing tenants from weaker buildings.",

        "content": "Things just keep getting worse for Norman Kravetz.\nThe Realty Bancorp Equities principal defaulted this summer on the commercial mortgage-backed securities debt connected to a five-office-property portfolio, and now faces calls to cede control to a court-appointed receiver.\nThe calls are coming via a Wells Fargo Bank unit on behalf of the commercial mortgage-backed securities holders.\nKravetz-linked entities are on the hook for around $70 million, which is more than five-building portfolio is worth.\nThe 346,800-square-foot portfolio is spread over the San Fernando Valley, including three properties in Agoura Hills \u2014 one of which was home to the Los Angeles Rams for years before the team\u2019s billionaire owner Stan Kroenke moved headquarters as part of a $10 billion development plan at Warner Center \u2014 and one in Calabasas and another in Woodland Hills.\nThe five offices were valued at $101.6 million at underwriting in September 2019, a few months before the pandemic was declared and remote work took over. In July, the portfolio was appraised at $48.85 million. Occupancy was 71 percent and properties were not making enough money to pay off debt, running a debt service coverage ratio ranging downward to 0.59.\nThis isn\u2019t the first bad bet Kravetz has made. Realty Bancorp Equities\ndefaulted\non more than $100 million in loans tied to an office complex in Santa Monica; the company later sold the property at a price that didn\u2019t cover its debt.\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported on Kravetz\u2019s delinquency on the five-building portfolio, after his debt landed in\nspecial servicing\n, and a multimillion dollar\nhaircut\nto the portfolio before the matter headed to court.\nStay tuned for more.\nKravetz could not be reached for comment.\nLeaning tower of Pasadena\nSouthern California\u2019s landscape of office distress goes beyond one valley: A nine-story property called the Pasadena Office Tower in the heart of the San Gabriel Valley faces\nforeclosure\nafter its owners defaulted on $40 million debt.\n\nThe default notice and foreclosure threat came after the owners, entities connected to Albert Taban and Michael Pashaie, managing partners at Jade Enterprises and Golden West Properties, saw the property\u2019s\nvalue\ncut by more than half as tenants cleared out.\nNow the 142,000-square-foot office, which is 69 percent occupied, is only worth $23 million.\nThat value is on paper, though, and we\u2019ll have to see if the current trend of deep discounts on office properties eats up that slim margin, too.\nSchool daze on multifamily\nSpeaking of vacancies, Azusa Pacific University\nsold\nan uninhabited apartment complex to Legacy Partners for $91.8 million.\nThe university received tax exempt financing for the property that would become student housing \u2014 but occupancy lagged in the post-pandemic era on college campuses, leading to the sale.\nHudson Pacific cuts, adds to board\nHudson Pacific Properties announced\nmore changes\nto its board of directors. Mark D. Linehan left the publicly traded real estate investment trust after 14 years and was replaced by T. Ritson Ferguson.\nIn a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the company said Linehan stepped down \u201cdue to his desire to devote more of his time to other professional commitments,\u201d and that he \u201cexpressed no disagreement with the company.\u201d\nFerguson was the chief executive of CBRE Global Investors and now an investment committee member.\nFerguson\u2019s cash compensation, per the Hudson Pacific\u2019s non-employee director compensation program, amounts to $40,000 for an annual retainer and $12,500 for being a member of the audit committee. He could elect to receive vested shares of the company\u2019s common stock instead of that cash \u2014 but he is already set to earn an annual award of restricted stock units valued at $90,000.\n",

        "content": "Homegrown\nAnthropic\nis looking to ramp up its arms race against OpenAI \u2014 not just for the best artificial intelligence technology, but for the most office space in San Francisco.\nThe Dario Amodei-led firm, hot off a $13 billion Series F round, just added a 100,000-square- feet lease across several floors at the Foundry Square III building in downtown to its footprint in the city.\nThe new digs are across the street from Anthropic\u2019s current headquarters at Foundry Square IV, where it subleases more than 230,000 square feet from Slack. That deal marked one of the largest local transactions in years, though it clearly trails the AI frontrunner in the physical space race. OpenAI has\nleased buildings\nspanning nearly 1 million square feet for its headquarters operations in Mission Bay.\nAnthropic\u2019s growth pattern on office space resembles OpenAI, which subleased nearly half a million square feet of offices at 1455 and 1515 Third Street in Mission Bay from Uber in October 2023. The following September, the Sam Altman-led firm grabbed an additional 315,000 square feet next door at 550 Terry A. Francois Boulevard.\nWhen OpenAI celebrated its grand opening of its Mission Bay headquarters in March, executives pledged to double its current San Francisco-based workforce of 2,000 employees.\nThe influx of AI workers to San Francisco and the Bay Area is expected to bring in more than 50,000 employees in the sector over the next five years, according to experts at CBRE. That\u2019s projected to\nslash the city\u2019s office vacancy rate\nin half as tenants in the red-hot sector more than quadruple the amount of office space used by AI firms from 5 million square feet to more than 20 million. Currently, the city faces a 34.6 percent office vacancy rate \u2014 reflecting a so-far slow recovery from a peak of 36.9 percent in the third quarter of last year.\nA new report from VTS indicates a change of pace, though, with demand more than doubling in the past year. AI companies are expected to accelerate the trend in the coming months. As of last month, there\u2019s been a 107 percent increase in office demand year-over-year in San Francisco. That\u2019s up more than 350 percent since ChatGPT was first released to the public in late 2022,\naccording\nto the San Francisco Business Times.\nEx-Apple chief takes a bite out of Belvedere\nJony Ive\nis adding to his Bay Area real estate collection.\nThe Apple design chief-turned-AI entrepreneur dropped $73 million on four houses in Belvedere. Three of the properties in the bayside Marin County enclave are next to each other at the end of Golden Gate Avenue, while the fourth is nearby on Beach Road. The largest of the homes, boasting five bedrooms, 11 bathrooms and four fireplaces, sold for $43.5 million.\nIve\u2019s purchases come after the Io Products founder spent tens of millions of dollars on nearly a block of property in San Francisco\u2019s Jackson Square neighborhood. The AI device pioneer also owns a mansion in San Francisco\u2019s Pacific Heights.\nHistoric buildings headed for reimagination\n\nMayor Daniel Lurie is going back to the future to address San Francisco\u2019s housing crunch.\nLurie\u2019s PermitSF zoning push now includes vacant historic buildings that he sees as ripe for conversion, covering everything from old churches to museum space to hotels.\nThe mayor\nintroduced legislation\nthat would enable entities such \u00a0nonprofits, retailers, movie theaters and nightlife operators to set up shop in one of the city\u2019s approximately 300 historic buildings without having to endure lengthy approval processes. It\u2019s part of Lurie\u2019s endeavor to spur redevelopment of private\u00a0 spaces by cutting red tape and unshackling businesses from what some see as outdated zoning rules.\nLurie\u2019s proposed law seeks to reform current preservation standards that present hurdles to potential tenants by preventing certain alterations or making them prohibitively expensive.\n\u201cAdding greater flexibility for these special buildings will ensure they won\u2019t fall into disrepair due to disinvestment,\u201d the Mayor\u2019s Office\nsaid\nof the proposal.\nParking-to-housing advances in one Bay Area city\nOut of a handful of Bay Area municipalities that have floated building housing on parking lots, Menlo Park has beat out Palo Alto and Los Altos with an actual plan.\nThe Peninsula city is\nseeking proposals\nfrom developers for multifamily housing combined with public parking and possibly retail or commercial components. Officials hope to turn three city-owned parking lots on Oak Grove Avenue between University Drive and El Camino Real into affordable housing properties.\nAlliant Communities, MidPen Housing, Presidio Bay Ventures and a joint venture between Related Companies and Alta Housing have already each been approved to submit one proposal. Interested developers must submit development proposals that would help the city create at least 345 residential units for low-income and extremely-low-income households.\nLocal business owners aren\u2019t too hot on the idea, though. The Save Downtown Menlo group has been\nopposed to the idea\n, criticizing the apparent rush to meet the city\u2019s housing goals with a quick fix in one spot.\nDevelopers have until Dec. 15\nto submit proposals to the city.\n",

Between June 25 and July 11, right after Cuomo\u2019s loss to Mamdani, Adams raised more than $480,000 from real estate, making him the clear industry frontrunner. But after current and former members of his administration were indicted in August \u200b\u200bon charges related to speeding up construction approvals and steering contracts to certain developers, the fundraising slowed down significantly.\nBetween July 12 and August 18, Adams brought in a little more $60,500 from real estate donors. That was slightly above the $53,700 Cuomo brought in during that period.\n\nAdams\u2019 campaign sued the board last month to try and force the release of $4.7 million in public matching funds.\nThe question remains whether Adams\u2019 dropping out will be a boost to Cuomo\u2019s campaign. A recent Suffolk University poll found Mamdani in the lead with 45 percent of the vote, followed by Cuomo at 25 percent and then Adams and Sliwa trailed behind at 7 percent and 11 percent, respectively.\nIn the video posted today, Adams continued to tout his leadership when it came to housing. \u201cWe built more housing in one term than any administration before us and removed barriers to build even more,\u201d he said.\n",

(The other was\n942 North Alpine Drive\n, which went for $51.8 million in the same month.) You can see the top 10 by clicking\nhere\n.\nThe price paid by Stancheck Capital LLC for the two-story estate at 1028 Ridgedale Drive was a reduction from its original 2023\nask of $85 million\n.\nPacker, a billionaire and the former chair of entertainment company Crown Resorts, bought the 12-bedroom, 18-bathroom mansion for\nover $60 million\nin July 2018.\n\nA white mansion with a black front door and black shutters, the home was built on 1.2 acres in 1930. The home spans 24,325 square feet of living space across a number of structures. Amenities include gym, office, pool house and guest quarters, theater with bar, game room, wine cellar and cigar room.\nKurt Rappaport of Westside Estate Agency and Drew Fenton of Carolwood Estates represented Packer in the deal. Rappaport also represented the buyer.\nJennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck rented the home and Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman lived there for nearly two decades before selling it to developers Stuart and Stephanie Liner\nin 2015\nfor $26.6 million, according to records. The Liners then extensively renovated the estate.\nThe sale comes on the heels of Packer\u2019s\n$110 million\npurchase of \u201cLe Belvedere\u201d at 630 Nimes Road in Bel-Air in March. The estate underwent extensive construction over the past five and a half years to basically rebuild the home from the ground up. Packer told an Australian media outlet,\nnews.com.au\n, in March that he intended to move into the 10-bed, 15-bath home mid-year.\nPacker was the largest shareholder in Crown Resorts, a casino operator, before U.S. private equity giant Blackstone bought it in February 2022 for $6.4 billion. He is the son of late billionaire Kerry Packer, an Australian media tycoon.\n",

        "content": "New York City\u2019s new development market is facing a reckoning in 2026.\nIt\u2019s not that demand has ground to a halt. A number of new buildings launched in the last year have sold quickly and with few discounts.\nBut the new buildings for buyers to tour in the back half of the year have all but disappeared in the proverbial fog of high financing costs and scarce assemblage opportunities, a trend that will only continue into next year, according to data shared from new development teams and analysts in the city.\nIn the second quarter of this year, the 3,600 unsold units in Manhattan marked a 10-year low, according to data from Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, and that number will only shrink heading into next year.\nThis year, only five more buildings are projected to deliver 245 units in Manhattan, according to data from Brown Harris Stevens Development Marketing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s surprising to me that it\u2019s taken so long for so many people to actually catch on, because this has been in the making for quite some time,\u201d said Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group president Kelly Mack.\nCaught between cycles\n\u201cIn terms of actual inventory delivery to the market, you\u2019re seeing a lull,\u201d said Reuveni Development Marketing\u2019s Daniel Pupke. \u201cWe\u2019re in between two eras of cycles.\u201d\nThe first was the\npost-pandemic boom\nthat brought one of the best markets the city had seen in years. Buyers rushed into available buildings, while developers scooped up parcels with cheap financing.\n\u201cPeople bought and mobilized very quickly,\u201d Pupke said, pointing out that many of those projects had seen success since coming to market in the last 18 months.\nTake Avdoo\u2019s 105-unit Boerum Hill project, Bergen. The firm\nacquired the site for $44 million\nat the end of 2021, and six months later had filed permits for the condo project. The project launched sales in the spring of last year and has been one of the best-selling condos in the city, with over 70 of its units sold.\nBut when interest rates\nrose heading into 2023\n, the first step of the development cycle was \u201cessentially on pause unless you had a contract and financing,\u201d Pupke said.\n\u201cThe biggest factor in why we have less new projects today on the market is available equity,\u201d said BHSDM managing director Robin Schneiderman. \u201cThat, to me, is what sort of drives the market overall.\u201d\nThe equity dry spell went hand-in-hand with an increase in land prices, making ground-up developments more difficult to pencil, and the 2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act that made it more difficult to convert rental buildings to condominiums.\nFrom the midpoint of 2025 to the end of year, only 1,450 units are expected to be delivered to the market on a yearly basis, a 29 percent decrease from historic average, and new development sales outpaced launches by 60 percent this year, according to Mack.\nBright spots\nAmid the downturn, the Upper East Side stands out. The neighborhood is expected to bring more units to the market through the end of 2026 than has historically been the case.\nThe largest launch there will be Related Companies\u2019 144-unit rental-to-condo conversion, The Strathmore, at 400 East 84th Street, which Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group will be selling.\n\nThe project, which will have some units offered at under $1,800 per square foot, is also filling a gap in what Mack referred to as entry-level inventory.\n\u201cWith new projects harder and more expensive to build and finance, most new projects are coming in at higher price points than we\u2019ve historically seen,\u201d she said, making the under $1,800 per square foot offerings \u201cincreasingly rare.\u201d The average annual delivery of units in that price range will fall by over 60 percent through the end of 2026, according to data from Corcoran Sunshine.\nAcross the park, the Upper West Side is bereft of development opportunities, on track to exhaust its new development inventory as soon as 2027, according to Mack, with only 30 units expected to be released in the neighborhood through the end of 2026.\nThe only other development over 100 units with a planned sales launch this year is Rotem Rosen\u2019s Billionaire\u2019s Row development at 126 East 57th Street, the Malabar Residences. The project, which is being sold by Douglas Elliman Development Marketing, recently lost its sales director when\nNoble Black departed for Corcoran last week\n.\n\u201cThere\u2019s some very high price profile, sort of exciting new developments are going to enter the market, but they\u2019re going to be in the luxury category and the super luxury category,\u201d Mack said.\nOne noteworthy market entrant will be the Brodsky Organization and Sorgente Group\u2019s 38-unit conversion project at the Flatiron Building, where some onlookers have said prices could reach as high\nas $6,000 per square foot\n.\nGrid Group\u2019s boutique 22-unit Chelsea project will also launch sales this year, offering 16 parking spaces.\nThe two developments fit the mold of what\u2019s coming to the market downtown, where buyer demand remains relentless: boutique, private and expensive. Projects like 140 Jane Street and The Katharine, which quickly sold seven of its 8 units after launching sales this spring, have laid out a playbook for developers that can find assemblages below 34th Street.\nLarger projects expected to come to market next year include Elad Group\u2019s condo conversion at 419 Park Avenue South and Continuum Company\u2019s 137-unit development at 26 East 35th Street, according to data shared by Corcoran Sunshine.\nBrooklyn is facing many of the same issues, albeit at a smaller scale. The nearly 1,000 units in the pipeline for next year are well above the yearly historical average of 535, according to data from BHSDM, but the average condo size is just 17 units, as many of the borough\u2019s projects center on brownstone conversions or smaller ground up developments.\nSales are expected to launch in the first quarter of next year at Charney Companies 182-unit project at 95 Rockwell Place in Fort Greene, according to a spokesperson for the project. Urban Development Partners will also be launching sales at a 71-unit project at 285 Schermerhorn Street this year in Downtown Brooklyn.\nLooking ahead\nThe good news for developers is that any project coming online in the next several years will face limited competition.\n\u201cI think that if you today presented a B+ or better site with views, you could be extremely successful if you deliver in three to five years,\u201d Pupke said.\nHe added that the activity around projects have shifted and developers are buying again.\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t see action following the conversations that were happening,\u201d he said of developers eying opportunities the last few years. \u201cSpeaking to the same groups, you\u2019ll read three months later that the site closed.\u201d\nThe paucity of sales launches also is good news for projects with significant inventory still to move, like One Wall Street or The Greenwich, two condos in the Financial District with hundreds of units still to sell. In the last 12 months, The Greenwich has been the third-fastest selling building in the city, according to Marketproof.\nStill, the volcanic winter of 536 lasted for 18 months, and had ripple effects for years after. Mack similarly doesn\u2019t see a quick fix on the horizon.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take at least five years to turn that picture around,\u201d she said.",

        "content": "Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 announcement Sunday that he will stop running for re-election closes the book on a fruitful and frustrating four years for real estate.\nHis decision, revealed in a video posted on X, might seem like a final gift to the industry, but it figures to only slightly improve Andrew Cuomo\u2019s chances to defeat Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani in the November election.\nAdams was drawing support from only 7 percent or 8 percent of voters in\nrecent polls\n. Even if most of those voters migrate to Cuomo, some will shift to Mamdani or Republican Curtis Sliwa, and some will simply not vote. Some might even vote for Adams, whose name may still appear on the ballot.\nAs a result, Cuomo, who trails Mamdani by 18 to 20 points in the most recent polls, figures to pick up just 3 or 4 points from Adams\u2019 withdrawal.\nThe lost promise of Adams\u2019 mayoralty could haunt the real estate industry for years, especially if Mamdani wins and lives up to his\ncampaign platform of freezing rents\nand\nopposing profit-making by developers\n.\nAdams\u2019 re-election campaign was fatally wounded by his\nSeptember 2023 corruption indictment\nand his\ndalliance with President Donald Trump\nin a successful effort to get the charges dropped.\nBut his popularity had already plummeted, thanks to\nscandals involving his confidantes\n, which\ncontinued even after\nthe Department of Justice abandoned the case against Adams in exchange for his cooperation on immigration enforcement.\nSome of Adams\u2019 accomplishments, however, will benefit the real estate industry for decades to come. No mayor in modern history has done more to increase the potential for more housing in the city.\nAdams\u2019 City of Yes for Housing Opportunity\n, which passed a year ago, will spur the addition of an estimated 82,000 more homes over 15 years. How much credit the mayor deserves for it, however, is a complicated question.\nThe bulk of the work on City of Yes was done by\nhis Department of City Planning and its director Dan Garodnick\n, a former City Council member who touted the reform to New Yorkers and Council members when the mayor was too unpopular and distracted to do either.\nCouncil Speaker Adrienne Adams, although she\nhas clashed repeatedly with the mayor\n, played a crucial role in tweaking City of Yes to ensure at least 26 members would vote for the proposal, which passed 31 to 20. A more popular mayor might have been able to get it through without the concessions that shaved about 27,000 homes off the projected gain.\nBut had the mayor not endorsed the plan and given Garodnick rein to make it happen, it wouldn\u2019t have. City of Yes modernized zoning and other regulations that had long ceased to make sense, if they ever did, yet were kept in place by Mayors Bill de Blasio, Mike Bloomberg, Rudy Giuliani and Ed Koch, all of whom considered themselves reformers.\nThe changes allowed for a little more housing in every neighborhood. One key reform was\neliminating parking requirements\nfor new developments in much of the city; the original proposal would have done so citywide.\nAdams got off to a slow start on rezoning neighborhoods for more housing, but his\nunderstaffed planning department got the ball rolling\nin his third year. By the time he leaves office, Adams will have presided over\nupzonings of Midtown South\n,\nLong Island City\n, Jamaica, the former Flushing Airport,\nAtlantic Avenue\nfrom Prospect Heights to Crown Heights, and\nsections of the Bronx\nwhere four Metro-North stations are planned.\nThe mayor also did more than his predecessors in pushing for city office buildings to be\nconverted into housing\n, although much of that effort came late in his tenure, leaving delivery of those promises to his successor.\nThe Adams administration lobbied Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state legislature for a change that housing advocates have\nsought for years\n: an increase in the city\u2019s maximum floor-area ratio, which had been stuck at 12 for ages. With a\npush\nfrom the governor, the state\nfinally did so\nin the spring of 2024, allowing for a\nmore robust\nMidtown South rezoning, with FAR being raised to 15 on some blocks and 18 on others.\n\nAs a result, the rezoning could yield 10,000 new homes.\nUnder Adams, the New York City Housing Authority has accelerated the de Blasio administration\u2019s\nPACT program\n, which enlists private real estate firms to renovate and manage NYCHA campuses. The program, conceived by former HUD secretary Shaun Donovan in 2011, has made improvements to public housing that long seemed impossible.\nAs part of that effort, NYCHA is moving ahead with the Related Companies on a\ndemolish-and-rebuild\nproject for the Fulton Houses, despite opposition from some Chelsea residents that had caused the de Blasio administration to back off.\nThe Rent Guidelines Board, which over time came to be controlled by Adams appointees, abandoned the rent freezes of the de Blasio years and passed increases for rent-stabilized properties that at least\napproached the rate of inflation\n.\nLandlords appreciated Adams\u2019 refusal to make them scapegoats for the city\u2019s high housing costs, and his repeated explanations that rent has to keep pace with expenses.\nOn the other hand, Adams made little effort to advocate in Albany for rent-stabilized buildings, which have lost billions of dollars in value since the state\u2019s rent law reform of 2019.\nIn recent months, Adams has been promoting himself as the most pro-housing mayor ever, based on changes championed by his administration. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build more housing in one term than [in] the 12 years under Bloomberg [and] the eight years under de Blasio combined,\u201d he said.\nThat\nwasn\u2019t accurate\n. What he meant was his rezonings and the City of Yes created the potential for 130,000 new homes, more than his two predecessors\u2019 rezonings did. The actual creation of those homes, if they happen, will be after Adams leaves office, either at year\u2019s end or sooner if he resigns to accept a new job.\nBut mayors do not, for the most part, create much housing. Their responsibility is to create the conditions that allow the private sector to build. On that standard, Adams can stake a claim as the most pro-housing mayor, even if fair comparisons are impossible because the city\u2019s challenges and circumstances change dramatically from one mayor to the next.\nKoch\u2019s great accomplishment was restoring New Yorkers\u2019 optimism about the city, and reclaiming thousands of buildings abandoned during the city\u2019s years of crisis. Giuliani presided over an unprecedented decline in crime, which raised real estate values more than any housing policy could.\nBloomberg\u2019s 12 years \u2014 despite starting with a recession and being interrupted by the Great Financial Crisis \u2014 were marked by record job increases, which rewarded landlords with higher rents than had ever been imagined. And de Blasio\u2019s policies embraced market-rate development as necessary to alleviate the housing crisis, although he rarely acknowledged that, lest he be cast as catering to real estate.\nAdams was more vocal about housing than any of them. He often derided the persistent not-in-my-back-yard opposition to housing from local communities and their representatives, and never sought to score political points by demonizing the real estate industry.\nBut in the end, that promise was cut short by his own mistakes and misdeeds. While he did bring in respected deputy mayors, including Maria Torres-Springer, who was in charge of housing, Adams also hired cronies from his time in the NYPD, Brooklyn Borough Hall and the state Senate, and let them engage in all kinds of self-dealing.\nThey seemed to take their cue from the mayor himself, judging from the 57-page indictment released by federal prosecutors, which showed Adams approving straw-donor deals and quid pro quo exchanges for first-class travel to Turkey. Adams denied everything, but New Yorkers didn\u2019t believe him, and he never recovered.\nThe upshot was a mayoralty that began with great optimism for real estate interest, then fell apart in a cloud of scandal, but ultimately did a lot of good things for the industry and for New Yorkers who need housing.\nMost of that housing will be realized in the years to come, although given the way his mayoralty ended, it is unclear if Adams will be remembered for it.\n",

        "content": "After years of plunging prices and a flight to the outskirts, Chicago\u2019s downtown condo market may be poised for a revival.\nThe downtown condo market has languished over the last few years. Luxury penthouse owners have\nslashed prices by millions to find buyers\n, and many condos have traded for far less than what they sold for years ago, with some even dropping to\nvalues from the 1990s or earlier\n.\nThe slump in sales has been brought on by a\ncombination of factors\n: Work-from-home norms during the pandemic meant wealthy city workers could move out to the suburbs or North Side neighborhoods, where demand has skyrocketed. Concerns about crime downtown kept out-of-town buyers out of the market, and Chicago was seen as less desirable in general.\nBut brokers who work in the downtown luxury condo market say buyers are showing more interest in downtown condos and the sector may be on the way to a recovery.\n\u201cI feel like the market\u2019s pretty much since the pandemic hit its rock bottom,\u201d said Rafael Murillo, a broker with Compass who sells luxury condos downtown. \u201cAnd each year you\u2019re seeing little improvements.\u201d\nAs other markets continue to climb, buyers are taking the opportunity to get downtown at a discount, Chezi Rafaeli, a Coldwell Banker broker who specializes in Chicago luxury condos, said.\n\u201cA lot of people are trying to secure properties, especially downtown, where the market is really interesting,\u201d Rafaeli said. \u201cPricing is really attractive to a lot of buyers.\u201d\nWhen Rafaeli spoke with\nThe Real Deal\non Sept. 25, he said he had 17 showings that day, where he would usually have fewer than 10 showings a day in the past. A lot of the activity he\u2019s seeing is in the $500,000 to $3 million price range, he said.\nBuyers are starting to see downtown Chicago as a desirable place to live as safety concerns are starting to ease and people find value in the perks of living downtown, brokers said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a nice little resurgence in how people are feeling about Chicago,\u201d said Carrie McCormick, an @properties agent who works in the luxury market. \u201cWe are a world-class city and I think that there\u2019s a shift in people\u2019s thought process.\u201d\n\nWhile competition is starting to tick up, buyers are still being choosy. They want high-quality units, McCormick said, describing the buyer sentiment as a \u201cflight to quality.\u201d\nInterest is especially high in newer buildings like the St. Regis and One Chicago, as well as newly-converted buildings like the Tribune Tower, brokers said.\nThose buildings aren\u2019t selling for the prices the developers asked for and expected in 2022, though, and many recently sold condos still took price cuts from their initial asking price. Murillo said units will move quickly if they\u2019re priced to reflect the new market realities, but if sellers expect more they\u2019ll have a hard time finding buyers.\nThe St. Regis skyscraper, at 363 East Wacker Drive, has been the site of some high-dollar deals this year, showing signs of improvement from a financial struggle for its developers since new ownership took over the property\u2019s unsold units. The 79th-floor penthouse sold for\n$7.5 million in August\n, likely the second-most expensive sale this year at the building based on property records.\nThe unit was part of a bulk investment in unsold condos in the building made in 2024 by an offshoot of Grupo Denim, a Mexican clothing company. At least five condos from that bulk purchase have sold for more than $5 million this year, based on property records. An 82nd-floor penthouse that was listed on the residence\u2019s website in May at $10.5 million is no longer listed for sale, but, so far, there has been no sale of that condo documented in Cook County property records.\nWhile the recovery may not have amplified yet, brokers said they think downtown condo prices are going to start trending upward in the next year. Inventory surplus that has long plagued the sector is easing as buyers are snatching up what\u2019s available and create more competition for desirable properties.\nThe median days on the market for downtown condos has fallen every month this year, according to year-over-year Redfin data.\n\u201cWhen someone\u2019s looking for a high-end property, we just don\u2019t have that many here on the market,\u201d McCormick said. \u201cSo once one does come on and there\u2019s a buying opportunity, people are just taking advantage of it.\u201d\nAside from a few new buildings like One Chicago and the St. Regis, there aren\u2019t many new high-end condos coming online in the near future, Rafaeli said. As availability in those buildings dries up, he said he expects prices to trend upward for lower priced luxury condos, especially if mortgage rates continue to come down.\n\u201cAnything that is in the luxury sector, which typically runs between $500 to $750 a square foot, we will see prices rising,\u201d Rafaeli said. \u201cBecause we don\u2019t have any new inventory coming on the market.\u201d",

The firm bought the building for\n$226 million, or $500 per square foot\nin 2016. It was delivered in 2008.\nJLL\u2019s Mike McDonald and Jonathan Napper represented the seller. The buyer wasn\u2019t identified.\n\nThe property is anchored by Texas Capital Bank, which occupies 44 percent of the property. The bank has 15 more years on its lease. CoStar reported the building was 82.7 percent occupied in May. The property is adjacent to Klyde Warren Park. It has two restaurants, STK Steakhouse and Miriam Cocina Latina, as well as a gym.\nIn Dallas-Fort Worth, \u201cflight-to-quality\u201d usually means ditching downtown for Uptown. The neighborhood is also a favorite among the companies building who\u2019ve made the Big D a financial hub. \u201c\nY\u2019all Street\n\u201d is making a home in Uptown with the development of a $500 million campus for Goldman Sachs by Hunt Realty and a 30-story tower for Bank of America by KDC and Pacific Elm Properties.\nThe New York Stock Exchange is setting up shop nearby. The Texas branch of the exchange signed a 28,000-square-foot lease at\nHarlan Crow\u2019s Old Parkland\n.\nAs one of the strongest office submarkets, Uptown exemplifies the office market split. It has a vacancy rate of 23.2 percent, versus the overall market rate of 25.2 percent, according to Partners Real Estate.\nUnion Investment also owns Granite Park VII, an office building at 5600 Granite Parkway in Plano.\n",

        "content": "Blackstone and Starwood Capital Group are heading back to Wall Street to refinance a sprawling portfolio of budget hotels.\nThe investment giants\u2019 joint venture, ESH Hospitality, is preparing a $1.94 billion CMBS offering secured by debt on 220 Extended Stay America hotels in 33 states, according to a KBRA loan analysis. The portfolio totals 24,560 keys, representing a large portion of the brand\u2019s U.S. footprint, Bisnow\nreported\n.\nJPMorgan Chase and Citi are expected to originate half the debt; Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and a Deutsche Bank affiliate would split the rest. The notes are likely to close before the end of November, KBRA reported.\nThe securitization is underwritten at a 65.4 percent loan-to-value ratio and an 8.27 percent cap rate. The Class A bonds are rated AAA. The two-year, interest-only loan comes with three one-year extension options and is priced at an estimated 250 basis points above the secured overnight financing rate and an expected 0 percent floor.\nBlackstone and Starwood must also secure an interest rate cap at no higher than 7 percent to guard against further volatility.\n\nHalf the portfolio\u2019s square footage is concentrated in Florida, California, New Jersey, Maryland and Massachusetts. Properties average 25 years in age, featuring room counts ranging from 68 to 161. Occupancy in the trailing 12 months was 77 percent, generating a revenue per available room of $60.13. Performance has seesawed in recent years due to pandemic-related disruptions.\nBlackstone and Starwood acquired Extended Stay America for\nabout $6 billion\nin 2021. The private-equity firms paid $19.50 per share for the hotel operator, following previous investments in the hotel chain by each company.\nThe offering comes as the hospitality market continues its split recovery. Luxury hotels are setting record room rates thanks to high-end leisure demand, but extended stay, midscale and economy operators have been slower to rebound as cost-conscious travelers resist spending.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The buyer partially financed the purchase with a $7.7 million loan from Southstate Bank.\nThe deal breaks down to $245 a square foot.\nAn affiliate of\nDelray Beach\n-based ComRealty, led by CEO Harry Zuker, bought\u00a0 the 7.3-acre retail site for $3.4 million in 2007, records show. Peachtree Plaza was completed in 1986.\nThe shopping center\u2019s tenant roster includes Papa John\u2019s Pizza, Dedicated Senior Medical Centers of Florida and Christopher Too Salon. Peachtree Plaza currently has 11,864 square feet of space for lease, an online listing shows.\n\nWith 13 stores along the East Coast, NetCost Market specializes in food products from Eastern European nations such as Ukraine, Russia, Georgia, Belarus, Slovenia, Moldova and Uzbekistan, published reports state. Last year NetCost Market opened its first store in South Florida: a 27,000-square-foot supermarket at Oakwood Plaza in Hollywood.\nOutdoor shopping centers are still the darlings of South Florida\u2019s retail sector. This month, San Francisco-based Stockbridge Capital Group picked up the retail component of Uptown Boca for\n$118.4 million\n. The 150,591-square-foot shopping center is anchored by a Whole Foods Market, and other tenants include REI, Bonefish Grill, Sephora, Chick-fil-A, and Homesense.\nAlso this month, Palm Beach Gardens-based American Commercial Realty Corporation paid\n$18.3 million\nfor King\u2019s Point Shopping Center and Professional Building in Delray Beach.\nJuly saw a flurry of shopping center deals. In Miami Gardens, Todd Nepola\u2019s Hollywood-based Current Capital Group bought a 166,500-square-foot retail plaza and an adjacent 16,000-square-foot outparcel for\n$33 million\n. The site is 95 percent occupied and is anchored by two big box stores leased to Ross Dress for Less and dd\u2019s Discounts. Other tenants include Family Dollar, Dollar Tree, Wingstop, Davita Medical, Bank of America and Subway.\nIn Miramar, Boston-based Longpoint paid\n$34 million\nfor a 167,840-square-foot retail complex anchored by Presidente Supermarket. And in Delray Beach, New York-based O\u2019Connor Capital Partners dropped\n$28.8 million\nfor a 86,000-square-foot retail complex anchored by Michaels and two outparcels leased to CVS and Starbucks.",

        "content": "With just three months left in his tenure, Mayor Eric Adams is squeezing as much housing as possible into his remaining time.\nA day after\nending his re-election bid\n, the mayor announced he is shifting $1.8 billion from future capital budgets to this fiscal year for affordable housing projects.\nThe official rationale is not to burnish his housing legacy, but to take advantage of a new federal law that makes more projects eligible for low-income housing tax credits.\nPreviously, projects that use LIHTC had to be at least 50 percent funded by them, a threshold many could not reach. This summer, Congress\nreduced the minimum\nto 25 percent. But to take advantage of those credits, affordable housing developers still typically need public money to pencil out.\nThat is where the city\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development and Housing Development Corporation come in. Of the $1.8 billion being advanced from future years, $1.5 billion will go for this purpose.\nThe other $300 million is for the New York City Housing Authority\u2019s\nPACT program\n, which taps private developers to renovate and manage public housing campuses. That program, based on one called Rental Assistance Demonstration, has been accelerated by Adams after promising results during the de Blasio administration.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just talking about solving the city\u2019s housing crisis; we\u2019re putting our money where our mouth is to build more housing more quickly,\u201d Adams said in a statement.\nThe congressional bill did not allocate more federal funding, but it allows the city to use its resources more efficiently.\nFront-loading the $1.8 billion will shrink, for the moment, the future budgets from which it comes, but the city clearly needs as much affordable housing as it can get, as soon as it can get it. The HPD-funded projects are built by for-profit and nonprofit developers, who often form joint ventures for individual developments.\nSuch projects must often wait several years for HPD funding, which is allocated based on project readiness and whether they meet the agency\u2019s policy goals. HPD\u2019s capacity is also an issue, but it added staff this summer to handle more applications.\nTo get a piece of the newly available $1.5 billion, \u201cprojects must have been pretty far along in the process,\u201d a senior housing official told\nThe Real Deal\n. HPD has a robust pipeline of projects, the official added.\n",

The project includes the 44-story, 362-unit Lofty Brickell tower and the 46-story, 422-unit Standard Residences tower. They\u2019ll share a podium.\nA spokesperson declined to identify the senior lender.\nMiami-based Newgard has financed construction of the two-tower project so far with a\n$170 million\nconstruction loan from Miami-based 3650 REIT, a subsidiary of 3650 Capital, which it provided in 2022. Construction of the project is more than halfway through, and the buildings, which share a podium, are expected to be completed in 2027, according to the release.\nThe latest $513 million construction financing is one of the largest loans to close this year in South Florida. Other large construction loans include the\n$600 million financing\nBank OZK and mezzanine lender TZ Capital provided in June to Steve Ross\u2019 Related Ross for the planned South Flagler House condo project in West Palm Beach.\nMiami and West Palm Beach-based Two Roads joined Harvey Hernandez\u2019s Newgard as a\njoint venture partner\non the One Brickell Riverfront project last November. Earlier this year, they\nsigned a contract\nto sell a portion of the development site, where a third tower is planned, to Miami Beach-based Prosper, a development firm led by Jay Roberts, and an undisclosed partner.\n\nMiami-based Arquitectonica is designing One Brickell Riverfront. Lofty will include condos ranging from studios to two-bedroom units, and 40,000 square feet of amenities that will include a marina, pool deck, fitness center, spa, cigar lounge and co-working spaces. Remaining penthouses range in asking price from $2.4 million to $3.5 million. Owners will be able to rent their units out on a short-term basis. Cervera Real Estate is handling sales.\nAvra Estiatorio, a New York City-based Greek restaurant, will open on the ground floor of Lofty, according to the release.\nThe Standard Residences building will also have studios, one- and two-bedroom condos with prices for remaining units starting in the mid-$600,000s. Amenities at the Standard tower will include a club lounge and cafe; co-working spaces; a 10th-floor spa with a Hammam, saunas and cold plunge; a fitness center; bowling alley; a restaurant on the ninth floor and a riverfront restaurant at street level. The developers tapped One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty to handle sales.\nOther major projects under construction in the neighborhood include Related Group and GTIS Partners\u2019 Baccarat Residences, and Mast Capital\u2019s Cipriani Residences. Mast secured a\n$600 million construction loan\nfor the tower last year.\nThe One Brickell Riverfront project isn\u2019t the only Two Roads development to recently secure a large loan. In September, Two Roads nabbed\n$520 million in construction financing\nfor a waterfront luxury hotel and condo tower in downtown Tampa, which includes C-PACE financing.\nThe development firm\u2019s projects in South Florida include the planned Edition Residences in Miami\u2019s Edgewater, which has been on hold for years due to litigation surrounding Two Roads\u2019 buyout of the existing condo building on the waterfront site. This summer, an appeals court again ruled in favor of a group of eight holdout owners who have been fighting the buyout.\n",

        "content": "Aurora is putting the brakes on data center and warehouse developments, at least for now.\nThe city council voted 10-1 last week to approve a temporary moratorium on such projects, intended to buy time to draft stricter development guidelines in the Chicago suburb that is Illinois\u2019 second-largest city, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nThe pause will last 180 days and could be extended a month beyond that. It halts the acceptance or approval of applications for data centers or warehouses, as well as expansions of existing facilities. Exceptions include projects already filed, routine repairs and emergency government facilities. Developers with time-sensitive projects can apply for conditional processing but will need to comply with any future code changes.\nMayor John Laesch stressed that the city isn\u2019t anti\u2013data center but needs guardrails to address community concerns. Residents near CyrusOne\u2019s facility on\nAurora\u2019s East Side\n, at 2905 Diehl Road, have complained of \u201cunlivable\u201d noise from backup generators, while officials also flagged environmental risks tied to water consumption, diesel emissions and greenhouse gases. Laesch said he has fielded calls from labor groups and potential operators, assuring them that the goal is balance, not banishment.\nAurora currently has five\ndata center projects\nseeking approval, Chief Development Services Officer John Curley said. Staff will present an update in 90 days and aim to deliver draft code changes before the six-month window closes.\n\nThe lone \u201cno\u201d vote, Alderman Carl Franco, argued the council lacked information to justify the sweeping pause and warned against discouraging investment. Proponents countered that Aurora\u2019s code lumps data centers in with warehouses, leaving the city without standards to mitigate impacts on surrounding neighborhoods.\nThe moratorium follows months of tension over\nCyrusOne\n\u2019s site, where residents pressed the company and the city for relief from noise pollution. While temporary fixes have helped, residents remain wary of long-term impacts. Environmental advocates, including local Sierra Club chair Mavis Bates, applauded the move, calling it a chance for Aurora to set the bar for \u201csustainable data center hosting.\u201d\nAurora isn\u2019t alone in rethinking its approach.\nMunicipalities\nacross the country are grappling with how to regulate data centers and logistics hubs that promise tax revenue but come with noise, traffic and heavy utility demands.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Moishe Mana loaded more properties into his Wynwood portfolio in Miami with a $25.5 million development site acquisition.\nMana\n, who is arguably the largest landowner in\nWynwood\nand\ndowntown Miami\n, acquired a 0.7-acre assemblage at 2200-2230 Northwest Second Avenue and 224 Northwest 22nd Terrace, the buyer and the seller confirmed to\nThe Real Deal\n. The site is approved for a five-story mixed-use development that could be either offices or residential with ground-floor retail. If Mana were to capitalize on Florida\u2019s Live Local Act, he could potentially develop a 450-foot-tall mixed-use skyscraper with 789 apartments, an offering shows.\nBut he would not build a residential project on the site, Mana told\nTRD\n. \u201cThis is not a site for residential,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see it as a business center, and the properties are generating income. It is very much in line with our other properties in Wynwood.\u201d\nThe assemblage, consisting of two retail buildings and a parking lot, is surrounded by other Mana-owned parcels.\nAri Dispenza with Miami-based Central Commercial Real Estate represented the seller, an affiliate of New York-based\nAbingdon Square Partners\n, led by Benjamin Atkins. Abingdon paid $5.1 million in 2013 for the property, records show. The assemblage was listed last year with an asking price of\n$31 million\n, but Abingdon took it off the market, Atkins told\nTRD\n.\n\n\u201cMoise owns all the properties around this assemblage,\u201d Atkins said. \u201cWhen it got more serious, he and I were able to reach an off-market agreement. He has very exciting plans.\u201d\nIn Wynwood, the height of buildings is capped at five to eight stories, but developers can go as high as 12 stories in some areas of the neighborhood by offering public benefits. The assemblage purchased by Mana is capped at 70 units and five stories, but the developer could win an extra three stories and 55 more units by providing public benefits, last year\u2019s offering states.\nThe memo also noted that a buyer could take advantage of the\nLive Local Act\n, which allows developers to build new mixed-use or residential projects that can be as tall as buildings within one mile. In exchange, developers must set aside at least 40 percent of units for households earning no more than 120 percent of the area median income for at least 30 years.\nAmong the developers planning Live Local Act projects in Wynwood include Brooklyn-based\nLivWrk\n. The firm is seeking city of Miami approval for three 45-story towers with 1,363 apartments, 23,200 square feet of retail and 912 parking spaces on the northwest corner of North Miami Avenue and Northwest 24th Street.\nIn July, Mana landed a\n$150 million\nrefinancing for 56 properties in Wynwood that surround his Mana Wynwood Convention Center at 318 Northwest 23rd Street in Miami. The venue was not part of the refinancing.\nMost of the parcels are along 21st, 22nd and 23rd streets, both east and west of Fifth Avenue, where Mana is planning\nMana Wynwood\n, a 30-acre mixed-use development that was approved in 2016, but that project has not broken ground.",

The\nGensler\n-designed development will cost $150 million to build and will be the first facility solely dedicated to the Sparks.\nSparks players will have access to two WNBA regulation-size courts, modern weight and training rooms, hydrotherapy and spa suites, an outdoor pool, wellness spaces and dedicated nap rooms. When it opens in 2027, the facility will also be home to the Sparks\u2019 business headquarters.\nThe Sparks are the latest professional sports teams to plant a flag in\nEl Segundo\n.

Chargers built The Bolt, a 145,000-square-foot training facility in El Segundo, less than 2 miles from the Sparks\u2019 future home. Prior to the announcement of the Sparks\u2019 move, the team was just one of three WNBA squads without a practice facility either built or in development.\n\nWith the Sparks\u2019 move to El Segundo, the enclave near Los Angeles International Airport will be the only city in the United States to host five professional teams, per CO.\nInglewood, a few miles to the northeast of El Segundo, has similarly seen a sports makeover in recent years.\nStan Kroenke\n\u2019s $5.5 billion SoFi Stadium \u2014 the most expensive in the world \u2014 opened in 2020, while the $2 billion Intuit Dome opened just south of the SoFi site last August.

        "content": "Chicago real estate power players Curt Bailey, Bob Clark and\nMarc Zahr\ncompleted a $58 million real estate trade that could be the start of a consequential chapter for the South Side\u2019s economy.\nThe Zahr-led real estate division of\nBlue Owl Capital\nbought pieces of the South Side\u2019s sprawling former U.S. Steel site for about $29 million and subsequently sold it for about $58 million to\nRelated Midwest\n(led by Bailey) and CRG, the development arm of Clark\u2019s construction conglomerate Clayco, according to public records. Blue Owl appears to have issued a 99-year ground lease to the development firms to constitute the $58 million transaction, with the deal finalized earlier this month, public records show.\nRelated also directly purchased a little more than $3 million worth of land on the site from U.S. Steel, records show. The exact details of the ground lease between Blue Owl and the development team, and how the release of funds for the transaction was structured, is unclear.\nWith control of the real estate, the developers are tasked with building a multi-billion dollar quantum computing and microelectronics facility in coordination with the massive parcel\u2019s ultimate tenants PsiQuantum and the University of Illinois. So far, it\u2019s unclear whether the developers have acquired the entire site, or if the $58 million represents only the initial batch of acreage set for redevelopment.\nLeaders of Related Midwest, CRG and their representatives didn\u2019t immediately return requests for comment.\nThe transaction comes on the heels of Silicon Valley-based PsiQuantum \u2014 which aims to create the world\u2019s first \u201cuseful\u201d quantum computer \u2014 raising $1 billion earlier this month to help launch its plans for facilities in Australia and Chicago. The funding round, led by funds and accounts managed by affiliates of BlackRock, valued PsiQuantum at $7 billion.\n\nPsiQuantum will be the anchor of the Chicago facility, to which it has committed $1 billion. Construction is slated to start this year, and the facility is expected to be operational by 2028.\nAt least 128 acres of the 440-acre former South Works steel site are slated to be transformed, with the first phase of the quantum project set to erect a 458,000-square-foot facility as part of the larger research campus, into which the state is also pouring funds. Federal funding of $140 million from the U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency will also support the establishment of a quantum-testing facility on the campus.\nPrevious redevelopment efforts for the former industrial site have included similarly grand ambitions, with a project in the late 2010s envisioning up to 20,000 homes. But they fizzled out in part due to the fundamental challenges tied to the site\u2019s scale, soil contamination and broader economics.\nRelated Midwest and CRG secured rezoning approvals for the entire 440-acre site late last year. While the so-called Illinois Quantum &amp; Microelectronics Park will take up about a quarter of the area, the developers are allowed to build up to 59.3 million square feet of buildings across the campus, far\nexceeding the combined size\nof other planned downtown megadevelopments such as the new Lincoln Yards plan dubbed Foundry Park, Bronzeville Lakefront and The 78, the latter being another project that Related Midwest is pursuing.\nCheck back for updates on this developing story.\n",

The Downtown Dallas Development Authority and the Downtown Connection Tax Increment Financing District are slated to review the deal this week.\nThe agreement would dedicate future increases in property tax revenue to help fund redevelopment of the 72-story tower and four adjacent blocks. Staff recommended approval, setting the stage for City Council consideration.\nHoque and Ablon, through an entity called\n901 Main PAHG Partners\n, struck a deal last year to buy the 1.9 million-square-foot tower from Chicago-based Metropolis Holdings. The price wasn\u2019t disclosed. The Dallas Central Appraisal District valued the 1.85 million-square-foot tower at $130 million, or $70 per square foot. The purchase was expected to close mid-2025 but is now expected later this year. Metropolis bought the building in 1998 for about $300 million, or $162 per square foot.\nIn 2023 the building also lost its namesake tenant, when\nBank of America\ndownsized to 238,000 square feet in KDC\u2019s in-development Parkside Uptown, leaving a 500,000-square-foot hole.\nAblon and\nHoque\n\u2019s plan envisions a 300-key luxury hotel inside the tower, plus streetscape upgrades designed to turn the fortress-like superblock into a more walkable downtown anchor.\n\nBank of America Plaza, famous for its colorful LED outline, has long been a Dallas icon but hasn\u2019t had major reinvestment in decades. The proposed remodel could reposition the tower and reshape its surrounding blocks, dovetailing broader efforts to bring more residential and pedestrian activity downtown.\nHoque\nhas been at the helm of major public/private redevelopment ventures, including a planned 270-acre mixed-use project in\nUniversity Hills\nin far southeast Dallas that received a subsidy deal from the city, although his firm has missed deadlines in the past.\nSimilar TIF incentives have helped fund office-to-resi conversions and infrastructure upgrades along Main and\nElm streets\n.\nMeanwhile, Fort Worth is weighing its own incentive package. The City Council there will vote Sept. 30 on whether to offer up to $6 million in grants to Alcon Research, the global eye care giant founded in the city, as it considers relocating two European manufacturing lines to North Texas. The move would represent a $186 million investment and 241 new jobs.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Manhattan may soon get what has become an increasingly uncommon sight: a ground-up hotel.\nHarlem-based developer Artifact filed plans for a nine-story, 40-key hotel at 23-27 Allen Street on the edge of Chinatown and the Lower East Side, according to a Department of City Planning application. The project would rise about 120 feet, include ground-floor retail and span nearly 40,000 square feet, according to\nCrain\u2019s\n.\nThe site is home to three low-rise commercial buildings, including a restaurant supply shop, art gallery and produce importer. All would be demolished. Artifact, led by Javier Martinez, bought 25 Allen Street for $5 million in 2022 but hasn\u2019t yet acquired the two neighboring parcels, property records show.\nA representative for the developer declined to comment on the application.\nIf built, the hotel would stand out in multiple ways. New Manhattan hotel developments have slowed to a crawl since the city enacted a 2021 law requiring special permits for ground-up hospitality development, a measure backed by the Hotel Trades Council despite real estate industry warnings that it would choke supply.\n\nWith financing still tight, operators wary of overbuilding in a market still stabilizing from the pandemic and an increasingly burdensome process at hand, filings for hotel projects have been exceedingly rare.\nAs of November, there were only three hotel special permit applications filed in the previous 12 months, according to a Cushman &amp; Wakefield\nreport\n. Those three developments accounted for 656 rooms, according to the Department of City Planning\u2019s data portal.\nThat scarcity makes the scale of Artifact\u2019s proposal notable. Though a small hotel by scale, the project would be among the few entrants in a city that has seen almost\nno fresh hotel inventory permitted\nin recent years.\nArtifact is best known for Harlem residential projects like the Harlem Collective coworking hub and a 421a-backed rental at 2335 12th Avenue.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A purportedly haunted hotel in San Francisco sold at auction just in time for Halloween season.\nThe former Hotel Union Square at 100-120 Powell Street sold its $102 million in debt for about $30 million, the San Francisco Standard\nreported\n. The buyer was Hotel Union Square LLC, an entity linked to commercial real estate investor Mahmood Alam, known for\nhigh-profile gas station projects\nin Mendocino County.\nThe 131-room property opened in 1908 as the Golden West Hotel and is located on a once-thriving stretch of Powell Street now plagued by retail vacancies. It was previously managed by private equity firm\nRockpoint Group and hospitality group Highgate Hotels\nand was converted to temporary residences for the homeless from mid-2020 to late 2021.\nThe hotel never reopened after that. The owners received a flat daily payment from the city as well as a $5.3 million payout for water and smoke damage during that shelter-in-place period. Rockpoint\ndefaulted on its mortgage in 2023\n, and a Swatch store in the building\u2019s ground floor closed this year.\n\nDuring its time as the Golden West Hotel in the Prohibition era, the property had a speakeasy called the Golden Bubble tucked away in its basement. \u201cThe Maltese Falcon\u201d author Dashiell Hammett was among the regulars at the bar; it was at the hotel where he had an affair with playwright Lillian Hellman. Hammett and Hellman frequently stayed in Room 207, and her spirit allegedly still haunts the room, with guests claiming to hear strange sounds, feel drops in temperature, and see a woman pacing in front of them.\nHotels in San Francisco and the Bay Area have been\nnavigating troubled waters\nsince the pandemic, with several properties falling into loan default, foreclosure or closing their doors entirely, as was the case with the Hotel Union Square.\nHotel Union Square was one of many San Francisco hotels that were used as temporary shelter during the pandemic, and just one of two that never reopened afterward. Hotel Whitcomb at 1231 Market Street also never recovered; its owners were paid $89 million for a 33-month contract and subsequently received $32 million for damages and lost revenue.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Self-employed workers weren\u2019t counted.\nThe number of real estate services workers in the region fell 2,900 to 114,500 last month, a 2 percent drop from last year, the analysis found.The lending market lost 2 percent, or 1,900 of its workers, to 83,500 employees.\nThe tumble started a few years ago, when a hot seller\u2019s market and national housing shortage, coupled with monetary policies favoring real estate, brought the industries to an apex.\nReal estate-related industries\nreached a post-Great Recession high of 761,700 local jobs in July 2022, the analysis found.\nSoon after, the market started to shift, with high-interest rates, inflation and the Federal Reserve backing off its pandemic-era easy-money policy and large purchases of mortgage-backed securities.\n\nSince then, jobs are down by 46,800, or 6 percent.\nAt the same time, demand for local real estate and construction-related jobs, which make up about 9 percent of Southern California\u2019s nearly 8 million workers, fell as higher financing costs have become obstacles for construction,\nmortgages\nand the purchase of building materials.\nThe\nconstruction\nsector, at 359,800 workers, lost 16,400 jobs, or 4 percent, compared to last August. The building supplies sector lost 1,100 workers in a year, or a 2 percent drop to 49,600 workers. Building services jobs fell 1,800, or 2 percent, to 107,500 workers.\nLos Angeles County lost 10,100 real estate and construction-related workers over the past year, falling 3 percent to 330,800.

        "content": "Veritas Investments is facing foreclosure on several dozen buildings in San Francisco after a nine-figure loan default.\nThe San Francisco-based real estate giant is in default on $652 million of debt, Mission Local\nreported\n. The company is facing the foreclosure of 66 buildings, referred to in city documents as the \u201cVeritas SF Portfolio.\u201d\nIn total, the 66 buildings house 1,566 residential units, according to Mission Local. The structures range in size from a 116-unit, five-story apartment complex at 57 Taylor Street in the Tenderloin to six-unit buildings in North Beach and Corona Heights. The Tenderloin property was the center of a 2018 lawsuit from tenants over alleged lead contamination. Most of the properties are in the Tenderloin, Civic Center and downtown.\nBecause the loan is secured by the buildings, all 66 could be sold within 90 days to pay off the debt, according to Mission Local.\nFirst American Title Insurance Company sent the notice of default to 66 properties owned by various subsidiaries of Veritas, per Mission Local. It gives Veritas until five days before a sale date to pay off its debt to its lender, Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s real estate investment arm RBC Real Estate Capital Corporation. Veritas reportedly has the option to work out a payment plan or ask for extra time, though if it foregoes either of those options, the lender reserves the right to set a sale date no sooner than 90 days from the Sept. 18 filing date, or Dec. 17.\nThose 66 buildings house 1,566 units, according to a review of records with the San Francisco Office of the Assessor-Recorder. Because Veritas\u2019 loan is secured by the buildings, all 66 could be sold at foreclosure within 90 days to pay off the debt, according to the notice.\n\nThe Veritas loan has an unpaid principal balance of $551 million which first came due last March, per Mission Local. The firm reportedly also didn\u2019t pay $1.1 million in property taxes.\nIt\u2019s not the first time in recent years Veritas has faced financial woes.\nVeritas defaulted on a $450 million debt in late 2022,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously\nreported\n. In late 2023, the real estate firm\ndefaulted on $1 billion in loans\nand ended up selling off large portions of its real estate holdings. In January 2024, it\nsold off 2,150 units\n, or about a third of its housing stock in San Francisco. The following month, it\nsold\nanother 762 rent-controlled units. And this spring, Veritas\noffloaded 1,770 units for $540.5 million\n.\nAfter shaving down its holdings last year, Veritas lost its spot as San Francisco\u2019s largest landlord.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "A lender aims to foreclose on Grant King\u2019s Dream Hollywood hotel.\nA UCC foreclosure auction is scheduled for mid-October, according to a notice reviewed by The Real Deal. The LCP Group is seeking to foreclose on the equity interests in the 178-key hotel, which the lender alleges has over $30 million in unpaid debt.\nThe 10-story hotel at 6417 Selma Avenue is owned by a company connected to the embattled King-helmed Relevant Group. King told TRD that Relevant is working on a loan recapitalization and extension with the lender.\nRelevant raised hundreds of millions for the hotel, as TRD\nreported\nin March 2023, with some coming via the EB-5 program. It received a $33.3 million loan a month later from LCP.\nRelevant lost 6417 Selma Avenue before, but bought it back after King\u2019s personal bankruptcy in 2013. The hotel was completed in 2017.\n\nThe company then developed two other hotels: the 212-key Tommie and 190-key Thompson Hollywood hotels, both in 2021. The two are under different names and brands now, after lenders Machine Investment Group and Tachonic Capital acquired the properties at 6516 West Selma Avenue and 1541 Wilcox Avenue through\nforeclosure\nin 2023. Recent records revealed the lenders acquired the properties through credit bids; the mezzanine lenders provided a $72 million loan for the two hotels.\nIn June, the Los Angeles City Council\nrescinded\nits approval of another hotel proposed by\u00a0 Relevant, this one an eight-story, 114-room hotel at 6221 Selma Avenue in Hollywood, after a court ruled it would adversely impact air quality in the area.\nThe equity interest in the Dream Hollywood hotel will be put for sale along with the Tao Restaurant; they will be offered individually and then as a bulk sale.\nMatthew Mannion of Mannion Auctions is the auctioneer. The lender declined to comment.\n",

The shell space sold for $5.25 million, or $1,009 per square foot, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. A buildout at a \u201clow-ball\u201d estimate of $200 would cost over $1 million.\nJulie Busby of Compass represented the buyers, who she declined to identify. Tim Sheahan and Mark Icuss, the Compass agents who represented all 58 condos in the building, said all units have sold or are under contract. Forty-eight of the units sold for between $2 million and $3.6 million, they said.\nThe latest trade came at a high price point for the\nWest Loop\n. A\npenthouse\non the 15th floor of the tower sold in 2023 for $7 million. In 2022, a penthouse sold for $5.6 million at 900 West Washington Boulevard, and another sold for $5.72 million in 2019 in the same building.\nSulo Development\nstarted construction\non the tower in 2021, and the first condos were delivered in 2023. Pre-sale listings of 36 units started at $2 million, making them the neighborhood\u2019s most-expensive homes.\n\nSulo also built the Hayden, an eight-story, 28-unit condo building at 1109 West Washington Boulevard. Bucking the apartment-building trend in Fulton Market,\nSulo\nalso proposed a three-building, 243-condo project last year at 1325 West Fulton Street.\nSulo acquired that property from Sterling Bay, which had purchased the vacant lot in 2017 with the intention of building offices.\nIt\u2019s been a few years of rough sailing for the luxury condo market in downtown Chicago, and many developers have shifted to\nbuilding apartments\ninstead of for-sale products. However, GD Holdings bought Magellan\u2019s unsold St. Regis condos at 363 East Wacker Drive last year and has been offloading them at a good clip. A 79th-floor unit sold for $7.5 million, or $1,190 per square foot, last month.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Vanbarton Group locked in a large loan from Brookfield to close a Midtown office deal, marking the developer\u2019s latest office-to-residential play.\nBrookfield provided a $300 million loan to finance Vanbarton\u2019s\n$135 million purchase of 6 East 43rd Street\nfrom the Milstein family\u2019s Emigrant Savings Bank. The loan will also be used for Vanbarton\u2019s conversion of the 400,000-square-foot building to 441 rental apartments, including 111 affordable units.\nVanbarton will take advantage of a tax break ushered in by Gov. Kathy Hochul,\nknown as 467m\n. Developers who set aside 25 percent of a conversion\u2019s units as affordable to those making 80 percent of the area median income can nab a\n90 percent off\ncoupon on property taxes under the abatement.\nThe conversion of the 1968 building is possible thanks to last year\u2019s\nCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity\n. Before the City Council approved Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 signature housing policy, buildings constructed after 1961, apart from those in Lower Manhattan, were ineligible for conversion. Now, anything that went up before 1991 is fair game.\n\nSkyline Properties\u2019 Robert Khodadadian, Daniel Shirazi and Daniel Davidov represented Vanbarton in the deal. Eastdil Secured represented the Milstein family.\nVanbarton, led by Gary Tischler and Richard Coles, has been doing conversions for more than two decades, and its appetite shows no signs of slowing. It\u2019s the third office building Vanbarton\u2019s bought in the past year as bargains in the office market and demand for new apartments have led to a boom in conversion opportunities.\nThe developer is paying roughly $100 million to buy the home of the Archdiocese of New York at\n1011 First Avenue\n, which it plans to transform into 420 apartments. And in December, it bought 77 Water Street in the Financial District for\n$95 million\n, which will turn into 600 units.\n",

Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Long Beach, Calif., was once known as \u201cIowa by the sea,\u201d because of the migration of Midwesterners to the seaside city, as part of a broader influx that brought 2 million people to Los Angeles County between 1920 and 1930,\naccording to PBS SoCal\n.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Nearly 50,000 commuters are about to save one minute on their daily subway trips thanks to a planned route switch. Starting Dec. 8, F and M trains will switch East River tunnels between Manhattan and Queens,\nGothamist reports\n. The current setup causes between 15 and 20 percent of all rush-hour trains on the E, M and R routes to be delayed at Queens Plaza station, according to the MTA. \u201cThis will completely isolate local service from express service, so this will be much less prone to delays,\u201d Alan Foster, the MTA\u2019s Director of Rail Network Planning, said.\n\u2014 Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa is facing increasing pressure to drop out of the mayoral race following Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 announcement that he will no longer seek reelection. But Sliwa told reporters on Monday that \u201cthere\u2019s no dropping out,\u201d\naccording to City &amp; State\n. He also wouldn\u2019t acknowledge who he favors between Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo, saying of the choices: \u201cIt\u2019s the double-headed Hydra.\u201d\n\u2014 In case you needed another reason not to swim in the Hudson River: A federal judge recently sided with a company that is challenging the state\u2019s ban on dumping radiological substances. Holtec International wants to discharge 45,000 gallons of radioactive wastewater into the Hudson as part of its efforts to dismantle the defunct Indian Point nuclear facility in Westchester County,\nthe Times Union reports\n. U.S. District Judge Kenneth Karas ruled last week that New York\u2019s ban on such discharges is unconstitutional.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$18 million\nfor a penthouse at 50 Riverside Boulevard. The Upper West Side condominium unit at One Riverside Park is 6,200 square feet and was sold off-market. Its previous sale was in 2016 as a new-construction unit for $19.7 million,\nper property records\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$25 million\nfor 149 Spring Street. The Soho rental building is eight stories and 18,400 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $35 million for 15 East 62nd Street. The Lenox Hill townhouse is 16,200 square feet and listed by\nBrown Harris Stevens\n.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 20,981-square-foot, seven-story, mixed-use building at 563 Brooklyn Avenue.

In total, the borough saw 24 contracts \u2014 15 condos and nine houses \u2014 for an asking volume of $66 million, up from last week\u2019s\n19 contracts for $54 million\n.\nThe priciest contract last week went to a legal two-family townhouse in Fort Greene asking $4.7 million.\nThe 3,280-square-foot home, at 250 Cumberland Street, is currently configured as an upper triplex and a garden-level studio. It last sold in 2013 for almost $1.9 million.\nThe home has a wood-burning fireplace, original wood floors and a renovated kitchen.\nThe building underwent a landmark-approved facade restoration that includes a heated bluestone patio and new portico and stoop. The home also has a landscaped back garden.\nThe second priciest listing went to a unit 6A at 144 Vanderbilt Avenue in Fort Greene.\n\nThe three-bedroom, three-bathroom home spans almost 2,200 square feet and comes with 250 square feet of outdoor space spread between a terrace and a loggia.\nThe primary suite has a walk-in closet, en-suite bath, separate office and private loggia.\nThe condo unit is one of 26 being offered by Brooklyn-based developer Tankhouse at its eight-story development on the corner of Myrtle Avenue and Vanderbilt Avenue. The property has caught attention in the neighborhood with its light pink siding.\nThe building comes with over 11,000 square feet of private amenities, including a secluded garden that holds a studio that can be used for yoga or meditation. It also comes with a double-height coworking lounge, game room, fitness center and a central sunken garden. The sixth floor has another landscaped garden.\nSales launched one year ago and closings began in June. The building is just over half sold.\nHomes going into contract last week had a median asking price of $2.6 million, an average price per square foot of $1,556 and spent an average of 66 days on market.\n",

        "content": "Eight years ago, the city of Albany required that 5 percent of units in projects with 50 or more units be affordable to the working class. The measure was modest enough that it did not appear to slow housing production.\nBut then Albany\u2019s progressive Common Council got greedy. Overriding vetoes by the mayor, in 2023, it upped the requirement to 7 percent to 13 percent, with larger projects requiring a higher share of affordable units, as well as the maximum rents lowered for those units.\nThis made multifamily development in Albany infeasible.\n\u201cSince the Common Council overrode my two vetoes in early 2023, new proposals for market-rate housing have\ndecreased by 71 percent\n,\u201d Mayor Kathy Sheehan said last year in her State of the City address.\nIt\u2019s only gotten worse since. \u201cBefore the change, the city had thousands of market-rate apartments in the pipeline; after, they have almost\nentirely disappeared\n,\u201d Times Union columnist Chris Churchill wrote this month.\nWithout new homes absorbing demand and competing for tenants, Albany landlords will be able to demand higher rents than they otherwise could. Churchill noted that the \u201cdisastrous law\u201d was \u201cdesigned to make Albany more affordable but threatens the opposite.\u201d\nSheehan has continued to urge the council to undo the policy, but her mayoralty will end this year without that happening.\nAlbany Council members have obviously not read the bestseller \u201cAbundance,\u201d which journalists Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson wrote to persuade fellow liberals to let America build the way it once did \u2014 and the way other nations now do.\nKlein and Thompson opined that Donald Trump\u2019s election was aided by progressives\u2019 not providing enough of what Americans need. One key failure was not building enough housing.\n\nLiberals have famously choked production in high-demand cities such as New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco with restrictive zoning, thick bureaucracy and a mind-boggling array of regulations and mandates. (Conservatives have done the same in blue states\u2019 NIMBY suburbs.)\nNew York got 322,000 new homes in the 1950s and\n369,000 in the \u201960s\nbefore a citywide downzoning kicked in. In the next five decades, the average production was 144,000.\nMeager production\nwas understandable when demand to live in the city was weak, but it was incredibly strong in the 2010s and yet only 169,000 units were built.\nProgressive politicians have belatedly begun to realize that more supply is essential to solving the housing crisis. But they still reduce the effectiveness of their own efforts to boost housing production, and sometimes wipe it out completely, as Albany did.\nIn New York City from 2014 to 2021, the de Blasio administration upzoned eight neighborhoods, but capped rents in at least 25 percent of apartments built on any upzoned parcel citywide.\nThis policy, Mandatory Inclusionary Housing, proved feasible in\nstrong markets\nbut\nnot in weak ones\n. It also forced developers to seek higher rents in MIH projects\u2019 market-rate units to subsidize the affordable ones.\nIt takes votes to pass pro-housing measures, and many laws would not have been approved by left-leaning legislatures without the political cover of affordability requirements and other feel-good provisions. But as Klein and Thompson explain in their book, these add-ons went too far.\n\u201cIn California broadly, and San Francisco specifically,\u201d they wrote, \u201cdozens of pro-housing bills have\nnot\nled to the construction of more homes in part because those bills are layered with additional requirements and standards that builders must meet in order to take advantage of the newly streamlined processes.\u201d\nThe authors concluded, \u201cFor developers we spoke with, the added costs of compliance weren\u2019t worth it.\u201d\n",

Irish talk show host\nGraham Norton\nand his husband, filmmaker\nJono McLeod,\nshed a carriage house at\n6 Sniffen Court\nfor $5.3 million. The buyer was\nMaisydogNY LLC.\nThe property dates to 1864 and has two bedrooms, two and a half baths and a roof deck. Norton, who purchased the home in the early 2000s, and McLeod put it on the market in May for just under $5.6 million. Corcoran\u2019s\nChris Kann\nhad the listing.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe top commercial transaction recorded in the city was in Soho, where a multifamily building at\n149 Spring Street\nsold for $25 million. The seller was an affiliate of developer\nEMP Capital Group\n, which purchased the 18,000-square-foot, eight-story property in 2022 for $17 million. The buyer in the latest deal was a company tied to\nCyrus Hakakian.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nBritish talk show host\nRicky Gervais\nand his girlfriend\nJane Fallon\nparted with a condo at\n140 East 63rd Street\nin Lenox Hill for $1.4 million, sold to an LLC. The couple had purchased the unit in 2008 for $1.7 million. The 800-square-foot apartment has one bedroom and one and a half baths. It went on the market in May for $1.5 million. Compass\u2019\nKatherine Camp\nand\nEric Schwarzkopf\nrepresented Gervais and Fallon, who still own a larger unit in the building.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nTolib Mansurov\n, a Brooklyn developer accused of arranging straw donations to Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 2021 mayoral campaign, sold a Park Slope development site for $24 million. Mansurov, who hasn\u2019t faced charges and denied the allegations, according to The City, filed plans in July to construct a 14-story, 99-unit mixed-use development at the site, which includes:\n67, 69, 71, 73, 75, and 77 Fourth Avenue\nand\n77 Saint Marks Place.\nThe buyer was\nShimon Kleinman\n, according to\nCrain\u2019s\n.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nIn Tribeca, an affiliate of\nOlshan Properties\npaid $13 million for a commercial condo unit at\n93 Hudson Street\n. The seller was an LLC tied to\nAEW Capital Management\nthat had purchased the units a decade ago for $48 million \u2014 73 percent more than the latest transaction. The office property stands 16 stories tall with six units.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nTwo adjacent one-story stores at\n272-06 and 272-08 Union Turnpike\nin New Hyde Park traded for $6.2 million. The seller was\nHillside-Queens Co. LLC\n, which had owned the site for decades. The buyer was\nSAMP 272 LLC.\n\nBy the Numbers:\nA tale of two boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn diverge on affordability\nEverything is relative, and that\u2019s especially true for aspiring homeowners in Manhattan.\nIt may be New York City\u2019s priciest, but Manhattan was the sole borough in the quarter whose home-buying affordability improved over the past year based on median price, according to a TRD Data analysis of third-quarter\nhousing data from Attom\n. It was also the only borough whose affordability was below its historical norm.\nOf course, buyers still needed to earn an annual income north of $360,000 just to afford the typical home on the island; the median household income there is\n$106,000\n. Manhattan buyers also had to drop at least 60 percent of their salaries \u2014 more than twice the recommended amount \u2014 on major home-buying costs.\nCorrection: Friday\u2019s Data Digest incorrectly described developer Yitzchok Schwartz\u2019s plan for a development site at\n960 Franklin Avenue in Crown Heights\n. Schwartz intends to construct a 300-unit condominium project on the property.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "Some of the biggest mansions in and around Los Angeles haven\u2019t been fetching anywhere near their original listing prices, despite former ownership by some big-name celebrities.\nThis month alone, homes once owned by Milwaukee Brewers minority owner Robert Beyer, singer Ricky Martin, and previously married Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck have sold or are asking for well under their listing price, Mansion Global\nreported\n.\nBeyer has been trying to sell his custom-built mansion in Brentwood since September 2023, listing it two years ago for $75 million. It\nsold earlier this month for $44 million\n, marking a 40 percent discount.\nThe Beverly Hills former home of Ricky Martin and Doris Day before him is on the market for just under $50 million, down $25.1 million from\nits August listing price of $75 million\n,\nper\nMansion Global. The 2.4-acre property includes the 9,200-square-foot mansion; Michael Smith, CEO of natural gas exporter Freeport LNG, bought the property from Martin in 2006 for $15 million.\nThe former marital home of Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck in Beverly Hills similarly took a haircut. That property is asking $52 million, or $16 million less than when it\nwent on the market last July for $68 million\n. The megamansion is located in the tony Beverly Crest enclave and spans 38,000 square feet.\nOver the past three years, the only listing over $50 million to sell for close to the asking price was a mansion in Beverly Park formerly owned by Mark Wahlberg. That property sold in June to Paris Hilton for $63.1 million, about $5 million less than the asking price. Wahlberg built the estate in 2014 and asked $87.5 million in April 2022 before finding a buyer for $55 million in February 2023.\n\nMeasure ULA\n, the so-called \u201cmansion tax\u201d that went into effect in April 2023, could be one of the reasons L.A.\u2019s ritziest homes are selling at a discount, Santiago Arana of The Agency told the outlet. Under that law, properties sold over $5 million face a 4 percent tax, and sales of $10 million or more are dealt a 5.5 percent tax.\nThe Los Angeles housing market is still feeling the effects of January\u2019s deadly wildfires. Some homeowners in the area are having a harder time securing property insurance as a result of the blazes. The fires that torched homes across the Pacific Palisades, Malibu and Altadena hastened the comedown from a pandemic-era sales boom.\nDisconnects between buyer and seller expectations, however, are a nationwide problem \u2014 so much so that U.S. home sales have fallen to their lowest levels in decades, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. Those looking for luxury homes, however, might want to pounce on a property before others start to circle.\n\u201cIn the high-end areas, we\u2019re the last ones to go down and the first ones to bounce back,\u201d Arana said. \u201cSo by the time you hear people talking about turning a corner, then it\u2019s too late \u2014 you didn\u2019t buy at the bottom. It\u2019s already the time to buy, and, in my opinion, it\u2019s going to start to slowly climb back.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The asking price breaks down to about $383 per square foot.\nThe four buildings, at 2100-2196 North Elston Avenue comprise 189,000 square feet, and are fully leased to Best Buy, Kohl\u2019s, BMO Bank and Chicago Speech Therapy, with an average of more than five years left on their terms.\nA buyer could assume $58 million in debt on the property, carrying a below-market rate of 3.65 percent. Annual net operating income is pegged at $4.6 million, implying a 7 percent cap rate. Leases stretch into the early 2030s, each with rent bumps and renewal options. Chicago Speech Therapy recently signed a 10-year lease for an 8,500-square-foot space formerly home to Bubbles Academy, filling the last vacancy.\nMarketing materials pitch the complex as a rare triple-net-leased buy on the edge of\nBucktown\nand Lincoln Park, near the Kennedy Expressway and the long-stalled\nLincoln Yards\nsite. Boulder Group broker Jimmy Goodman, who\u2019s handling the listing, called it \u201cgenerational real estate in Chicago.\u201d\n\nThe sale would mark the end of a long hold for Baker, which began assembling 11 acres of industrial and residential parcels along Elston in the early 2000s. The developer, led by CEO Warren Baker, remediated the land, won a zoning change, and built the retail boxes and parking garage. The rezoning was part of an early push to chip away at the riverfront\u2019s industrial corridor designation, a process that later unlocked 760 acres for mixed-use development. That wave has already brought the Triangle Square apartments across the street, and JDL and Kayne Anderson\u2019s proposed\n3,300-unit Foundry Park\njust north at Lincoln Yards.\nBaker is pivoting toward industrial projects in Arizona, where the company has another office. Earlier this year, it sold the\nElevate Lincoln Park\napartments for nearly $114 million to Tishman Speyer, also with an assumable low-interest loan.\nGoodman said the timing could be right for a retail deal of this size.\n\u201cThere are bigger deals transacting and more institutional capital being deployed,\u201d he said.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The venue has already hosted everything from high school graduations to national acts like All Elite Wrestling\u2019s \u201cDynamite\u201d and \u201cRampage,\u201d plus Hot Wheels\u2019 Monster Trucks Live Glow Party.\n\nThe region\u2019s growth trajectory is already evident.\nFort Bend\nis one of the fastest-growing counties in the country, with a booming population and rising demand for venues that can accommodate large-scale events. Local boosters believe the EpiCenter can capture a share of the conferences and entertainment business that typically defaults to Houston. If the hotel and convention piece comes together,\nRosenberg\ncould emerge as a secondary hub in Greater Houston\u2019s event economy.\nBuilding and maintaining public event venues often strains local budgets, however, and competition for concerts and conventions is fierce. Houston\u2019s established convention center and suburban venues like\nSugar Land\u2019s\nSmart Financial Centre dominate the market. But Fort Bend County officials see an opening: a mid-sized, modern facility that can land bookings too big for local gyms but too small for or priced out of downtown Houston.\nIf the packed crowds at wrestling shows and monster truck rallies are any indication, the arena has already proven it can draw.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "For a quarter century, Houston\u2019s wealthiest power players have funneled hundreds of millions into shaping politics in Texas and beyond. Who are they?\nThe top 25 Houston-area donors shelled out roughly $350 million to politicians and committees between 2001 and April 2025, according to an\nanalysis\nof campaign finance data by the Houston Chronicle.\nNo one came close to matching late homebuilder Bob Perry\u2019s giving. A longtime bankroller of conservative causes, Perry poured more than $63 million into campaigns and PACs before his 2013 death \u2014 nearly $30 million more than the next highest donor, John Nau, the former Silver Eagle Distributors CEO.\nBehind them were a mix of familiar names such as billionaire\nTilman Fertitta\nwith $7.9 million in donations. Currently the U.S. Ambassador to Italy, the CEO of Fertitta Entertainment owns the Houston Rockets, Landry\u2019s restaurants and the Golden Nugget Hotel and Casinos.\nOther\nreal estate executives\non the list include Alan Hassenflu of Fidelity Realty Partners and construction magnate Doug Pitcock.\nHassenflu, who is associated with Texans for Lawsuit Reform, donated nearly $5.5 million. Pitcock\u2019s $12.85 million in donations went primarily to state candidates but also Republican PACs.\n\nDick Weekley dropped more than $29 million on various causes. He founded Weekley Homes with his brother David in the 1970s, and donated heavily to causes such as Texans for Lawsuit Reform, the single biggest winner of Houston megadonor largesse.\nThat Houston-founded anti-tort-reform\nadvocacy group\nhas rewritten Texas\u2019 civil justice code and collected more than $37 million from the donor group, nearly 40 percent of all local political giving to state committees.\nGov. Greg Abbott\u2019s campaigns have received $24 million from Houston donors, while federal GOP committees such as American Crossroads and Restore Our Future pulled in $19 million and $13 million, respectively. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick netted about $7 million from the city\u2019s donor class.\nGiving strategies varied. Some, like energy trader John Addison, focused on federal PACs, while others \u2014 including Hassenflu \u2014 zeroed in on\nstate-level committees\n. Fertitta, Pitcock and businessman Stuart Stedman spread their checks across governors\u2019 races. Collectively, Houston-area donors steered $95 million to more than 200 state committees, and $154 million to nearly 500 federal committees.\nThe analysis also highlighted partisan divides. Donors to Democrat\u2019s causes, such as trial lawyers Amber and the late Steve Mostyn, clustered together, while the majority of Houston\u2019s megadonors lined up with\nRepublican\ncommittees. Fertitta and former hedge fund manager John Arnold straddled the two camps, cutting checks to groups backed by both parties.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Afterward, Dixon said he thought the project would be good for the borough, clarifying that his vote did not reflect a change of heart on Ramos\u2019 part.\nMetropolitan Park is up against three other contenders in this final round: MGM Empire City in Yonkers; Queens Aqueduct Casino, operated by Resorts World; and Bally\u2019s in Throggs Neck. The remaining four proposals were eliminated by their respective community advisory committees.\nCohen\u2019s proposal nearly didn\u2019t make it to this key vote. The parking lot next to Citi Field is technically parkland, and the team needed state lawmakers to approve park alienation legislation to move forward. Sen. Ramos refused to introduce such a bill, which could have killed the project if Sen. John Liu, who represents part of the project site, hadn\u2019t ultimately sponsored alienation legislation. The legislature signed off on the bill in May.\n\nThe project would include a Hard Rock hotel and a 5,650-person live music venue, along with bars, restaurants and 25 acres of green space.\nThe project team, which includes Cohen and Hard Rock Entertainment, has indicated that if the state awards Metropolitan Park a license in December, it could begin construction the next month.\nPart of what won over Liu was the team\u2019s commitment to include Flushing Skypark, elevated bike and pedestrian paths that would connect Metropolitan Park, downtown Flushing and other neighborhoods cut off by Flushing Creek, as part of its plan. If Skypark doesn\u2019t get built, Cohen has pledged $100 million for upgrades to Flushing Meadows Corona Park.\nThe team also partnered with Slate Property Group to build 450 units of affordable housing on a parking lot at 54-19 100th Street, a few miles away from the casino project.\nMost expect the state to award MGM and Resorts World two of the three licenses available for downstate casinos, given they both already operate as racinos. That leaves Bally\u2019s and Metropolitan Park proposals competing against each other for the remaining license.\nCohen\u2019s pitch is the larger of the two and is projected to generate $850 million in tax revenue by its third year of operation, compared to $357 million in annual state and local taxes projected for the Bally\u2019s proposal. The state board will evaluate the casino proposals on a number of factors, but will give elements related to economic activity and business development \u2014\u00a0such as tax revenue, total investment and jobs created \u2014\u00a0the most weight.\n",

        "content": "Jim Letchinger is in the driver\u2019s seat for one of Chicago\u2019s most notorious North Side real estate projects.\nThe Chicago-based developer\u2019s firm JDL and its investment partner Kayne Anderson closed Tuesday morning on an $84 million purchase of most of the troubled former Lincoln Yards site from lender\nBank OZK, which took a hefty loss\non debt issued against the property with the deal.\nJDL\u2019s takeover of the project is the latest in a series of positive signs for Chicago megadevelopments targeting sprawling vacant landscapes that have all been caught in limbo for years.\nEarlier this month, publicly traded asset manager\nBlue Owl and developers Related Midwest and CRG closed on a $58 million deal\nto take control of the former U.S. Steel South Works site to start building a multi-billion dollar quantum computing and microelectronics campus for PsiQuantum, advancing a rethink of the South Side property after decades of uncertainty and multiple failed plans.\nFurthermore,\nRelated Midwest\u2019s project The 78\nreceived an infusion of momentum last week when the Chicago City Council approved billionaire Joe Manseuto\u2019s Major League Soccer team Chicago Fire FC to build a $650 million privately financed stadium on the property nestled between the South Loop and Chinatown, providing the megaproject the anchor it has sought for years.\nThe 31-acre northern portion of Lincoln Yards \u2014 which JDL and Kayne\nrenamed Foundry Park\n\u2014 was seized by Bank OZK after its previous owners, Dallas-based Lone Star Funds and Chicago-based Sterling Bay, defaulted on a $126 million loan. Bank OZK wrote the loan value down to $84 million before selling to Letchinger and Kayne, which have redrawn the previous plans for the land, envisioned by Sterling Bay as a $6 billion mixed-use campus, to focus on residential development.\n\nFoundry Park, which sits along the Chicago River between Bucktown and Lincoln Park, will feature far less office use than planned by the previous development team, which planned 14.5 million square feet of buildings. Instead, JDL and Kayne\u2019s $1 billion plans include 3,300 housing units, mostly rentals, with some to be designated for sale in later phases. Their plan also includes up to 350,000 square feet of office space, 435,000 square feet of retail, 250,000 square feet of hospitality and 12 acres of open space, according to city records.\nIt is also likely to scale back the required infrastructure improvements on the site, an aspect that proved to be a difficult hurdle for Sterling Bay, which agreed to front the cost of nearly $500 million in public works construction before starting construction, as part of its redevelopment arrangement with the city.\nLike Sterling Bay, Letchinger at one point also eyed the vacant land on both sides of the Chicago River at the site, but his plan to purchase the southern portion, consisting of 22 acres, from a joint venture of JP Morgan Asset Management and Sterling fizzled out as the bank\u2019s investment arm balked at making a deal earlier this summer. Letchinger has said he would still consider purchasing the southern acreage if it becomes available but is focused on advancing the northern side\u2019s development for now.\nBank OZK didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment on the transaction, and Letchinger confirmed the closing.\nFor Sterling Bay \u2014 which spent hundreds of millions assembling industrial real estate along the river, demolishing structures and remediating the sites to prepare their redevelopment \u2014 the\nLincoln Yards project turned into a financial disaster\n. JP Morgan has also explored exiting its position on the southern side at a loss, as Lone Star did by declining to further support the cost of debt service and refinancing for the northern side.\nNext door to the southern portion, the only property Sterling Bay completed in the area is a vacant life sciences-oriented building that\u2019s for sale and carrying a $64.7 million loan from Bank OZK that matured earlier this month. It\u2019s expected to fetch a value that\u2019s less than the loan balance, according to commercial real estate insiders.",

        "content": "Meyer Chetrit\nhas been indicted on criminal charges in Manhattan.\nThe developer, who is part of Manhattan\nreal estate\u2019s influential Chetrit family\n, has been accused by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg of harassing older, rent-regulated tenants in Chelsea over five years.\nBragg and Jocelyn Strauber, commissioner of the city\u2019s Department of Investigation, said Chetrit \u201cwaged a campaign of harassment\u201d against two septuagenarians, hoping they would move out so the building could be sold.\n\u201cFrom winters without heat and unrepaired roofs causing leaks and ceiling collapses, these New Yorkers were forced to live in uninhabitable conditions,\u201d Bragg said in a statement.\nChetrit, along with West Paramount LLC and The Chetrit Group, has been charged with two counts of harassment of a rent-regulated tenant in the first degree. Those charges are classified as a class E felony and carry a maximum sentence of four years in prison. However, there are many sentencing alternatives for nonviolent offenders with no prior felony convictions.\nA lawyer for Chetrit did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He has pled not guilty, according to court records.\n\nA release from the district attorney\u2019s office refers to an unnamed codefendant who has been indicted but has not yet appeared in court.\nThe tenants lived at 117-119 West 26th Street in Chelsea since the 1980s, according to the release.\nChetrit and the unnamed codefendant purchased the building in 2005 but failed to complete its conversion from commercial lofts to residential housing, according to the release. The apartments are classified as \u201cinterim multiple dwellings,\u201d and overseen by the city\u2019s Loft Board.\nIn addition to extended periods without heat and a ceiling collapse, the building has been without an elevator since September 2023, the DA\u2019s office said. That year, part of the building\u2019s unoccupied commercial section collapsed, prompting a partial vacate order.\nChetrit is facing several civil suits, including\naccusations that he is shielding assets to avoid paying a $132 million judgement\nto a lender. Attorneys for Chetrit in that case \u201cdeny in the strongest terms possible any and all allegations of fraud or wrongdoing,\u201d they said in August.\n",

        "content": "The clock is ticking on the federal flood insurance program, and\nFlorida real estate\ncould take the biggest hit if Congress fails to act.\nThe National Flood Insurance Program, which covers nearly 1.8 million Florida policyholders, is set to expire Sept. 30 unless lawmakers strike a deal to keep the government funded, the Palm Beach Post\nreported\n. If the program lapses, existing claims would still be paid, but no new policies could be written, a major problem for closings in flood-prone areas where mortgage lenders require coverage.\nThat could derail sales across the state\u2019s high-risk coastal zones at the height of hurricane season. Florida has more NFIP policyholders than any other state, thanks to its low elevation and more than 8,400 miles of coastline.\nWhile Congress has let NFIP technically expire 33 times in the past eight years, it has always been renewed. Still, some industry insiders say this round feels different, given rising political dysfunction.\nThe program\u2019s borrowing authority would also be capped at $1 billion during a lapse, raising the risk of delayed claim payments.\nFor Florida homeowners, the private market is hardly a fallback.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a [flood zone rated as high risk], then you have to go to the private market, and it\u2019s going to be much more expensive,\u201d Fort Lauderdale insurance broker Andy Kasten told the Post.\n\nCitizens Property Insurance, the state\u2019s insurer of last resort, has already started requiring all policyholders to carry flood insurance, further ratcheting up costs.\nMortgage pros warn the impact could ripple through housing affordability.\n\u201cJust supply and demand tells me prices will go up,\u201d said Bradley Greenleaf, a Fort Lauderdale loan officer, who noted that many buyers are already struggling. The National Association of Realtors estimates 1,300 home sales nationwide could be disrupted each day if NFIP lapses.\nYet most industry veterans still expect Congress to kick the can, citing flood insurance\u2019s systemic importance.\n\u201cIt will probably still be around forever, because that\u2019s the bank\u2019s protection,\u201d said Arden Insurance\u2019s Robert Norberg.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

However, Chilton didn\u2019t market the interior of the home, assuming the right buyer would want to teardown and rebuild.\n\u201cThe main draw for this property is obviously the land itself,\u201d Chilton said.\nHowever, the buyer is keeping the house, she said.\nAustin is \u201cdefinitely in a buyer\u2019s market,\u201d Chilton said. While the signs are clear now, the city hasn\u2019t rebounded to its pandemic-era growth, Chilton claims.\n\n\u201cThis property would have easily sold for $7 million in 2022 or 2021,\u201d Chilton said.\nThe home listed in August of last year for $6.5 million. The price fell to $6 million in December and to $5 million in May. A 2021 Xcursion pontoon boat was included in the deal.\nThe Austin market is shedding some luxury buyers\n, as people who moved here during the pandemic from places like California are moving back, Chilton said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s affected the market in addition to our pendulum swing downward. The people who came here are now leaving,\u201d Chilton said.\nAustin luxury homes, particularly on Lake Travis\n, have lingered on the market this year.\nLuxury condos\nare also selling more slowly than in recent years. The top sale in Austin last week, a 2023 mansion on 2 acres at 4800 Mondonedo Cove, also had a modest price cut from $6 million when it listed in April to $5.9 million.It\u2019s not the first noteworthy Austin luxury property to welcome teardowns.

        "content": "A battle between two hotel heavyweights is playing out in the heart of Times Square, putting management of a 208-room property at stake, along with the jobs of more than two dozen unionized workers.\nHighgate Hotels\nis suing to block\nOYO Hotels\nfrom terminating its contract to run the OYO Times Square at\n157 West 47th Street\n, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The Manhattan-based operator says OYO blindsided it with an Aug. 1 notice canceling the deal, four years before its scheduled end, citing issues tied to an entirely different property.\nHighgate called the move \u201cbizarre\u201d and warned it would violate state law requiring 90 days\u2019 notice for mass layoffs.\nAt issue is a 10-year management agreement that entitles Highgate to a 3.25 percent cut of the hotel\u2019s gross revenue. OYO, for its part, is supposed to provide working capital to the property, which Highgate describes as \u201cwell-performing.\u201d\nThe operator says the hotel\u2019s unionized staff, employed under a collective bargaining agreement, would be illegally displaced under OYO\u2019s termination order.\n\nHighgate\u2019s lawsuit argues losing the Times Square assignment would cause \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to its reputation and workforce, and that OYO has threatened further legal action if it doesn\u2019t vacate the hotel by Oct. 1.\nAn attorney for Highgate declined to comment to the publication, while OYO did not return requests for comment.\nThe fight pits one of New York\u2019s biggest management companies against one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing hotel owners.\nHighgate controls more than 30 New York hotels\nand 500 globally, while OYO,\nbacked by SoftBank\n, bought Motel 6 from Blackstone last year for $525 million and is reportedly prepping an $800 million initial public offering.\nThis year, Alex Sapir\nreplaced\nHighgate with Crescent Hotel Management to operate the NoMo Soho hotel. Critically, Crescent charged a 1.5 percent management fee in the first year compared to Highgate\u2019s 3 percent.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Major tenants include the law firm Windels Marx Lane &amp; Mittendorf, the New York Road Runners and Calers, as well as Tishman Speyer\u2019s co-working company Studio.\nThe marketing materials show the 31,000-square-foot Studio could be converted into traditional office space or an amenity floor, depending on an investor\u2019s risk appetite.\nTishman Speyer has been more active in the investment sales market lately.\nThe company has sold three office buildings in Beverly Hills over the past year, including a 300,000-square-foot property at 345 North Maple Drive it sold to Kilroy Realty earlier this month for\n$205 million\n.\nIn May, the company made its first New York office acquisition since 2019, paying slightly more than\n$105 million\nto buy the Soho retail and office building at 148 Lafayette Street.\n",

The project could include a hotel, published reports state.\nLast week, the Miami Dade College board of trustees voted to give the land to the state, which set up Tuesday\u2019s vote by DeSantis and the three cabinet members. In 2004, the college paid $25 million for the property, and two previous attempts to develop the site fell through.

Apartments would have ranged from $2,700 one-bedrooms to $4,000 three-bedrooms, with 20 percent set aside for affordable units under the city\u2019s ordinance.\nOpponents said the project didn\u2019t fit the neighborhood\u2019s character and warned it would exacerbate traffic and parking woes. Supporters said the development could bring younger residents, foot traffic and a boost to struggling local businesses.\nIn a newsletter last week, Gardiner said he would not back the zoning change needed to move the project forward.\n\u201cYour feedback made it clear this project is not the right fit for our community,\u201d Gardiner wrote.\nDrexel founder Jeff Weinberg said the firm would not pursue the development.\n\nThe site, near the Edgebrook Metra station and North Branch Trail, houses a Compass Real Estate office, a cigar shop and a hair salon. Compass broker Phil Barone pitched the property to Drexel, whose principals envisioned the building as appealing to local downsizers and remote-working professionals. Drexel had pledged to manage the property itself and to relocate displaced businesses during construction.\nConcerns over height, density and rentals dominated the opposition. Neighbors said five stories would overwhelm the low-rise district and called for condos instead of apartments. Others warned that with just 30 parking spaces, spillover traffic would make streets unsafe. Some critics also blasted renters as transient, while advocates argued the city\u2019s housing crunch makes new supply essential.\nThe difficulty of pushing multifamily projects into Chicago\u2019s bungalow belt, even near transit, is apparent in several recent moves in the outer stretches of the city proper and suburbs as communities try to balance housing needs with\ncommunity standards\n.\nA recent plan to rezone Broadway in\nEdgewater and Uptown\nthat would allow for denser residential projects and more commercial uses had neighborhood groups waging all-out campaigns for and against it.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The exact price Prime paid for the loan wasn\u2019t disclosed, though the seller might have let it go at a discount given that the debt matures next summer and will need to be refinanced or repaid then, a source told the outlet.\nIn buying the debt,\nPrime Finance\npositioned the property to stay in the hands of Reilly, owner of the San Francisco Examiner and a portfolio of mostly historic commercial properties in San Francisco. Reilly, also a political strategist, was adamant about keeping the building in his portfolio.\nHe was caught off guard when American Home, a subsidiary of American International Group, listed the loan for sale in June. He purchased the building in 2018 for $128 million. That comes to $778 per square foot for the $164,500 square foot building.\n\u201cI have no intention of selling this building, or letting anyone else own it,\u201d Reilly\ntold\nthe outlet in June\nwhen the debt went on the market\n. \u201cThe issues around all of these office buildings going back to lenders \u2014 that is not what is happening here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re selling the loan at a discount so they can get out of town.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Reilly aimed to either acquire the debt himself or pay back any third-party buyer trying to take control of the building via foreclosure.\nPrime will likely stay on as lender rather than try to acquire the building outright, sources told the outlet. That will put Prime in a position to foreclose should the need arise. Reilly said he plans to work with Prime to refinance the loan when it matures in June.\nThe slow and steady recovery of San Francisco\u2019s office market has been marked by\nbuildings selling for less\nthan the value of the debt used to acquire them. That losing formula, combined with higher interest rates, has repelled cautious lenders from moving on any loan with a near-term maturity.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "One thing is clear about the battle for leadership of Silver Star Properties: it\u2019s going to take a while.\nThe Houston-based REIT is engaged in a nasty proxy battle with ex-CEO Allen Hartman and once again wants to delay the vote in response to Hartman\u2019s messaging to shareholders. Voting is underway and will wrap up before a shareholder meeting scheduled for Oct. 6.\nSilver Star claims Hartman is lying to shareholders to secure their votes and re-install him as CEO. The lawsuit fact-checks the materials Hartman has been disseminating to shareholders, including claims about executive compensation, the company\u2019s performance and allegations that Silver Star is lying to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\u201cWe have been advised by our proxy solicitor that some shareholders recently changed their votes from Silver Star to Hartman based on his unfounded accusations,\u201d Silver Star Director Jack Tompkins wrote in an affidavit attached to the suit.\nSilver Star asked a Maryland District Court to push the vote until Dec. 31 to provide a \u201ccooling-off period.\u201d The suit was filed in Maryland, because, though it\u2019s headquartered in Houston, it\u2019s a Maryland corporation.\nHartman called the filing part of Silver Star\u2019s \u201congoing effort to illegally reject the Company\u2019s bylaws, which require an annual shareholder meeting.\u201d\n\u201cBy pushing to delay the vote, Silver Star is seeking to extend their control, continue collecting salaries and fees, and further destroy shareholder value for their own benefit at the expense of the Company and its investors,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nSilver Star already delayed the shareholder meeting from August to October, telling shareholders the move was made because Hartman was \u201ccreating chaos\u201d and \u201cso that you have full and accurate information before casting your vote.\u201d\nThe filing is the latest development in the yearslong saga of Hartman\u2019s separation from the company he founded in 2009.\nHartman was ousted by the company\u2019s board in 2023 for accusations of nepotism and mismanagement that allegedly culminated in Silver Star defaulting on a $259 million CMBS loan from Goldman Sachs in October 2023. Silver Star trustees\nsued Hartman for $50 million\nin December 2023, accusing him of fraud and self-dealing. The\nSEC opened an inquiry\ninto the firm in February 2024. The board also claimed that Hartman has been trying to sabotage the company since his ouster.\nHartman has denied the allegations.\nAmid the firm\u2019s financial struggles, Haddock spearheaded an effort to sell off Silver Star\u2019s 35-property portfolio of low-to-mid-tier office properties and pivot to self-storage. It\u2019s not been easy. A Silver Star subsidiary filed for bankruptcy in 2023. Last month, the firm faced foreclosure on a $57.8 million loan from Benefit Street Partners tied to three office properties.\nMeanwhile, the company has been collecting self-storage properties, including a $26.5 million property at 14810 Hagen Ranch Road in Delray Beach, Florida, which it purchased a year ago.\n",

A source familiar with the matter indicated that the surveying work was being done as part of preparations for development of the site.\nRepresentatives for City Hall and the development team did not return requests seeking more information.\nThe project is being funded in part through a workforce housing fund launched by Cirrus, the city and construction pension funds last year. As of July, the fund has raised $300 million.\nCirrus and LCOR are also\npoised\nto take over the remaining sites at the Brooklyn megadevelopment known as Pacific Park. The state still needs to sign off on the joint venture before the development rights are transferred. For the six remaining railyard sites, U.S. Immigration Fund and Fortress Investment Group are expected to remain part of the development joint venture but will not have an active role in managing the development.\nThe developers are also seeking to develop a separate property known as Site 5, home to a former Modell\u2019s and a P.C. Richard &amp; Son near the Barclays Center.\n",

        "content": "CC Homes paid $50 million for a development site in Davie planned for 151 single-family homes.\nCC Homes, led by Armando Codina and Jim Carr, bought the 152-acre vacant property on the northeast corner of I-75 and the Royal Palm Boulevard exit ramp. The seller is KBNP, an affiliate of Aventura-based Turnberry, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. Turnberry, led by Jackie Soffer, will partner on the project.\nDesigned by MSA+, the development will consist of 3,400-square-foot to 5,700-square-foot homes, with some reaching 6,000 square feet with added rooms. The lots will range from 20,000 square feet to 25,000 square feet.\nConstruction and home sales are expected to start this year, with base prices ranging from $1.6 million to $1.8 million, Carr told\nThe Real Deal\nin June.\nThe project, called Estates by Turnberry, marks a redesign of Turnberry\u2019s proposal over a decade ago for 2 million square feet of offices and retail, plus a hotel.\nThe Davie Planning &amp; Zoning Board approved CC Homes\u2019 project on April 8, and the town council preliminarily approved it on May 7. The council\u2019s final vote of\napprova\nl was on May 21.\nThe council also approved a community development district for the project. Developers use CDDs to help pay for infrastructure needed for large projects, including water and sewer connections, roads and sidewalks. Generally,\nCDDs\nissue bonds and then levy assessments on homebuyers to pay back the bonds.\nDavie Mayor Judy Paul said at the May 7 town council meeting that she had cast the only \u2018no\u2019 vote against a previously proposed \u201cmassive shopping center\u201d on the site, likely a reference to Turnberry\u2019s project.\n\nTurnberry\u2019s previously planned development, called Davie Commons, fizzled out after KBNP bought the\n$17.4 million\nmortgage Turnberry had on the land in 2012. The previous lender, KeyBank, had filed a foreclosure on the loan.\nKBNP is tied to Jackie Soffer and reportedly also to New York investors.\nCC Homes\n, based in Coral Gables, was formed at least 15 years ago by Codina and Carr.\nCodina\nis founder of Coral Gables-based Codina Partners, which he leads with his daughter Ana-Marie Codina. Codina Partners is a major South Florida developer, with completed projects including the Downtown Doral mixed-use development in Doral and Beacon Logistics Park in Hialeah.\nCarr\nfounded land development and homebuilding firm Westbrooke Communities in 1976. After selling it to Pacific USA Holdings in 1998, he remained Westbrooke\u2019s president and CEO until 2001. Carr formed multifamily and urban infill development firm Carr Residential I in 2001, according to CC Homes\u2019 website.\nCC Homes recently completed\nPine Rockland Estates\nwith 26 single-family homes at Southwest 72nd Street near Coral Gables. The community is sold out, according to CC Homes\u2019 website.\nAlso in\nDavie\n, Hollywood-based BSD Capital paid\n$16 million\nin July for a 4.8-acre development site at 4491 South State Road 7, with plans for The Core, consisting of a pair of 24-story buildings with 744 apartments, 51,000 square feet of retail and 29,000 square feet of offices.\nCoconut Grove-based 13th Floor Investments and Miami Beach-based JSB Capital Group scored a\n$67.5 million\nconstruction loan in March for a 383-unit apartment complex with some workforce apartments on the northwest corner of Davie Road and Southwest 37th Street in Davie.\n",

        "content": "Longtime North Shore agent Peter Cummins jumped from @properties to Baird &amp; Warner to lead a new team, blasting his old firm\u2019s parent Compass and its push for office exclusives as a major reason for the move.\nHis leap underscores tension between corporate-owned brokerages and local firms as Compass \u2014 @properties\u2019 parent company following its\n$444 million acquisition\nthis year \u2014 seeks to grow its market share and transform the residential real estate industry. Compass announced Sept. 22 it\nplans to acquire Anywhere Real Estate\n, its next-biggest competitor. Anywhere includes brands like Coldwell Banker, Century 21 and Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nCummins joined Baird &amp; Warner about five weeks ago, he said, before Compass announced its plan to acquire Anywhere. But he said his opposition to Compass\u2019 business model was a major factor in his decision to jump to Baird &amp; Warner, a family-owned brokerage. He said he supports a model where listings are shared freely between agents instead of brokerages holding pocket listings marketed only internally.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a part of that,\u201d Cummins said in an interview of Compass\u2019 marketing strategy. \u201cBecause I think it\u2019s contrary to everything I\u2019ve ever learned and been exposed to.\u201d\nCompass has pushed for a three-phase marketing strategy, in which some listings start out as Compass exclusives marketed only to fellow Compass agents. The company has argued the model gives sellers more freedom and privacy and helps them test pricing before their house hits the open market, where statistics such as number of days listed and price cuts are publicly tracked and, according to some, stigmatize certain offerings.\nCummins has more than $500 million in career sales, and said he averaged $20 million to $30 million in annual transaction volume over the last few years. Cummins joined @properties in 2010, and has developed real estate on the North Shore. Before getting into real estate, he worked as assistant city manager in Lake Forest and the village manager of Lake Bluff and Glencoe.\nCummins will lead a new team, Cummins Advisors, at Baird &amp; Warner. He previously did not have a team at @properties. Cummins said he\u2019s planning to bring together three to five agents for his team, including his son, Liam Cummins.\nCummins spoke positively of his experiences at @properties and the company\u2019s co-CEOs, Thad Wong and Mike Golden. But he said he doesn\u2019t support Compass\u2019 business model and wanted to join a brokerage that shared his philosophy of providing a transparent market for agents and consumers.\n\nBaird &amp; Warner has been an advocate of Clear Cooperation, a National Association of Realtors policy requiring agents to enter a listing in the MLS within 24 hours of publicly marketing it. @properties and Compass have\nopposed that policy\n, saying it limits options for agents and sellers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much the future of our industry that I care about,\u201d Cummins said. \u201cAnd I want to be a part of people who share that vision.\u201d\nBaird &amp; Warner president and CEO Steve Baird said in a previous interview with\nThe Real Deal\nthat he views Compass\u2019 consolidation and growing market share as an opportunity to differentiate his brokerage as an independent firm and potentially pick up some agents. Baird &amp; Warner acquired competitor Dream Town Real Estate this year, uniting the city\u2019s two largest\nindependent brokerages\n.\nA spokesperson for @properties declined to comment, and a Compass spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCompass CEO Robert Reffkin said in a call with investors after announcing the merger with Anywhere that the merger will help develop a \u201cunified operating system\u201d for residential real estate using Compass\u2019 vast network of agents. Some brokers, including Cummins, have speculated Compass may move to a model where users need to subscribe to see certain listings that aren\u2019t on the MLS or public listing services.\n\u201cReffkin\u2019s plan is to try to create a Compass profile that works like Amazon,\u201d Cummins said. \u201cAnd if you really want to see these listings before they come out for the world, you better be a part of Compass. And if you\u2019re a consumer, we\u2019re not necessarily going to give away that information for free.\u201d\nThe move also signals Baird &amp; Warner\u2019s expansion in the North Shore amid growing competition for the luxury lakefront market. Baird &amp; Warner has an office in Winnetka, but its presence on the North Shore is not as dominant as Compass and @properties, which hold a large share of the listings there.\nCompass recently sold five offices in the North Shore to\nJanice Corley\u2019s RE/MAX Premier\n, cutting down its brick-and-mortar presence in cities where @properties also has offices. It\u2019s unclear how many of the agents at those offices will move to RE/MAX Premier.\n\u201cThe North Shore in particular is a land of opportunity to do things right,\u201d Cummins said. \u201c And there\u2019s a ton of great agents who, I know, share this philosophy about doing what\u2019s best for the consumer.\u201d",

        "content": "The\nforeclosure auction block across Texas\nis usually crowded with dilapidated Class C apartment complexes, but that\u2019s not the case with this suburban Austin multifamily asset.\nCanada\u2019s largest private landlord is facing foreclosure on Emerson at Buda, built in 2021. The property, at 950 FM 2001, is scheduled to be auctioned after owner Starlight Investments defaulted on a $47.7 million loan from Natixis, according to a foreclosure notice.\nThe auction is scheduled for Oct. 17 at 10:30 a.m.\nThe Toronto-based firm bought the 304-unit property in April 2022. The mortgage works out to $157,000 per unit.\nEmerson at Buda is a garden-style community with a gym, pool, cabanas and co-working spaces. The property is about 16 miles south of downtown Austin in Buda, a fast-growing town of about 15,000 people in the Austin-San Antonio megaregion. Its population has grown more than 8 percent since 2020.\nA historic wave of apartment supply came online in Austin over the last two years, causing rental rates and occupancy levels to plummet.\n\nRents have fallen so much in Austin\nthat the city leads the country in rental affordability, JLL\u2019s Kai Pan said at a recent\nTexas multifamily conference\nhosted by Connect CRE. Decreased rents, paired with high salaries, mean Austin renters, on average, spend 16.8 percent of their income on rent.\nEmerson at Buda\u2019s website archives make it possible to track how the Austin rent rate rollercoaster affected the property.\nThree years ago, one-bedroom apartments at Emerson at Buda started at $1,238 per month. Today, those same units are starting at $1,019, a drop of almost 18 percent. Rates for two-bedroom units have dropped even more. They started at $1,598 three years ago, and are now being offered for $1,278, a reduction of 20 percent.\nEven with the price drops, the property is offering concessions: a $1,000 credit for renters who sign a lease for a one-bedroom apartment and one month free for those who rent a two-bedroom apartment.\nExperts warn Texas multifamily distress is just beginning. In the next five years, $19 billion in CMBS loans tied to Texas multifamily will mature, CWCapital\u2019s James Shevlin said.\n",

The building was left vacant for about three years after Nationwide left the complex and sold it in 2021.\nThe announcement is another blow to downtown San Antonio\u2019s beleaguered office market. For over a year, the city\u2019s office vacancy rate has been stable at about 17 percent according to JLL. The downtown submarket, however, has seen\nvacancy rates as high as 27 percent\n.

The lease ends in 2030, but AT&amp;T is pondering a move to the Dallas suburbs,\nmuch to the dismay of Dallas politicians\nwho say the massive vacancy left by AT&amp;T would be a catastrophic blow to the downtown office market.\nExecutives have been touring sites like the Park at Legacy in Plano, but the firm\u2019s plans remain unclear.\nAT&amp;T already picked up office space in Richardson\nearlier this year, inking a deal to occupy 186,000 square feet at Lakeside Boulevard Tower in Richardson.

Ares\u2019 purchase was also $23 million above the previous sale price six years ago.\nThe seller, an affiliate of Boston-based Cabot Properties, paid $33 million for the 15.9-acre site in 2019, records show. The building was completed in 1995.\n\nAres is among the most active institutional investors for South Florida industrial properties. In May, a trust affiliated with Ares acquired the former Miami Herald headquarters in Doral for\n$25.9 million\n.\nThe seller of that property, Atlanta-based Panattoni Development, had begun demolishing the office building on the 9-acre site, but abandoned plans to redevelop the property into two warehouses spanning 153,653 square feet with 171 parking spaces. Ares paid $4 million less than Panattoni\u2019s purchase price last year.\nIn October, Ares dropped\n$147 million\nfor Midway Miami Park, a warehouse complex in Miami Lakes made up of four warehouses. The transaction was the fourth largest industrial deal in South Florida for 2024.\nAres is also partnering with Miami billionaire Jorge Mas and retired soccer star David Beckham to develop the $1 billion Miami Freedom Park, a massive mixed-use project in Miami, anchored by a new 25,000-seat home for Inter Miami Major League Soccer franchise. In April, the partnership scored a\n$450 million\nconstruction loan for the soccer stadium, which is nearly completed.\nAlso this year, Ares teamed up with Monarch Alternative Capital to provide a\n$413 million\nloan for One Twenty Brickell Residences, a planned two-tower Miami condominium with 803 units to be developed by PMG.",

        "content": "The owner of a trendy hotel-meets-hostel downtown defaulted on its debt to the tune of $71 million and faces foreclosure.\nThe borrower, a company connected to Generator Hostels, failed to make payments to lender Trimont on a loan tied to Freehand Los Angeles Hotel at 416 West 8th Street, according to a notice of default and election to sell recorded this month.\nLondon-based private equity firm Queensgate Investments, which owns Generator,\npurchased\nthe Freehand Hotels brand six years ago for $400 million from Sydell Group, in a deal that included hotels in Miami, Chicago and New York \u2014 about 1,000 keys \u2014 all operated by Generator. Queensgate later refinanced the acquisition for $230 million.\nThe firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe property, on the corner of 8th and Olive Street, has 167 private rooms, 59 shared rooms and a rooftop bar called the Broken Shaker. The debt amounts to $314,000 per key.\nIt was once the 13-story, Beaux-Arts-style Commercial Exchange Building, built in 1924, before Sydell Group redeveloped it in partnership with billionaire Ron Burkle\u2019s Yucaipa.\n\nFreehand Hotels is offering concessions, to book three nights and only pay for two, for all of its locations, including Downtown Los Angeles, according to its website. But it doesn\u2019t appear to have distress related to the others.\nLos Angeles\u2019 hotel market is struggling, and downtown is a hot mess.\nHomelessness is an ever-prevalent issue, and recent headlines dinged the region\u2019s hospitality industry. Tourism was already dragging, post-pandemic and post-wildfires, when President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown started, followed by protests.\nBesides that, costs are increasing for hoteliers amid a\nchallenging regulatory environment\n.\nSeparately, Brookfield Asset Management, is betting on Europe. The company, in May,\npurchased\nGenerator Hostels\u2019 European brand from Queensgate Investments for $869 million in a 15-hotel deal.\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s housing market is defying the national slowdown, with prices rising faster than in most of the country, even as sales volume plunged to the lowest August levels since 2011.\nThe median home price in the city hit $378,000 in August, up 5.9 percent year-over-year, according to Illinois Realtors. Across the nine-county metro, the median reached $375,000, up 5.6 percent. The national median was $422,600, a 2 percent bump, according to\nNational Association of Realtors\ndata first\nreported\nby Crain\u2019s.\nThe Case-Shiller Index confirmed the trend, showing July values in the region up 6.23 percent from a year earlier, compared with just 1.68 percent nationwide.\nThat makes\nChicago\nan outlier. Price growth here has stayed above 6 percent every month this year, and increased from June (6.09 percent) to July (6.23 percent) while nationally the rate has fallen by more than half since January. Half of the 30 major metros covered by the index had lower price growth in July than in June. The Illinois Realtors data comprises Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Grundy, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will counties.\nThe surge means equity gains and rising\nhousing wealth\nfor sellers and homeowners.\n\nBut for buyers, the math is tough. August sales in the city totaled just 1,920 homes, down nearly 10 percent from a year earlier and the weakest August since the post-crash recovery of 2011. Metro-wide sales dropped 4.3 percent to 8,395, also the lowest since 2011. By contrast, sales ticked up nationally 1.8 percent year-over-year, according to NAR.\nMeanwhile, contract cancellations are on the rise. Sixteen percent of pending agreements in Chicago were\ncanceled\n, a slight increase from last year and consistent with national trends showing the highest July cancellation rates since 2017.\nThe squeeze comes from a familiar combo: elevated mortgage rates and thin inventory. Homeowners who might otherwise trade up are staying put, wary of locking in higher borrowing costs and higher prices. That keeps listings scarce, pushing buyers to pay more for the limited homes available.\nChicago\u2019s unusual position \u2014 leading the nation in price gains while trailing badly in sales volume \u2014 is like a split personality in the market. Sellers are in a strong spot on paper, but deals are drying up. Chicago-area home sales in August were down year-over-year 0.8 percent.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "As Sonoma developer\nKen Mattson\nawaits trial for\nallegedly defrauding hundreds of local homeowners\n, one of his firm\u2019s lending partners has come under scrutiny of its own.\nVictims of Mattson have pointed out Socotra Capital\u2019s purported role in Mattson\u2019s wide-reaching alleged Ponzi scheme, The Press Democrat\nreported\n.\nThe Sacramento-based lender bankrolled much of Mattson\u2019s shopping spree, wherein KS Mattson Partners acquired 88 properties in and around the city of Sonoma. From 2007 to 2024, Mattson allegedly\nsold investors fake interests\nin real estate investment limited partnerships, using victims\u2019 money to fund personal expenses and pay other investors,\naccording\nto the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSocotra Capital provided Mattson\u2019s firms with more than 100 loans totaling upwards of $180 million, according to the Press Democrat. The loans covered notable local sites including Ravenswood Winery, boutique lodging properties like Cottage Inn &amp; Span and An Inn to Remember, and even chocolate factory Cocoa Planet. Many of those properties are now on the auction block in bankruptcies related to Mattson\u2019s dealings.\nSocotra holds liens on 75 properties tied to Mattson\u2019s network, court documents reviewed by the news outlet show. The debt totals more than $100 million. And while the hard-money lender has not been accused of wrongdoing, investors who lost money through Mattson\u2019s alleged fraud want to put a magnifying glass on the firm.\n\u201cFrom Socotra\u2019s website, they proclaim, \u2018We\u2019re not like your conventional lenders with strict parameters, slow turnarounds, and unnecessary hoops to jump through,\u2019\u201d Matt Treger, who invested with Mattson over more than 15 years, told the Press Democrat. \u201cAs someone whose life savings has been swallowed up, their business model seems clear evidence that parameters and hoops are an essential part of a just system.\u201d\n\nFederal prosecutors noted Socotra\u2019s role in the scandal by referring to it in the\nMay 13 indictment\nas \u201cLending Entity 1.\u201d For its part, Socotra denies knowledge of any of Mattson\u2019s actions.\n\u201cWith regards to KS Mattson [Partners], we had no knowledge or involvement in Mattson\u2019s alleged wrongdoing. Socotra acted appropriately and in accordance with the law at all times,\u201d a company spokesperson told the outlet. \u201cAs a secured, first-position lender, all our loans are secured by high-quality real estate, including those related to KS Mattson loans.\u201d\nMattson stands accused of wire fraud, money laundering and obstruction of justice in a nine-count indictment. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for each count of wire fraud and the obstruction of justice count and 10 years in prison for the money laundering count.\nSo far, Socotra hasn\u2019t faced legal complaints of its own from Mattson\u2019s investors or regulators.\n\u201cIn the aftermath of their lending spree, to continue putting profits over the victims in a scheme they enabled and benefitted from would feel morally reprehensible,\u201d Treger said. \u201cMy hope is that, as an investor group, we pursue every avenue to determine accountability and recompense\u2026 They may be trying to protect their profits, while we as victims are fighting for our lives and what was taken from us.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Since then, the cloud data company has transformed its headquarters into a hub for artificial intelligence moguls across the region.\nThe firm opened its \u201cSilicon Valley AI Hub\u201d last week. It\u2019s a 30,000-square-foot space on the top floor of its\nMenlo Park\nheadquarters, the San Francisco Standard\nreported\n.\nThe space is designed for companies and developers interested in AI to exchange knowledge and develop their products. In a recent event there, executives at OpenAI, Windsurf and\nGlean\ngave their ideas on how to scale AI startups, per the Standard.\nTo inaugurate the space, 13 startups will set up operations at the hub over the course of three months. They\u2019ll have access to coworking space, professional video studios and snacks for employees, as well as Snowflake\u2019s computing infrastructure and proximity to the firm\u2019s investor network.\nThat\u2019s not all; next year Snowflake will expand the space with a rooftop restaurant and bar, transforming it from a simple workspace to a destination for workers on and off the clock.\n\nThe public release of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT in 2022 prompted Snowflake to lean hard into AI. Between 2020 \u2014 when it had its IPO \u2014 and 2025, the company\u2019s headcount ballooned from 1,000 to 8,000. As the\nfirm grew\n, it needed space to accommodate all of its employees.\nLast year, it settled on\nsubleasing a 773,000-square-foot, three-building campus\nin Menlo Park that Meta had pre-leased and built out but never occupied. That deal is still the Bay Area\u2019s largest post-pandemic office lease.\nWith summer melting away, Snowflake is preparing for a blizzard of new releases. In November, the company is set to unveil a host of AI products. While it\u2019s partnered in the past with OpenAI and Anthropic to integrate language models into its products, Snowflake wants to cross-pollinate with as many AI voices as possible, and its AI hub is meant to be the meeting place.\nThe company plans to host up to 10 events a week at the AI hub, Snowflake chief marketing officer Denise Persson said. Those could include networking dinners, hackathons and educational sessions. The hope is that Snowflake will be able to discover and work with some of the brightest new minds in the\nbooming sector\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

She\u2019s converting the 37,000-square-foot warehouse, at 2501 Commerce Street, into an exhibition hall and event space, while the former lumber offices, at 25 Live Oak Alley, will become a 96-key boutique hotel with a rooftop bar.\nThe exhibition hall is slated to open in November with a splashy debut: the Balloon Museum, a global traveling art installation featuring large-scale inflatable sculptures. The $450,000 warehouse conversion is being designed by Conejo Architecture, and Molina told the outlet she\u2019s working \u201cseven days a week\u201d to meet the deadline, with weddings, quincea\u00f1eras and private events expected to follow.\nThe hotel, scheduled to open in time for the\n2026 World Cup\n, will add two floors to the historic 1938 concrete structure, bringing the building to four stories and 78,700 square feet. Designed by MCS Architects, the $4 million project won\u2019t carry a major hotel flag at launch.\n\nMolina, who founded Bonita Grand Holdings, bought the properties in 2019 and began planning last year.

The 51-key hotel, at 347 West 20th Street, is expected to open in early 2026. The developer is Austin-based Bunkhouse Hotels, the firm behind Hotel Saint Augustine in Montrose.\nThe timing also coincides with broader\ndevelopment momentum\naround Houston\u2019s East End, including the\noverhaul of the George R.
