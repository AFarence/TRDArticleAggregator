        "content": "Triangle Sports was about the furthest thing you could imagine from high-end retail \u2014 a Savage x Fenty store by Rihanna, for example.\nLike many Brooklyn kids, I shopped at Triangle in the 1970s and 1980s for balls, pucks and pads. It had a musty smell and stuff was piled everywhere. Sometimes you had to dig through bins to find what you needed.\nBut the sporting goods business at 182 Flatbush Avenue had much higher revenue than the Savage x Fenty that\nsigned a lease\nin 2022 to replace it. I know this because the new outpost\nstill hasn\u2019t opened\n.\nNor does its debut seem near. The ground floor is boarded up and the upper two floors are bricked up. While the other retail space near Barclays Center has enjoyed a resurgence, Rihanna hasn\u2019t put in the\nwork, work, work, work, work, work\nat 182 Flatbush.\nSigns of progress have been\nnonexistent\nbeyond a sign reading \u201cSavage x Fenty Signature Script Collection\u201d observed at the site in 2024. Alas, no one secured a permit for the advertisement, resulting in an ECB violation.\nWhen a blizzard hit late last month, plywood boards fell from the building onto the sidewalk, and neither Rihanna nor the landlord, Hidrock Properties\u2019 182 Flatbush Ave LLC, sent anyone to clear the snow, as you can see from the photograph above.\nThe city ignored the icy sidewalk but slapped Hidrock with a\n$12,500 violation\nfor the plywood mishap, which was resolved 12 days later. In 2023, the owner paid a $1,250 fine for\nleaving a storefront window open\nthree years after a gut demolition of the interior.\nThis is pocket change for Hidrock\u2019s LLC. All this time, Fenty has been paying \u201cdark rent,\u201d meaning rent for unused space, according to one of the Compass brokers who worked on the lease. Given that the asking rent was $650,000 per year, the total paid so far could be about $2.5 million.\nSo, while Rihanna has some\nwork\nto do, Hidrock seems to be doing fine at 182 Flatbush. In 2024, Hidrock\u2019s Abraham J. Hidary reduced the debt to $4 million from $5.2 million as he extended its mortgage with Israel Discount Bank, according to property records.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nThe name of 182 Flatbush Avenue\u2019s previous owner should ring a bell for\nTRD\nreaders. RedSky JZ purchased the property for $4.1 million in 2012 and sold it to Hidrock for $7 million in 2019.\nThat sale was a rare bright spot for RedSky at the time. By then, things were already\nfalling apart\nfor\nBen Bernstein\nand\nBen Stokes\n\u2019 firm, which had partnered with JZ Capital on that deal and others, assembling a\n$1 billion retail portfolio\n.\nStokes left RedSky in 2024, but his former Cornell squash team member Bernstein is still a principal, according to LinkedIn. Will either Ben ever make another billion-dollar run? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Real estate has something riding on the race to succeed retiring Rep. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez. Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who is among the most pro-housing elected officials in the city, is facing off in June\u2019s Democratic primary against Democratic Socialists of America member Claire Valdez, who serves in the state Assembly.\nReynoso is better known, more experienced and has deeper roots in the district, but Valdez has Mayor Zohran Mamdani\u2019s\nendorsement\n. It will be interesting to see how much support from the real estate industry Reynoso receives and accepts and whether it funds a PAC to attack Valdez, as it has done with other DSA candidates.\nElsewhere\u2026\nVoice of Gowanus, a group that formed in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the neighborhood\u2019s 2021 rezoning, continues to seek revenge against Brad Lander, who, as the local City Council member, spearheaded the new zoning.\nThis week, the group cheered Rep. Daniel Goldman for\nobjecting\nto a state cleanup plan and blasted Lander, who is challenging Goldman in this June\u2019s Democratic primary. Voice of Gowanus claimed that Lander wants to locate affordable housing and a school on a polluted site \u201cwithout the fully enforced remediation required by law, leaving behind a massive reservoir of coal tar underground.\u201d\nWhether you like Lander or hate him, he obviously doesn\u2019t want to endanger residents and students. Rather, Voice of Gowanus is trying to undermine his campaign as revenge for the rezoning, which is bringing more than 8,000 badly needed apartments to Brooklyn. It also wants to delay the 950-unit, all-affordable\nGowanus Green\nproject.\nThis is the classic NIMBY strategy of claiming that development would be dangerous to its users. Opponents of a Southern California project I just\nwrote about\nmade the same argument, citing not only wildfires but also pollution from chemicals used on the golf course where 398 homes would be built.\nNone of these people worried about golfers playing on chemically treated grass.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$15.5 million\nfor a 6,820-square-foot single-family home at 13 East 94th Street in Carnegie Hill. Serena Boardman of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty had the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$386 million\nfor roughly 368,000 square feet of office space and 28,000 square feet of retail at 555-557 Broadway in Soho. Publisher Scholastic sold the property to Empire State Realty Trust.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$18 million\nfor a 4,898-square-foot condominium unit at 200 East 79th Street on the Upper East Side. Elliman\u2019s Lauren Muss and Lisa Mathias have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 25,895-square-foot, six-story residential building at 2968 Valentine Avenue in Bedford Park. Jakov Saric of Node Architecture filed the permit on behalf of developer Franc Gjini.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

The Georgian Revival home at\n13 East 94th Street\nspans more than 6,800 square feet and sold for $15.5 million, or about $2,300 per square foot. The seller was an LLC tied to\nGeorge Logothetis\n, who is the executive chairman of the Libra Group, whose businesses span from aerospace to hotels. The buyer was\nCarnegie Hill LLC\n. The residence, which went on the market about a year ago with an asking price of $19.5 million, has six bedrooms, a gym, a custom eat-in chef\u2019s kitchen, wine storage and a garden.\nSerena Boardman\nwith Sotheby\u2019s International Realty had the listing.\n\ud83c\udfc6Commercial:\nThe top commercial real estate transfer recorded in New York was in Soho.\nEmpire State Realty Trust\n, the real estate investment trust led by\nAnthony Malkin\n, closed on its all-cash purchase of the\nScholastic Building at 555-557 Broadway\nfor $386 million.

        "content": "The bankruptcy sale of 5,151 apartments from Pinnacle Group to Summit Properties is on the eve of a possible confirmation.\nBut the sale was unable to close at a Thursday court hearing. The city and tenants had objected to the sale, prompting hours of cross examination and argument before a bankruptcy court judge. Despite conversations about a settlement between the parties, no agreement was reached by the end of the hearing, with an attorney for the city saying that getting approval from the administration would go beyond business hours.\nBy the end of the day, the U.S. bankruptcy court judge, David Jones, was considering arguments from tenants and the city that Summit Properties had failed to make adequate assurances that it could perform and cure the thousands of existing violations in the portfolio for sale.\nSummit CEO Zohar Levy had said in a declaration that Summit planned to spend $10 million in the first year on capital improvements and curing existing violations, with $30 million spent in the first five years.\nHowever, under questioning from attorneys for tenants and the city, Levy specified Summit had planned on just $3 million for the violations and that the money would not be put in escrow or confirmed in a bankruptcy order. The properties would be owned by individual LLCs and there would be no recourse to go after Summit as the parent. Levy testified remotely from Austria and said Summit had engaged REM Management to manage part of the portfolio.\nJones considered arguments that Summit had not shown \u201cadequate assurance of future performance\u201d as a purchaser. But he appeared to be encouraged by a promise by Flagstar Bank, which is the biggest creditor in the case and also the financier for Summit\u2019s potential purchase, that it would extend a $3 million line of credit to Summit to pull from should any of the repairs go over what was estimated. But Jones did not make a ruling Thursday.\nBefore final arguments, parties returned from a lunch break and told the court they had begun talking about a settlement. However, Zachary Kass, the city attorney, said the city would need to go through official channels, including engagement with Mayor Mamdani.\n\u201cGetting the city to do anything is a bit like turning a tanker,\u201d Kass said before the court, later adding that Mayor Mamdani had been engaged.\nAfter another break, the parties said they had exchanged numbers in a negotiation.\n\u201cSummit has the capacity and the commitment to preserve, restore, and improve the 5,151 units and the lives of the residents,\u201d according to Jordan Barowitz, a spokesperson for Summit, adding that the company \u201clooks forward to the Court\u2019s decision.\u201d\nIt\u2019s possible that a settlement will be discussed overnight. Kass said the city would feel more comfortable with some sort of guarantee from Summit.\nIn a declaration, Levy said only 420 units in the 5,151 unit portfolio had housing code violations.\nDespite talk of a potential insider connection in the deal concerning Jonathan Wiener, brother of Pinnacle\u2019s Joel Wiener, Jones said he was not convinced of any insider involvement.\nAn attorney for Flagstar argued that the city was trying to be unduly involved in a bankruptcy transaction.\n\u201cWhat they really want is to pick the buyer, to pick the price,\u201d the attorney said.\n",

Blackstone acquired the debt after Signature Bank\u2019s 2023 collapse.\nThe Chetrits are members of the high-profile family of investors that has\nmultiple\ndistressed properties\nin New York. The outlet was unable to reach them for comment.\nThe brothers have faced similar troubles before. In 2024,\ndebt dealer\nMaverick Real Estate Partners, which recently bought other Chetrit holdings at auction, sought to foreclose on their SoHo property at 447 Broadway over an unpaid $14.7 million Signature\u2011issued loan. In that case, the Chetrits argued that Signature\u2019s sudden failure deprived them of the opportunity to renegotiate terms.\nThat dispute\nwas settled\nfor an undisclosed amount earlier this year, suggesting they may raise similar arguments again.\nAccording to the new complaint, the Chetrits stopped making payments on the loan in December 2024. Blackstone issued a default notice in May demanding repayment of the remaining principal \u2014 now $15.6 million \u2014 and future rents from tenants, which include a law firm, a psychology practice and an Arthur Murray Dance Studio.\nThe building is 95 percent leased at roughly $40 per square foot, but the owners allegedly did not comply with the notice.\nFor decades, 286 Fifth belonged to the Kiamie family, led by Syrian immigrant and entrepreneur Najeeb Kiamie, whose Windsor Management still operates in the market. The Chetrits, through AB &amp; Sons Group, appear to have co\u2011owned the building with the Kiamies before taking full control.\nAB &amp; Sons signed an $11.1 million mortgage in 2007, and later the 2017 loan that\u2019s now in dispute. The building changed hands internally in 2022, with ownership transferred to an entity called Zhora State Equities.\nBlackstone acquired a large portion of Signature\u2019s loan book in late 2023, including the debt tied to 286 Fifth Avenue. Court filings show AB &amp; Sons\u2019 members include Eli\u2019s son, Abraham.\nAttorneys for the ownership entities either declined to comment or were unavailable, according to Crain\u2019s.\n\u2013 Joel Russell\n",

Rockefeller.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Serena Boardman, who represented the previous seller in 2011, had the listing. The home initially hit the market in December 2024, asking $19.5 million before Boardman dropped the price to $17.5 million two months later.\nThe sale is the latest Gilded Age-era townhouse to sell\nafter a price cut\n. A home at\n973 Fifth Avenue\nsold for $46 million in May after initially asking $80 million in 2021, and the\nWoolworth Mansion\nclosed for $38 million after seeking as much as $90 million over a decade ago (more recently, the home sought $50 million).\nSpanning 6,820 square feet, the Carnegie Hill home features six bedrooms and four full bathrooms.\nThe renovated home has a basement gym and wine storage, a fully-terraced back garden and wood- and gas-burning fireplaces. The third floor has a bedroom and a south-facing wood-paneled library, and the primary suite on the floor above comes with a sitting room, dressing room and bathroom with a shower and soaking tub.\nThe top floor has four additional bedrooms, one of which has a terrace, and a large skylight.\nLogothetis founded Libra out of his father\u2019s shipping company and eventually diversified its holdings to encompass a slew of other industries including aerospace, hospitality and real estate. The company has a strategic interest in the luxury hotel brand Auberge Resort Collections after Grace Hotels merged with Auberge in 2018, according to the company\u2019s website.\nLogothetis and his wife, Nitzia, previously owned a condo at the prestigious 15 Central Park West,\nwhich they sold for $24 million in 2011\n.\n",

        "content": "\ud83c\udfc6 Residential:\nThe top home sale recorded in South Florida came in at $58.3 million, as\nMichael Chu\n, co-founder and executive chairman of private equity firm L Catterton, and his wife\nElizabeth Chu\nparted with a home at\n102 Angler Avenue\nin Palm Beach. The buyer was a trust. The nearly 8,000-square-foot home has five bedrooms, seven full bathrooms and two half baths. The deal appears to have been off market.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe top commercial transaction to hit records was\nGL Homes\u2019\nacquisition of 220 acres of land along\n140th Avenue North\nin Westlake from\nMinto Communities\n, the master developer of Westlake, for $80 million. GL Homes plans to merge the newly acquired acres with a 120-acre site it bought in 2024, according to the\nSouth Florida Business Journal\n. The developer intends to build 1,000 homes on the combined site.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nRestaurateur\nBarton Weiss\n, also known as Barton G., sold his home at\n1535 West 27th Street\nin Miami Beach to an LLC tied to\nDavid Moradi\n, an entrepreneur and investor, for $29.3 million. The deal for the more than 12,000-square-foot Sunset Islands mansion works out to about $2,400 per square foot. The Mediterranean-style home has nine bedrooms and nine and a half baths and sits along the canal. The property hit the market in March at $39.5 million. Jill and Danny Hertzberg of the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker had the listing, and One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s\nMarko Gojanovic\nbrought the buyer.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Paul Wick\n, a financier, and his wife\nKarin Wick\n, an attorney, via a trust scooped up a newly built, four-bedroom penthouse at the Vita at Grove Isle at\n5 Grove Isle Drive\nin Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove. The price was about $20.1 million. The pad has 6,900 square feet of interior space and more than 5,100 square feet of exterior space. The luxury condominium was developed by\nUgo Colombo\u2019s CMC Group.\nBy the Numbers:\nU.S. existing home sales surge as borrowing costs drop\nThanks to falling borrowing costs and slowing home price growth, existing-home sales in the U.S. surged by 5.1 percent in December compared to the month before.\nThere were 4.35 million existing-home sales last month \u2014 the strongest month in almost three years, according to the\nNational Association of Realtors\n, whose data has been seasonally adjusted.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "Exiled\nIranian Americans in real estate\nwatching deadly protests from afar may not agree on a path to peace, but they\u2019re united in seeing this moment as an opening for democratic change in Iran.\nDemonstrations began across the country starting on Dec. 28 when Iranians took to the streets to protest economic conditions, namely inflation. The protests quickly spread with demonstrators numbering in the millions in just a few days. The Iranian government responded with an internet blackout that provided cover to security forces killing protesters; days later, the death toll is in the thousands. President Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene.\nIranians who fled to the U.S. during the 1979 revolution, many of whom settled in California,\nNew York\nand\nTexas\n, haven\u2019t been able to return. Among them is Mehrdad Moayedi, the founder of Dallas-based firm Centurion American Development, who left Tehran in 1976 and moved to Fort Worth at the age of 15. He\u2019s been in North Texas ever since.\nMoayedi, who started with a small landscaping business and became the\nregion\u2019s most prolific single-family lot developer\n, credits his success to the freedom and business friendliness of Texas and the U.S., which he calls \u201cthe greatest country in the world.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anything more in my life than to see Iran become more democratic, like the United States,\u201d he said when asked about the protests. \u201cHaving said that, I think we\u2019re at a crossroads and we need some help.\u201d\nA fervent supporter of President Trump, Moayedi approves of his response to the crisis. From his perspective, the U.S. should provide weapons to unarmed Iranians, and Israel should intervene \u201cbecause it has the infrastructure.\u201d\nMoayedi sees the conflict as similar to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, except \u201cthose people are armies.\u201d In Iran, protesters \u201cdon\u2019t have any way of protecting themselves.\u201d\nJewish Iranian developer\nShahab Karmely\n, who operates in New York and South Florida, agrees with Moayedi. His father, who was in the rug business and owned real estate in Iran, was put on a death list but managed to escape with the family in 1978. Karmely, after being deported from the U.S., was taken in as a refugee in the U.K.\n\u201cThe west needs to understand there\u2019s no negotiation [with this regime]. I think President Trump has woken up to this,\u201d Karmely said. \u201cThe bloodshed is beyond anything we can imagine. The same way the Nazis had to go, this regime has to go.\u201d\nThough he stopped short of advocating for a direct invasion, Karmely said \u201cthe time for action is now,\u201d adding that \u201cthe streets are literally awash in the blood of young people.\u201d\nWhile\nAustin-based developer Ari Rastegar\nhas never visited his father\u2019s homeland, \u201cMy entire life has been these conversations and the trauma that ensued from it,\u201d he said. Born in Austin in 1982, Rastegar, who founded Rastegar Property Company, grew up listening to stories from his grandfather, who was the shah\u2019s doctor.\nLike Moayedi, he\u2019d like to see Iran\u2019s leader be someone chosen by the people of Iran, but Rastegar is skeptical about the involvement of superpowers, favoring grassroots leadership that\u2019s \u201cauthentically Iranian.\u201d And, like the diaspora at large, they disagree on how exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi should be involved in the process.\nPahlavi, the son of the last shah of Iran, moved to the U.S. at age 18 in 1978 for pilot training as a cadet in the Imperial Iranian Air Force. A face of opposition to Iran\u2019s government, he has encouraged recent protests.\nMoayedi is optimistic about Pahlavi, suggesting he could lead Iran through transition until the country can elect a leader.\nRastegar disagrees, \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about running a global government, one of the oldest countries in the history of mankind,\u201d he said about Pahlavi. \u201cLet\u2019s find somebody that knows what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\nMoayedi and Rastegar, men from different generations who were born in different countries, agree the conflict shouldn\u2019t be used to fuel Islamophobia.\n\u201cIslam doesn\u2019t teach that kind of stuff,\u201d Moayedi said. \u201cThese are just goons and gangsters killing people left and right.\u201d\nIslam is a \u201cvery peaceful, beautiful religion,\u201d echoed Rastegar. \u201cThis is a dictator fuckhead thing. This is not a Muslim thing.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Southern California\u2019s brokerage consolidation continues with Coldwell Banker Real Estate inking yet another franchise agreement that will give it more weight in Orange County and the Inland Empire.\nJessie Rodriguez and Aaron Juarez, formerly of Cal American Homes, are the latest franchise partners with Coldwell Banker, bringing roughly 25 agents into the company\u2019s fold. The new entity has been renamed Coldwell Banker Icon.\nThis latest local move comes a week after Compass and Coldwell Banker parent Anywhere Real Estate closed on their\n$4.2 billion merger\n. The combined business of the nation\u2019s two largest brokerages now counts about 340,000 agents \u2014 and growing.\nThe newest addition, Coldwell Banker Icon, plans to open a South Orange County office by the end of the month and another in Rancho Cucamonga, about 35 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, Rodriguez told\nThe Real Deal\n. The Inland Empire office will be established through the acquisition of an existing company that, if finalized, will add another 60 agents to the roster. The details of both offices will be disclosed once those moves are finalized.\n\u201cI get to be independent still, but now I\u2019ve got this 120-year-old brand behind me that\u2019s recognizable,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cI thought, the sky\u2019s the limit.\u201d\nRodriguez launched Cal American Homes around 2009 with an office in Rancho Cucamonga at a time when the region was still reeling from the subprime mortgage meltdown. About three years ago, he decided to move the business to Real Brokerage\u2019s digital platform. With the market becoming more rugged last year, being virtual wasn\u2019t working for his agents. After exploring \u201ctraditional brands\u201d for nearly a year, Rodriguez and Juarez decided to link with Coldwell Banker.\n\u201cI just loved it. It\u2019s elegant. It\u2019s luxurious, yet the common person knows the brand,\u201d Rodriguez said, and the then-pending merger with Compass didn\u2019t give him pause. \u201cThis is all at the same time we\u2019re hearing about Compass is going to buy Anywhere and what does that mean? I don\u2019t care what it means. I like Coldwell Banker. I like their leadership. I like their brand. I like their messaging.\u201d\nThe establishment of Coldwell Banker Icon is the latest deal to quickly add scale to Coldwell Banker\u2019s Southern California ranks. But, it is small relative to the franchise agreement the Anywhere Real Estate brand struck in November with a\nBerkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties\nfranchisee.\nThat deal late last year renamed the BHHSCP affiliate Coldwell Banker Envision and added over 1,300 agents and 14 offices in Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Orange counties.\nIn 2025, that affiliate business was\nranked sixth\nin Los Angeles County with volume of $2.4 billion in on-market deals within Los Angeles County between July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025, according to\nTRD Data\n.\nThe franchise agreement did not include BHHSCP\u2019s company-owned business or three other franchisees in Sierra Madre, Palos Verdes, Redondo Beach and San Luis Obispo.\n",

Aldermen framed the move as a rare example of an industry volunteering to shoulder a new tax rather than asking the city to spread the pain elsewhere.\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking one for the team here,\u201d said Alderman Brian Hopkins. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is supporting the entire hospitality sector and tourism industry.\u201d\nThe proposal has been championed by Choose Chicago and the Illinois Hotel and Lodging Association, which argue that hotel tax revenue meant to support tourism has increasingly been siphoned off to general city needs. IHLA President and CEO\nMichael Jacobson\ntold aldermen at the meeting that money generated by hotel taxes has \u201ceroded,\u201d as it\u2019s been diverted to infrastructure, general funds and other priorities.\nUnder the plan, the new surcharge would generate an estimated $40 million a year, money that would be controlled by downtown hotel owners and\nChoose Chicago\n. That would more than double the tourism agency\u2019s current annual budget of roughly $33 million, giving it more firepower to compete for conventions, trade shows and leisure travelers in an increasingly crowded national marketplace, according to the outlet.\n\u201cThis is simply allowing Chicago to level the playing field, particularly with our major competitive markets,\u201d Jacobson said, noting that more than 200 markets nationwide already use tourism improvement districts.\nChicago welcomed about 55.3 million visitors in 2024, up 6.5 percent from the year before, but still short of the 61.6 million tourists who came in 2019, according to the publication.\nThe district would initially run for five years before requiring renewal. Several aldermen expressed appreciation \u2014 and some surprise \u2014 that hotel owners are backing the added cost.\n\u201cNot a lot of people come and say, \u2018Please tax us for more,\u2019\u201d said Alderman Andre Vasquez.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Michael N. Lerner and his partners offloaded a newly built Uptown apartment complex for $21.4 million, as a bitter legal battle between the developer and his prominent Chicago real estate family has reached a ceasefire.\nA New York-based investment group acquired the 57-unit\nHarmony Apartments at 4511 North Clark Street\n, according to Essex Realty Group, which brokered the deal. The sale lands roughly $1.1 million below the $22.5 million asking price outlined in the property\u2019s listing materials. Essex\u2019s Jordan Gottlieb and Rick Ofman represented the sellers.\nThe sale has not yet hit public records, and the buyer\u2019s identity is not disclosed.\nWhile Essex touted the deal as a win for the Sheridan Park area of Uptown, the transaction plays out against the backdrop of a messy, years-long feud between Lerner and his parents, including Michael J. Lerner, the head of prolific multifamily firm\nMCZ Development\n.\nThe younger Lerner had been entangled in a\nweb of litigation\nwith his parents, who accused him of mismanaging funds and failing to repay loans tied to various projects. Those disputes, which at one point led to the appointment of a receiver to manage some of the family\u2019s contested assets, have started to wind down, with a handful of lawsuits settled in 2025, online court records show.\nBut it\u2019s unclear from public documents if the disposal of the Clark Street property was mandated by those settlements, or if any proceeds will be funneled back to the parental trust that fueled much of the finger-pointing and litigation. The trust alleged that the son\nspent well above his means\nby putting family companies and entities on the hook for debts he took on without sharing loan proceeds, among other purported breaches of contracts.\nThe younger Lerner co-owned the Uptown property with investors Stan and Eugene Bernshteyn, records show, though it\u2019s unclear how much equity each had in the development. The sellers and their representatives didn\u2019t return a request for comment and neither did an attorney for the parental Lerner trust.\nThe deal follows a string of\ndistress and liquidations\nfor Michael N. Lerner. In November, a separate foreclosure case brought by Fannie Mae against him was resolved through the $9.5 million sale of the Chicago collateral property to an entity tied to William Gold\u2019s locally based real estate firm GPO Development Group.\nIn 2023, a high-profile skirmish between Lerner and his father over a\n$35 million Fulton Market development site deal\nwas also resolved through a legal settlement, following the sale to Miami-based developer Crescent Heights.\nFor the Uptown buyer, the acquisition yields a stabilized building in a supply-constrained pocket of the North Side. A source told\nThe Real Deal\nthe buyer owns another multifamily property purchased somewhat recently in Chicago.\nCompleted in 2024, the Harmony building includes 56 apartments and ground-floor commercial space occupied by the Black Ensemble Theater.\nMarketing materials for the property projected a 2025 net operating income of about $1.47 million. The retail space, though, had the nonprofit theater organization on a rent abatement that ran through July, according to marketing materials.\nStill, the Black Ensemble Theater is bringing far more value just a block away: Chicago\u2019s Plan Commission last year approved the nonprofit\u2019s Performing Arts Education and Media Technology Center for the property at 4450 North Clark Street, a $76 million complex that will include educational and performance spaces, media and commercial spaces, 53 affordable apartments and parking.\n",

The property is located at 7th Street and Castro Street between Interstate 880 and 960 and is owned by real estate investors Frank and Daphne Yang. A list price has not been disclosed.\nThe 7th and Castro site is zoned for commercial and residential uses with a maximum of 278 units and eight stories. A developer could buy the location and take advantage of the state\u2019s\naffordable housing density bonus\nto increase the unit and height limitations significantly depending on how many affordable units are built.\nIn 2021, developer Wise Investments Enterprise\nsubmitted a pre-application\nto build a 24-story residential tower with 400 to 500 units at the site, San Francisco YIMBY reported at the time. In order to qualify for the state density bonus, the project designated 15 percent of the apartments units as affordable housing, which also allowed the height maximum to increase 190 feet higher than what zoning rules would normally allow. Previous renderings from\nWalnut Creek\n-based LCA Architects showed a four-story parking garage in the building, but the proposal appears to be inactive, according to the Business Times.\nThe 600 Castro site is subject to an S-14 housing overlay zone because it is listed in the city\u2019s housing element, thus guaranteeing the parcel will be used for housing. It also ensures ministerial design review for the project. The site is in a federal opportunity zone, which offers investors tax benefits to promote investment in certain communities as a way of increasing economic growth and job creation.\nThe area around 600 Castro has seen various proposals for housing arise in recent years. At the\n55-acre Howard Terminal site\n, the Oakland Athletics\npreviously floated\nbuilding a new baseball stadium as well as housing and commercial space before the team left town in 2024. An empty lot at 500 Kirkham Street in West Oakland was once entitled for 1,032 housing units, but was seized by its lender in 2023 and put\non the market\nat a $5 million bargain-basement price last fall, the Business Times reported.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Denver-based DoubleBay Partners and Chicago-based Midloch Investment Partners sold the property. Marcus &amp; Millichap\u2019s Mark Thiel and Cory Gross brokered the transaction.\nDoubleBay and Midloch purchased the building in May 2025 for $3.9 million.

        "content": "Homebuilders across North Texas spent much of 2025 pulling back on new construction as demand softened and inventory piled up in what\u2019s increasingly a buyer\u2019s market.\nThat\u2019s according to new data issued in a report from Residential Strategies, a residential market research company. The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat builders in the Dallas-Fort Worth area started construction on 8,386 homes in the fourth quarter, down 17.7 percent from 10,190 in the same period of the prior year. For the full year, starts totaled 41,222 for-sale homes, a 12.3 percent drop from 46,991 in 2024, according to RSI data.\n\u201cIt is very clear that builder profits will be much lower in 2026 compared to 2025, as DFW remains a buyer\u2019s market,\u201d Ted Wilson, a principal at Residential Strategies, wrote in the analysis.\nThe resale market hasn\u2019t offered much relief. Existing home sales in North Texas inched up 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending November, even as listings jumped more than 12 percent to 32,300, according to the Texas A&amp;M Real Estate Center.\nThe slowdown reflects a broader cooling in the region\u2019s economic tailwinds. Job growth in DFW weakened sharply last year, with the metro adding just 18,000 net new jobs in 2025, according to the Texas Workforce Commission. That\u2019s a far cry from the roughly 95,000 jobs that were added each year in the metroplex between 2010 and 2023.\nBuilders\nare also staring at a\nglut of land\n. North Texas ended 2025 with about 110,000 vacant developed lots and another 68,000\nlots in the development pipeline\n, Residential Strategies said.\nThe firm noted early signs of increased traffic heading into 2026, which may not translate cleanly into profits, and fourth quarter prospective buyer traffic leveled off at the end of 2025.\n\u201cBuilders have been able to sell to a backlog of pent-up demand in DFW, but affordability challenges have required price discounting, rate buy-downs, and other incentives,\u201d Wilson said in the report, cutting into margins.\nAt year-end, DFW had 12,317 finished vacant homes, slightly up from the prior quarter, reinforcing\nbuilders\u2019 decisions\nto slow starts while trimming prices on standing inventory. Closings followed the same trajectory. Builders closed on 10,473 homes in the fourth quarter, down 5.5 percent, year-over-year. For all of 2025, closings fell to about 45,000, compared with nearly 48,000 in 2024, according to the data.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Despite the show\u2019s name, the property is in the ritzy neighborhood of Brentwood.\nIt\u2019s the first time in 48 years the mansion has been up for sale. The two-story home was built in 1937 and features six bedrooms and seven-and-a-half bathrooms. The home spans approximately 10,000 square feet and the corner lot itself is 38,510 square feet. The home\u2019s actual footprint is smaller than the fictional Banks family abode on the show, which was said to have 10 bedrooms and four-and-a-half bathrooms.\nWhoever buys the house would move into a neighborhood popular among stars. In 2023, Judd Apatow\nsold his home next door\nat 239 North Bristol Avenue for $27 million. The \u201cFresh Prince\u201d house is located two blocks from O.J. Simpson\u2019s Rockingham estate, which grabbed headlines during the late-football player\u2019s murder trial in the 1990s. Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan currently lives in the same neighborhood.\nThe home is currently being used as a filming location for an unnamed Netflix series, according to TMZ.

        "content": "The fiefdoms of Dallas already survived a Compass campaign. One reigning firm is fortifying its ramparts as Compass\ngrows even larger\n.\nKeith Conlon, the CEO of homegrown Dallas luxury brokerage Allie Beth Allman &amp; Associates, recently acquired an ownership stake in the firm in an\nequity investment deal\nwith its parent company, Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based HomeServices of America. The deal aims to keep the company\u2019s center of authority local as\nCompass\ngathers more teams under its banner after its merger with Anywhere Real Estate was finalized earlier this month.\nThe deal also aims to preserve the variety of Dallas\u2019 luxury market, as other Texas markets fuse under\nCompass and its affiliated companies\n.\nBrands founded in Dallas dominate the market. It\u2019s the only city of the state\u2019s three top luxury markets in which the\nbiggest sale of the year\nwas represented by agents outside of Compass or the brands under its umbrella. Two Allie Beth Allman agents negotiated the sale of\n6601 Hunters Glen Road\nin Dallas for $30.5 million, the state\u2019s most expensive residential sale of 2025. Meanwhile, Compass had both sides of the sale for\n2110 River Oaks Boulevard\nin Houston, asking $18.9 million, and Kuper Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent Bridget Ramey represented both parties in the sale of\n13330 Shore Vista Drive in Austin\n.\nIt\u2019s not just the biggest sale of the year. Of the top 10 deals in the Metroplex last year, a minority involved a Compass agent, and most involved an agent with one of several Dallas-based brands: Allie Beth Allman, Ebby Halliday Realtors, Dave Perry-Miller Real Estate or Synergy Real Estate. Alongside Allie Beth Allman, Ebby Halliday and Dave Perry-Miller, which are also owned by HomeServices of America, had agents on more than one deal. Dallas firms Brexen and Rogers Healy crop up more in lower-range listings.\nThat\u2019s not the case in Austin or Houston.\nAustin is as varied a market as Dallas, but not with locally-founded brands. Coldwell Banker, Engel &amp; Volkers, Christie\u2019s International and eXp Realty all landed on the Travis County leaderboard last year alongside Compass, Kuper Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, and Moreland Properties, Compass\u2019 most significant local competitor in the Austin market. Moreland is the only local brokerage with an agent on more than one of the top 10 deals.\n\u201cAll of our key competitors are typically Compass, Sotheby\u2019s, Christie\u2019s. You know, these bigger brands that are all franchises and basically\nnow all owned by Compass\n,\u201d said Sarah Railey, president and broker of Moreland Properties.\nMeanwhile, Compass rules Houston. Just one of the top 10 residential deals inked in Houston last year did not involve a Compass agent: the sale of a home at\n3996 Inverness Drive\n, represented on both sides of the deal by Nancy Almodovar, founder of Nan &amp; Co.\nAt the top echelon of Houston\u2019s residential market, Nan &amp; Co has no other consistent competition apart from Compass, Almodovar claimed.\n\u201cWhen we go pitch to a luxury listing, it\u2019s typically just Compass and us,\u201d Almodovar said.\nAllie Beth Allman &amp; Associates, Nan &amp; Co and Moreland Properties all weathered a Compass recruitment blitz in 2018 and 2019 that significantly dented other groups.\nNan &amp; Co lost no agents to Compass in 2018, but plenty of other brokerages did. Some \u201cshut down,\u201d according to Almodovar.\nIn Austin, Moreland Properties \u201cchose not to entertain a meeting\u201d with Compass about joining the company, Railey said.\n\u201cCompass would come in and buy companies, not necessarily shutter them,\u201d Railey said.\nAllie Beth Allman, which fields about 400 agents,\nreportedly\nlost 35 agents to Compass then, a third of what Briggs Freeman Sotheby\u2019s lost.\n\u201cThey did a great job of getting some of the top people in the city,\u201d Conlon said.\nHe\u2019s optimistic the equity investment deal will help preserve local control in the increasing homogeneous luxury brokerage world.\n\u201cThe last thing I want to do is hamstring our organization because things aren\u2019t going well in Northern California or New York, wherever it may be,\u201d Conlon said.\n",

That\u2019s $182,000 per acre. The builder plans to acquire another tract for $40 million next year, the South Florida Business Journal\nreported\n.\nMinto Communities USA, Westlake\u2019s master developer, was the seller.\nThe acquisition gives GL Homes control of one of the largest undeveloped tracts in the county, as residential and commercial development continues to push westward. Housing, retail and civic amenities have taken shape in Westlake, said Misha Ezratti, GL\u2019s president.\nGL Homes plans to combine the newly acquired land with a 120-acre site it already owns in the city, creating a development footprint large enough for more than 1,000 homes. The builder bought the 120-acre parcel for $29.4 million in 2024 and later completed a land swap with Minto to make the site contiguous, Ezratti said.\nDesign work for the community is still underway, and GL Homes has not yet disclosed the mix of homes or pricing.\nWestlake spans about 3,800 acres and is entitled for 4,500 homes and 2 million square feet of commercial space. Multiple builders are active in the city. The community includes a water park, skate park and sports courts.\nThe deal further cements GL Homes\u2019 growing presence in northwest Palm Beach County. The builder previously developed homes at Arden, south of Westlake, and controls the nearby 5,000-acre Indian Trails site, which is entitled for just under 4,000 homes.\nLarge\u2011scale master\u2011planned projects dominate development activity in the area. They include Minto\u2019s 4,800\u2011acre\nAvenir\ncommunity in Palm\u202fBeach Gardens, which includes nearly 4,000 homes, a hotel, medical offices, retail space and a 2,400\u2011acre nature preserve.\nDevelopers such as Minto and Lennar are investing heavily in the area, but face infrastructure limits and increasing scrutiny from municipalities concerned about preserving\nhome\u2011rule authority over zoning\n.\n\u2014 Rachel Stone",

        "content": "It\u2019s clear who the losers are in Houston\u2019s\nwave of multifamily distress\n, but it hasn\u2019t yet been obvious how to cash in on the cycle.\nRREAF Holdings\u2019 latest buy provides a template. The Dallas-based investor picked up 2828 at Royal Oaks, a 510-unit garden-style apartment complex at 2828 Hayes Road in Westchase, according to a press release. Deed records show RREAF bought the property after its previous owner lost it to foreclosure.\nMinneapolis-based AB CarVal Investors took control of the property in August in a $20 million credit bid after Wilbraham, Massachusetts-based Colony Hills Capital allegedly defaulted on the $65.2 million loan tied to the property, deed records show. RREAF partnered with Axonic Capital to buy it from AB CarVal Investors for an undisclosed price.\nColony Hills Capital bought the property in 2021 as multifamily investors swept through Texas, picking up aging apartment buildings, with plans to fix them up, raise rents and sell them at a profit. Interest rates blew up their business plans, and many of these investors started losing properties to foreclosure in 2024.\nAs another layer in this distressed multifamily sale, the former owner partnered with Maverick County Housing Finance Corporation (HFC) to get property tax breaks on the property, using a loophole known as a \u201ctraveling\u201d housing finance corporation. Colony Hills Capital sold the property to Maverick County HFC, an affordable housing organization 330 miles from Houston, and leased the ground.\nIn the 2025 legislative session,\nGov. Greg Abbott signed a bill\nclosing the loophole, which became a popular cost-cutting tool for multifamily syndicators and investors. Some municipalities took the passage of HB 21 as justification to revoke property tax credits for these deals, although the law provides operators time to come into compliance.\nThe loss of these tax credits has\nexacerbated the wave of distress\nhitting Texas multifamily properties. Houston has been hit particularly hard; for the last year,\nHouston multifamily\nprojects have made up the majority of loans tied to commercial real estate that hit the foreclosure auction block in Texas. In January, troubled\nHouston multifamily loans made up $198 million\nof the $826 million tied to properties across the Texas Triangle headed to auction, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service.\nRREAF is picking up where Colony Hills Capital left off.\nThe new owner plans to rebrand the property built in 1995 as Aura Westchase, with 37 percent of units scheduled for renovation this year. The revamp will also include new signage and upgraded amenities.\nThe purchase adds to RREAF\u2019s 2,000-unit Houston multifamily portfolio. It was RREAF\u2019s third distressed multifamily purchase of 2025 and its first purchase with Axonic Capital, according to the release.\n",

The arbitrator ordered Maidman to pay $22 million in damages.\nResles\u2019 attorney, David Feuerstein, characterized the conduct as \u201ctantamount to theft\u201d and has now filed a lawsuit in New York County Supreme Court to enforce the award.\nAn attorney for Maidman declined to comment to Crain\u2019s.\nCourt records indicate that Maidman transferred seven penthouses to an entity that included his family but excluded Resles, took out loans secured by those units and kept the proceeds. He also arranged for the jointly owned company to issue more than $20 million in interest\u2011free loans to Maidman\u2011controlled entities, while simultaneously collecting an 8.7 percent preferred return for managing the property.\nResles\u2019 firm, Oxford Capital, said the maneuvers drained so much cash from the project that it never made a single dollar in distributions.\nThe ruling marks a significant setback for Maidman, whose family has been active in New York real estate since 1933 and owns about 1,000\nrental units\nthrough its Townhouse Management Company, where Mitchel Maidman serves as CEO. Holdings include a Chelsea hotel and Upper East Side townhouses.\nThe family previously controlled a long\u2011vacant West 42nd Street site before the Durst Organization ultimately took over and developed the Bank of America Tower.\nMurray Hill, on Manhattan\u2019s East Side, has become a hotbed for residential development, including a\n157-unit project\nfrom Brause Realty and a 137-unit luxury\ncondo development\nfrom Continuum Company.\n\u2013 Joel Russell\n",

The eight-bedroom, 10-bathroom and three half-bathroom house was completed last year. It sits on a 1.2-acre lot.\nMas, who Forbes estimates is worth about $3.5 billion, has been buying and selling homes under the radar for years. A quit-claim deed transfer of ownership for the Casuarina Concourse sale was recorded in late December without a price, but a source told\nThe Real Deal\nMas paid $75 million for the property.\nThat price marks a record for Coral Gables. Last year, luxury homebuilder Alex Pirez sold his waterfront Gables Estates mansion at 340 Leucadendra Drive\nfor $55 million,\nwhich set a new record at the time,\nTRD\npreviously reported.\nAttorney Roland Sanchez-Medina signed the deed on behalf of the seller, records show. Mas\u2019 ownership is hidden via a land trust.\nIn December, a\ntrust owned by Mas\nand his wife sold the 13,500-square-foot home at 6312 Riviera Drive to a land trust managed by attorney Richard Barbara.\nAround the same time, he sold the\n7.3-acre residential lot\noff of Douglas Road in the Grove to a hidden buyer, sources previously told\nTRD\n. That off-market trade was not recorded with Miami-Dade County, and the buyer is unknown. Sources said Mas purchased the waterfront lot this year and flipped it. His purchase was not recorded, and it suggests that he acquired the LLC that owned the lot.\nIn addition to his role at MasTec, Mas is also managing owner of\nInter Miami CF\n, the Major League Soccer team part-owned by David Beckham. Inter Miami is building its mixed-use soccer complex near Miami International Airport.\nBillionaire buyers have been increasingly active since early December, residential brokers say.\nSome prospective buyers are driven by the proposed wealth tax in California. Larry Page, a co-founder of Google, recently paid about\n$173 million\nfor two homes in Coconut Grove, including the 4.5-acre waterfront compound at 3585 Anchorage Way, and the 10,400-square-foot mansion at 3085 Munroe Drive.\n",

        "content": "One of the most recognizable pieces of San Francisco\u2019s skyline will soon have a new owner.\nSan Francisco-based real estate manager and developer DivcoWest has agreed to buy a significant stake in 101 California, the block-wide, 48-story column of steel and glass at the heart of the Financial District, according to a source close to the deal.\nThe transaction would move one of the city\u2019s premiere pieces of commercial real estate in the most significant office trade in years.\nThe seller is the Hong Kong Monetary Fund, according to Green Street News. The HKMF has owned part of the tower since 2012, when it teamed up with the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund, GIC Private Limited, to purchase\na 92 percent stake in the building\n.\nThe stark, 600-foot-tall cylinder contains more than 1.2 million square feet of office space, and hosts tenants such as Chime, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The structure occupies a full block, bound north and south by California and Pine streets, with Davis and Front streets to east and west.\nHines recently put $75 million into a ground-floor renovation\nthat upgraded the outdoor plaza and added a cafe and lounge. That project, drawn up before the pandemic, was completed in 2023.\nThe property still carries a $755 million loan that comes due in 2029. As of September 2025, the building was 82 percent occupied, according to Morningstar Credit.\nAccording to the source, the deal has not yet closed. It is unclear how much of the property DivcoWest has purchased. GIC owns the majority stake, and Texas\u2013based developer Hines \u2014 who developed the property in 1982, and still manages the asset \u2014 owns a less than 10 percent stake.\nDivcoWest manages more than 24 million square feet of real estate assets, worth about $18 billion, across the U.S. Its properties include 540 Madison Ave, a 39-story office tower in Manhattan, and 300 and 301 Howard St in San Francisco, a pair of buildings that contain more than 730,000 square feet of office space in the SOMA neighborhood. The company also holds property in cities such as Austin, Seattle, Los Angeles and Boston.\nThe 101 California tower\nhit the market late last year\nat $900 per square foot, giving the skyscraper a roughly $1.1 billion valuation, a price that was widely viewed as the best test to date of the appetite for prime property in San Francisco. The city struggled to rebound after the pandemic but has appeared to hit a vein of gold once again as the center of gravity for the artificial intelligence industry. San Francisco still carries a nearly 33 percent office vacancy rate, but\ndemand has surged and 2025 marked the best office leasing year\nfor the city since 2019, with 10.2 million square feet of leases signed, according to CBRE.\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely off the bottom\u201d of the market, Colin Yasukochi, head of CBRE\u2019s tech arm, told\nThe Real Deal.\nHe called 101 California \u201cone of the most prominent buildings\u201d and that \u201cany renewed investment or commitment to staking space in that building does make a mark.\u201d\nStill, even the $900 per square foot price proposed by the sellers of 101 California, falls below its 2018 valuation of more than $1.4 billion \u2014 nearly $1,200 per square foot.\nDespite the rush for high-quality office space \u2014 almost 90% of San Francisco office leases in the fourth quarter of 2025 were in Class A buildings \u2014 major trades in the city\u2019s trophy market have been minimal in San Francisco since the pandemic. One private equity executive told\nThe Real Deal\nthat, despite the AI boom, borrowing money remains tough for office investments.\n\u201cThe opportunities in San Francisco are probably to get a piece of trophy space, like 101 California, or go buy a class B building and spend a ton of money to make it an attractive and competitive office space,\u201d the executive said.\n",

        "content": "Billionaire Larry Page is doubling down on artificial intelligence in Silicon Valley \u2014 even as he tries to move one of his startups\u2019 headquarters to Texas.\nDynatomics, a three-year-old AI venture backed by the Google co-founder, filed paperwork to shift the company\u2019s headquarters \u2014 at least on paper \u2014 out of California. On Dec. 30, Page submitted documents to the California Secretary of State converting Dynatomics LLC to an address in Keller, Texas, a suburb of Dallas-Fort Worth, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nAt the same time,\nPage\nleased 73,400 square feet at a newly redeveloped research and development project in Palo Alto, according to CBRE. The company focuses on AI-powered manufacturing and design tools for advanced aircraft. According to the outlet, Dynatomics is expected to occupy space at The Cannery, a conversion of a former Fry\u2019s Electronics store at 340 Portage Avenue.\nWhether that signals a meaningful operational move is unclear. The Palo Alto lease suggests Dynatomics\u2019 core research and development work will remain planted in Silicon Valley. The new facility is expected to house engineers and technical staff, making a wholesale relocation from California unlikely.\nThe Texas filing instead fits a broader pattern for Page, whose recent maneuvers appear driven more by tax strategy. Ahead of a potential wealth tax headed for California\u2019s ballot in November, Page shifted multiple limited liability companies to lower-tax states, including Florida, according to the New York Times, and also snapped up high-end residential property in Miami.\nThe proposed\nCalifornia Billionaire Tax Act\nwould impose a one-time levy on billionaire wealth to fund health care, education and food assistance programs. Page, ranked No. 75 on Fortune\u2019s list of the most powerful business figures, joins a growing list of tech elites quietly adjusting their corporate domiciles in response, according to the outlet.\nThe Dynatomics deal also lands as demand for research and development space on the San Francisco Peninsula shows early signs of recovery. With new construction largely stalled, more companies moved into research and development space than exited last year for the first time since 2021, CBRE said, though vacancy still hovers near 25 percent. The Cannery has been repositioned for engineering testing and prototype manufacturing and sits near an established EV and advanced manufacturing cluster anchored by Tesla and Rivian.\nThe split strategy mirrors broader AI real estate trends. Elsewhere in Texas, a data center startup co-founded by former Google CEO\nEric Schmidt\nis betting on cheap power and wide- open land in the\nPermian Basin\n. Bolt Data &amp; Energy raised $150 million and struck a partnership with Texas Pacific Land Corporation to develop large-scale AI infrastructure, Bloomberg reported.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A storied townhouse\u2019s \u201ctortured\u201d sales process may have an end in sight.\nThe palatial Upper East Side home at 15 East 63rd Street, which once served as famed designer Oleg Cassini\u2019s studio, has found a potential buyer, according to a recent court filing.\nThe attempt to sell the home has been followed closely, not just because of Cassini\u2019s reputation for romancing stars like Marilyn Monroe and Grace Kelly and styling celebrities like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, but because of the drama-filled bankruptcy proceedings surrounding the home.\nBut the nearly three-year legal fight over the home appears to be coming to a close after two potential buyers came forward in the last few months of 2025. Chapter 11 trustee Albert Togut filed a motion asking the court to approve a sales procedure that would designate the highest bid, a $34.5 million offer from a buyer shielded by a limited liability corporation, as a stalking horse bid prior to holding an auction on Jan. 28.\nThe filing also seeks to designate a $34.1 million dollar offer from tech entrepreneur Yingkai Xu as back-up bidder, and to exempt the sale from transfer taxes.\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine there is a reason the court wouldn\u2019t approve this,\u201d Togut told\nThe Real Deal\n, pointing to the difficulties that arose during the sales process.\nThe home was originally scheduled to be sold out of foreclosure before Peggy Nestor, Cassini\u2019s sister-in-law, filed for bankruptcy one day before the sale in April 2023 and agreed to either secure new financing or sell the home.\nNestor and her sister, Marianne Nestor Cassini, who married Oleg Cassini in 1971, had accrued an array of liens on the property prior to Nestor declaring bankruptcy.\nThe largest claim on the home resulted from a 2017 loan provided by Lynx Asset Services that the sisters defaulted on less than a year later. Lynx, which filed the original foreclosure and has provided debtor-in-possession financing during the bankruptcy proceedings, has consented to the sale.\nLynx had called the sales process \u201ctortured\u201d after it took nearly nine months for Nestor to sign an agreement with a broker to market the apartment and another three months before the home was listed for\n$65 million\nby Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nThe sisters had thwarted sales efforts by barring the Sotheby\u2019s team from staging, photographing or marketing the home, according to a filing from Togut on April 10, 2024. Later that month, with help from the U.S. Marshals Service, the sisters were removed from the home which was discovered to be in \u201cdisarray,\u201d Togut wrote in another filing.\n\u201cUntil today, Sotheby\u2019s was completely frustrated and prevented from doing its work,\u201d Togut wrote.\nBut Togut said the Sotheby\u2019s team failed to bring \u201ceven one\u201d credible buyer, and last January handed the listing over to\nBrown Harris Stevens\u2019 Sami Hassoumi\n, who re-listed the 18,000-square-foot townhouse for $39.5 million.\nHassoumi has shown the home at least 60 times since then, according to an affidavit he filed as part of Togut\u2019s motion.\n\u201cI\u2019m satisfied that by working the property the way we did, we got the highest offer we could get, or anyone could get,\u201d Togut said.\nFeaturing seven bedrooms and more than eight bathrooms, the 25-foot-wide home would be part of a run of ornate Gilded Age homes that have found buyers after years of sitting on the market. Last year, the\nWoolworth Mansion\nat 4 East 80th Street sold for $38 million after asking as high as $90 million back in 2011.\n",

Developed in the early 1990s by Michael Shaoul and Michael Rosen, the building once featured an 18-foot statue of Vladimir Lenin perched atop the roof \u2014 a nod, Rosen once told The New York Times, to the neighborhood\u2019s leftist political leanings.\nThat statue came down in 2016, just before Dermot and Rockwood acquired the property for about $105 million. The new owners refaced the building\u2019s red brick facade in white and invested roughly $20 million in capital improvements, according to marketing materials from JLL, where a team led by Rob Hinckley and Jeff Julien brokered the sale.\nThe acquisition marks another step in Atlas\u2019 New York City expansion. The investment and development firm, founded in 2006 by Jeffrey Goldberger and Andrew Cohen, recently made preferred equity investments in the purchase and pre-development of 175 Third Street and 205 Montague Street in Brooklyn and is co-developing the high-profile\n80 Clarkson Street\nalong with a senior affordable housing complex at 570 Washington Street in Manhattan.\nThe Houston Street building is packed with perks aimed at the neighborhood\u2019s young professionals, from a rooftop and landscaped courtyards to an athletic club and tenant lounge. Roughly three-quarters of the apartments feature private balconies. The building is fully leased, according to StreetEasy.\nAtlas declined to comment.

        "content": "Bally\u2019s Chicago may not hit its long-promised opening date for its permanent casino after all.\nWith the company\u2019s already-extended temporary license to operate at Medinah Temple set to expire in September, state lawmakers are moving to buy Bally\u2019s more time. The Chicago Tribune\nreported\nthat state Representative Kam Buckner introduced legislation Thursday that would allow up to another 12 months of temporary operations while construction continues on Bally\u2019s $1.7 billion casino, hotel and entertainment complex in River West.\nThe bill would effectively push Bally\u2019s deadline to open its permanent facility to as late as September 2027, extending a timeline that has already slipped multiple times.\nBally\u2019s was selected by the city in 2022 to develop the long-awaited casino on the 30-acre former\nTribune Freedom Center\nprinting plant site. The project is slated to include a 500-room hotel, a 3,000-seat theater, an exhibition hall, 10 restaurants and roughly 4,000 gaming positions, making it the largest casino in Illinois.\nBut construction has been anything but smooth. The city halted demolition work at the Freedom Center site in December 2024 after debris spilled into the Chicago River. In May 2025, the Illinois Gaming Board ordered another work stoppage after contractors used an unauthorized waste hauler with alleged\norganized crime ties\n. Last year, Bally\u2019s also had to redesign the site plan and relocate the 34-story hotel tower to avoid damaging water management infrastructure along the river.\nThose setbacks have steadily eroded the project\u2019s schedule.\nBally\u2019s\nhad long targeted a September 2026 opening, aligned with the expiration of its temporary license. That date was later pushed to the fourth quarter of 2026. Even that timeline, the Illinois Gaming Board has said, would require legislative action to keep the Medinah Temple casino open in the interim.\nBuckner\u2019s bill would extend the temporary license by six months, with the option for two additional three-month extensions while construction wraps up. Buckner\u2019s 26th District includes Medinah Temple, where\nBally\u2019s\nhas been operating since September 2023, according to the publication.\nThe stakes are high for both Bally\u2019s and City Hall. The permanent casino is expected to generate far more revenue than the temporary setup, which has underperformed projections.\nBally\u2019s Chicago\nranked fifth statewide last year, posting about $125 million in adjusted gross receipts and 1.3 million visitors, according to Gaming Board data.\nThat muted performance comes as Illinois casino revenue overall is surging. The state\u2019s 17 casinos generated more than $1.9 billion in adjusted gross receipts in 2025, up 15 percent, year-over-year.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

In Santa Clara County, 76 rooms were under construction last year, representing an 86.4 percent drop from 557 hotel rooms in 2024. Alameda County had 234 rooms under construction in 2025, down 48.1 percent year over year; and an estimated 115 rooms were under construction in Contra Costa County in 2025, a 52.3 percent decline from 2024. San Mateo County stayed even with 92 hotel rooms in the pipeline.\nNapa County, on the other hand, saw an uptick in the number of hotel rooms being built from 2024 to 2025. Last year, 626 rooms were under construction \u2014 a 138.6 percent increase from the 262 rooms in Napa County in 2024. The region remains a popular tourism destination for its world-famous vineyards.\nSales of hotel properties\n, rather than construction of new buildings, have become increasingly popular, especially as a wave of\nloan defaults\nand\nforeclosures\nacross the Bay Area send hotel values plummeting. \u201cHotel developers are really being impacted by the number of existing hotels that are available for sale at prices that are well below their replacement costs,\u201d Reay said. \u201cPrices are so low for hotels that the economics don\u2019t work for new construction.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Sales are moving briskly at The Modern Austin Residences, and the developer of the newly completed downtown tower has locked in fresh financing.\nAustin-based Urbanspace Development has now sold more than half the market-rate condos at the 56-story mixed-use tower at 610 Davis Street in the\nRainey Street Historic District\n, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n. Urbanspace CEO Kevin Burns told the outlet that the strong pace helped the firm secure a recapitalization of its construction loan now that the building is complete, giving Urbanspace more breathing room as it finishes selling out the project.\nBurns said sales momentum has accelerated since Thanksgiving, a notable bright spot in an otherwise sluggish\ncondo market\nacross Austin. Urbanspace already closed on more than half the tower\u2019s market-rate units, which range from roughly 600 square feet to 6,000 square feet, with one to five bedrooms. The 319-unit building also includes 20 affordable workforce housing condos. The market-rate units range in price from the $400,000s to upwards of $5 million, and the penthouses begin at $9.2 million according to the company\u2019s website.\nThe refinancing was structured through a joint venture between Peregren Capital Group and Koch Real Estate Investments, with senior financing provided by Axos Bank, according to a release. A JLL Capital Markets team led by Senior Managing Director Doug Opalka represented Urbanspace in the deal.\nOpalka said that the refinancing shows strength and confidence in Austin\u2019s luxury residential market, pointing to the project\u2019s location and design as key drivers.\nThe Modern\u2019s performance stands out amid a\nbroader slowdown\nin condo development and sales citywide. Burns said the tower may be the last new downtown Austin condo project completed this decade, as rising costs, tighter financing and softer demand push many proposed projects to the sidelines or keep them stuck in early planning stages.\nThat caution is already showing up elsewhere in Urbanspace\u2019s orbit. Construction on Northland Living\u2019s Luminary condo tower\ndowntown\n, for which Urbanspace is handling marketing and sales, was originally slated to begin in late 2026 but has been paused until market conditions improve, according to the publication. Endeavor Real Estate Group is also taking a wait-and-see approach with a planned condo project at West Sixth Street and North Lamar Boulevard.\nMarket data underscores the chill. Austin-based Team Price Real Estate reported that December condo inventory hit a record 4,240 units, while sale prices have been trending downward.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Summit Properties was confirmed as the buyer of 5,151 mostly rent-stabilized apartments from Pinnacle Group in a Friday hearing. Pinnacle, run by Joel Wiener, placed the apartments in bankruptcy. Summit will pay $451.3 million for the portfolio.\nThe hearing marks the end of a weekslong battle, with Pinnacle and Summit on one side and the Mamdani administration and tenants on the other. The latter group tried unsuccessfully to stop, pause and delay the sale, hoping for a tenant-aligned bidder or concessions from Summit.\nBankruptcy judge David Jones considered their argument that Summit had not adequately made assurances that it could perform as the buyer and fix up the portfolio. But ultimately he decided to confirm the purchase, after Flagstar Bank agreed hours into the hearing to extend a $3 million revolving line of credit to Summit.\nThe result highlights the challenges ahead for the Mamdani administration as it tries to throw its weight between private transactions. But it also shows that landlords are living in a new New York: one where the mayor can make their portfolios into political problems, and potentially win even minor concessions.\n\u201cSummit\u2019s statements make clear its commitment to do what is needed,\u201d Judge Jones said. \u201cThe city\u2019s approach to this case gives me confidence that the city will monitor and police Sumit\u2019s performance.\u201d\nSummit purchased the mostly rent-stabilized portfolio for $451.3 million, or roughly $88,000 per unit. Flagstar Bank, the largest creditor in the bankruptcy proceedings, agreed to finance about 75 percent of the acquisition and lower the interest rate.\nThe city first raised concerns about the auction during the Adams administration, when the housing department asked for time for a \u201cpreservation-focused\u201d buyer to put together a bid.\nBut Mamdani raised the profile of the sale and made the auction a political rallying point. His administration originally asked to delay the auction, but\nthe judge rejected that effort\n. At the hearing, the city and tenants\u2019 lawyers raised questions about Summit\u2019s financial wherewithal to cure violations, history as a property owner, and limited experience running real estate in New York.\nBut Judge Jones sided with Summit, saying the company had fielded a \u201cserious and reasonable sounding plan\u201d to improve property conditions.\nSummit chair Zohar Levy said the company plans to spend $10 million in the first year fixing violations and addressing maintenance needs, with $3 million specifically on existing violations. It plans on addressing half the violations in the first two months of the sale and the other half within six months of the sale. Within five years, the company plans to spend $30 million in capital expenditures, or about $5,824 per unit.\nAlthough the city raised concerns that Summit\u2019s current New York properties have thousands of violations, Levy said at the hearing that the company is just a limited partner in those properties and would have greater oversight of the new portfolio. REM Management has been engaged to manage part of the portfolio.\nJudge Jones said Flagstar\u2019s promise of a revolving $3 million line of credit was a \u201cvaluable and helpful\u201d commitment.\nIt\u2019s a mixed result for the Mamdani camp\u2019s first big tussle with private landlords. The administration was unsuccessful in its original goal of stopping the sale and bringing on a nonprofit or tenant-focused buyer. But it was also able to slightly alter the terms of the transaction in a large multifamily portfolio purchase.\nIn a statement, Levy said he understood that the process had been difficult for tenants and that they are concerned about their homes.\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling is a new chapter, and we look forward to working with the City, our elected officials, stakeholders and residents to improve the buildings and move forward,\u201d Levy said in the statement.\u00a0\u201cWe are assembling a strong team and have the capacity, commitment and resources to succeed for everyone\u2019s benefit.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Pinnacle Group noted that the judge\u2019s decision is the end result of an eight-month public process. \u201cThe company, its independent chief restructuring officers and advisors appreciate the court\u2019s recognition that this outcome, achieved in challenging circumstances, is the best available for all constituencies, and hopes the City does too,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement.\nThe Union of Pinnacle Tenants, which represents a portion of tenants in the buildings, decried the result as a decision in favor of slumlords. But the group said that they would continue to organize for repairs from Summit and for an end to harassment. The group in part credited the Mamdani administration for its speedy intervention in the case.\n\u201cWe will fight this next fight knowing that the City and Mayor Mamdani have our backs \u2014 not just in this auction, but in the long-term,\u201d the UPT said in a statement. \u201cBecause we organized, tenants across the city heard us.\u201d\nThe city did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nDespite talk of a potential insider connection in the deal concerning Jonathan Wiener, brother of Pinnacle\u2019s Joel Wiener, Jones said he was not convinced of any insider involvement.\n",

The comedian bought the estate from Hollywood producer Brian Grazer, who paid $7.6 million for the parcel in 2012 and completed construction of the main residence three years later.

Following his death, Natalia was planning to return to Switzerland with her daughter to live there. At that point, she claimed, Gotlib took over control of Black Spruce and the family trust where Oliver had placed his membership interests for the benefit of his wife and daughter.\nNatalia said Gotlib told her that the assets in the trust were losing money, and that as a fiduciary he wanted to move them out of the trust. But she claimed that he actually wanted to move them to benefit himself.\nShe said he invited her to dinner to sign transfer agreements to ratify the move.\n\u201cShortly before Natalia left New York, Gotlib invited Natalia to dinner at his home. Casually, Gotlib produced the transfer agreements and told Natalia that she needed to sign them before she left New York with her daughter only shortly thereafter,\u201d her attorneys wrote in her complaint. \u201cSeizing on Natalia\u2019s vulnerability, Gotlib employed deception and false reassurance to trick Natalia into quickly signing the transfer agreements.\u201d\nNatalia said she had no knowledge of the transfer agreements before the dinner. But now Gotlib says that Natalia was fully aware of what she was signing, and he says that he has proof.\nIn a new filing, Gotlib\u2019s attorneys say that in discovery they obtained a \u201csecret recording\u201d Natalia made at the office of her lawyers at Kramer Levin in May 2015. The recording shows, he claims, that Natalia\u2019s attorneys explained to her that Oliver had agreed that Gotlib would take over management of the money-losing assets.\n\u201cFor this particular assignment [Gotlib] is going to have me, my firm, draw up the necessary agreements to commemorate what he and Oliver had agreed to because then we\u2019re reducing it to writing, because he needs that to administer the trust properly,\u201d the recording said. \u201cSo that\u2019s why that\u2019s happening.\u201d\nGotlib said that the recording shows that Legg\u2019s central argument \u2014 that Gotlib lied and tricked her at a dinner \u2014 is wrong. He also says that since she was aware of the agreements in 2015, the time to file a lawsuit under the statute of limitations has expired.\nGotlib filed a motion to have the case thrown out.\nOne of Natalia\u2019s attorneys, Nate Goralnik from Quinn Emanuel, disputed Gotlib\u2019s interpretation of the recording. He said that the case belongs in arbitration, and that Gotlib\u2019s motion was a ploy to try and divert the case back into court and into the public eye.\n\u201cThe whole motion reeks of an attempt to make this about what the lawyers did or what they should have done, instead of what the case is about,\u201d he said.\nBut Gotlib attorney Todd Soloway of Pryor Cashman said that Natlia put the issue in the court when she filed her lawsuit.\n\u201cThe case would\u2019ve never seen the light of day but for the misstatements made to the court about Natalia Legg\u2019s awareness of the transactions that were being effectuated,\u201d he said. \u201cThe secret recording proves that.\u201d\nBlack Spruce is one of the largest multifamily landlords in Manhattan. The company seemingly came out of nowhere in 2021 when it made headlines for buying the American Copper Buildings for $850 million.\nGotlib followed that up with a deal to buy a portfolio of apartment buildings from the family of the late Sheldon Solow for $1.75 billion in partnership with Meyer Orbach.\nGotlib and Orbach just recently sold a stake in some of the properties to Scott Rechler\u2019s RXR in a deal valuing the buildings at\n$435 million\n.\n",

        "content": "Steve Ross\nis getting in on the private\nmembership club trend\nwith plans for a development in downtown West Palm Beach.\nRelated Ross is partnering with Leisure Resorts LLC, a subsidiary of Hartford, Connecticut-based Chase Enterprises, to build a four-story club on a city-owned parking lot next to the Palm Harbor Marina, the Palm Beach Post\nreported\n.\nLeisure Resorts holds a long-term lease on the 1-acre site along the Intracoastal Waterway and operates the marina. The name of the planned club hasn\u2019t been revealed.\nThe project would rise just south of the Waterview Towers condominium at North Flagler Drive and Second Street, across from the Ben hotel, which Related Ross is under contract to buy. It also sits near city-owned waterfront property leased to Elisabetta\u2019s Ristorante and a University of Miami Health System clinic.\nThe lower two floors of the building would include retail space, with two ground-floor restaurants open to the public. The upper floors and rooftop would house a\nmembers-only club\nfeaturing amenities such as a rooftop pool, spa, fitness center and business center. There will be no hotel rooms, said Kenneth Himmel, president of Related Ross.\nPlans cap the building at 75 feet, a height limit established in a 2023 settlement that ended a decade-long lawsuit between Leisure Resorts and Waterview Towers over marina and parking lot control.\nHimmel said the club is designed to meet pent-up demand from Palm Beach and West Palm Beach residents shut out of long-established island clubs by long waitlists and steep initiation fees that can run into the hundreds of thousands \u2014 or more than $1 million at\nMar-a-Lago\n.\nRelated Ross\u2019 club is expected to have more than 500 members and aims to attract people of different ages and interests, including artists, musicians, athletes and families. Himmel described membership pricing as \u201caffordable,\u201d without providing details.The project adds to a growing private-club scene in West Palm Beach, fueled by an influx of wealthy transplants and a surge in business and residential development since the pandemic. Two other private clubs \u2014 Biba Social and the Bellini Rooftop Lounge \u2014 are also in the works downtown, adding to the options for the city\u2019s increasingly affluent population.\n\u2014 Rachel Stone",

The property is expected to trade for $9.2 million, according to listing agent David Yadegaran of Carolwood. That pencils out to roughly $1,379 per square foot.\nThe Emmy nominee, who is best known for playing Jill Taylor on ABC\u2019s \u201cHome Improvement,\u201d owned the property for almost three decades. She raised her three children there, but with the kids grown, made the decision to downsize to a Los Angeles-area condo and hang up the for-sale sign on the\nBrentwood\nestate, according to Yadegaran.\nRichardson picked up four Emmy nominations during the eight-season run of \u201cHome Improvement,\u201d playing opposite Tim Allen. She also served as an executive producer on the show later in the series, after playing an integral role in shaping episodes from the start, she told the\nLos Angeles Times\nin 2024.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019 Yadegaran and Shaun Alan-Lee of The Advisory team held the listing. David Berg and F. Ron Smith, founders of Smith &amp; Berg Property Group at Compass, brought the buyer, which was a local family, according to Yadegaran.\nSmith and Berg declined to comment on the buyer through a brokerage spokesperson.\nYadegaran said the property attracted two groups of prospective buyers. One was families looking to build a compound, which encompasses a 1-acre lot that\u2019s shielded from prying eyes with 20-foot hedges and double gates. The other group was developers eyeing the potential upside in such a sizable property.\nThe Cape Code-inspired home has vaulted ceilings in the family room, a primary suite with pool access and a two-bed, two-bath guesthouse. Outdoors there\u2019s room to roam and entertain with gardens, trails, a pool and spa, grotto bar and creek.\nLooking ahead\nIt\u2019s early into 2026, but Yadegaran sees L.A. poised for a ramp in investment and rental\ndealmaking\n.\n\u201cL.A.\u2019s heading in the right direction,\u201d Yadegaran said. \u201cWe have the [FIFA] World Cup coming into town this summer. We have the Olympics in a couple years.\u00a0 The rental market for sure will see a big lift from those events, but a lot of high-end residential is structured in a way more like commercial properties because people look at it as either the equity gain they\u2019re going to have over the course of a number of years, or the income it could generate.\u201d\nVoters are also poised to vote in a new California Insurance Commissioner this November, which Yadegaran also sees as a potential boon for homeowners and real estate broadly.\n\u201cInsurance has been a tightening factor for L.A. over the last few years on top of [Measure]\nULA\n.\u201d Yadegaran said.\n",

        "content": "The beleaguered site of San Francisco\u2019s\nOceanwide Center\ndevelopment has a new owner following a public auction to acquire the paused development plot.\nOn Thursday,\nChinese\nfinancial services firm Haitong\nplaced the winning bid\nfor the location at First and Mission Streets in the Financial District, committing $100 million to foreclose on the nearly 1.3-acre site, the San Francisco Business Times reported. Haitong originated the debt for Oceanwide Center\u2019s developer, Oceanwide Holdings, in 2020, giving the Shanghai-based lender the ability to place a credit bid on the property at auction, meaning the company doesn\u2019t actually have to pay the $100 million to take control of the site.\nWith Haitong having\nseized the Oceanwide parcel\n, the firm is now in position to sell it to the San Francisco Recovery Fund, which\nput down a nonrefundable deposit last month\nto buy the hole in the ground for an estimated $100 million. Haitong placed the only bid for the Oceanwide Center location at the auction on Thursday, though other firms are stakeholders in the property. Those include the project\u2019s general contractor \u2014 a joint venture between firms Swinerton and Webcor \u2014 as well as their subcontractors, which have liens on the property and allege they weren\u2019t paid for work done on Oceanwide Center before construction of the two-tower mixed-use development was halted in 2020 after breaking ground in 2016.\nIt\u2019s likely that Haitong reached some sort of deal with the lien claimants, who previously argued in court that their claim to the Oceanwide site supersedes Haitong\u2019s, a source told the Business Times. If Haitong moves forward with the foreclosure without the claimants\u2019 cooperation, the lien claimants could put a stop to the process entirely, the source said.\nWhether the San Francisco Recovery Fund goes with the approved two-tower project or submits new plans for the site remains to be seen. The Recovery Fund is planning to cement its acquisition of the Oceanwide Center property from Haitong early this year, another source told the Business Times.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The firm will pay $150,000 per building. That amount goes up if the landlord fails to make the payment or harasses any tenants.\n\u201cFor years, A&amp;E has operated with callous disregard for those residing in its properties,\u201d Mamdani told reporters. \u201cThis is not just a failure to serve those to whom it holds an obligation. It is overt cruelty to tens of thousands of New Yorkers.\u201d\nThe settlement stems from complaints filed by the Adams administration last year. According to court documents, the agreement between A&amp;E and the Department of Housing Preservation and Development was signed on Dec. 31, on the final day of the previous administration. A state Housing Court judge signed off on the agreement this week.\nA spokesperson for A&amp;E indicated that the firm inherited violations at its properties and has made it its \u201cmission to collaborate with the City to improve this building and others that were in deep disrepair when we took ownership.\u201d\n\u201cIn every building we\u2019ve purchased, we\u2019ve invested in replacing boilers, rehabbing elevators and fixing tens of thousands of longstanding violations,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe are pleased to have settled all legal issues with the city and have agreed upon a repair plan with the housing department that we are already delivering on.\u201d\nThe landlord has between 14 and 90 days to correct outstanding violations, depending on their severity.\nThe announcement of the settlement came around the time that a court\nconfirmed\nSummit Properties as the buyer of more than 5,000 rent-stabilized units from Pinnacle Group on Friday, after the Mamdani administration unsuccessfully tried to stop the sale.\nThe mayor said that the settlement is the largest in the history of HPD\u2019s Anti-Harassment Unit, formed in 2019. The unit, however, has won larger\njudgments\nagainst landlords.\nMeanwhile, elected officials and tenant advocates plan to rally at another A&amp;E property over a cooking gas shutdown at the property. The mayor indicated on Friday that he is \u201caware of issues across the entirety of A&amp;E\u2019s portfolio,\u201d adding that the administration will continue to monitor their conduct.\n",

        "content": "A developer is suing the city of Miami Beach, alleging city officials are illegally blocking a joint venture\u2019s plan to redevelop an Art Deco hotel into a Live Local Act mixed-use project with 249 apartments and 38 hotel rooms.\nIn a complaint filed last month in Miami-Dade County Circuit Court, the entity that owns the vacant Bancroft Hotel at 1501 Collins Avenue, and Ocean Steps, an adjacent retail complex, accused the city of Miami Beach of violating the state\u2019s\nLive Local Act\n, which allows developers to circumvent local zoning laws to build high-density projects with workforce housing units, set aside for tenants earning up to 120 percent of the area median income.\nThe law also allows developers to bypass public approvals and go through an administrative entitlement process.\nThe developer entity is managed by Todd Rosenberg, who leads Boca Raton-based\nPebb Capital\n.\nThe firm partnered with Coconut Grove-based Maxwelle Real Estate Group, led by Richard Weisfisch, and\nRussell Galbut\n, a principal of Crescent Heights and GFO Investments, two Miami-based firms developing several projects in Miami Beach.\nRosenberg\u2019s entity purchased the Bancroft Hotel and Ocean Steps from a Galbut-affiliated entity for\n$47 million\nin 2021, records show.\nA Miami Beach spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.\n\u201cLike\nmany municipalities\n, the city of Miami Beach doesn\u2019t like to be preempted,\u201d said Thomas Robertson, an attorney representing Rosenberg\u2019s entity. \u201cThey are doing everything they can to stall it, stop it and prevent it.\u201d\nThe city has approved only one out of 12\nLive Local\nproject applications since the law was enacted in 2023, Galbut said. In contrast, the city of Miami, Miami Beach\u2019s neighbor, has approved 61 Live Local projects, Galbut said.\n\u201cEverything in the city of Miami Beach languishes somewhat,\u201d Galbut said. \u201cI think Live Local allows us to deal with the serious issue of affordability. Miami Beach has lost residents because we have no housing and no affordability.\u201d\nRosenberg\u2019s entity is seeking a court order forcing the city to approve its plan and bar Miami Beach officials from imposing development rules aimed at Live Local projects.\nThe joint venture plans to redevelop the locally designated historic site on 1.2 acres into a mixed\u2011use tower with 40 percent of the 249 apartments set aside for workforce housing as required by the\nLive Local Act.\nPreviously, Pebb and its partners contemplated renovating the Bancroft and Ocean Steps into a luxury office project.\nThe city\u2019s planning staff allegedly refused to accept the joint venture\u2019s Live Local application, arguing that the Bancroft and Ocean Steps parcels function as a unified development site, requiring the developer to obtain consent from adjacent condo owners at 1500 Collins Avenue, the lawsuit states. The development entity asserts that it is not required to seek approval from the neighboring condo owners.\nLive Local requires cities to administratively approve qualifying multifamily or mixed\u2011use projects on commercial, industrial or mixed\u2011use land, and it preempts local limits on height, density, floor-to-area ratio and reviews by public zoning boards.\nThe developer-friendly law has riled up some municipalities and a number of residents across South Florida, with some critics\nciting concerns\nover the effects of these larger projects on infrastructure. In Surfside, residents and the town\u2019s mayor are opposing a proposed 11-story, 33-unit residential and hotel project submitted under Live Local. Mayor Charles Burkett called the project a \u201cdisaster.\u201d\n\u201cI think the Florida politicians that decided to destroy the fabric and composition of small towns by this developer-driven initiative is outrageous,\u201d Burkett said earlier this month.\n",

CBRE\u2019s Jimmy Slusher, Preston Fetrow, James Tyrrell, Mark Damiani and Shaya Northrup represented the seller of the 461,269-square-foot retail center; the buyer\u2019s representation was not disclosed.\nThe outdoor mall at 3801-4097 Grand Avenue in Chino is currently 95 percent leased and comprises 20 separately owned parcels. Tenants include newly opened grocery anchor\nH Mart\nand other anchors including Walmart Supercenter and Sam\u2019s Club, as well as other big-box stores like Kohl\u2019s, Five Below, Best Buy and Nordstrom Rack. The mix of \u201cspecialty and value-oriented\u201d tenants was \u201cattractive to investors, as evidenced by the competitive bidding\u201d process for the shopping center, Slusher said in a statement, per the Times.\nOther bidders included institutional investors, public and private REITs, private 1031-exchange participants and high-net-worth family offices.\n\u201cThis demand was driven by evolving consumer trends, the prevalence of all-cash investments and the increasing densification of markets such as Chino,\u201d Slusher said.\nChino Spectrum Towne Center brings in more than 14 million visitors per year, according to the Times. The property\u2019s split-lot nature allows flexibility and diversity of ownership if Brixmor opts to sell portions to other investors.\nBrixmor\u2019s purchase of Chino Spectrum Towne Center isn\u2019t its first grocery-anchored retail buy in Southern California. In 2022, the firm\nacquired the 182,000-square-foot Brea Gateway Center\nin Brea for $85.7 million.\nThe Chino Spectrum Towne Center sale is MetLife Investment Management\u2019s latest disposition involving its retail portfolio. Last September, the MetLife investment arm listed The Overlook at Oak Brook, a 54,000-square-foot property in the Chicago suburb of Oak Brook, a year after\npurchasing it for $41 million\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Jim Letchinger\nis inching closer to redeveloping one of Chicago\u2019s most infamous stalled megasites.\nCity planning officials on Thursday unanimously approved Foundry Park, the JDL Development-led proposal to build thousands of apartments and mixed-use buildings on the former Lincoln Yards property along the North Branch of the Chicago River. The vote by the Chicago Plan Commission gives Chicago-based JDL \u2014 Letchinger\u2019s firm \u2014 and Boca Raton-based Kayne Anderson Real Estate their first major city approval for the roughly $3 billion, 6 million-square-foot-plus project, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The\nplan\nwould remake 34 acres between Lincoln Park and Bucktown with more than 3,200 apartments, high-rises topping 450 feet, new retail, offices, hotels and a web of parks and riverwalk.\nFoundry Park still needs approval from the City Council\u2019s zoning committee and the full City Council, and unresolved questions about infrastructure \u2014 and who pays for it \u2014 hover over the project. According to the outlet, that issue helped sink Sterling Bay\u2019s much larger\nLincoln Yards\nvision, which collapsed under the weight of financing challenges tied to roads, bridges and other public works.\nUnder the 2019 redevelopment agreement for Lincoln Yards, Sterling Bay was supposed to front hundreds of millions of dollars for infrastructure, later reimbursed through tax-increment financing. That structure proved unworkable, and Sterling Bay ultimately lost most of the land to its lender. JDL and Kayne Anderson bought the bulk of the site last fall from Bank OZK after the lender seized it.\nCity planning commissioner Ciere Boatright said during the meeting that the city and the developers are in \u201cearly-ish\u201d talks about incentives to help address infrastructure needs, but emphasized those discussions fall outside the Plan Commission\u2019s scope. Any new redevelopment agreement would go before the city\u2019s Community Development Commission, which is scheduled to meet next month.\nSome elected officials aren\u2019t satisfied. Alderman Brian Hopkins warned that infrastructure promises made during the Lincoln Yards debate \u2014 including redesigned intersections and new river bridges \u2014 can\u2019t simply disappear.\nSupporters argued that Foundry Park\u2019s lower density reduces the burden.\nPlans\ninclude new stretches of Dominick Street and Southport Avenue, roughly 3,000 feet of riverwalk and a future bridge connection to the 606 trail. The first phase alone would cost about $800 million and include roughly 750 homes, retail and a hotel, anchored by a 39-story tower.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "More than three years later than originally envisioned, HS Development Group\u2019s long-anticipated mixed-use project aimed at giving a small Galveston Bay town an urban core is officially underway.\nConstruction kicked off this month on\nSeabrook Town Centre\n, a 19.5-acre development along\nGalveston Bay\nbetween the intersections of Repsdorph Road, Highway 146 and Lakeside Drive in Seabrook that will bring 320 apartments and roughly 28,500 square feet of retail, restaurant and office space to the small\nwaterfront city\n,\naccording\nto the Houston Business Journal. The Houston-based development firm is building the $85 million project.\nHS first announced plans for the site in mid-2022, shortly after buying the property from Santa Barbara-based Pacific Ridge. Then the capital markets turned hostile. Rapidly rising interest rates sidelined construction lending and equity, freezing progress on the project for more than two years.\nThat logjam finally broke in the second half of last year, HS COO Steve Helm told the outlet, as banks cautiously returned to the market. Dallas-based NHK Real Estate Investments joined the deal as an equity partner, while Houston-based First Horizon Bank provided construction financing.\nHS spent the delay pre-leasing commercial space and lining up tenants. Signed so far are Pomodoro\u2019s Cucina Italiana, Neighborhood Tap and Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9, with negotiations underway for additional food, fitness and service concepts, according to the publication.\nThe\nretail component\nwill be anchored by two buildings totaling about 20,000 square feet, set on either side of a landscaped courtyard with a stage and water feature. Those buildings are about 55 percent pre-leased. The broader plan also includes a 7,500-square-foot building off Highway 146, a 5,000-square-foot building along Lakeside Drive and four pad sites fronting the highway.\nThe\nresidential piece\n, dubbed The Edge at Seabrook Town Centre, will be a four-story apartment complex with two courtyards, pools, pickleball, gyms and community space. One- to three-bedroom units will range from about 700 square feet to 1,440 square feet, with monthly rents projected between $1,500 and $3,100.\nApartments are expected to go vertical in eight to nine months, with retail following later this year. HS, acting as its own general contractor, expects initial apartments and the first commercial spaces to be completed in less than two years. Full buildout is targeted for the second quarter of 2028.\nMultifamily development is rare in Seabrook and neighboring communities, a barrier that HS believes strengthens the project\u2019s positioning. City approval hinged on pairing apartments with commercial uses, creating what Helm described as a \u201cgame changer\u201d for the local market.\nThe project also benefits from the recent completion of Highway 146 improvements, which have spurred new investment along the corridor after years of construction-related disruption.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Rick Caruso is out.\nThe billionaire developer of Rosewood Miramar Beach, Palisades Village, The Grove and Americana at Brand\nconfirmed\nlate Friday he will not be running for elected office this year. The Instagram post let the air out of speculation about whether Caruso would make another bid for Los Angeles mayor or try the larger stage of California\u2019s gubernatorial campaign.\nCaruso\nsaid he weighed where he can be most impactful and considered what public office might mean for his family in making his decision.\n\u201cAfter much reflection and heartfelt conversations with my family, I have decided not to pursue elected office at this time,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is a difficult decision, and I am deeply disappointed to step back from an election I believe is so critical to California\u2019s future.\u201d\nCaruso\u2019s name\nemerged\nin political conversations in January after the Palisades and Eaton fires ripped through the Pacific Palisades, Malibu and Altadena. The developer was vocal in his critiques of city bureaucracy, while also establishing the nonprofit Steadfast LA aimed at public-private partnerships to expedite rebuilding post-fires.\nOne of the biggest victories of that work for real estate is the pending possibility of a\nMeasure United to House LA carveout\nfor Palisades residential homeowners impacted by the fire. That exemption to the so-called mansion tax was proposed by L.A. Mayor Karen Bass to the City Council in October, a request that stemmed from a meeting with Caruso, who was credited with bringing the idea to the table.\nSteadfast also worked with the city on the rebuilding of the Palisades Recreation Center. Meanwhile,\nCaruso\n\u2019s company intends to reopen the Palisades Village shopping center this year once renovations are completed. The reopening is seen as a boon to helping woo back more residents to the neighborhood.\nBased on Caruso\u2019s announcement Friday, he appears committed to continuing the Steadfast LA work.\n\u201cPublic service does not require a title. It is, and will always be, my calling,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI remain devoted to serving our communities in every way I can, just from a different seat.\u201d\nCurrent landscape\nChatter had mounted about another go at a political office, in what would have been a second bid after Caruso lost to Bass in the 2022 mayoral election.\nFriday\u2019s announcement may not be surprising to some, given this year\u2019s political calendar. Indeed, the developer last year said he was weighing his options and would make a decision about a political run at the end of the summer. The primaries for L.A. mayor is set for June 2, with the general election Nov. 3 and a crowded sea of candidates that total 23, including Bass.\nFormer \u201cThe Hills\u201d reality TV star\nSpencer Pratt\nwas the most recent to announce his bid for mayor during a rally earlier this month on the one-year anniversary of the Palisades and Eaton fires.\nOutside of Pratt, Democratic Socialist of America member\nRae Chen Huang\nis considered to be another longshot in the mayoral race. Meanwhile, there\u2019s also Los Angeles Unified School District superintendent Austin Beutner in the field, along with a host of lesser-known candidates.",

        "content": "With Indiana openly courting the Chicago Bears and Illinois lawmakers debating a key stadium request, the mayor of Arlington Heights is escalating the rhetoric.\nMayor Jim Tinaglia issued an open letter Friday urging state legislators to immediately pass a \u201ccommon-sense\u201d megaproject bill that would clear the way for a now $5 billion, stadium-anchored redevelopment at the former Arlington International Racecourse, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Without it, Tinaglia warned, Illinois risks watching the Bears bolt for northwest\nIndiana\n.\nThe legislation would allow large developments to negotiate long-term property tax agreements with local taxing bodies, giving the Bears predictability through a payment-in-lieu-of-taxes, or PILOT, structure. Tinaglia framed the\nrequest\nas reasonable for what would be the largest privately-funded development in state history \u2014 and as a necessary response to Indiana\u2019s increasingly public push to lure the NFL franchise.\nThe letter landed as Illinois officials continue to debate who should shoulder the lingering debt from Soldier Field\u2019s last renovation. Gov. JB Pritzker said Friday that the $534 million still owed on bonds tied to the publicly owned stadium is not the core obstacle to a Bears move, softening a stance he\nemphasized last fall\n.\n\u201cThat is not the core issue,\u201d Pritzker said at a South Side press conference, noting that the borrowing decision was made decades ago. The Bears\u2019 lease at Soldier Field runs through 2033, and even an early exit would leave substantial debt outstanding.\nLast year, Pritzker and other lawmakers insisted any new stadium deal must address that obligation. State Rep. Kam Buckner, whose district includes Soldier Field, has remained firm that Chicago taxpayers shouldn\u2019t be left holding the bag, according to the publication.\nWhile Illinois debates, Indiana is\nmoving\n. A Cincinnati-based law firm, Taft Stettinius &amp; Hollister, recently registered to lobby in Indianapolis on behalf of an affiliate of the Bears, according to the Indianapolis Business Journal. The filing coincided with Indiana lawmakers advancing Senate Bill 27, which would establish a Northwest Indiana Stadium Authority empowered to acquire land, finance capital improvements and lease facilities to private entities, including an NFL team.\nAuthored by state Sens. Ryan Mishler and Chris Garten, the amended bill represents Indiana\u2019s first formal legislative overture to the Bears. The team called it \u201ca significant milestone,\u201d praising Gov.

        "content": "A newly built apartment complex in West Oakland has been seized by its lender after a nearly $60 million loan default.\nAn affiliate of\nParkview Financial\nreal estate investment trust\nbought\nthe 102-unit residential property at 1919 Market Street for $37.5 million, the Mercury News reported, citing a Jan. 7 trustee\u2019s deed. At the time of the formal foreclosure, the unpaid debt on the site was up to $58.5 million.\nAs part of the foreclosure process, an affiliate of the project\u2019s developer, oWow, lost ownership of the multifamily property. Last June, Boston-based lender UC Funds\nacquired\nthe 1919 Market Street building via a deed in lieu of foreclosure, which transferred ownership of the asset to the lender instead of beginning the formal foreclosure process, the San Francisco Business Times reported last summer.\nParkview Financial provided $32 million in construction financing for the project in 2019. The loan was modified the following year. Parkview issued a notice of default last August, followed by another notice last month of the proposed foreclosure sale. The building\u2019s value in July 2024 was $40 million, according to Alameda County Tax Assessor data cited by the Business Times.\nThe apartment complex is an adaptive reuse of a former Greyhound bus terminal, per Parkview Financial. Another former Greyhound station in San Jose similarly faced foreclosure and seizure last year, with a\nlender group moving to foreclose\non the property in October for $22.2 million. Last month, the new owners\nreceived $23 million in financing\nto revive the site, which was already approved for a residential high-rise.\nOver the past year, the Bay Area multifamily market has seen several loan defaults, foreclosures and sales at steep discounts.\nLast month, an affiliate of lender Madison Realty Capital, began the final stages of the foreclosure process for the 363-unit\nFay high-rise\nin San Jose. Veritas Investments is also facing foreclosure on 66 residential buildings in San Francisco after defaulting on $652 million of debt.

        "content": "The Alexander brothers made their final appearances in federal court before their sex trafficking trial is officially underway.\nJudge Valerie Caproni waded through the arguments and requests by disgraced brokers Oren and Tal, along with brother Alon, in court last week, including arraigning Oren and Alon on a new charge. The brothers will be back in the courtroom on Tuesday, Jan. 20 for jury selection, with the opening statements of their trial scheduled to begin on Jan. 26.\nOn Monday morning, U.S. marshals led the Alexanders, clad in khaki uniforms, into a Downtown Manhattan courtroom for what was supposed to be a public hearing discussing which alleged victims would testify at the upcoming trial and under which names. However, shortly after Caproni took the bench, prosecutors requested that she seal the courtroom to protect the identities of victims. Members of the press, including\nThe Real Deal,\nNew York Times and ABC, were asked to leave.\nBefore kicking reporters and members of the public out, Caproni mentioned for the first time that prosecutors had issued a fifth superseding indictment, which brought the\ntotal number of charges\nagainst one or more of the brothers to 12. Prosecutors allege the brothers participated in a sex trafficking conspiracy between 2008 and 2021.\nThe latest addition charges Oren and Alon with sexual abuse by physical incapacitation related to an alleged attack on a cruise ship bearing a Bahamian flag in 2012. The new count is related to the same incident and victim already described in a count in the indictment accusing the twins of aggravated sexual abuse by force, threat or intoxication.\nThe Alexanders returned to the courtroom on Tuesday for their last pre-trial conference, during which one of Oren\u2019s attorneys, Zach Intrater, pushed back on the added charge, arguing that prosecutors attaching two charges to the same incident \u201cleads us to believe that the government doesn\u2019t know what actually happened.\u201d\nThe defense included their position in a motion to dismiss the count, which also argued prosecutors failed to use the exact language of the criminal statute in the indictment. Caproni denied the motion on Thursday.\nAll three brothers have repeatedly denied the allegations and have pleaded not guilty.\nAt a hearing in November, Alon\u2019s attorney, Howard Srebnick, argued that Alon\u2019s 2019 engagement to his now wife, Shani Zigron Alexander, marked his official withdrawal from the alleged conspiracy, or as Srebnick described it, the end of the \u201csingle life\u201d he\u2019d been living with his brothers.\nSrebnick further claimed that because the conspiracy charge has a five-year statute of limitations, Alon\u2019s withdrawal from it in 2019 would mean that he was charged outside of that window and should therefore be acquitted from the conspiracy count.\nHowever, in a decision filed Monday, Caproni rejected Alon\u2019s bid, arguing instead that Alon\u2019s engagement only signaled to his brothers his decision to get married, not that he would no longer participate in or help his brothers participate in the \u201csex trafficking scheme\u201d alleged by prosecutors.\n\u201cEven if it could be said that Defendant\u2019s proffered statements indicate his intent that \u2018he himself [would] be monogamous,\u2019 it is an extraordinary (and unsupported) leap to infer from his pre-marital statements that \u2018he also intended to stop assisting his brothers [with] their activities with women,\u201d Caproni wrote in the decision.\nThe brothers are also facing several civil lawsuits over drugging and sexual assault allegations, some of which have been dismissed. Kate Whiteman, one of the first two women to accuse Oren and Alon of rape, was\nfound dead\nnear Sydney, Australia late last year, the New York Times reported earlier this week. Whiteman alleged in a lawsuit that the twins raped her during a party in the Hamptons in 2012.\nHer death was reported to the New South Wales coroner\u2019s office in Australia on Oct. 31, 2025.\nA spokesperson for the Alexanders, Juda Engelmayer, said the brothers learned of Whiteman\u2019s death from media reports and added that \u201cthe decision to release this information publicly on the eve of the trial invites obvious questions.\u201d\nAfter the Times published the story on Whiteman\u2019s death, members of the Alexanders\u2019 defense team reached out to the New South Wales police. A spokesperson for the region\u2019s coroner\u2019s office later confirmed the police had finished investigating Whiteman\u2019s death and found the circumstances surrounding it to be \u201cnon-suspicious.\u201d The cause of death remains unclear.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe priciest deal to land in city records this week was a penthouse at 25 Columbus Circle, which was previously owned by billionaire developer Stephen Ross. The apartment, No. PH80, sold for\n$50.7 million\nin an off-market deal between a seller and a buyer whose identities were shielded by LLCs.\nThe full-floor unit traded for $11 million more than its last sale price in 2023, when Ross offloaded it. The 8,200-square-foot home has five bedrooms, six bathrooms and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Central Park.\nElizabeth Sample and Brenda Powers of Sotheby\u2019s International had the listing.",

        "content": "While the industry continues to hold its breath for what new Mayor Zohran Mamdani will mean for development, it will face a familiar foe on one of City Council\u2019s housing-related subcommittees.\nCity Council Speaker Julie Menin this week appointed Chris Marte to chair the Subcommittee on Landmarks, Public Sitings, Resiliency and Dispositions.\nMarte has the infamous claim to being the only Manhattan City Council member\nto vote against City of Yes\n, which has helped to spur development around the city through rezoning certain neighborhoods, easing air rights transfers and expanding residential conversion opportunities.\nWhile Marte\u2019s role as a City Council member limited his influence on major housing changes like City of Yes, his role on the subcommittee will likely give him a more direct space to exert his worldview, which, put bluntly, has been\nanti-developer\nso far.\n\u201cCity of Yes is a plan by the real estate industry, for the real estate industry,\u201d he once said of the changes that some officials estimate will add\n80,000 new housing units\nto the city in the next 15 years.\nAs committee chair, Marte will be responsible for reviewing landmark designations, as well as uses of city-owned land primed for development, like\n100 Gold Street\n, where the city is partnering with GFP Real Estate to build 3,700 apartments.\nMarte already\nagreed\nto support other planned rezonings, one of which was likely 100 Gold, in exchange for the city keeping the controversial Elizabeth Street Garden intact.\nMarte\u2019s role in reviewing historic district designations will be put to the test early as well.\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported YIMBY-aligned\nOpen New York was pushing back on two historic district designations\ngranted by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The group argued those designations, which still have to be reviewed by City Planning and approved by City Council, unfairly exempted those areas from City of Yes.\nFor their part, Open New York executive director Annemarie Gray said in a statement that she is hopeful Marte \u201cwill rise to the moment\u201d and ensure that \u201ccity-owned land can be used for affordable and mixed-income housing, that historic districts build housing like any other district, and that the historic designation process is not abused to block much-needed housing.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Marte did not respond to a request for comment.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: The world of residential real estate has been shaken up by the merger between the country\u2019s two largest brokerages, Compass and Anywhere Real Estate. New York City has always felt a degree or two removed from the world of national brokerage, but I\u2019m curious what it\u2019s like on the ground for agents in the city working at the affected firms (or the remaining ones)? Email me at\njacob.indursky@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: A recent\naudit\nby New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli looked at a sample of three Mitchell-Lama developments overseen by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. The results were\u2026not great. All three buildings operated at a loss and neglected building repairs while giving out non-mandated bonuses.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 The Mamdani-Hochul lovefest has stopped short of the subways, Gothamist\nreported\n. During her \u201cState of the State\u201d speech, Gov. Kathy Hochul said she wants to expand the state-run program that sends nurses and police officers into the subway to force homeless people into hospital care. Mayor Zohran Mamdani has said in the past that he wants to reduce police presence in the subways and wants to end homeless encampment sweeps.\n\u2014 The New York City Housing Authority is inching towards electrification, the New York Times\nreported\n. NYCHA will install induction stoves in 100 units as part of a pilot program. If successful, the agency only has 10,000 units to go. The agency said it expected the first 100 units stoves to be in place by early next year.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deals recorded Friday were\n1010 East Eighth Street\nin Ocean Parkway and\n1289 Lexington Avenue, 19B\nin Carnegie Hill, both for $8 million. The Ocean Parkway single-family home is 2,600 square feet. The Carnegie Hill condo is 3,500 square feet of new construction.\nBrown Harris Stevens\nJill Bernard has the listing for the condo.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$38.1 million\nfor 26 Bleecker Street. The Manhattan Health Center in NoHo is seven stories and 43,365 square feet. Planned Parenthood sold the building to Izaki Group Investments, per\nproperty records\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $5.8 million for 15 Renwick Street, Unit TH3. The Hudson Square condo triplex is 3,500 square feet.\nSerhant\nhas the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 104,970-square-foot, 14-story, mixed-use development at 54 Sullivan Place in Prospect Lefferts Gardens.

        "content": "The bankruptcy auction of Pinnacle\u2019s 5,141-unit, Brooklyn-Manhattan portfolio so perfectly encapsulates the madness of rent stabilization in New York \u2014 and the politics of Mayor Zohran Mamdani \u2014 that I could write a book about it.\nBut in the interest of urgency, below are some quick thoughts on Summit USA\u2019s winning bid of $451.3 million.\nLet\u2019s start with this statement by the mayor\u2019s deputy mayor for housing,\nLeila Bozorg\n: \u201cThanks to our intervention and dedicated organizing by tenants, the new owner of these buildings has committed to invest $30 million and to cure all violations within six months.\u201d\nIs that spin? Of course it\u2019s spin. Here\u2019s why:\nSummit\u2019s Zohar Levy said he\u2019d spend $30 million over five years for repairs and maintenance. That\u2019s $97 per unit, per month.\nOne owner\nof rent-stabilized buildings recently\nsaid\nhe budgets $75 per month for maintenance. Levy pledged just $22 more to fix these supposedly decrepit properties. In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman,\nwhoop-de-damn-doo\n.\nLevy says it will only cost $10 million to clear all the violations within six months and the capex backlog within one year. His maintenance budget for years two through five is $81 per unit, per month. That\u2019s a typical maintenance budget \u2014 and the \u201ccommitment\u201d that Mamdani took credit for is not even legally enforceable.\nOnly 420 units \u2014 8 percent of the portfolio \u2014 account for all of the violations. These may be the units with tenants who like to call 311, or who have been recruited by Mamdani\u2019s head of tenant protection, Cea Weaver.\nThe Mamdani administration had claimed the buildings were in horrendous shape. But 92 percent of the units have no violations.\nGiven that Weaver has spent years recruiting tenants in Pinnacle\u2019s buildings to fight the landlord, it\u2019s surprising that only 1 in 12 units has a violation. Perhaps she told Mamdani the buildings were in worse shape than they actually were.\nLevy says the only thing he needs from the Mamdani administration is help persuading tenants to let repair crews enter their units. If Mamdani agreed to this, I missed it. Perhaps the mayor doesn\u2019t want to say in public that tenants can and do refuse access.\nIf cash flow proves insufficient, Levy says, he will get bridge loans and/or equity infusions to make up the shortfall. Flagstar says it will provide a $3 million line of credit. Not really worthy of a Mamdani victory lap.\nNow, on to the bigger picture. What does the saga say about the rent stabilization system?\nSummit\u2019s $451.3 million bid works out to $87,614 per unit, which Mamdani argued was too much. He admitted that these buildings have little value, contradicting his narrative that their landlords are rolling in dough.\nThe median sale price of Brooklyn apartments last quarter was\n$840,000\n. If units discounted by 90 percent are not cheap enough for tenants, as the mayor said, the solution is probably not a larger discount. It\u2019s creating a functional housing market, where homes are not either extremely expensive or nearly worthless.\nFlagstar, the lender that took a bath on the Pinnacle portfolio\u2019s\n$564 million mortgage\n, is also the lender on Summit\u2019s purchase. Flagstar\u2019s $338.5 million loan covers 75 percent of the purchase price. The lender, formerly New York Community Bank, is ripping off the Band-Aid on its bad loans to rent-stabilized buildings.\nIn politics, after losing a battle like this, the best thing to do is declare victory and move on \u2014 and if you can, turn people\u2019s attention to something else. Which is what Mamdani did.\nOn Friday, he announced a $2.1 million (aka not very big) settlement reached by the Adams administration with the giant landlord A &amp; E. Was the timing a coincidence? There are no coincidences in politics.\n",

        "content": "A pair of Chicago wholesale heirs are holding all the cards in a dispute over a troubled Loop co-working spot.\nThe Nubani brothers, along with their partner, Torrence and Sibley, LLC, filed a lawsuit last week to foreclose on the 43,000-square-foot building at 73 West Monroe Street, alleging that flex-office provider Expansive and its founder, Bill Bennett, defaulted on a loan that has ballooned to over $6.1 million.\nBut the plaintiffs aren\u2019t your typical vulture fund. The entities are controlled by Sameer \u201cSam\u201d and Nader Nubani, scions of the Nubani Distributors Chicago wholesaling empire. Known in the sports memorabilia collectibles world as the \u201cCandy Brothers,\u201d the duo built a reputation not just on their father\u2019s snacks business, but on amassing legendary sports card troves, including rare autographed Michael Jordan items that trade for small fortunes.\nAccording to the complaint filed Jan. 7 in Cook County Circuit Court, the Nubanis acquired the property\u2019s underlying mortgage debt from\nOld National Bank\nin April. The original $7.3 million note, secured by the vintage office building, matured in October 2022 allegedly without repayment. Bennett and Expansive struck a series of forbearance agreements with the lender to withhold regular loan payments, but the last one expired at the end of 2024 and the balance was still almost fully unpaid, according to court filings.\nTorrence and Sibley is registered to an investor named Soufian Abdelkader, who has frequently partnered on Chicago real estate deals with the Nubanis, records show. Neither brother nor an attorney representing Torrence and the brothers returned requests for comment.\nAbdelkader\u2019s entity appears to invest two-thirds of the equity in the trio\u2019s transactions, while the Nubani brothers invest one-third, records show. They\u2019ve made a handful of deals over the past few years for Cook County property, using the same LLCs that are now pursuing the foreclosure in the Loop, public records show. The deals include taking out several mortgages last year for about $5 million apiece, for industrial real estate in towns such as Orland Park and Alsip.\nPerhaps most notably, records show the brothers, along with Torrence and Sibley, acquired the five-story, 29,000-square-foot office and retail property at 200 East Ohio Street for $2.9 million in July 2024, and resold it for $4.8 million in December 2024, records show.\nTheir foreclosure suit hits Bennett where it hurts most: the cradle of his co-working empire. The five-story building at 73 West Monroe is the birthplace of Expansive, whose website shows it still has dozens of locations in the U.S.\nYet this is far from Expansive\u2019s first bout with financial distress. In 2024, it surrendered the four-story, 31,000-square-foot building at\n420 West Huron Street\nin River North to lender Amos Financial via deed in lieu of foreclosure. Expansive has also faced foreclosures in\nHouston\n, Denver and elsewhere.\nBennett bought the Monroe Street building in 2012 to launch what was then Level Office, turning it into the first outpost of a chain that would eventually span the country.\nWeeks before the Loop loan\u2019s October 2022 maturity, the property was\nlisted for sale\nwith brokerage Greenstone Partners. The asking price was $7.6 million \u2014 roughly $142 per square foot \u2014 a figure that would have barely cleared the debt. But the market didn\u2019t bite, drawing no purchasers.\nNow, the \u201cCandy Brothers\u201d are playing for keeps. In a move signaling they are ready to take title, the plaintiffs shelled out nearly $907,000 to pay off delinquent property taxes for 2022 through 2024 to preserve their collateral, their lawsuit says.\nBennett is personally named as a defendant and guarantor, meaning the Nubanis could come after him for the full deficiency. It\u2019s a harsh blow for the CEO, whose firm was once a darling of the co-working craze before the office market soured.\nIt\u2019s unclear how much the Nubanis paid to snap up the distressed note. Also unknown is their endgame for the property. Are they planning a pivot to another commercial use, perhaps a showroom for their collectibles? Or planning on trying to revive it as an office building?\nTime will tell as the foreclosure lawsuit plays out in court, with online legal records showing the case will be heard next at 10:30 a.m. July 6 in courtroom 2803 in the Richard J. Daley Center.\n",

        "content": "City Market of Los Angeles in the Fashion District downtown is suing a tenant that owes rent \u2014 to the tune of about $340,000.\nCity Market L.A. is a partially developed mixed-use vision that\u2019s bounded by 9th, San Julian, San Pedro and 11th Street. It\u2019s the brainchild of\u00a0 Peter Fleming, whose family co-founded what was once a produce market on the site.\nCity Market South, which takes up a chunk of the larger development site at the corner of 11th and San Julian Street, is owned and operated by City Market of Los Angeles and is a spot for dining and entertainment. It is the first phase of a 10-acre, mixed-use master-redevelopment plan for the century-old produce mart that now falls under Mark Levy, who signed the lease agreement included in the complaint as chief executive and president of City Market of Los Angeles. Levy was president of City Market South when Fleming made the proposal and led the plan years ago.\nThe agreement in the complaint names Chris Herron as lessee, but the limited liability company named as defendant is connected to film producer Todd Makurath. It could be Makurath rented the space to Herron, but the specifics are unclear. Herron co-founded craft brewery Creature Comforts \u2014 which had a residency at City Market South \u2014 but stepped down before the complaint was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. The attorney for the plaintiff and Makurath could not be reached for comment.\nJamison\u2019s debt\nThe latest clock to to start ticking in Jamison\u2019s portfolio is a\nloan\non City Center on 6th, a K-town mall, which went to special servicing after the loan matured and Jamison didn\u2019t pay it off. The debt has a current balance of about $51 million.\nA Jamison spokesperson said the company \u201cengaged CBRE and signed a term sheet with a CMBS provider to refinance the matured loan, which is expected to close in 45 days,\u201d and that \u201ctransferring the loan to the special servicer was a strategic decision in an effort to obtain an extension to work out a refinance.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not the only case of distress that has the developer playing for time. Dr. David Lee, who founded Jamison, the company his daughter Jamie Lee now runs, is the named sponsor on four loans connected to real estate in Koreatown and downtown that landed in special servicing: 811 Wilshire, Equitable Plaza, Central Plaza and City Center on 6th. The collective current balance of the special-serviced debt is about $230 million, according to Morningstar data.\nJamison entered forbearance agreements on the loans connected to Equitable Plaza and Central Plaza but faces foreclosure on 811 Wilshire after a deal to sell fell apart, per servicer commentary via Morningstar.\nToo early to call\nJamison isn\u2019t the only investor, by any means, to see its debt go to special servicing. According to Morningstar, the commercial mortgage-backed securities loan on a mall in Lakewood, once owned by Macerich, moved to special servicing. But there\u2019s a catch \u2014 analysts suggest the transfer was more proactive than anything because the loan doesn\u2019t mature until the summer, the mall traded hands pretty recently, and its new owners want to redevelop it.\nWhen Macerich sold the Lakewood Center for $332 million, the price included the assumption by the joint-venture buyer of a $317 million loan on the real estate, the company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing dated mid-August. That loan, it said, comes due June this year. Representatives for new owners Pacific Retail Capital Partners, Lyon Living and Silverpeak did not respond to a request for comment.\nDeal downtown\nDowntown did not appear once in\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nranking\nof the priciest multifamily deals in Los Angeles County last year \u2014 but it looks as though things are already different as 2026 rolls out, thanks to a pricey per-unit apartment tower\ntrade\nin South Park.\nMetLife sold 717 West Olympic Boulevard to APW Avenue Group for about $69 million, which comes out to roughly $453,000 per apartment. On a per-unit basis, it\u2019s more than the priciest multifamily deal all last year: Waterton\u2019s purchase of a Woodland Hills apartment complex for about $180 million, or $345,000 per apartment. On another straight-up comparison of price per unit, the MetLife trade still trails Carmel Partners\u2019 $141 million Marina del Rey buy, which came out to about $578,000 per apartment, and was the priciest per unit deal all 2025.\n",

The Iranian government responded with an internet blackout that provided cover to security forces killing protesters; days later, the death toll is in the thousands.\n\u201cThe streets are literally awash in the blood of young people,\u201d said Iranian-born developer Shahab Karmely, who operates in New York and South Florida.\nKarmely\u2019s father, who was in the rug business and owned real estate in Iran, was put on a death list but managed to escape with the family in 1978. Karmely, after being deported from the U.S., was taken in as a refugee in the U.K.\nMoayedi and Karmely are two of the millions of Iranians whose families fled the country around the time of the revolution and haven\u2019t been able to return. They settled in California,\nNew York\nand Texas, and some, like Moayedi and Karmely, became successful in real estate. They may not agree on a path to peace, but they\u2019re united in seeing this moment as an opening for democratic change in Iran.\nWhile Austin-based developer Ari Rastegar has never visited his father\u2019s homeland, \u201cMy entire life has been these conversations and the trauma that ensued from it,\u201d he said. Born in Austin in 1982, Rastegar, who founded Rastegar Property Company, grew up listening to stories from his grandfather, who was the shah\u2019s doctor.\nLike Moayedi, he would like to see Iran\u2019s leader be someone chosen by the people of Iran.\nMoayedi and Rastegar, men from different generations who were born in different countries, agree the conflict shouldn\u2019t be used to fuel Islamophobia.\n\u201cIslam doesn\u2019t teach that kind of stuff,\u201d Moayedi said. \u201cThese are just goons and gangsters killing people left and right.\u201d\nIslam is a \u201cvery peaceful, beautiful religion,\u201d echoed Rastegar. \u201cThis is a dictator fuckhead thing. This is not a Muslim thing.\u201d\nAllie Beth\u2019s bid for local control\nDallas\u2019 reigning luxury brokerage Allie Beth Allman &amp; Associates is making a bid to\npreserve local control\nas Compass consolidates power throughout Texas. CEO Keith Conlon recently\nacquired an ownership stake\nin the firm in an equity investment deal with its parent company, Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based HomeServices of America.\nThe deal aims to keep the company\u2019s center of authority local as Compass gathers more teams under its banner after its\nmerger with Anywhere Real Estate\nwas finalized earlier this month. Dallas is the rare Texas market that\u2019s dominated by homegrown brands. It\u2019s the only city of the state\u2019s three top luxury markets in which the biggest sale of the year was represented by agents outside of Compass or the brands under its umbrella. Two Allie Beth Allman agents negotiated the sale of 6601 Hunters Glen Road in Dallas for $30.5 million, the state\u2019s most expensive residential sale of 2025.\nUBS deepens Y\u2019all Street bench\nY\u2019all Street logged another high-profile win when UBS announced it\u2019s establishing an\noffice hub in Uptown\n. The wealth management firm will take 26,000 square feet at 23Springs, the 26-story office building at 2323 Cedar Springs Road, whose tenant roster already includes Bank OZK, Deloitte and law firm Sidley Austin. A state filing estimates UBS will spend $5.6 million on the buildout, with construction slated to start this week and wrap up by June.\nLurin Capital\u2019s legal issues spread to Alabama\nThe city of Huntsville, Alabama is the latest municipality to sue\nJon Venetos\u2019 troubled Dallas-based firm\nover conditions at one of its properties. In a Madison County Circuit Court lawsuit filed Jan. 2, the city claims\nLurin has abandoned The Flats at Redstone\n, a 231-unit property at 2022 Golf Road. The lawsuit paints a bleak picture of the property Huntsville claims has been vacant for two years, with no utility service, missing windows and doors, a boarded-up exterior, overgrown weeds, siding hanging off of the buildings, a dilapidated metal playset and a pool full of dirty water.\n",

        "content": "November seems far off, but some agents are looking to the fourth quarter and what the election for\nCalifornia Insurance Commissioner\ncould yield.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019 David Yadegaran is one.\nThe Real Deal\ncaught up with him on Friday as his co-listing in Brentwood on actor\nPatricia Richardson\u2019s home\nwas set to close. He said he\u2019s hopeful about the year. Big sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup and 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games are part of the optimism. The other is the November election when a new insurance commissioner will be voted in.\n\u201c\nInsurance\nhas been one of the biggest challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a tightening factor for L.A. over the last few years on top of [\nMeasure] ULA\n.\u201d\nWith current Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara termed out, four fresh faces \u2013 three Democrats and one Republican \u2013 are looking to tackle one of real estate\u2019s biggest headaches.\nLandscape of hopefuls\nSo far, that candidate crop includes:\nBen Allen (D), an attorney and state senator from Santa Monica. Allen is looking to make the Department of Insurance more transparent, wean more people off the state\u2019s FAIR Plan and regulate how carriers respond following a fire or other disaster.\nSteven Bradford (D), a former state senator and 2009 mayor of Gardena. He\u2019s pushing for transparent pricing, discounts for properties that address earthquake or fire prevention and a public-private insurance partnership in high-risk communities.\nPatrick Wolff (D), originally from New York, Wolff founded an auto and home insurance business and holds a property and casualty license from the state. Wolff aims to up the accountability of insurance companies with mandates such as discounts for homeowners with reduced fire risks around their properties and the disclosure of underinsurance.\nStacy Korsgaden (R), A San Luis Obispo County licensed insurance professional since 1988 who said in a\nCalMatters guest column\nthe state\u2019s problems are the result of \u201cdecades of accumulating regulations, rigid price controls, insufficient wildfire prevention and mitigation\u201d among other \u201cunmanaged factors.\u201d\nColdwell Banker\u2019s latest play\nAs market consolidation goes, Coldwell Banker Real Estate\u2019s gotten 2026 off to a fine start.\nThe brokerage\u2019s latest franchising deal is with\nCal American Homes\nowners Jessie Rodriguez and Aaron Juarez, who have since renamed their business Coldwell Banker Icon.\nRodriguez started Cal American in Rancho Cucamonga around the time of the Great Financial Crisis, after obtaining his license at the age of 19 while in college. After working for other people, he struck off on his own.\n\u201cThen the market turned and it crashed,\u201d Rodriguez recalled.\nHe said he viewed that period of time, in which the Inland Empire was commonly cast as the poster child for the foreclosure crisis, as an opportunity to start at the bottom and grow a business from there.\n\u201cIt kind of felt like the wild, wild west,\u201d he said of the subprime mortgage meltdown that devastated commercial and residential real estate. \u201cEverything was so devastated and prices were down\u2026. It was a great time to learn.\u201d\nThen the market rebounded.\nRodriguez and Juarez brought about 25 agents and a Claremont office to Coldwell Banker, with plans to open a South Orange County outpost this month, followed by the acquisition of an existing brokerage business that will expand the company\u2019s footprint back to Rancho Cucamonga and tack on another 60 agents. Details to come on both those moves.\nWhat\u2019s next for Alon Abady?\nAlon Abady is a name those dealing in L.A.\u2019s high end know well.\nAlthough, the real estate investor\u2019s most recent play this past week was a donation in the form of gifting\n9911 West Pico Boulevard\nto West Coast Chabad. Abady bought the 16-story office with a 1,200-vehicle parking garage from Blackstone in 2023 for $35 million, or $140 per square foot. The property will now be turned into a synagogue and facilities for education, mental and social services and events.\nWhile the Waterfall Bridge Capital managing partner\u2019s biggest deal was the $96 million buy of the Sofitel Hotel in Beverly Hills in 2021, he\u2019s been a big spender when it comes to luxury homes.\nThat includes the 2020 purchase of Simon Cowell\u2019s home at 717 North Palm Drive in Beverly Hills for $25 million. Abady made a tidy profit on that when he sold the home three years later for $34 million. He also sold a $16.6 million residence in La Quinta\u2019s exclusive Madison Club community to Hailey and Justin Bieber in 2023 and, in 2024, paid $17 million for 1357 Laurel Way from conservationists Dan and Susan Gottllieb.\nResi watchers should be on the lookout for Abady\u2019s next play.\nHe told\nTRD\nafter a \u201clull\u201d the past couple years in residential, he\u2019s got a pipeline of listings, including an $85 million estate he\u2019ll list through the Beverly Hills Estates. Most of the other homes headed to market, he said, will likely be priced in the $30 million to $50 million range.\n",

        "content": "A skyscraper, an eye-sore of an abandoned tower foundation, and a waterfront lot of what-could-have-been for Oakland\u2019s professional baseball team shook alive this week, each signaling in their own way momentum for a region still figuring out its post-pandemic identity.\nLet\u2019s start with the tallest news.\nDespite surging demand and the city\u2019s strongest office leasing year since 2019, San Francisco has not seen many of its actual office buildings trade hands, even as the value of middle-of-the-pack buildings has fallen off a cliff. One private equity executive told me earlier this week that despite the leasing activity brought on by the artificial intelligence industry and return-to-office policies, no one appears ready to put a major bet on office towers. The opportunity, according to the executive, lies in securing a stake in one of the city\u2019s premiere towers, or nabbing a mediocre building off the floor and renovating it into a competitor.\nDivcoWest, the San Francisco-based developer and asset manager, appears to have chosen Door 1. According to a source close to the deal,\nDivcoWest has agreed to purchase a significant stake in 101 California,\none of the more recognizable pieces of San Francisco\u2019s skyline. The seller, according to Green Street News, is the Hong Kong Monetary Fund, which has owned part of the tower since 2012, when it teamed up with the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund, GIC Private Limited, to buy a 92 percent stake in the building.\nWrapped in glass and steel, the 600-foot-tall cylinder in the heart of the Financial District contains more than 1.2 million square feet of office space, and hosts tenants such as Chime, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Hines, the Texas developer who led on the building\u2019s construction in 1982 and retains a stake, recently put $75 million into a ground-floor renovation that upgraded the outdoor plaza and added a cafe and lounge. That project, drawn up before the pandemic, was completed in 2023.\nThe deal has not yet closed, but if it does, it will mark the largest tower trade in years. Still,\nthe roughly $900 per square\nfoot (just over $1.1 billion) asking price remains well below the nearly $1.5 billion valuation the structure received in 2015.\nThe 101 California tower is San Francisco\u2019s 10th-tallest structure. It would have been tied for 11th or if the Oceanwide Center development had ever materialized into its proposed 910- and 600-foot tall mixed-used skyscrapers. Instead the Financial District site has sat as an eyesore for years, as the developer, Oceanwide Holdings, abandoned the project after breaking ground on the property\u2019s foundation.\nYet, the property may soon enjoy new life. On Thursday, the project\u2019s lender \u2014 Chinese financial services firm Haitong \u2014\nseized control of the 1.3-acre site\nin an auction for $100 million. Now, the firm is expected to turn around and sell the property for the same price to the\nSan Francisco Recovery Fund\n, a joint venture of SKS Partners\u2019 Dan Kingsley and private equity pro Jay Yang. The fund already put down a non-refundable deposit on the building toward the end of 2025.\nKingsley and Yang have not disclosed their plans for the property, and declined to say whether they still expect new towers on the site.\nWhile plans for the Oceanwide site remain concealed, Oaklanders finally have a sense of what will happen to Howard Terminal. The waterfront property represents a still-open wound for the city, as it was the proposed location for the new Oakland Athletics ballpark before the sports franchise relocated to Las Vegas after political disputes over the stadium\u2019s plans.\nAccording to reports, sports remain in the property\u2019s future. The Port of Oakland, which oversees land use at Howard Terminal,\nhas approved a proposal for a new soccer stadium on the site to host the city\u2019s Roots and Soul franchises.\nAlthough the plans were accepted, the sides are still hammering out a formal contract agreement. Los Angeles-based developer, Industrial Realty Group, is also expected to play a role in the site\u2019s redevelopment. According to the San Francisco Business Times, the firm wants to maintain the property as a working dock, and will support traditional, commodity-based maritime operations.\n",

        "content": "Jim Letchinger\u2019s\nJDL Development\nis shifting its plan for the most expensive condos at the top of its One Chicago skyscraper: The firm is working to build out full-floor residences after initially advertising them as raw space.\nOn Tuesday, the 69th-floor penthouse at the River North tower went under contract with an undisclosed buyer at a nearly $8 million asking price, according to listing information. The next day, the developer put the 70th floor up for sale at nearly $8.3 million.\nThe units are unfinished but will be built out by JDL,\nLetchinger\u2019s\ndevelopment firm that constructed the two-tower complex at 14 West Superior Street. Letchinger told\nThe Real Deal\nthe firm first planned to sell the floors as raw space, assuming ultra-wealthy buyers would want to bring in their own contractors for custom designs. But as the units sat on the market, it became clear that downtown buyers were looking for move-in ready homes.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to deal with the contractor, they don\u2019t want to deal with building it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re all dry-walled now, and delivery is much shorter. That\u2019s the other thing, people don\u2019t want to wait.\u201d\nThe pending sale of the 69th-floor unit after more than a year on the market suggests that strategy is working. At its $8 million asking price, it would be the most expensive sale at the Gold Coast tower since early 2025, when the 72nd-floor residence sold for $8.9 million, according to property records.\nThe 76-story building was completed in 2022 and features 77 residences starting on the 44th floor, sitting atop a 735-unit apartment portion and a retail base that includes a Whole Foods and Life Time fitness center. Its construction debt was refinanced with a new loan of $415 million in 2024, with developer equity getting kicked in to cover the positions of its other investors, including\nWanxiang America Real Estate\n.\nThe lower tier of finished condos at the building has seen more success than the highest units. Around 60 units have been sold since sales began in 2022, according to property records, with an average sale price of about $3 million. Most sales ranged between $1 million and $4 million. After the 72nd-floor unit, the two highest sales brought in $6.1 million and $5.6 million in 2022.\nJDL sold that 72nd-floor unit as raw space but ended up building it out for the buyer, Letchinger said. The level of interest from prospective buyers who toured it inspired JDL to finish the rest of the units.\n\u201cNow that we have something to really walk through and show, we\u2019re seeing tremendous interest,\u201d Letchinger said. \u201cI would be shocked if we don\u2019t sell them all in the next six months.\u201d\nThe 69th- and 70th-floor buildouts are expected to be completed this summer, the listing information says.\nWhile only the 70th-floor residence is currently listed in the MLS, the 71st-floor unit is also available and being finished, Letchinger said, as well as the two-story penthouse on the 74th and 75th floors. Buyers will have multiple finish packages to choose from that will impact the total cost of the units.\nThe 67th-floor unit is still being sold as raw space because its large terrace might attract a buyer with a different vision or budget, Letchinger said. Meanwhile,\nthe 68th floor\n, which is also being finished by JDL, is being leased to tenants who already live in the building, he said.\nThe finished 73rd-floor residence went under contract with a buyer in early 2023 with a nearly\n$14 million listing price\n, but the listing was removed more than a year later and no sale was recorded in county records.\nNancy Tassone of Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty represents the developer on the listings. She didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\n",

That is less on a per-square-foot basis than the second-priciest sale in Long Beach in 2025, which went for $8 million, or $1,983 per square foot. To see the top 10 single-family sales in Long Beach last year, click\nhere\n.\nKenneth DeGiorgio was arrested in April 2025 following an assault charge stemming from an altercation on a cruise ship. The disgraced executive, whose\nLinkedIn profile\nsays he\u2019s self-employed in Miami, was on a Virgin Voyages Caribbean cruise ship with his wife when he allegedly choked another passenger on board. The case was\nterminated by June 9\n.\nThe couple put the property on the market on May 7 for $10.7 million, according to the Press-Telegram.\nThe DeGiorgios acquired the 1984-built home, which was remodeled in 2004, in 2017 for $6.9 million, property records indicate. The waterfront house has four bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms, panoramic views from all levels, climate controlled wine room with a 1,000-bottle capacity, two laundry rooms and a ground spa pool. The primary suite has a private view deck with an outdoor fireplace. The house\u00a0 has a 360-degree panoramic rooftop view deck spanning the entire rooftop and comes with a three-car garage.\nVista Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Keith Muirhead listed the property, and Desert Sotheby\u2019s International\u2019s Tamara Baron represented the buyer.\n",

        "content": "Office markets in\nHouston\nand\nDallas\nhave made strides recovering from the pandemic, but Austin tells a different story.\nAustin boomed during the pandemic, as developers built enormous built-to-suit trophy towers for tech companies fleeing California. But, the bubble burst almost immediately, with interest rates cooling the market abruptly.\nOffice space absorption in Austin matches that narrative. Absorption was positive in Austin for 2021 and 2022 and abruptly turned negative in 2023, when the city reported a 1.5 million-square-foot occupancy loss. Absorption turned positive again in 2024, but was again negative in 2025, losing 3,600 square feet, according to a fourth-quarter office market report from JLL.\nAbsorption trends in Dallas and Houston show markets steadily recovering from the blow dealt by the pandemic. In 2021, annual absorption was negative 1.5 million square feet in Dallas and over negative 4 million square feet in Houston. Recovery hasn\u2019t necessarily been linear, and the cities are stabilizing at different rates, with Dallas reporting 1.3 million square feet of positive absorption in 2025 \u2014 its first positive annual rate since 2019 \u2014 and Houston posting a negative absorption rate of 311,000 square feet last year, JLL\u2019s report shows.\nThe markets of the Texas Triangles are on very different trajectories, but they\u2019re all sporting\u00a0 elevated vacancy rates since the pandemic. Vacancies notched up slightly in Austin in 2025, ending the year at 26 percent, compared to 25.2 percent at the end of 2024. Houston\u2019s vacancy rate similarly finished 2025 at 26.3 percent, after peaking at 27 percent in 2024. Vacancies are highest in Dallas, hitting 27.2 percent at year-end 2025, a slight uptick from the year before when the vacancy rate was 27.1 percent, according to JLL.\nAI in Austin\nThe abrupt contraction of big tech\u2019s Austin office space started leveling out in 2025.\nFor example, after leaving the 35-story, 804,000-square-foot Sail Tower mostly empty for two years, despite holding a full-building lease, Google is finally\nmoving into the downtown office building\nat 601 West Second Street.\nWhile Austin logged negative absorption for the year, net absorption was positive for the fourth quarter, at 23,700 square feet. Tech companies accounted for the three largest leases of the quarter. VMware renewed its lease for nearly 135,000 square feet at River Place; an unnamed e-commerce company subleased 108,000 square feet at Domain Gateway; and Nvidia renewed its 79,000-square-foot lease at The Crossing at Lakeline.\nTech companies make up nearly a third of tenants for pre-leased projects in the pipeline, according to JLL.\nAustin has been burned by tech in the last five years, but it stands to benefit from the rise of AI in 2026, JLL said in its report.\nTrophy development\nAustin has the largest development pipeline of the three cities.\nNearly 1.7 million square feet of office space is planned or under construction in Austin, edging out Dallas\u2019 1.56 million-square-foot pipeline, and far surpassing the 760,000 square feet of office space in development in Houston, according to JLL.\nPlus, Austin landlords stand to make the most money from that upcoming space.\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, asking rent for Class A properties was $60.89 per square foot in Austin, far surpassing Dallas\u2019 rate of $42.35 per square foot, and Houston\u2019s rate of $37.36, JLL\u2019s report shows.\n",

At stake are 173 retail stores that may be shuttered, according to analysis by TRD Data.\nSaks Global, which on its website claims to own or control some 13 million square feet of leasable area, also owns Neiman Marcus, which it acquired for\n$2.7 billion in 2024\n, and outlet offshoots like Last Call.

        "content": "Former real estate teammates\nMitch Goltz\nand\nShai Wolkowicki\nhave been hit with another lawsuit while they work through their own internal court fights to wind down their old company GW Properties.\nAndrew Goodman and Ari Golson\u2019s Chicago-based firm Wolcott Partners filed a lawsuit in Cook County Circuit Court this month alleging GW Properties failed to pay off a $1 million loan. The note is backed by a Wolcott-funded mortgage taken out on a vacant retail property in west suburban La Grange, owned by the former GW duo.\nGoltz and Wolkowicki have also racked up over $700,000 in mechanic\u2019s liens against the property at 14 South La Grange Road for allegedly failing to pay various contractors as promised for their work.\nWolcott issued the debt to GW in July 2024, and when it matured a year later, the investors failed to pay it off. Now, Wolcott is asking a judge to approve a foreclosure of the property because the mortgage is in default.\nIt\u2019s far from the only debt that GW ventures took on from Wolcott. GW borrowed a $12 million mezzanine loan from Wolcott in early 2024, using seven GW-owned properties in Chicago and its suburbs as collateral, including the La Grange property, public records show.\nMost of the properties have since been sold over the last year and released from the Wolcott deal, including the\nChurch Street Plaza in Evanston that fetched over $31 million\nfrom buyer Continuum Capital, records show.\nReached by phone, Goltz said he and Wolkowicki are in the process of refinancing the La Grange property.\nWolcott\u2019s lawsuit comes as the GW pair is in the process of winding down their old firm and going separate ways. Wolkowicki is staying in the multifamily business while Goltz continues to focus on retail and mixed-use developments with his new firm, GTZ Properties.\nYet recent legal battles have ensnared the business partners as they make career transitions.\nInvestors and lenders\nare currently pursuing\nWolkowicki and Chickoo Patel\n, his business partner in the multifamily sector, for nearly $20 million total in various court cases, including $63,000 in credit card debt Patel allegedly owes to American Express.\nAs those lawsuits piled up, Wolkowicki hit back, alleging Patel was\nrunning a \u201cponzi-like scheme\u201d\nthat has bilked his ex-partners out of more than $10.8 million through fraud, theft and mismanagement.\nOver the years, Wolkowicki and his wife Lauren Lampert, have invested in more than 50 real estate projects with Patel. In addition to that trio\u2019s Chicago holdings, they also jointly owned rental properties throughout Illinois, including in Rockford, and Springfield, where Patel and Wolkowicki are facing a $16 million foreclosure lawsuit from Old National Bank for an apartment complex at 1833 Seven Pines Road.\nWhile those disputes don\u2019t involve Goltz, he\u2019s facing his own legal drama with Wolkowicki in addition to Wolcott\u2019s $1 million suit.\nWolkowicki is suing Goltz,\nalleging Goltz siphoned funds and pledged company assets\nto outside groups without consent, specifically diverting over $2 million from the sale of Church Street Plaza in Evanston. The lawsuit is pending in Cook County Circuit Court, as Goltz is trying to dismiss the complaint and force his former partner to work it out in arbitration or mediation, while Wolkowicki wants to keep the case in court.\nIt hasn\u2019t been all bad news for the pair. The duo last week sold a 128,000-square-foot industrial property at 3800 North Milwaukee Avenue for $16.4 million, moving on from the site a block away from the Portage Park People\u2019s Gas site\nGW walked away from redeveloping\nafter hitting\nmultiple snags with a $110 million proposal\n.\nThe building at 3800 North Milwaukee was also used as collateral for GW\u2019s mezzanine loan from Wolcott, public records show. Before the sale, the Milwaukee Avenue property also had another large mechanic\u2019s lien recorded against the GW ownership last month. It alleged DCS Midwest \u2014 the same contractor that\u2019s allegedly gone unpaid in La Grange \u2014\u00a0is owed $3.4 million for work it performed without yet being compensated. It\u2019s unclear if GW\u2019s subsequent sale of the property will clear up the dispute.\nMeanwhile, GTZ Properties secured necessary entitlements to rezone an Aurora property for mixed-use development. Goltz said the Aurora project is one of many properties that GTZ is making progress on redeveloping.\nLast year, his new firm also bought a four-building, 327,000-square-foot\nOak Brook office complex\nout of distress for $9 million. GTZ hasn\u2019t yet finalized plans for that property.\nSam Lounsberry contributed reporting.\n",

She started shopping the five-bedroom abode two years later, though it underwent\nmultiple price chops\nbefore landing a pending deal.\nThe full-floor home has seven bathrooms and four fireplaces. It also features a Juliet balcony and library with views of Central Park.\nBrown Harris Stevens\u2019 Mary Fitzgibbons and Martha Kramer had the listing.\nThe building has been home to a number of pricey deals, including last year, when Sarah Solomon, the widow of pharmaceutical executive Martin Solomon, sold her apartment for\n$37 million\n. Similar to Roepers\u2019 co-op, Unit No. 7, which initially asked $55 million, had multiple price chops after hitting the market in 2022.\nThe co-op was the priciest of 21 homes in Manhattan asking $4 million or more to land inked deals between Jan. 12 and Jan. 18, according to Olshan Realty\u2019s report. The total was on par with the\nprevious period\n, when 20 luxury properties in the borough found buyers.\nCo-ops nabbed the No. 1 and No. 2 spots topping Manhattan\u2019s luxury market last week, which has only happened three times since June 2021, including in May. The two pricey signed contracts come as deals for\nco-ops have been outpacing\ncondo sales in the borough, according to Miller Samuel\u2019s fourth quarter report.\nThe second most expensive home to enter contract was a co-op at\nthe Dakota\n, with an asking price of $24 million. Apartment No. 33, which hasn\u2019t traded in more than 40 years, overlooks Central Park and has three bedrooms and four bathrooms. It also features a staff room, corner living room, library and four wood-burning fireplaces.\nBrown Harris Stevens\u2019 John Burger had the listing.\nBuilt in 1884, the landmarked building at 1 West 72nd Street is among the most well-known buildings in New York City. It has a long list of storied residents, including Judy Garland, Paul Simon and Yoko Ono, who continued living at the Dakota after her husband, John Lennon, was shot and killed outside the building\u00a0 in 1980.\nOf the 21 properties to find buyers, nine were condos, seven were co-ops, one was a condop and five were townhouses.\nThe homes asked a combined $201 million, which works out to an average of $9.1 million and a median of $6.1 million. The typical home was on the market for more than a year and had a discount of 6 percent.\n",

        "content": "Developer Charles Cohen wants a New York court to give him additional time to resolve a $187 million personal debt owed to Fortress Investment Group, arguing that he has made progress toward repayment and is actively pursuing further asset sales.\nCohen said he has worked \u201ctirelessly\u201d over the past 18 months to reduce the obligation, including selling two New York\nbuildings\nto Vornado Realty Trust and using $52 million of the proceeds to pay Fortress, according to a Jan. 13 affidavit\nreported by Crain\u2019s New York\n. He contends that despite what he characterizes as excessive litigation from Fortress\u2019 attorneys, his team has delivered \u201cexceptional\u201d results under difficult conditions.\n\u201cWhat I need is more time to continue doing the right thing,\u201d he said in the affidavit.\nFortress, however, says its patience has run out. The private equity firm, which manages roughly $50 billion in assets, is asking the court to appoint a receiver to sell portions of Cohen\u2019s 12 million\u2011square\u2011foot portfolio to satisfy the debt. Fortress has also accused Cohen of improperly transferring his Connecticut estate and 220\u2011foot yacht to his wife to shield them from creditors \u2014 allegations Cohen denies.\nIn its Jan. 14 response, Fortress argued that Cohen \u201ccannot be trusted\u201d to oversee the sales process.\nCohen, who has spent nearly five decades at the family\u2011run Cohen Brothers, controls major Midtown properties including 805 Third Avenue, 3 Park Avenue and\n750 Lexington Avenue\n. He recently sold 623 Fifth Avenue and 3 East 54th Street to Vornado at distressed pricing and says Vornado chairman Steven Roth is exploring additional acquisitions or joint ventures.\nCohen claimed in the affidavit that he was in talks to sell a White Plains\noffice building\nand plans to market 622 Third Avenue, a 1 million\u2011square\u2011foot tower near Grand Central.\nOne asset Cohen insists must remain untouched is the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood, a 1.6 million\u2011square\u2011foot complex he calls essential to the stability of his entire portfolio. Selling it, he argues, would \u201cjeopardize\u201d operations and lead to the \u201ccollapse\u201d of his business.\nAppointing a receiver would trigger loan defaults across his holdings, Cohen claimed, forcing banks to demand repayment ahead of Fortress and potentially leaving the firm \u201cwiped out.\u201d\nFortress disputes this, saying receivership would not trigger default at the Pacific Design Center and that the property\u2019s high value could allow Fortress to be repaid more efficiently than through New York asset sales.\n\u2013 Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "A landmark in Santa Rosa is at the center of a housing debate as a Bay Area developer seeks to build residences on the site.\nSan Jose-based Swenson is once again\npursuing\nplans for a new swath of townhouses on a nearly 14-acre property that includes the remains of the historic Carrillo Adobe, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Swenson purchased the property approximately two decades ago and at the time looked to build new housing, but left land around the adobe to be deeded to the city so people could see it from the street.\nThe newly proposed project, dubbed Creekside Village Townhomes, would consist of 162 three-story\ntownhouses\n. Swenson\u2019s preliminary plan calls for preserving the adobe on a 4-acre park and constructing buildings around it. The company presented its designs to the city at a public meeting last month and has yet to submit a formal proposal. Doing so would begin the evaluation process, which includes studies of the land\u2019s historical resources and other environmental and traffic considerations.\nCutting down the size of the park area \u201cslightly\u201d compared to the blueprint nearly 20 years ago would help Swenson financially, Mark Pilarczyk, president of development at Swanson, said at the meeting, per the Chronicle.\nThe idea is already facing pushback, including from those with historical ties to the Carrillo Adobe. Larry Carrillo, a descendant of Maria Carrillo, the matriarch who first lived in the adobe in the 1840s, said Swenson \u201creally poked the bear.\u201d\nNative American community leaders and historians are also speaking out against the project.\n\u201cBuilding houses on top of this land would be a continued erasure of our history and presence here,\u201d Greg Sarris, chairman of the Graton Rancheria federation of Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo, told the Chronicle, saying the city should protect all 14 acres surrounding the Adobe. The property has \u201clayers of history\u201d that \u201dmakes it a compelling place, and you wouldn\u2019t want to disrupt it or obliterate it or hide it for all time,\u201d Eric Stanley, associate director and curator of history at the Museum of Sonoma County, added.\nRoughly 20 years ago, the Diocese of Santa Rosa sold the property and the adobe to Swenson for $5.1 million. When Swenson first floated building on the site, it called for 140 market-rate\ncondominiums\nand 25\nlow-income units\nand it was required to create a park for the adobe and grant it to the city. The 2008 financial crisis halted the plans, and 82-year-old Larry Carrillo has been personally removing weeds from the\nSonoma County\nsite ever since as there\u2019s currently no government funding or entity to preserve it.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Carey, whose\nspin-off\nNet Lease Office Properties listed the creative office building last year,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously\nreported\n. The company purchased the property for about $18 million decades ago and later shifted many office properties into a separate real estate investment trust. W.P Carey managing director Peter Bates signed the deed dated early January. W.P Carey and Bates did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe buyer is the Luzzatto Company, which received a $24 million loan for the deal, per records signed by firm president, Asher Luzzatto. He confirmed the deal, calling it a generational opportunity.\nThe deal for the roughly 79,000-square-foot Silicon Beach property comes out to more than $500 per square foot. The three-story property is entirely leased to Google. That lease expires in October 2030, according to a CBRE marketing memorandum.

        "content": "Jamison has landed key financing for the conversion of an office tower in downtown Los Angeles into housing.\nThe Koreatown-based firm has\nsecured\n$195 million from Prime Finance for the transformation of the former Arco building at 1055 West Seventh Street into residences, Bisnow reported,\nciting\ndata from Traded.\nThe building was constructed in 1987 and was once the home of petroleum company Arco, though it more recently served as the headquarters for healthcare provider L.A. Care. Jamison\u2019s plan to turn the building into apartments\nfirst surfaced in 2023\n.\nJamison\u2019s goal is to turn the 33-story, approximately 620,000-square-foot office tower into 686 units, making it one of the larger conversion projects in the city. Construction on the project started earlier this month.\nThe developer has undertaken a number of conversion projects in Koreatown, with three under construction now and 10 in the works, including 1055 West Seventh Street. The project at the former Arco tower would be the tallest conversion the company has ever done.\nLast summer, Jamison\nsecured a permit\nfor a project in its home neighborhood of\nKoreatown\n, seeking to convert a 20-story office building at 3550 Wilshire Boulevard into 495 apartments.\nAt the same time Jamison locked down funding for one project, the company is facing loan troubles involving other properties. Last week, Jamison\u2019s $55 million loan tied to the City Center on 6th mall in Koreatown moved to special servicing,\nThe Real Deal previously reported\n. The loan on the property at 3500 West Sixth Street originated in November 2019 and currently has a balance of $51 million.\nFour other Jamison properties, including\n811 Wilshire Boulevard\ndowntown and\nEquitable Plaza\nin Koreatown, are also in special servicing. Total debt across the four properties amounts to approximately $230 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Cary is putting real money behind JM Developers\u2019 long-awaited redevelopment of the former Maplewood School site, approving up to $12.4 million in tax increment financing to help clear the way for a dense residential project.\nThe Cary village board unanimously signed off on a development agreement last week with Chicago-based JM to remake the long-shuttered school property at 422 Krenz Avenue into a mix of apartments, townhomes and single-family houses, according to village documents and public meeting records. The Daily Herald\nreported\nthat the deal clears a key hurdle for a project estimated to cost more than $94 million and construct more than 200 rental units alongside for-sale homes.\nUnder the agreement, the developers \u2014 an umbrella group of companies consisting of\nCordogan Clark\n, JTE Real Estate Services, Eriksson Engineering Associates,\nand\nD2\nCapital Advisors \u2014 would tap the Central Cary TIF District, established in 2023, to help cover eligible costs including demolition of the old school building and storm sewer upgrades along School Street. Community Development Director Brian Simmons described the pact as effectively a binding contract, with demolition expected to begin this summer.\nThe village agreed to sell the property to the developers for $1. In return, JM Developers must secure zoning approvals within 180 days. The publication reported that representatives for the firm said the TIF assistance is needed to complete the project in a \u201ctimely manner.\u201d\nVillage officials are betting the\nsubsidy\nwill pay off. Over the estimated 23-year life of the TIF, the project is projected to generate more than $36.5 million in incremental property taxes, more than tripling the public investment, according to municipal estimates.\nThe plan has been in the works for about a year and has evolved amid neighborhood resistance, particularly to\nmultifamily housing\n. After open houses and resident feedback, the developers revised the proposal to add owner-occupied homes and expand a public park. Even so, concerns over density and building height persisted at the village meeting.\nThe current plan calls for 13 two-story single-family homes, 15 two-story townhouses, four duplex buildings totaling 16 units, 22 three-story townhomes and three apartment buildings \u2014 two rising five stories and one four stories \u2014 for a total of 236 apartment units. Units would range from studios to three-bedroom apartments, with amenities including a pool, fitness center, coworking spaces, dog park and public green space.\nResidents again raised objections at last week\u2019s meeting, warning that high-density rentals could alter the character of the surrounding single-family neighborhood. Developers countered that traffic, market and pricing studies back up the proposal.\nBeyond the site itself, the redevelopment is tied to broader infrastructure plans, including a long-discussed extension of Maplewood Road aimed at improving access to downtown Cary.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The company now occupies more than 455,000 square feet across the two newest Cityline office towers. Average\nfloor plate size\nin the building is about 47,500 square feet, per CBRE.\nLast summer, the venture capital-funded firm\nleased the entire seven-story building\nnext door at 200 West Washington Avenue, securing 305,000 square feet there. It was the company\u2019s first outpost in Sunnyvale and its third in the Bay Area.\nDatabricks\n\u2019 Cityline office expansion is the latest instance of an\nAI firm doubling down on in-person work\nas the booming AI sector takes up more office space across the Bay Area and workers move into the region in droves. AI companies currently occupy at least 6 million square feet of offices across Silicon Valley alone, according to the Business Times. Databricks\u2019 expansion at Cityline was among the largest leases of the fourth quarter.\nLast quarter, Silicon Valley recorded 2.9 million square feet of positive net absorption, meaning more space was leased than vacated, per\nCBRE data\ncited by the Business Times. Office vacancy dropped for a fifth consecutive quarter to 16.1 percent. Technology and AI were the biggest drivers of major office leasing, comprising approximately 85 percent of leases.\nOpenAI and Anthropic have been pursuing a similar strategy of office expansion in a concentrated cluster near their San Francisco headquarters. OpenAI is\nreportedly in talks to lease\nbetween 200,000 to 250,000 square feet in San Francisco\u2019s Mission Bay, which would bring its local office footprint to more than 1 million square feet.

        "content": "After years of false starts and fizzled plans, Southstar now takes the reins for potential development of San Antonio\u2019s long vacated and crumbling Lone Star Brewery site, as the developer acquired the 32-acre property near Southtown.\nThe New Braunfels-based firm confirmed the acquisition Friday, purchasing the property at 600 Lone Star Boulevard from San Antonio-based GrayStreet Partners and Houston-based Midway, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe sellers\nbought the site\nin 2020 for about $14.5 million and later pitched a sweeping $709 million mixed-use proposal dubbed the Lone Star District. That plan stalled amid rising interest rates, construction costs and cooling rent growth. Terms of Southstar\u2019s purchase were not disclosed, though the property was last assessed at $18.6 million by the Bexar Central Appraisal District.\nSouthstar CEO Thad Rutherford framed the acquisition as both a redevelopment move and a preservation effort, pointing to the site\u2019s iconic smokestack and its deep roots in San Antonio\u2019s working class history. Company leaders stressed that progress will depend on extensive public engagement and coordination with public agencies.\nThe Lone Star site sits near several major public investments already in the pipeline, including VIA Metropolitan Transit\u2019s transit-oriented development plans, the San Antonio River Authority\u2019s long-term river improvements, and ongoing development downtown and\nsouth of downtown\n. Southstar said it intends to align its plans with those initiatives, a signal that any redevelopment will likely be large, mixed-use and phased over several years.\nIn 2021, the city granted $24 million in public incentives to help fund the project, though when news came that GrayStreet was shopping the property, officials asserted that the $24 million incentive package wouldn\u2019t apply if a new developer took over, as previously reported by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nSouthstar\nis also seeking to buy nearby parcels owned by the Newell family that operated as a recycling facility and CPS Energy, including a defunct power plant across the river on Mission Road, the Express-News\nreported\n. If those deals close, Southstar could control more than 70 acres on both sides of a quiet stretch of the river.\nGrayStreet managing partner Kevin Covey said last month that his firm and\nMidway\nwould remain financial partners in the project and that Southstar would likely build off existing plans. A Southstar spokesperson confirmed to the Express-News that GrayStreet provided seller financing, effectively acting as the lender on the deal.\nThe brewery closed in 1996 and has since cycled through at least five failed redevelopment attempts, derailed by environmental issues, capital constraints and bankruptcies. According to the city\u2019s website, the facility opened in 1940 as commercial brewing operations outgrew the historic Lone Star Brewery site at 200 West Jones Avenue. That building was constructed between 1895 and 1904 and now houses the San Antonio Museum of Art.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

County\nincreased\nin both 2024 and 2025 since hitting a post-pandemic low in 2023, Commercial Observer reported, citing a fourth-quarter\nreport\nfrom Kidder Mathews. Almost 30,000 units across L.A. County traded hands in 2025, up from fewer than 20,000 units sold in 2020, which was even lower than the peak pandemic figures of 2020.\nMeasure ULA\n, the controversial transfer tax that levies between 4 and 5.5 percent on property sales higher than $5 million, was enacted in April 2023. The legislation appeared to scare away investors, as a study by the University of California, Los Angeles, last year found that multifamily sales volume fell by as much as 50 percent after Measure ULA was enacted, per CO. Kidder Mathews\u2019 new report seemingly upholds those findings, noting a large drop in unit sales between 2022 and 2023 before the rebound of the past two years. Total revenue from Measure ULA since its enactment\nsurpassed $1 billion\nearlier this month.\nThe latest sales volume numbers in L.A. County indicate that investor demand is improving despite the increased tax liability and property prices. Average multifamily unit price fell 3 percent year-over-year to $278,000, according to Kidder Mathews\u2019 report, while average rent prices were flat compared to 2024. Vacancy hit 5.6 percent and has been trending upward every year since 2021, per CO.\nMultiple nine-figure deals closed in the fourth quarter. Last month, Madison International Realty made the priciest multifamily purchase last quarter with the\n$161.2 million acquisition\nof the El Centro Apartments &amp; Bungalows in Hollywood. The second-priciest sale of the quarter was Carmel Partners\u2019 $141 million pickup of the\nStella apartments in Marina del Rey\n, followed by Kennedy Wilson spending $135 million for The Chadwick in Koreatown, and Eagle Partners dropping $107 million for the Hills at Hacienda Heights residential community.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "An industrial site in Fremont has traded hands in one of the city\u2019s larger recent infill sales in the sector.\nThe 26-acre industrial property at 41777 Boyce Road in Fremont\nsold to a Chicago-based buyer\nfor $70.1 million, the San Francisco Business Times and\nMercury News\nreported. The seller was 41777 Boyce Road LLC, an entity tied to concrete contractor Walters &amp; Wolf, according to the state\u2019s business\ndatabase\n. The buyer was CDECRE LLC, a group\naffiliated\nwith Chicago Deferred Exchange Company.\nOther details surrounding the deal, including price, were not disclosed. Newmark\u2019s Steven Golubchik, Edmund Najera, Darren Hollak and Brendan Raney represented both the buyer and the seller in the transaction.\nThe Fremont property includes three buildings totaling more than 110,000 square feet. They were built in 1969 and remodeled in 1975. The parcel is zoned for general industrial use, allowing for manufacturing, wholesale operations and other industrial uses, and is surrounded by other industrial properties.\nHow the site will be used by its new owner remains to be seen. The sale \u201cpositions the site to support next-generation advanced manufacturing, powered by exceptional infrastructure and utility access,\u201d Donovan Lazaro, Fremont\u2019s economic development director, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a rare opportunity to connect Fremont\u2019s industrial past with its technological future.\u201d\nFremont overall is an attractive industrial market for investors, with a lower vacancy rate for such properties and a higher number of industrial sites clustered together compared to other cities, according to the Business Times. Earlier this month,\nTishman Speyer bought\nan industrial building at 42701 and 42735 Christy Street in Fremont for $92.9 million.\nLast June, Prologis grew its Bay Area holdings with the purchase of a 177,000-square-foot commercial and industrial building at\n5555 Auto Mall Parkway\nfor $59 million. In October 2024, Prologis\npurchased a four-building office and research park\nat 46859, 46871, 46889 and 46897 Bayside Parkway for $71.3 million. In August 2023, the San Francisco-based firm bought a 246,000-square-foot industrial property at\n48350 Fremont Boulevard\nfor $86.6 million. The same month, Irvine-based CIP Real Estate\nbought the 352,300-square-foot Clipper Court Commerce Center\nindustrial park in Fremont for $103.5 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Brooklyn\u2019s investment sales market bent in 2025, but it didn\u2019t break.\nThe borough logged $6.6 billion in commercial property trades across 1,191 deals, according to TerraCRG\u2019s 2025 Brooklyn Market Report. That marked a 16 percent drop in dollar volume from 2024, even as the transaction count was basically flat.\n\u201cThe prevailing theme is definitely uncertainty,\u201d TerraCRG Dan Marks said during a conference call. \u201cThere are many open questions that are likely to be resolved \u2026 in 2026, and those outcomes are going to have a meaningful impact and implications for both owners who are deciding to sell and buyers regarding deploying capital.\u201d\nThe year unfolded amid a swirl of questions about\ninterest rate cuts\n,\nmayoral and City Council elections\nand the passage of a\nmajor rezoning of Atlantic Avenue\n. But momentum built toward the end of the year as the picture became clearer. The fourth quarter closed with nearly $1.8 billion in volume across 277 transactions, bolstered by three trades over $100 million, per the report.\nResidential development fared best, posting a 24 percent increase in dollar volume year-over-year, or $1.4 billion across 58 transactions. The\nlargest deal\nwas Tavros Capital and Charney Companies\u2019 purchase of\n175 Third Street\nfrom Aby Rosen\u2019s RFR Holding for $164 million.\nMixed-use posted the highest overall dollar volume at $1.8 billion across 445 transactions, despite a modest year-over-year decline. The\nbiggest deal\nwas Carlyle Group and Jay Greenberg\u2019s Z+G Property Group\u2019s purchase of the 13-story apartment building at 130 Second Street in Gowanus from a joint venture of Joyland Management, Meral Property Group and the Loketch Group.\nMulti-family told a more nuanced story. Transaction count rose, even as dollar volume slid 23 percent, signaling strong demand at lower prices. The year\u2019s\nlargest multifamily deal\ncame in Fort Greene, where Fetner Properties, MCB Real Estate and Farallon Capital Management paid $210.5 million to Rabsky Group for the 463-unit building at 240 Willoughby Street.\nOther sectors struggled to regain footing. Industrial sales plunged 67 percent by dollar volume, reflecting a lack of available inventory. Retail volume fell 20 percent, though trophy assets in Williamsburg continued to\ncommand record numbers\nfrom institutional buyers.\nMarket headwinds are unlikely to dissipate overnight, as political shifts continue to shape dealmaking.\nMarks said, \u201c2026 is going to be defined a lot by how the new administration is behaving and what they\u2019re able to get passed.\u201d\n",

        "content": "When Annie Coulter took office as mayor of Ford Heights in 2017, she stumbled onto a quiet real estate scandal that, years later, is casting new light on how Cook County allows municipalities to seize and dispose of tax-delinquent property.\nCoulter learned that her predecessor, Charles Griffin, arranged to give away 17 village-owned houses \u2014 properties Ford Heights had acquired through the county\u2019s revitalization program, which lets municipalities take control of tax-delinquent homes. According to court records and an\ninvestigation\nby the Investigative Project on Race and Equity in partnership with Injustice Watch, at least four of the houses went to Griffin\u2019s friends or relatives, while others were transferred to political allies and village insiders. At the time, the homes were collectively worth about $410,000, based on\nCook County assessor\ndata.\nGriffin later oversaw the transfer of four more houses during a second term as mayor, investigators found. Yet nothing in county rules explicitly barred him from doing so. Cook County lacks clear regulations preventing local officials from handing seized properties to friends, family or political supporters \u2014 and oversight is minimal, the investigation found.\nThe revitalization program was designed to return vacant and blighted homes to productive use. Instead, the investigation showed with the Ford Heights example how easily a municipality can be bent into a political giveaway machine. Some of the transferred homes quickly fell back into disrepair or tax delinquency. One ranch-style house given away in 2017 now sits boarded up and overgrown, with unpaid property taxes piling up.\nCounty officials had\nwarning signs\n. Ford Heights failed to submit required annual reports on the seized properties, a basic condition of the program. Even so, the village was allowed to complete foreclosures, clear tax debt and continue using the program in later years. From 2019 to 2023, Ford Heights sought to use the revitalization tool on more than 300 properties, though none were ultimately seized, the investigation found.\nGriffin\u2019s actions came to light not through county enforcement, but because Coulter reported them to law enforcement, according to the investigation. Prosecutors later indicted Griffin on theft and official misconduct charges tied to embezzling village funds \u2014 not the free house transfers. Griffin was convicted in 2024 and sentenced to four years in prison, though he has appealed and maintains the transfers were lawful.\nThe Ford Heights case is part of a broader pattern. Since 2016, municipalities have seized more than 600 properties through the revitalization program, mostly in predominantly Black south suburban communities, according to the investigation. In many cases, Cook County allowed governments to keep the full value of seized homes, including any homeowner equity beyond\nunpaid taxes\n.\nThat practice is now under legal pressure. In 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that governments can\u2019t take more than they\u2019re owed when collecting delinquent taxes. A federal judge later found Cook County\u2019s similar system unconstitutional in cases involving private investors. The county temporarily suspended the revitalization program, though municipalities can still seize properties through the\nCook County Land Bank Authority\n\u2014 another channel with limited guardrails.\nHousing advocates and policy experts say the real estate implications are stark: Weak rules distort local housing markets, erode trust and sometimes worsen blight rather than curing it. They\u2019re calling for clearer prohibitions, public disposition requirements and independent oversight to ensure seized homes are sold transparently or reused for genuine public benefit.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Invitation Homes is pushing further into ground-up construction, shelling out $89 million to buy Atlanta-based homebuilder and developer ResiBuilt. It\u2019s a move that deepens the wager of one of the largest owners of single-family rental homes in the country on build-to-rent housing.\nThe Dallas-based firm said Friday that it closed on the acquisition two days earlier, according to a press release. The deal includes up to $7.5 million in potential incentive-based payments, along with 23 active building contracts and a broader pipeline of potential projects not yet under contract, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. ResiBuilt\u2019s parent, Resicap, will remain independent.\nFounded in 2018, ResiBuilt has developed more than 4,200 homes across the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida, operating in the\nfast-growing Sun Belt markets\nthat have become core territory for institutional rental firms. While no land was transferred as part of the deal, Invitation Homes secured the option to purchase 1,500 lots.\nInvitation Homes\u2019\nacquisition of ResiBuilt is less about adding units overnight and more about tightening control over its development pipeline. CEO and President Dallas Tanner framed the deal as a strategic expansion of the company\u2019s core mission, calling it a step toward addressing housing affordability by adding supply in high-demand markets.\nThe move fits neatly with Invitation Homes\u2019 evolution from a\npost-foreclosure buying machine\ninto a more vertically integrated housing firm. Founded in 2012, the firm now owns and operates more than 110,000 single-family rental homes across 16 markets, making it one of the largest institutional landlords in the country. The company reported $2.6 billion in revenue in 2024 and carries a market capitalization north of $16.8 billion, according to the outlet.\nBuild-to-rent has become a central growth lever for large landlords, as resale inventory tightens and competition for existing homes intensifies. According to the release, by bringing ResiBuilt in-house, Invitation Homes gains a team with regional development experience.\nThe deal also comes as Invitation Homes continues to transform its office environment. According to the outlet, the firm relocated its headquarters last year to the Two Lincoln Center building at 5420 LBJ Freeway in North Dallas, leaving downtown\u2019s\nComerica Bank Tower\nin a move aimed at accommodating headcount growth and a hybrid work model.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A former Miss Canada sued\nGrant Cardone\nalleging defamation in a case that ballooned from an eviction tiff to a claim of $500 million in damages.\nChealse Sophia Howell accused the crowd-funding multifamily syndicator and his Aventura-based firm Cardone Capital of engaging in a nasty online smear campaign against her, in a complaint filed in Miami-Dade Circuit Court last month.\nCardone allegedly told his 10 million-plus social media followers that Howell was involved \u201cin a clandestine or illegal operation in the Middle East.\u201d Cardone allegedly implied her talent agency is \u201cessentially masquerading as a dating site for Americans and Canadians being peddled to the Middle East,\u201d the complaint states.\nHowell, from Lindsay, Ontario, owns a talent agency and a skincare company. She is seeking $500 million in damages, the complaint states.\nThe former beauty pageant contestant is locked in a bitter eviction lawsuit with\nCardone\nand his wife, Elena.\nTheir landlord entity sued Howell after she rented a Sunny Isles Beach Condo from them in 2023. Howell wants the Cardones to return $150,000 in security deposits in that case. Howell\u2019s lawyer Douglas Jeffrey did not respond to requests for comment.\nCardone accused Howell of \u201cintentionally and maliciously\u201d causing millions of dollars in property damage.\n\u201cThose who are as visible as I am become targets of those looking for quick scores,\u201d Cardone told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nCardone has over 10 million followers across his social media platforms, where he gives real estate and financial advice and flaunts his luxurious lifestyle.\nCardone Capital has more than\n$5 billion\nin real estate assets across the country, primarily multifamily projects. The firm recently began investing in bitcoin.\nCardone Capital\nsells small percentages in its real estate and cryptocurrency holdings to small investors via crowdfunding.\nEviction over fire sprinklers\nHowell entered into a one-year lease for the Cardones\u2019 33th floor unit at the Regalia Residences at 19575 Collins Avenue in November 2023 at $50,000 a month, court filings show.\nShe was required to pay up front a $50,000 landlord security deposit, $100,000 for two months rent and a $5,000 security deposit to the building\u2019s condo association.\nThe landlord-tenant relationship crumbled a month later when Howell moved in.\nThe Cardones accuse Howell of damaging sprinkler heads in the unit with a \u201cheavy object\u201d that caused water to pour into the condo down to the lobby, according to their eviction suit. The flooding damaged the Cardones\u2019 unit and 30 others below it, their complaint alleges.\nThe same day, the condo association allegedly banned Howell from the building, and the Cardones served her with an eviction notice requiring her to leave by Jan. 3, 2024.\nIn a counterclaim, Howell denied damaging the sprinkler system, as well as accusations that she destroyed security cameras in common areas. Howell claimed she was asleep when \u201cshe was awakened by a loud sound,\u201d her response states. She walked into the kitchen when she saw water pouring from the ceiling and allegedly had no idea what caused the sprinklers to malfunction.\nElena Cardone, a security guard, a building representative and police showed up to the unit immediately after the sprinkler incident. Elena Cardone allegedly informed everyone present that Howell \u201cwas no longer allowed on the premises\u201d and that she had \u201c30 minutes to gather her belongings\u201d and leave, according to Howell\u2019s lawsuit.\n\u201cWeird vibe\u201d\n\u200bIn the defamation lawsuit, Howell alleged that an \u201ceerie, weird vibe surrounded\u201d the Regalia Residences condo unit, and that \u201cstrange, cultlike individuals surrounded\u201d the Cardones.\nA text thread between Howell and Elena Cardone allegedly shows how their relationship unraveled. In a text sent on Jan. 26, 2024, and included in Howell\u2019s complaint, Elena Cardone allegedly said, \u201cMy husband\u2019s gonna make you famous.\u201d\nThe same day,\nCardone\nallegedly posted two photos on his Facebook page of\nHowell\nwearing a black ski mask, a bikini top and black sweatpants.\nIn the post, which is still up, Cardone allegedly wrote that he was looking for Howell\u2019s phone number and her current location, as well as any information about her and any of her boyfriends.\nHe allegedly wrote that she owns a company \u201cpossibly [a] dating site or model agency, owned by a middle eastern or Egyptian dude.\u201d Cardone allegedly offered \u201crewards for any details that lead to her whereabouts.\u201d\nCardone falsely attempted to align Howell with someone she doesn\u2019t know and doesn\u2019t have any affiliation with, according to the complaint, which says she doesn\u2019t own a dating agency or website. Cardone allegedly knew the ski mask images were old marketing photographs, but he still posted them \u201cto deceive his many social media followers,\u201d the lawsuit states.\nCardone\nallegedly posted similarly \u201cdefamatory statements\u201d on LinkedIn, X and Instagram to make it appear that Howell was engaged in \u201csex crimes, including but not limited to engaging in prostitution,\u201d the lawsuit states.\nHowell suffered ridicule and loss of business partnerships from the posts, her lawsuit alleges. Besides that, Cardone\u2019s fans have harassed her by posting photos of her residence and some of her personal information, she alleges.\nCardone said Howell\u2019s defamation lawsuit is just a deflection from the eviction case.\nHer \u201cunexplainable behavior and destruction of property is indefensible,\u201d he said.",

In the last quarter of 2022 alone, nearly 40 million square feet of industrial space was under construction in the Chicago area, a year-end report from Savills found.\nNow, the sector is showing signs of stabilizing from pandemic-era highs. During the last quarter of 2025, about 13 million square feet of industrial properties was under construction in the Chicago area. Much of that activity was driven by\na boost in data center development\n, according to Savills.\nThe slowdown has helped new projects find buyers as they hit the market.\nThe highest industrial dollar sale in Cook County in 2025 was\nNorthPoint Development\u2019s purchase of a $270 million industrial portfolio\nin the Northwest suburbs to NorthPoint Development,\na TRD data analysis found.\nBuyer demand for Thor Equities\u2019 building at 1211 Tower Road may be linked to its proximity to both O\u2019Hare International Airport and downtown Chicago. The building is 30 miles northwest of downtown and 15 miles northwest of O\u2019Hare.\nProximity to O\u2019Hare has proven to be an advantage for both industrial players and office landlords. Even as the pandemic cratered demand for office, properties near the airport fared better than those in the farther flung suburbs, market data shows.",

        "content": "After months of heated debate, a controversial data center proposal is heading for a vote before the Naperville City Council Tuesday night, setting up a high-stakes test of how far the Chicago suburb is willing to go to accommodate energy-hungry infrastructure near residential neighborhoods.\nThe developer \u2014 Naples, Florida-based Karis Critical \u2014 pared back its original plan, which once called for two data centers near Naperville and Warrenville roads. The Daily Herald\nreported\nthat the current request seeks approval for a single facility, a move the company said reflects an effort to \u201cright-size\u201d the project for the city, according to statements made to council members and city documents. For nearby residents, the changes haven\u2019t gone far enough.\nThe council will consider a draft development agreement that lays out strict conditions governing construction, operations and ongoing oversight. Under the proposal, the data center would be required to buy all of its electricity from the city, with peak demand capped at 36 megawatts.\nKaris\nwould also be on the hook for any infrastructure upgrades and would guarantee that the added load doesn\u2019t drive up electric costs for other Naperville customers.\nCity staff said enough electrical capacity exists to support the project while accommodating reasonable growth through 2030, based on analysis conducted with consultants and ComEd, the primarily electrical supplier for Chicago and Northern Illinois. Still, a staff report cautions that absorbing another large-load customer in the\nI-88 corridor\ncould require significant system upgrades, effectively limiting future options unless more power is secured.\nThat concern is fueling\nresident opposition\n, along with fears about noise and air quality. At a recent meeting, neighbors pointed to diesel backup generators \u2014 up to 24 of them \u2014 as a particular flashpoint. The agreement would limit testing to weekdays, cap it at 10 hours annually and restrict non-emergency use during poor air quality days. Only two generators could be tested at once. Critics argue those safeguards don\u2019t address the long-term reality of 24/7 industrial operations near homes, some just hundreds of feet away.\nNoise from cooling systems is another worry, prompting calls for the city to modernize its noise ordinance and set clearer buffers between data centers and residential areas. Opponents said other municipalities have already tightened zoning rules after learning about the impacts of allowing data centers near neighborhoods.\nThe fight also taps into broader questions about land use along Naperville\u2019s I-88/Diehl Road corridor. A city-commissioned study urged officials to pursue higher-value, mixed-use and life sciences development that supports a more vibrant \u201clive-work-play\u201d environment. Residents and some council members are questioning whether a massive, power-intensive facility forecloses those possibilities.\nKaris, which pledged at least $250 million in investment excluding tenant equipment, argued the site\u2019s proximity to the Indian Hill substation makes it uniquely suited for a data center and positions Naperville for long-term tax revenue and tech-sector jobs.\nNaperville isn\u2019t the only Chicago suburb where Karis is eyeing data center development. Anthony Iatarola\u2019s firm, 5a7, and its affiliates sold more than 180 undeveloped acres in\nHoffman Estates\nfor $45 million to a Karis venture in February, which is prepping the land for a data center operator.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The seller was 41777 Boyce Road LLC, an entity tied to concrete contractor Walters &amp; Wolf, according to the state\u2019s business\ndatabase\n. The buyer was CDECRE LLC, a group\naffiliated\nwith Chicago Deferred Exchange Company.\nThe buyer entity may not be the true owner, however, as it appears to be a company that helps investors complete 1031-exchanges to defer tax costs.\nOther details surrounding the deal were not disclosed. Newmark\u2019s Steven Golubchik, Edmund Najera, Darren Hollak and Brendan Raney represented both the buyer and the seller in the transaction.\nThe Fremont property includes three buildings totaling more than 110,000 square feet. They were built in 1969 and remodeled in 1975. The parcel is zoned for general industrial use, allowing for manufacturing, wholesale operations and other industrial uses, and is surrounded by other industrial properties.\nHow the site will be used by its new owner remains to be seen. The sale \u201cpositions the site to support next-generation advanced manufacturing, powered by exceptional infrastructure and utility access,\u201d Donovan Lazaro, Fremont\u2019s economic development director, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a rare opportunity to connect Fremont\u2019s industrial past with its technological future.\u201d\nFremont overall is an attractive industrial market for investors, with a lower vacancy rate for such properties and a higher number of industrial sites clustered together compared to other cities, according to the Business Times.

In October 2024, Prologis\npurchased a four-building office and research park\nat 46859, 46871, 46889 and 46897 Bayside Parkway for $71.3 million.

One vendor told WWD it is allegedly owed $250 million in unpaid invoices,\naccording\nto the Houston Business Journal.\nThe company\u2019s website currently advertises a \u201cwarehouse sale,\u201d with all clearance items priced at $15 or less, but makes no explicit mention of liquidation or store closures. Still, the signs point to trouble for a chain that operates more than 450 boutiques across 45 states and employs more than 3,400 people, according to its website. In the Houston area alone, Francesca\u2019s has 16 stores, many embedded in malls and\nopen-air shopping centers\n.\nFounded in Houston in 1999, Francesca\u2019s carved out a niche with small-format boutiques, fast-turn merchandise and a curated feel that appealed to\nsuburban mall shoppers\n. But like many\nspecialty apparel retailers\n, the company struggled as foot traffic softened and e-commerce intensified, according to the outlet. In the years leading up to the pandemic, Francesca\u2019s closed stores, cut jobs and tweaked its merchandising in an attempt to\nstabilize performance\n, ultimately concluding a strategic review in 2019 with a renewed focus on a turnaround plan.\nThe pandemic upended those efforts. The retailer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 2020, emerging two months later after being sold for $18 million to Francesca\u2019s Acquisition, an affiliate of TerraMar Capital, along with Tiger Capital Group and SB360 Capital Group. New ownership attempted to reposition the brand, including launching Franki by Francesca\u2019s, a tween-focused concept, and acquiring wardrobe basics brand Richer Poorer in 2023 to build a multibrand platform, according to the publication.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

However, that is not what this column is about.\nIt\u2019s about how revitalization stories always include fears of people being \u201cpriced out.\u201d\nI\u2019ll let you in on a secret: Good journalists have tension in every story. Otherwise, the result is a puff piece that doesn\u2019t show a true picture, because nothing is without tension.\nBut reporting fears of displacement has become a trite way to add tension to development stories. And giving ink to unfounded fears can give them credibility they don\u2019t deserve.\nRemember the fears that cell towers would cause cancer? Totally baseless. But some towns denied their residents cell service for years as a result. Publicizing fears that vaccines are dangerous has reduced vaccination rates, which actually\nis\ndangerous.\nA more realistic tension point for redevelopment stories is the risk that projects will lose money. The Atlantic Yards project generated a ton of coverage about how it would \u201cdestroy\u201d Brooklyn, which it did not, but very little about the chance that its\ndebt would go bad\n, which it did.\nMainstream publications don\u2019t understand project finance so they default to covering protest signs and pitchforks \u2014 and if there aren\u2019t any, they hunt for unhappy people.\nCue the \u201cstruggling Kenoshans.\u201d I\u2019m sure some fear change, but if they are struggling, the status quo is not working for them.\nNew investment\nmight.\n\u201cDowntown Kenosha was nearly dead 20 yrs ago, now there\u2019s everything you could want, except a grocery store,\u201d one resident\ncommented\non Reddit.\nThe New York Times just ran a story about\nJersey City\u2019s revitalization\n. For tension, it quoted a retired basketball coach saying the infrastructure was not keeping up with development and a random, 30-year-old lifelong resident saying her high school classmates \u201chad scattered across the state and country after graduation, driven away by the cost of living.\u201d\nThe basketball coach is not an expert on infrastructure, and the 30-year-old offered no evidence that her classmates left because of high costs. More likely they left because before the\ndevelopment boom\nturned things around, they saw no future in Jersey City.\nLow-income people move a lot. This goes unnoticed unless there\u2019s gentrification going on, in which case their moves are deemed \u201cdisplacement.\u201d In fact, research has shown that poor people are\nless likely to leave\ntheir neighborhood if it is improving.\nThe Times mentioned neither of these things. Instead, it wrote:\n\u201cThe decline in available affordable housing has notably affected Black residents, who on average have less wealth than white families. Between 2013 and 2023, the city\u2019s Black population fell by about 3,000, while its white population grew by about 15,000.\u201d\nWhat decline in affordable housing? The story said the median rent has risen, but that\u2019s because\nnew projects\nadded so many units\nabove the old median\n. The number of\naffordable units\nis actually\nincreasing\n, and older buildings are rent-controlled.\nJersey City\u2019s development boom does not explain why Black people moved. They have also moved from places where development did not boom.\nIndeed, northern cities have experienced a broad decline in Black residents. Some decamped to the suburbs, and as racism in the South receded and opportunity grew for people of color, many\nmoved there\n\u2014 a\nreversal of the Great Migration\n.\nAt least the Times included rebuttals of its conjecture, noting that Mayor Steve Fulop \u201csaid Jersey City remains one of America\u2019s most ethnically diverse cities, and that the drop in Black residents mirrors a dynamic that is playing out across the\nNew York City region\n.\u201d\n\u201cJersey City residents spend less of their income on housing than the state average,\u201d the story added. \u201cHousing experts say that the building boom, whatever its flaws, has made Jersey City much cheaper than it otherwise would be.\u201d\n",

        "content": "An affordable housing nonprofit has put the kibosh on selling some Santa Monica buildings to developer\nLeo Pustilnikov\n.\nAt a Santa Monica City Council meeting last week, officials\ndisclosed\nthat they had privately discussed a potential sale of 419 and 1616 Ocean Avenue, properties controlled by\nCommunity Corporation of Santa Monica\n, the Santa Monica Daily Press reported. Any transaction would require city approval because Santa Monica deeded 419 and 1616 Ocean to the nonprofit in 2016 and retained reacquisition rights.\nAfter the private discussions, Mayor Caroline Torosis said the City had been asked by both CCSM and Pustilnikov to evaluate a potential deal between the parties.\n\u201cThe city discussed the potential real estate transaction in closed session, given that Mr. Pustilnikov is considering other\ninterim [and] transitional housing uses at 413 Ocean\n, including a possible project with the Office of Diversion and Reentry for what has been described to the city as \u2018prisoner housing,\u2019\u201d Torosis said. \u201c[Community Corporation of Santa Monica] has shared that they need the funds that they would accrue from selling 419 Ocean Avenue to help stabilize their operations. Also, Mr. Pustilnikov has indicated that if the city signed off on the transaction, he would forgo any proposed interim [and] transitional housing use at 413 Ocean Avenue.\u201d\n\u201cWe are aware that [Community Corporation of Santa Monica] is also considering selling other properties they own to Mr. Pustilnikov. We have been made aware that [Community Corporation of Santa Monica] and Mr. Pustilnikov are still negotiating potential deal terms for a possible transaction [for 419 and 1616 Ocean],\u201d Torosis said after the meeting.\nShortly thereafter, Community Corporation of Santa Monica pushed back on the mayor\u2019s statement and confirmed that it was no longer in talks with Pustilnikov.\n\u201cCommunity Corporation of Santa Monica is not in negotiations with Leo Pustilnikov to purchase any of our properties,\u201d Tara Barauskas, executive director of Community Corporation of Santa Monica, said. \u201cOn Monday, Jan. 12, the Community Corporation board voted not to engage in any discussions or negotiations with Leo Pustilnikov. Remarks from any other parties suggesting otherwise are inaccurate.\u201d\nThe\naffordable housing\nnonprofit opted not to move forward with any deals and said it does not need to sell properties to maintain operations. It also noted that it was not interested in selling any of its other properties to Pustilnikov and that the organization did not ask the City Council to discuss the situation.\nPustilnikov, for his part, said he spent months talking with Community Corporation of Santa Monica about the potential purchase of 419 Ocean Avenue. The developer said he began discussions when he acquired the rights to the neighboring property at 413 Ocean Avenue, one of two Ocean Avenue sites owned by Pustilnikov that has\ndrawn ire from local residents over supportive housing plans\n, for which 413 Ocean Avenue is zoned.\nPustilnikov said he has not limited potential development to so-called \u201cprisoner housing.\u201d\n\u201cI need to generate a use to hopefully come close to breaking even,\u201d Pustilnikov said. \u201cThere are a number of uses that are permitted due to the unique nature of the property and within what is allowed\u2026 I\u2019ve given the city five uses and tell me what\u2019s least offensive.\u201d\nThe developer is asking the city for its preference but confirmed he would absorb the cost of keeping the buildings vacant if he could purchase more adjacent property. \u201cI\u2019ve said if I can acquire the adjacent site, I don\u2019t mind leaving it vacant for the rest of the term [of any potential deal],\u201d he said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The development would also have 99,000 square feet of commercial space and over 1,000 parking spots.\nRSP Architects designed the project.\nInvoking Live Local allows the developer to build to the maximum height and density allowed in exchange for reserving 40 percent of units for residents\nearning\n$104,000 to $150,000 a year.\nUnits in the workforce tower would span 425 to 900 square feet and include a mix of rentals and for-sale units.

It refinanced the 588-unit apartment tower for $238 million last year.\nThe second phase of Forma received approval recently as a\nLive Local project with 278 apartments\n, 101,000 square feet of offices and some retail on a 2-acre site at 220 Northeast 43rd Street.

The financing adds to a pipeline of planned condo projects that Bank OZK is the lender of in South Florida.\nLotus Capital Partners, led by Faisal Ashraf, arranged the loan, according to a news release. It closed just two months after the same developer nabbed a\n$138.5 million construction loan\nfor its Ziggurat condo project nearby in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove from BDT &amp; MSD Partners and BHI.\nCoral Gables-based Allen Morris, led by president W.A.

Construction began in December, and the building is expected to be completed in early 2028, according to the release. The project also includes an $11 million renovation of the city-owned Ponce Circle Park.\nThe building, designed by John Cunningham with interiors by Meyer Davis, will include 25,000 square feet of retail space with a restaurant, a rooftop pool and bar, a cafe, spa and fitness center.\nPrevious versions of the project were shot down by city boards, but the Coral Gables Commission unanimously\napproved\nordinances changing the land use to high-rise intensity from low-rise intensity, vacating the alleyway between the properties and changing a zoning district boundary, in 2024.\nAs part of that approval, Allen Morris also agreed to contribute $2 million in public improvements and to cover the funding gap or raise money to fill the gap for the revamp of Ponce Circle Park, as well as any cost overruns. The park sits between the Allen Morris site and the Plaza mixed-use development.\n",

        "content": "Woerner Holdings won preliminary approval to redevelop the landmark Paramount Theatre in Palm Beach into a\nprivate club\nafter pivoting to scaled-back mixed-use plans in reaction to a previous rejection.\nThe family office of Lester Woerner revised its plan to add a residential component and a cafe that will be open to the public, while slashing the size of the club, the Palm Beach Daily News\nreported\n.\nWoerner cut the\nclub\nfrom 45,000 square feet to 5,000 square feet, and trimmed the maximum membership from 475 to 175. The adaptive reuse and renovation will have \u201cchurch-style seating for 200 guests.\u201d\nIt will create a single residence on the third and fourth floors of the\nParamount\n, at 139 North County Road, one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. It features a dome and inner courtyard with a mix of Moorish Revival and Spanish Colonial styles, designed by Austrian architect Joseph Urban.\nThe 5,400-square-foot cafe will have seating for 80, a neighborhood amenity that wasn\u2019t in the previous plan.\nWoerner tapped the Florida Land Use and Environmental Dispute Resolution Act, which allows negotiation without litigation after previous project denials.\nPalm Beach City Council rejected Woerner\u2019s redevelopment plan in 2024 because of concerns over traffic, parking and site density, the outlet said. The council discussed the project for four hours and voted to send the plan to the Landmarks Preservation Commission for review. The plan could win final approval next month.\nThe firm bought the 36,000-square-foot building\nfor $14 million in 2021\n. The seller was Paramount Church, which bought it in 1996 for $3.7 million. The lot spans 1.3 acres, and it is on the National Register of Historic Places, meaning it could qualify for historic tax abatements.\nThe theater was built in 1927 and operated until 1980. A previous developer turned it into a retail and office complex.\n\u2014Rachel Stone",

        "content": "A\nMalibu\nproperty holding court above the beach has come back on the market for $68 million to make for one of the city\u2019s priciest listings.\nThe owner of the home at\n32300 Pacific Coast Highway\nhung up the for-sale sign earlier this month, with the seller looking to handle the trade without agent representation. The last time the property was shopped around for a buyer was in 2022, when it was listed for $65 million. In more recent years, the seller was on the hunt for a renter \u2014 and still is. The listing indicates the property could also be leased for $95,000 a month, potentially wooing prospective visitors in town for this summer\u2019s FIFA World Cup.\nAn inquiry to the seller, who placed the estate on a for-sale-by-owner listing site, was not returned Monday.\nProperty records indicate the owner is trustee Bart Loethen and Brigadoon Trust, which paid $18.3 million for the compound in 2007.\nThe property consists of a main house and beach house sitting atop a nearly 3-acre lot. The listing indicates the combined square footage of the residences is 10,438 square feet, which makes the listing price equivalent to $6,515 per square foot.\nThe main house counts six bedrooms, while the beach house has two beds. In all, there are 10 bathrooms across the two structures. One big highlight is access to El Matador Beach via a private staircase.\nThe Pacific Coast Highway property is now the third-priciest single-family home on the market in Malibu, according to listing sites. But it doesn\u2019t best the $110 million price tag for Johnny Carson\u2019s former residence at 6962 Wildlife Road, which pencils out to $15,530 per square foot. That property was listed in September by Compass\u2019 Chris Cortazzo.\nThere\u2019s also Westside Estate Agency\u2019s Kurt Rappaport\u2019s listing at 27832 Pacific Coast Highway, which is priced at $8,490 per square foot, or $74.5 million.\nLast year saw the\noff-market trade\nof an $80 million home at 28719 Grayfox Street, which topped residential deals in the city for 2025. The market activity was quiet relative to 2024, when Malibu was on a tear with blockbuster residential deals.\nAt the top of that heap was the state record set by Oakley founder\nJim Jannard\n, who landed $210 million for the sale of 33064 Pacific Coast Highway. Later that same year, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs\u2019 widow\nLaurene Powell Jobs\nsnapped up her fourth Malibu property at 28106 Pacific Coast Highway for $94 million. Spec developer\nScott Gillen\nalso nabbed the first buyer for his ultra-luxe community The Case in Malibu, trading 24186 Case Court for $61 million.\n",

The house, at 42 North Central Avenue in the Austin neighborhood, has sat vacant and uninhabitable for roughly 20 years.\nPHH Mortgage, the Florida-based holder of the mortgage, submitted the sole and winning bid \u2014 $240,000 \u2014 at a\ncourt-ordered auction\n. Fannie Mae received the property in December following the foreclosure sale and quietly put it on the market last week.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good news now that the building is out of the mess of the foreclosure process,\u201d Barbara Gordon, executive director of the\nFrank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy\n, told the Chicago Sun-Times. \u201cNow, we\u2019ve got a clear path to possible ownership for somebody to take this on.\u201d\nWhile the asking price might look modest,\nrestoration costs\nare estimated at $2 million or more, and a recent appraisal pegged the property\u2019s value at just $65,000 in its current condition. Any buyer would also face strict landmark requirements. The house is both a Chicago landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, meaning exterior and interior work must closely replicate Wright\u2019s original design.\nBuilt for printing executive Joseph Jacob Walser, the home fused elements \u2014 strong horizontal lines, deep eaves and bands of windows \u2014 that would later define Wright\u2019s\nPrairie School\nstyle. Variations of the same ideas appear in better-known works like the Emil Bach House on the North Side, the Hills-DeCaro House in Oak Park and projects in Indiana and Buffalo, New York.\nLocal preservation groups, including Landmarks Illinois and Preservation Chicago, have been working since 2020 to stabilize the home. Austin Coming Together, a neighborhood nonprofit, has also been circling the property as part of broader investment in the area, including its $40 million redevelopment of a former CPS school across the street.\nThe group\u2019s executive director, Darnell Shields, criticized the list price as \u201cegregious\u201d given the condition, but told the Sun-Times that he still plans to pursue a purchase and convert the house to community use.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s opening salvo of budget negotiations leaves tax hikes off the table and suggests tweaks to a tax incentive for renovating multifamily housing.\nHochul on Tuesday proposed a $260 billion state budget for fiscal year 2027. Despite pressure from the left to increase corporate and income taxes, the governor kept rates flat, only proposing to extend the top corporate tax rate (7.25 percent) through 2029, according to an overview provided by the governor\u2019s office. The corporate tax rate was slated to expire at the end of this year.\n\u201cThis is not an austerity budget, but it is a disciplined one,\u201d Hochul said during an address on Tuesday.\nDuring his campaign, Mayor Zohran Mamdani called for tax increases as a way to fund his key campaign promises, including free buses and city-owned grocery stores. The city is also staring down an\nestimated $12 billion\nbudget gap this and next fiscal year.\n\u201cIt is time to ask New York City\u2019s wealthiest and large corporations to pay their fair share, while also working toward a fiscal relationship with the State that better reflects New York City\u2019s status as the economic engine of the state,\u201d Mamdani said in a statement, noting that he rejects \u201causterity politics.\u201d\nThe executive budget includes a proposal to reform the tax break J-51, according to a budget book released on Tuesday. The tax abatement is provided to certain owners who renovate their multifamily properties in exchange for keeping the apartments rent-stabilized at least through the duration of the incentive.\nThe City Council\nrenewed\nthe incentive in 2024, more than a year after the state\napproved\na new version of the tax break that limited what buildings would be eligible. The abatement is available for owners of apartment buildings that are at least 50 percent affordable, part of the state\u2019s Mitchell-Lama program or otherwise receiving \u201csubstantial government assistance.\u201d Co-ops and condos are only eligible if each unit\u2019s assessed value does not exceed $45,000.\nThe budget book doesn\u2019t provide details on how the abatement would be changed, however. Landlord groups have criticized the changes to the program made by the state legislature in 2023 that further restricted what buildings qualify for the incentive.\nThis is the final year of the governor\u2019s $25 billion five-year housing plan. The state has created or preserved more than 70,000 housing units so far, and is on track to reach 100,000 by the end of the year. The executive budget includes $250 million to \u201caccelerate new construction of affordable housing units,\u201d and to get a jump on the state\u2019s next housing plan.\nThe new funding will also supplement the expansion of\nfederal housing credits\n.\nDetails of other major initiatives remain unclear. During her State of the State\naddress\nlast week, Hochul unveiled a proposal to exempt most housing projects from the State Environmental Quality Review Act, or SEQRA.\nThe budget book doesn\u2019t include more specifics of this program, though it indicates that she wants to increase Department of Environmental Conservation staffing to \u201caddress general permitting timeframes and backlogs.\u201d Details on non-fiscal policy proposals in the executive budget will be released separately on Tuesday.\nThe proposed budget includes $50 million for the Housing Voucher Access Program, a state-based housing voucher program that serves families or individuals who are homeless or in imminent danger of losing their homes. The funding level is the same as\nlast year\u2019s allocation\n, which fell significantly short of the $250 million sought by advocates.\nAs revealed during her State of the State address, the executive budget incorporates\nlegislation\nintroduced last year that would upgrade felony charges against landlords who systematically harass rent-regulated tenants across multiple buildings or are \u201crepeat serious offenders.\u201d\nThe budget book doesn\u2019t mention property tax reform, nor additional relief for rent-stabilized landlords. Landlord groups have pushed for legislation to allow one-time rent resets in vacant stabilized apartments, but such proposals haven\u2019t progressed in recent years.\nThe majorities in the Senate and Assembly will put forward their own budget proposals before a final spending plan is hashed out.\n",

        "content": "Los Angeles Lakers coach JJ Redick has kept his team\u2019s record afloat this year despite injuries to star players like LeBron James and Austin Reaves.\nThe same can\u2019t be said for the asking price of his Dumbo penthouse. But after dropping the ask to just under $6 million, Reddick found a buyer for the duplex atop 51 Jay Street, according to Compass\u2019 weekly report for contracts signed on homes asking at least $2 million from Jan. 12 to Jan. 18.\nReddick bought the home for nearly $6.1 million in 2017, according to public records. In 2021, he listed the nearly 3,000-square-foot spread for $8.5 million before cutting the price to $7 million in 2022.\nHe took the home off the market for three years before re-listing it in September at $6.2 million and two months later dropping the price one last time.\nFeaturing four bedrooms and four full bathrooms, designer Michael Aiduss redesigned the home in 2019 from a pied-\u00e0-terre to a full-time residence, according to a feature in\nArchitectural Digest\n.\nThe home has a great room with floor-to-ceiling glass windows that leads out to a 2,500-square-foot landscape terrace.\u00a0 The primary suite has its own private terrace, while the upper level has two more bedrooms surrounded by another terrace.\nThe contract was the priciest deal signed in the borough last week.\nCompass\u2019 Rachel Greenstein, Suzanne Koxvold and Toni Nicolo had the listing.\nReddick\u2019s unit is not the only to sell after a series of discounts in the 74-unit building. The last three condos marked as sold on StreetEasy have only traded hands after the seller lowered the asking price to below the price for which they bought the unit.\nPart of the problem sellers have had in recouping a profit might stem from a\n2020 lawsuit\nin which the condo board sued the sponsors, Adam America Real Estate and Slate Property Group, for alleged construction defects. That case is still ongoing, according to recent court filings.\nThe second most expensive contract signed last week was for a Columbia Street Waterfront townhouse at 113A Columbia Street asking $4.4 million.\nThe seller was Emma Fusco-Straub, best-selling author and owner of popular Brooklyn book store Books Are Magic, which has stores in Cobble Hill and Brooklyn Heights, according to public records. Fusco-Straub bought the home for $4.1 million in 2015.\nSpanning 4,000 square feet and featuring five bedrooms and three full bathrooms, the home comes with a multi-car garage with a direct entrance inside. The first three floors have balconies facing the water and the top floor holds a terrace. A private elevator services all floors.\nCompass\u2019 Ria Browne had the listing.\nThe two deals topped an otherwise slow week for the Brooklyn luxury market. The borough scored 10 contracts \u2014 six condos and four houses \u2014 signed from Jan. 13 to Jan. 19 for a total contract volume of $33 million, according to Compass\u2019 weekly report of contracts for homes asking at least $2 million.\nLast\nweek\n, Brooklyn\u2019s luxury market saw 17 deals signed for an average contract volume of $57 million.\nThe homes put into contract last week had a median asking price of $2.9 million, spent an average of 181 days on the market and had an average discount of 3 percent.\n",

        "content": "Amazon is pushing further into brick-and-mortar retail, winning local approval to build its largest store format to date in suburban Chicago \u2014 a move that could reset expectations for how the e-commerce giant uses physical space to compete with Walmart and Target.\nThe village board of trustees in Orland Park voted 5-to-2 on Monday to approve Amazon\u2019s plans for a massive store at the southwest corner of 159th Street and LaGrange Road. CoStar\nreported\nthat the decision clears the way for a 229,000-square-foot building on a 35-acre site, following an earlier signoff from the village\u2019s plan commission.\nThe store would be Amazon\u2019s biggest\nphysical retail\nconcept so far, blending traditional big-box merchandising with a small warehouse component to support on-site operations. Plans call for a broad assortment of goods, including groceries and household staples, positioning the store squarely against established\nbig-box rivals\n.\nOrland Park officials publicly unveiled Amazon\u2019s proposal earlier in January, and the outlet reported that the project is expected to draw close scrutiny from both competitors and retail real estate players, as one of the world\u2019s largest companies experiments with a sprawling, warehouse-sized storefront.\nThe site sits about 25 miles southwest of the Loop, in a heavily trafficked retail corridor near Orland Square mall. Nearby anchors include Costco, Aldi, Jewel-Osco, a Walmart Supercenter and Target \u2014 a lineup that shows how directly Amazon is stepping into the suburban big-box battlefield, according to the publication.\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment on a construction timeline or when the store might open.\nThe approval marks another chapter in Amazon\u2019s uneven but persistent push into physical retail. Since acquiring Whole Foods Market in 2017, the Seattle-based company has tested a rotating cast of store concepts nationwide, including\nAmazon Fresh\n, Amazon Grocery and cashierless Amazon Go locations. Other experiments \u2014 Amazon Books,\nAmazon 4-star\nand Pop Up stores \u2014 have been shuttered as the company refined its approach.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

But it was a rocky road to the sale marked by legal back-and-forth and nearly a decade of construction work.\nIn 2021, Zoom CEO Eric Yuan agreed to buy the property before it was finished, though the executive never closed the deal. The builder, Ali Sadeghi,\ntook Yuan to court\nover the drawn-out discussion timelines and $37 million construction cost. The home finally hit the market in the fall of 2024 at $55 million, and the price\nhovered around $50 million\nover the following year.\nJoe Piazza of Coldwell Banker was recruited by the developer to sell the mansion, showing the house to both local buyers and\nChinese billionaires\n. \u201cWhat am I going to do to bring a lifestyle to the buyers, and to really immerse them into the home, and then to, quite honestly, compel them to get involved?\u201d Piazza told the Standard of his thought process.\nThe winning bid was an all-cash offer from an unidentified \u201ctop Silicon Valley executive\u201d who bought the property through an LLC managed by a Marin-based CPA, according to public records reviewed by the Standard. The buyer was represented by Ken DeLeon of DeLeon Realty.\nThe buyer didn\u2019t just buy the house itself; the $45.5 million price tag included all the staged furniture inside. \u201cI sold the whole enchilada,\u201d Piazza said. The mansion boasts nine bedrooms, 14 bathrooms, five kitchens, two panic rooms and a 14-seat movie theater. Outside, the property has a glass-walled pool, a heated cabana with a kitchen and bath, a fruit orchard, a one-bedroom guest house and a sports court. Overall, the Tuscaloosa Avenue home spans nearly 17,000 square feet on a 1.4-acre lot.\nWhile Atherton has long been the priciest ZIP code in the country, the town recently\nlost the top spot to Fisher Island\nin Miami Beach, toppling Atherton\u2019s $8.3 million median sales price with a $9.5 million median sales price.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Wall Street\u2019s growing grip on single-family rentals is increasingly best illustrated in Houston, a Sun Belt market where institutional landlords snapped up thousands of homes after the pandemic and reshaped entire neighborhoods.\nBut housing experts contend that President Trump\u2019s proposal to ban large institutional investors from buying more homes would likely do little to make homes more affordable for Houstonians, the Houston Chronicle\nreported\n.\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s always popular politically to announce that you\u2019re going to slay a Wall Street dragon, this crusade isn\u2019t going to save the princess,\u201d Rick Sharga, president and CEO of CJ Patrick Company, told the outlet. \u201cThe numbers simply aren\u2019t large enough to make a difference.\u201d\nInstitutional investors \u2014 typically defined as landlords owning at least 1,000 homes \u2014 accounted for just 2.9 percent of home purchases nationally in the first nine months of 2025, according to data from Cotality. Trump has said he will flesh out the proposal this month at the World Economic Forum in Davos, though\nthe plan\nwould likely require congressional action and faces major questions about enforcement.\nIn Houston, the investor share of\nrentals\nlooks even smaller when narrowed to the biggest players. While investors overall own about 16.8 percent of the region\u2019s housing stock, or roughly 325,000 homes, large institutional firms control just 12,500 houses, less than 1 percent of all homes in the metro area, Sharga said.\nThat limited share doesn\u2019t mean the impact is evenly spread. Large investors are heavily concentrated in\nspecific neighborhoods\nlike Atascocita and parts of Aldine, where more than 20 percent of single-family rentals were owned by 26 major investment firms as of 2023, according to research by Stephen Avrill Sherman of Rice University\u2019s Kinder Institute for Urban Research.\nStill, Trump administration officials have indicated the proposal would not force investors to sell existing homes, meaning those pockets of high investor ownership would likely remain intact even if a ban moved forward.\nSupporters of a ban argue institutional investors outbid would-be homeowners and crowd them out of starter homes. In theory, restricting that demand could put downward pressure on prices, said Thom Malone, principal economist at Cotality. In practice, he told the publication, other buyers would likely step in.\n\u201cEven if institutional investors disappeared, it probably wouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal,\u201d Malone said, noting that smaller investors could simply replace them.\nSome analysts also point out that many homes targeted by large landlords are older and in need of rehab, properties that may not appeal to typical owner-occupants. Without investor capital, some could sit vacant and deteriorate.\nPotential ripple effects could follow. A ban could cool new home construction if builders anticipate fewer buyers, and it could squeeze renters if the supply of single-family rentals shrinks. About a quarter of\nHouston-area renters\nlive in single-family homes, according to a 2023 Kinder Institute housing report.\nLarge landlords, for their part, say they provide a needed rung on the housing ladder. A spokesperson for Pretium, which owns thousands of Houston-area homes, said the firm offers \u201cquality rental homes in neighborhoods of opportunity\u201d for families saving to buy.\nFor economists, the bigger takeaway is that affordability fixes are slower. Changing zoning rules, boosting supply and expanding down payment assistance don\u2019t make for splashy announcements, said Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather, but they address the root problem.\n\u201cWhen politicians are looking for a quick win on housing, they gravitate to solutions that sound great,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t solve the tough problem of increasing housing supply.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The townhomes will span 1,960 square feet with one-car garages across five two-story buildings. The Riviera Beach City Council is scheduled to vote on the project Wednesday.\nThe development will be market-rate but will target residents earning between 80 and 120 percent of the area median income, said Zach Ciciera, a senior land planner with Cotleur &amp; Hearing, the project\u2019s planning firm. That\u2019s $65,400 to $98,280 a year for one person, according to last year\u2019s HUD guidelines.\nThe developer hasn\u2019t landed on whether to offer the units for sale or as rentals and asked for flexibility in a December hearing with the city\u2019s Planning and Zoning Board, which unanimously backed the proposal.\nCiciera estimated prices of $400,000 to $550,000 for condos or $2,800 to $3,400 a month as rentals.\nIf approved, the developer would have 18 months to start construction and five years to obtain a certificate of occupancy, and it will be required to report its efforts to hire Riviera Beach residents and contract with local businesses.\nSinatra CEO and founder Nicholas Sinatra\u2019s entity paid $2.5 million for the vacant property in September 2023. It\u2019s flanked by two plant nurseries and the\n69-acre Arbor Parc single-family community\nthat was co-developed by Lennar and 13\nth\nFloor.\nIt is across the street from the 16-acre site where South Miami-based the Estate Companies plan to build a 255-unit complex called Soleste on the Trail with apartments between 700 and 1,000 square feet.\nRiviera Beach has attracted real estate investors in recent years, as developers seek frontiers to build in South Florida and city leaders look to grow the tax base and create jobs.\nLarger projects on the drawing board include\nSobelCo\u2019s 1.2 million-square-foot\nmixed-use project at 1117 Broadway and Peter Baytarian\u2019s Forest Development\u2019s two 25-story\nOculina\ncondos at 3700 Broadway. Baytarian also recently\nwon a competitive bid to build a $325 million\nmixed-use development with up to 450 apartments at 1851 Broadway.\nThe Related Group\u2019s\nRelated Urban landed a $100 million construction loan\nin September to build 149 workforce housing units near the city-owned Marina Village area.\nThat project, the eight-story Residences at Marina Village, will be built next to the planned\n20-story Gallery at Marina Village\n, a development by the Related Group, BH Group and Tezral Partners. The city is\ntaking bids from developers\non a nearby 12-acre section of Marina Village.\nMeanwhile, Riviera Beach tapped\nSonnenblick Development for a $481 million redevelopment\nthat will include a new city hall and library, a sports complex and residential development on 72 acres of city-owned land.",

The new plan calls for a 26-story building with 195 residential units and 252 parking spaces.\nWilshire Skyline pointed to the recent passage of SB 92, which prohibits the inclusion of hotel uses in density bonus projects such as its original proposal, as a looming legal hurdle that could jeopardize the hotel segment\u2019s construction. Initial plans called for a 14-story structure with 116 studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments, including 24 affordable units, as well as a 60-room hotel, about 7,300 square feet of\nground-floor retail\nand subterranean parking for 140 vehicles.\nThe\nBeverly Hills City Council\nadopted a motion to vacate the approval of the original 14-story plan and send the item back to the Planning Commission. City staff did so after acknowledging the applicant\u2019s stated intent to not move forward with the original process. The commission will now have to process Wilshire Skyline\u2019s revised application for the 26-story project.\nWhether or not Wilshire Skyline moves forward using\nbuilder\u2019s remedy,\nwhich allows developers to bypass local zoning and build high-density affordable housing projects to help municipalities reach state housing goals, remains to be seen, though housing is slated for the location regardless. Wilshire Skyline has already received approvals for a smaller eight-story development at the 9229 Wilshire Boulevard site, which\nwould include\n56 one-, two-, three- and four-bedroom units above 7,926 square feet of ground-floor retail and parking for 119 vehicles, Urbanize Los Angeles previously reported.\nAnother developer, Crescent Heights, had a builder\u2019s remedy project\nrejected by the Beverly Hills Planning Commission\nin November. That proposal called for turning an empty lot at 8844 Burton Way into a 26-story building with 38 studio, two- and three-bedroom apartments with 22 units set aside for affordable housing.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A nearly 29,000-square-foot mansion is going up on the lakefront site of a\nhistoric Winnetka home\nafter the owners received approval last year to demolish it and build a new house.\nThe mansion\u2019s construction is expected to cost $10 million, according to a building permit application obtained by\nThe Real Deal\n, making it one of the most expensive construction projects along the lakefront in Winnetka in recent years.\nShiraz and Vijay Kotte\n, both health care executives, won approval to build the new home at 445 Sheridan Road in Winnetka in June, according to the permit application. The permit application states the new house will be 28,690 square feet, making it among the largest lakefront homes in Winnetka.\nThe couple purchased the Winnetka property, known as the Clement Stone Mansion, in 2023 for $12.3 million, property records show. Design plans for the new home are not available in the permit application, but Vijay Kotte, CEO of Chicago-based GoHealth, told village officials in 2024 it would be a French-style home with a transitional interior, according to meeting records.\nThe new mansion is being designed by architect Michael Hershenson, the permit says. Heritage Luxury Homes, the North Shore builder run by Leo and Milena Birov, is handling general contracting. Neither Hershenson nor Birov responded to requests for comment.\nIt\u2019s not clear how far along the home is in the construction process. The Kottes secured a demolition permit by January of last year, according to Winnetka meeting documents. An Instagram post by a historic preservation blog in August 2025 shows the empty lot after the home had been demolished. Vijay Kotte did not respond to requests for comment.\nBuilt in 1912 by socialite and real estate investor Lena P. Gilmore, the original mansion was a rare example of the Spanish Revival style in Winnetka. The estate featured white stucco walls, a red clay tile roof, and a third-floor ballroom. Throughout its century-long history, the property underwent several renovations, including the addition of a coach house in 1936 and a modern restoration in 2006 that aimed to preserve its historic character.\nThe mansion had a long lineage of notable owners, including hotel magnate Albert Pick and James G. McMillan, president of the Wander Company, which manufactured Ovaltine. W. Stone Clement, an insurance executive and self-help author, purchased the home in 1966 and lived there until his death in 2005.\nThe teardown is\npart of a trend\nalong the lakefront of homeowners scrapping older homes to make way for new mansions with modern styles and amenities, often to the dismay of preservation activists. The construction also ran up against Winnetka\u2019s ordinance limiting construction on or near the bluffs along Lake Michigan. The rule, approved in 2024, was widely viewed as a response to\nbillionaire Justin Ishbia\u2019s\nplans for a sprawling $77 million megamansion on Sheridan Road.\nThe Kottes, through the LLC that owns the home, were previously among\na group of homeowners\nwho sued the city over that ordinance, arguing the rule cut millions of dollars from their property values. But the Kottes ended their involvement in the litigation in December, months after they won approval to build their home, according to court documents.\nIn the 2024 meeting when the village passed the ordinance, Kotte said he would have reconsidered purchasing the home, and the purchase price, had he known the building restrictions would be passed,\nTRD previously reported\n. The new home had to comply with the ordinance\u2019s rules, but little conflict existed over the plans, based on the application materials.\nThe Kottes\u2019 bid to build a new home faced fierce opposition from Winnetka preservation officials, prompting Laura Good, a member of Winnetka\u2019s Historic Preservation Commission, to resign from the board, according to meeting records. The commission does not have authority to block demolition for most properties, but it can \u2014 and did, in this case \u2014 impose a 270-day delay.\nIn a series of meetings in 2024, members of the village\u2019s Historic Preservation Commission said the home was one of the most iconic lakefront homes in Winnetka and asked Kotte to consider renovating or selling the home rather than demolishing it, meeting records show.\nKotte said during the meetings that he had initially planned to rehabilitate the house, but after inspection realized that renovation was not possible, according to meeting minutes. He also said the village\u2019s bluff construction ordinance, adopted after the Kottes bought the home, made additions to it difficult.\nThe home\u2019s \u201cnarrow footprint\u201d and \u201cinadequate floorplan\u201d were other impediments to renovation, Kotte told the commissioners in 2024.\nGood resigned from the commission after the June 17, 2024 meeting, saying her motivation was disappointment at \u201cnot being able to save 445 Sheridan Road from being demolished,\u201d according to meeting minutes.\n",

The comptroller also claimed they diverted tens of millions of dollars in Medicaid funding intended for vulnerable residents to themselves, according to NJ.com.\nTo hide their alleged scheme, they reportedly hid these actions through falsified state and federal filings.\nHagler and Rozenberg are both well-known in NYC real estate circles. Hagler has been a backer of Brooklyn dealmaker Isaac Hager. He also has acquired an Astoria commercial property known as the\nCigar Factory\n. Rozenberg\u2019s son owns the Israeli national airline El Al.\nBoth the lawsuit and comptroller\u2019s report highlighted the poor conditions at the New Jersey nursing homes despite the flow of Medicaid payments. The Hammonton and Deptford police reportedly received more than 3,400 emergency calls about the facilities from 2019 to 2024.\nHagler and Rozenberg allegedly moved money off the nursing home books and into their bank accounts through a network of related companies, including Bronx-based Centers for Care, per the comptroller\u2019s report.\nThe agency said the most lucrative scam run by Hagler and Rozenberg was through mortgages and rent payments. This was allegedly done by legally separating the nursing home operations and the nursing home properties (also known as Opco vs. Propco).\nHagler and Rozenberg were allegedly able to combine these two parts of the business to obtain $63.2 million in mortgages, which was more than the actual purchase price, according to the comptroller\u2019s report.\n\u201cThis scheme allowed Hagler and Rozenberg to purchase and own the nursing homes for nearly nothing, a mere 1.5 percent deposit,\u201d the New Jersey Office of the State Comptroller said in its report.\nRozenberg and Hagler did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\u2014\nKeith Larsen\n",

The Newport-Mesa Family YMCA site is located next to the Upper Newport Bay Nature Reserve and currently holds an approximately 18,000-square-foot fitness center and a pool.\nYMCA officials hope to expand the main facility to 51,000 square feet and install new amenities including a cafe, aquatics center, gymnasium, teaching kitchen, children\u2019s areas and educational facilities.

        "content": "A fast-growing freight brokerage is betting on downtown Chicago again, more than doubling its office space as it makes room for what could be another 200 jobs in the city\u2019s core.\nTransLoop signed a sublease for 44,457 square feet at the building at\n350 North Orleans Street\n, where it will relocate its headquarters next month from roughly 17,000 square feet at 1 South Wacker Drive,\naccording\nto Crain\u2019s. The firm is taking over the entire ninth floor from research and advisory company Gartner, whose sublease runs through May 2029.\nThe move adds to a recent run of office expansions by\ntransportation and logistics firms\n, a sector that has quietly become one of downtown Chicago\u2019s brighter spots as office vacancy remains elevated. The outlet reported that Chicago has long been a national hub for freight and shipping intermediaries, and the sector expanded rapidly after 2020 as e-commerce growth forced companies to rethink supply chains.\nTransLoop\u2019s new space could accommodate up to 200 additional employees locally, according to CBRE, which represented the company in the lease. The firm has been scaling quickly: TransLoop said its sales jumped 46 percent in 2025, year-over-year, to more than $255 million. CBRE brokers Brian McDonnell and Bill Sheehy negotiated the lease.\nWhile TransLoop isn\u2019t leasing directly from the owner of the building at\n350 North Orleans\n, the deal is a vote of confidence for a riverfront building whose future has been anything but settled. An affiliate of New York-based private equity giant Blackstone Group failed to pay off the property\u2019s $310 million mortgage when it matured in 2023, pushing the property into distress.\nThe building is now controlled by real estate firm Trigild as receiver, with KeyBank acting as special servicer on the loan for bondholders. The debt was bundled into commercial mortgage-backed securities when Blackstone refinanced the property in 2018.\nTransLoop\u2019s sublease follows another recent expansion in the building by online payments company\nStripe\n, signs that tenants remain willing to commit to the property despite the ownership limbo, according to the publication.\nThe deal also serves as an example of how sublease space continues to shape downtown leasing. Sublease availability is down sharply from its pandemic-era peak, though CBRE data shows downtown sublease space ticked up in the fourth quarter for the first time in two years, driven in part by Walgreens Boots Alliance listing its entire leased space in the Old Post Office.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The Texas Tribune\nreported\nthat the report found that grid demand from Texas data centers alone is expected to exceed 40 gigawatts by 2028, a staggering jump from today\u2019s levels and an amount that would put the state ahead of every other market in the country.\nFor context, data centers in Texas had a maximum power demand of about 8 gigawatts in 2025, compared with the state\u2019s peak grid demand of 94 gigawatts, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages the grid. One gigawatt is enough to power roughly 700,000 homes for a year.\nTexas is already home to about 387 data centers, but the pipeline is swelling fast. Over the past year, companies including Google, Nvidia and Anthropic announced major projects in the state, along with ventures tied to former Google CEO\nEric Schmidt\nand Rick Perry\u2019s\nFermi REIT\n.

Bloom Energy projects Texas\u2019 data center growth will outpace all other states, leapfrogging traditional hubs like Oregon and California, where restrictions on new gas-fired power plants are tighter.\n\u201cAs you think about onsite generation, no matter where you are in the U.S., 100 percent of onsite generation is largely happening with natural gas \u2014 and Texas certainly has a lot of access,\u201d Bloom Energy\u2019s chief commercial officer, Aman Joshi, told the outlet.\nThe scale of projects is also ballooning. By 2030, one in five data centers nationwide is expected to exceed 1 gigawatt in maximum energy demand. By 2035, that ratio climbs to one in three, according to the report, underscoring how AI workloads are reshaping both real estate and energy planning.\nCapital is already pouring in. As previously reported in\nThe Real Deal\n, more than $3.4 billion in new data center construction projects were registered in Texas in 2025, according to filings with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. In December alone, new projects\u2019 construction budgets totaled more than $1.4 billion.\nBut Bloom Energy\u2019s analysis also flags a growing disconnect between data center developers and power providers. As demand surges, grid interconnections are becoming harder to secure and more expensive.\n\u201cPower can no longer be treated as a downstream consideration,\u201d the report stated, warning that developers who plan around traditional grid assumptions risk delays and downsized projects.\nTo get around those constraints, more operators are pairing data centers with onsite power generation, including natural gas plants and fuel cells like those made by Bloom Energy. About one-third of all data centers are expected to have onsite generation by 2030.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A ranching family bought 1,400 acres of\nfarm land west of Fort Worth\n, including a luxury estate.\nTwo neighboring farms in Palo Pinto County are now\nconsolidated\nunder the Hat 6 brand, a ranching operation run by the Greeman family based near Tishomingo, Oklahoma. The complex purchase was finalized last month, property records and listing websites show. The final sale price is unavailable, but the properties were listed for about $28.5 million altogether.\nThe smaller of the two tracts, the Firewater Ranch, is a 524-acre property that produces hay and includes a 14-acre lake stocked with bass and bluegill, according to the listing. Icon Global listed the property for $8.5 million, about $16,000 per acre. The seller is Dallas investor Dean MacFarlan, records show.\nThe larger tract, dubbed the K6, accounts for the lion\u2019s share of the price. Hall and Hall broker Brett Grier listed the property for just under $20 million, amounting to almost $23,000 per acre. The seller, real estate\ndeveloper\nChad Krippner, spent the last three years adding\nequestrian facilities\n, a pickleball court and a 5,200-square-foot timber frame home to the property. The home includes a pool, a gym and an outdoor kitchen, according to the listing.\n\u201cMost ranches like that, when they have that much improvements on them, they don\u2019t come up for sale for 10 or 15 years,\u201d Grier said.\nThe K6 farm also produces between 400 and 500 bales of coastal Bermuda hay yearly, he added.\nThe land is north of Mineral Walls and just east of Highway 281. Mineral Wells is about an hour west of Fort Worth.\nWalt and Joc Greeman acquired the land through a 1031 exchange facilitated by PSI Exchange Holdings, a Midland, Texas-based company, public records show. Krippner and MacFarlan sold their tracts to PSI Exchange Holdings in July and October, respectively, before PSI conveyed the land to the Greemans\u2019 company. PSI specializes in 1031 exchanges.\nTheir Oklahoma farm is now for sale. Icon Global is marketing the 1,567-acre property near Tishomingo for $9.4 million.\nFort Worth is a prominent hub for rodeo and horse sports, boosting value for land fitted with equestrian facilities. An 860-acre horse ranch near Weatherford, about halfway between Mineral Springs and Fort Worth, recently sold after asking $43 million.\n",

        "content": "Summit Properties last week won its battle to purchase a portfolio of thousands of New York apartments from Pinnacle Group. Pinnacle put the collection of mostly rent-stabilized units into bankruptcy and held an auction for a buyer, with Mayor Zohran Mamdani and groups of tenants trying unsuccessfully to stop the sale.\nHere\u2019s the deal by the numbers, according to court documents and disclosures Summit made on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, which it has tapped for financing:\n$451.3 million bid\nSummit won a bid to purchase the bankrupt portfolio for\n$451.3 million\n.\nThat works out to approximately\n$87,000 per unit\nor\n$1,030 per square meter\n. In American terms, that\u2019s a little less than\n$96 per square foot.\n5.25 percent interest\nSummit arranged financing for the bid from Flagstar Bank, which has historically been a major lender to New York\u2019s rent-stabilized property owners.\nBut Flagstar has been trying to get rent-stabilized loans off its books due to distress in the market. It was the biggest creditor in the Pinnacle bankruptcy case, and was owed $564 million.\nFlagstar agreed to loan Summit $338.5 million for the acquisition, due in three years. That works out to\n75 percent\nof the bid being debt-financed. There is no payment required on the loan principal for two years.\nSummit has said it will have extra cash flow because it\u2019s been able to lower the debt on the portfolio as well as lower the interest rate on that debt.\nThe loan will have a fixed\n5.25 percent interest rate\n, lower than the\nrates of 7.5 and 10.25 percent\nthat Pinnacle says it paid at times.\n23 percent NOI boost\nSummit expects the purchase to boost its net operating income, meaning revenue after expenses but not debt service, by\n23 percent.\nThe portfolio itself is expected to make\n$36 million in net operating income\nannually. That\u2019s approximately\n8 percent of the purchase price.\n5,150 units\nThe portfolio consisted of\n5,150 residential units\nacross 98 buildings. But also part of the holdings are\n52 commercial units\n,\n326 parking spaces\nand\none parking garage\n.\nThe buildings are\n95 percent occupied,\nwith about\nhalf in Brooklyn\n,\none-quarter in Manhattan\nand\n18 percent in Queens\n.\nThe sale is expected to close in\nFebruary\n.\n$30 million in capital expenditures\nSummit chair Zohar Levy has said he expects to spend\n$10 million\non the portfolio in the first year, with\n$3 million\nof that for addressing existing violations and the other\n$7 million\nfor a maintenance backlog.\nLevy said he expects to clear half of the existing violations in the\nfirst two months,\nwith the rest cleared within\nsix months of the sale\n.\nHe expects to spend\n$5 million\non maintenance for the next four years, coming out to a total of\n$30 million over five years\n.\n",

The seller,\n505 West 19 PH2 LLC\n, had purchased the property in 2016 for $17.9 million. The buyer was\nMI 8787 LLC.\nThe 4,600-square-foot pad has four bedrooms, three and a half baths, terraces and nearly 3,400 square feet of rooftop space. It also has a sauna, heated bathroom floors and floor-to-ceiling retractable glass doors for indoor/outdoor entertaining. Reserve\u2019s\nTrish Riedel, Keren Atzlan\nand\nJon Isaacs\nhad the listing, which went live in September.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe\nChristian Heritage Church\nhad the priciest commercial transaction recorded in the Big Apple, with the sale of its property at\n740 40th Street\nin Sunset Park for $10 million. The buyer was an LLC tied to Brooklyn-based contractor\nRoyal Builders\n. The property measures 6,750 square feet, pricing the transaction at about $1,500 per square foot.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nJewelry designer\nToni Goutal\nsold a co-op at\n765 Park Avenue\non the Upper East Side for $18.3 million. The buyer was a trust. The residence has five bedrooms, six and a half baths, a private elevator landing and a 29-foot gallery. Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s\nSerena Boardman\nrepresented Goutal, who put the co-op on the market in March with an asking price of $20 million.\nGoutal in September\npurchased a 3,000-square-foot condo at The Surrey Residences at 20 East 76th Street for $15 million.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Gary Barancik\n, a senior advisor at financial advisory firm Perella Weinberg Partners, parted with a penthouse at\n24 Fifth Avenue\nin Greenwich Village for $8.5 million. The buyer was a trust. The duplex unit has three bedrooms and three and a half baths. It also has a double-height great room and 2,500 square feet of private terrace space. Barancik had owned the unit since 2010, purchasing it for $5.3 million. He put it on the market in May 2024 for $12 million, according to StreetEasy. Compass\u2019\nHudson Advisory\nteam had the listing.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nArtist\nMargit Newman\nsold a co-op at\n533 Canal Street\n, also known as\n477 Washington Street\n, in Hudson Square for $6.9 million. The buyers were\nRohit and Sonal Chopra.\nThe full-floor, four-bedroom pad measures 4,800 square feet; the deal comes out to more than $1,400 per square foot.

The unit went on the market in August for $7.4 million.\nBy the Numbers:\nRetail closures poised to fare better this year after rocky 2025\nLast year was tough for U.S. major retailers, which announced more store closures than they had the year before \u2014 but 2026 seems to be off to a bit of a better start, even amid a major retail bankruptcy filing.\nIn 2025, there were 8,270 announced closures, up almost 13 percent year over year, according to data from Coresight Research. There were also 5,270 announced openings last year, down 11 percent year over year.\nRite Aid, the\npharmacy chain that filed for bankruptcy\nfor a second time last year, ranked No. 1 for having the most announced closures last year, with 1,292 locations.

        "content": "Some notions become so ingrained in our thinking that we don\u2019t realize they are wrong.\nWhen someone comes along with a better way, people either cling to misguided beliefs or change. What are the consequences of failing to evolve?\nIn sports, the results show up on the scoreboard. Teams, coaches and players who adopt better strategies, techniques, training methods and equipment start winning. Those who don\u2019t disappear, along with the old ways.\n\u201cMoneyball\u201d is now called analytics, and it\u2019s in every sport. That\u2019s why NFL coaches no longer punt on 4th-and-1 past midfield, and NBA teams attempt 37 three-pointers per game, up from 9 in 1992-93.\nIt exists in real estate as well.\nWhen I spoke last week to Vanbarton principal Richard A.C. Coles to prepare for our Jan. 29\nSalon Series interview\n, he said the firm can outbid others on conversion plays because Vanbarton has learned how to do them more efficiently.\nThe methods Vanbarton uses to maximize livable space and minimize cost when turning offices into apartments will eventually predominate because the firms that practice them can bid the highest for sites.\nElected officials are slower to evolve. Unlike in sports and business, there is no scoreboard or bidding process to speed up the process of natural selection. We rely on voters to oust leaders with outdated thinking. Elections are an indirect, imperfect way to improve policy.\nJust to take one of many examples:\nState Sen. Brian Kavanagh and Assembly member Sarahana Shrestha are\npushing a bill\nto make it easier for localities to adopt rent stabilization, a system that since 1974 has made a mess of New York City\u2019s housing market.\nIf a tennis player today tried to compete with a 1974 approach \u2014 wood racket, minimal training, no nutritionist and outdated tactics \u2014 he would be crushed. But Kavanagh and Shrestha, seeking to expand a failed housing strategy, will be re-elected this year. They might not even have an opponent.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nRep. Maxine Waters, in a\nstatement\nsupporting a\ngood\n, bipartisan\nhousing bill\n, said, \u201cToo many families are one rent increase away from losing their homes.\u201d\nThat probably wasn\u2019t intended as a potshot at landlords, but it did seem to say that they trigger homelessness by hiking the rent. That is typically not how it happens.\nHomelessness results when people in tight housing markets suffer a financial or personal setback, stop paying their current rent and cannot easily find a new place. The top two explanations people give when seeking shelter beds in New York City are domestic violence and eviction.\nHave you heard of anyone becoming homeless because of a rent increase? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Several weeks after a deed is recorded in New York City, the owner may receive a\ndeceptive\n\u201cRECORDED DEED NOTICE\u201d from a California company called Property Site. It requests $128 and has a \u201cdetach and mail\u201d section at the bottom of the page. In return, duped property owners receive a \u201cproperty assessment profile\u201d \u2014 which consists of information\navailable for free\nfrom the city.\nElsewhere\u2026\nWith the legislative session underway in Albany, the city can ask for the $70 billion in bonding authority that Mayor Zohran Mamdani said during his campaign he needs for his $100 billion, 200,000-unit, union-built affordable housing program.\nOr, realizing that Gov. Kathy Hochul is not willing to let the city borrow so much, Mamdani could omit it from his Albany wish list this year.\nI doubt the mayor will give up on his dream of building low-rent housing with union labor. He mentioned it just the other day. But something has to give, because Hochul is focused on funding child care and her own housing initiatives, and Mamdani, even with a no-limit credit card, cannot build 200,000 units in 10 years at $500,000 apiece.\nHow close to those numbers can he get? The state\u2019s Vital Brooklyn project provides a clue.\nJust last month, developers L+M Development Partners, Services for the UnderServed, Apex Building Group and RiseBoro finished Alafia Phase 1, a $387 million project with 576 affordable homes in East New York. It also has a 15,000-square-foot clinic and 7,800-square-foot supermarket space, but just dividing the total cost by the number of units comes to $672,000 apiece.\nMamdani\u2019s 10-year timeline might be even less realistic. The request for proposals that yielded Alafia Phase 1 was issued in 2018. The mayor needs to build 347 projects of that size. Better get cracking.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$21 million\nfor a 4,585-square-foot condominium unit at 505 West 19th Street in Chelsea. The property last sold for $17.9 million in 2016. Trish Riedel, Keren Atzlan and Jonathan Isaacs with Reserve Real Estate had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$10 million\nfor a 6,750-square-foot house of worship at 726 40th Street in Sunset Park. Christian Heritage Ministries sold the property to Royal Builders.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$16.8 million\nfor a 7,190-square-foot condominium unit at 1355 1st Avenue in Lenox Hill. Its last sale price was\n$20.7 million\nin August 2015. Stacey Alvarez of the Sukenik Glazer Team at Compass has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 47,717-square-foot, 70-unit project at 2660 Kingsbridge Terrace in University Heights. Leandro Dickson filed the permit on behalf of the Vaja Group.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

Rhodes paid $3 million for the one-story building and the parking lot in 2014.\nThe portfolio had been on the market since 2022 when Rhodes listed the properties for a combined\n$28 million\n. The latest sale closed slightly below the original asking price, but it reflects the staying power of Wynwood\u2019s investment appeal.\nA flurry of recent deals in Wynwood underscores the neighborhood\u2019s draw for big investors.\nGWealth bought the upper two floors of the three-story Wynwood Sky Office Building at 1900 Northeast Miami Court for\n$23.5 million\nlast year. The same brokers in that transaction worked the latest deal.\nBillionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin teamed up with Goldman Properties this month to acquire 545 Wyn, an office building at 545 Northwest 26th Street developed by Chicago-based Sterling Bay, for more than\n$180 million\n.

An analysis by\nThe Real Deal\nfound $77 million in purchases by Brenneman tied to the 13 properties across several different counties and two states. Prior to the purchase, the company owned 28 million of industrial space across the Midwest, the release stated.\nBrennan took out a $59 million loan from Bank of America to fund the portfolio purchase, records show.\nAlmost all of the properties were sold by New York-based InvestCorp, which had assembled 11 of the buildings for a combined $48 million in 2019. The total price of the 11 properties that InvestCorp sold to Brennan totaled $64 million,\nTRD\n\u2019s analysis of public records found.\nSan Francisco-based Farallon Capital Management sold the two Milwaukee properties in the portfolio to Brennan for $13 million.\nBrennan previously partnered with Investcorp on deals in the area, including in a venture that sold an industrial property in\nElk Grove Village\nin 2024 for $37 million to data center developer EdgeConnex, and Brennan also snagged a $63 million loan to refinance an industrial property near\nO\u2019Hare International Airport\nlast year that likely let it buy out Investcorp\u2019s interest in the property.\nThe properties in the recently sold portfolio are:\n1890 Suncast Road, Batavia\n951 North Raddant Road, Batavia\n401-431 Raddant Road, Batavia\n2435 Curtiss Street, Downers Grove\n10321 Werch Street, Woodridge\n2 Territorial Court, Bolingbrook\n552 Taylor Road, Romeoville\n1070 Northpoint Boulevard, Waukegan\n65 Ambrogio Drive, Gurnee\n407-409 Washington, Mundelein\n401 Terrace Drive, Mundelein\n8301 Parkland, Milwaukee\n130 West Edgerton, Milwaukee\nThe transaction is a sign of confidence from industrial specialist Brennan in the Midwest market. The sector went through\na building boom\nduring and just after the pandemic that has since slowed.\nBut lease absorption rates in the Chicago area show that even as new properties hit the market, sellers and landlords are finding demand.\nNet\nabsorption improved significantly\nin 2025, according to a year-end report from Savills. In 2024, about 400,000 more square feet of industrial space was leased than vacated. In the last quarter of 2025, that figure jumped up to 7.3 million square feet.\nJust last week,\nThor Equities cashed out of an industrial spec development\nin suburban Chicago.\u00a0 The New York-based developer sold its 109,000-square-foot industrial building to Irvine, California-based LBA Logistics for $21.4 million in a deal recorded on Friday, public documents show.\nIn the last quarter of 2022 alone, nearly 40 million square feet of industrial space was under construction in the Chicago area, far more than today, Savills found. Now, the pipeline is showing signs of stabilizing. During the last quarter of 2025, about 13 million square feet of industrial properties was under construction in the Chicago area. Much of that activity was driven by a boost in\ndata center development\n, according to Savills.",

People living at 347 Eddy Street, 1029 Geary Street and five other properties were hit with the eviction notices.\nIn 2023, Mosser Companies\ndefaulted on the loan\nit used to buy the buildings, leading to a receiver being appointed to manage the properties during foreclosure proceedings. As part of the new ownership arrangement, tenants \u2014 largely non-English speakers \u2014 were allegedly unknowingly required to switch from paper checks for rent payments to an online portal. They reportedly continued to pay rent by check, and one tenant claimed that their payments had been cashed for the months last year that the eviction lawsuit against him said he hadn\u2019t paid.\nAfter\nMosser\u2019s default\nand the receiver appointment, in 2024,\nEl Segundo\n-based TerraCotta Multi bought the loan on the portfolio for about $61 million. A spokesperson for TerraCotta Multi told the Chronicle the company is \u201ccommitted to working with\u202four\u202ftenants\u202fto find solutions and keep people in their homes wherever possible\u201d and noted that the company did not take official ownership of the properties until Nov. 20 of last year, approximately two months after the evictions lawsuits were filed.\n\u201cWe have successfully reached\u202fresolutions with several tenants\u202fin recent\u202fmonths,\u202fand we are in active discussions with a number of tenants currently,\u201d the spokesperson said, urging tenants who receive a notice for nonpayment or believe there is an error in their payment history to contact their property manager.\nTerraCotta and Mosser are currently involved in litigation over tenant security deposits that have seemingly disappeared. TerraCotta said in court filings that the security deposits from tenants in 12 formerly\nMosser\n-owned properties, including 347 Eddy Street, should total $578,676, but Mosser\u2019s accounts dedicated to the funds only showed a total of $2,120 in deposits. TerraCotta also claims that the amount of rent the receiver was collecting \u201ccannot be reconciled with the financial records and rent rolls provided to TerraCotta, such that it is unclear if rental income is being withheld from TerraCotta.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The change marks the steepest drop in office availability in four consecutive quarters of decline in availability.\nCompanies leased upwards of 1 million more square feet than they vacated in the fourth quarter, representing the largest such instance of positive absorption since 2018, per CBRE data cited by the Business Times.

AI startup\nSierra inked the largest lease deal\nof the year in San Francisco, 300,000 square feet at 185 Berry Street in China Basin. AI-focused companies account for about 2.8 million square feet of the approximately 8 million square feet of offices that firms are currently searching for in San Francisco, according to CBRE data cited by the Business Times.\nWhile office occupancy in San Francisco is trending in a positive direction, the city still has a long road to complete recovery. About 24 percent of office space in San Francisco is empty or available for lease \u2014 the highest share in the U.S. and roughly three times the availability rate in the city in 2019, per CoStar.\nDemand for office space from AI companies\nis expected to continue driving down office availability in the coming years. AI entities are predicted to take up as much as 21 million square feet of offices in San Francisco by 2030,\nCBRE said last year\n. Company headcounts are also expected to grow, with the hiring frenzy expected to bring between 50,000 and 60,000 new jobs to the city by the turn of the next decade.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Crow Holdings is doubling down on Dallas as a data center powerhouse, unveiling plans for a 245-megawatt campus on a long-vacant, urban infill site along the Stemmons Corridor.\nThe Dallas-based real estate investment and development\nfirm\nsaid it will construct the multi-building project with CleanArc Data Centers, starting with a 70-megawatt facility slated for completion in late 2027, according to a news release from the company.\u00a0 The campus will rise on roughly 40 acres that Crow has owned for decades, northwest of the City Center District.\nThe site sits near the Infomart hub of data centers at 1950 Stemmons Freeway, DataBank\u2019s interconnection hub, as well as another major interconnection hub in the Univision building at 2323 Bryan Street. That proximity aims to give the project very low latency \u2014 or the time delay between when information is sent and when it is received \u2014 a key selling point for users reliant on cloud computing networks and AI, according to the release. The Infomart was built in the 1980s, developed by the\nTrammell Crow\nCompany, and originally spanned 1.6 million square feet.\nCrow\nand\nCleanArc\nare pitching the project as a rare\nDallas\ninfill opportunity, combining secured power, a dedicated on-site substation and flexible building configurations. The full buildout could reach 245 megawatts, with the initial 70-megawatt building already in design and the equipment procurement process underway.\nCleanArc, founded by data center veteran James Trout, will handle development and leasing. The firm is currently constructing close to 1 gigawatt of capacity in\nVirginia\nand its leadership team has worked on more than 2 gigawatts of mission-critical facilities, according to the firm.\nThe project marks a significant step in its broader digital infrastructure push for\nCrow Holdings\n, as the firm said it is evaluating more than 3 gigawatts of potential data center capacity nationwide, with prospective projects in markets including New Jersey, Georgia and North Carolina.\nDemand for data centers across Dallas-Fort Worth was up significantly in 2025, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield, accounting for 21 percent of new demand in warehouse and distribution properties in the market. As previously reported in\nThe Real Deal\n, a CBRE report projects data center inventory in the metroplex will more than double by the end of 2026.\nProjects in the pipeline include an $880 million investment in a new facility at Google\u2019s existing Midlothian campus, and the first \u201cProject Stargate\u201d campus \u2014 a $400 billion joint venture between Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank \u2014 that opened in Abilene in 2025.\n",

        "content": "Fannie Mae\u2019s holiday gift to\nJon Venetos\nwas a series of lawsuits attempting to foreclose on five of the remaining properties in his crumbling multifamily portfolio.\nThe government-sponsored lender accused Venetos\u2019 Dallas-based firm, Lurin Capital, of defaulting on $59.4 million tied to five Pensacola, Florida properties. Fannie Mae filed the five suits in Escambia County Circuit Court on Dec. 8.\nThe properties in question are:\nLorient Apartments, at 110 Creekside Court;\nOverlook Apartments, at 1200 Scenic Highway;\nPapillon Apartments, at 7270 Hilburn Road;\nAscend at Pensacola Bay Apartments, at 800 Scenic Highway; and\nPalmiere Apartments, at 4435 Marlane Drive.\nLurin borrowed nearly $60 million in January 2024 and stopped making payments in October 2025, Fannie Mae claims. The lender also accuses Lurin of neglecting the properties and allowing liens to pile up against them.\nFannie Mae is asking the court to foreclose on the properties and demand payment of the unpaid principal on the loans, interest and attorneys\u2019 fees. It also asked the court to appoint a receiver to manage the properties but withdrew the requests on Dec. 23. The filing does not specify a reason.\nThe suits mark the second state in which Fannie Mae has sued Lurin Capital. It claimed in a Nov. 6 Texas District Court filing that\nLurin Capital defaulted on a $77.2 million loan\ntied to Latitude 2976, a 734-unit Houston apartment complex at 201 and 301 Wilcrest Drive.\nThe bottom has fallen out for Lurin Capital, whose multifamily properties have mostly been lost to foreclosure or are in receivership.\nDistress ramped up for Venetos\u2019 firm in the spring, when Acore Capital Mortgage accused Lurin of defaulting on nearly $400 million in loans tied to 12 properties in Florida. In a series of October lawsuits, Acore claimed that Venetos personally guaranteed the money he borrowed from the lender and\nstill owes $81 million\n.\nVista Bank\nand\nKeybank\nalso filed lawsuits claiming defaults. Their claims include fraud. Keybank alleged Venetos transferred $24,570 from his accounts with the bank to a personal account. Vista accused him of falsifying account statements from the lender in an attempt to take out loans elsewhere. Former employees have also come out to accuse Lurin of lying on loan reimbursement requests to lenders by inflating costs of repairs and submitting invoices for work that wasn\u2019t done.\nCities are also suing the firm over conditions at the properties it still controls.\nIn November, the firm was hit with a\ntemporary restraining order\nthat ordered residents of a Lurin-owned property in Plano to vacate due to unsafe conditions, including lack of access to water, sewer or gas.\nLurin was\nsued by the city of Huntsville\n, Alabama on Jan. 2.\u00a0 The city claims Lurin has abandoned The Flats at Redstone, a 231-unit property at 2022 Golf Road, and that the state of the building \u201cposes a substantial risk of illness or injury to anyone who enters the property,\u201d\nThe lawsuits are still pending.\n",

BH is the latest developer to make a play for the waterfront property after prior bids failed.\nAging condos across South Florida face mounting repair costs and tougher reserve rules in the wake of the Champlain Towers South collapse, making buyouts tempting for sellers.\nBuilt in the late 1960s, The Mutiny is a Miami landmark infamous for its run between the 1970s and 1980s as a celebrity and\ndrug kingpin\nhangout before falling into disrepair and closing down. It reopened as a condo-hotel in 1998, featuring units ranging from under 600 square feet to a 3,300-square-foot penthouse, with many condo and hotel units having views of Biscayne Bay.\nBH\u2019s offer matched a previous offer by New York-based Slate Property Group last year, and the proceeds would be allocated by each owner\u2019s pro-rata share. Miami-based DaGrosa Capital made an undisclosed offer that fell through in 2024.\nBH\u2019s Isaac Toledano did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe firm is among the most active buyers of potential South Florida development sites. BH teamed up with Mast Capital in targeting another Coconut Grove condominium last year. The joint venture paid\n$20 million\nfor more than 75 percent of units at the 39-unit Bayshore Park, at 2545 South Bayshore Drive in Miami.\nMore recently, BH got into a legal tussle with developer\nGlenn Straub\nto force the sale of a shuttered golf course in Wellington. In a still pending lawsuit filed in Palm Beach County in December, BH alleged it was ready to close on the\n$21 million\ndeal for the 150.5-acre site when Straub allegedly backed out.\n\u2013 Francisco Alvarado",

Cerritos-based McDonald Packaging sold the building for $31.8 million, or $260 per square foot, according to CoStar records cited by the Business Journal. CBRE\u2019s Chip Wright and Ross Fippinger brokered the deal.\nThe structure was reported to be empty at the time of the sale. The purchase marks WareSpace\u2019s first venture in California; the Columbia, Maryland-based warehouse provider has 13 locations nationwide with 10 more in the works.\nWareSpace plans to renovate the 45-year-old\nSanta Ana\nwarehouse and look to bring in smaller local businesses as tenants. The new owner expects about 110 small businesses to move into the facility. Spaces will range between 200 and 2,000 square feet with leases ranging from six to 12 months secured with \u201cone simple monthly payment instead of complex triple-net leases,\u201d the company said.\n\u201cUnlike traditional industrial buildings that cater to large tenants, these are right-sized warehouses for Orange County entrepreneurs and small business \u2014 offering features typically reserved for larger facilities: loading docks, drive-in access, climate control and shared conference rooms,\u201d WareSpace said, according to the Business Journal.

        "content": "Developer Mikael Hamaoui teamed up with one of the biggest exotic car dealers in the country to launch an automotive concierge program at his planned Pagani Residences.\nPrestige Imports, led by CEO Brett David, will launch its Auto Privata service at the hypercar-branded project when it is completed, according to a news release.\nPrestige will train the condo\u2019s valet staff, provide monthly vehicle condition reports and service scheduling. Residents will be able to buy memberships and a la carte services to maintain their car collections, including \u201cdiscreet\u201d vehicle delivery to \u201cprivate airports, social events, or restaurants,\u201d according to the release.\nPrestige is based in North Miami Beach and was founded in 1977 by David\u2019s late father, Irv David. It is one of the largest dealerships for luxury, exotic and supercars in North America and one of three licensed Pagani dealers in the country.\nHamaoui\u2019s Riviera Horizons\nlaunched sales\nof the 28-story, 70-unit Pagani Residences slated for 7940 West Drive in North Bay Village in 2024. Prices start at $3.7 million, and construction is expected to finish in 2028.\nIt is one of a growing number of luxury condo projects boasting luxury vehicle brands, including Gil Dezer\u2019s\nPorsche Design Tower\nand his planned\nBentley Residences\n. Also in the development pipeline are Michael Stern\u2019s\nMercedes-Benz Places\nproject and\nRelated Group\u2019s Pininfarina-designed condo development\n.\nWhile some car-branded projects offer car-centric amenities \u2013\u2013 Dezer\u2019s two projects famously include his \u201cDezervator\u201d to transport vehicles to units \u2013\u2013 David said others don\u2019t offer much more than the name.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much to it,\u201d he said.\nThe Auto Privata service joins a fierce amenities arms race in South Florida condo development. In a sea of projects, developers compete to stand out with flashy benefits like theaters, golf simulators,\nprivate dining rooms\n,\nguest suites\nand\nconcierge medical services\nto woo buyers.\nHamaoui said he wanted to prioritize practicality.\n\u201cYou have to pick and choose which amenities are going to be most meaningful,\u201d he said, noting that many amenities can \u201cjust collect dust once the project is delivered.\u201d\nThe draw of branded residences for many South Florida buyers is the services they provide, and Hamaoui heard from a growing number of car collectors worried about tracking down these kinds of services in Miami.\nThe market for collectible cars has exploded in recent years, along with nearly every luxury goods category.\n\u201cCars have now turned into a blue chip stock,\u201d David said.\nMiami has emerged as a new capital of car culture in the U.S., as host to F1\u2019s Miami Grand Prix. With more collectors in need of luxury vehicle storage, real estate developers are building garages and clubs for the region\u2019s gearheads.In Miami\u2019s Little River, Harvey Hernandez\u2019s Newgard Development Group is planning\nRevault Miami\n, a luxury car condo that will fit up to nine cars in each of its 16 units. Mark S. Gold, founder of The Ticket Clinic, is planning\na 26-unit car condo\nin Pembroke Pines. Scott Cunningham\u2019s Hangar Group has planned\na 68-unit car condo\nin West Palm Beach, after selling out his first in Riviera Beach.",

Western Digital has a long-term lease in both buildings, though details around the lease terms and whether it plans to relocate in the future were not disclosed.\nMorgan Stanley Investment Management bought the Osgood Road site using funds managed by Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investing. Morgan Stanley Investment Management was attracted to the facility\u2019s high-power capacity compared with other properties in the market as it continues \u201cinvesting in high-quality research and development assets in core innovation corridors, where demand is driven by superior infrastructure and access to top talent, and where supply remains constrained,\u201d Will Milam, head of U.S. investments at Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investing, said in a\nstatement\n.\nOther Fremont industrial properties came under new ownership this month.\nLast week, Prologis\nsold\na 26-acre industrial redevelopment site at 41777 Boyce Road\nfor $70.1 million\n, the Mercury News reported. The buyer was a group affiliated with a Chicago-based real estate firm operating as CDECRE LLC.

In August 2023, Prologis bought a 246,000-square-foot industrial and research building at\n48350 Fremont Boulevard\nfrom Blackstone for $86.6 million.\nEarlier this month,\nTishman Speyer bought\nthe 250,000-square-foot Christy Street Industrial Center in Fremont for more than $92.9 million. An affiliate of Blackrock sold the one-story structure at 42701 and 42735 Christy Street.\nMore than 40 percent of industrial demand in the Bay Area is concentrated in Fremont, per CBRE data cited by the Business Journal.

An entity run by Christina K. Wong, president of Asian food provider Golden Star Trading,\nacquired\nthe asset, Commercial Observer reported.\nThe buyer secured a $91 million loan from\nMadison Realty Capital\nfor the acquisition.\nClothing company Next Level Apparel leases the entire property, which contains approximately 15,000 square feet of offices.\nThe Klabin Company\u2019s Tyler Rollema and Matt Stringfellow\nrepresented the buyer in the sale.\nThe building fetched a higher-than-usual $463 per-square-foot price. The average sale price for industrial facilities in Los Angeles County was $385 per square foot in the fourth quarter, according to Kidder Mathews data cited by the Business Journal. \u201cMy client admittedly paid a premium for the opportunity to buy a building of this class and size in a premier location,\u201d Rollema said.\nLink Logistics\u2019 Crenshaw Boulevard sale is the latest industrial transaction in Torrance in less than a month.

The South Bay submarket\u2019s vacancy rate was 5.7 percent, while Torrance\u2019s was 8.4 percent, according to Colliers data cited by the Business Journal.

California-based KBS\nowns\nthe 2009-built property, and Savills had the listing.\nThe deal appears to be an expansion for ByteDance, which leased 125,000 square feet of the 32-story 300 Colorado Street in Downtown Austin in early 2022, Chron\nreported\nat the time. It later\noffered the space up on the sublease market\nand then relented,\npulling the listing a few months later\n. State filings show ByteDance switched gears and planned a $29 million renovation of the space, a three-phased project that was slated to be completed in early 2025.\nTikTok\u2019s\nAustin office space\nsaga coincided with the federal government\u2019s ongoing attempts to ban the social media platform. After President Donald Trump ordered ByteDance to divest from the app in his first term, the Biden administration reversed the order. Then Congress passed a law that set a deadline for ByteDance to sell the app. Trump started his second term with an extension; the parties reached a deal in the fall to spin off the app\u2019s U.S. operations to a group controlled by investors, including Larry Ellison\u2019s Oracle.\nIndeed, on the other hand, is a victim of the rapid boom and bust of tech in Austin that took place between 2020 and 2023. The company was saddled with nearly 800,000 square feet of Austin office space spread across three high-profile buildings, chunks of which have been languishing on the sublease market since the summer of 2023.\nEven so, tech is expected to play a major role in the Austin office market in 2026, JLL said in its fourth-quarter report.\nTech companies accounted for the three largest leases of the quarter, which posted a positive office absorption of 23,700 square feet.\nVMware renewed its lease\nfor nearly 135,000 square feet at River Place; TikTok\u2019s sublease at Domain Gateway ranked second; and\nNvidia\nrenewed its 79,000-square-foot lease at The Crossing at Lakeline.\nTech companies make up nearly a third of tenants for pre-leased projects in the pipeline, according to JLL.\n",

The problem: The listing wasn\u2019t real.\nThe J.J. Walser House, a deteriorating Wright-designed landmark on Central Avenue in the Austin neighborhood, popped up on Zillow priced at $350,000, drawing quick attention from preservationists, neighbors and the real estate-curious. But the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy and a local nonprofit working to save the home say the listing was illegitimate,\naccording\nto Crain\u2019s.\n\u201cThis shows why we need to protect a vulnerable property like this,\u201d conservancy executive director\nBarbara Gordon\ntold the outlet. With ownership tied up in a prolonged\nforeclosure\nprocess, she said, \u201csomebody found a hole\u201d and appears to be trying to exploit it.\nFannie Mae, which took ownership of the property after a December foreclosure auction, confirmed the groups\u2019 findings through a spokesperson, adding that steps were being taken to remove the unauthorized listing. The agency said it is clearing debris and preparing the home for an eventual legitimate sale, though no timeline has been announced, according to the publication.\nThe mystery listing appeared only on Zillow and its sister site Trulia, not on Redfin, Realtor.com or Homes.com. The seller\u2019s contact information led to a dead end voicemail and unanswered emails, and Zillow did not immediately respond to questions about how the for-sale-by-owner listing was approved.\nThe $350,000 asking price raised eyebrows from the start. In December, two would-be buyers \u2014\nAustin Coming Together\n, a nonprofit based across the street, and investor Andy Schcolnik \u2014 declined to meet the lender PHH Mortgage\u2019s minimum bid of $240,000, citing the home\u2019s extreme disrepair. At the time, Austin Coming Together estimated the property was appraised at roughly $65,000 and would require about $2 million in rehabilitation.\nThe price also sat near Austin\u2019s median single-family home value of $362,500, according to Redfin \u2014 a mismatch for a structure with a collapsing roof, rotting windows and extensive interior damage.\nBuilt in 1903, the Walser House is one of just seven\nPrairie-period Wright homes\nstill standing in Chicago and is a designated city landmark. Preservationists have warned for years that deferred maintenance threatens its survival. The home fell into foreclosure after its longtime owner, Anne Teague, who had taken out a reverse mortgage, died in 2019.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "PSAI Realty Partners\njust made the priciest office purchase in Mountain View in five years.\nThe San Francisco-based firm\nbought the five-building Mountain View Corporate Center\nfrom private real estate investor\nRockwood Capital\nfor $193 million, the Silicon Valley Business Journal reported. Rockwood listed the property for sale in September.\nThe transaction for the property at 331 East Evelyn Avenue is the biggest in Mountain View since values began falling in 2021. It\u2019s the first office sale in Mountain View to surpass $150 million in three years, outdoing past deals including DivcoWest\u2019s $108.1 million\npurchase\nof 600 Clyde Avenue in 2024.\nMountain View Corporate Center spans 289,000 square feet on a 16-acre site. The office complex is fully leased to tenants like Databricks, Atlassian and Heartflow. Databricks, the largest tenant at the campus with 47,000 square feet, is expected to leave Mountain View Corporate Center, according to the Business Journal. The firm has been in expansion mode across Silicon Valley, most recently\nleasing an additional three floors\nof offices in Sunnyvale last month.\nApproximately 20 institutional investors, consisting mostly of private equity firms, were interested in buying the offices, sources familiar with the deal told the Business Journal. It appears that investors are confident in the comeback of the Silicon Valley office market after pandemic lows and the\ninflux of artificial intelligence firms\nsetting up shop in the South Bay.\nMountain View has more than 12 million square feet of office space available for rent, according to fourth-quarter data from CBRE cited by the Business Journal.\nTech workers who live in Mountain View might have the hardest time making ends meet, as the city is now the priciest in Silicon Valley for renters. Rents have\nclimbed past pre-pandemic highs\n, with some new luxury one-bedrooms fetching approximately $5.75 per square foot, up from a previous peak of $5.50 per square foot.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The firm also pointed to\nclimate policies under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration\n.

The company raised $124 million for the fund last year, a quarter of its goal, according to an SEC filing last month.\nIn the past, Fifth Wall\u2019s funds brought in plenty of cash. It has closed an $866 million proptech fund, a $500 million climate fund \u2014 its first in the sector \u2014 and a $159 million fund pointed at Europe. Real estate firms once made up 65 percent of Fifth Wall\u2019s limited partners as it enjoyed low interest rates and government support for climate initiatives.\nBut rising interest rates and reportedly questionable decisions that rankled LPs caused difficulties for the firm.\nFifth Wall has $600 million in dry powder at its disposal today.

        "content": "Fulton Street Companies is doubling down on its bid to turn\nChicago\u2019s Fulton Market\ninto a high-end shopping destination, tapping veteran broker Francis X. Scire as its new head of retail leasing.\nThe appointment comes as the former meatpacking district \u2014 already a magnet for top-tier office tenants and high-end residential development \u2014 begins to attract a new breed of retailer. While the neighborhood has mastered the restaurant scene, renowned apparel brands are now scouting the cobblestone streets, and landlords are scrambling to position their portfolios to capture the influx.\nScire will oversee leasing for Fulton Street\u2019s entire Fulton Market portfolio, including the retail portion of the 409,000-square-foot office building under construction at 919 West Fulton Street, according to a press release. That development, anchored by Harrison Street Real Estate, has already secured leases with Gibsons Steakhouse and Equinox.\nHis arrival marks a calculated shift in strategy for Fulton Street. The firm last year\ntoyed with a significant exit\n, hiring Newmark to test the market for a sale of its retail properties. But with no deal struck, the firm opted to hold, carrying its mortgage debt forward. The developer, which partnered with Chicago retail tycoon Fred Latsko on its retail properties, is now betting that a Scire-led leasing spree will drive further appreciation, effectively raising its bet on the neighborhood\u2019s long-term value.\nScire brings a track record of high-profile leasing to the role. Most recently, he led leasing for\nNora West Palm Beach\nin South Florida, the adaptive reuse district by NDT Development, Place Projects and Wheelock Street Capital. The project has become a magnet for New York exports, inking leases with buzzy tenants like Pastis, Le Labo, Warby Parker and Van Leeuwen.\nHis r\u00e9sum\u00e9 also includes a stint at\nWS Development\n, where he spearheaded the revitalization of the Royal Poinciana Plaza in Palm Beach. During his tenure, Scire was instrumental in curating a luxury lineup that brought heavyweights Herm\u00e8s and Cartier to the shopping center \u2014 a retailer caliber Fulton Street may be eyeing for Fulton Market.\n\u201cWe\u2019re focused on creating spaces that not only attract the world\u2019s most coveted brands but also foster a sense of community,\u201d Alex Nejem, CEO of Fulton Street, said in a statement.\n",

CoStar\nreported\nthat Heitman closed its Value Partners Fund VI with $2 billion in equity commitments, exceeding its $1.75 billion goal.\nInvestors also pledged another $620 million in co-investment capital, bringing total commitments to $2.6 billion.

The fund is targeting returns of 12 percent to 14 percent.\nHeitman now has $48 billion in assets under management, and has raised and utilized five value-add funds since 2004, according to the outlet.\nHeitman said it has already put nearly half the capital to work. The firm has committed $847 million, or about 42 percent of equity commitments, across 12 investments so far, a spokesperson told the publication. While specific deals weren\u2019t identified, the investments span medical office, student housing, multifamily, industrial, cold storage, industrial outdoor storage and self-storage.\nThe fund puts Heitman alongside a growing list of global managers showing fundraising momentum despite higher borrowing costs, tariff uncertainty and a slower market.\nBrookfield\nrecently announced a record $30 billion haul, while Carlyle Group closed a $9 billion real estate fund and Bain Capital raised $3.4 billion. Closer to home, fellow Chicago firm Mesirow said last year it secured more than $1.2 billion for multifamily strategies.\nHeitman said the new fund will balance less cyclical property types with more traditional growth potential in\napartments and warehouses\n.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "America\u2019s largest homebuilder saw its profits drop in the first quarter.\nD.R. Horton posted lower first quarter earnings, as high mortgage rates and jittery consumers forced the company to lean harder on sales incentives, pressuring margins even as it beat Wall Street\u2019s earnings expectations.\nThe Arlington, Texas-based\nbuilder\nreported net income of $594.8 million, or $2.03 per share, down from $844.9 million, or $2.61 per share, a year earlier,\naccording\nto the Wall Street Journal. Revenue fell to $6.9 billion from $7.6 billion, though both figures topped analyst estimates. Closings dropped 7 percent, year-over-year, to 17,818 homes, while the average closing price slid 3 percent to $365,500.\nExecutives pointed squarely at\naffordability\n. Executive Chairman David Auld said \u201caffordability constraints and cautious consumer sentiment\u201d continue to weigh on demand, a dynamic that pushed incentives higher as the quarter progressed. Those incentives, often in the form of mortgage rate buydowns, are now expected to remain elevated into fiscal 2026.\nCEO Paul Romanowski said on the earnings call that incentive levels in December suggest gross margins will decline again in the second quarter. D.R. Horton offered guidance of a home sales gross margin of 19 percent to 19.5 percent, below what analysts had expected.\nThere are glimmers of relief. Mortgage rates have drifted lower in recent weeks, and Romanowski said sales offices are seeing a pickup in traffic. If rates stay compressed, the cost of incentives could ease.

        "content": "Donald Trump commuted the federal prison sentence of a Brooklyn real estate developer convicted in a sweeping mortgage fraud scheme that\nfueled\na $50 million buying spree across Hartford\u2019s multifamily market.\nJacob Deutsch, who was sentenced to five years behind bars, saw his prison term, fine and related penalties wiped away by a grant of executive clemency signed last week, the Hartford Courant\nreported\n. Trump offered no explanation for the decision.\nThe case centered on a yearslong effort by Deutsch and his cousin, Aron Deutsch, to amass dozens of apartment buildings using falsified financial records.\nFederal prosecutors said the cousins acquired 17 multifamily properties across Hartford between 2016 and 2021, leaning on hundreds of forged documents to secure 24 separate mortgages from lenders that included four banks and secondary market players such as Fannie Mae. The portfolio stretched from Washington Street south of downtown through the West End and into Asylum Hill.\nJacob Deutsch was accused of masterminding an elaborate web of fake rent rolls, leases, utility bills and bank records to inflate occupancy and income at multiple properties. One focal point was a 24-unit complex at 16 Evergreen Avenue, which prosecutors said was completely vacant when Deutsch represented it as fully leased at above-market rents.\nTo sell the story, Deutsch admitted to inventing tenants, forging signatures on leases and staging empty apartments with furniture and clothing before lender inspections. When lenders pushed for more proof, prosecutors said he supplied doctored electric and gas bills and fabricated bank deposits showing rental income that didn\u2019t exist.\nAron Deutsch, based in Monsey, New York, avoided prison but was fined $1 million and placed on probation for five years \u2014 penalties wiped away by the clemency. Prosecutors said he helped purchase cashier\u2019s checks used to back up the fake banking records.\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s office described the scheme as shifting \u201cthe risk of catastrophic loss\u201d onto lenders and the mortgage-backed securities market. The conspiracy began to unravel after federal housing officials flagged the Evergreen Avenue loan file as \u201cwildly false.\u201d\nDespite the scope of the fraud, the case landed awkwardly in a stable Hartford market. Prosecutors acknowledged that rising property values and steady rents limited losses, though they pegged lender damages at roughly $3.5 million. Defense attorneys argued the properties were ultimately sold at break-even prices.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "David Martin and the Frisbie Group\u2019s massive One Boca project will head to voters on March 10 after years of community backlash and wrangling at city hall.\nMartin\u2019s Miami-based Terra company and Palm Beach-based Frisbie won approval from the Boca Raton City Council this week, leaving their 1.1-million-square-foot mixed use project and public land lease to the fate of a voter referendum.\nThe referendum is required to finalize a master planned partnership agreement between the city and developers, which includes a 99-year lease for 7.8-acres of city-owned land between West Palmetto Park Road, Northwest First Avenue, Northwest Second Avenue, the city\u2019s library and Brightline\u2019s Boca Raton Station.\nIf voters approve it, One Boca will consist of 947 residential units, 180 hotel rooms, 120,000 square feet of office, a 30,000-square-foot grocery store and 2,100 parking spaces under current plans, though those dimensions could be subject to change.\nThe pending agreement allows for the possibility of Terra and Frisbie to improve the adjacent 17-acre Memorial Park and build a new city hall and community center for Boca Raton.\nOne Boca still has plenty of critics. Save Boca, a grassroots organization, clamored for a referendum for any new city land deals.\nCouncil Member Andy Thomson, the lone dissenting vote, said One Boca is still too large and may end up costing the city more in revenue than it would receive from any future rent proceeds outlined in the proposed lease.\nThe council\u2019s four other members said One Boca will be as much of an economic boon for the city as Mizner Park, a shopping district with condos and apartments that replaced Boca Mall in 1991.\nOne hundred and eighty two of the residential units would be condos, built on a 12,000-square-foot parcel at 141 Northwest Fourth Street that Terra and Frisbie are contracted to buy from Boca Color Graphics.\nThe rest will be 688 market rate apartments and 77 workforce apartments slated to be built near the Boca Raton Police Department, after a new police headquarters is built in the city\u2019s Spanish River area.\nThe ground lease has an estimated value of $228 million, based on percentages the city would charge the developers. CBRE and PFM have estimated that could amount to $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion over the 99-year term when adjusting for inflation.\nThe developers committed to contributing $46 million to new utilities and road improvements.\nTerra and Frisbie would receive a 3.3 percent fee from the city to build $201 million in capital improvements, including the city hall, community center and Memorial Park improvements, plus a police substation and a $30 million, 600-space parking garage near the site of a future grocery and office development by the Brightline station.\nFinal designs haven\u2019t been presented, and each element will require city approval.\nCouncil members will vote next month on plan amendments that allow intensive mixed-use transit-oriented development in Boca Raton\u2019s downtown.\nTerra and Frisbie\nbeat\nthree other development teams last February, including Related Ross, for the right to redevelop 30-acres of city-owned land, including Memorial Park.\nIts initial proposal, designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox, was about 2.5 million square feet with nearly 1,130 apartments, 150 hotel rooms, 157,000 square feet of retail and just over 3,400 parking spaces.\nLater iterations were scaled back, but the project still\nstirred backlash\nand inspired organizers to collect thousands of signatures to push for the requirement of a public vote prior to selling or leasing city parcels larger than half an acre. That move was ultimately\nblocked by a judge\nfrom appearing on a ballot in January.\nNevertheless, Frisbie and city officials agreed to allow voters to have the final say on One Boca in a\npublic referendum\non March 10, the same day\nvoters pick their city\u2019s next mayor\nand council members.",

        "content": "Another tenant at downtown Houston\u2019s newest office tower is planning to put real money into the space.\nThird Coast Infrastructure is preparing to launch a buildout of its new headquarters at the Norton Rose Fulbright Tower, a project expected to cost at least $2.8 million, according to a recent filing with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. The Houston Business Journal\nreported\nthat the Houston-based energy infrastructure firm plans to relocate into a 20,800-square-foot space on the 15th floor of the 28-story building at 1550 Lamar Street.\nThe filing shows the buildout will affect roughly 16,249 square feet and is expected to wrap by the end of the year. Houston-based\nTramonte Design Studio\nis listed as the project\u2019s designer, though no general contractor has been named.\nThe move was first announced in October, when New York-based\nSkanska USA Commercial Development\n\u2014 the tower\u2019s owner and developer, the U.S. subsidiary of the Swedish construction company \u2014 revealed Third Coast as the building\u2019s fourth tenant. The company is relocating from Hess Tower at 1501 McKinney Street, upgrading into a trophy tower that has become one of the few bright spots in a still-uneven Downtown Houston office market.\nSkanska pitched the lease as a sign of Third Coast\u2019s growth and its long-term commitment to Houston. Third Coast President and CEO Matt Rowland said at the time that the company was drawn to the building\u2019s technology infrastructure, meeting spaces and amenities, calling it a \u201cmodern, world-class environment\u201d for employees and clients.\nThird Coast\noperates offshore projects across the Gulf Coast, including natural gas and liquids pipelines, processing plants and a deepwater floating production system \u2014 a business profile that still supports demand for high-quality office space, even as many energy firms shrink their workspace.\nThe buildout plan follows another leasing win for\nSkanska at the tower\n. Norton Rose Fulbright, the international law firm that anchors the building and gives it its name, recently expanded its presence to eight full floors, or about 139,000 square feet. The firm originally signed a 15-year lease before construction began in 2021 and moved in last year.\nWith that expansion, plus leases signed by Boston Consulting Group and litigation boutique Hicks Johnson, the tower is now about 70 percent leased, Skanska said. Ground-floor retail has also come online, including Hugo Ortega\u2019s Zaranda restaurant and Tenfold Coffee.\nAltogether, the Norton Rose Fulbright Tower totals 375,000 square feet of office space and 7,000 square feet of retail.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The SEC letter signals that the agency does not intend to recommend enforcement action,\naccording\nto Reuters, which first reported the move.\nMegPrime marks Megatel\u2019s first foray into digital currency. CEO Zach Ipour framed it as an extension of the builder\u2019s broader housing ecosystem rather than a speculative move. The token will be marketed strictly as a payment and rewards tool, not as an investment, the company said.\nConsumers will be able to use MegPrime through a digital wallet and payment card at regular merchants. In return, users can earn rebates paid in additional tokens, discounted gift cards and points redeemable for housing-related benefits. Token holders will not receive any ownership rights, voting power or profit participation tied to\nMegatel\n, according to the publication.\nThe initiative builds on a program\nMegatel\nlaunched in 2019 that credited renters with an amount equal to their prior year\u2019s rent to use toward a home purchase.\nIpour\ntold Reuters the company believes its scale \u2014 a\nmultibillion-dollar homebuilding and financing operation\n\u2014 gives it a chance to \u201cperfect this model\u201d by blending real estate transactions with digital currency incentives.\nTraditional companies across industries have been experimenting with blockchain-based loyalty and payments programs, according to the outlet, and the SEC under President Trump has taken a more permissive stance toward crypto, easing regulatory anxiety for firms considering similar moves.\nHomebuilders have largely stayed on the sidelines of crypto after the sector\u2019s boom-and-bust cycles, wary of volatility and regulatory risk. Megatel\u2019s approach sidesteps those issues by positioning MegPrime as a tool tied to everyday spending and housing benefits, rather than a tradable currency.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Oppenheim is correct that rent control is unsuccessful and unjust \u2014 especially in New York, where six-figure earners enjoy rent-stabilized units and homelessness is rampant. But there is a reason price controls were adopted for housing and not food.\nIt starts with the physical difference: Buildings last for decades, but food has a short shelf life. It is constantly consumed and replaced.\nTherefore, slapping rent control on certain properties (in New York City, pre-1974 buildings with six or more units) doesn\u2019t change the number of those buildings. Buildings are not used up and replaced the way food is.\nPrice controls on food would cause farmers and food manufacturers to produce less of it. Food shortages would be immediate and deadly. But rent-controlled buildings continue to house people for decades.\nRent control applied to old buildings also causes shortages: The vacancy rate of rent-stabilized housing in New York City is about 1 percent. The idea in New York was to keep old buildings affordable but exempt new ones from rent control, so developers would meet the city\u2019s need for new supply.\nThis is why price controls for housing appeals to people more than price controls for something perishable, like food. But it\u2019s still bad policy, for a host of reasons.\nOne is that buildings\nare\nperishable, in their own way. They become dated, then outdated, and eventually deteriorate, because why invest money that generates no return? Even crappy buildings fill up because the rents are low.\nIn some cases, the landlord has no money left for repairs and improvements after paying the utility bills, taxes, insurance and mortgage.\nThe result is low rent but terrible living conditions \u2014 and, ultimately, vacant units. The housing shortage gets worse.\nAnother risk of rent stabilization was that it would spread beyond pre-1974 buildings. That has happened.\nAffordable housing rents are typically subject to Rent Guidelines Board increases, which have not kept up with operating expenses. So even some post-1974 buildings are in the red and racking up violations.\nOne more consequence of rent stabilization was that it made it extremely difficult to replace old apartment buildings with larger ones. This choked off new supply, pushing up market-rate rents.\nOppenheimer\u2019s comment reminds me of a key difference between food stamps and rental vouchers.\nSNAP has been found to generate more\neconomic impact\nthan\nany other subsidy\n, because recipients put the money right back into the local economy. Yet SNAP doesn\u2019t drive up the price of groceries because food is so plentiful.\nCheap housing, however, is scarce, so rental vouchers do push up rents because they increase demand for homes. A voucher offers a chance to move out of your sister\u2019s. But it can expire before you find a place.\nSNAP won\u2019t expire before you find groceries, because, as Oppenheimer noted, we don\u2019t curb food production with price controls.\nRental vouchers are still good. They would be even better if housing were as plentiful as food.\n",

        "content": "New York\u2019s new development has historically pushed the envelope with\nhulking projects that reshape the skyline\n.\nBut in recent years, those spindly spires of glass offering hundreds of units have been replaced with squat brick or terracotta buildings that recede into the streetscape, often holding just a handful of meticulously-designed homes.\nAfter the early successes on Billionaires\u2019 Row in the mid-2010s bred copycats around the city, the tide turned on larger projects, with a number of\nnoteworthy busts\nstemming from\nlackluster buyer interest\n,\ncostly construction\nor, in some cases,\nfraud\n.\nDevelopers \u2014 and their investors \u2014 have taken note, and instead seized on the success of recent boutique projects in commanding prices that used to be reserved for the skyscrapers along 57th Street.\n\u201cThere is evidence in the market that these buildings can attract tremendous pricing, and people want to take advantage of that,\u201d said BKREA\u2019s Bob Knakal of smaller condo projects.\nThe downsizing has been driven by a lack of land and capital for large-scale projects, but also a shifting sense of what buyers want from their multimillion-dollar homes.\nFrom 2016 to 2020 in Manhattan, buildings with fewer than 40 units accounted for just 14 percent of the new units coming to the market, according to a\nThe Real Deal\nanalysis of condo offering plans filed with the New York Attorney General\u2019s Office. In the last three years, that number has jumped to 32 percent.\nThe shift comes at a time when the city is\nlosing new condo inventory rapidly\nand big-name developers have turned over to a new, more cautious and\nanalytics-driven guard\n.\nShow me the money\nEven for developers who want to go big, the pipeline of money and land to do so has increasingly run dry.\nThe juiciest slices of land on the island, around the West Village, Tribeca and Chelsea, have all been bought up and, in many cases, are also height-restricted.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just not a lot of undeveloped land on the island of Manhattan that could bring up a large-scale project,\u201d said Robin Schneiderman, managing director of Brown Harris Stevens Development Marketing Group.\nThe large projects that are underway have been prohibitively expensive for all but the most flush of risk-takers. At 625 Madison Avenue, Related Companies ponied up roughly\n$630 million\n, or over $1,000 per square foot, to buy its former office building, which it plans to tear down for what will likely become a combination of hotel, retail and condos.\nCompare that to Michael Stern\u2019s project at 111 West 57th Street on Billionaires\u2019 Row, which was built from an assemblage his firm JDS Development secured for just\n$130 million\n, or roughly $400 per square foot.\nAt the same time, the money that was floating around for these projects has become scarce \u2014 or more risk-averse \u2014 in recent years.\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of debt to do these kinds of things, but the equity piece of the puzzle is hard to find,\u201d Schneiderman said. \u201cSome of the equity world got into the debt game. They\u2019ve really changed their strategy on where they want to be in the capital stack.\u201d\nWhile the debt play has made sense for many investors as\nbanks pulled back on traditional lending\nafter the pandemic, there is also a greater unease around handing unsecured money over to flashy developers after HFZ \u2014 the developer behind notorious projects like XI on the High Line and the Belnord on the Upper East Side \u2014\nwent up in flames\nand left investors around the city holding the bag.\nOther recent high-profile projects, like\nOne Wall Street\nor\n53 West 53rd Street\n, have gone sideways simply because of an apparent lack of demand.\n\u201cWhen they look at what\u2019s happened in the past, I think that people are cautious,\u201d Schneiderman said.\nWhat buyers want\nWhile developers looking to make their mark on the city\u2019s skyline have foundered, those that have leaned into finding smaller sites around the city have found a pool of buyers willing to spend surprising amounts to live in a converted garage or former retail corner.\nA number of high-profile sales this year have happened at projects where there\u2019s no towering view of Central Park or the Empire State Building. The two oft-cited projects are at 140 Jane Street, the 15-unit project where a penthouse asking\n$88 million\nwent into contract last year, and 125 Perry Street, the seven-unit garage conversion where a buyer secured a penthouse asking\n$58 million\n.\nYiannes Einhorn, the managing principal of development firm Grid Group, which is behind a 22-unit condo at 142 West 21st Street called the Myles, said the attention to detail on smaller-scale projects is essentially unmatched.\n\u201cThere are no lemons in these projects, because every apartment is studied and carefully drawn out,\u201d Einhorn said of boutique developments. \u201cYou see these 200 [or] 300 unit projects, there\u2019s always a line that never sells.\u201d\nWhile Grid Group has long focused on smaller projects, others have taken the plunge on deals that they might not have previously.\n\u201cPre-Covid, if you asked me, would you do like a 25,000- to 30,000-square-foot conversion or would you do a 25,000- to 30,000-square-foot ground up, we\u2019re not putting a shovel in the ground,\u201d said Avdoo CEO Shlomi Avdoo. \u201cToday, we definitely see the reward at the end.\u201d\nAvdoo just launched sales at 110 Boerum Place in Cobble Hill, which is a fraction of the size of his other recent Brooklyn condos, like the 105-unit Bergen.\nBuyers in the wake of the pandemic sought privacy and comfort over views and lavish amenities like bowling alleys and pet spas. Both Avdoo and Einhorn\u2019s buildings provide parking spaces for nearly every owner to purchase, and every unit has some outdoor space.\nAfter years of watching larger buildings sit on the market as their investors rack up carrying costs, some developers are eager for projects where they can see the end in sight before even starting.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather be in a position where I have to sell 20 units to pay back the bank, let\u2019s say, then, being a 300-unit project where it takes you 200 units to pay back the bank,\u201d Einhorn said.",

        "content": "Gov. Kathy Hochul finally provided some details about her proposed revamped property tax break and carve-outs for housing projects in New York.\nAs part of her executive budget, the governor has pitched reforming the State Environmental Quality Review Act, or SEQRA, and the property tax abatement known as J-51.\nOn the former, housing projects in the city would be exempt from environmental review if:\n\u2014 They have 250 or fewer units, if located in a low-density district.\n\u2014 They have 500 or fewer units, if located in a medium- or high-density district.\nSuch projects, however, still must go through review if located in coastal flood zones, in areas zoned for industrial use or if the project has more than 50,000 square feet of nonresidential space.\nThe proposal targets smaller projects than a bill previously proposed that sought to exempt projects with up to 1,000 apartments, though that measure only applied to affordable housing.\nMeanwhile, the proposal to revamp J-51 does a few things:\n\u2014 Under the current program, the value of the tax abatement is capped at 70 percent of the cost of building renovations. These totals are limited by what the city considers a \u201creasonable\u201d price for various repairs. The governor\u2019s proposal would bring the value of the tax break up to 100 percent of that cost.\n\u2014\u00a0Condos and co-ops are eligible under the current program if units have an average assessed value of $45,000. The executive budget legislation raises that threshold to $60,000.\n\u2014\u00a0In 2023, the state authorized the city to adopt a reformed version of J-51, which turned the combo abatement and exemption program into simply an abatement that was available to a smaller pool of buildings. It took the City Council more than a year to pick up on the issue, agreeing to adopt the program in December 2024.\nThe 2023 program applied to improvements completed after June 29, 2022, and on or before June 29, 2026. The late adoption, combined with the slow rollout of a new schedule of reasonable costs that determined the value of the tax break, meant landlords have a shorter window to use the abatement.\nThe executive budget proposal seems to acknowledge this by creating a 10-year window, instead of four. The new incentive would apply to work completed after June 30, 2026, and before June 30, 2036. Critically, the bill also doesn\u2019t require the city to enact the tax break if the state approves the legislation.\nAs written, the bill also technically excludes any project completed on June 30, 2026, from either the current or new program, Rosenberg &amp; Estis\u2019 Benjamin Williams pointed out to me today. Whoops!\nLandlords also shied away from the program in recent years because they found the city\u2019s reasonable cost schedule to be wildly out of date. The governor\u2019s bill mandates that the city update its schedule of reasonable costs every three years.\nWhat it doesn\u2019t do:\nLandlords have argued that the eligibility restrictions meant that the break wasn\u2019t widely available. They have also called for broader relief for rent-stabilized properties. Hochul\u2019s budget doesn\u2019t change the eligibility parameters. To qualify, buildings must be 50 percent affordable, part of the state\u2019s Mitchell-Lama program or receive \u201csubstantial government assistance.\u201d\nThe reform proposals also leave intact a prohibition on landlords doubling up on the tax abatement and rent increases through the Major Capital Improvement program. New York Apartment Association\u2019s Jay Martin said the provision makes the program unworkable.\nStill, the bill allows landlords to file a waiver certifying that they will not try to collect MCI rent increases for the same rehab work after the state has confirmed they can receive J-51 benefits. So, owners can decide to forgo J-51 if they believe pursuing an MCI is the better deal.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nThis week, Mayor Zohran Mamdani told reporters that he didn\u2019t have any plans, at that time, to attend the Real Estate Board of New York\u2019s gala on Thursday. How much work was \u201cat this time\u201d doing in his response? Does he have different plans at\nthis\ntime? Do those plans include showing up to the Waldorf Astoria New York and granting a\nTRD\nreporter an interview? Can it? Hello? Send guesses to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\n(I was told on Wednesday, however, that\nLeila Bozorg\n, deputy mayor of housing and planning, plans to attend.)\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: New Jersey Gov. Mikie Sherrill held her inaugural ball at the American Dream shopping mall on Tuesday.\nHaving the event at a mall is very New Jersey, and having it at a mall where the drive there is likely to inspire road rage is also fitting. Reporter dispatches from the event show guests in gowns and tuxedos in front of a\nWetzels Pretzels\n. At the start of the night, a performer crooned Frank Sinatra while\nbackground\ndancers wearing military outfits, a nod to Sherill\u2019s time as a Navy helicopter pilot, languorously swiveling their hips. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever seen anything so delightfully discordant.\nThe night\napparently\nalso featured the new governor rapping alongside former members of the group Naughty by Nature.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nAmtrak on Wednesday announced three finalists that will compete to overhaul Penn Station,\nGothamist reports\n. Grand Penn Partners (backed by the National Civic Art Society and Trump donor Thomas Klingenstein), Penn Forward Now (led by Fengate Capital) and Halmar International are vying to be the project\u2019s master developer. The winner will be selected in May and announced in June.\n\u2014\nThe city is suing to stop a reality television show about the NYPD, hosted by celebrity psychologist Dr. Phil, from airing\n,\nthe New York Times reports\n. Former Mayor Eric Adams signed off on the show, dubbed \u201cBehind the Badge.\u201d\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$15 million\nfor a 4,042-square-foot condominium unit at 470 Columbus Avenue on the Upper West Side.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$77 million\nfor a bulk sale of sponsor-sale condos at 1 Park Row in the Financial District. Eenhoorn Properties purchased 58 of the 64 residential units, the retail unit and three office units.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$10 million\nfor a 2,005-square-foot condo at 760 Madison Avenue in Lenox Hill. Madeline Hult Elghanayan and Sabrina Saltiel with Douglas Elliman have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 470,705-square-foot, 14-story mixed-use project at 2560 Boston Road in the Allerton section of the Bronx. Ariel Aufgang filed the permit on behalf of Slate Property Group.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "\ud83c\udfc6 Residential:\nThe top home sale recorded in South Florida came in at $13.6 million, for a condo at\n2627 South Bayshore Drive\nin Coconut Grove. The sellers were a trust tied to\nPaul and Karen Wick\n, a financier and an attorney, respectively, and the buyer was a trust tied to\nDaniel S. Glaser.\nThe five bedroom, seven and a half bathroom unit measures more than 6,900 square feet, and the transaction pencils out to just under $2,000 per square foot. The Wicks purchased the pad in 2023 for $12.6 million and put it up for sale in October, asking $14.8 million.\nNathan Zeder\nwith Coldwell Banker Realty had the listing, and\nLiz Hogan\nwith Compass brought the buyer.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe top commercial transaction to hit records was in Miami\u2019s Wynwood neighborhood.\nKen Griffin\nand\nGoldman Properties\u2019\npurchase of an office property at\n545 Northwest 26th Street\nfor $181 million hit records. The seller was Chicago-based\nSterling Bay\n, which built the 10-story building, known as 545Wyn, in 2021. It spans nearly 500,000 square feet, pricing the deal at roughly $360 per square foot.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nA trio of industrial properties in Hialeah changed hands for $24.5 million. Boston-based\nLongpoint Realty Partners\nsold the buildings at\n14025 Northwest 58th Court\nin Miami Lakes and\n13290 and 13230 Northwest 45th Avenue\nin Opa Locka to Hoboken, New Jersey-based\nFaropoint Ventures.\nThey measure almost 108,000 square feet.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nIn Palm Beach, a single-family home at\n200 Bermuda Lane\ntraded for just under $8 million, or about $3,300 per square foot. The seller was an LLC managed by\nMark Marcello\n, and the buyer was an LLC managed by\nTimothy Scanlan.\nThe property measures about 2,400 square feet and has three bedrooms, two bathrooms and two half baths. The seller purchased the home in 2024 for $6.8 million. It went on the market in February 2025 for $9.3 million.\nLawrence Moens\nof Lawrence A. Moens Associates brokered the transaction.\nBy the Numbers:\nWhere are institutional investors buying homes in the US?\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order that seeks to place guardrails on\ninstitutional investors\nbuying single-family homes.\nBut do big buyers really compete with the average American who is looking to buy a home, and where are they most active?\nThe states with the greatest shares of investor-buyers in the second quarter were: Missouri (18.9 percent), Mississippi (17.1 percent) and Nevada (15.4 percent). The states with the lowest share were: Oregon (5.3 percent), Washington (5.7 percent) and New Hampshire (6.2 percent).",

McCuaig has been with Brookfield Properties in New York City for 20 years and was tapped as the firm\u2019s head of leasing in 2023, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n.\nDuring his time with Brookfield, he secured some of the most significant tenants for One and Two Manhattan West in Hudson Yards.\nThose included white shoe law firm Skadden and Cravath, consulting giants EY, KPMG and Accenture, the National Hockey League and hedge fund D.E. Shaw. He helped to secure 1.3 million square feet for Morgan Stanley at One New York Plaza in 2019. Among the other tenants he secured across Brookfield\u2019s New York portfolio were Amazon, Citadel and JP Morgan Chase.\nRelated Ross is the South Florida-focused spinoff of Hudson Yards developer Related Companies. Led by\nbillionaire Steve Ross\n, the firm has more than 3.8 million square feet of office completed or in the pipeline that need tenants. In his new role, McCuaig will oversee leasing for 360 Rosemary, One Flagler, 15 CityPlace, 10 CityPlace, CityPlace Tower, Esperant\u00e9 Corporate Center, Phillips Point, 515 Fern and 477 Rosemary.\nWells Fargo\nplans to relocate the headquarters for its wealth management arm to One Flagler with a 50,000-square-foot lease. Ross has also signed tenants\nServiceNow, Cleveland Clinic\nand architecture firm Roger Ferris + Partners. From the financial sector, it has signed Citizens Bank, JP Morgan Private Wealth Management and Metropolitan Commercial Bank.\nRoss speaks openly about his ambitions to transform West Palm Beach into the Silicon Valley of the future. As part of that effort,\nhe donated $50 million to Vanderbilt University\u2019s\nplanned business and tech-focused graduate campus in West Palm Beach that is moving forward after a first round of fundraising.",

        "content": "The saga of a distressed downtown Miami site appeared to be over after Cirrus won the property with a $77 million bid last month.\nBut a bankruptcy court judge recently ordered a new auction after the property owner, Brazilian developer\nGilberto Bomeny\n, complained that the bidding process freezed out potential buyers offering more money.\nU.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Laurel Isicoff set a Jan. 28 date for a new auction after hearing arguments on Dec. 31 from attorneys representing Cirrus and two Bomeny entities that own the nearly 1-acre parcel at\n340 Biscayne Boulevard\n, home to a Holiday Inn built in 1950.\n\u201cTo ensure that all interested parties have sufficient time to perform due diligence on the property and complete the vetting and bidder registration process, it was determined that additional time was appropriate,\u201d said Chad Roffers, CEO of Sotheby\u2019s Concierge Auctions, which is conducting the auction.\nBomeny bought the property with the 10-story, 200-room hotel for $65 million in 2015. The site is approved for an 82-story, 950,000-square-foot tower with 374 condos, 120 hotel rooms, offices and retail, along with 500 parking spaces.\nLinda Jackson, the lawyer for the Bomeny entities, and Cirrus\u2019 attorney Daniel Gonzalez did not respond to requests for comment.\nAn affiliate of New York-based\nCirrus\n, Joseph McDonnell, is the largest creditor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case the Bomeny entities filed last year to stave off a\nUCC foreclosure\n. Cirrus alleges they defaulted on a $70 million loan.\nThe judge authorized an auction that began taking bids on Dec. 4 and ended on Dec. 17 with a reserve of\n$70 million\n. The judge also approved a $101.5 million credit bid by the Cirrus affiliate. The lender was declared the winning bidder when the auction closed.\nHowever, Bomeny\u2019s entities filed a Dec. 25 motion seeking to\nthrow out the auction results\nand redo the sale due to \u201cconstant changes and irregularities\u201d in the sale process that shut out rival bidders. For instance, the hour when the auction was set to begin was changed several times by the auctioneer, Sotheby\u2019s Concierge Auctions, the motion states.\nAfter the auction closed, Bomeny learned that \u201cseveral\u201d prospective bidders who intended to participate were unable to do so because of the last-minute time change, a lack of communication from Sotheby\u2019s and technical issues that prevented registration or payment of the registration fee, the motion alleges. At least one of the bidders was going to bid almost double Cirrus\u2019 $77 million bid, Bomeny\u2019s lawyer alleged.\nCirrus disputed Bomeny\u2019s assertions in a Dec. 29 motion, alleging the property owner was \u201cunwilling to accept the auction\u2019s outcome\u201d and falsely accused \u201cits handpicked auctioneer of mishandling the auction so gravely that potential bidders were unable to participate.\u201d\nMoreover, Bomeny\u2019s potential bidders did not register for the auction and did not submit a $250,000 deposit to participate, the Cirrus motion states.\nOne of the bidders purportedly had been negotiating to buy the site for $140 million months before the auction, but did not follow through, Cirrus alleged.",

        "content": "Blackstone may be ready to test the market for one of Chicago\u2019s most recognizable assets.\nThe world\u2019s largest private real estate firm is exploring a potential exit from Willis Tower, the 110-story, 4.5-million-square-foot skyscraper at 233 South Wacker Drive it has owned for a decade. In recent months, Blackstone has quietly approached a small group of investors willing to assume the building\u2019s $1.3 billion securitized mortgage,\naccording\nto a Green Street\u2019s Real Estate Alert. Eastdil Secured is running those conversations, sources told the outlet.\nBlackstone\ndeclined to comment on a possible sale but pointed to recent operational gains in a statement to Bisnow. The firm highlighted more than 600,000 square feet of leasing over the past two years and over 1.2 million annual visitors to the Skydeck, the 103rd-floor observation deck that has become a major revenue driver.\nThe outreach comes as Willis Tower\u2019s valuation remains a moving target. As previously reported in\nThe Real Deal\n, the property was\nappraised at $1.4 billion\nabout a year ago, though public and private estimates throughout 2025 have ranged from roughly $999 million to $1.4 billion. The variance in appraiser opinions on the value has been chalked up to different methodologies for how to account for the Skydeck\u2019s contributions.\nBlackstone paid $1.3 billion for the tower in 2015, assuming existing debt as part of the deal. It refinanced with the $1.3 billion loan now attached to the property. The building\u2019s loan isn\u2019t distressed, but Blackstone has spent a lot on top of its initial purchase.\nAfter pouring roughly $670 million into renovations \u2014 including a sweeping office overhaul and the creation of the 300,000-square-foot Catalog retail and entertainment complex \u2014 Blackstone lifted\noccupancy and revenue\n. The property was 84 percent leased as of late September, and recently buoyed by deals with tenants like Adtalem Global Education and\nZurich North America\n. Skydeck revenue rose 15 percent last year.\nBlackstone also secured breathing room on the capital stack. Last year, the firm modified the floating-rate loan, extending its maturity to March 2028 with two one-year extension options. Loan servicer reports show the property is generating enough cash flow to cover debt service, according to Green Street.\nBut the numbers are getting tighter. Rising interest rates pushed annual debt service to $91.4 million in 2024, up from $66.4 million in 2018, according to the outlet. Real estate taxes have surged as well, running far ahead of underwriting. While cash flow is meeting or exceeding original projections, the debt-service coverage ratio has deteriorated, falling through the first nine months of 2025 from its underwritten origination.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Advocate is currently leading a massive $645 million expansion and renovation project of its Northside campuses, though it\u2019s unclear if that includes the building at 3000 North Halsted as well.\nSeller Healthcare Realty Trust specializes in investing in such properties, while IRA Capital is a private equity firm that focuses on a variety of alternative investments, according to the two firms\u2019 websites.

Specifically, its air conditioning system failed and led to overheating, forcing closures of inpatient rooms. Weiss reportedly received 87 percent of its funding from Medicare and Medicaid in 2024.",

        "content": "Takeda Pharmaceuticals is doubling down on the far north suburbs, expanding into the revamped former Motorola Mobility campus in Libertyville. It\u2019s handing an early leasing win to the Chicago developer that bought the property just over a year ago.\nThe drugmaker added nearly 80,000 square feet at\nInnovation Park Lake County\n, a 1 million-square-foot office and research complex at 1910 Innovation Way, according to owner R2 Companies. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat the expansion brings Takeda\u2019s total presence at the property to 105,673 square feet, expanding the office space it first leased there in late 2024.\nThe deal fills space previously occupied by Bristol Myers Squibb, which shut down a gene-therapy manufacturing facility at the campus last year. A Takeda spokesperson confirmed the lease and said the new space is an expansion for the company in the northern suburbs, not a relocation from another local site.\nThe move provides an example of Innovation Park\u2019s appeal as a life sciences hub in Lake County, an area long anchored by biotech and pharmaceutical users. Takeda, which moved its U.S. headquarters from\nDeerfield\nto Boston in 2019 after acquiring Irish drugmaker Shire, still maintains a significant operational presence in the region, according to the outlet. The company operates a plasma therapy unit in Round Lake at a property owned by Baxter International, tied to the former Baxalta business that ultimately folded into Takeda.\nA joint venture of R2 and Chicago-based\nJDI Realty\npaid $35 million for the 83-acre Innovation Park property in late 2024, acquiring it from\nMaryland-based developer\nBeco Management that spent nearly $40 million converting the former Motorola cell phone plant into a multi-tenant research and office park. Beco Management acquired the site for $9.5 million in 2013.\nWith Takeda\u2019s expansion, Innovation Park is about 68 percent leased, roughly unchanged from when the joint venture bought it. Medline Industries, one of the property\u2019s largest tenants, plans to vacate about 138,000 square feet later this year as it consolidates employees into new offices in Northbrook, according to the publication.\nOther major tenants include Sumitomo Biorational Company, formed last year through the combination of Valent BioSciences, Valent North America and MGK.\nOriginally developed in the early 1990s for Motorola Mobility, the campus began winding down after Google acquired the handset maker in 2012.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The property\u2019s owner, 2225 Telegraph Property LLC, refinanced the building in 2022; the entity\u2019s address in state records is tied to Minnesota-based Graves Hospitality.\nGraves Hospitality and San Francisco-based real estate development firm Tidewater Capital began developing the hotel in 2019. At the time, confidence in uptown Oakland was high amid a construction boom and an influx of residents and businesses from San Francisco. Construction on the Moxy began as development firm TMG planned a 28-floor office building across the street and Kaiser plotted a 1.6-million-square-foot headquarters blocks away.\nThe pandemic quickly threw cold water on that optimism. When the Moxy opened in spring 2021, Kaiser had abandoned its plans as it faced delays and rising costs, while TMG\u2019s development had stalled; a chain-link fence now surrounds that empty lot across the street. The Moxy\u2019s exterior lights are still on, though the interior is empty and heat lamps and deck chairs are abandoned on the second-floor balcony, according to the Standard.\nThe Moxy was \u201ca victim of wrong place and wrong time, considering how much positive momentum Oakland had prior to the pandemic,\u201d Louis Thibault of Avison Young told the Standard.\nIn September, after the hotel fell into default, a court appointed Michelle Russo, CEO of asset management firm HotelAVE, as receiver to manage the property. Two months later, the county tax collector issued a lien for nearly $102,000 in unpaid property taxes. The hotel then quietly stopped accepting new reservations.\nRusso has been entrenched in the ongoing hotel woes in the Bay Area.\nShe was appointed as receiver\nof Parc 55 and Hilton Union Square in San Francisco in 2023 after those properties also fell into default. The hotels were sold\nto Newbond Holdings and Conversant Capital\nlast fall.\nOakland, like San Francisco, has had its fair share of lodging troubles.\nLast January, the Waterfront Hotel in Jack London Square closed suddenly and the Radisson Hotel Oakland Airport was hit with a foreclosure lawsuit. In downtown Oakland, a dual-branded Residence Inn and AC Hotel downtown was seized by its lender in April. Three months later, the Oakland Marriott City Center, the largest hotel in town,\nsold at foreclosure\n. The Residence Inn, AC Hotel and Marriott City Center properties remain open to guests.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Reisor, who also works in New York, heads the 14-member Reisor Team, which exceeded $100 million in sales volume in 2025, according to a press release.\nThe Compass brand and its off-market listing option were both persuasive draws, Reisor said.\n\u201cCompass\u2019s private exclusive network is very important in New York. In Austin, around half of what we do is off-market, so I think there\u2019s a lot of demand for that in both places. But\nin Austin, there\u2019s more resources for that\n,\u201d Reisor said.\nHigh property taxes, non-disclosure laws and the\noccasional camera-shy celebrity\nhave engendered a robust off-market scene in Austin. More than one enterprise supports real estate deals outside the Multiple Listing Service, including the members-only Austin Luxury Network and the local startup Clubhouse.\nNew York doesn\u2019t have such an infrastructure for private transactions, making it a more open frontier for Compass to claim, he said.\nCompass\u2019 private listing feature has generated nationwide controversy, including a\nlawsuit filed by Zillow\n. The\nClear Cooperation Policy\nof the National Association of Realtors requires agents to list homes on Multiple Listing Services. Zillow is lending its muscle to enforce the NAR rule, having\nbanned\nlistings that agents don\u2019t submit to an MLS within a day of marketing them.\nThe Reisor Team is just the latest Texas group to join Compass in recent weeks. Last month, Houston team The Property Collective Group left Keller Williams for Compass. And Oak Cliff Real Estate rejoined Compass in December after a brief period with Dallas-based Dave Perry-Miller Real Estate.\nMeanwhile, Houston luxury agent\nDana Johnson left Compass for Douglas Elliman\nearlier this year.\nReisor joined Douglas Elliman in 2021 after having worked at Kuper Sotheby\u2019s International Realty since 2018, according to his LinkedIn.\n",

        "content": "A powerhouse team of developers scored approval from a city board for a Miami Design District project with condos and a hotel.\nThe project, called Miami Design Residences Designed by Chipperfield, sailed through the Miami Design Review Board board this week, with some members gushing over its design. The development comes amid an uptick in residential proposals for the Miami Design District, which is primarily a luxury retail area.\nMiami Design District Associates and Fort Lauderdale-based Fort Partners are partnering with New York-based private equity firm Raycliff Capital and Qatari firm Constellation Hotels Holding on the project planned for a site on the northeast corner of North Miami Avenue and Northeast 39th Street. Miami Design District Associates, which developed the district, consists of Craig Robins\u2019 Dacra, L Catterton Real Estate and Brookfield.\nThe development would consist of a 25-story building with 143 condos on the south side of the property, and a 12-story building with 85 hotel keys and 20 condo-hotel units on the north side, according to the architect\u2019s presentation to the board and records included in the board agenda. Both buildings will have a rooftop, and the hotel building will have wraparound terraces.\nThe project is designed by Pritzker Prize-winning British architect Sir David Chipperfield and Cube 3. It is Chipperfield\u2019s only Florida development underway, according to a news release on the project.\nCondo sales are expected to launch next month, with Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group leading sales.\nThe development site is at 45, 53, 55, 75 and 81 Northeast 39th Street; at 10, 28, 40, 50 and 56 Northeast 40th Street; and 3995 North Miami Avenue. Records show the development partnership paid\n$143.6 million\nfor the properties in two deals in 2022.\n\u201cI think your project is very fitting to the district,\u201d said board member Francisco Perez-Azua. \u201cThe elevations here are very simple and subtle but elegant.\u201d\nOther members of the board, which often takes a critical view of other projects, echoed Perez-Azua\u2019s view.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a spectacular project,\u201d Gia Zapattini, the board\u2019s vice chair added. \u201cIt\u2019s very elegant and sophisticated.\u201d \u2026 It\u2019s raising the bar really for the neighborhood.\u201d\nThe board approved the project with three recommendations for tweaks: examining balcony edges and using a green roof material at a portion of the hotel building, and removing a picket fence-type balcony railings.\n\u201cI think the vertical picket fence railing is something we see in lower level projects like workforce housing,\u201d Zapattini said.\nMiami Design District Associates, which owns close to half a million square feet in the district, scored a\n$100 million\nloan last month for six retail properties, adding the debt to an existing $250 million financing on the real estate. The Design District is home to Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi, Gucci, Off-White and Chanel, among other brands.\nFort Partners, led by Nadim Ashi, developed The Surf Club in Surfside and the Four Seasons Hotel and Residences in Fort Lauderdale.\nIn other recent residential proposals for the Miami Design District, Miami Design District Associates, Hunter Pasteur and The Forbes Company landed a\n$125 million\nconstruction loan in July for the 20-story, 107-unit Cassi apartment building at 91-93 Northeast 36th Street.\u00a0New York-based Helm Equities\u2019 Live Local Act project in the Design District scored UDRB\napproval\nlast month. Helm, an affiliate of JEMB Realty, plans a 36-story tower with\n278 residential units\nand an adjacent eight-story building with over 101,000 square feet of offices and some retail on a nearly 2-acre site at 220 Northeast 43rd Street.\n",

The complaint alleges the firm made the cuts \u201cto discourage employees from engaging\u201d in collective action.\nElaine Molinar, a partner at Snohetta, said \u201cbusiness considerations\u201d were at play in the firings and that the union preferences of individual employees were largely unknown.\nA paper trail, however, suggests otherwise.\nIn 2023, employees tried to align with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, first seeking voluntary recognition from management before filing for a union election that May. The vote ultimately failed, 35-29.\nWeeks later, management announced that layoffs were coming. The eight people let go were all supporters of the unionization effort.\nEmail correspondence accessible to employees allegedly uncovered discussions by managers the day before the vote about who supported the unionization effort. Email exchanges after the vote reportedly underlined a desire to prevent further unionization efforts by getting rid of supporters.\nA labor board judge will litigate the case, which can be appealed to a national board if Snohetta comes out on the losing end. Backpay for affected employees is one of the penalties on the table.\nSnohetta was founded in 2004 by architects from a Norwegian company and has gone on to design several notable public projects. Recently, the firm was involved in Gary Barnett\u2019s supertall on the former Disney campus on\nthe Upper West Side\n.\nUnionization is rare for architects, but there is a growing movement focusing on issues such as low pay, extensive hours and unpaid overtime.\nIn February 2022, SHoP Architects employees\ndropped\na unionization effort following a \u201cpowerful anti-union campaign,\u201d in the words of Architectural Workers United.\nMonths later, the workers at New York-based Bernheimer Architecture\nannounced\nthe formation of a union, the country\u2019s first private-sector union at an architecture firm.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Qualifying households must earn between 80 percent and 120 percent of the area median income, which is $87,200 annually in Miami-Dade County.

Even at the low end of the range, a lease of that size would represent a significant expansion from the 10,000 to 20,000 square feet it occupies at 155 Sixth Avenue, according to\nCompStak\n; that lease is expiring this year.\nAnthropic declined to comment to the publication.\nThe company has shown little hesitance to make moves on the office front. In the fall, Anthropic\nsigned\na lease for approximately 100,000 square feet of office space at 505 Howard Street in downtown San Francisco, across the street from its headquarters.\nThe lease came shortly after a $13 billion investment fundraise in September.\nAnd while the AI sector is transforming San Francisco\u2019s office market, tenants haven\u2019t been shy about embracing space in New York City, either.\nAt the start of this month, AI voice analytics company Rilla inked\na 57,000-square-foot\nlease at Global Holdings\u2019\n25 Kent\nin one of the borough\u2019s biggest office deals of the past year. The company will occupy the entire eighth-floor penthouse, along with nearly 4,000 square feet of private outdoor space, according to the landlord.\nAnd just this week, multifamily AI firm EliseAI signed a\n10-year lease\nfor 109,000 square feet at the Chetrit Organization\u2019s 401 Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. The AI firm, which focuses on housing and healthcare, will occupy approximately half the building as it relocates from 33 East 33rd Street.\nManhattan office leasing reached pre-pandemic levels\nin the fourth quarter\n, posting its best quarter since late 2019 with 11.9 million square feet in leases, according to Colliers. That helped contribute to a yearly total of nearly 42 million square feet for the highest mark since 2019.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "750 Lexington Avenue\nhas officially left the Cohen Brothers orbit.\nThe\ntroubled office tower\nhit the auction block on Wednesday in Lower Manhattan, but failed to garner any bids. The upset price, or minimum bid, was set at $161,854,848.66, but the property returned to the lender.\nThe auction did garner questions from one potential bidder, who brought legal counsel, about whether the plaintiff would consider lowering the minimum bid. But that would-be buyer declined to identify himself.\nThe auction marks not only a change in ownership for the office building, but a new low point for billionaire\nCharles Cohen, who heads Cohen Brothers\n. Cohen has lost control of several properties in his fights with lenders. But 750 Lex was a legacy property for the company, developed in the 1980s by Cohen\u2019s father and home to the company\u2019s own offices.\nThe foreclosure and auction are the result of a $130 million refinancing loan on the property that Cohen personally sponsored in 2015. At the time, 750 Lex was valued at $300 million, according to Morningstar Credit. Now, the most recent appraisal put it at\njust $41 million\n\u2014 marking an 85 percent haircut.\nThe building, also called 1 International Plaza, is 30 stories and sits at the corner of East 59th Street and Lexington Avenue, where Midtown meets the Upper East Side.\nThe financial freefall at the building began in 2022, when occupancy began to slip and Cohen fell behind on payments. Major retail tenant Zara left its space and months later beleaguered coworking company WeWork stopped paying its rent, according to information provided to Morningstar.\nNet operating income in 2023 was a quarter of what it was when the loan was underwritten. Occupancy, once full, fell to 69 percent.\nCohen worked out a lease amendment with WeWork after the company declared bankruptcy, shortening the term and tying rent to revenue from the space. But it wasn\u2019t enough to save the building.\nSpecial servicer LNR Partners filed a foreclosure case in 2024 and won a\nsummary judgment\nthis past summer.\nAs of June, occupancy had ticked back up to 73 percent, according to Morningstar Credit. But net operating income, which does not include debt service, was just 1.8 million, just 14 percent of what it was in 2015.\nElsewhere, Cohen continues to battle with Fortress Credit. The billionaire owes a $187 million personal debt to the lender after defaults on a $534 million loan portfolio he had guaranteed. He has so far sold two buildings \u2014 3 East 54th Street and 623 Fifth Avenue \u2014 to Vornado Realty Trust and used $52 million of the proceeds to pay Fortress. The lender has asked the court for a receiver to sell off Cohen\u2019s assets, saying the developer\n\u201ccannot be trusted\u201d\nto do so himself.\nIn response, Cohen apparently told the court he was working out a refinancing deal with a realty trust, according to court documents from Fortress. A judge has asked Cohen to present concrete evidence of that process.\n",

The filing was a two-page summons, rather than a full lawsuit, leaving many details up in the air.\nThe board of the prewar luxury building in the Upper West Side claims there are construction and operational issues at the property.

The company did not respond to a request for comment from the publication and had not yet filed a formal response to the summons.\nThe notorious HFZ Capital Group acquired a four-building portfolio from Westbrook Partners in 2013 for $610 million, teaming with Fortress Investment Group on the deal. The portfolio consisted of 743 rental units, which the partners subsequently began converting into residential condos.\nHFZ projected a $316 million sellout of the Astor\u2019s roughly 100 units when sales began in 2015.

        "content": "Looks like\nCarolwood Estates\nfound a way to go international minus the overhead of opening new offices.\nThe Beverly Hills-based boutique brokerage struck a partnership with London property consultancy Knight Frank, further expanding the brand\u2019s reach into the global markets.\nCarolwood\nadds the ability to attract prospective buyers globally to its inventory of Los Angeles-area luxury properties. Knight Frank, meanwhile, gains a fast-rising boutique brand as a local partner.\nLast year, Carolwood\nranked fourth\namong Los Angeles County\u2019s top brokerages, based on volume of on-market deals closed between July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025. The brokerage notched $3.3 billion across 478 transactions, making a sizable jump after debuting on\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s 2024 ranking at No. 8.\nCarolwood\u2019s client base and inventory are the \u201cperfect fit,\u201d for Knight Frank business,\u201d CEO and co-founder Drew Fenton said in a press release.\nSpecifics of how the partnership between the two firms is structured and whether it\u2019s simply referrals or also includes marketing, licensing or other terms are unclear.\nA Carolwood spokesperson referred any questions to a press release on the deal. Knight Frank did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\nFor Knight Frank, the partnership places its name back into the mix within the U.S. in a big way after its 15-year relationship with\nDouglas Elliman\nended in June. The two companies continue to work with one another on a referral basis. Douglas Elliman announced plans to launch its own international business before the two sides agreed to end their affiliation in June.\nKnight Frank is now eyeing other brokerages in high-end markets domestically, including New York, Miami, Palm Beach and Aspen.\nFenton and the management team at Carolwood, which was founded in November 2022, have remained firm in a strategy of building a strong, local presence in LA\u2019s high end rather than aim to build a national business.\nStill, the brokerage found ways to expand without minimal operating costs. In March, it became the exclusive Los Angeles affiliate for Forbes Global properties, giving Carolwood access to the Forbes audience and prospective buyers and sellers.\nIn May, Carolwood made good on its desire to own the local high-end when it launched its private listings portal, called\nCarolwood Private Portal\n, in a bid to take advantage of its market share.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to be a national brand. We don\u2019t want to be a national brand,\u201d Nick Segal, co-founder and managing broker, told\nTRD\nat the time of the private listings portal launch. \u201cWe want to be your resource to Beverly Hills and Los Angeles.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Illinois is investigating possible housing discrimination by the landlord of a Chicago South Shore apartment complex that became ground zero for a high-profile immigration raid last year, alleging the owners may have coordinated with federal agents to intimidate tenants and force them out.\nThe Illinois Department of Human Rights said late Wednesday that it filed a formal charge against the owners and managers of the 130-unit building at 7500 South Shore Drive. They include 7500 Shore A, Wisconsin-based investor Trinity Flood and property manager Strength in Management, according to the agency. The New York Times\nreported\nthat the probe centers on claims that the landlords alerted federal authorities to Venezuelan immigrants living in the building in an effort to coerce Black and Hispanic residents \u2014 including U.S. citizens \u2014 into leaving.\nGov. JB Pritzker called the allegations \u201cdeeply troubling,\u201d saying state law bars not only direct discrimination, but also conduct that aids or abets efforts to interfere with housing and civil rights, as first\nreported\nby the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\u201cIllinois will not tolerate conduct that puts anyone in Illinois at risk of discrimination or harm,\u201d Pritzker said in a statement.\nThe case stems from a\nSept. 30 raid\nthat left the building in chaos and drew national attention. Federal agents arrested at least 37 people, most of them Venezuelan nationals, during what witnesses described as a sweeping operation that included detaining U.S. citizens for hours and separating children from their parents. Residents told the Sun-Times some tenants hid neighbors inside their apartments to avoid arrest.\nAt the time, officials with the Trump administration said the raid targeted unauthorized immigrants, some with alleged ties to criminal gangs. But the scale of the operation \u2014 and its focus on a distressed building in a predominantly Black neighborhood \u2014 raised questions about why the property was singled out.\nAccording to the state, the new investigation will examine whether the landlords\u2019 actions amounted to an illegal attempt to clear the building of tenants. In the year leading up to the raid, management filed 25 eviction cases against tenants and squatters, more than the total filed over the previous four years combined, according to the Sun-Times. Most residents were paying rent of between $900 and $1,050 a month.\nThe property\u2019s troubles didn\u2019t end with the raid. Last month, the remaining residents were\nforced out\nafter the building was\nforeclosed on\n, along with two other South Side properties tied to Flood.\nStrength in Management and Flood\ndid not respond to requests for comment.\n\u201cThe conduct alleged in this matter reflects more than isolated harm,\u201d Illinois Department of Human Rights Director Jim Bennett told the Sun-Times. \u201cIt describes a pattern of intimidation that reverberates through our communities.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Kolter Group bought a condemned waterfront hotel in Miami Beach for $26 million as part of a residential redevelopment play with an adjacent property.\nAn affiliate of Delray Beach-based Kolter, led by Bobby Julien, acquired the 90-year-old Normandy Plaza Hotel at 6979 Collins Avenue, records and real estate database Vizzda show.\nWells Fargo provided a $41 million mortgage that is also secured by the\nCrystal Beach Suites Miami Oceanfront Resort\nat 6985 Collins Avenue. Kolter and Aventura-based BH Group, led by Isaac and Liat Toledano, bought the 84-room Crystal Beach in 2023 for\n$24 million\n.\nVilarino Property Group, managed by Antonio Vilarino in Hollywood, sold the 63-room Normandy Plaza to Kolter. The seller paid $6.7 million for the property in 2007, records show. Built in 1936, the three-story hotel was designed by the late L. Murray Dixon, an architect behind a slew of Art Deco buildings in Miami Beach.\nKolter and BH\u2019s plans to tear down the hotels won approval from the Miami Beach Preservation Board in September. The joint venture is planning a 19-story condominium with 37 units and 86 parking spaces. Miami-based Kobi Karp is the architect.\nThe hotels are not designated historic landmarks, but the properties are in a historic district in the city\u2019s North Beach neighborhood, requiring the preservation board\u2019s review of the redevelopment proposal.\nMiami-Dade County declared Normandy Plaza an unsafe structure and ordered its demolition in 2018, a September letter of intent by the developer states. The building has been vacant since 2013.\nKolter\nand BH listed the Crystal Beach property for sale with a whisper price of\n$110 million\nlast year. However, a source familiar with the redevelopment plan said the joint venture is no longer selling the site. Kolter and BH representatives did not respond to requests for comment.\nKolter and BH also teamed up to develop\nSolana Bay\n, a 10-story waterfront condominium with 52 units in North Miami. Sales for the project launched last year.",

Once complete, the H Mart will span about 100,000 square feet, making it the largest H Mart outpost in the United States.\nH Mart\u2019s Fremont location will operate across two levels and include a food hall and dine-in restaurants as well as its usual grocery offerings, the company and Vestar said, according to the Mercury News. Vestar manages the Pacific Commons Shopping Center where the store will rise. The complex is owned by\nHeitman\n.\n\u201cThe ground floor will feature the grocery store, while the second floor will include a food hall, bar, restaurant and communal spaces,\u201d Carli Richards, a spokesperson for Vestar, told the Mercury News.\nLast month, an East Coast group tied to H Mart CEO Il Yeon Kwon emerged as the\nbuyer of the closed Kohl\u2019s location\n, spending $18.3 million in an all-cash deal for the property, below the building\u2019s assessed value of $26.1 million. Construction on the store is expected to begin by the end of this year.\nBy implementing an \u201cinnovative reuse of a vacant large-format retail space,\u201d H Mart is part of Fremont\u2019s story of companies \u201creimagining vacant commercial properties into destinations that generate jobs, amenities and lasting community value,\u201d Fremont Mayor Raj Salwan said of the development. When complete, it will be the second H Mart store in the East Bay.\nH Mart broke into the Northern California market in 2017 with the opening of a San Jose location. A second San Jose location opened the following year, and a\nSan Francisco H Mart\nstarted welcoming customers in 2021. The company\u2019s first East Bay store is\nin the works in Dublin\n, though its debut has been delayed and an opening date is yet to be determined.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Is this the final cut for the Bel Air speculative mansion known as\nLa Fin\n?\nThe party property at\n1200 Bel Air Road\n, with a nightclub and screening rooms, is back on the market this month with a new price tag of just under $100 million. At roughly 105,000 square feet, the asking price amounts to about $952 per square foot.\nWith the 12-bedroom, 17-bathroom resort-inspired home now out of the nine-figure club, will the new price be just what the property needs to find a buyer?\nSome of the listing agents \u2014 part of a small army from across multiple brokerages \u2014 say yes.\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California CEO and co-founder Aaron Kirman said the thinking behind the new asking price reflects a \u201cmore pragmatic luxury market.\u201d\nThe home\u2019s got its marketing ground covered with some of Los Angeles\u2019 top names tapped to sell the property. Aside from Kirman, that group includes Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s Tomer Fridman, Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Shauna Walters and Nicole Plaxen, Douglas Elliman\u2019s Jacob Greene and Josh Altman and Compass\u2019 Sally Forster Jones.\nWalters, who made the move to\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\nwith her team co-founder Plaxen late last year, called out market dynamics where discerning buyers are leading conversations with sellers.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had consistent interest around La Fin, and for some time people have been asking the owner to make this move,\u201d Walters said. \u201cIt\u2019s a smart response to today\u2019s buyer mindset.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t the first price cut and the drop does take the mansion below $100 million after testing market appetite first in 2022 with a $139 million ask.\nSince then, the property has seen several reductions, including the most recent in October, when the listing price moved to $108.9 million before exiting the market in December.\nA significant point to consider is the\nMeasure United to House L.A.\ntwo-tier tax, which applies to all real estate deals within the city of Los Angeles starting at $5.3 million. The so-called mansion tax would no doubt apply to a trade of La Fin, triggering the higher 5.5 percent levy on the deal.\nAt the home\u2019s original asking price of $139 million, that equates to $7.6 million. If the home trades at its current listing price, the ULA tax pencils out to $5.5 million.\nThe estate sits on over 2 acres and was built by real estate investor and physician Joseph Englanoff, who paid $5 million for the property in 2014. The home\u2019s highlights are many and include the acceptance of payment in crypto, a six-car vehicle display elevator, spa, wine cellar, cigar lounge, rock climbing wall and massage room.\nEnglanoff\u2019s name is well-known in L.A. real estate as he was also a lender on Nile Niami\u2019s\nThe One\nspec mansion at 944 Airole Way in Bel Air, which at one time sought $295 million. The property was sold at auction in 2022 to\nRichard Saghian\n, founder of fast-fashion company\nFashion Nova\n, for $141 million.\n",

        "content": "After a year of plummeting value and questions about 225 Bush Street\u2019s fate, the downtown San Francisco office tower appears poised to emerge from its pit of distress.\nLenders have\nbegun the process of selling\na $350 million nonperforming loan tied to 225 Bush Street, the San Francisco Business Times reported. The special servicer overseeing the note is reportedly in discussions with JLL about putting the loan on the market, multiple people with knowledge of the matter told the Business Times. A formal listing has yet to emerge.\nBuilding owner Kylli\ndefaulted on the note in November 2024\n, and the 22-story tower\u2019s lenders have floated various options to settle the nonperforming debt, including working out a deal with Kylli, listing the debt for sale and pursuing foreclosure at the site. By putting the debt up for sale, a buyer could either move to foreclose on 225 Bush or arrange a deal with Kylli to take ownership of the 580,972-square-foot building.\nKylli, a subsidiary of Chinese investor Genzon Investment Group, acquired a majority stake in 225 Bush Street, once the headquarters of Standard Oil Corporation, in 2014. At the time, the building\u2019s value was placed at $350 million. In 2019, Kylli bought a minority stake from San Francisco-based Flynn Properties and refinanced the building with the $350 million loan. The building\u2019s appraised value that year was $589 million.\nIn December 2024, after the owner stopped making payments on the loan, the\nbuilding\u2019s appraised value dropped\nto $153 million, or approximately $263 per square foot. Last August, lenders sued to have the building placed into receivership, putting management operations in the hands of a third party rather than Kylli. Douglas Wilson of Douglas Wilson Companies was appointed as receiver that month, and the firm has been working with JLL on leasing at the building since then, according to San Francisco Superior Court documents cited by the Business Times.\nThe property at 225 Bush is hardly the first San Francisco office building to fall into loan default after the pandemic. Last month, Columbia Property Trust\nreceived a notice of default\nafter missing payments on\na $1.7 billion\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities loan backed by\n650 California Street\nand 201 California Street, both in San Francisco\u2019s Financial District, and five other office buildings across the country. In October, lenders\nfiled a lawsuit\nto initiate foreclosure proceedings at 55 Hawthorne Street after CIM Group defaulted on a $61.5 million loan backed by the property.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The Dallas Mavericks are zooming in on the hunt for their next home court between two sites within the city limits, but the final call may still be months away.\nThe NBA franchise is now focused on a downtown Dallas location and the former Valley View Center property, a 110-acre tract at Preston Road and I-635, according to\ncomments\nfrom Mavericks CEO Rick Welts. Speaking to the Dallas Morning News, Welts said the team has been working closely with city officials to advance the two options.\n\u201cWe have identified, with the city, two city of Dallas locations that we are focusing all our time and attention on now, and hoping to bring one of them to success,\u201d\nWelts\ntold the outlet.\nA downtown site could include the land beneath\nDallas City Hall\n, though that option hinges on whether the city ultimately preserves or demolishes the I.M. Pei\u2013designed building. Other downtown parcels have been floated in recent months, including land near the planned convention center overhaul.\nNorth Dallas\u2019 Valley View site, once home to a regional mall, emerged as the other frontrunner. The property\u2019s size makes it attractive for what the team has described as a large-scale mixed-use entertainment district anchored by a new arena.\nThe long-discussed county jail site at 111 Commerce Street has also surfaced as a\ntheoretical option\n, though Dallas County officials have said no formal talks have taken place. The jail sits on 15 acres of riverfront land owned by the county. The property is valued at $109 million, appraisal district records show.\nNo decision is imminent. The Mavericks\u2019 lease at the American Airlines Center runs through 2031, and Welts acknowledged that an earlier goal to announce a site by the end of March has slipped. He now expects a decision closer to July 1, at about the end of the NBA season, according to the publication.\n\u201cRight now, our hope is somewhere around July 1 \u2026 that we are in position to be able to make a decision,\u201d Welts told the outlet, adding that factors beyond the team\u2019s control have pushed the timeline back.\nLast summer, Dallas\nhired\nHillwood Urban Services for $75,000 to help identify and evaluate potential sites for a new NBA arena.\nWelts emphasized that time is tightening, despite the long runway.\n\u201cWe want to open in 2031,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means we\u2019re on the clock.\u201d\nFor a roughly 50-acre mixed-use district with an arena and public spaces, he added, the development timeline is anything but leisurely.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "To conduct its much-maligned crackdown, Immigration and Customs Enforcement needs real estate. One pursuit in the Hudson Valley is being met by swift resistance.\nICE is attempting to buy a warehouse at 29 Elizabeth Drive in Chester, Bloomberg\nreported\n. The owner of the warehouse is an affiliate of billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who didn\u2019t comment to the local press, other than to say he became aware of the situation through a local newspaper.\nLast trading hands at the end of 2021, the warehouse is 60 miles from Manhattan and 15 miles from the airport, relevant when considering ICE\u2019s typical operations under the Trump administration. The property was last valued by Orange County at $25 million.\nThe buyer is one part of the controversy, as recent action in Minneapolis deepened the unpopularity of Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\nThe uproar also pertains to ICE\u2019s likely use for the facility, should a purchase go through. A public notice on the Department of Homeland Security website proposes a guard building, improved security fencing and an outdoor recreation area, all of which seem to point to a detention center.\nNot even local members of Trump\u2019s party are on board with the possibility of a detention center in Chester. Orange County executive Steve Neuhaus, a Republican, opposes an ICE conversion of the facility, preferring to see it redeveloped for light manufacturing or film studio space.\nCongressperson Pat Ryan, a Democrat, submitted a petition with more than 10,000 signatures to DHS, opposing ICE\u2019s pursuit of the warehouse, according to\nNews 12\n.\nThe budget for ICE is one of the flashpoints in the latest government funding fight, though it\u2019s unclear if Democrats have the stomach to push back on full funding for the agency. Last time around, Congress approved $45 billion for expanded enforcement and detention operations as ICE pursues \u201cmega-centers\u201d that can hold thousands of detainees.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Eastdil Secured has zeroed in on 601W as a buyer for a distressed, Brookfield-owned office tower on Bunker Hill in downtown Los Angeles.\nThe New York City-based investment company is in talks to purchase the\nmortgage loan\non 333 South Grand Avenue, which encompasses Wells Fargo Center \u2014 North Tower and the retail spot connected to it, for $180 million, knowledgeable sources in the downtown Los Angeles office sector said. The deal has not closed, according to an informed source.\nA $180 million deal for the 54-story, 1.4 million-square-foot office tower at the northern part of L.A.\u2019s Financial District, comes out to about $130 per square foot. That doesn\u2019t account for the three-story retail atrium, which is another 60,000 square feet. Either way, it is nowhere near the debt of $506 million or so that\u2019s in default on the Wells Fargo Center\u2019s North Tower.\nEastdil declined to comment. Neither Brookfield nor 601W responded to requests for comment.\nThe sister Wells Fargo Center \u2014 South tower is not included in the deal; Newmark is\nshopping\nthat one.\nLate last year, there were four Brookfield-related\nofferings\nthat accounted for almost a fifth of Class A office space throughout downtown\u2019s Financial District, including Bunker Hill: EY Plaza, Bank of America Plaza and Wells Fargo Center, the twin tower skyscraper complex.\nThe near-deal on the North Tower could fall through \u2014 a turn that came to pass last year on Carolwood\u2019s $130 million deal to purchase EY Plaza at 725 South Figueroa Street, another office building owned by Brookfield, but in a receiver\u2019s hands. Carolwood\u2019s deal collapsed in due diligence. The note later came back to market and there are\nrumblings of a deal\n.\nThe Well Fargo North Tower is 61 percent leased, and the Halo, the retail property, is only 35 percent leased, according to an earlier marketing memorandum. The distressed debt on the real estate includes a mezzanine loan from Oaktree Capital Management, in which Brookfield owns a controlling interest. Brookfield could own Oaktree entirely if its bid to acquire the remaining interest in Oaktree, which was once headquartered at the North Tower, goes through.\n",

        "content": "The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is facing backlash from veterans over a plan to build up to 800 tiny homes this year on its West Los Angeles campus.\nThe proposal, which\nsurfaced this week\nduring a federal court hearing, calls for the construction of hundreds of 8-by-8-foot sheds to house veterans, the Los Angeles Times reported. Critics, including veterans themselves, argue that the small structures that are often used as quick fixes for homelessness are cramped, inaccessible and unfit for lengthy stays.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s suitable at all,\u201d said Rob Reynolds, an Iraq war veteran who was part of a 2022 federal lawsuit asking for more housing. That effort also called for an end to\nleases of large portions of the 388-acre campus\nto outside interests such as the University of California, Los Angeles, and the Brentwood School.\nThe more than 100 tiny homes already installed near San Vicente Boulevard have already proven problematic, particularly for residents using wheelchairs and walkers. Fire safety and durability have also emerged as concerns.\nIn 2024, U.S. District Court Judge David O. Carter ordered the VA to build more than 2,500 units of temporary and permanent housing on top of an earlier mandate for 1,200 permanent units. In December, an\nappeals court upheld that order\n. Carter questioned in the hearing on Tuesday whether relocating homeless veterans from Skid Row to small sheds on the Westside would meaningfully improve their situation and suggested money might be better spent elsewhere.\nThe tiny home push also risks colliding with a\nseparate directive from President Donald Trump\nin May. The president\nissued an executive order\nestablishing a National Center for Warrior Independence on the West Los Angeles campus, envisioned to include housing for up to 6,000 veterans. VA officials have not clarified whether the sheds are meant to satisfy the court order, advance the Warrior Independence center housing or both.\nThe additional residences would replace a parking lot and grass field next to the existing tiny home village alongside San Vicente Boulevard. The VA has enough funds in its current authorization to complete the temporary housing by the end of 2026, but not enough for the permanent housing portion, Robert Fleck, acting principal general counsel for the VA, told the court.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Arselle and Amoroso spent $22 million in August to acquire Alur, a 51-unit property in Pasadena; in October they dropped $44 million for the 119-unit Sofi Topanga complex in Chatsworth and $23 million for the 48-unit Terraces at La Cienega in West Hollywood.\nWith the Amonte platform, Arselle and Amoroso plan to focus on adding high-quality assets in suburban and infill locations in markets with robust demographics, job growth and barriers to new supply.\nAmoroso owns a portfolio that includes hospitality, medical office and self-storage assets in addition to the nearly 8,000 residential units the company has developed, owned or operated, mostly in the Western United States. Since its founding in 1978, the firm has invested in approximately $550 million of real estate assets.

        "content": "Naperville slammed the brakes on a proposed data center this week, rejecting a project that had become one of the most contentious land use fights the Chicago suburb has seen in years.\nAfter months of organized opposition from nearby residents, the City Council voted 6 to 1 to block Karis Critical\u2019s plan for a data center near Naperville and Warrenville roads. The Daily Herald\nreported\nthat neighbors warned the\nfacility\nwould overwhelm local power infrastructure, generate constant noise and introduce diesel emissions into an area surrounded by housing. Most council members ultimately agreed.\n\u201cAll the neighbors have been exhausted by this process,\u201d said James Butt, a nearby resident and technologist who has consulted for data center operators. \u201cI know that everyone is relieved.\u201d\nThe site sits amid a growing cluster of residential neighborhoods, a key factor in the council\u2019s decision. Several members argued that while data centers are increasingly essential infrastructure, this location was a poor fit \u2014 particularly as Illinois grapples with grid constraints and surging demand from hyperscale users.\nCouncil member Supna Jain cited uncertainty around future electricity availability and cost, noting that neither ComEd\u2019s system nor the city\u2019s municipal utility has unlimited capacity. Approving the project, she said, could crowd out other development along the I-88 corridor or saddle the city with costly upgrades.\nThe developer had already scaled back its ambitions. Naples, Florida-based Karis\nreduced\nthe proposal to a roughly 145,000-square-foot facility and agreed to cap power usage at 36 megawatts under a negotiated development agreement. That translated to about 24 megawatts of information technology load, according to project attorney Russ Whitaker. The revision also cut the number of diesel generators on site from 24 to 16, 12 of them dedicated to backup power.\nFive data centers have already gone up in Aurora, with five more entitled and two new applications filed just before the moratorium took effect. Developers have\nclustered data centers\nin recent years near O\u2019Hare International Airport, especially in Elk Grove Village, and an office tower in downtown Chicago sold last year to a Virginia company planning to convert it into a 33-megawatt data center.\nWhitaker asked the council to delay a vote so that updated air dispersion modeling could be presented, arguing the reduced scope materially changed emissions assumptions. Mayor Scott Wehrli supported tabling the decision, calling it premature for a project pegged as a half-billion-dollar investment. The effort failed. Wehrli and council member Nate Wilson abstained, while council member Josh McBroom cast the lone vote against rejection.\nThe concerns went beyond\nscale\n. Opponents argued the project conflicted with the city\u2019s own master plan, which envisions medium-density residential development on the property. Council member Ian Holzhauer pointed to Naperville\u2019s housing shortage, suggesting the land could ultimately have more public benefit as homes rather than servers.\nKaris said it is reassessing its options. A spokesperson told the publication that the firm had committed to investing hundreds of millions into a \u201cbest-in-class\u201d facility and is now evaluating other sites across the region.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Instead, the partners are moving forward with a $275 million refinancing that includes nearly $40 million of fresh equity and another $25 million earmarked for future leasing costs, capital improvements and other expenses.\nThe prewar, 470,000-square-foot building was about 37 percent vacant as of October, featuring roughly 200,000 square feet of office space to fill. The retail portion is spoken for: Bergdorf Goodman\u2019s men\u2019s store occupies the base. Upstairs, tenants enjoy Central Park views.\nControl of 745 Fifth changed hands last month when\nRithm acquired Paramount Group\n, which bought the building in 2002 for $263 million. Paramount had previously explored conversion options, part of a broader wave of Midtown landlords testing whether obsolete offices could pencil out as housing.\nRithm declined to spell out why the conversion was shelved, but costs loom large. The city comptroller\u2019s office has pegged the conversion of 750 Third Avenue at $663 per square foot. Applied to 745 Fifth, that kind of pricing would push a resi overhaul north of $300 million.\nInstead, ownership is betting that spectacular views and the building\u2019s Fifth Avenue address \u2014 across from the Plaza Hotel and next door to LVMH\u2019s new tower \u2014 will be enough to pull in tenants willing to pay for prime Midtown space.\nIn a statement, Rithm said it sees \u201cstrong demand for high-quality space\u201d and expressed confidence in the long-term fundamentals of New York\u2019s premier office corridors.\nThat optimism isn\u2019t happening in a vacuum. Manhattan leasing hit 42 million square feet in 2025, the busiest year since before the pandemic, according to Colliers; volume was up 25 percent from 2024.\nWhile large swaths of older office inventory remain distressed, trophy assets in elite locations have been telling a different story.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A Miami projects review board greenlit two workforce and affordable apartment projects that will add nearly 730 units to the city.\nThe urban development review board approved The Cornerstone Group and Brookstone Partners\u2019 plan for 354 units in Little Havana, and Atlantic Pacific Companies\u2019 375 rentals in Overtown.\nThe board only has the power to recommend approval, denial or design tweaks, with the ultimate authority resting with the Miami planning director.\nHere\u2019s more about the planned developments:\nCornerstone, Brookstone workforce rentals in Little Havana\nThe Cornerstone Group and Brookstone Partners\u2019 second attempt at project approval succeeded.\nThe firms, based in Hollywood, plan an eight-story building with 354 apartments at workforce rents on a 2.4-acre site at 805 West Flagler Street in Little Havana. The project will have a roughly 5,000-square-foot retail space for a grocer or pharmacy. A rooftop pooldeck is planned, along with two courtyards spanning 8,000 square feet each, one of them with a dog park.\nThe project failed its first shot at\nUDRB in November\n, prompting Corwil Architects to come back with a redesigned building. Revised renderings show curving balconies, among other changes, with board members largely hailing the tweaks as improvements.\nVice Chair Gia Zapattini said the Flagler Street-facing fa\u00e7ade still needs work.\n\u201cThe goal is really for a pedestrian to not experience an almost 400-foot long fa\u00e7ade,\u201d she said.\nAlberto Cordoves of Corwil Architects said breaking up the massing was the goal in the redesign, and architects can further work on it by adding more glazing.\nBoard member Manuel Gustavo Gallardo argued 5,000 square feet is too small for a grocery store or pharmacy, but the developers\u2019 attorney, Melissa Tapanes Llahues, said this will be a mini-market because demand doesn\u2019t support a full grocery store due to recent additions nearby such as the\nBlock 55\nproject.\nThe board\u2019s approval came with conditions to further break up the fa\u00e7ade fronting Flagler Street, study other types of balcony railings, especially for the units on the ground floor and facing the courtyards, and provide more details of the landscaping.\nAtlantic Pacific Companies\u2019 Culmer Place V in Overtown\nAtlantic Pacific Companies scored approval for the second phase of its Culmer Place affordable housing project in Miami\u2019s Overtown, despite some board members\u2019 concerns with the design.\nMiami-based Atlantic Pacific plans the seven-story Culmer Place V project with\n375 apartments\n, including 94 units reserved for \u201cextremely low income\u201d residents and the majority for households earning up to 80 percent of the area median income.\nMiami-Dade\u2019s annual AMI is $87,200, according to the Florida Housing Finance Corporation, though that will be updated in the spring.\nThe development adds to the recently completed 239 affordable units on the site, at 801 Northwest Seventh Avenue. Atlantic Pacific received temporary certificates of occupancy for the first two buildings and the amenity building late last year, said Nicole Wolfe, an attorney for the developer.\nThe firm is leasing the nearly 14-acre site, formerly home to a public housing complex, from Miami-Dade under a 99-year term. Culmer Place is constructed in phases in part to avoid displacement of existing residents. Redevelopments of Miami-Dade public housing generally give renters the right of first refusal for the new apartments.\nCulmer Place V also is designed by Corwil Architects. Board members brought up similar issues with the design of this project as they did with Cornerstone and Brookstone\u2019s Little Havana building.\n\u201cThere\u2019s another 376-foot long building, and I have a hard time seeing the separation. I know you changed the material, but I see a giant 400-foot long concrete block,\u201d Zapattini said. \u201cIt\u2019s very repetitive.\u201d\nIn his presentation, Sergio Rodriguez of Corwil said \u201cspecial attention was given to the design of the fa\u00e7ades \u2026 [adding] vertical and horizontal bands working in conjunction.\u201d\nBoard members brought up issues with the lack of natural lighting in portions of the building and long internal corridors and walkways from the garage, which could pose difficulties for elderly residents.\nThe board approved the project with several conditions for tweaks, including to break up the fa\u00e7ade, add glazing at the end of a hallway adjacent to the garage, including landscaping and benches, add double doors at some of the pedestrian building entrances, create more privacy for some of the ground-floor units and add signage to the site.\nCorwil Architects\u2019 representative said designers are amenable to those changes.\nLive Local Act projects can skip UDRB\nTwo Live Local Act projects on the agenda skipped the board hearing, after the developers and the city attorney\u2019s office determined a review by such a committee isn\u2019t necessary under state law.\nThe Florida Legislature approved the Live Local Act in 2023, tweaking it in subsequent years. It allows developers to bypass public hearings and obtain administrative approvals if they designate 40 percent of units for households earning no more than 120 percent of the AMI.\nCrescent Heights\nplans\n1,307 units\nwith a 50-story tower housing 780 market-rate apartments and a 28-story building with the 527 workforce apartments. The project is proposed for the site at 3180 Biscayne Boulevard, a few blocks north of Crescent\u2019s\nForma\napartment tower completed last year.\nAlso, an entity with ties to Brickell-based Momentum Real Estate Partners wants to develop a 12-story Live Local project with 195 units and nearly 4,000 square feet of ground-floor retail.\n",

        "content": "A heavy equipment firm scored approval for its headquarters on more than 200 acres outside Miami-Dade County\u2019s Urban Development Boundary, including paving over wetlands in a plan to develop a headquarters.\nCounty planning staff members opposed the proposal and recommended commissioners deny the application, which has riled environmentalists decrying the loss of wetlands necessary for flood mitigation.\nMiami-Dade is generally a developer-friendly county where officials for years have accommodated project proposals. But the county has its limits, drawing a\nhard line\nagainst construction outside the urban development boundary. That invisible line was drawn to restrain suburban sprawl onto wetlands, farmland and open land, and toward the Everglades to the west and Biscayne National Park to the east.\nHeavy equipment firm Kelly Tractor wants to move its headquarters outside the boundary, including building over about 160 acres of wetlands near Sweetwater and opening a facility where it would sell, store and repair machinery, WLRN\nreported\n. Kelly Tractor, based in Doral, owns more than 245 acres outside the UDB.\nMiami-Dade commissioners on Thursday voted in favor of the proposal for a text amendment to label the site as \u201cMIA Transportation and Infrastructure Support Area,\u201d imposing several conditions for wetland mitigation and for the project site plan to come back as an administrative site plan application.\nCounty planners\u2019 recommendation for denial says Kelly Tractor failed to show why it can\u2019t expand at its current Doral site and why it needs the UDB expansion, pointing out the county has about 700 acres of land for industrial development within the boundary.\nBesides that, taxpayers would be on the hook for water, sewer and other infrastructure expansions for the project, and Kelly Tractor\u2019s filing showed no mitigation plan for the wetlands, which are considered top tier in the county.\nKelly Tractor, which didn\u2019t respond to the outlet\u2019s request for comment, said the project is necessary for infrastructure projects such as highways and prisons.\nAn attorney for Kelly Tractor said at the meeting the firm has outgrown its current space and the county has no site within the UDB large enough for the firm\u2019s expansion.\nWetlands \u200a\u201care very functional. They\u2019re part of the solution for flooding for [Miami-Dade County],\u201d Laura Reynolds, science director at Hold the Line Coalition, told WLRN. \u201c\u200aSweetwater floods all the time and, these are the things that should be considered when we make these decisions.\u201d\nOver the years, Miami-Dade has taken up other applications for development outside the UDB, many of them proving contentious.\nLennar, the second biggest homebuilder nationwide, is partnering with developer Ed Easton and homebuilding consultant Bill Albers on the proposal for\nCity Park\nwith 7,800 homes and 2.4 million square feet of commercial space, including schools, and public parks outside the UDB. While proponents say this \u201ccity within a city\u201d will be self-contained, opponents argue it would worsen congested traffic headed to employment hubs. The project is expected to come up for a vote later this year.\nDevelopers Stephen Blumenthal and Jose Hevia scored commission approval in 2022 for their\nSouth Dade Logistics &amp; Technology District\non 379 acres outside the UDB. The vote came after five tries in front of commissioners, with the developers agreeing to concessions, including roughly halving the project size. South Dade Logistics was later\nquashed in court\nin 2024.\u00a0\u00a0\u2013\nLidia Dinkova\n",

This first phase of the project will include a proposed 450 apartments on an 8.6-acre stretch between 2101 and 2201 Donley Drive, according to\ncity documents\n. It is less than a mile from the Q2 Stadium, home to Austin FC. The entire mixed-use development also will include land across the street, from 2111 to 2115 Kramer Lane. TDLR filings are preliminary and subject to change.\nTurnbridge proposed 450 multifamily units on the 8.6-acre stretch of Donley Drive and persuaded the city of Austin to\nrezone the area\nfor tall, dense development last year. Currently, four commercial buildings operate on the property. Under the city\u2019s new zoning, the land can accommodate mixed-use residential construction up to 491 feet high, or about 45 stories.\nHowever, the developer\u2019s submitted plan for 2101-2201 Donley Drive describes a wood-framed, six-story multifamily building. The ground floor will include retail elements. The multifamily building will have an adjacent seven-story precast parking garage, according to the filing.\nA Turnbridge associate named in the filing did not immediately respond for comment.\nTurnbridge acquired the acreage, now called the Q2 Assemblage, between 2019 and 2020 for an undisclosed price as the Q2 Stadium was taking shape. The stadium opened in 2021, coinciding with the launch of\nAustin FC\n.\nThe development will be about two miles from The Domain, a residential, office and retail center in Northwest Austin. Companies that\nlease\nor operate at The Domain include\nIndeed\n,\nIKEA\n,\nWeWork\nand\nPayPal\n.Another developer,\nBrandywine Realty Trust\n, plans to build a mixed-use campus at 11501 Burnet Road, across from The Domain, after IBM vacates it next year.\n",

The project will include 39 suites and more than 83,000 square feet of meeting and event space, capped by a 10,000-square-foot event barn.\nThe Sheraton is\nslated for implosion\nin early June, with construction on the new hotel expected to begin later this summer. Loews projects an opening in late 2028 or early 2029. Total investment is expected to exceed $500 million, Loews Hotels President and CEO Alex Tisch told the outlet.\nThe project is designed to capitalize on growing demand for hotel rooms and large-scale meeting space in Arlington, which has increasingly positioned itself as a meetings and events hub \u2014 not just a game-day destination. Tisch said proximity to Dallas, Fort Worth and DFW International Airport has helped lure corporate events, including from Fortune 500 companies.\n\u201cWe bought the Sheraton property thinking that there may be a greater opportunity in the future,\u201d Tisch told the publication, calling the site one of the last major development opportunities in the district.\nThe redevelopment will free up roughly 13 acres. A new parking garage will serve the hotel and surrounding venues, though only about half the land is slated for the hotel and garage. The remaining acreage is unprogrammed for now, though Tisch said the company has zoning and financing flexibility for future development.\nThe city of\nArlington\nis backing the project through a public-private partnership approved by City Council in late 2023. The city is expected to contribute $40 million toward development costs and provide more than $57 million in grants over 25 years if performance benchmarks are met, according to the outlet.\nLoews\nwill front the initial capital.\nAmericana by Loews takes its name from the late, iconic Americana Hotel in Bal Harbour, Florida, a Loews landmark that opened in 1956.\nThe site sits less than a mile from Loews\u2019 recently opened\nArlington Hotel &amp; Convention Center\n, an 888-room property that opened in early 2024 between Globe Life Field and Choctaw Stadium. Loews also opened the $150 million, 300-room Live! by Loews Hotel in 2019.\nWhen complete, Loews\u2019 Arlington campus will total nearly 1,700 rooms and more than 374,000 square feet of meeting space.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A mixed-use project near San Antonio\u2019s River Walk, years in the planning process, is now moving forward.\nMcCombs Enterprises landed a favorable zoning change Tuesday for its 6-acre site at\n326 West Jones Avenue\nand Camden Street, clearing another hurdle for a dense, multi-building development along the northern stretch of the San Antonio River. The San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\nthat the city\u2019s Zoning Commission unanimously approved an infill designation for the property, allowing multiple structures to rise on the site. The item moved through consent without opposition.\nThe San Antonio-based firm, founded by late billionaire Red McCombs, had previously said in 2023 that it was partnering with Denver-based developer Realberry \u2014 formerly known as McWhinney \u2014 on the project. A revised site plan filed with the city envisions eight buildings totaling more than 1 million square feet, marking a significant expansion from earlier concepts.\nWhile individual building heights weren\u2019t specified in the latest filing, the plan sets a maximum height of 15 stories. A December version showed a range of three to 17 stories. The project will have up to 390 apartments, roughly 265,500 square feet of office space, 57,400 square feet of food and beverage and about 58,600 square feet of retail.\nRecords released in 2023 showed an earlier plan called for 325 apartments and just 70,000 square feet of offices, with an estimated development cost of $295 million. The latest iteration points to a much larger project in the River North submarket, which has been steadily filling in with residential, cultural and office projects tied to the Museum Reach extension of the River Walk.\nMcCombs\nbought the property from CPS Energy in 2023 for $29.5 million. The site is expected to leverage a\nmunicipal management district\ncreated by the Texas Legislature that same year, giving the development the ability to levy property taxes and issue bonds to help fund infrastructure and other improvements.\nThe zoning change still needs final approval from the San Antonio City Council at a future meeting.\nThe project adds to a growing downtown San Antonio presence for the McCombs family. The firm is part of the team of developers transforming the 30-story, 240,000-square-foot\nTower Life\noffice tower into affordable apartments at 301 South Saint Mary\u2019s Street.\nIn 2024, the family bought out the ground lease beneath the former Holiday Inn at 318 West Cesar Chavez Boulevard, gaining full control of the 4.5-acre property near Hemisfair. The late Red McCombs helped develop the hotel ahead of Hemisfair \u201968.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",
