        "content": "Cresa went outside traditional brokerage ranks for its next chief executive, hiring Ray Anderson as CEO while the occupier-focused firm ramps up acquisitions, recruiting and technology investment.\nAnderson succeeds Tod Lickerman, ending a\nCEO search\nthat began last year, Bisnow first\nreported\n. Lickerman remains on Cresa\u2019s board and will stay involved in recruiting as well as mergers and acquisitions, while Anderson steps into the top job as the Chicago-based\ntenant representation firm\nlooks to compound growth after a flurry of recent deals.\nAnderson arrives from EY-Parthenon, Ernst &amp; Young\u2019s strategy and consulting arm, where he was a senior partner advising large public and private companies on value creation, enterprise transformation and mergers and acquisitions. Before that, he spent nearly a decade at Huron Consulting Group working on restructurings, turnarounds and transactions.\n\u201cRecruiting is going to be very important, and we\u2019re going to continue to be very aggressive,\u201d Anderson told the outlet, adding that M&amp;A is \u201csecond nature\u201d to him and will remain a core growth lever.\nCresa\u2019s board chairman, Gary Gregg, said in a news release that Anderson\u2019s background in corporate transformation and dealmaking fits squarely with the firm\u2019s occupier-advocacy mission.\nIn October, the\nbrokerage acquired\nDallas-based Fischer, its largest competitor focused exclusively on occupiers, in what Cresa called the biggest transaction in its three-decade history. The deal reshaped the firm\u2019s business mix, giving it a sizable portfolio management base to complement its traditional deal-focused advisory work.\nThe brokerage has been\nbusy\n, recently acquiring data analytics firm Bluechip Insights, project management shops CMPG, NorthStar Owners Representation and Pacific Program Management, and made targeted senior hires, including building out a data center capital markets and advisory platform, according to the outlet.\nTechnology is also a priority. Fischer brought proprietary portfolio management software that Cresa plans to deploy more broadly, while Anderson will oversee expanded use of artificial intelligence across internal operations and client-facing tools, according to the publication.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about science experiments,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about things that meaningfully improve clients\u2019 work product and brokers\u2019 productivity.\u201d\nWith offices across the US and Canada, Anderson said he plans a months-long listening tour, followed by pursuing more deals.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "California\u2019s proposed billionaire tax isn\u2019t on the ballot yet, but fears about its impact are already mounting.\nSome billionaires are already leaving California to escape the potential tax, though its overall impact\nisn\u2019t expected\nto be catastrophic for the Bay Area or the state, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nIf the tax qualifies for the November ballot and is approved by a majority of California voters, the state would impose a one-time 5 percent tax on more than 200 billionaires residing in California based on their net worth as of Dec. 31.\nGov. Gavin Newsom\nis among the opponents of the measure, saying California\u2019s wealthiest taxpayers would flee the Golden State. Others believe the tax could lead entrepreneurs to shy away from the Bay Area, in turn lowering job growth and chilling housing demand in the region.\nIf the tax passes, some startup founders could launch companies elsewhere out of fear that California could levy another wealth tax in the future. \u201cEveryone assumes they\u2019re going to be a billionaire,\u201d Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s John Young told the Chronicle. But most homebuyers likely won\u2019t experience much impact from the tax, as billionaires have little reason to relocate their companies outside of California, Redfin economists told the Chronicle.\nThe potential \u2014 though unlikely \u2014 departure of many tech companies wouldn\u2019t do much to drive down home prices, as housing supply in the Bay Area faces geographic and regulatory constraints that keep the market highly competitive, according to the Chronicle. The presence of top-tier universities and other large non-tech companies are also expected to uphold a high baseline demand for Bay Area homes.\nBuyers hoping for affordable housing after\nbillionaires\u2019 flight\nwill likely be disappointed, some unnamed industry insiders told the Chronicle. \u201cIt\u2019d have to be a mass exodus,\u201d Adam Touni, a Silicon Valley real estate broker with Compass, said. \u201cAnd moving\u2019s not easy.\u201d\nBillionaire residents hypothetically\nleaving the state\nin droves would affect California\u2019s revenue in the long term, as the top 1 percent of earners in the state have accounted for more than 40 percent of taxes paid by Californians, according to the California Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office. If that revenue took a sizable hit, the state would lack funding for many social services, including affordable housing.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Eliot Spitzer is crossing over to Connecticut for a development project shrouded in mystery.\nSpitzer Enterprises \u2014 the real estate firm helmed by the former governor of New York \u2014 purchased several contiguous parcels close to the Stamford train station, CT Insider\nreported\n. The purchase price was not disclosed and public records didn\u2019t include the purchase prices of 495 Pacific Street and 560 Atlantic Street.\nA representative of Spitzer\u2019s firm confirmed the series of real estate purchases to the outlet and tipped the plan of apartment development, but said little more.\nThe lots \u2014 which are also tied to Garden Street \u2014 were largely demolished before the pandemic, leaving them vacant for years. That could give Spitzer leeway for development. The projects don\u2019t appear on upcoming agendas for the city\u2019s planning and zoning boards.\nSpitzer could not immediately be reached for further comment by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nDon Corbo, who brokered the sale to Spitzer, pointed to the importance of the \u201ctransit-oriented zone\u201d and said architectural plans were in the works for a \u201cbig\u201d finished project.\nSpitzer\u2019s never shown any fear of a large project, though. Or a large fight.\nIn 2023, Spitzer\nreceived the green light\nfrom the Landmarks Preservation Commission to demolish an existing property at 985 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan to develop a 19-story luxury condo building with 26 units.\nWhile the property was able to be built as-of-right, the co-op board of the neighboring property filed an adverse possession lawsuit over a pit on the south side of Spitzer\u2019s property, arguing that it had been a storage site for more than a decade.\nMore recently, Miki Naftali agreed to buy Spitzer\u2019s rental tower at 800 Fifth Avenue on the Upper East Side for\nmore than $800 million\n.\nDemand for rental space is strong in Stamford, which is along the Metro North, but also has its own office and retail corridors. Rents are expected to rise by 4 percent this year in Stamford, according to a recent report from Marcus &amp; Millichap.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Clipper Equity\u2019s riverfront residential tower landed long-term financing from JPMorgan Chase and Citibank, and Madison Realty Capital scored a bridge loan for its 473-unit multifamily development Greenpoint Central.\nEven office made a cameo, with JEMB Realty securing fresh debt as part of a recapitalization at 1 Willoughby Square in Downtown Brooklyn.\nHere are December\u2019s top five outer borough loans.\nCarlyle cash | $486M | multiple neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens\nWalker &amp; Dunlop\noriginated a $485.6 million Freddie Mac loan to refinance a sprawling multifamily portfolio owned by Greenbrook Partners and Carlyle Group. The fresh financing for the 262-townhouse portfolio spanning multiple Brooklyn and Queens neighborhoods replaced a $500 million loan from Invesco. Walker &amp; Dunlop\u2019s Matthew Wallach, Stephen West and Walker Layne arranged the 10-year floating-rate loan.\nCarlyle teamed up with Greenbrook in 2021\nand stitched together a half-billion-dollar portfolio of small apartment buildings that fall into the city\u2019s 2A/2B tax designation, which limits increases on real estate taxes to no more than 8 percent a year. These properties have no more than 10 units and tend to be mostly free-market, avoiding the severe restrictions\nimposed on owners by the 2019 rent stabilization law.\nRiverfront refi | $405M | Greenpoint\nJPMorgan Chase and Citibank\nprovided a $405 million loan to refinance Clipper Equity\u2019s Tower 77 in Greenpoint. The fresh financing for a 746-unit complex at 77 Commercial Street converted last year\u2019s\n$430 million bridge loan\ninto a five-year term. Clipper landed the bridge loan last May, months after topping out construction on the three-building complex. That debt retired a $386 million construction loan provided by the Bank of China and SL Green shortly into the pandemic. The 799,000-square-foot property, unspooled along the East River, was designed by CentraRuddy Architecture. There are 230 affordable units, as well as 40,000 square feet of amenities, including a pool, a sauna, a fitness center, a tennis court, a game room and a pet spa.\nMultifamily moolah | $285M | Greenpoint\nTPG Real Estate Credit\nprovided a $285\u202fmillion loan for Madison Realty Capital\u2019s 473-unit multifamily development Greenpoint Central. The bridge loan for 65 and 75 Dupont Street replaces a $180 million construction loan from Elliott Investment Management. Located on a Superfund site once belonging to a\nplastics factory\n, the development includes studio, one\u2011 and two\u2011bedroom apartments, 30 percent of them affordable. Madison took ownership of the troubled project in 2021 after Bo Jin Zhu\u2019s DuPont Street Developers filed for bankruptcy.\nBlackstone bucks | $269M | Forest Hills\nWells Fargo\nprovided a $269 million loan to Blackstone for a sprawling multifamily apartment complex and an adjacent office building in Forest Hills. The fresh financing for 104-20 and 104-70 Queens Boulevard replaced a $269 million loan from Newmark. Blackstone bought the 1,327-unit three-tower apartment complex, known as Parker Towers, and the adjacent office building in 2018 for $475 million.\nJEMB juice | $125M | Downtown Brooklyn\nDeutsche Bank\nprovided a $125 million loan for the lower floors of JEMB Realty\u2019s office tower at 1 Willoughby Square. The new mortgage was part of a complex transaction that included new equity and the division of the 35-story tower into condos. Among the latest round of investors is\nEdmond Safra, a member of the Safra banking family\n, alongside Adnane Mousannif\u2019s AVRS Partners and KSR Capital principals Abraham Kassin and Morris Sabbagh. The Deutsche loan includes a $75 million A-note sold into a CMBS conduit. The sponsors also kicked in $68.5 million in fresh equity, according to Fitch, used largely to retire $179.5 million of existing debt, cover closing costs and seed a nearly $10 million reserve.\n",

        "content": "CGI Merchant Group is catching zero breaks, as its South Florida portfolio unravels under the crushing weight of debt woes.\nIn the latest trouble, the firm lost the 15-story 550 Biltmore office building, at 550 Biltmore Way, in Coral Gables.\nMiami-Dade Circuit Judge Abby Cynamon issued a judgment last month for $61.3 million in favor of lender SDI Biltmore Borrower, an entity tied to Coral Gables-based Secured Debt Investments, ordering a foreclosure sale March 23. The amount breaks down to $49.2 million owed in principal for a 2021 loan, $12.1 million in default interest and $68,000 for attorney fees and for other expenses.\nBut CGI Merchant already had lost the building in a Uniform Commercial Code proceeding before the judicial foreclosure, according to the lender.\n550 Biltmore, completed in 1986 on a 1-acre site, has a Mediterranean Revival style that\u2019s common in Coral Gables. CGI Merchant paid\n$54.4 million\nfor the building in 2019, borrowing $46.5 million from MSD Partners (now called BDT &amp; MSD Partners). In 2021, New York-based Cerberus Capital Management refinanced the loan, bumping it to $48.7 million, records show.\nCGI Merchant\u2019s affiliate, CGI Fund I Biltmore, defaulted on the loan when it matured in May 2024, according to a Miami-Dade Circuit Court complaint filed in August.\nCerberus first filed a UCC foreclosure on the building in late 2024. A UCC foreclosure is generally much quicker than a judicial proceeding and is a foreclosure on the interest in the entity that owns an asset, instead of on the property itself.\nCerberus assigned the loan to Secured Debt Investments in May, records show. Secured Debt Investments finalized the UCC foreclosure, essentially acquiring the interest in CGI Fund I Biltmore but then filed the August judicial foreclosure suit in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, according to Secured Debt Investments\u2019 Orlando Garcia. The judicial proceeding is done to ensure there are no liens or other issues with the property, he said.\nSecured Debt Investments plans to submit a credit bid at the foreclosure sale and also to see who else bids, Garcia added.\nCGI representatives and Thomas didn\u2019t return requests to comment for this story.\nSince 2024, the firm has been bleeding assets as landlords nationwide felt the sting from elevated interest rates. Landlords in South Florida also were hit with skyrocketing insurance and other increases in overhead and maintenance expenses. The higher interest rates translated to larger debt obligations for landlords with floating-rate loans and no loan interest caps, and it made refinancing for maturing debt more expensive.\nIn\nprevious interviews,\nThomas said he was diligently working to refinance some of his debt, saying he had capital and equity lined up for some of his properties and was working to try to take back title to buildings he already lost to lenders.\nAt the time of Cerberus\u2019 UCC foreclosure, a CGI representative said in a statement the firm \u201cis working with all parties for a mutually positive resolution.\u201d\nIn December, CGI lost its 140-key Gabriel South Beach hotel in a court-ordered sale, with Park Central Lender acquiring the property for a $77,800 bid, according to court records. Park Central Lender, which had assumed the property\u2019s loan from Deutsche Bank, filed for foreclosure in July over the\n$69 million\nloan.\nOn the same August day in 2024, CGI lost both the 129-key\nGabriel Downtown Miami hotel\nand the Waldorf Astoria Washington DC, which the firm had bought in 2022 from the Trump Organization.\nCGI has staved off foreclosure on some of its properties, selling 65 commercial units at Ten Aragon Condominium in Coral Gables last year for\n$28.5 million\n. This allowed it to pay off most of the allegedly delinquent $24.2 million loan on the units that were in foreclosure.\nCGI Merchant sold its five-property Nexus co-working office portfolio in Palm Beach and Martin counties to Coral Springs-based commercial real estate investment firm TMT Properties for\n$31 million\nin November. TMT has a licensing agreement to continue operating the buildings under the Nexus name. At the time of the deal, three of the properties had loans that entered special servicing in January of last year due to delinquent debt payments, according to Morningstar Credit.\n",

The Learning Experience franchisees lease the spaces from separate landlords.\nAll four future Learning Experience sites are currently under construction with undeclared addresses, a Learning Experience spokesperson told CO. The\nMenifee\nlocation will rise on a currently vacant parcel next to 28881 Newport Road, the spokesperson said.\nIn addition to its growth in Southern California, The Learning Experience is expanding on the East Coast with eight new locations in\nMaryland\nand northern Virginia over the next two years. Like in SoCal, those spaces will each span approximately 10,000 square feet.\nWhen deciding where to plant a flag, The Learning Experience\u2019s development team analyzes local population, traffic patterns, population density of children ages 6 and under within certain areas and average household incomes in the area, a company spokesperson said. After settling on a market to set up shop, The Learning Experience will establish both company-owned and franchise sites, with franchisees signing 15-year licensing deals with the firm.\nThe new Learning Experience centers in Southern California and the East Coast are part of the company\u2019s plans to add more than 150 new locations to its portfolio over the next three years. The company currently operates more than 450 locations across 30 states and the U.K.\nThe U.S. child care industry was estimated to generate about $65 billion in 2024, and is forecast to hit nearly $110 billion by 2033, according to a\nreport\nlast year by Grand View Research cited by CO.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A local development team is aiming to push Lincoln Park\u2019s skyline higher, proposing a 28-story apartment building in a pocket of the neighborhood that\u2019s steadily attracting denser projects.\nA venture of Chicago-based Honore Properties and Elmhurst-based Peerless Development is seeking city approval for a 340-unit rental building at 1415 North Dayton Street. The site is currently occupied by a four-story loft office building the developers initially hoped to convert, before switching to a full teardown and a plan to build a high-rise, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe change came after the team determined the building\u2019s layout made an adaptive reuse impractical. Instead, they stitched together air rights from three nearby properties to unlock far greater density \u2014 a process Honore founder\nMichael Shenouda\ntold the outlet was \u201cquite the puzzle.\u201d\nIf the Chicago City Council signs off in March, the roughly $145 million project would move quickly. The\ndevelopers\nplan to demolish the existing structure within months, start construction this fall and complete the first apartments in spring 2028.\nThe site sits near the North Branch of the Chicago River, an area that has seen a wave of residential proposals since the city loosened zoning restrictions in what was once a largely industrial stretch.\nNew housing\nis increasingly complementing the retail-heavy Clybourn Corridor, though large developable parcels in\nLincoln Park\nremain scarce, according to the outlet.\nThat scarcity is part of the wager, as downtown rents jumped last year amid a thin development pipeline, and popular neighborhoods like Lincoln Park have seen relatively little new supply compared to the West Loop.\n\u201cSupply in Chicago is already constrained,\u201d Shenouda said. \u201cLincoln Park in particular, there hasn\u2019t been a lot of new development.\u201d\nThe glass tower would rise from a six-story masonry podium housing amenities, including a fitness center, coworking space and a courtyard. About 80 percent of the apartments would be market-rate, with the remaining 20 percent \u2014 68 units \u2014 set aside as affordable under the city\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance, according to the site plans. Market-rate rents are projected at $4 per square foot to $5 per square foot.\nThe developers paid nearly $3.5 million for the Dayton Street property in 2024, records show.\nPeerless CEO Michael Cordaro told the outlet the team\u2019s low land basis and unique setup offer confidence. The project would mark Honore and Peerless\u2019 first ground-up high-rise after collaborating on several mid-rise conversions across the city.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Fort Worth\n\u2019s public hospital system, JPS Health Network, partnered with\nNRP Group\nto turn an old parking lot into an apartment complex.\nJPS formed a\npublic facility corporation\nto be a partner in the development of Thrive on Crawford, a 67-unit affordable housing project at 1310 Crawford Street, according to Cleveland-based NRP Group\u2019s Max Whipple, the firm\u2019s vice president of development. The recently completed project is adjacent to JPS\u2019 Southside Fort Worth campus.\nJPS owns the land the project is built on, and NRP Group leases the ground. Of the property\u2019s 67 units, seven are reserved for people making 30 percent of area median income; 24 are set aside for folks earning 50 percent AMI; and 29 are reserved for renters making 60 percent AMI. Seven units will be offered at market rate.\nThe project is part of the state\u2019s 9 percent housing tax credit program. The Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs selects projects for the competitive program, which provides equity for affordable housing development. The project also received financing from the Near Southside tax increment financing zone.\nThrive on Crawford cost about $21.8 million to develop, and the tax credits provided $15 million of the financing, Whipple said.\nThe pair teamed up in 2020 for the project, which opened in January. The pandemic got JPS leadership thinking about employees\u2019 commute times and sparked interest in providing affordable housing options for employees, Whipple said.\nNRP Group has developed similar projects in Ohio, partnering with Metro Health and Cleveland Clinic, Whipple said. To his knowledge, this project is the first of its kind in the state of Texas, but the developer has plans to utilize the public facility corporation program more widely in Texas. It is\npartnering with Austin Independent School District\non a $142 million, 674-unit multifamily project on property owned by the school district at 4900 Gonzales Street, Whipple said.\nThrive on Crawford is just one example of a hospital system becoming more involved in Texas real estate. On the office side, health care institutions are taking advantage of office distress by purchasing office properties they plan to use. For example,\nUniversity Health purchased\na 143,00-square-foot office building 6200 Northwest Parkway on San Antonio\u2019s Northwest Side in 2024 for $28 million or $196 per square foot.\n",

        "content": "San Antonio logged a stiff year-over-year drop in new home listings in December \u2014 the largest among the nation\u2019s biggest housing markets \u2014 a sign that would-be sellers are blinking as buyer demand thins and homes sit idle on the market.\nThe metro saw 2,120 new residential listings in December, down about 20 percent from a year earlier, according to Redfin data. That was the steepest decline among the top 50 U.S. metros and followed another weak month in November, when San Antonio ranked third nationwide with a 17.8 percent drop, the San Antonio Express-News\nreported\n.\nNationwide, new listings slipped a far milder 4.9 percent over the same period, highlighting how sellers in the Alamo City are retreating.\nThe pullback comes as San Antonio grapples with one of the\nmost lopsided housing markets\nin the country. As of December, the metro had 102.5 percent more sellers than buyers, the fifth-largest imbalance among major markets, according to Redfin. Many would-be buyers \u2014 especially first-timers \u2014 are\nopting to rent\nrather than lock in today\u2019s mortgage rates.\n\u201cThe rental market is quite appealing right now,\u201d Redfin economist Daryl Fairweather told the outlet, pointing to\nstable rents\nand borrowing costs that remain a hurdle, despite modest declines. San Antonio\u2019s large veteran population, which often relies on low down payment loans, is particularly sensitive to rate increases, she added.\nPeer cities across the Lone Star State aren\u2019t faring much better. Austin posted the nation\u2019s biggest seller-buyer imbalance in December, with 128 percent more sellers than buyers, alongside an 11.4 percent drop in new listings.\nDallas\nalso landed near the top of the imbalance rankings, with 86.8 percent more sellers than buyers, a gap fueled in part by years of aggressive homebuilding, according to the publication.\nThe imbalance is stretching out selling timelines. San Antonio homes spent a median of 99 days on the market in December, up 17 days from a year earlier \u2014 the second-largest increase among major metros, according to Redfin. Only Houston saw a bigger jump. In Austin, listings lingered even longer, at 106 days.\nSales are feeling the strain. In November, San Antonio recorded the largest year-over-year decline in closed sales nationwide, plunging from 2,683 in November 2024 to 2,082 closings in November 2025, or nearly 25 percent, according to Redfin.\nHigher mortgage rates remain a key choke point. More than half of U.S. mortgage holders are locked into rates at or below 4 percent, the Wall Street Journal reported, while 30-year rates hovered around 6.1 percent in late January, according to Freddie Mac. That gap is keeping many owners on the sidelines.\nThere is a glimmer of momentum, however, as pending sales in San Antonio ticked up 1.1 percent in December, year-over-year.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "One of New York\u2019s top\nbankruptcy\nattorneys Jonathan Pasternak has received a three-year suspension from practicing law in New York\u2019s Southern District Court.\nPasternak, of the law firm Davidoff Hutcher &amp; Citron, was suspended by the U.S. District Court of New York\u2019s Southern District, related to receiving $260,000 in undisclosed payments from controversial real estate investor Sam Sprei during a bankruptcy case.\nPasternak admitted to using most of the proceeds from Sprei to purchase a house.\nPasternak is a go-to bankruptcy attorney for mid-market dealmakers. His past clients included entities tied to\nYitzhak Tessler\n,\nJeff Simpson of Arch Companies\nand Steven Ostad.\nPasternak was working for the law firm DelBello Donnellan Weingarten Wise &amp; Wiederkehr at the time of the incidents leading to his suspension. He joined Davidoff Hutcher &amp; Citron in 2019.\nDespite the suspension, Pasternak remains employed at Davidoff Hutcher &amp; Citron and is allowed to practice in other courts.\n\u201cAll of the events occurred well before he was employed with us,\u201d said Larry Hutcher, a founding partner of Davidoff Hutcher &amp; Citron. \u201cThere has been no question about his integrity with us.\u201d\nHutcher noted that Pasternak is a \u201cgood lawyer\u201d who \u201cmade one mistake\u201d in a multi-decade career.\nAt the center of Pasternak\u2019s troubles is a contentious bankruptcy of a medical office property at\u00a0261 East 78th Street, according to an opinion issued by a grievances committee for New York\u2019s Southern District.\nThe owner of the property, Lee Moncho, hired Pasternak as his attorney to put the property into bankruptcy after it faced foreclosure from its lender MB Financial.\nDuring that process, Pasternak suggested to Moncho that he reach out to Sprei about serving as the funder of the bankruptcy plan. By early 2014, Moncho\u2019s bankruptcy plan was approved by the court. The property was sold to a company majority owned by Sprei.\nBut Pasternak never disclosed to his client or the court about his other deals with Sprei.\nSprei had previously offered to pay Pasternak a finder\u2019s fee for bankruptcy deals. In the case of the 261 East 78th Street bankruptcy, Sprei would also pay Pasternak after reaching certain milestones in the bankruptcy process. This included the court\u2019s approval of the bankruptcy plan.\nBetween September 2013 and February 2014, Sprei sent over four payments to Pasternak totaling $260,000.\nSprei made his largest payment when the bankruptcy plan was confirmed by the court on February 28, 2014. On that day, Sprei hand-delivered a $200,000 check to Pasternak, according to the grievances committee.\nFor years, Pasternak never disclosed these payments to his client Moncho, his law firm, or to the bankruptcy court, the U.S. trustee\u2019s office or the IRS, according to the Grievance Committee.\nMoncho filed a malpractice suit against Pasternak and others in 2017, claiming Pasternak negligently introduced him and encouraged him to do business with Sprei and his business partner Chaim Miller.\nA year later, an ethics counsel for Pasternak\u2019s law firm DelBello Donnellan Weingarten Wise &amp; Wiederkehr conducted an internal investigation and sent a letter to the bankruptcy judge admitting Pasternak accepted a $25,000 payment.\nBut Pasternak was less forthcoming about the other payments, according to the grievance committee. He had claimed his counsel disclosed the $200,000 payment to the U.S. Trustee in 2018, but the trustee overseeing the bankruptcy denied that Pasternak\u2019s counsel ever made the disclosure.\nThe grievance committee claims Pasternak only disclosed the $200,000 payment when the payment came to light during the discovery process as part of the lawsuit brought by Moncho.\nPasternak submitted a declaration on November 7, 2025, admitting to wrongdoing and taking responsibility for violating the court\u2019s rules. He consented to the three-year suspension.\nPasternak\u2019s suspension begins on February 9. He did not return a request for comment. An attorney for Sprei also did not return a request for comment.\nFor the better part of a decade, Sprei and his former partner\nChaim Miller\nbecame known for the lengthy legal battles with creditors and investors. Sprei was tasked with finding deals for Miller, but now he appears to be on his own. In August 2024, Sprei\npurchased\na 41-unit rental property from Madison Realty Capital.\n",

Open accessways, doors, roofs are open, boilers haven\u2019t been serviced, sometimes there\u2019s no heat, tons of water intrusion,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody is angry [because of] the deferred maintenance. Now we\u2019ve got to make friends with everybody.\u201d\nMaking his job tougher, he\u2019s not the first stranger to have come knocking on tenants\u2019 doors.\n\u201cSome of these old landlords, they\u2019ve sold their collection rights to somebody else,\u201d Cafiero said. \u201cSo now you have three or four different guys coming in to collect rent saying they\u2019re the new manager. They\u2019re collecting cash. Now we come along and [the tenants] say, \u2018Who are you?\u2019\u201d\nIt would help if he had a list of tenants\u2019 names, but often the landlord doesn\u2019t turn over those records. So Cafiero tries to tag along with an inspector from the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.\n\u201cIf I introduce myself with HPD, I come in with credibility,\u201d the receiver said.\nBut often, that\u2019s not possible. So Cafiero and his staff also come with court orders,\ncompany ID tags\nand body cameras.\nA lot of the buildings he services are in Williamsburg and Borough Park. \u201cProbably 40 percent of my population is Spanish speaking,\u201d said Cafiero, adding that the buildings also have many African tenants.\nCommunication with tenants can be challenging. \u201cBut when you show them a court order,\u201d he said, \u201cthey see it\u2019s an official document. You start to have a little more faith.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nState Sen. Brian Kavanagh, who chairs the upper chamber\u2019s housing committee,\ntold Politico\nhe doesn\u2019t expect the legislature to change 485x this year to solve the\n99-unit problem\n(which comes as\nno surprise to me\n). The senator denied that the wage floor and associated risk triggered by 485x projects of 100 or more units are the reason developers are building so few of them. Rather, he blamed high interest rates and the fact that developers are busy doing office-to-residential conversions and finishing 421a projects. Does that ring true? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Cynthia Allison Malkin, the sister of Empire State Realty Trust CEO Tony Malkin, is married to U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut. Their engagement, when the bride-to-be was a senior at Harvard University and Blumenthal was 35, was\ncovered\nby the New York Times in 1981. \u201cMiss Malkin Plans Bridal\u201d was the headline.\nElsewhere\u2026\nIn the arcane world of New York rent regulation, three-bedroom apartments have lower rents, on average, than one-bedroom apartments, according to the New York Apartment Association.\nFrom a housing policy or economics perspective, that makes no sense whatsoever. But if you know the history of rent stabilization in New York, it makes perfect sense.\nLarge, low-rent units are incredibly valuable to tenants, so people keep them in the family for decades. Under the previous rent regulation regime, low turnover for a given apartment meant its rent grew exceptionally slowly.\nHigh turnover did the opposite: Vacancy allowed for a 20 percent rent hike plus the opportunity to make improvements and raise the rent commensurately.\nAll that changed with the new rent law of 2019, but the inversely proportional rent discrepancy between large and small apartments remains to this day. In fact, it\u2019s locked in.\nOn social media, the NYAA\u2019s Kenny Burgos\nhighlighted\na unit vacant since 2022 that needs more than $200,000 in renovations but has a legal rent of $815.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$11.8 million\nfor a 3,008-square-foot resale condominium at 212 Fifth Avenue in Flatiron. J. Chris Sousa with Sousa Real Estate had the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was $22.25 million for\n242 Elizabeth Street\nand\n236 Elizabeth Street\nfor a combined 12 units and 14,450 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$23 million\nfor a 3,547-square-foot condominium at 50 West 66th Street on the Upper West Side. Janice Chang with Douglas Elliman has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 43,937-square-foot, 10-story, 89-unit mixed-use project at 311 East 148th Street in Mott Haven. Nikolai Katz filed the permit on behalf of developer Joel Guttman.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Aston Martin Residences developer\nGerm\u00e1n Coto\nis accused of siphoning millions of dollars from condo owners, according to a bombshell lawsuit being reported for the first time by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nCoto is accused of running \u201can immense shell game\u201d via condo association contracts to vendors with close ties to Coto.\nThe 300 Biscayne Boulevard Way Condo Association sued Coto and a web of his business entities, as well as his mother and associates who allegedly helped him defraud the association before unit owners took over the board.\nThe complaint, filed in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, accuses the developer and his alleged cohorts of self-dealing, fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of Florida\u2019s Condominium Act. The association claims the alleged scheme left the building with incomplete records, misappropriated funds and long-term financial harm.\nThe lawsuit is seeking more than $5 million in damages.\nThe condo association hired lawyers and forensic accountants \u201cto uncover a lot of self-dealing, a lot of theft and a lot of manipulation by the management company to benefit the developer at the financial expense of the owners and the association,\u201d said Michael Diaz Jr., an attorney and Aston Martin Residences condo owner who was elected the association\u2019s president last year.\nAmong the accusations are allegedly bogus or inflated invoices paid for cleaning, security and water-damage repairs, as well as payments for concierge services that allegedly weren\u2019t provided and $70,000 in rent for an alleged sales office that Coto is accused of signing off on unilaterally.\nThe 66-story ultra-luxury tower was completed in April 2024 by an affiliate of Coto\u2019s Miami-based G&amp;G Business Developments, in a joint venture with the British automaker.\nIt was built with a\n$200 million\nconstruction loan, and the sellout for its 391 units reportedly topped $1 billion. Buyers included the scion of a medical device maker, who paid\n$23 million\nfor a condo on the 60th floor, and a Mexican industrial magnate, who paid\n$18 million\nfor a 62nd floor unit.\nCoto and Lewis Conwell, the attorney representing Coto\u2019s development entity, declined comment. Conwell said he has not seen the complaint and that his client has not been served with the lawsuit.\nNetwork rife with conflicts\nAston Martin condo buyers were lured with promises of a marina, helipad and exclusive beach club access, along with assurances of ethical governance and legal compliance, only to discover missing amenities and a developer-run board that allegedly raided association coffers, the lawsuit alleges.\nCoto and his allies used \u201ca network of interconnected companies\u201d to enrich themselves at the expense of the association and owners, the lawsuit alleges. Coto served as the association\u2019s original president and director, from November 30, 2023 through the turnover, while controlling multiple developer-related entities.\nOther defendants are Gloria Garcia, Coto\u2019s mother and a G&amp;G principal; former condo association secretary and treasurer Marcelo Scarinci and former vice president Guillermo Cacagno, both employees of the developer entities who were appointed by Coto; and Leonardo Polo and his wife Maria Eliana Polo, who are managers of the security firm and cleaning services company hired by the Coto-led condo association. Maria Eliana Polo allegedly was another G&amp;G employee.\nScarinci, Cacagno and the Polos did not respond to requests for comment.\nScarinci and Cacagno allegedly pushed through and signed key contracts with the Polo\u2019s companies, as well as with other entities controlled by Coto.\nFor instance, Scarinci allegedly authorized a lease agreement in October 2024 between the association and an entity managed by Coto that owns a unit on the third floor of\nAston Martin Residences\n.\nThe Coto-led board leased the condo for $8,500 a month to use as its management office even though the association already has a designated office space in the building that is free of charge, the complaint states. Coto was serving as the condo board president while designated as the landlord in the lease agreement. Yet, there are no meeting minutes reflecting a vote approving the lease and no disclosure of Coto\u2019s conflict of interest, the lawsuit alleges.\nCoto is accused in the lawsuit of using the unit as a sales office to market remaining units. He allegedly charged the condo association rent that far exceeded market rates, charged for furnishings that were not provided, and overstated the condo\u2019s leasable square footage, the complaint states.\nThe association paid roughly $70,000 in rent until the new board terminated the lease last year.\nCoto\u2019s entity that owns the unit responded by filing a lawsuit, which is still pending, against the condo association for $100,000 in damages.\nWhen it rains, it pours\nThe lawsuit accuses Coto of an alleged repair scheme tied to water damage in the building in May 2024.\nCoto allegedly arranged for his general contracting firm GC Builders to perform repair work without competitive bids, a board vote or disclosure of Coto\u2019s dual role, and without any written contract between the association and GC Builders.\nDespite scant documentation of what work, if any, was actually done, the Coto-controlled board and GC Builders profited from two insurance claims, the lawsuit alleges.\nCoto is also accused in the lawsuit of paying his own company for concierge services that weren\u2019t delivered.\nG&amp;G employee and then-board member Scarinci allegedly signed an agreement to pay $34,334 a month to International Booking, an entity tied to G&amp;G, but there are no board meeting minutes approving it, and that the conflict of interest allegedly was not disclosed.\nInternational Booking allegedly submitted boiler plate invoices for concierge services that lacked detail for exorbitant charges. When the owner-run board terminated the contract in April of last year, International Booking sued the condo association seeking payment for three months after the agreement was canceled.\nThe Coto-controlled board allegedly entered into agreements with the security firm and cleaning services owned by the Polos, the lawsuit states.\nThe security company was paid close to $800,000 despite having no prior experience, no web site and no track record, the lawsuit alleges. The cleaning services firm allegedly won its contract in April 2024 without competitive bidding and without a board vote, and improperly billed for items not in the contract, as well as excess hours unsupported by records.\nAriella Gutman, the attorney for the Aston Martin Residences condo association, said the developer and his associates grabbed as much money as they could from the association.\n\u201cThey took every financial advantage they could\u00a0 \u2026 there was nobody who was independent and that was not related to the main entities that developed this building,\u201d she said.",

        "content": "Large apartments are overtaking detached homes in the nation\u2019s rental supply, and Dallas is leading the race, according to a decade-long study.\nThe share of single-family homes in the country\u2019s rental stock is shrinking, and Dallas has shifted faster than any other major city. From 2014 to 2024, units at large multifamily buildings in Dallas rose from 29.2 percent to 46.3 percent of the rental inventory, the largest increase among the top 50 metropolitan areas in the country,\nRedfin\nreports.\nMultifamily growth has acquainted Dallas with some strange bedfellows. The sprawling metro ranks eighth in America for multifamily units as a share of total rental inventory, right alongside some of the densest cities in the country. New York is first, with multifamily units taking up 69 percent of the rental inventory. Dallas lands between Chicago, where large apartments make up 45 percent of the rental inventory, and Washington, D.C., where multifamily units\u2019 share is 47.3 percent.\n\u201cWe have a little bit of a multifamily glut,\u201d said Steve Triolet, senior vice president of research and market forecasting at Partners Real Estate.\nVacancy rates in apartments with at least five units exceeded 11 percent across the Dallas/Fort Worth area last year. That pushed the 8 percent to 10 percent bound conventionally considered to show a neutral landlord-tenant relationship, according to Partners.\n\u201cSome of the submarkets I would consider tenant-favorable. You can get a lot of\nconcessions\n, free rent, stuff like that,\u201d Triolet said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the urban core \u2014 if you\u2019re in downtown, specifically \u2014 it\u2019s not uncommon to get six to eight weeks of free rent for signing a lease of a year or more. When you do the math on that, that shows a little bit of\ndistress\n.\u201d\nMultifamily builders in Dallas only recently\nput the brakes on a swift construction run\nthat led to some oversupply. At 92.6 percent, the Metroplex registered one of the lowest multifamily occupancy rates of the largest cities in the country last year, according to\nYardi Matrix\n.\nSingle-family builders have kept busy in North Texas as well, but they\u2019re also slowing. Construction began on about 8,300 homes in the fourth quarter of 2025, a\n17.7 percent year-over-year decrease\nfrom 10,190 starts in the same period of 2024.\nWhile multifamily and residential builders slowed last year,\nbuilt-to-rent developers\naccelerated. Over 5,800 units of built-to-rent homes were underway in Dallas in September, up 6.7 percent from June, according to\nRealPage\n. Dallas remains one of the nation\u2019s leading markets for built-to-rent development, which could suffer from a glut in the overall rental supply.\n\u201cThat\u2019s really new, and there\u2019s not really a proven exit strategy,\u201d Triolet said.\n",

        "content": "AT&amp;T is so far being welcomed with open arms by\nPlano officials\n, notching off one regulatory hurdle to move out of Downtown Dallas.\nThe Plano Planning and Zoning Commission on Monday unanimously approved a rezoning request from the telecom giant at the former Electronic Data Systems headquarters, where the company wants to relocate its global headquarters, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe planned redevelopment needs commercial employment zoning, which would provide the property owner greater leeway in redevelopment plans for different portions of the site. Dallas-based NexPoint controls 215 acres that include the former headquarters of Electronic Data Systems, including the nearly 100 acres at the southeast corner of Legacy Drive and Parkwood Boulevard identified for the zoning.\nThe commission also passed a waiver for the new zoning application to go through, as the suburb north of Dallas currently has a two\u2013year waiting period on the books until February of next year, according to the outlet. The full Plano City Council still needs to vote on the changes.\nRestoring the zoning would allow the site at 5400 Legacy Drive in\nPlano\u2019s Legacy development\nto be used for the\ncorporate headquarters\nalong with offices, retail, research facilities and light industrial uses. In January, AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey said the move was for office consolidation, saying the Plano site will allow AT&amp;T to \u201ccost effectively consolidate all Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex administrative space,\u201d including major offices in Dallas, Plano and Irving, while creating a purpose-built corporate campus,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported.\nStankey targeted the second half of 2028 for workers to begin decamping from the 37-story Whitacre Tower at 208 South Akard Street in Dallas, where its lease runs through 2030. The company relocated its headquarters to Dallas in 2008 after\nleaving San Antonio\n.\nNexPoint had previously sought another use for the Plano site before AT&amp;T\u2019s interest, as the firm secured zoning for a life sciences and research campus in 2023, according to the publication. That site plan included a utility plant, infrastructure and parking upgrades as well as a 200,000-square-foot manufacturing facility.\nNexPoint might be looking for a way to retain some of the life sciences on the rest of the site not contained in this round of zoning. Along with the old EDS headquarters, which was the information technology company founded by Ross Perot, a source told the outlet that the firm might try to attract life sciences firms to future satellite buildings within the area.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Last year, Santa Monica officials\nbegan searching for developers\nto build affordable housing on city land.\nThe 26th Street proposal is one of several in Santa Monica consisting of residences, including some affordable, above retail.\nLast month,\nTrammell Crow Company proposed\nreplacing an existing office complex at 2716 Ocean Park Boulevard with 456 residential units, including 46 affordable apartments, above 6,200 square feet of ground-floor retail.

        "content": "Shaya Prager has been officially kicked out of one of his suburban Chicago office properties \u2014 at least from the buildings.\nA\nforeclosure saga at the Corporate 500 office complex in Deerfield\nthat Prager\u2019s firm Opal Holdings spent $178 million to buy in 2022 reached a conclusion last month, when a Lake County judge approved Iowa-based lender GreenState Credit Union\u2019s seizure of the property through a court-ordered sheriff\u2019s sale, public records show.\nGreenState took over the four-building, 697,000-square-foot campus in a deal finalized late last month, with the discharge of a court-appointed receiver who managed the property during the foreclosure litigation. (I would note here if the deal has been finalized). The lender bought the $104 million loan note from previous lender Unify Financial Credit Union, which originated the loan to\nPrager\u2019s company\nfor the property\u2019s acquisition before it fell into default in late 2023.\nIt\u2019s unclear how much GreenState paid Unify to obtain the loan, but it traded while already facing foreclosure over Prager\u2019s firm missing property tax payments as well as monthly loan payments owed to Unify.\nA judgment amount of more than $130 million was entered in November against Prager\u2019s borrower entities in the foreclosure case. Prager fought GreenState\u2019s move to take over the property through a sheriff sale with some last-ditch legal motions filed late last year, court records show.\nAn Opal affiliate, Liberty Deerfield LLC, argued it should be allowed to file an objection to the approval of the sheriff\u2019s sale later than the deadline the court imposed because an attorney mistakenly believed filings were due a week later than they were. It also claimed the borrowers weren\u2019t given proper notice of the sheriff\u2019s sale before it was held, claiming GreenState only sent a notice of the auction five business days before the sale when it\u2019s required to give 10 such days.\nThe court wasn\u2019t swayed by the Opal affiliates, however, and approved the sale in November to GreenState, which won the sheriff\u2019s auction through a credit bid of $66 million, leaving a $64.9 million deficiency from the judgment against Shulamit Prager, who is Shaya Prager\u2019s wife, and the Opal entities. A spokesperson and an attorney for Opal didn\u2019t return requests for comment, while lawyers for GreenState and Unify also didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\nIn a move to stabilize the asset, the credit union appointed JLL last fall as the exclusive property manager and leasing agent, with about 25 percent of the office space still available to lease after Baxter-backed kidney care spinoff Vantive agreed to rent an entire building on the campus. GreenState has committed to spending additional funds on concessions such as tenant improvement allowances to build out interior office space and leasing commissions to attract additional occupants.\nWith the Opal-affiliated entities officially purged from the property\u2019s leasehold title, another challenge for the new ownership will be navigating a complex ground lease structure that defines the property \u2014 and Opal\u2019s broader controversial strategy.\nWhile GreenState now controls the buildings, it remains unclear if it\u2019s obligated to continue making ground lease payments to an entity led by Katherine Cartagena, who has been a frequent deal partner in Opal\u2019s acquisitions since 2020, often serving as the ground landlord in deals that allowed Opal to bifurcate land and building ownership to maximize leverage. The building ownership was required to make regular lease payments to the ground ownership, often on deals that span decades, as part of the transactions. The Deerfield ground rent was about $5 million annually, records show.\nThis foreclosure is merely one piece of a disintegrating portfolio.\nPrager spent billions on suburban office parks\nacross the U.S. as well as a Wacker Drive skyscraper in downtown Chicago during an aggressive mid-pandemic shopping spree, but is now mired in litigation across the Midwest.\nWhile the Deerfield foreclosure concludes, Prager\u2019s broader portfolio remains in turmoil as he faces ongoing litigation from Wisconsin nursing home investors alongside a trail of foreclosures spanning the\nTwin Cities\nand Fort Worth\u2019s\nBurnett Plaza\n.\n",

In addition to that being the number of units in the building, the developers also benefited from a tax abatement secured under the city\u2019s former 421a program (which has since been replaced by 485x).\nElsewhere in Long Island City, M &amp; T Realty Capital Corporation recently provided a\n$347 million loan\nto refinance TF Cornerstone\u2019s luxury waterfront tower. The loan for the 575-unit building at 2-20 Malt Drive is backed by Fannie Mae\u2019s Near Stabilization program.\nLate last year, Rabina locked down a refinancing package for its Fifth Avenue supertall. Carlyle Group provided a\n$640 million condo inventory loan\nfor 520 Fifth Avenue, replacing a $540 million construction loan from Bank OZK and Carlyle\u2019s Global Credit business as the mixed-use tower moves towards leasing and sales.\nIn June, KKR\u2019s private commercial real estate financing pipeline reached a\nrecord $42 billion\n, driven by dislocations in the traditional lending market.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A pair of South Florida apartment complexes will be going for sale,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned, amid a slowdown of the multifamily market compared with recent years\u2019 boom.\nBoston-based Stratford Management is looking to offload the 276-unit Riverland Apartments at 420-432 Southwest 27th Avenue in Fort Lauderdale for about $90 million, and CIX Capital wants to sell the 240-unit Village at Mangonia Lake at 2201 North Australian Avenue for about $70 million, according to Jaret Turkell, the broker marketing the properties on behalf of the sellers.\nThe complexes, both of which consist of market-rate rentals, are expected to hit the market this week.\nTurkell and Omar Morales are part of the Berkadia team marketing the properties.\nCompleted in 2021 on an 11.1-acre site, Riverland consists of seven buildings with studios and one- to three-bedroom apartments, records show. Monthly rents range from $1,920 to $3,759, according to the property\u2019s website. The asking price amounts to $326,100 per unit.\nStratford and Boca Raton-based Eastham Capital paid\n$84 million\nfor Riverland in 2023, assuming the seller\u2019s $55.9 million loan from First Republic Bank.\nVillage at Mangonia Lake, completed in 2019 on a 7.6-acre site, consists of three six-story buildings, property records show. It has one- and two-bedroom apartments, with monthly rents from $1,850 to $2,160, according to\nApartments.com\n. The asking price amounts to $291,700 per unit.\nMiami-based Resia developed Village at Mangonia Lake, and the property\u2019s ownership entity ties to Resia. But Turkell said CIX Capital, a S\u00e3o Paulo-based investment firm that\u2019s part of Brazil\u2019s investment and development firm Maiz, is listing the site.\nCIX Capital launched CIX AHS Multifamily Income Bond in 2021 to co-invest with Resia in multifamily. It announced plans in 2024 to direct its investments to South Florida multifamily, according to its website and Brazilian news reports.\nSouth Florida\u2019s multifamily market has been recalibrating.\nAfter a pandemic-induced influx of out-of-staters, unprecedented demand prompted record rents, and developers seized on the\nboom\nwith hefty apartment completions. As a result, the market has felt the sting from a\nsupply overhand\namid slower in-migration, leading to a drop in rents and increased concessions.\nIn December, the median asking rent in South Florida hit $2,262, a 3.4 percent decline year-over-year, according to\nRealtor.com\n.\nStill, the decision to sell a complex also is tied to when the landlord bought the properties and their investment strategy, Turkell said.\nThe apartment properties\u2019 listing comes as RFR Realty put on the for-sale market this month the 30-story 100 Biscayne office tower, at 100 Biscayne Boulevard, in downtown Miami for about\n$130 million\n.\n",

The homes that went pending last week total $273.5 million in asking dollar volume and averaged 84 days on the market. The previous week, buyers signed 21 contracts totaling\n$132.5 million\n.\nThe report tracks signed contracts for single-family homes and condos asking $3 million or more in the Beaches MLS. It identified 61 new listings, and 1,268 active listings on the market.\nOf the properties that went pending last week, 26 were single-family homes, and 11 were condos. The average asking price for the condos was $4.9 million, or $1,839 per square foot. They spent an average of 81 days on the market.\nThe average asking price for the single-family homes was $8.4 million, or $1,687 per square foot, and they spent an average of 88 days on the market.\nThe most expensive listing to find a buyer last week was the 4,700-square-foot waterfront home at 751 Island Drive in\nPalm Beach\nasking $35 million.\nRecords show the seller is the estate of the late Patsy Johnson, who was the widow of financier and Flagler National Bank founder Dick Johnson. She died in July. The couple bought the home for $2.4 million in 1994. It was built on 0.4 acres in 1988 and had five bedrooms, four bathrooms, one half-bathroom, a pool and a dock, records show.\nThe home listed for $35 million in November with Jim McCann of Premier Estate Properties.\nThe next most expensive home to go pending last week was the 5,600-square-foot house at 242 Tangier Avenue asking $17.8 million.\nRecords show the sellers are Julie and Thomas Frist III, who bought it for $7.9 million in 2016. Thomas Frist III\u2019s grandfather and namesake founded HCA Healthcare, a multi-billion dollar operator of health care facilities. The Tangier Avenue home was built on 0.3 acres in 2008 and includes five bedrooms, six bathrooms, two half-bathrooms, a pool and a guest house.\nIt hit the market for $17.8 million in December with Crista Fanjul Ryan of Tina Fanjul Associates.",

The penthouse went into contract with a last asking price of $17.5 million, according to StreetEasy.\nThe deal comes three years after the building\u2019s other penthouse on the 33rd floor appeared to go into contract with an asking price $17.5 million. That unit then appeared back on StreetEasy asking $15 million last summer without having closed, before being taken off the market at the end of the year. (The New York Post\nreported\nthe wishy-washy buyer was actor Michael B. Jordan).\nIf Penthouse B closes at that price, it would be the second most-expensive condo sold in the borough and the most expensive on a price per square foot basis, at over $3,550 per square foot, according to a spokesperson for the building. A condo at Quay Tower that\nsold for $20.3 million\nstill holds the record for the borough\u2019s most expensive condo trade.\nSpanning almost 5,000 square feet across the entire 32nd floor of the sail-shaped building on 30 Front Street known as the Olympia Dumbo, the 10-room condo features five bedrooms, four full bathrooms and a home office.\nThe home has 360-degree views and a private terrace that spans over 500 square feet and looks out to Manhattan\u2019s southern skyline.\nAmenities include a 24-hour doorman and concierge, a full-size tennis court, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and a fitness center with a boxing gym and spin studio.\nAfter launching sales in 2021, the project has sold roughly two-third of its units, according to Marketproof, and rotated through a number of sales teams, many of whom claim ownership to this latest contract, along with Douglas Elliman Development Marketing.\nThe group includes Elliman\u2019s Jessica Peters and Carl Ekroth of the Jessica Peters Team, Karen Heyman and Casey Heyman of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, and Elliman\u2019s Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes of the Eklund Gomes Team.\nDespite sponsor sales moving in fits and starts, the building still lays claim to being the\nmost expensive in Brooklyn\n, with units on average selling for $2,436 per foot, roughly $400 more than notoriously pricey developments on the Williamsburg waterfront like Williamsburg Wharf and One Domino Square.\nThe building also scored its first resale last year, when\nunit 27A sold for nearly $10 million\n, or roughly $3,300 per foot, less than two years after the seller had purchased the condo for $8 million. Former Brooklyn Net Ben Simmons listed his duplex apartment in the building last year for\nnearly $17 million\n, after purchasing the condo in 2023 for $14 million.\n",

        "content": "A Dutch trading firm is expanding its presence in Chicago\u2019s most iconic skyscraper, adding space for the second time while most office tenants in the Loop are doing the opposite.\nIMC struck a deal to add about 100,000 square feet of office space at Willis Tower, boosting its space in the 110-story, 4.5-million-square-foot skyscraper at 233 South Wacker Drive to more than 250,000 square feet, according to people familiar with the situation and first\nreported\nby CoStar. The expansion marks IMC\u2019s\nsecond significant growth spurt\nin the building in less than four years.\nThe deal builds on a 2022 lease extension in which IMC added roughly 50,000 square feet at the former Sears Tower as part of a 10-year commitment. JLL broker Matt Carolan represented the tenant in the latest transaction. Blackstone, the owner of Willis Tower, was represented by Telos Group brokers\nNikki Kearn\n, Jamey Dix, JD Parcheta and Jamai Brown.\nLarge tenant expansions have been scarce across major U.S. cities as companies reassess space needs in a hybrid work era, the outlet reported. Scoring a six-figure expansion in the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere is no small feat.\nThe deal follows Blackstone\u2019s recent agreement with lenders to extend the maturity on more than $1.3 billion in debt tied to Willis Tower as far as 2030, with extension options. The refinancing bought time for the private equity giant, which has poured hundreds of millions into upgrading the 1,451-foot-tall property since buying it in 2015.\nIn recent months, Blackstone has also\nquietly approached\na small group of investors willing to assume the building\u2019s $1.3 billion securitized mortgage, according to a Green Street\u2019s Real Estate Alert published in January. Eastdil Secured is running those conversations, sources told the outlet.\nIMC declined to comment to CoStar on why it needs more space. The Amsterdam-based market maker has steadily expanded its Chicago presence since opening a local office in 2000. The Chicago operation is now the firm\u2019s largest globally, employing more than 650 people, according to IMC\u2019s website. The company also maintains offices in London; Hong Kong; Sydney;\u00a0 Mumbai; Zug, Switzerland; and Aarhus, Denmark.\nIMC\u2019s expansion isn\u2019t the only sign of life in the Loop. Engineering firm Sargent &amp; Lundy recently added three more floors at the building at\n77 West Wacker Drive\n, pushing its total stake there past 447,000 square feet ahead of an August move from 55 East Monroe Street. Smaller expansions have also cropped up in the Loop and River North in recent months.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Recology shut down that location the following year. Amazon filed formal plans with the city to construct an industrial building in 2021.\nThe project has faced regulatory hurdles along the way that have kept shovels from hitting dirt. In 2022, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors approved what was essentially a moratorium on new parcel delivery facilities, requiring developments like Amazon\u2019s to get conditional-use authorization, or approval after additional city review, even if the site was already zoned for the proposed project. The city made the changes permanent in 2024.\nSet to rise three stories, the industrial building will include 17,700 square feet of offices, approximately 3,600 square feet of ground-floor retail and 510 parking spaces for employees as well as 13,700 square feet of public open space. The site is around the corner from the California College of the Arts campus, which Vanderbilt University\nacquired earlier this month\nas part of its San Francisco satellite plans, and is a few blocks west of the growing Mission Bay neighborhood, home to large companies like\nOpenAI\n,\nNvidia\n, Visa and Coinbase.\nWhen complete, the delivery station is expected to \u201cprovide better service and faster delivery to customers in San Francisco while reducing delivery mileage, since many packages are currently dispatched from outside the city,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson told the Business Times. The environmental review stage is a preliminary step in the project moving forward, and the company is planning to work in tandem with the city and community members to get it across the finish line.\nThe San Francisco Planning Department will convene a meeting to hear community feedback on the project on Feb. 12.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The\nLos Angeles City Council\nsigned off on a $90 million subsidy program for Palisades fire victims.\nOn Tuesday, the city council unanimously\napproved\nthe funding for costs associated with\nrebuilding properties\nin\nPacific Palisades\nthat were damaged or destroyed in the deadly January 2025 blazes, My News L.A. reported. More than 20 Palisades residents and fire survivors urged the city council to approve the aid before leaders ultimately gave it a thumbs-up.\nIn greenlighting the subsidies, the city council asked the city attorney\u2019s office to prepare an ordinance to officially establish the program and a framework to execute it. Under the subsidy program, all structures, including single-family homes, duplexes, accessory dwelling units, multifamily housing, townhomes, condos and commercial buildings, would be covered if homeowners rebuild within 110 percent size of the original property footprint and use the structures for the same purposes. Property owners would be responsible for fees in excess of the 110 percent rebuild and repair limit.\nThe city administrative officer, Matt Szabo, and his office have been instructed by the council to recommend a funding strategy to the city council and\nMayor Karen Bass\n, which would be incorporated into the budget for fiscal year 2026 and 2027.\nThe council also approved a measure introduced by Council member Monica Rodriguez that implements protections to confirm that taxpayer funds are used for rebuilding and recovery and that property owners can\u2019t take the money and run. \u201cMy amendment is simply to ensure that we\u2019re trying to ensure the people would be required to reimburse the city and taxpayers for the subsidy should the owner sell the property before the certificate of occupancy is issued,\u201d Rodriguez said, per My News L.A.\nThe City of Los Angeles, which includes Pacific Palisades, has issued nearly 1,700 rebuild permits in the more than one year since the fires ripped through the seaside neighborhood, according to the state\u2019s permitting\ntracker\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "What appear to be strangely-proportioned townhomes popping up in Houston\u2019s Third Ward, University of Houston area, East End and other neighborhoods are turning out to be small dorm-like structures for single adults chasing affordability.\nThe reason is co-living, a\nniche housing model\nthat\u2019s starting to take on a more institutional feel in Houston. A new 10-bedroom, 10-bathroom building in the Third Ward for instance is one of roughly 33 newly built or in-progress co-living properties backed by investors working with the Passive Investor Network, a Houston-based real estate investor network,\naccording\nto the Houston Chronicle.\nRather than carving up older houses, PIN projects are purposely built for PadSplit, an Atlanta-based firm that rents out private bedrooms in shared homes. Often described as a grown-up version of a dorm, PadSplit pitches itself as an\naffordable alternative\nfor renters priced out of traditional apartments by deposits, income requirements and bundled fees.\nThe new homes are scattered across the Third Ward and University of Houston area, Near Northside, Independence Heights and the East End. Most PadSplit listings in Houston \u2014 nearly 2,000 rooms metro-wide \u2014 are still in\nolder properties\n, the outlet reported. But build-to-rent investors are increasingly testing newly constructed co-living units across the Sun Belt, including in Houston, New Orleans, San Antonio and Jacksonville.\nAt PIN\u2019s Third Ward property, dubbed the \u201cJuice Joint,\u201d bedrooms are spread across three floors, with multiple kitchenettes, shared laundry and communal refrigerators. Each room has its own bathroom, the outlet reported. An Art Deco speakeasy theme runs throughout, with private rooms named after cocktails and finished with brass fixtures and dark tile.\nRents for PIN Group\u2019s new-build co-living rooms run from about $1,000 to $1,200 a month, depending on the site. That\u2019s roughly in line with Houston\u2019s average rent for a Class B one-bedroom apartment and still well below\nnewer Class A units\n, which average about $1,471 per month, according to MRI Software. Newer build-to-rent single-family homes typically lease closer to $2,000, according to John Burns Research and Consulting.\nPadSplit backers argue the savings show up elsewhere. Utilities, internet, furniture and cleaning are usually included, and tenants aren\u2019t locked into yearlong leases. Move-in fees are typically about $100, sometimes waived, compared to $1,600 to $1,800 upfront for many apartments in the Third Ward area, based on the publication\u2019s analysis.\nPadSplit also skips traditional credit checks and steep income thresholds, the outlet reported, lowering barriers for renters who might otherwise be shut out, tying investment opportunity to density rather than rent growth.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Beacon took out a more than $106.4 million floating-rate loan from Morgan Stanley that same year with plans to revamp the facility for life sciences tenants. The loan comes due in March.\nBeacon renamed the property from Hollis Business Center to Ratio Innovation Campus in 2022 as part of that repositioning effort. The Boston-based firm invested more than $39 million for building and mechanical upgrades and improvements to amenities and common areas.\nWhen Beacon purchased the property, funding for the life sciences and biotech sectors was at an all-time high, and confidence in the market\u2019s future was strong. But after President Donald Trump took office last year, federal\nfunding for life sciences\nand related sectors began to disappear, causing demand for life sciences real estate to evaporate. In the fourth quarter, the R&amp;D market in Emeryville saw a 43 percent vacancy rate, per CBRE data cited by the Business Times, higher than the 28.5 percent overall life sciences vacancy rate in the East Bay corridor.\nThe Ratio Innovation Campus is currently 71 percent leased to six tenants, about half of which are life sciences companies including Totus Medicines and Arcadia Science, as well as the Rocky Mountain Cancer Center medical facility. Whole Foods Market has an office there, as does LifeStance Health.\nWhether the Ratio Innovation Campus itself hits the market \u2014 and for what price \u2014 remains to be seen. Last month, Blackstone\nlisted the 234,016-square-foot EmeryTech campus\nat 1400 65th Street in Emeryville. That property is expected to trade hands in a short sale, meaning it would sell for less than the debt tied to the site.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A boutique luxury hotel and condo tower with a nine-figure development cost is angling for zoning approval in one of Dallas\u2019 most tightly contested districts.\nHotel developer and restaurateur Robert Colombo is seeking city approval to build the Montclair Hotel and Residences, a roughly 23-story building planned for 2516 Maple Avenue in Uptown. The project would rise as high as 350 feet, requiring a height variance and other zoning adjustments,\naccording\nto city filings cited by The Dallas Morning News.\nThe proposal is scheduled to go before the City Planning &amp; Zoning Commission on Thursday, with Colombo targeting a Dallas City Council vote by the end of the month. If approved, the project would add a rare mix of\nhigh-end hospitality\nand for-sale residential units to a corridor heavy with apartments and medical offices.\nColombo told the outlet that the Montclair would include 65 hotel rooms and suites, 12 to 15 luxury condos, a spa, multiple restaurants and a small banquet facility. The development aims to compete on finishes and exclusivity rather than scale.\nThe condos would sit atop the building\u2019s upper 10 floors, with units averaging about 3,000 square feet. Buyers could also purchase full-floor units of roughly 6,000 square feet, Colombo said. Retail and restaurant space would anchor the ground floor, with the hotel stacked above.\nBranding for both the\nhotel and condos\nis still being negotiated. Colombo pegged total development costs between $200 million and $250 million.\nIf approvals fall into place, Colombo expects design work to wrap this spring. Construction could begin as early as May 2027, with a projected opening in spring 2030.\nThe project would replace the former Hotel St. Germain, a Victorian mansion built in 1897 that has been renovated multiple times over the past century. Colombo said he\u2019s working with city planners and preservation-minded groups to relocate the historic structure rather than demolish it. Estimates to move the building range from $300,000 to $500,000, he said.\nThe development is being led by Colombo\u2019s Ivy P3 Group alongside McKinney-based\nHorizon Capital Partners\n, with Dallas-based Nunzio Marc Desantis Architects serving as lead designer. The Oak Lawn Committee, an influential neighborhood group, signed off on the proposal last summer, a nonbinding but politically helpful endorsement.\nColombo, a New York native and hospitality veteran, has helped shape Dallas\u2019 dining and hotel scene since the 1980s. He previously worked on projects like\nThe Joule\nhotel downtown.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The billionaire couple, whose wealth Forbes estimates to be $10.8 billion, own privately held The Wonderful Company \u2014 which includes consumer brands such as POM Wonderful, Fiji Water and Wonderful Pistachios \u2014 and are some of the state\u2019s largest owners of land and water rights. The Resnicks, through a spokesperson for The Wonderful Company, declined to comment on Bass or their contributions.\nThe Resnicks weren\u2019t the only ones to open their pocketbooks to Bass.\nRichard Ziman, co-founder of\nRexford Industrial\n, was one of the first to respond to Bass\u2019 initial 2024 fundraiser by contributing $1,800 in July 2024. Developer Steve Soboroff was another early contributor back in July 2024, with $500. Soboroff\nsupported Bass in 2022\n, saying she \u201cis exactly who Los Angeles needs right now.\u201d That was before his relationship with city hall soured once he was tapped by Bass to be\nchief recovery officer\npost-Palisades fire in April 2025. That was followed in short order by a very public unraveling mired in accusations by Soboroff that he was sidelined from key decisions.\nFrom homebuilders, there was a $1,500 contribution in November from luxury developer\nArdie Tavangarian\n, who sold the mansion at\n1601 San Onofre Drive\nin the Pacific Palisades for $83 million in 2021 to tech billionaire Austin Russell. The Arya Group CEO declined to comment on Bass or specific policies of the mayor that he supports.\nElsewhere on the residential real estate side, six individuals from Compass donated a combined $3,550 to Bass\u2019 campaign. There were also agents from Coldwell Banker Realty, Oppenheim Group, Nourmand &amp; Associates and Keller Williams pitching in for the current mayor.\nLooking to unseat\nWhile the challengers to Bass may be many, only a handful have turned the heads of donors.\nFormer L.A. deputy mayor and Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Austin Beutner is leading that pack with $314,601 raised and 4.4 percent, or over $13,750, of it from the real estate industry, according to Ethics Commission records.\nAmong the biggest donors so far were Cushman &amp; Wakefield broker Eric Olofson ($1,800), El Segundo real estate investor Charles Lyons ($1,800), and Stevenson Ranch broker Amber Dolle-Field ($1,800).\nCivil engineer Asaad Alnajjar, who counts over 35 years working for the city, has raised the next largest pot with $109,368. About $1,900 of that, or nearly 2 percent, was drawn from real estate. The largest of those contributions was $1,800 from Ruben Gamerberg of Los Angeles-based Caltron Construction.\nThere\u2019s also Democratic Socialists of America member and Presbyterian minister\nRae Chen Huang\n, who announced in November her candidacy for mayor. She\u2019s considered a longshot but has also drawn comparisons to New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani and Seattle Mayor Katie Wilson.\nLittle funds are flowing from real estate for Huang\u2019s campaign, although that comes as no surprise. Huang called her campaign \u201cpeople powered\u201d and made clear in a January fundraising email she\u2019s not taking money from \u201ccorporate interests, developers or political insiders.\u201d\nFormer \u201cThe Hills\u201d reality TV star and Palisades resident\nSpencer Pratt\nfiled his intention to run for mayor on Tuesday with the city clerk. He officially kicks off his campaign on Wednesday.\n",

Al Sharpton\u2019s civil rights organization left its office at 106-108 West 145th Street at the end of January. The move makes way for the housing development known as One45 and comes after landlord Bruce Teitelbaum threatened to evict NAN.\nTeitelbaum filed a\npetition\nto evict NAN in\nSeptember\n, claiming that after multiple lease extensions, the most recent of which expired at the end of August, the organization refused to leave 106-108 West 145th Street.\nThe one-story building is part of the site where Teitelbaum plans a 1,000-unit\napartment complex\n. At the time of the eviction filing, an attorney for the developer indicated that NAN was the only tenant holding up the project.\nA judge signed an eviction order in January, which was stayed on the condition that NAN would leave the building by Jan. 31.\nIn a statement Sharpton said NAN will move into its new headquarters in March, though didn\u2019t disclose the location. The organization will operate out of the Harlem Commonwealth Council\u2019s office in the meantime, and will host rallies to celebrate Black History Month at the Mother AME Zion Church.\nThe dispute with NAN was the latest speed bump for a project that has faced years of delays.\nThe City Council\napproved\nOne45 in July, after Teitelbaum abandoned an earlier proposal due to resistance from the local Council member. After years of fits and starts, he rebooted the project in 2024 with an updated unit count. The project is now expected to include 1,000 apartments across three buildings, of which at least 338 will be affordable.\n\u201cNow that NAN finally moved, we can proceed with our plan to build $1,000+ new homes for Harlem, which is just the start, but any more depends on the cooperation of the administration,\u201d Teitelbaum said.\nTeitelbaum has said he\u2019s willing to increase the unit counts and share of affordable apartments, but doing so would require public subsidies. He indicated Wednesday that he hasn\u2019t spoken with anyone in the Mamdani administration but \u201cis hopeful and certainly willing to work with the mayor.\u201d\nThe developer also hopes to qualify for the\nnow-expired property tax break\n421a. To do so, the project must be completed by June 15, 2031.\nPlans for One45 previously included offices for NAN and a civil rights museum founded by\nSharpton and Judge Jonathan Lippman. The museum was later pitched for\nanother project\n, but neither plan moved forward.\nAt the time, Teitelbaum\u2019s project was facing opposition from local Council member Kristin Richardson Jordan, which ultimately led to his\nwithdrawing\nhis project application in May 2022. Once a new Council member was in place and the state extended a key construction deadline for the property tax break 421a, Teitelbaum released new plans for the project and restarted the city\u2019s land use review process.\n",

        "content": "The data is in, and South Florida\u2019s luxury real estate market is still working off its \u201cLiberation Day\u201d hangover.\nLuxury sales stumbled in the face of global economic instability last year, according to a global report by Knight Frank on home sales of $10 million or more.\nPalm Beach closed 127 such sales, totaling $2.4 billion in 2025, down from 159 totaling $2.9 billion the previous year. The Miami luxury market had 145 sales in 2025, a drop from 162 deals the year prior, although the dollar volume in both years reached $3 billion.\nSouth Florida\u2019s luxury real estate agents heralded the start of 2025 as the beginning of another record year of gangbuster deals.\nHype around the newly re-elected President Donald Trump and his economic policies fueled a dramatic\n\u201cTrump bump\u201d\nin the first quarter of the year. Palm Beach\u2019s pending luxury contracts soared 400 percent, year-over-year, in the immediate weeks following the election.\nKnight Frank data shows the island recorded $1.4 billion in sales of $10 million or more in the first quarter of 2025, and Miami was just behind with $1.3 billion.\nThe activity rocketed South Florida\u2019s luxury hubs\nto the top of global market rankings\n. But the burst of activity was short-lived, with second quarter dollar volume dropping to just $594 million and $495 million in Palm Beach and Miami, respectively.\nPresident Trump began announcing tariff policies in March, but it was his April 2 Liberation Day announcement that triggered the most significant market decline since the pandemic in 2020.\nIn the months that followed Liberation Day, stock markets showed an equally historic rebound \u2013\u2013 as of publication the S&amp;P 500 is up 14 percent, year-over-year \u2013\u2013 but market insiders say the shakeup created uncertainty for ultra-luxury buyers.\nWith markets back on more even footing, there are signs the early 2025 \u201cTrump bump\u201d momentum is returning. Palm Beach had $302 million in luxury dollar volume in the fourth quarter, up from $197 million in the third quarter of the year. Miami\u2019s dollar volume reached $769 million, up from $403 million.\nPending luxury contracts are also on the rise in both markets. Palm Beach County luxury buyers signed 37 contracts totaling\n$273.5 million\nin asking dollar volume last week. Miami-Dade\u2019s luxury buyers signed 24 contracts for\n$204.6 million\nin asking dollar volume in the same window.",

The buyer financed the 6,900-square-foot acquisition with an $8.5 million loan from City National Bank of Florida.\nThe sale price amounts to $1,685 per square foot.\nSimkins, who also leads Lion Development Group and is co-developing a pair of downtown Miami condo towers, joins other major commercial real estate investors, like\nMichael Comras\nand\nRobert Rivani\n, who have recently acquired Lincoln Road properties.\nSimkins acquired his building for nearly $23 million below the previous sale price 12 years ago.\nThe seller, an affiliate of New York-based JSRE Acquisitions, paid\n$34.5 million\n\u2014 almost $5,000 per square foot \u2014 in 2014, records show.

Comras plans to transform the properties into a 150,000-square-foot boutique shopping district called NoLi, which is short for North Lincoln Road.\nRivani purchased the historic Lincoln Theatre building on Lincoln Road for\n$37 million\nin August.

The G.H. Palmer Associates founder, known for his Italian-style properties, has\nbeen a big backer\nof President Donald Trump. He donated millions to his campaigns and hosted fundraisers for him in L.A.\nPalmer wasn\u2019t Hilton\u2019s only Southern California real estate donor either last year. Frank Suryan Jr., chairman and chief executive of Lyon Living, donated $39,200 in December and Steven Craig of Craig Realty Group gave the same amount in May. The two commercial real estate companies are Newport Beach-based. Hilton\u2019s old boss, Rupert Murdoch, whose family media empire includes Fox News, gave $39,200.\nRepresentatives for Palmer, Suryan and Craig did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nHilton, a Republican candidate for governor of very-blue California, raked in more campaign cash than almost any other hopeful in the second half of last year, according to a review of documents recently filed with the secretary of state\u2019s office. Hilton raised $4.2 million between July and December last year \u2014 and a total of $5.7 million the entire year.\nLiberal billionaire Tom Steyer outpaced Hilton, but the bulk of his $28.9 million haul was self-funded \u2014 and though Hilton raised more than her in the latter half of the year, for all of 2025, he raised slightly less than Katie Porter, who served as a U.S. representative from California from 2019 to 2025. She pulled in $6.1 million. After Porter, Hilton still collected more than any other hopeful all year besides Steyer.\nFormer Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa received donations from Newmark broker Jay Luchs, and Related California\u2019s Bill Witte,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously\nreported\n. Villaraigosa\u2019s total contributions amounted to $3.2 million last year.\nAnother Republican candidate, Riverside County sheriff Chad Bianco received $3.7 million in total contributions. Alexander Haagen III, chairman and chief executive of Haagen Company, is one of his supporters, donating $39,200.\nDemocratic candidate and former secretary of health and human services Xavier Becerra pulled in $5.2 million. Another Democratic candidate, Rep. Eric Swalwell, received $3.1 million in contributions.\nThe other four candidates, Democratic and Republican, didn\u2019t reach the million-dollar mark.\nNewly announced candidate San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan did not have to disclose campaign funds, but he earned an\nendorsement\nfrom billionaire developer Rick Caruso, who said he\nwouldn\u2019t run\nfor either Los Angeles mayor or California governor after months of chatter.\n",

Work is slated to begin this month, roughly a year after the partners bought the building for about\n$68 million\nin an all-cash deal.\nThe project comes as downtown office vacancy hovers near record highs and a wave of troubled buildings trade at steep discounts, the outlet reported. Many new owners have stayed on the sidelines, wary of pouring capital into older towers amid uncertain demand, high construction costs and lingering questions about whether tenants will pay up.\nAt the tower at 200 South Wacker Drive,\nGlenstar\nand Halloran are betting they will. The building is currently 57 percent leased, a figure that includes a pending departure by law firm Goldman Ismail Tomaselli Brennan &amp; Baum, and trails the downtown average of roughly 72 percent. Glenstar managing principal Michael Klein told the outlet that the goal is not just to\nout-lease competitors\n, but to do so at higher rents.\nRenderings reveal an amenity blitz, with the owners planning to gut and remake the lobby, two mezzanine levels and the lower floors with luxury finishes, a river-facing health club, golf simulators, a parlor gaming area and an outdoor lounge with fire pits that will cantilever over the riverwalk. New pavers aim to enhance the Adams Street entrance, and a 180-seat conference center on the 34th floor will be fully reworked.\nGlenstar pegs the core amenity package at about $25 million, with several million more earmarked for restroom and corridor upgrades, back-of-house improvements and roughly 52,000 square feet of spec suites designed for tenants seeking\nmove-in-ready space\n. Construction is expected to wrap by the end of the year.\nThe math works in Glenstar and Halloran\u2019s favor, according to the publication, as they paid about $89 per square foot for the building, a fraction of the $282 per square foot the building fetched in 2013.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The 83,000 square feet of unleashed space includes floor plates ranging from about 9,200 to 27,000 square feet.\nThe building has seven years of average lease term and assumable fixed-rate debt at 2.83 percent through December 2030.\nA Newmark team led by Adam Spies, Joshua King and Marcella Fasulo is overseeing the sales process.\nESRT has been moving to rebalance its portfolio away from office buildings into areas like multifamily and retail.

Last year, it bought two retail properties in Williamsburg for $195 million.\nMalkin overhauled the REIT in 2020, when he stepped in as president.

Brian Kavanagh will not seek reelection, leaving his seat and his role as housing chair up for grabs.\nKavanagh, who announced this week that he will leave office after his term ends this year, has been chair of the Senate Committee on Housing, Construction and Community Development since January 2019, which proved to be a pivotal year for the real estate industry. Buoyed by the Senate\u2019s newly-gained majority that year, the legislature approved the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019. The legislature also passed good cause eviction, created a state-based housing voucher program and approved a replacement to 421a during his tenure.\nIn a statement, he pointed to his pitch to voters in his first-ever campaign, during which he said it was time to elect \u201ca new generation of leadership.\u201d He said now it\u2019s his turn to make room.\n\u201cI believe that all of us in elected office owe it to our constituents to recognize when we have reached a point when we have given it our all and they would be well served by electing someone new,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, that point is now.\u201d\nThe industry will be watching for who takes over the committee chair role and whether that person is further to the left than Kavanagh. Personally, and speaking solely from the perspective of an anxious reporter, I will be watching to see if his successor can also get really into the weeds on housing policy and field questions about specific bill language as Kavanagh has done.\nPossible replacements are already lining up for his Manhattan seat. Assembly member Grace Lee posted on social media that she is considering a run, and former Assembly member Yuh-Line Niou announced she plans to run, citing the need for \u201cbold, aggressive, truly progressive leadership.\u201d Lee waged an unsuccessful campaign to unseat Niou in 2020, but won the seat two years later when Niou left the Assembly. In these previous races, the real estate industry preferred Lee. But we\u2019ll see who else throws their hat in the ring.\nIn other legislative news: Diana Moreno on Tuesday night won a special election to fill Mayor Zohran Mamdani\u2019s seat in the Assembly. Moreno had the backing of the mayor and the Democratic Socialists of America. The win brings the number of state\n\u201cSocialists in Office\u201d\n(a term used by the DSA to describe electeds who were endorsed by the organization) back up to nine.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Who do you think will take over as the housing chair in the state Senate? Who would you like to see in that role? What are your thoughts on Kavanagh\u2019s tenure? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nDina Levy, commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, says she is open to talking about adjustments to 485x. \u201cI want to have some real conversations to find out [if] we need to make some accommodations in light of the prevailing wage and the deeper affordability restrictions,\u201d she\ntold me\nlast week.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nGov. Kathy Hochul on Wednesday\nannounced\nthat former City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams will be her running mate as she runs for reelection. Adams would serve as her lieutenant governor, replacing Antonio Delgado, who is challenging Hochul in the primary.\n\u2014\nMayor Zohran Mamdani plans to endorse Hochul\u2019s reelection bid this week\n,\nPolitico New York reports\n. That\u2019s a major blow to Delgado as he tries to shore up support from the far left.\n\u2014\nDuring a breakfast held by the Association for a Better New York, Council Speaker Julie Menin said the Council is studying city-owned sites, community rezonings and public libraries for potential housing opportunities. \u201cInstead of responding to private land use applications, or ULURPs, instead of hoping that they net us an amount of housing that addresses the current shortage, we are going to survey neighborhoods ourselves across the five boroughs,\u201d she told the crowd.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$10.8 million\nfor a 4,357-square-foot co-op unit at 995 Fifth Avenue on the Upper East Side. Leslie R. Coleman and Christina Lee with Brown Harris Stevens\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$13 million\nfor a 30,200-square-foot industrial building at 54-60 48th Street in Flushing.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$15 million\nfor a 6,338-square-foot condominium at 455 Central Park West on the Upper West Side.

        "content": "A property manager for condo associations was hit with criminal charges, accused of misappropriating about $600,000 from a Pembroke Pines complex.\nIt was the third arrest on a theft charge against Michael Curtis, who also faces allegations in two cases filed last year of allegedly siphoning funds from two other Broward County condo associations.\nCurtis, 38, has pleaded not guilty on the charges in all three cases, and his attorney denied any wrongdoing.\nCurtis\u2019 case comes as many South Florida residential communities governed by condo and homeowner associations for decades have struggled with their leadership. Residents have claimed wrongdoing, from fund misappropriation and lack of maintenance and transparency to high assessments,\nelection fraud\nand bullying of those who speak out, against\nboard members\n.\nBut some associations also have raised issues with their\nproperty managers\n, which are hired by boards and paid by the association.\nThe latest allegations accuse Curtis of forging the signatures of two former board members at the Windmill Lakes condo complex in Pembroke Pines to sign checks from the association accounts to his own companies BDM Property Management, Private Parking Managers and All Florida Rental Management, according to a probable cause affidavit.\nCurtis, hired to manage Windmill Lakes, at 350 Southwest 88th Street, in 2017, allegedly signed over 350 checks to his companies, totaling about $1 million. Investigators determined his financial gain at about $600,000, the affidavit says.\nThe two former board members told investigators they neither knew nor consented to the use of their signatures on the checks, as well as on insurance settlement documents. The settlements from the insurer also yielded checks to BDM Property Management, even though the firm separately billed the association, according to the affidavit.\nThe affidavit consists of a 2023 Pembroke Pines police report. The Broward County State Attorney charged Curtis last month with grand theft and use of another person\u2019s ID without their consent.\nCurtis self-surrendered on Jan. 17, and posted a $22,500 bond, court records show.\nCurtis previously was charged with grand theft in two separate state cases.\nThe Broward State Attorney\u2019s office charged Curtis last year with theft in connection to his tenure as property manager at the Fairways of Sunrise homeowners association, at Northwest 80th Avenue and Northwest 28th Street in Sunrise, and at Colonies II condo association, between Middle River and Northwest 26th Street in Lauderdale Lakes.\nIn the Fairways case, prosecutors said Curtis in 2020 signed off on an $885,000 insurance settlement for the association for damage from Hurricane Irma in 2017, which would give the association $444,750 after payments to attorneys in the insurance claim and other fees.\nBut as $551,620, which included insurance settlement funds, was deposited to the association account, $439,000 was transferred from the association to BDM, according to the affidavit. Yet, in the years after the insurance settlement, Curtis told homeowners that the insurance litigation was \u201cthrown out,\u201d according to the affidavit.\nFairways sued its former board members and BDM in 2022, accusing BDM of failing to account for a substantial amount of Hurricane Irma insurance disbursements.\nBDM won that case. A jury in October found the property management firm didn\u2019t negligently breach its fiduciary duties to the association in connection to Hurricane Irma insurance proceeds and other funds.\nThe latest charges came after a Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation investigation into alleged misappropriation of funds from Colonies II, again following hurricane insurance proceeds disbursements, according to the probable cause affidavit.\nCurtis couldn\u2019t be reached for comment, and his attorney, Elias Hilal, didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment.\nIn a statement to the Miami Herald, Hilal said Curtis\u2019 most recent arrest is tied to \u201cpersonal vendettas.\u201d\nIn other recent allegations involving condo associations, the Miami-Dade State Attorney\u2019s Office charged Yissely Herrouet, a former manager at The Club at Brickell Bay condo tower in Miami, over allegations she hired\n\u201cphantom employees\u201d\nto work at the building, who in reality were her family members and acquaintances, according to the arrest warrant. She is accused of diverting $142,000 from the association.\nUnit owners at the Palm Bay Yacht Club Condominium won a\n$5.8 million\njury verdict in December against South Florida Condominium Management and a $550,000 jury verdict against D&amp;R Contracting in connection to a hefty 40-year recertification assessment for the building. In that case, considered one of the largest in South Florida concerning condo management, unit owners in part alleged some of the work was falsely presented as \u201cemergency,\u201d allowing for the circumvention of approval by unit owners.\n",

        "content": "The $10 million sale of a\nMar Vista\nhome has set new records for the Westside neighborhood.\nThe five-bedroom, six-and-a-half-bathroom home at 11948 Modjeska Place bests the community\u2019s previous priciest-ever residential deal set in September 2024, when 3400 Greenwood Avenue sold for $7.1 million. Modjeska Place, which traded off market for roughly $1,639 per square foot, is also\nMar Vista\n\u2019s first residential deal ever to hit eight figures.\nCompass\u2019 Paul Salazar was the listing agent, while the brokerage\u2019s Tracey Becker brought the buyer.\nProperty records show a trust tied to Robert Green was the seller, who had tapped architecture firm Woods + Dangaran to design the custom build that was completed about five years ago to serve as the family home.\nNow, a Venice family that was looking for more room will enjoy the residence\u2019s more than 6,100 square feet looking out onto the San Gabriel Mountains and Downtown Los Angeles.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rare property,\u201d Salazar said of the home and the price it commanded. \u201cThis just shows that there are a lot of buyers in this price range looking in Mar Vista.\u201d\nIn the neighborhood\u2019s hill section, located east of Centinela Avenue, lot sizes of 10,000 square feet or more are common and about double Mar Vista\u2019s average lot size of around 5,000 to 6,000 square feet, Salazar pointed out. The Modjeska Place home sits on about a 16,000-square-foot lot.\nSalazar said his client had several buyers view the property and sales in the $4 million to $7 million range are not uncommon for the neighborhood, pointing out \u201cit\u2019s just a matter of time\u201d before Mar Vista sees more $10 million sales.\nBecker, who was one of the listing agents on last June\u2019s sale of 1215 Appleton Way in nearby Venice, said buyers looking for more room and who want to remain on the Westside are helping drive demand in Mar Vista and the general area. The Appleton Way property sold for $9.5 million, or $1,109 per square foot, to become Venice\u2019s priciest residential deal.\nThe hunt by families seeking more room has been further padded with increased demand from Palisades fire-impacted property owners who remain looking for either temporary or permanent housing.\n\u201cWe had the big surge of people looking for homes post-fire and now we\u2019re seeing that there are a lot of families who have finally settled with insurance and are finally figuring out what they\u2019re able to do,\u201d Becker said. \u201cThey\u2019ve had a moment to sit with it and decide if they want to rebuild and settle in the Palisades. It\u2019s an ever-evolving process because there are different tranches of people in different phases of their recovery.\u201d\nThe\nMeasure United to House L.A. tax\nwithin the city of Los Angeles, of which Mar Vista is a part of, hasn\u2019t stopped dealmaking.\nThe so-called\nmansion tax\n, which assesses a 4 percent levy on real estate deals starting at $5.3 million and then jumps to 5.5 percent beginning with sales of $10.6 million, applied to the Modjeska Place trade.\nThe seller on Modjeska Place was already aware of the\ntax\n, which triggered the 4 percent tier, and amounted to about $400,000.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a conversation with the sellers,\u201d Salazar said of Measure ULA. \u201cThey\u2019re not happy about it and they\u2019re always asking is there a way to get around it.\u201d\nIn short, the answer is no.\nFor a furnished home, a seller might break out the sale of the pieces into a separate transaction. In other cases, buyers and sellers may agree to split the price of ULA, although regardless of whether that conversation happens, the\ntax\nis still factored into pricing.\n",

Business First reported, citing new\ndata\nfrom StorageCafe. In the past decade, the city has seen 1.4 million square feet of real estate repurposed into self-storage space.\nThe city ranks eighth in the country when it comes to the most self-storage space converted from other uses;\nChicago\ntops the chart with nearly 4.4 million square feet over the past decade. Los Angeles is expected to add more than 226,000 square feet of new self-storage space through adaptive reuse, making up 60 percent of the current under-construction storage space in the city. That puts L.A. in second place when it comes to under-construction storage conversions behind Irving, Texas.\nA majority of the converted space is in buildings that were once offices. Those office-to-storage projects make up 57 percent of the total conversion inventory in the city with more than 806,000 square feet. Industrial properties are the second-most popular conversion type with more than 529,000 square feet being turned into self-storage.\nDespite being one of the country\u2019s top markets for self-storage conversions, Los Angeles is still considered undersupplied, according to StorageCafe. Los Angeles and New York City each have 2.1 square feet of storage space per person \u2014 the lowest ratio among the top 10 markets. Philadelphia and St. Paul, Minnesota, have 3.3 square feet per person, and Chicago boasts 3.5 square feet per person.\nAll of Los Angeles\u2019 self-storage conversion projects are located in federally designated\nOpportunity Zone\nareas, signifying the focus on revitalizing underutilized neighborhoods.\n\u201cLos Angeles stands out as a prime example of an undersupplied urban market where self-storage conversions offer a practical, community-oriented solution\u2026 by repurposing underperforming commercial buildings,\u201d StorageCafe said in a statement, per L.A. Business First.\nLast month, the Los Angeles City Council\nvoted to expand\nthe citywide adaptive reuse ordinance beyond high-density hubs in an effort to reach its housing goals, making it easier for developers to convert vacant offices into residences.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "More Chicago suburbs are tightening regulations on short-term rentals.\nSkokie officials passed an ordinance Monday setting up a pilot program to ban new investor-owned short-term rentals in the village. And the Evanston City Council is considering passing tighter regulations to cap the number of short-term rentals in the city.\nThe changes add to a\ngrowing list\nof\nlocal governments\naiming to clamp down on the number of vacation rentals offered through apps like Airbnb and Vrbo. Neighbors have complained that dedicated vacation rentals create noise, disruptions and drive up costs in an already strained housing market.\nSkokie\u2019s\nordinance, passed Monday in a 5 to 1 vote by the Board of Trustees, sets up an 18-month test period that will limit new short-term rentals and place fees and regulations on existing ones.\nThe rules prohibit new short-term rentals for investor-owned homes, while allowing existing investors to register to maintain their rentals. New licenses at owner-occupied short-term rentals will be allowed, but the ordinance caps the number of licenses to one per block. The rules also set a minimum of five consecutive nights per stay and limit hosts to only 18 total bookings over the 18-month test period.\nThe rules require owners of existing short-term rentals to register by April 1 in order to keep their license, and the regulations take effect May 1. The rules set a $1,200 license fee for new and existing short-term rentals, and require operators to pay a registration fee of $2,400 for owner-occupied units and $3,600 for non-owner-occupied units. Operators who violate the rules could be fined up to $1,500.\nCommunity Development Director Johanna Nyden said during Monday\u2019s meeting the ordinance would give the village more power to address violations. Nyden said Skokie has 75 to 90 active short-term rental units.\n\u201cWe have no teeth right now,\u201d she said. \u201cThe real problem is we don\u2019t have these enforcement tools to address. We can only suggest right now.\u201d\nVillage Trustee Gail Schechter voted against the ordinance, arguing the limits were arbitrary. Schecter told\nThe Real Deal\nshe would have liked to collect more data on who owns rental properties and the existing demand before limiting them.\n\u201cWe\u2019re ostensibly doing the pilot to collect the data, but I feel like we should have used data to decide how we\u2019re regulating this,\u201d she said.\nIn\nEvanston\n, where a moratorium is currently in effect on new short-term rentals, city officials are proposing overhauling the rules to set a hard cap on the number of short-term rentals in the city and incentivize units owned by the occupant or by city residents, rather than by outside investors.\nThe City Council will consider the proposal at its meeting on Monday, after it was discussed and amended at the Jan. 12 meeting.\nThe proposal would limit the number of short-term rental licenses in the city to 1 per 100 rental units and change the definition of a short-term rental to a rental lasting less than one year, up from less than 30 days. It would also require that new offerings be at least 600 feet from other short-term rentals. Currently, 135 active short-term rentals are in the city, city staff said in January.\nCity officials also proposed a rule requiring the property manager of short-term rentals to live within three miles of Evanston, in an effort to ensure rentals are being operated by Evanston residents. Council members considered creating a hard requirement that short-term rental operators be city residents, but the city\u2019s attorney said during the January meeting that it may open the city up to lawsuits.\nBobby Burns, the 5th Ward council member and a member of the Housing and Community Development Committee, told\nThe Real Deal\nthat Evanston\u2019s\nrising housing costs\nare pricing out residents, and he\u2019s opposed to outside investors using the limited housing supply for vacation rentals.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable with people that are only using it to make a profit, who don\u2019t live in Evanston, who don\u2019t necessarily have a strong commitment to Evanston,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause of how limited we are in terms of land and units that could be used for affordable housing.\u201d\nIn Glen Ellyn, a full ban on short-term rentals is facing a legal challenge from an Airbnb operator in the village. A federal judge in December blocked the city from enforcing the ban against Blakelick Properties, the company suing the village, while allowing the ban to be enforced against other short-term rentals while the lawsuit plays out. The ban took effect in January for other properties, after it was initially paused by the judge and then delayed by the village board.\n",

The property hit the market in February 2025 as part of a three-home portfolio\nPortillo\nand his partners were pitching for a combined $57.4 million.\nThe Dolphin Court sale leaves two properties still on the market, both now repriced. A 16,800-square-foot\npenthouse\nat the Seasons tower on Seagate Drive is asking just under $25 million, down from $32.5 million a year ago. A 5,000-square-foot house on Second Avenue has been trimmed to about $11 million from an initial $12.5 million asking price.\nPortillo\u2019s name was featured prominently in the original listings, but it was removed by the time the Dolphin Court home sold. Still, he remains involved, Chris Covelli told the outlet. He is a principal at C&amp;E Construction, which partnered with Portillo and Theory Design\u2019s Ruta Menaghlazi on the developments.\nCovelli said the team is pleased with the sale, but has no additional projects planned together for now. Portillo and listing agent Dawn McKenna of Coldwell Banker Realty declined to comment.\nRecords show a Covelli-led entity bought the roughly 0.4-acre Dolphin Court site for $5.6 million in late 2022, razed the existing house and built the contemporary waterfront home. The\nproperty features\na glass-edged pool overlooking the bay and high-end finishes, including matte wood floors, black-framed doors and stone countertops.\nThe buyers were represented by Re/Max Alliance Group\u2019s Pat Wilkins, who declined to identify them.\nPortillo sold his namesake hot dog chain in 2014 in a deal reportedly nearing $1 billion. Since then, he has focused on real estate, including retail landlord plays and high-end residential projects.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The development would also include a 15-acre Pilot Point ISD elementary school site, 27 acres of mixed-use space and more than 100 acres of open space, plus trails, parks and amenity centers.\nHillwood\nestimates Lantern could be worth $1.2 billion at buildout.\nUnder the TIRZ agreement, 50 percent of ad valorem taxes generated by the property would be reinvested for 25 years to help fund roads, water, sewer and drainage. The outlet reported that Hillwood executives acknowledged the project\u2019s strain on\ncounty services\n, but argued the incentive is critical to feasibility, particularly before annexation into Pilot Point, which approved a development agreement last fall.\nFarther east,\nOld Prosper Partners\nlocked up an even bigger assemblage. The firm closed Jan. 30 on the 2,870-acre\nCraver Ranch near Denton\n, setting the stage for what city officials have pegged as a $5.1 billion, 17-year buildout.\nPlans call for 7,091 homes, 584 townhomes and 1,515 apartments, along with 1.2 million square feet of commercial space and three schools. A defining feature is its built-in open space, which includes about 380 acres of parks, including a 358-acre central park and more than 30 miles of trails and shared paths. Construction is expected to begin in 2028 and stretch into the mid-2040s.\nDenton has already annexed the land and approved rezoning, along with the creation of a municipal management district that allows infrastructure costs to be financed through future assessments and bond reimbursements.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Elected officials should honor the wishes of tenants who vote for them, right? Not necessarily.\nIn upstate New York, the newly Democratic-controlled City Council just announced it will implement\ngood cause eviction\n.\n\u201cClearly, this is something that the voters wanted,\u201d Council President Sue Steele told the\nTimes Union\n. \u201cThey made it very clear in the outcome of the last election.\u201d\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned from years of covering politics is that no one knows exactly why people vote the way they do. The reasons vary tremendously from one voter to the next. Rarely do they come down to one issue \u2014 or even issues in general.\nThe idea that Troy Democrats won November\u2019s election because they favored good cause eviction is nonsense. Democrats last year (and\nlast week in Texas\n) won races across the country in places that have never heard of good cause eviction.\nThe tailwinds that Democratic candidates now enjoy \u2014 especially a base energized by the Trump presidency \u2014 certainly were a factor in those results.\nBut, for the sake of argument, let\u2019s assume Troy voters did elect Democrats for the express purpose of passing good cause eviction. Should they automatically enact the policy? This is a democracy, after all.\nActually, the United States is a republic. It\u2019s a representative democracy, not a direct democracy. The leaders we elect are supposed to make decisions based on what\u2019s best for society. \u201cThis is what voters want\u201d is not a reason to do something.\nGood cause eviction must be considered on its merits. Like any policy, it has benefits and drawbacks, as I detailed in\na 2022 column\n. Two years later, NYU\u2019s Furman Center spelled out the\nunintended consequences\nlikely to result from a drastic version of good cause proposed for New York.\nThat bill, after furious lobbying by the real estate industry and a two-year statewide campaign executed on landlords\u2019 behalf by\nGeorge Fontas\n, was\nwatered down\nby Gov. Kathy Hochul and passed in April 2024. It established good cause for most multifamily buildings in New York City and gave localities outside the city the option of implementing it. That\u2019s what Troy is pondering now.\nAlbany was the first city to adopt good cause and was followed by Kingston, Poughkeepsie, Ithaca, Beacon, Hudson, Rochester, Newburgh and Binghamton, the town of Fishkill and the villages of Nyack, Catskill, Croton-on-Hudson and New Paltz. If Troy\u2019s bill passes, the Republican mayor is likely to veto it, but she could be overridden.\nUnder good cause, if a tenant is not behind on rent, the landlord must offer a lease renewal \u2014 and if raising the rent more than 5 percent plus the rate of inflation (or more than 10 percent), he can be forced to justify the increase in court. The current threshold is 8.79 percent. Luxury rentals are\nexempt\n.\nHochul pushed the percentages up enough to avoid strangling rents the way her predecessor Andrew Cuomo did by signing the rent stabilization overhaul of 2019.\nBut landlords still hate the idea that they can be compelled to renew a tenant\u2019s lease. That leaves eviction \u2014 a long, expensive and uncertain process \u2014 as the only way to get rid of a disruptive tenant. That can be bad news for the good tenants of a building, too. And it makes it hard to empty a building to fully renovate it.\nRegulations like good cause also deter developers from building rentals, resulting in\nhousing scarcity\nand higher rents.\nThe debate in Troy seems focused on whether tenants need the protection of good cause to be able to report possible housing violations to code enforcement without fear of retaliation. But as noted, that\u2019s just one of many factors to consider.\nOne factor not to consider is the results of November\u2019s election, where much larger forces were at play. Donald Trump has been busy on many fronts, but good cause eviction is not one of them.\n",

        "content": "Texas homebuyers are scoring discounts in droves.\nThree of every four homes in\nthe major cities of Texas\nsold for well under asking price last year, making Texas one of the most buyer-favorable states in the country, according to\nRedfin\n. Nationwide, only Florida exceeds Texas in residential discounts, with West Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale and Miami pushing Austin to fourth place among the country\u2019s biggest metro areas.\nOver 82 percent of homes sold below their original listing price in Austin, the most discounted metro in the state. The share of discounted sales was 79.4 percent in Dallas, 78 percent in Houston and 74 percent in Fort Worth. Altogether, nearly 80 percent of homes sold in the Texas Triangle last year traded at a discount, Redfin shows. Florida tops out with 87.9 percent of homes selling below list price in West Palm Beach and 81.9 percent among all six of the state\u2019s major metros.\nThe data suggests that sellers are still coming to terms with\nthe end of the pandemic-era boom\nthat gave them the advantage during the early 2020s. With\nhousing inventory pushing levels not seen since 2011 across the Texas Triangle\n, the question is whether Texas cities are simply returning to pre-pandemic norms or beginning a substantial decline.\n\u201cI do have a sense that we\u2019re still seeing the unfair comparison, if you will, to Austin at the peak. And it can skew the perception of how well Austin is doing,\u201d said Vaike O\u2019Grady, market research adviser for Unlock MLS.\nAustin-area homes have suffered the greatest drop in value among the top metros in the country since their respective market peaks, according to\nZillow\n. For Austin, that peak was 2022, when the city was enjoying a tech industry renaissance and concomitant migration from California.\nThe post-pandemic decline may already be over, though. Median sale prices and sales activity within the city of Austin itself remained generally stable last year, compared to the year before. Inside city limits, total sales and median prices\nheld flat between 2024 and 2025\n.\nEven so, outlying areas have declined, O\u2019Grady allowed.\n\u201cWilliamson County did see a significant shift in terms of its median sale price [last year], and that\u2019s probably because there\u2019s so much relatively new inventory. It was such a focus of growth for so many years,\u201d O\u2019Grady said.\nAustin doesn\u2019t only have one of the nation\u2019s highest shares of discounted sales; it also saw some of the nation\u2019s steepest discounts. The average price cut for homes that sold below original list price was 9 percent in Austin last year, putting it in 10th place among the country\u2019s top metros, Redfin reports.\nHomebuilding also contributed to oversupply in the exurbs around the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, according to Thaddius Watson, vice president of the Greater Fort Worth Association of Realtors.\n\u201c\nAledo\nis a prime example,\u201d Watson said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of development\nwest\n. Aledo, Weatherford and even further out.\nSouth of the Metroplex\nis the same way.\u201d\nSimilar to Austin, median sale prices dipped only slightly in the Metroplex \u2014 with\nMetroTex\nreporting a single-family sale price decline of 1 percent in 2025, year-over-year \u2014 but fell steeply in outlying areas like Denton County, which saw a\n4.3 percent decline\n.\n\u201cThis narrative that the Austin market is in trouble is just false. I think it\u2019s just in comparison to where we were,\u201d O\u2019Grady said.\n",

Funds managed by New York-based Blue Owl Capital provided the floating-rate refinancing, according to an L&amp;L Holding news release.\nA Walker &amp; Dunlop team that included Dustin Stolly and Aaron Appel, andL&amp;L Holding\u2019s Yong Cho and Susan Raffo arranged the financing.\nThe debt pays off the\n$215 million\nconstruction loan the developers secured in 2023 from Little Rock, Arkansas-based Bank OZK, according to records. It also funds the balance of the office and apartment leasing costs, the release says.\nOak Row, based in Miami and New York, is led by Erik Rutter and David Weitz. The pair have several Miami-Dade County projects on tap, most recently making a splash with the record\n$520 million\npurchase of a waterfront Brickell development site that can be developed with multiple supertalls totaling over 3 million square feet. OKO Group, led by Vlad Doronin, is a partner on the purchase and planned redevelopment.\nNew York-based L&amp;L is led by David Levinson and Robert Lapidus, and San Francisco-based Shorenstein is led by Brandon Shorenstein. Claure Group is former Sprint and SoftBank Group International CEO Marcelo Claure\u2019s investment firm.\nWynwood Plaza\u2019s office building has commitments for 60 percent of the space, according to L&amp;L Holding\u2019s spokesperson. Jeff Bezos\u2019\nAmazon\nleased about 75,500 square feet, and Claure Group leased space for its headquarters. Also,\nOKO Group\nand law firm Weitz &amp; Luxenberg \u2013\u2013 co-led by Perry Weitz, David Weitz\u2019s father and an Oak Row investor \u2013\u2013 have leased offices at Wynwood Plaza.\nThe retail and dining tenants at Wynwood Plaza will include Italian-style steakhouse Luca Steak by Miami chef Giorgio Rapicavoli, according to L&amp;L\u2019s release.\nNearly half of the apartments are leased, according to L&amp;L Holding\u2019s spokesperson.\nElsewhere in Miami, Oak Row is developing a\n399-unit\napartment tower and a\n324-unit\napartment tower, both in Edgewater. It also plans rental projects in\ndowntown Miami\n, across from the Brightline passenger train station, and in North Miami Beach.\nIn other recent refinancings, Terra and New Valley scored\n$129.7 million\nfor the 460-unit Natura Gardens multifamily complex in northwest Miami-Dade County, and Resident Group landed\n$113.8 million\nfor its 279-unit Metro Edgewater rental tower in Miami\u2019s Edgewater. Both deals closed in October.\n",

        "content": "Manhattan office landlords fearful of losing JPMorgan Chase leases to its debuting headquarters at 270 Park Avenue\nneed not yet\nworry.\nThe bank expanded its presence at Brookfield\u2019s 5 Manhattan West by 139,000 square feet in the fourth quarter, according to the\nCommercial Observer\n. The expansion, disclosed in a Colliers office report, brings JPMorgan\u2019s footprint at the Midtown West building to 565,000 square feet.\nFurther details of the deal, including the length of the expansion and the asking rent, were not reported. But the average asking rent in Midtown in the fourth quarter was $84.24 per square foot, according to CBRE.\nJPMorgan also recently\nexpanded\nits footprint at L&amp;L Holding Company\u2019s 390 Madison Avenue, adding 60,000 square feet to its office there. The bank occupies nearly 500,000 square feet at that property.\nThe deals stand out when compared to the bank\u2019s recent opening of a 2.5 million-square-foot, Foster + Partners-designed tower at 270 Park Avenue. The headquarters is designed to accommodate roughly 10,000 of JPMorgan\u2019s 24,000 New York employees.\nAcross the street from there is another building the bank owns, paving the path for what has been\ndescribed\nas a JPMorgan-centric neighborhood.\nBut JPMorgan isn\u2019t ready to consolidate to one office or one area of Manhattan yet. JPMorgan is undertaking a $1 billion renovation of 383 Madison Avenue, the former Bear Stearns building across the street from the headquarters it\nbought in 2008\n.\nIt also recently signed a multi-year renewal on its 270,000-square-foot lease at\n237 Park Avenue\n, a victory for co-owners RXR Realty and Walton Street Capital.\nA year ago, Amazon expanded its presence at 5 Manhattan West by 112,000 square feet through WeWork, which is operating the space on behalf of the e-commerce giant.\nOther tenants at the 16-story office building include\nweight loss startup Noom\nand Whole Foods, which leases 60,000 square feet of retail space at the property.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Even as David Werner is on a dealmaking streak in the distressed office market, he and partner Joseph Mizrachi have dragged fellow investors Rubin Schron and David Lowenfeld into a $167 million alleged loan default in Chicago.\nSchron\u2019s New York-based firm\nCammeby\u2019s International\nand David Lowenfeld\u2019s New York-based World Wide Group allegedly defaulted on a commercial mortgage-backed securities debt tied to the ground beneath the building at\n300 South Riverside Plaza\n, according to loan servicer reports. The alleged default marks a dramatic escalation of distress at the 1.1 million-square-foot West Loop office tower, where a complex ownership structure has finally buckled.\nThe alleged ground default was triggered by the building\u2019s leasehold owners, New York-based Werner\u2019s eponymous firm and Boca Raton, Florida-based Mizrachi\u2019s Third Millennium Group. While they\u2019ve been in alleged default on their own $175 million building loan from South Korea-based Shinhan Investment Corp. since 2023, they had still been making ground lease payments to Schron and Lowenfeld. But those stopped late last year, too, as the October installment was the first payment missed, loan servicer reports show.\nBy allegedly withholding rent, the building\u2019s owners effectively pulled their ground landlords into the abyss. Schron and Lowenfeld\u2019s $167 million ground debt \u2014 originated by Morgan Stanely and split across the MSBAM 2015-C22 and MSC 2015-MS1 loan pools \u2014 was transferred to special servicer LNR Partners, a subsidiary of Starwood Property Trust, in November for \u201cimminent default,\u201d loan data shows.\nThe hammer has already dropped. Arne Shulkin\u2019s team at LNR sent a formal notice of default on Nov. 21 and officially accelerated the loan to be fully due ahead of maturity on Dec. 11, notes from the special servicer said. A local lawyer has been retained to explore foreclosure litigation and the appointment of a receiver. While LNR is \u201cdual-tracking\u201d the process by discussing workout alternatives, the move toward litigation suggests the era of extend and pretend has reached its limit.\nSo far, the path forward for the leasehold default is unclear. Shinhan didn\u2019t return a request for comment on whether it would resume ground lease payments if it seized the building from Werner and Mizrachi.\nRepresentatives of the firms led by Werner, Mizrachi, Schron and Lowenfeld also didn\u2019t return requests for comment, nor did LNR Partners.\nThis collapse highlights the inherent volatility of the bifurcated ownership model, which splits the land from the building to boost returns \u2014 a strategy long championed by players like\nJay Shidler\n, whose similar gambits have sunk multiple deals in Chicago, including at the Loop\u2019s\nBurnham Center\n.\nWhile these deals may offer upfront benefits, they often become unsellable in high interest rate environments. The strategy has also fueled recent carnage for\nShaya Prager of Opal Holdings\n. Lender GreenState Credit Union recently completed a foreclosure on Prager\u2019s suburban Chicago office campus, after his firm\u2019s default on the $104 million Deerfield property encumbered by a similar ground lease structure.\nAt the 23-story tower on 300 South Riverside, the property\u2019s fundamentals have been shredded by tenant departures. Zurich North America recently\nditched the property for the Willis Tower\n, and\nCars.com slashed its footprint\n. Now, with the ground and the building in simultaneous alleged loan defaults, the very foundation of the deal is being wiped out.\nStill, the setback at the property hasn\u2019t stopped Werner from making other plays. He and partner 601W Cos. just this week purchased the building at\n175 West Jackson Boulevard\nout of distress for $41 million. That is about 87 percent less than the $306 million prior owner Brookfield Properties spent to buy it in 2017.\nWerner also teamed up with 601W last year to buy the building at\n303 East Wacker Drive\nat a big discount from its previous purchase price.\nHe\u2019s going even bigger in New York. To close 2025, Werner struck a\n$270 million deal to buy One Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld Plaza\nat 885 2nd Avenue in Midtown East, about half off its previous purchase price in 2019. And earlier in 2025,\nWerner and partner MetroLoft scored a $700 million loan\nfrom Madison Realty Capital for the office-to-residential conversion project at 235 East 42nd Street.\nWerner and 601W in November also closed a\n$165 million purchase\nof the 532,000-square-foot office building at 205 East 42nd Street in New York.\nAt the same time, Mizrachi\u2019s firm is also trying to make moves. Third Millennium last year\nrevived its effort, in partnership with Hines\n, to find an anchor tenant for an office development it wants to build in Chicago\u2019s West Loop, next to the 31-story building they constructed together at 540 West Madison Street a decade ago. The new plan would be a 28-story tower consisting of over 600,000 square feet of office space at 590 West Madison.\n",

        "content": "Brookfield is reaching into its own pocket to refinance a piece of lower Manhattan\u2019s crown jewels.\nThe Canadian investment manager is nearing an $800 million CMBS loan for 225 Liberty Street, a 44-story, 2.4 million-square-foot office tower that\u2019s part of Brookfield Place, Bisnow\nreported\n. Brookfield is contributing roughly $173 million of fresh equity to help refinance a $900 million CMBS loan that dates back to 2016 and comes due this week.\nThe financing, originated by Citi Real Estate Funding, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of Nova Scotia and Wells Fargo, carries a fixed rate of just under 5.9 percent on a five-year term, according to ratings agency KBRA. That\u2019s a notable step up from the prior loan\u2019s 4.7 percent rate, according to S&amp;P Global, reflecting the higher-cost capital environment facing even the best-in-class office assets.\nKBRA pegged the tower\u2019s latest appraised value at $1.3 billion. The building was about 90 percent leased as of November, with Brookfield Properties itself the largest tenant, occupying more than 535,000 square feet.\nOne uncertainty at the property is Saks Global, which signed a 233,000-square-foot office lease at in 2014, but filed for bankruptcy last month. Its lease runs through 2031, but the company is delinquent on rent and its space is being treated as vacant in KBRA\u2019s loan analysis.\nThe refinancing comes shortly after Brookfield\nextended its ground lease\nwith the Battery Park City Authority for the entire Brookfield Place complex through 2119. Brookfield pays the authority about $7 million a year under the lease with scheduled step-ups baked in over time.\nOriginally developed in the late 1980s as the World Financial Center by Olympia &amp; York, Brookfield Place spans 14 acres and includes office towers at 200 and 250 Vesey Street along with a vast retail concourse.\nIn a recent investor presentation, Brookfield pegged the complex as its most valuable office holding globally, valuing it at $4 billion within the firm\u2019s $1 trillion portfolio.\nBrookfield and its affiliates have remained active in the CMBS market, closing large packages last year at Five Manhattan West and 660 Fifth Avenue.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Giddey bought the 7,800-square-foot townhouse at 429 West Superior Street through an opaque land trust, a common move for high-profile buyers looking to keep their names off public filings, the Chicago Tribune first\nreported\n.\nThe purchase plants the 6-foot-7 guard in Kingsbury Estates, a\nRiver North\nenclave that has long attracted pro athletes.

It has six bathrooms, an elevator, heated floors throughout and an attached, heated 2\u00bd-car garage outfitted with a Tesla charger. A ground-floor family room doubles as a home theater, while the fourth floor opens to a lounge with a dedicated terrace.\nThe home also features a double-island white kitchen with gold accents, accordion doors opening to a pergola-covered terrace, glass-front wine storage tucked beneath the staircase and a primary suite featuring Koroseal wallpaper and Ann Sacks tile. The top floor also has a second terrace.\nThe\nsellers\n, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon and his wife, bought the home for nearly $2.2 million in 2020 and completed what listing materials described as a \u201ccomplete renovation.\u201d According to the outlet, they stayed close to the home, moving down the block to a $7.2 million house they bought in June.\nThe townhouse carried a $43,597 tax bill for 2024, records show.

        "content": "As the artificial intelligence industry booms, so does the Class A office market in the Bay Area.\nLast year, the region netted 14 of the\u00a0 100 largest\noffice leases\nin the U.S. for a total of 4.3 million square feet, the Silicon Valley Business Journal\nreported\n, citing data from CBRE. AI companies and large tech employers led the pack as many firms either expanded their footprints or planted their first flags in the area.\nSan Francisco had four of the largest lease deals in the region, eight were in Silicon Valley and one each was in the East Bay and the Peninsula, up from 11 the year prior. AI firms now occupy at least 6 million square feet across Silicon Valley alone.\nNo other portion of the country has seen\nAI funding\ncome close to the Bay Area\u2019s approximately $100 billion in investment since 2020, per CBRE. Overall, the Bay Area saw a 2 percent increase in leased space, joining Manhattan at 3 percent as the only markets in the country to see notable gains in office leases.\nVacancy in the area remains high, hovering around 33 percent in San Francisco and reaching near record levels in the Peninsula. The numbers haven\u2019t scared away firms, especially large players like OpenAI and Anthropic.\nAnthropic just leased the entire 420,000-square-foot building at 300 Howard Street, adding to its 250,000 square feet nearby at\n500 Howard Street\nand\n100,000 square feet at 505 Howard\nit leased late last year. Earlier this month,\nDatabricks expanded\nits offices in Sunnyvale\u2019s Cityline development to 455,000 square feet, adding to its 305,000 square feet at an adjacent building\nleased last summer\n. OpenAI is reportedly in talks to\ngrow its San Francisco offices\nby about 250,000 square feet, taking its total office space in the city to roughly 1 million square feet.\nThe Bay Area\u2019s office leasing patterns mirror larger national trends. Last year, the largest office leases in the U.S. largely consisted of expansions rather than relocations. Demand for space was concentrated in top-tier buildings in central locations for employees. In the Peninsula, tech companies and other employers have been attracted to office buildings in walkable downtowns near Caltrain stops and other amenities.\nHigh-end buildings attracted 90 percent of leasing activity in the fourth quarter, per Colliers data cited by the Business Journal. The Bay Area at large saw a second consecutive quarter of positive net absorption. With construction of new offices slowing and demand for premium buildings surging, tenants might eventually have to fight over the region\u2019s older inventory as newer offices get snapped up.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A $10.9 billion merger between Comerica and Ohio-based Fifth Third has officially closed, creating the nation\u2019s ninth-largest bank and throwing a fresh spotlight on one of downtown Dallas\u2019 most closely watched office buildings.\nThe combined company now controls $294 billion in assets and will operate under the Fifth Third corporate name, though customers won\u2019t see an immediate rebrand. CEO Tim Spence said the bank will continue doing business as both Fifth Third and Comerica until technology systems are unified,\naccording\nto an interview with The Dallas Morning News.\nThat transition period \u2014 expected to stretch through a systems conversion planned around Labor Day \u2014 means the Comerica name will stay across North Texas, including atop the 60-story Comerica Bank Tower downtown at 1717 Main Street and at Globe Life Field in Arlington.\n\u201cOur intent today is to do the systems conversions over Labor Day weekend,\u201d Spence told the paper, adding that the bank wants to avoid confusing customers in Comerica markets by switching names too quickly.\nThe pause offers at least temporary certainty for the downtown skyscraper. The tower\u2019s naming rights are tied to Comerica\u2019s lease, which runs through 2028 and covers about 200,000 square feet of the building\u2019s roughly 1.5 million square feet. Spence told the outlet that about 350 employees work out of the tower, though Downtown Dallas Incorporated pegs the number north of 1,000.\nThe building\u2019s future has drawn outsized attention as downtown grapples with office vacancies, quality-of-life concerns and the\nlooming departure of AT&amp;T\nfrom its longtime headquarters. The Comerica tower was\nsold\nin 2024 to Toronto-based\nSlate Asset Management\nand is managed by Stream Realty, which has\nfloated\na major redevelopment that would add hotel and residential components.\nSpence signaled no immediate shake-up. Asked whether Fifth Third might break the lease or exit early, he said there are \u201cno firm plans on that front,\u201d though he acknowledged discussions with the landlord about redevelopment scenarios.\n\u201cThe landlord may have a lot of different plans,\u201d Spence said. \u201cWe have to have a dialogue with them about what their vision is.\u201d\nBeyond downtown,\nComerica\nalso operates a Business and Innovation Hub at Frisco\u2019s Star Tower, announced in 2022. The hub employs about 350 people, though that figure may shift after a previously disclosed round of 184 layoffs set to take effect in March.\n\u201cWe like having a city center presence,\u201d Spence said. \u201cSo we do expect to have multiple office locations.\u201d\nDallas-Fort Worth will remain one of five major employment hubs for the merged bank, he said, even as the company works to streamline and reduce redundancies across the merged banks.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Before Steve Ross set his sights on a 1980s waterfront condo in West Palm Beach, Joey Columbo was picking up units in the building with the foresight that a developer would soon come knocking on doors with a buyout offer.\nColumbo, a Palm Beach-based investor and broker, identified Southbridge Condominium, a three-story complex at 3915 South Flagler Drive, as a future teardown redevelopment site along West Palm Beach\u2019s coast. Between 2021 and 2023, he acquired eight units for a combined $1.6 million, records show. During the same period, he joined four other partners to buy 19 more units for a combined $4.2 million.\nFour years later, Columbo is walking away with a hefty payday after selling his eight units for a combined $6.4 million, and the joint venture selling its 19 condos for a combined $19 million to\nRelated Ross\n, records show. Since 2024, Ross\u2019 firm has acquired 45 of the 63 condos at Southbridge with the most recent round netting 27 units at an average price of nearly $941,000 per unit for a combined\n$25.4 million\n.\nDevelopers like Ross are paying large premiums to avoid the years\u2011long grind he went through, Columbo said.\n\u201cThese big developers are ponying up so much because they don\u2019t have the risk appetite or the patience to do what I did, slowly buying them up,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just offering massive numbers. They\u2019re paying for the premium of not having to wait, and having it done in one fell swoop.\u201d\nSpotting Southbridge before the rush\nColumbo said he zeroed in on Southbridge in 2021, shortly before the collapse of\nChamplain Towers South\nin Surfside triggered a wave of government reforms forcing condo associations to fix older buildings with expensive special assessments. At the same time, deep-pocketed developers are pursuing bulk condo terminations to acquire potential redevelopment sites.\n\u201cI was driving over the bridge one day, and I was like, \u201cWow, that\u2019s the perfect place for a [high-rise] condo,\u2019\u201d Columbo said. \u201cAnd this was pre\u2011Surfside collapse. Condo buyouts weren\u2019t as prevalent as I think they are today.\u201d\nHe paid an average of $202,000 per unit as he quietly amassed condos at Southbridge over a two year period, records show.\n\u201cI found a unit on the market, and I bought it,\u201d Columbo said. \u201cAnd then over the next two years, I ended up with 42 percent of the condominium.\u201d\nCompleted in 1981, Southbridge sits directly on the Intracoastal, near\nMar\u2011a\u2011Lago\n, President Donald Trump\u2019s private club and home. Turning Southbridge into a bulk play meant working multiple purchases spread over months while dealing with a condo board wary of a takeover, Columbo said.\n\u201cIt was a slow and difficult process because I was picking off one unit owner at a time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was 30\u2011something individual negotiations and deals over the span of two years.\u201d\nPrices kept rising as word spread that someone was trying to corner the building, he said.\n\u201cEvery deal was challenging from the standpoint that these units weren\u2019t on the market, so it was going up in price,\u201d Columbo said. \u201cOnce the board started getting wind of it, obviously they didn\u2019t like it, and they tried to stop it through lots of arbitration.\u201d\nRoss steps in \u2014 and pays up\nAs Columbo built his position, he envisioned that he and his partners could redevelop Southbridge themselves.\n\u201cI actually brought in my partners with the hopes of it being a Four Seasons,\u201d he said. \u201cThey saw the site, and they loved it.\u201d\nBut then\nRoss\nbought 10 units in the complex in 2024.\nThat meant his joint venture could not move forward with its redevelopment dream, Columbo said. Now, Ross controls the majority of Southbridge, having spent roughly $37 million for 45 units, or about $844,000 per unit on average, according to real estate database Vizzda and other published reports.\nColumbo sold his eight solely-owned units to the Ross affiliate at $800,000 apiece, more than triple his average basis. The joint venture sold its units at $1 million each.\nRoss\nhas emerged as one of the dominant players in West Palm Beach, with a portfolio of office, residential and mixed\u2011use projects along the downtown and waterfront corridors.\u00a0 Ross has not publicly disclosed plans for the Southbridge site, though market observers expect a redevelopment to target the upper tier of the luxury market, given the prices paid per unit and the land\u2019s waterfront positioning.\nSouthbridge sits just outside the urban core in what Columbo calls an increasingly coveted stretch of South Flagler Drive.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of the new gold coast of West Palm. The views are amazing,\u201d he said.",

The movie house went dark in 2024 and faced permanent closure before Stewart stepped in.\nThe venue will need a lot of love before it can reopen to moviegoers. The three-story building has a partially intact mezzanine and stage, but significant renovation and rehabilitation efforts will be needed to bring it back to its former glory.\n\u201cThere are so many beautiful details that need to be restored,\u201d Stewart told Architectural Digest. \u201cI think there\u2019s a way to bring the building back to life in a way that embraces its history but also brings something new to the neighborhood and something new to the whole L.A. film community. That\u2019s the point \u2014 new ideas.\u201d\nArchitect Lewis Arthur Smith, known for envisioning other local theaters like the Vista Theatre in\nLos Feliz\nand the El Portal Theatre in\nNorth Hollywood\n, designed the Highland Theatre. Coincidentally, another actor-turned-director, Quentin Tarantino,\npurchased the Vista in 2021\nand reopened it two years later, while a group of filmmakers led by director Jason Reitman acquired the nearly 100-year-old\nVillage Theatre in Westwood\nin 2024.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize I was looking for a theater until this place came to my attention.

The actor is hopeful for the future of art in an entertainment industry increasingly dominated by reboots, revivals and the rising presence of artificial intelligence. \u201cWhen people are desperate, they start doing desperate things,\u201d Stewart\nsaid\n. \u201cI think buying this theater feels a little desperate in, like, the most beautiful way.\u201d\nThe actor\u2019s restoration endeavor is \u201cnot just for pretentious Hollywood cinephiles,\u201d she added. \u201cI see it as an antidote to all the corporate bullsh*t, a place that takes movie culture away from just buying and selling.

Bonham is a Fannin County town about 30 miles east of\nSherman\n\u2014 Texas\u2019 northernmost city linked directly to downtown Dallas via highway \u2014 and 40 miles northeast of McKinney, the nearest Metroplex commuter hub.\nUnlike other recently announced master-planned communities replacing farmland throughout North Texas, including Sanchez &amp; Associates\u2019\nPowder Creek Ranch\nproject outside Bonham, Asher Oaks will be centrally located. The 27-acre site, a former golf course, is across the street from Bonham High School.\nAmong four master-planned communities in the pipeline for Bonham, Asher Oaks will be the first to start construction, according to City Manager Sean Pate. Sanchez plans to build 3,000 homes, including multifamily units, in Powder Creek Ranch near State Highways 121 and 56. Last April, the city approved a public improvement district for The Preserve at Bonham, a 200-acre mixed-use development off U.S. 82 where Fieldside Development plans to build 1,000 single-family homes. And Rockhill Capital and Investments is planning a 600-acre development with multifamily units, single-family homes and condominiums near Bois D\u2019Arc Lake, one of two newly completed reservoirs.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t have a\nwater crisis\n. We\u2019ve got that taken care of,\u201d Pate said.\nAsher Oaks isn\u2019t expected to have a multifamily component, but two commercial lots are waiting for development, according to the release. Asher Lane Bridal already operates on another commercial lot.\nAsher Oaks isn\u2019t D.R. Horton\u2019s northernmost development in Texas, but it\u2019s close. It\u2019s just south of U.S. 82, the highway that generally hugs the Texas-Oklahoma border. Sweetwater Springs near Sherman is the company\u2019s only Texas community north of U.S. 82, according to\nBuilder Guides\n.\nD.R. Horton did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first of many for D.R. Horton,\u201d Pate said.\n",

        "content": "The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has signed off on more than $40 million in loans for affordable housing developments across the county.\nOverall, the county has approved nearly $43.8 million for affordable housing projects in the cities of Los Angeles, West Hollywood and Whittier, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n. The $43.8 million provides a fraction of capital stacks that combine for $562 million. When finished, the developments would provide 687 affordable units for seniors, families and homeless individuals.\nNew High Village, a proposed development at a county-owned parking lot at 725 North Spring Street in\nChinatown\n, will receive nearly $14 million for two residential components. The county will provide $7.2 million for a 158-unit senior apartment complex, which is expected to cost $101 million total, and $6.6 million for a 146-unit family apartment complex, believed to cost about $142 million. New High Village will also boast 14,000 square feet of commercial space and a public plaza.\nIn the unincorporated community of Windsor Hills, PATH Ventures is slated to receive $10 million for a new supportive housing complex on a vacant lot at 4615 Slauson Avenue. The proposed PATH Villas Windsor Hills building would rise six stories with 122 studio and one-bedroom apartments above a parking garage. Total development cost is estimated at $87 million.\nNear the beach in Venice, Hollywood Community Housing and Venice Community Housing\u2019s Venice Dell project will receive $3 million from L.A. County; that\u2019s on top of the more than\n$42 million that the state has already committed\nto the development. Venice Dell will consist of low-rise buildings containing 120 apartments and ground-floor retail on a parking lot at Venice Boulevard and Pacific Avenue.\nIn West Hollywood, developer\nCommunity Corporation of Santa Monica\nwill get $3.6 million for the redevelopment of a property owned by the city of West Hollywood at 1047-1057 North Crescent Heights Boulevard. The effort, expected to cost $34.3 million in total, would result in a five-story building with 40 studio and one-bedroom units for senior residents. The county is also providing\nLinc Housing\nwith $4.3 million for a new supportive housing complex at 1238 Larrabee Street in West Hollywood. Those plans call for 49 units with an overall estimated cost of $32 million.\nIn the eastern Los Angeles County municipality of\u00a0 Whittier,\nNational CORE\nand Prima Development will benefit from $9 million in county funds for its Telegraph Apartments project, helping with the $33.9 million projected budget. The developers are planning for 51 apartments for large families at 14250 Telegraph Road.\nThe latest funding comes after the California Strategic Growth Council\napproved $866 million\nin grant funding for affordable housing across the state late last year. More than $182 million of that will go to four projects efforts in Los Angeles County,\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

According to Rexford, $89 million of impairments related to developments it elected to sell and $60 million of co-CEO transition costs were to blame. The losses were slightly offset by $20 million of gains on sales of real estate.\nRexford has identified six development projects totaling about 850,000 square feet that the company is no longer moving forward with. Rexford has either accepted offers or is under contract to sell the properties, Clark said\nThat goes hand-in-hand with a post-Elliott initiative calling for the company to maximize returns by selling assets and reinvesting capital into share repurchases \u2014 a repeat of a strategy it engaged last year as Elliott circled. That was a departure from buy-happy days, as Rexford peddled seven properties for a total of $217.5 million \u2014 and repurchased more than 6 million shares of common stock for a total of $250 million.\nThe Los Angeles-based real estate investment trust ended the year with a 90 percent occupied portfolio after executing 10 million square feet of new and renewal leases but saw its rents decline 1 percent quarter-over-quarter and 20 percent since a peak reached early 2023, in the current, softer Southern California industrial sector.\nFor the year ended Dec. 31, 2025, net income was $200 million compared to $263 million the year before.",

The lease ranks among the largest office deals in the Peninsula since the pandemic.\nRoblox has established its global headquarters at Bay Meadows, now occupying or committing to more than 1 million square feet at the campus. Artificial intelligence startup\nSkild began subleasing\n32,500 square feet of Roblox\u2019s former digs at 970 Park Place in San Mateo last year.\nThe gaming giant has been growing its headcount in recent years, adding employees at a roughly 15 percent rate annually since the pandemic. Once the new pre-leased buildings at Bay Meadows are complete, the company will have enough space to accommodate 6,000 employees in a walkable hub near housing, retail and the San Mateo\nCaltrain stop\n.\nThe Peninsula is becoming a hotspot for office users looking for premium space outside San Francisco. Approximately 90 percent of leasing in the area last quarter was in high-end buildings filled with amenities, per Colliers data cited by the Business Times. The region saw a second consecutive quarter of positive absorption, with net occupancy gains of 17,674 square feet.\nIn Burlingame, Upstart Holdings leased roughly 54,000 square feet at the newly built 220 Park office building near the\nBurlingame Caltrain station\n. Law firm Paul Hastings is planning a similar move into a modern, transit-adjacent home in 45,000 square feet in downtown Redwood City. Databricks just\nleased additional offices\nat Sunnyvale\u2019s new Cityline development, bringing its total presence there to 455,000 square feet across two towers.\nDemand for older buildings, on the other hand, is falling behind. Some buildings are slated for housing conversions, including GoPro\u2019s former corporate campus in San Mateo. Harvest Properties and Stockbridge Capital Group\nacquired the six-building complex\nlast fall for $102 million with plans to build a 225-unit for-sale residential community.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Mayweather rented the five-bedroom, five-bathroom apartment that spans the property\u2019s 18th and 19th floors in December 2024.\nMayweather stopped paying rent in July and eventually owed upwards of $500,000 in back rent and other damages, but the owners negotiated a settlement with Mayweather for him to repay the rent and other debt by Dec. 2, 2025, the suit claims.\nInstead, Mayweather only paid one of the five months, according to Pulse International Realty\u2019s Rena Kliot, an agent who will be re-listing the unit in the spring.\n\u201cHe had this post he put up on Instagram with stacks of money in front of him, and they sent it to me and said, \u2018well how about using some of that money to pay us,\u2019\u201d Kliot told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe owners put some of Mayweather\u2019s security deposit towards the allegedly unpaid rent, according to Kliot.\nA representative for Mayweather did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nKliot said she plans to list the home for sale, somewhere between $22 and $24 million, or for rent at $150,000 per month.\nMayweather, who was undefeated in his pro career and made over $1 billion in winnings, has turned to real estate investment for a second career and embarked on a shopping spree in recent years.\nMayweather purchased a minority interest in Black Spruce portfolio last year for\n$402 million\n, with an option to buy outright many of the 62 buildings in the portfolio.\nHe launched a real estate firm in 2024, when he put\n$100 million in equity towards a joint venture\nwith Go Partners on a luxury rental portfolio valued at $3 billion.\nBut reporting by\nBusiness Insider\nhas raised questions about Mayweather\u2019s financial stability. The publication pointed to foreclosures on commercial properties owned by Mayweather and lawsuits claiming he failed to pay for millions of dollars of luxury items.\nMayweather\u2019s lawyer, Bobby Samini, previously denied the outlet\u2019s reporting, saying he was not \u201cexperiencing financial strain.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The city is spending $38.4 million to put heat pumps in the 712 units at the Housing Authority\u2019s Beach 41st Street Houses.\nNo need to get your calculators out. I got you. That\u2019s $54,000 per unit.\nMayor Zohran Mamdani shared the first two numbers, but not the third one, on Wednesday in Far Rockaway as he proudly announced the expenditure. \u201cThe need for this infrastructure is urgent,\u201d he said.\nMamdani said when he represented Queensbridge Houses in the Assembly, its residents would tell him \u201cof a heating system that was so unreliable that they would have to regulate the heat themselves, opening up windows, no matter what the temperature was, to try and create some level of stability.\u201d\nA much greater problem is when the heat doesn\u2019t work at all, which happens quite a bit at NYCHA developments.\nIt\u2019s one of the reasons that the Housing Authority is both loved and loathed \u2014 often by the exact same people.\nSocialists and NYCHA tenants love the idea of publicly owned, operated and subsidized housing but loathe the terrible condition into which the government has let its developments fall. Many see no connection between these two facts.\nPrivate landlords loathe that NYCHA gets away with a lot of stuff that they cannot.\n\u201cAlthough HPD does cite the housing authority for violations, it does not enforce collection of fines. As a result, a NYCHA property can get hit with dozens of citations and pay\nno penalty at all\n,\u201d Greg Smith wrote in The City in August 2023, eight months after a new law was supposed to start holding NYCHA to the same standard as private owners.\nBut these same landlords love having NYCHA as an example of what they say would happen to their buildings if the government took them over. They loved that NYCHA was No. 1 on the \u201cworst landlords\u201d list, until Public Advocate Jumaane Williams took it off the list entirely, perhaps to avoid embarrassing the Mamdani administration.\nPrivate housing providers also love bringing up NYCHA\u2019s spending to show that the government is being disingenuous when it says rent-stabilized owners should be able to renovate units for $15,000 or\n$30,000\nor even\n$50,000\n.\nThose amounts come from actual laws and government programs \u2014\nindividual apartment improvements\nand\nUnlocking Doors\n. Meanwhile, NYCHA spends well over $400,000 to fully renovate one of its units.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nDoes Gary Segal and Brad Zackson\u2019s\nDynamic Star\nhave any hope of finishing its massive Fordham Landing project?\nThe eight-year-old firm was hit with a\nforeclosure suit\nin October and sought\nbankruptcy protection\nin December for itself and the entities with equity stakes in the development. Last year, after the state kicked in $55 million in infrastructure work, Zackson claimed to be on track to deliver 900 affordable units in 2026.\nThe second phase of the project, which doesn\u2019t even have zoning approvals, calls for 1.8 million square feet of mixed-income housing, 744,000 square feet of office and 143,000 square feet of retail. The firm is looking for new investors. Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Bill Weidner, who runs a\nLocal Law 152\ninspection business with his brother, a master plumber, also has a real estate podcast called Realty Speak. I joined Ann Korchak of the Small Property Owners of New York as a guest on the\nlatest episode\nto talk about rent-stabilized housing and other New York real estate topics. It\u2019s also on\nSpotify\nand\nApple Podcasts\n.\nElsewhere\u2026\nMy colleague Liz Cryan reported that Related Companies CEO\nJeff Blau\nsaid a new city law requiring bird-friendly glass added $2 million to the cost of a city-funded affordable housing project. Blau\u2019s point seemed to be that the city was working at cross-purposes.\nAnother question is whether that $2 million could have saved more birds if spent some other way. Cats kill an estimated\nfour times more birds\nthan windows do (see the chart below from New Hampshire Audubon). Perhaps spending $2 million to neuter 15,000 cats would be better for birds.\nThat math is not going to persuade any volunteer who partakes in the heartbreaking task of collecting dead birds from sidewalks beside glass buildings.\nPoliticians also have a hard time putting efficiency before emotion. I have yet to hear one suggest that the billions of dollars spent on sidewalk sheds to comply with the city\u2019s draconian facade statute could be used to save more lives than\nLocal Law 11\ndoes.\nNo elected official wants to be blamed for the death of another\nGrace Gold\n, even if the alternative is 10 deaths \u2014 blamed on someone else.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$19 million\nfor a 6,850-square-foot house at 78 Morton Street in the West Village. Jeremy V. Stein and Kat Trappe of Sotheby\u2019s had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$30 million\nfor 12,552 square feet of vacant commercial land at 539 West 54th Street in Hell\u2019s Kitchen.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$13.5 million\nfor a 4,678-square-foot condominium unit at 158 Mercer Street in Soho. Jim St. Andr\u00e9, Trevor Stephens and Michael Maniawski of Compass have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 52,660-square-foot, eight-story, 60-unit project at 3070 Williamsbridge Road in the Bronx. Panagis Georgopoulos filed the permit on behalf of Floriand Lulaj.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

In the same meeting, the city approved an agreement with other Greene entities to support the improvement of Currie Park, the 13-acre park adjacent to many of the West Palm Beach properties Greene owns and plans to develop.\nConstruction started on One West Palm in 2019, with the expectation that it would be completed in 2022. Greene purchased the 3.3-acre development site for $10 million in 2014, according to property records.\nDesigned by Arquitectonica, the towers are set to include 326 apartments, 201 hotel rooms, 200,000 square feet of office space, and amenities like a fitness club, spa, movie theater, pools and indoor tennis courts.\nBut construction was mired in squabbles with the city and legal fights with the contractor from early stages. In 2020, Greene\nthreatened to halt construction entirely\nif West Palm Beach didn\u2019t grant him a requested zoning change.\nThe agreement between Greene and the city to finish One West Palm puts a wrap on a legal spat that started in the fall. Greene\nsued West Palm Beach in October\n, alleging the city was improperly stalling approvals for a separate condominium project, a pair of Herzog &amp; de Mueron-designed buildings slated for his 4.5-acre site at 2175 and 2251 North Flagler Drive.\nNow he\u2019s agreed to a land swap and to pay $6 million for the city to connect Northwood Road to Currie Park. With the dust settling, he can move forward with the Herzog &amp; de Mueron condos, which still need final approvals, he said.\n\u201cOnce we have those done and we get approved, then we\u2019ll be in a position to start marketing these condos,\u201d he said. But, \u201cThat\u2019s probably six months away until we can open a sales office.\u201d",

        "content": "Acre won approval for an apartment complex adjacent to a 48-acre waterfront park in Miami, agreeing to create public parking and offering a $1 million mitigation payment to the office of a Miami City Commission member.\nThe 337-unit project, called Adela II, would rise at 645 Northeast 64th Street, just south of Legion Park and west of Acre\u2019s 236-unit Adela at MiMo Bay apartment complex.\nThe project has financing in place, including a loan from Canyon and equity from Acre\u2019s Fund VI, said Jesse Kehoe, Acre\u2019s director of development in Miami.\nThe project is awaiting permits after Miami\u2019s Planning, Zoning and Appeals Board this week approved a zoning request allowing Acre to build the complex as a single 530,000-square-foot development across the 17-lot assemblage. The previous zoning allowed for 700,000 square feet.\nThe firm expects to start construction in two or three months, Kehoe said.\nAt least 20 workforce housing units are part of the plan, as well as 5,000 square feet of retail, a public paseo and a 502-space parking garage to include 76 spaces for public use.\nAcre will give Miami City Commission Commission Chairwoman Christine King\u2019s office $1 million for use within her district, Acre\u2019s attorney Nicholas Rodriguez-Caballero said. King\u2019s district includes Legion Park and the Upper Eastside neighborhoods north of it as well as Overtown, Wynwood, Little Haiti and Liberty City.\nAcre still needs the Miami City Commission to deed NE 64\nth\nTerrace to Acre, since the road runs through the development site. The street will be reworked as a two-way entrance for the parking garage.\nThe market-rate units will charge roughly the same rents as Adela at MiMo Bay, Kehoe said. That complex, at 6445 Northeast 7th Avenue, was\ncompleted in 2020\nand was\nrefinanced for $72 million\nlast year. Apartments there rent from $2,500 to almost $5,000 a month, according to its website.\nAcre, co-led by Miami-based managing partner Michael Van Der Poel, persuaded the city in 2024\nto rezone\nthe bulk of the 3.25-acre assemblage for buildings up to eight stories high, despite fierce opposition from neighbors. That rezoning capped development rights at 337 apartments and forbade future owners from using the state\u2019s\nLive Local Act\nto increase density.",

        "content": "A private equity firm whose founder ran into trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission over a decade ago bought an Office Depot-anchored mixed-use site in Hialeah for $23.1 million.\nAn affiliate of Miami-based Volta Global, led by Marko Dimitrijevic and Jeff Evans, acquired a strip mall and a two-story big box store with a\nself-storage\ncomponent at 5301 West 20th Avenue, records and real estate database Vizzda show. The two-story building is leased to\nOffice Depot\nand A+ MIni Storage. The price amounts to $4.1 million per acre.\nThe South Florida self-storage market is experiencing a slowdown in rent growth and an oversupply of storage units, according to Yardi Matrix. Meanwhile, strip malls and outdoor shopping centers are the most sought-after retail real estate assets in South Florida.\nThe seller, an entity managed by A+ Mini principal\nRaul Nu\u00f1ez\n, paid $3.9 million for the 5.6-acre site in 2001, records show. The buildings were completed in 1978 and 2008.\nVolta Global has developed or acquired 4.2 million square feet of self-storage,\nmultifamily\n, and hospitality properties in the U.S. and Europe since its founding in 2014, according to the firm\u2019s website. It owns 1 million square feet of self-storage space in the southeastern U.S.\nDimitrijevic did not respond to a request for comment.\nHis Swiss-based global investment fund Everest Capital collapsed the same year he established Volta Global, after betting heavily that the Swiss Franc would fall in value against the Euro between 2014 and 2015, published reports state. However, in 2015, the Swiss National Bank announced it was lifting its caps on Euro exchanges, and the Swiss Franc shot up by more than 30 percent.\nEverest closed within days, and investors lost a majority of their investments, according to a 2020 settlement with the SEC. Regulators determined that Everest was over-exposed in the euro investment, yet Everest assured investors that their funds were safe, the settlement states.\nWithout admitting or denying the findings, Everest and Dimitrijevic agreed to be censured, to cease-and-desist from making misleading statements, pay a penalty of $750,000, forfeit $2 million in profits and pay $458,000 in interest, according to the SEC.\n",

Caruso offered that up in an interview with\nKNX News\non Wednesday after the Los Angeles Times published a report alleging Mayor\nKaren Bass\nrequested certain information be removed or \u201csoftened\u201d in the Palisades Fire after-action report. The story cited two anonymous sources.\nCaruso said he needs time \u201cto process\u201d the story but told KNX he\u2019s \u201cworried about the city.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of time to decide, obviously, because we\u2019ve got a looming deadline this Saturday,\u201d he went on to say. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to be meeting and talking to the family and we\u2019ll see, you know, what we decide to do.\u201d\nSaturday is the deadline for mayoral hopefuls to file formal paperwork declaring their run for office.\nThis reverses course from the announcement Caruso made last month in which he underscored the significance of the private sector in serving communities and said that would continue to be his focus rather than elected office. Should Caruso change his mind, it sets the stage for a rematch between himself and Bass after the two ran against one another for the mayor\u2019s seat in 2022.\nIt would also shake up a mayoral race that just saw Austin Beutner, a former L.A. deputy mayor and Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent, drop out of the race on Thursday. That leaves a\nlandscape\nof mostly longshot candidates that include civil engineer Asaad Alnajjar, Democratic Socialists of America member\nRae Chen Huang\n, former \u201cThe Hills\u201d reality TV star\nSpencer Pratt\nand more than 20 other hopefuls.\nA spokesperson for Caruso did not respond to requests for comment Thursday.\nBass\u2019s office called the Times report \u201cmuckraking journalism at its lowest form,\u201d in a statement to\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\u201cThe mayor has been clear about her concerns regarding pre-deployment and the [Los Angeles Fire Department\u2019s] response to the fire, which is why there is new leadership at LAFD and why she called for an independent review of the Lachman Fire mop-up,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThere is absolutely no reason why she would request those details be altered or erased when she herself has been critical of the response to the fire \u2014 full stop. She has said this for months.\u201d\nThe mayor\u2019s office declined to address Caruso\u2019s comments on what he finds problematic with the city and its leadership.\nWhile Caruso shied away from explicitly saying whether Bass should resign based on the claims of the Times story, he clearly thinks the city is lacking on a few fronts.\nHe pointed to potholes on the street, dirty sidewalks, public safety concerns and Downtown Los Angeles\u2019s unfinished residential and retail project Oceanwide Plaza. The $1.2 billion mixed-use development is known as the graffiti towers after Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding to continue construction and the towers became marred with graffiti.\nLast week,\nBloomberg\nreported a deal may be in the works with a buyer. Still, after years sitting in its current state, Caruso likened the towers to a beacon to the world \u201cthat this city is somehow in crisis.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why we have leadership that somehow feels that corruption and doing bad things is OK, and we need to hold people accountable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just shouldn\u2019t be allowing our leadership to be doing the kind of things that, frankly, embarrass the city and don\u2019t represent the greatness and goodness of the city or the people of the city.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s real estate pros are banking on a new Cook County Assessor taking office, after spending years\nlamenting changes\nto the local property tax system.\nTop real estate developers like Magellan Development CEO David Carlins, CRG CEO Shawn Clark and Riverside Investment and Development CEO John O\u2019Donnell have all made five-figure donations to Patrick Hynes\u2019 campaign to oust incumbent Assessor Fritz Kaegi in the March 17 Democratic primary, public records show. Carlins has given at least $40,000, while O\u2019Donnell and entities with ties to his firm Riverside have donated a total of $30,000, records show.\nHynes, who has served as the tax assessor for the southwest suburban Lyons Township since 2021 and worked in the Cook County Assessor\u2019s Office for two decades prior, has so far courted donations from leading Chicago real estate professionals as well as construction labor unions.\n\u201cFor too long, Fritz Kaegi\u2019s unpredictable and volatile property tax assessments have left Cook County working families struggling to pay the bills,\u201d an endorsement from the Chicago Federation of Labor read. \u201cPat will put the Assessor\u2019s Office back on track, giving Cook County\u2019s working class the certainty of rational and predictable assessments.\u201d\nSo far, Hynes has collected at least $235,000 from real estate-related figures, making up about 22 percent of his total donations, an analysis of public campaign finance data from\nThe Real Deal\nfound. Multifamily investor Stuart Handler\u2019s firm TLC Management, Related Midwest executive Don Biernacki, former Cinespace owner turned real estate investor and lender\nAlexander Pissios\nand developer Warren Baker all chipped in for Hynes, as well.\nKaegi, who was elected in 2019, has become politically vulnerable over the last few years. Commercial real estate players have slammed his approach to re-assessing property values in the wake of the pandemic.\n\u201cThe fact that the assessments of office buildings are continuing to increase with no acknowledgment of the impact of the pandemic doesn\u2019t seem objective. It\u2019s not consistent with what\u2019s happening in other markets or what\u2019s happening in our market,\u201d Farzin Parang, executive director of the Building Owners and Managers Association of Chicago, said when the latest downtown assessments were released in November.\nKaegi was also subject to an investigation led by the Chicago Tribune and the Illinois Answers Project that found he missed\n$444 million in increases to taxable value\namong properties in Cook County that had recently been renovated.\nAnd during the current assessment cycle, he took heat for sending tax bills out\nfour months later than usual\ndue to technical issues, though his office wasn\u2019t solely to blame.\nIn July, the Cook County Democratic Primary\nendorsed Hynes over Kaegi\n.\nStill, Kaegi came in as a reform candidate after associates of the prior assessor, Joseph Berrios, were\ncaught up in corruption scandals\nthat led to multiple members of his office facing criminal charges.\n\u201cHe is a fair and honest person and we need more of that,\u201d said Kim Krerbis, a Chicago-based residential real estate agent with @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate who donated to Kaegi\u2019s campaign.\nThe campaign put out a press release criticizing Hynes for accepting over 100 political donations from property tax attorneys, calling the support \u201ca massive conflict of interest,\u201d and Kaegi seeks to distance himself from developers.\n\u201cWhen big commercial properties get tax cuts they don\u2019t deserve, homeowners pay for it. It\u2019s a blatant conflict of interest that the Cook County Inspector General has been sounding the alarm on for years,\u201d Kaegi told\nTRD\n. \u201cIt\u2019s why I\u2019ve never taken a dime from property tax appeal attorneys and never will.\u201d\nKaegi\u2019s campaign finances found attorneys listed who work at law firms that offer property tax services but the individual donors appeared to specialize in other areas, a\nTRD\nanalysis of public records found. Since the last election cycle, Kaegi has accepted about $400,000 in donations from real estate-related figures, making up about 6 percent of his total donations, public records show.\nKrebis said she sees Kaegi\u2019s reform efforts as attempts to level the playing field between major corporate landlords and developers and the average homeowner.\n\u201cIf you are a wealthy person on the North Side, I can see how you would not want Kaegi to continue,\u201d Krebis said. \u201cHe has reviewed the city as a whole and seen that people on the South Side are being over-assessed.\u201d\nThe local union representing government workers, The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 31, is also backing Kaegi.\n\u201cOur union endorsed Assessor Kaegi for reelection because he has championed important reforms to how assessments are made in Cook County \u2014 making the system fairer for working families \u2014 and because he respects the expertise and dedication of the union members who work in the assessor\u2019s office,\u201d said Anders Lindall, AFSCME Council 31\u2019s Director of Public Affairs.\nBut a long list of construction-related unions have donated to Hynes\u2019 campaign, including local chapters of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the Chicago Federation of Labor, Plumbers Local and the Chicagoland Associated General Contractors, among others.\nRepresentatives of the construction unions that donated to Hynes didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nDevelopers in the city often blame fluctuations in property tax assessments for the\ncity\u2019s historic drought in multifamily construction\nand a growing list of\nstalled megaprojects\n.\nShortly after taking office in 2019, Kaegi was tasked with re-assessing commercial properties in the wake of the pandemic. As commercial properties lose value, the county\u2019s tax burden gets shifted onto residential property owners.\nMeanwhile, residential property owners in lower-income areas of the county have still been hit with major increases in property values, and thus their share of the county\u2019s tax bill. West Garfield Park experienced\nthe steepest increases\nin the most recent cycle, with median homeowner bills up nearly $2,000, or 133 percent. Kaegi has attributed such patterns to the\nCook County Board of Review\u2019s willingness to slash property values\nfor commercial landlords who file appeals of their assessments.\nIn response, Hynes\u2019 campaign has stressed that as assessor, his role would be to attract more business and development to the city to expand its tax base and spread the burden across more taxpayers. If elected, he plans to establish a Department of Economic Development within the Assessor\u2019s Office.\nSo far, it appears that business leaders have taken notice of Hynes\u2019 approach. The Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce and the Illinois Restaurateurs Association both made donations to his campaign.\nNot everyone in the industry has been convinced yet. Longtime real estate investor Bob Wislow\u2019s firm Parkside Realty, as well as JDL Development\u2019s Jim Letchinger, who is taking on the Lincoln Yards turnaround project renamed as Foundry Park, have each donated to Kaegi\u2019s campaign instead of Hynes. So did Chicago-based real estate investment firm JRG Capital Partners. Letchinger and representatives of Parkside and JRG didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nEarly voting in the primary began Feb. 5. Whoever wins the Democratic primary is heavily favored to win the general election in November against the only other candidate in the race, Libertarian Nico Tsatsoulis.\n",

The plan would include a mix of senior housing, townhomes and apartments, at a site that for nearly a century anchored the\nGalewood\nneighborhood with industrial jobs.\nThe factory, which produced Snickers, Milky Way and 3 Musketeers bars, shut down in 2024 after about 95 years in operation. Chicago-based McCaffery was\nselected as developer\nshortly after the closure. While the Spanish Revival-style administrative building along Oak Park Avenue has landmark status and will be preserved, the rest of the campus is up for redevelopment.\nMcCaffery\noutlined its concept during three community meetings in December, but some residents said the proposal leans too heavily toward housing in an area already seeing a wave of residential development.\n\u201cWe have developments at Sears, we have developments at U.S. Bank, and now we have this development,\u201d Michael Nardello, vice president of the Galewood Montclare Community Organization, told FOX Chicago.\nHe was referring to the major overhauls that included some combination of multi-story rental apartments and retail, including at the former Sears location at the northeast corner of North and Harlem avenues, and the former U.S Bank site at 6700 West North Avenue. Those projects attracted more opposition than support from residents, who were pushing for single-family homes or condominiums, arguing that apartments could harm the neighborhood\u2019s quality of life.\n\u201cThe community is kind of concerned about the impact with density, safety, the streets, the parking,\u201d Nardello said.\nThe community group is calling for a local referendum, as well as traffic and parking studies, before the McCaffery proposal moves forward. Residents said they want investment that brings services and amenities, not just rooftops\nResident Thomas Simmons told the TV station that a library or a youth center that could provide recreational or apprenticeship programs is a higher priority for the neighborhood than more housing.\nAlderman\nChristopher Taliaferro\n, who represents the 29th Ward, said the proposal is far from finalized. In a statement, he noted that McCaffery\u2019s concept followed earlier community meetings \u2014 some held years ago \u2014 that generated ideas ranging from light manufacturing and green space to retail and mixed-use development.\nGiven recent changes in the neighborhood, Taliaferro said more discussions are needed, particularly around the residential component. He stopped short of endorsing the plan, saying continued community engagement will determine whether it ultimately earns his support.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A Santa Clara County judge has put the kibosh on a lawsuit by the town of\nLos Gatos\nall because of a simple three-letter word.\nSanta Clara County Superior Court Judge Helen E. Williams dismissed a lawsuit from the town that aimed to clarify the state\u2019s housing law and potential application of builder\u2019s remedy in the Bay Area enclave, the Mercury News\nreported\n.\nThe lawsuit centered around the meaning of the word \u201cthe\u201d in a certain portion of the Permit Streamlining Act, which dictates rules for the approval process for housing developments across the state. The town of Los Gatos interpreted the law to mean that developers only get one 90-day resubmittal period to fix incomplete applications. The\nCalifornia Department\nof Housing and Community Development said the opposite, stating developers can have an indefinite number of 90-day periods to resubmit amended applications.\nLos Gatos\nfiled the lawsuit last April\nagainst Arya Properties LLC, the developer behind the Arya, Luxe and Vista Capri projects. The developments were proposed under\nbuilder\u2019s remedy\n, which allows developers to construct buildings of any desired height and size in cities that don\u2019t have a state-certified housing element. Los Gatos filed the suit after the town deemed the developer\u2019s Arya and Luxe preliminary applications were incomplete after two resubmittals.\nThe judge sided with the state\u2019s view. The judge said the town of Los Gatos interpreted the law based on the phrase \u201cthe 90-day period,\u201d where \u201cthe\u201d meant the resubmittal period itself was a one-off. Williams ruled that \u201cthe\u201d is written in the law to reduce repetition and ensure coherence in the legislation without limiting the number of 90-day periods allowed. The law also suggests that \u201cmultiple resubmissions in response to succeeding incompleteness determinations may be made without a preliminary application expiring,\u201d she said.\nFollowing the judge\u2019s ruling, the town vowed to continue processing Arya Properties LLC\u2019s applications and committed to complying with state housing requirements, saying it has approved or is processing applications for developments that would make up more than 80 percent of the units called for in the town\u2019s Regional Housing Needs Allocation.\n\u201cWe respect the court\u2019s role in interpreting state law and appreciate the clarity provided by this order,\u201d Mayor Rob Moore in a statement. \u201cWe will carefully review the decision with our legal counsel and continue to fulfill our responsibilities to the community to provide affordable housing and implement the Housing Element.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The Dallas Morning News\nreported\nthat the terms of the deal were not disclosed. The property, which stretches along I-35, had been marketed to multiple buyers before the Glendennings struck a deal with the Pace family, which owned the land for more than 75 years.\nThe site sits about 70 miles north of Downtown Dallas and roughly 65 miles from Downtown Fort Worth \u2014 territory that until recently sat beyond the immediate reach of large-scale suburban development, according to the publication.\nGlendenning envisions a\nmixed-use project\nthat could bring thousands of residential units as well as sizable industry to the area. Early concepts call for the northern 400 acres to be developed with housing, while portions of the southern acreage could be carved out for logistics or industrial uses.\nPlans are still being made, but Glendenning told the outlet that the site could support between 800 and 1,000 single-family homes, along with 2,000 to 3,000 apartments. Talks are also underway with grocery operators.\n\u201cThe I-35 corridor is experiencing significant growth in the logistics sector from the Fort Worth Alliance area through Denton and Sanger,\u201d Glendenning told the outlet. \u201cWe feel the Gainesville area is next in line for the right development and project. I\u2019d rather be early to the party than late.\u201d\nCaleb Lavey of Glendenning\u2019s Frisco-based firm Rex Real Estate handled negotiations on the transaction.\nGlendenning\u2019s newly acquired land sits just north of a proposed 1,000-acre BNSF Railway logistics park planned between Sanger and Valley View, and just last week H-E-B closed on roughly 600 acres in Cooke County also near Valley View, about 60 miles north of Fort Worth and 17 miles from Denton.\nRex Real Estate is focused on land along the region\u2019s fast-growing \u201cGolden Corridor\u201d near the Dallas North Tollway and Preston Road. Glendenning\u2019s resume includes working with Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones on a logistics land assembly in Sanger, where Blue Star Land and Crossland Development pieced together about 278 acres along I-35 in 2021.\nGlenndenning also announced in September that he plans to move Rex Real Estate out of Frisco and back to\nCelina\n, closer to some of the brokerage\u2019s newest projects. Glendenning is eyeing a\nmass timber office building\nof 40,000 to 60,000 square feet for the new headquarters. He hopes to start construction in the fall. Celina is about 40 miles north of Downtown Dallas and has a population of about 30,000.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A Chicago-based developer is pushing ahead with plans to turn a long-dormant Downtown Fort Worth office building into hundreds of apartments, adding to the city\u2019s growing slate of office-to-residential conversions.\n3L Real Estate is converting the 16-story former\nOncor building\nat 115 West Seventh Street into a 330-unit apartment building, CEO Joe Slezak\ntold\nthe Dallas Business Journal. Interior demolition is underway, with the main construction phase expected to begin within the next month or two. Slezak said the project should wrap in less than two years.\nWhile declining to put a total price tag on the redevelopment, Slezak told the outlet that the firm is investing more than $20 million into the roughly 300,000-square-foot building. Fort Worth-based Bennett Partners is serving as architect, and Hasen Holdings is the project\u2019s general contractor.\nThe building, constructed in 1952 as the headquarters of Fort Worth National Bank, was designated a historic landmark in 2024. Its mid-century exterior \u2014 with a slab-and-tower design and rust-colored brick \u2014 will be preserved, Slezak said, even as the interior is fully rebuilt.\nPlans call for a mix of studios, one-bedroom and two-bedroom units, along with amenities including a rooftop deck and fitness center. The ground floor will retain restaurant space, including Little Red Wasp and Capital Grille. The building sits within walking distance of the Trinity Railway Express station and the emerging Texas A&amp;M\u2013Fort Worth campus.\nPublic incentives are part of the capital stack. Board members overseeing a\ntax-increment financing zone\nalong the Lancaster corridor approved $4 million in infrastructure reimbursements for the project, according to the publication. In exchange, 20 percent of the units will be offered at below-market rents for at least 10 years.\nHasen Holdings President David Hasenzahl said the former Oncor building is unusually well-suited for a residential conversion, particularly on floors five through 16, due to the design of the building\u2019s exterior perimeter walls and windows.\nThe project marks 3L Real Estate\u2019s 13th acquisition overall and its second in North Texas. The firm is also working with Hasen on another office-to-apartment conversion at\n501 Elm Street\nin downtown Dallas.\nSlezak said the timing aligns with broader investment flowing into Fort Worth\u2019s urban core, including the $700 million overhaul of the Fort Worth Convention Center and the Texas A&amp;M campus now under construction.\nOther downtown Fort Worth buildings slated for residential conversions include the Binyon-O\u2019Keefe Building at 210 East Seventh Street and\n811 Calhoun Street\n, which is planned as a 100-unit senior housing project.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Griffin Capital\n\u2019s latest refinancing shows what it takes to get a cash infusion in\nAustin\u2019s sluggish multifamily market\n.\nThe Los Angeles-based investor landed a $47 million loan for an apartment complex it completed in 2024 near the Domain. The loan will be used to refinance 1900 Parmer, a 364-unit apartment complex at 1900 East Parmer Lane, according to a release from Berkadia. Hancock Whitney Bank provided a $34.3 million construction loan for the property in 2020, according to loan documents.\nBerkadia\u2019s Mitch Sinberg, Scott Wadler, Brad Williamson, Matt Robbins and Patrick Johnson arranged the deal. The refinancing, which was provided by Boston-based MF1 Capital, works out to $129,000 per unit. The property was last valued at $65.5 million, appraisal district records show.\nThe apartment complex was 98 percent occupied when the loan closed, according to Berkadia. It offers studios and one- and two-bedroom apartments, plus amenities like a pool, gym, dog park and clubhouse.\nAustin\u2019s multifamily market tanked\nafter a glut of new apartments were built at the same time, causing rents and occupancy to drop. As a result, it\u2019s tougher to get fresh financing for local projects, but 1900 Parmer has the dual benefit of being a new property in a high-growth area.\nThe property is in north Austin about six miles from the Domain, the city\u2019s premier office destination. As tech companies reverse the trend of gobbling up\nAustin office space\n, the Domain has persisted as a strong office submarket. In 2025, the area netted one-third of the space among\nthe city\u2019s largest office leases\n.\nGriffin developed 1900 Parmer as part of its first Qualified Opportunity Zone Fund. The firm has since launched additional\nOpportunity Zone\nfunds, raising a total of $2 billion in equity. The funds manage a portfolio of 32 properties in various stages of development across the Sun Belt.\n",

The buyers took out $53.1 million in loans for the purchase, consisting of a $28.6 million Freddie Mac senior debt and a $24.5 million subordinate loan from an entity tied to Spira.\nCompleted in 1989 on a nearly 20-acre site, Falls of Bonaventure consists of a pair of five-story apartment buildings and a one-story clubhouse.\nThe selling entity ties to Fairview, New Jersey-based low-income housing developer\nRoizman Development\n, which paid $9.8 million for the property in 1993, according to records. The selling entity also ties to New York-based Related Companies and the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Coconut Grove-based Related Group, records show.\nThe two Related companies previously were partners, with their founders starting to invest together in South Florida real estate in the 1970s. Related Companies was founded by Steve Ross, who in 2024 stepped back from the firm to start and lead West Palm Beach-based\nRelated Ross\n, which is exclusively focused on South Florida. Related Group\u2019s founder is Jorge P\u00e9rez, who still leads the firm with his sons, Jon Paul P\u00e9rez and Nicholas P\u00e9rez.\nOver the years, Ross\u2019 stake in Related Group waned, and in 2022, he publicly stated\n\u201cjust kind of split recently, very amicably,\n\u201d referring to Related Group. The firms are major investors and developers in South Florida, where both started out as affordable housing developers.\nFoundation For Affordable Housing, co-founded by Tom and Deborrah Willard, and led by Darrin Willard, has a portfolio of over 300 properties nationwide with nearly 38,000 units, according to its website. It\u2019s been a sporadic investor in South Florida low- and moderate-income housing.\nIn 2024, Foundation For Affordable Housing sold the 172-unit Woodsdale Oaks apartment complex at 2543-2595 Northwest 49th Avenue in Lauderdale Lakes for\n$20 million\nto Spira Equity. The firm also sold the 123-unit senior independent living Federation Plaza building at 3081 Taft Street in Hollywood for\n$29.7 million\n. Related Companies was the buyer.\nSpira, led by managing partners Stephen Ho and Robert Lee, is an affordable housing investment firm with a portfolio of $700 million in assets owned, spanning more than 3,300 units, according to its website.\nAffordable housing apartment complexes are a coveted asset among investors in South Florida, largely due to pent up\ndemand\nfueled by the region\u2019s ever-increasing cost of living and lagging incomes.\nIn 2024, New York-based Fairstead bought the 177-unit affordable housing complex at 3144-3146 Northwest 19th Street in Lauderhill for\n$26.5 million\n, at the time starting renovations.\n",

The estate spans about 5 acres in the ritzy Los Angeles-area enclave and has a nearly century-long history.\nCagney built the stone villa around 1939 and owned the home until his death in 1986. The following year, his widow Frances Cagney sold the property to its current owner Steven Dunn, founder of baby product company Munchkin.\nThough Cagney lived in his Beverly Hills abode while filming movies like \u201cYankee Doodle Dandy,\u201d he spent his off time at his farms in upstate New York and Martha\u2019s Vineyard, according to the Journal. While one might expect a star to live in a luxurious estate, the property under Cagney\u2019s ownership was relatively humble, save for a studio with a wooden floor and record player where he practiced dancing.\nWhen the Beverly Hills property came under Dunn\u2019s watch, the entrepreneur expanded the home to approximately 6,000 square feet with three bedrooms. In the 1990s, Dunn purchased an adjacent parcel and combined the properties into one 5-acre compound. Besides the main house, the property also has a 2,500-square-foot guest house, a pool, a pool cabana with an outdoor kitchen, and tennis and pickleball courts.\nDunn also owns a property next door that isn\u2019t for sale. The owner is selling because he is \u201cready for a change,\u201d\nAaron Kirman\nof Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California, who is marketing the property, told the Journal. Dunn and his ex-wife Laura listed another Beverly Hills estate in 2019 for $72 million; that property is now owned by Laura Dunn.\nDespite\nMeasure ULA\nimposing transfer taxes on all sales above $5 million and a\nlooming billionaire tax\nthat voters could approve in November, the\nluxury market in Los Angeles\nis seeing interest tick up. \u201cWe have a lot more buyers looking at properties across all price points,\u201d Kirman said. \u201cThere\u2019s pent-up demand and not a lot of inventory.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The latest exit out of Beverly Hills brokerage Hilton Hilton is Justin Alexander, who packed up his business and most of his team to head to The Agency.\nAlexander, along with Tab Howard and Jeremy Lingvall, are now based out of The Agency\u2019s Beverly Hills office. Doris Tan, who was previously on Alexander\u2019s team remains, with Hilton Hilton as one of three agents \u2014 the others being Conrad Hilton and Jack Shulruff \u2014 at the brokerage led by chair Rick Hilton.\nAlexander\u2019s exit follows the September departure of Hilton Hilton co-founders and co-CEOs\nBarron N. Hilton and his wife Tessa Hilton\n, who struck a deal with Compass to bring their business to the brokerage\u2019s Beverly Hills and Palm Beach offices. The couple said in a joint statement to\nThe Real Deal\nat the time that their departure from Hilton Hilton was a \u201cstrategic move\u201d for themselves and clients \u201cfor long-term success in an increasingly competitive market.\u201d\nAlexander\u2019s move ends his long run working with Rick, who co-founded\nHilton &amp; Hyland\nwith the late Jeff Hyland.\n\u201cWith over 12 years working alongside Rick Hilton and Jeff Hyland, I\u2019m deeply grateful for our long history together,\u201d Alexander said in a statement.\nDespite that history, Alexander said The Agency\u2019s Aspen office makes sense as he and his family spend more time in Colorado. Meanwhile, The Agency\u2019s Beverly Hills office allows him and his team to continue their work locally, particularly given the $1.8 billion netted in career sales.\n\u27a4 Jon Grauman and Adam Rosenfeld\u2019s Side-backed brokerage\nResident Group\nbrought on Kevin Stewart from their former firm, The Agency, to serve as a partner. It\u2019s the first major announcement out of the former \u201cBuying Beverly Hills\u201d stars\u2019 Resident since the brokerage launched in June 2025.\nStewart brings more than $500 million in volume with his move to Resident and also comes full circle with his change of scenery. He previously worked with Grauman and Rosenfeld when the two ran the Grauman Rosenfeld Group at The Agency.\n\u27a4 Assisting those who lost their homes from the Palisades Fire to find temporary housing, navigate insurance or plan rebuilding became the basis for Danny Brown and Jenifer Porter starting Porter &amp; Brown Real Estate Advisory Group at\nCompass\n. The two, who are joined by Porter\u2019s son, Oliver Porter, are based out of the brokerage\u2019s Beverly Hills office and offer real estate, design and development services.\nThe launch of Porter &amp; Brown follows over two decades selling homes for Brown, who can count over 450 closings and more than $150 million in inventory both on- and off-market.\nJenifer brings to the newly launched advisory her expertise as an interior designer with A-list client work in her portfolio. That includes 2571 Wallingford Drive, the $60.9 million mansion purchased in 2023 by Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck, and Kendrick Lamar\u2019s home at 1707 Westridge Drive in Brentwood, which he purchased in 2024 for about $40 million.\n\u27a4 Elsewhere at Compass, the brokerage recruited Monica Antola from Rodeo Realty. Antola had more than $21 million in sales last year and focuses on Pacific Palisades and other L.A. coastal markets.\nAntola\u2019s joined by Angel Collins and Ann Marie Ahern, who also moved their business from Rodeo Realty to Compass. The duo, who brought their seven-person team, are based out of Sherman Oaks.\nThere\u2019s also former Engel &amp; V\u00f6lkers agents Reza Badakshan and Naomi Kalkanoff, who closed over $25 million in deals last year.\nMeanwhile, Ben Bellet, who is making the move from a focus on the Westside to Westlake Village, hung his license with Compass Beverly Hills. He joins from Keller Williams and counted over $22 million in volume last year.\nMarv Peters brings over two decades of experience in commercial and residential to the brokerage\u2019s Beverly Hills office. He was most recently with Ram Financial &amp; Investment.\nRob Kellner left Avenue Realty Group to join Compass, with a focus spanning West L.A. to the San Gabriel Valley.\nIn Orange County, Wyatt Parker made the jump from Side to Compass as he works on selling in and around San Clemente, after closing on $17.5 million in volume last year.\n\u27a4\nColdwell Banker Realty\n\u2019s Foothills offices have seen several new faces join across the Pasadena, La Ca\u00f1ada and San Marino markets. Lori Ramirez, who manages the three offices, put a focus on recruitment for the past 12 months, coming up with a haul of 29 agents with over $200 million in volume to their names. About half of those new recruits hopped over in the past three months.\nIn January, that included a raft of agents from Engel &amp; V\u00f6lkers, including Wendy De Leon, Barbie Eland, Ano Fekete, Stacy Petrossian and Andrew Petrossian. Additionally, Tony Wise came from\u00a0 Keller Williams Realty, and Ryan Judd joined from Sans Investment Corps.\nIn December, Ramirez recruited from Engel &amp; V\u00f6lkers Ida Altounian and Kathy Boghossian. From Keller Williams Realty, there was Kimberly Brill and Lisa Renee Manley. Additionally, Nicole Deflorian joined from Clint Lukens Realty.\nMeanwhile, November saw the addition of more Keller Williams Realty alumni in Alison Huddy and Jason Huddy.\n\u27a4 Rodeo Realty remains on its own recruiting tear with the additions of Stephanie Elena in Sherman Oaks, Brett James in Studio City, Joan Gardner in Brentwood and Jessica Sparks-Schaefer in Beverly Hills.\n",

The deals for the properties are complete, but the sale price of both could not immediately be discerned.\nWhile the properties feature the same seller, they do not feature the same buyer. Lodging investor Gencom is picking up the 253-key Manhattan building, while Trinity Investments is acquiring the 300-key building in the nation\u2019s capital.\nWestbrook did not respond to a request for comment, while Trinity declined to comment. The founder of Gencom, meanwhile, released a statement highlighting \u201ccompelling long-term opportunities\u201d in the Big Apple.\nSuch opportunities exist in the luxury hotel market across the country. Last year, revenue per available room across luxury chains rose 5.1 percent, according to CoStar. For the entire hotel industry in the nation, there was a decline last year in the industry standard metric.\nNevertheless, it\u2019s a sector Westbrook is increasingly looking to exit. In November, Blackstone agreed to buy the 277-key Four Seasons hotel at 757 Market Street in San Francisco for about\n$130 million\n, or $469,300 per key.\nThe transaction represents Blackstone\u2019s first hotel purchase in San Francisco in about a decade. The price is notably under the $181.6 million that Westbrook was asking when\nit listed the property\n.\nGencom is on the other side of the spectrum.\nA group of investors, including Highgate, Gencom and Argent Ventures, purchased the 36-story, 607-room InterContinental New York Times Square for\napproximately $230 million\nat the tail end of last year.\nThe property was sold by a joint venture of Tishman Realty and Metlife Investment Management and the purchase was financed by a $190 million loan from Monroe Capital.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Veteran Chicago hospitality investor\nJohn Rutledge\nlooks on track to hand over another hotel to his lender after pulling some cash out through a refinancing.\nAn affiliate of Rutledge\u2019s firm Oxford Capital and foreign investors who put nearly $24 million into his 221-room Godfrey Hotel hotel deal in the River North neighborhood are at risk of losing the property to New York-based lender Quadrum Global.\nA foreclosure complaint filed Tuesday in the Circuit Court of Cook County reveals that Quadrum, the hotel\u2019s senior lender, has moved to seize the property at 127 West Huron Street. The legal action follows a depletion of the hotel\u2019s financial runway, marking a downturn for a property that a little more than two years ago was celebrated as a successfully refinanced asset in a difficult Chicago hotel market.\nThe litigation stems from a \u201ccascading default\u201d that accelerated in the final weeks of 2025. According to court documents, the Oxford ownership entity was bound by a loan agreement requiring a minimum interest reserve account of $2.5 million if the property\u2019s debt service coverage ratio fell below certain thresholds.\nWhen the reserve dipped below $1 million in December, the lender issued a formal \u201cReplenishment Notice.\u201d By the middle of last month, the reserve had hit $0, and a debt service payment of more than $572,000 went partially unpaid, leaving a delinquent balance of $124,160, Quadrum\u2019s lawsuit said. This breach allowed the lender to accelerate the entire $63 million primary debt, effectively ending the owner\u2019s control of the cash flow and moving the property toward a judicial sale.\nBut there\u2019s a twist with the ownership: an arm of Quadrum that\u2019s separate from the senior lender entity is also a joint venture investor alongside Rutledge in the property\u2019s equity, as Quadrum is at several other Oxford-operated hotels in Chicago.\nOxford and Quadrum completed development of the Godfrey in 2014. The property\u2019s original developer began construction before the Great Recession on what was meant to be a Staybridge Suites extended stay hotel, but the project stalled with the economic crash and the developer was ultimately hit with a foreclosure lawsuit. Oxford bought the defaulted construction loan and took control of the property in 2012, redesigning and rebranding it as the Godfrey.\nQuadrum\u2019s lending arm refinanced the property with a $63 million loan in 2023, replacing a previous debt of a little more than $47 million and likely allowing the landlords to pocket some of the excess proceeds.\nBut now, there\u2019s $57 million that remains due on the senior loan while there\u2019s a group of foreign investors who chipped $23.5 million into the property through the EB-5 visa program who stand to be wiped out.\nThe\nEB-5 program\nis a federal initiative that allows foreign nationals to obtain U.S. permanent residency \u2014 green cards \u2014 in exchange for investing substantial sums into a project that creates full-time jobs for American workers. For developers like Oxford, this capital is often attractive because it is significantly cheaper than standard mezzanine debt or equity.\nHowever, the Godfrey investors now face the harsh reality of subordination, with the Quadrum senior lender set to be repaid first by any sale or refinancing that occurs. It\u2019s unclear what the Godfrey property is worth today, but nearby North Side hotel sales have been trading at notable discounts from their previous purchase prices, in some cases impairing loans, including at a\nGold Coast hotel that sold for $13 million\nlast month.\nThe senior lender offered the EB-5 group a ten-day window in January to cure the default by paying the $124,000 delinquency and replenishing the $2.5 million reserve themselves to protect their position. The filing of the lawsuit this week indicates that the investors were either unable or unwilling to throw more capital into the project \u2014 they\u2019ve collected interest on their loan for years, however, since at least 2017.\nDespite the legal fire, Rutledge\u2019s Oxford is signaling this may not be a hostile foreclosure. The firm has a history of deeds in lieu of foreclosure, where properties are handed back to lenders amicably to settle debts, and Oxford\u2019s hospitality management arm has stayed on to operate the hotel. In 2024,\nOxford handed four San Francisco hotels back to its lenders\nunder similar market pressures, but remained the operator of the properties.\nEchoes of South Loop Distress\nThe Godfrey\u2019s troubles mirror a larger wave of EB-5 related litigation currently roiling the Chicago lodging industry.\nHotelier\nSu-Mei Yen\nis currently facing an even larger $187 million foreclosure in the South Loop initiated by lender ACORE, as well as three separate lawsuits brought by EB-5 investors who loaned nearly $50 million to the hotel project led by Yen and her daughter, Cassie Yen, including one filed last month.\nThey allege a \u201cscheme\u201d in which the Yens controlled both the borrower and the EB-5 lender entities, creating an inherent conflict of interest.\nWhile one case involving the South Loop property was recently ordered to arbitration, it is scheduled to return to court for a status update this spring, while two others are still in the early stages of litigation in Cook County court.\n",

        "content": "A University of Illinois-led research hub is poised to become the latest buyer of a distressed\nLoop\noffice building, striking a deal to acquire a 16-story building along the Chicago River for roughly $25 million.\nDiscovery Partners Institute is under contract to buy the 1950s-era property at 250 South Wacker Drive from UBS, according to people familiar with the deal and first\nreported\nby CoStar. The agreement comes years after the seller, then Credit Suisse, paid about $90 million for the 259,400-square-foot building in 2011. UBS, which absorbed Credit Suisse in its 2024 rescue merger, is represented by CBRE broker David Knapp. The bank declined to comment.\nThe building is largely empty after Molson Coors Brewing Company agreed to\nrelocate\nits Americas headquarters from most of the property \u2014 a 167,000-square-foot space \u2014 in 2023 to the newly-built BMO Tower across the river. That move left 250 South Wacker Drive struggling to fill space, according to the publication. If the deal closes, it would add to a growing list of\nChicago office\nbuildings trading at deep discounts, particularly those built decades ago and saddled with vacancies.\nWhat Discovery Partners Institute plans to do with the building remains unclear. The institute currently leases space next door at\n200 South Wacker Drive\nand has been searching for a permanent home since its launch. The University of Illinois System confirmed that its board authorized moving forward with a building purchase but declined to share details while the transaction is pending.\nDiscovery Partners focuses on artificial intelligence and quantum computing. For years, the institute was slated to anchor a domed facility within Related Midwest\u2019s 62-acre The 78 megadevelopment, according to the CoStar, but that vision unraveled late last year, when Governor JB Pritzker and state officials announced the institute would no longer move forward at the site, which is also slated for a new Chicago Fire soccer stadium.\nInstead, state leaders have pointed to a sprawling quantum computing campus rising on the former U.S. Steel South Works site as the institute\u2019s long-term ecosystem. Construction there is already underway, with tenants like Israel-based Quantum Machines signing on.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Two condominium towers in downtown San Jose are waiting to be filled, and its owners are ramping up efforts to get residents inside.\nMachine Investment Group\nis\nmarketing\ncondos for sale at 188 West Saint James Street, the Mercury News reported. The property consists of a 22-floor eastern tower with 337 units and a 20-floor western tower with 303 units for a total of 640 homes. Machine Investment Group and building operator Centurion Real Estate Partners are searching for buyers to purchase unsold units at the site.\nThe market appears ripe for buying, Josh Tashjian, managing partner with Centurion Real Estate Partners, told the Mercury News. San Jose is \u201cunderserved by housing\u201d and simultaneously faces \u201csignificant housing demand and great purchasing power.\u201d\nMachine Investment Group acquired the two residential towers from\nZ&amp;L Properties\nin a fast-tracked foreclosure proceeding\nlast June for $181.9 million\n. Machine Investment obtained a $215 million loan from an affiliate of New York-based Benefit Street Partners for the acquisition. Z&amp;L, which\nowned and developed the properties\n, defaulted on a $330 million loan from a Mack Real Estate Credit Strategies affiliate, leading lenders to pursue an expedited deed-in-lieu of foreclosure process.\nAfter Machine Investment acquired the towers, the company vowed to breathe new life into the buildings. The firm is investing $30 million to renovate and upgrade the towers, common areas and amenities ahead of the condo sales. Machine is looking to redesign the lobbies and build out a club on the third floor complete with private workspaces, social lounges, a catering kitchen, an outdoor terrace, a 75-foot pool, a hot tub and barbecue areas.\nAs of Wednesday, 202 of the 303 units in the western tower were unsold, and all 337 units in the eastern tower were not spoken for. But demand is already reportedly picking up, as\nCenturion Real Estate Partners\nis working through a multi-page list of interested buyers, some of which include current occupants looking to buy larger units.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The lender behind one of downtown Dallas\u2019 most ambitious redevelopments\ntook back the keys\n.\nStarwood Property Trust acquired The National, a 52-story mixed-use skyscraper at 1401 Elm Street redeveloped by Shawn Todd\u2019s Todd Interests, after a foreclosure auction Tuesday on the steps of the George Allen Courts Building.\nThe Dallas Morning News\nreported\nthat ownership reverted to the Starwood Capital Group affiliate at a listed purchase price of $207 million, with existing debt used to buy the property.\nThe loss comes amid a torrent of\nbad news for Downtown Dallas\n, which is set to lose office tenant AT&amp;T when it\nrelocates to Plano\n.\nThe foreclosure of The National wasn\u2019t a surprise. Todd told the publication last month that he owed Starwood roughly $230 million and would not contest the proceedings. Starwood filed for foreclosure in early January.\nTodd pointed to the same pressures hitting downtown office and mixed-use assets across the country: high interest rates, falling property values and thinning occupancy. Apartment occupancy at The National had dipped below 80 percent, Todd said, and refinancing talks with\nStarwood\nfailed to produce a viable path forward.\n\u201cWith our debt balance, the interest rate environment and property values downtown, we don\u2019t see a path to us recouping our remaining equity,\u201d Todd told the publication at the time, calling it the first time in 35 years that his firm\nlost money\n.\nThat loss is a steep reversal for a project once held up as a model for large-scale urban reuse. Todd Interests poured more than $460 million into redeveloping the long-vacant former First National Bank Tower, which sat empty for a decade before its transformation. The 1.5 million-square-foot midcentury skyscraper was converted into a mix of apartments, hotel rooms, offices, retail and restaurants.\nWhen the deal was unveiled in 2019, Todd described it as the largest historic tax credit transaction in Texas. The project relied on about $100 million in historic tax credits and $50 million in\nDallas\ntax increment financing to pencil out. Designed by prominent Dallas architects George Dahl and Thomas Stanley, the 1965 tower had been the largest vacant building in North Texas when it closed in 2010.\nWhat comes next for The National is an open question. All six restaurants, including Italian steakhouse and seafood hotspot Monarch, are expected to remain open, according to prior reporting.\nThe foreclosure lands amid a broader reshuffling for Todd Interests. Just months ago, the firm sold its entire stake in the 20-acre\nEast Quarter\ndevelopment to partner J.P. Morgan Asset Management for an undisclosed price. Along with The National, Todd Interests has been behind several marquee redevelopments, including the $300 million overhaul of Energy Plaza into the Sinclair.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "After hanging on through recovery from the Great Financial Crisis and at least partway through the post-pandemic market,\nNew York Life\nis ready to face the music in Schaumburg.\nThe insurance giant has officially hit the market with the Woodfield Corporate Center, a two-building, 711,000-square-foot suburban Chicago office complex that has sat on its balance sheet for nearly two decades. The move signals a major capitulation by one of the market\u2019s most patient institutional players, putting an end in sight to a difficult era for property.\nFor New York Life, the exit has been seventeen years in the making. The firm\u2019s involvement dates back to the 2007 market peak, when it provided a $70 million loan for the 12-acre campus at 425 and 475 North Martingale Road. That bet soured as the subprime mortgage crisis ballooned and shook the entire financial system when it popped.\nIn 2011, the lender officially took the keys from a joint venture of General Electric\u2019s investment arm and Lincoln Property Company via foreclosure.\nSince, the asset has been held as real estate-owned by New York Life. While the firm saw some leasing success in the years following the takeover, reaching over 80 percent occupied at some points, the post-pandemic office environment has made the long-term hold increasingly difficult to justify.\nThe offering is being led by a Colliers team consisting of the recently recruited\nDan Deuter\n, formerly of Cushman &amp; Wakefield; as well as Thomas Denison, Valerie Cook and Lizzie Apgar. Colliers teams are also assigned to Woodfield Corporate Center\u2019s leasing and property management, while a Colliers debt and structured finance team of Ben Greazel, Joel Simmons and Adam Levinson are on the investment sale listing, too.\nNew York Life didn\u2019t return a request for comment and the listing team declined comment.\nThe insurer is likely in a position to rid the asset off its balance sheet and absorb a loss. While there\u2019s no asking price on the listing, the seller likely could have generated a much larger offer, maybe well beyond than the original $70 million loan amount, in the years leading up to the pandemic, but New York Life opted to hang on.\nHolding turned out to be the wrong move, as the suburban office market is facing a brutal post-pandemic reckoning. Institutional owners are increasingly being shaken out by the combination of high interest rates and cratering demand for traditional suburban campuses. Office vacancy was at a\nrecord high of nearly 33 percent\nin the Chicago suburbs as of last quarter.\nAnd foreclosures abound, setting up more potential opportunities for discounted offices in the northwest suburbs.\nFor instance,\nZack Markwell\n, the CEO of Atlanta-based real estate firm Stonemont Financial Group, owns a large portfolio of commercial real estate in the Chicago area encompassing a handful of major office properties, including the two-building former Motorola campus in Schaumburg, that were pulled into a $664M foreclosure lawsuit last year to settle the unpaid balance of a nearly $1 billion loan issued right before the pandemic.\nSuch opportunities in Chicago\u2019s suburbs are providing buyers such as\nAlfred Teo\n\u2014 who bought the Schaumburg Towers property in 2024 out of an $84 million foreclosure lawsuit \u2014 chances to reset the values of troubled office properties by buying cheap and investing in upgrades to help them stand out to tenants in the hybrid work era of limited demand for commercial real estate.\n",

The debt is a Freddie Mac-backed loan for the two-building, 360-unit complex at 300-310 Prospect Avenue.\nA CBRE team including Judah Hammer, Jason Gaccione and Shawn Rosenthal arranged the financing.\nIn a statement, Khosla CEO Raman Khosla said the financing \u201cpositions us to continue investing in the property and enhancing the resident experience, while ensuring long-term financial stability for the asset.\u201d\nProspect Place is split between two buildings.

        "content": "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement closed on a warehouse in San Antonio and is reportedly exploring the purchase of another warehouse in North Texas, signaling a potential expansion of federal detention capacity even as local officials and lawmakers push back and key details remain under wraps.\nICE confirmed the purchase Thursday morning in a statement to the San Antonio Business Journal, saying it had acquired a warehouse intended for use as a detention facility, the publication\nreported\n. The agency declined to identify the property or provide transaction details, only stating that the buildings would meet federal detention standards.\n\u201cThese will not be warehouses \u2014 they will be very well-structured detention facilities meeting our regular detention standards,\u201d ICE spokesperson Nina Pruneda said in an emailed statement. She pointed to new funding from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law last summer, that allows the Department of Homeland Security to\nexpand its detention presence\nnationwide.\nThe confirmation comes as real estate and political scrutiny intensifies around\nOakmont 410\n, a nearly 640,000-square-foot industrial building on San Antonio\u2019s East Side that sources claim is the likely target. Multiple real estate industry sources told the outlet that ICE was eyeing the vacant property at 542 Southeast Loop 410, a warehouse built in 2022 and marketed for lease ever since.\nThe building is owned by Oakmont Industrial Group and represented by Partners Real Estate brokers John Colglazier, John Simons and Kyle Kennan. Neither Oakmont nor Partners has commented, and as of press time no sale had been recorded in Bexar County property records.\nOpposition to the rumored deal has been swift. Bexar County Commissioner Tommy Calvert, whose district includes the site, blasted the potential use as \u201cthe most disreputable commercial activity since WWII,\u201d an apparent reference to the use of internment camps established\u00a0 to detain Japanese-Americans on the federal government\u2019s claim of \u201cmilitary necessity\u201d in the 1940s. Democratic Congressmen Greg Casar and Joaquin Castro echoed that sentiment in a joint statement earlier this week, vowing to fight any expansion of ICE\u2019s presence in San Antonio.\nThe San Antonio purchase also fueled anxiety farther north, where questions persist about a\nmassive warehouse\nnear Interstate 45 in Hutchins, a small city south of Dallas. Residents there have speculated the property could become a large detention center, though city officials said they have received no confirmation from\nfederal authorities\n.\nD Magazine first reported that the proposed ICE detention center is most likely a 1-million-square-foot warehouse at 950 North I-45 next to the Hutchins State Jail, with a capacity for up to 9,500 people. The property, valued at $80.1 million and listed by Majestic Realty, is believed by local clergy members to have been purchased by ICE, though the agency has not confirmed the transaction.\nHutchins City Council convened a special meeting Wednesday night, entering executive session with legal counsel to discuss the property. The closed-door discussion ended without a vote or formal action. City leaders later said they were still unaware of any deed transfer or official plans tied to the site.\nThe property is a top taxpayer, and raised concerns about the city\u2019s ability to service debt and the lack of water/sewer capacity to support a population increase, as federal ownership would effectively end the property taxes on the building.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "BDT &amp; MSD Partners\u2019 proposal for an eight-story condominium and a three-story fitness center on the grounds of The Boca Raton won endorsement from Boca Raton\u2019s Planning and Zoning Board this week.\nThe development will replace the luxury resort\u2019s golf maintenance facility with a 76-unit multifamily highrise and a 31,700-square-foot fitness center on the 140-acre property.\nThe board unanimously recommended approval of zoning changes and master plan amendments, and the Boca Raton City Council will have final say on the proposed zoning changes.\nFormerly known as the Boca Raton Resort &amp; Club, and referred to by locals at The Boca Resort, The Boca Raton at 501 East Camino Real is a 100-year-old resort and private club with more than 1,000 hotel rooms, two golf courses, a beach club, a 32-slip marina, 200,000 square feet of meeting space, tennis and pickleball courts and more than a dozen restaurants and bars.\nIts owner, New York-based merchant bank\nBDT &amp; MSD Partners\n, has invested at least $75 million renovating and improving the resort. It is an active financier in South Florida, but this is its first major development in the region.\nThe proposed residential building is slated to be 100-feet tall and span 505,800 square feet. Units will average 2,500 square feet, said Jim Tilson, CEO of New York-based architecture and planning firm Hart Howerton Partners. Five-bedroom units will span 5,000 square feet, and penthouses will include outdoor spaces, Tilson said.\nConstruction will take up to three years once permits are obtained, said Bonnie Miskal, an attorney for The Boca Raton.\nThe 52-foot-tall fitness center will be three times the size of the existing one, Miskal said.\nThe city approved plans in December for a new 19,300-square-foot maintenance facility with three levels of parking built above it.\nMSD Partners, an investment firm that was started by Dell Computers founder Michael Dell, paid\n$875 million\nfor the Boca Raton Resort &amp; Club in 2019. Two years later, MSD Partners renamed it The Boca Raton. It came under the ownership of BDT &amp; MSD in 2023 when MSD merged with BDT &amp; Company.\nBoca Raton has attracted attention from developers in recent years as more affluent households move into the surrounding area.\nJust a mile away from The Boca Raton, Key International and Wexford Real Estate Investors are planning to build\nMr. C Residences Boca Raton\n, a proposed 12-story condo tower at 41 Southeast 4\nth\nStreet where sales for the project\u2019s 133 residences start at $1.7 million. And David Martin\u2019s Terra and Palm Beach-based Frisbie Group plan to include 182 condo units as part of its 1.1-million-square-foot One Boca project\nif it gets approved in a referendum in March\n.",

        "content": "Eric Ruderman and Stacey Empson helped a long-empty lakefront parcel in Evanston\u2019s Lakeshore Historic District find its footing after a decade sitting empty through a previous failed plan.\nThe longtime residents of the suburb just north of Chicago paid $2.35 million for the site in 2020 and embarked on a $7.5 million effort to build a custom home nearby Northwestern University\u2019s main campus.\nThe lot on Lake Michigan\u2019s shoreline sat vacant for more than a decade in the\nChicago suburb\nprior to their purchase, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. Three years after they bought the land, the couple moved into a 9,500-square-foot, five-bedroom house with lake views, an indoor swimming pool and space for an impressive art collection at 917 Edgemere Court.\nThe project required careful architectural maneuvering to fit a large building onto a narrow lot \u2014 roughly 50 feet wide and 330 feet deep \u2014 along with specialized construction to manage a high water table and\nshoreline erosion\n.\nThe earliest hurdle, however, was local politics. Previous owners tried and failed to develop the roughly half-acre site after proposing a modern design that ran afoul of neighbors and\nEvanston\u2019s\npreservation commission. The newspaper reported that rather than repeat that mistake, Ruderman and Empson started by calling nearby homeowners before closing on the property to understand what had sunk earlier plans.\nNeighbors made clear they wanted a home that blended with the surrounding 1920s-era houses and respected informal setback norms along the lake and street. With that guidance, the couple moved forward and hired Morgante Wilson Architects, a Chicago-area firm already familiar with the site\u2019s constraints.\nThe resulting design struck a compromise: a traditional front fa\u00e7ade with gables and a dormer to satisfy historic sensibilities, paired with a more contemporary, light-filled rear facing the lake. The plan sailed through the preservation commission.\nConstruction brought its own complexities, though. High lake levels had battered the backyard, prompting the team to design curving seawall-like features to deflect waves and protect the property. An indoor pool \u2014 a priority for the owners \u2014 required effectively building a sealed structure within the high water table.\nThe finished home also highlights a growing trend among affluent homeowners of designing for aging in place, according to the outlet. The\nhouse\nincludes an elevator, gym, spa and sauna, features that, along with the pool, proved especially meaningful after Empson was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease a year after moving in.\nShe told the Journal she feels \u201cso much peace and calm\u201d with the assumption she\u2019ll be able to remain in the home through her golden years.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The new listings come after the sale last fall of Our Lady of Mount Carmel church in Cloverdale for $50,000 and the St. Francis church in Hopland for $275,000.\nThe Sebastopol property is nearly 2.5 acres north of Valentine Avenue and south of Saint Sebastian Church. Last fall, the diocese submitted an application to the city to split the 6.4-acre lot into a church parcel and a vacant parcel to sell. Potential buyers have already submitted offers on the property, though sales via\nbankruptcy\ncourt can take several months as purchase agreements must be approved by a judge and are open to being outbid by other parties.\nIn Yountville, the diocese is looking to offload a 12.4-acre vineyard behind Saint Joan of Arc church. That listing also includes a roughly 0.7-acre easement to access the vineyard from Highway 29. Zoning for that site allows for between 10 and 20 housing units per acre.\nTo the west in Santa Rosa, a sale is currently pending for the former residence for bishops and priests next to the historic Saint Rose of Lima Church. The 5,300-square-foot home at 547 B Street was listed for $475,000 and has been vacant for roughly a decade. A potential buyer has already deposited earnest money, or a percentage of the purchase price placed into an escrow account, with the diocese to secure the property in court.\nThe Rio Dell property consists of 8.2 acres of undeveloped land at 800 Rigby Avenue. The acreage is listed for $749,000. The city of Rio Dell is willing to work with a developer to create a\nresidential development\nthere, according to the Press Democrat. And in Napa, the diocese is offering a 750-square-foot one-bedroom, one-bathroom home at 918 Napa Street for $569,000. A sale is pending court review, per the Press Democrat.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

An affiliate of Stephen Deckoff\u2019s Black Diamond Capital Management won the property on Wednesday with a $175 million credit bid, meaning no new funds were expended.\nThe Black Diamond affiliate had purchased the debt on the property on Oct. 6.\nThe auction is a new low point in the decline of the regional mall, once valued at $881 million. Its most recent appraisal gave it a 78 percent haircut, pulling the value down to $191 million.\nThe October sale of the debt to Black Diamond also resolved the mall\u2019s loan, which had been securitized and sold to investors.\nThe original investment took a $231.4 million loss. Class B, C and D bondholders were\nentirely wiped out.\nClass A lost about 32 percent of its value, to the tune of $72 million.\nPyramid Management Group developed the mall in the late 1990s. In 2016, it took out a $418.5 million refinancing loan against the property.\nBut performance began to falter shortly after. JCPenney left its space in 2017, followed by Lord &amp; Taylor in 2019. Those anchor spaces have not been re-occupied.\nThe pandemic added new pains. Revenue dipped nearly $20 million \u2014 from $80.4 million in 2016 to $61.8 million in 2022, according to Morningstar Credit. That same year, occupancy fell to 78 percent and the loan was transferred to special servicing for maturity and monetary default. By 2023, expenses were 60 percent of revenue.\nCurrent tenants in the four-story, 1.9 million-square-foot property include Home Depot, Target, BJ\u2019s Wholesale, AMC and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, according to Morningstar. The most recent data, from 2024, shows revenue has fallen even further, to $55.2 million.\nPyramid Management Group has lost two other malls to foreclosure recently: the Aviation Mall in Queensbury, New York, and the Hampshire Mall in \u200b\u200bHadley, Massachusetts, according to reporting from Syracuse.com.\nNeither attorneys for Black Diamond nor for the borrower immediately responded to a request for comment.",

        "content": "When Jennie Enterprise\nfounded Core Club\nin 2005, a soon-to-be important person put up financing: Jeffrey Epstein.\nWith his initial investment, Epstein secured himself a lifetime membership to the exclusive members-only club. And more than a decade later, as Core Club grew to a\nhub for real estate\u2019s elite\n, Epstein stayed involved in high-level business operations, introducing Enterprise to potential partners and offering advice on possible business structures. Enterprise also maintained a warm personal relationship with the disgraced financier and sex offender, who was accused of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls.\nEpstein\u2019s fellow founding members included Aby Rosen of RFR, Steven Roth of Vornado Realty Trust and Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone Group. The club also made headlines for a high-profile lawsuit with developer Michael Shvo, as well as disagreements with Rosen and RFR.\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported that Epstein took credit for the club\u2019s success, writing,\n\u201cI helped put them in biz,\u201d\nin 2018. A spokesperson for Core denied at the time that Epstein had any business development role at the club.\nBut the latest tranche of files released by the Department of Justice shows that when Core Club\u2019s finances were ailing in 2015, Epstein stepped in as a confidante and connector.\n\u201c[Just] keeping you in the loop,\u201d Enterprise wrote to Epstein in 2016, in the midst of business negotiations. Attached in the email appear to be sheets of corporate tax returns and income statements for the club.\n\u201cUpdating my guardian angel \u2026.love you !\u201d she wrote that same year.\nIn response to the latest batch of emails, the spokesperson reiterated the claim that Epstein played no business development role in Core Club.\n\u201cWe stand by our initial statement that this individual had nothing to do with the founding of the company, or \u2018putting CORE: in business\u2019,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement.\nAn early business partner\nEpstein first became involved in Core Club at its inception in the early 2000s. He paid $100,000 as a founding member, alongside 150 other investors, according to a spokesperson for Core.\nEmails between Epstein\u2019s staff refer to his investment in an entity called Core Club 55th Street LLC, most likely referring to the club\u2019s first location at RFR\u2019s 66 East 55th Street.\nIn 2014, Enterprise began a campaign to ask founding members to cancel their promissory notes to help the club pursue debt restructuring, according to paperwork in Epstein\u2019s files.\n\u201cBased upon the Club\u2019s own financial analysis, the Club has determined that in order to reach viability, among other things, it needs at least 90% of our Founding Members to execute and return the Settlement Agreement and affirm the cancellation of their promissory notes,\u201d Enterprise wrote to founding members.\nEpstein appears to have gone through with the cancellation, paying a discounted annual rate of $7,600 for his Core Club membership.\nThe spokesperson for Core said that Epstein rarely used the Club\u2019s member facilities and mostly received skin treatments, which are available to nonmembers.\nThere are scores of emails detailing Epstein\u2019s facial appointments with Dangene Enterprise, Jennie\u2019s wife.\nDangene and her staff sent Epstein a birthday email in 2019, months after a\nMiami Herald investigation\nraised widespread awareness of Epstein\u2019s role as a serial abuser of children.\nThey wrote in large purple font, \u201cWE LOVE YOU VERY MUCH.\u201d\nAn almost-workout plan\nBy 2015, Epstein had introduced Core Club to a personal associate: inventor and investor Nathan Myhrvold.\nEmails detail that Myhrvold visited Epstein\u2019s island in 2011 and sent him books and pistachio ice cream in 2013. \u201cPussy doesn\u2019t FedEx well,\u201d he wrote the financier, who pled guilty to procuring a minor for prostitution five years earlier.\nA spokesperson for Myhrvold said he knew the financier from TED conferences and as a donor to basic scientific research. \u201cHe regrets that he ever met him,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nEpstein first referred Myhrvold as a member of the club, according to a club spokesperson. Enterprise then pursued a business deal with him.\nIt was a difficult time for Core Club, which owed its landlord roughly $6.8 million in unpaid rent and was pursuing a debt restructuring plan, according to correspondence from Enterprise.\nEmails detail that Enterprise kept Epstein up to date about her talks with Myhrvold, sometimes asking for advice or wanting to hop on the phone to get info and prepare for meetings. He appeared to provide ideas as to how they could structure the deal.\nAt one point, Enterprise sent him a draft term sheet for Myhrvold\u2019s investment. Epstein OK\u2019d the file, saying she should send it before the would-be investor got cold feet.\n\u201cDo not copy me just send to him,\u201d Epstein wrote to Enterprise, \u201cwith a note that you are very excited to have him as a partner.\u201d\nAt least once during the negotiations, Epstein met privately with Myhrvold.\nEnterprise, who was being assisted by Rick Ross, chair of hotels and leisure at global law firm Dentons, was trying to get out of a business arrangement with Aby Rosen, whom Epstein separately claimed to have known for 20 years.\nEnterprise, Myhrvold and their teams worked out a potential plan: they would start a new company together, with Myhrvold making a $6 million convertible loan. They would move Core Club\u2019s intellectual property into the new company and license it back to the old LLC. The new company would buy existing debt from AES Holdings and then forgive it. Enterprise would be paid $100,000 for past services and then use that same money to pay off Rosen and RFR.\nThe parties explained via email that they had designed the deal to shield Myhrvold and the new company from taking on Core Club\u2019s tax risk.\nThe goal specifically appears to be to allow Myhrvold\u2019s investment to avoid taking on cancellation of indebtedness income but still use existing net operating losses to shield income from taxes, said Michael Meisler, a lecturer in taxation at Baruch College and former partner at Ernst &amp; Young, who reviewed a selection of emails but was otherwise unfamiliar with the deal or the parties.\nCancellation of indebtedness income occurs when one\u2019s debt is cancelled, and that canceled debt can then be taxed as income by the IRS.\nNet operating losses can be carried forward in time to decrease taxable income. The deal was designed to protect that ability to shield the new income from Myhrvold\u2019s investment.\n\u201cWhen you have a highly structured transaction that goes out of its way to say, \u2018We are doing this just to achieve this desired tax result,\u2019 that\u2019s usually a red flag for something that probably has a lot of risk to it,\u201d Meisler said.\nSpokespersons for Core Club and for Myhrvold said no deal between the parties ever materialized.\n\u201cCORE: has consistently been presented with business opportunities throughout our twenty-year history,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThis individual [Epstein] referred a member who then presented a business opportunity a decade after the founding of the company.\u201d\nNeither Dentons, Ross nor representatives for Rosen responded to a request for comment.\n",

The vote also enables some permanent projects to be exempted from zoning regulations if the council individually signs off on them. The types of structures that could be built under the new ordinance remain unclear.\nThe 2028 Games were advertised as a \u201cno-build\u201d Olympics that utilized facilities across Greater Los Angeles for events, though that no longer appears to be the case.\n\u201cMany elements and activities of the 2028 Games will require building and developments, including but not limited to the buildout or improvements to temporary and permanent venues, training facilities, security perimeters, broadcast and media centers, transit infrastructure, live sites and fan zones, and associated structures,\u201d Council member Traci Park said in a motion supporting the legislation.\nPart of the ordinance includes an amendment from Council member\nNithya Raman\nrequiring the Los Angeles\nDepartment of City Planning\nto create clear criteria that temporary projects would need to meet to be made permanent following the events. The amended ordinance also calls for the creation of quarterly reports of applications for temporary projects so that council members can review them and track any new developments in their districts. These projects would receive approval in 14 days.\n\u201cIt puts the onus on us to get ourselves organized and really make it easy for people to put up these structures and everything that\u2019s going to need to go into the Games,\u201d Council member Katy Yaroslavsky said.\nBesides being initially billed as a \u201cno-build\u201d Olympics, the 2028 Games were also touted as \u201cno-cost\u201d to taxpayers, though the city and governing organization LA28 are finalizing an agreement that outlines just how much the Olympics will actually cost the public. Discussions are ongoing despite an October 2025 deadline.\n\u201cLos Angeles faces multiple fiscal hazards that many current leaders negotiating this and other Olympics agreements, will not be around to face,\u201d civil rights attorney Connie Rice told\nMayor Karen Bass\nand other city leaders last fall, per Bisnow. \u201cThe city cannot afford an additional $1.5 billion hit in 2028 because city officials inadequately protected taxpayers in 2025.\u201d The city is already projecting a budget shortfall of $1 billion not counting Olympic costs.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "Developers have spoken: building rental housing in New York just doesn\u2019t pencil out without tax abatement.\nNow, the city comptroller\u2019s office is proposing the rules to implement New York\u2019s most recent tax abatement program, 485x.\nThe program has gained attention for its requirement that projects of 100 or more units pay a minimum construction wage of $40 per hour. That minimum wage rises higher for even bigger projects. In response, developers have pulled back on large-scale projects.\nThe comptroller\u2019s proposal departs from the statute in a few ways. And industry groups are already voicing concerns.\nOne sticking point for both developers and construction industry reps is the timeline to get an exemption on the rules.\nThe comptroller proposes that developers who have a labor agreement need to notify the office five months before construction for an exemption. This goes beyond the statute, which specified three months of notice needed.\nAlvin Schein, a partner and attorney at Adler &amp; Stachenfeld, called the requirement \u201cexceedingly onerous.\u201d The requirement would mean project owners would need to either wait to award labor bids or make them contingent on controller approval, Schein said in a written public comment.\nFelice Farber, executive director of the Subcontractors Trade Association, said she believes it shouldn\u2019t be up to the comptroller\u2019s office to approve exemptions; they should be granted automatically.\nAnother industry pain point is in the proposal\u2019s definition of wages. The comptroller proposes limiting the wage definition to only hourly wages. That excludes payroll taxes and other legally required contributions. The Real Estate Board of New York took issue with this, saying the statute explicitly includes employee benefits and employer taxes.\nAdditionally, the comptroller\u2019s office attempts to define what the statute calls the \u201cgreatest prevailing wage.\u201d The office defines it as the highest rate for a classification in the Comptroller\u2019s schedules, without taking into account experience tiers. \u201cApplying the top highest rate regardless of a worker\u2019s experience will raise costs and diverges from prevailing wage norms that tie rates to experience or apprenticeship progression,\u201d REBNY said in a written comment.\nNow, this is just a proposal and will be tinkered with. But the cost of any slip-ups could be high for developers. The law says that the comptroller can end and take back 485x benefits after three violations in five years. Losing the benefit would be the difference between making money and not for many projects.\nBuilding Trades Employers\u2019 Association, which represents union construction employers, said it supported the comptroller\u2019s office\u2019s efforts to \u201cprovide meaningful oversight and hold developers accountable.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nThe Department of Justice has released a trove of documents related to its investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. We\u2019ve started going through those and have published some stories, including one on\nEpstein\u2019s connections with Core Club and Jennie Enterprise\n. But there are thousands of documents. Something catch your eye? Drop me a note at\nlilah.burke@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nThe Big Apple is in for a big freeze this weekend, with a low of -1 on Sunday. But this is 14 degrees warmer than the coldest Central Park has observed, which was -15 degrees in 1934.\nElsewhere:\n\u2014 Brooklyn Democrats are once again backing Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s re-election after pulling support.\nPolitico reports\nthat leadership initially yanked its endorsement for Hochul due to her pick of Adrienne Adams as her potential second-in-command. Sources told the outlet that Brooklyn party chair Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn has long harbored a personal vendetta against Adams. Bichotte Hermelyn has insisted there is no bad blood.\n\u2014 Mayor Zohran Mamdani inked an\nexecutive order\nFriday underlining New York\u2019s sanctuary city policies. He directed city agencies to audit their internal policies related to federal immigration enforcement, reiterating that city data cannot be shared except when required by law.\n\u2014 In the Tristate area, progressive candidate Analilia Mejia maintains a narrow lead over competitor Tom Malinowski in the Democratic primary for New Jersey\u2019s 11th district. Democrat Mikie Sherill vacated the seat when she was inaugurated as governor. The special election is April 16.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$13.4 million\nfor 50 West 66th Street, 11D. The new construction condo unit on the Upper West Side is 3,900 square feet.\nDouglas Elliman\nhas the listing through developer Extell Marketing Group.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$31.8 million\nfor 67 Greene Street. The Soho building is a mixed-use, four-family rental with an office component. It\u2019s over 10,000 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $19.5 million for 763 Greenwich Street. The West Village townhome is 5,500 square feet.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s\nChris Poore and Serena Boardman have the listing.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "Cayre Equities turned a tidy profit on a Midtown South office building, likely thanks to the neighborhood\u2019s rezoning.\nThe firm sold a 16-story property at 254 West 35th Street in the Garment District for $26.2 million, notching a roughly $10 million gain in less than two years. Cayre bought the 106,000-square-foot property in December 2024 for $16.2 million with plans to convert it to self-storage, then flipped it to Joel Wertzberger\u2019s Joyland for a 62 percent jump in value, property records show.\nThe deal comes six months after the City Council approved Midtown South\u2019s long-awaited rezoning, unlocking high-density residential development across large swaths of the neighborhood. Plans for a residential conversion were filed in January, according to PincusCo, which first reported the sale, brokered by Itanel Rahamani of Venture Capital Properties.\nJoyland nabbed a $27 million loan from Levon Capital to finance the purchase. The debt was arranged by Henry Bodek of Galaxy Capital.\nThe value surge was likely driven by the rezoning, which makes residential development feasible. The building was zoned as industrial but is now part of a mixed-use district that allows residential, commercial, community facility and light manufacturing uses.\nThe Midtown South rezoning created two new high-density residential districts that allow projects up to 15 and 18 times the size of their lots. The changes apply to four pockets of Midtown South long dominated by manufacturing zoning that either barred housing outright or capped density.\nJoyland apparently doesn\u2019t plan to build the project itself. At the same time as the purchase, the firm signed a 99-year ground lease with Brooklyn developer Mendel Fleischman valued at $6.8 million.\nCayre and Wertzberger did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nKeith Larsen contributed reporting.\n",

Tim Elmes with Compass had the listing, and Costanza Pitta with Florida Luxurious Properties brought the buyer.\nClark was the CEO of cybersecurity firm Symantec, now known as Gen Digital, from 2016 to 2019. He got his start in the tech industry founding the software company Dascom, which he sold to IBM in 1999 for an undisclosed price.

The site has already been proposed for a 650-unit, 35-story high-rise market-rate residential tower and a four-story, 240-room luxury hotel.\nThose previous plans, by Sandstone, are expected to be scuttled, instead making way for 100-percent affordable housing in a mixed-use development as part of the ongoing makeover of the Warner Center district, according to the Times. Initial planning is already underway as Wellpointe seeks to bring fully affordable residences, separate high-rises and unspecified mixed-use elements for public use. Additional details including design and construction timelines will be disclosed as the project moves through the entitlement process.\nWellpointe is looking to \u201cdeliver quality housing at scale with a focus on affordability,\u201d said George Kutnerian, CEO of Wellpointe, said, per the Times. The Warner Center purchase is part of the company\u2019s goal of providing \u201caccess to high-density, quality housing and social infrastructure that is complementary to the area\u2019s transformation.\u201d\nThe city\u2019s Warner Center 2035 Specific Plan calls for turning the area within downtown Woodland Hills into an all-purpose entertainment and residential district in the San Fernando Valley.

Toll Brothers has proposed demolishing offices at 6464 Canoga Avenue and replacing it with an eight-story building with 276 apartments and 8,600 square feet of ground-floor retail space.

CW was appointed as special servicer for the $48 million loan tied to the lower eight floors of the 11-story building.\nThe $48 million loan backed by the portion of 1155 Market\nmoved to special servicing\nahead of \u201cimminent default\u201d in March 2024, per Morningstar data cited by the Business Times. In late 2023, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors failed to pass a resolution extending the city\u2019s lease at 1155 Market, citing cheaper rents available elsewhere in the Mid-Market area. The Mayor\u2019s Office of Disability, the Department of the Environment and the Office of the Treasurer &amp; Tax Collector had offices there prior to the city\u2019s decision not to renew; those agencies have since moved to separate offices across the city. Lenders received a notice of default for the debt in June 2024 and\nsued to foreclose that same month\n.\nThe foreclosure at the building could enable CW to find a new investor or owner for the eight-story portion, though the split nature of ownership at the building could drive away some prospective buyers, according to the Business Times.\nSan Francisco-based nonprofit LightHouse for the Blind acquired a 90 percent stake in the lower eight floors of 1155 Market from investor Patson Companies, which retained the remaining 10 percent stake, in late 2015. That deal also included LightHouse for the Blind\u2019s acquisition of the top three floors for its headquarters.\nThe top three floors of the building are not linked to the $48 million loan and are still under LightHouse\u2019s ownership. The portion of the building now under CW\u2019s control also includes a subterranean parking garage, the building\u2019s roof and the land underneath the building.\nThe lower eight floors of 1155 Market were valued at $80 million in 2015, according to the Business Times. Its value plummeted to $8.5 million after its most recent appraisal last October.\nThe outstanding debt on the eight-story portion at the time of the foreclosure auction was almost $65 million. Those floors were 100 percent vacant as of the end of last year, though the receiver has reportedly been negotiating leases that would bring occupancy up to roughly 30 percent.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The final sale price isn\u2019t available.\nThe seller was an area forester named Forrest Hodges, who owns a family-run logging company headquartered nearby. The buyer is an LLC, also based locally. The owner intends to make the land a family compound, according to listing agent Tyler Jacobs, a real estate partner at\nHall and Hall\n.\nThe land is in prime timber country, but it also doubles as a hunting destination, offering another potential income source. The seller imported native South Texas deer to improve the genetics of the local game, and most of the border is high-fenced, Jacobs said. A 5,200-square-foot lodge sleeps 23 people, and other improvements include dog kennels, additional guides\u2019 quarters by the lodge and shooting ranges for rifle, pistol and shotgun, according to the listing. The land spreads along 13 miles of the Neches River.\nExcept for some of the acreage around the lodge, the land is under a perpetual conservation easement intended to preserve open space and native wildlife. The easement forbids owners from subdividing the land, a\nrestriction that repels most buyers with a commercial interest\nbut attracts those who\nprize conservation\n.\nConservation easements are more common in western states like New Mexico, but in Texas, \u201cto my knowledge, that\u2019s the largest sale of a conserved property in a very, very long time,\u201d Jacobs said.\nAnother recently marketed family ranch, the 8,500-acre\nNineteen Mile Ranch\nnorthwest of San Antonio, is under a conservation easement, but it was taken off the market in 2024. Last year, an environmental organization obtained a conservation easement for the 6,600-acre\nT.M. O\u2019Connor Ranch in Goliad County\n, but the ranch remains under family ownership.\nIt\u2019s also unusual for family-owned timberland sales to attain this acreage in East Texas, according to Jacobs.\n\u201cIn East Texas, you generally have two timber operators: You have the family that\u2019s owned 100 acres forever, and then all the other companies are owned mostly by\ninstitutions\n, like pension funds,\u201d Jacobs said.Due to the abundance of water in East Texas, and its scarcity in West Texas, settlers and farmers also\nhistorically\nrequired larger tracts in the west.\n",

        "content": "When you think of rent-stabilized bankruptcies, you probably think of overleveraged buildings in Upper Manhattan and the South Bronx \u2014 not conservatively financed ones in white-ethnic Brooklyn neighborhoods.\nThink again.\nConsider the bankruptcy that Samuel Hertz filed in late January for 420 Avenue F and 320 Ocean Parkway in Kensington and 2302 85th Street in Bensonhurst, which have 145 apartments in all. Their tenants have names like Melnikova, Akramov, Durglishvili and Ananin.\nHertz\nbought\nthe three buildings in January 2018 for $46 million with a $25 million loan from ConnectOne Bank. That\u2019s a loan-to-value ratio of only 54 percent. It must have seemed like a safe bet at the time and was also a 1031 exchange, allowing Hertz to defer capital gains on a\nvery profitable 2017 sale\n.\nBut 2018 was a terrible, awful, no-good year to buy a rent-stabilized building. It\u2019s hard to imagine that any deals that year didn\u2019t end up in some kind of trouble. And $317,000 per unit was a lot for Hertz to pay.\nThe big blow was the rent-strangling Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, followed by the pandemic, \u201ccancel rent\u201d movement, eviction moratoriums and\nhousing court dysfunction\n. Then operating expenses surged but the Rent Guidelines Board\nremained stingy\nwith rent increases.\nThe 2019 law and pandemic fallout \u201chave dramatically eroded the value of the properties and hindered rent collections,\u201d Hertz wrote in his court filing.\nHertz, based at 1080 Ocean Avenue, seems to have tried to do the right thing. The investor actually paid down his mortgages by $1.83 million and sunk in another $1.95 million to subsidize operations, in part by taking out more loans.\nBut in retrospect, it looks like he threw good money after bad. Every month, all three buildings lose money.\nTake 420 Avenue F. The monthly rent collection is $96,000, or about $1,900 per unit (three units are not producing rent).\nMonthly costs include $49,000 for mortgage interest, $20,000 for property taxes, $7,000 for management fees, $6,000 for insurance and $6,000 for water and sewer.\nAdd in other expenses and the total comes to $106,000, which means the building loses $10,000 every month.\nBut it\u2019s probably worse, because Hertz\u2019s filing says repairs and maintenance cost just $32 per unit. A realistic number is several times that amount. Also, his actual rent collection is probably\nlower\nthan the 96 percent shown in his filing.\nThe mortgage calls for him to pay down nearly $13,000 in principal each month. That brings the monthly loss to more than $22,000.\nThe 85th Street building loses $18,000 a month, and 320 Ocean Parkway, the most valuable in the portfolio, loses $22,000. Half of those losses are going to pay mortgage principal, as lenders now commonly require for rent-stabilized buildings.\nBut even if the loans were interest-only, Hertz would be swimming in red ink.\nPaying mortgage principal is fine when your property value is going up, but not when it\u2019s going down. It\u2019s kind of like making car loan payments when you owe more than the vehicle is worth.\nHertz sought bankruptcy protection after ConnectOne Bank filed a foreclosure action in November.\nHe said in the filing that he is \u201ccontinuing to struggle with rent collections, evictions, and the increased cost of maintenance and operations.\u201d But he noted the buildings would be financially viable if the mortgage debt were reduced.\nThat\u2019s one option for ConnectOne Bank. Another would be to sell the loans for dimes on the dollar. A third would be to foreclose and sell the properties at auction.\nAs the saying goes, pick your poison.\n",

        "content": "Sales at Michael Shvo\u2019s Mandarin Oriental Residences on Fifth Avenue are being reset once again with a new brokerage team stepping in and prices being recalibrated after years of sluggish momentum.\nSerhant has\ntaken over\nmarketing at the 65-unit luxury condominium project, assigning Peter Zaitzeff and Glenn Davis to lead the effort. The move marks the latest attempt to unlock sales at the building, which launched in 2021 but has moved only about a third of its inventory in the four-plus years since.\nAlongside the brokerage switch comes a notable pricing overhaul. Listings reflect double-digit reductions from original asking prices laid out in the offering plan. A two-bedroom unit is now priced at $5.3 million, while a one-bedroom spanning more than 1,000 square feet is listed for $4.25 million, down from nearly $6 million. The pricing adjustment is intended to realign the project with buyer expectations after earlier pricing failed to generate sustained demand.\nThe reboot follows earlier signs of distress around the unsold inventory. In the fall, Shvo and his investment partners, which include Deutsche Finance America and German pension fund Bayerische Versorgungskammer, engaged Eastdil Secured to explore a bulk disposition of remaining units. While that option has not been ruled out, the latest strategy centers on individual condo sales rather than an institutional exit.\nFinancial pressure has also shaped the project\u2019s trajectory. In September 2024, the ownership group secured a $120 million inventory loan from Northwind Group tied to the unsold condos. At that point, just 15 units had closed, far short of the $340 million sellout projected when the development was marketed. Roughly 45 units remain on the market.\nThe property occupies the former Gucci headquarters at 685 Fifth Avenue, which Shvo and his partners purchased in 2018 for $135 million. The redevelopment converted office space into residential use and added floors atop the building.

        "content": "Marc Reinisch is getting a reality check on the value of his long-held\nGold Coast\nretail property.\nAn affiliate of his firm Rushmore Properties is staring down a foreclosure lawsuit over the retail portion of 100 East Walton Street, a two-building commercial block reaching 44 stories into the sky, where the lower floors of shopping has been a fixture of the firm\u2019s portfolio for 30-plus years, according to Cook County court and property records.\nThe legal move comes as the retail property\u2019s value has cratered by more than 40 percent from its peak a decade ago, according to loan data.\nReinisch didn\u2019t return a request for comment and neither did an attorney for LNR handling the foreclosure litigation.\nWhen Reinisch secured\u00a0 the $9.3 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan for the 46,700-square-foot property back in 2015, it was appraised at $20.3 million. Fast forward to October 2025, and an updated appraisal pegged its worth at just $11.8 million.\nThe property is just barely treading water. If the appraisal is to be believed, practically the entire principal of the loan remains unpaid along plus $500,000 in additional interest, including default interest, and further penalties accruing daily for the borrower.\nThe valuation drop highlights a widening rift in the Gold Coast: while luxury tenants are flocking to Oak and\nRush streets\nin lieu of the\nMagnificent Mile\n\u2014 where vacancy remains elevated above 25 percent \u2014 older, mixed-use retail blocks like 100 East Walton are struggling to keep pace.\nThe loan\u2019s special servicer LNR Partners is pursuing foreclosure while simultaneously negotiating a potential workout with Reinisch. The situation turned critical following the loan\u2019s maturity in August 2025 that came and went without repayment from the longtime landlord, who\u2019s been involved in acquiring $250 million of real estate for Rushmore.\nThe property\u2019s vitals have been unsteady. Occupancy fell to 67 percent at the end of 2024, down from 86 percent when the loan was first underwritten, public loan data shows. As a result, the debt service coverage ratio plummeted to 0.54, meaning the property is only generating about half the income needed to cover its debt payments. Operating cost expenses are eating up 80 percent of the total revenue, which sat at over $1.4 million for 2024, the loan data shows.\nReinisch has been searching for an exit ramp for some time. A broker with Mid-America Real Estate Corporation was sharing the property\u2019s listing with potential buyers over the summer last year while seeking about $12.5 million. Offers came in at eight figures but shy of the asking, according to people familiar with the market. It\u2019s unclear why they weren\u2019t accepted before the borrower ran out the lender\u2019s shot clock.\nFor Reinisch, who has led Rushmore through the acquisition of over 5 million square feet of real estate, the Walton Street woes are a rare public stumble. It serves as a stark reminder that even in Chicago\u2019s most prestigious submarkets, property values can fall suddenly and without regard for what might seem like a cautious, low-leverage owner\u2019s pricing expectations.\n",

        "content": "If you missed the Los Angeles\nState of the City\n, don\u2019t worry.\nThat\u2019s because a firm grip on where the mayor stands on proposed reforms for Measure United to House L.A. \u2014 one of real estate\u2019s biggest headaches \u2014 wasn\u2019t part of the keynote.\nThe silence was deafening considering the shouting match that ensued in the week prior to Feb. 2\u2019s address, held at the Expo Center.\nThat was the week when prominent Progressive councilmember Nithya Raman sought her colleagues\u2019 approval to create a\n15-year exemption\nfrom ULA for new construction multifamily, mixed-use and commercial projects, along with a one-time carveout for properties impacted by a natural disaster. Some council members, along with the\nMeasure ULA Citizens Oversight Committee\n, were miffed at the attempted fast-track to get the proposal on June\u2019s ballot. It\u2019s now sitting with the city\u2019s Housing and Homelessness Committee.\nIn short, whether there\u2019s relief for residential and commercial real estate from the 4 percent tax on properties selling for $5.3 million or more (or 5.5 percent for those priced at $10.6 million and up), remains a question mark.\nOn Downtown\nTwo different realities \u2014 both extremes \u2014 are playing out for Downtown Los Angeles, depending on who you ask.\nBass is on a roll touting proof points Downtown is being revitalized.\n\u201cBusinesses are relocating, expanding their headquarters here,\u201d she said during her State of the City address. \u201cLast year, the city council, the labor movement, business and community leaders came together to pass much needed legislation to expand the L.A. Convention Center. As a result, marquee conventions are booking as we speak.\u201d\nThat includes the American Speech-Language Hearing Association (15,000 people in 2031), American Geophysical Union (25,000 people in 2032) and International Association of Chiefs of Police Annual Conference and Exposition (15,000 people in 2037).\nOn the flipside, there\u2019s billionaire developer Rick Caruso, who told KNX News this week that Downtown has been \u201cdecimated\u201d by crime and homelessness. He slammed Downtown for its \u201cgraffiti towers\u201d in the unfinished Oceanwide Plaza and cited a 40 percent vacancy rate among offices (a CBRE fourth-quarter report pegged it at about 25 percent).\nWill he or won\u2019t he?\nBy the time you read this, the deadline for\nL.A. mayoral candidates\nto declare their intent to run will have passed on Saturday.\nBy then, a full and final view of who is going up against Bass on the June ticket will be known.\nFor less than a day it seemed like Caruso was\nback in the mix\nafter telling KNX he needs some time to \u201cprocess\u201d a damning report from the Los Angeles Times alleging Bass ordered the watering down of the after-action report analyzing the city and emergency services\u2019 responses to last January\u2019s Palisades Fire. The Times report, which Bass\u2019s office refuted, led to questions of whether Caruso might reconsider last month\u2019s announcement to not run for political office. He added that he\u2019d speak with family and \u201cwe\u2019ll see.\u201d The next day his political consultant, Mike Murphy,\nreportedly\nshut down any prospects of a reversal on January\u2019s decision to not run.\nAnd, that\u2019s that \u2014 for now anyhow.\nTrading spaces\nRecent months have seen a flurry of recruiting activity among residential brokerages.\nJustin Alexander\nand most of his team headed for the exit at Hilton Hilton to make a jump to The Agency. Interesting move that leaves Alexander\u2019s former firm with four agents, according to California Department of Real Estate records as of Friday. The brokerage helmed by Rick Hilton already saw a big departure last fall when Hilton\u2019s son, Barron Hilton and Barron\u2019s wife Tessa Hilton, decamped to Compass. That the couple, who were the Beverly Hills brokerage\u2019s co-CEOs and co-founders, made the decision to leave was a curious one.\nAlexander wasn\u2019t the only one looking for a change of scenery.\nElsewhere, Jon Grauman and Adam Rosenfeld\u2019s\nResident Group\nbrought on Kevin Stewart as a partner. They plucked him from their former firm, The Agency.\nMeanwhile, Coldwell Banker Realty Foothills office manager Lori Ramirez was also heads down on recruiting. Over the past year, she\u2019s brought on 29 agents across the Pasadena, La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge and San Marino offices, with nearly half of those new recruits joining the brokerage in the past three months.\n",

        "content": "Los Angeles\u2019s mayoral race got a lot more interesting hours before the cutoff for candidates to file to run in the June primary.\nProminent progressive Councilmember\nNithya Raman\n\u2014 a member of the Democratic Socialists of America \u2014 is reportedly in the mix to run against incumbent Mayor Karen Bass. Raman\u2019s entry caps what has been a buzzy week for the June election, and offers real estate a candidate that\u2019s taken a clear stance on one of the industry\u2019s hottest topics in\nMeasure United to House L.A.\nInquiries to Raman\u2019s press office were not immediately returned Saturday morning. Candidates have until noon Pacific Standard Time to file their declarations to the city clerk, which had not yet updated that filing roster as of early Saturday.\nWhile Raman told the\nLos Angeles Times\nshe holds a \u201cdeep respect\u201d for Bass, she said recent months have underscored a need for change within the city.\n\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ve really begun to feel like unless we have some big changes in how we do things in Los Angeles, that the things we count on are not going to function anymore,\u201d Raman told the Times.\nHer declaration to run adds to what\u2019s now a crowded field of mayoral hopefuls and a week that saw former Los Angeles School District Superintendent Austin Beutner drop out of the race,\nRick Caruso\nconsider for less than a day\nwalking back\nlast month\u2019s statements about not running, and tech entrepreneur Adam Miller enter the mix.\nMeanwhile, former \u201cThe Hills\u201d reality TV star\nSpencer Pratt\nofficially kicked off his campaign Feb. 4. There\u2019s also another DSA member,\nRae Chen Huang\n, who announced her candidacy in November.\nReal estate angle\nRaman\u2019s announcement comes just days after Bass delivered her State of the City in which she largely shied from one of real estate\u2019s biggest headaches in Measure ULA.\nRaman instead took aim at the so-called mansion tax late last month when she sought her councilmember peers\u2019 approval to push some of the most aggressive\ncarveouts\nfor the two-tier tax through to the June ballot. The council didn\u2019t bite during its Jan. 27 meeting, instead kicking the proposal to the\nHousing and Homelessness Committee\n.\nSupporters of the tax have criticized Raman\u2019s proposed changes, offering that they largely give in to real estate and broader business interests. The critics are generally on the left of L.A.\u2019s political spectrum, which has been the core of Raman\u2019s base.\nRaman\u2019s idea to amend the ballot measure that voters passed in 2022 includes a 15-year exemption from ULA for new construction multifamily, commercial and mixed-use projects. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a one-time carveout for properties impacted by a natural disaster, which would be retroactive to January of 2025 to account for Palisades Fire survivors.\nULA went into effect in 2023 and currently applies a 4 percent tax to any property sales \u2014 commercial or residential \u2014 starting at $5.3 million. That bumps up to 5.5 percent on any deals of $10.6 million or more.\nReal estate largely hailed the proposed changes after nearly three years of agents, brokers and developers lamenting stalled deals and a pall cast on the flow of financing for construction of housing and other commercial projects as a result of the tax.\nCityview CEO and Chief Investment Officer Sean Burton called the changes a \u201chuge move forward\u201d and said they resulted from months of conversations involving real estate, business leaders, non-profits and other interests looking to find ways of addressing what Raman called the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of the tax.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen construction fall off a cliff for any sort of market rate housing or affordable housing,\u201d Burton said of the tax\u2019s impact. \u201cL.A.\u2019s been redlined by the investment community because of ULA.\u201d\nSo far, ULA has raised over $1 billion since its rollout \u2014 a figure proponents often cite as a proof point of the tax\u2019s efficacy. Still, that\u2019s off from the original range of $600 million to $1.1 billion generated annually that voters were pitched when the tax went on the ballot.\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s a few hurdles away from being a real estate story, but\nTaylor Rehmet\n\u2019s decisive defeat of Trump-backed state senate candidate Leigh Wambsganss in deep red Tarrant County is making serious waves.\nThe fact that Rehmet had a chance to win the Jan. 31 runoff for state senator in a district Trump carried by 17 points in 2024 earned the race\na Jan. 29 profile\nin The New York Times. When Rehmet, an Air Force vet and Lockheed Martin aircraft mechanic and union leader, won by a 14-point margin, everyone was talking about Fort Worth, with Democrats around the country looking to the race as a possible bellwether and Republicans taking the contest as a warning.\nBefore anyone gets too riled up, it must be noted that the results are somewhat temporary. Rehmet and Wambsganss will face off again in November for a chance to represent the district for a full four-year term. Since the Texas legislature meets every other year, with its most recent session in 2025, a different outcome in November would mean Rehmet never casts a vote.\nThe whole saga puts Miriam Adelson in somewhat of an awkward position.\nThe billionaire boss of casino empire Las Vegas Sands has spent multiple years and millions of dollars lobbying to get casino gambling legalized in Texas so Sands can build a casino-anchored arena district for the Dallas Mavericks, which Adelson purchased in 2023.\nSo, when Wambsganss echoed the anti-casino sentiment of Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick,\nSands backed her Republican challenger\nJon Huffman \u2014 to the tune of $3.5 million in the original Nov. 2025 election to fill the seat Kelly Hancock vacated.\nMeanwhile, Rehmet has signaled he\u2019s open to expanding gambling if it brings \u201cgood union-paying jobs.\u201d Adelson supports Trump to the extent that she\u2019s pushing him to run for a third term in 2028, but she\u2019s not above donating to Democrats; she\u2019s donated handsomely to Democratic darling and U.S. Senate candidate James Talarico.\nHistoric homes in teardown-happy Texas\nIn a state where buyers prefer to start over when getting a new house,\nhistoric homes\nare rare and often overlooked. But, in today\u2019s softening luxury market, these old manses have proven to hold their value. For example, the state\u2019s most expensive listing is for a historic home.\nDallas\u2019 Crespi Estate\n, at 5619 Walnut Hill Lane, is asking $64 million. The house was built in 1938.\nTroubled CRE debt tops $800M\nFebruary marks the third month in a row that troubled CRE debt tied to Texas Triangle properties\ntopped $800 million\n. The round of foreclosure notices that went out last month included bad news for Dallas\u2019 beleaguered urban core.\nStarwood foreclosed on The National\n, Todd Interests\u2019 mammoth mixed-use conversion project and one of the largest urban restoration projects in the country. Shawn Todd\u2019s firm spent $460 million carving the project out of the long-vacant former First National Bank Tower.\nCamden\u2019s CA exit\nCamden Property Trust\u2019s love affair with Texas started when founder Richard Campo moved from Southern California to Houston in 1976. By listing its\n$1.5 billion California apartment portfolio\n, Camden has signaled that it might be planning to leave the state altogether. The trust quietly listed 11 properties and is marketing the assets through JLL, Bisnow reported. The portfolio spans roughly 3,600 units split between Los Angeles-Orange County and the San Diego-Inland Empire region, according to Piper Sandler.\nTexas\u2019 buyer friendliness\nThe pandemic-era housing boom is in the rearview mirror, but it\u2019s not clear whether we\u2019re reverting to pre-pandemic conditions or facing a significant downturn. In Texas, 75 percent of homes sold for\nbelow asking price\nin major cities, establishing it as a buyer-friendly state, with Austin leading at 82 percent and followed by Dallas (79.4 percent), Houston (78 percent) and Fort Worth (74 percent).\n",

        "content": "Laura Clark has led earnings calls before but Thursday\u2019s was her first as incoming chief executive of Rexford Industrial. The call began with a pre-recorded personal note from co-founders and co-CEOs Michael Frankel and Howard Schwimmer, who were not on the call. Clark thanked the founders, who she\u2019ll soon\nreplace\nin the Elliott era, but made it clear Rexford\u2019s next chapter has begun.\nEarnings were\nmixed\n. The real estate investment trust reported losses in the fourth quarter but was still profitable for all of 2025. It blamed losses on sell-offs of several properties along with co-CEO transition costs\u2013and we know Frankel and Schwimmer were granted stock awards valued at more than $20 million each. The big payouts made it all the more notable that Clark, on the call, mentioned Rexford was realigning executive compensation with shareholders\u2019 expectations.\nThe latest proxy shows that Frankel and Schwimmer raked in $13 million in total compensation in 2024, with base salaries of $1 million. Clark\u2019s base will be $850,000, per a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing, and her annual cash incentive opportunities are 25 percent below her predecessors.\nElliott\u2019s hand in the departures and changes going forward seem clear, including a strategic imperative that has Rexford disposing of real estate and buying back shares. One analyst said he understood Clark was new to the corner office but bluntly asked what if the new strategy isn\u2019t successful? Clark plowed through the question, giving shareholder returns top priority and expressing confidence that the new pattern of capital allocation would deliver long-term value.\nBenefactors\nThe race for California\u2019s next governor is on, but there is still no clear frontrunner.\nThere are two candidates we are keeping a close eye on because of their backers. The first is ex-Fox News host and Republican hopeful Steve Hilton, who\nreceived\na contribution from billionaire Los Angeles apartment developer Geoff Palmer. Palmer, a Trump donor, gave the maximum.\nThe second is San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan, who got an\nendorsement\nfrom another L.A. billionaire developer \u2014 Rick Caruso, who purportedly considered a run of his own. Mahan, a late entry, hasn\u2019t hit a filing period on campaign finances yet, but he could get more than verbal support from Caruso in the coming months.\nDelivered\nCityview helmed by Sean Burton completed its eight-story, 265-unit community located in Los Angeles\u2019 South Bay, at 12888 Crenshaw Boulevard, near SpaceX headquarters \u2014 a deal Burton\npreviously told\nthe publication he could not do in the City of Los Angeles because of the so-called mansion tax. Despite its moniker, Measure ULA hits commercial deals, too, with a 4 percent levy on trades of more than $5 million, and 5.5 percent on those priced at more than $10 million.\nAnd that wasn\u2019t the only completion announced this week \u2026\nFort Lauderdale-based BH3 Management launched sales at Priv\u00e9 Malibu, a gated-community of 68 condominiums in the Point Dume neighborhood (on 10 acres at 6487 Cavalleri Road), minutes from the beach. It happens to be the first for-sale luxe product to hit Malibu in two decades. Prices start at $2 million. But don\u2019t worry, most condos have ocean views.\nAnother selling point for the ultra-rich? Charlie Sheen might be your neighbor! The actor is a long-time resident, and is considering purchasing a Priv\u00e9 \u00a0Malibu pad, per a spokesperson for the developer.\nPrice tag\nLos Angeles\u2013based real estate investment company JRK recently\npurchased\na $400-million, three-property portfolio from Equity Residential. The deal includes 803 apartments spread over properties in Seattle, Hoboken, New Jersey and the City of Angels.\nHow much JRK paid for the 94-unit complex at 12301 West Pico Boulevard in West Los Angeles\u2019 Sawtelle neighborhood was unclear when announced but the price has since come clear: $38 million, according to property records signed by both Equity Residential\u2019s Caroline Hammond and JRK\u2019s Daniel Lippman. That comes out to around $400,000 per unit. The trade was in Measure ULA\u2019s reach, so the city tax amounted to more than $2 million.\n",

        "content": "Two Roads Development sued the holdout owners at Biscayne 21, adding another twist to the saga.\nThe developer has been\nlocked in litigation\nwith the holdout owners of the bayfront condo building in Miami\u2019s Edgewater since 2023. A year earlier, Two Roads paid about $150 million for the majority of units at the building, which was constructed in 1964. The developer then launched sales of an Edition-branded condo project.\nLast year, as part of the holdout owners\u2019 suit, the developer-controlled condo association was found to have illegally amended the condo declaration to lower the requirement for a condo termination to 80 percent of owners, from 100 percent. A condo termination is required to eventually redevelop the site.\nIn January of this year, Two Roads was ordered to restore the building to a habitable state, including repairs and restoring utilities such as air conditioning, water and electricity.\nBut now, Two Roads is on the offense.\nTwo Roads\u2019 affiliate, TRD Biscayne, is asking the court for equitable relief, which includes terminating the condo association. In its complaint filed at the end of January, Two Roads alleges that the unit owners are blaming the developer for issues that existed before Two Roads entered the picture. The tower \u201cstands vacant, uninhabitable, and condemned resulting from decades of lack of maintenance deferred by its former owners, including the individual unit owners,\u201d the lawsuit states.\nTaylor Collins, a managing partner at Two Roads, said the same in an interview last week. The cost to return the building to a habitable condition is about $61 million, according to the complaint.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not worth it to repair it,\u201d he said. If the court rules in favor of the developer, Collins said that the property could go to a court-ordered partition sale. That means Two Roads could buy out the rest of the owners or a new developer could purchase the property.\n\u201cI hope this comes to closure faster than that,\u201d he said.\nMore to come on Monday.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill we see more lawsuits\nsimilar to the one filed\nby the condo association at Aston Martin Residences against the developer, Germ\u00e1n Coto? The complaint alleges that Coto ran \u201can immense shell game\u201d to defraud the association before unit owners took over the board. Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential:\nAnthony Lomangino, a waste management magnate and Trump appointee, and his wife, Lynda Lomangino,\npaid $76.7 million\nfor the oceanfront mansion at 260 North Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach. Harvey Kinzelberg, the founder of Sequel Capital, and his wife Mary Ann sold the property.\nCommercial\n: An LLC tied to Roizman Development, Related Companies and Related Group sold the low-income apartment complex at 201 Racquet Club Road in Weston\nfor $50.5 million\n.

The newly built mansion is decked out with amenities, including a fitness studio, massage room, sauna, cold plunge, a lap pool, theater, office and guest house, according to the listing.

        "content": "In Los Gatos, the quaint town in the Santa Cruz Mountains widely viewed as the southern gateway to Silicon Valley, the crown for tallest building is shared between The Altan condominium and the El Gato Penthouse apartments, which each reportedly rising about 61 feet.\nNow, after a court ruling last week, Los Gatos will be forced to process a pair of applications that propose apartment buildings between 100 and 120 feet in height, not to mention the combined 292 new housing units intended to come with them. The court\u2019s decision sharpens the threat \u2014 and the potential \u2014 of California\u2019s builder\u2019s remedy law, and could have statewide implications.\nThe local developer behind the applications, Arya Properties LLC \u2014 run by Ali Moayed, a doctor charged with insurance fraud in 2019 and convicted of elder abuse in 2008 \u2014 submitted the projects through the state\u2019s builder\u2019s remedy provision. When a local jurisdiction fails to get state approval on its plan \u2014 known as a housing element \u2014 to make room for additional state-mandated housing supply, builder\u2019s remedy kicks-in. The provision,\nintended as a big stick against noncompliant cities and counties\n,\u00a0 essentially eliminates local zoning rules and standards, and allows developers to propose wildly incongruous and outsized housing projects. The local jurisdictions are often powerless to deny these projects.\nAlas, Los Gatos tried by deeming the project application incomplete. State law allows a 90-day window for developers to cure any issues. On the developer\u2019s second try, Los Gatos again determined the application incomplete. The city interpreted state law to only allow one 90-day window to address application issues, after which an applicant must start all over. The developer argued it had indefinite 90-day windows to resubmit and fix its applications.\nThe court, in an opinion published last week,\nsided with the developer.\nOf course, a 120-foot apartment building would hardly register on the Richter Scale in California\u2019s great metropolises. But think, here, of the scale. Through the state\u2019s builder\u2019s remedy law, Arya Properties LLC was able to submit for housing structures that are about twice as tall as any building standing in Los Gatos. And, now, according to the court, it\u2019s almost impossible to throw these applications out.\nNow, three years into California\u2019s latest cycle of requiring cities and counties to add more housing supply \u2014 and the first in which the state is applying real teeth to its mandates \u2014 the threat and promise of builder\u2019s remedy is becoming clearer. In Pacifica, the peninsula city 10 miles south of San Francisco, a developer is pushing forward on\na new, 86-acre, 1,225-home neighborhood through the builder\u2019s remedy provision\n. In Davis, the 25-acre infill neighborhood, dubbed Palomino Place, recently won approval after employing the state law.\nSan Francisco is watching these developments closely. Late last year, the city council approved\nMayor Daniel Lurie\u2019s Family Zoning Plan\n, which upzoned neighborhoods across the city for the first time in decades, aimed at making room for the 82,000 new units the state is requiring San Francisco to permit by 2031. However, groups on both sides of the housing debate \u2014 those who think the upzoning went too far, and those who believe it didn\u2019t go far enough \u2014 have sued the city on those grounds.\nIf a court rules the zoning plan void, it could put San Francisco out of compliance with state housing mandates and trigger builder\u2019s remedy.\nLurie has previously warned what builder\u2019s remedy in San Francisco could mean.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll put towers everywhere,\u201d Lurie said of developers.\nBill Fulton, publisher of the California Planning and Development Report, which tracks land use issues throughout the state, told The Real Deal that builder\u2019s remedy can often tempt developers\u2019 egos.\n\u201cSome developers fall into the trap of their egos with builder\u2019s remedy,\u201d Fulton said over the phone this week. \u201cThey think, \u2018I\u2019m going to build the greatest project ever.\u2019 I think there is a lot of ego, but a lot of developers want to play ball with their city. But others want to go nuclear.\u201d\nCalifornia has not seen many builder\u2019s remedy projects break ground, often due to macro economic factors like the cost of debt and construction materials. However, Fulton said the state is likely to only see builder\u2019s remedy projects crop up where the rents are high, because the law requires developers to pay prevailing wages in the construction of the projects.\nThe state has recently shown an interest in pushing builder\u2019s remedy projects as well. In 2025, AB 1893 went into effect, lowering the affordability thresholds for developers from 20 percent to 13 percent, while also limiting how far a project\u2019s proposed density could go beyond local zoning rules.\n",

Now, the high-volume Austin Realtor is making a foray into hotel development.\nVadakkan, who leads Trinity Texas Realty, is developing two limited-service hotels through his new company, Trinity Texas Hospitality, with projects underway in the Austin and Dallas areas totaling roughly $44 million, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe Austin hotel, priced at about $26 million, is expected to start construction in April near Samsung\u2019s massive semiconductor plant in Northeast Austin near East Palmer Lane and East Yager Lane. An $18 million hotel is already underway in McKinney, north of Dallas. That hotel will be a dual-branded La Quinta and Hawthorn Suites adjacent to McKinney ISD Stadium and offer about 100 rooms.\nThe pivot comes as\nresidential brokerage sales\nslowed after years of pandemic-era velocity. Vadakkan\u2019s team ranked second in the Austin Business Journal\u2019s 2025 list of\ntop Realtor teams\n, posting $121 million in sales in 2024, but he said deal flow has softened enough to push him toward more diversified income streams.\n\u201cI have to pay salaries,\u201d Vadakkan told the publication. \u201cOnly doing residential brokerage does not work for me.\u201d\nHe\u2019s hardly the first agent to look\nbeyond commissions\n, as across Texas and other Sun Belt markets, brokers with capital and deal experience have increasingly branched into development, private lending and property ownership to smooth out cyclical swings, the outlet reported. Vadakkan said\nhospitality offered scale\nand longer-term stability.\nFinancing and permitting proved to be the biggest hurdles, he told the outlet. Both hotel projects are backed by Louisiana National Bank, and Vadakkan credited his internal management team with helping navigate unfamiliar territory. The hotels add to a growing portfolio under the Trinity Group umbrella of companies, which already includes a property management arm and a broadcast channel \u2014 Flowers TV USA \u2014 which Vadakkan markets to Indian nationals living both in the United States and abroad.\nVadakkan said that he is already in early planning stages for another Austin-area hotel and eventually wants to move into low-income housing development.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The total marks the most weekly contract signings for homes asking eight figures since October 2024.\nA new condo at\n1122 Madison Avenue\nfrom Legion Investment Group and Nahla Capital contributed four contracts for homes in that price tier last week alone, and has already sold half of its 26 units at an asking price of almost $4,300 per foot since launching sales off of floor plans less than a month ago.\nIn total, there were 22 deals signed for condos, seven for co-ops and six for townhouses, along with one for a condop for a total contract volume of over $370 million. The\nweek prior\nsaw 33 contracts signed for almost $313 million.\nThe top contract last week went to two\n78th-floor units\nat 432 Park Avenue.\nThe units had been at the center of a lawsuit between the building\u2019s sponsor, CIM Group, and is developer, Harry Macklowe. A buyer agreed to pay $53 million for units 78A and 78B, which combine to span the entire 78th floor, two sources familiar with the deal\ntold The Real Deal\n. Macklowe lost the properties last year after defaulting on the loans he had taken out from CIM to purchase the condos.\nSpanning 8,300 square feet, the 78th floor is divided into two units that can be combined, or maintained separately.\nSerhant\u2019s Glenn Davis and Nicholas Compagnone had the listing.\nThe second priciest contract went to Unit 4N at 140 Jane Street, which was asking $27 million, up from its original price of $21 million.\nSpanning almost 4,600 square feet, the condo includes four bedrooms and four full bathrooms. The home also includes a stone-floored room with sliding glass doors that open onto a Juliet balcony.\nThe primary suite features two dressing rooms and a great room with nearly 10-foot ceilings has views of the Hudson River.\nA Corcoran Sunshine team, led by Tara King-Brown, is heading sales at the Aurora Capital Associates\u2019 project. There is now only one unit left at the 14-unit development. The project inked a contract for a penthouse\nasking $87.5 million last year\n, which would be the most expensive condo sold downtown if it closes for that price.\nHomes that went into contract last week had a median asking price of $7.4 million and an average discount of 5 percent.\n",

        "content": "Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty picked up three agents across Chicago and the wealthy suburban North Shore in recent weeks, adding to its headcount as the city\u2019s\ntop firms wrestle for talent\nin a consolidating market.\nSpencer Terry returned to the brokerage\u2019s Chicago City Hub office to co-found a new team, Echelon Partners, alongside Landon Heck, according to Jameson Sotheby\u2019s. Rory Mone is joining the City Hub from Berkshire Hathaway Home Services Chicago, while Amanda Zick is joining the team at the firm\u2019s upcoming Winnetka office, the company said.\nAmalgamation across the brokerage industry has driven competition for technology, access to listings and local support throughout the industry, and brokerages have been pushed to prove their value to agents.\nThe recruitment drive comes in the wake of Compass\u2019\nmegamerger with Anywhere Real Estate\n, which brought Anywhere\u2019s brands \u2014 including Sotheby\u2019s International Realty \u2014 under Compass\u2019 ownership.\nThe agents said that merger was not a factor in their decision to join Jameson Sotheby\u2019s, which is an independently owned franchise of Sotheby\u2019s and is expected to keep a distinct brand. Terry, who was previously with Jameson Sotheby\u2019s for two years before moving to Compass in March 2025, said he doesn\u2019t know if Jameson Sotheby\u2019s will be adopting Compass\u2019 technology, but that having access to the tools of his former brokerage would be a welcome addition.\nCompass CEO Robert Reffkin has said independent franchises will have access to Compass\u2019 technology platform if they want it.\n\u201cAny additional technology or tools that will benefit my clients and make my life easier, I\u2019m all for it,\u201d Terry said.\nTerry said he returned to Jameson because the brokerage\u2019s focus on luxury services across price points fits well with his and Heck\u2019s goals with Echelon Partners. The team has three additional agents, Terry said.\n\u201cLandon and I like that whole luxury service, fine dining approach to it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to build a team that was big on mentorship and not just on building a business for a team lead\u2019s brand.\u201d\nTerry closed $10 to $11 million in sales last year, he said, and Heck closed about $19 million. Combined, they have about $100 million in sales volume with a combined 17 years of experience, Jameson Sotheby\u2019s said in its press release.\nFor Zick, joining Jameson Sotheby\u2019s\nWinnetka office\nwas an opportunity to get in on the \u201cground floor\u201d of the company\u2019s push into the high-demand North Shore town. The firm opened a new Lake Forest office this month and is planning to open offices in Winnetka and Glenview this year. The firm\nhired Megan Mawicke\nto lead its Winnetka office last year.\nZick was previously at @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, where she was part of a team, and she was at Compass before that. A former teacher at the New Trier school system, Zick began selling real estate full-time last year, she said, when she closed about $4 million in transaction volume. At Jameson Sotheby\u2019s she will be a solo agent.\nThe brokerage\u2019s focus on personalized service, along with its international reach, appealed to her.\n\u201cI really like their marketing and how they provide a boutique experience for clients,\u201d Zick said. \u201cIt aligns well with how I like to do my business, giving a very personal, individually tailored experience for each client.\u201d\nSotheby\u2019s global network was also a big deal for Mone, who joined Jameson from Berkshire Hathaway Home Services Chicago last month. Originally from Ireland, Mone said he\u2019s been contacted about property in Dublin through the Sotheby\u2019s office there in his first couple weeks with the firm.\n\u201cI just wanted to clear a way for myself for the next step and grow my business, and Jameson sort of fit that role with the leadership, resources,\u201d he said.\nMone has a background as a contractor and in property management, and he\u2019s been working as a real estate broker for 10 years. He closed about $6 million in transaction volume last year, he said.\nOther\ncompetitors have been flexing\ntheir appeal to agents through recruiting in recent weeks as well.\nBaird &amp; Warner, Chicago\u2019s largest independent brokerage, picked up Steve Jasinski from Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Chicago and the Gerber Diaz Group from Compass in late 2025.\nMeanwhile, Compass added the Cohen Morsch team, formerly of Cross Street, to the brokerage last month.\n",

The building sits on nearly 9 acres.\nColliers represented the seller, and according to its marketing materials, the property was 51 percent occupied. Colliers\u2019 David Carter and Kolbe Curtice had the listing.\nThe three-story, 160,000-square-foot building was constructed in 2007 and has been lender-owned since Independent Bank bought it in an $18.25 million credit bid at a foreclosure sale in 2022, according to the deed.\nHouston-based Fuller Realty Interests was the previous owner, having purchased the property in 2014 for $26.2 million with a $22.75 million loan from Independent Bank. The loan was modified at least five times before the foreclosure sale.\nThe sale comes about a year after McKinley Homes entered the Texas market with the acquisition of Houston-based Liberty Home Builders. At the time, McKinley Homes said it would operate out of the former Liberty office, at 2821 Jordens Road.\nMcKinley Homes\u2019 Jinsong Yang said the company plans to occupy part of the building, making the transaction part of the growing\nowner-occupier office trend\nin Houston. Increasingly, office users are taking advantage of the city\u2019s sluggish office market by purchasing cheap or distressed property instead of renting.\nSuch buyers took more than 2 million square feet of vacant space off the\nHouston office market in 2025\n, according to Partners Real Estate. That includes the area\u2019s\nsecond-largest office sale\nof the year, in which Dallas-based midstream energy giant Energy Transfer bought the building formerly known as Marathon Oil Tower, at 5555 San Felipe Street, from Starwood Property Trust in April. Starwood took control of the tower in 2022 after prior owner M-M Properties defaulted on an $88 million loan.\n",

The deals worked out to $1,422 per square foot and $1,315 per square foot, respectively.\nDemand for homes in Mar Vista is being driven by families from Venice seeking more room and property owners impacted by the Palisades fire,\nTRD\npreviously reported.\nThe Modjeska Place deal was\nMar Vista\n\u2019s first residential deal ever to hit eight figures.\n",

        "content": "A proposed apartment tower in Fulton Market is testing how far Chicago is willing to stretch downtown zoning, as well as whether the city will risk undermining a development program that\u2019s steered tens of millions of dollars to South and West Side neighborhoods.\nUp for a vote at the Feb. 19 Chicago Plan Commission meeting is a 29-story, 347-unit apartment building at\n215 North Racine Avenue\n, according to an agenda posted online. The project is being pitched by a venture led by Chicago-based Domus Real Estate Group, which filed its zoning application last spring, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nOn its face, the building wouldn\u2019t look out of place in Fulton Market, where high-rise apartments have followed waves of office, hotel and restaurant development. The flashpoint is that\nDomus\nis seeking DX-16 base zoning \u2014 the densest classification in the city and the same designation that underpins Chicago\u2019s tallest Loop skyscrapers.\nThat request alarmed planning experts and neighborhood groups who said it would upend the zoning framework that has guided Fulton Market\u2019s transformation over the past decade, according to the publication. More critically, DX-16 comes with no cap on bonus density, opening the door to much larger towers and allowing developers to bypass payments into the city\u2019s Neighborhood Opportunity Bonus fund.\n\u201cThat would open the floodgates for everyone else,\u201d Eleanor Esser Gorski, a former planning department official who helped write Fulton Market\u2019s design guidelines and now leads the Chicago Architecture Center, told the outlet. \u201cI would be shocked if this would be allowed.\u201d\nUnder zoning rules adopted in 2017, the Fulton Market Innovation District generally allowed base zoning up to DX-5, with developers able to buy additional density through the Neighborhood Opportunity Bonus fund. The Chicago City Council has since\napproved projects\nwith base zoning as high as DX-7, paired with bonuses that push total density to a multiplier of 11.5.\nSince 2017,\nFulton Market developers\nhave paid roughly $83 million into the bonus fund, according to city data, with more committed by projects that haven\u2019t yet broken ground. Most of that cash is routed to grants for small businesses in South and West Side neighborhoods, with a portion earmarked for infrastructure and landmark projects.\nDX-16 would short-circuit that pipeline, the outlet reported. Critics warn developers could rework existing approvals or pursue new projects with far higher as-of-right density, vaporizing future bonus payments and straining infrastructure in a district already under pressure.\nA Plan Commission recommendation would send the project to the City Council Zoning Committee and then the full council, which typically follows the commission\u2019s lead. But the proposal is already pitting Alderman Walter \u201cRed\u201d Burnett, whose ward includes the site, against neighborhood groups and some planners.\nBurnett told the outlet that the objection isn\u2019t the building itself, but the precedent. He argued Fulton Market needs more family-sized units and flexibility to evolve, calling opposition rooted in \u201ctechnicalities of zoning.\u201d\nIn a statement, Domus\u2019 managing director, Phillip Ciaccio, said the firm worked with stakeholders and touted a sizable Neighborhood Opportunity Bonus payment, affordable units and a publicly accessible park planned for a separate site nearby. The statement did not directly address the DX-16 request.\nThe West Central Association Chamber of Commerce wasn\u2019t convinced. In a January letter to Burnett, the group said the zoning would be inconsistent with the neighborhood\u2019s established scale and vision.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Federal Realty Investment Trust, the principal developer and owner of Santana Row, was the seller.\nThe deal works out to $700,500 per unit, a sign of strength for Santana Row compared to other South Bay multifamily properties that have commanded lower per-unit prices in recent transactions. Last May, Federal Realty\nsold Levare\n, a 108-unit apartment building at 3003 Olin Avenue in Santana Row, to Hines for $73.9 million, or $684,300 per unit.\nLast month, the 336-unit\nFay apartment tower\nin downtown San Jose was foreclosed on due to a loan default; the lender for the development assigned a property value of $110 million, or $327,400 per unit, to the building. Last September, Stockbridge Capital Group\nsold the 230-unit Linq apartment complex\nin San Jose for $97.6 million, or $424,000 per unit. That same month,\nGreystar sold\nthe 948-unit Park Kiely complex in San Jose for $370 million, or $390,295 per unit.\nWaterton\nis planning to revamp\nMisora\nunder its ownership. Units will get new vinyl plank flooring, lighting and plumbing fixtures as well as quartz countertops, new backsplashes and stainless steel appliances.\nSantana Row has seen a surge in demand for housing driven by the tech sector in the \u201chigh-barrier-to-entry district,\u201d Ben Slack, Waterton\u2019s director of acquisitions, said, predicting continued \u201cfavorable market dynamics and strong supply-demand fundamentals\u201d in the region. Chicago-based Waterton now owns 920 apartment units in the Bay Area.\nFederal Realty isn\u2019t done building new apartment complexes at Santana Row. Last year, the Maryland-based firm began construction of a 258-unit apartment complex at\n358 Hatton Street\n, across Hatton Street from Misora. That project marks Federal Realty\u2019s first new residential development in a decade. The decision to sell Misora is part of the company\u2019s ongoing strategy of \u201cpruning [and] reinvesting\u201d its real estate portfolio, Don Wood, CEO of Federal Realty, said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Rather than hire an agent for project sales or\nproperty acquisitions\n, Amaya can now directly represent Crescent as a listing agent for the company\u2019s spec mansions, and as a buyer\u2019s agent for land purchases, he said.\nCrescent Estates Custom Homes is the luxury homebuilding division of Flower Mound-based Centurion American, Mehrdad Moayedi\u2019s prolific development company. Crescent\u2019s high-profile single-family developments include a\ngroup of homes\nbuilt on land that formerly belonged to the Crespi Estate on Walnut Hill Lane in Dallas.\nAmaya joined the company nine years ago as a sales representative after befriending Moayedi, who encouraged him to get his real estate license. He was promoted to vice president of Crescent three years ago.\nHis career sales volume exceeds $200 million, according to Amaya.\nCrescent Estates also started work last year on\nThe Residences at Creek Hollow\n, a $35 million, 31-unit luxury townhome project near Marsh Lane in Dallas, and recently completed the Water\u2019s Edge Condominiums on Lewisville Lake in Dallas. Sales are underway for\nThe Residences at Routh\n, a luxury condo project that Crescent developed at 3610 Routh Street, also in Dallas.\nElsewhere in Texas, Douglas Elliman recently poached top Houston luxury agent\nDana Johnson\nfrom Compass, and brought on Aspen agent\nTommy Kanarellis\nto sell the Ritz-Carlton Residences of Houston. Douglas Elliman lost Austin agent\nMichael Reisor\nto Compass last month.\nNationally,\nDouglas Elliman suffered from several high-profile personnel losses\nlast year, including executives Scott Durken and Richard Lampen.\nCrescent Estates is in the process of rezoning 4 acres in Dallas for a single-family development of 42 homes, Amaya said.\n",

        "content": "The Fort Worth Stockyards\u2019 development group is moving forward with a $30 million renovation of two of the district\u2019s most recognizable properties, even as a much larger expansion plan remains in limbo.\nStockyards Heritage Development Company, a partnership between California-based Majestic Realty and Fort Worth-based Hickman Companies, said it will begin renovations of the Historic Stockyards Hotel and the adjacent H3 Ranch restaurant this spring, according to company statements. The project marks the first major development announcement in the Stockyards since turmoil last year upended leadership overseeing the district\u2019s growth, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe hotel and restaurant are slated to close April 6. Officials told the outlet that they could reopen as soon as late this year, though early 2027 is also on the table. The renovation will focus on kitchen and back-of-house upgrades and a refreshed dining room, a more modest scope than earlier redevelopment pitches.\nMajestic and Hickman acquired the\nStockyards Hotel\nbuilding in 2022, including H3 Ranch and Booger Red\u2019s Saloon. The 118-year-old hotel has 42 rooms and 10 suites and has long leaned into its outlaw-and-country-music lore. Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow reportedly hid out there in 1933, and the hotel\u2019s\ncelebrity suite\nhas hosted Willie Nelson, George Strait and Garth Brooks.\n\u201cThe decision to renovate was made with great care and respect for what these properties represent,\u201d the partnership\u2019s COO Kristin Assad told the outlet, framing the work as preservation with an operational upgrade.\nThe renovation moves ahead as broader plans for the Stockyards appear paused. In 2024, the Fort Worth City Council approved an economic development agreement with\nMajestic\nand Hickman that envisioned nearly doubling the size of the Historic Stockyards. The deal contemplated 300,000 square feet of commercial space, hotels totaling at least 500 rooms, a 295-unit multifamily project and two underground garages with 1,300 spaces by 2032.\nThat second phase has yet to advance.\nMajestic\nrecently tapped Rick Kline to oversee the Stockyards after a public split with former development head Craig Cavileer. Kline said the partners remain committed to future development, but are taking a \u201cbalanced\u201d and \u201cappropriately-timed\u201d approach to undeveloped land.\nCity officials said discussions with the new leadership are ongoing, but there\u2019s no update on when the expansion might restart. Fort Worth Stockyards President Paul Paine said confidence remains high, noting the proposed buildout could top $1 billion.\nHovering over it all is a legal fight between Majestic and Cavileer playing out in Los Angeles County Superior Court, involving dueling claims tied to tens of millions of dollars in promissory notes and ownership stakes. A trial is currently scheduled for October, though legal experts said delays are likely.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "AvalonBay Communities has completed\nits sale of the Sunset Towers\napartments in the Inner Sunset.\nThe Virginia-based firm\nsold\nthe 243-unit property to Bridge Capital Partners and Friedkin Property Group for $105 million, the San Francisco Business Times reported, citing sources familiar with the deal.\nAvalonBay\nfielded higher offers from other firms for the property, which is three blocks south of Golden Gate Park, according to the Business Times. The deal for the six-decade-old development works out to about $432,000 per unit, meaning Bridge and Friedkin were willing to pay a relatively high price for an aging property. The Sunset Towers were built in 1961 and renovated in the mid-1990s. Because older high-rises often require more work than newer properties for owners to bring them up to code, Sunset Towers will likely need to undergo building-wide upgrades, though the cost for such modernization remains unclear, according to the Business Times.\nThe timing of the sale coincides with an apparent comeback in the San Francisco rental market. Rents are increasing with year-over-year growth at about 13 percent, per Apartment List data cited by the Business Times. In September, rents in San Francisco\nsurpassed pre-pandemic highs\n\u2014 a culmination of a nearly two-year-long upswing that began in mid-2024 after reaching a post-pandemic bottom. The rent surge, reaching a monthly median of $3,520 for a one-bedroom and $5,000 for a two-bedroom in September, has been attributed to limited new apartment supply and rising demand as more tech and artificial intelligence firms set up shop or expand their presence in the city.\nMeanwhile, multifamily investment volume is up more than 35 percent year-over-year, per Avison Young data\ncited\nby the Business Times. Investors have been focusing on existing properties in supply-constrained neighborhoods such as the Inner Sunset as few new market-rate projects emerge and many are paused as construction costs mount. More than\n20,000 units\nin San Francisco are waiting to be built as projects face years of delays or fall apart entirely. Last year, only 1,453 residential units were completed and plans were filed for 2,541 new homes, down from more than 5,000 delivered in 2020,\naccording\nto the San Francisco Planning Department.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Bondholders tied to the\nAmerican Dream megamall\nare accusing its owners and a North Jersey borough of playing valuation games that torpedoed the collateral behind roughly $800 million in municipal debt.\nIn a lawsuit filed in Bergen County chancery court, U.S. Bank Trust, acting as trustee for bondholders led by Nuveen, alleged that the Borough of East Rutherford and mall owner Triple Five Group colluded to slash the assessed value of the 3.5 million-square-foot retail and entertainment complex, according to\nBloomberg\n. The cuts, bondholders say, have left annual payments covering less than half of the interest owed on the bonds.\nAt the center of the dispute is American Dream\u2019s assessment, which dropped sharply over the past year.\nAfter carrying a valuation between roughly $2.6 billion and $3.3 billion from 2019 through 2024, the borough lowered the figure last year to $2.5 billion. A New Jersey tax court judge then reduced it again, to\nabout $1.65 billion\n. Because bond payments are tied to the mall\u2019s assessed value, the reductions flowed directly through to investors.\nThe bonds are backed by payments in lieu of taxes, or PILOTs, a structure frequently used in New Jersey to finance large developments. American Dream\u2019s PILOT bonds were part of a $1.1 billion tax-exempt financing package that helped bankroll the long-delayed mall, which includes an indoor ski slope, water park and amusement park adjacent to MetLife Stadium.\nBondholders claim the process behind the new valuation was anything but neutral. American Dream pressured East Rutherford to replace its longtime appraiser with a less experienced firm that produced a \u201cdramatically reduced\u201d appraisal, according to the bondholders. The borough and the mall\u2019s owners then ensured the valuation lacked sufficient data to withstand scrutiny in tax court, the suit alleges.\nThe incentives, bondholders argue, were skewed from the start. East Rutherford receives its share of the PILOT payments before bondholders, regardless of the mall\u2019s valuation, insulating the town from the downside.\nThe American Dream mall, meanwhile, benefits directly from a lower assessment through reduced payments, according to the suit.\nNuveen holds nearly 90 percent of the outstanding PILOT bonds, amplifying the stakes of the case for the municipal market.\nA spokesman for American Dream did not immediately respond to a request for comment from\nThe Real Deal\nand East Rutherford officials also did not respond to Bloomberg.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "More than four years after putting a $3 million deposit on an unfinished penthouse in disgraced developer Rishi Kapoor\u2019s first luxury condominium project, a stranded condo buyer is still fighting to recoup its funds.\nThe condo buyer, Mironrest CG, objected to court-appointed receiver Bernice Lee seeking to hire her own law firm to handle clawback litigation.\nIt\u2019s the latest kerfuffle in the ongoing liquidation saga of\nLocation Ventures\n, the defunct Coral Gables firm founded by\nKapoor\n.\nLee and Mironest CG attorney Jonathan Minsker declined comment.\nThe proposed contingency fee for Kozyak Tropin &amp; Throckmorton, where she is a partner, is \u201cexcessive and unreasonable,\u201d Miami-based Mironest CG said in a motion filed last month. The stranded condo buyer wants U.S. District Judge Jacqueline Becerra to reject Lee\u2019s request.\nLee is seeking approval to hire the Kozyak firm for a fee based on 27 percent to 33 percent of any gross proceeds from clawback lawsuits and settlements, court filings show.\nLee\nwas appointed receiver of Location Ventures shortly after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Kapoor, his firm and its affiliates for fraud.\nKapoor was accused of misappropriating\n$93 million\nin investor funds meant for his real estate projects, most of which fell apart as Location Ventures imploded in a tsunami of lawsuits and investigations, including probes by the FBI and IRS, according to published reports.\nThe SEC settled its claims against\nKapoor\nin November 2024, after he agreed to conditions including not serving as an officer or director of a company with securities for five years.\nSince then, Lee has focused on selling off Location Ventures\u2019 properties, including a Miami Beach development site for\n$17.5 million\n. Most recently, the receiver sought approval to sell an unfinished mixed-use project in Coconut Grove to a lender with a\n$27.4 million\ncredit bid.\nMironest CG\u2019s condo deposit\nKapoor\u2019s Location Ventures completed most of Villa Valencia in the summer of 2022. The 13-story Coral Gables building with 39 units represented the then-six-year-old firm\u2019s first luxury condominium project.\nBut despite obtaining a certificate of occupancy, the developer left three penthouses at Villa Valencia unfinished, including a top-floor unit that\nMironest CG\nagreed to purchase for $6 million, the buyer\u2019s motion states.\nThe true identity of Mironest CG\u2019s owner is unknown. State corporate records only list the registered agent, Miami-based law firm Pardo Jackson Gainesburg. The name of Mironest CG\u2019s authorized representative is redacted in a copy of the purchase agreement. The entity is among dozens of investors, buyers and vendors that have sued Location Ventures and its affiliates in Miami-Dade Circuit Court.\nGeneral contractor accusations\nMironest CG alleges in its motion that Location Ventures\u2019 general contractor for Villa Vallencia, Winmar Construction, assisted in \u201cthe diversion of millions of dollars,\u201d including billing $10 million for work on the penthouses while only actually completing $2.2 million in work.\nLocation Ventures allegedly siphoned $93.9 million in sale proceeds from Villa Valencia\u2019s completed units as a \u201cpiggy bank for the fraud \u2026 to arbitrarily repay lenders and for other projects,\u201d the motion states.\nMironest CG alleges its deposit was used as collateral for loans provided by Location Ventures insiders.\nWhen Mironest CG pressured Location Ventures to finish its penthouse, the developer told the buyer it needed to pay an additional $1.4 million directly to Winmar to complete the build-out, the motion states.\n\u201cBeing unaware of the fraud, and eager to move from rented accommodations into their new home,\u201d the funds were wired, the motion states. \u201cSadly, even though the wires were sent to Winmar, they still essentially evaporated.\u201d\nWinmar CEO Edwin Vallegas did not respond to requests for comment.\nMironest CG\u2019s objections\nLee\u2019s investigation is likely to recover tens of millions of dollars from Winmar and other Location Ventures insiders, the motion alleges.\nHowever, the proposed contingency fee structure for Lee\u2019s law firm \u201cwould be manifestly unreasonable and harmful to the estate\u2019s innocent stakeholders\u201d if any funds obtained via claw back measures are not enough to repay claims by Mronest CG and others, the motion states.\nThe contingency is \u201calmost certain to result in a windfall fee of tens of millions of dollars to\u201d Lee\u2019s firm, while reducing by approximately one-third the remaining proceeds available to satisfy claims by Mironest CG and other plaintiffs, the motion states.\nMironest CG alleges that Lee failed to obtain proposals from other qualified law firms and failed to explore other options such as litigation financing. To avoid an appearance of a potential conflict of interest, Lee \u201cshould be required to explore the market for alternative firms, fee structures and financing options,\u201d the motion states.",

        "content": "The Chicago Housing Authority quietly reversed course on a move to permanently bar the daughter of a longtime board commissioner from doing business with the agency, reopening the door to future contracts after an internal fight over procurement rules and ethics.\nThe contractor, Lovie Diggs, faced what CHA officials initially deemed permanent debarment after she was arrested, charged and later pleaded guilty in a criminal case, according to agency records and Cook County court documents. An investigation by WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times first\nreported\nthat after Diggs\u2019 attorney appealed directly to CHA leadership, the housing authority scrapped the debarment altogether.\nDiggs\u2019 firm, Lavi Decor and Cleaning Company, has been paid more than $1 million by the CHA. Diggs is the daughter of\nDebra Parker\n, a CHA board commissioner since 2018. Both outlets reported last fall that Diggs was one of three\nCHA contractors\nwith close personal ties to Parker. The other two companies are owned by Parker\u2019s sister and her longtime boyfriend, and together the three businesses have collected nearly $22 million from the agency.\nThe Diggs case stems from a February 2023 arrest in which prosecutors accused her of using another woman\u2019s identity to obtain more than $5,000 in merchandise from a Bob\u2019s Discount Furniture store, according to the publications. In 2024, Diggs pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge as part of a deal that dropped a felony identity theft count. She was sentenced to probation, which she later completed.\nCHA Inspector General Kathryn Richards concluded the case triggered grounds for permanent debarment under agency policy, which allows bans for conduct involving fraud, theft or deception. In July, CHA\u2019s contracting department formally notified Diggs that it intended to bar her \u2014 and any company she owns or controls \u2014 from future CHA work.\nDiggs\u2019 attorney pushed back, arguing she was never convicted of a felony and that her case was discharged without a formal conviction. Internal emails show\nCHA lawyers\ninitially floated an 18-month voluntary suspension as a compromise. Days later, the agency abandoned enforcement entirely.\n\u201cCHA has decided to cancel the proposed debarment proceedings,\u201d Deputy Chief Procurement Officer Sheila Johnson wrote in an Oct. 30 letter, allowing Diggs to continue participating in\nCHA programs\nwithout interruption.\nNeither Diggs, Parker nor Richards provided comment to the publication. CHA board chair Matthew Brewer and agency spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment.\nIn a report issued last month, the inspector general said Diggs\u2019 guilty plea still ran afoul of procurement rules and noted court transcripts showed she acknowledged using another person\u2019s identification to obtain goods. Richards also flagged broader concerns about favoritism tied to Parker\u2019s family and associates.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Artificial intelligence companies are warning Illinois lawmakers that the state risks losing billions of dollars in data center investment unless it loosens the nation\u2019s toughest biometric privacy law \u2014 a threat that\u2019s colliding with deep skepticism from labor unions, environmentalists and suburban communities.\nAt the center of the fight is Illinois\u2019 Biometric Information Privacy Act, or BIPA, a 2008 law that gives individuals the right to sue companies for improperly collecting or using biometric data such as facial images, fingerprints or retina scans. The Chicago Tribune\nreported\nthat industry groups argue the statute creates unlimited legal exposure for AI-driven data centers, which increasingly rely on biometric data to train algorithms and power everything from facial recognition to targeted advertising.\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing billions of dollars of investment that Illinois is just not even in the running for,\u201d said Brad Tietz, state policy director for the Data Center Coalition, whose members include Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Meta.\nIn Indiana, for instance, Amazon is spending $26 billion on a massive cluster of AI data centers near South Bend, while Wisconsin and Indiana are rapidly\noutpacing Illinois\nin planned hyperscale projects. Illinois currently has 108 data centers of all sizes, nearly twice as many as Indiana and Wisconsin combined, according to Baxtel data cited by the publication. But looking ahead, Indiana has 37 large-scale projects planned or under construction, compared with just five in Illinois through 2032.\nDevelopers say BIPA is a key reason. Unlike other states, Illinois allows private lawsuits and statutory damages for biometric violations, and companies could be liable each time a person\u2019s image or data is reused for a new purpose, according to the outlet. Since 2020, Meta, Google and TikTok\u2019s parent have paid a combined $842 million to settle Illinois privacy claims.\nOpposition to changing the law is fierce. Trial lawyers call BIPA a critical civil rights safeguard. Environmental groups want stricter rules on data center power consumption, water use and diesel backup generators. Local officials, meanwhile, are facing resident backlash over noise, traffic and infrastructure strain.\nThose tensions are already playing out on the ground in the Chicago suburbs. Aurora enacted a temporary moratorium on\nnew data centers\nlast fall after noise complaints, while Naperville\u2019s City Council\nrejected\na proposed 145,000-square-foot facility in January. DeKalb County, by contrast, has approved nearly 3 million square feet of data center space tied to Meta and other tech giants, though\nadditional projects\nthere are now on hold amid power constraints and legal uncertainty.\nEnvironmental advocates recently introduced the Power Act, which would raise electricity rates for large data center users and restrict where facilities can be built. Industry groups warn the bill would make Illinois an even bigger outlier.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s enough to make any real estate hater burn: Cayre Equities just sold 254 West 35th Street for 62 percent more than they had paid just 14 months before, as my colleague Liz Cryan\nreported\n.\nThe key to the $10 million increase was that between the purchase and the sale, the city\nrezoned Midtown South\n, including Cayre\u2019s Garment District building.\nWhat should we make of this?\nOne thing that real estate\u2019s critics dislike about rezoning is that it adds value to properties. It creates wealth out of thin air for whomever was lucky or smart enough to own a rezoned parcel at the time.\nCritics call buyers of land that might be rezoned \u201cspeculators,\u201d a derogatory term that suggests investors are trying to make money without doing any real work. They also claim property speculation makes the city more expensive.\nThis is stupid on several levels.\nFirst, rezoning is necessary to make the best use of land when circumstances change, as they have in the Garment District. Midtown West is now much more valuable to society as residential or office space than as manufacturing.\nCity politicians resisted rezoning it for decades in a misguided attempt to save textile jobs, but nearly all of those jobs disappeared or moved elsewhere anyway. The government was also slow to rezone manufacturing districts in Long Island City, Gowanus, Inwood and Red Hook.\nSecond, \u201cspeculators\u201d play a useful role in the market by buying properties that someone wants to sell. Markets need liquidity. If Mrs. Jones wants to cash out a longtime family property and retire to Arizona, she needs buyers. To her, they are not speculators, but investors who make her golden years truly golden. (Cayre bought 254 West 35th from\nGonca Chelsea\u2019s LLC\n.)\nThird, every time a property is sold, the city, state and Metropolitan Transportation Authority collect transfer taxes. Critics who believe sales and property upgrades make the city more expensive should consider how much higher their subway fare would be, or if garbage pickup would be free, if not for transfer taxes.\nState and city transfer taxes on sales of $25 million or more range from 1.4 percent to\nalmost 6 percent\n. The Cayre family\u2019s sale of 254 West 35th generated\n$773,665 in transfer taxes\n\u2014 3 percent of the sale. Its purchase in 2024 produced\n$528,912\nin transfer taxes.\nIf you believe the family did nothing to make millions of dollars on its flip, ask yourself what the government did to reap $1.3 million.\nIt doesn\u2019t take zero work to buy and sell a property. The buyer is putting money at risk rather than, say, buying a Treasury note paying a guaranteed 4 percent. Acquiring investment properties involves a lot of due diligence, networking and fundraising from investors, among other things. It takes a lot more time than buying an index fund with a few mouse clicks.\nThe Cayres made a profit, but it could also be called earnings. It\u2019s not passive income. It\u2019s money derived from work.\n",

        "content": "As two long-delayed high-profile projects head to the finish line in Boca Raton, details of the financial and legal problems that slowed their development are coming to light.\nMark Gensheimer\u2019s Penn-Florida unveiled ambitious plans for Boca Raton a decade ago. The firm, already an office owner in the city, was pursuing an assisted living facility. It unveiled plans in 2015 for its marquee Mandarin Oriental condominium and hotel in a gushing news release.\nBut over the past two years, Penn-Florida faced foreclosure suits on two of its office buildings and the assisted living development site, which is vacant. It filed for bankruptcy on the unfinished Mandarin Oriental hotel in December; it has also confronted lawsuits from Mandarin Oriental condo buyers angered by its delayed completion. The branded hotel and condo originally were slated to be finished in 2017. The firm also went through bankruptcy for another project, an apartment building at Via Mizner, its mixed-use Boca development that also includes the branded condos and hotel. It managed to keep a stake in the property after partnering with multifamily syndicator and social media personality Grant Cardone.\nPenn-Florida attributed the woes to post-pandemic headwinds and bad timing for loan maturations.\nIts debts provided low leverage, ranging from 25 percent to 50 percent loan-to-value, and were \u201cin good standing\u201d when they matured, the company said in a statement. But three of the matured debts were purchased by \u201copportunistic\u201d loan buyers who immediately pursued foreclosures \u201choping to take ownership of the properties and realize a significant profit,\u201d though Penn-Florida paid off each debt in full through capital restructuring, refinancing or property sale.\nFor years, record commercial and residential leasing suggested South Florida\u2019s tri-county region was immune to issues facing most other markets. But Penn-Florida\u2019s saga shows the challenges landlords and developers in South Florida now face: retrenching financiers, tighter lending standards and illiquid markets, elevated interest rates and mounting construction and insurance costs \u2013\u2013 all factors Penn-Florida cited for its troubles.\nStill, construction of the Mandarin Oriental condos now is expected to wrap up this year, followed by the hotel shortly after, Penn-Florida said. Not defeated by the distress, the firm has queued up another marquee mixed-use project, University Village.\nThat development, near Florida Atlantic University\u2019s Boca Raton campus, is planned with 829 residential units, including apartments, for-sale homes, an assisted living facility, as well as a hotel, offices, retail space and trails. It obtained master plan approval, and its site plan application is pending.\nHere is more about Penn-Florida\u2019s debt troubles of the past two years.\nMandarin Oriental hotel\nPenn-Florida filed for bankruptcy in December on the\n12-story, 164-key hotel\nthat\u2019s under construction at 103 East Camino Real.\nIts senior secured lender, TIG Romspen US Master Mortgage, provided a $140 million loan in 2021. Penn-Florida defaulted on it at its 2023 maturity, court records show.\nA restructuring agreement in collaboration with its lender calls for the refinancing or sale of the property. Penn-Florida requested approval for the sale procedures last Wednesday, though it said it is doing so out of an abundance of caution in case a refinancing doesn\u2019t work out.\nTIG Romspen is listed as a Cayman Islands limited partnership with an office in Toronto, Canada.\nAmong the unsecured claims listed in the bankruptcy filing is one from Mandarin Oriental in Marietta, Georgia for $502,600 marked as \u201cdisputed.\u201d\nIn Palm Beach Circuit Court, Penn-Florida\u2019s affiliate faces lawsuits from five project contractors. The contractors are required by state law to sue \u201cto protect their lien rights,\u201d Penn-Florida said.\nThe hotel is topped off and \u201cstructurally\u201d finished, Penn-Florida said in a December news release about its bankruptcy filing.\nMandarin Oriental condo\nThe 88-unit condo building at 105 East Camino Real hasn\u2019t been the subject of lender foreclosures or Chapter 11 reorganizations.\nThe building, slated for completion this summer, is substantially presold, Penn-Florida\u2019s release says. But the yearslong delays have angered buyers, with eight open\nsuits\nagainst Penn-Florida\u2019s affiliate filed by buyers seeking their deposits back.\nAlthough Penn-Florida declined to comment on the pending litigation, only saying the purchase and sale agreements have been and will be honored, in court filings it has argued that the PSAs made it clear that the developer isn\u2019t obligated to substantially finish the project by the anticipated completion date and that construction may be extended due to unavailability of labor, materials and financing, among other hurdles.\n101 Via Mizner\nThe 14-story, 366-unit apartment building at 101 East Camino Real is the only building Penn-Florida completed at its Via Mizner project.\nThe firm finished the project, called 101 Via Mizner, in 2016.\nPenn-Florida\u2019s affiliate filed for\nChapter 11 reorganization\non the property in January of last year, on the same day the property was due to go up for a Uniform Commercial Code foreclosure auction. Blackstone Mortgage Trust previously sought UCC foreclosure on a\n$145 million\nloan.\nPenn-Florida paid off the debt last year after it partnered with Cardone on the\n$235 million\npurchase of the property. Cardone\u2019s affiliate paid $220 million, and Penn-Florida\u2019s entity covered the $15 million balance, according to court filings.\nDespite court records at the time saying the joint venture may convert the rentals into condos, Penn-Florida said there\u2019s no such plan currently.\n101 Via Mizner is more than 90 percent occupied, according to Penn-Florida.\nAssisted living site\nPenn-Florida planned a 193-unit assisted living facility on the 1-acre property at 375 East Royal Palm Road.\nThe firm paid $1.2 million for the site and adjacent properties in 2005, records show.\nIt borrowed $2.5 million on the land in 2016 from City National Bank of Florida, increasing the loan to $5.7 million in three loan modifications in subsequent years.\nIn 2024, City National Bank of Florida reassigned the loan to an affiliate of Miami Beach-based distressed debt investor Safe Harbor Equity, which filed for foreclosure against Penn-Florida on the $5.7 million loan, alleging default on the 2024 maturity. The foreclosure also was against Gensheimer, the loan\u2019s guarantor.\nPenn-Florida demolished the two-story building on the site but never started\nconstruction\nof the assisted living center. It sold the land to Boca Raton-based SobelCo in October for\n$27 million\n, paying its debt and settling the foreclosure.\nBoca Raton offices\nIn 2024, a Penn-Florida affiliate was hit with two foreclosure lawsuits on a pair of Boca Raton office buildings.\nAn affiliate of Kore Capital sued over the $9.6 million balance on three loans for the seven-story, 33,100-square-foot office building at 101 North Federal Highway and the $10.8 million balance on a debt for the the five-story, 40,200-square-foot building at 1 North Federal Highway, according to Palm Beach Circuit Court filings.\nPenn-Florida developed the 101 North Federal Highway building, completing it in 2003, and paid $8.8 million for the 1 North Federal Highway building and surrounding properties, records show.\nKore Capital alleged Penn-Florida defaulted on the maturity of three loans for 101 North Federal, originally issued by City National Bank of Florida in 2016, 2018 and 2020 for $9.2 million, $1.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively, according to court filings. The lender also alleged Penn-Florida defaulted on the maturity of a $13.8 million loan, originally issued by City National Bank of Florida in 2016.\nBoth suits named Gensheimer as a defendant.\nKore Capital had both suits dismissed in May, after Boca Raton-based real estate investor James Batmasian took over Penn-Florida\u2019s ownership entities for the buildings, according to court and state corporate records. The sale price wasn\u2019t public.\nBatmasian\nleads Investments Limited.\nPenn-Florida said the loans were fully repaid but declined to say how much Batmasian paid for the properties.\n",

        "content": "It looks like Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan are joining billionaire tech power couple Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez on Indian Creek Island.\nThe Meta CEO and his wife are in contract to buy 2 Indian Creek Island Road from Peter Cancro, the founder of Jersey Mike\u2019s Subs,\nthe Wall Street Journal\nreported. The deal is off-market and it is unclear whether brokers are involved.\nThe price will be between $150 million and $200 million, which could set a record for the most expensive single-family home sale in Miami-Dade County history. Cancro bought the 1.8-acre waterfront compound for $37 million in 2021, property records show. He recently completed the mansion on the property, and records have not yet been updated to reflect the square footage and scope of the home.\nThe couple are the latest in a wave of Silicon Valley titans acquiring South Florida homes.\nBillionaires are fleeing California because a\nproposed 5\u202fpercent wealth tax\non fortunes over $1\u202fbillion could hit them with a one\u2011time levy, prompting many to relocate before the Jan.\u202f1 residency cutoff. With wealth estimated at $220 billion, that could cost Zuckerberg $11 billion. Florida\u2019s lack of income tax is among the factors that makes it an attractive choice for residency.\nGoogle co-founder Larry Page recently\ndropped $173 million on a pair\nof waterfront Coconut Grove estates. His co-founder Sergey Brin is reportedly home shopping in Miami Beach, and is buying the Allison Island home of LVMH Americas Chairman &amp; CEO Michael Burke.\nStill, Zuckerberg\u2019s purchase is a surprise to some of Miami\u2019s market insiders.\n\u201cThis is one I\u2019m actually shocked by,\u201d said Dina Goldentayer. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of him being in the marketplace.\u201d\nThe Douglas Elliman agent is a top broker in Miami\u2019s ultra-luxury market and a veteran of Indian Creek deals \u2014 her client roster there includes Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos.\nShe called Zuckerberg\u2019s buy the \u201cprecise consequence\u201d of California\u2019s proposed wealth tax, and a major get for the Miami market.\n\u201cI think we need more actionable owners given the demand that is out there from our hungry California buyers,\u201d she said.\nIndian Creek has proven popular with ultra-luxury buyers in recent years. Known as \u201cBillionaire\u2019s Bunker,\u201d it is a completely private island with its own municipal government and police force.\nBezos has shelled out\n$234 million\non a trio of properties on the island. There has been speculation he was also the buyer of a fourth 1.8 acre estate for\n$105 million\nin June, which is adjacent to two of the lots he already owns.\nIndian Creek sellers are looking to capitalize on the demand for the island\u2019s homes with previously unheard of prices. Dr. Aaron Rollins, a cosmetic surgeon, and his wife, Marine Rollins, a real estate agent, have listed their incomplete waterfront mansion for\n$200 million\n.",

        "content": "Here they go again. The Altman Brothers Team is once again growing with the opening of the group\u2019s third office, located in Rancho Santa Fe.\nThe Douglas Elliman team celebrated the new office\u2019s grand opening on Monday, with the push into San Diego County following 2024\u2019s unveiling of a\nCorona del Mar\noutpost at 3700 East Coast Highway.\nThe newest office, at 6009 Paseo Delicias, is currently lean with Jason Saks the sole agent staffing the office and serving as an area partner for The Altman Brothers. The team confirmed through a brokerage spokesperson the goal is to eventually staff up the office to three agents.\nJosh Altman, who started The Altman Brothers with his brother Matt Altman and formerly starred on\n\u201cMillion Dollar Listing Los Angeles,\u201d\nsaid in a press release on the new office that San Diego is \u201chaving a major moment,\u201d which the new location will look to capitalize on.\nThe past two years saw Saks, along with The Altman Brothers, close on almost $200 million in San Diego County on- and off-market sales.\nSaks and Josh last month listed 3000 Sandy Lane in Del Mar for $49.9 million, or $12,834 per square foot, for the beachfront property. It\u2019s the new office\u2019s most recent listing and brings its total inventory volume for the San Diego market to $160 million. Realty Holdings purchased the property in 2022 for $18.9 million, according to property records, and remodeled the home in the gated community of Sandy Lane before listing it.\nAmong the office\u2019s other sizable listings is 6308 Camino De La Costa in La Jolla, which is asking $35 million, or roughly $3,411 per square foot.\nThe new office will focus on luxury markets within the county, including Rancho Santa Fe, Del Mar, La Jolla, Encinitas, Solana Beach, Carmel Valley and Poway.\nBig brand\nThe growth of what Douglas Elliman President and CEO Michael Liebowitz called \u201cone of the most powerful luxury real estate\nbrands\nin the world,\u201d comes after the team closed on a total of more than $1.3 billion in volume last year.\nOn\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s most recent\nrankings\nof Los Angeles County\u2019s top agents and teams for 2025, The Altman Brothers placed fourth with $591.7 million in volume across 88 trades. The rankings are based on on-market deals of $1 million or more between July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025.\nThe Altman Brothers in 2019 opened its first standalone address on Robertson Boulevard in Los Angeles\u2019 Beverly Grove neighborhood.\nIn August 2024, the team opened its first permanent Corona del Mar office with a 15-year lease for a property once occupied by a bank. The team had earlier operated in a temporary space two blocks away, while the permanent location was being renovated. At the time of the Orange County opening, Josh projected to\nTRD\nthe office would generate around $1 billion in sales annually. He also guessed the office could mature to rival that of Los Angeles, particularly given the absence of a tax in Orange County akin to Measure United to House L.A.\nThe 2022 ballot measure that went into effect in April 2023 applies a 4 percent tax on real estate deals starting at $5.3 million and 5.5 percent on trades of $10.6 million or more.\n",

Their client portfolio includes institutional owners, Fortune 500 companies and family-owned businesses \u2014 and they\u2019ve dealt with logistics and distribution facilities, manufacturing, last-mile assets and outdoor storage.\nKwak counts a 38-year career as a commercial real estate broker and business owner; McKnight has completed over 200 transactions valued above $600 million; Kolander has seven years of experience and Hayne six.\nThat wasn\u2019t the only move throughout Orange County and Los Angeles\u2019 commercial real estate spaces in recent months.\nKidder Mathews tapped Jonathan Steier as vice president of the company\u2019s Sherman Oaks office. He has 25 years of experience, mostly in retail leasing and investment sales throughout Los Angeles, particularly in the Valley. He has facilitated about $100 million in real estate deals and completed more than 400 leases. He has worked with brands such as Chipotle, Chase and Petco.\nCBRE hired Patrick McGrath as executive managing director of its South Bay office. He\u2019ll lead strategy and operations for the region, and his two-decade long tenure as a senior commercial real estate executive should help. McGrath left Savills where he was chief information officer and president of North America\u2019s West region.\nCommerce Construction Company \u2014 a subsidiary of one of the country\u2019s largest privately owned developers Majestic Realty \u2014 named Ryan Merlette, a 20-year industry veteran, as its new president.

Merlette will lead the design and construction teams responsible for executing and delivering Majestic\u2019s development projects, as well as projects for third-party clients. Merlette began at Commerce Construction in 2017 and served as executive vice president since.\nRetail brokerage Hanley Investment Group, headquartered in Corona Del Mar, promoted three of its team members: Dylan Mallory, who went from senior vice president to executive vice president, and Brad Dessy and Sean Cox, who went from vice presidents to senior vice presidents. All three specialize in the acquisition and disposition of retail properties. Mallory has closed over $300 million in retail property sales since 2020; and Cox has sold over $300 million in retail assets since 2022.\nSanta Monica-based Turner Impact Capital, one of the nation\u2019s largest social impact investment firms that owns real estate throughout the country, announced some elevations, too, of four senior executives to co-head and managing director roles. That includes Brock Miller and Katie Winthrop on housing and Logan Harper and Kate Hirsh on healthcare. Miller will oversee multifamily acquisitions and has held prior roles at Greystar and Goldman Sachs; Winthrop will lead asset management and previously worked at Cohen &amp; Steers; the latter two will focus on healthcare real estate development.\n",

        "content": "Venice\u2019s latest affordable housing project has gotten a funding boost from Los Angeles County, much to the chagrin of the city of Los Angeles that has spent more than $1 million in legal fees fighting its development.\nThe Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors\napproved nearly $44 million\nin loans\nfor affordable housing\ndevelopments across the county, including $3 million for Hollywood Community Housing and Venice Community Housing\u2019s Venice Dell project, Palisades News reported. The $3 million injection is in addition to the more than\n$42.5 million\nthat the California Department of Housing and Community Development committed to the development.\nWhen complete, Venice Dell will consist of low-rise buildings containing 120 apartments and ground-floor retail on a 2.7-acre parking lot at Venice Boulevard and Pacific Avenue. Supervisor Lindsey Horvath, whose district includes the Venice Dell site, announced the funding allocation last week. The Los Angeles City Council first approved the project in 2021, and in 2024, the\nCalifornia Coastal Commission\ngranted a coastal development permit after years of review and legal challenges given its proximity to the beach.\nDespite the approvals, including from the City Council itself, the project still hasn\u2019t gotten off the ground. The city has spent more than $1 million on outside legal counsel fees related to the project; recent allocations include $650,000 through March. The office of city attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto has continued to seek additional funding for litigation, including a $760,000 request at the top of this year.\nTraci Park, who represents the area on the City Council, has derided the Venice Dell project over concerns about parking loss, coastal access and overall cost. Last October, the City Council began looking into converting the Los Angeles Department of Transportation-owned parking lot at the site into a mobility hub while studying relocating Venice Dell to another nearby parcel.\nHorvath, meanwhile, has criticized the city\u2019s legal spending, including the $650,000 set aside for outside counsel fees through March. \u201cThe city has now spent over $1 million fighting\naffordable housing\nprojects,\u201d Horvath said, per Palisades News. \u201cWhile they\u2019re fighting housing, we\u2019re funding it.\u201d The city\u2019s total outside counsel fees related to such projects including Venice Dell exceed $2.5 million, the supervisor said. \u201cIt is ridiculous to spend taxpayer dollars to oppose a project that has been approved at every level of government, even by the Coastal Commission,\u201d Horvath said. \u201cIt is time for the city to get out of its own way and allow Venice Dell to move forward.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The project also calls for turning a parking garage south of the existing offices into a new five-story, 81-unit residential structure. The developer would provide parking for 55 vehicles across the two buildings.\nThe plans, recently considered by the City of Pasadena\u2019s\nDesign Commission\n, include a mix of studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments for low- and moderate-income households, but for two units reserved for on-site property managers. In Los Angeles County, low-income is generally\ndefined\nas one person making below $84,850 annually, or $121,150 for a household of four. Moderate-income individuals make below $89,550, while households of four make $127,900.\nFSY Architects is designing the renovated buildings. The blueprints call for updating the existing 1966 office building with new operable windows and open spaces for residents. The proposal was presented to the Design Commission for preliminary review but has yet to secure approval.\nUnder its housing element, the City of Pasadena must plan for 9,429 new residential units by 2029.\nElysian Housing has another sizable project underway on the other side of L.A. County: an affordable housing complex in Warner Center in the west\nSan Fernando Valley\n. In October, the company filed an application with the Los Angeles Department of City Planning for The Green, a seven-story building with 316 one, two- and three-bedroom apartments on a 120,000-square-foot lot at 21155 Califa Street. Like Elysian Housing\u2019s endeavor in Pasadena, The Green will be reserved entirely for low- and moderate-income renters, minus two manager\u2019s units on site. That project will be part of\nWarner Center\u2019s transformation\ninto a mixed-use district anchored by affordable housing. Last week,\nWellpointe acquired\na 4.7-acre site at 6400 Canoga Avenue from Sandstone Properties with plans for a 100 percent affordable housing development.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Presidio Bay Ventures\nis growing its San Francisco portfolio with the purchase of an office building in the Mission District.\nThe locally based investor\nspent\nroughly $27.5 million for the four-story, 55,000-square-foot office building at 333 Valencia Street, the San Francisco Business Times reported. Presidio Bay acquired the property through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, according to San Francisco Assessor-Recorder documents cited by the Business Times.\nThe deal works out to $500 per square foot, making it one of the higher-priced office sales to close in San Francisco in recent years. The price could be attributed to the San Francisco Department of Public Health\u2019s long-term lease in the building, the Business Times reported, citing local market sources. The city occupies 80 percent of the building and still has about a decade left on its lease, according to JLL, which brokered 333 Valencia\u2019s sale.\nPresidio Bay plans to \u201cactivate [333 Valencia\u2019s] ground floor to meet near-term neighborhood needs while contributing to the long-term revitalization of San Francisco\u2019s commercial corridors,\u201d founder\nK.

The group began marketing the building for sale the year prior with a $60 million pricing guidance, the Registry\nreported\n, though its final list price is unclear. The ownership group invested more than $20 million revamp 333 Valencia, while the city of San Francisco invested an additional $6.4 million to upgrade its space in the building.\nPresidio Bay didn\u2019t shy away from downtown San Francisco in the post-pandemic years when many investors were initially wary of acquiring assets in the city. In August 2023, the firm bought\n60 Spear Street\nfor $41 million, or about $260 per square foot, which helped reset office building values in the city and laid the groundwork for\nits ongoing comeback\n, according to the Business Times. Last spring, Presidio Bay partnered with Artemis Real Estate Partners to acquire the 121-unit Olume Apartments at 1401 Mission Street.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The building will include 10 floors of office space totaling more than 206,000 square feet, sitting atop an eight-story parking garage with 1,345 spaces. The project is slated for completion in February 2028, the filing shows.\nHall Group\ndeclined to share additional details, saying the project remains in the planning stage. As with most TDLR filings, the specifications are preliminary and subject to change.\nThe site, referred to as Hall Park C5, has been in play for years. In March 2025, the Frisco City Council approved an amendment to its master development agreement with\nHall Group\nand its partners that expanded Kaleidoscope Park and cleared the way for a large parking garage that could support a new office building. That move effectively scrapped earlier plans for a performing arts center on the site.\nThe office building is the latest addition to Hall Park, Craig Hall\u2019s long-running redevelopment of a 162-acre campus he began assembling in 1989. What started as a suburban office park has morphed into a dense, mixed-use district with offices, apartments, hotels and public art, with total investment pegged around $7 billion.\nHall Park now includes 15 office buildings, along with residential projects and hospitality. The 224-room Hall Park Hotel, which opened in 2024, was recently named one of the best new hotels in the country by USA Today\u2019s 10Best Readers\u2019 Choice Awards.\nThe development sits just south of The Star, the\nDallas Cowboys\u2019 headquarters\nand practice facility, anchoring one of North Texas\u2019 most active\ncorporate corridors\n.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Two Downtown Austin properties controlled by embattled developer Nate Paul\u2019s World Class Holdings could soon trade for a combined $172 million, potentially setting the stage for new skyscraper-scale development.\nA court-appointed receiver is negotiating sales of the property at 99 Trinity Street and a three-parcel assemblage near the Austonian tower at 201 and 203 Colorado Street, plus a neighboring parking lot, according to a receiver report filed Feb. 2 in Travis County court. The Austin Business Journal\nreported\nthat Greg Milligan, who was named receiver in 2019 for the World Class entities that own the sites, said contracts could be ready for court approval \u201cin the coming months.\u201d\nThe prospective buyer has not been identified. But marketing materials from Chicago-based Harney Partners, where Milligan is an executive vice president, peg the combined purchase price at $172 million. If that number holds, it would nearly double the properties\u2019 combined appraised value of about $88.7 million, according to the Travis Central Appraisal District.\nBoth sites were listed in late 2024, with purchase agreements signed in early 2025, subject to court approval. JLL is marketing the property at 99 Trinity and lists it as under contract.\nThe deals further highlight the unraveling of\nWorld Class\n, led by CEO\nNate Paul\n, whose legal troubles have cast\na long shadow\nover his downtown portfolio. Paul spent time in Travis County Jail for contempt of court amid a bitter dispute with the Mitte Foundation, a nonprofit investor in World Class projects. That case, along with other litigation and financial distress, have steadily pushed marquee sites out of the firm\u2019s control.\nThe 0.9-acre site at 99 Trinity is currently home to a low-slung sheet metal warehouse which sits next to a Four Seasons Hotel, the\nWaterline\ntower and the massive redevelopment of Austin\u2019s convention center across the street. The property carries a base floor-area ratio of 10-to-1, with a pathway to 25-to-1 and no height limit, according to JLL \u2014 and it sits outside Capitol View Corridors. World Class once floated a 39-story apartment tower there, but it never materialized.\nThe Colorado Street assemblage totals about 1.2 acres on the same block as the 683-foot Austonian. While a sliver of the parking lot falls within a Capitol View Corridor, the rest of the site allows substantial density through Austin\u2019s Downtown Density Bonus Program.\nDowntown height is currently capped at 350 feet under a temporary city ordinance, though developers can exceed it with council approval. City leaders are expected to clarify permanent height rules later this spring.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The Partnership for New York City\u2019s new CEO says he relates to Mayor Zohran Mamdani.\nLike Mamdani, Steve Fulop became a mayor in his 30s.\n\u201cI was elected as a mayor at 35 years old, trying to balance a political base that was pushing me to do certain things versus what I thought was in the best interest of Jersey City,\u201d Fulop said. \u201cI think he has to ultimately experience some of the give and take and grow.\u201d\nFulop was mayor of Jersey City for three terms, and unsuccessfully ran for New Jersey governor last year. The view from his office on the fifth floor of One Battery Park Plaza provides a reminder of his previous gig \u2014 Jersey City\u2019s skyline \u2014\u00a0as he embarks on his new role.\nAs head of the Partnership, he represents more than 300 businesses in the city. Members include some of the most prominent builders and owners in the city, such as Vornado Realty Trust, SL Green Realty, Tishman Speyer, Related Companies and Blackstone. To what extent Fulop will serve as a go-between for executives of such firms and the new mayor remains to be seen.\nDuring a recent interview, I asked Fulop about his relationship with Mamdani and what real estate issues are top of mind as he takes the helm at the Partnership. On the latter, he and the Partnership\u2019s board will be setting the organization\u2019s agenda this month. However, priorities include policies that make it easier for developers to build housing, property tax reform and public safety. He\u2019s not sure how vocal the Partnership will be on the mayor\u2019s pledge to freeze rents for stabilized apartments. It depends on how that promise plays out.\nYou said you plan to push a pro-growth, housing agenda. Have you spoken with Mayor Zohran Mamdani about this?\nThe housing conversation was more of a very\nsmall group of real estate executives\n. He has a lot of smart questions. He\u2019s very curious, and I think he\u2019s very committed to being an effective mayor. There\u2019s going to be a learning curve in the transition from being on [the] activist side to more of an elected official. He was [a state] Assembly person, but now he\u2019s a very prominent elected official. He has a base in that DSA that\u2019s very complicated, and I think it\u2019s not always in line with the realities of the world of being an effective executive, and I think that he\u2019s going to have to navigate that a little bit, and our role is to be helpful where he wants it.\nDoes that include conversations about the mayor\u2019s call to increase taxes?\nThe CEOs in the Partnership are responsible for billions upon billions of dollars in budgets, hundreds of thousands of employees. We want to be helpful. The public sector is most effective when they think about strategic partnerships with the private sector. It\u2019s on him whether he wants to be a part of that. I recognize that his base may not always appreciate that, but I think that part of the responsibility of being an effective mayor is recognizing that your base isn\u2019t always correct.\nWhat have you heard from your members?\nThere\u2019s a lot of nervousness. I think that nobody knows what a socialist mayor looks like. You haven\u2019t seen a socialist executive in any prominent role in decades. All of the DSA or socialist people that have been elected, up until now, are generally on the legislative side. That\u2019s a different type of person that can throw bombs from the outside with less accountability. It\u2019s a person that\u2019s not directly responsible for budgets. I think CEOs in the partnership are hopeful that things work out well, [but there\u2019s] a lot of anxiety about what this will ultimately be in six months, in a year.\nHave you heard from any developers in Jersey City since the new mayor took over?\nThey miss me. I mean, look, there\u2019s a lot of things that we started that are in queue. The hope is that the mayor continues the progress there. I think people there are nervous too, because he\u2019s made the real estate community out to be the villain. His campaign was about that, and I would hope that he would moderate now that he\u2019s won an election, but we\u2019ll see.\n[After this interview, Mayor James Solomon\nblamed\nFulop for leaving Jersey City with a $250 million budget deficit, saying his predecessor \u201csystematically prioritized short-term political gain over the City\u2019s long-term fiscal health.\u201d In a statement, Fulop disputed the claim and dismissed it as \u201cpolitical theater.\u201d]\nDo you think you\u2019ll go back into the public sector?\nNo, I think that in many ways, this job is a capstone, dream job. It has all the benefits [of] public service, without any of the downside. You\u2019re in a very polarized environment for elected officials. When you think about the benefits versus the cost to your personal life and your family, I don\u2019t know if the trade-off is worth it in today\u2019s world.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Who will run for Sen. Mike Gianaris\u2019 seat? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The city\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection\nposted on social media\nthat water usage dropped across the five boroughs during the Super Bowl\u2019s halftime show on Sunday. During the 15 minutes after the show concluded, the city saw a spike equivalent to 761,719 toilets flushing across the city.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 Department of Social Services Commissioner Molly Wasow Park, who was appointed by former Mayor Eric Adams in 2023, resigned on Monday,\nGothamist reports\n. Park told the news site that the uncertainty around whether the Mamdani administration would keep her on \u201chas been really taxing on the agency, on me and my family.\u201d She has not yet chosen when her last day on the job will be. Her resignation comes as the city is grappling with a rising number of deaths due to extremely cold temperatures. Since Jan. 24, 18 people have been found dead outside.\n\u2014 The state chapter of the Working Families Party has chosen not to choose. The party has opted to endorse a placeholder candidate for governor rather than back Gov. Kathy Hochul or Antonio Delgado in the primary,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. The placeholder will be replaced by whoever wins the Democratic nomination.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$20.8 million\nfor a penthouse at 201 East 74th Street. The Lenox Hill condominium unit is 5,300 square feet of new construction.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s\nBarbara Russo, Christopher Salierno, Elena Sarkissian and MariaElena Scotto have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$31.6 million\nfor 1220 Broadway. The NoMad commercial building has 58 units and is 75,500 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $29.8 million for a penthouse at 383 West Broadway. The Soho co-op unit is 7,500 square feet.\nReserve Partners\u2019\nTrish Riedel and Jonathan Isaacs have the listing.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "A pair of developers scored a $60 million loan to build a condo building in Miami, as construction financing flows for South Florida residential projects amid higher interest rates.\nAscendra Capital and BAM Development scored the loan for their planned eight-story, 117-unit Seventeen Gables Condominium at 1715 Southwest 27th Avenue/Douglas Road, according to the lender\u2019s news release. Dwight Mortgage Trust provided the debt.\nIsaac Filler and Steve Edelstein were part of the Filler Capital team that represented the borrowers. David Scheer and Alex Izso of Dwight Mortgage originated the loan.\nConstruction is expected to start immediately, with completion slated for next year, the release says. The building will consist of one- to three-bedroom condo units, 178 parking spaces and 2,000 square feet of ground-floor retail.\nSales are expected to commence once construction commences, with asking prices starting under $700,000, according to the release. Tensie Forry of Cervera Real Estate is leading sales.\nAn entity led by Mayer Berkovits of BAM paid $14.3 million for the 0.9-acre development site in 2023, assuming the seller\u2019s $4 million loan on the property and bumping it to $8.5 million, with S III Capital Partners as the lender, records show. That debt was reassigned to S III SB Real Estate Credit A, with Dwight Mortgage assuming the debt this month and bumping it up to $60 million, according to records.\nDwight Mortgage Trust is a real estate investment trust and affiliate of New York-based Dwight Capital.\nThe planned Seventeen Gables Condominium marks a change of plans for the site. BAM had planned an\neight-story, 120-unit\napartment building, Mayer Berkovits told\nThe Real Deal\nat the time of its site purchase.\nAscendra Capital is led by David Steinberg.\nDevelopers have jumped on the area, which is close to Coral Gables, with plans for high-end condos.\nLast month, Allen Morris Company secured a\n$132.5 million\nconstruction loan for its long-planned 11-story, 58-unit Ponce Park condo development at 3000 Ponce de Leon Boulevard in Coral Gables. Raimundo Onetto\u2019s Alta Developers is developing the 174-unit Cassia \u2013 The Residences at Coral Gables in Coral Gables at 4011 Salzedo Street, scoring a\n$94.2 million\nconstruction loan in May.\nLast year, Constellation Group and Boschetti Group switched their planned apartment project in Coral Gables to condos. They launched sales of the 13-story, 74-unit\nCora\nfor 4241 Aurora Street, with asking prices starting at $950,000.\n",

Records show MacNeil bought the mansion at 1940 South Ocean Boulevard from Frank and Dolores Mennella.\nPhilip Lyle Smith and Carla Ferreira-Smith with Luxury Resort Portfolio had the listing, and Margit Brandt with Premier Estate Properties brought the buyer.\nMacNeil has a net worth of $4 billion, according to Forbes. In January, President Donald Trump tapped him to serve on the Federal Trade Commission, and his appointment is awaiting confirmation. He also owns a car collection worth $400 million, Forbes\nreported\n.\nMacNeil has been on a South Florida real estate spending spree in recent years. Last year, he bought the 1.6-acre estate at 1140 South Ocean Boulevard for\n$55.5 million\n. It is adjacent to the 2-acre compound at 1120 South Ocean Boulevard he bought for\n$38.5 million\nin 2024.\nMacNeil also owns a half-acre waterfront compound in Fort Lauderdale which he bought for $5.5 million in 2013, records show. It is on the market asking $40 million, Zillow shows.\nThe Mennellases bought the 1.9-acre ocean-to-Intracoastal estate at 1940 South Ocean Boulevard for $7.5 million in 2018. They built the 10,500-square-foot mansion in 2022, and it has six bedrooms, nine bathrooms, four half-bathrooms, a gym, spa facilities, a theater, game room, craft room, two bowling alleys, a dock and a\ntunnel to the beach\n.\nThey listed it for\n$84.9 million\nin May, shortly after spending\na record $48 million\non a mansion in Jupiter\u2019s Bear\u2019s Club. In 2023, they sold another oceanfront Manalapan mansion for\n$48.4 million\n.\nThe Mennellases\u2019 and MacNeils\u2019 recent real estate activity in Manalapan is a window into the rapid ascension of the small town amongst South Florida\u2019s top luxury markets.\nAgents say buyers see Manalapan as an appealing alternative to nearby Palm Beach\n. Manalapan has an abundance of oceanfront estates that also have dockage on the Intracoastal Waterway, and at lower prices than in Palm Beach.\nBillionaire Randal Kirk\nrecently found a buyer for his oceanfront Manalapan mansion after dropping the price from $134 million to $90 million.",

        "content": "Data centers may no longer be coming to a town near New Yorkers if a pair of state legislators get their way.\nState Sen. Liz Krueger and Assembly member Anna Kelles introduced a bill that would create a three-year moratorium on data center development in the state, Wired\nreported\n. It\u2019s one of a half-dozen states to recently announce a measure to combat the proliferation of the industrial real estate sector.\n\u201cDemocrats and Republicans are moving forward with exactly these kinds of moratoriums,\u201d Krueger said in a press conference. \u201cNew York should be in the front of the line to get this done.\u201d\nThe moratorium would see the cessation of permits issued for data center projects while the Department of Environmental Conservation and the Public Service Commission work on reports assessing data center impacts and suggesting regulations.\nData center development has become a significant boon for the real estate industry, as big technology players increasingly seek out more computing power, particularly for artificial intelligence use. FMI Corporation\nrecently forecasted\na 23 percent uptick in data\u2011center construction spending this year, pushing the sector to more than 6 percent of all nonresidential building activity \u2014 up sharply from 2 percent in 2023.\nBut the developments are also fraught with controversy, especially environmental concerns and worries about impact on the grid.\nNew York is home to more than 130 data centers. Several projects are in the works, including a 450-megawatt development in Ithaca. There\u2019s at least 10 gigawatts of electricity demand waiting to be connected to the grid.\nGov. Kathy Hochul recently launched an initiative to insulate ratepayers from high energy costs, demanding data center developers \u201cpay their fair share.\u201d\nAmong those calling for a national moratorium on such projects is Sen. Bernie Sanders. Food and Water Watch also gathered hundreds of environmental groups to press for a national moratorium.\nOther states where\ndata center moratoriums\nare under consideration include Georgia, Maryland, Oklahoma, Vermont and Virginia; the latter is one of the biggest hubs of data centers in the country.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The 3,500-square-foot unit sold for $4,005 per square foot to mark the priciest condo trade in Los Angeles County that year.\n\u201cThe current ownership had a clear vision of what they wanted the property to be,\u201d said Mike Leipart, co-founder and managing principal of Redeavor, the firm handling sales for the condos. \u201cMaking this change to Sun Rose, changing the programming and physical changes we\u2019ve made in the interim, we clearly believe that it\u2019s going to be a real shot in the arm for these units.\u201d\nThe former Pendry Residences, which were attached to a 149-key hotel, was constructed by AECOM Capital and Combined Properties for more than $500 million in 2021. The two struggled to pay off the\ndebt tied to the property\nas reported by\nThe Real Deal\nin 2024, paving the way for\nMonarch Alternative Capital\nto take a stake in the limited liability company controlling the property. Monarch held a $165 million mezzanine loan on the former Pendry.\nSince the ownership change, furnishings along with events and recreational programming have been revitalized to fit what Leipart called the Sun Rose\u2019s \u201clifestyle destination.\u201d\nAs a result, Leipart expects the rest of the property\u2019s condos to be sold by year\u2019s end.\nThe remaining units are priced from $4.3 million to $8 million and start at 3,010 square feet of interior space and go up to 4,656 square feet. The units\u2019 exterior spaces range from 1,086 square feet to 2,732 square feet.\nRedeavor is handling sales, picking up from when The Agency Development Group had previously been marketing the property. The same individuals at The Agency that handled sales for what was then the Pendry were also behind last year\u2019s\nlaunch of Redeavor\n.\nThe firm was started by a consortium of heavyweights in new development. That included Leipart, who founded The Agency Development Group; Andrew Wachtfogel, the co-founder and former president of new development at Official; Shane Farkas, former COO and CTO at The Agency; and Wade Hundley,\nFormida Capital\nCEO and former ST Residential CEO.\n",

        "content": "Peter Palandjian paired with David Carlins\u2019 development giant Magellan to snag the biggest multifamily prize in Chicago so far this year.\nA joint venture of Boston-based investment firm Intercontinental Real Estate, whose CEO is Palandjian, and Chicago-based Magellan paid $126 million late last month for the 42-story, 322-unit apartment tower at\n73 East Lake Street\nin the Loop area, public records show. The seller was Tony Rossi and Tom Moran\u2019s Chicago-based firm, M&amp;R Development, which completed the building in 2014 in partnership with UBS Realty Investment.\nAt roughly $380,000 per unit, the acquisition sets a new high-water mark for 2026. The transaction narrowly bested the year\u2019s previous top trade: the $110 million sale of an apartment complex in Chicago\u2019s southwest suburbs that closed in recent weeks.\nThe Chicago sale also marks the city\u2019s largest in terms of total price since\nAMLI Residential\u2019s $134 million purchase\nof the 275-unit Milieu apartment tower in the West Loop late last year. It\u2019s well shy of\n2025\u2019s priciest multifamily sale of $175 million\nfor the 398-unit North Water Apartments in November, which marked the biggest deal in the sector since 2023.\nIntercontinental\u2019s purchase marks a significant institutional return for the firm, which has been largely quiet in downtown Chicago since buying the office redevelopment at\n811 West Fulton Market\nfrom Shapack Partners and Alec Litowitz for $50.3 million in 2019, a record price per square foot for the city\u2019s office market at the time.\nIntercontinental, Magellan and seller M&amp;R didn\u2019t immediately return requests for comment Tuesday.\nFor M&amp;R Development, the sale represents an exit from a property it held for over a decade in tandem with UBS, which bankrolled the cost of construction. UBS provided a nearly $76 million mortgage for the property\u2019s construction in 2012. Details on the property\u2019s financing since then aren\u2019t clear from public records.\nThe sellers originally explored the market with a listing in 2024, but the apartment building never sold. They re-listed the tower with a CBRE team of John Jaeger, Justin Puppi and Jason Zyck in 2025, betting on Chicago\u2019s robust rent growth and a thinning development pipeline. Peter Marino of CBRE arranged financing for Intercontinental and Magellan\u2019s transaction, though further details of the loan weren\u2019t publicly available Tuesday.\nM&amp;R\u2019s principals are veterans of Chicago\u2019s multifamily market, with Rossi serving as president of RMK Management, a property manager with a portfolio of thousands of apartments it operates for landlords in Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota. M&amp;R also built the Addison &amp; Clark apartment and retail complex across the street from Wrigley Field on the city\u2019s North Side. Yet, the firm\u2019s partnership with\nUBS on that development lost most of its equity in a $100 million sale\nin 2023.\nThe Lake Street tower, just west of Millennium Park, is known for its high-end finishes and amenities. The building features an indoor pool, a two-story fitness center and the \u201cClub 73\u201d sky lounge on the 42nd floor. Its mix of convertible, one-, and two-bedroom units were 94 percent leased at the time it hit the market.\nThe investment comes as Chicago\u2019s apartment market cements its status as a national leader. While Sun Belt metros are currently drowning in a glut of new supply, Chicago\u2019s development pipeline has effectively run dry. Construction starts across the metro have plummeted to their\nlowest levels since 2012\n, with fewer than 4,000 units projected for completion this year, according to Marcus &amp; Millichap.\n\u201dOver the next 12 -24 months, we expect the absolute number of vacant units downtown to be at the lowest levels in over a decade, in spite of the total number of units having virtually doubled since 2015,\u201d Chicago-based research firm Integra Realty Resources said in its annual report last month. \u201cRents are poised to spike given nominal new supply.\u201d\nThis supply-side drought has given existing premium buildings like the one at 73 East Lake Street a near-monopoly on high-end demand. With so little new product slated to hit the market in the coming years, stabilized Class A towers are seeing outsized rent appreciation, while competitors in overbuilt markets elsewhere are forced into concession wars \u2014 such as offering several months of free rent to new tenants \u2014 to keep units filled. As the largest trade of 2026, the $126 million deal is a flashing signal that institutional giants are finally ready to bet big on the Windy City\u2019s scarcity play.\n",

        "content": "A new bill proposed in the California state legislature could loosen the\nCalifornia Coastal Commission\n\u2019s grip on development in the state\u2019s densest coastal cities, clearing a faster path for housing, bike lanes and parking overhauls in transit-rich areas.\nOn Monday, California Assemblymember Rick Chavez Zbur, who represents a district stretching from Santa Monica to Griffith Park, introduced AB 1740, legislation that would allow certain coastal cities to bypass Coastal Commission approval for a wide range of housing and transportation projects, the Santa Monica Daily Press\nreported\n. The proposal is sponsored in part by the\nCity of Santa Monica\n.\nAB 1740 would carve out a new category of \u201curban multimodal communities\u201d where local governments, not the commission, would have primary authority in dictating development, according to the bill. Zbur argues that the system, while essential for preserving sensitive resources, has created bottlenecks in areas where projects pose little environmental risk and are essential to housing production goals.\n\u201cThe California Coastal Act is one of our state\u2019s most important environmental laws, and is critical to protecting coastal access and our treasured coastal resources,\u201d Zbur said. \u201cHowever, in urbanized communities with robust public transit, current Coastal Commission standards must be modernized to achieve the important goals of the Coastal Act.\u201d\nUnder AB 1740, qualifying cities could approve housing projects without Coastal Commission permits if the developments are located in areas already zoned for multifamily use and are not within 300 feet of beaches, wetlands or environmentally sensitive habitat areas.\nMixed-income\nprojects \u2014 defined as those dedicating at least 7 percent of units to extremely low-income residents, 10 percent to very low-income households or 13 percent to lower-income residents \u2014 would be exempt from commission review when located in multifamily-designated areas. Dense developments with 10 or fewer units on sites smaller than 1 acre would also qualify if developed at a minimum density of 10 units per acre.\nIn qualifying cities, local governments could also add bike lanes, bus lanes and other multimodal transportation improvements without California Coastal Commission approval. AB 1740 would allow changes to roadways, including removal or relocation of on-street parking to make space for\nbicycle\ninfrastructure. The bill would also allow for the installation of accessible walkways, pay stations, signage and electric vehicle chargers in public facilities without permit approval.\nState lawmakers will consider AB 1740 in the policy committee later in this legislative session.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Tom Souleles, a longtime dealmaker at Madison Dearborn Partners, didn\u2019t linger on the market when it came time to sell his Lincoln Park home.\nSouleles, vice chairman of the Chicago-based private equity firm, and his wife, Cia Souleles, sold their mansion at\n1964 North Burling Street\nfor the full $6.5 million asking price, closing Friday after just a week on the market last fall. The deal stands as the Chicago area\u2019s highest-priced home sale of the still-young year, according to Crain\u2019s which first\nreported\nthe sale.\nThe sale price for the five bedroom house equates to $956 per square foot. The couple bought the 6,800-square-foot house in 2002 after it was restored by developer\nFred Latsko\n, though the sale price wasn\u2019t disclosed in public records. They later acquired the adjacent lot, creating a 50-by-123-foot parcel that gives the home a lawn, patio, rooftop decks and room to entertain \u2014 nearly the size of a standard double lot.\nThe couple listed the property Sept. 8 and had it under contract by Sept. 15, a brisk timeline even by Lincoln Park standards. Souleles did not respond to a request for comment by the publication, nor did listing agents Colette Cachey Smithburg and Joelle Cachey Hayes of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate. The buyers, who are not yet identified in public records, were represented by Keith Brand of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Chicago.\nOnly one other Chicago home has traded above $5 million this year, a\nGold Coast\nmansion that sold for $5.1 million in January. Three additional sales have cleared $4 million, in Lincoln Park, Bannockburn and Burr Ridge.\nBuilt in 1883, the\nItalianate\nhome features a carved limestone facade and bracketed cornice typical of late 19th century Chicago homes. The interior blends restored or recreated vintage details with modern updates: a stone fireplace mantel, curved stair railings, herringbone wood floors and high ceilings with crown moldings, according to the publication. A penthouse-level entertaining space opens onto a rooftop deck, designed to stay visually discreet from the street, with additional outdoor space atop the garage and along the side yard.\nSouleles joined Madison Dearborn in 1995 and rose through the ranks, as the firm became one of the country\u2019s most influential private equity players. He and Tim Sullivan were named co-CEOs in 2023 before Souleles moved into the vice chairman role.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The City of Santa Clara approved the proposal in 2024. GI\u2019s plans for the other sites were not clear.\nCoreSite has not disclosed plans for the three buildings, including whether it hopes to follow through with GI Partners\u2019 proposal or convert the existing structures into data centers.\nData centers in Santa Clara County have been attracting investor interest as\nartificial intelligence increases its foothold\nin the Bay Area and beyond.\nIn November, Brookfield subsidiary Centersquare\nbought two adjacent data centers\nin Santa Clara from Menlo Equities for $97 million in cash, one at 4650 Old Ironsides Drive for $55 million and the other at 4700 Old Ironsides Drive for $42 million.\nA month prior, a Goodman Group affiliate\npurchased a site in north San Jose\nthat has been proposed for a data center.

        "content": "Citadel\u2019s Ken Griffin decided to take a 60 percent stake in the joint venture that will transform 350 Park Avenue.\nVornado Realty Trust\u2019s Michael Franco on Tuesday said that Griffin wanted to accelerate the deal timeline, which originally gave him until June 2030 to either take a 60 percent stake or purchase the site for $1.4 billion, meaning that Vornado and Rudin Management would not take part in the development.\nGriffin chose the former in December, and thanks to a few other amendments to a 2022 agreement, Vornado and Rudin will be able to acquire an interest between 23 percent and 40 percent in the joint venture by July (with Vornado\u2019s stake ranging between 21 and 36 percent). The previous terms called for Vornado to take a 36 percent interest, and Rudin 4 percent. Demolition for the project is slated to start in April to make way for a new 2 million-square-foot office tower.\n\u201cWe intend to be part of this project,\u201d Franco said during Vornado\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call on Tuesday.\nVornado executives also indicated that Citadel, the tower\u2019s anchor tenant, may take more space than the previously announced 850,000 square feet.\n\u201cThe Citadel team is still making up their mind as to what exactly their requirements are,\u201d Vornado CEO Steve Roth said in response to an analyst\u2019s question. Franco added that the company is seeing interest from companies with leases expected to expire between 2031 and\u00a0 2033 who are looking for as little as 50,000 square feet.\nThe partners filed\npermit applications\nfor the project late last year, after the City Council approved\nrezoning\nthe site.\nVornado executives also provided an update on other redevelopment projects. Last month, the real estate investment trust acquired 3 East 54th Street for\n$141 million\n, with plans to demolish the existing office building on the site. Roth said the REIT is considering options for the site, but noted that \u201cthe location is excellent for hotel, office and residential uses.\u201d Roth repeatedly said he is \u201cin love\u201d with 623 Fifth Avenue, an\noffice building\nit bought for $218 million last year. The company plans to reposition the building as the \u201c220 Central Park South of boutique office\u201d by the end of 2027.\nFunds from operations during the fourth quarter were $110.9 million, or 55 cents per share, compared to $122.2 million, or 61 cents per share, during the same period in 2024. For the year, FFO was $465 million, or $2.32 per share, up from 2024\u2019s $447 million, or $2.26 per share.\nRoth acknowledged that the REIT\u2019s stock price has been struggling, but said \u201cthere is a huge disconnect between our stock price and the value of our assets.\u201d One year ago, to the day, Vornado\u2019s stock price was about $42 per share, but it hasn\u2019t reached above $40 since October, and as of noon on Tuesday, was just below $32.\nThe REIT\u2019s board authorized a stock buyback in 2023 and repurchased nearly 1.5 million common shares in 2025 for $50.9 million, at an average price of $34.9 per share.\n\u201cI am certainly aware of the recent decline in our stock and, in fact, the decline in all real estate stocks,\u201d Roth said. \u201cIn our case, the decline was in the face of the best fundamentals in Manhattan in the last 20 years. While this most likely represents a great buying opportunity, we will proceed with care, looking over our shoulder.\u201d\nHe said if the disconnect continues, Vornado will \u201cbecome more aggressive.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Global law firm Linklaters is bulking up in Midtown.\nThe London-based firm is adding 48,000 square feet at Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s\n1290 Sixth Avenue\n,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned. Linklaters signed a 10-year lease for a portion of the building\u2019s 11th floor, bringing its total footprint at the tower to more than 150,000 square feet. The new lease is coterminous with the firm\u2019s existing deal at the property. The asking rent was $100 per square foot.\nJLL\u2019s Lisa Kiell represented Linklaters in the transaction, while Vornado was represented in-house by Edward Riguardi and Ryan Levy.\nLinklaters, which has offices across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Asia, is the latest tenant to bet on Midtown\u2019s flight-to-quality trend, which has helped drive leasing momentum to a six-year high. The firm has been expanding in New York and Washington, D.C. In October, it added 6,500 square feet on the 34th floor of 1290 Sixth.\nThe expansion comes after Vornado completed a major renovation at the 43-story Sixth Avenue tower, which was built in 1963. Upgrades include a revamped lobby, a new curtain wall and the addition of wellness-focused amenities aimed at keeping the building competitive with newer office developments.\nInvestment firm\nNeuberger Berman\nremains the building\u2019s anchor tenant, occupying roughly 400,000 square feet under a lease signed in 2015.\nThe ownership structure of 1290 Sixth Avenue is also notable. The Trump Organization owns a 30 percent stake in the property through a partnership agreement that restricts a sale until 2044. The building is among the assets in President Donald Trump\u2019s portfolio that could be affected by\na New York judge\u2019s ruling\ntied to allegations that Trump inflated his company\u2019s property values for financial gain.\nLinklaters\u2019 deal marks the latest lease signed at the building this year, following Oaktree Capital Management\u2019s 79,000-square-foot deal in January for the entire 12th floor.\nVornado and Linklaters declined to comment.\n",

        "content": "Kilroy Realty continued its portfolio modification at the end of 2025.\nThe Los Angeles-based real estate investment trust entered into an agreement to offload a three-building, roughly 430,000-square-foot office campus in San Diego\u2019s I-15 Corridor for $124.5 million. That deal closed last month and amounts to about $290 per square foot. The three properties at 13480, 13500 and 13520 Evening Creek Drive North were 57,100 and 74 percent occupied, respectively, per the company\u2019s latest annual filing. Kilroy will continue to dispose of millions of dollars worth of non-core real estate, the company said on Tuesday\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call.\nLed by\nAngela Aman\n, Kilroy purchased a four-building, 230,000-square-foot life sciences campus in San Diego for $192 million in Torrey Pines, a neighborhood between La Jolla, a life sciences hub, and Del Mar. The deal equated to $835 per square foot. Three of the four properties are 100 percent occupied, and one is 28 percent filled, per a financial filing. Aman called it a \u201cgenerational opportunity,\u201d on the earnings call, and said it strengthened the company\u2019s San Diego presence.\nThe moves echo earlier decisions to dump less occupied offices in less desirable spots such as\n501 Santa Monica\nor\nSunset Media Center\nin the heart of Hollywood \u2014 and purchase\nMaple Plaza\n, a campus in Beverly Hills, for $205 million or about $700 a foot. The Beverly Hills property continues to attract new and renewal leases, the company said.\nThe company\u2019s portfolio was about 82 occupied at year end, and Kilroy signed more than 2 million square feet of leases in 2025, its highest annual leasing volume since before the pandemic. But leases for about a million more square feet are set to expire. On a call last quarter, Aman said she mostly\nanticipates\n\u201cmove-outs,\u201d a point she reiterated on Tuesday\u2019s call. The company anticipates average full year occupancy at 76 percent to 78 percent, per its guidance.\nKilroy reported a net income of $12 million for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2025, compared to $60 million a year earlier. For the year ended December 2025, the real estate investment trust reported a net income of $276 million compared to $211 million through 2024.\n",
