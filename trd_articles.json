        "content": "After more than two years of vying for public support for its casino proposal, SL Green Realty is officially out of the running.\nCommunity Advisory Committees on Wednesday voted 4-2 to disapprove SL Green Realty\u2019s pitch for a $5.4 billion casino in Times Square.\nAfter the vote, SL Green CEO Marc Holliday asked if he could speak, but was told that the commission was not hearing public comment. Once the meeting was over, he stood up and chastised the committee members, aside from those appointed by the mayor and governor, who were the sole yes votes.\n\u201cWhat you did here today was a despicable display of cowardice, lack of leadership, lack of consideration for all the people who would benefit from this proposal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe met the standard, and then some.\u201d\nHe then quickly exited the meeting.\nThe no votes mean two Manhattan proposals remain. A CAC vote on Silverstein Properties\u2019 proposal is slated for later Wednesday.\n\nThe other Manhattan bid is Soloviev Group and Mohegan\u2019s $11 billion Freedom Plaza on Manhattan\u2019s East Side. The CAC tasked with reviewing that project is slated to vote on the proposal on Sept. 22. Five other bids also await CAC votes, which will determine if\nthe projects\nhead to the state Gaming Facility Location Board, which will award three casino licenses. The board is expected to do so by the end of the year.\nSL Green, which teamed up with Caesars Entertainment, Roc Nation and Live Nation, proposed converting its 2 million-square-foot office building at 1515 Broadway into a casino, 992-key hotel, restaurants and an entertainment venue.\nThe team also committed to $250 million in community investments, as well as allowing investors with as little as $500 to acquire equity in the project.\nSL Green\u2019s odds were lowered by the casino approval process itself. Members of the CAC were appointed by elected officials, including Sen. Liz Krueger, who made\nclear\nthat she did not support a casino in Manhattan. The project also faced fierce opposition from the Broadway League, an influential trade group that represents the city\u2019s theater industry, which argued that a casino would siphon from rather than complement Times Square businesses and entertainment venues.\nThe CACs that reviewed the remaining proposals must vote on their respective projects by Sept. 30.\nAhead of this key vote, some teams have continued to add perks to their proposals in an effort to make their projects more competitive. At its second public hearing, Soloviev increased the number of affordable housing units it will build from 513 to 600.\n",

Brookfield did not disclose the asking rent or length of the deal, but CoStar estimated asking rents at the property range from $88 to $108 per square foot.\nScotiabank is expected to relocate from another Brookfield property, 250 Vesey Street, to open an office in 2027. The fate of Scotiabank\u2019s 131,000 square feet at 250 Vesey, a lease that isn\u2019t set to expire until the end of 2032, is unclear.\nBrookfield was represented by an in-house team, as well as a CBRE team including Howard Fiddle, Peter Turchin and John Maher. CBRE\u2019s Michael Geoghegan, Ramneek Rikhy and Eric Thomas represented the tenant.\nHitting full occupancy represents a significant turnaround for a property mired in controversy less than a decade ago.\n\nBrookfield purchased the 99-year ground lease from Kushner Companies\nin a $1.3 billion deal in 2018\n, raising questions about whether\nJared Kushner leveraged foreign policy connections\nto secure a bailout of the property; the Qatari government holds investments with Brookfield.\nBrookfield spent $400 million rededeveloping and modernizing the 39-story, 1.25 million-square-foot property, putting on a new facade reclad with glass panels, along with an upgraded lobby, amenity space, elevators and improved infrastructure to significantly reduce the carbon footprint.\nIn May 2022, Australian financial services company Macquarie Group became the first tenant to sign on at the revamped property,\ntaking 250,000 square feet\n.

Jill Eber with the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker Realty represented both the buyer and the seller in the deal.\nThe sale marked\na price record for the neighborhood,\ntrumping\nBarstool Sports founder David Portnoy\u2019s\nprevious $14 million purchase as Morningside\u2019s most expensive home.\nSimkins is the son of the late Leon Simkins, the longtime president of their family\u2019s paper products giant Simkins Industries. The firm was known for pioneering the production of paperboard products. David Simkins\u2019 brother, Michael Simkins, heads Lion Development Group, is CEO of E11even Crypto and an owner of E11even Partners, which owns the nightclub, hotel and vodka brands of the same name. His projects in Miami include the 449-unit\nE11even Club Hotel &amp; Residences\nand 550-unit\nE11even Club Residences Beyond\n.\n\nEarlier this month, David Simkins sold his waterfront North Bay Village home for\n$13.5 million\n. He bought the 3,700-square-foot house for $3.1 million in 2016, according to property records.\nHis new Morningside pad, dubbed \u201cWhispering Pines,\u201d spans 0.9 acres, property records show. It was built in 1969, and the 3,900-square-foot home has four bedrooms, three bathrooms and two half-bathrooms, the listing shows. The estate also has a 140-year-old gazebo, a treehouse, a music studio, pool, dock and 125 feet of waterfront.\nWallack listed it for $20.9 million in May, according to Zillow.\nPrice growth has been near-universal in South Florida since the pandemic triggered a luxury market boom five years ago. The degree differs from neighborhood to neighborhood, though. Morningside\u2019s neighbor Bay Point saw\na record $85 million\nsale for a waterfront estate earlier this year.",

        "content": "Lefferts is kicking off sales for the third North Beach condo project in its pipeline, 72 Carlyle.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund-Gomes team is leading sales for the 20-story, 134-unit tower planned for 600 72nd Street in Miami Beach, according to a press release. Units will range from one to three bedrooms, with prices from $1.8 million to $10 million, the release shows.\nLefferts founder, Mendy Chudaitov, tapped Italian architect Piero Lissoni to design the tower. Amenities in the building will include a pool, fitness center, spa facilities, lounge, padel court, kids\u2019 room, and private beach club access through a partnership with the\nBoucher Brothers\n.\nMiami Beach-based Lefferts acquired the non-waterfront assemblage for a combined $14.3 million over two decades, records show.\nThe launch follows the completion of Lefferts\u2019 first North Beach condo project,\n72 Park\n, earlier this year. Closings for the 22-story, 206-unit short-term rental-friendly tower at 580 72nd Street \u2013\u2013 which is adjacent to the 72 Carlyle site \u2013\u2013 started in March. Lefferts also launched sales for its planned\nPalma Miami Beach Residences\nat 600 71st Street last year, with condo prices starting at $650,000. Cervera Real Estate is leading sales and marketing for the project, which is 40 percent presold, Chudaitov confirmed.\n\nChudaitov said his target demographics for 72 Carlyle are locals, out-of-state buyers from feeder markets like California and New York, and investors.\u00a0 The project is intended to provide \u201cobtainable luxury\u201d for buyers interested in proximity to the beach (which is five blocks away), he said, \u201cThe price point is really the sweet spot in this market.\u201d\nElliman\u2019s Fredrik Eklund said he also anticipates the project appealing to location-focused locals, rather than international buyers who are more drawn to branded residences and supertalls. Eklund says North Beach is in the early stages of a luxury evolution.\n\u201cThis is like NoHo 10 years ago I would say,\u201d he said, referencing the once-overlooked Manhattan neighborhood.\nIn 2017, Miami Beach residents voted to increase density for developments in North Beach, setting the stage for a new wave of investment in the neighborhood. Lefferts\u2019 completion of 72 Park marked the first new condominium in\nNorth Beach\nin five years.\nAside from Lefferts\u2019 projects, the rezoning spurred developments like Northlink Capital\u2019s planned\n7200 Collins\n. The 12-story, 222-unit project is slated for 7200 Collins Avenue, on the former site of Denny\u2019s. Sales launched for the non-waterfront short-term rental-friendly condos in April, with prices starting at $600,000. In March, Constellation Group, Boschetti Group and Vietmar landed a $42.3 million construction loan for their planned\nElla Miami Beach\n. The 10-story, 103-unit non-waterfront short-term rental-friendly condo project at 6940 Abbott Avenue has prices starting at $500,000.\nOther projects in North Beach\u2019s pipeline include the Meruelo family and Terra\u2019s planned 120-unit condo and 150-room hotel project at the 3.8-acre oceanfront\nDeauville Beach Resort\nat 6701 Collins Avenue. Witkoff Group has also joined Alex Blavatnik and Sandor Scher on their stalled\nOcean Terrace\nproject on the site spanning 7409 to 7449 Collins Avenue and 7400 to 7450 Ocean Terrace, which includes a 20-story, 75-unit luxury condo.",

The firm hasn\u2019t named specific properties, but noted at its first public hearing last month that it had identified 92 feasible sites and was planning to evaluate another 146.

The team indicated that because they were not given adequate time to consider the request, the vote should be postponed. A spokesperson for the team said the late request \u201ctaints the CAC process.\u201d Angel Vasquez, who was appointed to the CAC by Gov.

        "content": "The former Vornado leasing executive accused of stealing more than $9 million from the firm allegedly created fake brokerages and burner accounts to bill the REIT for phony services over a 15-year period, according to federal prosecutors.\nJared Solomon\nwas arrested in December and charged by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York with stealing $9.5 million from his employer. The feds do not identify the company, but sources told\nThe Real Deal\nthat it is Vornado Realty Trust.\nAccording to the prosecutors, Solomon defrauded the company by creating fake brokerage companies named Margoux Media and Cobalt Advisors, and then submitting invoices to Vornado for work he claimed the companies had performed.\n\u201cThe defendant carried out his fraud scheme by using fake commercial real estate agreements \u2014 mainly fake broker agreements, among other types of agreements \u2014 and fake invoices that called for Victim Company-1 to issue checks and wire payments to one of three purported real estate broker companies,\u201d prosecutors wrote in court papers.\nThe third company is an actual brokerage, though prosecutors said the firm had no knowledge that Solomon was submitting invoices in its name.\nOn several fake agreements, Solomon allegedly copied and pasted a signature he had access to from an executive who did a bona fide licensing agreement with Vornado in 2015, and then claimed the executive was the chief financial officer of the fictitious Margoux Media.\n\nSolomon allegedly used fake email addresses and burner phone numbers to communicate with higher-ups at Vornado who had concerns about the payments. After the company made a $1.4 million payment to the Margoux account in 2019, Solomon allegedly used the money to buy a pricey Manhattan home.\n\u201cOnly one week later, the defendant, in turn, wired that amount, plus nearly $1 million in additional fraud proceeds that the defendant had previously obtained from Victim Company-1, to a real estate attorney to finance part of the purchase of a $4 million apartment located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\nSolomon and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe Southern District attorney\u2019s office revealed the new details earlier this month when responding to Solomon\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss the charges\n. The prosecutors refuted his argument that the indictment was overly vague, stating that it met the required standard.\nProsecutors earlier this year told the judge overseeing the case that they had reached an agreement in principle for Solomon to change his not guilty plea. But since then, the defendant has changed attorneys and no formal agreement has been reached.\nIf found guilty, he faces up to 20 years in prison.\n",

        "content": "In the 1990s, fashion designers descended twice per year on Manhattan\u2019s Bryant Park to preview their upcoming collections to buyers and reporters in tents.\nIn the years since, New York Fashion Week has grown into an extensive public spectacle, staged against backdrops across the city with designers looking far and wide for backdrops to accentuate their seasonal visions.\nAlthough a runway show is often just a one-day affair, industry experts say the glitz and glamour of these events can bring visibility and cultural cache to a venue.\nThat\u2019s been the case for the Brooklyn Navy Yard, according to Joyce Duverce, senior vice president of impact and partnerships at the yard\u2019s development corporation.\nThe Navy Yard, which is 300 acres of industrial space, has hosted two fashion shows. In 2023, Bronx native Ralph Lauren turned a warehouse in the yard into a barn-style runway show, followed by a seated dinner under chandeliers (in attendance: JLo, Amanda Seyfried, Laura Dern, and Julianne Moore). In 2024, although not part of fashion week, Victoria\u2019s Secret hosted its runway show at the Yard\u2019s Duggal Greenhouse.\n\u201cIt brings the audience,\u201d Duverce said. \u201cWe have over 550 businesses here, but I don\u2019t think most people know that we have the capacity to host such large events.\u201d\nBeyond any promotion, big events have also helped bring business to the yard\u2019s tenants, including fabricators and lighting vendors, according to Duverce.\nAnd if a space is particularly noteworthy, an event can potentially lead to long-term leasing opportunities for a venue.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve definitely had people reach out to us directly after showing in a beautiful new space or a commercial building saying, \u2018Do you have the real estate agent to contact? Are they renting space in the building? Is there retail space available?\u2019\u201d said Robert Kalas, an executive producer at La Mode En Images, a production company.\nThe right fit\nNot every space can draw in fashion week clients for a runway show. First, there are basic conditions to be met.\n\u201cDesigners are always looking for a large space that\u2019s column-free, that no one has ever done a fashion show in before, that\u2019s located in Manhattan, that\u2019s ground floor with 800 amps, three-phase power,\u201d Kalas said.\nBeyond that, there\u2019s a drive for anything iconic to New York, anything industrial, and anything with views of the city. Some of the more offbeat fashion week venues have included the New York Public Library, the city\u2019s Surrogate\u2019s Court, and the NBA Player\u2019s Association practice facility.\nEvents have certainly shifted from just 34th Street, but still cluster in a handful of Manhattan neighborhoods \u2014 Soho, Chelsea, the Meatpacking District, the West Village and Tribeca \u2014 with an occasional foray out to Brooklyn. That\u2019s in part because shows are timed so closely together, leaving busy attendees with little time to travel.\n\nMoney to be made\nSome venues, like the Altman Building in Chelsea or 28 Liberty in the Financial District, run a year-round events business.\nFor those properties, fashion week brings significant exposure, letting patrons see the venue often in a new light. But the direct monetary impact of any single event may be limited. The Altman Building, where Sandy Liang and Private Policy have debuted their new work, charges a fixed rate for events, meaning no markup for fashion clients.\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s a celebration of life or a gala dinner, it really is the same price to host an event with us,\u201d said Ariel Swain, director of venue sales and marketing at the Altman Building. \u201cAny opportunity to showcase the space in a different light is an opportunity for us to have other events with the people who are in attendance.\u201d\nBut a business in short-term events can provide visibility and limit risk in an unpredictable real estate landscape, said Sara Altobelli, who runs marketing for Hush Venues.\nHush manages events at 28 Liberty\u2019s Halo space, where Carolina Herrera and Sandy Liang have both had models walk the runway, circling the venue\u2019s 1964 Noguchi sculpture garden. Hush partners exclusively with venues and then runs all the events in a space.\n\u201cFashion Week gets a lot of press and attention,\u201d Altobelli said. \u201cFrom a cultural aspect, it\u2019s an incredible angle to be part of this very New York thing that is Fashion Week.\u201d\nIf done right, the result can also be profitable. Karrie Goldberg, founder and CEO at The Kagency, partners directly with property owners and developers to score a calendar of shorter-term events, including runway shows. For the right venue, such a business can net up to three times the profits of a traditional retail lease, she said.\n\u201cIf you look at a 10,000-square-foot space that is fully finished \u2014 as in, it could be a raw space but you have all the base amenities \u2014 you could be paying anywhere from\n20 to 25 grand\nfor the day,\u201d she said.\nSome developers, Goldberg said, are happy to run that business year-round. But others use her agency to monetize time between more traditional tenants, giving access to their space for just 90 days.\nThough fashion houses occasionally reach out directly, much of the business is through public relations or production companies. The Kagency manages bookings for more than 500 venues across multiple cities and has run shows with multiple fashion clients, including Proenza Schouler at the Chelsea Factory, and Ulla Johnson at Powerhouse Arts, a former power plant in Gowanus.\nAlthough the marketing potential from a runway show can last, the show itself is fleeting.\n\u201cThe show is 15 minutes and then everything gets taken down,\u201d Altobelli said. \u201cIt all happens in a New York minute, and then it all goes away.\u201d\n",

Atlanta-based Acre and Farmingdale-based Nord Development Group are the partners behind the project at 214 West Main Street.\nBank OZK led the way with a $95 million construction loan, while PGIM picked up the slack with $19.2 million in mezzanine debt.

        "content": "Developer Michael Shvo is considering dumping the remaining units at his Mandarin Oriental Residences.\nShvo and the other investors behind the project at 685 Fifth Avenue, which includes Deutsche Finance America and German pension fund Bayerische Versorgungskammer, hired Eastdil Secured to find a buyer for the unsold condos in a bulk deal, sources familiar with the matter told\nBloomberg\n.\nA bulk sale would end the developers\u2019\nfour-year struggle\nto offload condos at the Midtown property, where fewer than one-third of its 65 units have traded so far. The developers tapped Douglas Elliman to head sales at the project, though listings for the remaining sponsor units are no longer available on Streeteasy.\nNews of the plans for a bulk deal comes about a year after the developers scored a\n$120 million\ninventory loan from the Northwind Group. At the time, only 15 condos had sold at the project, which had a projected sellout of $340 million.\nA spokesperson for Shvo confirmed to\nThe Real Deal\nthat the investor group was mulling over a potential sale, following a\nsimilar strategy\nit employed at the Mandarin Oriental in Beverly Hills. Last year, the partnership sold 44 sponsor units at the project to Centurion Real Estate Partners after defaulting on a $200 million loan.\nIn a statement, Shvo\u2019s spokesperson pointed to the partnership\u2019s shift from focusing on residential development to office projects. \u201cWe are continuing to execute on that strategy with the potential bulk sale of remaining units at 685 5th Avenue,\u201d the spokesperson said. Shvo, however,\nrecently sold\none of his planned mixed-use projects on Alton Road in Miami Beach to Infinity. The spokesperson added that the firm has invested $250 million in its office portfolio.\n\nSpokespeople for Eastdil and BVK declined Bloomberg\u2019s request for comment. A spokesperson for Deutsche Finance America did not immediately respond to the outlet\u2019s request.\nShvo and his partners bought 685 Fifth, formerly known as the Gucci building, for $135 million in 2018, three years after Shvo\u2019s first bid to buy the building fell through. The developers converted the office portion of the building into condos and added five floors of residences.\nSince sales of the fully-furnished units launched in December 2021, some units have traded for steep discounts, including a 3,400-square-foot apartment that sold last October for\n$17 million\n\u2014 significantly less than its last asking price of $22 million.\nBuyers at the Mandarin Oriental sued the development group and Shvo last year over allegations that construction on their $6 million one-bedroom condo did not line up with agreed-upon plans. A New York judge\ndismissed Shvo\nas an individual defendant in the suit, though the case is still pending.\nShvo has also been locked in a legal battle with the Core Club, a tenant at his 711 Fifth Avenue office building. The developer is in the\nprocess of evicting\nthe private members club, which sued him last year for $600 million. Last month, a New York judge ruled that the Core Club\nowed Shvo\n$1 million for defaulting on a loan.\n\u2014\nSheridan Wall\n",

        "content": "The Pierre has long stood as one of Manhattan\u2019s most gilded properties, a Versailles-inspired tower overlooking Central Park that housed everyone from Elizabeth Taylor to Coco Chanel.\nBut today, its aging elevators, shabby lobby and thinning roster of power players have set the stage for a bitter fight over its future \u2014 and at the center of it is Howard Lutnick.\nThe billionaire bond trader-turned-Trump Commerce Secretary owns the Pierre\u2019s penthouse, the building\u2019s largest apartment, and, by extension, the most co-op shares. According to the\nNew York Times\n, Lutnick pushed for a management shakeup two years ago, which led the board to ultimately hire Lutnick\u2019s own firm, Newmark, to advise on upgrades.\nThat pivot has spiraled into late-stage talks to sell the entire property at 795 Fifth Avenue for\nroughly $2 billion\n. The prospective deal would involve funding from the Khashoggi family and management by the Dorchester Collection, owned by the sultan of Brunei.\nIf approved, the sale could force out famous residents, including former Disney chief Michael Eisner, designer Tory Burch and media heiress Shari Redstone. Older owners in their 80s and 90s are furious, arguing they\u2019ve poured fortunes into renovations only to face eviction.\n\u201cTo find new accommodations and go through the trauma\u2026 would seriously affect my health, well-being and finances,\u201d longtime resident Tina Beriro, 84, wrote in an email obtained by the Times.\n\nLutnick, who hasn\u2019t lived in the penthouse he\nbought for $44 million\nin 2017, is distancing himself. A spokesperson for his department said he hasn\u2019t been involved in discussions for months and disclosed his conflicts before stepping away when Trump tapped him for his administration post.\nStill, the perception lingers that Newmark \u2014 poised to reap tens of millions in fees \u2014 set the deal in motion with Lutnick\u2019s blessing.\nThe outcome rests with the co-op\u2019s shareholders. Any sale requires approval from two-thirds of its shares, meaning Lutnick\u2019s oversized stake could prove decisive.\nSupporters frame the choice as cashing out at a profitable value versus footing astronomical assessments for long-delayed repairs. Opponents fear the loss of their homes to foreign owners with controversial ties.\nThe building\u2019s annual meeting is scheduled this week in the Pierre\u2019s Cotillion ballroom, where tempers will likely be raw. For a building long synonymous with luxury, the fight may determine whether its next chapter is one of restoration or exile.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Ian Bruce Eichner unloaded a Crown Heights\ndevelopment site\nat the center of a fierce zoning fight over shadows on the nearby Brooklyn Botanic Garden.\nIsaac Schwartz snapped up 970 Franklin Avenue for $54.3 million from Eichner\u2019s Continuum Company, according to a press release from JLL. The site is approved for a 10-story building with 355 units, of which 106 must be income-restricted.\nJLL\u2019s Andrew Scandalios, Ethan Stanton, Brendan Maddigan and Michael Mazzara arranged the sale.\nThe deal closes a tumultuous chapter for Continuum, which spent six years trying to push through rezonings that would have allowed larger multifamily projects on the site. The City Planning Commission scaled back Eichner\u2019s proposal to reduce shadows on the Garden.\nIn exchange for lower building heights, Council member Crystal Hudson let Continuum use the \u201cworkforce housing\u201d option in the city\u2019s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program, which allowed for higher rents. Continuum also reduced the project\u2019s slope from its initial proposal, allowing more sunlight to reach the Garden\u2019s plant nursery and other areas. The Council approved the rezoning in November.\n\nThe road to consensus was long and rough. Eichner bought the site in 2017 for $33 million and had sought to build two 39-story towers with more than 1,500 apartments on a site that also included 960 Franklin Avenue. Roughly half of the units would have been set aside as affordable.\nThat bid never made it far, largely because of opposition from the Garden. The 960 Franklin site was then\nsold for $43 million\nin 2022 to Isaac Hager and Daryl Hagler, who in turn\nsold it to another developer\n, Yitzchok Schwartz, for\n$64 million\n. Schwartz plans 300 condo units across seven stories and 240,000 square feet, which he can build without political approval. (It\u2019s unclear whether Isaac Schwartz, who bought the adjacent 970 Franklin, is the same as this Yitzchok Shwartz, given Yitzchok is the Hebrew version of the name Isaac.)\nEichner pushed ahead with his remaining portion of the site and filed a new application to rezone it. The City Planning Commission shortened the towers to reduce the shadow impact to roughly half an hour per day, only to have Eichner deem that financially infeasible and\nthreaten to withdraw the application\n.\nBut he didn\u2019t, and now Schwartz will decide whether to proceed with Eichner\u2019s project. He could not immediately be reached for comment.\nA lawyer for Continuum declined to comment. Eichner did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Chikoo Patel is drowning in debt.\nAmerican Express is the latest among a slew of lenders going after the embattled Chicago landlord in Cook County court, citing an unpaid credit card balance of over $63,000 following a missed minimum payment earlier this summer, according to a lawsuit filed last week.\nIt\u2019s a small dollar figure compared to the scale of his real estate collapse, which so far includes about $20 million in alleged debts or broken contracts across Illinois. But the new lawsuit shows how deep of a financial hole Patel has dug along his journey from up-and-coming investor to embattled defendant.\nPatel\u2019s profile was rising for years as a landlord and large-scale property manager in Chicago\u2019s South Side apartment market. Through his company,\nCKO Real Estate\n, he acquired and took on management for dozens of rental buildings in neighborhoods like South Shore. He brought in outside investors to help bankroll acquisitions, promising steady returns, while positioning himself as a key player in affordable housing. For a while, the strategy worked, until tenants, and then lenders, began to see the cracks.\nNow, at least one of Patel\u2019s frequent investment partners,\nShai Wolkowicki\n, is distancing himself from the financial turmoil.\n\u201cWe have not been associated with Chikoo Patel or CKO Real Estate since the beginning of February, when we parted ways. We have had new management in place since that time,\u201d Wolkowicki said in an email. He didn\u2019t provide an interview or respond to follow-up questions about the path to recovery for his investments or the size of his and CKO\u2019s real estate portfolio.\nPatel didn\u2019t return multiple requests for an interview.\nBuildings under CKO\u2019s control deteriorated, and financial woes followed. Wolkowicki has been named a defendant along with Patel in a $16 million lawsuit brought by Old National Bank over a Springfield multifamily deal that has sunk into distress. Wolkowicki also took over decision-making authority from Patel for Rockford properties as they were sold off earlier this year, according to a person familiar with the transactions.\n\nAt CKO\u2019s Chicago buildings, maintenance requests went unanswered. Mold, pests, broken heating systems and unsafe stairwells became common complaints. This spring, tenants organized and took their fight public. South Shore renters pleaded with city officials to be released from their leases, saying they felt scammed out of rent and deposits while Patel\u2019s team ignored basic repairs. One resident\ntold\nBlock Club that living in a CKO building felt like being \u201ctrapped,\u201d with no way out short of legal intervention.\nThe city eventually stepped in. In April, Chicago officials sued the owners of a South Shore courtyard building formerly managed by CKO, citing hazardous, slum-like conditions that posed an \u201cimminent threat\u201d to tenants. The city sought a court-appointed receiver to take over management and make repairs at 6952-58 South Paxton Avenue, where residents had gone without heat and hot water after CKO shuttered operations. Patel was summoned to court alongside the property owners and lenders, though he\ntold\nthe Triibe he hadn\u2019t been associated with the buildings for \u201csome months.\u201d\nAs property conditions worsened, Patel\u2019s financial troubles multiplied. Lender Itria Ventures, which provides small-businesses capital in exchange for pledging their future revenues toward repayment, sued CKO and Patel earlier this year seeking over $115,000 in alleged debt that fell into default, according to documents obtained by\nThe Real Deal\n. CKO and its affiliates borrowed $150,000 a year ago in exchange for pledging to repay $192,000, but began missing payments by February, public records show.\nItria dismissed its lawsuit but appears to have plans to re-file it; an attorney for securitized mortgage lenders appeared in the case on behalf of entities that own property set to be seized from borrowers with ties to Patel. The loans on those properties, at 541 East 80th and 8100 South May streets in Chicago, totaled over $1 million and were originated by locally based lender\nRenovo Financial\n.\nThe revelations painted a picture of a multifamily operator stretched thin, using other people\u2019s money to chase scale without the capacity to deliver.\nBy late summer, some of Patel\u2019s investors and lenders joined the revolt. Last month\nThe Real Deal\nreported that unpaid debts and broken promises soured once-supportive financial backers. Some had put significant capital into Patel\u2019s ventures expecting reliable returns; instead, they ended up damaging a relationship with the Department of Housing and Urban Development and got left holding buildings that were bleeding cash, with tenants unwilling to pay rent under unlivable conditions.\nWhether buyers step in with the capital and competence to stabilize the properties remains an open question. For lenders and investors, the cautionary tale is clear: chasing yield through lightly capitalized operators can backfire spectacularly.\n",

        "content": "A builder in Hinsdale will forge ahead with plans to demolish a 19th-century house over the objection of the village\u2019s Board of Trustees after the board voted this week to reject his demolition and construction application.\nIt\u2019s the latest example of\nhistoric preservation running up against the demands\nof luxury buyers in the high-end Chicago suburb, where preservationists have worked to keep historic and architecturally unique homes intact.\nThe house at 142 East First Street is alternatively called \u201cThe Hallmark House,\u201d because it was featured in Hallmark commercials in the 1970s, and the William Whitney House. It was built in 1869 and owned by William H. Whitney, an Illinois state representative who was responsible for Hinsdale\u2019s incorporation as a village in 1873.\nThe seven-member village board voted unanimously to deny the application to demolish the house and construct a new one on Tuesday. Hinsdale\u2019s historic preservation rules require homeowners to seek approval before tearing down or altering buildings in historic districts, but unless the property is designated as a landmark, its decisions are nonbinding. So the owner can continue with the development as long as it meets existing zoning rules.\nHinsdale\u2019s Historic Preservation Commission also unanimously rejected the application in an August meeting.\nRobert Cimala, president of Legacy Homes Cimala, which bought the property this year for $2.2 million, is planning a spec build on the site, intending to sell a new house in the $7 million range. The house was previously owned by the Grace Episcopal Church next door.\nCimala said he will continue with the demolition and construction plan, calling the Historic Preservation Commission\u2019s requests for remodeling the house unrealistic and criticizing the process required to begin construction.\n\u201cThey can\u2019t stop me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way this is set up, all that they can do is advise.\u201d\nThe home planned for the lot will be 6,840 square-feet, while the existing house is less than 4,000 square-feet. The planned house will have a four-car garage and rise four-and-a-half feet higher than the existing structure.\n\nCimala said demolition will begin sometime in the next few weeks and he expects construction to be finished next fall.\nCimala said he looked into remodeling the house when he first inspected it, and an architect told him it was not feasible. To renovate the house would require essentially tearing it down and rebuilding it, and the cost to renovate was unreasonable, he said. Members of a design review team in April suggested including the house\u2019s Italianate architecture in the design of the new house, but Cimala said there wasn\u2019t a market for that style.\n\u201cWhat they wanted me to do was basically tear down the house and build another one exactly like it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I told them I wasn\u2019t going to do that. That\u2019s not the style of home people want nowadays.\u201d\nBruce George, an architect with Charles Vincent George Architects, who is designing the new home, detailed the house\u2019s structural problems during Tuesday\u2019s meeting. He said he was involved in a remodeling of the house in 2005 through the church\u2019s maintenance committee. The church put $500,000 of work into the house, but he said a lot of things were left in poor shape because of the cost.\nThe house is part of the Robbins Park Historic District and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.\nFearing the loss of historic properties, Hinsdale created a\nHistoric Overlay District in 2022\nthat gave tax incentives to owners of historically significant homes who improved them while preserving traditional architecture instead of demolishing them.\nThe program has seen success, with about 100 homeowners applying for tax incentives to renovate their historic homes, Hinsdale Trustee Alexis Braden said. Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent Mimi Collins\nbought and renovated a historic house\non South Park Avenue that she sold for $6 million last year.\nIn the North Shore\u2019s Glencoe, another luxury market with a history of teardowns, city officials are considering\nsimilar incentives to preserve historic buildings\n.\nSome preservation activists want Hinsdale to have more power to block demolitions of historic places, though. Landmark Illinois urged the village trustees to give the application process teeth and make it binding, in a letter read into the record on Tuesday by Trustee Luke Stifflear.\n\u201cHinsdale has seen an increase in approved demolitions over the past several years, endangering the character of the Robbins Park National Registered Historic District,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThe Historic Preservation Commission of Hinsdale urgently needs to revisit the village regulations to make it more difficult for historic assets to be demolished.\u201d",

        "content": "Paramount Group, the office landlord and real estate investment trust that has become synonymous with San Francisco, is coming under new ownership.\nNew York City-based Rithm Capital won a bidding war for Paramount Group, beating out interested parties including investment firm Blackstone and\noffice owners SL Green Realty\nand Vornado Realty Trust, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. Rithm was founded under Fortress Investment Group in 2013.\nRithm bought Paramount for $1.6 billion,\naccording\nto the outlet. As of yesterday, Paramount had a market capitalization of $1.7 billion. Green Street analysts predict the deal could be about $2 billion.\nNew York-based\nParamount\nput San Francisco at the heart of its premium office portfolio two decades ago. But as the pandemic wrecked the office market in San Francisco, Paramount has struggled to maintain ownership of several properties.\nAt its peak before the pandemic, Paramount owned six properties in San Francisco spanning more than 4.3 million square feet,\naccording\nto the San Francisco Standard. Paramount owns more than a dozen office towers in New York and San Francisco, including One Market Plaza, One Front Street, and 300 Mission Street.\nMonths before the sale, Paramount had been working to improve its finances by selling off parts of its San Francisco portfolio.\n\nParamount sold a 25 percent equity interest in the 640,000-square-foot One Front Street office building in May. That deal was completed in exchange for $40.5 million of short-term, fixed-rate financing. At the time of the sale, the building was valued at $255 million \u2014 more than half the $521 million price Paramount paid for it in 2016.\nThat same month, Paramount sold the 770,000-square-foot Market Center office building to Flynn Properties, headed by local franchise operator Greg Flynn. The firm\npurchased\nthe remainder of Paramount\u2019s debt for $177 million, marking a 76 percent discount on the purchase price.\nLast year, Paramount agreed to pay its lenders $125 million in order to push the loan maturity on One Market Plaza, the largest of Paramount\u2019s San Francisco holdings, to 2028. At One Front Street and One Market Plaza, Paramount executives were in the process of adding amenities to keep tenants in its offices and attract new ones.\nGoogle, Visa and law firm Morgan Lewis are exiting One Market Plaza. Meanwhile, Paramount\u2019s 55 Second Street building is being marketed for sale by lenders.\nParamount\u2019s remaining San Francisco portfolio was approximately 75 percent leased at the end of the second quarter.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Austin\u2019s South MoPac corridor is defying the city\u2019s otherwise sagging office market with vacancy rates less than half of those downtown.\nThe area \u2014 stretching along\nMoPac Expressway\nfrom Lady Bird Lake to Hwy 290 \u2014 posted a 13.8 percent vacancy rate in the second quarter, down from 18.1 percent three months earlier, according to Aquila Commercial. The Austin Business Journal\nreported\nthat the rate is far below the metro\u2019s average vacancy of roughly 17 percent and a sharp contrast to submarkets like East Austin, where nearly half of office space is available.\nThe pull is a mix of location, pricing and convenience, Aquila said. Rents and operating expenses are cheaper than downtown, parking is free and plentiful, and tenants can still\nreach\nthe city\u2019s core in minutes. The corridor feels like a tight micromarket, with no new construction in the pipeline, Aquila Principal Taylor McHargue told the outlet.\nThat swing is helped by displaced tenants. Last year the city bought One and Two Barton Skyway, removing nearly 400,000 square feet of office space from the market to consolidate Austin city departments. Companies like JE Dunn Construction, which will relocate to a 25,000-square-foot office at Terrace 6 next year, have pushed into the corridor\u2019s already limited 3.3 million-square-foot inventory.\n\nHPI Real Estate, which owns and occupies space at Barton Oaks Plaza II and III, has seen demand rise. Managing director Casey Casper told the outlet that companies weighing downtown often\nopt\nfor South MoPac instead, citing easier commutes for employees living south and west of the city. Executives who reside along the corridor also tilt decisions in its favor.\nThe relative affordability is another edge.\nDiscounted\nrents, lower expenses and no parking charges have made the corridor more competitive at a time when cost-conscious tenants are balking at downtown\u2019s 28 percent vacancy, McHargue said.\nThat demand is colliding with limited supply, creating one of the few Austin submarkets trending toward high occupancy. Available space totaled about 450,000 square feet at the end of the second quarter, including sublease offerings, Aquila reported.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The money was intended to pay the board\u2019s ground rent, facilities fees and payments in lieu of taxes.\nBut Milford allegedly sent funds to the wrong bank account.\nSomeone posing as an employee of BPCA sent Milford an email to wire the funds to TD Bank instead of Bank of New York Mellon, the bank that handled the board\u2019s account.\nThe email came from an email address of @bpca-ny.com as opposed to @bcpa-ny.gov.\n\nThe board alleges Milford performed \u201cno diligence and slavishly obeyed the fraudster\u2019s new set of wire instructions, wiring away $1.3 million of the board\u2019s money to the cyber thieves without so much as a phone call confirmation from a known BPCA employee, email verification, or second thought,\u201d according to the complaint.\nThe board\u2019s funds never arrived at BPCA, resulting in a default. When the agency flagged the unpaid debt days later, the board alleges in its lawsuit that Milford buried \u201cits head in the sand\u201d and neglected to inform the board about the issues.\nThe board says that Milford has neither reimbursed the funds nor settled the board\u2019s debts with BPCA. Residents now face unpaid bills with interest and penalties accruing, according to the lawsuit.\nThe board claims Milford failed to perform any internal or external cybersecurity audits or follow the recommendations of those audits.\n\u201cWith bank and wire fraud so prevalent, the Board reasonably expected Milford to maintain industry-standard safeguards to detect and prevent such schemes,\u201d said Terrence and Darren Oved of Oved &amp; Oved. \u201cMilford\u2019s failure to do so caused our client significant harm \u2014 a failure we are determined to rectify.\u201d\nMilford Entities owns three buildings in Battery Park City and manages six other buildings, collecting fees from over 2,000 units.\nMilford did not return a request to comment.\n",

The property would include units on the second through 21st floors.\nThe project filing also reveals a plan for 9,100 square feet of retail space on the ground floor. Residential amenities would include a party room, a gym, a spa, a sauna, a plunge pool, media rooms and coworking spaces.\nThe conversion is expected to carry a $41.7 million price tag. The architect of record is CetraRuddy Architecture.\n\u201cOur adaptive reuse project will serve as an important next chapter for a building the Rudin family developed more than 60 years ago, and add desperately needed new apartments to New York City\u2019s housing supply,\u201d a Rudin spokesperson told the Observer.\n\nThe conversion has been mooted at Rudin for years. As of early 2024, the 1963-built property had more than 100,000 square feet of available space and hasn\u2019t seen a lease signed in almost 24 months.\nThe firm\ndidn\u2019t immediately act\non its conversion plan because the project didn\u2019t pencil out, but the calculus changed with the City of Yes rezoning, which allowed for added floors.\nRudin is considering another conversion at 355 Lexington Avenue, where tenants have been put on alert for the possible loss of their offices. The Rudins also\nsold\n55 Broad Street to Silverstein Properties and Metro Loft Management for a residential conversion in July 2023.\nOver a year ago, the third generation of Rudins turned over day-to-day management of the company to Bill\u2019s kids, Samantha and Michael. They\u2019ve each been tasked with their own oversights, but are\nco-leading conversions\n.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Spies and Fasulo declined to comment.\nThe seller is a joint venture between Wiesbaden, Germany-based asset management firm Commerz Real AG, New York-based Tricap, led by David Edelstein, and New York-based RFR Holding, led by Aby Rosen. In 2015, the partnership acquired Atlas Plaza for $50 million, which includes the building immediately south at 135 and 137 Northeast 39th Street. Atlas Plaza was completed in 1969, and the adjacent building was built in 2015.\nSpokespersons for Commerz, Tricap and RFR declined to comment.\nMichael\u2019s Genuine, the flagship restaurant for chef Michael Schwartz, opened in Atlas Plaza in 2007. The plaza is fully leased, and other retail tenants include Longchamp and Oliver Peoples, an offering states.\n\nPonte Gadea bested offers from other potential buyers, including Tadashi Yanai, owner of Fast Retailing, the parent company for Uniqlo, sources said.\nThe partnership between Craig Robins\u2019 Miami-based Dacra, New York-based Brookfield Properties and Greenwich, Connecticut-based L Catterton that owns close to a half-million square feet of space in the Miami Design District also looked at Atlas Plaza, sources said. L Catterton is a subsidiary of French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton.\nWith a net worth pegged at nearly $125 billion, according to\nForbes\n, Ortega is currently the third richest person in the world.

Ponte Gadea is under contract to buy Sabadell Financial Center, a 30-story office tower in Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood, for\n$275 million\n.\nIn June, Ponte Gadea dropped\n$165 million\nfor Veneto Las Olas, a 44-story apartment tower with 259 units in Fort Lauderdale.

        "content": "Calvin Harris\nis taking his former financial adviser to court over an alleged real estate development scheme gone awry.\nThe Scottish DJ and producer filed an arbitration demand in\nLos Angeles Superior Court\nclaiming adviser\nThomas St. John\n\u201csystematically\u201d usurped their business relationship meant to invest millions in a Hollywood real estate development known as CMNTY Culture Campus, the New York Post\nreported\n.\nCMNTY Culture Campus was floated as a 460,000-square-foot complex with recording studios, artists\u2019 lounges and office space. The project began seeking investment from entertainers and financiers in 2021.\nSt. John allegedly looked to Harris for help when the project needed funds in 2023, according to the Post. Harris, operating through an entity called Lewis LLC, provided a $10 million loan and a $12.5 million equity stake in Hollywood LLC, the business structure behind the project.\nThose documents were \u201cmaterially misleading\u201d and Harris \u2014 government name Adam Wiles \u2014 received \u201cno context or information whatsoever\u201d about where his money was actually going, according to the Post. Soon after Harris forked over the cash, Harris alleges $11.7 million was transferred to Dun &amp; Dun LLC, a managing entity controlled by St. John.\n\u201cMr. Wiles has not received a single penny in return for that investment, and, indeed, respondents have not even started developing or building the project,\u201d the filing says, according to the Post. Lawyers for Harris went on to describe the deal as \u201cat best, a complete boondoggle, and, at worst, a complete fraud\u201d and noted that Harris received \u201cscant (and sometimes contradictory) information\u201d when asking for updates about the project.\nHarris\u2019 legal team alleges that the $10 million loan was due to be repaid with interest by Jan. 31 of this year but remains outstanding nearly nine months later, according to the Post. In the meantime, an agreement Harris secured via arbitration prevents project funds from being dissipated while the court proceedings are ongoing.\n\nLast year, the project at 6767 West Sunset Boulevard shifted its focus to residential housing, with the planned development comprising two towers with 750 units, including 90 set aside for low-income residents. The property would also feature retail and creative spaces.\nIn response to the legal action, a lawyer for St. John said Harris \u201cactively pursued this development opportunity,\u201d attorney Sasha Frid\ntold\nVariety.\n\u201cUnhappy with the pace of the project, he chose to pursue private arbitration to assert his discontent,\u201d Frid said. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that due to interest rates and other market factors real estate projects are taking longer to build. But the development is very much viable and expected to have a [more than] $900 million valuation when completed. Mr. St. John denies any wrongdoing.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

They secured an additional $40 million mortgage from Peruvian firm Core Capital, led by CEO Luis Marcelo Indacochea, the release shows.

It is a financing tool that encourages the use of energy efficient and sustainable materials and design.

        "content": "Altadena\u2019s path to recovery includes housing density, differing from Pacific Palisades in the wake of January\u2019s deadly wildfires.\nLos Angeles city officials are permitting the construction of duplexes on burned lots in Altadena, LAist\nreported\n.\nIn the Palisades, Mayor Karen Bass banned the application of Senate Bill 9, which allows homeowners in single-family zones to build a duplex or subdivide their lots into two smaller parcels. The law allows homeowners to build up to four homes on lots previously set aside for one.\nBass froze its use\nafter Gov. Gavin Newsom gave local leaders the greenlight to suspend the law in burn zones.\nSome residents in the wealthy enclave fear housing density would hurt the neighborhood vibe, cause too much traffic and possibly delay emergency services.\nBut in Altadena, which also has wealthy residents and a high cost of living, county officials are leaving the door open to housing density on single-family lots.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to disenfranchise anyone from the ability to rebuild,\u201d L.A. County Supervisor\nKathryn Barger\n, who represents Altadena, told the outlet. \u201cWe have the flexibility at the local level to address what SB 9 is doing without taking away local land rights.\u201d\nBarger opposed the state law for superseding local land-use decisions, but she sees financial opportunities for affected residents in Altadena, such as renting out secondary units, or allowing family members to live together in separate buildings on the same lot.\nThe law took effect in 2022, but homeowners rarely took advantage of it due to high costs and strict regulations on projects. Post fire, it\u2019s serving as a vehicle for rebuilding.\nLos Angeles County has received 26 applications seeking the density boost in the eight months since the fires, the outlet said. Before Bass brought the hammer down in the Palisades, seven such applications in that area had been submitted to the county.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Blackstone Group is threatening litigation against the owners of office floors above its Club Quarters hotel in a shared downtown Chicago tower should they proceed with a residential conversion.\nBlackstone, along with the lender foreclosing on the 429-key hotel at 105 West Adams Street, told city officials they\u2019ll sue if Primera Group moves forward with a $184 million office-to-residential conversion above the hotel, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The dispute surfaced at a Chicago City Hall hearing on whether to landmark the 41-story Art Deco tower, a key step in unlocking subsidies for the project to turn 29 floors of vacant Loop offices into apartments.\nThe hotel occupies floors three through 10. Blackstone and special servicer CWCapital Asset Management, argued an easement agreement bars either side from rezoning without consent. Their attorney warned landmarking and rezoning could \u201cinvite litigation\u201d that would stall the project further.\nA venture\nled\nby Gabriel Martinez\u2019s Chicago-based Primera Group and investor Marc Calabria bought floors 11 through 40 last year. The buyers paid $11 million, an anonymous source told the outlet. That would be $33 per square foot. They are seeking to\nturn\nthe office space into 400 apartments with the help of $68 million in TIF money through the LaSalle Street Reimagined program, which former Mayor Lori Lightfoot launched in 2022 to bring more foot traffic to the city\u2019s center post-pandemic.\nThe city tweaked its zoning rules in July to allow aldermen to back landmarked buildings for rezoning even if not all owners agree, a move Blackstone\u2019s lawyer blasted as designed to cut the hotel out. Primera\u2019s lawyers countered in a letter that the hotel owners had ample time to weigh in and have \u201crepeatedly failed to participate meaningfully.\u201d\n\nThe battle adds another layer of drama to one of the marquee projects in Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s push to revive LaSalle Street Reimagined. Six conversions have been greenlit by his administration, totaling more than 1,800 units and $317 million in subsidies. The Clark Adams Building plan is among the largest.\nThat conversion was already facing a separate $15 million lawsuit from developers Celadon Partners and Blackwood Group, who claim Primera and Calabria stole their proposal. Celadon and Blackwood contend their\nproposal\nthat was short-listed in 2023 bears too much resemblance to the Primera and Calabria plans. That plan\ncalled\nfor 247 residential units and sought $60 million in tax increment financing.\nThe building was previously owned by a venture led by Chicago investor Musa Tadros, who defaulted on a $29 million loan used to refinance it in 2016.\nOriginally called the Bankers Building, the 1927 Burnham-designed tower has cycled through various uses. Landmarking would unlock $24 million in historic tax credits and help finance the conversion alongside developer equity and $77 million in debt.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The University of Chicago leased more than 150,000 square feet, including space for the new UChicago Science Incubator. The lease is half the building and almost triple the amount of space it previously planned, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n. The incubator is a partnership between the university\u2019s Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation and life sciences venture capital firm Portal Innovations.\nDevelopers Beacon Hill Partners and Trammell Crow Company\nlaunched\nthe $225 million, 302,000-square-foot project two years ago. The property will have nine floors of labs, a roof terrace and 40,000 square feet of amenities.\nTrammell Crow has built two labs in Fulton Market in recent years and\nanother\nin Evanston.\nThe incubator is already home to more than a dozen startups spanning\nlife sciences\n, deep tech and quantum computing. They include memQ, spun out of UChicago and Argonne National Lab to develop quantum networking technology, and HaloGen, an MIT spinoff building batteries for medical devices.\n\nBy colocating startups with university researchers from the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering and Biological Sciences Division, UChicago aims to spark collaborations and accelerate commercialization.\nHyde Park Labs will also temporarily host IBM\u2019s next-generation quantum computer before it moves to the planned Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park on the former South Works steel site. Portal Innovations CEO John Flavin called the project a milestone for bridging academia and industry.\nBeyond the lab space, Hyde Park Labs is designed as a neighborhood anchor. It marks the second phase of Harper Court, the\nTrammell Crow\nand Beacon Capital\u2013led mixed-use development that debuted in 2013 with retail, offices and a Hyatt hotel. The building also houses the Southside STEM Station, which offers free science and tech programs for local educators, families and students.\nThe project adds value to the 53rd Street commercial corridor, where the Obama Foundation set up shop in 2016, and momentum to Hyde Park\u2019s broader shift from university enclave to mixed-use innovation district. UChicago President Paul Alivisatos said the building will \u201chelp energize the local economy,\u201d while Nadya Mason, dean of the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering, touted its role in bringing \u201can influx of people and activity\u201d to the South Side.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Houston real estate investor and reality TV personality Washington Ho is in the middle of a messy courtroom fight with the former CEO of his brokerage, White House Global Properties.\nChristy Huckaby, who was hired in January 2024 to run the firm, sued last September alleging Ho, current CEO Angelica Smart and the company lured her with false promises, failed to pay her salary, withheld commissions and damaged her reputation, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. She\u2019s seeking between $250,000 and $1 million in damages.\nHuckaby claims she was promised $10,000 a month for six months but received only $21,500, and that Ho and Smart withheld $170,000 in sales commissions. She also alleges she lost out on a nearly $276,000 commission tied to a $4.6 million listing for ex-Houston Rockets star Steve Francis, which she says Ho and Smart improperly took over.\nBeyond the money, Huckaby accuses the pair of defamation, making inappropriate sexual comments and dangling the prospect of a reality TV role \u2014 a spinoff of Ho\u2019s HBO Max show\n\u201cHouse of Ho\u201d\n\u2014 that never materialized.\nHo and Smart countersued, denying her claims and accusing Huckaby of breach of fiduciary duty. Their filing alleges Huckaby crippled the brokerage by taking 20 agents with her when she left, including her 13-person real estate team The Closers \u2014 Ho brought on her team along with the CEO hire \u2014 and by shutting down the firm\u2019s website. They also claim Huckaby attempted to blackmail them for $500,000 with what they described as damaging personal material.\n\nThe fallout extends beyond the principals. Nicole Lopez, White House\u2019s former COO, followed Huckaby out the door just two months into the job. Court documents show Huckaby released Lopez from a noncompete, enabling her move to Huckaby\u2019s team. Lopez has since joined Corcoran Genesis and previously told the outlet she left White House due to a \u201cvery chaotic environment.\u201d\nNeither Huckaby nor her attorney responded to requests from the outlet for comment. Ho declined to comment.\nHo launched White House with Smart in late 2023 after leaving eXp Realty, a move\ndue\nin part to disagreements over its commission structure. Ho pitched the firm as a new kind of brokerage with fair commissions and a focus on investment. Instead, less than a year later, it became entangled in dueling lawsuits with its founding leadership. A motion for a jury trial is set for October, where both sides are seeking damages.\nEarlier this year, the firm expanded\nbeyond\nHouston with a\nforay\ninto Austin, and announced plans to hire 30 to 50 agents over the next few years. The brokerage tends toward luxury listings, but it intends to represent all sectors of the Austin market, including lower-cost residential, commercial, industrial and development properties.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "And then there were six.\nTwo Manhattan casino proposals on Wednesday were eliminated from the state\u2019s casino licensing competition. Six others await votes that will determine if they compete in the final round.\nTwo Community Advisory Committees rejected\nSL Green Realty\nand\nSilverstein Properties\n\u2019 respective casino proposals, both with a vote of 4-2 against.\nAfter the vote, SL Green CEO Marc Holliday, who was seated in the front row, did not sashay away before taking a parting shot.\n\u201cWhat you did here today was a despicable display of cowardice, lack of leadership, lack of consideration for all the people who would benefit from this proposal,\u201d he said as the committee members exited the room.\n\u201cThe only one with courage to stand up was the governor and mayoral appointees, and everybody else runs and hides,\u201d he continued, referring to the sole yes votes.\n\u201cThe benefits you\u2019ve denied this community and this city and state, you have to live with that history forever,\u201d he said, before leaving.\nIt was a rare example of an emotional, in-the-moment reaction from a CEO whose statements usually get filtered through press relations. It is nice to have real-life humans react and comment on things! Sadly, I was turned down for a follow-up interview, but the casino team sent over a diplomatic statement lamenting all the benefits Times Square is losing without their casino.\nThis whole approval process is somewhat unusual. The state\u2019s Gaming Facility Location Board is supposed to assess the casino proposals based on several specific metrics. But the committees tasked with culling the competition were given much broader criteria for considering whether these proposals should even be presented to the board.\nThe CACs were instructed to \u201cissue a finding either establishing public support approving or disapproving the application.\u201d But there doesn\u2019t seem to be a uniform metric for establishing support or lack thereof, aside from the two public hearings held by each CAC on the casino proposals.\nI asked Assembly member Tony Simone if there was a consistent way of measuring public sentiment around these proposals.\n\u201cWe clearly look at the folks, the families who live in the district first. And overwhelmingly they were opposed to having these casinos in the district,\u201d he said.\nThe members of these CACs, however, voted pretty much as expected, based on the elected officials who appointed them. Does this mean the fates of the proposals were set from the beginning of the CAC process? We may never know. Elected officials would of course say no.\n\u201cThis is not a decision I took lightly,\u201d Council member Erik Bottcher said in a statement, referring to his decision to instruct his appointees to vote against both proposals. \u201cAll economic development opportunities deserve strong consideration.\u201d\nMore than a year before the vote, Simone, whose appointee Matthew Tighe sat on both the SL Green and Silverstein CACs, had said he was \u201c\nphilosophically opposed\n\u201d to a casino on Manhattan\u2019s west side, though he was referring to Related Companies\u2019 Hudson Yards proposal. Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Sen. Liz Krueger, who both appointed Richard Gottfried to represent them on the Silverstein and SL Green proposals, respectively, were also vocal about their opposition to casinos in Manhattan.\nBottcher and Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine opposed Related\u2019s casino plans, which the developer abandoned in May.\n\nAdding to the intrigue around this process: Silverstein Properties COO Dino Fusco said the CAC considering its application sent the casino team a last-minute (Tuesday night) request to add $1 billion worth of housing to their proposal. Unsurprisingly, Silverstein didn\u2019t agree to that \u2014 such a promise would have been dubious given the lack of time to figure out where this housing would go and how the firm would pay for it. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development apparently is responsible for this request, hoping that the CAC would delay the vote and give Silverstein more time to consider it, according to a source familiar with the talks. Simone indicated that such a promise likely wouldn\u2019t have swayed the CAC anyway.\nSome of the remaining proposals awaiting a CAC vote will need, to belabor the \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d references, to lip-sync for their lives. As today certainly proves, getting the necessary \u201cyes\u201d votes will be a challenge.\nLike the two rejected casinos, the remaining Manhattan proposal, pitched by Soloviev Group, is at the mercy of a CAC that includes members appointed by casino-naysayers. But when I spoke to Soloviev COO Michael Hershman last week, he said he was \u201cfeeling pretty positive\u201d about his team\u2019s chances. That vote is scheduled for Sept. 22, according to Hershman. The remaining votes have not yet been publicly announced.\n\u201cDespite the defeat today of two formidable applicants, we remain confident that one license should be awarded in Manhattan,\u201d Hershman said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cAttracting more tourists than any other borough, the city should have a fully integrated resort that is fitting of its position as the global capital of the world.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat will become of the SL Green and Silverstein properties now that the companies\u2019 casino dreams have been dashed? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Continuum sold its development site at 970 Franklin Avenue in Crown Heights for $54.3 million,\nmy colleague Elizabeth Cryan reports\n. The sale follows a tortuous rezoning fight over the site.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Zohran Mamdani and Brad Lander\u2019s cross endorsement during the mayoral primary was seen as a \u201cprogressive bromance\u201d, but behind the scenes, cracks are allegedly forming,\nGothamist\nreports. Lander had been signalling that he expected a top role in a potential Mamdani administration, but Mamdani shut down the speculation, telling Lander he had not yet made any personnel decisions.\n\u2014\u00a0A new City Council bill would ban fluoride in NYC\u2019s drinking water, a position aligned with U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement, according to\nCity and State\n. The bill\u2019s sponsor, Council member Jim Gennaro, said that while he\u2019s friends with RFK Jr., he did not suggest introducing the legislation.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$8.2 million\nfor a 3,038-square-foot townhouse at 262 West 12th Street in the West Village.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$19.6 million\nfor a portfolio of nine apartment buildings, including 632-644 Wales Avenue, 785-795 East 151st Street and 786-792 152nd Street in Woodstock. The portfolio included 209 residential units and is 163,428 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$21 million\nfor a 4,183-square-foot condominium unit at 111 West 57th Street in Midtown. Nikki Field and Benjamin Pofcher with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty have the listing.\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Lenders are continuing their legal assault on Charles Cohen\u2019s properties, now in Westchester.\nCohen\u2019s office campus in White Plains was hit with a foreclosure case last month, with the lender demanding $66 million. The billionaire was named as a defendant in the suit because he signed a guaranty agreement connected to the loan.\nCohen Brothers Realty Corp. bought the property at 333 Westchester Avenue in 1998 for $25 million, according to contemporary reporting from\nthe New York Times\n. In 2004, an entity connected to the company took out $77 million in loans for the property.\nCohen served as a limited guarantor on the loan, pledging to cover some of the borrower\u2019s obligations in the event of fraud, environmental issues or other negative conduct.\nThe borrower defaulted on the loan by failing to make monthly payments in the summer and fall of 2024, failing to pay off the loan by its November maturity debt, and letting about $1.4 million in utilities debt accrue, according to the complaint. Two of the commercial condos in the complex are occupied and together pay a total of about $32,200 per month, the lender alleges.\nThe plaintiff argues in the complaint that Cohen is liable for any loan principal that remains unpaid after a potential sale of the property, although it does not reference any events triggering Cohen\u2019s guaranty.\nDavid L\u00f3pez, general counsel for Cohen Brothers Realty, said no events have triggered the guaranty and the foreclosure is related to a maturity default.\n\n\u201cWe are in dialogue with the lender and continue working with the lender to either refinance or restructure the loan,\u201d L\u00f3pez said via email. \u201cWe are optimistic that this will be worked out in due course.\u201d\nThe property was originally constructed as the headquarters for General Foods Corp., according to the Cohen Brothers\u2019 Realty website. The 39-acre office campus is a five-minute drive from the White Plains Metro North station and has a fitness center, basketball court, volleyball court, and free shuttle to the train, according to the website.\nIt\u2019s one of several suits Cohen and his company are dealing with. In July, a lender won a summary judgement on Cohen Brothers\u2019 750 Lexington Avenue, sending the building to foreclosure.\nLender Fortress Credit Corp. is also agitating to collect $187 million from Cohen personally after a court entered a judgement against him last year. The fight has pushed Cohen to try to sell his buildings. Last month he closed on the sale of 623 Fifth Avenue to Vornado, resulting in a $30 million payment to Fortress, according to court documents.\nHe has also agreed to sell 3 East 54th Street for $188 million to an unnamed buyer, according to court documents.\nForbes has estimated Cohen\u2019s net worth at $1.6 billion, down from $3.7 billion at its peak.\n",

        "content": "District Brew Yards, the concept that gave multiple breweries a shared taproom and production facility, is headed for last call.\nOwner Steve Soble is prepared to close the Near West Side flagship at 417 North Ashland Avenue as well as a suburban outpost at 700 North Milwaukee Avenue in Wheeling. CBRE was tapped to market the 17,300-square-foot Chicago building and the 11,900-square-foot Wheeling property, which carry asking prices of $4.5 million and $3.6 million, respectively, CoStar\nreported\n. That\u2019s about $260 per square foot for the Chicago facility and $302 per square foot for the one in Wheeling.\nThe Chicago location, which opened in 2019, will stay open temporarily while CBRE fields offers. The Wheeling site, which debuted in 2022, will close Sept. 28. They are being pitched as turnkey opportunities for brewers or restaurateurs. However, the Ashland property, sitting near Fulton Market and the\nplanned\n$10 billion 1901 Project from the Bulls and Blackhawks owners, could be ripe for larger redevelopment.\nDistrict Brew Yards\u2019 exit is part of a broader shakeout in\ncraft beer\nnationally. For the first time since 2005, more breweries\nclosed\nthan\nopened\nin the U.S. last year, leaving 9,796 still operating, according to the Brewers Association. Chicago has seen its share of retrenchment: Metropolitan Brewing folded, Goose Island\nclosed\nits Clybourn brewpub in favor of an outpost at the Salt Shed, and Revolution Brewing consolidated into Avondale.\n\nSoble, 61, said after decades in food, beverage and brewing \u2014 including Burnt City Brewing, one of the four labels inside Brew Yards \u2014 he\u2019s ready to step aside.\n\u201cIt\u2019s either time to dig in and alter the concept or let someone younger step in,\u201d Soble told the outlet. \u201cWe see the writing on the wall that it\u2019s going to be difficult to continue to do this.\u201d\nOther breweries sharing the facilities include Around the Bend, Twisted Hippo and Casa Humilde. The model was born out of Soble\u2019s observation that food halls like Revival in the Loop had traction, but few existed for craft beer.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

That\u2019s what Liv Development has planned for McKinney, the site of its next North Texas apartment project.\nThe Birmingham, Alabama-based developer estimates the 205-unit apartment complex, named Livano McKinney, will cost $40 million, or about $195,000 per unit, according to a state filing that is subject to change. The developer aims to start construction in December and complete the project at the end of July 2027.\nThe 302,000-square-foot development, at the intersection of Alma Rd and Silverado Trail, will feature apartments and townhomes surrounding a clubhouse. The site is about 8 miles from downtown McKinney, a fast-growing suburb about 33 miles north of Dallas. Its population has increased almost 10 percent to 227,000 since 2020.\nMultifamily developers in North Texas have dramatically pulled back on apartment building since interest rates caused development costs to balloon, and a historic number of deliveries resulted in declining rental rates and occupancy levels\n\nDallas-Fort Worth rents decreased 1.5 percent over the 12 months ending in May, according to Yardi Matrix. The Metroplex\u2019s occupancy rate of 92.6 percent put it at third-lowest among the country\u2019s 30 largest cities.\nIndustry experts predict the slowdown in development will give the market some momentum and push rents into the black by the end of this year or next. Operators like Liv Development are planning to time project deliveries with that anticipated rent-rate upswing.\nRobb Crumpton founded Liv Development as Red Mountain Development in 2006. The company has three other Texas apartment buildings in its portfolio \u2014 Livano Kemah, at 800 FM 518 in Galveston County; Livano Pflugerville, at 3301 E.

In the spring of 2024, Moderno and another developer, Aventura-based 75Invest Group, were planning the development as a 27-story rental building with 290 apartments, including 71\nworkforce housing\nunits.\nThe developers also had previously planned to advance the larger version of the development under the state\u2019s\nLive Local Act\n, which allows municipal administrative approval of a multifamily development without a city commission review, if the development includes workforce or affordable housing units with below-market rents.\nThe Fort Lauderdale City Commission voted unanimously Tuesday night to approve the site plan for 26-story, 265-unit ArtHaus development.\nWhether 75Invest Group is developing ArtHaus together with Moderno Development Group is unclear. Neither company responded to requests for comment.\nModerno and Gaia Real Estate Holdings launched the first $150 million phase of a fund called\nMILAS\nto purchase and renovate or rebuild about 400 single-family homes and townhouses in Miami\u2019s urban core.\nThe firms plan to rent out the acquired properties for a monthly range of $4,000 to $7,000, focusing on areas with limited new supply. A second $150 million phase of the fund is planned for next year.",

        "content": "Barclays is the latest bank putting money where its mouth is to show bullishness on the Manhattan office market.\nThe company is preparing a massive overhaul of its regional headquarters at 745 Seventh Avenue in Times Square, Bloomberg\nreported\n. Construction is expected to begin in the middle of next year and wrap in 2030.\nThe project is in the design phase, but is expected to carry a price tag of at least $1 billion. Depending on the finalized designs, the redevelopment could grow even more expensive.\n\u201cOur new regional headquarters in New York is a bold investment we are making in the Americas,\u201d Barclays executive Richard Haworth said in a memo to staff. Chief Executive Officer CS Venkatakrishnan added that the firm\u2019s \u201cpresence in New York and the Americas is critical to the bank\u2019s strategy as the investment bank delivers on its ambitions.\u201d\nBarclays plans to update its trading floors, as well as the technology used by the 12,000 staffers who work at the New York HQ, mostly in the investment bank division. The renovation will also bring various amenities online, though specifics weren\u2019t disclosed.\n\nBarclays assumed control of the 1-million-square-foot, 32-story office tower after taking over Lehman Brothers\u2019 North American operations 17 years ago.\nBanks are leading the charge of revamping Manhattan\u2019s office environment. Citigroup completed what was then the largest private-sector single-occupant renovation in New York City\u2019s history in Tribeca in 2020.\nAnd employees recently began occupying JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n1,400-foot-tall behemoth\nat 270 Park Avenue, which is expected to ultimately house more than 14,000 employees.\nBanks aren\u2019t only about owning their spaces, either. In the spring, PNC Bank agreed to lease\n83,000 square feet\nat Sage Realty\u2019s 437 Madison Avenue in Midtown East. Pittsburgh-based PNC is relocating and expanding from its current 65,000-square-foot location a few blocks south at Barings\u2019 340 Madison Avenue.\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Eliazer Tauber had a no good, very bad summer.\nThe New York-based investor was recently hit with a second round of foreclosure filings against several multifamily properties he owns on Chicago\u2019s South Side. The new lawsuits bring the total number of Chicago real estate loan default complaints brought against him to 16 since June.\nThe filings come at a time when\nseveral other landlords\nacross Chicago\u2019s South and West side neighborhoods are facing foreclosures on multifamily properties that have been flipped multiple times in short succession.\nThe Real Deal\nreported on the first nine foreclosures against Tauber\nearlier this summer\n. All of the properties involved were purchased for far more than appraised values set by property tax officials.\nAmong the latest batch of filings is a $1 million foreclosure of a 9-unit property at 1003 West 58th Street that sheds new light on Tauber\u2019s involvement with\nembattled attorney Mark Nussbaum\n.\nMap of Chicago Foreclosures against Eliazer Tauber\nNussbaum, who shut down his law firm in January, is under indictment in New York for grand larceny for allegedly bilking investors out of at least $15 million in escrow deposits. Nussbaum has pleaded not guilty.\nHe and Tauber secured a $1 million loan on the West 58th Street property even though it was worth just $400,000 three years ago and hasn\u2019t undergone any major renovations, permitting records show.\nHere\u2019s a timeline of how they did it:\nMarch 30, 2022:\nLakewood, New Jersey\n-based CMP Trading, which\nhas been involved with Nussbaum\non other transactions, bought the South Side property for $405,000. The 9-unit, 1920s-era brick apartment building is located in the Englewood neighborhood where mid-size multifamily sales rarely break $100,000 per unit and single family homes are listed for less than $200,000.\nApril 8, 2022:\nAbout a week after buying it, CMP sold the building to an LLC controlled by Ascher Berkowitz for $580,000. Berkowitz took out a 30-year, $430,000 mortgage from an entity called Commercial Lender LLC to fund the purchase.\nFebruary 27, 2023:\nSome portion of Berkowitz\u2019s LLC was transferred to a new owner for $375,000, though details are scant.\nFebruary 28, 2023:\nAn entity controlled by Nussbaum bought the West 58th Street property for $820,000 and took out a $565,000 mortgage against it from Accolend.\nAccolend is a Teaneck, New Jersey-based lender that has worked with Nussbaum on other Chicago deals and has sold some of its debt off to an affiliate of Athene Annuity and Life Company.\n\nApril 25, 2024:\nA Nussbaum-led entity took out a new $1.045 million loan on the property from Sharestates, a Great Neck, New York-based crowdfunding platform that Nussbaum has worked with in the past. Eli Tauber signed the mortgage documents.\nMay 8, 2024:\nNussbaum paid off the $565,000 Accolend loan, according to a publicly recorded mortgage release.\nSeptember 10, 2025:\nWilmington Trust, acting as a trustee of the $1 million loan originated by Sharestates, filed a foreclosure complaint, also listing Sharestates as a defendant. The filing states that the Nussbaum and Tauber entity has not made monthly payments since February.\nThe bigger picture\nThe 16 foreclosures filed against Tauber this summer all apply to properties he bought between February 2023 and May 2024, and total nearly $10 million in unpaid debts.\nBesides the West 58th Street building, the other properties facing foreclosure have only traded hands among the network of East Coast investors once. But all of them sold for prices well above their publicly appraised value.\nTauber and Nussbaum\u2019s deals raise questions about the purpose of the transactions and whether properties were sold in order to obtain larger loans without any money changing hands.\nTauber has signed multiple loans on behalf of Nussbaum\u2019s entities. He and his son Jacob Tauber have been Nussbaum\u2019s known deal partners on Chicago multifamily properties through a company called Straightline Management, according to people familiar with the investors.\nWhile Nussbaum has served real estate clients as a lawyer, he also became a fast-acting lender to help multifamily buyers show they had funds to close transactions.\nHe began buying Chicago apartment buildings that were in rough shape as a white knight, saving the previous owners from facing foreclosures or city building code violation cases.\n\u201cFor those properties in which he does hold some indirect interest, Mr. Nussbaum assumed control from prior, struggling owners and cured pre-existing violations,\u201d Nussbaum\u2019s attorney, Ethan Kobre of Schwartz Sladkus Reich Greenberg Atlas, previously told TRD.\nBut investors following similar playbooks have recently\nfaced scrutiny\nand\neven federal investigations\n.\nFederal agencies have discovered a pervasive scheme where investors buy a property and quickly sell it to a straw buyer at a higher price. The inflated price allows the owners to obtain a bigger loan, often from Fannie or Freddie, than they otherwise would have received. The goal is to\nbuy real estate with no money down\n.\nSome conspirators, including Eli and Aron Puretz, Moshe Silber, Fred Schulman and Boruch Drillman, have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud. More indictments are expected to come. Many of the players at the center of the DOJ\u2019s investigation have ties to Lakewood, New Jersey.\nThe DOJ has not brought any criminal charges or allegations of wrongdoing against Nussbaum and there is no known investigation into Nussbaum\u2019s transactions in Chicago.",

Austin has 6.3 months inventory, and Travis County has 6.9, according to Unlock MLS.\nHowever, sales and volume are up in the city. Total dollar volume increased year over year to almost $700 million, a 4.3 percent bump.\nPending sales were also up year over year in the Austin metro in August for the fourth month in a row. The Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos area closed out the month with 2,669 contracts pending, an 8.2 percent increase over last August.\n\u201cThat indicates that sustained buyer interest is out there, even as we head into the traditionally slower fall months,\u201d said Unlock MLS and Austin Board of Realtors president Brady Wuensch.\nBuyers are\ncanceling purchases\nat record rates, especially in Texas. As a result, it\u2019s worth wondering how many of the pending sales in Austin will finalize.\n\nOn the other hand, the effects of the Fed\u2019s Wednesday\ninterest rate cut\nare just as worthy of speculation.\n\u201cI think buyers and sellers have both recalibrated their expectations before waiting for the dramatic rate drops that we\u2019ve seen in the last couple years,\u201d Wuensch said.\nAs one developer put it, the Austin area is \u201c\nright-sizing\n\u201d after a few years of seller dominance.

        "content": "Ian Schrager is trading in his ivy-covered neoclassical home.\nThe Studio 54 co-founder and boutique hotel pioneer put his Bedford Corners estate in Westchester County on the market for $7.5 million, Curbed\nreported\n. Schrager bought the five-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bath spread in 2014 for $4.9 million, surprising those who associated him more with raw concrete condos.\nBuilt in 1936, the 12-acre property comes with manicured lawns, stone walls, a storybook pool house and interiors refreshed with white walls and dark floors. The listing leans on Schrager\u2019s pedigree as much as the house\u2019s charms, noting a renovation the family undertook the year they moved in.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Sally Slater has the\nlisting\n, which works out to $1,990 per square foot.\nThe move continues a recent sell-off for Schrager, who turns 80 next year. He listed a $7.5 million Miami Beach condo in a hotel he co-developed with Marriott last year and ultimately\nsold it for $7 million\n. He is still shopping a Dumbo loft he bought for $4.26 million in 2017, asking $3.95 million after a price cut.\n\nThe hotelier stepped away from Marriott in 2023, offloading select personal holdings as he narrows his focus.\nFor now, that focus is the Public, Schrager\u2019s bid to deliver a unique vision of luxury. He\u2019s said he has no plans to retire and is spending his days on the hotel brand\u2019s expansion.\nThis summer, an entity tied to the hotel\nfiled a summons\nagainst Whole Foods, seeking to prevent its delivery trucks from parking \u201cin front or in the vicinity\u201d of the property at 215 Chrystie Street. Whole Foods previously\nsued the hotel\n, alleging the crowd for the trendy bar prevents overnight deliveries at its East Houston Street location by restricting access to its driveway and loading docks.\nSchrager and Steve Witkoff opened the 28-story building \u2014 including 11 luxury condos on top of the hotel \u2014 in 2017, but were forced to close it down after the onset of the pandemic. The hotel reopened in the summer of 2021, but by the following year, the developers had defaulted on their $189 million senior mortgage and faced a UCC foreclosure on their equity in the property.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

He mentored dozens of agents over his nearly 20-year career in Miami real estate, and worked on new developments that included the\nRitz-Carlton Residences, Miami Beach\n, where he lived.\nTansey is survived by his brother Jerry Tansey and his family, as well as extended family who include his cousin Bryan Tansey. His cousin said he was heartened to see the \u201cturnout and the love\u201d at the celebration of life.\n\u201cWe did everything together, but I\u2019m learning now there\u2019s so much he did that I had no idea about,\u201d he said.\nTansey died of a heart attack, his cousin said. His funeral and burial will be in his hometown of Burlington, Iowa.\nJay Parker, CEO of\nDouglas Elliman\nFlorida; Michael Liebowitz, CEO of Douglas Elliman; Elliman agent Chris Wands; Tansey\u2019s associate, Lynna Weil; and others gave speeches about Tansey to a packed room at La Gorce Country Club in\nMiami Beach\n.\n\u201cThe fact there are so many people here to celebrate his life does not surprise me one bit at all. Darin brought people together and left an impression and an imprint on everyone and everywhere he went,\u201d Wands said. \u201cWhen I think about Darin, the first thing that comes to mind isn\u2019t just his success, his reputation or his color-coded suits in his closet, or the career he built. It\u2019s the way he changed lives, mine included.\u201d\n\nAmong those who attended were Compass agent Nancy Batchelor; Julian Johnston and Eloy Carmenate from the Corcoran Group; The Agency\u2019s Sharon Beck; and Elliman agents Michael and Jaimee Light, Marc Brandt, David Siddons and Dina Goldentayer.\nWeil, Tansey\u2019s executive assistant, joked that Tansey loved three things: \u201cwork, wine and beautiful women.\u201d\n\u201cDarin had this incredible ability to find your strength immediately. He didn\u2019t focus on what we lacked, he focused on what we have,\u201d she said. \u201cHe carried himself with poise, sophistication and honor, and he cheered for everyone\u2019s success as though his very own and in an industry where that is so rare.\u201d\nMany spoke about their close friendship with Tansey.\n\u201cDarin\u2019s legacy is us, his family, friends, colleagues, business associates and our dear Vino [Tansey\u2019s dog],\u201d Parker said. \u201cLet\u2019s show Darin that his impact was powerful enough to cause us all to give a little more, love a little more and do the right thing, even when the alternative path is easier. You will be missed more than I could ever have imagined.\u201d\nLiebowitz, who took over as president and CEO of the brokerage last year, said Tansey \u201ctruly lived every day in a way that he really enjoyed himself.\u201d\n\u201cIt was the way he ate, the way he worked out, the way he did business, and the way he treated people. I never really ran into a person that had a negative thing to say about Darin, and that\u2019s unusual,\u201d Liebowitz said. \u201cUsually when you\u2019re at a memorial service, there\u2019s something you want to joke around about that you could say that\u2019s negative. I can\u2019t come up with one.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The cost of a U.S. Department Veterans Affairs project in Palo Alto has ballooned out of control.\nThe redevelopment of the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Medical Center, originally slated as a $450.3 million endeavor, could now cost the federal government $1.6 billion, the Silicon Valley Business Journal\nreported\n. The department has been trying to renovate the complex for two decades.\nThe plan first called for demolishing six buildings at 3801 Miranda Avenue to make way for two buildings spanning more than 379,000 square feet as well as a parking garage. As time went on, the VA expanded the planned use of the development to include intensive rehabilitation care and an ambulatory care center. Those units meant more buildings added to the site, and as a result, more expenses.\nOriginally slated for completion in 2015, the languishing project is now expected to finish in 2036. It\u2019s about $1.2 billion over budget, with an estimated $74 million added to the costs every year that the project goes unfinished.\n\u201cBecause the Palo Alto project was never effectively governed, the costs and scope of the project grew out of control,\u201d Larry Reinkemeyer, the VA\u2019s assistant inspector general for audits and evaluations, wrote in a report cited by the outlet.\n\nThe office claimed that budgets and schedules were not fully analyzed and work requirements were tweaked without proper approval.\nTalks of redevelopment started in 2007 when a regional branch of the Veterans Integrated Service Network requested that Palo Alto receive a new ambulatory care center. Some buildings at the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Medical Center were in need of renovation, but the addition of the 325,000-square-foot ambulatory care center project required the VA to do major construction at the site.\nCongress approved the VA\u2019s initial request for $450 million for the construction project in 2009. The VA approved a request for an additional $266 million in 2011, though most of that tranche hasn\u2019t been appropriated. Last year, the VA made its biggest request for a $907.8 million budget increase.\nAs of 2019, the VA had completed 10 phases of the project, including an intensive care unit and mental health center. The ambulatory care center has yet to be built. By February of this year, nine of the 12 buildings that were slated for demolition were still standing.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The joint venture paid $21 million for the 18.4 acre site in 2020.\nRoyal Palm Doral has two tenants, Kope Logistics and Zoghbi Perfumes, and has 164,247 square feet available for lease, according to an online listing.\n\nTerreno\nis very active in the Doral industrial submarket. In July, the firm sold six industrial buildings in Doral for\n$82 million\nto Boston-based Longpoint. Seven months earlier, in December, Terreno dropped\n$195.6 million\nfor three warehouses on 23.4 acres in Doral.\nLink and Blackstone, which recently bought the East Miami hotel in Brickell for nearly\n$300 million\n, have been selling industrial properties in South Florida at a steady clip since November. With the sale of Royal Palm Doral, the Link-Blackstone industrial sell-off has hit more than $1.1 billion in combined sales.\nIn June, the two firms sold a 43.7-acre industrial development site in Opa-Locka for\n$105.7 million\nto Boston-based TA Realty. In December, the same buyer acquired an industrial complex adjacent to the development site for\n$160 million\nfrom Link and Blackstone.\nThe selling spree kicked off with the November sale of a 26-industrial property portfolio spanning Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties for\n$331.3 million\nto Longpoint. A month later, Link and Blackstone sold a five-building portfolio in Sunrise for\n$205.5 million\nto Miami-based Elion Partners.

The property is currently a surface parking lot and was slated for the construction of a 60-story building featuring 713 residential units and parking as well as ground-floor retail.\nThe pullback comes one month after Mack\u2019s development arm, Mack Real Estate Development,\nreceived approvals\nfor the construction of a\n51-story residential high-rise\nat 1115 South Olive Street across the street.\nMack\u2019s proposed 60-story tower would have been the largest of a group of developments from the firm in the nearby area. Those include the 362-unit Wren apartments at 1230 Olive Street and the 536-unit Aven residential high-rise at 1120 South Grand Avenue.\nThe scuttled South Olive Street tower would\u2019ve risen 603 feet and featured 536 studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments above 4,178 square feet of ground-floor retail,\nper\nUrbanize. A four-level podium and six subterranean parking levels would\u2019ve had space for 581 cars.

        "content": "Speculation arose about the next chapter for Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Hotel Chicago after its purchase earlier this summer by a firm known for timeshare conversions. Now we know the downtown property will be converted into a Sports Illustrated\u2013branded resort under a plan from Travel + Leisure, which is betting that timeshares can work in the Loop.\nThe Orlando-based vacation ownership giant said this week it will launch a 250-unit Sports Illustrated Resorts location in Chicago late next year, joining forthcoming sites in Nashville and Tuscaloosa, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The company didn\u2019t name the property, but people familiar with the deal told the outlet it will take over the 26-story Virgin Hotel at 203 North Wabash Avenue.\nThe world\u2019s first Virgin Hotel\nsold\nin June for $77.4 million to Michigan-based Accelerated Assets, a firm that specializes in converting hotels and apartments into timeshares. That\u2019s $309,600 per key. The seller was a joint venture between Miami\u2019s Lionstone Development and Virgin Hotels, which spent over $117 million \u2014 or $468,000 per key \u2014 to redevelop the landmark Old Dearborn Bank Building a decade ago. In 2020, Branson\u2019s Virgin Hotels Group and Lionstone Development\nlanded\na $37 million refinance on the hotel through Prime Finance, retiring an HSBC loan.\nTravel + Leisure said the project will involve converting an existing hotel and offering \u201cflexible, points-based ownership options,\u201d with sales to begin early next year. Construction is expected to wrap in late 2026, though the\nhotel\nwill remain open during the renovations.\nThe\nproperty\nrepresents a rare foray into urban timeshares. Those models are typically concentrated in resort destinations, though a handful operate in markets like New York City. The Chicago version will feature a redesigned lobby with sports-inspired d\u00e9cor, a street-level coffee shop, a restaurant and a sports bar, according to Travel + Leisure.\n\nThe plan ties together several players in the evolving hospitality niche. Sports Illustrated Resorts, launched in 2023 through a partnership with Sports Hospitality Ventures, licenses its brand from Authentic Brands Group, which owns the magazine\u2019s intellectual property. Accelerated Assets has a history in Chicago, teaming with Bluegreen Vacations to convert the Hotel Blake at 500 South Dearborn Street into timeshares in 2013.\nThe Virgin deal was on the higher end of where Chicago hotels trade. Accelerated\u2019s buy was among the priciest per-room sales since before the pandemic, possibly signaling the property would not continue as a traditional hotel. The 1928 building sits steps from Michigan Avenue and the Riverwalk. It was designed by Rapp &amp; Rapp in 1928 and landmarked in 2003.\nThe building\u2019s tax status offers another wrinkle: it\u2019s under a Class L landmark incentive, meaning it received discounted assessments for refurbishing a city landmark and will graduate back up to the standard 25 percent of value through 2027.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The Huizenga family and Integra Investments scored initial approval for changes to their long-planned $2 billion mixed-use development at the site of the Safe Harbor Rybovich, better known as Rybovich Marina.\nThe partners are planning a massive redevelopment of the 19-acre waterfront site, spanning from 4000 to 4300 North Flagler Drive, adjacent to the superyacht marina. The West Palm Beach Planning Board rubber stamped the developers\u2019 requested changes to the design guidelines and site plans at its meeting Tuesday. The updated plans still need approval by the West Palm Beach City Commission.\nThe new site plan calls for 20,691 square feet of office space, 37,445 square feet of retail, 14,376 square feet of restaurants, 12,750 square feet of crew amenities and 3,355 square feet of marine storage.\nThe plan limits the total number of residential units allowed to 1,059. Of that allotment, Related Group\u2019s\nIcon Marina Village\nalready accounts for 399 apartments. For the remaining allowed 660 units, Huizenga and Integra are planning four waterfront condominium towers, the highest of which will be 445 feet tall. So far, the developers are only seeking approval on plans for two of the towers, totaling 259 units. One is slated to span 34 stories with 147 units, and the other 36 stories with 112 units, a spokesperson for the developers confirmed.\nThe updated site plan also adds 60,937 square feet for a private or semi-private club, which will be aimed at residents of the planned condominiums and will allow for 250 non-resident memberships, planning documents show.\nThe addition of the private club comes as\ndemand for members\u2019 clubs has surged\nin Palm Beach County, with limited availability creating yearslong waits.\n\nThe Rybovich Marina redevelopment has been in the works for more than a decade, and was first approved in 2014. The city created the Marina Commercial Marine Planned Development (CMPD), allowing for 1,059 residential units, 35,000 square feet of offices, 10,000 square feet of retail, 15,000 square feet of restaurants, 45,000 square feet of marine industrial space and 10,000 square feet of crew amenities, planning documents show.\nThe site is rare for both its size and its water frontage, in a city where developers are racing to snap up the last buildable properties along the Intracoastal Waterway.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to find a 19-acre private property with waterfront that you see here today,\u201d said Brian Seymour, an attorney for the developers.\nHuizenga Holdings is led by H. Wayne Huizenga, Jr., the son of late billionaire H. Wayne Huizenga who is best known for building up companies like Waste Management, Blockbuster Video, Extended Stay America and AutoNation. The Huizengas are the longtime owners of the Rybovich Marina site, and also have an ownership stake in Safe Harbor.\nH. Wayne Huizenga, Jr. and his wife own the nearby waterfront house at 3100 North Flagler Drive, which they bought for $5 million in 2018. Property records show the county estimates its market value at $26.6 million.\nIntegra is led by Paulo Tavares de Melo, Nelson Stabile and Victor Ballestas. The Huizengas and Integra tapped architecture firm Kohn Pedersen Fox, known for its role in Related Companies\u2019\nHudson Yards\nmegaproject in New York City, to design the marina district.\nThe planned Rybovich Marina condos are among the\nmore than 2,000 units planned for West Palm Beach\n. Since the 2014 approval, the pandemic triggered a dramatic wealth migration to Palm Beach County, transforming the region and its real estate market.",

        "content": "Tishman Speyer\u2019s mystery buyer revealed: Kilroy Realty purchased Maple Plaza in Beverly Hills, paying $205.3 million for the about 300,000-square-foot property.\nA person familiar said there was a competitive process on the deal, which came to $707 per square foot, with the property about 75 percent occupied.\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported\nTishman Speyer had an agreement to sell the offices for more than $200 million but the buyer was unknown.\nTishman Speyer has cashed in on three Beverly Hills offices properties in a year \u2014 the latest, at 345 North Maple Drive, was purchased by the New York-based investor for $101 million two decades ago. The other two are 407 North Maple Drive, which Tishman Speyer\nsold\nto Fashion Nova for $119.7 million, after buying it for $71.9 million; and 9242 Beverly, which it\nsold\nto Envision and Faring for $90 million, after acquiring it for $38 million.\nKilroy Realty said it purchased the three-story, Class A office campus for around $707 a square foot via cash on hand and recent disposition proceeds. The publicly traded real estate investment trust\nrecently sold\na Santa Monica office building for $40 million, and hinted that it may sell another, seeking a similar price, next year. The property it recently sold \u2014 a seven-story and 73,000-square-foot property at 501 Santa Monica Boulevard \u2014 was 65 percent occupied.\n\nThe sale marks Kilroy Realty\u2019s debut in Beverly Hills, where office vacancies are lower than downtown Los Angeles but higher than neighboring Century City. The sale could go down as one of the priciest all year. In the second quarter, per a CBRE market report, the highest sale in West Los Angeles was Barings\u2019 $150.7 million Playa Vista buy.\nTishman Speyer\u2019s Ryan Botjer called the Maple Plaza deal a successful completion of an exit from a trio of Beverly Hills, in an announcement by the company.\nKilroy Chief Executive Angela Aman, in a press release, said the deal came at a substantial discount to estimated replacement cost.\nCBRE\u2019s Stephen Somer and Brooke Silver, who brokered the deal, declined to comment.\n",

        "content": "The California legislature\u2019s\npassage of Senate Bill 79\ndidn\u2019t come without a few modifications, including a carveout that excludes one county.\nContra Costa County in the Bay Area wouldn\u2019t be required to upzone areas surrounding transit hubs for higher density under the proposed law, the Mercury News\nreported\n.\nThe bill, originally proposed by state Sen. Scott Wiener in 2018, allows the construction of up to nine stories for buildings adjacent to certain bus stops and train stations, seven stories for buildings within a quarter-mile of the stops, and six stories for buildings within a half-mile. It would also subject single-family neighborhoods within a half-mile of transit stops to the zoning regulations.\nWhile working its way through the legislature, the bill was amended to only apply to counties with more than 15 high-frequency train or bus stops. That left just seven counties in the state to deal with it: Alameda, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara. Once Orange County\u2019s streetcar project is completed next year, it will also be subject to the bill\u2019s application.\nBy changing the bill\u2019s language defining which stations count toward that 15-station threshold, Contra Costa County escaped any\nSB 79-related upzoning\n. The county has 12 Bay Area Rapid Transit stations and three Amtrak stations, in Richmond, Martinez and Antioch.\n\nThe Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors and city councilmembers in Lafayette and Orinda\npleaded with state lawmakers\nto push the amendment through. Their argument was that SB 79 would increase density along fire evacuation zones and put residents at risk.\nThe final version of the bill upheld Wiener\u2019s vision, while also \u201crespecting the distinct needs of each community,\u201d said state Assemblymember Anamarie Avila Farias, who represents northern Contra Costa County.\nOther amendments to the bill include stopping developers from using SB 79 to advance a project that would demolish more than two rent-controlled apartments, which prevents most multifamily buildings built before 2014 from being redeveloped through the law, allowing cities to exempt certain areas defined as \u201clow-resource\u201d by the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee if they also plan for density in other parts of the city, and giving cities permission draft alternative zoning plans within transit areas next year, though they must preserve at least half the density the proposed law calls for.\nSB 79 heads to Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s desk next month.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The two firms hope to reel in more than $500 million for the 344,000-square-foot property.\nThe 30-story property features 571 units \u2014 a quarter of which are affordable \u2014 and 8,300 square feet of retail space. Amenities include a gym, sports simulator and rooftop pool.\nThe building is 76 percent occupied, according to an offering memorandum.\nA spokesperson for Silverstein said the plan all along was to sell the property shortly after its conversion.\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud of what we accomplished,\u201d a spokesperson for Metro Loft told\nThe Real Deal\n, concurring that selling the building was always the plan and that the firm was \u201coptimistic\u201d about the sale process.\n\nA Newmark team including Adam Spies, Doug Harmon and Adam Doneger have the listing.\nSilverstein and Metro Loft initially went into contract in 2022 to buy the former Goldman Sachs headquarters from Rudin for $180 million, but the sale was pushed as interest rates rose. The deal ultimately closed the summer of 2023\nfor $172.5 million\n, about a 4 percent discount from the initial contract price.\nThe developers ultimately landed $220 million in financing from Mexico-based Banco Inbursa. Ares Real Estate also has a stake, as does Rudin, which retained a stake after the sale.\nCetraRuddy served as the architect on the conversion. The property\u2019s doors first opened for residents last September, according to\nMulti-Housing News\n.\nAs Metro Loft works to sell this conversion, it is getting started on its next conversion at 675 Third Avenue, a\n464-unit project\nin the works with David Werner Real Estate Investments.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

In other words, a Mamdani administration that won\u2019t be stacked solely with members of the Democratic Socialists of America.\nWhelan said whoever becomes mayor, \u201cit\u2019s in all our interests that he succeeds.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking to work closely with Mayor Mamdani if he is the winner on November 4,\u201d he said.\nMamdani\u2019s opponents have repeatedly criticized his lack of previous experience (he has been a state Assembly member, representing the 36th District in Queens, since 2021). Critics and supporters alike will be watching who joins his administration closely.\nMamdani has been tight-lipped about potential administration hires. In fact, reported overtures by Comptroller Brad Lander to become the first deputy mayor have allegedly caused tension between the two,\nGothamist reported\n.\n\nThe remarks come after months of some in the industry flip-flopping on their support of candidates vying to beat Mamdani\nReal estate executives poured millions of dollars into backing former Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s campaign ahead of the June primary. Some shifted their allegiance to Mayor Eric Adams after his loss, but support fizzled alongside the mayor\u2019s poor polling numbers.\nOthers, however, including some affordable housing developers, have been\nvocal\nabout trying to work with Mamdani as the presumed next mayor.\nStill, a number of industry players have\ndonated\ntens of thousands of dollars to various anti-Mamdani political action committees. Related Companies CEO Jeff Blau reportedly organized a meeting of business leaders this month to\nstrategize\nCuomo\u2019s potential path to victory.\nWhelan and REBNY chair Jed Walentas met with Mamdani last month,\nas The Real Deal previously reported\n. Whelan described Mamdani as a \u201cgood listener\u201d and said they discussed topics where they agree (the need for upzonings, increasing housing vouchers, fully staffing the city\u2019s housing agencies), points where they might agree (how to ramp up housing production) and areas where they disagree (Mamdani\u2019s proposal to freeze rents for stabilized apartments).\nDuring Thursday\u2019s event, Whelan also highlighted some of the trade group\u2019s legislative priorities next year. For example, he believes \u201cthe idea of increasing taxes is going to be a robust conversation in Albany next year,\u201d an effort that REBNY will oppose. He also expressed hope that lawmakers will eventually change the city\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions law, Local Law 97, to help property owners comply. He additionally floated extending the office-to-residential conversions tax exemption, 467m, and increasing the value of the incentive for projects outside of Manhattan.\n",

        "content": "The Caltagirone brothers\u2019 Calta Group scored approval for a 499-unit Live Local Act tower in Allapattah, marking one of the first Miami projects under the state law with both condos and apartments.\nCoral Gables-based Calta plans the 30-story Anatomia with 6,500 square feet of retail at 1415\u20131469 Northwest 13th Terrace in Miami, according to the developer\u2019s news release. At its Wednesday meeting, the City of Miami Urban Development Review Board approved the project.\nDesigned by Corwil Architects, Anatomia will consist of 289 luxury condos and 210 apartments, the release says.\nThe Live Local Act, which Florida lawmakers approved in 2023 and tweaked in the following two years, awards developers with density and height bonuses in exchange for including apartments at below-market rate rents in their projects. Under the law, at least 40 percent of units have to be designated for households earning no more than 120 percent of the area median income.\nWhile the law allows for projects to include condos, the workforce and affordable units have to be apartments.\nAt Anatomia, all residents will share a lobby and access to the primary amenity deck, the release says.\nThe tower also will have a rooftop lounge for condo owners and members.\n\nOf the 210 apartments, 128 will be studios and 82 will be one-bedroom units. The condos will range from studios averaging 419 square feet to three-bedroom units averaging 1,111 square feet, with asking prices from $500,000 to $950,000, according to the release.\nCalta bought the 1.1-acre, two-lot development site in two deals, paying $10 million in 2023 for one of the parcels, and $7.2 million last year for the other, records show.\nCalta, which Gaetano Caltagirone leads with Ignazio Caltagirone, has been ramping up its South Florida development activity in recent years. The brothers, who founded the firm in 2010, grew up in a real estate family in Italy, and started betting on South Florida\u2019s housing market during the Great Recession, renovating and flipping houses.\nIn Hollywood, Calta developed the eight-story, 180-unit\nRevv Hollywood\napartment building at 2233 Hollywood Boulevard.\nIn Coral Gables, it plans the Via Veneto project with 10 three-story townhomes at 915 and 920 Palermo Avenue in Coral Gables. Calta launched sales last year, with asking prices at the time starting at\n$5.5 million\n.\nIn February, Calta scored a\n$53.7 million\nconstruction loan for the 151-unit Caltopia Hollywood apartment project at 2750 Van Buren Street, as well as the 100-unit Caltopia Hollywood II apartment project at 2217-2239 Jackson Street in Hollywood.\nSouth Florida developers have seized on the\nLive Local Act\nwith proposals for large projects. The biggest known Live Local complex on tap in Miami-Dade County is Spanish developer Pablo Castro and his local partner Laura Tauber\u2019s\n4,032-unit\nHueHub in West Little River. The project will have seven 35-story apartment towers at 8395 Northwest 27th Avenue.\nElsewhere, RCC Developers proposes a\n25-story, 300-unit\nLive Local tower on the northeast corner of Southwest 214th Street and U.S. 1/South Dixie Highway in Goulds. Masoud and Stephanie Shojaee\u2019s Shoma Group wants to build the 16-story, 201-unit\nPonce 8\nLive Local apartment building at 3808-3850 Southwest Eighth Street in Coral Gables.",

        "content": "Highbridge Equity Partners has fallen into default on three Oakland office buildings.\nAn affiliate of the Oakland-based firm was served a notice of default for a loan tied to the Tribune Tower at 403 13th Street as well as 405 14th Street and 1500 Broadway, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. It could signal that a foreclosure process might be imminent, though Highbridge could still pursue a refinancing deal or loan modification, or sell the properties outright to offload the loan.\nHighbridge bought the three office properties between 2016 and 2019 for a total of $119.6 million, according to the Business Times. \u201cDeadliest Catch\u201d producer Thom Beers and music producer Dr. Luke are among the firm\u2019s backers.\nRialto provided a $111 million loan in 2022 to refinance $91.1 million in existing debt and fund future renovations and improvements for the three properties. The following year, Highbridge hammered out a forbearance deal with Rialto Capital Management after falling more than 30 days delinquent on its loan. At the time, Highbridge founder\ntold\nThe Real Deal\nthat the firm was no longer considered delinquent after that deal.\n\nAfter that, Highbridge reportedly made several late payments and delinquencies, according to the Business Times. The loan transferred to special servicing from August to October of 2024. As of this July, the\nRialto\nloan had an outstanding balance of $94.5 million.\nThe loan itself is still active, so its lender can still pursue foreclosure, refinancing or term modifications, per the Business Times.\nOakland\u2019s office market has struggled to regain occupancy in the years after the pandemic. In the city\u2019s central business district,\nvacancy\nsits at around 27 percent, while leasing activity dropped 30 percent last quarter, according to the Business Times. As of the end of last year, Highbridge\u2019s Oakland office portfolio had a combined occupancy of 34 percent; that includes 60 percent occupancy at the Tribune Tower, 25 percent at 1500 Broadway and 16 percent at 405 15th Street.\nThe slump has led to the sale of several office properties at steep discounts, including 180 Grand Avenue, 1950 Franklin Street, 1700 Broadway and 1440 Broadway. It remains to be seen if Highbridge opts to go the route of the 1515 Webster Street building, which it sold last year for $22.5 million after buying it in 2019 for nearly $19.3 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The home of America\u2019s biggest university restricted shared housing for decades, but with a new state law in effect, dense inventory in College Station is poised to grow.\nTexas A&amp;M University has the biggest student body in the country, aside from universities with online schools, with over 70,000 students on campus each fall. Before this month, it was illegal for five or more unrelated people to share a home or apartment in most of College Station. Only certain neighborhoods were allowed exceptions to the \u201cno more than four\u201d rule, a rare restriction that became especially tight in a city of young, single tenants living away from their families.\n\u201cOnly a handful of other cities in the state were using restrictive occupancy at a relationship level,\u201d property manager and developer Jeffrey Leatherwood said.\nStudents, real estate agents and developers, including Leatherwood, helped convince the Texas legislature to pass Senate Bill 1567, which was fine-tuned for College Station. The law forbids college towns with populations of less than 250,000 from enforcing resident limits based on age, occupation, familial status or relationship status.\n\u201cThe City of College Station was putting real estate people in a difficult situation, and SB 1567 made it a lot easier for us to conduct business,\u201d Leatherwood said.\nThe bill took effect Sept. 1, and it\u2019s not clear how long it will take the market to adjust. No permits for dense \u201cAg shack\u201d developments have been approved in formerly restricted neighborhoods yet.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to be interesting to see is when that six-bedroom plan gets submitted to the city, in an area where they had been traditionally pushing back on those plans, if that\u2019s going to go through,\u201d developer Scott Hancock said.\nMeanwhile, recent student housing deals include a $30 million loan for Culver Investment Partners to acquire a condo property on Harvey Mitchell Parkway in a zone that did not have a shared housing exception, according to Traded.\n\nThe city is working to \u201cclean up the books\u201d and align with the law, said City Councilmember Bob Yancy, who criticized the law before it took effect.\nDevelopers expect College Station to forestall dense development by other means, just as other Texas cities have attempted to hinder\nYIMBY legislation\n. For example, in response to\nanother state law\nthat allows residential development in commercial areas without rezoning,\nArlington\nenacted requirements for parking space, balcony length and mandatory amenities, like swimming pools. Plano, Frisco and Irving have created\nsimilar requirements\n.\nThe city enforced the \u201cno more than four\u201d rule by citing homes with more than four cars parked out front. The city could try parking restrictions as a de facto cap on residents per unit, Hancock said.\nThe council will likely institute new parking rules, but they will aim to improve road safety rather than counter SB 1567, Yancy said.\n\u201cOur own housing policies were unnecessarily restrictive in housing starts,\u201d Yancy said, referring to ordinances besides the \u201cno more than four\u201d rule.\nThe city has a shortage of about 4,900 units, he said.\n\u201cApproximately 10 years ago, the city began enforcing more stringent building regulations and fees, and they had a significant impact on our housing market and, I believe, exacerbated the occupancy problems that we have had throughout the city,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "Terrell isn\u2019t ready to greenlight one of the largest master-planned communities pitched in North Texas.\nCity council members postponed a vote on Terra Nova, a proposed 1,550-acre community from Plano-based Main Square Development this week, after a tense meeting where residents aired concerns about scale, infrastructure and whether the developer can deliver on promises. The council will revisit the plan in November, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe project\ncalls\nfor 3,600 single-family homes, 1,200 multifamily units, 145 acres of parks and a 50-acre downtown-style district dubbed Terra Nova Village, all located mostly empty land bordered by Griffith Avenue, Poetry Road and County Road 245. Hugo Morales, Main Square\u2019s president, has pitched it as a community\ndesigned\nto elevate Terrell\u2019s appeal while integrating into the city\u2019s existing fabric.\nFor Morales, who founded Main Square last year after two decades with Kimley Horn, the project is a bet on both his startup firm and Terrell.\nBut skeptics aren\u2019t sold. Most respondents to a city survey were not in favor of the development. City Staff received two petitions with about 80 signatures not in favor.\nA resident who spoke at the meeting, Pamela Robertson, urged phased approvals rather than a blanket sign-off.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a first-time development for this developer,\u201d she said, warning against rubber-stamping a plan that could take up to two decades to build out. Her fear is that Terrell could end up replicating the rapid, infrastructure-straining growth of cities like Forney, Prosper and Princeton.\nThose examples loom large. Princeton, the fastest-growing city in the U.S. this year, recently slammed the brakes on residential permits through a temporary moratorium to buy time for roads and utilities to catch up.\nTerrell officials appeared mindful of that precedent. Chris Snapp, the city\u2019s development director, told council members that traffic impact studies will be updated at each stage of Terra Nova\u2019s 14-to-16-phase rollout to hold the developer accountable.\nMorales said the\nscale\nof Terra Nova would be a strength rather than a risk to Terrell\u2019s growth.\n\u201cIt\u2019s much easier to create a good community when you have a larger area of land,\u201d he told the chamber, rather than piecemeal developments.\nThe project embodies some tension playing out across fast-growing Dallas suburbs as\nwell\nas in the urban core, between the need for housing and the capacity of local governments to manage rapid expansion.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "City Council members considering passing the\nCommunity Opportunity to Purchase Act\nmight want to see how Chicago\u2019s version is working.\nThe answer, it seems, is not well. Two City Council members pulled their wards out of the law\u2019s coverage area. One told Crain\u2019s Chicago Business that the law is burdening apartment building sales with\nred tape\nfor the sake of tenants who are completely unprepared to buy their buildings.\nAlderman Felix Cardona Jr. commended the idea of the law, but said it doesn\u2019t even teach tenants how to get a mortgage, let alone manage a co-op or condo.\n\u201cThe success of this initiative heavily depends on the preparedness of prospective buyers, particularly tenants who may not have experience navigating the homebuying process,\u201d he said at a council meeting, according to Crain\u2019s.\nThe Real Deal\nexplained in a\nmagazine story\n: \u201cThe backlash against the program follows landlord complaints that it kills deals to sell or refinance their buildings, and get title insurance, by delaying closings and injecting uncertainty into the process.\u201d\nStudies of such laws, often called the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, or TOPA, have found that they only work for tenants if the government also provides funding, in part to prepare tenants to become homeowners and collectively run an apartment building.\nThe HDFC co-op program might be New York\u2019s most successful effort of this sort, but it does not affect private building sales like TOPA and COPA would. And the opportunities to create HDFCs are now exceedingly rare.\nMost of the approximately 1,300 HDFCs were created decades ago from buildings acquired by the city through tax foreclosures, which don\u2019t happen anymore. (Lenders usually foreclose first, and the city now sells tax and water/sewer liens rather than become a landlord.) Tenants did not have to come up with down payments and mortgages because the city typically sold the building for what they were paying in rent.\nHDFCs, to be sure, have had their share of problems (33 in Manhattan made the \u201c\nworst landlords\n\u201d list in 2016), but guardrails have been put in place over the years to prevent mismanagement or exploitation of the buildings by shareholders. Hundreds of HDFCs have regulatory agreements with HPD, which contracts with nonprofits such as UHAB to provide oversight and technical assistance.\n\u201cFor the most part, HDFCs run well and people who live in HDFCs are honest,\u201d said UHAB\u2019s Oscar McDonald. \u201cIn a few buildings where there are bad actors, that is not an indictment of all HDFCs.\u201d\nHDFCs were fairly successful because the buildings were basically free. TOPA bills imagine tenants quickly organizing to buy valuable buildings, which they are typically not ready, willing or able to do.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nI decided to look up the property records of 535 First Street, a 6,500-square-foot, renovated Park Slope limestone that just sold for\n$13.9 million\n, a\nneighborhood record for single-family homes\n.\nIt was the home of a childhood friend of mine, Nicky Gussoff. His parents, Bernard and Judith Gussoff, bought it in 1966 from Mary D. Tully. (The neighborhood had a lot of Irish in those days; my parents bought the Loughlin family\u2019s house two blocks away in 1967.)\nThe exact price the Gussoffs paid is not in city records, but their mortgage is. Tully, the seller, provided it to the buyers: $9,500. She gave the Gussoffs 15 years to pay it back, which they did in 1981. Their monthly payment began at $46.\n\nWhat has become of your childhood home? Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The Related Companies\ndenied\na\nDaily News report\nthat it was contemplating offering Mayor Eric Adams a job to stop him from campaigning for re-election. The firm said it has no intention of doing so. That makes sense, because a prosecutor might see it as bribery.\nOffering something of value to a public official to do something that would benefit the offerer is illegal. In this case, the benefit to a real estate firm would be a better chance for Andrew Cuomo to defeat Zohran Mamdani in the November election.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 An upcoming City Council vote will put member deference to the test. The Council will soon vote on whether to build a development for formerly incarcerated people on a Bronx hospital campus. But,\nGothamist\nreports, despite earlier support, Mayor Eric Adams has pulled away from the proposal amid opposition from local Council member Kristy Marmorato. Several other Council members, however, say they will still vote yes, meaning the project may still be greenlit.\n\u2014 Democratic officials were arrested in lower Manhattan on Thursday night after trying to gain access to an area containing ICE detainees, the New York Times\nreports\n. The 11 Democrats, including Comptroller Brad Lander, were trying to inspect the 10th floor of 26 Federal Plaza, which has been subject to allegations of unsanitary conditions. When ICE denied the group entry, the officials reportedly sat on the floor, started chanting and unfurled a banner that said \u201cNYers against ICE.\u201d\n\u2014 New York State Democratic Party Chairman Jay Jacobs said he will not endorse Zohran Mamdani, citing disagreements over Israel and democratic socialism, per the\nNew York Times\n. Gov. Kathy Hochul publicly backed Mamdani earlier this week.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$13.9 million\nfor a 6,500-square-foot at 535 First Street in Park Slope. Tim Malone of Compass had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$13.5 million\nfor a 6,865-square-foot apartment building at 280 West 11th Street in the West Village.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$40 million\nfor a 12,400-square-foot house at 2 East 82nd Street on the Upper East Side. The property last traded for\n$19 million\nin 2023. Adam Modlin has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 87,279-square-foot, 14-story, mixed-use project at 19 Clay Street in Greenpoint. Murat Mutlu of INOA Architecture filed the permit on behalf of Idan Shitrit of Investmates.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

Still, it doesn\u2019t topple the most expensive sale to date, which was the $22 million trade of\n32221 South Coast Highway\nin July. That gated, 3.7-acre property includes several parcels, three structures and private beach access.\nThe Ocean Way property was one of two residences, the other being in Pasadena, where Cannell spent his time until his death in 2010.\n\nProperty records show Cannell purchased the\nLaguna Beach\nhome in 1999 for $1,093 per square foot, or $5.2 million.\nThe property sits atop a bluff with unobstructed views of the ocean. The home has four bedrooms and four-and-a-half bathrooms across 4,700 square feet. It\u2019s gated and set on a 10,000-square-foot lot.\nRecent upgrades include hardwood flooring, lighting and HVAC system.\nOne of two offices in the home was used by Cannell, whose prolific career spanned television and novels. Cannell is behind dozens of TV shows, including \u201cThe Rockford Files,\u201d \u201cThe A-Team,\u201d \u201c21 Jump Street\u201d and \u201cThe Commish.\u201d \u201cThe Rockford Files\u201d earned him a Primetime Emmy Award in the Outstanding Drama Series category in 1978.\nHe became an independent producer with the start of Stephen J.

        "content": "The $252 million transformation of Vernon Hills\u2019 Hawthorn Mall is moving into its next act, after Village trustees approved a revised plan for Phase II of Hawthorn 2.0, clearing the way for construction to start next year.\nThe changes mark the third iteration of Phase II and reflect what Dallas-based Centennial Real Estate, one of the project\u2019s ownership partners, called a major improvement over the version\nsigned\noff in 2022, the Daily Herald\nreported\n. Tweaks include relocating and expanding the residential component to 288 apartments across two four-story buildings, up from 255 units.\nRetail will also get a bump to 37,300 square feet of ground-level space. The buildings will straddle a covered paseo, and the plan also includes a direct connection to the intersection of Route 21 and Townline Road.\nAlong with Centennial, the project partners include development and construction company Focus Development, real estate investment firm Affinius Capital and Atlanta-based developer Atlantic Residential.\nThe new scheme\nspares\nmuch more of the original 1970s-era mall. Earlier versions had called for\nremoving\nnearly a third of the remaining space, but the updated plan pares that demolition down to just 5,600 square feet \u2014 the former Barnes &amp; Noble box \u2014 while reworking the east and south facades into outward-facing retail lined by landscaped plazas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a substantially improved plan, layout and use of real estate,\u201d said Sam Whitebread, Centennial\u2019s vice president of development.\nThe apartments will build on The Domaine, the luxury rental complex delivered in Phase I that\u2019s now 95 percent leased. Fifty-eight of the units will be set aside for tenants earning 60 percent of area median income.\nThe village\u2019s sign-off required a special-use permit, subdivision plat and revised development agreement, but the approvals sailed through. The project team \u2014 Centennial, Focus, Atlantic Residential and Affinius Capital \u2014 expects to start construction next spring, with the first openings slated for late 2027.\nRather than\ngutting\nthe mall, the developers are betting on a mix of fresh housing, open-air retail and selective demolition to keep the property relevant.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Developer Mohamed Eldawy is pushing ahead with a $540 million project on Galveston\u2019s west end, betting big on the island\u2019s growth as a tourism and\nresidential\nhub.\nEldawy\u2019s Friendswood-based Royal Crown Enterprise is planning a 15-acre development called Sachs on the Seawall, slated for a site where Seawall Boulevard meets Termini-San Luis Pass Road. A preliminary zoning approval this week paved the way for two condo towers, a hotel and commercial space on the site, Chron\nreported\n.\nThe first phase calls for a 216-room Marriott Renaissance hotel, 150 condo units and 70,000 square feet of office, retail and restaurant space, according to project filings. Four acres would be dedicated to green space and a nature preserve. A second phase would add two apartment buildings with 236 units, including workforce housing and rentals for J-1 visa students tied to the University of Texas Medical Branch.\nEldawy told city officials the plan could generate 2,300 jobs across construction, hospitality and retail. He\u2019s also eyeing restaurant tenants, including a Floyds Cajun Seafood outpost and a franchise of La Madeleine that he plans to operate himself.\n\nThe project has already cleared one regulatory hurdle: FAA approval for towers up to 145 feet, or about 11 stories, given the site\u2019s proximity to Scholes International Airport. Even so, the airport has raised concerns about possible impacts on air traffic.\nThe design comes from Steven Biegel of Round Rock-based Place Designers, whose portfolio includes the nearby Diamond Beach and\nTiara on the Beach\ncondos, as well as\nprojects\nin Padre Island. Eldawy said the development is aimed at\nluring\nmore permanent and international residents to Galveston, alongside tourists.\nThe project now heads to Galveston City Council, and Eldawy hopes to start construction late next year and deliver the first phase by 2029. That timeline would make Sachs on the Seawall one of the island\u2019s most ambitious developments in decades, positioned across from the luxury Diamond Beach condos and next to the longtime Seahorse Grill. The 236-unit second phase could be completed by 2031, Biegel said.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The single-family home has five bedrooms, a landscaped garden and multiple terraces. Compass\u2019\nTim Malone\nhad the listing. The townhouse last traded in 2017 for just under $6 million.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe West Village saw one of the top commercial transactions recorded in the city. Via an LLC,\nJanus Sendowski\npurchased an almost 26-foot-wide, six-story Federal townhome at\n280 West 11th Street\nfor $13.5 million. The sellers were software engineer\nDavid Shopsin\nand psychoanalyst\nSusannah Falk Lewis\n, who had owned the property since 1991. The nine-bedroom house was once a rental building but now sits vacant. It dates to 1818, when it was one of nine homes built for the clothing merchant Aaron Henry. The building has some 8,000 square feet of living space, along with eight wood-burning fireplaces and access to Bleecker Gardens, a private interior garden. Brown Harris Stevens\u2019\nDavid Kornmeier\nhad the listing.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nA one-story retail/office building and parking lot at\n913 East 108th Street\nin Canarsie sold for $11.4 million. The seller was an affiliate of\nSamuel Sherman\u2019s FSNR Acquisition Group\n, which purchased the 33,000-square-foot property in 2015 for $9.1 million. The buyers were two LLCs tied to\nAbraham Posner.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nIn Flushing, a four-story office building at\n136-81 Roosevelt Avenue\nchanged hands for $10 million. The buyer was a company linked to\nDavid Sutton\n, and the seller was another company tied to\nJoseph Lo\nthat had taken over the property decades ago.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nAt the Madison House in NoMad, which was developed by\nJD Carlisle Development\nand\nFosun International\n,\nSara, Sophia and Thea Do\nscooped up a nearly 3,400-square-foot sponsor unit for $11.4 million. The purchase price works out to about $3,400 per square foot for the four-bedroom condo. The first asking price for the unit, from 2019, was just under $14 million, but the deal went into contract at a listing price of just under $12 million, per StreetEasy. Douglas Elliman\u2019s\nJustin Tuinstra\nhad the listing.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: James and Lindsay Shanahan\noffloaded a condo and a storage unit at\n91 Leonard Street\nin Tribeca for just under $5 million, its asking price. The purchasers were\nRandolph and Tabitha Hickman\n. The Shanahans had owned the unit since 2019, when they bought it for about $4.8 million. The three-bedroom pad spans about 1,800 square feet and has about 460 square feet of private terrace space.

The\nSegerstrom family\n\u2019s development is expected to bring in revenue to the city through taxes and a $9.3 million community benefit payment to the city, Bacerra said.\n\u201cThis project provides housing while also providing much-needed commercial spaces. Santa Ana cannot thrive or survive by only providing the housing for other city workers and other cities\u2019 economic engines,\u201d Bacerra said. \u201cPrevious city leaders did not cultivate this level of economic development. Instead, they chose to force higher sales tax on our residents.\u201d\nUnder the plan, 1,583 residential units, as well as restaurants, retail, offices, bikeways and acres of publicly accessible open space would be constructed at the South Coast Plaza site at 3333 Bristol Street.\n\nThe South Coast Plaza shopping center brings in more than $500,000 annually in tax revenue for the city, according to a city staff\nreport\n. The proposed Village project is estimated to bring in nearly $5.5 million each year in tax revenue. It\u2019s also projected to create around 9,000 jobs, 1,000 of which will be recurring.\nAging and underutilized malls in\nBrea\n, Westminster, Buena Park and Laguna Hills have similarly seen proposals to convert into a mix of retail and homes. Under the state\u2019s housing mandate, cities across Orange County must plan for more than 180,000 new homes by the end of the decade.\nOf those, approximately 40 percent must be designated for lower-income families, according to Voice of OC.

        "content": "A plan to rezone Broadway in Edgewater and Uptown is finally moving forward at Chicago City Hall \u2014 and neighborhood groups are waging all-out campaigns for and against it.\nThe monthslong delayed proposal \u2014 backed by aldermen Angela Clay, Leni Manaa-Hoppenworth and Matt Martin \u2014 would upzone Broadway from Montrose to Devon avenues, allowing denser residential projects and a wider range of commercial uses. The ordinances, introduced in April, have been repeatedly postponed amid fierce community debate but are now slated for an Oct. 14 zoning hearing, Block Club\nreported\n.\nThe area is the\ntarget\nof ongoing infrastructure improvements, particularly the $2.1 billion Red Line modernization, which is expected to be completed\nthis\nyear.\nCommunity shopping district zoning, proposed for the area between Devon and Foster Avenues, would prohibit bars and liquor stores but permit retail and restaurants. The initiative would upzone much of the corridor to neighborhood commercial designations and would pave a way for residential and retail buildings up to seven stories.\nOpposition has been loud in Edgewater, where neighbors pooled funds to hire an attorney and erected two billboards directing passersby to a campaign website, SaveEdgewater.org. Members of the group Edgewater Residents for Responsible Development argue the city\u2019s outreach has been inadequate and say rezoning would eliminate their chance to weigh in on projects case by case. John Holden, president of the Edgewater Historical Society, has been a leading opposition figure.\nSupporters, meanwhile, have mounted a digital push to lobby aldermen. They argue that loosening restrictions will bring housing, affordability and vibrancy to a corridor long dominated by low-rise strip malls.\n\nUnder the plan, most of Broadway in Uptown would shift to zoning that allows buildings up to 80 feet \u2014 generally five to seven stories \u2014 and permits uses from salons to dispensaries. To counter fears of drive-thrus and gas stations, the city says it will layer in a \u201cpedestrian street\u201d designation banning curb cuts and requiring buildings to front the sidewalk, effectively barring strip center development.\nIn\nEdgewater\n, Broadway would be rezoned primarily to allow 80-foot mixed-use buildings with retail below and housing above. A section between Balmoral and Foster would be zoned with a 70-foot cap, after feedback from neighbors concerned about block-scale development.\nMuch of Edgewater\u2019s stretch of Broadway is capped at 50 feet, or about four stories. Opponents argue that raising the ceiling to seven stories or more will flood the market with expensive units while delivering little in the way of affordability. Some are already preparing for a potential legal battle.\nIn Uptown, where\nsimilar\nzoning is already in place, pushback has been muted. Hundreds of apartments have risen along Broadway in recent years, fitting into the neighborhood\u2019s larger wave of redevelopment.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Two Houston investment firms have snapped up a fully-leased office building just south of Chinatown, banking on the staying power of one of the state\u2019s biggest employers.\nFuller Realty and ICP Funds acquired the 133,000-square-foot BlueCross BlueShield Building at 8101 West Sam Houston Parkway South from an affiliate of Denver-based Sagard Real Estate, JLL announced. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Harris Central Appraisal District valued the property at $14.7 million in January, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.\nBlueCross BlueShield of Texas recently signed an 11-year lease for the entire two-story building, which will get a full interior renovation and expanded amenities under the insurer\u2019s tenancy. Developed in 1999, the property has housed a string of major corporate occupiers.\nJLL represented the seller, procured the buyers and arranged a five-year acquisition loan from a regional bank.\n\nJLL\u2019s Kevin McConn said in a statement that Houston ranked fourth nationally in office sales volume for the first half of this year, noting \u201ca generous amount of investor interest with each asset that hits the market.\u201d\nThe acquisition comes amid a surge of office leasing and trading activity on Houston\u2019s west side and in the Energy Corridor, where limited supply of high-quality product has pushed rents up nearly 20 percent in the past year, according to JLL. Since 2022, more than 10 million square feet has been leased in the area, bolstering landlord confidence even as\nsome legacy properties face distress\n.\nRecent trades include U.S. Property Management\u2019s purchase of a\nvacant Schlumberger building\n, at 4646 W. Sam Houston Parkway North in Wolff Companies\u2019 Westway Park, and Wu Properties\u2019 purchase of\nWoodlake Plaza\n, a 106,000-square-foot office building at 2600 S.

Formerly known as Banyan Bay Apartments, the property has been renamed Legacy at Coconut Creek, Vizzda states.\nLegacy partially financed the purchase with a $64.4 million loan from Truist Bank. The deal breaks down to $185,096 per apartment.\nThe seller, an affiliate of Chicago-based\nNuveen Real Estate\n, sold the complex for more than triple the previous sale price nearly three decades ago. In 1999, Nuveen paid $25 million for the 25.6-acre community, records show. The firm is the investment arm for New York-based Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America (TIAA).\n\nBuilt in 1985, Legacy at Coconut Creek consists of 19 three-story buildings and four one-story buildings. The community has a mix of one- and two-bedroom apartments ranging in size from 799 square feet to 1,220 square feet, with monthly rents at $1,750 to $2,400 a month, according to Apartments.com.\nNuveen, led by Mike Sales, is an active player in South Florida\u2019s multifamily market as a seller and a loan provider. Last month, the firm provided a\n$72 million\nloan to Atlanta-based Acre that refinanced previous debt secured by Adela at MiMo Bay, a five-story apartment building with 236 units in Miami\u2019s Upper Eastside neighborhood.\nIn July, Nuveen sold a 358-unit apartment complex near Miami Lakes for\n$93.5 million.\nLegacy manages and operates more than 6,500 multifamily units, with an additional 3,400 units under development, according to the firm\u2019s website. In April, Legacy and CD Group sold a 50-acre development site near Florida City to Freehold Capital Management for\n$31.6 million\n. The joint venture previously planned to build 309 rental townhouses.",

She currently runs Blackstone Mortgage Trust, the firm\u2019s publicly traded commercial real estate lending arm, and co-leads its $77 billion debt business. Tim Johnson, Blackstone\u2019s global real estate debt chief, will step into her BXMT role.\nKeenan, who joined Blackstone in 2012 and was close with LePatner, called the appointment bittersweet.\n\u201cShe cared\ndeeply\nabout this business, and I\u2019m going to be doing my best to help honor her legacy,\u201d Keenan told the outlet.\nLaunched in 2017, BREIT quickly became Blackstone\u2019s largest fund, amassing assets such as data centers, e-commerce warehouses and housing during a period of rock-bottom rates. Rising interest rates and sagging property values spurred many investors to sell\nstarting\nin 2022, however, dragging performance. Over the past three years, BREIT returned just 1.7 percent annually, far below its 9.2 percent lifetime return.\nExecutives now argue the market is stabilizing. Decreasing construction costs have led to more limited supply, debt financing has loosened and cash flows are improving across asset classes. BREIT has logged eight straight months of gains and raised $1.1 billion in the second quarter \u2014 its strongest fundraising haul in more than two years \u2014 as withdrawal requests eased.\n\nNadeem Meghji, Blackstone\u2019s global real estate co-head, told the outlet that the fund functioned as designed through a volatile period, adding that Keenan is the right choice to guide the trust through its next growth phase.\nLePatner, 43, was fatally\nshot\nalong with three others when a gunman opened fire in Blackstone\u2019s Midtown lobby at 345 Park Avenue. Authorities said the attacker, who later took his own life, had targeted the NFL, another tenant in the building. LePatner also headed Blackstone\u2019s core-plus real estate business and joined Blackstone in 2014 following a decade in Goldman Sachs\u2019 real estate division.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

About 700 more townhouses and 500 more condos were for sale last month compared to a year prior, representing bumps of 30 percent and 39 percent, respectively. Listings for detached homes increased at 22 percent.\nAlthough conditions are increasingly favoring buyers, the median home price was flat in August for the first time in months at $340,000. Houston registered lowering prices from March to July. Nationally, the median home price rose by more than 2 percent year-over-year last month to $389,000, putting Houston well within reach of a\nbuyer\u2019s market\n, said CoStar director of market analytics Itziar Aguirre.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s recent interest rate cut\nwill encourage more buyer interest, Aguirre said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing houses sit on the market longer. We\u2019re seeing prices go down, especially in the condo market. And, mortgage rates, while they\u2019re still high, they\u2019re actually at the lowest they\u2019ve been in about a year,\u201d Aguirre said.\nHouston\u2019s record-setting inventory follows years of breakneck building. The city issued\nover 230,000 building permits\nbetween 2020 and 2023, surpassing every other city in the country. It issued\nover 11,000 permits\nin January and February, which amounted to 6 percent of activity in the 150 biggest cities in the country, and almost 37 percent of permits issued in Texas.\n\u201cI would say there\u2019s probably a bit of market correction going on since Houston saw significant price appreciation from 2020 to 2022,\u201d Aguirre added.\n",

New market entrants are eligible for up to $60,000 per year for four years, but the\nMiami Beach City Commission\ncan vote to waive the cap for applicants. Playboy, which has around 250 employees, has applied for $200,000 per year for four years, the outlet reported.\n\nIf the incentives are not awarded by Dec. 31, Playboy can terminate its lease. Rivani can also choose to grant the incentives in the form of a $200,000 per year rent abatement for four years. If he decides against it, Playboy can move forward with termination.\nRivani bought the seven-story mixed-use building formerly known as The Lincoln for\n$62.5 million\nlast year. He is currently in the process of a $40 million renovation of the building. The filing revealed additional details about his lease terms with Playboy, including that the brand is set to pay $2.1 million in first year\u2019s rent. The base rent will increase 3 percent annually, and the final year of the lease rent will be nearly $2.9 million. The lease can also be extended by five years two times.\nThe brand\u2019s relocation plans extend far beyond the 10-year lease it signed with Rivani. It is also planning a content studio, a private Playboy Club with a restaurant and communal spaces inspired by the Playboy Mansion. The company expects to create 75 full-time jobs with an average annual wage of $175,000, the outlet reported.\n\u2013\u2013\nKate Hinsche",

        "content": "The state\u2019s push for housing density, along with the need for new homes post-wildfires is driving demand for Airbnb spinoff\nSamara\n\u2019s prefab homes, which landed a $34 million investment this week.\nThe company was started by Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia and former Flex CEO Mike McNamara in 2016. Factory-made homes, or panelized housing, is taking off in places such as the Palisades and Altadena, as builders and homeowners look to alternative materials that speed up timelines to getting back home.\n\u201cWe expect LA to pick up quite a bit on the back of the fires and because of the products that we\u2019re deploying there,\u201d McNamara, Samara\u2019s CEO, told\nThe Real Deal\nthis week, after his firm announced the $34 million Series B closing led by Thrive Capital.\nSamara turned heads in February when it partnered with Rick Caruso\u2019s nonprofit\nSteadfast LA\nto help expedite the recovery timeline. As part of that, Gebbia donated $15 million toward giving homes to fire survivors without the means to rebuild their homes.\nAt least 100 homes are expected to be built through that partnership, and a separate organization is handling recipient selection. A \u201chandful\u201d of homeowners have so far been identified in Pasadena and Altadena, and Samara is assisting them with permitting, McNamara said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a careful process that our partner is going through,\u201d said McNamara, who was unable to provide a figure on how many property owners have been selected. \u201cThey do want to make sure that we\u2019re gifting it to people that need it most. So, the process takes a little bit of time.\u201d\nThe installations take four to six weeks. Factoring in site preparation and utility hookups, the whole process takes two to three months. The first recipients\u2019 homes are expected to be in the ground by the end of the year.\nThe company\u2019s analysis of homes destroyed found that 600 spanned 1,000 square feet or less in Altadena, McNamara said. That\u2019s the sweet spot for Samara, which has a 950-square-foot model called the XL 10 with two bedrooms and two bathrooms.\n\nOther prefab players in the market include\nHapi Homes\n, which was in the design stage with 30 clients in Altadena and Pasadena as of August. RSG 3-D said 40 to 50 homeowners were working with architects expected to use the company\u2019s panelized materials to rebuild.\nADUs to boost multifamily\nRebuilding is one area of growth for Samara, but multifamily is ramping up the fastest as state and local policies shift in favor of adding density and increasing the housing supply.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been a continuous change in regulatory policy in California that they\u2019re allowing more and more of this density,\u201d McNamara said.\nA raft of changes this year have carved out exceptions in building codes in efforts to speed rebuilding.\nThat kicked off with January\u2019s executive order from Gov. Gavin Newsom which allows an\nADU\nto be installed even without the primary home being issued a certificate of occupancy. The point is to make it easier to get impacted residents into housing while they rebuild their primary residences.\nBoosting multifamily are laws such as Senate Bill 684, which was effective last July, and Senate Bill 1123, rolled out this July. Both cut the environmental review required under the\nCalifornia Environmental Quality Act\nfor housing projects on qualifying lots in a bid to reduce the red tape around permitting.\nAs a result, Samara\u2019s seen plenty of work from multifamily owners, ranging from mom-and-pop businesses to large corporations with thousands of units in their portfolio.\n",

        "content": "Rubicon Point Partners added another Bay Area multifamily asset to its portfolio.\nThe San Francisco-based real estate investment firm acquired the 203-unit Madelon apartments in the Mission District, Multi-Housing News\nreported\n. Rubicon bought the property from JRE Partners for $119.3 million with the help of an $81 million loan from Equitable Insurance Company. The price works out to $399,000 per unit.\nThe market-rate residential building, at 2823 18th Street, has studio, one- and two-bedroom units with an average rent of $3,812 per month. Amenities include in-unit laundry, a fitness center, a clubhouse, a rooftop terrace and a lounge, as well as 9,000 square feet of ground-floor retail. The property was 99 percent leased as of last month.\nRubicon made the purchase using its Rubicon Point II fund, which was designed to provide the company with the means to invest in distressed assets across the Bay Area. Rubicon has been looking into distressed properties and purchasing them at a lower rate than previous sales, per Multi-Housing News.\nThe ongoing artificial intelligence boom has been a factor in Rubicon\u2019s ramping up of its multifamily purchases, according to Multi-Housing News. A recent\nreport\nfrom CBRE backs up those hopes, with the firm predicting that more than 50,000 people could flock to the city to work in the growing AI sector.\n\nA handful of other multifamily properties in the Bay Area have traded hands in recent weeks.\nEarlier this week, Bridge Housing acquired the\nCanyon Ridge at Napa Junction\ncommunity in American Canyon in a $57 million deal. The Oakland-based firm picked up the 148-unit property from The Reliant Group with a 10-year $35 million acquisition loan from Capital One.\nPrior to that, an affiliate of Acacia Capital\npurchased the Waymark\napartments in Walnut Creek for $190 million. The 385-unit community was sold by developers Blake Griggs Properties and Transit Village Associates and features studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom units.\nBesides the Madelon multifamily property, Rubicon Point is the owner of the Fitzgerald apartments at 2750 19th Street in San Francisco.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Terms of the deal weren\u2019t disclosed, but the property was valued at $52.3 million this year, appraisal district records show.\nFortress\n, which was founded in New York and has\nlately been investing in North Texas\n, has owned the 656-unit property since 2021.\nEastgrove Apartments, built in 1984, offers one- and two-bedroom apartments as well as a pool, gym, tennis court and clubhouse. It\u2019s about 14 miles northeast of Dallas, close to the Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway, the partial outer loop around Dallas.\nThornberg\u2019s LinkedIn profile identifies that he\u2019s president of Michigan-based Investors Equity Group and a managing member at A &amp; A Equities and Thornberg Equity Group, both based in Michigan.\n\nThere\u2019s not much information about his real estate activity online, but BizTimes Milwaukee reported that he purchased a Milwaukee apartment complex in June for nearly $58 million. Thornburg also aimed to develop high-end apartments in Lansing, Michigan, in 2016, the Lansing State Journal\nreported\n, but it doesn\u2019t look like the project got off the ground.\nMeanwhile, Fortress has been\nexpanding its multifamily portfolio in San Francisco\n, where it acquired six apartment complexes for $32.9 million this spring.\nIt\u2019s a tough time to be a\nmultifamily operator\nin Dallas. The historic glut of deliveries that came online in the last two years pushed rental rates and occupancy levels down.\nIn May, Dallas-Fort Worth reported a 1.5 percent decrease in rents, year-over-year, according to Yardi Matrix. The Metroplex\u2019s occupancy rate of 92.6 percent put it at third-lowest among the country\u2019s 30 largest cities.\nIndustry experts hope the development slowdown will jumpstart the market and push rents back into the black by next year.\n",

        "content": "Rabbi Shmuley Boteach lost his bid to toss out a defamation lawsuit accusing him of smearing Billionaire Jeff Soffer\u2019s Fontainebleau Miami Beach.\nOn Sept. 16, U.S. District Judge Michael Moore denied Boteach\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint, filed by the affiliate of Soffer\u2019s Aventura-based\nFontainebleau Development\nthat owns the iconic waterfront resort at 4441 Collins Avenue. The hotel\u2019s ownership entity is seeking punitive damages against Boteach, whose real name is Jacob Shmuel Botach.\nIn its December 2024 federal complaint, Fontainebleau Miami Beach alleges\nBoteach\nspent weeks falsely accusing the 1,504-key hotel\u2019s owner and staff on his social media accounts of condoning antisemitism after he was kicked out following a verbal altercation he had with another resort guest over the Gaza War.\nA book author and social media influencer with 1.2 million followers on multiple platforms, Boteach bills himself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Rabbi\u201d and \u201cthe most famous rabbi in America.\u201d\n\u201cThe court\u2019s 13-page order speaks for itself,\u201d Sean Burstyn, principal of Burstyn Law representing Fontainebleau Miami Beach, told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cThe misconduct described therein is egregious, and we\u2019re fully confident that the jury will see it that way.\u201d\n\nJohn Benford, an attorney representing Boteach, declined comment.\nIn addition to denying Boteach\u2019s motion to dismiss, Judge Moore also rejected the rabbi\u2019s request that some of Fontainebleau\u2019s allegations be stricken from the court record. Among the allegations Boteach wanted removed included Fontainebleau\u2019s claim that the rabbi \u201cintensified his calls for the public to boycott the hotel on the basis\u2026that the hotel obstructed a police investigation into heinous statements hurled at him.\u201d\nBoteach\u2019s beef with\nFontainebleau Miami Beach\nstems from his argument with another hotel guest, a man of Arab descent, on Dec. 2, 2024, court filings show. The two men filmed each other while hurling insults. In a video clip uploaded to Boteach\u2019s Instagram account, the man called the rabbi a \u201c\u201cF*king baby killer.\u201d\nThe\nFontainebleau Miami Beach\ncomplaint alleges that Boteach\u2019s video did not include the rabbi making comments about suicide bombers and telling the other guest, \u201cAllahu Akbar? Are you going to blow yourself up or something?\u201d The lawsuit acknowledged that the other guest made heinous comments and \u201cother words that are easily interpreted as anti-Semitic.\u201d\nFontainebleau Miami Beach\u2019s management condemned the other man\u2019s behavior with a public statement shortly after the incident happened, the lawsuit noted. Boteach and the other guest were both banned from the resort.",

Scott Wiener with the goal of addressing the state\u2019s affordable housing crisis by allowing developers to construct larger multi-unit residential buildings near transit stops.\nThe bill would permit the construction of up to nine stories for buildings adjacent to certain bus stops and train stations, seven stories for buildings within a quarter-mile of the stops and six stories for buildings within a half-mile. Single-family neighborhoods within a half-mile of transit stops would be subject to the new zoning rules.\nLos Angeles\nMayor Karen Bass\nisn\u2019t too hot on the\ndensity-increasing legislation\n. On Wednesday, Bass appealed directly to Newsom asking him to veto the bill, Larchmont Buzz\nreported\n.\n\u201cWhile I support the intent to accelerate housing development statewide, as written, Senate Bill 79 risks significant unintended consequences for many of Los Angeles\u2019 diverse communities,\u201d Bass wrote.\n\nAt issue is the perceived state control of local zoning decisions.\n\u201cWe must create more housing near transit hubs and areas with access to jobs, education, and amenities. We must streamline the production of housing for all Angelenos. However, we must do so in a way that does not erode local control, diminish community input on planning and zoning, and disproportionately impact low-resource neighborhoods,\u201d Bass wrote in her letter to the governor. \u201cThe City of Los Angeles has already made substantial efforts to align with state housing goals and increase housing development citywide, and will continue to do so.\u201d\nUnder the amended bill, counties with more than 15 high-frequency train or bus stops would be eligible for the upzoning. That touches just seven counties across the state: Alameda, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara. An amendment to legislation gave\nContra Costa County\na pass from the upzoning.\nNewsom has until Oct. 13 to decide whether to sign, veto or do nothing with SB 79.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Inland bought the property for $154 million in 2006 before the Great Recession led to several store closings and ultimately Inland\u2019s default.\nThe Red Mountain venture spent the last few years on a $30 million plan to bring the once struggling shopping center back to life.\nThe California-based company quickly attracted new tenants including The Fresh Market, Bob\u2019s Discount Furniture and a Twin Peaks restaurant.

Ticona tapped Douglas Elliman Development Marketing to lead sales for the project, and prices start at $500,000. Construction is expected to finish in 2028, a spokesperson confirmed.\n\nEdge House marks the latest addition to\na stacked pipeline of short-term rental projects\nin Miami-Dade County, where such projects make up half of all planned residential projects.\nTicona\nis also a newcomer in the ultra-competitive\nEdgewater\nneighborhood, where thousands of condo units are in the works. But he may have found a sweet spot.\n\u201cIn Edgewater, I don\u2019t know anyone else who is doing short-term rentals,\u201d Cervera Real Estate commercial broker Francesco Canestri told\nTRD\nlast year. \u201cWhat William [Ticona] is offering is something no one on the south end of the neighborhood is offering. That is the strategy.\u201d\nIn an interview last year, Ticona said he wanted to be where the competition was.\n\u201cEdgewater is a very hot zone,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere our competitors are is where our customers are. We want to be in areas that have the most development.\u201d\nLast year, he bought another residential development site in the neighborhood for\n$15.1 million\n. The property is zoned for a 36-story tower with either 124 units or 248 hotel rooms.",

        "content": "Related Midwest\u2019s 62-acre South Loop site The 78 is one step closer to approval and with it, Chicago Fire FC is approaching a Soldier Field exit.\nThe Chicago Plan Commission on Thursday approved rezoning for Related Midwest\u2019s 62-acre South Loop site, advancing plans for a $750 million, privately\nfinanced\nstadium at The 78 that would anchor an $8 billion mixed-use campus, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The 22,000-seat venue, targeted for completion by the 2028 season, would be the centerpiece of a long-stalled development that Related Midwest CEO Curt Bailey has been pitching since 2016.\nBailey told commissioners the project is a signal Chicago is \u201cback in so many ways,\u201d predicting thousands of jobs and a Wrigleyville-style entertainment district around the stadium. Fire\nowner\nJoe Mansueto would buy roughly 10 acres of the site for the stadium, while Related would retain control of surrounding development, including plans for 5,000-plus apartments, part of a multi-phased mixed-use district along the Chicago River south of Roosevelt Road, between the South Loop and Chinatown.\nThe rezoning still needs City Council zoning committee and full Council approval.\nAlderman Pat Dowell represents the 3rd Ward, where The 78 would be located. Dowel reiterated her\nbacking\nduring Thursday\u2019s meeting, calling the project exciting for the city and the 3rd Ward. She said her support is contingent on the Fire\u2019s stadium being the only stadium at the site \u2014 a reference to Related\u2019s parallel talks with the White Sox about relocating from Guaranteed Rate Field. The rezoning amendment approved Thursday includes language limiting The 78 to a single stadium unless new approvals are sought.\nThe Sox, who\nfloated\na ballpark concept for the site last year, have said they are keeping \u201call options open.\u201d\nTraffic and transit remain a sticking point. A study commissioned by the Fire and Related found game-day congestion would be less severe than weekday rush hour. The project caps large-scale events at 45 annually, including 17 Fire home matches.\n\n25th Ward Alderman Byron Sigcho-Lopez pressed for more community feedback, warning against rushing a massive redevelopment. Dowell countered that nine community meetings had been held and argued the city shouldn\u2019t stall a private investment on land that\u2019s sat vacant for half a century.\nStill is how much public money will be needed to upgrade infrastructure around the stadium. Related\u2019s 2019 redevelopment agreement called for up to $551 million in tax-increment financing for roads, bridges and transit, but Bailey has said a revised deal would trim costs by scrapping plans for a new CTA Red Line station and Metra track realignment.\nCity planning officials said talks over TIF reimbursements are in the early stages. Any revised agreement would need sign-off from the Community Development Commission and City Council Finance Committee \u2014 which Dowell chairs, giving her significant leverage over how much taxpayer support flows to the 78.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A state agency cleared the way for Muslim-focused master-planned community\nEPIC City\nto proceed, ending one chapter in the high-profile political push to stop the project.\nThe Texas Workforce Commission settled a Fair Housing Act complaint against Community Capital Partners, the developer of EPIC City, The Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. The agency dismissed the complaint this week after the firm agreed to new housing policies, staff training and five years of compliance reporting. The developer admitted no wrongdoing.\nAs part of the deal, Community Capital Partners must udpate its sales and marketing materials, adopt nondiscriminatory housing standards and avoid using any applicant criteria not tied directly to business necessity. The firm is also required to implement written fair housing procedures subject to state approval.\nDespite the regulatory scrutiny, Community Capital Partners said it is forging ahead with the $400 million, 402-acre project near Josephine in Collin and Hunt counties. Plans call for more than 1,000 homes alongside a mosque, K-12 Islamic school, apartments, senior housing, retail, healthcare clinics, sports facilities and a community college.\n\u201cWe welcomed the opportunity to take a deep dive into the Fair Housing Act,\u201d Imran Chaudhary, the developer\u2019s president, said in a statement, framing the settlement as a chance to strengthen the project.\nThe resolution comes after political attacks on EPIC City reached a fever pitch this spring, during the Texas legislative session. Governor Greg Abbott has repeatedly accused the group of trying to create \u201cSharia compounds\u201d and said as many as a dozen agencies are investigating.\n\nBut, so far, the attacks have fallen flat. The\nU.S. Department of Justice closed\nits own civil rights investigation into the project in June.\nAbbott, however, signaled the state isn\u2019t finished, keeping EPIC City at the center of a culture-war flashpoint that has now bled into real estate development.\nHe\nsigned a new law\nover the summer \u2014 House Bill 4211 \u2014 aimed at blocking the business structure behind EPIC City, a move the developers and their attorney blasted as fearmongering.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nauseating to my very core that an elected official \u2026 is lying to Texans,\u201d attorney Dan Cogdell told the outlet.\nThe law requires new disclosure and ownership rules for business entities selling interest in shared real estate ventures. The law was\nauthored\nby Rep. Candy Noble, a Republican from the Collin County town of Lucas.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The buyers plan on redeveloping\nGalleria Fort Lauderdale\nwith detailed plans to be unveiled in the combining months, a press release states.\nGalbut called the property \u201can incredible site\u201d that\u2019s two blocks from the ocean.\n\u201cA transaction like this comes about once in a lifetime,\u201d he told\nTRD\n. \u201cWe\u2019re going to reinvent the mall and make it magical like all of the other projects we work on.\u201d\nA source told\nTRD\nthe partnership paid at least $90 million for the property. The partnership declined to comment on the price.\nThe deal marks another redevelopment play for builders\ntargeting older shopping centers\n. In Cutler Bay, Electra America and BH Group are redeveloping portions of Southland Mall into the\n$1 billion\nSouthplace City Center. The planned mixed-use project could ultimately have 4,395 apartments and condos, a 150-room hotel, 60,000 square feet of medical office space, 150,000 square feet of retail outparcels and a community amphitheater.\nA CBRE team led by Robert Given and Brad Capas marketed Galleria on behalf of the seller, Keystone-Florida Holding Corporation, led by president William O\u2019Connor. In 1993, Keystone-Florida paid $25.1 million for Galleria Fort Lauderdale.\n\nThe mall hit the market in 2023 with a targeted sale price of more than\n$100 million\n.

The joint venture\u2019s purchase did not include a Dillard\u2019s department store building, which is separately owned, and a Macy\u2019s store that has a ground lease.\nKeystone-Florida\nunsuccessfully tried to redevelop Galeria Fort Lauderdale twice, most recently in 2022. The firm proposed a mixed-use project with at least 1,900 apartments on the 31.6-acre site. But the city of Fort Lauderdale did not approve it.\nThe property\u2019s current zoning allows for 60 units per acre, or a maximum of 1,899 units. The maximum height for buildings is 150 feet.\nKatherine Kallergis contributed reporting.\n",

The scale is unusual even for East Lake Shore Drive, where developer John Buck and his wife\noffloaded\ntheir 21-room co-op this spring at $4.9 million \u2014 less than half their original $11.5 million ask. Like the Bucks, the Farleys slashed their price before heading toward a deal, originally listing the 15-room, 14th floor apartment for just under $16 million in 2023. The most recent price\nslash\non the listing was in June.\nA sale is contingent, and a reminder that East Lake Shore Drive still commands top-dollar cachet,\nafter\nsome price-chopping. Jeff Lowe, the Compass agent who represented the sellers, said active interest in the property spiked this summer after the price chop. The property was put under contract Sept. 16.\nBill Farley, financier and former CEO of Fruit of the Loom, who now runs private equity firm Liam Ventures, told the Chicago Tribune in 2023 that the apartment is situated for lakeside views.\n\u201cThe ceilings are 11-feet high. There are these huge windows, and, of course, there are no obstructions, and these views are incredible, not just for Chicago but for any major city in America,\u201d Farley told the outlet.\nThe apartment also features six fireplaces, a custom-paneled library, an office, family room and a temperature-controlled wine room, as well as a gym, two guest apartments and four garage spaces.\n\nFarley, 82, was a larger-than-life CEO whose 15-year run atop Fruit of the Loom made him a staple of Chicago business lore. The New York Times once dubbed him the \u201chunky chief executive\u201d after he starred in his own underwear ads and floated political ambitions. At its peak, Fruit of the Loom was a $2 billion brand, but Farley was ousted in 1999 amid questions over lavish pay and poor factory oversight.\nThe Farleys previously owned, though never personally occupied, a 9,000-square-foot rehabbed Gold Coast mansion at the corner of Burton Place and Astor Street. The couple also keep a residence in Kennebunkport, Maine.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A three-story Greek revival mansion on Belvedere Island known as Locksley Hall has sold for $43.5 million, according to property records, or roughly $4,710 per square foot.\nThe 9,200-square-foot home, at 440 Golden Gate Avenue, went for $4 million less than the Marin County record price it last notched in 2015.\nThe seller is listed as Golden Gate Holdings LLC, and the buyer as Belvedere IFP Properties LLC.\nBefore selling the house in August 2015, mining magnate Robert Friedland and his wife, Darlene, spent 10 years and more than $30 million renovating the house, according to\nMarin Independent Journal\nand notes from the website of\nNeal Ward\n, now with Compass, who marketed the property in 2015. The couple sold the house for $47.5 million, which was less than the $49 million asking price, but it was believed to be the\nmost-expensive\nresidential transaction of all time in Marin County.\n\nBuilt in 1895 by a wealthy San Francisco banker, C.O. Perry, the home has five bedrooms and 8.5 bathrooms, a rose-cutting garden and a swimming pool with a vine-covered pergola. It features unobstructed 270-degree views of the San Francisco city skyline, the Golden Gate and Bay bridges, Angel Island and the bay.\nThe home\u2019s 9,235 square feet includes 8,155 square feet in the main residence, a 600-foot guest house and a 480-square-foot pool house, per floor plans on Ward\u2019s website.\n\u201cPeople in that price range are looking for specific things,\u201d Matt Hughes, president of the Marin Association of Realtors in 2015, told the Marin Independent Journal that year. \u201cLocksley is appealing because of its historic significance and its tax status.\u201d\nLocksley was restored to historical standards, qualifying it for the California Mills Act property tax reduction program, Hughes said.\n",

        "content": "The Austin suburb of Taylor is getting another infusion of cash into its $17 billion Samsung project, this time in the form of a state grant.\nThe company received a $250 million Texas Semiconductor Innovation Fund grant for the facility it\u2019s building in Taylor; the funding will support the ongoing development of the multibillion dollar chipmaking plant and nearby residential projects. Buildout of the campus will support about 12,000 construction jobs and bring more than 3,500 manufacturing jobs once the plant is up and running within the next five years, Connect CRE\nreported\n.\nIn 2021, the South Korean company announced that its\nsecond U.S. factory\nwould be in Taylor \u2014 a town of about 18,000 some 34 miles north of Austin in Williamson County. Since then, the prospect of the 6-million-square-foot factory has spurred\nresidential and commercial development\nin the area, known as the \u201c\nSamsung effect\n.\u201d\nAt the time, about\n$981 million in incentives\nfrom local and state authorities were used to lure the factory, including a 30-year property-tax abatement from the city. Samsung will still pay Taylor a projected $52 million in taxes, which will go into the city general fund. The company will also invest in about $6 million in buildings and $11 million in machinery in the town.\nAccording to a news release from Governor Greg Abbott\u2019s office, the state grant will help support \u201ca more secure domestic supply of chips for critical U.S. industries.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith approximately $40 billion invested in Texas, Samsung is helping to cement Texas\u2019 position as the leading state for semiconductor manufacturing, bringing in more business investment to Texas communities and creating thousands of good-paying jobs for hardworking Texans,\u201d Abbott said.\nAbbott signed the Texas CHIPS Act into law in 2023. The legislation established the grant program, aimed at growing the state\u2019s efforts in semiconductor design, research and manufacturing.\nWork on the facility should be complete in 2026.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Wednesday was an unparalleled day in recent memory of New York City real estate news.\nThe morning began with the bust-up of two casino bids in Manhattan. First, a Community Advisory Committee\nvoted 4-2\nto disapprove SL Green\u2019s pitch for a $5.4 billion casino in Times Square, meaning the proposal will not move on to the final round of the state\u2019s casino licensing competition.\nAfter the meeting was over, SL Green CEO Marc Holliday stood up and chastised the committee members, besides those appointed by the mayor and governor, the sole yes votes.\n\u201cWhat you did here today was a despicable display of cowardice, lack of leadership, lack of consideration for all the people who would benefit from this proposal,\u201d Holliday shouted at the members as they filed out of the room.\nMoments later, Holliday\u2019s firm was joined in rejection by Silverstein Properties.\nA six-member Community Advisory Committee\nrejected\nits proposal for a casino at a \u201cgiant hole in the ground\u201d on 41st Street and 11th Avenue, in a 4 to 2 vote.\nSilverstein, alongside Rush Street Gaming and Greenwood Gaming &amp; Entertainment, pitched the Avenir, a $7 billion casino complex planned for a long-vacant site. The project would have featured a 1,000-key Hyatt Hotel, as well as restaurants, bars and a 150-seat entertainment venue.\nThe developer also promised to fund the conversion of offices into 2,000 units of housing.\nThe dual rejections leave Soloviev Group as the lone casino competitor in Manhattan \u2014 the developer is slated to get a date before its CAC within the week.\n\nWednesday morning also brought the drama surrounding real estate investment trust Paramount Group to the forefront.\nRithm Capital\nagreed to acquire\nParamount Group for $1.6 billion, with plans to purchase the major office landlord\u2019s outstanding shares at $6.60 per diluted share.\nThe acquisition is a significant bet on the resurgence of office values, with Rithm CEO Michael Nierenberg expressing optimism about the office market and anticipated interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (more on that later).\nBut the deal comes amidst controversy surrounding Paramount Group\u2019s CEO, Albert Behler, including an SEC investigation into undisclosed payments and concerns about executive compensation and conflicts of interest.\nThe craze of the morning gave way to an afternoon with the development most likely to affect the largest swath of the industry: an interest rate cut.\nThe Federal Reserve\ncut its benchmark interest rate\nby a quarter point, the first such cut in nine months, though it was not as drastic as President Donald Trump desired.\nAhead of the meeting, real estate industry players aired their hopes that lower rates could stimulate commercial transactions and help address the housing affordability crisis.\nWhile mortgage rates recently dropped, they do not directly follow the Fed\u2019s interest rate changes and it\u2019s uncertain how much further they will fall.\nAnd all of that unfolded over the course of a few hours. Who said Wednesdays were boring?\n",

The purchaser was\nSimon Dushinsky\u2019s Rabsky Group\n, which earlier this year dropped almost $58 million on a neighboring lot at 360 Broadway, or 65 Franklin Street. Rabsky recently secured\n$320 million in construction financing\nfrom G4 Capital Partners for its development, a 280,000-square-foot condo project.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nIn the Concourse section of the Bronx, the\nBowery Residents\u2019 Committee\npaid $33.1 million to purchase three apartment complexes at\n1097 and 1177 Walton Avenue\nand\n1245 Findlay Avenue\n.

        "content": "New Yorkers have rent stabilization on the brain.\nIt\u2019s dominated headlines since the race for the city\u2019s next mayor kicked off last year, and\nZohran Mamdani\ncemented\nfreezing rents at these properties as a core tenet\nof his campaign ahead of his shock upset to clinch the\nDemocratic primary\n.\nMore New Yorkers are starting to wrap their heads around stabilization \u2014 a concept many outsiders long confused with ever-elusive rent-controlled units, a la Monica Geller\u2019s massive Greenwich Village apartment in \u201cFriends\u201d \u2014 and more are on the hunt to secure their own piece of the pie.\nData from OpenIgloo found that the share of users filtering for rent-stabilized apartment listings increased from just 10 percent in the summer months of 2024 to 35 percent the same time this year.\nThe platform recently launched its\nown map\nof rent-stabilized properties, which it claims is the first of its kind to track rent-regulated housing stock. Others are also jumping in on the action, including a startup called Realer Estate, which uses an algorithm to identify apartments that are likely rent-stabilized.\nFor lifelong or well-seasoned New Yorkers, the conversation about rent stabilization and its prevalence across the five boroughs is likely nothing new. Finding and keeping affordable apartments in a city that only continues to get more expensive (a bacon, egg and cheese in Manhattan can now run $11.50, according to\none Reddit user\n) is a quest many are all too familiar with.\nThe renewed conversation about rent-stabilization arising from the mayoral race is likely catching a fresh crop of New Yorkers (potentially transplants from other cities) up to the idea, especially as market-rate rents\ncontinue to rise\n.\nRent-burdened residents on the lookout for their own sweet deal might look to\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\ncoverage and see finding the rent-regulated apartment is only half the battle \u2014 what condition it will be in over your years of living in it is another, as rent-stabilized owners are\ngrappling with rising costs\nand falling income, making it difficult to keep up with necessary improvements.\nNot so fast\u2026\nThough Manhattan\u2019s trophy market is tumbling, luxury business in the suburbs is on the up-and-up.\n\nEarlier this week, hotelier Ian Schrager, known as the co-founder of Studio 54, listed his 12-acre estate in Westchester County for\n$7.5 million\n, up from its $5 million purchase price more than a decade ago.\nSchrager is seeking to offload the property on the tails of a hot streak in the tri-state area, which logged a three-year record deal in New Jersey, a top-dollar trade in the Hamptons and a boom in trophy sales in Greenwich, Connecticut.\nIn the wealthy enclave of Alpine, a Versailles-inspired mansion sold last week for\nnearly $18 million\n, marking the priciest deal in New Jersey since 2022. The deal for the seven-bedroom home grabbed headlines even though it fell short of its initial asking price of $25 million when it hit the market four years ago.\nIn East Hampton, video game developer Matthew Karch dropped\n$32 million\non an oceanfront home on Lily Pond Lane. The deal marked the first for the property since the sellers, Norman and Helene Stark, bought it for $5 million in 1994. The Starks originally sought $75 million for the two-acre estate in 2017, though they later cut the asking price to $39 million.\nMeanwhile, Greenwich\u2019s luxury market\nlogged 25 deals\nexceeding $10 million since the start of the year, the most recorded since 1999. With so many sales already on the books this year, some anticipate the affluent Connecticut town could double its total from last year by the end of 2025.\nHowever, Manhattan\u2019s luxury market is charting a different course. Last week, the borough saw\njust 11 homes\nasking $4 million or more enter contract with zero of the properties asking more than $10 million. The slump came after four weeks of declining totals, though the Labor Day holiday likely contributed to the drop off.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe priciest deal to land in city records this week was for a co-op on the Upper East Side, which traded for $18 million. Investor Steven Wisch and his wife, filmmaker Debra Wisch, sold Unit 10 at\n1125 Fifth Avenue\n, where actress Bette Midler and Disney\u2019s Bob Iger once owned apartments, to a trust tied to a Westport, Connecticut, address.\nThe full-floor co-op spans roughly 4,600 square feet and has four bedrooms and four bathrooms. Douglas Elliman\u2019s Sabrina Saltiel had the listing.\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s a strange day when a state agency proposes a court order restricting itself.\nBut that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened at the Office of Cannabis Management, in a situation that lays bare the mismanagement and ineptitude at the heart of New York\u2019s dispensary rollout.\nNew Yorkers often complain about bureaucratic incompetence, but OCM seems to have other agencies beat.\nIn its most recent scandal, the office came out and said it had been enforcing the law incorrectly. As a result, 152 planned or approved cannabis dispensaries may have to close or relocate. Eighty-four percent of those are in New York City.\nAt issue was how the office had been measuring the distance between dispensaries and schools and other locations. Instead of measuring from the property line, as required by law, OCM had been measuring from the front entrance.\n\u201cWhen I found out about it, I was very angry, to say the least,\u201d Gov. Kathy Hochul\nsaid last month\n. \u201cThat\u2019s a major screw up.\u201d\nA group of affected dispensaries, including nonprofit darling Housing Works, sued OCM and the Cannabis Control Board to stop the change. A judge denied the motion for a temporary restraining order without explanation.\nThat brings us up to last week, when state attorneys for OCM, clearly feeling the heat, proposed an order granting the plaintiffs\u2019 preliminary injunction.\n\u201cPlease order us to go back to the old standards,\u201d the attorneys are essentially saying. As of Friday at 4 p.m., the order has not been signed.\nIt\u2019s possible that the office is negotiating a settlement with the plaintiffs. OCM and its lawyers at the attorney general\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nIf you\u2019ve been following the cannabis rollout for any amount of time, this saga may not come as a shock. Since its inception, OCM has struggled to turn mission-driven platitudes into a functioning regulatory regime.\nLast year, the state issued a scathing internal review of the agency. Among the charges: Inexperienced leadership ran the agency like a policy startup. The report found that OCM required many dispensary applicants to execute a lease or purchase a property to apply for a license, while simultaneously having no intention of reviewing all the applications it received.\nWith this latest blunder, absent any court order or amended legislation, already-approved dispensaries will need to relocate. The Governor and office plan to introduce legislation to fix the issue, but the legislature is away until January. And it\u2019s uncertain what state lawmakers will agree to.\nOCM has offered up to $250,000 in relief to affected applicants who were approved but not given final licenses.\nBut in the world of commercial real estate, especially for businesses operating in violation of federal law, that\u2019s not a lot of money. Landlords taking a risk working with dispensaries typically want premium rent in return.\n\u201cThere are so many things that go into locking down real estate, particularly in New York and particularly in an industry that\u2019s so highly regulated and volatile,\u201d said Fatima Afia, a cannabis lawyer at Rudick Law Group. \u201c$250,000 doesn\u2019t really cover much of anything for the folks who have gone through a lot of the process already to lock down a lease and maybe sign a personal guarantee.\u201d\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nHow are retail landlords thinking about dispensaries, both legal and, uh, unofficial? Drop me a line at\nlilah.burke@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nNew York has a professional bull riding team, the Mavericks. Last year, the team made its debut in the Professional Bull Riding league at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. They started this season on Thursday at UBS Arena in Elmont, New York and are there until Saturday.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014\nMayor Adams\u2019 office released a\nreport\nFriday on the economic benefits of each casino proposal vying for a downstate license. The plan from Soloviev, which is slated for a committee vote on Monday, bested the others when it came to job creation numbers, with 17,907 direct construction jobs and 2,736 permanent jobs. The proposal by Mets owner Steve Cohen outside Citi Field, however, topped the list for tax revenue.\n\u2014 The mayor has been running a \u201chard on crime\u201d re-election campaign. But although crime categories may be down year over year, they are still significantly up compared to 2019, the New York Times\nnoted\n. Murders are up 22 percent, felony assaults are up 30 percent and car thefts have more than doubled.\n\u2014 The MTA is moving to acquire more lots through eminent domain for its Second Avenue Subway expansion, the City\nreported\n.\nClosing time:\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$10 million\nfor a co-op unit at 1120 Fifth Avenue in Lenox Hill. Tod Mercy and Jamaal Redon of The Corcoran Group\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$47.5 million\nfor a 9,555-square-foot piece of vacant land at 358 Broadway in Tribeca.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$20 million\nfor a 5,344-square-foot townhouse at 238 West 11th Street in the West Village. Roberta Golubock with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has the listing.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s office vacancy rate has never been higher, but the market tells two very different stories. Companies hunting for high-rise space in trophy towers are finding competition fierce and rents rising, even as older buildings drown in availability.\nDowntown\u2019s overall direct vacancy hit 24.3 percent midway through the year, but much of that space was either outdated or controlled by landlords too tied up with debt to make competitive deals, Crain\u2019s\nreported\nciting data from Colliers. Strip the\ndata\ndown to the market\u2019s best properties, and the supply picture changes dramatically: Class A availability is 19 percent, trophy buildings are at 11.4 percent, and on floors above the 25th level, vacancy drops to just 8.4 percent.\nThat\u2019s what Goldman Ismail Tomaselli Brennan &amp; Baum discovered when the firm went looking for space last year. Partner Andrew Rima expected a tenant\u2019s market with pandemic-era bargains but instead faced a crowded field for well-located, modern offices. The firm ended up taking a floor-and-a-half at 191 North Wacker Drive.\n\u201cIt was more competitive than the headlines suggested,\u201d Rima told the outlet.\nAverage gross asking rents across downtown have barely budged since 2020, according to Colliers. At the top end, however, trophy rents have soared 26 percent to nearly $66 per square foot per year. For a small office footprint of 2,000 square feet, that\u2019s a base of $11,000 a month.\n\nSpace in the city\u2019s priciest towers \u2014 110 North Wacker Drive, 150 North Riverside Plaza and 444 West Lake Street \u2014 is hitting $80 to $90 per foot with taxes and expenses included, brokers say. Meanwhile, tenants at older Class B towers can still strike renewals for less than half that cost.\nThat split is shaping a stampede. Buildings like 155 and 191 North Wacker Drive and 300 North LaSalle Street have soaked up swaths of vacancy as firms\njockey\nfor well-located, modern space that will coax employees back in person. Even renewals are competitive, with multiple tenants circling the same suites, Colliers\u2019 vice chair David Burden told the outlet.\nGenerous concessions are common among landlords, such as free rent, cash for build-outs and other perks, especially for creditworthy firms willing to sign long leases. That restraint stems partly from lingering uncertainty about shrinking\nfootprints\nand leasing volumes well below pre-pandemic levels. Many landlords are cutting office space out of the market with an\nuptick\nin office-to-residential conversion projects in the works.\nDevelopers are even testing the waters for new towers. Related Midwest, Hines and John Buck are all shopping plans for West Loop high-rises that would require pre-leases at more than $100 per foot to land financing.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Neiman Marcus is bowing out of The Shops at Willow Bend, ending more than two decades in Plano.\nSaks Global, which acquired Neiman in last year\u2019s $2.7 billion merger, sold the three-floor, 150,000-square-foot anchor site at 2201 Dallas Parkway to Dallas-based real estate developer Centennial, the mall\u2019s owner and redeveloper, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. The store will be open until January.\nIt\u2019s a symbolic blow to the luxury brand and the struggling 1.4 million-square-foot shopping center, the last enclosed mall built in Texas. Willow Bend debuted in 2001 with Neiman\u2019s as the anchor but has been plagued by sluggish traffic despite heavy, multi-million dollar reinvestment over the years.\nCentennial, which bought the property in 2022, has been working on a multi-year redevelopment strategy, pivoting to\nmixed-use\nafter Macy\u2019s announced earlier this year it would close its Willow Bend location as part of a broader retrenchment.\nThe redevelopment is expected to take years and include apartments, hotel, office, restaurants, retail and townhomes. Plano city officials gave their stamp of approval on the project earlier this year.\n\nThe metroplex is a core market for Neiman Marcus, with stores at NorthPark Center, Downtown Dallas and in Fort Worth, Saks Global said. But each is under review. The historic downtown flagship narrowly\navoided\na March shutdown after tense lease negotiations, and Saks has\npledged\na \u201creimagination\u201d of that site alongside upgrades at NorthPark.\nCompany officials framed the Plano exit as part of aligning with Centennial\u2019s vision for the property. Employees will be offered transfers to other stores or separation packages.\nCentennial is pitching its overhaul of Willow Bend as a way to finally make the shopping center relevant to the surrounding community. The loss of another anchor might make the redevelopment push more urgent \u2014 and potentially easier, as it clears the way for a large-scale reset of the site.\nCentennial is also in the second phase of a $252 million\nredevelopment\nof the 1970s-era Hawthorn Mall in the Chicago suburb of Vernon Hills.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Ray Washburne is set to squeeze more money out of the City of Dallas by way of a land deal for its planned $3.5 billion convention center redevelopment.\nThe Highland Park Village owner already sold the former Dallas Morning News headquarters at 508 Young Street to the city for $45.1 million earlier this summer, outplaying city management with a\ngambit\nto sell it to a data center operator. He paid $28 million for the property in 2019, putting the gain at 46 percent minus holding costs over six years.\nNow the city wants another piece of the former Dallas Morning News property that Washburne owns, and it\u2019s\ntrying to take it by eminent domain\n. City attorneys filed a \u201ccondemnation\u201d lawsuit over the 36,000-square-foot parcel, a parking lot between the old newspaper building and WFAA\u2019s headquarters, after the city couldn\u2019t strike a $6.5 million deal that would\u2019ve paid Washburne $181 per square foot for the parcel, which was included in his $28 million purchase.\nEminent domain cases are supposed to find the fair market value of property that a government entity wants to buy. Recent high-profile examples include the Alamo Trust and City of San Antonio\u2019s effort to seize a bar near the Alamo by eminent domain. In that case, Vince Cantu, the former owner of\nMoses Rose\u2019s Hideout\n, was paid $6.75 million in the city\u2019s eminent domain lawsuit after he rejected offers of $4 million and $6 million.\nTo Washburne, who recently\ncombined his family real estate office\nwith his wife\u2019s, $750,000 would be a rounding error. But the holdout is a major power play for the charismatic businessman.\nHere\u2019s what else happened in Texas real estate this week.\n\nWho doesn\u2019t want an\nH-E-B supermarket\nin their backyard? These neighbors in Northeast Dallas who say the proposed lot the San Antonio-based grocer wants to build on is too small and the development will cause too much traffic.\nThe Texas Legislature deregulated\n\u201cAg shacks\u201d\nin College Station, overriding a local ordinance that aimed to limit how many students can live in one house.\nA historic ranch outfitted for cutting horses hit the market recently for $21 million. The\n900-acre property in Bosque County\n, about an hour and a half from Dallas, was the homestead of James \u201cBuck\u201d Barry, a Texas Ranger, Confederate veteran and former state legislator.\nThe battle over Texas\u2019 law banning \u201ctraveling\u201d housing finance corporations\ngot messier\n.\nA Denver-based investor expanded its\n\u201cRodeo Belt\u201d multifamily portfolio\nwith a purchase in Austin, where there is hope that the apartment slump could swing back in a couple of years.\nMeanwhile in Cowtown, the first condos in the Seven at Bowie House, an Auberge-branded property in Fort Worth\u2019s Cultural District, are\nhitting the market\n. A unit in the development is listed for $5.5 million, or $2,000 per square foot.\n",

        "content": "He may be pushing 90, but Harry Macklowe is still mad for real estate.\nThe prolific developer just closed a deal to redevelop a 1920s-era apartment building on Madison Avenue into ultraluxury condos. Macklowe bought the limestone and brick building at\n809 Madison\non the Upper East Side\u2019s \u201cGold Coast\u201d from Churchill Real Estate Holdings for $49 million, sources told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThat\u2019s a discount from the $55 million Churchill originally paid for the building in 2019, likely because it\u2019s a tricky project that\u2019s befuddled potential developers for a few years. The building, at the corner of East 68th Street, sits within the Upper East Side historic district and any changes to it would require approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission.\nMacklowe was able to get the LPC on board with his plans, sources said, which include using air rights he acquired to expand the building and convert it into large, 4,000-square-foot single-floor apartments. There will also be an expansive penthouse with a 1,500-square-foot terrace.\nHe is partnering with Abe and Scott Shnay\u2019s SK Development on the conversion, which will be designed by Robert A.M. Stern and SLCE Architects. Apartments are expected to sell for more than $20 million.\nRepresentatives for Macklowe and Churchill could not be immediately reached for comment..\nInfinite Global Partners, led by former Silverstein Properties CEO Marty Burger, and Related Funds provided a construction loan. Sculptor Capital Management and Circle Property Partners are providing preferred equity, and a handful of family offices, small funds and ultra-high-net-worth investors are coming in as limited partners.\n\nMichael Campbell of the Carlton Group arranged the financing.\nMacklowe, who turned 88 in August, last kicked off a new Manhattan development project a decade ago when he bought One Wall Street for $585 million. The $2 billion conversion project has had its ups and downs, and after a period of slow sales has seen\nan increase in contracts\n.\nEarlier this year, he sold a Midtown office building that had been part of his Tower Fifth development site, apparently relinquishing his long-held plan to develop a supertall office tower on the site.\nYet while things may be a bit slower on the development front, he certainly hasn\u2019t been quiet. Macklowe\u2019s grabbed headlines with a high-profile divorce in 2018 and a lengthy\nlegal battle\nwith CIM Group, his partner on 432 Park.\nHe sued the Israel Discount Bank of New York earlier this year, trying to stop the lender from foreclosing on his stakes in a pair of real estate investment trusts.\nIn Florida, he\u2019s partnering with Jorge P\u00e9rez\u2019s Related Group to build a\ntwo-tower condo project\nin North Bay Village.\n",

        "content": "The desolate and distressed\nSan Francisco Centre\n, once a Westfield mall before its owners handed back the keys, stands in stark contrast to Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield\u2019s outdoor shopping center in Century City.\nThe San Francisco mall, owned by Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield and Brookfield Properties until the two entities stopped making payments on a $558 million note and then bailed, is now worth less than $200 million.\nThat means the shopping center is worth a billion dollars less than it was nine years ago. It isn\u2019t hard to see why: the 1.5 million square foot retail spot is only seven percent occupied. And the lender wants the shopping complex off its books and to recoup some of what it is owed immediately, per special servicer commentary.\nThe Westfield Century City doesn\u2019t compare. Its owner was recently\nset to close\na $925 million commercial mortgage-backed securities refinancing \u2014 and an appraisal a couple months ago put the Los Angeles mall\u2019s value at $2 billion. Plus, it is nearly 96 percent occupied.\nTime to surrender?\nDoes Rockwood Capital have time to save the Santa Monica Clock Tower? That\u2019s the question\nThe Real Deal\nposed last month after learning the Art Deco office building that was once the city\u2019s largest skyscraper saw its\nvalue slashed\nand its debt land in special servicing.\nBut it appears Rockwood is ready to surrender. Special servicer commentary said: \u201cBorrower has expressed interest to transfer title back to the Lender,\u201d per Morningstar Credit.\nThe century-old Santa Monica Clock Tower was recently appraised at $27.4 million compared to $49 million at loan issuance. That was after the $26.7 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan connected to the offices went to\nspecial servicing\nand missed its maturity date.\nOccupancy declined to 43 percent earlier this year compared to 100 percent at loan underwriting a decade ago \u2014 and the around 50,000 square foot property is not making enough money to pay off its debt.\n\nStill, handing the keys back may not be a done deal. The special servicer said it was evaluating all options.\nBuyer revealed\nWe knew Tishman Speyer was\nselling\na Beverly Hills office building for more than $200 million when we published the scoop earlier in the summer, but the buyer was a mystery. Now we know it is none other than Kilroy Realty \u2014 and according to a person familiar, the deal, coming out to about $707 a square foot, was a competitive process.\nThe publicly traded real estate investment trust\npurchased\nthe offices for $205.3 million \u2014 a debut in the affluent area for Los Angeles-based Kilroy Realty, and an exit for Tishman Speyers from a trio of Beverly Hills office properties purchased two decades ago. Tishman Speyer cashed in all three in the past year or so, all at a profit.\nThe latest, Maple Plaza, which was 75 percent leased, Kilroy Realty purchased via cash on hand and recent disposition proceeds. This comes after Kilroy Realty sold a Santa Monica office building for $40 million and teased another sale at a similar price next year during second quarter earnings.\nOn the scene\nCommercial real estate executives gathered for back-to-back events this week: a\nTRD\nroundtable conversation led by Editor-in-Chief Stuart Elliott and dinner at Mother Wolf Tuesday evening and a Bisnow conference the next morning downtown.\nTRD\u2019s\npanelists \u2014 Cityview\u2019s Sean Burton, Cain International\u2019s Larry Green, and Christie\u2019s International Real Estate\u2019s Aaron Kirman \u2014 discussed whether the tariff bark is worse than bite, Measure ULA pain and more (video coming soon, so stay tuned). Developer Leo Pustilnikov made an appearance at both events.\nThe other event \u2014 on the gutted 23rd floor of 601 S. Figueroa, the office tower Uncommon Developers\npurchased\nfrom Brookfield Properties for $210 million earlier this year \u2014 at times felt like a marketing opportunity and maybe could have focused more on downtown\u2019s homelessness problem but still offered thoughtful insights.\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s real estate deal sheet stretched from suburban malls to waterfront mansions this week, while courtroom fights and zoning battles kept the city\u2019s property scene tense.\nNuveen made a\n$100 million bet on suburban retail\n, acquiring a redeveloped Algonquin shopping center from\nRed Mountain Group\nin one of this year\u2019s biggest retail trades in Chicagoland. The California-based seller had sunk $30 million into repositioning the 600,000-square-foot asset it picked up out of an eight-year-long bout with distress for $33 million.\nOn the South Side,\ninvestor Eliazer Tauber\n, who\u2019s tied to\nindicted New York attorney Mark Nussbaum\n, is facing $10 million in foreclosure suits. The complaints deepen questions about Tauber\u2019s financing web, which includes dozens of distressed multifamily properties.\nElsewhere on the South Side,\nChikoo Patel\u2019s multifamily firm CKO Real Estate\ncontinues to unravel. American Express filed suit against him this week, adding to a pile of lender claims targeting his troubled portfolio of properties throughout Illinois.\n\nDevelopment tensions are flaring on the North Side, where Edgewater and Uptown residents are\nplastering billboards and threatening lawsuits\nover a proposed Broadway upzoning. The measure would allow taller buildings and more commercial uses along the corridor, drawing fire from homeowners wary of density creep.\nIn Evanston, Will Hunter and Evan Meador\u2019s firm\nContinuum paid $31 million for the Church Street Plaza site\n, where it plans a 27-story apartment tower.\nT2 Capital\nprovided a $27 million loan for the deal, moving the long-discussed redevelopment closer to reality.\nMore luxury homeowners are feeling like\nnow is the time to test the market in Lake Geneva\n, where a waterfront mansion just hit the market at $8.5 million. The listing comes on the heels of\ntwo other lakefront homes that asked just under $10 million\nand found buyers within days. Sellers have increasingly\nfavored whispered, off-market dealmaking\nin the vacation-home enclave, making the public listing a relative rarity.\nBack in the Loop,\nBlackstone and its lender CWCapital\nare threatening to sue over a $184 million residential conversion plan at the Clark Adams Building. The firms, which control the hotel portion of the property, argue the proposal risks their collateral. It sets up a second high-stakes clash over the adaptive reuse plan following\na lawsuit recently filed\nby the previous partners of one of the office portion\u2019s owners, Primera Group, alleging they were cut out of the property.",

        "content": "It\u2019s a match made in Bay Area commercial real estate heaven for Maven Commercial and Goldman Limited.\nThe two CRE players merged this week, bringing Goldman Limited founder Nadine Whisnant over to Maven as principal. The new company will retain the\nMaven Commercial\nname.\nThe merger marks a significant expansion for retail leasing leader Maven Commercial in the\nEast Bay\nand Bay Area markets. Whisnant will work out of Maven\u2019s San Francisco headquarters, though she\u2019ll continue to fully operate in the East Bay as she has before, a representative for the company told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nMaven has 30 employees, and no positions will be eliminated. Whether there will be any consolidation in office space remains to be seen.\nThe executive team at Maven includes co-founders and principals Santino DeRose and Pam Mendelsohn as well as principal Catherine Meunier and Chicago team leader Lorraine Adney.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked alongside Nadine on many transactions and consistently found a natural alignment in how we approach clients and the business. Her depth of knowledge in the East Bay and throughout the greater Bay Area makes this an exciting opportunity to grow together,\u201d DeRose told\nThe Real Deal\n, touting Whisnant\u2019s \u201cstrong relationships with both well-known retailers and restaurateurs as well as with landlords.\u201d\nWhisnant founded Goldman Limited in 2000. Maven, founded in 2010 and expanding into Chicago in 2021, maintains a presence in upscale San Francisco retail neighborhoods like Hayes Valley, Cow Hollow, Upper Fillmore and\nUnion Square\n. The merger with Goldman will increase its presence in East Bay markets like\nBerkeley\n, Walnut Creek, Alameda and Lafayette.\nFarewell to a titan\nBay Area real estate mogul and prolific philanthropist\nThaddeus \u201cTad\u201d Taube\nhas died at the age of 94. The Polish-born giant died at his home in San Mateo County.\nTaube co-founded The Woodmont Companies, which went on to become one of the largest privately owned investment real estate companies on the West Coast.\nIn subsequent decades, he worked toward charitable causes through his Koret Foundation. In his home country, Taube founded and helped fund the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews in\nWarsaw\n.\nAcross the Bay Area, Taube funded projects such as an upgrade of the San Francisco Opera\u2019s performance space and the reinstallation of the Bay Bridge\u2019s \u201cBay Lights.\u201d He supported Stanford University athletics through the construction of the Taube Family Tennis Stadium and launched programs to connect at-risk youth with professional sports teams in the region. He also invested in health care initiatives like the Neurodegenerative Disease Research Collaborative and the Tad and Dianne Taube Pavilion at Stanford\u2019s children\u2019s hospital and efforts to address youth addiction, concussions, pediatric cancer and maternal and mental health.\n\u201cIf you were to draw a road map of my life, it would have multiple forks,\u201d he once said. \u201cI often find myself driving along several paths at the same time.\u201d\nEverything\u2019s coming up roses?\n\nSix years after its application for construction was approved, Kilroy Realty is offering a bouquet of different flowers for its\nplanned redevelopment\nof the old San Francisco Flower Market.\nThe Los Angeles-based firm filed a new application with a handful of options for development at the Central South of Market site that would increase housing and office capacity.\nOne version calls for five buildings with roughly 2.6 million square feet of office or lab space, up to 100,000 square feet of retail space, 300,000 square feet of institutional space and more than 800 parking spots. Another would apply the\nstate density bonus law\nto build seven buildings containing a total of 3,532 new homes as well as 100,000 square feet of retail space and more than 1,800 parking spaces.\nThe \u201cMixed-Use Variant\u201d would have 1,242 housing units as well as 1.5 million square feet of office or lab space, 100,000 square feet of commercial space and more than 1,000 parking spaces in five buildings, while the \u201cInstitutional Variant\u201d\u00a0 proposes roughly 1.4 million square feet of medical or institutional space, 1.2 million square feet for office and lab tenants, plus 100,000 square feet of retail and 431 parking spaces across five buildings.\nLivin\u2019 at the car wash\nA long-languishing\ncar wash in Lower Haight\ncould finally be scrubbed away in favor of residences.\nSan Francisco Supervisor Bilal Mahmood introduced legislation that would allow building projects to follow the code in place at the time a proposal application was initially filed, clearing the way for Irvine-based developer 4Terra Investments to move forward with its planned six-story, 203-unit building at 400 Divisadero Street, approved in 2017.\nThe\nTouchless Car Wash project\nhas been seemingly dead in the soapy water for nine years; building codes related to mechanical, electrical, plumbing, structural and energy change every three years. As a result, 4Terra has had to redesign its plans since it originally filed them.\nBy using the regulations in place in 2016, 4Terra is projected to save approximately $4 million on the project.\nA lucky break\nLast week\u2019s passage of Senate Bill 79 in the California legislature included a carveout affecting just one county in the whole state: Contra Costa.\nState Sen. Scott Wiener\u2019s SB 79 will only apply to counties with more than 15 high-frequency train or bus stops, leaving just seven counties in the whole state subject to the upzoning legislation; in the Bay Area, that includes Alameda, San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties.\nContra Costa County\navoided\nSB 79\u2019s enforcement with exactly 15 stations falling under the bill\u2019s permission for high-density zoning, including 12 Bay Area Rapid Transit stations and three Amtrak stations in Richmond, Martinez and Antioch.\nThe NIMBY win came after the Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors and city councilmembers in Lafayette and Orinda\nlobbied state lawmakers\nto advance the amendment, arguing that SB 79 would increase density along fire evacuation zones and put residents at risk.\n",

        "content": "The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point.\nThe reduction is not as substantial as some hoped, and it had already been priced into mortgage rates by the time the\nannouncement\nwas made last week.\nThe remaining market foe is inflation. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s causing the stickiness around long-term rates,\u201d said Robert Palmer, founder and CEO of LPT Realty, a Florida brokerage firm.\nStill, a drop is good news.\n\u201cRates are still better than they have been. I think the hope was we were going to see a sharp drop happening. We didn\u2019t get that,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need much more clear inflation data to drive down rates to the level that most consumers want.\u201d\nOverall, the rate cut will bring more buyers to the market. But first-time home buyers will just face more competition in a market that has a very limited supply of affordable homes.\nAna Bozovic, market analyst and broker-owner of Analytics Miami, wrote in her newsletter that wealth migration remains the driving force behind the real estate market\u2019s success.\n\u201cEven with [Fed chairman Jerome] Powell acknowledging inflation concerns, the likely trajectory is continued rate cuts. That means more liquidity, more buyers, and more momentum flowing directly into Miami real estate,\u201d she wrote.\nReal estate brokers tell me that even though mortgage rates aren\u2019t and won\u2019t be close to the high 2 percent and low 3 percent range seen just a few years ago, they do expect this cut to have a psychological effect.\nTop agents are also ready to pounce on ultra-wealthy buyers keeping an eye on whether Zohran Mamdani wins in New York in November.\nThe interest rate cuts, \u201cthey\u2019re going to help us even more,\u201d top broker Dora Puig says. \u201cAnd then let\u2019s watch what happens in New York with the mayoral campaign.\u201d\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWho bought the\nnon-waterfront house\nat 2301 North Bay Road?

        "content": "It goes without saying, but pictures or social media posts aren\u2019t always worth 1,000 words.\nThat rang particularly true this past week on a ride through parts of the Palisades with local brokerage owner Anthony Marguleas, founder of Amalfi Estates.\nThe takeaway: Anyone peddling only photos of uncleared, burned lots is selling a dated sense of reality. Construction is now the story for the Palisades as more and more builders enter the scene.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much misinformation,\u201d Marguleas told\nThe Real Deal\n(find more from that conversation in our upcoming October issue of the magazine). \u201cThere are a couple people online that are so politically charged, and I\u2019m not going to talk about the whole political conversation, but there\u2019s a couple individuals who are so anti-Mayor [Karen] Bass and so anti-[Gov. Gavin] Newsom and so conspiracy theorist. All I care about is our town being rebuilt.\u201d\nHe ticked off several items to dispute, but at the top of the list was the subject of permitting.\nCritics of Bass have long accused the city of a sluggish rebuild. Part of that may have been fueled in the early days beginning with the lack of clarity around a\ncontract\nawarded to the Chicago outfit\nHagerty Consulting\nin February for as much as $10 million. Questions around that still stand.\nHowever, in the community\u2019s Alphabet Streets alone, an increasing number of lots now bear frames of homes or are wrapped with the names of builders who are working.\nAs of Friday morning, there were 569 permits issued by the city of Los Angeles for 336 addresses, according to the Department of Building and Safety online dashboard. Another 720 plans have been approved with 769 in review.\nFor Marguleas, more of that information should be the norm rather than the noise of those shooting from the hip.\n\u201cI love data. Everything I have is backed up with data,\u201d Marguleas said. \u201cA lot of agents are just kind of willy-nilly with it, but everything I have is data.\u201d\nSamara\u2019s rebuild work\nNot a lot has been revealed on the progress of Steadfast LA and Airbnb spinoff Samara\u2019s planned donations to survivors of January\u2019s Palisades and Eaton fires since the February announcement of their partnership.\nIt took some time for homeowners to make decisions about whether they would stay or leave, for starters, Samara co-founder and CEO\nMike McNamara\ntold\nTRD\non Thursday. There have also been the more pragmatic realities, such as determining whether one of Samara\u2019s factory-made accessory dwelling units are the right fit for a lot.\nThe first home recipients, residing in Pasadena and Altadena, have been selected, and Samara\u2019s now moving forward on permitting, the CEO said.\n\nSamara closed $34 million in Series B funding led by Thrive Capital, which McNamara said is \u201cgrowth capital\u201d as the firm faces demand from wildfire survivors, multi-generational households and multifamily property owners.\nBig deal\nSome might cheer Friday afternoon\u2019s $44 million closing of a Brentwood estate as being yet another market bright spot following the January fires.\nThe deal on the home at 11740 Crescenda Street, which was named \u201cOcho Manos\u201d by its former owners, sold to a mystery buyer represented by the Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Michael Fahimian and Jack Harris.\nThe sellers, financier and Milwaukee Brewers minority owner Robert Beyer and his wife Catherine Beyer, had the 20,000-square-foot home custom built and reportedly sought $75 million for it in 2023. It was most recently listed for $54.9 million.\nCarolwood Estates co-founder and CEO Drew Fenton, along with Andrew Beyer, were the listing agents.\nThe closing makes Ocho Manos Brentwood\u2019s most-expensive sale since the off-market trade of 13058 Rivers Road in Brentwood. That property sold for $56.6 million in December 2021. Fenton was also the listing agent there, along with Compass\u2019 David Kramer. Tracy Tutor, now of Compass, represented the buyer.\n$110M hits peak popularity\nIf Bel-Air and Holmby Hills can do it, why not Malibu? The \u201cit\u201d in this would be closing on a $110 million home sale this year.\nSpelling Manor at\n594 South Mapleton Drive\nin Holmby Hills and\n630 Nimes Road\nin Bel-Air are tied for this year\u2019s priciest residential sales in Los Angeles County, with both estates going for $110 million.\nNow, the owners of 6962 Wildlife Road in Malibu are testing the price point in the seaside community, with the over 7,000-square-foot residence entering the market on Friday. The asking price is $15,530 per square foot.\nThe property \u2014 at one time owned by the king of late night, Johnny Carson \u2014 is\nreportedly\nbeing sold by August Tigrett, whose father Isaac Tigrett founded Hard Rock Cafe and House of Blues, and her husband Riaz Valani, the first investor in electronic cigarette maker Juul.\nIf sold, the home would be a big headline for Malibu after the $80 million sale of\n28719 Grayfox Street\n, which was recorded by the Los Angeles County Recorder\u2019s Office in late July.\n",

        "content": "Manhattan\u2019s debt markets didn\u2019t slow down in August as some of the city\u2019s biggest landlords lined up billions in fresh financing.\nThree blockbuster office refinancings topped the month\u2019s largest loans, led by the Durst Organization\u2019s\n$1.3 billion deal\nfor its Times Square tower. Paramount Group landed a $900 million loan for its Sixth Avenue tower just before the office landlord was\nsold to the highest bidder\n. On the residential side, lenders doled out dollars to Miki Naftali and Josh Gotlib and Meyer Orbach\u2019s recently-launched REIT.\nTogether, the deals totaled more than $4 billion and underscored lenders\u2019 appetite for prime Manhattan real estate. Here are the top five loans in Manhattan.\nDurst debt | $1.3B | Midtown\nWells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America\noriginated a $1.3 billion CMBS loan for the Durst Organization\u2019s One Five One office tower in Times Square. The loan, carrying a 6.1 percent interest rate, will pay off roughly $1.1 billion in existing debt on the 1.8 million-square-foot tower at 151 West 42nd Street. It will fund nearly $40 million in reserves and closing costs, according to an S&amp;P Global report.\nThe deal includes a $719 million \u201cA\u201d note that earned a preliminary AAA rating from S&amp;P on the back of Durst\u2019s financial strength and the tower\u2019s performance. Remaining capital will go toward tenant improvements, leasing costs and a $146 million equity payout to the landlord. The fresh financing replaced\na $900 million refinancing\nfrom JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo from 2019. The tower, formerly known as 4 Times Square, is 92 percent leased. TikTok is the anchor tenant and occupies 232,000 square feet.\nParamount payday | $900M | Midtown\n\nMorgan Stanley and Wells Fargo\nprovided a $900 million loan for Paramount Group\u2019s 45-story office tower at 1301 Sixth Avenue. The loan replaced a $710 million loan from Morgan Stanley that was set to mature in 2026. The refi came after law firm Piper Sandler signed a 140,000-square-foot lease and law firm Adler &amp; Stachenfeld took 40,000 square feet, bringing the building to 97 percent occupancy. The building will soon be owned by New York City-based Rithm Capital, which won a bidding war for Paramount after shareholders raised concerns over the real estate investment trust\u2019s performance and management.\nApollo landing | $785M | Midtown\nApollo Global Management\nprovided a $785 million loan to finance RXR\u2019s $1.08 billion purchase of 590 Madison Avenue. RXR bought the Plaza District office tower for $1.08 billion from the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio. Scott Rechler\u2019s firm partnered with Elliott Investment Management and Baupost Group on the deal. The final debt package is broken down into a $650 million senior loan, a $135 million mezzanine loan and about $60 million in future funding commitments for things like tenant improvements and leasing costs. Eastdil Secured\u2019s Grant Frankel arranged the debt.\nNaftali knockdown | $675M | Upper East Side\nJPMorgan Chase\nprovided a $675 million loan for Miki Naftali\u2019s purchase of the 33-story 800 Fifth Avenue rental building from Eliot Spitzer and the Winter Organization. Naftali agreed to buy the 208-unit building last March for more than $800 million, which works out to about $2,400 per square foot. He plans to tear down the existing building and replace it with a new tower. Newmark\u2019s Jordan Roeschlaub and Nick Scribani arranged the debt.\nCopper cash | $525M | Murray Hill\nArbor Realty Trust\nprovided a $525 million loan for the Copper Apartments, a pair of luxury apartment towers owned by Josh Gotlib and Meyer Orbach\u2019s GO Residential REIT.\u00a0 The fresh financing for the 761-unit property at 616-626 First Avenue in Murray Hill replaced a $611.5 million CMBS loan. Gotlib and Orbach bought the buildings in 2022 for $837 million. They launched their real estate investment trust this summer, listing it on the Toronto Stock Exchange with a $2.7 billion multifamily portfolio of more than 2,000 units.\n",

You can see the top 10\u00a0 by clicking here.\nAthens, Georgia-based Landmark Properties partnered with investment management firm Stockbridge in late April to acquire the two buildings, Icon Plaza at 3584 South Figueroa Street, and West 27th Place, at 2700 South Figueroa Street, in a deal brokered by TSB Realty. The former, erected in 2012 with 57 units and 252 beds sold for $51.5 million, and the latter, built in 2010 with 161 units and 452 beds, went for $48.5 million.\n\u201cGiven that approximately 81 percent of USC students require off-campus options, Icon Plaza and West 27th Place are ideally situated to deliver vital, purpose-built student housing,\u201d JD Goering, senior vice president of acquisitions at Landmark, said in a news release about the deal. The two properties are within walking distance to USC\u2019s main academic and recreational buildings.\nLandmark committed to renovating common areas and amenities at the Icon Plaza. No major updates were planned for West 27th as it was recently renovated.\n\nIcon Plaza features fully furnished two- to five-bedroom units. The building has a swimming pool, rooftop lounge, clubhouse, fitness center and study rooms. Starbucks, Jersey Mike\u2019s, Movita, Juice Bar and Wingstop are the ground-floor tenants.\nWest 27th Place consists of studio, one-, two-, and four-bedroom units offering a modern furniture package. Amenities include a swimming pool, fitness center, clubhouse with social areas, and study rooms. Retail tenants on the ground floor include Five Guys, Thai by Trio and Factory Tea Bar.\nOne of the most active student housing developers in the country,\nLandmark is on a tear\n.\nAs of the end of April, the firm said it had over 50 student and multifamily projects under construction or near term start with an estimated value of over $10 billion.\nThat pipeline includes The Mark at Los Angeles, under construction near the UCLA campus, and The Standard at Los Angeles being built near the USC campus. The two projects will add more than 1,450 beds to the market.\n",

It then renovated and expanded the building into a two-story office and creative manufacturing hub, according to the Business Times\nIt\u2019s a notable upgrade in space for the four-year-old Astro Mechanica. Its current offices are a block away in a roughly 4,000-square-foot building at 19 Butte Place.\n\nVantage finished the renovation during the pandemic and 550 7th Street has remained vacant ever since. The property features manufacturing space on the ground floor and office space on its second and mezzanine levels. Over the spring and summer, an\nartificial intelligence\ncompany, a\nrobotics\ncompany, general technology companies and one tenant that needed space for three-dimensional printers for prototyping toured the property, according to the Business Times.\nAstro Mechanica is working to create a new jet engine that would enable commercial supersonic flights to return to the skies. The company was founded by CEO Ian Brooke in 2021 and raised a $27.1 million round of funding this spring, per the Business Times. Last month, the company secured an undisclosed investment from United Airlines\u2019 venture capital arm. United in particular has already committed to a forthcoming supersonic flight rebirth, pledging to buy 15 planes from Boom Supersonic with the hope of starting commercial supersonic flights by the end of the decade.\nThe $27.1 million raised will be used to build out Astro Mechanica\u2019s software team, further develop and test its jet engine prototype, and launch a team to start building airframes, Brooke\ntold\nTectonic in April. The funding will also enable Astro Mechanica to pursue government contracts.

        "content": "A casino is no longer in Manhattan\u2019s future.\nThe gaming proposal from Soloviev Group, which would have built a casino on a vacant lot near the United Nations building, was rejected this morning in a four-to-two vote before a community advisory committee.\nSoloviev\u2019s plan is the third to be rejected by a CAC over the course of one week. The result eliminates all proposals for a casino located in Manhattan. Five proposals remain, with three licenses available from the state.\nThe four members of the committee who voted against the proposal were Sandra McKee, appointed by State Senator Kristen Gonzalez; Reshma Patel, appointed by Assembly member Harvey Epstein; Celeste Royo, appointed by Borough President Mark Levine; and Jasmine Narula, appointed by Council member Keith Powers.\nThe two who voted for the proposal were Jennifer Sta. Ines, appointed by Mayor Eric Adams and Nichols Silbersack, appointed by Gov. Kathy Hochul.\n\nSoloviev\u2019s proposal, called \u201cFreedom Plaza,\u201d would have been an $11 billion development, the most expensive of all the plans. The partnership with the Mohegan Tribe and Banyan Group aimed to build a below-grade casino at 686 First Avenue, with 1,049 housing units and green space. It also offered equity options for city residents.\nThe Freedom Plaza proposal failed despite significant tailwinds in recent days. On Friday, Mayor Eric Adams released a report that showed the Soloviev plan would create more jobs than any other casino plan. And on Saturday, the partnership announced an amendment that all housing units would be permanently affordable, increasing the number of affordable units by 400.\nThe CACs, one for each proposal, are tasked with determining if there is public support for a casino proposal. Those that are approved at this stage will go before the state gaming commission.\nAfter three rejections over the last week, five proposals remain: Mets owner Steve Cohen\u2019s project at Citi Field, Thor Equities\u2019 proposed Coney Island development, one from Bally\u2019s in the Throgg\u2019s Neck area of the Bronx, Genting\u2019s proposed casino in Jamaica, Queens and a site in Yonkers from MGM.\nThe CACs must vote before Sept 30.",

Unit 5B hit the market earlier this month, roughly two years after the sellers bought it for $16 million. The apartment has four bedrooms and four bathrooms and also features a corner great room with views of the Hudson River.\nAmenities in the 46-unit building, developed by Related Companies, include a garage, fitness center, a lap pool and squash court.\nCortnee Glasser with Sotheby\u2019s International had the listing.\nThe Tribeca building has snagged a number of notable buyers since sponsor sales launched in 2016, including film producer and director Jack Heller, who in 2018 paid\n$19 million\nfor a 4,100-square-foot unit with a terrace.\n\nA $55 million penthouse at 70 Vestry was also at the center of a\ncontentious divorce\nbetween the CEO of the modeling agency Elite World Group, Julia Haart, and her estranged husband, Italian telecom mogul Silvio Scaglia. A judge sided with Haart, who also starred in the reality TV show \u201cMy Unorthodox Life,\u201d in divorce proceedings, awarding her the apartment earlier this year.\nThe second most expensive home to enter contract was a townhouse at 80 Horatio Street, with an asking price of $9 million. The West Village home, which is currently configured as multiple rental apartments, hit the market earlier this month for the first time in roughly 50 years.\nThe buyer signed the pending deal after a bidding war, and the final sale price will likely be between $10 million and $11 million, sources told Olshan. The 25-foot-wide home spans five stories and 6,100 square feet.\nBrown Harris Stevens\u2019 Amy Herman and Kyle Cooper had the listing.\nOf the 21 properties, 15 were condos, five were co-ops and one was a townhouse.\nThe homes\u2019 combined asking price was $144 million, for an average price of $6.9 million and a median of $6 million. The typical home spent more than a year and a half on the market and was discounted 7 percent from the original listing price.\n",

        "content": "After multiple delays, a task force entrusted with the fate of the Brooklyn Marine Terminal has voted to allow plans to build thousands of units of housing on the site to move forward.\nThe 28-member task force, chaired by Rep. Dan Goldman, on Monday advanced in a 17-to-eight vote the $3.5 billion plan to redevelop the 122-acre marine terminal, which runs from Cobble Hill to Red Hook. The latest plan calls for 6,000 apartments on the site, with 40 percent set aside as affordable. Roughly half of the site will include modernized piers along with a new marginal pier for smaller and mid-sized ships.\nThe plan also includes 275,000 square feet of light industrial space, an up to 400-key hotel and 28 acres of open space.\nMonday\u2019s vote simply means that plans for the terminal will move forward, with the environmental review and the general project plan process coming next. But the task force had the ability to kill the project before it even began the state\u2019s public review process \u2014\u00a0and its fate appeared precarious over the last few months.\nThe vote was\npostponed\nfive times, as the task force struggled to get enough yes votes to move the project forward. The proposal has also undergone multiple revisions. Initial plans called for up to 12,000 housing units, which were then pared down to 7,700 and then to 6,000.\nThe critical vote was delayed amid accusations that the city and state were trying to rush the plan forward. Some elected officials, including Council member Alexa Avil\u00e9s, a vice chair of the task force, and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, worried that the plan would further diminish the city\u2019s industrial and manufacturing capabilities.\nIn a Brooklyn Eagle editorial she co-wrote with Eddie Bautista, Avil\u00e9s, executive director of the NYC Environmental Justice Alliance and a member of the task force, called the plan \u201chalf-baked,\u201d and raised doubts that the commitments made as part of the plan would be honored.\nBut last week, some of the task force\u2019s naysayers were swayed by a number of changes, including an increase in funds for housing and industrial space. The Economic Development Corporation, the agency leading this project, has pledged to create a $75 million fund to build or preserve housing off-site within Community Board 6, up from the original $50 million commitment.\nThe administration also added 50,000 square feet of light industrial space, bringing the project\u2019s total to 275,000 square feet, with a majority of that space dedicated to a single, mixed-use building planned for Pier 11.\nOther new investments include $3 million for capital improvements at public schools in areas near the terminal and $7 million for improvements at DiMattina Park, Van Voorhees Playground, Carroll Park and other parks in the area.\nThis fall, EDC will also release a request for expressions of interest, seeking proposals for different port configurations and additional maritime industrial activities at the port. The agency will also develop an alternative for a larger port that will be analyzed in the environmental review process.\nLast week, EDC credited Council member Shahana Hanif and Reynoso for helping to work out the changes, which ultimately paved the way for Monday\u2019s vote.\n\nAn ailing piece of infrastructure\nThe city took control of the terminal last year through a\nland swap\nwith the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which received Staten Island\u2019s Howland Hook Marine Terminal in the exchange.\nMuch was at stake for the administration, which is trying to make good on a bet that creating a modern port \u2014\u00a0while also adding thousands of units of housing \u2014 was better than continuing to subsidize the activities of a flailing terminal.\nDuring a tour of the site in June, EDC head Andrew Kimball described decades\u2019 worth of deferred basic maintenance at the terminal, piling up to hundreds of millions of dollars. Two of the piers were condemned roughly a year ago, and another two are about eight to 10 years from collapsing, he said at the time.\nThe port handles roughly 60,000 containers every year, or roughly 1.5 percent of the containers brought into New York Harbor. The terminal has also been used for non-maritime purposes, storing mountains of aggregate, junk cars and decades-old modular hotel units.\nInstead of replacing three of the long piers that jut out into the East River, the city wants to fill in the gaps between the aging piers to create a marginal pier deeper in the channel, allowing ships to sidle up sideways.\nThe administration saw the deal with the Port Authority as an opportunity to double down on moving goods by water \u2014\u00a0as a way to reduce trucks transporting perishable food items throughout the city, for instance \u2014\u00a0while also using a portion of the site for housing.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just eliminate this site completely as a maritime opportunity,\u201d Kimball said during the tour.\nPending approval by the state, developers of the residential sites will make payments in lieu of taxes, which will be invested into the terminal, rather than the city\u2019s general fund. The Economic Development Corporation expects to fund the affordable housing component with revenues from the overall development and \u201cadditional public grants.\u201d Officials have also pledged to invest $200 million in public housing complexes, Red Hook Houses East and Red Hook Houses West.\nKimball said that once the project is officially approved, a development corporation \u2014 whose members will be appointed by the governor, mayor and local representatives \u2014 will decide how to roll out the search for developers of the residential sites. He noted the \u201cstrong interest\u201d among the task force members to ensure that multiple developers are involved, unlike the nearby megadevelopment Pacific Park.\nThe state is still in the process of approving new development teams for the remaining housing at that project, which has been criticized for not spreading the risk of developing those sites among more developers.\n",

That ruling came months after Aby Rosen\u2019s firm sued Cooper Union in September after the school moved to terminate the company\u2019s ground lease.

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s housing market could see a \u201cfeeding frenzy\u201d next year if mortgage rates continue to slide off the Fed\u2019s easing interest rates, but where rates and the market are going is uncertain.\nMortgage rates aren\u2019t directly affected by the Fed\u2019s interest rates. They track closely to the 10-year Treasury bond and usually move in anticipation of what the Fed will do. Rates have been falling fairly steadily all year, and they reached their lowest point this year before last week\u2019s rate cut, according to Freddie Mac.\nBrokers said they\u2019re hopeful mortgage rates below 6 percent could be on the horizon if the Fed cuts interest rates further this year as it indicated and keeps up an optimistic view of the economy.\nWhether the Fed\u2019s signal on interest rates will bring mortgage rates down further isn\u2019t clear yet. The 10-year Treasury yield and mortgage rates ticked up slightly in the days following the Fed\u2019s announcement, partially owing to lower jobless claims announced Thursday. But the 30-year mortgage rate is still on the lower end of the last three years, at 6.35 percent as of Friday, according to Mortgage News Daily.\n\u201cAll the conversation of where it\u2019s going, I don\u2019t think anybody knows where the rates are going to go,\u201d Dream Town CEO Yuval Degani said. \u201cIf you look at all the estimations of the last three years, the forecasts, they never happened.\u201d\n\nBut if lower mortgage rates do come, the early months of next year could be a \u201cfeeding frenzy,\u201d Fulton Grace Realty broker Patrick Shino said, as more buyers pour into the market and their buying power grows.\nChicago\u2019s housing market has been saddled by low inventory the last few years, driving prices up and creating competition for scarce listings. Homeowners locked into 2 to 3 percent rates aren\u2019t selling, and the buyer pool isn\u2019t drying up. Home prices have increased year-over-year each month for almost two years straight, and active listings have been trending downward since 2020, according to Redfin and the Federal Reserve.\nLower rates will help with the scarcity, unlocking some inventory as homeowners who have been holding out on moving put their houses on the market. Jenny Ames, a broker with Engel and V\u00f6lkers, said she thinks the market will start to normalize as people who have been wanting to move take advantage of the lower interest rates, freeing up homes for other buyers.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that prices are necessarily going to come down right away because we\u2019ve had this scarcity issue,\u201d Ames said. \u201cBut over time, if rates come down and stay down and the logjam breaks, then I think the pressure on inventory will start to ease and we\u2019ll start to see a more normal market.\u201d\nBut Shino said he doubts the added inventory will keep up with the demand that will grow alongside it. First-time buyers who missed out on interest rates below 3 percent will be eager to lock in properties if rates dip below 6 percent.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to want to miss out on it again, and I think you\u2019re going to have far more buyers flooding into the market,\u201d Shino said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way there\u2019s going to be enough inventory to satiate that buyer demand.\u201d",

        "content": "The biggest multifamily sale in Glendale over the last quarter was 600 North Central Avenue, which The Sobrato Organization nabbed for $126 million, according to Los Angeles County tax assessor records, a whopping price that topped the rest of the top 10 combined.\nThis is the latest installment in a feature providing a weekly update on quarterly top sales by market segment, based on TRDData.\nThe Sobrato family started in real estate as Italian-immigrant farmers at the southern end of San Francisco Bay. The family shifted into commercial development in the 1950s, and grew its operations as Silicon Valley spread its tentacles from a home base in Santa Clara County.\nSobrato acquired the Modera Glendale, a 235-unit apartment building, from Mill Creek Residential and Rockwood Capital, and renamed it The Adeline. The price comes out to $536,000 per unit.\n\nThat\u2019s a far cry from the city\u2019s average sales price per unit of $269,249, according to a multifamily market report from Kidder Mathews.\nMill Creek developed the five-story property in 2015. It has a courtyard with a pool and a hot tub, plus two smaller attached courtyards. The property also has a fitness center, a yoga studio, a pet spa and a multipurpose clubhouse with a gourmet kitchen area and an internet cafe.\nThe apartments, managed by Greystar, range from studios to three-bedrooms. One-bedroom apartments start at $2,788 per month for 619 square feet, The Adeline website indicates. Two-bedrooms start at $3,854 a month for 1,050 square feet. In the second quarter, the average monthly asking rent in Glendale was $2,277, per the Kidder Mathews report.\nThe April 23 deal also marks\nL.A. County\u2019s biggest multifamily sale\nof the quarter. The second-biggest in the county was 38441 5th Street West in the desert city of Palmdale, which Beverly Hills-headquartered Post Investment Group acquired for\n$71 million\non March 3. That complex has 296 units across 16 buildings. The deal values the property at just under $240,000 per unit.\n",

        "content": "An Austin apartment portfolio took a major hit to its appraisal value four months after its CMBS loan was\nflagged for special servicing\n, as Texas braces for a wave of multifamily distress.\nAn updated appraisal put the two-property portfolio at $98.9 million, a 47 percent haircut from its value of $187.9 million in 2023, according to Morningstar Credit. The appraisal drop put the portfolio\u2019s value below the balance on the $110 million CMBS loan tied to the properties.\nThe loan tied to far northeast Austin complexes Orbit Apartments and Starburst Apartments has been delinquent since April and was transferred to special servicing for default, according to Trepp. The loan was issued in 2023 and is set to mature in May 2028.\nDeed records show the borrower is Orem, Utah-based investor Keller Capital. The firm bought the properties in 2019 from Tampa-based investor Laurel Ridge.\nThere are 840 units between the two properties, at 8800 and 8900 North Interstate Highway 35. The loan works out to about $131,000 per unit. The apartments were built in the early eighties and renovated in 2022. Orbit Apartments were valued at $43.7 million this year, appraisal district records show. Starburst Apartments were valued at $58.1 million.\n\nBetween the historic glut of apartment supply coming online and the rise in interest rates, Texas multifamily has become a hot potato, especially the properties built decades ago that need work.\nAustin saw 25,000 units delivered last year, according to data from Yardi Matrix. As a result, rents continued to freefall and occupancy slumped. MRI ApartmentData put the city\u2019s occupancy at 84.5 percent in April. That same month, rent had dropped 7.6 percent from a year earlier.\nJust before the delivery deluge, investors swept through Texas metros when interest rates were low, picking up vintage apartments at high valuations with plans to renovate them, raise rents and sell for a profit. Instead, interest rates rose, as did construction costs, and valuations dropped, spelling trouble for many of these investors.\nExperts have been warning of\na wave of distress\nas $19 billion in CMBS loans tied to Texas multifamily is set to mature in the next five years.\n",

The developer now controls the vast majority of the block, with only a handful of other owners remaining.\nThe ultimate plan remains unclear. Laboz, a\nkey player in New York retail\n, has described the assemblage as a \u201clong-term hold,\u201d citing its prime location above two subway arteries and within steps of three more.\n\nHe has accumulated enough land on the block to build the borough\u2019s largest skyscraper. But large-scale rental projects in New York are difficult to pencil out since the state passed the\n485x tax break\n. Some developers have filed to\ndevelop clusters of 99-unit buildings\nto avoid the minimum construction wage requirement that kicks in at 100 units.\nLaboz did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nLaboz has pulled off this type of play before. In 2012, his family sold a nearby assemblage of a dozen parcels to AvalonBay Communities for $125 million. That site became the 826-unit Ava DoBro, the borough\u2019s largest residential tower when it opened in 2015.\nLaboz has continued to invest in Downtown Brooklyn retail. In December, he and a group of investors\nbought the Macy\u2019s\non the block catty corner to the assemblage. Laboz and his partners, Isaac Chera of Crown Acquisitions and the Chehabar family of the Jackson Group, plan to redevelop the historic property at 422 Fulton Street into a retail and entertainment space.\n",

        "content": "Walls are closing in on\nChikoo Patel\n.\nThe multifamily property manager and investor who assembled control of dozens of South Side apartment buildings through his firm CKO Real Estate is facing a lawsuit alleging he bilked his ex-partners out of more than $10.8 million through fraud, theft and mismanagement.\nThe lawsuit was filed Thursday by investor Shai Wolkowicki and his wife Lauren Lampert, who first partnered with Patel\u2019s Chicago-based firm\nCKO Real Estate\nin 2020. But they split up early this year, when they confronted Patel after discovering his alleged misdeeds and removed him from operating the properties, Wolkowicki and other investors said.\nOver the years, Lampert and Wolkowicki invested in more than 50 real estate projects with Patel. In addition to the trio\u2019s Chicago holdings, they also jointly owned rental properties throughout Illinois, including in Rockford, and Springfield, where Patel and Wolkowicki are facing a $16 million foreclosure lawsuit from Old National Bank for the apartment complex at 1833 Seven Pines Road.\nThe distress is derived in part from Patel allegedly violating operating agreements he had with the couple, who hired CKO to manage their portfolio of at least 37 business entities invested in the ownership of apartments. The couple classified themselves as \u201cpassive investors,\u201d but they said they had to take on an active role earlier this year when they fired CKO upon discovering that Patel had been improperly siphoning millions of dollars out of the properties to himself. They called it a \u201cPonzi-like scheme\u201d to cover his personal expenses, staffing costs for CKO and other unscrupulous expenditures not related to real estate, the suit said.\nWolkowicki and Lampert, who both led\nreal estate careers in Chicago\nbefore moving to Boca Raton, Florida, a few years ago, were lured into continuing to buy property through Patel after a successful initial investment in 2020. Their agreements purportedly outlined that Patel held minority ownership in the dozens of properties they bought together, while he performed management duties for a fee and got bonus payments when other investors\u2019 capital had been returned.\nIt didn\u2019t go as planned. \u201cThe results have been catastrophic\u201d for Wolkowicki and Lampert, their lawsuit said.\nAn attorney for Patel, M. Reas Bowman, said his client denies all the allegations and is working to resolve the various litigation in which he\u2019s involved. Wolkowicki declined to comment beyond his complaint.\nOutside of\nCKO\u2019s internal financial issues\n, Patel is also facing serious allegations brought to court by city officials and his lenders, including a\ncredit card company\nthat said he owes $60,000 after missing minimum payments. Other investors have made similar allegations to Wolkowicki regarding their financial trouble at a Southwest Side apartment property.\n\nTenants in CKO-managed buildings earlier this year became enraged with the deteriorating conditions of their rentals. In response, Chicago officials sued CKO over the allegedly egregious building code violations.\nLampert and Wolkowicki\u2019s lawsuit outlines even more outlandish claims, starting in 2022, with allegedly improper transfers between property-level bank accounts to CKO entities and bank accounts controlled by Patel. He allegedly deposited at least $500,000 from an insurance payout following a fire at 6449 South Langley Avenue in Chicago into his personal bank account, and he failed to do any reconstruction or rehabilitation work to make the property habitable again, the suit said.\nPatel also allegedly used over $7,600 transferred out of a Racine Street property to pay his personal mortgage; used another $1,650 to make a Range Rover car payment; and then took another $2,400 to make a Mercedes car payment, the lawsuit says. He extracted $4,400 out of another property to make car payments, the suit said.\nHe\u2019s also accused of deceiving his clients into thinking their property\u2019s bills were paid. Patel provided investors images of checks that he claimed had been used to pay for property taxes and other bills, but the lawsuit said \u201cthese checks were never actually mailed or remitted to the proper recipient.\u201d\n\u201cIn many cases, Patel aggressively evaded and delayed requests for financial information with dubious excuses,\u201d the suit said. For example, Lampert and Wolkowicki said Patel dodged questions and asked for more time to respond last December about a $72,000 transfer, claiming his father had recently died. The couple later found out that wasn\u2019t true, the suit said.\nPatel also pledged rental revenues from various properties he was managing as collateral to secure loans from outfits including Itria Ventures, which is a \u201cpayday lender\u201d of sorts for business owners that provides capital up front in return for receiving future lease payments. Itria and another similar company are suing Patel for allegedly defaulting on his agreements with them, too.\nWolkowicki says the alleged misconduct has damaged his relationships with lenders, triggered legal actions regarding personal guarantees he signed to collateralize millions of dollars in debt and amounted to his own big financial losses.\nIn the interim settlement agreement Patel signed with Wolkowicki and Lampert earlier this year, he conceded that many of the transfers described in their lawsuit were improper and benefited Patel personally, the complaint said. They\u2019re asking for a judgment against Patel of no less than $10.8 million.\n",

        "content": "AMLI Residential is proposing a 56-story residential makeover for a prime corner in Chicago\u2019s Magnificent Mile, potentially the first new tower in the area in years.\nAccording to a newsletter from 42nd Ward Alderman Brendan Reilly, the Chicago-based developer is seeking to build a 498-unit tower at 669 North Michigan Avenue, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The project would stack nearly 27,000 square feet of retail across its first two floors, topped by a garage with 199 parking spaces. AMLI\u2019s plans also include a rooftop deck and pool. Roughly 10 percent of the apartments would be priced as affordable, with the developer making an in-lieu payment to meet the city\u2019s full requirements. The proposed apartment building was designed by the firm Solomon Cordwell Buenz.\nThe site is currently home to a 57,000-square-foot retail property anchored by a Nike store. A predecessor of Mark Capital Management paid $295 million in 2015 for that building and two others on the block. The London-based firm did not respond to requests for comment on AMLI\u2019s proposal.\nReilly cast the plan as a vote of confidence for a corridor still shaking off its pandemic funk. The Mag Mile\u2019s retail vacancy rate is hovering around 30 percent, according to Kirsch Agency data, though landlords have seen some leasing momentum.\n\u201cThis project represents continued private investment along the Magnificent Mile,\u201d Reilly told constituents, arguing it will help keep the strip \u201can active and attractive corridor.\u201d\n\nAMLI, which developed\nseveral\nlarge Chicago rental complexes in the South Loop and River North previously, carries a portfolio of tower projects in\nvarious\ncorners around the country. The developer didn\u2019t\ndisclose\nthe tower\u2019s estimated cost or timeline. The proposal still requires Chicago City Council approval.\nThe move comes as apartment rents continue to climb downtown, fueled by limited supply. With few projects scheduled to deliver in the next 18 months, net rents at top-tier buildings have reached $3.99 per square foot, according to Integra Realty Resources.\nIf greenlit, AMLI\u2019s tower would join a wave of residential reinvestment creeping onto Michigan Avenue. At 500 North Michigan Avenue, a 320-unit office-to-apartment conversion is also in the\nworks\n. The projects suggest developers are betting the Mag Mile\u2019s future lies not just in retail but in a fuller blend of uses.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "San Antonio\u2019s housing inventory declined last month, bucking the national trend.\nListings in San Antonio dropped by 249 homes, or 1.6 percent, from a year ago, according to Homes.com. Among the top 40 metropolitan areas in the country, San Antonio\u2019s only bedfellow was San Francisco, second from the bottom with 27 fewer listings than last August. Every other major city added homes to the market. To give a sense of scale, the country\u2019s top city for housing abundance last month was\nHouston\n, where inventory swelled 22 percent to surpass 43,000 listings, a national record.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strange position for a Sun Belt market like San Antonio to be in at the moment,\u201d CoStar analyst Daniel Khalil said. \u201cFor San Antonio really to be the only major Sun Belt market to see a decrease year over year \u2014 it\u2019s a small decrease, almost flat \u2014 I think that speaks to the resiliency of San Antonio as a market.\u201d\nSan Antonio also clocked the\nhighest rate of canceled home sales\nin the country earlier this year, when sellers were reluctant to adjust their expectations to the budding\nbuyer\u2019s market\n, local agents said.\nNow it looks like sellers are deciding to wait.\n\u201cA lot of people have really good equity and really good rates on their property, so they\u2019re just holding tight,\u201d said Clint Neal, co-founder of San Antonio brokerage Neal and Neal.\n\nAlthough buyers are wielding more negotiating power, San Antonio isn\u2019t quite a buyer\u2019s market, said Keller Williams of San Antonio president Grant Lopez.\n\u201cIt feels to a lot of people like we\u2019re in a down market. We\u2019re actually not. We\u2019re just back to our normal market that we always operated on,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cIt\u2019s like running on a treadmill: If you\u2019re used to running five miles an hour, and you up it to ten for a good, long while \u2014 if you lower it down, it\u2019s going to feel like you\u2019re walking suddenly. But you\u2019re not walking; you just had a long sprint.\u201d\nSan Antonio prices have wavered marginally this year, with a median price of $265,000, according to Redfin.\nNorth Texas, Houston and Austin have experienced larger price declines this year, Khalil said. The median sale price in Houston \u2014 about $336,000 \u2014 hasn\u2019t turned positive year over year since April, aside from a brief period in the latter half of August when it was 1 percent higher, according to Redfin. Dallas has undergone a similar trend, with year-over-year declines stretching as far as 5 percent in May; at present, Dallas\u2019 median price of $412,000 is 1 percent higher year over year. Austin\u2019s median sale price, which stands at $440,000 now, trailed the previous year\u2019s price between December and August. Other Sun Belt markets, such as Phoenix and Orlando, have modestly but definitely depreciated.\n\u201cWe need this kind of stabilization to happen at a certain point, because it just can\u2019t continue to rise and rise and rise,\u201d Lopez said.\n",

The board of the Academy of Magical Arts supports the deal video game mogul Pitchford has proposed, while some of the rank-and-file of the magicians group are skeptical.\n\u201cThe easiest people to fool are magicians,\u201d one AMA member quipped, per the Times.\nA new Magic Castle Club, separate from the Academy of Magical Arts, would collect dues and split revenue between Pitchford\u2019s Magic Castle Enterprises and the nonprofit tenant.\nPitchford\u2019s employees would run the bar, restaurant, gift shop and valet while the AMA would dedicate itself to nonprofit programming. The AMA board of directors would shrink from nine members to five, with two of them nominated by Pitchford\u2019s companies.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest chapter in a yearslong saga at the institution.\nIn 2020, the Magic Castle faced a pandemic shutdown followed by a Los Angeles Times\ninvestigation\nuncovering alleged sexual harassment, groping and racism. The Edwardian-style mansion reopened in 2021 after a leadership overhaul.\nPitchford bought the establishment as well as an adjacent apartment building and the 33-key Magic Hotel next door in 2022.. He also bought intellectual property rights to the Magic Castle name from AMA patriarch Milt Larsen, who died the following year.\nPitchford and his wife, Kristy Pitchford, created companies to manage the holdings once they came under their control. Magic Castle Enterprises handles intellectual property, while Magic Castle Entertainment handles real estate. Together, they\u2019re known as MCE. Erika Larsen, daughter of castle pioneers Bill and Irene Larsen, was tapped to be president of Magic Castle Enterprises, while Bill and Irene Larsen\u2019s granddaughter Jessica Hopkins joined as chief operating officer.\nAMA board members have until Sept. 29 to decide how to proceed.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Glendenning is eyeing a mass timber office building of 40,000 to 60,000 square feet, with plans to occupy about a quarter of the space and lease out the rest. He hopes to start construction next fall and taking 18 months. Celina is about 40 miles north of Downtown Dallas and has a population of about 30,000.\nTwo Celina sites are in play. The first is King Place, a 600-acre mixed-use development that Glendenning calls his \u201clegacy project.\u201d Located just north of Glendenning Parkway, it already has $40 million of infrastructure in place and\nties\ninto the Dallas North Tollway extension scheduled for completion in 2027. The other option is Shawnee Trail, a billion-dollar mixed-use project under construction that\u2019s\nslated\nto deliver the city\u2019s first Walmart Supercenter.\nFor Glendenning, the move is more than just a business decision. His family history in Celina dates the 1880s, and their longhorn cattle still\ngraze\nthe land where King Place is set to rise.\n\n\u201cWhat the Bass family was to downtown Fort Worth, what the Carpenter family was to Los Colinas, and what the Trammell Crow family was to Dallas, the Glendennings are that for Celina,\u201d Rex Real Estate agent Matthew Kiran told the outlet.\nGlendenning hinted he\u2019s leaning toward King Place, but said he\u2019s waiting for the 360 Tollway extension and the right partners before\nlaunching\nvertical construction. He believes the project could attract a major corporate tenant, pointing to Westlake\u2019s success in luring Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investments.

He purchased the unit for\n$23.5 million\nin 2017.\nThe buyer of Unit 6W is Evan Cheng, the co-founder and CEO of cryptocurrency company Mysten Labs. Cheng, who was previously an engineering director at Facebook before it rebranded to Meta, purchased the apartment in what appears to be an off-market deal.\nA previous listing describes the unit as having four bedrooms and five bathrooms. It also features an eat-in kitchen and views of Central Park and the facade of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\nThe 17-unit co-op was built in 1912. The property is known for housing a long list of prominent residents, such as financier Murry Guggenheim, former Vice President Levi Morton and former Secretary of State Elihu Root.\n\nLauder has sought to offload several of his properties in recent years, including his 12th-floor apartment at 778 Park Avenue, which hit the market in December asking just under $27 million. He dropped the asking price of the five-bedroom co-op to $25 million earlier this year.\nLauder bought the 12th-floor unit from another cosmetics mogul, former Revlon owner Ronald Perelman, for $24 million in 2023. It is one of two apartments Lauder owned in the building, the other of which he bought in 2008 for $27.5 million. He listed the 14th-floor unit in 2019 for\n$45 million\n, though it appears he never found a buyer for it.\nHowever, Lauder found more success for his sprawling oceanfront property in Palm Beach, which he found a buyer for earlier this year. If the land trades for its\n$178 million\nasking price, it will set a new record for Florida\u2019s priciest residential sale.\nLauder listed the two lots for $200 million in 2023, the same year he purchased Rush Limbaugh\u2019s former Palm Beach estate for\n$155 million\n.\n",

Thor\u2019s Peter McEneaney said Coney Island had \u201cdefinitely fallen on hard times\u201d and \u201cthe only way to correct that is a generational type project like this.\u201d\nShould the CAC reject the Coney Island casino, it would thin the ranks of contenders for a downstate gaming license.\nIn the last week, all three of the casino projects still on the table in Manhattan were excised, capped by the\nSoloviev Group\u2019s defeat\nfor its Freedom Plaza site on Monday morning.\nOnly four proposals remain outside of The Coney: Mets owner Steve Cohen\u2019s project at Citi Field, Bally\u2019s proposal in the Throgg\u2019s Neck area of the Bronx, Genting\u2019s proposed casino in Jamaica, Queens and a site in Yonkers from MGM. Should the latter two have an advantage by virtue of being \u201cracinos,\u201d the last license could come down to a one-on-one competition.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "AcadeMir Charter Schools hit the books and picked up more land in west Miami-Dade County.\nThe Miami-based charter school paid $20.5 million for eight parcels of vacant land between Southwest 148th Avenue, Southwest 30th Street and Southwest 147th Avenue in unincorporated Miami-Dade. The land totals 9.2 acres.\nAcadeMir also acquired a 1.3-acre plot that\u2019s northwest of Coral Way and Southwest 157th Avenue for an undisclosed amount, property records show.\nMiami-based Faro Investments, led by Julio Rodriguez, sold the parcels.\nAcadeMir has been expanding its portfolio. The company, which is managed by Superior Charter Schools Services,\nrecently purchased\none of its campuses in South Miami Heights for $25 million. AcadeMir\u2019s board of directors includes Alexander Casas, Dr. Tirso Alonso, Joanna Noriega, Sonia Alfaro, Ruben Perez and Michael Rodriguez. Casas shares the same name as Florida International University\u2019s chief of police. According to his LinkedIn, he has a background in higher education.\n\nLast year, AcadeMir paid\n$16.6 million\nfor its campus at 13330 Southwest 288th Street in Homestead.\nRestrictive zoning and other factors have limited the supply of charter school\nsites\n, making the ones that exist a popular investment, experts have told\nThe Real Deal.\nParents in South Florida are also increasingly seeking non-traditional education options, boosting demand. The public school systems in Miami-Dade and Broward have seen a drop in enrollment.\nLast month, Aventura-based charter school developer MG3 Group sold a portfolio of seven school campuses across Florida for a combined\n$172.4 million\nto BridgePrep Academy. The deal included two South Florida properties at 13300 Southwest 120th Street in Kendall and 3500 Northwest 89th Court in Doral, which sold for $46.5 million and $44.9 million, respectively.\nTwo years ago, Renaissance Charter School paid\n$38.2 million\nfor its K-8 campuses at 6701 West Sunrise Boulevard in Plantation and at 8399 North University Drive in Tamarac.\nIn 2021, MG3 sold eight Florida charter schools for a total of\n$242 million\nto nonprofit Educational Growth Fund. The deal included the Everglades Preparatory Academy middle school at 2251 Mowry Drive in Homestead, and the Avant Garde Academy at 2025 McKinley Street in Hollywood.\n",

Azusa Pacific University sold the vacant apartments to the privately owned real estate company, per property records recorded earlier this month.\nThe apartment community is minutes away from the private school. The California Municipal Finance Authority previously\nprovided\nthe university with tax-exempt financing for the apartments to become student housing. But the apartments were\nunderutilized\n, and the university opted for a sale.\nMesa West Capital provided a $68.5 million loan for the 320-apartment acquisition.\nThe property was presented as a vacant multifamily community in the San Gabriel Valley primed for repositioning, per a CBRE offering memorandum. The apartments at 801 East Alosta Avenue, now called Citrus Place rather than University Village, will begin leasing soon, per a social media post by Legacy Partners \u2014 which is based in Foster City, a master-planned community in the Bay Area.\nThe San Gabriel Valley has a 4.1 percent vacancy rate, per a second-quarter Lee &amp; Associates market report. Apartments command an average monthly asking rent at $2,018; and the average unit sale price is $285,805. That\u2019s around what Legacy Partners purchased the apartments for \u2014 $286,875 apiece.\n\nIn the San Gabriel Valley, the top sale in Q2 was Community Housing Works\u2019 126 apartments purchased from Stratford Partners, according to the market report. The apartments at 1940 Fullerton Road in Rowland Heights were sold for $38.3 million, or $303,968 per unit. The other two sales were for less than $10 million.\nThree years ago, Azusa Pacific University cashed out of a separate apartment building portfolio in the area in an $81 million\ndeal\n; the three properties near campus totaled 316 apartments.\nLegacy Partners, earlier this summer, came closer to\nredeveloping\nthe Los Angeles Chargers\u2019 former training facility in Costa Mesa into a mixed-use destination.\nLegacy Partners and Azusa Pacific University did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "The winds of change are blowing from the San Francisco Bay over Alameda Point.\nA commercial building, known as Building 92, at the former naval air base is poised to come under the ownership of one of three interested parties, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nLocal investors Riaz Capital, SrmErnst and Alameda Point Redevelopers have been vying to buy the 89,000-square-foot building at 650 West Tower Avenue in competing bids. One investor has been chosen for continued negotiations, though Alameda\u2019s director of base reuse and economic development Abby Thorne-Lyman didn\u2019t disclose which, the outlet said.\nThe city of Alameda has been\ntrying to sell the property\nfor two years as part of its effort to offload buildings and lease out others to close funding gaps for infrastructure upgrades. Alameda city officials opened a request for proposals seeking a buyer earlier this year.\nRiaz Capital\u2019s plan for Building 92 involves developing a smaller version of Arthaus Studios, a 100,000-square-foot artist and maker space in East Oakland. Riaz owns thousands of\nresidential units\nacross the Bay Area, but the company\u2019s Alameda Point proposal doesn\u2019t include housing, founder Riaz Taplin told the outlet.\nAlameda Point Redevelopers similarly floated a plan to divide the property into three spaces for arts, culture and entertainment tenants. Three companies have already expressed interest in renting space there under this plan, project manager Jonah Hendrickson told the Business Times.\n\nUnder SrmErnst\u2019s plan, the building would be converted into several small and mid-sized research and development and advanced manufacturing suites. The existing R&amp;D space at Alameda Point is in large warehouses and airplane hangars, leaving few options for smaller companies.\nIt would be another play at Alameda Point for\nSrmErnst\n, which already owns two buildings near Building 92. Those buildings are leased to Almanac Brewing, Kairos Power, Artisan Breads and Admiral Malting.\nBuilding 92 is in Alameda Point\u2019s Adaptive Reuse District, which is zoned for uses including retail, artist studios, office space, food and beverage production and manufacturing.\nThe Alameda City Council will discuss price and terms of payment with the selected buyer over the next few months, with a vote to approve the sale coming after that.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "San Francisco\u2019s vacant historic buildings could go from being relics to fresh real estate.\nMayor Daniel Lurie\nintroduced legislation that would make it easier for businesses like nonprofits, retailers, movie theaters and nightlife operators to set up shop in one of the city\u2019s approximately 300 historic buildings without having to endure lengthy approval processes, the San Francisco Examiner\nreported\n.\nLurie\u2019s proposed legislation aims to deal with the reality that tenants in historic buildings foot the bill for repairs requiring specialized, nonstandard materials and the maintenance of aging utility systems. Preservation standards currently in place, which keep buildings\u2019 historic character and prevent certain alterations to these structures, also present a hurdle to potential tenants.\nWhile those preservation protections won\u2019t be going anywhere, Lurie is looking to attract tenants to officially designated historic buildings with special incentives for businesses and nonprofits to operate in landmarked buildings. The city would enable such activity by relaxing zoning rules dictating what types of business operations can take place in a given neighborhood.\nTake the historic St. Joseph\u2019s Church building in South of Market. After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the structure sat damaged and unoccupied for decades. In 2018, the St. Joseph\u2019s Arts Society reopened the building as a performance and cultural events venue. Since then, the city of San Francisco has implemented more incentive programs for historic buildings in specific neighborhoods, hoping to recreate the rebirth of St. Joseph\u2019s Church.\n\n\u201cAdding greater flexibility for these special buildings will ensure they won\u2019t fall into disrepair due to disinvestment,\u201d the Mayor\u2019s Office\nsaid\nof the proposal.\nThe Tenderloin Museum could be another candidate for a St. Joseph\u2019s-style renaissance under Lurie\u2019s new proposal, part of his\nPermitSF\ninitiative designed to\ncut red tape across the city\nto spur development.\nEarlier this year, the nonprofit museum at Eddy and Leavenworth Streets announced expansion plans that would triple its operating footprint to approximately 10,000 square feet on the first floor of the historic Cadillac Hotel building, complete with a new special exhibition room and a new neon sign gallery. But because of restrictions limiting size to such projects, the expansion project would have to get special approval from the city\u2019s Planning Commission. Lurie\u2019s proposal would allow such an endeavor to proceed without further public review.\nFor now, Lurie\u2019s legislation awaits public review.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Starting bids were expected around $15 million and the auction lasted from Sept. 4 and concluded with live bidding Sept. 17 conducted by the Upper House in Hong Kong.\nThe home was originally listed in Aug. 2024 for $27.5 million, making it one of the\nmost expensive listings in Texas\nlast year. That also means the winning bid was about half the listing price. The seller is music producer Dirk Ulrich.\nBefore Ulrich\nbought the house in May 2023\n, the house had undergone multiple price reductions. It hit the market in 2021 for almost $25 million. It didn\u2019t sell until after the listing went viral on Zillow Gone Wild and the price dropped to $17.9 million.\nBuilt in 2016 on nearly 4 acres near Grapevine Lake, the\neight-bedroom, 11-bathroom estate\nfeatures a bowling alley, gym, indoor jump house, three chef\u2019s kitchens, a wine room that can store 2,100 bottles, a recording studio and a backyard pool split between a main swimming area and a 30-foot-deep diving pool with a slide. There\u2019s also a 2,000-square-foot guesthouse with its own entrance and parking. The turf in the backyard was repurposed from NRG Stadium used during Super Bowl LI in Houston.\n\nUlrich added a Dolby Atmos 3D audio studio last year as part of a remodel. The soundproof space connects digitally to a performance stage in the basement and can convert into a private screening room.\nThe property was represented through the auction by Brad Cook of Real Broker LLC and Michael Hershenberg of The Hershenberg Group. According to Concierge Auctions, buyers pay a 12 percent \u201cbuyer\u2019s premium\u201d at auction on top of the purchase price for a home, and co-brokers receive 2 percent.\nThe Dallas-Fort Worth metro continues to outpace the rest of Texas in\nhome sales over $10 million\n. Also on Grapevine Lake, an estate at 1711 Maranatha Way was the most-expensive listing in Texas last month. The five-bedroom, seven-bathroom house spans 8,000 square feet and is asking $8.75 million.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

A majority of the buildings contain rent-stabilized units. The news was first reported by\nBloomberg\n.\nThe auction plan is the result of a bankruptcy case filed by the Wiener-connected parties in May. In total, the bankrupt parties owe lender Flagstar Bank more than $564 million.\nThe marketing process for the buildings began last week, according to court documents, although the terms still require approval from a federal judge.\nEastdil Secured, working on behalf of the bankrupt party, has received confidentiality agreements from 50 interested buyers, according to court documents. Lawyers have proposed a December 12 deadline for potential buyers to submit a bid and an auction on January 8. Tenant leases will remain in effect if there is a purchase or refinancing.\n\nPinnacle has fallen behind on maintenance in the affected buildings. Housing code violations considered \u201cimmediately hazardous\u201d increased fourfold at the affected buildings between 2019 and 2014, double the rate at similar rent-stabilized buildings, according to city data analyzed by Bloomberg.\nLawyers for the bankrupt entities blamed the financial troubles on high interest rates, inflation in expenses, weak collections and tenant-friendly state legislation. The buildings generated more than $84 million in 2024, according to financial documents cited by Bloomberg.\nWiener was among the first New York real estate players to tap into the Israeli bond market for financing, raising more than $500 million. His Zarasai Group, a British Virgin Islands company, is now in the process of restructuring $275 million (1 billion Israeli shekels) in bonds issued on the Tel Aviv stock exchange.

Beverly Hills-based Nimes secured the three-year, floating-rate loan with two 12-month extension options from Atlanta-based Peachtree Group.\nNimes bought the 132-room hotel at 322 North Pass Avenue in 2019 from\nPebblebrook Hotel Trust\n, dropping $72.9 million on the property, before completing a multimillion-dollar renovation.\nThe hotel, under Nimes\u2019 ownership, faced business challenges from the onset of the pandemic in early 2020 and the five-month Writers Guild of America strike in 2023, Keegan Bisch, vice president of originations and credit at\nPeachtree\n, told CO. The recapitalization will enable the hotel to stabilize, thanks in part to its location in the middle of the Burbank Media District.\n\nIts proximity to\nWarner Bros.\nand Disney Studios already makes it the top booking hotel in the L.A. region for both studios, according to CO. \u201cThere is already a ton of in-place demand that they draw from,\u201d Bisch said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very high-quality, renovated hotel, plus there is a lot of growth in the market, so they are well positioned to take advantage of that.\u201d\nWarner Bros. is in the midst of a 30-acre expansion of its campus a mile away from the hotel which is expected to drive traffic to the lodging property. In addition to the growth of the Warner Bros. complex, Disney\u2019s move to consolidate its 52-acre Fox Studio Lot in Burbank, as well as NBCUniversal\u2019s addition of more than 1.2 million square feet of new office and production space, are also expected to increase visitorship to the Hotel Amarano.\nOther nearby hotel properties include The Tangerine at 3901 West Riverside Drive, a Best Western Plus at 3910 West Riverside Drive, and the Coast Burbank Hotel at 2011 West Olive Avenue.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A penthouse condo at the 101-story St. Regis tower that was part of a bulk investment by a firm tied to a Mexican denim magnate sold quietly for $7.5 million last month in an off-market deal.\nThe four-bedroom, 6,300-square-foot 79th-floor penthouse sold on Aug. 1, property records show. It was bought under a land trust that obscures the buyer\u2019s identity. The price tag makes it among the priciest units sold at the Jeanne Gang-designed skyscraper at 363 East Wacker Drive.\nThe seller of the penthouse was an LLC linked to GD Holdings, the real estate arm of Grupo Denim, a Mexican clothing company run by Salomon Juan Marcos Villarreal. The firm\nspent $117.5 million in 2024\nto buy 84 condos at the tower that its developer had yet to sell.\nThe latest sale is at least the fifth of GD Holdings\u2019 units to trade for more than $5 million this year amid downtown Chicago\u2019s struggling luxury condo market. It has sold at least 24 other units at the tower, property records show. Concerns about crime and fewer in-office workers after the pandemic have depressed condo values in some downtown segments and many\nunits throughout the city have sold at a loss\n.\nBut the market may be poised for a turnaround. Rafael Murillo, a Compass agent who has brokered several deals in the St. Regis Tower, said buyers are showing renewed interest in downtown properties, seeing an opportunity to get a discount before the recovery. Newer buildings like the St. Regis are moving units quickly, even if they\u2019re selling at lower prices than they could have fetched a few years ago, he said.\n\n\u201cRight now is a great time to buy,\u201d said Murillo, who wasn\u2019t involved in the 79th floor unit sale. \u201cAffluent buyers are taking advantage of these opportunities, knowing that in the next few years, the downtown market is likely to see steady, healthy growth. We\u2019re in the recovery phase.\u201d\nThe condo sold without being publicly listed, so there is little information about the unit\u2019s price history and whether real estate agents represented the buyer or seller in the deal. An archived version of the St. Regis Residences webpage shows the 79th floor unit was listed at just under $9.8 million in May, which is about 25 percent higher than the final $7.5 million sale price. The webpage also showed a similar unit on the 82nd floor listed at $10.5 million. That unit is no longer listed for sale on the website, but, so far, there has been no sale of that condo recorded in Cook County property records.\nAnother penthouse with a similar floor plan, on the 73rd floor, is currently listed on the website at $8.25 million.\nThe St. Regis\u2019s developer, Magellan Development Group, which remained in charge of marketing the property after GD Holdings\u2019 bulk purchase, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. And Magellan\u2019s sales chief Leila Zammatta did not respond to a request for comment. GD Holdings could not be reached.\nThe priciest deal by far among the luxury residences at the St. Regis came in 2022, when Mexican mining CEO German Larrea\nspent $20 million for a two-floor\n, 10,000 square-foot penthouse across the building\u2019s 71st and 72nd floors. At least three other units have traded for more than $8 million: The 76th floor unit\nsold for $8.3 million in 2025\n, the 91st floor sold for $9.2 million and the 87th floor sold for $9 million, both in 2022.\nThe 78th floor penthouse\nsold for $7 million in 2024\n, a loss for the sellers who purchased it at $8.2 million.",

        "content": "Residents on the West and South sides of Chicago should buckle up for what\u2019s likely to be big jumps in their homes\u2019 tax assessments, extending a trend of the past two years.\nMore than 37,000 homes on the South and West sides saw their assessments double between 2023 and 2024, with parts of Englewood, Roseland and North Lawndale hit by median hikes ranging from 119 percent to 160 percent, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\nin partnership with the Illinois Answers Project. By comparison, the citywide median increase was about 22 percent, with affluent neighborhoods like the Gold Coast rising only 3 percent.\nMayor Brandon Johnson saw a 35 percent increase on his West Side home in the Austin neighborhood. The uneven pattern has left lower-income communities shouldering much of the pain stemming from rising property tax levies, even as their home values still trail the city at large.\nThe steep increases are expected to put struggling homeowners in a bind this fall when\nproperty tax bills come due\n. With property taxes in historically lower-valued and lower-income neighborhoods rising to make them unaffordable for current residents, there\u2019s few places for them to turn. Neighborhoods such as Englewood and North Lawndale will still have some of the lowest overall assessed property values, but their residents already experience some of the highest rates of poverty in the city.\nLeodus Thomas Jr., for example, who is also an Austin resident, said he bought his home for $135,000 in 2016 and has spent the past decade rehabbing other distressed properties to put them back on the tax rolls, he told the newspaper. Now, rising assessments threaten to upend his work.\n\u201cWe find properties and get them back on the tax roll \u2014 but lately we\u2019ve been punished for that, big-time,\u201d Thomas told the outlet.\nThomas\u2019 home was valued by the county at $163,000 just two years ago. Now, it\u2019s pegged at $260,000 \u2014 pushing his annual bill up by about $700. His spike is far from the worst.\nThe hikes are fueling fears of displacement and stalling investment. While rising assessments don\u2019t automatically increase tax bills,\nCook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi\u2019s office admits\nhomes with above-average increases face higher risks of steep rises.\n\nAssessments are legally tied to market activity, and Kaegi\u2019s staff points to investors buying up cheap lots and rehabbing older homes as the main driver. The pattern echoes earlier\ngentrification\ncycles in Pilsen and Logan Square, where sudden valuation spikes triggered tax revolts. Kaegi\u2019s staff sees these factors as the potential start of gentrification in these West and South side neighborhoods.\nSome homeowners are protected by exemptions. Retired CTA worker Clarence Hunt avoided a $1,700 bill after his senior freeze capped his home\u2019s taxable value at $60,000. But many longtime residents either don\u2019t know about such programs or don\u2019t apply, leaving them vulnerable.\nDevelopers and nonprofits active in Englewood and Lawndale have warned recently that speculative buyers \u2014 often LLCs scooping up multiple properties \u2014 are\ninflating comparable sales without investing\nin community needs.\nTax pressures could intensify. Chicago Public Schools and other taxing bodies have hiked levies in recent years, and the county treasurer\u2019s office recently found that appeals at the Board of Review have shifted nearly $2 billion in tax burden from commercial owners onto homeowners since 2021. Kaegi pitched a \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d bill in Springfield to soften shocks, but the proposal stalled.\nResidents like Thomas are left to juggle rising bills with fragile development plans for the time being.\n\u201cComing from the top, they want affordable housing in the city,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s almost impossible with how we\u2019re being taxed.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The redevelopment of Fort Worth\u2019s Woodhaven Country Club is galloping along, amid protests of NIMBY neighbors and the cloud of a legal battle involving the site.\nThe shuttered 163-acre property went into foreclosure and\nwas purchased last year for $8.5 million\nby Crescendo Development, led by investor\nWill Northern\n. The firm has since won\nzoning for a sweeping mixed-use redevelopment\nat 913 Country Club Lane in East Fort Worth that could bring a community center, housing, office space, an urban farm and a revamped golf course, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. Supporters \u2014 including the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce and local neighborhood groups \u2014 say the plan could revitalize an area long dominated by aging apartments and single-family homes.\nOpponents argue the project doesn\u2019t fit the community\u2019s demographics and fear it could displace longtime residents. At a Sept. 17 City Plan Commission meeting, Crescendo pitched the project as a $167.7 million private investment that would create nearly 1,000 jobs and generate $15.6 million in new tax revenue over the next decade. Commissioners delayed a vote until Oct. 1 to give residents more time to digest the application and review property impact studies.\nThe development push also comes with drama, as Northern\u2019s former business partner \u2014 Fort Worth City Council member Michael Crain \u2014\nsued him in June\n, claiming he was cut out of the Woodhaven deal. Crain\u2019s attorneys called it a \u201cpersonal betrayal,\u201d while Northern\u2019s legal team blasted the suit as a political play.\nThe suit also names a substitute trustee tied to the acquisition and seeks more than $1 million in damages, along with temporary and permanent injunctions to halt further action on the land. Crain abstained from the February rezoning vote.\n\nThe case has since been moved to the newly-created Texas Business Court, where Judge Jerry Bullard will preside. Crain\u2019s lawyers are trying to kick it back to state district court, arguing the deal doesn\u2019t meet the $5 million threshold for the new court\u2019s jurisdiction. Lawmakers in Texas recently lowered the minimum claim in business courts from $10 million. A hearing is set for Oct. 6 at Texas A&amp;M\u2019s Fort Worth campus.\nIn the meantime, Crescendo has started marketing slices of the property online. A 62-acre tract at 5500 Randol Mill Road is listed on LoopNet for $4 million, or about $65,000 an acre, while a Crexi posting shows the land has been up for grabs for nearly six months.\nCrescendo continues to pitch the Woodhaven project as a once-in-a-generation chance to reimagine a struggling corner of East Fort Worth, provided the courtroom wrangling doesn\u2019t derail the momentum.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Developer Aldo Stark found a buyer for the Stone Creek Ranch mansion he\u2019s seeking to flip for $45 million.\nIt was the top luxury contract signed in Palm Beach County last week. Buyers signed 11 contracts between Sept. 15 and Sept. 21 for luxury properties in Palm Beach County, according to a market report from\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s\nEklund-Gomes\nteam. The homes that went pending last week total $103.9 million in asking dollar volume and averaged 72 days on the market. That\u2019s up from\n$53.6 million\nin asking dollar volume for 11 homes the previous week.\nThe team\u2019s report tracks signed contracts for single-family homes and condos asking $3 million or more in the Beaches MLS. It identified 37 new listings, and a total of 1,017 active listings on the market.\nOf the properties that found buyers last week, nine were single-family homes and two were condos. The condos that went pending are asking an average of $8.8 million, or $1,499 per square foot, and spent an average of 31 days on the market.\nThe single-family homes total $95.1 million in asking dollar volume and averaged 114 days on the market. The average asking price works out to $10.6 million.\n\nThe most expensive home to find a buyer is spec developer Aldo Stark\u2019s 17,800-square-foot mansion at 9200 Rockybrook Way in\nStone Creek Ranch\n, asking $45 million. Stone Creek Ranch is a gated community in unincorporated Palm Beach County near Delray Beach. Stark bought the property in January for\n$26 million\nfrom the Ohio-based Cafaro family, whose late patriarch, William M. Cafaro, is credited with pioneering the American mall. The 2.7-acre estate was built in 2017 and includes a main house with seven bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, two half-bathrooms, a theater, wine room, gym and sauna, as well as a guest house, pool and cigar lounge, the listing shows.\nStark listed it for $45 million in March, Zillow shows. Senada Ad\u017eem with Douglas Elliman has the listing.\nThe second-priciest listing to find a buyer last week is the 5,600-square-foot waterfront home at 13209 Rolling Green Road asking $8.5 million. The 1.2-acre estate is in unincorporated Palm Beach County near\nNorth Palm Beach\n. Records show the seller is Dr. Gregory Delange, a cosmetic surgeon based in West Palm Beach. He bought the home for $6.8 million in 2023, according to property records. Built in 2014, the house has five bedrooms, five bathrooms, two half-bathrooms, a pool, a dock and 135 feet of frontage on the Intracoastal Waterway, records and the listing show.\nIt hit the market for $12.5 million last year, Zillow shows. Michael Ivancevic with Illustrated Properties has the listing.\n",

The Minnesota-based firm paid $30.1 million for it in 2015. Axial has been trying to unload the asset for more than two years, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. But rising rates and investor skittishness over offices stalled a deal. When listed at the end of 2022, the asking price was $31.4 million.\nThe firm is facing\npressure\nfrom a $21 million mortgage originated by Jacksonville-based Everbank, which matured in December. Rather than take the keys, the lender teamed with Axial to test the market for a sale that would at least clear the outstanding debt, a person familiar with the offering told the outlet. No asking price has been set. Clearing the mortgage alone would be about $111 per square foot.\nIt\u2019s a scenario playing out across Chicagoland, where\nrecord\nvacancies, remote work and expensive debt have landlords scrambling to refinance or hand properties back to lenders. Some banks are\nseizing\nbuildings outright, while others are opting for sales to cut losses.\nAxial is betting its building looks better than most, as the property is fully leased to medical device makers BD and Steris through 2031. BD is downsizing by nearly half next year, when it will exit 79,000 square feet. That leaves a looming hole Colliers is pitching as a future upside.\n\nThe flyer highlights the building\u2019s positioning in a Lake County cluster of life sciences tenants that have historically stuck around longer than typical office users. Neighbors include AbbVie, Abbott, Baxter and Pfizer. When Axial\nsold\nthe Bannockburn Corporate Center last year for $28 million \u2014 close to what it fetched in 2016 \u2014 it showed an appetite in the market for suburban offices with strong-credit tenants.\nBuilt in 1996, the Vernon Hills property is part of Continental Executive Park, just south of the Hawthorn Mall, itself in the\nmidst\nof a $252 million makeover with apartments, restaurants and open-air plazas.

The group landed a $135 million construction loan for The Lucy at 619 Grove Street, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n.\nKennedy Wilson provided the construction financing for the 444-unit project. On top of that, funds managed by PCCP invested into the project with an undisclosed amount of joint venture equity.\nA Cushman &amp; Wakefield team led by John Alascio brokered the debt deal and the equity transaction.\nThe 23-story property will consist of largely market-rate apartments, though there will be 13 affordable units. Other features include a rooftop pool, a sundeck replete with grills, outdoor terraces, a penthouse bar, coworking rooms, a fitness center, a game room and 251 parking spaces.\n\nThe design of the building, led by Michael Graves Architecture, will maintain much of the original structure of St. Lucy\u2019s Church, a historic Catholic church and rectory. Two years ago, Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Newark opened a 165-bed transitional housing facility across the street as part of the redevelopment.\n\u201cWe are proud to preserve the historic character of this site while creating a modern community that reflects Jersey City\u2019s dynamic growth,\u201d SJP chief executive officer Steven Pozycki said in a statement.\nElsewhere in the neighborhood, Adi Chugh\u2019s Tyko Capital last month\nprovided $358 million in construction financing\nfor the Namdar Group\u2019s projects at 29 Van Reipen Avenue and 612 Pavonia Avenue in Jersey City, expected to deliver more than 1,100 units to the Journal Square neighborhood.\nBlackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies also\nprovided a $515 million loan\nfor Kushner Companies\u2019 One Journal Square, which recently opened to residents. The development spans 2 million square feet across two 52-story towers, containing 1,723 units; the refinancing only covers the first phase of the development.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The Los Angeles Convention Center\u2019s long journey to expansion approval is seemingly nearing an end.\nOn Friday, the Los Angeles City Council\nvoted to proceed\nwith the latest plans to expand the downtown L.A. building with 190,000 square feet of new exhibit hall space, nearly 40,000 square feet of meeting space and a nearly 100,000-square-foot multi-service room, Commercial Observer\nreported\n.\nThe city is expected to cough up just over $2.6 billion via taxpayer money from its general fund,\naccording\nto the Los Angeles Times. The advancement of the expansion plans comes after more than 10 years and millions of public dollars spent on planning and revisions.\nMayor Karen Bass\n, several City Council members and some labor unions supported the expansion, saying the project invests in the future of Los Angeles as it deals with a budget deficit, insufficient tourism infrastructure and slow economic growth.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019m voting with my constituents, because I do believe in downtown,\u201d Council member Ysabel Jurado said before the vote, according to CO. \u201cAnd a strong downtown\u2026 needs this anchor in our communities to make sure we can rise again and rise to the occasion\u2026 It\u2019s about lifting up the entire city. And if we want a balanced budget and a thriving city, we need to invest.\u201d\nWhen all is said and done, the expanded Convention Center is expected to generate $652 million in general tax fund revenue over 30 years, as well as more than $150 million in annual visitor spending. In the construction period, 13,300 new jobs are expected to be created, with an additional 2,153 annual new jobs after the expansion is completed, per CO.\nThe city hopes to complete the first phase of the project in March 2028, four months ahead of the\nOlympics\nopening ceremony that July. Olympic and Paralympic events are slated to take place at the Convention Center, so if the project\u2019s first phase is delayed, they\u2019ll have to take place elsewhere. The full expansion project is expected to be finished in 2029.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The program is being seeded by a $50 million investment from the state, part of the housing plan included in the 2026 budget.\nUnder the program, up to 15 communities will be able to secure financing from the state in exchange for commitments to build at least 10 homes via manufactured housing on land free of zoning restrictions. The homes must be designed for middle and low-income residents.\nHomes have already been delivered in Syracuse, Schenectady and Newcomb. The goal is to deliver 200 manufactured and modular homes in the next year. Any company can bid to be part of the construction process.\n\u201cThis is the answer to how we can get the supply quickly,\u201d Gov. Kathy Hochul said to the Times, referencing the program and the manufactured housing process.\n\nManufactured housing comes in and out of vogue, particularly popping up at times of economic distress as the assembly and construction process often proves cheaper and more efficient than traditional homebuilding. But financing difficulties and stereotypes linking manufactured homes to trailer park properties keep them from gaining consistent momentum.\nSolving the stigmatization might be hard, but the state is hoping to solve financing problems by requiring the homes to be built on land that will be sold with the home and implementing federal housing design guidelines to help increase eligibility for a traditional mortgage.\nRather than penalizing municipalities for lack of participation, the state is\nproviding incentives\nfor cooperation, such as zero-point loans and partial grants.\nEvery home counts, but even if the program meets its goal, it will be a drop in the bucket next to the\n800,000 units\nthe state needs to address its housing shortage by the end of the decade, according to the Regional Plan Association.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Even before my\nprevious column\nabout the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmortgage fraud\u201d allegations against Letitia James, I knew many folks in the real estate industry despised the New York attorney general.\nTheir low opinion of her has since become even more obvious as some cheered President Donald Trump\u2019s revenge play, or argued that James had actually committed a crime.\nSome advice: When you\u2019re in a hole, stop digging.\nMore details have emerged showing just how weak the \u201cmortgage fraud\u201d claim is. It is beyond flimsy. I would call it laughable, except there is nothing really funny about a president fabricating criminal cases against political opponents.\nShould this ever reach a courtroom, any first-year law student could defend James and win, unless the jury were composed of Trump lackeys who\naccept $50,000 cash payments\nin food bags.\nAs in any real estate transaction, James signed a bunch of documents when she and her niece bought a house in Virginia for the niece to live in. One form was a limited power of attorney so her niece could do the closing without her. Drafted for a third-party closing company from a template that was never corrected, it indicated the house would be a primary residence.\nThat was the \u201cfraud,\u201d according to Bill Pulte, Trump\u2019s Federal Housing Finance Agency chief, and Ed Martin, the hack in charge of weaponizing the Department of Justice. Martin leads the department\u2019s Weaponization Working Group, if you can believe they actually named it that.\nPulte and Martin claimed this document allowed James to get a lower interest rate on the mortgage. But the document had nothing to do with her mortgage. The loan officers told investigators they never even considered it.\nMoreover, every other document in the transaction showed the Virginia home would not be James\u2019 primary residence. And it\u2019s no secret that she is New York\u2019s attorney general. Clearly, James was not trying to deceive anyone, nor did the single flawed form provide her any benefit.\nTo sum up, there was neither an intent to commit a crime nor a result. James\u2019 infraction was the equivalent of accidentally bringing a regular-size tube of toothpaste through airport security.\nEven critics of James freely admit the probe is retaliation by Trump for James\u2019 prosecution of him for inflating the value of his properties on loan applications. \u201cAbsolute stain on our democracy and its ideals,\u201d one lawyer emailed me. \u201cDisgusting power revenge play against a political enemy.\u201d\nThe lawyer, incidentally, insisted James\u2019 action was technically fraud because \u201cshe is responsible for what she signs.\u201d\nBut to prosecute someone for that is preposterous. Imagine stepping on gum while shopping, walking out of the store with the gum stuck to your shoe and being arrested for stealing it. That is the level of pettiness here.\n\nSo much actual crime \u2014 Medicare fraud, internet scams, you name it \u2014 with real victims is never pursued because law enforcement lacks the resources to do so. Yet in probing James, a team of investigators interviewed or put before a grand jury 15 people, including insurers, loan officers, underwriters, real estate agents and James\u2019 niece, according to\nABC News\n.\nTrump wasted prosecutors\u2019, witnesses\u2019 and jurors\u2019 time while making a mockery of the justice system and openly demonstrating a presidential abuse of authority.\nThe latest is that U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert, the\ntop federal prosecutor\nin the prestigious Eastern District of Virginia,\nwas fired\nfor refusing to bring the unwinnable and unjust case. Siebert was a\nTrump nominee\n.\nTrump replaced him with Maggie Clearly. It\u2019s ironic that in May she pledged \u201cto end politically weaponized investigations.\u201d\nAlthough James\u2019 prosecution of Trump was itself politically motivated, she did have a credible case: She won a conviction that was upheld by the well-respected Appellate Division, even as it threw out the gigantic financial penalty imposed by Judge Arthur Engoron.\nJames wasn\u2019t the only political target accused of mortgage fraud by the administration. So was Federal Reserve governor\nLisa Cook\n, whose crime against Trump was not lowering interest rates as quickly as he wanted (a power she does not unilaterally possess).\nTrump\u2019s people found standardized federal mortgage forms for her second-home purchase in Atlanta, indicating it would be her primary residence. But Reuters found that stipulation exists \u201c\nunless the lender agrees in writing\n,\u201d according to a document filed in a Georgia court for Cook\u2019s transaction.\nGuess what? The lender did agree in writing. \u201cProperty use: vacation home,\u201d its loan estimate says.\nPutting a cap on Pulte\u2019s farcical fraud hunt (an effort to endear himself to Trump), ProPublica\nreported\nthat three members of the president\u2019s cabinet claim primary-residence status on two mortgaged homes.\nThat is legal if each loan application was honestly made. Former House member Lee Zeldin, who owns a house on Long Island, bought a place in Washington when he joined the administration. So did Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary, who had purchased a New Jersey home with a principal residence loan in 2021.\nBut the third cabinet member\u2019s mortgage looks suspicious. \u201cLabor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer entered into two primary-residence mortgages in quick succession, including for a second home near a country club in Arizona, where she\u2019s known to vacation,\u201d ProPublica reported.\nHoist by their own petard, it would appear.\n",

        "content": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is eyeing a parking lot next to Miami\u2019s Freedom Tower for a Donald Trump presidential library.\nThe state\u2019s top elected official plans to submit an item to the Florida Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund to convey the 2.6-acre parcel at 500-540 Biscayne Boulevard in downtown Miami for the project, which would be the first presidential library in Florida, a press release states. The board would vote on the item at its Sept. 30 meeting.\n\u201cNo state has better delivered the President\u2019s agenda than the Free State of Florida,\u201d DeSantis said in a statement. \u201cAnd we would be honored to house his presidential library here in his home state.\u201d\nTrump\n, the 45th and 47th president of the United States, maintains his primary residence at his private\nMar-a-Lago\nClub in Palm Beach.\n\nThe improvement trust fund\u2019s trustees are\nDeSantis\n, Attorney General James Uthmeier, Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia and Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson. The board is responsible for the acquisition, management, protection and disposition of state lands.\nThe parking lot is currently utilized by employees of Miami-Dade College\u2019s Wolfson Campus. On Tuesday morning, the college\u2019s board of trustees voted to transfer the property to the state, the\nMiami Herald\nreported. The college also owns Freedom Tower, which recently reopened after a $25 million renovation.\nFreedom Tower\nis arguably the most iconic building in downtown Miami. Built in 1925, the 17-story Spanish Renaissance Revival high-rise was the first home of the defunct Miami News. In the 1960s and 1970s, the building served as the Cuban Refugee Center, assisting hundreds of thousands of Cuban immigrants. In 2005, Freedom Tower was donated to Miami-Dade College, which converted the building into a museum.\nDeSantis has been seeking to patch up a strained relationship with Trump following the 2024 Republican presidential primary when the governor was among several candidates hoping to unseat the billionaire developer as the GOP\u2019s leader. Trump\u2019s campaign ran bruising attacks against DeSantis, who withdrew his presidential candidacy in January of last year after his campaign concluded he had no path to victory, published reports state.\nRecently, DeSantis and his administration sought to boost the Trump administration\u2019s\nimmigration crackdown\nby converting a former air strip in the Everglades into a detention facility they dubbed Alligator Alcatraz. A U.S. appeals court recently blocked a lower court ruling ordering that the facility be closed.",

        "content": "Anthropic is beefing up its downtown San Francisco headquarters.\nThe artificial intelligence giant, hot off raising $13 billion in investments this month, leased several floors of office space at the Foundry Square III building, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. The company is taking about 100,000 square feet, almost a third of the 10-story building.\nThe building at 505 Howard Street spans more than 300,000 square feet and is across the street from Anthropic\u2019s current headquarters at Foundry Square IV. Anthropic subleased more than 230,000 square feet in that building from Slack, which shifted to a remote-first work model after the pandemic. That deal was one of the largest local transactions in years, though it was outdone by competitor\nOpenAI, which leased buildings\nspanning nearly 1 million square feet for its headquarters in Mission Bay.\nTerms of Anthropic\u2019s headquarters lease, including how long the company will be in the space, were not disclosed, though reportedly both the new lease and the sublease expire in 2028.\nThe 505 Howard building\u2019s other tenants include accounting juggernaut KPMG, which\nleased 100,000 square feet\nin the building a year ago after it chose not renew its lease at its longtime headquarters on Second Street. Intuit also moved into 505 Howard recently, exiting an office on Fourth Street that it occupied for a decade. KPMG and Intuit downsized in their moves to 505 Howard.\n\nAs San Francisco battles high post-pandemic office vacancy and slow-but-steady\nreturn to work\n, other companies have similarly signed on to less space than they previously occupied. Office vacancy is at 34.6 percent, down from a peak of 36.9 percent in the third quarter of last year, according to CBRE.\nThe AI sector is expected to revive the city \u2014 and its office market \u2014 with an influx of workers over the next five years. By 2030, more than 50,000 AI workers are predicted to flock to San Francisco, while AI firms\u2019 office space inventory is expected to balloon from 5 million to more than 20 million square feet,\ncutting the city\u2019s vacancy rate in half\n, per CBRE.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The 5,200-square-foot home was built on 0.7 waterfront acres in 1958, and has seven bedrooms, six bathrooms, three half-bathrooms and a pool, records show.\nIt marks the latest pricey sale on Palm Island this year. The island has emerged as a magnet for ultra-luxury buyers seeking waterfront in the competitive Miami Beach market. In March, gaming mogul Richard Skelhorn dropped a record\n$45 million\nfor the waterfront mansion at 40 Palm Avenue, making it the most expensive home ever sold on the island. Skelhorn, the founder of blockchain-based digital casino MetaWin, posted to social media about the purchase, saying, \u201cIt was 1 a.m. in Dubai, had a few beers when I made the offer.\u201d\nLast year, boxing legend\nFloyd Mayweather Jr.\n, who has embarked on a second career as a real estate investor, sold his waterfront Palm Island mansion for\n$22 million\n.\nOn adjacent\nHibiscus Island\n, Wade Davis, the former CEO of Univision, sold his waterfront mansion for\n$31.8 million\nin July.",

The sale at 4000 MacArthur Boulevard is below the outstanding $108.5 million loan on the property, per a trustee deed related to the transaction.\nAgoura Hills-based Beacon Default Management acted as trustee in the transaction for the 376,871-square-foot office portfolio. At the time, it was the largest reposted default on a loan tied to an office property in the\nJohn Wayne Airport area\nin more than five years, according to the Business Journal. Prior to the loan sale, Hyundai Capital America was a tenant at the towers and is reportedly in the process of removing its signage from one of the buildings.\nKoll Center Newport was developed by The Koll Company in 1979. The West Tower spans 177,925 square feet of office space over 10 stories; the East Tower is also 10 stories tall with 198,856 square feet of office space.\n\nThe last reported transaction for the property involved New York-based Goldman Sachs Group buying the two buildings from Houston-based Hines in 2017 for $176.5 million, or $468.44 per square foot. That transaction was a recapitalization of the asset where Hines brought in Goldman Sachs to replace its original partner Oaktree Capital, keeping a 5 percent interest in the property while Goldman Sachs owned the remaining 95 percent, according to CoStar data cited by the Business Journal.\nElsewhere in Newport Beach, earlier this month, locally based real estate company\nCress Capital bought a 215,000-square-foot office building\nat 1301 Dove Street for $41 million, or $191 per square foot. Phoenix-based Western Alliance Bank sold the property after seizing it in foreclosure this year.

        "content": "Industry leaders that could benefit from further development of data centers in the greater Chicago area are honing in on changes to a privacy law they say is causing the region to lose out on projects.\nIllinois\u2019 Biometric Information Privacy Act, a 2008 law requiring consent before companies collect or use biometric data, has become a flashpoint as artificial intelligence drives unprecedented demand for data centers, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The volume of data center construction in North America is set to more than double over the next five years, fueled by AI workloads, according to JLL. But hyperscalers like Amazon, Google and Microsoft are bypassing Illinois, fearing costly class-action suits under BIPA, developers say.\nBIPA has stalled projects in Illinois while billions flow next door, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.\n\u201cNorth of $100 billion\u201d worth of hyperscale campuses \u2014 prime tax generators \u2014 have gone to Indiana, Wisconsin, Iowa and Michigan instead, JLL\u2019s Andy Cvengros said. Amazon alone is building an $11 billion campus near South Bend, Indiana, while Microsoft and Google are planting multi-billion-dollar flags across Wisconsin and Indiana.\nChicago slipped from the No. 2 or 3 data center market in North America pre-2022 to seventh this year. The\nlocal pipeline\nis softening too, with many projects unleased past 2026, even as 80 percent of data center development nationally comes pre-leased.\nDevelopers and labor unions argue that Illinois\u2019 unusual position \u2014 ample power supply and surplus clean energy \u2014 should make it a magnet for\nhyperscale builds\n. Instead,\nneighboring states\nare reaping the tax revenues and construction jobs.\nThe irony isn\u2019t lost on labor. Don Finn of IBEW Local 134 said that instead of the handful of tower cranes up in Chicago, there should be more like 20 or 30 if more projects went Chicago\u2019s way. He said\ndata centers\nare nearly half his members\u2019 workload. The AFL-CIO has also lined up behind efforts to revisit BIPA, framing it as an economic development play.\nBut trial lawyers and privacy advocates are pushing back, casting the industry\u2019s lobbying as a Trojan horse.\n\n\u201cBIPA is the firewall that protects Illinois workers and consumers,\u201d said Timothy Cavanagh of the Illinois Trial Lawyers Association. The ACLU calls claims of lost investment an attempt to gut one of the strongest privacy laws in the country.\nLawmakers tweaked BIPA two years ago to curb runaway damages, but efforts to exempt or clarify its application for AI and data centers are contentious.\n\u201cSome sort of clarification is in the realm of possibility,\u201d said State Sen. Bill Cunningham, who shepherded the last amendment. He said a clarification could be made in the law that wouldn\u2019t give data center developers pause.\n\u201cAn exemption for AI is a much heavier lift,\u201d Cunningham said.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The sale, subject to shareholder approval, is expected to close in the fourth quarter.\n\u201cWe\u2019re entering at 30 percent of what it would cost to replace these assets,\u201d the CEO said in an investor conference call about the deal. \u201cThe valuation on these assets are roughly 40 percent of pre-Covid levels.\u201d\nThe bargain deal involves a portfolio comprising 13.1 million square feet spread across 13 owned and four managed office assets in New York City and San Francisco. Those holdings include 1633 Broadway, 1301 Avenue of the Americas and 60 Wall Street, all in New York City, and One Market Plaza and 300 Mission Street, both in San Francisco.\nIn April Nierenberg\ntold Bloomberg TV\nthe firm\u2019s \u201cM&amp;A calendar, or pipeline, is fairly active.\u201d\nRithm, which Nierenberg has been leading since its inception, has $36 billion in assets under management and roughly $100 billion in investible assets.\nPrior to joining, Nierenberg, 63, who is also president and chairman of the board at Rithm, was a managing director and head of global mortgages and securitized products at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He also held senior leadership roles at J.P. Morgan, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.\nThe executive\u2019s compensation was $21.1 million in 2024, per an SEC filing. He works with his son, Jonathan Nierenberg, a vice president at the firm who goes by Jonny and tied the knot this year. The younger Nierenberg was hired in 2022 as an investment associate, with a base salary of $150,000 and the ability to receive a discretionary bonus, according to a 2023 SEC\nfiling\n.\nRithm, first named New Residential Investment, was founded in 2013, a few years after the financial crisis, as an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group with a focus on mortgage-related assets. Over the years, it began internalizing management, ultimately rebranding as Rithm Capital in 2022. Since then, the firm began\nshedding its association\nwith subprime mortgage leader Fortress in order to raise outside capital and expand its asset management platform.\nThe strategy seemed to work. The following year, Rithm purchased asset manager Sculptor Capital Management for $720 million. And more recently, it signed a deal to buy Crestline, a $17 billion private lender. That deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter.\n\u201cWe started as a REIT, and now we\u2019re going to try to morph into some kind of capital structure that looks like some of the largest money managers in the world,\u201d Nierenberg\ntold\nBloomberg at the time, comparing Rithm\u2019s future self to heavyweights like Ares, Apollo and Starwood.\n\nToday, the New York City-based firm boasts 200 investment professionals and has been looking for a way to enter the commercial office market for a long time.\n\u201cThe past couple of years we did a lot of brand building around the house,\u201d Nierenberg said to Bloomberg Television. \u201cI think now, we are going to start to see the fruit of that labor really come into play for the company.\u201d\nThe Paramount deal comes amid controversy surrounding its CEO Albert Behler, including a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\ninvestigation\ninto undisclosed payments and concerns about executive compensation and conflicts of interest.\nRithm plans to acquire the outstanding shares of Paramount\u2019s common stock for $6.60 per diluted share, slightly below the firm\u2019s stock price prior to the announcement.\n\u201cVery rarely do you have the opportunity to acquire what we deem are A assets at a discount-to-book value at what we deem the beginning of the so-called office market recovery,\u201d Nierenberg said on the investor call.\nParamount began looking into a sale of the company in May after analysts and investors raised concerns about the management of the company and executives\u2019 pay levels relative to its stock performance. Rithm ultimately won the multiple-round bidding process.\nLooking forward, Rithm seeks to \u201ccontinue to diversify our investment strategies,\u201d Nierenberg said on the call.\nAs in work, Nierenberg \u2014 who spent the last 28 years as board chairman for the Samuel Waxman Cancer Research Foundation \u2014 knows how to get a good real estate deal on the home front.\nHe and his wife Elin bought a Greenwich Village penthouse triplex once listed at $50 million for $14 million in 2021, the\nNew York Post reported\n. The sale price was even less than the home\u2019s last asking price of $16.5 million.\nLocated near Rithm\u2019s office, the East 11th Street home features four bedrooms across 7,693 square feet with a 2,300-square-foot roof terrace that includes a solarium.\nThe firm declined to comment to\nTRD\n.\n",

The industrial business park has nearly 70 dock-high doors, nine grade-level doors and a 160-foot truck loading area.

The previous owner was an affiliate of Essex Property Trust, according to the Business Times; the firm could not be reached for comment by the publication.\nThe transaction for the 171-unit five-story property at 2020 Fourth Street totaled roughly $305,847 per unit. In addition to the residences, the building contains 15,000 square feet of retail across eight suites.\nSack Capital plans to make interior and exterior renovations to the property and add on-site property management and leasing, according to the Business Times. The company looks to \u201caddress the affordability gap between renting and owning\u201d in Berkeley, Jeff Smith, managing partner with Sack Capital, said.\nThe Berkeley property was originally built as condominiums in 2010, and offers mostly one-bedroom units with some two-bedrooms. It sits south of Berkeley\u2019s Fourth street retail corridor.\n\nSack\u2019s purchase of the 171-unit five-story property at 2020 4th Street marks the company\u2019s third acquisition in the past few weeks. Earlier this month, Sack\nacquired the 164-unit Fountain Park apartments\nin San Jose for $52 million. After that, Sack arranged structured financing on behalf of Step Up Housing to buy the 148-unit Bayside Apartment Homes in Pinole for $36.9 million; Sack will provide asset and property management there.\nThe multifamily market in Berkeley has seen several apartment buildings come under new ownership in recent years as a glut of units increased supply and drove down rents.\nIn February, Read Investments bought the 98-unit eight-story Higby apartment building for $32 million after the property was seized by its lender via a deed in lieu of foreclosure last year. A month later, Artemis Real Estate Partners bought the 143-unit Berkeley Central apartments for $55 million, or about 40 percent below the property\u2019s assessed value.\nEarlier this summer, the\nUniversity Park apartments\nat 1709 Shattuck Avenue and 1710 Walnut Street headed to foreclosure auction after owner\nAcademy West Investments\ndefaulted on payments on a loan tied to the complex.

        "content": "The Seminole Tribe of Florida is suing Lennar for allegedly building 465 defective homes on tribal land across Florida.\nIn an amended Aug. 29 lawsuit in Broward County Circuit Court, the Seminole Tribe alleges\nLennar\n, a Miami-based national homebuilder led by Executive Chairman and co-CEO Stuart Miller and co-CEO and President Jon Jaffe, built shoddy houses that have damaged hundreds of tribal members. As a result, the\nSeminole Tribe\nis on the hook for reimbursing damages and out-of-pocket relocation expenses amounting to \u201ctens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars,\u201d the complaint states.\nThe Seminole Tribe alleges that houses Lennar developed on Seminole reservations in the state have significant construction issues, including faulty roofing and ventilation systems, leading to potentially hazardous mold growth.\n\u201cIt is just a huge disappointment for people in the tribe that relied on Lennar,\u201d said Wiliam Scherer, the Seminole Tribe\u2019s attorney. \u201cWe were working in good faith, and [Lennar] led us down a garden path. They promised they would fix the homes. The longer it went, our engineers examining the homes kept finding more problems.\u201d\nThe defects are so serious that the Seminole Tribe has to move families out of the 462 homes into temporary housing, Scherer said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a few years,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a major undertaking.\u201d\n\nA Lennar spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe Seminole Tribe and Lennar entered into a community development agreement in 2019. The two sides attempted mediation in March, but were not successful, the complaint states. The same month, the Seminole Tribe had filed its initial lawsuit, and the case was briefly stayed on April 29, as Lennar attempted remediation efforts on the homes that were unsuccessful, court filings show.\nThis month, Lennar filed two separate motions to compel arbitration and again stay the lawsuit, according to court records.\nBased in Hollywood, the Seminole Tribe owns the\nSeminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Hollywood\n, which includes a guitar-shaped hotel with 638 rooms.\nLennar, a publicly traded firm, is among the largest homebuilders in the U.S. Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway bought more than 7 million shares in Lennar for nearly\n$800 million\nin the first half of this year.\nLennar is heavily invested in south Miami-Dade County where the firm has several developments on tap. The company recently submitted plans for\nRetro West\n, a 106-townhome development near Homestead. The 10-acre project would include 11 townhomes set aside for workforce housing.",

        "content": "DEK:\nA Seattle-based real estate development firm bought an Embassy Suites in the northern Chicago suburbs for less than its value over a decade ago.\nBCI Pacific Real Estate bought the Embassy Suites Deerfield last month for $12.5 million, or $52,700 per key, from Los Angeles-based Broadshore Capital Partners. Broadshore is a former investment management subsidiary of Los Angeles-based real estate development firm Lowe Enterprises. Lowe sold off its interest in Broadshore in 2018.\nLowe bought the 237-room hotel out of distress in 2011 for $15 million, prior to selling off its investment management subsidiary to Broadshore. The hotel underwent a \u201cmultimillion dollar renovation\u201d that was completed in 2019, according to Hotel News Resource.\nThe owners took out multiple lines of credit on the 1445 Lake Cook Road property but it\u2019s unclear exactly how much Lowe or Broadshore spent on the renovations.\nBroadshore declined to comment, and BCI did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe property fell into tough financial shape after the Great Recession. Prior owner FelCor Lodging Trust relinquished the property to its lender in 2010. Around that time it was appraised at $11 million, falling short of FelCor\u2019s $14 million mortgage on the property.\n\nIts most recent property tax appraisal came in at $16 million.\nDepending on the structure of the BCI\u2019s recent deal, it\u2019s possible Broadshore recouped some costs via closing cost credits or other incentives.\nThe sale reflects Chicago\u2019s generally uneven recovery from the pandemic. The multifamily and industrial sectors have fared well since the pandemic but others, like retail and hospitality, have had less stable recoveries. Meanwhile, the office market, except among Class A buildings, is languishing amid record high vacancy rates.\nWhile tourism and business travel has improved, some hotel properties are still struggling.\nIn Western suburban Lombard, a venture of Chelsea Hospitality Partners and Seaview Investors is facing\na $25 million foreclosure of an Embassy Suites property\nat 707 East Butterfield Road.\nA $25.3 million loan backed by the 262-room hotel at 707 East Butterfield Road in Lombard is in default after the borrower failed to pay it off ahead of a May 22 maturity, according to Morningstar Credit. Phoenix-based Western Alliance Bank originated the loan in 2019 and it was later sold off to commercial mortgage-backed securities investors, making details of its performance public.\nA July loan report stated that the \u201cborrower has no plans to refinance,\u201d and added that the lender\u2019s counsel is preparing to send the landlord a default notice as well as a pre-negotiation agreement. The agreement could provide an opportunity for a workout plan for the debt if they end up interested in keeping the asset.",

        "content": "Elon Musk\u2019s Texas land grab is bigger than anyone realized.\nHis companies own more than 500 properties covering 6,000 acres across the state, from Cybertruck assembly lines outside of Austin to rocket launch pads at the Mexican border, an analysis by the Houston Chronicle\nfound\n.\nProperty records from all 254 Texas counties tracked holdings tied to Tesla, SpaceX, the Boring Company and 11 other Musk entities, which often hide behind banal names like \u201cColorado River Project\u201d or \u201cDogleg Park.\u201d\nThe crown jewel is Giga Texas, Tesla\u2019s 2,500-acre Austin factory complex that has ballooned to more than 10 million square feet of production space and could double if filings for another wave of buildings move forward. The plant cranks out Model Ys and the Cybertruck, which are shuttled through a Boring Co. tunnel beneath Texas 130 to staging areas. The main facility is nearly three quarters of a mile long.\nAbout 20 miles east, in Bastrop, Musk\u2019s tunneling startup has carved out more than 350 acres for testing\ngiant boring machines\nand housing staff in a makeshift village called Snailbrook. Across the road, SpaceX runs a 700,000-square-foot Starlink factory that turns out 70,000 satellite kits a week, with plans to double in size. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott sweetened the deal earlier this year with a $17.3 million grant tied to a $280 million SpaceX expansion.\nFarther south, SpaceX has converted scrubland near\nBrownsville\ninto \u201cStarbase,\u201d\na de facto company town\nof nearly 500 residents and thousands of workers. The site hosts Starship, the tallest rocket ever built, along with more than 1 million square feet of manufacturing. The company is\npushing to expand\nits launchpad and add housing, retail and a grocery store.\n\nTesla\u2019s reach extends beyond Austin and Brownsville. Near Corpus Christi, the automaker is bringing a lithium refinery online in Robstown, meant to supply battery-grade material for 1 million EVs a year. Outside Dallas, Tesla Energy is building a 125-megawatt battery storage plant in Royse City, one of the largest in ERCOT\u2019s pipeline.\nBesides these properties, Musk\u2019s companies have leased facilities around the state. Southwest of Waco in McGregor, SpaceX leased land to test rockets. Plans are in place for Tesla to lease a 1.03 million-square-foot building in Brookshire, west of Houston, for a battery manufacturing plant.\nMusk has made no secret of why he\u2019s gone \u201call in\u201d on Texas: lighter regulation, lower taxes and control.\n\u201cElon Musk has more control in Texas than he does anywhere else,\u201d said Goran Calic, a McMaster University professor who studies Musk\u2019s management style.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The sellers were former Bank of America COO\nThomas Montag and his wife\n, philanthropist and former banker\nJanet Montag\n, who purchased the townhouse in 2008 for $32.5 million. The latest transaction represents a 19 percent discount from its prior trade price. The renovated property was built in 1904 by Stanford White and measures 10,000 square feet. It has six bedrooms, five bathrooms, a basketball court, an elevator and a garden.\nPatricia Farman-Farmaian\nand\nLaurie Stolowitz\nwith Compass represented the sellers, who first put the home on the market in April 2024 for $36 million. The new owner is an LLC, which took out a $17.1 million mortgage with\nJPMorgan Chase Bank\nfor the purchase.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe estate of\nCarol Bernstein\nand an LLC managed by\nStanley Levin\nshed a three-story, mental health facility at\n38-11 Broadway\nin Astoria for about $9.8 million, marking the top commercial deal recorded in the city. The buyer was an LLC tied to\nJack Cohen\u2019s Comjem Associates.\nThe nearly 32,000-square-foot building appears to have been tied to the Bernstein and Levin families for decades.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nTwo neighboring apartment complexes, at\n499 and 503 Evergreen Avenue\nin Bushwick, traded for $8.3 million. The buyer was an affiliate of Great Neck, New York-based\nParkview Properties\n. The seller was developer\nUrban View Development Group\n.

The unit, located in the Mayfair Towers in the Upper West Side, has six bedrooms and five bathrooms, according to an old listing.

        "content": "A long-delayed plan to legalize casitas and granny flats across Chicago is moving forward, but only after aldermen scaled it back with restrictions designed to protect single-family neighborhoods.\nAldermen Bennett Lawson and Marty Quinn ended a year-long stalemate over the\ncitywide expansion\nof accessory dwelling units, or ADUs. Their compromise kept Quinn\u2019s union-backed amendment requiring contractors to hire through certified apprentice programs for new construction, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The Chicago Federation of Labor and building trades had pressed hard for the measure, warning they would sink the ordinance otherwise.\nThe compromise, however, also gave aldermen near-total control over ADUs in single-family zones. Detached units will be banned in low-density districts unless a local alderman opts in. Even then, construction will be capped at one to three ADUs per block, depending on zoning. Detached houses that add an ADU must be owner-occupied. For multi-unit districts, ADUs will be allowed by right.\nThe legislation also scrapped a 700-square-foot size cap on coach houses but maintains a 22-foot height limit and other spacing rules. A Chicago City Council vote is expected Thursday.\nLawson had pushed for a broader legalization effort, framing ADUs as a way to chip away at Chicago\u2019s estimated 120,000-unit affordable housing shortage by creating unsubsidized, naturally occurring affordable units.\n\n\u201cIf you could build a two-flat, you can build an ADU,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cThis is a citywide ordinance. It\u2019s a big expansion.\u201d\nBut Quinn and allies leveraged organized labor\u2019s support to force concessions, arguing aldermen must retain veto power over zoning changes in their wards. The compromise underscores the Council\u2019s long-standing practice of\n\u201caldermanic prerogative.\u201d\nProgressives, including Mayor Brandon Johnson, had championed ADUs as a modest but citywide affordability fix. Johnson struck a diplomatic tone, saying he was \u201cgrateful\u201d the measure advanced despite aldermanic resistance.\nThe compromise leaves Chicago with a narrower ADU policy than housing advocates hoped for, but it marks the first meaningful\nexpansion\nsince the city launched a\nlimited pilot program\nin 2021.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "After a\nlong and controversial road\n, the Department for the Aging is officially relocating to 14 Wall Street in Lower Manhattan.\nThe Department of Citywide Administrative Services signed a 20-year lease for 81,000 square feet at Alexander Rovt\u2019s property, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The deal at the property owned by Rovt, an investor who has donated to Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 campaigns and legal fund, is worth $77 million.\nIn the first five years of the lease, the city will pay Rovt $33 per square foot. Every five years, the price per square foot will escalate, capped at $44 per square foot. It\u2019s unclear when the Department for the Aging will relocate from 2 Lafayette Street.\n\u201cI evaluated the deal, and it was clear that 14 Wall St. was the best economic deal for the city,\u201d DCAS Commissioner Louis Molina said.\nThe process for securing the lease has been ripe with criticism, particularly accusations that city officials steered the move towards an Adams donor. Former DCAS deputy commissioner Jesse Hamilton, who\nresigned\nlast month, has been at the center of the controversy involving city office leases. He\u2019s been indicted on corruption charges, though 14 Wall Street was not part of the indictment.\n\nHamilton reportedly stepped into the lease procurement process to push the deal towards Rovt, even though AmTrust Realty\u2019s 250 Broadway was the top pick for the lease, based on an internal scoring system.\nAn internal review by DCAS \u2014 which did not look at Hamilton\u2019s actions \u2014 determined that the agency followed proper procedures when it came to evaluating the lease possibilities. Additionally, DCAS claimed the 250 Broadway lease would\u2019ve cost a total of an additional $16 million for taxpayers and said Department of the Aging officials preferred 14 Wall.\nRovt donated $9,200 to Adams\u2019 mayoral and Brooklyn borough president campaigns and a further $5,000 for his legal defense fund. His wife and son have also made donations to the mayor.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Compass\u2019 plan to acquire Anywhere Real Estate for $1.6 billion would further consolidate the brokerages\u2019 dominance in South Florida, where brands carry significant weight.\nCompass, already a Goliath in residential real estate, will have more than 340,000 agents under its banner, representing about 20 percent of all Realtors in the country, if the\nacquisition\nis completed in the second half of next year. Still, Compass won\u2019t control the majority of the market nationwide.\nYet, an analysis by\nThe Real Deal\nshows the deal would cement the new Compass-owned company\u2019s position as the top brokerage in Miami-Dade County. Combined, Compass and Anywhere\u2019s brands closed $9.5 billion in on-market sales in Miami-Dade County in the 12 months ended in August,\nTRD\nresearch shows.\nCompass, led by CEO Robert Reffkin, will control five of the top 10 performing brokerages in Miami-Dade. In addition to its own brand and Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, which it bought last year in a\n$444 million\npurchase of @properties, the brokerage will own the legacy brands that include Coldwell Banker, the Corcoran Group, Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, Century 21, Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate and ERA.\nThough the Anywhere brands will stay intact, Compass will absorb its fiercest competition in Miami-Dade: Coldwell Banker. With that comes the\nJills Zeder Group\n, led by Jill Eber, Jill Hertzberg and Judy Zeder, which consistently ranks as the top agent team in the U.S. Last year, the Jills Zeder Group ranked first with $923 million in on-market sales, according to\nTRD research\n.\nAmong other top agents that will come under the new company\u2019s umbrella are Corcoran\u2019s Julian Johnston, Mick Duchon and Eloy Carmenate.\nCompass and Anywhere agents represent about half of the top 25 agents in Miami-Dade, as determined by on-market sales volume in the 12 months ended in August. The agents\u2019 combined dollar volume totaled $3.4 billion in on-market sales, according to\nTRD\nresearch.\nTime will tell how the acquisition will affect recruiting, but it could drive away agents who are looking for a more personalized firm, some brokers say.\n\n\u201cYou now have homogenized a bunch of brands under one brand,\u201d said Mercedes Saewitz, senior vice president of operations at Aperture Global Real Estate, a Florida-based national brokerage firm. \u201cYou are sort of losing the identity of it.\u201d\nIt\u2019s still early, Saewitz said.\n\u201cPeople are digesting it, [but] there\u2019s no rush of the gates. They\u2019re not slated to close on this until Q2 2026,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m interested in seeing what the movement is from those brands into Compass.\u201d\nThe deal will mark the latest chapter in the industry\u2019s history of increased consolidation, as profit margins continue to shrink.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a high volume, low profit business,\u201d said Mike Pappas, CEO of the Keyes Company, the largest independent brokerage firm in Florida. \u201cUnless they\u2019re going to transform the commission structure in their business, we don\u2019t see how it\u2019s going to be anything different than it\u2019s historically been.\u201d\nCompetitors\n, including smaller brokerages and local heavyweights, have already claimed the news as a win. Pappas sees opportunities to pick up people and office space post-merger, as the new Compass entity looks to cut $250 million in efficiencies.\nSaewitz, who left Compass at the end of last year, said she always expected the brokerage would make a major acquisition, but not this big. \u201cThey just proved to the world that consolidation is the new normal for our industry,\u201d she said.\nSheridan Wall contributed reporting.\n",

        "content": "The owners of an apartment community in Los Feliz are the latest to score a refinancing loan from Mesa West Capital.\nAlliance Residential and PCCP secured a five-year, floating-rate $43.5 million loan from Los Angeles-based Mesa West to refinance the Broadstone Los Feliz residential complex, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\nMesa West\nwas interested in Los Feliz\u2019s \u201ccombination of a strong cultural scene, limited supply and the unique character of the neighborhood,\u201d Josh Westerberg, Mesa West Capital head of the Western U.S. region, said of the deal, according to the Times. At the same time, the popular Los Angeles neighborhood \u201ccontinues to experience low vacancy and attractive rent growth,\u201d Westerberg added.\nBroadstone Los Feliz has a mix of studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments with access to a rooftop lounge, barbecue area, indoor swimming pool and spa, fitness center and electric vehicle charging stations. The property, at 1800 North New Hampshire Avenue, includes a total of 134 units. The outdoor lounge area offers unobstructed views of the Griffith Observatory and the Hollywood Sign, according to the Times.\nThe joint venture between Alliance and PCCP acquired the property in 2022 and has invested more than $1 million since then to revamp the common areas and upgrade the interiors of 33 units with hardwood flooring, quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances and new woodgrain cabinets. In total, two-thirds of the units have been renovated; the remaining ones will be renovated within the next two years, according to the Times. At the time of loan closing, the property was 95 percent occupied.\n\nMesa West has swooped in with eight-figure loans to various residential and commercial ventures in Southern California in recent months.\nEarlier this month, Mesa West\nprovided a $68.5 million acquisition loan\nto Legacy Partners for an apartment community in Azusa. Legacy Partners bought the vacant apartments at 801 East Alosta Avenue from Azusa Pacific University for a total of $91.8 million.\nIn July, Mesa West\nlent $55 million to an affiliate of Seaview Investors\nfor the Burton House Beverly Hills hotel. The five-year, first-mortgage deal will continue to fuel operations under the new Tribute brand at the 186-room lodging property, Westerberg said at the time.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",
