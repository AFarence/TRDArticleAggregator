        "content": "The City Council on Wednesday advanced the Long Island City rezoning, which is expected to create 14,700 new homes over the next decade.\nThe City Council Committee on Land Use and the Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises voted in favor of the rezoning after the Adams administration promised to invest $1.5 billion in the neighborhood. The project is expected to net 4,300 affordable apartments and 3.5 million square feet of new commercial space.\nThe Long Island City proposal now heads back to City Planning for review before going to the full Council for a final vote.\nThe Council made a number of changes to the proposal before approving it, including requiring deeper affordability and limiting building heights in some areas. Developers building in the Queens Plaza West area must set aside 20 percent of a project\u2019s units for households making an average of 40 percent of the area median income, with income bands capped at 130 percent AMI. That\u2019s the \u201cdeep affordability\u201d option under the city\u2019s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program. As part of the\nCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity\n, that option was made available to the City Council as something it could mandate, rather than offer up alongside other affordability levels.\nFor months, City Council member Julie Won has withheld full-throated support of the rezoning, making clear that her buy-in hinged on City Hall making several commitments.\nThose commitments included \u201cmaximizing affordable housing on public and private sites,\u201d and creating a contiguous waterfront park by connecting Gantry Park to Queensbridge Park. She also wanted investments in sewer and stormwater management infrastructure, as well as new schools and open space beneath the Queensboro Bridge.\nThe city\u2019s financial commitment will help \u201cfund a connected waterfront,\u201d turn five acres under the bridge into green space, sewer upgrades, add more than 1,300 seats at new schools, as well as repairs to public housing at Queensbridge Houses.\nAs Mayor Eric Adams nears his exit from City Hall, his administration is\npoised\nto ultimately approve five neighborhood rezonings.\nThe City Council is expected to sign off on the Jamaica rezoning during its meeting on Wednesday, paving the way for nearly 12,000 apartments in the Queens neighborhood.\n\nThe approvals also come as City Council leadership ramps up its campaign against three ballot measures that threaten to weaken the body\u2019s influence over certain housing and land use actions. The Council has framed the questions as a power grab by City Hall that deprives members\u2019 leverage to increase affordability requirements and squeeze capital commitments from the city.\nIf Won opposed the rezoning, Council Speaker Adrienne Adams would have had an interesting choice. Adams has insisted that the Council does not always abide by member deference, the longstanding tradition of voting according to the local Council member\u2019s wishes on land use actions. Following member deference on Long Island City would provide fuel for proponents of the ballot measures.\nAt the same time, Won\u2019s demands for affordability and city investments are precisely the reasons the Council says it is trying to hold onto its power in the city\u2019s land use review process.\nDuring the subcommittee meeting, Won said the ballot measures would \u201cmake it impossible\u201d to negotiate at this level. Only one of the controversial ballot questions would apply to a rezoning of Long Island City\u2019s size. That measure would create a three-person appeals board that could override City Council decisions. The board doesn\u2019t preclude the Council from pushing for investments, but the board could arguably decrease the Council\u2019s leverage in negotiations over investments.\nWon has had\nclose calls\nbefore. In October 2022, the fate of Innovation QNS appeared precarious when Won\nemailed\nher colleagues and urged them to vote against the project. That may have signaled that the Council was prepared to override member deference. The Council ultimately\napproved\nthe project with deeper affordability, but the\ndevelopment team\nhas since broken up.\nWhile much of Long Island City has been rezoned over the last 30 years, the latest plan focuses on a 54-block area that has been left out of previous initiatives and is zoned for low- and medium- density manufacturing. The changes allow for more residential, as well as retail and light-industrial construction in the area.\nThe rezoning includes city-owned sites at\n44-36 Vernon Boulevard\n, 44-59 45th Avenue and 4-99 44th Drive, which will be transferred to developers.\nThe area has long been the subject of various development plans. The sites were once part of a megadevelopment envisioned by MAG Partners, Plaxall, Simon Baron Development and TF Cornerstone. That project, dubbed YourLIC, spanned 28 acres along the Anable Basin and would have resulted in more than a dozen buildings, with a mix of commercial, residential and community space. It also included the sites where Amazon once proposed building its new headquarters, before\nabandoning\nthat plan in 2019.\nThe city is also working to take over a site from Con Edison in an effort to create a contiguous waterfront between Gantry Plaza State Park and Queensbridge Park. This week, Won\naccused\nCon Edison of delaying the transfer, but thanked the company on Wednesday for working with the city.\n",

        "content": "A&amp;E Real Estate, one of New York City\u2019s largest private landlords, is facing foreclosure at 1080 Amsterdam Avenue, near Columbia University, after allegedly defaulting on a $29 million loan.\nApex Bank filed suit in Manhattan Supreme Court this week, accusing A&amp;E of missing three months of payments on the mortgage and violating other loan terms, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Apex is seeking to seize and sell the 20-story, 96-unit tower to recover the $28.3 million still owed, plus interest and fees.\nA&amp;E could also be liable for any shortfall if the property\u2019s sale doesn\u2019t cover the debt. The landlord, led by co-founder and CEO Douglas Eisenberg, has not yet responded in court but said it is working with the lender to reach a resolution that won\u2019t affect tenants.\nThe prewar building on West 113th Street, once staff housing for St. Luke\u2019s Hospital, includes a mix of market-rate and rent-stabilized apartments, an increasingly thorny combination since the 2019 rent law overhaul limited rent hikes and removed deregulation pathways.\nThat law has been blamed for squeezing returns and eroding valuations across the stabilized rental sector, where A&amp;E holds a large footprint.\n\nThe property last traded in 2022, when A&amp;E bought it from SL Green Realty for $42.7 million, financing the deal with the Signature Bank loan now in dispute. Following Signature\u2019s 2023 collapse, the note was transferred to an FDIC-linked entity and then to Apex last summer.\nStonehenge manages the building, where available units range from $4,500 to $8,400 a month.\nThe suit marks the latest sign of distress for the firm, which controls roughly 20,000 apartments citywide.\nEarlier this month, another lender sued over an alleged $165 million default tied to a dozen Queens apartment buildings. The company is also fighting a potential foreclosure at Harlem\u2019s 3,500-unit Riverton Square\nover a $506 million debt\n.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Facing foreclosure on its development site in Boca Raton, Penn-Florida Companies sold the 1-acre lot previously planned for an assisted living facility for $27 million.\nLed by Mark Gensheimer, Penn-Florida sold the vacant property at 375 East Royal Palm Road to Boca Raton-based SobelCo, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. SobelCo, a real estate development, investment, management and leasing firm led by Jeffrey Sobel, also purchased the adjacent 0.2-acre vacant site at 343 East Royal Palm Road for $3.1 million from an entity managed by McFillin of Delray Beach.\nIn total, SobelCo paid $30.1 million for 1.2 acres of developable land. It scored a $10 million loan from Goldman Sachs for the purchase, Vizzda records show.\nThe smaller lot at 343 East Royal Palm Road is approved for a four-unit luxury residential building with five stories and a rooftop, according to a marketing brochure.\nBoca Raton-based Penn-Florida had a long-pending plan for an upscale 193-unit assisted living facility on the site at 375 East Royal Palm Road. The Boca Raton Planning and Zoning Board\napproved\nthe project in 2017, and Penn-Florida subsequently demolished the two-story building that was on the site, records show. Construction of the assisted living facility never started.\nPenn-Florida had paid $1.2 million for the property and adjacent sites in 2005, according to records. In 2016, the firm borrowed $2.5 million on the land from City National Bank of Florida, bumping it to $5.7 million in three loan modification agreements in 2019, 2020 and 2023, according to records.\n\nLast year, City National Bank of Florida reassigned the loan to an affiliate of Miami Beach-based distressed debt investor Safe Harbor Equity, led by Rafael Serrano. Safe Harbor filed a foreclosure on the $5.7 million loan against Penn-Florida and Gensheimer, the loan\u2019s guarantor, alleging Penn-Florida defaulted on the 2024 maturity and the full loan balance is due.\nThe recent site sale resolved the pending foreclosure, according to court records. On Monday, a court filing by Palm Beach County Circuit Court Judge Carolyn Bell shows that Safe Harbor, Penn-Florida and Gensheimer submitted a letter notifying the court the case has been settled. Bell ordered the parties to file the proper dismissal papers, a procedural step.\nSobelCo andPenn-Florida didn\u2019t immediately return requests for comment.\nPenn-Florida\nhas been facing financial woes on several of its South Florida properties and projects. Its troubles come amid\nelevated interest rates\n, skyrocketing insurance and higher construction and labor costs. Many developers are stepping back from planned projects and\nlisting\ntheir sites for sale amid struggles to pay debt obligations on floating rate loans, or they are unable to refinance. Banks have generally\nretrenched\nfrom providing new loans.\nIn\nBoca Raton\n, Blackstone Mortgage Trust filed a\n$145 million\nUniform Commercial Code foreclosure against a Penn-Florida affiliate on its 366-unit 101 Via Mizner apartment building at 101 East Camino Real last year. Penn-Florida\u2019s affiliate filed for bankruptcy in January,\nwarding off\nthe scheduled foreclosure auction. In July, federal bankruptcy court Judge Erik Kimball approved a\n$235 million\nsale of the property to a joint venture between Penn-Florida and crowdfunding multifamily syndicator Grant Cardone.\n",

        "content": "Siri co-creator Dag Kittlaus took a loss on the sale of his downtown Chicago penthouse after 14 months searching for a buyer.\nThe 81st floor penthouse at the iconic\nAqua Tower\nsold Tuesday for nearly $3.2 million. The Jeanne Gang-designed tower features wavy concrete balconies that give the appearance of rippling water across the tower\u2019s surface.\nKittlaus was a co-founder of Siri, which Apple bought in 2010, as well as AI assistant company VIv Labs, which Samsung bought in 2016. He was the vice president of Samsung Mobile from 2016 to 2019, and is currently the CEO of Riva Health, a digital platform for cardiovascular health care that he co-founded.\nKittlaus bought the condo, with a balcony that features a wide open view of Lake Michigan, in 2018 for $3.8 million.\nIt went on the market\nin June 2024 for $5.3 million. The unit underwent several price cuts, dropping to $4.9 million, then $4.4 million, before settling at $3.25 million in September.\nThe 3,000 square-foot penthouse has four bedrooms and four bathrooms. The price worked out to $1,058 per-square-foot, which is comparable to recent similarly priced sales in newer buildings like the St. Regis Tower.\nAt least 14 other units in the condo have sold this year, according to public listing services, at prices ranging from $300,000 to $1.3 million. A two-story penthouse on the 80th and 81st floors has been for\nsale sporadically since 2015\n, with prices ranging from $4.3 million to $5 million. It has not been on the market since October 2023 but there is no record of it selling.\n@properties\u2019 Carrie McCormick, the unit\u2019s listing agent, said its pricing in the downtown market made it an attractive opportunity, along with the rare highrise view of the lake.\n\nDowntown Chicago\u2019s condo market has been struggling to come back since values plunged in the last few years as wealthy buyers went to the suburbs and fears about crime kept buyers out of the market.\nMichelle Welch, a Compass broker who represented the buyer, said the price was a big selling point for her client, who she declined to identify. The client was specifically looking for a unit with a great view, she said.\nProperty records show Kittlaus bought a condo at the St. Regis Tower at 363 East Wacker Drive in December 2024 for $3.8 million. He sold it to Michigan-based MJCRE LLC for $3.7 million in early October.\nThe sale reflects the new reality of the luxury downtown market in Chicago: Units will sell if they\u2019re priced to match the market, but if sellers are hoping for prices from 2021 or 2022, they\u2019ll have a hard time finding buyers. Welch said the penthouse at $5 million was out of her buyer\u2019s price range, but the lower price made it feasible to find a deal.\nMcCormick said buyers are\nstarting to show interest in downtown\nand finding value in the discount prices for luxury condos.\n\u201cBuyers are coming back to our market because the value is there,\u201d McCormick said. \u201cPeople recognize that. They\u2019re concentrating on key locations.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Forge Development\nis rethinking its plans for the former Pacific Steel Casting Company foundry in Berkeley.\nThe San Diego-based developer filed a new preliminary application with the city to partially renovate and reoccupy a portion of the the 10-acre property in West Berkeley, two years after proposing a life sciences campus on the site, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nThe new plan calls for demolishing some buildings and upgrading others totaling about 56,000 square feet. Part of that includes removing some decommissioned equipment and making structural improvements and repairs.\nThe company hasn\u2019t said whether it still plans life sciences use or is pivoting to manufacturing or light industrial tenants. The site plan suggests renovations won\u2019t immediately make the property ready for tenants to move in, as a separate tenant improvement application would come down the road.\nForge\u2019s initial plan, filed with the city in 2023, called for a 900,000-square-foot life sciences campus on the West Berkeley site. A formal application never materialized, though, likely due to\nincreasing vacancies in the life sciences market\n. San Diego-based life sciences developer IQHQ, for example,\npumped the brakes\non its planned $1.3 billion, 857,000-square-foot life sciences campus in South San Francisco.\nThe Pacific Steel foundry closed in 2018, and in 2021, the city of Berkeley began working to rezone the site to allow other uses like light manufacturing, research and development, industrial, offices and labs.\nForge\nbought the 10-acre site\n, which includes the Pacific Steel location and some neighboring parcels, for $49 million in 2023. The addresses include 1320 Second Street, 1314 Second Street and 1305 Eastshore Highway.\n\nForge isn\u2019t giving up on developing there just yet.\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t pulled away from investing in that property,\u201d Elizabeth Redman Cleveland of Berkeley\u2019s Office of Economic Development told the outlet.\nBerkeley\u2019s R&amp;D inventory has more than doubled since 2020, but venture capital and tenant demand have cooled. The city\u2019s lab vacancy hit 31.4 percent in the third quarter, leaving several new or entitled projects sitting idle, per CBRE.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\nKEY POINTS:\nForge Development is changing its plans for the former Pacific Steel Casting Company foundry in Berkeley, moving away from an initial proposal for a 900,000-square-foot life sciences campus.\nThe new preliminary application involves partially renovating and reoccupying a 56,000-square-foot portion of the 10-acre property, with demolitions and upgrades.\nThis shift comes amidst increasing vacancies in the life sciences market and a cooling of venture capital and tenant demand in Berkeley's R&amp;D inventory.\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s\nMagnificent Mile\nis regaining some of its old shine.\nAfter years of shuttered storefronts, shrinking crowds and pandemic-era malaise, shoppers and retailers are once again filling the city\u2019s most famous retail strip \u2014 a tentative sign of life for downtown\u2019s battered retail sector.\nVisits to the stretch of North Michigan Avenue are nearly back to pre-2020 levels, crime is trending lower, and a spate of new leases is reversing a multiyear slide in occupancy, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n.\nThe vacancy rate on the Mile has dipped to about 25 percent, down from 26 percent last year, according to Stone Real Estate. It\u2019s a modest improvement, but a notable one for a corridor still recovering from its worst downturn in decades.\nThe comeback has been fueled by lower rents and the return of marquee brands.\nCanada\u2019s Aritzia opened a 46,000-square-foot flagship late last year, filling a long-vacant box, while\nUniqlo\n\u2014 which abruptly exited in 2021 \u2014 will soon return with a 29,600-square-foot store. Experiential retail has also joined the mix: the\nHarry Potter Shop\ndebuted in April, and a magic-themed venue called The Hand &amp; The Eye is slated to open next spring.\n\u201cThe Avenue is still in recovery mode,\u201d Stone\u2019s John Vance told the outlet. \u201cBut it looks better.\u201d\n\nVance estimates average asking rents along Michigan Avenue are down roughly 24 percent from 2019, helping lure brands back to the strip.\nThe retail turnaround hasn\u2019t erased all the scars. Empty storefronts still punctuate the six-lane boulevard, and smash-and-grab thefts have kept crime top of mind, even as reported incidents in the 18th Police District have fallen 4 percent year-over-year. The Magnificent Mile Association now funds private security patrols to supplement city police presence.\nMeanwhile, the area\u2019s two urban malls \u2014\nWater Tower Place\nand the Shops at North Bridge \u2014 are question marks after both properties were surrendered to lenders. Pacific Life, which now owns North Bridge, plans renovations next year in a bid to reposition the property.\nCompared with peers like Manhattan\u2019s Fifth Avenue and Beverly Hills\u2019 Rodeo Drive, where vacancies are already below pre-pandemic levels, Chicago\u2019s recovery is still lagging. But brokers say momentum is shifting.\n\u201cThe rents had gotten so high, so frothy,\u201d said Newmark\u2019s Keely Polczynski. \u201cNow, supply and demand are finally starting to meet again.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Joseph Chetrit, one of New York\u2019s biggest dealmakers, was indicted Wednesday on felony charges of tenant harassment.\nHe joins his brother Meyer Chetrit, who was\nindicted last month\n, as a codefendant in the case. The district attorney has accused the Chetrits of harassing two septuagenarian tenants in a Chelsea loft building. He pleaded not guilty.\nJoseph is now one of the biggest names in the New York real estate industry to face criminal charges. The indictment underscores the\nManhattan district attorney\u2019s focus on prosecuting housing and real estate-related crimes\n.\nThe Chetrits allegedly left the two senior tenants at 111-117 West 26th Street without heat and without an elevator at different points during their tenancy, in the hopes of getting them to vacate the apartment. The tenants are in a rent-stabilized unit overseen by the city\u2019s Loft Board, which grants them special legal protections from harassment and rent increases.\nBoth Chetrits have been charged with two counts of harassment of a rent-regulated tenant, a felony that carries a maximum sentence of four years in prison.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even think you can find caselaw on these charges. It\u2019s an overextension of a law that\u2019s on the books,\u201d said Steven Metcalf, an attorney for Joseph. \u201cIt\u2019s targeted to Joe because of who he is.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m confident and I know that Joe is going to zealously defend against these charges,\u201d Metcalf added.\nMeyer Chetrit has been charged with two counts of harassment of a rent-regulated tenant, a felony that carries a maximum sentence of four years in prison.\n\nJeffrey Chartier, a defense attorney for Meyer, in September cast doubt on the facts of the case and said his client denies the allegations.\n\u201cRather than prosecute violent criminals that are plaguing the city, Bragg has again chosen to misapply the law in pursuit of a progressive political agenda,\u201d he said.\nAlvin Bragg, the Manhattan District Attorney,\ntold The Real Deal\nearlier this month that he hoped the real estate industry would be supportive of his efforts to target housing-related crimes.\n\u201cFor folks who are following the law, this evens the playing field,\u201d said Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\nJocelyn Stauber, head of the city\u2019s department of investigation, said she hopes the Chetrit indictment is a deterrent to other landlords.\n\u201cWe suspect there\u2019s more conduct like this out there, which we will be looking for,\u201d Strauber told TRD in September.\nThe Chetrits are a Jewish family originally from Morocco. Joseph\ncame to New York at 17\nand worked in the family textile import and export business before pivoting to real estate in the 1990s. The family began making big deals, becoming known for moving quickly, favoring cash sales and an untraditional style.\nJoseph is about 67 and Meyer is about 61.\n",

        "content": "As expected, the Federal Reserve made another move on Wednesday, cutting its\nbenchmark interest rate\nby a quarter point for the second time in less than two months.\nIt\u2019s the second time the central bank lowered the rate metric in six weeks and one of two cuts the bank previously signaled could be coming this year. In comments at the\ncentral bank\u2019s September meeting\n, authorities teased more interest rate cuts before the new year, though Fed chair Jerome Powell cast uncertainty over that in public comments on Wednesday.\n\u201cAvailable indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace,\u201d the Fed said in a statement, which also acknowledged that inflation remains elevated and the unemployment rate \u201cedged up but remained low through August.\u201d\nChair Jerome Powell said the meeting included \u201cstrongly differing views about how to proceed in December,\u201d when the agency was expected to make a third rate cut.\n\u201cA further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion,\u201d said Powell. \u201cFar from it.\u201d\nA majority of the Federal Open Market Committee voted for the quarter-point cut, but the decision was not unanimous. Stephen Miran, a Fed governor and close ally of President Donald Trump, voted for a larger cut, while another governor voted against any cuts altogether. It\u2019s uncommon for governors to vote on both sides of a decision.\n\u201cThe cut may not dramatically change transaction volume overnight, but it strengthens the sentiment that\u2019s been driving activity, proving that we\u2019re finally operating in a more constructive, stable environment,\u201d Herbert Smith Freehills Kramer\u2019s Dan Berman told\nBisnow\n.\n\nAfter hiking rates in the wake of the pandemic, the\nFed announced a half-point cut\nlast fall, only to hit the pause button in favor of efforts to control inflation.\nIn recent months, Trump and his allies made direct efforts to assert influence over the Fed.\nThe president himself has conducted a pressure campaign on the independent institution, attacking the chair and citing expensive renovations of the bank\u2019s headquarters as a potential means for removal.\nHe\u2019s also been\nattempting to fire one of the Fed\u2019s governors, Lisa Cook\n, for alleged mortgage fraud. That attempt\nhas been unsuccessful\nso far.\nMany in the real estate industry support rate cuts, bullish on how lower rates could spark commercial transactions and unlock supply in the housing market.\nThe average mortgage rate recently hit 6.19 percent, the lowest in more than a year, according to\nFreddie Mac\n. But mortgage rates don\u2019t directly correspond to the Fed\u2019s interest rates; they track more closely to the 10-year Treasury note.\n",

        "content": "A Coconut Grove commercial condo association wants the court-appointed receiver for disgraced developer Rishi Kapoor\u2019s defunct firm to cough up $650,000 in maintenance fees.\nIt\u2019s the latest dust-up surrounding an unfinished mixed-use project at\n3120-3170 Commodore Plaza\npreviously being developed by an affiliate of Location Ventures, the defunct Coral Gables-based firm founded by Kapoor in 2016. This month, Andrew Korge\u2019s Miami-based KOR Development canceled a year-old purchase agreement to buy the project and its ground lease for\n$28.2 million\n.\nBernice Lee\n, a Miami-based attorney who\u2019s the receiver for Location Ventures and its affiliates, has a back-up buyer lined up, but Commodore Centre Condominium Association claims the sale of the Commodore Plaza project is taking too long, according to an Oct. 14 motion filed in Miami federal court.\nLocation Ventures and its affiliates were placed into receivership last year due to a pending U.S. Securities and Exchange civil complaint against the company and Kapoor that alleges he misappropriated\n$93 million\nin investor funds meant for real estate projects.\nKapoor\n, who stepped down as Location Ventures CEO prior to the lawsuit, and the SEC settled in November, but the receiver is still selling company assets to pay creditors.\n\nLee and Commodore Centre Condominium Association\u2019s lawyer declined to comment.\nA\nLocation Ventures\naffiliate that owns 29 of 63 office condos at 3162 Commodore Plaza allegedly hasn\u2019t paid maintenance fees since 2023, the condo association\u2019s motion states. That year, the general contractor renovating the 29 office condos walked off the job, failing to properly secure the building and leaving it \u201cgrossly exposed to the elements,\u201d according to the condo association.\n\u201cTwo years plus of summer rains have poured into the building, causing substantial damage,\u201d the motion states. \u201cThe remaining members of the association have done their best to mitigate the damages. However, [Location Ventures] also stopped paying its maintenance assessments\u2026leaving the association with struggling finances.\u201d\nDespite having more than $2 million in \u201cunencumbered cash on hand\u201d and collecting rental income from one of the office condos that has a tenant, Lee has refused to pay the $650,000, the motion states. In addition, the association wants\nLocation Ventures\nto cover $250,000 needed to \u201cshore up\u201d the building at 3162 Commodore Plaza.\n\u201cWhile the association was hopeful the receiver\u2019s proposed sale would be approved and closed, almost a year has passed since [Lee] filed the sale motion,\u201d Commodore Centre\u2019s court filing states. \u201cAnd it is still not clear if the sale will either be approved or close, as the receiver has not changed course and sought the approval of a back-up bidder.\u201d",

        "content": "Another major brand is joining the growing pipeline of luxury condo developments in North Bay Village.\nCoconut Grove-based Related Group and New York-based Macklowe Properties are in talks with Ritz-Carlton to brand their planned waterfront project on Harbor Island, sources told\nThe Real Deal.\nThe developers\nsecured approval\nfor the two-tower development at two village commission meetings in July and September.\nCommissioners this summer passed a zoning ordinance that will allow the developers to build two 500-foot, 43-story waterfront towers at 8000 East Drive and 7946 East Drive via a special area plan. The project calls for 364 condos and nearly 800 parking spaces, or about two parking spaces per condo.\nRelated is\nleading development of the project\nvia its affiliate, Harbor Island Development Company. It will mark Macklowe\u2019s first development in South Florida.\nThe project will take up the northern tip of Harbor Island west. The developers also plan a 9,000-square-foot public park and a 42-slip private marina. Arquitectonica, led by Bernardo Fort Brescia, is the architect.\n\nA spokesperson for Marriott International, which owns the Ritz-Carlton brand, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Related also did not respond to a request for comment.\nRelated and Macklowe assembled more than 4.1 acres, which include the Biscayne Sea Club co-op and the Majestic Isle condo building. An entity linked to the developers paid $47.7 million for Biscayne Sea Club in late 2023 after a drawn-out and litigious sale process with the co-op community.\nThe developers also\nbought out unit owners\nat the Majestic Isle condo building, which had been declared unsafe.

The company was previously known for building market-rate co-living complexes.\nSoLa Impact just opened a project with 79 affordable units in South Los Angeles. They cost less than $275,000 per unit to build \u2014 quite a discount from the typical $1 million cost per unit to build in Los Angeles.\nFurther north in the San Fernando Valley, meanwhile, developer Passo is gearing up to open its first affordable housing complex, bringing it to life months ahead of schedule and under the planned budget.\nED1, enacted by\nMayor Karen Bass\nin late 2022, allows developers of 100 percent affordable housing projects to avoid the lengthy public hearings process and skip City Council votes. As a result, approval timelines for such projects have been cut down to a few weeks in most cases. The directive has trimmed approval timelines from nine months to just weeks, according to the mayor\u2019s office.\n\nAs of this August, developers had submitted proposals for 35,000 ED1-backed units and secured approvals for about 29,000 as of August. That eclipses the number of affordable housing submissions from 2020 to 2022 as well as the 17,556 units total housing units approved in L.A. during the last fiscal year.\n\u201cMarket-rate housing [construction] has been essentially canceled at this point,\u201d Chris Aiello, founding partner at Six Peak, told CoStar. \u201cVirtually no land makes sense from an investment perspective to build market rate.\u201d\nED1 has inspired similar ordinances across the country, including in Southern California. In early 2023, San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria signed an executive order requiring all 100 percent affordable housing projects to be reviewed and processed within 30 days. Last year, the city saw its highest number of housing permits since 2005.\nStill, L.A. is behind on\nits housing goals\n, namely the permitting of 456,643 new housing units by 2029, including 184,721 set aside for affordable housing.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

As a result, many companies have had to cut jobs and shave down their office and lab space to free up cash.\nThat has prompted some Bay Area biotech real estate developers to consider converting buildings for tech and other office tenants, delaying approved building projects or reducing land banks for planned developments.\n\nThis summer, for example, life sciences real estate developer\nIQHQ sought to delay construction\nof its $1.3 billion, 857,000-square-foot project in South San Francisco by a decade. Harvest Properties also\npressed pause\non a planned research and development campus in Emeryville amid the shaky market.\nIn 2022, Healthpeak sold a 30 percent stake in seven buildings at Point Grand spanning 400,000 square feet to an unidentified sovereign wealth fund, generating $126 million at closing. The Point Grand complex is 60 percent leased, with most of the buildings at the site having undergone redevelopment.\nHealthpeak kicked off the Bay Area\u2019s biotech building boom a decade ago with the first phase of the 800,000-square-foot Cove at Oyster Point campus in South San Francisco. The Bay Area later became one of the country\u2019s biotech hotspots as venture capital and investor money poured in. Still,\nlab leasing nationwide\nhas taken a hit, and the region hasn\u2019t been immune to the falloff.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The City Council on Wednesday approved the rezoning of 230 blocks in Jamaica, Queens, marking the fourth neighborhood rezoning approved during the Adams administration.\nThe plan is expected to create 11,800 housing units, of which 4,200 will be permanently affordable. The rezoning  includes the largest Mandatory Inclusionary Housing zone \u2014\u00a0which requires a certain percentage of housing units to be set aside as affordable \u2014 ever mapped in the city.\nBefore approving the proposal, the City Council\nreduced\nthe density allowed in areas south of downtown Jamaica and removed portions of certain districts along the southern corridor from the rezoning. The changes cut 490 units off the city\u2019s housing projections for the rezoning, which were initially pegged at 12,300 units.\nThe Adams administration also committed $413 million for infrastructure, parks, schools and other improvements. That pledge is on top of the more than $300 million promised as part of the\nCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity\n.\n\nThe rezoning allows more residential development in an area where new construction has been stunted by low-density and manufacturing zoning, as well as parking requirements.\nThe City Council has approved four neighborhood rezonings during the Adams administration:\nMidtown South\n,\nAtlantic Avenue\n, areas around\nfour planned Metro-North stations in the Bronx\nand now Jamaica. On Wednesday, the City Council Committee on Land Use and the Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises signed off on the Long Island City rezoning, which is expected to pave the way for 14,700 new homes over the next decade.\nSpeaker Adrienne Adams has pointed to the Jamaica rezoning as a prime example of why the City Council is critical to the city\u2019s land use review process. Specifically, Adams opposes three housing ballot measures aimed at streamlining the review process and getting around City Council members who consistently reject housing in their districts.\nThe only ballot question that would apply to this rezoning, however, is one that would create a three-person appeals board that could override City Council decisions. The board doesn\u2019t preclude the Council from pushing for investments, and it wouldn\u2019t be able to reverse any non-zoning-related elements of the Council\u2019s decisions on land use actions. Still, the board could decrease the Council\u2019s leverage in negotiations over investments because the Council members couldn\u2019t dangle rejection of a rezoning as effectively.\n",

Schaumburg officials also committed $47 million in public financing through a tax-increment financing district, according to the Daily Herald.\nUrbanStreet\nacquired the Motorola site in 2016, a year after the tech giant moved its headquarters downtown, leaving the suburban campus largely vacant.\nSince then, the developer has added the Element at Veridian apartments, attracted a\nTopGolf\nfacility in 2019 and drawn in homebuilder D.R.

        "content": "Even the country\u2019s largest homebuilder isn\u2019t immune from price-shy buyers.\nArlington-based D.R. Horton said this week that high mortgage rates and sticker shock kept buyers on the sidelines through the end of its fiscal year, forcing the company to sweeten deals to keep sales moving, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nFor the three months ending Sept. 30, the nation\u2019s largest homebuilder\u2019s closings fell 1 percent to 23,368 homes, while full-year sales slipped 5 percent to 84,863.\nQuarterly revenue dropped 3.2 percent to $9.7 billion, and net income tumbled nearly 31 percent to $905 million. For the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, revenue was down 6.9 percent to $34.25 billion and profits sank roughly 25 percent to $3.62 billion.\nThe trend was reflected earlier this year, when D.R. Horton reported\n$1 billion\nin net income in the quarter ending June 30, a 24 percent decline from the same period last year, when the company reported a net income of $1.4 billion.\n\u201cNew home demand is still being impacted by ongoing affordability constraints and cautious consumer sentiment,\u201d Executive Chairman\nDavid Auld\nsaid in a statement. \u201cWe expect our sales incentives to remain elevated in fiscal 2026.\u201d\nThose incentives include rate buydowns, closing-cost assistance and free upgrades \u2014 strategies Horton says it will continue deploying despite easing borrowing costs.\n\nThe average 30-year mortgage rate fell to 6.26 percent, down from nearly 8 percent a year ago, according to Freddie Mac. The Federal Reserve also trimmed its benchmark rate again Wednesday by another 25 basis points to 4 percent, which could give homebuyers a modest boost.\nStill, affordability remains the industry\u2019s central\nchallenge\n. The median new-home price nationwide reached $413,500 in August, up more than 40 percent from a decade ago, Census Bureau data shows.\nHorton\nexecutives said the company is focused on keeping homebuyers\u2019 monthly payments manageable \u2014 a calculation that increasingly depends on lower financing costs.\n\u201cWe did lean into the incentives pretty hard in the quarter, as we talked about and expected to,\u201d CEO Paul Romanowski told investors Tuesday. \u201cFor our buyer, it still comes back to the monthly payment.\u201d\nThe builder, which dominates many of the nation\u2019s Sun Belt markets, has been cutting costs and shifting to smaller floor plans to appeal to entry-level buyers.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "An unnamed Fortune 500 company is bringing a high-tech logistics hub to Cibolo, locking in one of the largest industrial investments ever for the fast-growing San Antonio suburb.\nCibolo\u2019s City Council approved a reinvestment zone Monday and authorized an incentive deal worth about $32 million over 15 years, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n. The unnamed firm plans to spend $450 million to build a robotic distribution center on the former San Antonio Raceway site, a 126-acre parcel that\u2019s been dormant since 2022.\nThe project caps nearly a year of negotiations and promises to reshape the city\u2019s industrial landscape. Cibolo projects a $9.8 million net gain in property tax revenue within the first decade, swelling to $121 million in cumulative city revenue over 30 years.\nThe site currently generates just $14,000 in annual property taxes \u2014 a figure officials say will be eclipsed in the project\u2019s first year of partial operations.\nAmazon\nconfirmed to the San Antonio\nExpress-News\nthat it is not the unnamed company referred to in the city\u2019s \u201cProject Theo\u201d announcement. Amazon is however pushing into using artificial intelligence and robots to help automate its next warehouses.\nThe facility will employ at least 425 full-time workers earning above the San Antonio metro\u2019s median wage, according to city documents. Economic Development Director Rick Vasquez told the council the complex will be run by robots and high-tech equipment, along with employee-operators to manage it all. He described the project as \u201cgenerational,\u201d crediting the city\u2019s partnership with\ngreater:SATX\n\u2014 a regional economic and workforce development organization \u2014 Guadalupe County and the Guadalupe Valley Electric Cooperative.\n\nCibolo has attracted logistical industries before. Aisin Corporation, a Fortune Global 500 firm partly owned by\nToyota\n, opened its $400 million AW Texas transmission plant there in 2021, and\nH-E-B\nlast year launched a $100 million e-commerce fulfillment center. Both projects have helped transform the once-sleepy suburb into a logistics and advanced manufacturing node along the Interstate 10 corridor.\nWhile city officials haven\u2019t confirmed the Fortune 500 firm\u2019s identity, the scale and automation focus have fueled speculation it could be a major retailer or e-commerce company betting on Central Texas\u2019 growing supply chain ecosystem.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Alloy Development\u2019s\nDowntown Brooklyn passive tower\nlanded the month\u2019s largest loan, for $375 million from Kayne Anderson Real Estate. Nearby, Goldman Sachs backed JCS Realty\u2019s\nBoerum Hill rental\nwith a $121 million loan. A self-storage portfolio and art storage warehouse also nabbed refinancings.\nHere are September\u2019s top five loans inked for the outer boroughs.\nPassive payday | $375M | Downtown Brooklyn\nKayne Anderson Real Estate\nprovided $375 million in loans for Alloy Development\u2019s One Third Avenue, a 583-unit tower planned for Downtown Brooklyn. According to Alloy, the 730-foot tower is slated to be the world\u2019s tallest built to passive house standards, a design method aimed at cutting energy costs through extreme insulation. The project is the second phase of \u201cAlloy Block,\u201d which includes the city\u2019s first all-electric skyscraper at 505 State Street and two public schools at 489 State Street. Along with the loan, Vistria Group, in its first ground-up development, infused $120 million in equity and took a majority stake in the project as a limited partner. Alloy, as general partner, is leading development and kicked in $40 million.\nBrooklyn bucks | $121M | Boerum Hill\nGoldman Sachs\nprovided a $121 million loan for Jacob Schwimmer\u2019s Boerum Hill multifamily building at 540 Atlantic Avenue. The fresh financing replaces a $63 million loan from Valley National Bank. Schwimmer\u2019s JCS Realty is nearing completion of the 159-unit building, which includes 48 units for residents at 130 percent of the area median income. Amenities include a gym, media room, business center and rooftop terrace.\nSelf-storage score | $120M | Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn\n\nAffinius Capital Management\nprovided a $120 million loan for a three-property self-storage portfolio owned by Prime Storage. Lender 3650 Capital provided an additional $36 million in mezzanine debt. The loan will be used to refinance 1260 Zerega Avenue in the Bronx, 31-07 20th Avenue in Queens and 1084 Rockaway Avenue in Brooklyn. The facilities were opened and renovated in 2016 and 2017, according to\nMulti-Housing News\n.\nWarehouse windfall | $105M | Bushwick\nDeutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs\nprovided a $105 million loan for Uovo\u2019s art storage facility at 105 Evergreen Avenue in Bushwick. The fresh financing replaced a $57.4 million loan from PNC Bank. Uovo bought the 112,000 square-foot industrial building in 2020 for $126 million and redeveloped it, according to\nCrain\u2019s\n. It\u2019s climate-controlled with 25-foot ceilings and multiple emergency generators. The new mortgage has a 10-year term and a 5.9 percent interest rate, Crain\u2019s reported, citing the ratings agency KBRA. Uovo will invest the proceeds from the refinancing back into the business, per Crain\u2019s.\nTerra trove | $74M | Long Island City\nMorgan Stanley\nprovided a $74 million loan for ZD Jasper Realty\u2019s new mixed-use development at 45-19 Davis Street in Long Island City. The fresh financing replaced a $29 million construction loan from Bank Hapoalim. The recently-completed 17-story development, known as Terra, has 122 units, ground-floor retail space and a parking garage.\n",

        "content": "Four neighborhood rezonings down, one more to go.\nThe City Council on Wednesday approved the Jamaica rezoning, which is projected to net nearly 12,000 apartments.\nIt also reached a deal on the Long Island City rezoning. The Adams administration pledged more than $1.5 billion in various investments to secure the local Council member\u2019s approval. That\nrezoning\n, which must go back to City Planning for review before going to a full City Council vote, is expected to result in 14,700 apartments.\nThe commitments made in these rezonings will be the purview of the next mayor, of course.\u00a0 As will those made as part of the other three neighborhood rezonings approved during the Adams administration.\nThe power dynamics around such rezonings may change considerably next year as well if three housing-related ballot proposals are approved. In a world where these rezonings are still pending and the ballot measures are approved, only one of the\nthree\nquestions would apply to these neighborhood rezonings. That measure would create a three-member appeals board that could reverse the City Council\u2019s rejection of a land-use action.\nCouncil leaders argue that this removes the chamber\u2019s ability to fight for the types of investments and concessions won as a condition of approval of rezonings like the ones in LIC and Jamaica. The board doesn\u2019t bar the Council from pushing for investments. The board could arguably decrease the Council\u2019s leverage in negotiations over investments because the Council members couldn\u2019t dangle rejection of a rezoning as effectively. At the same time, an administration that wants to have a good relationship with Council members is not just going to outright dismiss demands for funding to improve their districts. We will probably never know if the final version of these rezonings would look the same if the appeals board were in existence.\nOn Wednesday, the City Council also approved the\nredevelopment\nof the Kingsbridge Armory, a plan that calls for a 17,000-seat arena and the demolition of two buildings used by the state National Guard to make way for a new 16-story building that will net 500 affordable housing units.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nAre you going to the \u201cUnited for NYC\u201d fundraiser for Andrew Cuomo on Thursday? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nThe City Council\u2019s Committee on Consumer and Worker Protection will hold a hearing on Thursday on a bill introduced after the deadly shooting at\n345 Park Avenue\nin July. The Aland Etienne Safety and Security Act, named for one of the security guards killed, would set minimum wage and benefits for non-government security guards.\nDuring a press conference on Wednesday, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, said she expects the bill to pass.\n\u201cThe cost of living for folks who would literally die for you and me needs to be addressed,\u201d she said.\nThe Real Estate Board of New York believes the measure undermines wage negotiations between the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations and 32BJ SEIU and that the city\u2019s ability to set minimum wages is preempted by state law.\n\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nMTA Chair Janno Lieber estimates that the cost of Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani\u2019s pledge to make city buses free would cost $1 billion,\nGothamist reports\n. Lieber told reporters on Wednesday that in the coming years, assuming the MTA cracked down on fare evasion, the agency would need to make up for $1 billion in lost revenue. Lieber also said the policy could add costs for the additional buses and depots that would be needed to accommodate higher demand.\n\u2014\nMy colleague Lilah Burke\nreports\nthat Joseph Chetrit was indicted on Wednesday on felony charges of tenant harassment.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$20.1 million\nfor a 4,492-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at 111 West 57th Street in the Plaza District. The Field Team at Sotheby\u2019s International Realty had the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$26.4 million\nfor a 5,612-square-foot vacant lot at 140 Fulton Street in FiDi. Bank Hapoalim sold the property after taking it over with 142 Fulton Street in\nJuly for $36.9 million\n. The new buyer was Rivington Company.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$20 million\nfor a 4,300-square-foot co-op at 990 Fifth Avenue on the Upper East Side. Christine Miller Martin, Kimberly Church and Hunter Hulshizer from Compass have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 10,383-square-foot, four-story residential building at 1013 Adee Avenue in Bronxwood.

        "content": "Warren Buffett famously said, \u201cOnly when the tide goes out do you discover who\u2019s been swimming naked.\u201d\nIn the same vein, the proposed City Charter revisions are revealing who is truly pro-housing and who has just been faking it.\nLast year, the City of Yes vote similarly\nexposed\ncertain politicians and neighborhoods as anti-housing, but we already knew who they were \u2014 people who oppose change to their neighborhoods, aka conservatives.\nOn the charter questions, being voted on through Nov. 4, it\u2019s the progressives\u2019 turn to show their true colors.\nCity Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and many of her colleagues have spent taxpayer money (illegally, in my view) to persuade New Yorkers to vote \u201cno\u201d on revisions that would help certain housing proposals to win approval even if the local Council member objects.\nThey claim\ntheir campaign\nis legal because it does not explicitly call for voting \u201cno.\u201d That\u2019s laughable, as any impartial reading of the Council\u2019s mailers would make clear. The Council should have raised private money to fight this battle, just as supporters of the ballot questions did.\nBut the greater problem is that self-proclaimed progressives oppose\nthese measures\nin the first place.\nSome, like Brooklyn Council member Lincoln Restler, have tried to split the baby.\nRestler supports a \u201cyes\u201d vote on Questions 2 and 3 but\nnot on Question 4\n. Opponents of Question 4 argue that Council members can use their de facto\nveto power\nto force developers to make projects more affordable or add community benefits. Allowing developers to appeal rejections to a three-person panel would undermine that, they say.\nReality check: The appeals panel (the mayor, borough president and Council speaker) would also have a strong incentive to deliver community benefits.\nBut they would also have an incentive to help a wider area \u2014 the borough or the city \u2014 because they have broader constituencies.\nThe housing crisis was caused in part by allowing hyperlocal self-interest to prevail over the greater good. Maybe Restler would resist this pressure and make the right call on project approvals, but his colleagues and successors\nmight not\n.\nThe evidence is the housing crisis itself. The current land-use approval framework, known as Ulurp,\nhasn\u2019t worked\n. After 35 years, it\u2019s time to try something new.\n\nThe appeals panel, from which applicants would need two votes out of three, would be less vulnerable to local opposition like the Jamaica Campaign Against Rezoning. JCARE fears new housing from the\nupzoning\nof the Queens neighborhood would push out people of color, despite a\nlarge body of research\nto the contrary.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely heartbreaking,\u201d co-founder Nafisa Mahmud told NY1. \u201cThe vast majority of the housing will not be affordable for working-class families, and in many cases, middle-class families, so the people here are looking at the real risk of displacement.\u201d\nThe article\u2019s\nvery next sentence\nwas: Over the past decade, the average rent in Jamaica rose from $1,681 to $2,737, an increase of 63 percent.\nHow\u2019s that no-rezoning strategy working out, Nafisa?\nShe might say the average rent would have increased even more if new housing had been built, because most new units are priced above the average.\nBut if her concern is current Jamaica tenants, her question should be: What effect would new supply have on their rents?\nRealPage just reported that nationwide, the average advertised rent last quarter decreased for only the second time since 2009. It\u2019s not because landlords suddenly became charitable. Rather, a wave of new apartments gave tenants more options, forcing owners to reduce rents to fill units.\nSome tenants renewing leases, in turn, got concessions to match the rents on vacant units in their buildings. \u201cRenters in good standing aren\u2019t going to want to pay more than someone coming in the front door,\u201d housing expert Jay Parsons\ntweeted\n.\nThis won\u2019t last, however. Rents will go back up because multifamily development is projected to slump, giving landlords the upper hand \u2014 especially in New York City.\n\u201cGround-up starts have slowed nationwide, and New York\u2019s pipeline has contracted more than any other major U.S. market,\u201d wrote\nLev Mavashev\n, founder and principal of New York brokerage Alpha Realty. \u201cThat means fewer completions through 2026 and 2027 \u2014 less new competition, a firmer rent floor, and a more predictable revenue base for multifamily assets.\u201d\nNafisa Mahmud is never going to see Mavashev\u2019s piece, or this one, or any of the research on the\neffect of new supply\n. Perhaps Restler will, but even if he does, Council members will always be more influenced by their loudest constituents, such as Mahmud.\nThat\u2019s why a \u201cyes\u201d vote on the charter questions is crucial. But if nothing else, like a receding tide, the proposals have separated New Yorkers who really want to make housing affordable from those who have nothing below their waist.\n",

Business Journal\nreported\n, citing Colliers.\nStill, L.A. is a bright spot, outperforming nationwide trends. The city boasts 94.9 percent occupancy compared to the 93.2 percent across the country.\nThe slight decrease in occupancy and rent prices stem from shifts in supply and demand rather than \u201cfundamental issues,\u201d Colliers senior executive vice president Kitty Wallace told the outlet. Wallace also cited slowing population growth due to this year\u2019s immigration raids in Los Angeles.\nThe downtown and Hollywood/Mid-Wilshire submarkets are partially to blame for the sagging numbers.\nDowntown occupancy\nis at 92.9 percent, while Hollywood/Mid-Wilshire is at 94.1 percent. Before the pandemic, developers were on a construction spree downtown in the hope of revitalizing the commercial center. But overbuilding, combined with the hollowing-out of downtown post-pandemic, became a problem.\n\u201cDowntown didn\u2019t come back, and all that brand new product had just been built,\u201d Wallace said, noting that Hollywood and\nKoreatown\nfaced similar trends over the past decade.\nThat glut could soon reverse, however. With\ndevelopers wary of Measure ULA\n\u2019s transfer tax and uncertain financing conditions, an impending construction cooldown could tighten the market.\n\nDevelopers started 2,554 units last quarter, while 5,292 units were delivered.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good amount for Los Angeles,\u201d Wallace said, though she noted that it isn\u2019t sustainable as developers pause or shelve entitled projects.\nDevelopers shouldn\u2019t be afraid of putting shovels in dirt right now, however.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re breaking ground today, and your property is [delivered] in 18 months to 36 months, that\u2019s when all of the entitlements that are here are going to be usurped,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd for all those units, the absorption will have taken place, and our rents are going to skyrocket.\u201d\nUnder its\nhousing element\n, the City of Los Angeles must plan for 456,643 new housing units by 2029, with 184,721 of those being designated for affordable housing.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "New York City residents are voting on half a dozen ballot measures this election season.\nOne of those is a statewide question about land use in Adirondack Park, the largest publicly protected area in the lower 48.\nTechnically, the state is seeking a constitutional amendment to allow the use of 323 acres of parkland for winter sports.\nHowever, what the language of the proposal does not say is that the 323 acres have already been developed. The question is whether voters will bring the area into compliance, allow improvements, and approve the purchase of 2,500 acres of forest land to make up for it.\n\u201cThis was a good settlement to what could have been a lawsuit,\u201d said John Sheehan, communications director of the nonprofit organization Adirondack Council.\nAdirondack Park is a mixture of public and private lands within a six-million-acre boundary. As enshrined in New York\u2019s constitution, the public lands can\u2019t be developed without a constitutional amendment.\nThe state\u2019s Olympic Regional Development Association, which manages the infrastructure that was built for the 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, allegedly violated that law. The agency built Nordic ski trails and a lodge at Mt Van Hoevenberg in preparation for national and world competitions.\n\u201cWe had a choice. We could sue and stop the authority from holding those games. And put a big hole in the Lake Placid community\u2019s tourism budget that year and put a lot of people out of work,\u201d Sheehan said. \u201cOr we could ask for essentially a settlement that would be for the authority to get a constitutional amendment.\u201d\nEnvironmental protectionist groups in the Adirondacks, including the Adirondack Council, have backed the proposal and Gov. Kathy Hochul has signed legislation implementing the constitutional amendment if it should pass.\n\nIt\u2019s so far unclear where the 2,500 acres could be added. The legislature will need to approve any purchase and addition.\nThe state is looking at several parcels elsewhere in Essex County, where Mt Van Hoevenberg is located, Sheehan said. The county abuts Lake Champlain and contains almost all of the state\u2019s 46 high peaks. Converting private to state land would likely open up further recreation opportunities, Sheehan said, since state lands would likely have trails built or opened.\nThe state is looking to buy parcels elsewhere for Adirondack Park, such as\n32,000 acres of forest\nin Hamilton County, once part of the estate of socialite Marylou Whitney. But Sheehan said he believes the administration will seek to purchase land in Essex County, nearby the original 323 acres, to comply with the amendment.\nThe county is a study in economic contrasts, Sheehan said, with wealthy residents and investment in Lake Placid, but economic deprivation elsewhere.\nThe ballot measure does not have truly mobilized opposition. Sheehan said the biggest hurdle for the environmental groups supporting the provision is helping the public understand what it means.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not quite clear that this is a remediation from the language on the ballot,\u201d Sheehan said. \u201cOur biggest concern is that people, out of legitimate care for the Adirondacks, would vote no because they\u2019re suspicious of what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n",

Decades into the business, the family is aiming for the big leagues, partnering on billion-dollar projects with Terra, Related Ross and the Trump-affiliated 1789 Capital.\nThey are leveling up their projects, taking bigger swings with higher price tags, but the risk rises with the reward. Some of their most ambitious endeavors have been dogged by controversy and litigation.\nThe shift to more prodigious projects follows a quiet transition of power within their ranks in recent years. The first generation of Frisbies have handed over the reins to the second generation. Rob Frisbie Jr. and his brother-in-law, Cody Crowell, now stand at the helm of a small firm with growing ambitions in South Florida and beyond.\nThe first generation, brothers Rob Sr., Rick and Dave Frisbie, got their start in real estate renovating Boston brownstones while they were students at Harvard University in the 1970s. After separate careers, they launched the Frisbie Group in Palm Beach in 1996, starting with spec projects on the island and West Palm Beach\u2019s downtown Clematis corridor.\nDecades into the business, they were well positioned for Florida\u2019s pandemic boom. In 2020, they completed Via Flagler, a 1.3-acre mixed-use development at 221 Royal Poinciana Way in Palm Beach that includes restaurants, retail, offices and six condominiums.\nThat same year, they completed an oceanfront resort in the Florida Keys, called Islands of Islamorada, which the family sold last in 2024 for\n$72 million\n. They bought the site for $7 million in 2017. In 2021, the Frisbies completed an oceanfront four-unit townhome development at 456 South Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach. They acquired the site for $26.3 million in 2018, and sold all the units of the project for $109.1 million, records show.\nTheir current pipeline includes\na 1,145-unit multifamily project\nslated for the former Palm Beach Kennel Club, for which they\u2019ve partnered with David Martin\u2019s Coconut Grove-based firm Terra. They also acquired 5,300 acres near Mountain City, Tennessee, where the family is planning a resort dubbed the Forge Mountain Club,\nWHJL\nreported last year.\nIt hasn\u2019t been all smooth sailing, though. The Frisbies partnered with Hines in 2021 to buy a West Palm Beach development site where they planned a Robert A.M. Stern-designed luxury condo project. Two Roads Development sued Frisbie, alleging it was cut out of the deal. They reached\na settlement\nin 2023, and a month later Frisbie and Hines sold the project to Related Companies for\n$194.6 million\n. Suzanne Frisbie, Dave Frisbie\u2019s wife and a top agent with the Corcoran Group, stayed on to oversee sales for the project.\nLast year, the Frisbies proposed a 37-unit residential project for a 5.8-acre Palm Beach site owned by Wells Fargo. The property is mostly occupied by an underutilized surface parking lot, and the Frisbies sought to build luxury homes in the style of Palm Beach\u2019s celebrated early architects, John Volk, Maurice Fatio, Addison Mizner, Howard Major and Marion Sims Wyeth.\nPaul Leone, the longtime CEO of the Breakers and a partner with the Frisbies on Via Flagler, defended their proposal for the site.\n\u201cWho better to develop it than the Frisbie Group, our neighbors with a track record,\u201d he said at a town meeting last year.\nNonetheless, the Frisbies endured hours of withering criticism and accusations from their island neighbors in public meetings, and the project\nultimately stalled out\n.\nIn Boca Raton, the Frisbies are partners with Terra on One Boca, a contentious redevelopment of the city\u2019s government campus. An opposition group has gathered more than 7,000 resident signatures to fight the project, and approval now rests on a referendum slated for March of next year. Earlier this week, the partners announced\nscaled back plans\nwith fewer residential units and office space.\n\u201cIt can be scary, and it can be overwhelming to work on projects that do build a consensus,\u201d Rob Frisbie Jr. said. \u201c[It\u2019s] not easy.\u201d\nBut the sting of public backlash can be soothed by other projects with deep-pocketed backers. The firm is partnering with\n1789 Capital\n, an \u201canti-woke\u201d investment firm led by co-founders Omeed Malik and Chris Buskirk. Donald Trump Jr. is also a partner in 1789, which is launching a $1 billion fund with the Frisbies to focus on South Florida real estate projects.\nHere\u2019s a look at the Frisbie family:\nThe Founding Generation\nRobert Frisbie Sr.\nLineage: Married to Kim Frisbie, father to Robert Frisbie Jr., Frances Frisbie Criddle, Katie Frisbie Crowell and Richard (Rick) D.W.

        "content": "New York\u2019s real estate leaders are already\nover the 421a replacement\n.\nMAG Partners chief executive officer MaryAnne Gilmartin said the 485x program \u201creally needs to be reconsidered,\u201d calling it unworkable for ground-up developers at a\nCrain\u2019s\nand REBNY event this week.\n\u201cMy hope is that we don\u2019t live with this program for a decade,\u201d she said.\nThe 485x incentive, included in last year\u2019s state budget, was designed to revive affordable housing production after the 421a program expired in 2022. But its $40-per-hour minimum wage requirement on projects of 100 units or more triggered a\nflood of 99-unit proposals\nacross the city, a workaround industry insiders say could cripple large-scale development.\nCBRE\u2019s Mary Ann Tighe, who heads the firm\u2019s New York tri-state operations, put the numbers on stark display: New York would need 5,050 99-unit buildings to meet its housing needs.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an impulse to treat development punitively,\u201d she said, pushing back on critics who see tax incentives as handouts. \u201cWe have to stop thinking about tax incentives as some kind of giveaway.\u201d\n\nHousing starts for market-rate units\ndropped\n67 percent from last year, falling from an average of 7,500 per quarter since 2021 to 2,500 this year, according to CoStar data from last month. The pipeline of units under construction declined over the same period from 71,000 to 47,000, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n.\nThe frustration underscores the widening gap between Albany\u2019s political calculus and developers\u2019 financial realities. The wage mandate, combined with rising construction and financing costs, effectively sidelines much of the private sector from building rental housing at scale.\nStill, optimism flickered. Tighe said Manhattan leasing and foot traffic have bounced back sharply since the pandemic, and that the city\u2019s underlying resilience remains intact.\nTighe and Gilmartin\u2019s comments also fed into a broader theme of the event: the need for structural fixes to facilitate housing construction.\nSome panelists endorsed the charter reform\nballot measures\nthat could loosen the City Council\u2019s grip over project approvals, arguing they might finally let pro-housing members vote \u201cyes\u201d without fear of backlash.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Lawmakers and the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office on Thursday announced a new bill upgrading criminal penalties for tenant harassment.\nThe legislation would create a new class D felony, aggravated harassment of a rent-regulated tenant. Harassment of rent-stabilized tenants is already a class E felony, but the bill would upgrade the charges if landlords harass tenants systematically across multiple buildings or have already been found guilty of the lesser charge.\nThe new legislation underscores the district attorney\u2019s focus on targeting landlords. The announcement came one day after the indictment of one of New York\u2019s best-known real estate dealmakers, adding\nJoseph Chetrit to a case against his brother Meyer\n. Authorities previously claimed the tenant harassment charges against the members of the influential Manhattan\nreal estate family\nover a Chelsea building they own would boost a broader enforcement push against landlords.\n\u201cWe need more tools to hold bad actors accountable,\u201d said Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg at a press conference Thursday. \u201cWe want to have a chilling effect.\u201d\nThe lower felony charge, which requires harassment of at least two tenants, already carries a\u00a0 maximum prison time of four years, although this is very rarely applied. The higher felony charge carries a maximum prison time of seven years.\nAfter tenant-friendly legislation passed in 2019, landlords have had less financial incentive to harass tenants in rent-stabilized apartments. Previously, property owners were able to legally raise the rent if there was a vacancy, which encouraged landlords to pursue turnover.\nThe Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019\nended that incentive\n. But tenants\u2019 lawyers say they haven\u2019t seen a drop-off in harassment.\n\nState Senator Brian Kavanagh, who represents parts of lower Manhattan, acknowledged this at a press conference, saying the legislature had closed opportunities for landlords to raise rents on rent-regulated units.\n\u201cMost landlords are doing the right thing, they\u2019re following the law,\u201d Kavanagh said. \u201cBut unfortunately there are landlords in this city who often systematically try to go after their tenants and try to push them out of their homes.\u201d\nAssemblymember Micah Lasher, who represents the Upper West Side, said landlords should see higher penalties if they harass tenants at a higher scale.\nLasher mentioned at the press conference that his first New York apartment rented after graduating from college was owned by\nSteve Croman\n, a now-infamous landlord who would later face allegations that he harassed tenants across multiple buildings. Lasher said he sued Croman in small claims court to recover his security deposit after an electrical fire made the apartment uninhabitable. Croman eventually\npaid $8 million in tenant restitution\nafter a broad civil case and went to prison for several months related to mortgage and tax fraud.\n\u201cThat was a case where it became clear that the civil and administrative remedies are not enough,\u201d said Lasher, who previously served as chief of staff in the state attorney general\u2019s office.\nTenant harassment has made headlines recently as Bragg pursues tenant harassment charges against Joseph and Meyer Chetrit. The two brothers have been indicted related to allegations that they harassed two senior citizens and left them in unsafe conditions to encourage them to leave their rent-stabilized apartments. Lawyers for the Chetrits deny the allegations and have said the prosecution is pursuing a political agenda.\n\u201cWhere power asymmetries exist, criminal activity follows,\u201d Bragg said.\n",

        "content": "The\nSalty Donut\nisn\u2019t worth its salt, if you ask the confectionary\u2019s lender.\nCity National Bank of Florida\nsued the Miami-based donut maker, claiming it defaulted on a $4.8 million loan issued in October 2021, according to a lawsuit filed in August in Miami-Dade County Circuit Court.\nThe Salty Donut borrowed the money to develop a store in Houston, but it never came to fruition, City National Bank\u2019s lawyer Johanna Castellon Vega said. The store was supposed to open at 1658 Westheimer Road in Houston\u2019s\nMontrose\nneighborhood.\nThe loan matured in January, the bank claims, but it entered into a forbearance agreement with The Salty Donut in May, pushing the maturity date back to June 27. The loan still hasn\u2019t been paid off, according to the bank.\nSalty Donut founders Andres Rodriguez and Amanda Pizarro personally guaranteed the loan, the lawsuit claims. City National Bank is asking the court to require repayment as well as interest and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\n\u201cOur client is at their wits end with this, knowing this is an entity that has several locations, not only in Texas, but here in Florida and in other states,\u201d Vega said.\nThe Salty Donut didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment in time for publication.\nPizarro and Rodriguez\nfounded the company in 2014\n, originally operating out of a vintage camper, and\nopened the first brick-and-mortar store\nin Miami\u2019s Wynwood neighborhood in 2016. The company operates 21 locations, in Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Dallas, Denver, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, Tampa and West Palm Beach, with additional stores coming soon to Atlanta, Charlotte and the Washington, D.C. area, according to the Salty Donut\u2019s website.\nHouston is missing from the list. So is the Houston suburb of Katy, where a Salty Donut outpost opened late last year. The company opened its first Houston location at the 34-acre mixed-use development LaCenterra, at 23501 Cinco Ranch Boulevard, about 30 miles west of downtown Houston.\n",

Business First\nreported\n.\nThe seller, an affiliate of\nMWest Holdings\n, bought the property in late 2018 for $73.3 million, making the latest sale a 29 percent discount, Commercial Observer\nreported\n. JLL represented the seller and secured the financing in the transaction.\nThe View was an attractive pickup for Concord because of Koreatown\u2019s \u201cinstitutional quality and strong fundamentals,\u201d said Jonathan Fhima, Concord\u2019s chief investment officer and managing principal. \u201cKoreatown has led all Los Angeles submarkets in multifamily absorption over the past five years.\u201d\nOver the summer,\nConcord spent $79 million\non five\nhistoric apartment buildings\nacross the city, including three in Koreatown. Those properties are The Langham, a 181-unit building at 715 Normandie Avenue; The Sir Francis Drake, a 61-unit structure at 841 Serrano Avenue; and The Piccadilly, a 74-unit building at 682 Irolo Street.\nThe View, Concord\u2019s latest purchase, was built in 1965 and underwent a nearly $26 million renovation before CIM Group acquired the property in 2013. The complex features 12 studio apartments, 120 one-bedroom units and 36 two-bedroom units.\nThe purchase of the View complex increases the company\u2019s L.A. presence in the face of decreasing apartment construction across the city due to rising material and labor costs and lengthy approval processes.\n\u201cThe lack of apartment construction has caused major supply constraints which will cause continued upward pressure on rents,\u201d Concord CEO Reuben Robin said. \u201cThat, coupled with the massive infrastructure investment due to upcoming events like the\nOlympics\nand World Cup, keeps us feeling good about the imminent growth in this city.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

But in reality, the rezoning likely will generate between 8,500 and 14,650 new homes by 2045, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n, citing a report from the Controller\u2019s Office.\nThe gap between what the city hopes to accomplish in the next 20 years and what it can reasonably expect to build largely comes down to housing prices and how they trend over the coming decades.\nIf housing prices rise in line with the rest of the country, similar to before the pandemic, then it\u2019s predicted that just 10,098 homes would be built on the rezoned parcels.\nIf the city\u2019s housing prices\nrebound to pre-pandemic levels\nby 2030 and then grow faster than the nationwide market until 2045, then up to 17,845 new homes are predicted for the rezoned parcels.\nWithout rezoning, those same parcels likely would produce just 1,600 to 3,200 homes.\nThe city of San Francisco has been tasked with planning for 82,069 new homes as part of the\nstate-mandated housing production cycle\n. A city report this spring showed capacity for 58,100 new units between permitted projects and existing zoning.\nIt all comes down to whether developers and homebuilders can feasibly produce the number of housing units the city can make way for by rezoning.\n\u201cWe want it to be faster than what the numbers show, but that is not something we as a city can be in control of,\u201d\ncity planning director Sarah Dennis Phillips\ntold the outlet. \u201cWe understand that the more capacity we create, the more we\u2019re creating better conditions for the economy to work in.

        "content": "The late gallerist Barbara Gladstone was known to have an eye for talent, working with art world luminaries like Robert Rauschenberg and Keith Haring.\nShe also apparently had an eye for real estate. Her sprawling bayfront home in the Cutchogue hamlet sold for $11.2 million, setting a record on Long Island\u2019s North Fork for a single-family sale. The sale was executed by Gladstone\u2019s estate.\nThe home at 12120 New Suffolk Avenue hit the market shortly after Gladstone\u2019s death in June 2024, asking $12 million. After an initial contract signed in January 2025 fell through, Compass\u2019 Bridget Elkin and her husband Eric found another buyer in September who closed on the property today. Douglas Elliman\u2019s Kristy Naddell brought the buyer.\nThe area\u2019s previous top deal, a waterfront home in\nneighboring Mattituck that sold for $10 million\nlast year, served as a point of comparison for how to price the home, according to Elkin. She also sold an $8 million home in Cutchogue earlier this year, which set the town price record.\n\u201cThese landmark transactions sort of reflect the North Fork\u2019s evolution into a more mature coastal market, and are approaching really like mid-tier Hampton benchmarks,\u201d she said.\nThe deal is a high watermark for a stretch of land that has seen\nvalues skyrocket in the last few years\nas city dwellers moved out east, with many seeking the pastoral quietude of the North Fork in lieu of the bustling and scene-y South Fork.\n\u201cPeople see the value here\u2026it\u2019s somewhat of a saturated market on the South Fork,\u201d Elkin said. \u201cWe have a little bit more of a non-flashy appeal.\u201d\nGladstone purchased the home in 2012 for $5.5 million. She undertook a meticulous renovation with the help of local designer Hadley Wiggins that left intact the shingle-style home\u2019s summer cottage aesthetic.\nThe 7,500-square-foot home sits on a 1.2-acre plot with 140 feet of bayfront that gives direct access to a private beach. The first floor features a waterside living room and dining room with fireplace alcoves and a screen-in outdoor porch with an outdoor dining room and kitchen.\nThe second-floor primary suite has an ensuite bath, multiple walk-in closets, a dressing room and a sitting room with an oversized fireplace. The rest of the floor has five other bedrooms, a library, an office, multiple wet bars and five bathrooms.\nA gunite pool faces the water and bayfront lawn. A beach-side carriage house holds a great room, home theater, and gym.\nTraditionally known for its more humble home nestled between acres of farmland, the North Fork experienced a surge of activity in the wake of the pandemic that has continued unabated through this year.\nPrices have climbed sharply since 2020, culminating in the median sale price surpassing the million-dollar threshold earlier this year, according to\ndata from appraisal firm Miller Samuel\n.\nGladstone, who died last year at the age of 89, had another one of her properties set a sales record earlier this year, albeit a heavily-caveated one. Her\nAnnabelle Selldorf\n-renovated Chelsea townhouse sold for $13.1 million in August, coming out to $2,980 square feet per square feet, a record for a townhouse resale in the neighborhood.\n",

        "content": "NuRock Companies proposes a 130-unit affordable apartment project near Opa-locka, marking its second planned development in the area.\nAlpharetta, Georgia-based NuRock wants to develop the L-shaped building, called Heritage at Gratigny Park, on a nearly 1-acre vacant lot on the southwest corner of Northwest 120th Terrace and Northwest 27th Place in unincorporated Miami-Dade County, according to a company filing submitted to the county this month. The area is largely industrial.\nNuRock is asking Miami-Dade for a zoning verification, which is generally requested to determine specifics on development regulations governing a property and whether it has outstanding violations. The firm\u2019s application also shows that it plans to seek funding from the Florida Housing Finance Corporation, a quasi-governmental entity that disburses financing for affordable and workforce housing development, including low income housing tax credits. FHFC usually requires a zoning verification from the municipality or county where a project will be built.\nNearby, NuRock plans another 130-unit multifamily building under the\nLive Local Act\n, a state law that incentivizes the development of below-market rate apartments by awarding property tax breaks to developers and allowing them to build larger projects. The 11-story\nResidences at West View Landing\nis planned for the southeast corner of Northwest 27th Avenue and Northwest 123rd Street in an unincorporated area of the county. All units will be designated for households earning up to 80 percent of the area median income, which exceeds the Live Local Act requirement that 40 percent of units are for tenants earning up to 120 percent of AMI.\nNuRock paid $2.6 million for the 0.6-acre, two-lot Residences at West View Landing development site in May, according to records.\nThe Heritage at Gratigny Park development site is owned by an entity tied to Bay Harbor Islands-based real estate development and investment firm\nArt + Tec Development\n, led by Gabriel Boano and Paula Lowenstein Boano.\nIn 2021, Art + Tec proposed an eight-story, 168-unit apartment building on the property, according to media reports. Construction never started, records show.\nNuRock is a multifamily development and management firm primarily focusing on affordable housing. Robert Hoskins is managing principal.\nIn Pompano Beach, NuRock developed the 92-unit Crystal Lake complex at 350 Northeast 32nd Court, and the 116-unit Heritage at Pompano Station building at 400 North Flagler Avenue. Both apartment developments include affordable units.\nLast year, NuRock completed the 140-unit Residences at Naranja Lakes with a pair of five-story buildings at 27550 South Dixie Highway in south Miami-Dade\u2019s\nLeisure City\nneighborhood.\nIn Hollywood, NuRock plans a 134-unit apartment project for low-income families at 6015 Washington Street. Hollywood commissioners voted in 2022 to lend\n$640,000\nto NuRock in support of its application to FHFC.\nAffordable housing developers remain insulated from market downturns due to unceasing demand for below-market rate apartments, especially in Miami-Dade where many remain priced out of market-rate apartments. Developers also can use LIHTC, government subsidies and grants that could improve their financial returns.\n",

        "content": "One of downtown Houston\u2019s most recognizable office towers is getting a $50 million makeover designed to pull it out of the post-pandemic doldrums and reconnect it with the street.\nGlobal developer Hines is overseeing the renovation of 910 Louisiana Street \u2014 formerly One Shell Plaza \u2014 in a sweeping redesign that will replace the tower\u2019s closed-off ground level with glass walls, retail and green space, the Houston Chronicle\nreported\n.\nThe project, slated for completion in 2027, is part of a broader wave of downtown office reinventions as landlords grapple with record vacancies and tenants demand more light, amenities and street-level energy.\nHines built the brutalist,\n50-story skyscraper\nin 1971 as its first major office development, later selling the property but staying on as manager.\nPartners Real Estate leases the tower for owner Busycon Properties. Shell occupied most of the 1.6 million-square-foot building for decades before relocating west, leaving behind an 800,000-square-foot lease it subleased to firms like NRG Energy.\nBut with that lease set to expire in December \u2014 and\nNRG preparing to vacate\n\u2014 occupancy will plunge from 86 percent to roughly 35 percent early next year, Partners said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a conundrum that all landlords are dealing with,\u201d\nHines\nproperty management director Mark Janssen told the outlet. \u201cSince COVID and working from home, \u2018office\u2019 has almost become a dirty word among investors.\u201d\nBusycon is taking the long view, however, and Janssen said he is betting that Houston\u2019s core will rebound.\nAccording to early construction filings, the overhaul will cost $49.6 million. Designs call for replacing heavy stone facades with floor-to-ceiling glass, creating transparent edges for food and beverage tenants, and softening the stark plaza with landscaping, curved paths and shaded seating.\nA 5,000-square-foot terrace and tenant lounge will overlook Smith Street, alongside an upgraded fitness center and a new 9,000-square-foot conference facility.\n\u201cThe redevelopment is focusing on the street life experience in and around the building, which is what tenants are craving,\u201d said Partners\u2019 Chip Colvill, who\u2019s marketing the tower with Winfield Haggard Jr.\nBusycon joins a string of landlords \u2014 including owners of Allen Center, Houston Center and the JPMorgan Chase Tower \u2014 investing heavily to keep aging office assets relevant. While renovations don\u2019t always yield instant results, the 910 Louisiana project is a bet on\ndowntown Houston\nevolving with the times.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Bal Harbour will join a lawsuit challenging Senate Bill 180, a law that restricts local governments\u2019 control over planning and land use regulations. It marks the village\u2019s latest fight against state legislation restricting control, following its opposition to the Live Local Act.\nMore than two dozen cities are plaintiffs in the\nlawsuit\nagainst Florida, which was filed in Leon County in late September. The state law, titled \u201cEmergencies,\u201d was signed into law this summer. It bans local governments from passing \u201cmore restrictive or burdensome\u201d comprehensive plan amendments, land development regulations, or procedures concerning review, approval, or issuance of site plans, development permits, or development orders starting on Aug. 1, 2024 until Oct. 1, 2027.\nMunicipalities argue that the law infringes on \u201chome rule\u201d authority over land use and zoning regulations. The village council voted to join the lawsuit at its meeting on Tuesday, following a discussion about the litigation at a September meeting. Each city that is participating in the lawsuit is paying a $10,000 flat fee for trial proceedings.\nOther South Florida cities and counties fighting Senate Bill 180 include Fort Lauderdale, Homestead, Cutler Bay, Pinecrest, Palm Beach. Miami Shores, Weston, Pompano Beach and North Palm Beach.\n\u201cIn order to engage in meaningful, long range planning for the future and regulation of development, to deal with changing circumstances and needs in your community, to respond to the requirements of chapter 163 for planning and zoning, you\u2019re required, over time, to keep these things up to date, and these sections of the bill really stand in the way of being able to do that,\u201d said attorney Susan Trevarthen, of Weiss Serota Helfman Cole &amp; Bierman, at the September meeting. Trevarthen represents the village.\nThe bill was presented in the\nlegislative session\nas an emergency management bill. A section of the legislation would strip cities of their powers in one-year increments every time that the local county falls within a hurricane disaster declaration and is within 100 miles of that storm\u2019s track.\nBut SB 180 applies to all land use and planning amendments, regulations or procedures, even if they are not tied or related to hurricanes or other emergencies, according to one of the filings attached to the Bal harbour resolution.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to participate in this, because I can see that it\u2019s tangentially related to the other matter that we are\ndealing with Live Local\nand I don\u2019t think we can sit on the sidelines,\u201d said Bal Harbour Mayor Jeffrey P. Freimark at the Sept. 16 meeting.\nFreimark was referring to the Live Local Act, a state law that incentivizes developers of workforce housing with height, density, tax and parking bonuses. The village has been\ntied up\nin litigation with\nBal Harbour Shops owner\nWhitman Family Development over its planned redevelopment of a portion of the property into a Live Local project.\n",

        "content": "Two months after a gunman killed four people at Rudin Management\u2019s 345 Park Avenue, the City Council introduced a measure that would set minimum wages for security guards and increase training requirements.\nThe Aland Etienne Safety and Security Act, named for one of the security guards killed in the building\u2019s lobby, would set minimum hourly wages and benefits for non-government security guards. The wage floor would have to be at least as much as prevailing wages, which are union-level rates set annually. For unarmed guards in\n2026\n, that rate ranges from $18.02 per hour (plus benefits) to $21.20 (depending on time on the job), and for armed guards, $32.70.\nThe debate over this bill is a familiar one: Union leaders are pushing for a wage floor that building owners and nonunion contractors view as an unlawful market intervention. High wages and benefits means the cost of security would increase for building owners, if they are not already paying for union wages.\nSupporters of the bill, including the building service workers\u2019 union 32BJ SEIU, say the increase in wages and training would improve retention in the industry and therefore, lead to more experienced officers who are better prepared for emergencies. They also emphasize that wages should better reflect the risk of the job.\nOpponents, including the Real Estate Board of New York, counter that the measure undermines labor negotiations and is barred by state law.\nDuring a hearing on Thursday held by the City Council\u2019s Committee on Consumer and Worker Protection, security guards testified about the perils of their jobs. Raven Skinner, who works at 345 Park, recalled that she would often fill in for Etienne when he was on break. She worked an earlier shift the day of the shooting.\n\u201cI was there that day,\u201d she said. \u201cThat could have been me.\u201d\nRachel Paoli, Etienne\u2019s partner, tearfully urged the Council to pass the bill, saying that the measure was a fitting legacy for someone who \u201calways looked after others.\u201d\n\u201cIn his final moments, he tried to protect others by shutting down the elevator to save his coworkers,\u201d she said.\nCity officials\nindicated\nthat Etienne tried to push a panic button to shut down the building\u2019s elevator banks. The gunman, Shane Tamura, was trying to reach the NFL\u2019s headquarters when he mistakenly took the elevator to the 33rd floor, where Rudin has its offices. There, he shot and killed\nJulia Hyman\n, an associate at Rudin, before turning the gun on himself.\nPaoli also spoke about wanting more support for families of security guards, noting that her and Etienne\u2019s seven year-old-son is afraid every time she leaves the house, fearing that, like Etienne, she won\u2019t return safely.\nThrough a spokesperson, Rudin declined to comment on the legislation.\n32BJ President Manny Pastreich pointed to an August\nreport\nby the UC Berkeley Labor Center, which found that New York City\u2019s security services industry had a 77 percent turnover rate in 2024.\n\u201cThis constant churn saps workforce experience and risks undermining public safety in our city,\u201d he said.\nHe said the bill would also ensure an \u201ceven playing field for contractors,\u201d and help lift a predominantly Black and Latino workforce out of poverty. His union represents 20,000 security guards in the city.\nFor nonunion security contractors, that could mean losing the competitive edge they had by offering lower pricing.\nSteve Amitay, executive director of the National Association of Security Companies, which represents private security firms, said the wage requirements would lead to job loss as building owners opt for alternatives, such as security technology or shifting security responsibilities in-house. He noted that clients have limited security budgets.\nThe bill requires the city to approve security guard training schools, which would teach courses related to responding to violence, deescalating interactions with someone suffering from a mental health crisis, first aid and other topics. Amitay said some of the bill\u2019s training requirements duplicate state-mandated instruction and questioned whether they would help avoid incidents like the shooting at 345 Park.\n\u201cThat was a tragedy,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWhen somebody is intending to kill people, and they have an AR-15, and they have malice in their heart, no amount of training is going to be able to stop that.\u201d\nAmitay reiterated this point during Thursday\u2019s hearing, pointing out that Didarul Islam, an off-duty NYPD officer who was killed in the shooting, was highly trained.\nCouncil member Julie Menin, who chairs the Committee on Consumer and Worker Protection, called Amitay\u2019s testimony \u201cinsensitive\u201d and \u201ccallous.\u201d In a back and forth with the Council member, Amitay acknowledged that better pay and training would improve security.\n\u201cYou just contradicted yourself,\u201d Menin said.\nMenin also insisted that the City Council has the authority to set minimum wage standards for the industry.\nThat is another point of contention that could result in litigation if the bill passes.\nREBNY submitted testimony arguing that the city doesn\u2019t have the authority to set its own minimum wage rates. The group also said the measure disrupts negotiations between the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations, which represents building owners, and 32BJ. The parties establish prevailing wages through collective bargaining agreements.\n\u201cBy making the minimum wage for the entire industry equivalent to the collectively-bargained wage rate, the legislation fundamentally undermines the value of collective bargaining and impermissibly intrudes on the collective-bargaining process,\u201d the group stated in written testimony.\nIn the waning days of the Adams administration, the bill seems to have momentum. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, who is sponsoring the bill, said during a press conference on Wednesday that she expects the measure to pass.\n\u201cThe cost of living for folks who would literally die for you and me needs to be addressed,\u201d she said.\nMembers of the administration did not testify at the hearing. Menin highlighted their absence, which she called \u201cshocking and appalling.\u201d\nA City Hall spokesperson did not acknowledge Menin\u2019s comments, but said the administration \u201cdeeply appreciates the critical role that security guards play in maintaining public safety.\u201d The spokesperson also said the legislation \u201cwarrants further review to ensure we fully understand how it aligns with existing state requirements.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Hotel investor Brian Ehrlich and spec home developer Fred Karlton are now looking to add \u201cMiami Beach city commissioner\u201d to their resumes.\nEhrlich, co-founder of Miami Beach-based Paradigm Hotels, is vying against five other candidates for the open seat created by city commissioner Kristen Rosen Gonzalez\u2019s decision to run for\nMiami Beach mayor\n. Among the other contenders is Monique Pardo Pope, an attorney whose late father was a Nazi-sympathizing, serial killer executed in 2012 for murdering nine people.\nEhrlich\u2019s other opponents include historic preservation activist Daniel Ciraldo; realtor Ava Frankel who is using Tik Tok and Instagram to promote her political platform; former Miami Beach city commission aide Monica Matteo-Salinas; and\nLincoln Road\nrestaurant owner Omar Jimenez who has advocated for environmental sustainability in North Beach where he lives.\nPardo Pope, Ciraldo, Matteo-Salinas and Jimenez have each lent tens of thousands of dollars to their individual campaigns, while Ehrlich has raised nearly $165,000 via his individual campaign and Miami Beach in Focus, his political action committee (PAC). Ehrlich\u2019s committee has received more than half of its contributions from other PACs, making it harder to determine the true donors to Miami Beach in Focus, campaign finance reports show.\nIn the other city commission race,\nKarlton\n, who leads Miami Beach-based Karlton Companies, is looking to unseat incumbent city commissioner Laura Dominguez. The race has taken a nasty turn over accusations by Karlton and Miami Beach city commissioner David Suarez that Dominguez repeatedly voted for legislation that benefits developers who have financially supported her campaigns. Karlton is bankrolling his own campaign, while Dominguez is relying heavily on donors, including prominent individuals and companies in real estate and hospitality, according to their campaign financial filings.\nThe race to replace Rosen Gonzalez\nNone of the candidates running for Rosen Gonzalez\u2019s open seat have consolidated support from players in real estate and hospitality, with the exception of Ehrlich, campaign finance reports show. Ehrlich\u2019s individual campaign has received $1,000 each from Arnaud Karsenti, managing principal of Coconut Grove-based development firm\n13th Floor Investments\n, his wife Rebecca Karsenti, the Catalina Hotel at 1732 Collins Avenue, and two entities managed by Miami Beach-based real estate investor\nJimmy Resnick\n.\nEhrlich is the only candidate in both races who is raising money through a PAC in addition to an individual campaign account, documents filed with the city show. His Miami Beach in Focus has raised $109,400 through Oct. 17, according to city records. Nearly a quarter came from Shawn Vardi, who leads Miami Beach-based\nThink Hospitality\n, a firm that owns seven Art Deco Hotels in South Beach. Vardi donated $25,000 to Miami Beach In Focus.\nChristopher Cuomo, ex-COO of Miami Beach-based Groot Hospitality, also donated $5,000 to the committee, campaign finance records show. Groot, led by\nDavid Grutman\n, owns Papi Steak restaurant in the city\u2019s South of Fifth neighborhood, and co-owns Liv nightclub in the Fontainebleau Miami Beach resort. Yet, $67,800 raised by Miami Beach In Focus came from two separate PACs controlled by Christian Ulvert, a Miami-based political consultant who ran former Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber\u2019s campaigns.\nThe individuals donating to Ehrlich\u2019s campaign and PAC believe he has a \u201ccompelling message about revitalizing Miami Beach,\u201d Ehrlich told\nThe Real Deal\n. His ideas include investing public dollars to create more tree canopy and pedestrian friendly improvements to Lincoln Road, Washington Avenue and Collins Avenue, Ehrlich said. \u201cThat is why people are donating to my campaign,\u201d he said.\nAmong the other candidates Ehrlich is battling, only a couple have received campaign contributions from real estate and hospitality interests. Matteo-Salinas has raised $63,126, including $38,000 that she lent to her campaign, financial reports show. Individual donors who gave her the maximum contribution of $1,000 include longtime LGBTQ nightclub Twist and its owner Joel David Stedman. Ocean Drive bar Mango\u2019s Tropical Cafe contributed $500 to Matteo-Salinas.\nPardo Pope had a little better luck tapping real estate and hospitality donors. Her campaign received $1,000 each from\nAlex Kleyner\n, a real estate investor who lives in Miami Beach; Julie Grimes, managing partner of the Hilton Bentley Hotel South Beach; and\nChris Paciello\n, another Miami Beach real estate investor who owns the Anatomy fitness club chain. Four affiliates of New York-based\nInfinity Real Estate\n, which recently acquired an Alton Road assemblage from Michael Shvo, donated a combined $4,000 to Pardo Pope.\nLast month, Pardo Pope\u2019s campaign gained notoriety after Miami filmmaker and civic activist Billy Corben posted a short video on his Because Miami social media accounts about Pardo Pope\u2019s father. A former police officer, Manuel Pardo was convicted in the 1980s of murdering nine people. During his trial, prosecutors presented evidence that Pardo collected Nazi memorabilia, idolized Adolf Hitler and had a swastika-tattooed dog.\nHis final words before dying by lethal injection in 2012 were, \u201cAirborne forever. I love you, Michi baby,\u201d referring to his daughter, who was four years old when Pardo committed his crimes, published reports state.\nKarlton sets scope on Dominguez\nIn the race to keep her seat, Dominguez is taking fire from\nKarlton\nand city commissioner Suarez. Dominguez was elected three years ago in a special election to serve out the term of the late Mark Samuelian, her life partner who died on June 22, 2022 from an undisclosed illness. She was also Samuelian\u2019s campaign manager and treasurer.\nKarlton and Suarez have hammered Dominguez over her ties to real estate developers and investors who have come before the city commission for project approvals since she took office. At a candidates\u2019 forum this month, Dominguez was caught on video ripping away the microphone from Karlton when he was rattling off the names of real estate individuals and entities who donated to Coastal Communities Matter, a PAC that supported Dominguez in 2022.\nFor instance, Nomade Lido, the entity that owns the The Standard Spa, Miami Beach hotel, donated $10,000 to Coastal Communities on Sept. 20, 2022, campaign finance reports show. The hotel\u2019s investors include billionaire Barry Sternlicht, star architect Bjarke Ingels, and Nomade People CEO Miguel Isla. Dominguez recently sponsored legislation to rezone The Standard Spa, Miami Beach that would have paved the way for a major renovation of the hotel.\nLast month, Dominguez pulled the item indefinitely at Isla\u2019s request due to controversy over\nNomade Lido\nagreeing to pay $1.2 million to a nonprofit created by the Belle Isle Residents Association in exchange for the association\u2019s support. Dominguez lives in Belle Isle.\nCoastal Communities Matter also received $10,000 on Sept. 12, 2022 from two affiliates of Location Ventures, the defunct Coral Gables firm founded by disgraced developer Rishi Kapoor. A year later, Dominguez was among six city commission members, including then-Mayor Dan Gelber, who voted to approve an ordinance on first reading that would have allowed co-living units on Washington Avenue between 15th and 16th streets where\nLocation Ventures\nwas under contract to buy two commercial properties. Kapoor\u2019s firm lobbied for the change, city records show. The legislation died when Location Ventures shut down in 2024.\nKarlton, who also donated $2,500 to Coastal Communities in 2022, told\nTRD\nthat he is a former Dominguez supporter. \u201cShe turned out to be a special interest candidate,\u201d Karlton said. \u201cShe talked about quality of life when she was running, and then she started voting for every high-rise. She has not voted against any of the projects and has sponsored nine of them.\u201d\nKarlton\u2019s campaign finance reports show he has raised $150,000, all of which he donated himself. \u201cI don\u2019t take donations,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to owe anybody any favors.\u201d\nIn a recent newsletter to his constituents bearing the city of Miami Beach seal, commissioner Suarez stumped against Dominguez.\n\u201cLaura Dominguez has a long history of dirty politics,\u201d Suarez wrote. \u201cMost politicians tell voters what they want to hear, smile during campaign season, then work behind the scenes for special interests. And when confronted with the truth, they lash out and play the victim.\u201d\nFor this election, Coastal Communities has not raised any funds, campaign finance reports show. Its last reported contribution occurred in October of last year when Big Easy Casino, a parimutuel gambling site owned by billionaire developer\nJeffrey Soffer\n, gave $3,000. Soffer also owns the Fontainebleau Miami Beach resort.\nFor her individual campaign, Dominguez has raised $310,628, with many real estate and hospitality bigwigs donating the maximum $1,000 each, including developer Michael Shvo; Jose and Diego Ardid, developers who lead Miami-based Key International; New York-based LeFrak Organization\u2019s managing director James LeFrak and a LeFrak affiliate; and two executives with Vlad Doronin\u2019s\nOKO Group\n. Other $1,000 contributors are restaurants Big Pink, Prime 112 and Ocean\u2019s Ten.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to have the support of local residents and small business owners in our city who share my vision and commitment to a neighborhood and residents first agenda,\u201d Dominguez told\nTRD\nin a statement. \u201cThose are reflected in my report and reinforce why our community and residents believe in my campaign.\u201d\nShe also accused Suarez of feeding misinformation to Karlton and Miami Beach voters. \u201cI have been attacked by a sitting commissioner who is using the city seal to influence an election,\u201d Dominguez said. \u201cHe takes a kernel of truth and then lies about it. Everything he does is misleading to the public.\u201d\nIn a statement, Suarez doubled down on his criticisms, saying Dominguez has \u201cvoted for every major upzoning since taking office, sponsoring more than 80 percent of them, and taking campaign or PAC money from over half the developers involved.\u201d\n\u201cShe was even caught on tape coaching developers on how to sneak their 400-foot towers through during low-turnout elections,\u201d Suarez said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a \u2018kernel of truth\u2019 (as she says), it\u2019s the whole cornfield of corruption.\u201d",

        "content": "A New York investment firm is doubling down on suburban Chicago retail.\nKPR Centers\nacquired Pointe Plaza, a 195,000-square-foot shopping center in north suburban\nNiles\nat 5660 West Touhy Avenue, for $40 million, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nCBRE brokers Richard Frolik, George Good and Christian Williams represented the seller, San Francisco-based Stockbridge. The price amounts to $205 per square foot. The center was built in 1999.\nThe deal marks KPR\u2019s second Chicago-area retail acquisition, following its 2021 purchase of\nSchaumburg\nCorners, and adds to a national buying spree that\u2019s scooped up more than a dozen centers over the past 20 months.\nA thin development pipeline and surging tenant demand, combined with sustained consumer buying habits, has turned\nretail real estate\n, long out of favor with investors, into a darling asset class.\nStill, the sale price reflects the bite of higher interest rates: Stockbridge paid $50.3 million for Pointe Plaza in 2014, meaning KPR picked up the property at a roughly 20 percent discount.\nThe shopping center is 94 percent leased, according to KPR. Anchors include Fresh Farms, Ross Dress for Less, dd\u2019s Discounts and Daiso, alongside more than 20 other retailers and restaurants.\nKPR COO Andrew Frank said the firm plans to aggressively lease the center\u2019s two vacancies with tenants that would complement the roster.\nRetail fundamentals continue to perform. National shopping center vacancy is about 4 percent, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers, with leasing activity surpassing pre-pandemic levels and rents climbing amid constrained supply.\nKPR owns and manages more than 10 million square feet of retail space across 20 states. Pointe Plaza likely fits its strategy of targeting well-located suburban centers.\nElsewhere in Niles, the Sterling Organization has a $440 million redevelopment of the\nGolf Mill Shopping Center\nin the works, one of several suburban Chicago malls poised for dramatic and costly transformations.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

It\u2019s also across Page Mill Road from Tesla\u2019s global engineering headquarters at 3000 Hanover Street.\nThe expansion comes as xAI seeks to fill more than 250 job openings. xAI owns X, Musk\u2019s social media site formerly known as Twitter, as well as the ChatGPT rival chatbot Grok. And it might not be done expanding just yet, as it is still seeking space in Palo Alto, sources told the outlet.\nMusk moved corporate operations for Tesla, X and SpaceX to Texas in recent years, but those firms still have significant presences in the Bay Area.

        "content": "Violent crime in downtown\nDallas\nis down more than 16 percent this year \u2014 a turnaround city and business leaders credit to a coordinated safety push aimed at restoring confidence in the urban core.\nDowntown Dallas Inc shared the numbers at its annual State of Downtown event this week at the Thompson Hotel, where the organization\u2019s president Jennifer Scripps and Police Chief Daniel Comeaux highlighted progress made through the \u201cSafe in the City\u201d initiative, launched in May to address concerns about public safety as major\ntenants reassess their downtown space\n.\nThe initiative raised more than $2.5 million, including $1.5 million from Communities Foundation of Texas, $500,000 from the Dallas Regional Chamber, $400,000 from the Dallas Citizens Council and $100,000 from the Hoblitzelle Foundation. The money has gone toward expanding patrols and bolstering quality-of-life programs.\nDowntown now has more than 120 police officers assigned to the district, up from 90 a year ago.\n\u201cWe have to be more present,\u201d Comeaux said, a New Orleans native who previously served with the Houston Police Department. \u201cWhen people see the police, they tend to do less.\u201d\nComeaux said traffic enforcement has also been a focus: within 30 days of ramping up the effort, officers issued 400 tickets, an illustration they said of how \u201cout of control\u201d things had become.\nWhether the public safety efforts sway some big employers to hang onto their downtown offices remains to be seen, or if other factors weigh heavier on their decision-making processes.\nAT&amp;T\nis searching for office space in the suburbs, despite spending $100 million to develop a four-block headquarters campus that included the AT&amp;T Discovery District seven years ago.\nAT&amp;T holds a 1.1 million-square-foot lease at the 37-story Whitacre Tower, at 208 South Akard Street in downtown\nDallas\n, through 2030. The telecom giant has been expanding in suburban areas such as Richardson in recent years, with over 400 employees officing away from downtown.\nDDI data also showed a 27 percent drop in quality-of-life violations such as public sleeping, panhandling and disorderly conduct. The group reported that it rehoused more than 250 people who had been living in downtown encampments.\nComeaux said Dallas police are preparing to implement a drone-first response system to cut down on emergency response times and improve community trust. He also touted recruitment momentum, noting that DPD recently launched its second-largest police academy class with 77 cadets \u2014 a rare achievement compared to other parts of the country as departments nationwide struggle to fill ranks.\nWith\nDallas\ngearing up to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup and a $3 billion redo of the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center, Comeaux said the department\u2019s focus is maintaining public safety for major events and residents alike.\n\u201cThis year, we\u2019ve retained more officers than any year recently,\u201d Comeaux said. \u201cIt\u2019s coming from morale \u2014 and culture.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The city has tapped Douglaston Development and Kinwood Partners to build a 590-unit residential building at the\nGansevoort Meat Market\nsite.\nThe city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation issued a request for proposals for the site in January, seeking developers for a 10,000-square-foot lot at the corner of Little West 12th Street and 10th Avenue in the Meatpacking District.\nUp to 55 percent of the apartments will be set aside as affordable, though the income levels have not yet been finalized. The development team intends to apply for the property tax break 485x; as a result, at least 25 percent of those apartments will need to be affordable, on average, to those earning 60 percent of the area median income. The developers, however, will not seek other city subsidies.\nSteven Charno, president of Douglaston, said in an interview that the building\u2019s market-rate units will subsidize the affordable ones. The development team is also not paying for the land, instead taking over the site through a 99-year ground lease and paying a nominal fee.\nIn an interview, EDC President and CEO Andrew Kimball said the developers were selected in part for their \u201ctrack record for delivering high-quality developments.\u201d Douglaston, a seasoned affordable housing builder, brought on Kinwood as an emerging developer, Douglaston\u2019s Jed Resnick said. The city\u2019s RFP encouraged teams to include \u201cemerging developers,\u201d defined as firms that have developed less than $30 million worth of projects, built fewer than 150 residential units and taken on fewer than 10 projects in as many years.\nKinwood fits the bill, but its founder comes with industry experience. David Himmel, who was chief operating officer at Jamestown and hails from a well-established real estate family, recently launched Kinwood (in fact, state records show the firm was registered this month).\nKimball said the city received more than 10 applications for the project.\nThe Promote\nnewsletter was first to report that the city selected Douglaston.\nThe housing development is part of a broader redevelopment plan, dubbed Gansevoort Square, that includes expanding the Whitney Museum. EDC estimates that the plan will create 3,700 construction jobs, 160 permanent positions and have a $1.1 billion economic impact\nThe site of the residential portion of the project is home to a two-story building, the district\u2019s\nlast meatpacking\nplant. The Gansevoort Meat Market cut a\n$31 million\ndeal with the city last year to end its lease, set to expire at the end of 2032, to make way for the redevelopment.\nThe tower that will rise in the meatpacking plant\u2019s place has drawn criticism from local Council member Erik Bottcher, who\nexpressed\nconcerns about the proposed project\u2019s height. Previous reports pegged the tower at 600 feet, but the development team and EDC said such details will be finalized when the site, which needs to be rezoned for housing use, goes through the city\u2019s land use review process. The city expects to begin that the rezoning process in early 2027.\nThe local Council member\u2019s sway over what happens on the site will likely hinge on whether the\nhousing ballot measures\nare approved next week.\n",

Paramount Group\u2019s head of real estate Peter Brindley will receive $12.3 million, and Ermelinda Berberi, Paramount\u2019s CFO and treasurer, will receive $4.4 million.\nParamount reached a deal in September to sell the company to Rithm Capital for $1.6 billion, or $6.60 per share. The deal still needs shareholder approval to close.\nBehler has been the CEO of Paramount Group since 1991. He spearheaded Paramount through its $2.3 billion initial public offering in 2014, which at the time was the largest IPO for a U.S. REIT. Paramount controls 13 million square feet of office space in New York and San Francisco.\nBut in recent years, Paramount\u2019s stock has underperformed its peers. Behler also generated headlines for his lavish perks and bizarre decision-making.\nEarlier this year, Paramount revealed it made millions of dollars in payments to Behler\u2019s personal companies and interests. The previously undisclosed payments included $3 million to a private jet company, of which Behler had a 50 percent stake, and $900,000 for Behler\u2019s personal accounting services.\nIn July, Paramount reported that it was under an SEC investigation related to disclosures for related-party transactions, conflicts of interest and executive compensation.\nThe Real Deal\nalso discovered Behler\npushed\nfor a no-bid security contract for 60 Wall Street, a 1.6 million-square-foot vacant office building, to Guardian Services, according to sources and communications reviewed by\nTRD\n. Behler\u2019s ex-girlfriend worked at Guardian and the two maintained friendly relations since their relationship officially ended.\nAt least one text between Behler and the employee, reviewed by TRD, revealed plans to meet up at Eric Ripert\u2019s Michelin-starred restaurant, Le Bernardin.\nOn September 9, 2019, Behler texted the employee: \u201cHow are you? Hope all well. Talk tomorrow?\u201d\nHer: \u201cYes please \ud83d\ude42 call me anytime xoxo\u201d\nAB: \u201ctime for lunch?\u201d\nHer: \u201cThat will be so nice to see you. Yes I am available.\u201d\nAB: \u201c12:30 le Bernadin lounge.\u201d\nHer: \u201cPerfect.\u201d\nMost of Behler\u2019s \u201cgolden parachute\u201d is based upon existing employee agreements in the event of a change in control.\nParamount\u2019s board of directors approved a $1.1 million retention bonus for Behler to stay on during the transition period.\nParamount declined to comment.\n",

        "content": "When a process doesn\u2019t work, people find a way around it \u2014 legal or not.\nHousing court is an example, but first, another one. Trigger warning: It\u2019s about immigration.\nFor some desperate people, the benefits of moving to the U.S. are great, but the chances of immigrating legally are small, and it takes years just to get an answer. So they sneak in, or overstay their visa.\nFor the same reason, some New York landlords change the locks rather than go to housing court to evict someone \u2014 especially someone who\u2019s not on the lease. Housing court could be a two-year slog, cost thousands of dollars in legal fees and result in the squatter being allowed to stay. A lock-out often prompts the occupants to disappear.\nThe rule of thumb is to secure the apartment. Make all the moral judgments you want, but the basic economics are undeniable: If a risk justifies the reward, some people will take it.\nGothamist just ran a piece about lockouts. It featured Joan Rodriguez, who in 2018 moved into an income-restricted two-bedroom apartment in the Hub, Steiner NYC\u2019s luxury building at\n333 Schermerhorn Street\nin Downtown Brooklyn, to take care of Tina Ann Williams, the disabled sister of her incarcerated then-fianc\u00e9.\nRodriguez had not won a housing lottery for the affordable unit \u2014 for which there\u2019s a long waiting list of families seeking two-bedrooms \u2014 and she was not on the lease.\nIn 2022, Williams died. The next day, the landlord changed the locks. Rodriguez somehow got keys and moved back in, but two weeks later she was locked out again. She was homeless for three years before an appeals court \u2014 reversing a judge\u2019s decision \u2014 ruled last summer that she had to be let back in until her right to occupancy is decided.\nThe landlord told Gothamist that Rodriguez will get a lease if the city approves her rental voucher.\nRodriguez\u2019s lawyer told the publication that judges have been ruling against locked-out occupants with uncertain rights to an apartment. That suggests that most lockouts are of people who don\u2019t have a right to be there.\nThe question is whether to change the locks or take your chances in housing court. Both choices carry risks. A functioning court system would surely help.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat New York firms will send\nletters of interest\nabout becoming master developer for the Trump administration\u2019s Penn Station overhaul? Amtrak said Thursday it has hired Hunton Andrews Kurth as the project\u2019s legal adviser, KPMG as financial adviser and AKRF as environmental consultant. The project is on schedule to break ground by the end of 2027, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said. Send predictions to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: One reason to return a security deposit is that your tenant might one day become an important government official. Micah Lasher had to sue his first landlord, the notorious Steve Croman, to get his deposit back. Lasher went on to become Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s policy director and is now an Assembly member. He\u2019s also the favorite to succeed Rep. Jerry Nadler.\nLasher\ntold the story\nat a press conference about\ntenant harassment legislation\n, according to\nTRD\nreporter Lilah Burke. Lasher and his roommates won a judgment in small claims court, but Croman still didn\u2019t pay. So they went to put a lien on Croman\u2019s bank accounts. Croman\u2019s people then agreed to pay if Lasher vacated the order so there would be no record of the decision.\nElsewhere\u2026\nWe don\u2019t normally report awards, but there\u2019s a side story to the mixed-use project at 37 Hillside Avenue in Inwood, which just won an\nAmerican Architecture Award\nin the social housing category.\nThe development team (RiseBoro Community Partnership, Coconut Properties, Architecture in Formation, SLCE Architects and others) planned to build a sister project next door at the same time, but the affordable Mitchell-Lama co-op never returned a signed contract after shareholders agreed to sell an empty lot for $7.3 million.\nThe co-op\u2019s reasons remain unknown, and the parcel remains empty. If you missed my story about that, it\u2019s\nhere\n.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$7.75 million\nfor a 3,600-square-foot two-family house at 14 Bank Street in the West Village. Matthew Pravda, Matthew Lipsky and Matthew Lesser with Leslie Garfield\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$173 million\nfor 757 Third Avenue, which was handed back from BGO to New York Life Real Estate Investors via a deed in lieu of foreclosure.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$12.6 million\nfor a 3,811-square-foot condominium unit at The Henry, 211 West 84th Street on the Upper West Side. Alexa Lambert with Compass has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 31,885-square-foot, 8-story mixed-use property at 394 New Lots Avenue in East New York. Jonathan Imani with IMC Architecture filed the permit on behalf of Moshe Nachum.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Father-daughter-duo Frank and Bella Campise are bringing their apartment tour app to thousands of college apartments.\nBella Campise had the idea for the app, Aigentless, which allows prospective tenants to follow self -guided tours of apartments without an agent, while she was searching for an apartment as a student at Northwestern.\nThe app\u2019s reach is about to expand from its base of 30,000 units to more than 80,000 units after signing on student housing firm Cardinal Group as a client. The Denver-based developer, owner and operator of student housing holds a 53,000-unit portfolio with about 100,000 beds.\nWorking with student-housing providers was a natural step in the company\u2019s progression, Bella Campise said. It wasn\u2019t long after she pitched the concept to her father, managing principal of JAB Real Estate, that she dropped out of school to get the app up and running.\nA year later, the company has 20 employees and has raised $2 million in pre-seed funding.\n\u201cThe younger consumer is also more used to, not only using an app, but also AI-native interactions,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are seeing a lot of utilization of the AI chat function specifically within students, but the product works and converts across different asset classes and geographies.\u201d\nThe appeal comes from prospective tenants\u2019 ability to book a tour on their own schedule rather than coordinating with an agent and to take in information about the property without the pressure of a hard sell. They receive an access code to a lockbox and can tour the property on their own time, including after work hours, while following a tour on the app.\nThat still involves a human touch. Prospective tenants have the option to contact agents through the app and work with property managers to secure a lease if they\u2019re interested in moving in.\nFrom the property owner\u2019s perspective, Frank Campise said it allows him to lease up a building more quickly and collect feedback from prospective tenants who are more comfortable sharing unfiltered opinions.\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s just you and the app, you can be more transparent, and we\u2019re going to get more honest feedback,\u201d Frank Campise said. \u201cAnd that feedback is going to be empirical. It\u2019s not based on [the agent\u2019s] memory.\u201d\nFrank Campise\u2019s JAB Real Estate, which he runs with Jim Jann, has been a longstanding player in Chicago real estate.\nLast year, the company scored a deal in the buzzy West Loop and paid $34.5 million to Chicago-based Waterton for the 81-unit midrise at 20 North Aberdeen. The price was about $5 million less than the seller paid to purchase it in 2017, according to Cook County records\nAmid a tight debt market, JAB has remained a dealmaker in Chicago. In 2023, the company sold a 56-unit Lincoln Park apartment building at 656 West Wrightwood Avenue for $14 million to Bill Silverstein\u2019s firm Beal Properties. A year prior, JAB paid $23 million for a Lincoln Park apartment complex that Campise had his eye on purchasing for two decades.\nThat same building, the 159-unit Hamden Court Apartments, was one of the first properties the Campises used to test out Aigentless.\n\u201cThe Aigentless tours did 70 percent of the leasing, and our live agents only did the other 30 percent,\u201d Frank Campise said.\nThe partnership was a natural continuation of Bella Campise\u2019s interest in the family business, she said. Her first experience with the company was helping her father with a condo deconversion while she was a freshman in high school.\n\u201cFrank and I had been doing walks around to look at properties since I was really young,\u201d Bella Campise said. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re both real estate nerds.\u201d",

        "content": "Marc Calabria\u2019s big\nresidential ambitions\nfor the Loop include scooping up another downtown landmark out of distress.\nA venture led by Calabria paid $4.2 million this month for the eight-story historic building at 401 South State Street, according to Cook County property records first\nreported\nby Costar.\nThe price is a steep markdown from the $68.1 million the building fetched in 2016, meaning the 484,800 office tower went for about $140 per square foot nine years ago and $8.65 per square foot today.\nDesigned by architect William Le Baron Jenney \u2014 widely credited as the father of the skyscraper \u2014 the 1891 building was a Siegel, Cooper &amp; Co department store and later housed Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co for decades. It\u2019s been designated a national and Chicago landmark for nearly half a century, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield, which marketed the property via auction on behalf of special servicer CWCapital.\nRobert Morris University\nwas the last tenant, occupying the entire building until 2020, when it merged with Roosevelt University and exited the space. The property subsequently fell into default on $47.8 million in CMBS debt, and the lender took title more than two years before hiring brokers Kelsey Berry, Cody Hundertmark, Hunter Moss and Jeremiah Olsen to sell it.\nCalabria, who heads Bloomingdale-based IMC Accounting &amp; Tax, didn\u2019t respond to the outlet\u2019s request for comment, and his plans for the building are unclear. But his nearby project may offer a clue: He\u2019s partnering with Chicago\u2019s Primera Group to convert much of the 41-story\nClark Adams Building\nat 105 West Adams Street into roughly 400 apartments, a redevelopment backed by nearly $68 million in city financing.\nThat proposal is part of Chicago\u2019s initiative to bring more affordable housing and mixed uses to the Loop\u2019s office-heavy core, particularly along State Street. The\nClark Adams\nplan recently cleared a key step toward landmark designation despite ongoing legal disputes involving the property.\nAt 401 South State, Calabria inherits a full-block site at the southern edge of the Loop, between Van Buren Street and Ida B. Wells Drive. The sale also includes an adjacent mechanical structure. A 2023 study by the Urban Land Institute, the Chicago Loop Alliance and the city identified potential reuse options for the property, from apartments to an athletic complex.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Hines sees fields of master-planned communities blooming on the\nwestern edge of Fort Worth\n.\nThe Houston-based global real estate giant is setting its sights on a 1,476-acre development that could reshape the city\u2019s growth along the Parker County line. The firm began talks with Fort Worth officials about a potential development agreement for Brown Ranch, a vast tract in the city\u2019s extraterritorial jurisdiction, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nHines declined to comment on specifics, but the proposal signals the firm\u2019s ambitions to extend Fort Worth\u2019s suburban frontier west of its fast-growing\nWalsh Ranch corridor\n.\nFort Worth is weighing an agreement that would allow Hines to create a\nmunicipal utility district\n, or MUD, to finance infrastructure for the project. MUDs \u2014 once used primarily in rural areas \u2014 have become a common tool for developers building large-scale suburban communities, helping cover the steep costs of roads, utilities and other essentials via property taxes and assessments paid in part by new residents on the debt service of the infrastructure.\nUnder the proposed terms, Hines would help fund connections to\nWalsh Ranch\nParkway and Old Weatherford Road, while giving the city the right and obligation to provide water and sewer services. The plan also calls for a mix of residential, commercial and open-space uses, aligning with Fort Worth\u2019s long-term annexation and land-use goals.\nCity Council recently approved a similar agreement with\nGreen Brick Partners\nfor the 858-acre Shelton Ranch project in north Fort Worth. The Hines pact hasn\u2019t yet been scheduled for a vote, but council member Michael Crain signaled support, saying the city should stay proactive in shaping its western expansion.\nHines manages $91.8 billion in assets and oversees 156 active developments worldwide. Brown Ranch would mark the firm\u2019s next big move in\nNorth Texas\n. Earlier this year, the firm sold seven DFW master-planned communities to Starwood Capital Group in an $800 million deal.\nThe proposed project joins a growing roster of mega-developments transforming Fort Worth\u2019s outskirts \u2014 including the $5.1 billion Carver Ranch and $5 billion\nCole Ranch\nin\nDenton County\n.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Apartment construction is booming in South Florida, even though the market is past its pandemic-era leasing and rent peak.\n\u201cDevelopers are still very bullish on the Miami story,\u201d said Juan Arias, a national director at CoStar Group. \u201cYou have a lot [to be completed] in 2027 and 2028.\u201d\nAfter Covid\u2019s onset, out-of-staters rushed to South Florida, driving unprecedented demand, rent growth and a building spree that created a\nsupply overhang\n. A record 18,600 units were completed last year, outpacing 15,000 net new leases, just as the influx of Northeasterners and West Coasters slowed and many who weathered the pandemic here moved\nback home\n. Median asking rents in the tri-county region decreased 3 percent last month, year-over-year, according to Realtor.com.\nYet, developers are continuing construction like it\u2019s 2021, casting doubt on future lease-ups and rent growth, and threatening to prolong the supply overhang, experts warn.\nThe pandemic-era strong fundamentals have slowed, according to Arias. \u201cThat presents a significant headwind for the amount of multifamily getting built,\u201d he said.\nIn the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30, construction started on 14,515 apartments in South Florida, according to data from CoStar. This outpaces the 13,338 starts in the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30 of last year, and also the 14,464 starts during the same period of 2021, the data shows. It\u2019s also not far behind the 14,980 starts in the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30 2023. Yet, it far lags the peak 22,296 starts in the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30 2022.\n\u201cThe assumption is net deliveries are going to continue to outpace demand through 2027 for luxury properties,\u201d Arias said, adding that this \u201cmay be a little bit optimistic.\u201d It \u201ccould get worse.\u201d\nDevelopers are unfazed. By the time they finish towers, they believe demand will return and leasing will be robust. They say they\u2019re picking submarkets that will have appeal and need housing, and are adding amenities to draw tenants.\nYet, it takes an average of a year and a half to two years to stabilize a new project, much longer than the six-month lease-ups during the market bonanza, experts say. This means buildings finished next year will compete with those finished this year, and towers finished in 2027 will compete with those completed next year.\n\u201cIt gets sandwiched, so you won\u2019t see these properties lease up in 16 months,\u201d said Andrew Rahman, of property manager Crown Residential. \u201cIt will take much longer than that, and they are not going to see the results they want.\u201d\nTop of the market\nMost construction is of four- and five-star apartments, mostly in prime submarkets, according to Arias of CoStar.\nOf the total 26,502 units under construction, nearly 60 percent are in coveted neighborhoods east of I-95, and nearly a quarter are in downtown Miami and Miami\u2019s Arts &amp; Entertainment District, Brickell and Edgewater, CoStar data shows.\nThey\u2019re asking top rents that target specific demographics: well-heeled Miamians, many of whom work for the new-to-market companies, and out-of-state transplants, who often retain higher paying jobs outside of Florida. (Miami-Dade County\u2019s median income is $87,200, less than New York\u2019s $103,000, Los Angeles\u2019 $106,600 and Cook County\u2019s $119,900, according to HUD.)\nAlready, these high-end apartments have a vacancy of 13.4 percent, more than South Florida\u2019s average vacancy of 10.2 percent, CoStar data shows.\n\u201cA lot of the out-of-staters who want to go to Miami \u2026 that has slowed down and the amount of construction occurring in those particular markets is something we want to stay away from,\u201d said developer Robert Suris. \u201cWe feel those markets have a lot of inventory delivering.\u201d\nFuture in-migration will be key.\nSteve Ross, who started West Palm Beach-based\nRelated Ross\n, and Ken Griffin, who moved his\nCitadel and Citadel Securities\nto Brickell are prompting smaller firms to move to South Florida and bring employees who will lease, optimists said.\n\u201cIt used to be in Miami, your largest tenants were law firms. Now we are seeing different tenants we haven\u2019t seen in the past,\u201d said developer Dan Kodsi.\nBut Trump\u2019s immigration policies threaten South Florida population growth, Arias said.\nIn the first three quarters of this year, 13,693 people from abroad moved to Miami-Dade County, marking a 66 percent decrease, year-over-year, according to the Miami Association of Realtors, which based its analysis on driver\u2019s license exchanges. It marked a 63 percent decrease from 2023, 49 percent decrease from 2022, 14.7 percent decrease from 2021 and 30 percent decrease from 2019.\nMore than 2,050 Colombians; 1,600 Cubans and 970 Venezuelans exchanged their licenses in the first three quarters of this year, a decline from each of the past four years, the data shows.\nIn Doral, home to a large Venezuelan community, some with varying legal statuses, including Temporary Protected Status, are\nmoving\nto Europe for fear of deportation, leaving some apartment buildings with vacancies of 10 percent or higher.\nA number of Ukrainians, who also are eligible for TPS, and Russians broke their leases early at some of Estate\u2019s buildings, Suris said.\n\u201cThere has been a flight of even wealthier [people] that don\u2019t have immigration status that were renters of higher-end multifamily,\u201d he said. \u201cImmigration policy has affected the market for sure.\u201d\nNew York City\u2019s mayoral election could counter this. If Zohran Mamdani, whose anti-Israel stance and calls for higher taxes have prompted\nanxiety\n, wins, more New Yorkers could head south.\n\u201cPeople are counting on a huge growth in population if Mamdani gets elected, exceeding what happened during the pandemic,\u201d said Tal Frydman, of Newmark.\nAt the same time, homeownership remains out of reach for many, despite a slight drop in prices and mortgage rates. That\u2019s a boon for apartment buildings.\n\u201cIt\u2019s moving people from choosing to buy to being forced to rent. A lot of those are renters by choice, especially in the four- and five-star buildings,\u201d said Eli Beracha, a Florida International University real estate professor. \u201cThey can afford to rent, but they don\u2019t have enough for a down payment.\u201d\nGen Zers are inclined to pay higher rents in exchange for top buildings, market optimists said, pointing to Edgewater\u2019s\nForma Miami\n. Completed last year, it\u2019s 97 percent leased, despite rents reaching $7.70 a square foot, higher than the $3.19 a square foot average for top Miami-Dade units.\nSimilarly, Coral Gables\u2019 multifamily market is roughly 95 percent leased, partly due to\nFIFA\nopening an office in the city. But some staff are hired temporarily for the 2026 World Cup.\n\u201cWhat happens when these [people] move out?\u201d said Rahman of Crown Residential, referring to well-heeled employees. \u201cYou are going to see a slight drop\u201d in occupancy, he said.\nHollywood is particularly strained with the supply overhang, he added. Concessions abound: Tenants could get two months rent free at the 362-unit Bread Building; three months rent free and a $1,500 gift card at the 180-unit Griffin 441; and two months rent free and a $2,000 gift card at the 324-unit Hollywood Heights, according to their websites. All were completed last year.\n\u201cNo market that\u2019s not a bloodbath is offering two-and-a-half months free and gift cards,\u201d Rahman said. \u201cAll are trying to fight for the same [prospective tenants]. Unless there\u2019s a huge spike in population, and we\u2019re talking a tremendous spike, this is going to spill into 2028.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not stopping Calta Group from planning to start construction early next year of a pair of apartment buildings with\n251 units\n, combined, near Hollywood\u2019s Young Circle. They are expected to be completed in mid-2027.\nWill demand rise?\n\u201cDemand will definitely pick up by then,\u201d said Calta\u2019s Gaetano Caltagirone, adding that impending openings of retail, dining and a Brightline stop will drive demand. \u201cMiami is becoming extremely expensive. It\u2019s important to have these alternatives of living 10-15 minutes away from downtown Miami.\u201d\nThe current multifamily slowdown started about 10 months ago and will turn around, said real estate attorney Dennis Eisinger. But when?\n\u201cThat could be another two or four or five years. \u2026 Have the developers overbuilt? Yes,\u201d said Eisinger, of Eisinger Law. \u201cDevelopers just by nature are, \u2018Hey I am a developer, I see the future, and I know I can start now because in two years when my building is ready, I\u2019lll be good.\u2019\u201d\nAs a whole, South Florida\u2019s multifamily market remains healthier, benefiting from its ever-present appealing climate, coastal access and lack of a state income tax, developers and analysts said.\n\u201cOurs is a little bit of a slowdown, a minor downturn. It might be going down more before it goes back up,\u201d Eisinger said. \u201cLet\u2019s hope developers don\u2019t kill the market by overbuilding.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Keystone Development + Investment scored a $62 million loan for its office-to-residential conversions at two buildings near Dadeland Mall, a rare retrofit in South Florida.\nOffice-to-residential conversions took hold in the Northeast, especially in New York, in recent years, marking new chapters for the towers struggling with higher vacancy due to the growth of hybrid work. The adaptation is less common in South Florida, where the office market boomed during a pandemic-era influx of companies.\nIn the only known South Florida project, Keystone plans to create\n212 apartments\n, combined, at the seven-story building at 9400 South Dadeland Boulevard and the eight-story building at 9500 South Dadeland Boulevard in unincorporated Miami-Dade County. The properties are in the Dadeland area of\nKendall\n.\nUniondale, New York-based Arbor Realty Trust, through an affiliate, provided the $62 million loan, records show. Keystone recorded a notice of construction commencement five days after the financing closed.\nThe 145,400-square-foot building at 9400 South Dadeland Boulevard will be converted into 121 apartments, and the 113,100-square-foot building at 9500 South Dadeland Boulevard into 91 apartments, according to Keystone\u2019s project filings to Miami-Dade and a company representative who spoke with\nThe Real Deal\nin May. They are expected to be completed next year.\nBoth buildings were built in the early 1980s, according to LoopNet.\nThe conversions are part of Keystone\u2019s larger\nHyve\nproject on its 8.3-acre site now home to an office complex with a pair of garages. After the conversions, the firm plans a 25-story, 219-unit apartment tower in place of one of the existing garages.\nDespite South Florida\u2019s office market fortunes, fueled by unprecedented leasing by new-to-market firms and record rents, some landlords have felt the sting from higher interest rates and hybrid work. Instead of retrofitting the buildings, they\u2019re\nbulldozing\nthem to make way for new projects.\nAfter logistics company Ryder System left its former headquarters campus at 11690 Northwest 105th Street in unincorporated Miami-Dade, Bridge Industrial bought the site and plans a 330,000-square-foot industrial redevelopment with\ntwo warehouses\n. Ryder moved its headquarters to a smaller space at 2333 Ponce de Leon Boulevard in Coral Gables, citing the hybrid work shift.\nIn Boca Raton, BH Group, Pebb Enterprises and the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group plan to replace an existing office building at the Office Depot headquarters campus with an eight-story,\n500-unit\napartment building. Two other office buildings at the campus at 6600 North Military Trail that are primarily leased to Office Depot will remain.",

        "content": "For the first time in more than two decades,\nSan Francisco\n\u2019s Presidio is getting a new apartment complex.\nThe Presidio Trust\nis planning a 196-unit, six-building residential complex on a 4.6-acre site once occupied by the Army\u2019s Letterman General Hospital in the 60-acre district,\u00a0 the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. The six-building property will replace a\nparking lot\nand two structures at Lincoln Boulevard and Girard Road.\nThe project is part of the Presidio Trust\u2019s push to boost revenue and add smaller apartments to a housing portfolio that\u2019s 97 percent occupied and dominated by large family units.\nThe Presidio\u2019s 1,400 homes currently generate about 35 percent of the park\u2019s operating income, according to Joshua Bagley, the Trust\u2019s deputy chief business officer.\n\u201cIf people love the Presidio they will love this project because it will add more housing, repair a key historic district and generate the revenue necessary to meet our park goals of delivering a beautiful, safe and clean park with no entrance fees, forever,\u201d Bagley said.\nThe Presidio is home to 3,000 residents, but the district lacks smaller units, with about 75 percent of the apartments in the park having three or four bedrooms, with some even having five or six bedrooms. The new buildings will be largely composed of studios, one- and two-bedroom units in two- and three-story buildings. In total, the project is expected to add about 160,000 square feet of new residential space to the Presidio.\n\u201cWe think it will create a more inviting park experience while helping to restore a key historic district in the Presidio that is not quite in the same condition as other parts of the Presidio,\u201d Bagley said.\nTo make it happen, the Trust is able to borrow money directly from the U.S. Treasury and develop without private partners using Presidio Trust equity. This makes it a unique project in San Francisco\u2019s risk-averse market, marking the Presidio Trust\u2019s first opportunity to be the developer on a new construction project.\nAt nearly 200 units, the project is the most ambitious ground-up development in the Presidio since the opening of the Letterman Digital Arts Center in 2005. The Disney Family Museum was completed in 2009, the Presidio Landmark apartment complex opened in 2010 and the Inn at the Presidio opened its doors in 2012.\nThe Presidio Trust plans to publish a \u201cnotice of intent\u201d to begin the\nenvironmental review\nprocess for the 196-unit development on Nov. 3. A public meeting about the project will be held Nov. 18. Shovels are expected to hit dirt in 2027.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Elliott Ingerman and Bill Brodsky\u2019s Tribeca Associates originally bought the building\nfor $130 million in 2016\n. The ownership group refinanced its original $96 million debt to $124.6 million in 2019.\nInterVest bought the loan in February 2024 and filed a\n$126 million pre-foreclosure action\nagainst the Tribeca Investment Group affiliate several months later.\nRose Associates, a real estate and management firm that specializes in luxury multifamily rentals, will help facilitate the conversion as a developer on the project, a spokesperson for Rose told Crain\u2019s.\nThe conversion will add an additional floor and include two ground-floor retail units. The building will have a fitness center, a yoga room, a lounge and a roof deck.\nIn 2023, the nonprofit family activity center CompletePlayground signed a 15-year, 40,000-square-foot lease for an indoor playground at the building, replacing a New York Sports Club.\nIn the same month, Tribeca entered into a forbearance agreement at the property after failing \u201cto make any of the required payments,\u201d leading to a default, according to the foreclosure complaint.\nThe building is also on a ground lease owned by Solil Management that runs until 2079. The annual rent was $2.7 million in 2016, but is scheduled to reset to 4.5 percent of the property\u2019s market value in 2035.\n",

        "content": "A condo unit at the\nMaybourne Beverly Hills\nsold to the titan of a family-owned food maker and distributor in one of the priciest deals at the ultra-luxe property.\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported\nunit 8E at 225 North Canon Drive went into contract last month, but the buyer and sale price were not known until now.\nThe four-bed, six-bath unit sold Oct. 10 for $27 million, or $4,762 per square foot, according to the deed.\nOhana Realty Corp.\u2019s Tyrone Phillips and Soren Olsen represented both the buyer and seller in the deal. Calls to Phillips and Olsen were not returned Thursday. An Ohana spokesperson said the company doesn\u2019t comment on ownership and indicated another unit, renovated and fully furnished, had sold at the Maybourne in the past for an even pricier amount.\nStill, Zillow records indicate this month\u2019s deal is the most expensive on-market condo trade for the city of Beverly Hills in the trailing 12 months. The $27 million sale also bests a previously reported record set by\nStan Kroenke\n, when the Los Angeles Rams owner paid $23.8 million for a unit in 2021.\nOctober\u2019s sale is also Los Angeles County\u2019s second-priciest recorded condo sale in the past 12 months after a January trade at The Century for $39.1 million, according to Zillow. Penthouse 39 at the Century City luxury high-rise spans 9,420 square feet, making for a purchase price of $4,153 per square foot.\nA trust linked to Gustavo Marquez and Maria Esther Marquez made this month\u2019s record-setting Maybourne purchase, according to the deed on the 5,670-square-foot penthouse. The seller was another trust linked to philanthropist couple Paul and Hisako Terasaki. The late Paul Terasaki was an organ transplant researcher, while his wife was an etcher.\nGustavo Marquez is an owner in food products maker and distributor Marquez Brothers International.\nSan Jose-based Marquez Brothers describes itself as a family-owned business that makes and distributes Hispanic foods under multiple brands. That includes The El Mexicano label of cheeses, creams, meats, yogurts and desserts. There\u2019s also Rancho Grande, San Juan, Autlan, Casero, La Tona, Saborcool, YoGusto and Marquez Family in its fold.\nRecords in PropertyShark and a\nDirt report\nshow in 2021 the Marquez trust paid $11 million, or $3,901 per square foot, for unit 7H. It\u2019s a smaller footprint than the most recent buy at three beds and four baths across 2,820 square feet.\nThe Maybourne hotel, where a room typically goes for over $1,000 a night, previously operated as the Montage Beverly Hills. The brand changed after the Qatar-backed Maybourne Hotel Group bought it in 2019 for a reported $415 million.\n",

The finished building is slated to span 136,800 square feet.\nDevelopments of just under 100 units\nhave become more common as city tax incentives make smaller buildings more attractive. The city\u2019s 485-x program\noffers a tax abatement for multifamily construction\n, but buildings with 100 or more units need to pay higher construction wages to take part in the program. Those wages, at $40 per hour, are high enough to affect how projects pencil out. Rivington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe firm paid $26.4 million through a shell company for the lot at 140 Fulton Street. The entity also borrowed $17.4 million from G4 Capital Partners. The seller was Bank Hapoalim. The\nCommercial Observer\nwas the first to report the trade.\nThe transaction is the latest in\na saga\nover the property.\nIn 2018, an entity connected to Hidrock Properties purchased the site from Raymond Gindi. Hidrock paid $19.8 million for No. 140, along with $21.2 million for the adjacent No. 142, which is a five-unit rental building.\nThe next year, the developer borrowed $32.8 million from Bank Hapoalim, hoping to construct a hotel. Hidrock, which is connected to the Hidary family, filed building permits for the lot.\nBut the hotel was never built. In 2022, the bank filed a foreclosure suit, alleging the borrower failed to meet the loan\u2019s maturity deadline despite three extensions. The total on the loan was now $35 million, according to Bank Hapoalim. The borrower countersued a few months later, claiming it was wrongly placed in default. The bank was successful, winning a $39.2 million judgement.\nAn auction was scheduled, but Bank Hapoalim agreed to wait another year for Hidrock to market the property. When no buyer presented themselves, the deed transferred to the bank this January. In June, Bank Hapaolim sued, claiming the Hidarys refused to sign transfer documents. It withdrew the suit a few weeks later when the documents were executed.\nNeither Hidrock nor Bank Hapoalim immediately responded to a request for comment.\n",

The increase in floor area is for the hotel, so that the developer can take advantage of empty space and make it mechanical space, according to a spokesperson for the development team. The spokesperson said it will not alter the height or exterior design of the Versailles building.\nIn August, an affiliate of New York-based Golden Tree Asset Management provided $85 million in mezzanine financing, adding to the\n$277 million-plus in debt\nprovided by Little Rock, Arkansas-based Bank OZK in 2020 and 2023.\nAlso in August, Doronin\u2019s Miami-based OKO Group and Blavatnik\u2019s New York-based Access Industries announced the\nstart of vertical construction.\nThe condo component has been fully presold for years for an average price of $5,000 per square foot, a spokesperson previously said. But construction was delayed in part due to complicated site work. It was previously expected to be completed in 2024, and more recently in 2026, but will be completed in 2027.\nThe condo tower was designed by Japanese architect\nKengo Kuma\n. Jean-Michel Gathy of Denniston, who has designed hotels for Aman, Four Seasons, Cheval Blanc and St. Regis, is designing restoration and redevelopment of the Versailles Hotel.\nThe project will also include a two-story underground parking garage. The site is next to Faena House, an oceanfront luxury condo building completed in 2015 that attracted billionaire buyers who included hedge fund manager Ken Griffin and Jamie Dinan. Backed by Blavatnik, Alan Faena developed Faena House, Faena Hotel and Faena Forum. He planned to develop the Versailles site, but that project was\ncanceled in 2016\ndue to the condo market slowdown. Doronin instead joined Blavatnik on the project\nin 2020\n.\nDoronin is also chairman and CEO of Aman, the Switzerland-based ultra-luxury hospitality group.\n",

March\u2019s list came close to that total with $234 million.\nAmong the top listings are late Texas oil tycoon\nCary Maquire\u2019s Preston Hollow home\nat 4606 Park Lane, which was relisted for $28.5 million after hitting the market last month.\nA spec mansion developed by the former Google director,\nJon Venverloh\n, spans 10,500 square feet and is asking $26 million, or $2,500 per square foot. The home, at 6901 Hunters Glen Road in University Park, was built by Venverloh\u2019s firm Venus Development Group, which he launched just before retiring from Google in 2019.\nIt features a nearly 1-acre lot, infinity-edge pool and reclaimed tile roof. Chad Barrett with Allie Beth Allman has the listing.\nDallas businessman\nLarry Lacerte\n, founder of tech company ExponentHR, is asking $35 million, or $1,708 per square foot, for his home at 3711 Lexington Avenue in Highland Park. The greenbelt-adjacent home spans 20,500 square feet with a guest apartment and a natatorium-equipped fitness center.\nThe home relisted after hitting the market in March for $35.6 million. Ralph Randall with Briggs Freeman Sotheby\u2019s International Real Estate has the listing.\nPanda Biotech founder\nBob Carter\nis asking $12.9 million for a 14,700-square-foot home at 10617 Bridge Hollow Court in Preston Hollow. That\u2019s $880 per square foot for the six-bedroom, 10-bathroom home.\nCompass Real Estate\u2019s Julie Provenanzo has the listing. The property listed briefly in September for the same price but was removed.\nBut the most-expensive listing in October was in Houston, Colleen Romanov\u2019s 22,000-square-foot estate, asking $60 million, or $2,727 per square foot.\nThe palatial compound is at\n107 Timberwilde Lane\n, just across Buffalo Bayou from the Houston Country Club. It sits on 9 acres and is modeled after English estates and Hearst Castle in San Simeon, California. The property listed in 2022 for $60 million,\nbumped up to $65 million in 2023\n, and dropped to\n$50 million\nbefore delisting. Coldwell Banker\u2019s Carol Wolfe has the listing.\n",

The deal would allow the firm to pay no property taxes on the site,\nThe Palm Beach Post reported\n.\nRelated Ross\nwon\na county request for proposals for a new convention center hotel last year. At the time, the firm planned a 20-story, 404-key Hilton Signia. It withdrew that plan, and on Wednesday it filed a redrawn unsolicited proposal, citing more costly financing due to higher interest rates and the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs. Under the new terms, the county would get the land worth about $20 million and annual rent of about $2 million, a Related Ross representative told the publication.\nThe 1.8-acre site, now a parking lot, is immediately south of CityPlace South Tower condominium, and east across the street from Related Ross\u2019 existing 12-story, 400-key\nHilton West Palm Beach\nat 600 Okeechobee Boulevard. That hotel was completed in 2016 on a site Related Ross leases from the county, meaning the developer has a similar arrangement with the county as that proposed for the Curio.\nIn its latest proposal, Related Ross referred to Trump\u2019s announcement last month of \u201cfurniture-specific\u201d tariffs, ranging from 30 percent to 50 percent, and added that the tariff\u2019s effects are \u201cnot yet fully understood.\u201d\nDespite the difficult lending climate, Related Ross remained confident the Curio hotel would obtain a loan due to West Palm\u2019s robust growth.\nRoss, who owns the Miami Dolphins, Formula One Miami and Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, is defying the norms for most octogenarians by starting his latest career move in his 80s. Ross, who founded New York-based Related Companies over 50 years ago, last year carved out the firm\u2019s Southeast division into his newly formed West Palm-based\nRelated Ross\n. Related Ross primarily focuses on West Palm, where it owns\nabout nine office buildings\n, including those developed,\npurchased\n, under construction and planned. It also has developed apartments and condo projects, and completed the CityPlace mixed-use complex in 2000.\nRoss, 85, tapped his New York network to lease his new office towers, attracting financial service firms, a move that aligns with Palm Beach County\u2019s yearslong push to make the area \u201cWall Street South.\u201d Ross, who owns a Palm Beach estate and is a major county benefactor, more recently pushed to also make the area into a tech mecca. ServiceNow, a Fortune 500 cloud computing company,\npreleased\nat Related Ross\u2019 10 CityPlace office building that the firm is developing on a portion of CityPlace.\n\u2014\nLidia Dinkova\n",

The sale to the San Francisco-based investments and development firm marks the priciest multifamily trade in Marina del Rey in more than a decade and one of only a few properties to sell there since the pandemic.\nCarmel bought the residences for nearly $578,000 per unit, a cut of about 15% from the $167.3 million that Chicago-based Nuveen paid for the Stella property in 2013. That same year brought another expensive transaction to Marina del Rey when\nCapri Capital Partners\nand Kennedy Wilson acquired the 437-unit Esprit complex for $225 million.\nMultifamily properties in Marina del Rey don\u2019t trade hands often, and new construction in the small seaside enclave is even rarer. No new multifamily projects have been built since 2019, and only five properties have sold in the past decade, per Colliers data cited by Commercial Observer.\nOf those five, the 198-unit Villa Del Mar sold to an undisclosed buyer in July for $62 million. The seller, Far West Management, developed the property in 1972 and operated it over the next five decades. That property is the third largest of 16 harborside multifamily complexes in Marina Del Rey.\nCarmel Partners, meanwhile, is moving forward with plans a few miles away. The developer is planning a\n43-story apartment tower\nat 1050 South La Cienega Boulevard, replacing a vacant lot just south of Beverly Hills. Its proposal calls for 532 units complete with parking and open space. That development will include 64 affordable apartments set aside for extremely-low-income households in order for Carmel to secure Transit Oriented Community incentives to build larger than zoning rules allow.\nIn May, Los Angeles County officials approved the\nfirst fully affordable housing project\nto rise in Marina del Rey.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Kilroy\u2019s deal with Acadia is one of several leases signed for the recently opened 865,000-square-foot second phase of the development. With the lease-up, Kilroy is on track to exceed its goal of leasing 100,000 square feet by the end of the year.\nAcadia\u2019s location in South San Francisco will complement its headquarters offices in San Diego and Princeton, New Jersey. The pharmaceutical maker plans to open its space at Oyster Point in April with 10 to 20 employees, though there\u2019s enough room for 60 people.\nSouth San Francisco is\none of the nation\u2019s top biotech and life sciences hubs\n, not far from top tech university Stanford, so the Peninsula city was a natural location choice for Acadia to plant its flag in the Bay Area.\n\u201cThis strategic move enhances Acadia\u2019s access to the region\u2019s rich pool of talent and reflects our commitment to building a diverse and dynamic presence across key innovation hubs,\u201d company spokesperson Deb Kazenelson told the Business Times.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time Acadia leases from Kilroy; the company is a tenant of Los Angeles-based Kilroy in San Diego.\nAcadia Pharmaceuticals was founded in 1993 and boasts 650 employees worldwide, with offices in Toronto in Canada, Amsterdam in the Netherlands, and Basel and Zug in Switzerland. The company focuses on neurological disorders and rare diseases. Among its creations are the drug Nuplazid for Parkinson\u2019s disease-related psychosis. Two years ago, it won approval from the Food and Drug Administration for Daybue, the first FDA-approved medication to treat people with Rett syndrome, a rare genetic brain disorder that continues to worsen eye and body movement and language.\nIn the face of\nfederal funding cuts\nto research and other health-related pursuits, biotech companies have been forced to cut jobs and reconsider office and lab plans.

        "content": "The Texas Municipal League is leaving Austin after three decades for a new headquarters in Georgetown, marking a major civic win for the fast-growing suburb\u2019s historic downtown.\nThe league and its affiliated entities will \u201cinvest millions\u201d to renovate the four-story, 64,000-square-foot Wesleyan Building at 205 East University Avenue, just east of the town square, Georgetown Mayor Joshua Schroeder said.\nThe Texas Municipal League Intergovernmental Risk Pool will acquire and redevelop the mid-century property \u2014 also known as the Georgetonian \u2014 into the Texas Municipal Center, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n. Georgetown is about 30 miles north of Austin.\nThe move ends a months-long site search that included several Austin-area options. The league and the risk pool, which together employ about 250 people, have long shared space at 1821 Rutherford Lane in northeast Austin.\nThe organizations said their aging facility no longer fits a workforce that now operates mostly remote, leaving excess space, outdated systems and underused offices. The\nGeorgetown\nsite, by contrast, will be redesigned with flexible layouts, wellness features and upgraded technology.\nBoard chair Bert Lumbreras said in a statement that the decision to house the center in\nGeorgetown\nreinforced the league\u2019s commitment to serving member cities for decades to come.\nThe risk pool, which plans to renovate and modernize the Wesleyan Building, is working through zoning updates and community engagement before beginning construction.\nCompletion and move-in are slated for 2029. Built in the 1960s by a Methodist Church affiliate as an independent living facility, the building later served as general offices under owner McIntosh Holdings, which had weighed converting it into condos before this deal emerged.\nNo financial incentives are being offered for the relocation, though Schroeder said the city and the league are discussing a partnership on a new downtown parking garage and event space to support both local needs and visiting officials.\nThe structure would rise on a city lot between Ninth and Tenth streets and include the first phase of Georgetown\u2019s planned Ninth Street Art Walk.\nThe Texas Municipal League, a nonprofit advocacy group representing more than 1,100 cities statewide, and its sister entity, the Intergovernmental Risk Pool, which provides insurance and loss prevention services, have shared the Austin campus since the 1990s.\nThe move comes as Southwestern University embarks on a massive development just east of its campus.\nThe 185-year-old liberal arts college is planning a mixed-use district called\nSouthwestern University 560\n, envisioned as a \u201cmini city\u201d with housing, offices, retail, restaurants, a boutique hotel, cultural spaces and a concert venue. The City of Georgetown agreed to build a service center there for 275 city employees as well.\nOther projects coming to Georgetown include Dallas-based\nColumnar Investments\u2019\n$100 million mixed-use project called Heirloom in Georgetown, a 620-acre development pitched as something that would create a second Main Street.\nPlans include up to 3,600 residential units, 48 acres of parkland, and at least 200,000 square feet of commercial space. The project will feature a walkable retail district designed to mirror Georgetown\u2019s existing downtown square.\nGeorgetown has been the fastest-growing city of its size nationwide for three consecutive years.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The transfer ends BGO\u2019s nearly decade-long ownership of the 1960s-era tower, which appears to have faced occupancy challenges amid a sluggish post-pandemic leasing environment.\nNew York Life estimated the property was valued at about $150 million at the time of the transfer,\nPincusCo\nreported, citing industry sources. That\u2019s less than half the Canadian investment firm paid in 2015, when it bought the property from Aby Rosen\u2019s RFR Holding for $360 million. New York Life provided a $205 million loan for the purchase that carried a 15-year term. At the time, the building was 95 percent leased.\nIn 2017, Bentall Kennedy tried to sell a 49 percent stake in\n757 Third Avenue\nand two San Francisco properties in hopes to raise $1 billion. But that apparently never happened. Bentall Kennedy merged with GreenOak Real Estate in 2023 to become BentallGreenOak.\nThe 26-story building two blocks west of the United Nations counts Wolfe Research, Berkley Insurance and Grant Thornton among its largest tenants. Berkley renewed its 60,000-square-foot lease in 2022, but overall occupancy has remained under pressure as tenants across Midtown East shedded space or relocated to newer buildings after the pandemic. Occupancy at the building has fallen to about 74 percent, according to CoStar data.\nLast year, reinsurance broker BMS Group expanded its footprint to 13,000 square feet and software company Endava took 7,000 square feet in the building, according to\nCommercial Observer\n, which first reported news of the deed-in-lieu. The Consulate General of Portugal also announced it would relocate to a 7,000-square-foot prebuilt space on the 17th floor.\nThe handover adds to a growing list of older Midtown assets reverting to lenders or being sold at a discount as debt maturities collide with higher interest rates and diminished office values.\nBGO and New York Life did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",

        "content": "Outpost expanded its industrial portfolio into Miami-Dade County after paying $52.1 million for an outdoor storage site.\nChicago-based Outpost, led by CEO Trent Cameron, acquired the 17-acre property at 3200 Northwest 67th Avenue adjacent to Miami International Airport, Marc Smouha with Corepoint RE told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nSmouha and Jonathan Marti, also with Corepoint RE, brokered the off-market deal. The property sold for nearly $23 million above the previous sale price five years ago.\nThe seller, an affiliate of Oakbrook, Illinois-based CenterPoint Properties, led by CEO Jim Clewlow, paid\n$29.5 million\nfor the site in 2020, records show. The 17 acres are part of a 200-acre industrial complex that sits right behind the airport\u2019s runways. The warehouses surrounding the outdoor storage yard were developed by Florida East Coast Industries, the parent company to the high-speed\nBrightline\ntrain.\nOutpost owns and operates a nationwide network of truck terminals and container drop yards for freight and logistics providers, according to the firm\u2019s website. The company targets storage yards near distribution hubs, freight corridors and intermodal facilities in major cities.\nWith its recent purchase, Outpost now operates five outdoor storage facilities in Florida, including a 14-acre depot in Tamarac that can fit up to 370 semi-trucks, the firm\u2019s website shows. The company charges monthly rates between $200 to $400.\nCenterPoint is among the top institutional investors in Miami-Dade\u2019s industrial market. In 2022, the firm dropped\n$47.5 million\nfor a 12-acre outdoor storage facility that is fully leased to Miami Truck Parking. The prior year, CenterPoint acquired a fully leased distribution facility in Doral for\n$16.7 million\n, as well as paying\n$184.4 million\nfor two warehouses and a development site within a Hialeah business park.\nIn the third quarter, industrial sales in Miami-Dade County averaged $276 a square foot, the highest in the state, according to an Avison Young report. Miami-Dade also led Florida in overall sales volume with $687 million in deals in the third quarter. Figures for last year\u2019s third quarter sales numbers were not available.",

Development costs for the 275-unit project are believed to be more than $127 million.\nThe Pacific Companies is seeking approval for the allocation of tax credits for the property in Reseda. The firm applied for $6.4 million in\nlow-income housing tax credit\n, as well as $68 million in tax-exempt bonds, last December.\nThe development will be for residents earning at or below 30, 50, 60 and 70 percent of the area median income.\nTwin Park Landing will consist of two buildings containing 275 one-bedroom units. It will rise near the Los Angeles River and Reseda Park, and residents will have walking-distance access to more than 300,000 square feet of retail space in the Reseda Boulevard corridor.\nThe Pacific Companies and Safehold have joined forces before. In July, the two companies signed an agreement to build a 227-unit residential development in San Diego. They\ninked similar deals\non four other projects last year with 781 units throughout California.\nThe Twin Park Landing project is expected to be completed in 2029.\nMore than 8,000 units across metro Los Angeles were under construction this month, according to Yardi Matrix. So far this year, 3,500 affordable units have been delivered, making up 36.2 percent of all housing completions in the local market.\nElsewhere in Reseda, four rent-controlled cottages are\nslated to be demolished\nto make way for a six-story, 95-unit apartment building from multifamily developer JZA Architecture.\nThe Los Angeles-based firm submitted a pre-application to the Los Angeles City Planning department last month on behalf of developer Efi Meirson to utilize\nExecutive Directive 1 incentives\nfor affordable housing for its planned residential property at 7040-46 Baird Avenue.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A spacious Lake Geneva waterfront home sold Friday for $10.3 million, among the highest priced home deals in the Wisconsin resort town this year.\nThe 7,900-square-foot house at\n620 South Lake Shore Drive\nsits on the east end of the lake, a short walk from downtown Lake Geneva. Occupying a 2-acre lot, the house has seven bedrooms, seven bathrooms and 121 feet of lake frontage.\nThe house, one of the few lakefront properties for sale on Geneva Lake, sold for close to $500,000 \u2014 or about 5 percent \u2014 above the asking price. The seller received five offers for the house, said\nBob Webster\n, the Compass agent who had the listing. Webster also represented the buyer on the transaction.\nThe house was\nadvertised as \u201ccoming soon\u201d\non the Milwaukee-area MLS Aug. 26 and was officially listed Sept. 2. By Sept. 5, it was under contract with the buyer.\n\u201cThe market is still very, very strong,\u201d Webster said. \u201cIf we had two or three more homes just like this for sale right now, I think they would probably go quickly as well.\u201d\nThe sale price makes it the second most expensive home on Geneva Lake to sell this year, slightly surpassing a\n$10.1 million home\nthat sold in August. The priciest sale this year was a nearly 11,000 square-foot waterfront mansion that\nsold for $20 million in June\n.\nThe latest buyers already have a property on Lake Geneva and are trading up for the larger house, Webster said. He declined to identify the buyers. In addition to the sale price, Webster said the buyers also paid an amount \u201cin the small hundreds of thousands of dollars\u201d for personal property like furniture included with the house.\nThe appeal of the house came from its proximity to Lake Geneva\u2019s downtown area, while also being on a secluded driveway on the lakefront, Webster said.\nProperty tax records link the house to a trust under the name Lynette M. Heimann that appears to be the seller. It paid $90,000 in property taxes in 2024, Walworth County records show.\nThe sale follows a strong run of top-dollar sales on the shores of Geneva Lake this fall. Brokers in the area have said demand is at the highest level they\u2019ve seen, and very few high-end properties are going on the market.\nWebster sold another lakefront house for $8.7 million earlier this week, and a house at an exclusive club with a shared beach sold off-market earlier this month\nfor $7 million\n. Another lakefront house\nsold Oct. 21 for $8.6 million\n, and two other lakefront homes worth more than $5 million are under contract.\nBoth the South Lake Shore Drive property and the other property Webster recently sold hit the market at the same time, and were marketed using a delayed listing strategy that shows the properties as \u201ccoming soon\u201d before they officially go on the market.\nWebster said that strategy, rather than marketing the houses off public channels as an exclusive listing, worked well for the properties and allowed them to get broad exposure.\n\u201cI think the strategy worked exactly to both sellers\u2019 advantage, because it gave us time to get it out in the market and let it percolate a little bit,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "Steve Koleno, one of the nation\u2019s top residential brokers, has left\nDream Town\nafter its merger with 174-year-old\nBaird &amp; Warner\nto move his Illinois business to startup brokerage Spot Real Estate.\nSpot Real Estate is billed as a cost-saving brokerage for sellers, offering a 1 percent commission fee, rather than the standard 2 to 3 percent.\nKoleno, who came on as a broker and vice president of consumer empowerment in late September, has been outspoken about offering consumers options beyond the standard real estate model. Koleno works with low-commission and\nflat-fee brokerages\nin other states, and he said Spot\u2019s business model fits with his philosophy of giving consumers more choices in real estate.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to go out and try to take some market share, really give folks some options,\u201d Koleno said. \u201cI know there\u2019s people looking for options all over, and the traditional legacy industry just doesn\u2019t provide that.\u201d\nThe firm was founded in March by Mark Miles, who previously had stints as the director of operations and technology at Dream Town and as a managing broker at\n@properties\n.\nMiles said he was inspired to start Spot Real Estate after he saw average commissions increase, rather than decrease, in the wake of the\nantitrust\nsettlement with the National Association of Realtors last year over commission fees. While there are flat-fee brokerages in Chicagoland, Miles said he didn\u2019t see many brokerages offering low commissions while offering full services.\nSellers who work with Spot can choose from two tiers that include a fee plus 1% of the sale price, or a flat fee that gets their property on the MLS but offers minimal marketing services.\n\u201cThere was a sweet spot, where nobody was filling that gap, giving a reduced commission to consumers without reducing the services that were being provided,\u201d Miles said.\nMiles said he connected with Koleno after seeing a social media post that Koleno was looking for a brokerage in Illinois outside the traditional model. Miles and Koleno are the only brokers at Spot, but they are looking to expand.\nKoleno, who started in real estate in Illinois but now sells in more than a dozen states, was the sixth-highest selling agent in the country last year, according to Real Trends, with close to $704 million in volume on 2,088 transaction sides.\nKoleno\njoined Dream Town\na year ago to focus on luxury sales. After it was\nbought by Baird &amp; Warner\nearlier this year, he said he felt like the older, traditional brokerage \u201cwasn\u2019t a good fit anymore.\u201d\nIllinois has been a smaller part of Koleno\u2019s operation in recent years as he focused on business in other states, he told\nThe Real Deal.\nHe said he\u2019s sold fewer properties in Illinois in recent years than he used to, but he\u2019d like to increase his local sales with this move.\n",

        "content": "Aviation services heavyweight AAR Corp is making a rare big bet on downtown Chicago, signing a major lease at the\nMerchandise Mart\nthat contrasts with the city\u2019s shrinking office trend.\nThe Wood Dale-based firm inked a deal for 90,000 square feet at the\nVornado Realty Trust\n-owned 3.7 million-square-foot riverfront property, located at 222 West Merchandise Mart Plaza, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe company will relocate from a smaller office at\n321 North Clark Street\n, nearly tripling its downtown space.\nStream Realty Partners\n\u2019 Andrea Saewitz, Wendy Katz and Ben Cleveland oversee leasing at the Mart.\nThe deal extends a winning streak for the property, which has outperformed much of the market thanks to a $40 million amenities overhaul completed last year.\nThe upgrades have helped lure tenants including Medline Industries, Berlin Packaging, GrubHub, Kin Insurance and Chartis. The Mart is now 84 percent leased, compared with a downtown average of 72 percent, according to CBRE.\nIt\u2019s a welcome development for landlords after years of remote work and corporate downsizing pushed the central business district\u2019s vacancy rate to record highs.\nAAR\u2019s move comes amid a post-pandemic rebound for aviation services. The publicly traded company, which supplies aircraft parts and maintenance for airlines, has been ramping up hiring after a labor crunch that intensified as air travel demand surged back in 2022. AAR reported $2.8 billion in sales over the 12 months ending May 31, up 20 percent year-over-year.\nWhat\u2019s unclear is how the new office fits into AAR\u2019s long-term plans. The company\u2019s headquarters remains at its owned facility in Wood Dale, near O\u2019Hare International Airport, and the suburb confirmed AAR renewed its business license through 2026.\nMany suburban companies have spent the past decade migrating to downtown in pursuit of younger, urban talent, though few have expanded as aggressively as AAR in the current market.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Title companies hold those credits in escrow until the\nfinal tax bills\narrive, refunding the difference once payments are made. But with the county months behind, that money \u2014 often thousands per transaction \u2014 is frozen.\nThe delay, officials have said, stems from a still-unfinished transition to new computer systems managed by\nTexas-based Tyler Technologies\n. The switch was supposed to be completed in April, but as of late October, dozens of tasks were outstanding, according to a county technology tracker.\nIt\u2019s not the first time county bureaucracy has tripped up the billing cycle. In 2022, bills went out five months late \u2014 in December \u2014 with a Dec. 31 due date. This time, there\u2019s still no mailing date in sight.\nThe lag has turned routine closings into logistical headaches.\nTitle firms are collecting 1.5 to 2 times last year\u2019s second installment amounts to ensure enough funds are available when new, higher reassessments hit.\nThat means buyers are fronting more cash, even for homes well into the seven figures. One North Center buyer who closed on a $2.6 million house in August may have as much as $17,000 tied up until the bill drops.\nWhile buyers and title firms wait, the bigger financial strain falls on local governments that rely on property taxes to operate.\nIn September, the Cook County Board approved a $300 million bridge loan to keep municipalities and school districts afloat until revenue starts flowing again. Chicago advanced\n$28 million\nto the Firemen\u2019s Annuity &amp; Benefit Fund in September and will continue to lend to all four pension funds as needed until the property tax issue is resolved.\nThis is not the first time Chicago has provided stopgap loans to its pensions, having advanced over $900 million in similar loans in late 2022 and 2023.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The facility will boast 1 million square feet of sellable space, with expanded ballrooms and exhibition areas designed to keep\nDallas\ncompetitive for global events.\nProgress has been mostly invisible. Inspire Dallas crews have been handling testing, zoning and underground surprises, from buried pipes to aging gas lines.\n\u201cOur job is to look at all of those things, oversee it, control it, massage, push and threaten whatever it takes to get the right answer,\u201d Matthews told city leaders.\nThe project arrives with complications.\nFIFA will use the existing convention halls as its International Broadcast Center during the World Cup next year, forcing Matthews\u2019 team to phase demolition and construction around 485,000 square feet of broadcast operations.\nCity officials expect the\nconvention center\nto spark an estimated $1.6 billion in economic impact, backed by 64 conventions already booked. The City Council approved a $1 billion bridge loan in June with JPMorgan to fund early work, including upgrades to Dallas Memorial Arena and Pioneer Plaza.\nFor Matthews, who began assembling land in the\nCedars\nback in 1997 and has since invested more than $300 million there, the convention center is the next step in knitting the southwest corner of downtown into a connected, mixed-use hub.\n\u201cThe southwest corner of the city is one of the last pieces to come to life,\u201d he said. \u201cThe convention center helps that opportunity happen.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

In the meeting on Wednesday, the developers got the green light to demolish the two existing condo buildings on the site, the Ambassador Palm Beach Hotel &amp; Residences at 2730 South Ocean Boulevard, and Edgewater at 2720 South Ocean Boulevard.\nThe project was approved on the condition that several design details be revisited at the Feb. 25 Arcom meeting, including \u201cincreased landscaping, detailing of stone attachment, the railing design, the mechanical penthouse level, and the gates,\u201d a town spokesperson confirmed.\nMiami-based OKO is led by Vlad Doronin, who is also CEO of Aman Group. London-based Cain is a partnership between Jonathan Goldstein and Todd Boehly\u2019s Greenwich, Connecticut-based Eldridge Industries. The partners bought the 4.9-acre site for\n$146.6 million\nin 2022.\nOKO and Cain tapped the architecture firm OMA and William Sofield\u2019s New York City-based Studio Sofield to handle the design of the project. A representative for the project at an August meeting said it would be\nAman-branded\n, but OKO has denied that the project will be branded.\nThe planned condo project is slated to include 41 units. Plans shared in August showed that the top floor of each building will have a penthouse. Pricing has not been released for the condos, but sources say unit prices per square foot could top $5,000.\nOKO and Cain\u2019s project will be the first newly constructed condominium on the island in years. Residents at the meeting on Wednesday noted this would likely be the first of many redevelopments on the South End of Palm Beach, which has\nmore than a dozen aging condo buildings\n, many that are receiving offers from developers.\nMeanwhile, across the water,\nthousands of units are in development\nin West Palm Beach.",

Ocean Boulevard, called Landmark Square is one of the newer and taller offices in the seaside downtown, located at the key intersection of Pine Avenue.\nThe seller, a Manulife Financial Corporation affiliate, paid $135.5 million in 2013 when it acquired the property from Brookfield Properties, according to an\nannouncement\n. The price per square foot has gone from $295 to $109 under Manulife\u2019s ownership.\nHead of transactions and capital markets for another Manulife unit, Jessica Harrison, signed the deed in mid-October.\nEast West Bank issued a $25 million note to Shomof, according to records.\nNeither the seller nor the lender immediately responded to a request for comment. Shomof, who founded the Shomof Group, confirmed the deal.\nThe property has views of the Pacific Ocean, the Queen Mary, the Port of Long Beach and the Los Angeles skyline \u2014 but offices in the area haven\u2019t recovered from the drag of the pandemic. The Downtown Long Beach office submarket has a 28.5 percent vacancy rate, according to recent CBRE analysis. That\u2019s high by historic standards and nearly on par with downtown Los Angeles, which is a regional poster-child for office distress.\nShomof appears to be on a shopping spree in search of discounted offices. Early this year, he\npurchased\nan office building at 101 N. Brand Boulevard in Glendale for $58.8 million \u2014 it was owned by Beacon Capital Partners, which paid $128.5 million for the property in 2016.

Pustilnikov and other investors, in early October, bought the Pacmutual property (three connected offices) at a bargain price of $48.5 million; its prior owners paid $200 million in 2015.\n",

It\u2019s the latest stumble in a saga now stretching four years, underscoring the team\u2019s struggle to move beyond 102-year-old Soldier Field, the league\u2019s oldest stadium.\nDespite flashy renderings and shifting plans \u2014 from a proposed $4.7 billion domed lakefront venue favored by Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson to a sprawling 326-acre suburban campus \u2014 the Halas-McCaskey family\u2013owned franchise has failed to secure the political backing it needs.\n\u201cThe Bears have not handled this well,\u201d Kennesaw State University economist J.C. Bradbury, who studies public stadium financing, told the outlet. \u201cThey\u2019ve failed to build a compelling business case.\u201d\nThe team\u2019s pitch focused on Arlington Heights, where it owns a former racetrack site \u2014 Arlington International Racecourse \u2014 and wants\n$855 million\nin infrastructure funding and a freeze on the property\u2019s assessed value.\nThe Bears even offered a $25 million lump sum to Chicago and the Park District \u2014 which owns Soldier Field \u2014 in an attempt to sweeten negotiations. But neither Chairman George McCaskey nor team president Kevin Warren appeared in Springfield during the abbreviated six-day session, leaving lobbyists to make the case.\nWith state coffers tightening and Governor JB Pritzker warning agencies of possible federal funding cuts, the optics were poor. The governor also insists the Bears must first pay off a\n$534 million debt\nfor Soldier Field\u2019s 2003 renovation.\n\u201cTimes are about to be so tough,\u201d said State Rep. Kam Buckner, a Chicago Democrat whose district includes Soldier Field. \u201cHow can anyone make this make sense? The Bears are tone-deaf.\u201d\nBuckner proposed a bill that would\nrequire public review\n, economic reporting and potential repayment of subsidies for any major stadium deal \u2014 a move aimed squarely at the Bears\u2019 proposal.\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t talking about giving help to billionaires to build a stadium,\u201d said Illinois House Speaker Chris Welch. \u201cThey\u2019re just not.\u201d\nThat political reality leaves the Bears isolated and in limbo. The team\u2019s minority owners, the billionaire Ryan family, are not contributing to the stadium plan, and Pritzker has made clear he won\u2019t spend taxpayer dollars on a privately owned venue.\nAdding to the contrast, Chicago Fire FC owner\nJoe Mansueto\nrecently committed $650 million of his own money to build a soccer stadium south of downtown, while the city\u2019s other major teams \u2014 the Cubs, Bulls and Blackhawks \u2014 all play in privately financed arenas.\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league stands ready to help if asked, but without a state deal or deep-pocketed partners \u2014\u00a0 Bears leadership are reportedly open to appealing to institutional investors with a private equity route \u2014 the Bears\u2019 suburban dream is on the sidelines.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "As New York City prepares to elect a new mayor, Queens is set for a new chapter, courtesy of the outgoing hizzoner.\nOn Wednesday, the City Council\nadvanced\nthe Long Island City rezoning, expected to create 14,700 new homes over the next decade.\nThe City Council Committee on Land Use and the Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises voted in favor of the rezoning after the Adams administration promised to invest $1.5 billion in the neighborhood.\nThe rezoning project is expected to net 4,300 affordable apartments and 3.5 million square feet of new commercial space.\nIn the same breath, the City Council also\napproved\na big rezoning in Jamaica, a plan is expected to create 11,800 housing units, of which 4,200 will be permanently affordable.\nFor those keeping score, that should be five rezonings pushed over the finish line during Eric Adams\u2019 administration. Doing his best to back up his claim as the \u201cmost pro-housing mayor\u201d in NYC history.\nThe Chetrits, on the other hand, are doing little to shed a sordid reputation among tenants. Joseph Chetrit was\nindicted\non felony charges of tenant harassment this week, joining brother Meyer as a defendant in a case accusing them of harassing elderly Chelsea tenants.\nThe charges were the latest in\nManhattan authorities\u2019 enforcement push\nto pursue bad behavior by landlords.\nIt was a similarly bad week for Alex Sapir. The Sapir Corporation\nfiled for insolvency\n, claiming it can no longer meet its bond payments or cover operating costs. All the company\u2019s directors resigned, according to a filing with the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, which names Alex Sapir as the controlling shareholder.\nIsraeli chain Dan Hotels is in contract to buy the troubled Nomo Soho for $125 million. The deal would mark Dan Hotels\u2019 first step into the U.S. market following its recent international expansion in India.\nJonathan Bennett\u2019s AmTrustRE is\nin contract\nto buy the 22-story 260 Madison Avenue from Sapir for $217 million. The buyer said the 570,000-square-foot property is only 68 percent leased with about $10 million of annual net operating income.\nAnd speaking of buyers, we take you live to the set of \u201cShark Tank\u201d:\nHello, sharks. I\u2019m Corcoran\u2019s Carrie Chiang. I am seeking a buyer for a $16 million penthouse on Fifth Avenue. I represent the buyer, while Serena Boardman represents the seller.\nThe unit has three bedrooms, formal dining and living rooms, a library and terrace, tall ceilings and many of its original details.\nMark Cuban, presumably: Sorry, I\u2019m out.\nBarbara Corcoran:\nCount me in\n!\nThe only thing more remarkable than the shortest segment in the show\u2019s 16-year history is the fact that Barbara Corcoran listed and sold another penthouse in the neighborhood three weeks ago, roughly a dozen blocks north of her new digs.\n",

        "content": "Long Island City could be on the receiving end of another 15,000 apartments if the City Council approves a\nrezoning proposal\nslated for a vote later this month.\nIf the neighborhood\u2019s prior evolution is any indication, a fresh slate of sites is likely an attractive prospect for developers, who have delivered thousands of housing units since a major rezoning in 2001.\nLong Island City has transformed in recent years from an aging industrial scape to a desirable residential hub. The area\u2019s development boom began largely with rental projects before luxury condo towers sprouted up, benefiting from an\ninflux of demand\nduring the pandemic.\nPrice growth in Long Island City is undeniable, even if long-term comparisons can be murky considering there were few homes to sell before rezoning efforts. Between 2014 and 2024, median sale prices in the neighborhood more than doubled, up from $287,000 to $667,000, according to a\nreport from Property Shark\n.\nIn September, the median sale price was $805,000, up 11 percent from the same month last year, according to data from Redfin. During the same period, the median price per square foot rose more than 5 percent to over $1,000.\nOne of the neighborhood\u2019s most notable projects is\nChris Jiashu Xu\u2019s Skyline Tower\n, which has pushed the boundaries of price expectations since launching sales in 2019. At the time, Xu anticipated the 800 units to sell out for more than $1 billion.\nA penthouse at the building set a new price per square foot record in 2023 when it closed for\n$2.3 million\n, or $2,300 per square foot. The tower is also home to the priciest rental in Queens, a 67th-floor penthouse that snagged a new tenant earlier this year with a last asking price of $11,500 per month, the New York Post reported.\nHowever, the building at 3 Court Square isn\u2019t without its challenges. Several of its penthouses, priced between $2 million and $3.4 million still haven\u2019t traded. Plus, 90 condo owners at the tower\nsued the developers\nin 2022 over allegations that early victories heralded by the team behind the project were actually misrepresentations of actual sales numbers, which were later revealed to be much lower than the numbers shared at the time many buyers signed contracts.\nDespite the slowdown at Skyline, developers don\u2019t appear to be backing down from building condos in the neighborhood. Montperia Group and JLS Construction Group are planning a 40-story tower, including more than 200 condos, at 24-02 Queens Plaza South, backed by a\n$115 million\nconstruction loan from Maxim Credit Group.\nEarlier this week, Hang Dong Zhang\u2019s BZ Development Group finally\nfiled plans\nto demolish a three-story building at 23-08 Jackson Avenue six years after buying it. The developer is planning to replace the 18,000-square-foot structure with luxury condos, called the Moon Court Square.\nNot so fast\u2026\nThe New York City mayoral election is finally upon us, but the jury\u2019s still out on whether a potential Zohran Mamdani victory will send wealthy residents packing.\nSince the Assemblyman won the Democratic primary earlier this summer, brokerage executives and agents have forecasted doom and gloom for the real estate market if Mamdani prevails. Chief among their cautions is a refrain that New York\u2019s richest residents will flee the city over fears of rising taxes and crime.\nHowever, others in the industry have pushed back on that narrative. Some are projecting that sidelined buyers will re-enter the market if prices drop, according to a\nCurbed\narticle published earlier this week. Others, including Serhant\u2019s Peter Zaitzeff, characterized most of the chatter as conjecture.\n\u201cObviously, there\u2019s a lot of talk, but it\u2019s just talk,\u201d Zaitzeff told the outlet. \u201cNew Yorkers like to talk, they like sensationalism, but New York is New York.\u201d\nStill, many brokers are on edge, especially as agents in the suburbs are reporting an uptick in activity ahead of the election. The\nNew York Post\nbilled the rising prices and competition in Greenwich, Connecticut and Westchester as a reaction to the looming change in leadership.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been seeing bidding wars, and we\u2019ve been seeing people come out of New York City,\u201d Houlihan Lawrence\u2019s Joy Metalios told the outlet.\nCompass\u2019 Heather Harrison, who works alongside her husband, Zach, told the Post that Westchester is \u201ceven busier than it was during Covid.\u201d\nBut the duo was quoted in Curbed as saying most of the folks moving out to the suburbs were already planning to regardless of the election. They added that perhaps the only true consequence of the pending election is those suburban buyers pulling the trigger more quickly over fears that even more competitors will enter the ring, given all the press coverage.\nEven if the Mamdani-related woes are far-fetched, the industry still isn\u2019t taking any changes. After Mayor Eric Adams dropped out of the race in September, real estate professionals backing the incumbent official instead\nsteered their donations\nto former Gov. Andrew Cuomo\nEarly voting ends on Sunday, Nov. 2 at 5 p.m. Election Day voting begins on Tuesday, Nov. 4 at 6 a.m. and closes the same day at 9 p.m.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe most expensive deal to land in city records this week was a condo at Extell Development\u2019s\n50 West 66th Street\n, which closed for roughly $47 million, or $6,700 per square foot. Unit 47E in the Upper West Side tower sold to an anonymous LLC known as Darcy5066.\nCorcoran\u2019s Beth Benalloul and Hilary Landis are heading sales at the 127-unit building.\n",

        "content": "The mayoral election is days away and industry bugaboo Zohran Mamdani still holds a massive lead.\nDepending on whom you hear from, sellers are heading for the hills (or the beaches of South Florida). Even in less contentious elections, it\u2019s a common refrain from brokers and analysts that buyers take a pause.\nBut UrbanDigs co-founder and number-cruncher Noah Rosenblatt said at a panel held by Platinum Properties on Wednesday that he\u2019s been seeing activity quite to the contrary.\n\u201cBelieve it or not, for the first time, I\u2019m actually starting to see some favorable data over the last three, four, five weeks,\u201d he said.\nI followed up with UrbanDigs, whose data show there have been 986 contracts signed in the last 30 days, pacing 4 percent ahead of the same period last year. It\u2019s worth noting that while this time last year was a presidential election, but recent activity is also 8 percent ahead of the October season average.\nThe Real Deal\nhas previously reported\nthat claims of election market slowdowns are largely unfounded\n, but that hasn\u2019t stopped talking heads from citing frontrunner Zohran Mamdani\u2019s campaign promises as impetus for a mass exodus.\nBut a new mayor doesn\u2019t seem to be having any tangible impact on the residential sales market.\n\u201cIf this election is everything that it\u2019s been brought up to be, which is this decision point about the future of New York, I don\u2019t think buyers have gotten the message,\u201d UrbanDigs co-founder John Walkup told me during a call the next day.\nWhile multifamily owners and real estate investors have a\ndifferent calculation to make given Mamdani\u2019s housing policies\n, the stream of home-buying activity speaks to the host of other factors that keep the market humming\ndespite conclusions reached by the New York Post\n.\nThere is time yet for the city\u2019s wealthy to flee in the wake of a Mamdani victory, and some might be holding out hope for a Cuomo upset, but there\u2019s at least 986 buyers recently betting on New York City.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n:\nTRD\n\u2019s latest property manager rankings are live in the November issue, and the theme of the last few years has been consolidation \u2014 and the risks that come with it. Do you know any mergers that have not gone as expected, or building\u2019s revolting under new management? Email me at\njacob.indursky@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: More than 50,000 runners (including a couple of\nTRD\n\u2019s own) will be darting across the city on Sunday during the 54th New York City Marathon. While those 26.2 miles take them on paved streets across all five boroughs, an \u201canalysis\u201d from a running company showed that runners could instead run across the Brooklyn Bridge 24 times, Central Park four times, or step across 103,752 New York City rats. Maybe an idea for the city\u2019s next rat czar.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 Governor Kathy Hochul announced $100 million in state funding for food pantries and emergency food providers in anticipation of a freeze in federal SNAP benefits, City and State\nreported\n. But the spigot for SNAP benefits will remain off, meaning recipients of the benefits won\u2019t be able to purchase groceries or subsidized meals using the program until the government reopens.\n\u2014 New York City will be looking at buying the homes of residents in flood-prone areas, starting with the infamous Brooklyn/Queens neighborhood nicknamed \u201cThe Hole,\u201d The City\nreported\n. The effort is part of the Resilient Acquisitions program piloted by the Mayor\u2019s office, which began collecting information on Friday from residents interested in volunteering their homes for sale.\n\u2014 Several ballot questions on Tuesday will go towards speeding up the city\u2019s land use processes and removing some of the barriers to development, like the practice of member deference, where city council members give the ultimate thumbs-up or down to rezonings. That might mean that some council districts, like those of Councilmember Gale Brewer on the Upper West Side and Speaker Adrienne Adams in Queens, that have produced zero units of affordable housing this year as The City\nreported\n, will start ponying up their fair share.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$32 million\nfor 2126 East 4th Street. The three-story home in Gravesend is over 10,000 square feet. Seller Gindi Capital transferred the property in an off-market sale.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$31 million\nfor 245 Duffield Street. The two-story fitness center in Downtown Brooklyn is 25,000 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $16.5 million for 25 Central Park West, Unit 21Q. The Upper West Side duplex is 3,500 square feet.\nCorcoran\u2019s\nDenise Kelly and Michael Turtora have the listing.",

Al Sharpton out.\nAttorneys for an entity tied to Teitelbaum filed a petition to evict Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network from its headquarters on 145th Street in Harlem to make way for the long-awaited, 1,000-unit\napartment complex known as One45\n. NAN occupies a one-story building that will be demolished, along with other one- and two-story retail buildings, as part of the development.\nNAN\u2019s lease at 106-108 West 145th Street expired two years ago, but the term was extended six times, according to the developer\u2019s attorney. The most recent extension expired at the end of August, but the civil rights organization hasn\u2019t left.\nThe holdover petition was filed in September, and a spokesperson for NAN said on Friday that the organization has found a new location. But an attorney for the development team said on Friday that NAN has refused to leave.\n\u201cIt is deeply disappointing \u2014 though unfortunately not surprising \u2014 that Rev. Sharpton is now refusing to vacate the One45 site, despite more than a year of commitments and assurances that NAN would relocate,\u201d attorney Michael Cohen, who represents Teitelbaum, said in a statement.\nCohen said NAN is the only tenant that is holding up the project. The developer hopes to qualify for the\nnow-expired property tax break\n421a. To do so, the project must be completed by June 15, 2031. Delays threaten project financing and the developer\u2019s ability to meet that deadline.\nIn a response filed in court Oct. 28, an attorney for NAN wrote that the organization, given\nprevious extensions\n, expected to have the option to do so again and received no notice otherwise. The attorney also argues that the developer has hindered its ability to relocate by \u201cfalsely publicizing\u201d that NAN is behind on rent.\nCohen said NAN was given notice months in advance \u201cthat they needed to move by August 31 so construction could begin.\u201d A portion of the most recent lease extension agreement viewed by\nThe Real Deal\nstated that the tenant needed to leave the property at the end of the extension.\nWhen reached on Friday, NAN downplayed the dispute.\n\u201cNAN has located an amazing location in Harlem and is working out the details for that,\u201d a spokesperson for NAN said in a statement. \u201cNAN and the Landlord are coordinating the last day for NAN at the existing location.\u201d\nIt is not clear why the Oct. 28 court filing indicated a difficulty in finding a new location when NAN has already found one. Messages left for the attorney responsible for the filing were not returned.\nWhen told of NAN\u2019s statement, Cohen said the comments were \u201cencouraging to hear\u201d and that it was important that the matter is resolved \u201cwithout further delay.\u201d\nWhatever the extent of their dispute, at the very least, the parties haven\u2019t yet agreed on when NAN will leave its headquarters, potentially further delaying a project that has already faced several challenges.\nAfter years of delays, the City Council\napproved\nOne45 in July. The development is expected to consist of 1,000 units across three buildings. Of those apartments, at least 338 will be affordable. The developer agreed to negotiate with the city to potentially increase the number of\naffordable units to 591, but the developer has made clear that doing so will require public subsidies.\nThat approval came after Teitelbaum took the project nearly all the way through the city\u2019s land use review process, but withdrew it in 2022 when it became clear that the local Council member would reject it. He revived the project after the state extended the construction completion deadline for projects to qualify for 421a and once a new Council member was in place.\nAt one point, plans for One45 included offices for NAN and a civil rights museum founded by Sharpton and Judge Jonathan Lippman. Those plans fell apart, and the museum was pitched for\nanother project\n, a deal that also didn\u2019t materialize.\n",

        "content": "Mayor Karen Bass\nis using her power to foster faster rebuilding of Pacific Palisades businesses lost in the Palisades fire.\nThe mayor has issued Emergency Executive Order 10, which introduces measures intended to\nstreamline the rebuilding process\nfor commercial properties within the city\u2019s designated Palisades Commercial Village and Neighborhoods Specific Plan area, L.A. Business First\nreported\n.\nThe order cuts red tape by allowing expedited permitting and a five-year extension on existing land-use entitlements valid as of Jan. 7, 2025. The Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety will now allow licensed architects to self-certify compliance for certain tenant improvements, while local owners outside geohazard zones can skip bond requirements for small-scale repairs.\nIn addition, the order loosens procedural hurdles on soil and grading work, letting civil and geotechnical engineers self-certify site conditions. The goal is to quicken recovery for local storefronts and service businesses gutted by the deadly January blaze without jeopardizing the character of the area.\n\u201c\nSmall businesses\nare the heart and soul of the Palisades community, and I remain committed to helping them rebuild as quickly and safely as possible,\u201d Bass\nsaid\nin a statement. \u201cWith this new executive action, we are further streamlining the permitting process and cutting through unnecessary delays that will help business owners rebuild quickly, keep workers employed and restore community services that residents rely on, all while maintaining the unique community character of the Palisades.\u201d\nBass\u2019 latest demands follow Emergency Executive Order 8, issued in July to expedite the residential rebuilding process in the Palisades. Earlier this month, Bass called for\nexempting Palisades homeowners from Measure ULA\n, the city\u2019s mansion tax on sales over $5 million.\nResults are already showing, according to the city. Rebuilding permits for single-family homes in the Pacific Palisades are being approved nearly three times faster than before the fires, with over 1,100 plans approved and construction started on about 300 homes.\nThe City of Los Angeles has approved 1,142 plans and counting, and has issued 923 permits for 479 different addresses so far,\naccording\nto the city\u2019s rebuild progress dashboard.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Hugh Scott has followed San Francisco\u2019s real estate markets since the turn of the century. Walking down Market Street on Thursday afternoon, he considered the recent cycles of high and lows that give the city its Gold Rush ethos.\n\u201cThis is the biggest wave this city will see in terms of investment and growth in tech\nby a multiple of 3x\n,\u201d Scott said over the phone.\nHe is one of a handful of vice chairs for JLL, and represents tenants ranging from venture capital firms to tech startups. And while it might seem obvious that no two San Francisco booms are alike, Scott said one of the sharper distinctions between the current cycle and mid-aughts or pre-pandemic peak goes back to an industry fundamental: Location. He notes that many of the major companies headlining this next evolution, such as\nOpenAI\n,\nAnthropic\nand Perplexity, are headquartered in San Francisco, no longer confined to Silicon Valley.\nThat kind of presence has a gravitational pull on startups.\nTo-date in 2025, 83 artificial intelligence companies have leased nearly 1 million square feet of office space, according to JLL\u2019s Q3 reporting. Across all industries year-over-year, the brokerage reported 9.3 million square feet of office leasing activity in San Francisco, nearing pre-pandemic levels..\nYet, the city\u2019s office vacancy rate still hovers above 35%, and Scott said many of the negotiated leases with AI startups are short-term commitments of 30-36 months. A three-year lease doesn\u2019t bring the kind of stability as a decade, but the flexibility is critical to ensuring San Francisco remains a tech incubator, in Scott\u2019s telling.\n\u201cI think we shoot ourselves in the foot when we ask tech startups to sign a seven-to-10-year lease,\u201d Scott said. However, he acknowledged that the market could eventually swing back toward favoring the landlords. As the market gets tighter, he said, \u201cthe terms will get longer, rents get higher. But the landlords who draw a hard line now are those who won\u2019t get good activity.\u201d\nSwift\u2019s troubles cross the Bay Bridge\nNot all Bay Area office landlords are reaping the rewards of the latest boom, as more trouble appears to be afoot for San Francisco-based Swift Real Estate Partners.\nEarlier this month, Wells Fargo Bank began shopping around a distressed $102 million loan tied to a three-property portfolio owned by affiliates of Swift. The portfolio\nincluded a sprawling office plaza in Walnut Creek\n. Then news broke that Swift had stopped making payments on a 2015 loan for the Newhall Building at 260 California St, which housed the firm\u2019s San Francisco headquarters. The building had recently lost major tenants,\nand decreased in value by 60% since Swift purchased it in 2015\nfor $32.2 million.\nSwift was in the news again this week, after the San Francisco Business Times reported that China Construction Bank\nwas shopping around a $59 million loan taken out by Swift\nin 2019 to purchase a 10-story office building at 1333 Broadway St., in Oakland. The buyer who purchases the debt could also take ownership of the building, which is more than 74 percent leased and hosts a Walgreens and a Delta Dental.\nRepresentatives of Swift Real Estate Partners did not return The Real Deal\u2019s request for comment.\nGone Fishering\nAnd while San Francisco\u2019s office market ascends, Atherton\u2019s ritzy housing market has dropped. Well, relatively speaking in the national context of the wealthy enclave club. With a median home sale price of $8.3 million in 2025, the Silicon Valley enclave\u2019s 94027 zip code\nis no longer the nation\u2019s most expensive\n. The crown now rests on Fisher Island, in Miami-Dade County, where the median home sold for $9.5\nDespite a drop in the rankings, Atherton\u2019s housing market has continued to grow, notching a 5 percent increase in year-over-year home sale value. Just last week, tech venture capitalist John Jarve, of Menlo Ventures, listed his family\u2019s Atherton home for sale. The five-bedroom colonial-style house sits on 2.5 acres in the Lindenwood neighborhood. The listing agent, Charlene Cogan of Christie\u2019s, said the asking price \u201cwas outside the box for Lindenwood,\u201d an area in east Atherton where the most expensive homes often fetch below $20 million.\n",

        "content": "Earnings season comes with earnings calls, and one Los Angeles commercial real estate CEO this week showed how to work both ends of the expectations game that comes with publicly traded outfits.\nLos Angeles-based real estate investment trust Kilroy Realty\nreported\nnet income of $156.2 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30 compared to $52.4 million a year earlier. Revenue declined but not by much, with $279.7 million compared to $289.9 million a year ago.\nChief executive Angela Aman touted the firm\u2019s $205 million\npurchase\nof Maple Plaza, an office campus located in Beverly Hills. The three-story, 300,000 square-foot office space marked the company\u2019s entry to the wealthy Westside, and it might have given Aman one of the best earnings-call talking points since she took the CEO\u2019s job nearly two years ago.\nMaple Plaza was 75 percent leased at the time of purchase, and has since \u201cbecome the strongest driver of leasing activity in our Los Angeles portfolio,\u201d Aman said on the call.\nAnd that\u2019s saying a lot given Kilroy\u2019s Los Angeles portfolio encompasses 53 properties, more than 4.5 million square feet of rentable space, and is 74 percent occupied overall.\nAman and her crew told analysts and others on the call that the $5 billion company has inked more than 550,000 square feet of leases, new and renewals. Then she showed the other side of her CEO chops \u2014 managing expectations for next year, when 970,000 square feet of leases are set to expire. The company was staring at 1.9 million square feet before it locked down occupancy for about half the space with renewals. Aman said the company now anticipates \u201cmove-outs in 2026 for the majority of what\u2019s left in the expiration pool.\u201d\nThat\u2019s about 500,000 square feet, if you apply mathematics to the earnings-call narrative. Aman said the hope is to chip away at the pending expirations via new leasing.\nThe market seemed to like the overall story, in any case, sending Kilroy shares trading higher on earnings in the wake of the earnings report.\nHudson Pacific pending\nSpooky season is over but earnings season isn\u2019t. Victor Coleman\u2019s Hudson Pacific Properties reports earnings next Wednesday, and that is one we\u2019re paying particular attention to after the company posted hundreds of millions in financial\nlosses\n.\nBren ditches downtown SD\nThe country\u2019s richest developer, Donald Bren, is all out of offices in downtown San Diego. The billionaire\u2019s Irvine Company ended its reign as the largest office landlord in downtown \u2014 and its presence.\nThe company\ndumped\nits last office tower: One American Plaza, a 34-story, 650,000-square-foot property.\nJohn Saca and daughter Payton Saca purchased the real estate for $120 million \u2014 Bren\u2019s company paid about $300 million for it in 2006.\nHe appeared to have wanted out of the area, and the deal marked the end of his discount selling spree that began with the Symphony Towers in 2024.\nThis happens to be the second occasion the Sacas and Bren were in business. In November last year, John Saca\u2019s Saca Development purchased another Irvine Company-owned office building in downtown San Diego for about $44 million, or less than a third of what Bren\u2019s company paid for the tower in 2005.\nIt\u2019s uncharacteristic for Bren to sell, especially at such discounts, which makes the recent deals something more akin to tea leaves than standard comps.\nArt Deco gem in receivership\nA couple months ago, we posed a question: Does Rockwood have time to save Santa Monica Clock Tower?\nThe clock has struck midnight, it seems and the office tower is in the receiver\u2019s hands now.\nThe court\nappointed\na receiver to take control of the property that was once the tallest in the city after special servicer Rialto Capital\nsued\nRockwood Capital, alleging that the Santa Monica Clock tower owner defaulted on commercial mortgage-backed securities debt connected to the property, and owed about $25 million. \u200b\u200b\nRockwood, according to court documents, consented to a receiver in hopes of a sale. Earlier, servicer commentary noted Rockwood expressed interest in transferring the title back to the lender \u2014 after the loan landed in special servicing and the property that is only 43 percent occupied received a value haircut.\nHonoring the late Nelson Rising\nEarlier in October, the Rose Bowl Legacy Foundation dedicated the Nelson C. Rising Legacy Bridge at the Rose Bowl Stadium. The late Nelson Rising was known for the part he played in developing Los Angeles\u2019 skyline. His son Christopher Rising, who now helms Rising Realty Partners, was there to honor his father.\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s official: the mantra \u201csurvive \u2018til \u201825\u201d turned out to be too soon.\nIt\u2019s almost 2026, and most of Texas real estate is still struggling to hold on.\nEven with another dip this week, mortgage rates continue to scare off would-be homebuyers. And every time the office market seems to hit rock bottom it turns out to be a landing that leads to another downward flight of stairs.\nThroughout commercial real estate, it seems, most assets are worse off today than they were in 2020 \u2014 except in one case:\ncountry clubs\n.\nResidential markets generally remain ahead of their 2020 benchmarks, thanks the pandemic runup, but have more recently been edging downward.\nMultifamily and office developers have been gritting their teeth through the last few years.\nNo such problems for member-owned country clubs, which saw a 27 percent average jump in values nationwide from 2020 and 2023, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n, after reviewing IRS filings from thousands of clubs.\nMember-owned country clubs often claim tax-exempt status by meeting certain IRS requirements for \u201csocial clubs.\u201d The exemption comes with a requirement for some public filings that provide insights on their financials.\nHouston Country Club topped the list of most valuable member-owned clubs in Texas, with its value swelling 35 percent, from $109.6 million to $147.9 million over the three-year- period. Dallas Country Club finished with a slightly lower value but a bigger increase over the period, making a 44 percent jump from $89.6 million to $128.4 million.\nThe hot streak tracks to clubs making moves to not only capitalize on the pandemic-fueled golf craze\u2013ovbiously right in their wheelhouses\u2013 but also double down by adding top-of-the-line amenities to match the latest fads, with cold plunges and infrared saunas a\u00a0 couple of examples.\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that the top Austin home sale last week was\na new build with access to Barton Springs Country Club\n.\nThe spec mansion at 4312 Amarra Drive was listed at $3.5 million and sold without a price cut \u2014 a rarity in\ntoday\u2019s luxury market\n. Heyl Homes built the 3,300-square-foot home with three bedrooms and two bathrooms.\nThe selling point isn\u2019t the open floorplan or the vaulted ceiling beams of exposed wood; it\u2019s the fact that it\u2019s an 8-minute walk to a golf course designed by legendary golf course designer Tom Fazio.\nMembership to the elite Hill Country club, meanwhile,\u00a0 confers access to the Omni Barton Creek Resort &amp; Spa as well as the club\u2019s four golf courses, fitness center and tennis club, but it comes at a hefty price: the initiation fee reportedly tops $100,000, plus there\u2019s a monthly fee of about $1,000.\nHere\u2019s what else happened in Texas real estate this week:\nNitya Capital\u2019s Swapnil Agarwal says the loan backed by two of his apartment complexes\nwent to special servicing\nfor \u201ccode violations.\u201d But Morningstar Credit data shows the Houston-based syndicator hasn\u2019t made its most recent payment for the $66 million loan.\nOn the bright side, the\nauction of this Far North Dallas office building\ncould be a great redevelopment opportunity! On the not-so-bright-side, bids start at a mere $2.25 million or $8.65 per square foot for the 10-story, 260,000-square-foot property, giving the Dallas office market an opportunity to log a new bottom.\nD.R. Horton is trying to lure homebuyers back to the market with\nincentives\nlike rate buydowns and closing-cost assistance. Word came in an earnings call where the Arlington-based company reported that profits sank 25 percent to $3.62 billion for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.\nMeanwhile,\nstatewide housing supply\nis the highest it\u2019s been since 2012. Texas had 5.5 months of inventory last month \u2014 the highest it\u2019s been since surpassing six months in 2012. Supply in major metros has surpassed the post-recession waterline. Dallas had 4.8 months of inventory in September. Both Austin and Houston had 5.4 months. In September 2012, when the housing market had finally stabilized from the Great Financial Crisis, Dallas had 4.2 months of inventory; Austin had 3.6 and Houston had 4.8.\nThe Salty Donut isn\u2019t worth its salt, if you ask its lender, City National Bank of Florida. The\nbank sued the confectionery\nin August, claiming it defaulted on a $4.8 million loan the bank provided so The Salty could develop a new store in Houston. The store never materialized. It did open a Katy location in 2024, but the donut maker\u2019s first Houston outpost doesn\u2019t appear on its website.\n",

        "content": "The Pastorelli family\u2019s Fulton Market property has become a case study in what happens when sellers fall in love with their own price tag.\nThe longtime home of\nPastorelli Food Products at 901 West Lake Street\nis the subject of a foreclosure lawsuit filed Wednesday by Old Second National Bank \u2014 a $3 million reckoning that caps nearly a decade of missed opportunities in Chicago\u2019s hottest neighborhood.\nRichard Pastorelli and entities tied to his company defaulted on a $3.4 million loan that matured in May, leaving more than $3 million unpaid plus interest piling up at over $1,000 a day. That\u2019s according to Old Second\u2019s legal complaint filed Wednesday, which shows the mortgage traces back to 2020.\nNeither Pastorelli nor\nOld Second\u2019s\nattorney returned requests for comment.\nIn any case, the 12,500-square-foot site\u2019s best chance appears to have come in 2016, when Pastorelli \u2014 a fifth-generation operator of the family foodstuffs business \u2014 first floated it for sale.\nMultiple developers made offers, but Pastorelli soon gained a reputation for pushing his luck on a quest for eight figures. Several developers have said his expectation was clearly out of step with the market for teardown industrial sites poised for residential or mixed-use plays.\nPastorelli might have gotten a reality check from recent turns in the market, but he still seems out of step. Multiple developers told me the property owner called seeking a deal at $12 million, only to be shrugged off. Another neighborhood real estate pro said the market is no longer anywhere near such a price.\nEven Sterling Bay \u2014 builder of Google\u2019s and McDonald\u2019s corporate offices in Fulton Market \u2014 has\ntaken a loss\non land in the area recently.\nRelated Midwest\u2019s plan to build a\n43-story apartment tower next door\nto Pastorelli\u2019s property, which it completed in 2023, probably offered Pastorelli his widest offramp.\nEven if Related didn\u2019t offer to buy it (a source told me the firm did), the fact of its project going forward would likely have drawn other interest in the Pastorelli property \u2014 if the owner had been reasonable on price.\nPastorelli\u2019s price wasn\u2019t a complete pipe dream. Land values in Fulton Market were skyrocketing before the pandemic.\nBut there\u2019s some difficulty on the Pastorelli site to contend with: it already holds a 25,000-square-foot building, and even with zoning that brokers over the years have said would allow a 12- to 14-story building, there are \u201cL\u201d tracks running along Lake Street next door. Some developers question whether they could build that big due to the site\u2019s size and location inside a historic district. That all makes redevelopment a little more tricky and costly.\nStill, by 2024, with Related having recently completed the 300-unit development project next door, the Pastorelli plant again hit the market, this time under a more formal listing with\nJLL\n. The site, zoned for dense development, drew curiosity but no buyers willing to meet ownership\u2019s number.\nThat\u2019s the rub in this story: a hot neighborhood doesn\u2019t mitigate the gamble that comes with holding out for an ambitious price. Pastorelli bet that Fulton Market\u2019s land values would keep rising faster than developers\u2019 pro formas. Instead, the market moved on, interest rates spiked, and lenders grew less patient. Now, Old Second is asking a judge to foreclose, name a receiver and auction off the property to cover the debt.\nIt\u2019s a cautionary tale for every owner convinced their dirt is worth more than the last guy\u2019s \u2014 especially in a submarket that rewards velocity over nostalgia. Fulton Market has minted fortunes for those who sold or built at the right time. But wait too long, and even\na prime corner\ncan turn from opportunity to liability.\nRelated\u2019s tower has already risen next door, reshaping the skyline. The Pastorelli site, meanwhile, could end up a footnote in the very boom that transformed the longtime home of food businesses in Fulton Market.",

That involved Los Angeles Rams owner\nStan Kroenke\n, who paid $23.8 million for his condo. It\u2019s also Beverly Hills\u2019s priciest on-market condo trade over the past year.\nThere\u2019s more.\nOctober\u2019s deal is now Los Angeles County\u2019s second priciest condo sale in the past 12 months. No. 1 is a penthouse unit at\nThe Century\nin Century City, after it sold for $39.1 million in January.\nLuxury insulation\nDeals like the one at the Maybourne weren\u2019t enough to help pull up the overall condo market. Across Los Angeles County, median condo closing prices fell the past two quarters, according to the most recent Douglas Elliman report.\nLuxury tells a different story, with a rising median\nprice\n, according to the Elliman report which counts luxury as the top 10 percent of sales.\nThe broad comparison is stark\u2013the median price of a sold luxury condo spiked 69 percent from the year-ago period to $4.7 million in the third quarter, according to Elliman. That compares with the broader condo market\u2019s median sales price decline of 3.8 percent year over year to $1.1 million.\nTops this year\nWhat L.A.-area markets are winning this year? So far,\u00a0 the usual suspects are driving the upper end of the condo market. Here\u2019s a look at the top deals in some of the county\u2019s high-end residential markets this year, based on Zillow records of on-market sales:\nCentury City\n1 West Century Drive #Penthouse 39\nSold in January for $39.1 million or $4,153 per square foot\nBeverly Hills\n225 North Canon Drive #8E\nSold in October for $27M or $4,762 per square foot\nWest Hollywood\n8899 Beverly Boulevard Unit 7B/E\nSold in March for $15.5M or $2,886 per square foot\nBrentwood\n505 Barrington Avenue #100\nSold in September for $7.8M or $1,400 per square foot\nSanta Monica\n951 Ocean Avenue #404\nSold in March for $7.3M or $2,330 per square foot\nHollywood Hills\n8420 Sunset Boulevard #803\nSold in July for $7.2M or $2,647 per square foot\nMarina del Rey\n5205 Ocean Front Walk #301\nSold in January for $4.9M or $1,789 per square foot\nThe Westside spread makes Downtown Los Angeles look quite middle market. The\u00a0 top deal in the city\u2019s center comes in at $1.8 million, or $766 per square foot, for a unit at 1155 South Grand Avenue.\nCrescent Heights conversion\nSouth of L.A., in Orange County, Crescent Heights clearly sees opportunity in for-sale units.\nThe Miami company hung up the for-sale sign on the towers\u2019 units after snapping up\n9 MacArthur Place\nin April for $240 million, per the\nOrange County Business Journal\n.\nA full price range isn\u2019t known for the two towers, but units currently listed go from $851,825 to $1.1 million.\nLori Loughlin, Mossimo Giannulli find buyer\nIn single-family homes news,\nLori Loughlin and Mossimo Giannulli\nmay finally be able to part ways with their Hidden Hills home.\nThe property at 25210 Jim Bridger Road, listed for just under $15 million, is in contract. It topped the week ended Oct. 26 for signed contracts in L.A. County.\nIt\u2019s been a long time coming for the now separated couple, who reportedly first placed the home on the market last spring for $17.5 million. It was re-listed in February for $16.5 million and then repriced again in July at the current ask.\n",

        "content": "The Real Deal\n\u2018s Miami Forum is this week. Don\u2019t go unprepared: Here\u2019s a primer on the South Florida real estate market.\nMacro issues are affecting the tri-county region. President Trump\u2019s immigration policies threaten population growth in South Florida, which trickles down to fewer renters signing leases and an overall drop in consumer spending that affects other sectors of the real estate market. Developers have learned how to navigate the tariff landmines. It\u2019s the thinning profit margins, driven by the high cost of land, construction and insurance, that are having a bigger impact. More projects\nwill be canceled\nor sold to new partnerships that plan to revive them.\nBefore we get too into it, the event will be held at Mana Wynwood in Miami on Wednesday and Thursday (Nov. 5 and 6). If you haven\u2019t purchased your ticket yet, use the code WEEKLYDIRT and\nthis link\nfor 20 percent off general admission. Here\u2019s a link to\nthe schedule\n.\nMy colleagues and I will be moderating key conversations about market headwinds and opportunities, what resi brokerages owe their agents (and what they don\u2019t), the next generation of office space, how developers and brokers are recapturing the international investor, the keys to leveraging social media, the growing role that architecture and interior design play in high-end sales, and more.\nOur Publisher, Amir Korangy, will also lead separate, one-on-one conversations with controversial investors Grant Cardone and Patrick Carroll.\nHere are dispatches from our South Florida team, based on what we\u2019ve been hearing from sources and speakers ahead of the event:\nResidential boom is uneven\nDemand for luxury waterfront homes continues, but the condo market is a bit more irregular. Agents are also banking on another wave of New Yorkers migrating to South Florida, in this case driven by the mayoral election in New York. Corcoran Group agent Mick Duchon said that these deals don\u2019t happen overnight. State Rep. Zohran Mamdani\u2019s expected win will just propel New Yorkers who have been thinking about or planning a move already.\n\u201cThese transactions are weeks, months and sometimes years in the marking,\u201d Duchon said.\nCondo developers are coming out of a tough summer. Some have found their sweet spot with\u00a0 more affordable projects geared toward short-term rental investors, while others are seeing success in ultra-luxury boutique properties. But the oversaturation of branded projects (or just using the wrong brand) has made it increasingly difficult to sell condos.\nThe general resale market, which has seen months\u2019 worth of year-over-year declines, rallied in\nSeptember\n. Dollar volume in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties surged 13 percent to $4.3 billion, up from $3.8 billion last September, according to the Miami Association of Realtors. But while sales were up, condo prices were either flat or down across the tri-county region. Single-family prices were either flat or showed moderate growth. The level of price growth we saw post-pandemic is gone.\nForeclosures ahead\nSouth Florida has seen an uptick in lenders foreclosing on development sites where projects have not broken ground, and one case where a builder lost the property. Rok Lending, the mortgage arm of the Rok family, acquired an Aventura development site owned by an affiliate of Miami-based developer Marlon Gomez. The developer, who filed a notice of appeal, had planned a medical office project.\nBrian Tuttle, the owner of the mixed-use Mainstreet at Tuttle development site in Royal Palm Beach narrowly avoided a foreclosure auction by filing for bankruptcy on the same day the property was set to be sold at a foreclosure auction. And in recent months, lenders have filed foreclosure lawsuits against an entity managed by developer\nHarvey Hernandez\n, which owns a Fort Lauderdale condo development site; as well as an entity previously managed by developer Dan Kodsi, which owns a condo-hotel development site in Miami\u2019s Art &amp; Entertainment District. Kodsi told\nThe Real Deal\nthat he is no longer involved.\n\u2014 Francisco Alvarado\nSouth Florida\u2019s apartment construction boom carries on\nThis is despite a current supply overhang and a slowdown in leasing and rent growth compared to the pandemic-era peak. Last year, a record 18,600 units were completed in the tri-county region, which outpaced new leases by more than 3,000 units. Median asking rents are also decreasing on a year-over-year basis. Some developers and landlords have been offering concessions. But apartment developers overall\nremain optimistic\nand believe demand will return by the time new projects are completed.\nOffice market leveling out\nSouth Florida\u2019s office investment sales market showed a slight pickup over the past year. But it\u2019s not all great news, as leasing by new-to-market firms has slowed compared to the pandemic boom. While institutional investors are coming back to the market to purchase office buildings, they\u2019re carefully picking trophy properties in deals that are few and far between.\nCase in point: In the fourth quarter of last year, Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Investment Management paid $443 million for the 701 Brickell Avenue tower in Miami\u2019s financial district. By comparison, the top office deal so far this calendar year was done by a family office. Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega\u2019s Ponte Gadea, an investment vehicle for Ortega\u2019s dividends from his retail empire, paid $274 million for the Sabadell Financial Center in Brickell.\nEven for those deals, cap rates were higher amid the higher interest rate environment and harder financing climate for offices, experts said. Also, many lenders have redlined offices and are making no exceptions for South Florida.\nAnd many of the planned office projects announced during the recent market bonanza are on hold or have been canceled.\n\u2014 Lidia Dinkova\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nTuesday\u2019s election. Go vote!\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential:\nPinchas and Lindsay Goldshtein sold the waterfront, single-family home at 10241 East Broadview Drive in Bay Harbor Islands to Garfield RE LLC for $12.8 million.\nCommercial:\nBoca Raton-based Penn-Florida Companies sold the development site at 375 East Royal Palm Road in Boca Raton for $27 million. SobelCo, also based in Boca Raton, purchased the property, as well as the adjacent 0.2-acre site at 343 East Royal Palm Road for $3.1 million.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nAn oceanfront mansion in Palm Beach hit the market for $89 million. The six-bedroom, eight-and-a-half-bathroom, 8,259-square-foot home at\n102 Reef Road\nsits on a 0.8-acre lot. It\u2019s listed with Christian Angle of Christian Angle Real Estate. Property records show C. Steven Duncker, a retired partner at Goldman Sachs and a thoroughbred horse racing figure, and his wife, Melinda, own the home, which was built in 2014. They paid $6.3 million for the property in 2011.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nGive Miami Day is Nov. 20. The 24-hour fundraising event collects and distributes contributions to more than 1,300 nonprofits, including\nthese\nhousing-related organizations.\nElsewhere in Florida\nGov. Ron DeSantis directed Florida\u2019s Board of Governors to \u201ccrack down\u201d on the use of H-1B visas at state colleges and universities, the\nTallahassee Democrat\nreports. DeSantis accused the schools of hiring foreign workers over qualified Americans.\nThe last remaining Royal Castle in Miami closed its doors. The decades-old location of the burger chain on Northwest 79th Street and 27th Avenue is now vacant and available for lease, according to the\nMiami Herald\n.\nElected officials and food banks in South Florida are warning of a crisis if the government shutdown halts food assistance programs like SNAP, which one in four Miami-Dade households rely on,\nNBC Miami\nreports. Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said local agencies are preparing for a surge in need.\nMiami Dolphins general manager Chris Grier and franchise owner Steve Ross parted ways following the team\u2019s disappointing 2-6 start to the 2025 season, according to the\nHerald\n. Ross said the move marks the beginning of needed changes.",

Specifically, four land-use reforms on the ballot.\nThe far left\u2019s split on proposed City Charter revisions is a major reason that their candidate for mayor, Zohran Mamdani, has been so hesitant to take a position, unlike on all other issues.\nLeft-wing writer Michael Kinnucan\nexplained\nthe socialists\u2019 split in the publication Jacobin, a bible of the far left: Some tenant organizations oppose the reforms because they would reduce individual City Council members\u2019 leverage to demand more affordability.\nThe problem with that argument is that some use their leverage to stop projects entirely, for NIMBY reasons by demanding too much affordability.\nThat\u2019s one reason Kinnucan did the right thing and endorsed a \u201cyes\u201d vote on the ballot questions, which will tweak the rezoning process to modestly increase housing production, including affordable projects in the neighborhoods most resistant to them.\nThe headline: \u201cYou can\u2019t have social housing without building housing.\u201d\nSeems obvious, no? But even obvious facts about real estate are hard to see for people wearing ideological blinders.\n\u201cLoosening the city\u2019s anti-housing regime is essential if we ever want to build social housing at scale,\u201d he wrote, wisely focusing on subsidized housing to appeal to his readers, even though privately funded housing is at least as important to solving today\u2019s supply crisis and preventing future ones. (See the Minneapolis Fed\u2019s study on\nfiltering\n.)\nLongtime advocacy group Tenants PAC outright lied to its followers about the charter proposals, telling them \u201cthere is no affordability mandate whatsoever.\u201d Reality check: With rare exception, the proposals only work with Mandatory Inclusionary Housing or the even deeper affordability required by Department of Housing Preservation and Development or housing finance agency term sheets.\n\nThe rare exception is in the R1 to R5 \u201cElurp\u201d action because those zoning designations don\u2019t include affordability. The charter cannot magically add it any more than a frog can grow wings.\nTenants PAC also claimed that Proposal 3 lets some projects grow in size by 30 percent \u201con top of the 40 percent granted by City of Yes earlier this year.\u201d City of Yes (which passed last year) allows those projects a 20 percent increase, not 40 percent, and only if they have enough affordable units.\nThe Jacobin article called the opposition \u201can odd coalition, uniting conservatives who systematically oppose virtually all construction, including affordable construction, with tenant activists who support massive city investment in social housing.\u201d\nKinnucan added that Mamdani\u2019s social housing plan would be \u201cnear impossible\u201d without the charter revisions.\n\u201cIf the city\u2019s social housing program is subject to the unappealable veto of every individual city council member, every development will require months of negotiation over building heights and parking minimums, and much of the city\u2019s land area will be quite simply off limits,\u201d he wrote.\nWhy is rezoning even necessary? Because we can\u2019t build our way out of the crisis without it when 40 percent of the city is zoned for single- or two-family housing and 30 percent is low-density multifamily.\nThe\nmember-deference\nsystem, Kinnucan told his fellow lefties, has produced \u201ca crippling housing shortage that gives landlords the upper hand against tenants.\u201d\nWhy Tenants PAC wants to preserve it is baffling indeed.",

        "content": "At 32 years old, Moshe Silber had it all.\nSilber owned two Gulfstream jets, a pad in London, three multimillion-dollar homes and millions worth of luxury cars and jewelry.\nSilber, a lanky and youthful-looking native of an Orthodox enclave in Rockland County, was on his way to becoming extremely wealthy in 2022, at least on paper. He claimed to have $1.3 billion in total assets with his equity position at over $600 million.\nSilber\u2019s quick rise and growing real estate portfolio of 10,000 units impressed the bankers at Piper Sandler, and the investment bank offered its clients and employees a chance to get in on Silber\u2019s real estate play.\nPiper Sandler worked with\nSilber\nto issue $200 million of unsecured bonds in one of Silber\u2019s companies, Crown Capital Holdings, through a private placement. The money would be used to fund and purchase real estate, mainly consisting of Section 8 housing. Large and small life insurers, community banks and some high-level Piper Sandler employees bought the notes offering rates between 6.75 percent and 12.5 percent.\nSince the bonds were unsecured with no properties pledged as collateral, the investment relied on Silber, the whiz-kid from Monsey, who survived a difficult childhood and amassed a real estate empire out of an office on the 85th floor of One World Trade Center.\nIn the best-case scenario, the $200 million would go into Crown Capital to buy real estate at a lower interest rate, allowing Silber to flip the properties at a higher price, and increase cash flow to investors.\nBut, according to the bondholders and a fiduciary appointed to oversee Silber\u2019s former companies, that is not what happened. Instead, Silber was charged and\nsentenced\nin\na mortgage fraud scheme\n. No one is quite sure where all the money went.\nB\nirth of an entrepreneur\nMoshe Silber was born in Brooklyn and moved to Monsey when he was 12.\nHis father, Zalman Silber, was an entrepreneur best known for Skyline Entertainment, a company that offered virtual helicopter rides inside the Empire State Building in the late \u201990s and early 2000s.\nIn about 2008, Zalman faced serious allegations as he underwent a divorce. Silber\u2019s mother accused Zalman of performing fake \u201cgynecological exams\u201d on her, according to news articles from the time. The accusations led to Zalman\u2019s arrest and charges brought by the Manhattan District Attorney and Rockland County and some crude headlines in the press. Moshe was also questioned by law enforcement.\nThe charges against Zalman were dropped when Silber\u2019s mother lied under oath on an unrelated matter, according to press reports.\nMoshe\u2019s parents divorced. Meanwhile, Zalman ventured overseas on business to Australia.\n\u201cHe [Moshe] was completely unloved. And he had, you know, a terrible time as a young man. He was terribly scarred,\u201d Jerome Ballarotto, an attorney for Moshe Silber, said years later, during Silber\u2019s fraud-sentencing hearing.\nBallarotto said Moshe experienced his mother\u2019s wrath, but also \u201cspent a lifetime chasing the shadow of his father\u2019s approval.\u201d\n\u201cConfounding.\u201d\nU.S. JUDGE ROBERT KIRSCH ON MOSHE SILBER\u2019S FINANCIAL SITUATION\nAfter graduating from a yeshiva in Brooklyn, Moshe Silber went into real estate in 2010. He worked with a large operator controlling 5,000 units in New York City where he claimed to be in charge of all \u201coperations, including rent collections, maintenance and repairs, lease negotiations, tenant buy-outs and building refinancings,\u201d according to an SEC filing.\nOutside of work, he became a volunteer EMT in Rockland County, going out days and nights and once reportedly saving a child\u2019s life by performing CPR. He got married, had six kids and moved into a house in Suffern with eight bedrooms and eight bathrooms. People have described him as a nice, unassuming young man and devoted father who happened to have expensive tastes. His attorney, noting Moshe\u2019s work as an EMT, referred to his client as a \u201ccaped crusader.\u201d\nAt a certain point, Silber became connected with Fred Schulman, a lawyer with a degree from Boston College, three decades older than Silber.\nWhile Schulman saw himself as a father figure to the younger Silber, it appears that Silber was the brains of the real estate operation. In 2012, Silber, then in his early 20s, created Rhodium Capital, which he described as a \u201creal estate syndicator.\u201d He also founded a real estate holding company, CBRM.\nSilber\u2019s companies bought mostly low-income real estate across the U.S., including in New York City, where Rhodium paid $98 million, or $394 per square foot, for 361 rental apartments in Harlem and Washington Heights in 2016. Other acquisitions included a 462-unit portfolio in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and office buildings in Jersey City and Somerset, New Jersey.\nHis wealth grew rapidly in the Covid years when cheap interest rates created a bonanza for investors like Silber who started buying real estate.\nBy early 2022, Silber had surpassed his industry contemporaries with master\u2019s degrees from Columbia University or internships at Blackstone or KKR. He owned multiple real estate companies, a private jet business with planes valued at $60 million, and a bank in Westchester County. His real estate holdings totaled nearly $1 billion. Silber did not return a request for comment and an attorney representing Silber in bankruptcy proceedings declined to comment.\nAnd he had discovered a shortcut to the traditional real estate financing model.\nU\nnderwriting Silber\nIn a normal real estate deal, a sponsor raises equity from investors for a property. The remainder is financed with debt from lenders. The sponsor makes money from rent, but the real returns come years later when the owner refinances or sells.\nSilber removed the property from the equation.\nIn 2020, Silber appears to have gotten a line of credit somewhere between $75 million and $100 million from an affiliate of UBS\u2019s hedge fund O\u2019Connor for Silber\u2019s companies, Crown Capital and CBRM. Filings with the state of New York show Silber pledged collateral for the loan in 2020. A source familiar with the situation said Silber repaid the loan from UBS in 2022.\nThe line seemed to establish that Crown was creditworthy.\nBy the first quarter of 2022, Minneapolis-based\u00a0 Piper Sandler was underwriting a new private debt issuance \u2014 this time, bonds. Crown Capital, which indirectly owned real estate through various LLCs, would issue the debt as a private placement. While it is not unusual for large companies or REITS to issue bonds to finance their real estate operations, it is uncommon for a company of Silber\u2019s size and obscurity to do so. REITS are publicly traded and are required to disclose financials to their public investors. Private companies do not have the same obligations.\nIt is unclear how Silber became connected with Piper Sandler in the first place.\nPiper Sandler is a six-year-old investment bank formed from the merger of two older companies, Piper Jaffray, a 130-year-old Minneapolis investment bank that specialized in servicing mid-market companies, and Sandler O\u2019Neill, started by former Bear Stearns executives in New York City in 1988. Sandler\u2019s idea was to work with small firms whose value its founders thought went underappreciated on Wall Street, and it built an early fixed-income desk, which it rebuilt after 40 percent of its employees were killed on Sept. 11, 2001. When Piper Jaffray bought Sandler O\u2019Neill in 2019, it was hoping to double its fixed-income revenue, the firms told the Wall Street Journal.\n\u201cMoney and material wealth do not define who we are. True fulfillment comes from serving others. Somewhere along the way, I lost sight of what truly mattered. I let money and a deal take priority over everything.\u201d\nMoshe Silber at his sentencing for mortgage fraud\nOver the course of 2022, Piper Sandler privately underwrote three rounds of bonds on Crown. It was part of a wave of interest in private placements, where companies can issue debt in the private market to accredited investors. This type of debt has become increasingly common with life insurers as they search for higher returns for cash. Privately placed debt accounts for 20 percent of life insurers\u2019 bond investments in 2022, compared to 13 percent in 2004, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.\nBuyers of the Silber bonds included Customers Bank, Federated Mutual Insurance, Cincinnati Life Insurance Co and a list of midsize insurance firms and banks, including First Catholic Slovak Union, Western Catholic Union, First Dakota National Bank, Bar Harbor Bank &amp; Trust and Ukrainian National Association.\nIts own employees also bought in, including senior managers from the Sandler side: Edward Stein, Jacques de Saint Phalle and John Beckelman. Beckelman is head of Piper Sandler\u2019s fixed-income division and on the firm\u2019s leadership team. In total, the three Piper employees purchased $2.3 million of Crown\u2019s paper.\nThe Real Deal was unable to review the bond offering, but sources indicate that it was persuasive. The fundamentals of the firm seemed strong. Silber and his real estate holding company, CBRM, had $66 million sitting in various checking accounts as of March 2022, Silber\u2019s financial statements show. Silber had $219 million in equity interests in properties held by CBRM, he claimed, giving him skin in the game. His dozens of multifamily rental properties had solid cash flow, with predictable revenue from tenants in subsidized federal housing programs. At the time of the appraisals in 2021 and 2022, multifamily valuations were at an all-time high.\nAs part of the private offering, Silber offered a guarantee in Crown\u2019s parent company, CBRM, of which Silber was the sole shareholder. If Silber defaulted, bondholders could pursue Silber or his company, but they could not immediately seize Crown\u2019s properties.\nBy December, clients had picked up $200 million in Silber bonds.\nD\nouble dipping\nIn practice, the bonds were an ingenious way to finance real estate, but in actuality, the money was like a blank check.\nBondholders did not have a lien or a secured interest in the properties that had made the firm look so creditworthy.\nSilber controlled Crown\u2019s books, records and the financials that were ultimately presented to them.\nAnd so, at least some of the bondholders did not appear to know about the extent of Silber\u2019s leverage, which saddled the properties with a total of $450 million in property-level mortgages.\nLenders on Silber\u2019s properties were also in the dark. They were not aware there was such a vast sum in bond financing for the same buildings, according to sources familiar with the matter.\nAccording to sources familiar with the matter, Silber took a distribution not long after the bond issuance. The amount: $90 million.\nAn independent fiduciary and financial advisors are investigating the exact whereabouts of the rest. The fiduciary who took over Silber\u2019s firm alleges that he extracted at least tens of millions and possibly hundreds of millions of dollars for his own benefit, according to the fiduciary\u2019s attorney.\nD\nefault and disarray\nAfter the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in 2022, Silber\u2019s financing costs increased and values of his multifamily holdings declined.\nThe portfolio started to collapse. By 2023, the Department of Justice and the Federal Housing and Finance Agency were looking into Schulman and Silber for their involvement in a mortgage fraud scheme.\nThe scheme, one of many being investigated by the DOJ, involved investors flipping properties to affiliates at higher prices than they\u2019d just paid in order to secure inflated loans. (Silber\u2019s scheme was particularly bold because he used a stolen identity instead of an actual associate to facilitate the flip, resulting in a $74 million inflated loan from Fannie Mae and JLL.)\nSilber and Schulman prioritized defending possible criminal charges, which stole focus from their real estate operations, according to court filings.\nProperties fell into disarray and Silber lost eligibility for affordable housing programs, which had sustained his rent rolls. Without revenue, he defaulted on loan obligations, according to a report from a financial advisor to the debtor in bankruptcy court.\nIn 2024, Silber pleaded guilty to the mortgage fraud scheme, and Silber and his partner Schulman effectively became unbankable.\nSilber agreed to appoint an independent fiduciary, Elizabeth LaPuma, and management company, Lynd, to oversee his properties. Silber still remained the sole shareholder.\nHe also looked to obtain financing from high-interest lenders of last resort to ensure he did not default on bond payments by providing personal guarantees and a pledge of assets.\nOther lenders started going after Silber personally on guarantees.\nT\nwice pledged\nBoth UBS O\u2019Connor and the bondholders had a claim on CBRM, they soon discovered.\nIn mid-2024, a New York state judge issued UBS O\u2019Connor a default judgment. A company called Spano Investor acquired the judgment and then put CBRM, which controlled Crown Capital\u2019s real estate, u\np for auction\n.\nDays before the auction, the fiduciary of Crown Capital and CBRM put the entities into bankruptcy protection, to stop the sale, listing the bondholders as unsecured creditors with a $200 million claim.\nAmong the bondholders, the largest claims came from Customers Bank and Federated Life Insurance with unsecured claims of $41.5 million and $32 million. A total of 69 insurance companies, banks and Piper Sandler employees have claims on Crown Capital.\nThe debtors set up a litigation trust to pursue possible claims against Silber, Schulman and even Piper Sandler.\n\u201cWe are aware of the bankruptcy of Crown Capital Holdings and have monitored the events concerning Moshe Silber that preceded it,\u201d a spokesperson for Piper Sandler said. \u201cThe situation is deeply disappointing and is likely to have a negative impact on our clients and our own employees.\u201d\nW\nhat truly matters\nIn March 2025, a judge sentenced Silber to 30 months in prison for participating in the mortgage fraud scheme.\nSix months later, while in prison, Silber filed for bankruptcy. Not only was the $200 million gone, his filing showed, but so was everything else \u2014 the jewelry, jets and London flat.\nHe listed zeros for his assets and income and claimed his father Zalman paid his legal fees.\nAt his recent deposition taken in prison, Silber pleaded the Fifth. In a typewritten letter from prison, Silber attributed the properties\u2019 poor state to the management company and the independent restructuring officer.\nYet Silber\u2019s father was giving him about $300,000 a month, or over $3 million a year, U.S. Judge Robert Kirsch noted. Silber\u2019s attorneys said this money went to keep his real estate operations afloat.\nSilber\u2019s financial situation overall was \u201cconfounding,\u201d Kirsch said: Silber was affiliated with over 184 LLCs and had 300 bank accounts. His house was valued at $1.7 million; he had BMWs and Mercedes and possibly a boat. Yet he claimed to have nothing.\nBondholders are calculating their losses. They could get repaid for a piece of their investment through bankruptcy; for example, if four of Crown\u2019s New Orleans properties sell at a profit, bondholders would get up to 30 percent of the proceeds.\nBut some aren\u2019t counting on anything. One bondholder, Thompson IM Funds, marked the value of its $7 million investment to $4.2 million in May.\nTo hear Silber tell it, it was all just paper \u2014 the wealth and the debt.\n\u201cMoney and material wealth do not define who we are,\u201d Silber told the court before his sentencing, arguing he was a changed man. \u201cTrue fulfillment comes from serving others. Somewhere along the way,\u201d he added, \u201cI lost sight of what truly mattered. I let money and a deal take priority over everything.\u201d",

        "content": "There are yellow cabs honking and ambulances wailing, but the streets of Midtown East still feel quiet on a Friday evening, just a few minutes before 6 p.m.\nNear Grand Central Terminal, a chaos of commuters descends to the subway and train, skirting the tourists. But within a few blocks, the sidewalks begin to thin out, until it\u2019s just office workers in their khakis, button-downs and puffer jackets, briefcases in hand or backpacks slung over their shoulders.\nMore workers emerge from the new\nJPMorgan headquarters\non Park Avenue. A man in a suit (without a tie) and a woman in gray exit through the revolving door, the first steps of their commutes scored by the rattling of a construction elevator on the side of the tower.\nA few blocks away, on Third Avenue, the mix shifts to show signs of residential life. A woman jogs down the sidewalk. A couple is out for an evening walk, their baby in a stroller. A little girl in light-up sneakers rides her pink and purple scooter. But their leisurely start to the weekend is at odds with the less-homey ground-floor spots that populate the nearby blocks: a CVS Pharmacy, FedEx and Starbucks. A man dines alone in a Just Salad, while another has a solo glass of wine in a window seat at La Botaniste.\nOn Second Avenue, walking uptown from the former Pfizer headquarters on East 42nd Street, it\u2019s harder to classify the crowd. A woman pushes her small dog in a stroller. A young couple wearing sweats carries a box of pizza home. A man, seemingly fresh from the gym in basketball shorts and a sweatshirt and toting two Trader Joe\u2019s bags, walks past the Westside Market. A group of teenagers in leather jackets pass around a vape.\nThe blend of Friday evening ramblers signals a neighborhood in transition. Once an aging\noffice district\n, Midtown East is on its way to becoming what one business development organization leader in the area dubbed a 24/7 live-work-play community, where employees walk between their offices and apartments, pausing for sit-down dinners or popping into ground-floor retail spots along the way.\nIt\u2019s a vision of ideal Manhattan living that hasn\u2019t historically been synonymous with Midtown, an area long associated with tourist-filled crowds and one that many New Yorkers joke about avoiding at all costs.\nBut that reputation is one developers are betting won\u2019t hold. Some of the city\u2019s biggest names in\nconversions\n, like Nathan Berman\u2019s MetroLoft and the\nVanbarton Group\n, are turning their attention to the area, planning thousands of new apartments as new office towers boost foot traffic. Multifamily developers bill the added commercial development as a boon for their prospects, raising some brokers\u2019 hopes for prices per square foot reached by the projects.\n\u201cWhen you think of everything that\u2019s been happening along Park Avenue and near Grand Central, this is going to feed right off of that,\u201d said Joey Chilelli, a principal at Vanbarton, which is converting an office building on East 43rd Street into 400 apartments. \u201cYou\u2019ve got all these new corporate headquarters going on, major employers and major investment. What better opportunity to deliver high-quality product and tap into those residents who work in those corporate offices.\u201d\nA\nneighborhood evolves\nRob Byrnes has worked with the East Midtown Partnership for more than 20 years.\nIn his time with the nonprofit, which is geared toward improving the district stretching from Second Avenue to Madison Avenue between East 48th and East 63rd streets, he estimates that he\u2019s seen the population of the corridor increase fourfold.\nOn top of that growth, the population is set for a likely influx of new residents once a wave of new development projects across\u00a0 the neighborhood \u2014 and dotted along its periphery \u2014 is completed. Among them is MetroLoft\u2019s massive conversion of the former Pfizer Building, which itself is expected to deliver roughly 1,500 units.\nThe neighborhood is also undergoing an infusion of commercial development, thanks to a re-zoning in 2017 aimed at replacing crumbling office buildings with shiny skyscrapers. JP Morgan plans to house 10,000 of its employees in its brand new tower, which opened last month. Earlier this year, CBRE inked a lease for 64,000 square feet at the all-glass Lever House after its $100 million renovation.\nAs Midtown East builds its residential contingent, it could extend the boundaries of such adjacent neighborhoods as the Upper East Side, blurring the lines between where one ends and the other begins. It\u2019s a shift that\u2019s already happening across the borough, which some say has increasingly become more homogenous, shedding the defining character and stereotypes that once ruled its neighborhoods.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not as differentiated as they used to feel when I moved here in the late \u201980s,\u201d fashion designer Thom Browne told the Wall Street Journal, referring to a migration of downtown businesses, including his own brand, to uptown neighborhoods like the Upper East Side.\nMidtown East hasn\u2019t quite reached its final form yet. It\u2019s still largely a commercial district catering to office workers, building staff and commuters coming and going from Grand Central. Fast casual restaurants serving office workers still dominate the food scene, although it\u2019s gradually attracting a more trendy crop of after-hours dining options, including such spots as the downtown Italian restaurant Rosemary\u2019s, which opened on Third Avenue and East 50th Street last year.\nWhat plays out in Midtown East \u2014 from apartment rental rates to new business investment \u2014 could also serve as a testing ground for Midtown South, which just had its own rezoning approved earlier this year and already has its first conversion project on deck. The blocks surrounding the Garment District aren\u2019t slated for the type of office developments going up in the nearby area, but the emerging residential district will likely benefit from New Yorkers warming up to Midtown as a desirable place to live.\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be the big sell\u201d for the Garment District, said Robert Rahmanian, co-CEO of Real NY, the firm heading leasing at CSC Real Estate\u2019s conversion on 300 East 42nd Street.\nRahmanian added that most of the projects the team is working on are in largely commercial areas, which he described as \u201cnot at the moment places where people want to live.\u201d\nBut what those conversions may lack in trendy locations, they gain in square footage. Carving up office floor plates into apartments that meet the city\u2019s code requirements is like solving a \u201cRubix Cube,\u201d Rahmanian said, which means units are often larger than others in equivalent new development buildings, A unit listed as a studio at a conversion may have interior rooms that make it feel more like a one- or two-bedroom.\nL\nife after rezoning\nMidtown East got the green light for a makeover in 2017.\nThat August, the City Council approved a rezoning of 78 blocks in the neighborhood, a move that paved the way for developers to replace old office buildings with newer, taller towers in exchange for contributing to public infrastructure funds.\nThe measure was a hard-fought one, arising from concerns that the eastern edge of Manhattan\u2019s leading business district would fall behind other areas such as Hudson Yards, which had been injected with shiny corporate headquarters and high-end retail in the years prior.\nAt the time of the rezoning, the city identified 16 sites ripe for a turnaround. Since then, seven of them have undergone or are in line for major alterations, The Real Deal\u2019s analysis shows. Three of those buildings will yield a combined 1,700 residential units.\nBut the rezoning came at a tricky time for the office market \u2014 not just in Manhattan, but across the world. Just three years after the rezoning approval, the Covid-19 pandemic shuttered offices, and in the years immediately after, a new attitude toward in-person working threatened to keep office workers at home more often, if not permanently.\nYet the move to revamp the office stock in Midtown East still appears to be paying off, if JPMorgan\u2019s massive new headquarters \u2014 and elimination of most work-from-home options \u2014 is any indication.\nThe pandemic \u201ccertainly presented a moment of uncertainty, but what we have seen is a strong rebound that has continued unabated,\u201d said Dan Garodnick, City Planning Commission chair and the Council member who spearheaded the 2017 rezoning effort. \u201cIt is proving to be the plan we\u2019d hoped it would be.\u201d\nAlthough the events of 2020 may not have deterred office development in the district, it did put the idea of more residential development on the minds of some of those in charge. Byrnes of the East Midtown Partnership, who was on the steering committee for the 2017 rezoning, said it wasn\u2019t until the pandemic that he seriously considered trying to incentivize more residential development in the area.\n\u201cIt was clear in the first years of the pandemic that we needed a residential population to sustain ground-floor businesses,\u201d Byrnes said.\nByrnes wasn\u2019t alone in drawing that conclusion. Developers also caught on, jumping on opportunities to convert aging office buildings into residential apartments, aided in the following years by a series of tax abatements under 467m that made conversions especially attractive.\nIn a report published in July, City Comptroller Brad Lander estimated that more than 4,000 residential units have been created from conversions in Midtown East since 2020.\nSome of this development occurred within the bounds of the area selected for the Midtown East commercial rezoning. Since 2017, more than 3,500 residential units have been added in the zone or are in the pipeline, according to an analysis by TRD.\nThen at the end of last year, the City Council passed the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, a city-wide zoning amendment that eased restrictions on conversions, moving the year of office eligibility from 1961 to 1990. Since then, developers have been snapping up buildings in the area, with more plans to convert on the horizon.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the beginning,\u201d said Platinum Properties Co-Founder, Khashy Eyn, referring to the Pfizer building conversion. \u201cIf Nathan Berman is going somewhere, a lot more people will follow.\u201d\nSome liken the budding transformation to the Financial District, where thousands of apartments have been converted from office buildings. Indeed, developers have taken cues from the neighborhood that was a testing ground for the conversion math and Jenga-like division required to make a project pencil out. Major conversions such as 25 Water Street proved that office-to-residential projects could be lucrative.\nMidtown East is, in many respects, an entirely different story. First, the wave of residential development is coinciding with an influx of office development, while the Financial District focused on residential only. Plus, Midtown East is a more established neighborhood than the Financial District, which is only just now seeing an uptick in the kind of retail and restaurant space necessary to sustain a neighborhood.\n\u201cMidtown is ahead of where FiDi was,\u201d Eyn said.\nEyn pushed back against the idea that people would shy away from living in Midtown East because of the hustle and bustle associated with the corridor.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to get very healthy, high rents in these Midtown East buildings,\u201d Eyn said. \u201cManhattan is Manhattan. If you want to live in a residential neighborhood, I get it if you go to the West Village or Greenwich Village, but everywhere else you have a mix.\u201d",

        "content": "For New York\u2019s real estate players, the financing drought may finally be ending.\nAfter two years of sharp contraction, real estate lending is showing\nsigns of life.\nThe top 20 lenders doled out a combined $23 billion in loans over the past 12 months, up 60 percent from a year earlier, according to an analysis by\nThe Real Deal\n. Credit started to flow again as property markets stabilized and new state tax incentives went into effect.\nJPMorgan Chase retained its place at the top of the rankings, with almost $4 billion in loans, up from $2.1 billion a year ago and well ahead of the competition. Wells Fargo held onto second place with about $2.7 billion in new lending, up from $1.4 billion. Citibank climbed to third, more than doubling its total to nearly $2.7 billion.\nTraditional banks continued to dominate, but a handful of alternative and nonbank lenders surged into the ranks. Bank of Montreal leapt onto the list with more than $1 billion, up over 540 percent from the prior year, while Madison Realty Capital cracked the top 10, with nearly $1 billion in loans. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Financial Corporation, which did not appear on last year\u2019s list, recorded a 17-fold increase in loan volume.\n\u201cOverall, the real estate sector has had a tough three or four years, so I think there\u2019s finally a perception that we\u2019re closer to the bottom than not.\u201d\nJosh Zegen, Madison Realty Capital\n\u201cThere were a few unique opportunities this year, and in general there was a little more clarity, which led to more activity in New York City,\u201d said Josh Zegen of Madison Realty Capital, citing the extension of the construction completion deadline for 421a projects and the adoption of the 467m tax abatement on office-to-residential conversions as a key driver in the firm\u2019s $720 million loan for the former Pfizer headquarters building in Midtown East. \u201cOverall, the real estate sector has had a tough three or four years, so I think there\u2019s finally a perception that we\u2019re closer to the bottom than not.\u201d\nTo assess the industry\u2019s biggest lenders in New York City real estate,\nTRD\nexamined mortgages recorded in city records from August 2024 through July 2025 compared with the year before.\nThe rankings only include documents classified as mortgages \u2014 not those recorded as \u201cagreements\u201d \u2014 in city property records. The total number of loans issued by the top 20 lenders was up 11 percent from a year earlier, according to the data. (The ranking does not include some of the year\u2019s blockbuster refinancings, including the $2.85 billion\nCMBS loan\nfor Tishman Speyer and Henry Crown\u2019s Hudson Yards\noffice\ntower, The Spiral.)\nDespite the strong year, not all lenders are rushing back into the market. Valley National Bank, last year\u2019s third-place lender, saw its total plunge nearly 40 percent to about $750 million. Deutsche Bank\u2019s lending dropped by a similar margin, to just over $530 million.\nThe largest lending deal during the time period tracked by\nTRD\nwas the $1.15 billion refi of Steve Witkoff and Len Blavatnik\u2019s\nOne High Line\ncondo project, provided by JPMorgan and Tyko Capital. Corebridge Institutional Investments provided the second-largest loan, $561 million, to Scott Rechler\u2019s RXR, Marc Holliday\u2019s SL Green and Marc Rowan\u2019s Apollo Global Management for the office-to-residential conversion of\n5 Times Square\n.\nTriple-digit deals doubled, from 60 to 129, year-over-year. The multifamily sector accounted for the largest share of new financing deals citywide, while office lending remained muted, except for Class A trophy towers, as landlords and lenders continued to navigate refinancing challenges.\nA year ago, dealmaking was stymied by steep borrowing costs. But landlords who were trying to tread water finally caught a break in September, when the Fed announced its 25-point rate cut.\nA surge in mixed-use and residential projects fueled lending for such multifamily lenders as S3 Capital Partners, which almost doubled its lending dollars year-over-year.\n\u201cThere are brisk sales in the boroughs, rents have been strong in most core areas, [and] everyone\u2019s whispering about the rates,\u201d said S3 Capital\u2019s Shawn Safdie. \u201cI think when you put that all in a blender, developers are optimistic by trade; otherwise, take your ball and go home. And so they\u2019re really playing it, and we\u2019re happy to finance it.\u201d\nAccess the comprehensive data set supporting this ranking\nhere\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.",

        "content": "November brings big changes for some of\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s markets.\nNew York City begins\nsaying goodbye to Mayor Eric Adams\n, who dropped his reelection bid in September after months of trailing in the polls.\nIn the final stretch of the mayoral election, Democratic nominee and frontrunner Zohran Mamdani made his case to business crowds, assuring that alongside his pledge to freeze rents for stabilized tenants, he\u2019s also looking to fix the city\u2019s property tax system and help landlords reduce costs.\nFormer Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who\u2019s running as an independent, has promised to build 500,000 units, in part by overhauling the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. He has repeatedly said he would initiate construction of these \u201csimultaneously,\u201d raising questions about capacity and available subsidies.\nCurtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee, resisted increasing calls for him to drop out of the race to give Cuomo a better chance of beating Mamdani. Sliwa has touted his opposition to the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, the centerpiece of the Adams\u2019 administration\u2019s housing agenda, which included several zoning changes aimed at making housing construction easier in the city.\nFour of the six\nballot measures\nin New York also focus on streamlining housing and other land use-related approval processes. Three of those questions have proven highly controversial and are seen by the City Council as a threat to members\u2019 authority over development in their districts. Some of the questions would remove the City Council\u2019s vote on certain projects that go through the city\u2019s land use review process, and one of the measures would create an appeals board that could override the Council\u2019s rejections of housing projects.\nA whopping 13 candidates are vying for [mayor of Miami], with six political veterans who seemingly have the upper hand\nover the seven newcomers. As of print time, there isn\u2019t a clear frontrunner.\nOne of the questions asks voters if local elections should be moved to even years, coinciding with presidential elections. Another proposal, if approved, would change the state constitution to retroactively allow ski trails in the Olympic Sports Complex in Essex County. As a condition of approval, the state must add 2,500 acres of protected forest land to Adirondack Park.\nMiami is also getting a new mayor, after a state court\nruled\nin July that the city cannot delay its elections by one year. The City Commission had voted to move elections to even years, which would have meant one more year in office for Mayor Francis Suarez, who is term-limited out of office.\nA whopping 13 candidates are\nvying\nfor Suarez\u2019s job, with six political veterans who seemingly have the upper hand over the seven newcomers. As of print time, there isn\u2019t a clear frontrunner.\nReal estate donors\nhave thrown support behind Miami City Commissioner Joe Carollo and Miami-Dade County Commissioner Eileen Higgins. Some prominent developers have also contributed to the campaigns of ex-Miami City Manager Emilio Gonzalez, ex-Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez and former city commissioners Ken Russell and Alex Diaz de la Portilla.\nMeanwhile, in Miami Beach, Commissioner Kristen Rosen Gonzalez is challenging Mayor Steven Meiner. Airbnb investor Brian Ehrlich is competing for Rosen Gonzalez\u2019s commissioner seat, as is Daniel Ciraldo, former executive director of the Miami Design Preservation League. Attorney Monique Pardo-Pope and realtor Ava Frankel are also running.\nAnother real estate investor, Fred Karlton, is challenging Commissioner Laura Dominguez for her seat.\nIn Bexar County, Texas, the November ballot will determine whether the county should increase its hotel occupancy tax to help fund a new arena for the San Antonio Spurs and to redevelop the San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo grounds. Two proposals seek to use that increase, as well as revenue from an extended rental car tax, to provide $311 million toward the arena and $197 million toward the grounds.\nConsequential races are on the horizon next year for some of\nTRD\n\u2019s other markets as well, and lines are being drawn. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is up for reelection, and some challengers are already getting in the race. Developer Rick Caruso, a persistent critic of Bass, has left the door open to challenging the mayor next year or running for governor. Real estate players have also donated to Antonio Villaraigosa\u2019s bid to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom.\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker launched his reelection bid in June, although he has not ruled out a run for president in 2028.\n\u2014\nFrancisco Alvarado,\u00a0Lauren Elkies Schram and Isaiah Mitchell contributed reporting",

        "content": "Over the last year, as the New York City office market saw a resurgence, the big players made a flurry of deals. One was 2 Park Avenue, which\ntraded\nto Haddad Brands for $357 million. A few blocks away, 250 Park\ntraded\nfor $320 million. Office-to-residential conversions, meanwhile, spurred transactions in quieter commercial centers, like at 77 Water Street,\nwhich was sold\nto Vanbarton for about $95 million.\nLawyers played a crucial role in getting those deals across the finish line for the marquee names who made them, doing a lot more than handling the paperwork.\nThe Real Deal ranked law firms by dollar volume of closed sales in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn, between Aug. 1, 2024, of last year and July 31, 2025. In total,\nTRD\nanalyzed nearly 41,000 commercial and residential sales in New York, totaling more than $80.2 billion.\nFried Frank Harris Shriver &amp; Jacobson took the top spot at $3.2 billion in just 42 deals. The firm nearly tripled its volume, as measured by\nTRD\n, from last year to this year.\nA reenergized real estate climate certainly had a hand in that. But the firm instead touted its long-running relationships in the industry as the key to growth.\n\u201cEven though New York is a big city, in terms of complex, big transactions, you tend to see the same people over and over again,\u201d Jonathan Mechanic, co-chairman of Fried Frank\u2019s real estate department, said. The firm frequently represents JP Morgan, Blackstone and RXR, among others.\nFor example, the morning before an interview with TRD, Mechanic had a meeting with a lender and a borrower. Although he was representing the borrower that day, he had previously represented the lender. That gave the whole interaction an additional level of trust.\n\u201cThere are a lot of lawyers who may be good technical lawyers out there,\u201d said Michael Werner, Fried Frank\u2019s other co-chair. \u201cBut it\u2019s the relationships that you have with folks around the table that really facilitate getting a complicated deal done quickly, efficiently and fairly.\u201d\nA rising market\nThe rise in office sales benefited other big commercial firms as well. Greenberg Traurig nearly doubled its deal count, from 10 to 18, and tripled its volume, surging 32 spots from last year\u2019s ranking to this year\u2019s list.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing competitive bidding on assets that are for sale, which we hadn\u2019t seen since pre-Covid,\u201d Stephen Rabinowitz, co-chair of the firm\u2019s real estate practice at Greenberg Traurig, said.\nBeyond the sales volume, commercial lawyers often spend a good deal of time on loan workouts, negotiating new terms for a borrower when things haven\u2019t gone according to plan. Although interest rate declines have helped, they haven\u2019t solved borrowers\u2019 problems.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still quite a lot of distressed debt working its way through the system,\u201d Rabinowitz said.\nIn the residential world, interest rate declines have also been meaningful.\n\u201cThe sheer news of the interest rate [decline] or the feeling that it\u2019s going to go down or keep further going down has already spurred a huge significant uptick in my recent volume,\u201d Jeremy Wang, principal at Yeung &amp; Wang, said. The firm completed 599 deals during the year.\nChanges to the financing landscape also resulted in more lending on the residential side. Not long ago, about 70 percent of the residential deals Romer Debbas worked on were cash deals \u2014 now that number has come down to about 50 percent, said Michael Romer, the firm\u2019s managing partner.\n\u201cWe closed more large residential transactions this year than we have in past years and that\u2019s a positive sign showing that there\u2019s movement, showing that investors are comfortable investing in our market,\u201d Romer said. The firm took the second spot in the overall rankings with 482 deals.\nThose economic and cultural conditions have also changed how residential buyers approach sales. Beyond paperwork, a resi attorney\u2019s job can involve a fair amount of emotional management.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot more, in my experience, hand-holding,\u201d said Sharon Darouvar, of Konner Gershburg Melnick Darouvar, which sits third on the list. \u201cBuyers are more cautious about making a purchase, but it\u2019s a lot more: How do you feel about this? Are you confident in the diligence? Are you comfortable with the terms and representations of the contract?\u201d\nA changing landscape\nLaw may be one of the more traditional professions, but it\u2019s already being upended by new technologies.\nFor some, AI is the driving force. The attorneys at Greenberg Traurig do work for major non-real estate companies. Those firms are already using artificial intelligence in some of their work and have begun asking for AI solutions from their legal teams. Greenberg Traurig is now beginning to use an in-house AI system.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having an additional person there to check your writing, check for internal inconsistencies,\u201d Rabinowitz said. \u201cEven that has already started to have an impact. It gives us an opportunity to feel a lot more confident in the precision of the work we\u2019re producing.\u201d\nTechnology is also affecting lawyers\u2019 work in more subtle ways. Just the process of getting documents signed is now seeing less friction.\n\u201cI would say the norm in Manhattan now is not to have a live closing,\u201d said Wang.\nBut these developments are unlikely to change some things. New York still mandates legal representation for buyers and sellers in every real estate transfer.\nWhen the next big deal comes down the pike, New York\u2019s attorneys will be there to grab it.\nAccess the comprehensive data set supporting this ranking\nhere\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.",

        "content": "How big is too big?\nProperty managers ranked below FirstService Residential have eagerly been asking that question, as the city\u2019s top firm by size has gobbled up the competition in recent years. In 2023, it acquired Charles H. Greenthal &amp; Co. and Tudor Realty Services Corp. and in 2021, FirstService added Midboro Management and its roughly 15,000 units.\nThis year, FirstService retained its top spot on\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s property management rankings for a fourth\nstraight year\n, but the vultures have been circling. FirstService saw its unit count fall by over 20,000 from last year to this year, according to the rankings.\nTRD\nanalyzed the number of units under management as of Sept. 30, 2025, using building data from the Department of Housing Preservation and Development from all five boroughs.\nIn some ways, FirstService\u2019s position is more a paper crown after long-time silver medalist AKAM acquired Metro Management Development and its more than 40,000 units in February. The two firms will maintain distinct brand identities and continue to report totals separately, but the combined entity would surpass FirstService.\nAKAM CEO Ken Greene said that the deal for Metro, which specializes in Mitchell-Lama properties, made sense as a complement to AKAM\u2019s portfolio.\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking to cut costs by consolidating,\u201d Greene said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m looking to do is to add \u2014 to invest money in programs that add value to a board and property that will lead to economic benefit.\u201d\nThough FirstService maintained its top rank, a number of new issues confronted the industry, including new rental laws, an increase in competition for units and soaring costs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to be hard for the smaller players to really compete.\u201d\nKen Greene, AKAM\nFirstService\u2019s newly named president Marc Kotler attributed the drop in his company\u2019s unit count to normal market adjustments and some asset sales in the rental world, but he declined to provide specific numbers on how those factors played into the company\u2019s results this year.\nFor others, the\noffice-to-residential conversion boom\nhas been a boon for growth. A report from the city found that there have been 44 conversion projects started since 2020 that, once completed, are expected to deliver over 17,000 new units to the city \u2014 and to property managers that know how to handle them.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been advising, supporting, helping [and] in some cases, walking buildings with other owners or developers,\u201d Rose Associates\u2019 Scott Marino said. His firm helped bring Silverstein Properties and Metro Loft\u2019s 571-unit conversion of Goldman Sachs\u2019 former office at 55 Broad to market.\nDevelopers or landowners eyeing conversions often enlist property managers to help understand the minutiae, from how to convert HVAC or electrical systems to rejiggering trash-collection systems originally geared around reams of office paper, according to Marino.\nCarving out a niche like conversions may prove to be the way forward for the boutique firms remaining in the city, as the large players continue to take advantage of their economies of scale and resources.\nJust weeks ago, Douglas Elliman Property Management, which placed third in this year\u2019s rankings,\nwas sold\nto Associa, one of the largest property managers in the country.\nGreene, who last year boasted about AKAM\u2019s ability to take advantage of M&amp;A turmoil by offering superior service, slightly changed his tune this year about what AKAM can offer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to be hard for the smaller players to really compete,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at some of those companies that are really well run, that have built up great reputations and have great founders, and we\u2019d love them to become part of AKAM.\u201d\nCost problems\nThe biggest shakeup for landlords, large and small, came from the FARE Act passage this year, which required building owners, rather than would-be renters, to pay broker fees.\nBut the top property managers downplayed the impact of the new law on their management operations, noting that it was just another piece of the compliance puzzle.\nKotler said most owners working with FirstService were already paying the brokerage fees, and for those that weren\u2019t, it was just a matter of updating budgets.\n\u201cWe completed a digital audit of all of our websites,\u201d Rose Associates\u2019 Marino said, adding that the focus was just on ensuring fees, like a $20 application charge, were listed on all of the company\u2019s websites.\nThe bigger issue, as it has been in years past, has been navigating the interminable runup in costs, driven by regulations, utilities and insurance.\n\u201cCosts on insurance are just simply out of line, and we need to figure it out,\u201d Marino said.\nWhile insurance costs have risen across the country, the number one culprit in the city is umbrella insurance policies for co-ops and condos that have ballooned by as much as 50 percent, driven by New York\u2019s strict liability laws, according to FirstService Residential\u2019s annual high-rise report.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve reevaluated the need for some of those huge umbrella numbers that you\u00a0 had historically when you basically were given it for free, and a real discussion of what is really an appropriate amount of umbrella,\u201d said Orsid New York president Neil Davidowitz.\nThis year also marked the first time fines could be levied under Local Law 97, which requires buildings to hit certain carbon emission thresholds. While some buildings managed to stay below the mandated thresholds for 2025, property managers are already looking ahead to subsequent years, when more stringent requirements will be in place.\n\u201cThe vast, vast, vast majority of our 265 buildings were not exposed to fines for this year,\u201d Davidowitz said. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t make changes, there is a potential exposure for fines in 2030.\u201d\nThe number of cost drivers has only grown in recent years, forcing property managers and boards to take a more hands-on approach than they have in the past.\n\u201cI think boards are very quickly realizing you need to cut that long-term plan,\u201d Century Management CEO A.J. Rexhepi said. \u201cYou need to put together funds on an annual basis for long-term capital planning.\u201d\nFor the industry\u2019s heavyweights, cost-saving solutions have come from economies of scale, something they hope can be a competitive advantage.\n\u201cWe have an insurance expert and we have an energy expert on staff,\u201d AKAM\u2019s Greene said. \u201c\u2019We\u2019re able to get certain expense items lower than most management companies because we\u2019re using our scale.\u201d\nAccess the comprehensive data set supporting this ranking\nhere\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.",

        "content": "Gov. Ron DeSantis asked Floridians a big question earlier this year.\n\u201cYou buy a home, pay off a mortgage\u2014and yet you still have to write a check to the government every year just to live on your own property?\u201d he said in his State of the State speech. \u201cIs the property yours or are you just renting from the government?\u201d\nThe line of questioning resonated with the state\u2019s homeowners, who have watched their carrying costs rise as higher property assessments have added to their tax burden at the same time that\ninsurance premiums\nhave risen and \u2014 for\ncondo\nunit owners especially \u2014 fees have piled on.\nBrokers likewise began to imagine a world where their clients didn\u2019t balk after a preview of their tax bill. Would-be buyers are often surprised when the value of a property has gone up substantially since its last sale, triggering a big levy. The state already limits annual tax increases for owners.\nIn any event, the tax bills from higher valuations hadn\u2019t just put pressure on residents, the governor said. They had also created \u201ca gusher of revenue for local governments,\u201d some of whose budgets had increased \u201cfar beyond the growth in population.\u201d\nDuring the ensuing months, state house representatives and senators looked to see if the\npush could become a reality\n. House Speaker Daniel Perez created the Select Committee on Property Taxes, whose efforts yielded seven joint resolutions and a bill; if passed by House, Senate and voters, they could add several new exemptions to an existing list of property tax relief, much of which is focused on homesteaded properties, or primary residences.\nBut so far, Gov. DeSantis isn\u2019t going for the half steps, no matter how researched. \u201cPlacing more than one property tax measure on the ballot represents an attempt to kill anything on property taxes,\u201d he said on X.\nAs local representatives duke out with the governor,\nThe Real Deal\nasked industry and political insiders to get into the philosophical and practical details in The Debate. State Rep. Vicki Lopez, co-chair of the House Select Committee on Property Taxes, believes voters should decide the issue, while Dora Puig, broker and owner of Luxe Living Realty, wants to preserve features that make communities attractive to residents and buyers before changing the tax structure.\nState Rep. Vicki Lopez\nSince May, when the Florida House Speaker created our property tax committee, we\u2019ve been meeting and gathering information from all 37 representatives across both parties, rural communities and big urban areas.\nWhat we\u2019ve learned has been eye-opening. We say \u201ctaxes,\u201d but what homeowners pay is truly a fee for services. Right now, all three types of property owners \u2014 non-homestead residential, homestead residential and commercial \u2014 pay for police, fire, solid waste, water and sewer, infrastructure and other services.\nThe governor has told voters that anyone who owns a homestead property should have their property taxes totally eliminated. But this raises an interesting philosophical question: Why should commercial properties and non-homestead residential properties have to pay for those services but not those who own homestead properties?\nThere is already a fear that commercial property owners would be hit with new fees by local governments, and that this could put a burden on businesses, especially owners with rental properties.\nIn Key Biscayne, which runs a very lean budget, homestead property taxes total $11 million, and half goes to public safety. If you eliminate these particular property taxes, then who will pick up the costs? It is estimated that half of the 411 municipalities in the state might have to fold back into counties. Can counties absorb all the new residents and the corresponding services?\nThe House decided: Why don\u2019t we trust the voters to decide how to tax themselves?\u00a0 All our proposals require no decrease in funding for police and exclude school taxes. One proposal eliminates homestead property taxes while another one does so over a 10-year period of time, which gives a longer runway to make budget adjustments. The third would completely eliminate non-school taxes for anyone 65 and over who resides in a homestead property.\nWe\u2019re also proposing new exemptions that would benefit new homeowners and help people downsize. One would eliminate the $500,000 cap on portability, so you could transfer the entire exemption even if the home has a lesser value, and we\u2019ll let married couples combine their Save Our Home benefits. Another limits the growth in assessed value to 3 percent over three years for homestead properties, and 5 percent per year for non-homestead properties instead of the current 10 percent.\nWe also have a legislative bill that requires local governments to pass any increase in millage rates \u2014 the amount of tax per $1,000 of assessed property value \u2014 by a two-thirds vote.\nThere was talk from DOGE efforts that there\u2019s lots of waste in government and we can eliminate property tax with no effect. But of our 67 counties, 29 are fiscally constrained, and we already subsidize them because of the lack of a tax base.\nOnce the proposals are passed in the House they will be sent to the Senate for their review.\u00a0 We don\u2019t know yet where the Senate is on this. Whatever both decide will go to the voters as constitutional amendments in the November 2026 general election. We don\u2019t know what those amendments will be, but property tax reform is coming, along with intended and unintended consequences.\n\u2014\nAs told to TRD\nDora Puig\nBroker and owner of Luxe Living Realty\nAs a luxury real estate professional in South Florida, I meet or speak with multiple clients daily, and lately many conversations circle back to the same concern: property taxes. For most international buyers who don\u2019t have such high property taxes, it is an issue for them to wrap their heads around it.\nA state push to eliminate property taxes for Floridians sounds appealing, but we must ensure Floridians aren\u2019t left with dangerous funding gaps.\nNew Yorkers and Californians flee to Florida, Texas and Tennessee specifically because we don\u2019t have state income tax. When you\u2019re already paying 40 percent federally, adding California\u2019s 13.3 percent state tax becomes unbearable. It\u2019s one of the reasons our real estate market is booming.\nI\u2019ve lost sales to clients on account of high property taxes, so in theory, I see how this is a good idea. But there has to be a real plan to pay the bills of the state of Florida. I want to make sure we have police, schools that are good, firefighters, and streets that are clean first.\nTo my recollection, the property tax conversation started when the Champlain Towers South condo tower collapsed, exposing a crisis in aging condominium buildings. The reserve requirements in some condominiums have increased by up to 50 percent, insurance costs have exploded and, suddenly, older residents on fixed incomes couldn\u2019t afford their homes. For example, I know of condominium buildings that have needed to syndicate with up to five insurance companies just to obtain insurance. The elderly tend to move out of their houses because they are too tedious to maintain, and move into condominiums because the lifestyle is easier. Now they are finding themselves with very high condominium maintenance fees and special assessments that are difficult to keep up with.\nThere\u2019s genuine appeal to rewarding primary residents who live here 12 months a year, maintain our communities, and contribute year-round. Eliminating property tax for these homesteaded properties while maintaining it for investment properties could create a powerful incentive for permanent residency and convert renters and young people into first-time home buyers.\nThis wouldn\u2019t solve everything. I\u2019ve personally lost sales to European clients who balk at our property taxes when they\u2019re accustomed to paying very little annually back home.\nFlorida is typically run with a surplus, but we still have hurricanes we cannot control, aging infrastructure requiring billions in upgrades and insurance companies threatening to abandon the state entirely. We cannot cut property taxes at the expense of essential services or disaster preparedness.\nThe question isn\u2019t whether eliminating homestead property taxes is desirable\u2026 Obviously, it is. The big thing is, can we make the numbers work? Can we cover our bills throughout the state of Florida? Can we maintain the quality of life that attracts people here in the first place?\nI think we should see the complete financial picture first. Show us how we continue to fund schools, maintain emergency services and handle storms without collateral damage to the things that make Florida exceptional. Get the math right, and this bold reform could cement Florida\u2019s competitive advantage for generations.\n\u2014\nAs told to TRD",

        "content": "In the gold rush that is real estate development in West Palm Beach, nothing is more valuable than the dirt on waterfront Flagler Drive.\nBut there is no vacant land left for sale. Aging condos inhabit the remaining development sites, their boards controlled by unit owners with differing opinions on the fate of their tropical escapes. As they try to woo these often mercurial sellers, South Florida\u2019s richest developers are also fighting each other for the last pieces of West Palm Beach\u2019s rich waterfront and the chance to leave their mark on the future skyline of \u201cWall Street South.\u201d\nBillionaires have been snapping up sites along the road for years, among them Jorge P\u00e9rez, Jeff Greene and Wayne Huizenga Jr. (of the Blockbuster and Waste Management fortune).\nNamed for the Standard Oil magnate credited as the grandfather of modern Florida, Flagler Drive starts at the South End and stretches the length of the city\u2019s Intracoastal Waterway frontage to a dead end at the border with Riviera Beach. The street and its city emerged from the pandemic triumphant, with a new flock of wealthy residents and finance sector office tenants.\nDevelopers responded in kind,\nplanning thousands of condo units,\nprimarily along the Flagler Drive corridor.\nAfter devouring the few vacant patches of land, they turned their attention to the aging condo buildings on the waterfront. In the aftermath of the Champlain Towers collapse, the state passed condo safety laws that trapped many older condos in financial binds. It was open season. Sources say nearly every building along Flagler Drive\u2019s waterfront has fielded offers from developers. Every firm has their own courtship style in these deals \u2014 some forward, some coy \u2014 but they all want the same thing. The land.\nQ\nuiet luxury\nAmong the firms that take a more covert approach is Perko Development, a Jupiter-based team led by Phil Perko. Perko prefers to enter a building quietly, cordially, so as not to spook the sellers or alert the competition to his whereabouts. After orchestrating buyouts, he partners with a more high-profile developer to plan a new condominium.\nHe followed this method on Jupiter Island in 2017, arranging the acquisition of Bowling Rock Club and partnering with Jeffery Soffer\u2019s Fontainebleau Development to build the 10-story, 21-unit SeaGlass. It sold out\nfor $168.8 million\nin 2023, with buyers who had C-suite titles from companies like Krispy Kreme, Major League Baseball and the crypto platform BitPay.\nAfter that success, Perko turned his attention to the West Palm Beach waterfront, this time in partnership with Kolter Group.\nThe pair honed in on Flagler House, a 38-unit waterfront condominium at 3705 South Flagler Drive. Built in 1985 on 1.4 acres, the majority of units have an estimated market value below $200,000, according to the Palm Beach County Property Appraiser\u2019s Office. When Perko and Kolter closed on their\n$37.6 million buyout\nof the building in May, prices for units ranged from $850,000 to $1.8 million, property records show. In its place, the developers plan an 18-story, 39-unit luxury condo of the same name. Sales have yet to launch and the developers declined to comment on pricing.\nIt was a deal done with little fanfare or public angst. Some sellers walked away having made their money back tenfold, illustrating the profit potential for condo owners along West Palm Beach\u2019s waterfront \u2014 that is, if they can reach the critical mass for voting consensus. This gets more challenging in larger buildings with a greater range of personalities and financial motives.\nT\nhe poison pill\n\u201cMost condo boards have what they call a \u2018poison pill,\u2019\u201d Serhant agent Christian Prakas said. He\u2019s referring to the Florida law that allows for 5 percent of a condo\u2019s total voting interest to block a condo termination, even if the remaining 95 percent are in support.\nThe poison pill has proven an effective defense against developers hoping to build anew on Flagler, including Al Adelson.\nAdelson completed The Bristol at 1100 South Flagler Drive in 2019. It is widely considered the premier condo tower in West Palm Beach, and sales frequently top $3,000 per square foot, a once unheard-of number in the city. Adelson is planning a second non-waterfront condo dubbed The Berkeley, but last year he was quietly shopping for a waterfront site.\nHe approached two adjacent buildings spanning 5.5 waterfront acres, La Fontana at 2800 North Flagler Drive and Portofino at 2600 North Flagler Drive, with an offer: $300 million for the pair. For the 140-unit La Fontanta, that averages to $1.1 million per unit, and it\u2019s $1.2 million per door for the 125-unit Portofino \u2014 far exceeding market value.\nBut the deal choked on the poison pill. La Fontana, a co-op with a lower termination threshold, was game, but Portofino\u2019s owners couldn\u2019t reach consensus.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear the value of land continues to go up and up, but there comes a point where I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth more than I offer.\u201d\nAl Adelson\n\u201cWhen you have more units, the more difficult it is to agree,\u201d Adelson said. In larger buildings, where there are 100 to 200 unit owners, \u201ceach of them has a vote, and [they can] range from very successful people financially to people who are living on their savings and Social Security. They have different financial needs.\u201d\nIn the case of La Fontana and Portofino, Adelson hit the upper limit on how much he was willing to sweeten the pot for opposing unit owners.\n\u201cThe sellers have not agreed to sell, which means there are other people they feel will pay more money,\u201d Adelson said. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear the value of land continues to go up and up, but there comes a point where I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth more than I offer.\u201d\nAfter the failed buyout, La Fontana\u2019s owners were still seeing dollar signs. The co-op tapped Serhant to market the building as a development site asking $200 million. Prakas confirmed the 10-story building is under contract to a developer for near the asking price, which would average out to $1.4 million per unit. He declined to confirm who\u2019s buying but said La Fontana received multiple offers from developers.\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t the highest, but it was the strongest,\u201d he said, adding that some of the offers were, like Adelson\u2019s, contingent upon the building to the south, Portofino at 2600 North Flagler Drive, also selling. \u201cWe\u2019re not confident in that happening.\u201d\nTo Prakas, the La Fontana sale holds lessons in an era of buyouts, terminations and rebirth.\n\u201cA co-op buyout is so much easier than a condo buyout,\u201d he said. Voting power is structured differently, and they are not as susceptible to the 5 percent poison pill, Prakas said.\nWhile the deal is still months from closing, La Fontana\u2019s buyout is a fairytale compared to the brutal battles playing out in neighboring buildings, where owners who bought $200,000 units decades ago find themselves in a legal tug-of-war between industry titans.\nT\nhe big boys in the sandbox\nHarbor Towers is a two-acre, two-building, 61-unit complex at 3901 South Flagler Drive. It\u2019s one in a trio of waterfront sites on a prime 4.3-acre stretch of South Flagler Drive opposite the Intracoastal Waterway from Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club. It\u2019s also close to the desirable El Cid and SoSo neighborhoods.\nAnd Nadim Ashi\u2019s Fort Partners and Steve Ross\u2019 Related Ross have been dueling over it for the better part of a year.\nBy November of last year, Ashi had already secured the middle parcel, an apartment complex at 3906 Washington Road and 3907 South Flagler Drive\nfor $20 million\n. Both developers had made offers on the third site, 60-unit Southbridge at 3915 South Flagler Drive, where Ross won out with a bid of $42 million, or $700,000 per unit. He started closing on units in December, although he hasn\u2019t completed the full buyout yet.\nWith flags planted in the other two sites, it came down to Harbor Towers. By April, sources say it was apparent that Ashi had secured the majority of units in Harbor Tower and was on the path to termination. In a last-ditch effort, Ross filed suit in Palm Beach County Circuit Court, accusing Ashi of playing dirty and demanding an injunction that would prevent termination. The suit also targeted Jessica Julian, the Douglas Elliman agent who helped Fort secure its majority of contracts. Representatives for Ross declined to comment on the litigation for this story.\n\u201cIt was a pretty normal block play,\u201d Glen Waldman, an attorney for Ashi, said. \u201cEvery time you have big boys playing in the sandbox, \u2026they fight, and that\u2019s what they do. They\u2019re not scared to fight.\u201d\nBy September, blades were drawn.\n\u201cThe only games being played here are by [Related] and its billionaire principal Stephen Ross,\u201d read a legal filing from the attorneys for Fort Partners, who in the same document called Ross\u2019 suit \u201cmeritless\u201d and his lawyers\u2019 latest tactics \u201ccomical.\u201d\nAshi\u2019s attorneys insisted Ross was stalling under the guise of nonexistent settlement talks, trying to block their efforts to depose him, a predictable move. Most billionaires try to avoid deposition.\n\u201cThere is no settlement,\u201d Ashi\u2019s attorneys declared in the filing. Waldman said the case was fairly straightforward and that Ashi had the numbers on his side.\n\u201cYou either have to bulldoze them, or settle with them,\u201d Waldman said, summarizing the strategy.\nAs of September, they both seemed poised to plow ahead. But why? Did Ross really want this site that much, or did he simply want to keep a rival off his turf?\nRepresentatives for Ross declined to comment on the suit. Whatever the reason, Adelson said, \u201cIt tells you how aggressive they feel they need to be to keep building in this market.\u201d\nK\nnock-out\nIn the end, they did settle. Terms of the deal are unclear, but Ashi is now in control of a slice of the city\u2019s precious waterfront. He\u2019ll be completing the termination of Harbor Towers.\nThe buyouts at Flagler House, La Fontana and Harbor Towers are merely the first few rounds in a years-long match-up between real estate\u2019s champion fighters, and between developers and unit owners.\n\u201cEventually, the economics are such that [developers] will be able to come to an agreement with most of the buildings on the water,\u201d Adelson said. \u201cIt may take a little while.\u201d\nSellers may also have to lower expectations, Prakas said. Other buildings have reached out to him and the Serhant team about buyout marketing, but they haven\u2019t pursued any deals yet.\n\u201cWhen we told them what we thought it was worth, they weren\u2019t as interested,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of these buildings thought they were going to get twice the market value.\u201d\nAt the right price, there\u2019s money for all parties.\n\u201cThese owners were making so much money,\u201d Ashi\u2019s attorney Waldman said of the Harbor Towers deal. \u201cThere are no losers here.\u201d",

        "content": "Scott Sherman still remembers when landlords could get top dollar asking rents for retail and restaurant spaces on Lincoln Road, the outdoor pedestrian mall in Miami Beach.\n\u201cEight years ago, rents got ridiculous,\u201d Sherman, who leads Miami-based Torose Equities, told The Real Deal. \u201cThey went from $150 to $300-plus a foot. Restaurants fled, national brands downsized and the street lost its energy.\u201d\nSherman, who was among the landlords steering the Lincoln Road Business Improvement District in the 2010s, returned to the street last year after nearly a decade, paying $10.4 million for a two-story building at 910 Lincoln Road that\u2019s leased to AllSaints, a clothing store.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always believed in the street,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pandemic and inflated rents reset everything. For the first time in years, the street\u2019s affordable enough for creative operators to come back.\u201d\nOnce Miami Beach\u2019s most famous pedestrian strip, Lincoln Road has spent the better part of the early 2020s trying to recover its footing. High rents, changing consumer tastes and the pandemic all gutted a corridor once teeming with national retailers and high-end restaurants. Now, some investors and commercial brokers are banking on the idea that a refreshed mix of restaurants, experiential tenants and lower rent expectations can again raise Lincoln Road\u2019s profile.\nSherman and other Lincoln Road experts see recent trades, such as retail and hospitality investor\nRobert Rivani\nbuying a building on the street (the former The Lincoln Theatre) that\u2019s leased to H&amp;M and other tenants, as the beginning of a long-overdue rebound.\n\u201cI think now is a good time to be getting in,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019re gonna see it turn the corner and continue to get better over the next couple of years.\u201d\nR\netailers run\nLincoln Road\u2019s tumble as one of South Florida\u2019s prime retail streets began in 2016, when asking rental rates peaked at around $325 a square foot, according to David Abrams of the commercial brokerage Masonre.\n\u201cIt took a hard nosedive right before Covid,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, Brickell, Design District, Wynwood \u2014 places where retail didn\u2019t really exist \u2014 started popping up. Tenants looking at the beach decided to go to these other neighborhoods.\u201d\nBrickell, Wynwood and the Design District are areas that have more people, more traffic, more density and more opportunities for top brands, noted Lyle Stern, CEO of Miami Beach-based Vertical Real Estate and president of the Lincoln Road Business Improvement District.\n\u201cLincoln Road certainly had its fair share of national tenants, and still has some,\u201d Stern said. \u201cBut one of the biggest issues is the perception of what Lincoln Road was. While some lament the Lincoln Road of yesteryear, the street is actually doing well.\u201d\nFor instance, the\noccupancy rate\non Lincoln Road is averaging 77 percent, and asking rents are around $150 to $225 a square foot, making the outdoor pedestrian mall competitive with such indoor malls as Brickell City Centre, Aventura Mall and Dadeland Mall, according to Stern.\n\u201cThe issue isn\u2019t vacancy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe universe of tenants that want to be on Lincoln Road is pretty significant. Some are national. Some are international. Some are regional and some have anywhere from one to three stores in Miami-Dade, Broward or Palm Beach counties.\u201d\nStern said that Miami Beach\u2019s own transformation is helping drive the rebound. \u201cThe wealth in this community has grown massively,\u201d he said. \u201cBetween Lincoln Road and Faena, there\u2019s $4 billion worth of development underway \u2014 the Shore Club, the Raleigh, the Aman, the Ritz expansion. And the Grand Hyatt convention hotel [currently under construction] will change everything. It will bring year-round customers to restaurants and shops.\u201d\nL\nower rents, new reality\nSherman, Abrams, and Stern all agree that the key is balancing a good mix of local and national retailers and restaurants. \u201cThe old model \u2014 national tenants overpaying for exposure \u2014 doesn\u2019t work here anymore,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cThe real story is smaller, independent operators coming back in at rents they can handle.\u201d\nStern calls the current asking rent range \u201chealthy\u201d compared to the frothy pre-Covid years. \u201cWe\u2019re competitive again,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd unlike Brickell or Aventura, Lincoln Road is still the only true pedestrian high street in South Florida. People want to walk, dine and linger. That\u2019s the advantage.\u201d\nLessons from the boom-and-bust cycle are fueling smarter deals this time around, according to Abrams. \u201cWhen you remove the greed and reset expectations, you can plan for the long term,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about flipping a building \u2014 it\u2019s about curating the right mix.\u201d\nIn some cases, he added, retailers are opting to buy spaces on Lincoln Road because of the value. Abrams represented Danny Harris and Marco DeGeorge, the founders of Beverly Hills-based Alo Yoga, in their $17 million purchase of the former Walgreens at\n100 Lincoln Road\n. Harris and DeGeorge are converting the space into a flagship store and private wellness club.\nRobert Rivani\u2019s investment is also a boost. In addition to buying 551 Lincoln Road, the building housing H&amp;M, Rivani is in the middle of a $40 million renovation of a mixed-use office building at\n1691 Michigan Avenue\n, which is just off Lincoln Road. Over the summer, Rivani landed\nPlayboy\nas a penthouse tenant under a 10-year lease. The iconic brand plans to relocate from Beverly Hills contingent on the city of Miami Beach providing $800,000 in incentives.\nNew tenants signal confidence in Lincoln Road\u2019s recovery. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see real movement,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cPlayboy moving its headquarters off Lincoln Road, Alo buying on the east end \u2014 those are dominoes falling in the right direction. The daytime population is coming back.\u201d\nFor Stephen DeMeo, a broker with Lee &amp; Associates, the fix isn\u2019t just about cheaper leases \u2014 it\u2019s about creativity. \u201cLincoln Road\u2019s lost its rhythm,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t fill it with stale apparel retailers and expect excitement. It needs activation \u2014 pop-up stores, rooftop events, wellness studios [and] cultural tie-ins.\u201d\nThe future is experiential, not transactional, DeMeo argues. \u201cPeople want something to do, not just something to buy,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a rooftop pickleball club, daily markets or a music series. Landlords should get flexible \u2014short-term deals, percentage rents, anything that keeps the block alive.\u201d\nDeMeo points to Rivani\u2019s building, where Playboy is planning a club and lounge, as examples of the vibe shift. \u201cThat kind of tenant brings cachet and curiosity, which Lincoln Road needs,\u201d DeMeo said. \u201cThe street has to feel like a scene again.\u201d",

        "content": "South Florida developers are increasingly looking to EB-5 funding to fill gaps in their capital stacks, as\nforeign investors\nrush to participate before the program expires.\nThe visa program, which provides green cards to investors and their immediate families whose funds lead to the creation of 10 full-time jobs for U.S. workers, has a minimum threshold of $800,000 for investment in rural areas or areas with high unemployment. That goes up to $1.05 million for projects outside of Targeted Employment Areas.\nEB-5 financing typically accounts for between 20 and 30 percent of a project\u2019s capital stack, replacing preferred equity. The funds are a loan, so if it all goes according to plan and the project is completed, it\u2019s a win-win for investors and developers.\n\u201cWhen we look at the people from Latin America coming in [to the U.S.], most of them are coming to get an education for their children, and sometimes the parents don\u2019t even come over,\u201d attorney Jill Jones, who has been involved in more than 600 EB-5 projects, said. \u201cThe parents will apply for the green card for the family. They\u2019ll send over their college-age children and purchase a condo for them to live in.\u201d\nThe program has been around since 1990 \u2014 yet experts predict a last-minute scramble driven by the demand for legal immigration. It\u2019s unknown if it will be renewed, especially as the Trump administration pushes its\ngolden visa program\nthrough. The golden visa, with a starting price tag of $1 million, is more expensive and the visa-seeker does not get any of that money back.\n\u201cA lot of foreigners want to get in before it\u2019s too late. There\u2019s a premium on legal immigration.\u201d\nAttorney Ronnie Fieldstone\nDevelopers and investors are keeping a close eye on two deadlines: grandfathered provisions expiring at the end of September 2026 and the expiration of the regional center program a year later in 2027.\nDespite the Trump administration\u2019s\ncrackdown\non immigration through mass deportations and aggressive ICE raids, the U.S. is \u201cstill the country of choice\u201d for immigrants, said attorney Ronnie Fieldstone, a partner at Saul Ewing.\nFieldstone, who has represented developers and regional centers involved in more than 450 EB-5 projects that have raised more than $8 billion, said that after September 30, 2027, the investment amount will increase based on cost of living.\n\u201cA lot of foreigners want to get in before it\u2019s too late,\u201d Fieldstone said. \u201cThere\u2019s a premium on legal immigration.\u201d\nT\nhe payoff\nDevelopers like EB-5 because it\u2019s a cheaper-alternative financing, Fieldstone said. And many have been tapping into the program for years without disclosing it to the public, including the Four Seasons Residences at the Surf Club, a\nFort Partners\ndevelopment in Surfside that was completed in 2017.\n\u201cThe fact is most [developers] keep it under the radar,\u201d Fieldstone said.\nOther projects that recently raised funds or are currently doing so via EB-5 include Fortune International Group\u2019s Ora by Casa Tua condo-hotel tower in Miami\u2019s Brickell, Fortune and Blue Road\u2019s Nexo Residences in North Miami Beach, SB Development Group and Hazelton Capital Group\u2019s Edgewater condo tower called Cove Miami and Okan Group\u2019s Okan Tower in downtown Miami. In Broward, the Related Group and Dezer Development\u2019s Armani/Casa Residences Pompano Beach, and Related, Tate Capital and Rok Enterprises\u2019s Bahia Mar are also tapping the EB-5 spigot.\nMost, if not all, of these developments have hospitality components, which makes it easier to fulfill EB-5\u2019s job-creation requirements.\n\u201cEventually [the program] will go away. There seems to be this urgency, especially with what\u2019s happening in the world with immigration.\u201d\nMichael Sadov\nMichael Sadov, sales director at the 70-story Okan Tower condo and hotel project under construction, agreed, calling it \u201cfree money for the developers.\u201d Okan\nannounced in August\nthat it was eligible to receive EB-5 funds and plans to release 30 investor slots at a time.\n\u201cEventually [the program] will go away,\u201d Sadov said. \u201cThere seems to be this urgency, especially with what\u2019s happening in the world with immigration.\u201d\nSadov said the developer, who is Turkish, is working with a dozen potential investors from Colombia, Mexico and Turkey. (The developer is Turkish.) Colombians have been the biggest buyer pool among\nforeign buyers\nin South Florida in recent years, but it\u2019s become harder for them to come. Trump, who has been feuding with Colombian president Gustavo Petro, recently threatened to raise tariffs on Colombia and stop all payments to the country.\nCompass agent Mike Martirena expects to see more foreign buyers from countries like Colombia invest in EB-5 projects. His team has brokered deals to Colombian and Brazilian investors at Alta Development\u2019s River District 14, a condo development in the Miami River neighborhood.\n\u201cThis is a smart way to get money out of the country,\u201d Martirena said.\nF\nlip side\nEB-5 isn\u2019t for everyone.\nOnly 10,000 visas are available per year. The upfront cost of becoming an EB-5 designated project can deter investors, according to Fieldstone.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019ll raise the money,\u201d he said.\nJones also explained that it\u2019s more complicated than traditional bank lending.\n\u201cWith that comes a lot of reporting and assurances that a developer not using EB-5 wouldn\u2019t have to do,\u201d she said. \u201cThey would need to have someone on their team that could track how many investors came in, how many jobs were created that can be allocated to each investor and making sure that the EB-5 money is never commingled with other operating funds. These are things that they wouldn\u2019t face in other types of finance. They have to be very patient.\u201d\nWhether a developer raises EB-5 funds directly or uses a regional center will affect the timeline.\nInvestors are also vulnerable to their own set of issues. How long it takes investors to receive their green cards depends on where they hail from. Mainland China and India have waiting lists that are years long, but the processing time for investors from other countries can be as quick as a few months to secure conditional residency, and two years before it becomes permanent, Jones said.\nInvestors have also fallen victim to fraud and stalled projects.\nDeveloper Dan Kodsi\u2019s Legacy Hotel &amp; Residences project at Miami Worldcenter has been on hold for well over a year. Kodsi raised money via EB-5 for the planned 50-story condo-hotel tower, just as he did with Paramount Miami Worldcenter. But Legacy is tied up in a messy foreclosure lawsuit, and construction stalled last year \u2014 exactly when the project was supposed to be completed.\nUp and down South Florida\u2019s coastline, investors have also sued the developers of a handful of projects over alleged mismanagement or misappropriation of funds. In 2023, Chinese nationals sued the ex-developer of the former U.S. immigration building site in Miami\u2019s Upper Eastside, alleging the misappropriation of more than $50 million in investor funds.\nMuch of the opportunity for fraud was eliminated with the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022, experts say.\n\u201cThe worst thing [that can happen],\u201d Fieldstone said, \u201cis they lose their money and don\u2019t get a green card.\u201d",

        "content": "The week restaurateur Tyler Wells reopened his Altadena restaurant after the Eaton fire, Compass agent Teresa Fuller snapped up a reservation.\nThe scene was both joyous and painful. The restaurant, formerly Bernee and now called Betsy, had great food \u2014 a farm-to-table concept whose white anchovy-topped Caesar salad and wood-oven cheesecake were renowned within weeks. But steps away, diners could see the hollowed-out Woodbury Building, a reminder of the destruction caused by January\u2019s fire.\n\u201cI knew every single person\nin the restaurant\n,\u201d Fuller said. \u201cI got emotional. It was overwhelming.\u201d She lives and works in nearby Pasadena, while her home gets remediated. She lost her storage space for staging supplies and business records while her office got tested for heavy metals.\nOn Saturday nights since, it\u2019s become normal again to see Betsy patrons sitting outside on Altadena\u2019s Mariposa Street, an ordinariness many have craved since Jan. 7 when the Palisades and Eaton fires ripped through, destroying more than 18,000 structures, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Fuller also frequents the Good Neighbor Bar and West Altadena Wine and Spirits, all in a bid to bring life back.\nThe fires were devastating, but it was\nafter the flames were tamed\nthat all hell broke loose. Government leaders scrambled for a game plan, inflamed residents pointed fingers, onlookers added their two cents, insurance was a terror, tariffs took on a new toll and opportunists entered the picture.\nBetween the recovery, the outrage and the concern, the real estate industry in the region has settled into a new role. They\u2019re not just brokers or builders behind the rush to rebuild; they\u2019re also sounding boards, community leaders, experts in how to price homes when there are no comps and even economic development players who now understand the importance of normal routines \u2014 like Saturday nights out at an up-and-coming spot \u2014 returning in Altadena and the Palisades.\n\u201cWe need to eliminate this fear of being a dead town,\u201d Carolwood Estates\u2019 Nichole Shanfeld said.\nI\nt\u2019s all personal\nWestside Estate Agency\u2019s JJ Meyers was grabbing coffee and walking his dog when the Palisades Fire broke out.\nHe watched in real time as local news filmed the burning home of a friend\u2019s parents, their family clock being carried out.\nWhen the fires were controlled and the city began its recovery, the real estate industry picked up early on residents\u2019 concerns and misgivings.\n\u201cImmediately, the [client] inquiries were, \u2018What do you know that I don\u2019t know?\u2019 There was such a general distrust immediately,\u201d Meyers recalled. \u201cIt was like they were coming to us because they didn\u2019t believe the information they were getting. It was helping give people a general level of respect they didn\u2019t feel they were getting.\u201d\nThe bottom line: Brokers were living the disaster along with their clients.\n\u201cOn a personal level, I love Kagawa. Every year, there were Halloween parties, Super Bowl parties, USC events, BBQs, you name it.\u201d\nJeffrey Sandorf, vice president of Southern California division sales at Thomas James Homes on the mostly destroyed street where his firm will soon finish the area\u2019s first rebuilt house\nJacqueline Chernov, who joined the Beverly Hills Estates earlier this year from Compass, had her Palisades homes \u2014 a Spanish-style residence in the Huntington and the family property of 22 years in the Alphabet Streets \u2014 destroyed by the fire.\nThe number of temporary homes she\u2019s lived in has now crept into the double digits; Chernov\u2019s currently in a Malibu rental and hopes it can be home until her actual home is rebuilt. She does have a permit pulled for the Huntington home. At the Alphabet Streets property, she\u2019s changed the plans and is not in a rush to rebuild.\nChernov was underinsured on both properties and is still awaiting money from State Farm. She described the insurance company \u2014 the largest home and auto insurer in the state \u2014 as difficult and chalks that up to a business model that holds the purse strings closed long enough for some people to give up on their claims. Hiring an adjuster to see the claims through to resolution and giving up 25 percent wasn\u2019t an option.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this as another full-time job,\u201d Chernov said of the insurance.\nHer only break was a trip this summer to Amsterdam, for her daughter\u2019s wedding. It was good to be out of town for a while, she said.\nT\nhis is client service\nOn Jan. 22, a group of agents sat huddled in the living room of a Hollywood Hills home unsure of what was next and what they could do.\nThey discussed navigating new price-gouging rules, insurance, what the burned communities would be rebuilt into and, of course, Measure ULA.\nThe city of Los Angeles\u2019 two-tier tax, also referred to as the mansion tax, has been a thorn in real estate\u2019s side since it went into effect in April 2023. Charging a blanket 4 percent tax on properties starting at $5.3 million and 5.5 percent on those $10.6 million or more is absurd, the industry has repeatedly cried.\nIn the Palisades, which is within the city of Los Angeles, paying a tax on a sale that\u2019s resulted from a natural disaster makes even less sense, some argue.\nIn early October, Mayor Karen Bass asked the city council to pass a temporary pause on the measure, offering a glimmer of hope.\n\u201cIt should 100 percent be passed. It should have been passed at the beginning of any sales,\u201d Shanfeld said. \u201cIn the Palisades, these poor people having to pay the city on land that they lost, nothing infuriates me more.\u201d\nFor a while, in January and February, the workload was all fire-impacted clients, all the time. That included advocacy work, like the ULA fight.\nThe workload has shifted since then.\nSome, like Chernov, split time between fire clients and regular listings in other parts of L.A. County. Others, like Shanfeld, focus on clients who sought whatever temporary housing they could get immediately after the fires now looking for better digs elsewhere. Still others have clients who are simply holding their lots and staying put completely outside of the burned areas in places such as Brentwood, Ojai, Santa Barbara or even as far as Tennessee.\nBrokers who are still working with the fire-affected often hold their hands through challenges like dealing with insurance, which they are gaining first-hand experience in themselves.\nLike Chernov, many clients have chosen to handle insurance on their own, rather than tap an adjuster for an additional fee, according to architecture firm Archicraft.\n\u201cFrom an insurance perspective, they want to pay as little as possible and, as a homeowner, you want to get as much as possible,\u201d Archicraft U.S. Partner Tyler Vaughn said. \u201cMost people don\u2019t realize it\u2019s a game of chess, and they don\u2019t know the rules.\u201d\nThe firm has one client in Altadena and six in the Palisades \u2014 five homeowners and a recreation center project in the Highlands under the Palisades Hills HOA. The firm and others like it have been the first line of assistance for some clients navigating insurance on top of the actual design process.\nRising construction costs of anywhere from $650 to $1,100 per square foot have exacerbated challenges. Meanwhile, insurance companies are coming back with quotes of $350 a foot.\n\u201cThe insurance has been the most frustrating,\u201d Chernov said. \u201cI just got off the phone with one of the builders and they were saying clients needed to pick all their finishes, plumbing and appliances because they got notice everyone was raising prices by 9 percent.\u201d\nP\nolitical games\nIt was July 7, when a group of five protestors stood outside Pasadena City College\u2019s Westerbeck Recital Hall holding up posters declaring \u201cHome Sweet Hazmat\u201d and \u201cStep Up! Clean It Up!\u201d\n\u201cThere is no recovery without remediation,\u201d shouted Grace Regullano, whose Pasadena home sits about 400 yards from the Eaton Fire\u2019s southern edge. \u201cWe have been left alone. We are breathing the toxins in our walls. There is asbestos in my office. There is lead in my soil. My children cannot go home. All we are asking for is for Newsom to speak with us and explain why we are not getting support to clean up the toxins.\u201d\nThere was no better way to grab the attention of problems fire survivors didn\u2019t feel were being addressed than to gather where news outlets would be, waiting bored in the hot sun for security clearance to enter the auditorium and hear local and state officials discuss the state of rebuilding at the fires\u2019 six-month mark.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom was among the speakers to tout what has now been repeatedly cast across press conferences and press releases as the \u201cfastest recovery in modern history\u201d when it comes to debris removal.\nChest pumping\u2019s left a bad taste for some, especially with Newsom sitting for a cover story in October\u2019s Bloomberg Businessweek, a splashy headline casting him as the leader of the Trump resistance. The article\u2019s opening scene setter suggested January\u2019s wildfires could have been the collapse of his political career.\nInstead, he\u2019s rebuilt his profile with vehicles such as Prop 50 \u2014 the ballot measure that would redraw Congressional district maps as pushback to Texas\u2019 redistricting \u2014 and made housing advocates happy by aggressively going after non-compliant cities when it comes to residential development. Most recently, he signed off on Senate Bill 79 aimed at adding density close to transit stops.\nThat the National Guard and federal officers were deployed to MacArthur Park in Los Angeles\u2019 Westlake neighborhood the same day as the six-month anniversary briefing in Pasadena may have helped further swing the trajectory for Newsom. The governor seized on the timing in a briefing with the media immediately following the presentations.\n\u201cWhat a disgrace that\u2019s happening at MacArthur Park. What theater on the six-month anniversary of these fires,\u201d Newsom spit out as the cameras rolled and pens flew across paper.\nThe politically charged atmosphere tied to the fires hasn\u2019t been limited to Sacramento.\nSome homes in the Palisades have signs calling for Bass\u2019 resignation. In Altadena, it\u2019s become an urban planning fight against gentrification and speculative development that\u2019s led to the Altadena Not for Sale movement\u2019s rise. Signs for the group stick out from the dirt or remaining lawns outside many homes.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much misinformation,\u201d Anthony Marguleas, a longtime Palisades broker and owner of Amalfi Estates,\nsaid\nin September, sitting in the kitchen of his Corsica Drive listing, in the Riviera neighborhood. \u201cThere\u2019s a couple people online that are so politically charged, who are so anti-Mayor Bass and so anti-Newsom and so conspiracy theorist. I\u2019m not going to talk about the whole political conversation. All I care about is our town being rebuilt.\u201d\nMany agents have taken the same route: heads down, focused on their jobs.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t paid attention to the [media] coverage,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cMy main focus has been the people that I can help.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t listen to that noise,\u201d Chernov said.\nThe only political gambit they\u2019re happy to broach: ULA. \u201cI mean, the only noise that could be positive is if the mayor really does take away ULA for fire victims,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a gamechanger.\u201d\nV\nillains and bad guys\nIt was early August when news came out that Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California agents Weston Littlefield and Alex Howe represented an overseas buyer on\nthe purchase of nine burned lots\nin Malibu totaling more than $65 million. That number\u2019s since climbed to 15 lots.\nSome on social media went berserk.\nThere were calls for Malibu City Council intervention. Others blasted the idea of \u201cforeigners\u201d buying U.S. land and shook their fists at the agents facilitating the deals.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a general misconception sometimes when a foreign investor quote-unquote makes a large investment into a city,\u201d Howe said in August, at the time the deals were uncovered. \u201cIt can be perceived the wrong way.\u201d\nThe buyer is a company called Zuru Tech US, an El Segundo-based subsidiary of Zuru Group in Hong Kong. The business was started by New Zealand toymaker brothers Nick and Mat Mowbray. Zuru Tech US is the company\u2019s prefab housing arm.\nZuru Tech US Director of Operations Marcel Fontijn was shocked by the reactions to the lot purchases.\n\u201cThey made us look like a villain, but we did not end up with 15 lots by putting guns to people\u2019s heads,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAll of these people were ready or desperate to sell. It\u2019s just like the guy that won the lottery [who\u2019s] buying in the Altadena area. He\u2019s not taking advantage of people. He\u2019s not abusing people. People want to sell.\u201d\n\u201cThe only noise that could be positive is if the mayor really does take away ULA for fire victims.\u201d\nJacqueline Chernov, broker at Beverly Hills Estates\nThe Powerball winner is Edwin Castro, who is using the prize money to fund a real estate investment vehicle called Black Lion Properties. The company had acquired 13 lots as of Sept. 28, according to the Altadena Not for Sale group, with the total investment over $8 million.\nZuru Tech contemplated purchases in the Palisades but decided working with one municipality would be easiest. So far, there have been initial conversations with the city of Malibu; Fontijn estimated the first of the houses using the company\u2019s factory-built homes could be installed starting in late 2026 in a process that takes roughly two to three months.\nFontijn said he still fields inquiries from sellers, although the company\u2019s running close to the end of its spending spree. Still, the executive can\u2019t shake how some spun the purchases into a narrative of another kind.\n\u201cI really felt we were doing something good and then some of the comments, they were nasty,\u201d Fontijn said. \u201cSome said that we were using Chinese money to kick people out of Malibu. Nobody kicked anybody out of Malibu, and it\u2019s not Chinese money either. It\u2019s U.S. money that we\u2019re investing back into the U.S. economy. Yes, obviously, at the end of the day, we\u2019re a business. We\u2019ve all got to make some money, but it\u2019s not about taking advantage of people that lost their homes, not at all.\u201d\nFor agents, the nasty comments aren\u2019t new, especially for communities that see themselves as unique and want to protect that from change.\n\u201cI understand the mindset of wanting to guard that character,\u201d Fuller in Altadena said. \u201cI also think that we have to trust our neighbors. They need to do what they need to do, and we can\u2019t understand everyone\u2019s circumstances. There has been a fear that developers would come in from the outside and build homes that might change the character of what was.\u201d But, she added, many of the developer-built homes \u201care quite thoughtful.\u201d\nSomehow, the good guys are getting mixed in with the bad guys who have lowballed offers or are mounting what some would say are cheap-looking spec homes. Agents say inquiries from vulture investors have subsided since the fire\u2019s early days. Many of the out-of-town buyers are not factoring in a parcel\u2019s lineage or an entire community when running the numbers. A family or another buyer who does will beat the misinformed offers on any day, agents said.\n\u201cI understand this is a business, but we need to respect the process,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the receiving end of disrespectful offers from people out of town: here\u2019s an offer at one-tenth of your asking price with a very generic letter, not taking into account the pain these people might be going through, pouring salt in the wound.\u201d\nH\nome sweet home\nCommercial tenants have generally come back first. The Palisades is expected to see the reopening of Rick Caruso\u2019s upscale retail center Palisades Village next year, and a plan to redevelop the Gladstones site on Will Rogers State Beach into a Frank Gehry-designed two-story restaurant operated by Wolfgang Puck received a California Coastal Commission development permit last month.\nResidential neighborhoods, by contrast, are in the very early stages of construction or environmental remediation.\nAsilomar Boulevard, in the Palisades\u2019 El Medio Bluffs neighborhood, counted 16 residences with views of the Pacific Ocean. Since January, it also overlooks the ruins of the community\u2019s burned beachfront homes. It\u2019s a sobering reminder of just how much more work is ahead of communities and the industry.\nBut slowly, frames of new homes have begun to go up.\nThomas James Homes will complete its roughly 6,500-square-foot lot in the Alphabet Streets later this month. It will be the first home rebuilt in the neighborhood.\nJeffrey Sandorf, vice president of Southern California division sales at Thomas James Homes, is a fourth-generation Palisadian, with kids who are the fifth. His family goes back 70 years, so rebuilding hits close to home for the Sandorfs.\nPre-fire Thomas James Homes completed more than 60 projects in the community and is now working with more than 30 families on their rebuilds. So far, the company has pulled seven permits and has 10 in plan check with the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety.\nThe home, at 915 Kagawa Street, is meant to be a showcase for the community, an example of what the next phase here will look like, as well as a venue for workshops and education.\nRight now, the company is guaranteeing a starting price of $650 per square foot and completion in one year or less. Services are in house, and Thomas James has a pre-curated set of plans for homeowners to choose from, which can shave weeks or even months off the design phase.\nSandorf was so busy with the workload he couldn\u2019t take a call from Amalfi Estates\u2019 Marguleas back in September when the broker phoned to say he was on his way to the Kagawa Street property to walk a reporter through the construction site.\n\u201cThis is such a passion for me personally and I\u2019m so proud that Thomas James Homes is going to be able to complete a house, furnish it and open it up to the public to give a sense of hope of what\u2019s to come and give some tangibility to the rebuild,\u201d Sandorf said.\nIt gives him chills to think about that milestone.\n\u201cOn a personal level, I love Kagawa,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of my friends lived on Kagawa; they still own their properties. Every year, there were Halloween parties, Super Bowl parties, USC events, BBQs, you name it. I was on Kagawa a lot. When I drive up and down, it\u2019s a much different landscape.\u201d\nThat\u2019s slowly changing. The agents, brokers, developers, architects and construction crews on the ground will tell you they\u2019ve already turned the page on the jarring images of burned lots piled with debris that caught the nation\u2019s attention and are living the next chapter.\n\u201cThat was the story before,\u201d Carolwood\u2019s Shanfeld said. \u201cNow, we\u2019re in a different part of the story and it\u2019s important that it be reflected because that\u2019s where we\u2019re at.\u201d",

        "content": "At the age of 13, an awkward time to change schools, Corinne Verdery moved from Oahu, Hawaii, to Mission Viejo in Orange County with her parents and younger sister.\nIt was a different world.\n\u201cI\u2019m in a classroom and everybody\u2019s got blonde hair,\u201d Verdery, now CEO of Caruso, said. \u201cI think it shaped me back then to know how to pivot and adapt and embrace the uncomfortable.\u201d As a result, she added, \u201cI love to work on anything new and different that I\u2019ve never done before.\u201d\nVerdery\u2019s\ncareer\nhas been eclectic. She worked in the theme park division of NBC Universal and at Alagem Capital Group, where she was instrumental in bringing the Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills to life, steering the project through 19 public hearings and a citywide ballot measure.\nShe started at billionaire\nRick Caruso\n\u2019s real estate development and management firm as executive vice president of development in September 2016, then shifted to chief development officer before being tapped as CEO in September 2022. She has overseen the development of the Rosewood Miramar Beach resort and Palisades Village for Caruso, who ran for mayor in 2022 and may mount another bid or aim for governor. The developer has also been front and center in the wildfire recovery, starting the nonprofit Steadfast LA in February to speed rebuilding.\nCaruso founded his Los Angeles-based firm in 1987. Its portfolio is predominantly\nretail\nand restaurants and includes The Grove in Fairfax (where the firm is based), Palisades Village in the Pacific Palisades (slated to reopen in August), The Americana at Brand in Glendale, Village at Moorpark and The Lakes at Thousand Oaks. More residences are on the way and the firm is also eyeing assets beyond California.\nWith Verdery at the helm of the 130-employee company, Caruso recorded its best financial results in 2024, with about 7 percent net operating income growth year over year across all asset classes, with the number on pace to tick up this year.\nOn an overcast day in Los Angeles,\nThe Real Deal\nchatted with Verdery over tea on the second floor of La Piazza restaurant at The Grove.\nThe interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\nBorn\n: February 23, 1970\nHometown\n: Oahu, Hawaii\nLives\n: Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles\nFamily\n: Husband Tyler and twin 20-year-old daughters\nIn February 2022, Rick Caruso announced a succession plan with you elevated to CEO should he be elected as mayor of Los Angeles. But he wasn\u2019t, and you were still appointed CEO that September. What led to you actually being brought on as CEO?\nWe have basically organized into two businesses: development, which buys the properties, entitles and builds; and operations. I came on as the head of development. I think a year before he announced he was running, we started talking about me stepping into the CEO role. I really love development and growing the business, but he needed me and I wanted him to become our\nmayor\n, both as a resident and as an employee of the company. We were coming out of Covid, we were coming out of riots and a lot of disruption in the city, and I really felt like, as an employee, we needed that kind of leadership to protect our investment and our business in Los Angeles. We agreed that I would step into the CEO role if he became mayor. But during the primary, it was clear that the company needed my leadership on a daily basis, because he was spending so much time on the campaign. I had already started doing the job once he announced, to be honest.\nDid you think that role would continue after he lost?\nHe really wanted me to be in the CEO role. I had already promoted someone to succeed me, and he was doing great.\nWhat\u2019s the greatest challenge in replacing a \u201cpersonality-driven\u201d founder?\nI respect and admire his ability to trust me in my day-to-day decision making. That has to be hard. But we are good partners. I know what he\u2019s brilliant at. He knows where my strengths are. And so three years later, I think we have a great rhythm. It\u2019s been bumpy at times, but overall I think we\u2019ve landed in a great place.\nWhat\u2019s an example of a bumpy time?\nWe had talked about me being the CEO and what my job was going to be, but we didn\u2019t talk about what it was going to be like with him still in the company. And so we had situations in meetings where the teams would present to us, and they would be looking at both of us, like, who\u2019s going to make this decision?\n\u201c[In 2017,] we figured out there are these private firefighting companies that most companies that own real estate have. We\u2019ve had to call upon them almost every year. That day of the Palisades fire, the teams were in place.\u201d\nWhen I interview a woman or someone of color for The Closing, I like to ask what it\u2019s like working in a field dominated by white men. Do you encounter discrimination in the boardroom?\nI\u2019ve always been in a male-dominated industry. I guess I\u2019ve never tried to change it. I\u2019ve always just embraced it as \u201cthis is what it is. I\u2019m going to focus on my strengths and my contributions, and focus on the work.\u201d I\u2019m sure that I\u2019ve been in situations and places where there\u2019s discrimination going on in the boardroom or in the company. It\u2019s like, \u201cIf you guys are going to go golfing and smoke cigars, just call me when you\u2019re done. I\u2019ll be here doing my work.\u201d I\u2019ve never tried to be part of that boys\u2019 club.\nHow about a girls\u2019 club?\nI realized when I became CEO there were a lot of expectations about how I was going to lead. I didn\u2019t focus on changing the company, but I did recognize that there was this need to figure out within this company and within this industry, how do women rise to the top? So I formed a women\u2019s resource group within Caruso. We have outside speakers and programs to give this group of women in the company the support and the encouragement and the coaching that they need. This wasn\u2019t intentional, but since I\u2019ve been CEO, the mix of the company now is 50-50 men and women, from 60-40 before. Women in leadership roles is now over 50 percent.\nYou\u2019re from Hawaii, right?\nI\u2019m from the North Shore of Oahu, born and raised.\nHow\u2019d you get here?\nMy parents were high school sweethearts. They got married and had me when they were 18, and I was born and raised on the North Shore, fourth generation on both sides, born on the islands, and they just wanted our lives to be more. They didn\u2019t go to college. My dad went to two-year business school and then took a job in California to get us off the island and hopefully give us a different and brighter future. When we left the North Shore, our names were in the paper.\nWhy the paper?\nPeople didn\u2019t get up and move to the mainland.\nLet\u2019s shift gears to the Palisades. What was the experience like having your complex survive when everything around it was decimated?\nIt was a devastating time. I still get choked up about it. In our company, we build these centers of town, and in order to get that right, you spend a lot of time, many years and months developing relationships with community members. By the time you open and are operating, you know people by name that come and visit your property and frequent the restaurants and the shops and it was hard to see their homes devastated. I feel like we\u2019re turning a corner now, and everyone is focused on, let\u2019s get Palisades Village reopened. There will be new elements of the design and the property and some new tenants, so that when we reopen in August, it\u2019s fresh.\nWhat work are you doing at Palisades Village?\nThere was smoke damage and water damage. So we\u2019re gutting a lot of the spaces and the apartments down to the studs because the smoke is in the studs and installation. The park in the center of the property sits on the parking structure. We removed all the dirt and we\u2019re going to put all new grass and landscaping in.\nHow much will that project cost?\nI don\u2019t have a recent estimate, but it\u2019s at least $50 million.\nCaruso got criticized for employing private firefighters to save the shopping center while most of the community burned to the ground. How did you deal with that criticism?\nWe learned about fires in 2017 when there were deadly fires and floods in Montecito. We were under construction in both the Palisades Village and the Rosewood Miramar Beach hotel in Montecito. The Montecito Fire Department said if the fire jumps the freeway, we\u2019re not going to be able to help you. That\u2019s when we figured out there are these private firefighting companies that most companies that own real estate have. Since that Montecito fire, we\u2019ve had to call upon them almost every year. And so that day of the Palisades fire, the teams were in place. They come with their own crew and water trucks filled with water. We fought shoulder to shoulder with the fire department and we saved several of the buildings around Palisades Village that weren\u2019t our buildings. That doesn\u2019t get reported on. The fire department hooked up to our water trucks when they needed water.\nDid any employees lose their home in the fires?\nRick\u2019s children lost their homes in the Palisades. I think some employees received smoke damage, but nobody [else] lost their homes.\nThe kids aren\u2019t employees, though, right?\nOne of them is. Justin Caruso works for the company. He is in our real estate development group. And the children are board members. We formed the board during Rick\u2019s mayoral campaign. We were getting ready if he was to be mayor, we wanted a board in place. It\u2019s myself and two other executives, as well as his four kids, that sit on the board. Rick\u2019s on it now because he didn\u2019t win. He\u2019s our board chair.\nWhat is your career \u201cSliding Doors\u201d moment?\nOnce I knew I was going to start a family, and I was pregnant with my twin girls, I knew that I had to change my career trajectory because if I wanted to be happy in my marriage and be a good mom, then I couldn\u2019t get on a plane anymore. I was doing global real estate around the world for Universal. I was gone two weeks out of every month. I decided that I was going to quit Universal and take a more local job. That\u2019s when I went to work for Alagem Capital and did the Waldorf Astoria. And so as I look back on my career, it bums me out sometimes that I turned down a lot of global work. But it\u2019s not a regret. I\u2019m happily married. My girls are awesome. I got to spend so much time with them. I never missed anything that they did, and I volunteered just like the other moms that don\u2019t work.\nWhat was your last vacation destination?\nJapan in early June. This was the first time in a year that we had been on vacation together because the two girls have different schedules.\nLet\u2019s do an Oahu, Hawaii, versus California lightning round. Poke bowl or fish taco?\nFish taco.\nFor breakfast, Spam or avocado toast?\nAvocado toast. [Later, Verdery admitted that her answer is really Spam but she was embarrassed to admit it!]\nShave ice or frozen lemonade?\nShaved ice.\nThey have it in California.\nIt\u2019s not the same here. There the syrups I feel like are different. In Hawaii they have more tropical flavors, and they put different things in the shaved ice. So you can have adzuki beans, you can have ice cream, you can have condensed milk on the top. Also they perfected the machine that shaves the ice; it\u2019s much more fine. Here it\u2019s like chunks of ice. There, it\u2019s like powder.\nAnd you said \u201cshaved,\u201d but isn\u2019t it actually \u201cshave ice\u201d?\nI call it shaved ice.\nWaikiki Beach or Malibu Surfrider Beach?\nI don\u2019t like Waikiki Beach because there are a lot of tourists, so can I say North Shore beaches?\nHiking Diamond Head or Runyon Canyon?\nDiamond Head.\nHot, humid Oahu summer or dry, sunny SoCal summer?\nOahu summer.\nLush rainforest trails or desert hikes in Joshua Tree?\nRainforest trails.\nA luau or a beach bonfire?\nLuau.\nUkulele jams or guitar sessions?\nUkulele jams. I just like the sound of the ukulele better.\nWeekend trip to the North Shore or Big Sur road trip?\nNorth Shore weekend.\nHawaii sunset or California sunset?\nHawaii sunset.",

        "content": "On a Monday afternoon in February 2019, Chicago developer James Letchinger was staring expressionless at his wall, trying to process the most crucial moment of his career.\nLetchinger, whose JDL Development is arguably the biggest developer in the city, had just gotten word from his investment partner, prolific real estate fundraiser Larry Krueger, about the land in River North they were trying to buy from the Catholic church.\nThey had just closed on a deal to fund its massive development. The title company called to confirm.\n\u201cI was literally in shock,\u201d Letchinger said. \u201cI was desperate. I had a lot of money at risk.\u201d\nHe\u2019d learned from Krueger that they were set to buy the property for upwards of $100 million. From his desk at the office, then in Goose Island, he could see their plans for the property at 14 West Superior Street: a two-tower, mixed-use building, 77 floors at the tallest point. It would be called One Chicago.\nSix years later, on the last day of September 2025, Letchinger was staring at a wall in his new office in that very building, now the eighth-tallest skyscraper in the city. He was having another solitary, somewhat stoic celebration. Within his sightline this time were the plans for\nFoundry Park\n, a $1 billion-plus development on 28 acres of the former Lincoln Yards site, which he had just closed on with Los Angeles-based Kayne Anderson\nfor $84 million\n.\nThe project, as famous for being huge as for being stalled, has been a political and financial disaster. Previous developer Sterling Bay was going to turn it into a $6 billion behemoth spanning the Chicago River along 53 acres of waterfront land beside wealthy\nLincoln Park\nand gentrified Bucktown.\nBut its lender, Bank OZK, ran out of patience with delinquent debt owed by\nSterling\nand its previous investment partner Lone Star Funds, and seized the property. Letchinger\nbought his parcel\non the north side of the river from Bank OZK in a deal that took a lot of energy, knowledge and relationships, but getting the project done won\u2019t be just another feather in his cap.\nFoundry Park\u2019s momentum also underscores the revival of Chicago\u2019s megadevelopment market on several sprawling sites that have sat fallow for years. In September, The 78 \u2014 an $8 billion development \u2014 got an important approval, and a separate South Side project secured land for its multibillion-dollar quantum computing facility.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy when you have the money. Things can go fast.\u201d\njames Letchinger\nCorporate commitments to Chicago had become harder to land after former mayor Rahm Emannuel, perceived as business friendly, was replaced by a reformist candidate in Lori Lightfoot. The city\u2019s reputation suffered under barrages of attacks from the first Trump administration and amid viral images of destructive racial justice protests in 2020, when Lightfoot ordered river bridges raised to keep disorder out of the Loop. Lightfoot\u2019s succession by an even more unabashedly progressive mayor, Brandon Johnson, exacerbated concerns of investors.\nAdd in the national drop in commercial property values, and the overriding force for development in the city was inertia. Sure, Letchinger and Krueger got One Chicago done, but it wasn\u2019t a magic button for the even bigger swings.\nNow, with a few megaprojects set to move forward, every Chicago real estate owner has a stake in the outcome. Shepherding them to completion isn\u2019t just good for morale, it\u2019s crucial for the city to dodge more dreaded property tax hikes \u2014 Johnson is already wrestling with how to plug a $1.2 billion budget hole for 2026. And officials throughout all reaches of government \u2014 the statehouse, Cook County offices and ward and precinct-level leaders \u2014 are scrambling for legislative solutions that could spare homeowners from facing foreclosures over unpaid bills as their property taxes skyrocket.\nBut maybe all they needed was Letchinger and Foundry Park.\n\u201cJim is a problem solver. He takes projects others find difficult or uneconomic and he finds a way to make them work,\u201d said Krueger, who runs the commercial property investment firm\nWanxiang America Real Estate Group\non behalf of a Chinese family with an auto parts fortune.\nS\nmall firm, big backers\nWhen it kicked off in 2016, Lincoln Yards was supposed to be Chicago\u2019s biggest project in decades. Proposals started grand, with soccer stadiums and skyscrapers, but ultimately shrunk for zoning approval.\nThe Foundry Park Letchinger\u2019s building could create nearly 3,300 homes, mostly rentals with some for-sale options, as well as 350,000 square feet of office space, 435,000 square feet of retail, 250,000 square feet of hospitality and 12 acres of open space, according to city records. It\u2019s far less commercial workspace than Sterling Bay had planned, but it will be the biggest project of Letchinger\u2019s career.\nLetchinger, son of a salesman, was born and raised in Chicago. He went to the Latin School of Chicago and graduated from the University of Michigan. He learned \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d in college, he said.\nHe got into business, with a lighting showroom in River North that targeted architects and designers as clientele, which served as his introduction to real estate. Development fit his maverick nature. His first project, in 1993, was a building on Walton Street that he purchased from the co-op of an adjacent luxury building whose residents included Chicago business heavyweights, including the late Jay Pritzker. The co-op board insisted he had to buy without a financing contingency.\n\u201cI knew nothing. I walked out of the meeting and called my banker and asked, \u2018What\u2019s a financing contingency?\u2019\u201d Letchinger said.\nHe did the deal and converted the property into condos.\nFor the next decade, he worked on midscale, for-sale residential properties. The Great Financial Crisis almost ruined him, but he got through and became a big-time rental and condo highrise developer backed by institutional capital. His firm consists of just a handful of people, including his son, Joey, who skipped college (with dad\u2019s blessing) to become a sommelier and wine broker in New York before returning to Chicago and JDL.\n\u201cGrowing up, it wasn\u2019t like he went to work, he came home and there was separation,\u201d Joey said. \u201cHis work has always been a very important part of our family. Every single night of the week, having dinner and talking, it was mostly about what JDL is doing.\u201d\nThough Letchinger happily remains the face of his projects, he has partnered with a Who\u2019s Who of high finance and CRE titans to raise money when he needs it. That list includes Square Mile Capital, now Affinius, Prudential and Wanxiang.\nIn 2011, he teamed with Hines to break ground in Old Town on Chicago\u2019s first major multifamily project post-2008 recession. They sold the resulting property for $163 million, a record price per unit at the time.\nFrom there, Letchinger took on several large projects, ranging from the South Loop to Wrigleyville. He has a role in the office development underway at 919 West Fulton Street, as well as a slice of The Parker Fulton Market apartment building. He built the luxury condos No. 9 Walton at 9 West Walton Street, where Governor J.B. Pritzker just bought a multi-floor spread from fellow billionaire Ken Griffin.\n\u201cIt almost killed me,\u201d Letchinger said. JDL had been involved in building out each fully customized unit for a discerning crowd.\nWith the deal for The Parker earlier this year, Letchinger became a buyer rather than builder. JDL partnered with the family office of John Schreiber, the Lake Forest resident who co-founded Blackstone Real Estate Advisors, to purchase that property for $93 million. They teamed up again when Schreiber bought the Cobbler Square Lofts in Old Town for about $90 million.\nJDL is also making progress on the $1.3 billion North Union, its transformation of the former Moody Bible Institute into more than 2,600 dwellings.\n\u201cWhen I closed on Foundry, my wife looked at me and said, \u2018So you\u2019re not retiring?\u2019 No. I\u2019ve got a good 20 years left,\u201d Letchinger, 62, said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll never retire.\u201d\nR\nelationship business\nDuring his 15-year building spree, Letchinger didn\u2019t just mind his own projects. In 2019, about the time Letchinger was closing on the property that would become One Chicago, he hosted a meeting about Lincoln Yards at his old office.\nHe sat at the table with a group that included Chicago Alderman Brian Hopkins and Sterling Bay\u2019s CEO Andy Gloor.\nLetchinger was there to boost the $6 billion Lincoln Yards campus \u2014 his competitor\u2019s project.\n\u201cIt was compelling, exciting. As a developer you\u2019re envious of someone who can do something so massive in my city,\u201d Letchinger said.\nLetchinger is the kind of businessperson who says yes when he means yes and no when he means no. If he doesn\u2019t want to get drinks with you, he won\u2019t. He golfs with friends, not to network. Though Letchinger can be a lone wolf, he knows the pack \u2014 the institutional players he needs to partner with to get his projects built.\nThis straightforward attitude helps explain the unusual 2019 meeting. At that time, Letchinger was still working to line up the $100 million land purchase for what would become One Chicago. Sterling Bay was going to be a primary fundraiser.\nBoth One Chicago and Lincoln Yards were under the governance of Hopkins, the alderman, and Letchinger thought he could help move along Sterling Bay\u2019s vision for its riverfront land as he pushed forward on One Chicago.\nAdvice often goes ignored, and Letchinger claims he told Sterling Bay to not get into expensive infrastructure commitments that would nail down city subsidies for Lincoln Yards. Sterling did anyway, and the deals proved fatal for its plans.\nIn the process of going to bat for Lincoln Yards, Letchinger also solidified his relationship with Krueger, who had been working extensively with Sterling Bay on successful Chicago developments, notably Google\u2019s Fulton Market headquarters, in the previous few years.\nWanxiang America is an auto parts manufacturer that has brought hundreds of millions in capital to high-profile Chicago real estate projects over the last decade and a half.\nWhen Gloor decided to focus on Lincoln Yards instead of investing in One Chicago, Krueger stepped up for Letchinger. Wanxiang itself would fund JDL\u2019s land purchase, Krueger said, in the call that left Letchinger staring stunned at his wall.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the ultimate partner,\u201d Letchinger said. \u201cLarry Krueger has a special place in my business life.\u201d\nLetchinger paid dearly to maintain the relationship.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got other partners that are not as willing as Jim has been to really kind of do whatever it takes to help his partner get through a difficult time,\u201d Krueger said.\nOne Chicago ended up being completed at the worst possible time for a developer needing to refinance a massive construction loan. The commercial property market had nosedived, and Letchinger had to subordinate his interest in more than $260 million of developer equity to Wanxiang in order to pull off a $415 million refinancing last year. He did so with little hesitation. The refinancing took construction lenders, including Affinius, out of the building\u2019s financial stack.\n\u201cIt was a lot of money, and it was a big bet, but it was a leap of faith,\u201d Letchinger said. \u201cThis was a risky construction project.\u201d\nPerhaps as a result, Wanxiang is still taking swings with JDL. Last year they scored a $160 million construction loan for a 95-unit condo project in Juno Beach, Florida, which is close to wrapping up.\nLetchinger\u2019s relationships aren\u2019t just with the industry. In March, he donated $1,000 to a political organization for Alderman Scott Waguespack, whose district now includes the Foundry Park site.\nOf his political donations, Letchinger said, \u201cI am an equal opportunity check writer, give to everybody,\u201d while noting he had supported Waguespack with another $1,000 back in 2022, \u201clong before I moved on Lincoln Yards.\u201d Illinois records show he has personally contributed over $90,000 to political candidates since 2005, with the biggest amounts going to Hopkins and fellow North Side Alderman Brendan Reilly. Reilly\u2019s campaigns recently collected over $12,000 from Letchinger and another $25,000 from a One Chicago ownership entity while gearing up for a run at longtime Cook County board president incumbent Toni Preckwinkle.\nP\nressing go\nChicago\u2019s megadevelopments don\u2019t have to be stuck in the mud. What rebirthed Lincoln Yards as Foundry Park was a simple decision by Lone Star to move on from Sterling Bay\u2019s vision, and find an exit, even at a painful loss. When there\u2019s a drought of development capital, a moment of repricing can bring opportunity.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy when you have the money,\u201d Letchinger said. \u201cThings can go fast.\u201d\nOn Oct. 24, he purchased an additional 2 acres of vacant land next to Foundry Park from General Iron, which is still looking for a buyer for another 18 adjacent acres \u2014 as it has been since 2022.\nAfter so many years of Sterling Bay planning and negotiating Lincoln Yards, the larger change of ownership happened swiftly \u2014 Letchinger first met with Kayne Anderson in South Florida to propose partnering on the purchase in May of 2025.\nAs summer 2025 gave way to fall, Letchinger found he wasn\u2019t alone. Chicago\u2019s megaproject engine really started revving again.\nWith publicly traded lending partner Blue Owl, developers Related Midwest and CRG\nclosed\non a $75 million land purchase from U.S. Steel for a former South Side metal mill now set to be turned into the multibillion-dollar computing facility. Related, in tandem with a controversial Iraqi-British billionaire and local billionaire Joe Mansueto, also scored a key approval, which will let them build a $650 million soccer stadium for Mansueto\u2019s Chicago Fire FC team at The 78, another long-anticipated site. The 78 is located between the South Loop and Chinatown.\nThe megaprojects could literally reinvent the old Chicago.\nLike the quantum computing site, Letchinger\u2019s Foundry Park is built on a defunct past. Its land once housed the city\u2019s oldest steel factory, which was demolished in 2012. The 78\u2019s development canvas is, similarly, an old railyard property.\nTheir development would chart the next phase of Chicago\u2019s evolution from industrial powerhouse into technological hub, but they\u2019ll have to build quickly for the city to maintain its status as one of the world\u2019s great financial centers.\nP\nicking teams\nAt first, Letchinger\u2019s Foundry Park looked like it would be closer in scale to the planned Lincoln Yards; Letchinger and Kayne made a $60 million offer to buy the southern parcel of the megadevelopment, which Sterling Bay has hung onto with its partner JP Morgan Investment Management.\nBut Sterling Bay wouldn\u2019t budge, even raising the prospect of litigation during JDL\u2019s negotiations for the rest of the site.\n\u201cI told Kayne, \u2018We\u2019re done, let it go,\u2019\u201d Letchinger said. \u201c\u2018I can promise you that the city is going to do what we need to do if we just have the north side. We do not need the south side.\u2019\u201d\nBut Letchinger isn\u2019t afraid of a fight or of being the small guy in a lopsided contest. He played rec basketball well into adulthood, despite a frame safely below six feet \u2014 he says it\u2019s the one thing he misses from being younger.\n\u201cEspecially at my size, it takes a toll on your body. Because I had to play hard. But I loved playing down low,\u201d he said.\nHe still loves the game. But even as a spectator, he can spot an all-star.\nIn April, he was courtside at the United Center for a Bulls post-season game. JDL was already gearing up to make a run at Lincoln Yards; the next month, Letchinger would meet with Kayne to hash out the financing.\nBut that day, just a few seats away, he spotted Keating Crown, Sterling Bay\u2019s managing principal and main financial backer, and great-grandson of one of the city\u2019s core industrialists, Henry Crown.\nThe Bulls lost the play-in that day, and Letchinger didn\u2019t approach Crown; although they\u2019ve had a congratulatory phone call since JDL and Kayne took over the north side of Lincoln Yards. Letchinger said Gloor has been less friendly.\nBut victory isn\u2019t unimaginable.\nWhile Letchinger isn\u2019t set on acquiring the southern side of the project anymore, he\u2019s open to considering another offer if it comes back to the market.\nHe envisions building a school on part of that land as an enhancement for Foundry Park. Perhaps he\u2019d develop some more housing, he thinks, though less dense than the plans for across the river.\nFor now, Sterling Bay is the southern parcel\u2019s steward.\n\u201cIf we do something on the south side, at this point it\u2019s going to be, candidly, with their blessing and knowledge,\u201d Letchinger said. \u201cNot because I\u2019m worried about litigation. There is none. It\u2019s just not necessary. I never intended to have an issue with them.\u201d",

        "content": "By September, it seemed like things couldn\u2019t possibly get worse at 7500 South South Drive.\nA little-known real estate investor from Wisconsin named\nTrinity Flood\nbought the Chicago apartment building in 2020. As an out-of-state-investor, it\u2019s not clear how much she knew about South Shore, the building\u2019s neighborhood, which skirts Lake Michigan and extends west to I-90. Transportation access, unique 1920s apartment buildings, side streets lined with single-family homes and the forthcoming Obama Presidential Library all\nlend\nto South Shore\u2019s\nappeal\n.\nBut it\u2019s farther south than buzzier South Side neighborhoods like Bronzeville and Hyde Park and the neighborhood still struggles with the remnants of decades of redlining and disinvestment. As of October, South Shore had the highest number of homicides in the city over the past 12 months, according to neighborhood-level data compiled by a local ABC affiliate. Both Hyde Park and Kenwood, immediately north of the neighborhood, have had zero homicides in the past year. To successfully invest in Chicago, in other words,\nlandlords\nneed to know neighborhood and even block-level nuances.\nAt 7500 South Shore, it soon became apparent that Flood was not prepared.\nSince 2020, the property\u2019s conditions have deteriorated significantly. Elevators are broken, sewage gases are leaking through the building and the city\u2019s legal department recently documented \u201carmed occupants along with alleged criminal activity and shootings at the property.\u201d\nWells Fargo, on behalf of CMBS bond holders, filed a $27 million foreclosure lawsuit in April for delinquent payments on a loan backed by the South Side property as well as several others in Chicago, Georgia and Arizona.\nRather than quietly admitting defeat and handing her keys back to the lender, Flood responded by clinging to the properties via extensive litigation. Recent filings hone in on Flood\u2019s inability to find an insurer for the building and struggling with the costs of a lender-placed policy.\nNow, her attempts to hang onto control of the apartments as long as possible have snowballed into a worst-case scenario few could have imagined five years ago.\nOn the night of Sept. 30, hundreds of federal agents raided Flood\u2019s South Shore Drive building in an event that yielded national attention.\nVideos taken by neighbors show agents descending on the five-story brick building in helicopters, while trucks and the inconspicuous vehicles favored by Immigration and Customs Enforcement ferry in hundreds of others. ICE Chief Gregory Bovino charged in, tailed by a News Nation camera crew invited to follow the operation. Many tenants were reportedly detained outside for hours, before being released back into the building.\nThe operation, a combined undertaking of the FBI, ATF and Customs and Border Protection, yielded 37 arrests. Some arrested were \u201cbelieved to be involved in drug trafficking and distribution, weapons crimes, and immigration violators,\u201d according to The Department of Homeland Security.\n\u201cThis raid was really unlike anything that I have witnessed, either as a lawyer or as a law professor,\u201d Hugh Mundy, a law professor at The University of Illinois Chicago who specializes in criminal procedure, said.\nMaking the building\u2019s downfall even more stunning, 7500 South Shore had undergone a multimillion-dollar renovation shortly before Flood purchased it and was, according to brokers, nearly 100 percent occupied at the time.\nThough most multifamily purchases won\u2019t end up this poorly maintained or the\ntarget of a federal raid\n, 7500 South Shore\u2019s undoing still serves as a cautionary tale of how neglect can lead to financial distress, especially when a property ends up in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump\u2019s ramp-up of federal policing powers.\nIn that sense, Flood\u2019s property is far from the only one facing precarious circumstances. As of October, lenders in the U.S. have already 50 percent more multifamily foreclosures than they did in all of 2020, according to data from ATTOM Real Estate Solutions.\nB\nuyer beware\nIn January 2018, New York-based Dax Real estate paid just under $11.5 million for three complexes with 208 combined units at 7500 South South Shore Drive, 6916 South Clyde Avenue and 7038 South Chappel Avenue, according to Cook County property records.\nThe South Shore Drive property was \u201cvery rundown and substantially vacant,\u201d managing partner Daniel Hedaya told The Real Deal in 2019. DAX spent several million dollars on renovations to the building, he said.\nIn the spring of 2019, DAX went to sell the properties for $20 million, marketing the area as \u201cone of the most appreciating pockets of the South Side,\u201d according to Aaron Sklar, one of the Kiser Group brokers who had the listing. Flood closed in early 2020, paying 60 percent more than DAX had spent two years earlier.\nBut she was unsatisfied with her purchase.\nShortly after buying the apartments, Flood filed a lawsuit alleging Hedaya and his brokers, Sklar and Noah Birk of Kiser, had improperly inflated the properties\u2019 values.\nSquatters began to take up residence in the building, and city inspectors reported that the property manager was no longer able to \u201cre-assert control over the building.\u201d\nThe building needed around-the-clock, on-site security that cost $15,000 monthly, she said. The seller had not made her aware of the security requirements, and its brokers prevented her from touring more than two of the 130 units in the complex because the building was almost entirely occupied.\nBut in a legal response, Hedaya\u2019s attorney noted that Flood had assigned an intermediary to review details of the purchase and wanted to close quickly because she was trying to execute a 1031 exchange.\n\u201c[Flood] seek[s] only to complain about the outcome of [her] own actions \u2014 committing to a deal before undertaking the expansive due diligence to which they were entitled,\u201d the response reads.\nThe parties reached a confidential settlement in October 2023, but by then Flood was racking up significant city code violations on at least two of her three Chicago buildings. Sklar and Birk declined to comment.\nIn August 2021, about a year and a half after Flood purchased the portfolio, a fire broke out at her Clyde Avenue property, one of the other South Side buildings in her portfolio. The blaze injured four tenants and a firefighter. The city began monitoring it for code violations, and inspectors also tracked similar problems at 7500 South Shore.\nSince then, the buildings racked up dozens of code violations, most associated with the South Shore Drive building.\nThe slow deterioration soon accelerated.\nIn 2022, under a rental assistance program established by the state of Illinois, some migrants moved into the property, though it\u2019s unclear how many. Tenants generally didn\u2019t report concerns with them besides an increase in trash in the hallways, according to Jordan Karsh, an organizer with the Metropolitan Tenants Organization who had helped form a tenants union at the building in 2024.\nThe turning point, Karsh said, was when a new property manager, Strength in Management, took over in early 2024. Soon after, Flood stopped providing security services, and maintenance issues went unaddressed.\nFlood and Strength in Management did not respond to requests for comment.\nSquatters began to take up residence in the building, and city inspectors reported that the property manager was no longer able to \u201cre-assert control over the building.\u201d\nFlood attempted to sell the portfolio around the same time but never closed a deal.\nIn a code violation case still pending in court, city officials this summer requested that a judge appoint a limited receiver to the property. Wells Fargo also requested that a judge issue a receiver to the property as part of its foreclosure proceedings which kicked off in April.\nOn Sept. 30, just one day before a judge was scheduled to hear Wells Fargo\u2019s argument for receivership, federal agents swarmed in for the raid.\nThere is some speculation that Flood or Corey Oliver, who owns Strength in Management, tipped off federal agents about the presence of migrants and illegal activity in the building. Agents carried out the raid with the consent of the owner, according to the New York Times.\nA map found at the property shortly after the raid and photographed by a Chicago Sun Times reporter included labels for units with migrants and squatters.\n\u201cWhoever tipped off ICE about that level of detail about who\u2019s in what unit in the building has to have had knowledge of that,\u201d Karsh said. \u201cThe most obvious answer to that would be Strength in Management or Trinity Flood.\u201d\nCity officials, who were also familiar with conditions at the property, denied any collaboration with federal authorities ahead of the raid.\nFor Flood, the aftermath of the raid plunged the reputation of her South Shore Drive property to a new low \u2014 but it also meant she had evaded receivership for just a bit longer.\nE\nxpect the unexpected\nNot long after Flood bought the South Shore Drive building in early 2020, interest rates took a historic plunge, spurring a boom of investment and new development in many U.S. cities.\nBut when rates rose again soon after, buyers who made risky purchases in 2020 and 2022 found themselves in a losing battle. Inexperienced investors and syndicators have gotten hit with foreclosure filings, and mortgage fraud that took place during the frothy period has begun to threaten the stability of some regional banks.\nSince the beginning of the year, lenders have filed 11,300 multifamily foreclosure complaints, compared to 7,500 in all of 2020, ATTOM found.\nWhether problems at other struggling properties across the U.S. would make federal raids a serious risk is unclear, especially since the massive operation on South Shore Drive defied long-established norms of search and seizure, legal experts said.\nLenders in the U.S. had 50 percent more multifamily foreclosures in the first nine months of 2025 as they did in all of 2020.\nSource: ATTOM Real Estate Solutions\n\u201cYou would normally expect that kind of force to result in more arrests for more serious crimes,\u201d Mundy, the law professor, said, calling the scale of the raid more fitting for a racketeering investigation.\nHe added that a warrant typically targets specific units rather than an entire building. TRD requested copies of warrants and arrest records from the federal agencies involved in the raid but has not gotten a response.\nEven before the raid, federal agents were challenging conventions of immigration enforcement across the city.\nA U.S. district judge in Chicago recently ruled that federal immigration agents illegally arrested 26 people in Chicago without warrants in January, violating a consent decree that dictates how such arrests can be carried out.\nLandlord groups like the National Apartment Association have put together guidance on how to respond to subpoenas and raids. Property managers are not required to allow ICE agents to enter a building, they advise, unless they have a criminal warrant signed by a judge. Owners can consult with attorneys before responding to a subpoena for information about tenants.\nOnce law enforcement agencies enter a property, however, landlords have little influence over how a raid is conducted.\n\u201cThe bottom line is, there is not much a landlord can do as it relates to police conduct within their building, whether in a common area or a tenant\u2019s apartment,\u201d Monu Bedi, a DePaul University College of Law Professor who specializes in criminal procedure and military law, said. \u201cIf there is damage to the building, landlords are able to recover money for the property but that is different than their rights to prevent officers from entering.\u201d\nT\nhe fallout\nWhen the dust settled in the weeks after the raid, just 35 paying tenants were left living in the 130-unit building, along with about 10 squatters, Oliver, the property manager, told Cook County Circuit Court Judge Debra Seaton Oct. 17.\nKarsh estimates that a majority would like to move out if given financial assistance.\nThe building remains on insecure footing, both in terms of safety and finances.\nInspectors tasked with evaluating electrical systems at the building were alarmed by faulty wiring leading out to the city\u2019s utility poles, noting that lines hang low enough for a live wire to hit the top of a garbage truck, they said at a recent hearing.\nThey also pointed to fire hazards caused by extension cords and hijacked meters in the building, likely used to provide power to squatters\u2019 units. Only one of the building\u2019s elevators is operating \u2014 still. A plumbing inspector noted that the boiler room had a strong odor that could be attributed to a gas leak and stated that raw sewage and sewer gases were leaking into the building.\nBut Oliver said that since the raid, Flood had invested $100,000 into repairs to the building, including plumbing and electrical repairs. He also said he was told he needed to re-submit a permit for some of the electrical work that needed to be done at the property.\nThree armed security guards are another new addition. They now patrol the building from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. every night.\nOliver asked Judge Debra Seaton what he should tell Flood if the recommended repairs are more costly than she expects. Flood never appeared at the hearing, her attorney attending on her behalf.\n\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be an issue if she wants to keep this out of a receivership,\u201d Seaton said. \u201cYour owner could have been present for his hearing today and she is represented by legal counsel.\u201d\nSeaton said she will not appoint a receiver until she can evaluate the progress of the work at the property. If the immediate dangers are not resolved quickly, she said she will not only consider appointing a receiver but will also weigh issuing a court order for all the remaining tenants to relocate, likely with relocation assistance.\nThings might not turn around so easily, Alderman Greg Mitchell, who represents the area, believes. That worries him.\n\u201cMy current concern is that I still don\u2019t feel the building is safe,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Another Houston\nmultifamily operator\nis falling on hard times.\nJuly Residential Group, which is based in New York, could be forced to hand over the keys to 1,300 multifamily units at this month\u2019s foreclosure auction. July Residential bought the properties in 2021.\nThis month will bring $590 million in loans to the auction block across the Texas Triangle, up from\n$575 million in October\n, but down from\n$710 million in September\nand\n$670 million in August\n, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service.\nHarris County, home to Houston, was once again the hardest hit, with five loans topping $200 million in debt facing foreclosure.\nHere are the biggest loans up for auction this month. It\u2019s possible that some of these borrowers and lenders will reach agreements to avoid auction.\nHouston\nJuly Residential allegedly defaulted on an $81.5 million mortgage from Voya backed by five properties:\nCasa Grande Apartments, a 268-unit complex at 9445 Concourse Drive;\nShadowtree Apartments, a 428-unit complex at 9475 West Sam Houston Parkway;\nAirport Crossing Apartments, a 178-unit complex at 8300 West Airport Boulevard;\nTownhome Apartments, a 73-unit complex at 8030 West Airport Boulevard; and\nPlaza at Hobby Airport Apartments, a 328-unit complex at 8501 Broadway Street.\nThe properties were constructed between 1976 and 1983. The loan works out to $63,921 per unit.\nAustin\nLangdon Street Capital is facing foreclosure on Langdon at Walnut Park after the loan tied to the property\nheaded to special servicing in September\n. The foreclosure appears to be fallout from the recent passage of House Bill 21, which requires operators that used a property tax credit loophole to come into compliance with new requirements in order to maintain their exemptions. Langdon Street Capital borrowed $60 million from Argentic for the property at 12101 North Lamar last year. Debt on the 277-unit property, built in 2018, works out to $216,606 per unit.\nSan Antonio\nLakewood, New Jersey-based Raven Capital Group could lose Vive Apartments in San Antonio. The owner took out a $23.8 million mortgage on the 280-unit apartment complex at 9400 Fredericksburg Road in 2021. The debt on the property, built in 1974, works out to $85,000 per unit.\nDallas\nHarwood International is facing its\nthird foreclosure this year\nand could lose Harwood No. 1 at this month\u2019s foreclosure auction. Gabriel Barbier-Mueller\u2019s firm took out a $37.4 million mortgage from First United to refinance the 105,550-square-foot property at 2651 North Harwood Street in 2020. It works out to $354 per square foot for the office building built in 1984.\nFort Worth\nThe biggest new loan headed to auction in Tarrant County this month is a $6.8 million mortgage tied to Regency Apartments. Utah-based Harris Investment Group took out the loan in 2022. The 72-unit property at 2507 Airport Circle was built in 1967. The debt works out to $93,750 per unit.\nRepeat offenders\nOf the nine properties facing foreclosure in Houston\u2019s Harris County, two are regulars. Both properties owned by Rao Polavarapu\u2019s Falls Apartment, which had a loan head to special servicing in August, received multiple foreclosure notices but haven\u2019t been sold yet.\nFalls of Braeburn, a 191-unit complex at 9707 Braeburn Glen ($64.5 million); and\nFalls of Westpark, a 356-unit complex at 6130 Southwest ($29 million).\nTwo properties in Bexar County are headed to the block again:\nA retail building at 6610 Low Bid Lane home to Soccer Central ($10.5 million); and\nA retail building at 22615 North U.S. Highway 281 home to Dutch Bros. ($7.4 million).\nPlus two in Dallas:\nA retail building at 8505 Walton Boulevard ($6.8 million); and\nA plot of land at 2225 Guthrie Road ($4.8 million).\nTravis County will see one repeat customer at the auction block this month:\nGalleria Oaks Building 2, an 18,000-square-foot retail strip at 13376 North U.S. Highway 183 ($16 million).\nAs will Tarrant County:\nArioso Apartments &amp; Townhomes, a 288-unit complex at 3030 Claremont Drive ($56 million).\n",

        "content": "How else could these three characters have ended up in one room except as part of a social media stunt to sell a hacienda in the Texas Hill Country? There was Kai Cenat, the most popular entertainer on streaming platform Twitch; Tony Parker, French-American MVP of the legendary 2000s-era\nSan Antonio Spurs\nlineup; and Erwin Nicholas II, better known as Mr. Real Estate.\nParker owned the location, an estate at\n9 Rue Parker in Boerne\nwhich he wanted to offload. A Kuper Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent tried unsuccessfully to move the home the traditional way, but Parker took it off the market after failing to get a $19.5 million ask. Parker then hired Nicholas, a Houston real estate player who works with sports stars and celebrities, to market the 53-acre property, set amid Boerne\u2019s coveted scenery and access to dark skies, wineries and biergartens, German architecture and exotic hunting ranches. Nicholas heard that Cenat, who\u2019s in a collective of streamers and influencers called AMP Squad, was looking for a place to host a \u201csubathon\u201d \u2014 a livestream that would go 12 hours a day, 30 days in a row. Feeling that Parker had exhausted his options on the local Multiple Listing Service, Nicholas thought Cenat could market the home and its amenities to AMP Squad\u2019s 19 million followers.\n\u201cEssentially, it\u2019s a really big open house,\u201d Nicholas said.\nHeralded by a teaser video featuring T-Pain, Cenat and his gang moved in. The performers racked up tens of millions of views. On a July day near the end of the subathon, they held a pool party. Hip-hop throbbed from the subwoofers as Cenat strode out of the mansion, weaving through hundreds of friends, fellow internet celebrities, fans on pilgrimage and locals who mobbed the Romanesque courtyard, their liquor bottles scattered on benches, plinths and flowerbeds.\nThe camera caught aspects of the property consistent with the \u201cunparalleled privacy, uncompromising security and refined luxury\u201d in the listing, like the lagoon, the waterpark (the largest residential one in the U.S.) and the Spanish architecture. It captured others that probably wouldn\u2019t have been publicized: the livestreamers\u2019 portable toilets, food trucks, dunking booth, buffet line, impromptu boxing ring and chatter.\n\u201cThis is hot and boring. This is the boonies. You gotta come to the city,\u201d a woman in a bikini yelled. Kai nodded, and the woman\u2019s friend tried to pull her away: \u201cYou heard of the Alamo and shit like that?\u201d\nNicholas was an unlikely producer for this scene. Unlike Cenat, Mr. Real Estate is \u2014 was \u2014 largely unknown. As a Houston investor and broker specializing in working with athletes and entertainers on their real estate purchases, he\u2019s operated until now with no advertising, no team and often no MLS, focusing mostly on off-market trades.\n\u201cMost athletes have an assistant, obviously an agent, or a financial adviser. These are the people that actually make the decisions.\u201d\nErwin Nicholas II\nHis lone-wolf approach cost him access to the broader market, but he says it\u2019s gained him entry into the opaque world of selling homes for the suddenly super-rich, often in private. It\u2019s not clear how many luxury homes are sold off-market, but non-disclosure laws and high property taxes make Central Texas a national\nhotspot\nfor such trades, according to local agents. The story of Nicholas\u2019 rise sheds light on this world, especially the ultra-private transactions of celebrity athletes, where real-life connections to the \u00e9minences grises behind them are the highest form of currency.\nWhile some agents make a business out of Instagram, Nicholas has publicized almost none of his deals. It\u2019s not that secrecy is key, in his opinion; it\u2019s that publicity isn\u2019t profitable. Clicks and SEO are only currency to agents who find clients online.\nBut it\u2019s hard to avoid the public square. As the Sun Belt residential market flags, even at the luxury end, Mr. Real Estate is making use of his clients\u2019 fame for the first time to source and close deals. Still, Twitch streaming could be a long shot as a strategy for selling a mansion in Boerne, and he\u2019s still waiting to see if he\u2019ll sink it. If he can sell Parker\u2019s home after Cenat\u2019s residency, that could settle the score \u2014 and maybe help the chances of one of America\u2019s most expensive listings,\na $195 million Beverly Hills\nestate that he recently signed on to sell.\nT\nhe draft\nAs a college student studying biology on a merit scholarship in the 2000s, Nicholas nursed an entrepreneurial ambition. Nicholas was drawn to star athletes and celebrities from the start; he recognized a gap in the market in Houston for agents that served celebrities, as compared to glamour-saturated California and New York. He trawled nightclubs after class as a junior, hoping to gin up real estate business and get mentioned in the society blogs to build some name recognition. This didn\u2019t work out exactly how he had hoped: An NBA player he\u2019d been scouting forgot his name and addressed him as Mr. Real Estate. The name stuck.\nHe mapped out players\u2019 favorite haunts. Over cocktails and under strobe lights, Nicholas slipped his business card to Astros, Rockets and Texans.\nHis connections eventually brought him his first marquee deal: a leasing gig for Adrian Peterson, the East Texas native and record-setting NFL running back. As fate, or style, would have it, Nicholas called around and found Peterson a house that once belonged to fellow Houston football legend Warren Moon.\n\u201cI was able to secure his house, and that established my credibility in the athlete world,\u201d Nicholas said.\nMultiple high-profile Houston athletes followed: NFL cornerback Xavien Howard, Astros fielder Michael Bourn, NBA star DeAndre Jordan and No. 1 shooting guard Jalen Green among them. He took Drake around town and showed homes to comedian Gary Owens.\nThe initiation was twofold. As Houston\u2019s glitterati recognized Nicholas as a member of the court, their managers, agents and advisers recognized the young entrepreneur offered more than just flash.\nT\nhe drive\nIn the high-touch Texas luxury sphere, it\u2019s almost more important to connect with the entourage than with potential clients themselves. Millionaires in their twenties tend to delegate real estate decisions to risk-averse gatekeepers who prefer to work with people they already trust.\n\u201cMost athletes have an assistant, obviously an agent, or a financial adviser. These are the people that actually make the decisions,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cI ended up just networking with advisers, seeing who\u2019s working with who.\u201d\nNicholas shares a client with Jacob Wilson, a former Wells Fargo executive who\u2019s now a financial adviser to some members of the Dallas Cowboys and a few entertainment celebrities. The two are cut from similar cloth. Wilson\u2019s firm, Riley, Darby and Wilson Private Wealth Management, doesn\u2019t even have a website. Like Nicholas, Wilson gets clients almost solely through referrals. He won\u2019t say which of them works with Nicholas, nor does he elaborate much on how they got to know each other, except to cite \u201ca mutual friend.\u201d\nWilson does say he vetted Nicholas thoroughly before he referred him.\nThe peculiar challenge of representing athletes, Wilson notes, is that they frequently move. Additionally, they can\u2019t be sure of how long they\u2019ll stay in the game.\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare to find a professional athlete that\u2019s, for example, like Dak [Prescott], that\u2019s stayed here for, what, 10 years? Awesome for him, that\u2019s fantastic. But that\u2019s not all athletes,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cHow much home can they afford? They see all this new money; is the money going to be there forever? What\u2019s prudent?\u201d\nIt\u2019s easy to find examples of carelessness: Vin Baker, the former NBA All-Star who ended up managing a Starbucks, or Randy Brown, who had to auction off the championship rings he earned alongside Michael Jordan after declaring bankruptcy.\n\u201cWith the athletes and entertainers, specifically athletes, a lot of their money is made on the front end,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThe first thing that you have to think through with somebody that suddenly comes into money is, you just want to protect it, because it may not happen again. This could be a one-time thing.\u201d\nBy 2010, one of Nicholas\u2019 networking leads brought him to a bowling alley where Texans tackle Frank Okam liked to play on Wednesdays. Team members and other athletes often joined him, including an NBA rookie named Patrick Patterson, freshly drafted by the Rockets. Up to that point in his life, the young Patterson had relied on a savvy school friend to essentially serve as his manager, handling some fiscal decisions and helping Patterson stay organized. After the friend moved back home to pursue a career as a wealth adviser, Nicholas filled in.\n\u201c[Patterson] basically asked me to be a part of his team. He kept calling me \u2014 \u2018What is this?\u2019 \u2018Where is that?\u2019 I was like, \u2018You need help?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yeah,\u2019\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cI was damn near his roommate.\u201d\nHe managed Patterson\u2019s affairs for several years while also networking with other gatekeepers and learning concretely what athletes and their advisers need. Once Patterson moved on to a new team, Nicholas was ready to pivot to real estate full time.\nT\nhe deep three\nTo hear Nicholas describe it, joining a brokerage or team is a sort of Faustian bargain, a trade of long-term freedom for immediate gain. He\u2019s never split a commission.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no clients there,\u201d he says simply. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not productive for me if I\u2019m out here really networking and building relationships. \u2026 I\u2019m not trying to be the president of nobody.\u201d\nHolding things close to one\u2019s chest has its benefits. To clients like Will and LeBrina Jackson \u2014 a retired NFL cornerback and reality television star, respectively \u2014 Nicholas\u2019 straightforwardness, privacy and hyper-local experience made him the best choice. Will\u2019s agent referred the couple to Nicholas, and he sold them their current home, an equestrian estate just west of Houston.\n\u201cHonesty and the ability to educate a client without all the fluff, without all the BS\u201d \u2014 those were Nicholas\u2019 winning traits, LeBrina said.\nA sports agent\u2019s trust is hard-won, and it lasts, according to Wilson. The task of guarding a twenty-something athlete\u2019s volatile wealth requires gatekeepers to consider a lifetime of home purchases, not just the next one.\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a good real estate professional, you\u2019re talking to this person all the time. They shouldn\u2019t be just advising on this specific transaction. They should be a consultant to your real estate portfolio or needs for many, many years,\u201d Wilson said.\nBut while Nicholas has found a deeply loyal clientele in a wealthy niche, he\u2019s also forsworn the resources and branding of firms like Compass and Sotheby\u2019s, not to mention the exposure of the internet. Over his 20-year career, Nicholas has completed $375 million in sales volume. The top luxury agent in Houston, Compass\u2019 Laura Sweeney \u2014 who, it should be noted, has had a longer career \u2014 completes about $150 million each year.\nThen again, Wilson says, if you\u2019re not one of the few real estate agents a financial adviser has learned to personally trust, you\u2019re not going to get his client\u2019s listing \u2014 no matter what logo might be on your business card.\nStill, Nicholas is continuing his adventure in publicity. When the Jacksons listed the farm at 20431 Old Windmill Trail in August, hoping to move to a farm with more space for their horses, it became Nicholas\u2019 second publicized listing, appearing in Jennifer Gould\u2019s Gimme Shelter column at the New York Post.\nBut it\u2019s unclear whether the modern online leads will move the homes. Whatever a broker\u2019s strategy, homes are selling more slowly, and the general market has flipped to buyers in many metros, including Austin, once the trendiest city in the Lone Star State, and Houston, one of the top five biggest metros in America to see annual price depreciation.\nAt the moment, Parker\u2019s hacienda in Boerne is still on the market, though some buyers have expressed interest.\nCenat, meanwhile, has been hard at work in Beverly Hills. AMP Squad just finished another subathon at the Palazzo di Amore, the Beverly Hills compound owned by tycoon Jeff Greene, another seller dissatisfied with the uncreative efforts of previous agents, who enlisted Nicholas to sell his $195 million property. At one time, it was the most expensive public listing in the country.\nAttention isn\u2019t the only new thing for Nicholas, who plans to keep the same asking price when it hits the market. He is also co-listing with another agent, Patrick Michael of LA Estate Brokerage. During the subathon, Kim Kardashian and Miley Cyrus swung by. LeBron James gave Cenat a haircut on camera. And Nicholas\u2019 long shot is hanging in midair.\n\u201cIf you have the best house that offers something that you want the world to see, why not?\u201d Nicholas said.",

        "content": "If reality is usually worse than the fantasy, in downtown Dallas, the real thing is actually better. Up in the suburbs, they are sure downtown\u2019s streets are dangerous and dirty, yet when developer Tanya Ragan tours out-of-state investors around, they sing a different song: it\u2019s much cleaner than their central business districts back home, they tell her.\n\u201cI live in two worlds,\u201d said Ragan, one of downtown\u2019s loudest cheerleaders.\nBut as\ntenants like AT&amp;T\nlook to relocate to the white-hot DFW suburbs, the potential of downtown\u2019s downfall stands to block a revival \u2014 whatever the truth.\nThe telecoms giant has been scouting a new office in Plano or Richardson since the summer, threatening to vacate its 1 million-square-foot downtown footprint, which represents 4 percent of all office space in the submarket.\nOf course, AT&amp;T isn\u2019t the first to eye a switch. Tenants have been leaving for\nUptown and the suburbs\nfor the better part of two decades. AT&amp;T\u2019s potential departure comes as Dallas\u2019 NBA and NHL teams run up against their leases at American Airlines Center. (The arena isn\u2019t technically downtown; it\u2019s across Woodall Rodgers Freeway in Victory Park, but it\u2019s a lot closer than rumored new destinations like Plano, Irving and Arlington.)\nDowntown has plenty of local boosters pushing to renovate office buildings or convert them to residential, and the revamped convention center set to debut in 2029 is already booked. There\u2019s funding. Still, momentum is lacking. In the story of flight-to-quality in the office market, downtown Dallas is the origin city, not the destination.\nTo be sure, maintaining the perception that downtown is undesirable may benefit suburban office owners and tenant rep brokers, who stand to gain when downtown tenants head elsewhere, according to Pacific Elm Properties\u2019 Jonas Woods and Billy Prewitt.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a serious financial incentive to push tenants to more expensive buildings,\u201d Woods said.\nSomewhere between the vocal critics and cheerleaders lies the real story of the urban core, where political leadership tends to get in its own way and investors waiver on the material odds for a comeback built from the rubble of its office market collapse.\n\n \n\n   \n\n   \n  \n\n  \nLeaflet map created by Adam Farence\n\nD\nowntown\u2019s problem\nEveryone\u2019s in at least one Facebook group that traffics in nostalgia with grainy, washed-out photos of a city\u2019s downtown in a heyday that didn\u2019t last that long.\nOld photos of Dallas show a town on the come-up in the mid-1970s: busy downtown streets, now-vintage neon lights advertising iconic spots like The Adolphus Hotel. Reunion Tower \u2014 the landmark topped with a three-story observation ball \u2014 was completed in 1978, the same year the I. M. Pei-designed City Hall would open. The skyscrapers that define the city\u2019s skyline went up to house the burgeoning financial services industry.\nThe savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s hit the rising financial center hard. By the late \u201990s, downtown Dallas was famously home to fewer than 500 people. The pandemic also ravaged the city center, emptying office buildings and driving up violent crime.\nThe perception of downtown as unsafe belies the fact that violent crime is on a downward swing; it dropped nearly 20 percent between 2024 and 2025. Violations related to homelessness, like sleeping in public and solicitation have decreased almost 35 percent in the same time frame, data from the Dallas Police Department shows.\nStill, there has been violence. Two shooting deaths on Dallas Area Rapid Transit trains within six days of each other this fall renewed pressure for public safety measures. Longtime downtown tenants cite security as the primary reason to relocate.\nT\nhe relocation game\nIn 2012, Klyde Warren Park paved the way for an office exodus. The 5-acre deck park covers Woodall Rogers Freeway, connecting downtown to Uptown.\nKelcy Warren, the son of the park\u2019s billionaire namesake, donated $10 million to the development project. In addition to private donations, the project was funded with $20 million in bond proceeds, $20 million from the federal government through TxDOT and $16.7 million in federal stimulus funds.\nIn a city short on natural resources, the park is an active outdoor space with community events almost daily. At lunchtime on weekdays, suits pour out of office buildings on Woodall Rodgers Freeway to grab lunch at the food trucks lining the edges of the park.\nAccounting firm Pricewaterhouse-Coopers ditched its 144,000-square-foot downtown footprint at Trammell Crow Center in 2017 for Park District. Invesco and a brigade of law firms followed suit, landing in flashy trophy office buildings on Field Street and McKinney Avenue.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to use the word \u2018revitalization\u2019 because I feel like we\u2019re past that.\u201d\nTanya Ragan\nThe exodus to Uptown will reach a fever pitch when Goldman Sachs and Bank of America depart for their built-to-suit trophy towers on\nY\u2019all Street\n.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 move to the 800,000-square-foot campus at Hunt Realty\u2019s upcoming development NorthEnd will leave a 175,000-square-foot swath of empty office space at Trammell Crow Center. The 1.2 million-square-foot skyscraper at 2001 Ross Avenue will be half-empty before 2030.\nBank of America is ditching its namesake downtown tower for Parkside Uptown, the 500,000-square-foot project being developed by Pacific Elm and KDC.\nThat\u2019s without adding in the firms heading to a different municipality, like Plano, Frisco or Richardson. It can be lucrative to play the corporate relocation game outside the city, Partners Real Estate\u2019s Steve Triolet said, as the popular northern suburbs are known to lavish incentives on companies that sign leases in their domains.\nThe trend has saddled downtown with a mountain of empty office space. Of Dallas-Fort Worth\u2019s approximate 172 million square feet of office space, downtown Dallas accounts for almost 7 percent, according to data from Partners. The overall market has a vacancy rate of 25 percent; in the central business district, it\u2019s 33 percent.\n\u201cThose downtown buildings are kind of Swiss cheese,\u201d Triolet said, rattling off a list of the imperiled properties: Harwood Center, Bank of America Plaza, Fountain Place, Trammell Crow Center, Chase Tower, Ross Tower and St. Paul Place.\nT\nhe conversion conversation\nWhat to do with downtown\u2019s core glut of outdated office space? Downtown\u2019s most ardent champions swear by adaptive reuse.\nShawn Todd\u2019s Todd Interests turned the 50-story First National Bank Tower built in 1965 at 1401 Elm Street into The National, a mixed-use tower with a luxury hotel, 324 multifamily units, 37,000 square feet of office space and 43,000 square feet of retail. The firm also revamped Energy Plaza, at 405 North Ervay Street, into The Sinclair.\nPacific Elm\u2019s Woods and Prewitt bought Thanksgiving Tower in 2013 and have been fixing it up ever since. Now known as Santander Tower, the 50-story former office building at 1601 Elm Street is home to a hotel, 228 multifamily units and 756,000 square feet of office space. The office space is currently 85 percent leased, Woods said. Pacific Elm is about to start construction on the conversion of Bryan Tower.\nThe redevelopment of The National and Santander Tower, which are about a block from each other, has activated a stretch of Elm Street with ground-floor food and beverage concepts.\nWoods believes adaptive reuse is the key, \u201cthe most productive thing we could do to dramatically change the existing dynamics\u201d of downtown Dallas, he said.\nDevelopers have been revamping office buildings in the urban core for decades, Prewitt said. But the current stock \u2014 albatrosses constructed in the \u201980s \u2014 makes this cycle particularly challenging.\nThe government could help ease the process, Triolet said. The Texas Legislature, in its most recent session, passed Senate Bills 2477 and 840; both aim to streamline the conversion process.\nStill, the cost-intensive nature of a residential conversion makes these deals hard to pencil, even with incentives from the city.\nAt the moment, all eyes are on Mike Hoque and Mike Ablon. The heads of Hoque Global and Pegasus Ablon have teamed up to take a $409 million swing at rehabbing Dallas\u2019 tallest building, Bank of America Tower. The pair secured a $103 million incentives package to convert part of the 72-story skyscraper at 901 Main Street into a hotel.\nDowntown stakeholders are eager to see the project succeed, but Hoque\u2019s redevelopment dreams are still mostly unproven. Project delays have led to skirmishes between his firm and the cities of Dallas, Fort Worth and Mansfield.\nS\necond-wave revitalization\nTanya Ragan earned the title of Downtown Dallas champion when she spruced up the Dallas Farmers Market a decade ago, breathing new life into the eastern edge of downtown. Her coalition, which included Dallas-based Spectrum Properties, turned four neglected sheds sitting on 17 underused acres into an open-air pavilion, a food hall, retail and multifamily.\nToday, a couple thousand people, including Ragan, call the neighborhood home. It\u2019s vibrant and walkable, with a slate of neighborhood restaurants. It also serves to connect downtown to nearby Deep Ellum.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to use the word \u2018revitalization\u2019 because I feel like we\u2019re past that,\u201d she said.\nAnother wave of investment is on the way, this time on the southern and western edges of downtown. Stakeholders believe it\u2019ll be game-changing for the urban core as well as under-developed southern Dallas.\nThe city of Dallas, whose city manager didn\u2019t respond to requests for an interview, has 75 conventions already booked for its new convention center set to be delivered in 2029. The $3.7 billion project will overhaul Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center so that it features 750,000 square feet of exhibit space, 180,000 square feet of meeting rooms and a 105,000-square-foot ballroom. Dallas-based developer Matthews is doing the project.\nThe project is breeding optimism.\n\u201cI\u2019m just hoping that people hang on and weather the storm,\u201d Craig Davis, president and CEO of VisitDallas, said.\nJust a few blocks north, Hunt Realty is pursuing a $5 billion project to redevelop downtown\u2019s quintessential Reunion Tower. The project could include up to 3,000 multifamily units, a 600- to 1,000-key hotel, 150,000 square feet of retail and up to 2 million square feet of office.\nBehind City Hall, Mike Hoque has also been assembling a 20-acre swath of land for a development he\u2019s calling Newpark, a mixed-use hub with an education and technology focus, according to plans.\nBut the ghosts of aborted and stalled projects haunt the road to downtown Dallas, and attempts to revitalize haven\u2019t always turned out. The Spire, a mixed-use district, was supposed to bloom on 11 acres at the corner of Ross Avenue and Routh Street but never did. Field Street District, another development planned for south of Woodall Rodgers Freeway, didn\u2019t get built\u00a0 yet either.\nW\nhere\u2019s Waldo?\nIn the story of downtown\u2019s troubles, the city\u2019s political leadership usually gets cast as villains.\nSome of it is earned. The closure announcement of the flagship Neiman Marcus store, like the threat of AT&amp;T leaving, seemed to have Dallas political leadership making decisions out of desperation. The city can mobilize, as it did with a series of press conferences putting pressure on Neiman Marcus\u2019 New York-based owner Saks Global, but it\u2019s been caught playing defense with both of these announcements.\nMeanwhile, Mayor Eric Johnson gets flak for his absence. The city\u2019s formerly Democratic leader (he switched parties mid-term) has missed so many city council meetings that it\u2019s prompted local news coverage. This combined with behavior like declaring Dallas a \u201cSanctuary City from Socialism\u201d has the editorial team at the Dallas Morning News concluding that he \u201cseems like the mayor of Somewhere Else.\u201d\nPrewitt said downtown dysfunction has more to do with the structure of city governance than leadership itself. The city has a \u201cweak mayor\u201d structure, which tips the balance of power to City Council, where Downtown is just a district with one vote, represented like any other slice of Dallas, despite its economic centrality.\nAs a result, the non-elected position of city manager gets elevated. Kimberly Bizor Tolbert was appointed to the role this year after serving as interim city manager since 2024. Developers and downtown stakeholders like her, praising her success in cutting the permit backlog and noting that she actually lives downtown.\nT\nhe balance\nRagan, Woods and Prewitt suspect that AT&amp;T\u2019s possible departure is more public relations spin than done deal.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re the head of real estate, the smartest thing for you to do would be to put as much leverage on the city as possible to make the city that you\u2019re going to be staying in as good as possible,\u201d Prewitt said. \u201cThe best way to do that is to convince them you\u2019re leaving.\u201d\nWoods and Prewitt have quite a bit of skin in the game; they own the 1-million-square-foot building AT&amp;T fully occupies.\nPicking on the city\u2019s problem child gets results. Ray Washburne, the developer who owns Highland Park Village, threatened to plop a data center in the middle of downtown in February to get the city to pay a premium on the old Dallas Morning News building, which is adjacent to its convention center project.\nThe city caved, agreeing to buy the property in April for $45.1 million, a 61 percent premium on the $28 million Washburne paid in 2019.\nTriolet thinks downtown champions will be correct, at least in part. He predicts AT&amp;T will nab some space in the suburbs (it already has 186,000 square feet in Richardson) but will also keep a big chunk of office space downtown.\nRagan gets teased by her developer peers who claim her cheerleading for downtown is just a ploy to sell the Purse Building, an adaptive reuse project she listed recently\u00a0 for $12.5 million after priming it for eight years.\nIf Ragan\u2019s boosterism has the sheen of a sales pitch, it\u2019s for a product she\u2019s bought. After redeveloping the Farmers Market, Ragan bought a condo in the area, and her office is downtown across from Dealey Plaza.\nShe has words for the haters: \u201cI would say a lot of those people don\u2019t spend a lot of time down here anyway,\u201d she said.",

But another home trounced it on a per-square-foot basis.\nA trust affiliated with Matt Cwiertnia, partner at Ares Management, acquired actress Betty White\u2019s old house at 506 North Carmelina Avenue in an off-market deal for roughly $30.9 million on Feb. 11, or $10,203 per square foot. The home is not a personal purchase for Cwiertnia.\nBeyer\u2019s home, at 11740 Crescenda Street, sold for $2,200 per square foot.\nThe acquisition of 506 North Carmelina Avenue marks the priciest sale in Brentwood through Aug. 25, according to Los Angeles County tax assessor data recently made available.\nThis is the latest installment in a feature providing a weekly update on top sales by market segment, based on TRD Data for given periods. You can see the top 10 single-family sales in Brentwood through Aug. 25 by clicking\nhere\n.\nThe seller of 506 North Carmelina Avenue, which clocks in at 3,029 square feet, was an entity linked to Soheil Moeini, president of Greystone Engineering Group.\nBuyer and seller agent information wasn\u2019t immediately available.\nLocated in Brentwood Park, 506 North Carmelina Avenue is gated and set back from the street on over three quarters of an acre with parklike grounds.\nThe \u201cGolden Girls\u201d star lived in the five-bedroom, six-bathroom home for\nmore than 50 years\nand died there on New Year\u2019s Eve in 2021 just shy of her 100th birthday.

        "content": "For months, real estate executives have poured millions of dollars into efforts to prevent Zohran Mamdani from becoming New York City\u2019s next mayor.\nIndustry players donated at least $13 million to political action committees backing former Gov. Andrew Cuomo or those simply opposing Mamdani, according to analysis by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThis money flowed as some in the industry warmed up to the idea of Mamdani becoming mayor, acknowledging that they supported elements of his housing plan and would\nwork closely\nwith him if he wins.\nTuesday will be the culmination of months of twists and turns in a race to replace Mayor Eric Adams at Gracie Mansion.\nMuch is at stake for real estate\n, which is losing a former\nally\nin City Hall and facing the prospect of a Democratic Socialist taking office. Some of the biggest policy fights over the last six years have played out between real estate groups and the Democratic Socialists of New York, and if Mamdani wins, the tension between the priorities of these frequent adversaries will be put to the test.\nStill, after winning the June primary, Mamdani\nmet with business leaders\nand emphasized points of common ground. He told The New Yorker that he is \u201cnot running to punish landlords.\u201d\nMamdani, the Democratic nominee, is considered the frontrunner, though\nsome recent polls\nshowed his lead over Cuomo shrinking.\nMost polls this month\nshow Mamdani with a 10-plus point lead. Republican Curtis Sliwa has polled at third place and has resisted calls to drop out of the race to give Cuomo a boost.\nHousing was a\nmajor issue\nin this election. Mamdani pledged to freeze rents for the city\u2019s one million stabilized apartments, a promise that is potentially threatened by the current mayor, who may appoint new members to the Rent Guidelines Board before he leaves office.\nLandlord groups argue that freezing rents cuts off one of the few remaining avenues that owners have to raise rents on stabilized housing, and will lead to further deterioration of this housing stock. In response to such concerns, Mamdani has said that he is committed to reforming the city\u2019s property tax system and exploring other forms of relief for landlords, including alternative forms of insurance. During the\nfinal mayoral debate\n, he said he wants to extend the property tax break J-51 to help owners with building renovations.\nHe also wants to build 200,000 new housing units over the next 10 years, funded by $70 billion in debt. To cover the debt service, he hopes to raise the corporate tax rate and add a 2 percent income tax on those making more than $1 million a year, changes that would require state action. Mamdani has also said he wants to make it easier for the private sector to build housing.\nCuomo\u2019s housing plan calls for building or preserving 500,000 homes over the next decade, funded in part by city pension funds. He has said he wants to initiate construction of such housing simultaneously across hundreds of sites, though\nit is not clear how this would be accomplished\n. He also wants to overhaul the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, pointing to the agency\u2019s backlog of housing projects.\nSliwa\u2019s housing plan focuses on converting empty office buildings into housing and filling up vacant stabilized units, rather than incentivizing the construction of new housing. He has repeatedly said he opposes the zoning changes under the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, the centerpiece of the Adams administration\u2019s housing agenda, as well as the housing-related ballot measures.\nOn Tuesday, voters will also weigh in on several ballot questions to decide if the city\u2019s land use review process should be overhauled for certain housing projects. City Council leadership adamantly\nopposes\nthree of the questions, which in some cases remove the body\u2019s ability to review housing projects or allows an appeals board to override its rejection of a development.\nThe fate of these questions will likely determine how the next mayor approaches his housing agenda. Cuomo supports the measures, while Sliwa opposes them. Mamdani has not publicly\nrevealed\nwhere he stands on the measures.\nThese are the most contentious of the housing questions:\nShould the city create two \u201cfast track\u201d options for affordable housing projects?\nIf approved, this measure would allow the Board of Standards and Appeals to sign off on zoning changes for publicly-funded affordable housing. Such projects would not have to go through the city\u2019s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure.\nThe other fast-track option would apply to affordable housing projects proposed in the 12 community districts that have approved the least amount of affordable housing. Starting in October 2026, the city would release a report identifying which districts have permitted the least amount of affordable housing in the previous five years. Such projects will go through a condensed Ulurp: Community Boards will have the same amount of time to review these proposals (60 days), but the applicable borough president will review the proposal at the same time, rather than for 30 days after the community board\u2019s review. The City Planning Commission, which will then have 30 days to review instead of 60, will have the final vote on these proposals, rather than the City Council.\nShould the city create a new land use review process for \u201cmodest\u201d housing and infrastructure projects?\nThis new review process, dubbed Expedited Land Use Review Procedure or Elurp, would apply to housing projects in medium- or high-density districts that increase residential capacity by no more than 30 percent or to housing projects in low-density districts that are no taller than 45 feet and have a maximum floor area ratio of two. Proposals to put solar panels on public buildings or other land would also qualify.\nElurp would follow the same timeline outlined in the previous question, but depending on the project type, either the City Planning Commission or the City Council\u2019s review is skipped. (Some projects require review by the City Council under state law.)\nShould the city replace the mayoral veto with an appeals board?\nUlurp currently ends with the mayor, who usually goes along with whatever action the City Council takes (with a\nfew exceptions\n). This proposal would replace the mayor\u2019s power to veto land use decisions with a three-person appeals board, consisting of the mayor, City Council speaker and the applicable borough president. The appeals board could reverse the City Council\u2019s rejection of projects that would create affordable housing. Such projects can only affect one borough. The appeals board can also restore such project proposals to the version approved by the City Planning Commission, undoing modifications approved by the City Council.\nA fourth housing proposal is decidedly less controversial:\nShould the city create a consolidated, digitized City Map?\nThe City Map is the official street map of the city and consists of more than 8,000 pieces of paper, administered across five borough presidents\u2019 offices. This proposal would create a single, digital map overseen by the Department of City Planning. The fragmented nature of the map has made city map changes \u201cperhaps the most feared ULURP actions among private applicants,\u201d according to the City Charter Revision Commission.\nThe final two questions are unrelated to housing:\nShould local elections take place the same year as presidential elections?\nThis would move elections for mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president, and City Council to even years to coincide with presidential elections, in a bid to increase voter turnout.\nShould a constitutional amendment\nretroactively\napprove the use of 323 acres of parkland for winter sports?\nThis land in Adirondack Park was developed for the 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. The state\u2019s Olympic Regional Development Association developed the public land without a constitutional amendment, as required by law. So, the ballot proposal, if approved, would bring the area into compliance, allow improvements and approve the state\u2019s purchase of 2,500 acres of forest land to make up for the lost parkland.\n",

J.P. Morgan is the senior lender, and Sculptor Real Estate is the junior lender, according to a press release.\nJLL\u2019s Melissa Rose and Brian Gaswirth arranged the financing on behalf of the developer.\nThe Residences at 1428 Brickell, a 195-unit project, is more than 60 percent presold, according to the release. Buyers are from more than 17 countries in Latin America and Europe, as well as from within the U.S., including Miami, New York, Chicago and San Francisco. Miami-based Ytech\nhired Cervera Real Estate\nto lead sales and marketing of the condos in 2022.\nThe 850-foot-tall building will mark the first high-rise residential building in the world that will be partially powered by solar power. The developer will integrate photovoltaic glazing in the glass facade that forms the building\u2019s \u201csolar backbone.\u201d\nExcluding penthouses, condos at 1428 Brickell range in price from $4.4 million to $10 million, and from 1,800 square feet to 4,000 square feet. The lower penthouses will be between 4,000 square feet and 7,000 square feet, and range in price from $10 million to $20 million, according to the release. The building will also have two $60 million penthouses, each with seven bedrooms, nine bathrooms and two balconies.\nThe 80,000-plus square feet of amenities will include three pools, a 10,000-square-foot fitness center, a two-story wine and art lounge, a spa with aquatic therapy, office suites and guest residences. The solar energy will be used to partially power the amenities.\nLast year, Ytech\nsecured $104 million\nin financing for multiple Brickell properties, which included a $78 million refinancing from Linkvest Capital of the acquisition loan for the development site at 1428 Brickell Avenue.\nYtech\npaid $26.5 million\nfor the 1.1-acre property in early 2017, plus tens of millions of dollars more to settle claims and other issues, the developer said at the time.\nThe latest financing package marks the biggest Brickell condo construction loan this year. Even though condo presales have slowed across South Florida, and developers are dealing with a myriad of cost increases, a handful of developers have been able to secure large loans to move their projects forward.\nIn September, Newgard Group and Two Roads Development\nsecured a $513 million financing\npackage for their One Brickell Riverfront luxury condo complex that\u2019s under construction. The project includes the 44-story, 362-unit Lofty Brickell tower and the 46-story, 422-unit Standard Residences tower. They\u2019ll share a podium.\nAnd in April, PMG scored\na $413 million construction loan\nfor its planned two-tower One Twenty Brickell Residences at 120 Southwest Eighth Street. Ares Management and Monarch Alternative Capital are the lenders.\n",

Hernandez, who has served on the Coachella City Council for nearly two decades, faces more than seven years in state prison and a lifetime ban from public office if convicted as charged.\nThe indictment from a Riverside County criminal grand jury accuses Hernandez of several misdemeanors for leveraging his job as a public official to influence governmental decisions where he could receive financial gain. Some of those instances include votes cast between 2021 and 2023 to use funds from the pandemic-related\nAmerican Rescue Plan Act\nto renovate Coachella\u2019s downtown fire station. Hernandez is additionally accused of pushing votes on a commercial project known as Fountainhead Plaza, an\naffordable apartment community\ncalled the Tripoli Mixed-Use project and a transit hub near downtown.\nThe mayor has also been charged with a felony for \u201cwillfully and unlawfully\u201d approving a contract in which he had a financial interest. The charge stems from when he voted for an agreement between the City of Coachella and the\nCoachella Valley\nAssociation of Governments\u2019 Housing First program aimed to serve homeless people.\nHe also faces four felony counts of perjury related to claims he made on his Statement of Economic Interests public disclosure forms, also known as Form 700, which makes public any potential financial interests in projects. In total, the indictment named 13 witnesses who testified in front of the grand jury, including a sitting City Council member, the city\u2019s economic development director, a former council member and a former city manager.\nThe Coachella Valley Association of Governments is fully cooperating with the district attorney\u2019s office and grand jury. \u201cThere has never been an implication from investigators that the investigation had anything to do with actions by elected officials serving in their [Coachella Valley Association of Governments] capacity,\u201d a spokesperson told the Times.\nHernandez\u2019s attorney, A. Alexander Lowder of the law firm Larson, confirmed that he and his client are seeking to remedy the issue. \u201cWe recognize the serious nature of these charges and will be working with our client to resolve the matter,\u201d Lowder said following the indictment coming down.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Burnham and Jenney were pivotal in rebuilding Chicago after the Great Fire of 1871 and helped lay the foundation for the modern skyscraper.\nIt\u2019s unclear what\nCalabria\n\u2014 who leads Bloomingdale-based IMC Accounting &amp; Tax \u2014 plans for either property, or how much he\u2019s paying for the Burnham-designed landmark. He did not respond to requests for comment from the outlet.\nCalabria is no stranger to adaptive reuse. He\u2019s a partner in the planned conversion of part of the 41-story Clark Adams Building at\n105 West Adams Street\ninto 400 apartments.\nThe off-market deal continues the turbulent recent history of the\nRailway Exchange Building\n, a 1904 Burnham design known for its white terra cotta fa\u00e7ade and glass atrium. The University of Notre Dame handed the property back to its lender, a New York Life Insurance subsidiary, in January through a deed in lieu of foreclosure. The university had owned the property for nearly 20 years and refinanced it with a $47.5 million loan in 2015, according to Cook County records.\nNew York Life declined to comment on the transaction. The building, across from Grant Park, is about 37 percent vacant, according to CoStar. It still houses marquee architecture firms\nSkidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill\nand Goettsch Partners, both spiritual descendants of Burnham\u2019s visionary urbanism.\nBurnham himself worked from an upper floor overlooking Lake Michigan until his death in 1912. The building was commissioned by the Santa Fe Railroad to host multiple rail companies \u2014 a logical assignment for Burnham, fresh off designing the \u201cWhite City\u201d for the 1893 World\u2019s Columbian Exposition.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Dennis and Yana Chernov have packed up and left The Agency for new digs at\nEquity Union Real Estate\n.\nThe move comes after a little over three years at The Agency.\nThe Sherman Oaks-based couple counts nine agents and 10 staffers on their team. They generated sales volume of $329.6 million across 124 transactions last year, according to RealTrends. That volume placed the team fifth in the state and 13th nationally in RealTrends\u2019 rankings.\nEquity Union CEO Harma Hartouni called out Dennis Chernov in a statement as \u201chumble\u201d and said he \u201cworks hard and is well respected within our community.\u201d\nTeam Chernov has racked up more than $3 billion in career sales with its business encompassing luxury homes, new construction and condos.\nThe addition for the Sherman Oaks-headquartered brokerage is the latest growth spurt for Equity Union. It opened a Calabasas office earlier this year and is slated to open a Westside outpost next month.\nElsewhere around Southern California, here\u2019s a look at who else padded their\nbrokerage rosters\nover the past month.\n\u27a4 Revel Real Estate landed DBL Realtors founder\nAlan Long\nas sales manager.\nWith almost five decades of industry experience under Long\u2019s belt, Revel founder Ben Bacal is looking to the brokerage\u2019s latest addition to help mentor and coach the group\u2019s agents.\nLong got his start in the industry at Bob Crane and Associates and is known for scaling DBL to an 800-agent brokerage with $5 billion in annual sales. Sotheby\u2019s International Realty acquired the business in 2004 for an undisclosed sum, while Long went on to serve as the brokerage\u2019s Southern California region president until his retirement in 2008. After that, he founded the brokerage Rising Star Realtors and sold that to Windmere Realty in 2018 before moving on to Avenue 8 in 2021 as L.A. managing director.\nLong described his new role as not so much about \u201creinventing the wheel\u201d as it is about \u201csharpening it.\u201d\n\u27a4 Carolwood Estates snapped up Jeremy Greenberg, who joined the Beverly Hills-based brokerage in another departure from The Agency.\nAmong Greenberg\u2019s recent deals is a Hollywood Hills home that sold for $3.5 million and a Sherman Oaks property for $2.3 million last month. Those deals came on the heels of a $2.6 million Beverly Hills trade.\n\u27a4 In brokerage office activity, Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Pacific Palisades office, which had been closed for renovations following the Palisades Fire, is officially back open.\nThe recently reopened space is located on Sunset Boulevard.\n",

        "content": "OpenAI is looking to grow beyond San Francisco.\nThe ChatGPT maker is looking to add up to 500,000 square feet of offices to its global portfolio, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The company has been purportedly touring offices in Mountain View, but hasn\u2019t yet settled on a place to call home.\nOpenAI has\ngrown its campus\nin San Francisco\u2019s Mission Bay quite a bit in recent years. In 2023, the Sam Altman-led firm subleased nearly half a million square feet of offices from Uber at 1455 and 1515 3rd Street in Mission Bay. The following year, OpenAI grabbed all 315,000 square feet of space next door at 550 Terry A. Francois Boulevard.\nIn planting a flag in Silicon Valley, the company would be closer to top engineering talent, allowing it to grow its head count. In March, company executives\ncommitted\nto doubling its current San Francisco-based workforce of 2,000 people.\n\u201cWe\u2019re always exploring how to grow our presence in a way that works best for our people and our mission,\u201d an OpenAI spokesperson told the Business Times of the Silicon Valley office search.\nWhile\nartificial intelligence companies have been growing in San Francisco\nin recent years, more have been expanding in Silicon Valley. Companies like Databricks, OpenAI, Anthropic and Scale AI have ramped up their search for employees in Santa Clara County, with the county\u2019s share of AI job postings in the region jumping to 8.3 percent from 3.4 percent over the past three years, per Lightcast data cited by the Business Times. San Francisco retains the lion\u2019s share, but that\u2019s fallen from 96 percent to 91 percent over the same period.\nThe trend has seen the office markets in various cities and submarkets around the Bay Area humming back to life as\ntenant demand\nreaches its highest level in more than three years. Of those searching for new offices, more than half of demand is from tech and AI companies.\nElon Musk\u2019s xAI, for example,\njust expanded in Palo Alto\nnear Tesla\u2019s engineering hub and is looking to grow more in the Silicon Valley city. AI startup\nDatabricks similarly grabbed 305,000 square feet\nof offices in Sunnyvale earlier this year while expanding its San Francisco headquarters.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The bank has opened roughly 70 branches since 2018 and marked its 200th earlier this year in Pflugerville, north of Austin.\nGreen said the September rate cut \u2014 made independently of the\nFederal Reserve\n\u2014 has spurred home mortgage and refinancing lending, a rare boost in a market slowed by high borrowing costs.\n\u201cWe struck a nerve on the refinance point,\u201d Green said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing refinance activity in addition to purchase money activity.\u201d He added that many customers with adjustable-rate mortgages are shifting to fixed-rate loans before resets hit.\nWhile mergers have reshaped Texas\u2019 banking landscape, Green said Frost isn\u2019t looking to buy rivals.\n\u201cWe believe our organic growth success is at the top end of the industry,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can do it yourself, you spend a third to half less than what you\u2019d pay in an acquisition.\u201d\nThe 155-year-old lender is leaning on a combination of technology upgrades, high-touch service and selective new branches \u2014 a formula Green said has proven scalable and cost-effective.\nThat strategy is reflected in Frost\u2019s strong third-quarter results, released last week.\nThe bank\u2019s net income rose 19 percent year-over-year to $172.7 million, or $2.67 per share, beating Wall Street forecasts by 29 cents.\nNet interest income climbed 9 percent to $463.7 million as the bank\u2019s margin widened to 3.69 percent. Average loans grew 6.8 percent to $21.5 billion, deposits rose 3.3 percent to $42.1 billion, and credit quality improved sharply with nonperforming loans dropping 57 percent to $44.8 million \u2014 the lowest level since before the pandemic.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Nussbaum and Associates revealed creditors were seeking to collect more than $400 million from Nussbaum\u2019s former law firms, according to new court filings.\nThe amount of creditors\u2019 claims had not been previously known. Nussbaum\u2019s firms are undergoing an alternative to bankruptcy, known as\nassignment for the benefit of creditors\n, to liquidate assets and repay creditors.\nThe fiduciary is now seeking to obtain a judge\u2019s approval to hire new forensic accountants, citing \u201climited formalized records, books and ledgers\u201d of Nussbaum\u2019s law firms.\n\u201cThe lion\u2019s share of the assets and the (Nussbaum) estate\u2019s value likely must be derived through the tracing of banking records and contemporaneous communications,\u201d said Sheldon Eisenberger in a recent filing in New York State Supreme Court.\nThe creditors are seeking repayment on funds they advanced to Nussbaum\u2019s law firms. Nussbaum is hoping to resolve these claims in civil court, while also facing criminal charges of grand larceny from the\nManhattan District Attorney\u2019s office\nover missing escrow funds. (Nussbaum has pleaded not guilty).\nNussbaum was a real estate transactional attorney with an office in Manhattan. He began using his law firm\u2019s escrow accounts into a conduit for bridge loans. and used investor money to lend to real estate dealmakers. In turn, the investors would make a return and Nussbaum would collect a fee for facilitating the transaction, according to sources familiar with the situation.\nBut in January, Nussbaum started running a deficit and stopped paying investors.\nNursing home executive Jacob Sod filed a lawsuit in New York Supreme Court, alleging Nussbaum had failed to return $15 million. Lawsuits started piling up as Nussbaum\u2019s clients sought to recoup their money.\nIn a short time, Nussbaum closed his law firm, Nussbaum Lowinger. Instead of resolving the dispute through bankruptcy, he opted to go through an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors, or an ABC.\nAs part of the ABC process, Nussbaum appointed attorney Sheldon Eisenberger to act as a fiduciary to liquidate Nussbaum\u2019s assets to pay back creditors. The process is still ongoing.\nNussbaum\u2019s largest asset is reportedly his accounts receivable, which is related to outstanding debts or loans he provided to real estate dealmakers. Nussbaum is accused of using a tactic referred to as \u201cshow capital,\u201d in which he would temporarily deposit money into a real estate dealmaker\u2019s account to make it appear as if the dealmaker was capitalized.\nNussbaum also owned\nreal estate in Chicago\n. But many of those assets, consisting of small multifamily residential properties in Chicago\u2019s South and West Side, have fallen into foreclosure.\nUntangling the web of entities and transactions connected to Nussbaum has proven to be a challenge.\nEisenberger is seeking to appoint Patrick A. Chylinski and David Harkavy of Armanino Advisory as forensic accountants to help trace Nussbaum\u2019s assets and transactions.\nArmanino Advisory\u2019s responsibilities include: conducting a forensic analysis of Nussbaum Lowinger\u2019s books and records, preparing a fraudulent conveyance analysis, and possibly filing tax returns, according to Eisenberger\u2019s filing.\nNussbaum\u2019s attorney did not return a request for comment. Eisenberger also did not return a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Real estate executives poured millions of dollars into PACs opposing Zohran Mamdani\u2019s bid for mayor. Tuesday will determine if these efforts paid off.\nIndustry professionals donated at least $13 million to political action committees either backing Andrew Cuomo or more generally opposing Mamdani, according to a\nTRD\nanalysis of filings with the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board through Oct. 28.\nRoughly half of that went to the pro-Cuomo PAC, Fix the City, but a majority of donations from the industry to that PAC came in before the June primary. As I\u2019ve\npreviously reported\n, the industry backed away from Cuomo after the primary and some opened their checkbooks for Mayor Eric Adams. When it\nbecame clear\nthat Adams\u2019 campaign could not gain enough momentum, some turned back to Cuomo.\nFor example, Extell Development\u2019s Gary Barnett gave Fix the City $260,000 before the primary. He contributed $250,000 to a pro-Eric Adams PAC in July. Then, last month, he gave Fix the City $100,000 and another $180,000 to Defend NYC, an anti-Mamdani PAC.\nPost-primary, donations have flowed to PACs opposing Mamdani. Kamson Corporation\u2019s Richard Kurtz gave $100,000 to the Anyone But Mamdani PAC, and Himmel and Meringoff Properties\u2019 Stephen Meringoff contributed $10,000. Lightstone Real Estate Partners and Midtown Equities\u2019 Joseph Cayre were the top real estate donors to another anti-Mamdani PAC, New Yorkers for a Better Future Mayor 25, respectively contributing $150,000 and $100,000.\nAdditionally, industry executives have contributed to Put NYC First, a group that has given anti-Mamdani and pro-Cuomo PACs upwards of\n$7.6 million\n. For example, the group gave Stop the Socialists, a pro-Cuomo and anti-Mamdani and anti-Curtis Sliwa PAC, $1 million.\nThe city\u2019s Campaign Finance website lists Infinite Global Real Estate Partners\u2019 Marty Burger and Mack Real Estate Group\u2019s Richard Mack among Put NYC First\u2019s leaders.\nMack, Island Capital\u2019s Andrew Farkas and RFR Holding\u2019s Aby Rosen each gave the group $250,000. Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia donated $1 million.\nAirbnb gave $10 million to Affordable New York, a PAC that spent $440,533 on ads opposing Mamdani ahead of the June primary.\nPro-Mamdani PACs received about $82,000 from real estate professionals. Most of that came from Beachwold Residential CEO Gideon Friedman, who gave\n$50,000\nto New Yorkers for Lower Costs in June.\nVoters will decide Tuesday who will\nsucceed\nMayor Eric Adams. Campaign and PAC donations can only tell us so much about the race, though they show that some in the real estate industry hoped that ramping up spending could help whittle down Mamdani\u2019s significant lead over Cuomo. Donations also reflect that the industry\nisn\u2019t a monolith\n\u2014 some, including affordable housing developers, have donated to Mamdani\u2019s campaign and have spoken favorably about his housing plans.\nWe\u2019ll see where things land Tuesday!\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: I\u2019ll be covering the election results. If you\u2019d like to share your reaction to the race, please send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: There are\neight different cuts\nof the 1982 film \u201cBladerunner.\u201d The one originally released in theaters included a voiceover, mandated by studio executives before its release.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Police say a Brooklyn man parachuted off the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge on Sunday as the bridge was reopened to traffic after the New York City marathon,\nGothamist reports\n. Jonathan Warren, 40, parachuted to Calvert Vaux Park in Bath Beach, about two miles away from the bridge, according to police. He faces a reckless endangerment charge.\n\u2014 President Donald Trump\ntold CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d\nthat, between Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani, who he respectively referred to as a \u201cbad Democrat\u201d and \u201ca communist,\u201d his pick for mayor is the former governor. \u201cI\u2019m going to pick the bad Democrat all the time, to be honest with you,\u201d he said. On Monday, Cuomo rejected the idea that Trump\u2019s comments amounted to an endorsement,\namNY reports\n.\n\u2014 Gov. Kathy Hochul on Monday canvassed in support of the housing ballot measures, which would overhaul the city\u2019s land use review process for some housing projects.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$8.4 million\nfor a condominium unit at 11 Beach Street. The Tribeca condo is 3,200 square feet and new construction.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s\nJohn Gomes, Fredrik Eklund and Terry Martinolle have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$29 million\nfor 6-8 East 82nd Street. The Metropolitan Museum of Art sold the two townhouse buildings, which are 13,000 square feet combined.\nCorcoran\u2019s\nCarrie Chiang and Andres Perea-Garzon have the listing.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $34 million for 121 East 65th Street. The Lenox Hill townhouse is 9,400 square feet.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\nhas the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 49,070-square-foot, 15-story, 65-unit, mixed-use building at 2730 Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn.

        "content": "Toby Moskovits\nand Michael Lichtenstein, once-prolific Brooklyn developers whose partnership came unraveled under the\nweight of debts\nthey couldn\u2019t pay, have been charged with fraudulently trying to obtain $5 million in Covid-era government loans.\nThey\u2019re accused of using forgiven payroll loans to pay their lawyers, architects and even a hat shop.\nProsecutors from the Southern District of New York charged the developers on October 27 with three counts of fraud related to the Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loan program.\n\u201cAfter obtaining funds from these programs, Lichtenstein and Moskovits used most of the funds for purposes that were not permitted by the programs and lied about doing so,\u201d prosecutors wrote in their indictment.\nInstead of using the monies to pay employees and for working capital, prosecutors allege Moskovits and Lichtenstein used the funds \u201cto pay lawyers, architecture firms, a real estate lender, a real estate and titles services company, and for expenses\u201d related to a residential development in the Bronx.\nProsecutors said the duo fraudulently obtained $1.9 million in loans and tried to get another $3.1 million between March 2020 and April 2022.\nIn 2020, the developers got a $1.4 million PPP loan through their hotel management company from a bank and used the money to pay $15,000 to a real estate attorney and another $10,000 to an architecture firm, according to prosecutors. Then they submitted a forgiveness application saying the money was used for eligible payroll costs, which was approved by the Small Business Administration.\nIn 2021, they applied for another $2 million loan, with Moskovits explaining, \u201cWe need the PPP funds in order to get through this difficult period and pay the salaries of the 90 people that rely on us for their living wages.\u201d\n\u201cIf you look at the first PPP loan that [the Hotel Management Company] received, all of it went to pay people\u2019s salaries and to cover payroll. None of it went for other purposes,\u201d she told her bank.\nBut prosecutors say that just wasn\u2019t true.\n\u201cIn fact, Lichtenstein and Moskovits had used less than half of the 2020 PPP loan to \u2018to pay people\u2019s salaries and to cover payroll,\u2019\u201d they allege.\nThe bank ultimately denied the loan on the grounds that Moskovits and Lichtenstein had not disclosed their interest in the hotel company in connection with the previous loan.\nRepresentatives for Moskovits and Lichtenstein could not be immediately reached for comment.\nMoskovits, an Orthodox Jewish single mother of three, worked in Israel\u2019s tech venture capital industry and then turned to real estate during the Great Recession, emerging as one of Brooklyn\u2019s\nbiggest builders\n.\nShe built a reputation by developing ambitious projects in relatively untested neighborhoods, including the\n147-key Williamsburg Hotel\nand\n25 Kent\n\u2014 a 500,000-square-foot office complex that was the first ground-up commercial development in Williamsburg in more than 40 years.\nBut Heritage Equity has come under duress in recent years.\nThey\nlost their Williamsburg Hotel\nin 2023 in bankruptcy.\n",

        "content": "A 1920s duplex in Arlington Heights is poised to become a fully affordable housing development.\nGrace Kwok of Crane Canyon filed an application to build a five-story, 52-unit residential building on the site, at 2100 South Crenshaw Boulevard in Arlington Heights, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n.\nThe latest proposal builds on a\n2022 application from Kwok\nseeking to redevelop the parcel into a five-story building with 17 units. The project aimed to tap\nTransit Oriented Communities\ndevelopment incentives to build a larger structure than what zoning allows. In exchange, the development would\u2019ve designated three apartments for affordable housing.\nNow the developer is going all in on affordable housing by using\nMayor Karen Bass\u2019 Executive Directive 1\n, which streamlines and expedites applications for multifamily proposals that seek to build 100 percent affordable housing projects.\nThe Crenshaw Boulevard building is being designed by PDS Studio. It\u2019s near a construction site for a four-story, 31-unit apartment building with ground-floor retail at the northeast corner of Washington Boulevard and Norton Avenue.\nED1 has increasingly become the go-to conduit for multifamily construction in Los Angeles as\ndevelopers lean away from market-rate housing construction\n.\nThe ordinance was enacted in late 2022, and as of this August, developers had submitted proposals for 35,000 ED1-backed units and secured approvals for about 29,000. That dwarfs the number of affordable housing submissions from 2020 to 2022 as well as the 17,556 total housing units approved in L.A. during the last fiscal year.\nMarket-rate housing construction \u201chas been essentially canceled at this point,\u201d Chris Aiello, founding partner at Six Peak Capital,\ntold\nCoStar. \u201cVirtually no land makes sense from an investment perspective to build market rate.\u201d\nWhile developers might be doubling down on fully affordable projects, Los Angeles is still behind on its\nhousing element\n. The city must permit 456,643 new units by 2029; of those, 184,721 must be set aside for affordable housing.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Zillow\u2019s\nbattle against private listings\nmay be coming for the Chicago-area MLS.\nThe online home search giant has warned Midwest Real Estate Data (MRED) that its Private Listing Network \u2014 which makes listings available to all brokers in the area but keeps them off public websites like Zillow \u2014 violates Zillow\u2019s\nnew listing standards\n.\nIn a message sent to some managing brokers obtained by\nThe Real Deal\n, MRED, which operates the region\u2019s MLS, said some managing brokers have received phone calls from Zillow regarding the\nPrivate Listing Network (PLN)\n. The email said Zillow\u2019s new Listing Access Standards \u201cmay result in certain PLN listings not being displayed on Zillow\u2019s property search websites.\u201d\nZillow is not yet enforcing its listing rules in the Chicago market, according to both Zillow and MRED, meaning listings that were previously on the PLN are still showing up on Zillow, when agents and their clients decide to go more public with their offerings after initially testing the private network. But the dispute adds another layer to Zillow\u2019s rules that were largely brought as a reaction to\noffice-exclusive listings by brokerages like Compass\n.\n\u201cMRED issued a notice to our managing brokers after receiving reports that some had been informed their active listings may not appear on Zillow if they had previously been in MRED\u2019s Private Listing Network,\u201d MRED CEO Rebecca Jensen said in a statement.\nZillow has been working with MRED for months to address the dispute, a Zillow spokesperson said. The company has not sent any warnings to agents about their listings and has only reached out to managing brokers. Elsewhere, Zillow began enforcing the rules in June.\n\u201cWe have been attempting to work with them since the spring and have not yet sent listing access violations in MRED,\u201d a Zillow spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThis is a play for MRED to protect its own private listing network. Hidden listing schemes disadvantage sellers and buyers, and that\u2019s what this is.\u201d\nThe Zillow spokesperson also said 30 percent of buyers searching in Chicago are searching from outside the area, meaning they may not have a local broker and won\u2019t see listings on the private network.\nIn its internal message, MRED defended the PLN and warned Zillow may violate its licensing agreement with MRED if it withholds certain listings from its website. The agreement \u201crequires Zillow to access and display all licensed listings without bias or restriction,\u201d MRED said.\n\u201cMRED takes seriously our responsibility to license your data and to ensure that every company receiving that data complies fully with its license obligations,\u201d the message said.\nMRED has held up the PLN, launched in 2016, as a fairer alternative to office exclusive listings that are fully off the MLS. It is also largely backed by supporters and opponents of Clear Cooperation Policy alike as a way to keep listings out of public channels but ensure they are seen by all the brokers in the market. Buyers working with a Chicago broker can also use an app called Zenlist to see PLN listings.\nCompass\nfiled a lawsuit\nagainst Zillow over the new standards in June, which hinted at the dispute playing out now. Compass\u2019 initial complaint recounted a meeting between Compass CEO Robert Reffkin and Zillow executives. In the meeting, Reffkin brought up MRED\u2019s private listing network while defending Compass\u2019 network. Zillow Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Hofmann said Zillow \u201cwill no longer allow that to happen,\u201d according to the complaint.\nZillow\u2019s rules state that a listing must be entered into the MLS and available to be published on Zillow within one business day of being publicly marketed, closely mirroring the National Association of Realtors\u2019 Clear Cooperation Policy. However, Clear Cooperation Policy allows MLS-wide private listing services like MRED\u2019s.\nZillow considers public marketing to include \u201cmulti-brokerage private listing networks\u201d and \u201cmarketing or sharing listings through any network that involves multiple brokerages,\u201d which appears to be where the policy conflicts with the PLN.\nListings that are made only on the private listing network and not marketed elsewhere or later shared online in line with Zillow\u2019s standards, according to the Frequently Asked Questions section on Zillow\u2019s website. So only listings that move from private to public, or are private but advertised through social media or a brokerage\u2019s website, would violate the rules.\nZillow\u2019s standards say that it will give brokers warnings for their first and second listing that violate the rules without taking them down. The third non-compliant listing will be blocked from Zillow, along with any further non-compliant listings. Any future listings from the same broker that don\u2019t violate the rules won\u2019t be blocked.\nNeither company said definitively what its next move is. Zillow did not say when it will begin enforcing its listing standards in Chicago, and MRED offered no specific details on its plans for the PLN.\nThad Wong, the co-founder of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, said MRED is \u201cstanding up for its professionals\u201d by defending the PLN. Wong, whose firm was bought by Compass in 2024, has\nopposed Clear Cooperation Policy\nand argued private listings give sellers more choice in how they sell their home.\n\u201cWhile some MLSs have chosen to align with portals that promote a one-size-fits-all model, MRED is championing innovation, entrepreneurship, and competition,\u201d Wong said in a statement provided by a spokesperson.\n",

        "content": "Embattled New York-based attorney\nMark Nussbaum\nand his deal partner, Eli Tauber, are now the subject of a combined 29 foreclosure lawsuits for real estate across the South and West sides of Chicago all filed within the last five months.\nLenders allege that Nussbaum \u2014 who\u2019s under indictment by the Manhattan District Attorney for alleged grand larceny tied to missing escrow funds\u00a0 \u2014 and Tauber are behind on payments toward a cumulative $24 million of mortgages backed by Chicago multifamily properties.\nBased on the court flings, Tauber and Nussbaum\u2019s dealings appear to show a larger trend in the South and West sides of Chicago. Properties were purchased multiple times among a circle of investors based in New York and New Jersey and in many cases, sales of the same properties made in quick succession have dramatically increased their values. In some cases, Tauber and Nussbaum took out debt together and in other cases they did so independently, legal filings show. Even when Nussbaum\u2019s name doesn\u2019t appear on a mortgage it sometimes shows up in other documents related to the same property.\nAs Nussbaum\u2019s multifamily portfolio begins to crumble, legal filings show how a group of run-down apartment buildings in some of Chicago\u2019s poorest neighborhoods can become ensnared in an ever-expanding web of New York real estate drama.\nThe Department of Justice and the overseer of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, have been zeroing in on flips or sales between related parties and have already taken down some East Coast real estate players. Many of those at the center of the DOJ\u2019s investigation have ties to\nLakewood, New Jersey\n.\nSome conspirators, including Eli and Aron Puretz,\nMoshe Silber\n, Fred Schulman and Boruch Drillman, have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud.\nThe DOJ has not brought any criminal charges or allegations of wrongdoing against Nussbaum and there is no known investigation into Nussbaum\u2019s transactions in Chicago.\nBut he is dealing with his own slate of legal troubles.\nNussbaum\u2019s financial woes started earlier this year. He used his law firm\u2019s escrow services as a pass-through to provide bridge loans to real estate dealmakers. By doing so, he raked in a fee, his clients made money and real estate owners scored quick loans to close deals.\nAt some point, however, Nussbaum started running a deficit. A nursing home executive named Jacob Sod filed a lawsuit demanding Nussbaum return $15 million in escrow money. Others followed suit and Nussbaum shut down his law firm in January.\nIn May, the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office charged Nussbaum with grand larceny, alleging he took over $15 million in client escrow money. And there may be additional victims, the D.A.\u2019s office said at the time. Nussbaum has pleaded not guilty and is out on a $500,000 bond.\nThe latest foreclosures\nThe latest batch of 12 Chicago foreclosure lawsuits to hit Nussbaum and Tauber were filed within the last few weeks. Wilmington Trust, acting as a trustee for creditors, filed all but one of the most recent foreclosure complaints against the duo. All of them allege that either Nussbaum, Tauber or both have been in default on loans tied to the properties since February or March of this year.\nThe city of Chicago issued an additional complaint in July against Tauber regarding a series of unaddressed code violations at 2814 East 78th Street in the South Shore neighborhood. The complaint alleges that the building, which Tauber bought for $1 million in 2024, is currently vacant and \u201crapidly becoming dangerous.\u201d\nAnother property facing foreclosure, 1135 West Garfield Boulevard, had been subject to a particularly extreme flip. In just one year, the sale price of the 9,000-square-foot West Garfield building more than tripled from $245,000 to $875,000.\nA Lakewood-based company called CMP Trading initially bought the building in March 2022. A week later, CMP flipped the property to Myer Kahan of Lakewood for $420,000, a 71 percent increase. The same day Kahan scored a $315,000 loan \u2014 more than CMP Trading had laid down.\nThe property had code violations including a bathroom floor collapsing, fractures on the building\u2019s exterior and cracks on the staircase.\nA year after the flip, Nussbaum\u2019s name started to appear on documents related to 1135 West Garfield. An LLC controlled by Nussbaum then took control of the property for $875,000 through a special warranty deed, and secured a loan from Roc Capital, a lender specializing in fix-and-flip loans, for $770,000.\nThe new sale price was more than double the property\u2019s value a year earlier. Chicago records do not list any building permits, suggesting there were no substantial repairs or improvements.\nLast summer, Nussbaum\u2019s LLC cleared the violations with the city, then secured a $1.1 million loan from Cliffco Mortgage Lenders, an amount 25 percent larger than the last sale price. This time, Eliazer Tauber signed for the loan to the LLC, instead of Nussbaum.\nNow, the building is facing a foreclosure lawsuit from Wilmington, which claims Nussbaum hasn\u2019t made payments toward the building\u2019s mortgage since February.\nNussbaum\u2019s other transactions in Chicago follow a similar pattern, showing sudden increases in sales prices in an otherwise difficult market.\nRepresentatives for Wilmington declined to comment and Nussbaum, Tauber and the other building\u2019s lenders did not respond to requests for comment.\nAn ever expanding web\nAs more foreclosures come in, Nussbaum\u2019s efforts to address his financial problems highlight his connection to other high profile real estate players who are also facing trouble.\nIn June, a month after Nussbaum was charged with grand larceny, his law firms, Nussbaum Lowinger and Mark J Nussbaum Associates, filed a petition in New York Supreme Court to start a process known as an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors (ABC). The process is an alternative to bankruptcy, considered a faster and less bureaucratic process than Chapter 7 or 11.\nDetails about Nussbaum\u2019s total debts and assets remain a mystery. An ABC is not overseen by a bankruptcy judge, but rather an \u201cassignee\u201d who acts as a liquidator and is appointed by Nussbaum.\nThrough the process,\ncreditors are seeking to collect $400 million\nfrom Nussbaum\u2019s former law firms. Nussbaum reportedly still has tens of millions of dollars owed to him on loans he made. If he can collect on those, he could repay at least some of his creditors.\nNussbaum worked with some of the New York tri-state area\u2019s largest dealmakers, including Shaya Prager and Joel Schreiber, and he\u2019s seeking to resolve some of his issues with former clients via the ABC process.\nPrager is facing financial distress in\nTexas and across the Midwest\n, after\nspending billions buying up suburban office properties\n.\nNussbaum\u2019s ABC process could also include going after any debts owed by the estate of the late Mendel Steiner, with whom Nussbaum once allegedly worked closely. Steiner died by suicide in January as lawsuits started piling up. Nussbaum\u2019s attorney has alleged the $15 million that nursing home executive Sod sued him over went to a company affiliated with Steiner.\n",

        "content": "Cook County leaders clinched a rare win on property taxes in Springfield, as lawmakers approved a measure expanding tax relief for\nlow-income seniors\n\u2014 a move that could shift costs elsewhere and add fuel to the county\u2019s political battles ahead of next year\u2019s elections.\nThe bill, passed in the closing hours of the fall legislative session, raised the income threshold for the state\u2019s \u201csenior freeze\u201d program to $75,000 starting with 2027 tax bills, up from $65,000 in Cook County and $55,000 elsewhere, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nThe break, which freezes the taxable value of a home for qualifying seniors, was designed to shield those on fixed incomes from rising assessments and property taxes. Lawmakers also linked the same income limit to the state\u2019s senior deferral loan program, which allows participants to borrow against future home sales to pay their bills.\nThe measure is a major win for Cook County Board President\nToni Preckwinkle\nand Assessor\nFritz Kaegi\n, both of whom face primary challengers next March. Kaegi framed the change as protection against seniors \u201closing their homes because of unmanageable property tax increases.\u201d But his bid to make the tax freeze automatic failed.\nThe legislation also gives\nCounty Clerk Monica Gordon\nauthority to create payment plans for owners trying to redeem delinquent taxes sold at auction \u2014 a tool aimed at keeping low-income homeowners from losing their properties.\nOpposition came from the South Suburban Mayors and Managers Association, which warned the expanded freeze would push more of the burden onto homeowners already hit hard by double-digit increases this year.\nMedian residential bills in some south suburbs jumped nearly 20 percent last year, with spikes surpassing that in towns such as Markham, Hazel Crest and Calumet Park. The association\u2019s executive director, Kristi DeLaurentiis, argued that Cook County is underestimating how many will qualify under the new limits and that even small increases in property value will drive up tax bills.\nCounty officials countered that the impact will be modest, citing University of Illinois at Chicago data suggesting any uptick in rates would be gradual and minimal. The bill also pushes the due date for the county\u2019s spring installment bills from March 1 to April 1, giving taxpayers an extra month between\npayments\n.\nThat scheduling change caps a chaotic property tax season marked by delays, a budget hearing blowup, and public feuding among county officials.\nTreasurer Maria Pappas, up for reelection alongside Kaegi and Preckwinkle, threatened to hold back first installment bills \u201cno matter what anyone tells me\u201d as tensions flared over delays tied to a long-troubled billing system overhaul by Tyler Technologies.\nFor now, only 11,000 parcels still show calculation errors, and officials say tax data should be ready for printing this week.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

It was the largest transaction this year by both price and size, per Kidder Matthews.\nPrologis already owns 13 buildings totaling more than 500,000 square feet at the Crocker complex. The complex is 95 percent leased with tenants including Ample Battery, Fanatics, Encore Expositions, Mytra Logistics Planning and Twist Bioscience, Wismattec Asian Foods, Unipart and Greenleaf.\nThe Bay Area\u2019s artificial intelligence-driven comeback is pouring venture capital into the emerging sector. At the same time, e-commerce is\ndriving leasing\nat warehouses in industrial complexes across the country. E-commerce accounts for almost 20 percent of new leasing with Prologis.\nAI demand has been a crucial driver for Prologis\u2019 industrial properties, with most of its properties benefiting from AI growth. Prologis\u2019 latest acquisition in Brisbane speaks to the Bay Area\u2019s strong fundamentals, company vice president and investment officer Bobby Gray told the outlet.\nIndustrial space is becoming increasingly tight in the region, with the San Francisco Peninsula being one of the most supply-constrained markets in the country thanks in part to limited land, steady rent growth and proximity to large population centers. Brisbane is one of the area\u2019s last remaining clusters of industrial property, Gray said.\nAnother San Francisco-based firm, Sixth Street, also did a massive deal last month, in the United Kingdom. The firm\nrecapitalized a 37-property, 1.7 million-square-foot industrial portfolio\nowned by Clipstone Industrial REIT for $472 million. Sixth Street and Clipstone formed a joint venture as part of that deal to buy more real estate assets.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Gov. Dan Patrick, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and President Donald Trump \u2014 argues that gambling giants are trying to \u201cbuy Texas politics.\u201d Her campaign has labeled Huffman a \u201cwholly owned subsidiary\u201d of the\nLas Vegas Sands\n, whose billionaire Adelson family, owner of the\nDallas Mavericks\n, has poured more than $1.2 million directly into his campaign and paid for another $2 million in ads.\nHuffman, a real estate developer endorsed by\nFort Worth Mayor Mattie Parker\nand State Rep. Charlie Geren, calls it a matter of voter choice.\n\u201cTexans can decide for themselves whether they want destination resorts,\u201d he said, noting that the\nAdelsons\nare longtime donors to top Republican leaders, including Trump and Cruz.\nHe fired back at Wambsganss over her husband\u2019s past involvement in charitable gaming, calling her attacks hypocritical.\nThe mudslinging has turned personal. A doctored image depicting Wambsganss with a satanic symbol circulated late in the race, prompting her to call it \u201cdemonic.\u201d Patrick defended her and blamed Huffman, whose campaign denied involvement.\nBehind the theatrics lies a larger fight looming over Austin next session. Casino operators, led by Sands, plan to push for a constitutional amendment allowing resort-style casinos \u2014 a move that requires two-thirds support in both chambers and voter approval statewide.\nPatrick, who controls the Senate agenda, has said it lacks the votes.\nA third candidate, Democrat Taylor Rehmet, a machinist and former union leader, hopes to capitalize on the GOP infighting. He supports casino expansion if it brings \u201cgood union-paying jobs\u201d and pledges to focus on workers\u2019 rights and higher wages.\nEarly voting has ended, and with millions already spent, the outcome could determine not only who represents Tarrant County but also whether Texas ever rolls the dice on casinos.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Canadian buyers are retreating from high-end South Florida markets, driven by the Trump administration\u2019s trade and immigration policies and a softer exchange rate, even as Latin American demand remains strong.\nCanada\u2019s share of foreign buyers shopping for U.S. homes online has dropped to 32.1 percent in the third quarter, from 36.6 percent in the same period of last year, according to a new report from Realtor.com. Still, Canada remains the top source of international buyers in the U.S.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Senada Ad\u017eem, who handles luxury listings and sales in Palm Beach County, said that currency fluctuations and trade war volatility are factors. She called it \u201cunusual\u201d that she is seeing an uptick in Canadian sellers and a decline in Canadian buyers, referring to the $10 million-plus market.\n\u201cWe all love our Canadian clients and friends. There is this perception that generally because of the trade negotiations that they\u2019re not as welcome in the U.S. There is this feeling on top of the actual financial and logical reasoning that they may decide to sell or not buy immediately,\u201d Ad\u017eem said. \u201cIt\u2019s also more difficult to get visas, and the cost of carrying properties in the U.S.\u00a0 has increased significantly.\u201d\nA high net worth client from Canada is in a \u201cholding pattern\u201d because of the Canadian dollar weakening, said Corcoran Group agent Mick Duchon. The Canadian dollar was worth 71 cents in U.S. currency on Monday afternoon.\n\u201c[Canadians] love being here. They love America, they are still interested in being here,\u201d Duchon said. \u201cThings very quickly got much higher priced for them. It\u2019s more of an economic concern.\u201d\nForeign flow\nAs Canadians pull back in South Florida, brokers told\nThe Real Deal\nthey\u2019re still seeing demand from other countries, like Colombia, Mexico, Brazil and buyers from European countries. Miami is still the top city with the most international views among top U.S. metros with 8.4 percent market share, according to the Realtor.com report. New York and Los Angeles followed.\nAs they have for years, condo developers in Miami\nare closely following relations\nbetween the U.S., Mexico and countries in Latin America. Michael Sadov, sales director at Okan Group\u2019s\nOkan Tower\n, which is under construction in downtown Miami, said about half of the project\u2019s buyers so far are foreign.\nColombian buyers make up a quarter of those deals. Mexican buyers are second in line. Sadov said he wrote a contract last weekend for a Venezuelan buyer \u2014 someone living in the U.S. with a business in Venezuela. Brazilian interest has also increased.\nHowever, Trump\u2019s positive relationships with foreign leaders are not translating to real estate purchases in Miami. The Trump administration\u2019s backing of Argentina\u2019s President Javier Milei and his party\u2019s victory in the recent midterm elections are encouraging Argentinians in Miami to take their money back to their home country, Sadov said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great the U.S. is making these alliances, but it\u2019s not translating to any kind of shift [to Miami],\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually having an adverse effect for our real estate market.\u201d\nContinued demand from buyers in the Northeast, California and the Midwest has\nhelped offset\nfluctuations in the foreign buyer pool, brokers said.\nDuchon said the buyer pool for high-end waterfront homes is still primarily American, and he is part of the majority who believe that will intensify if New York Rep. Zohran Mamdani\nwins the mayoral race\non Tuesday, which is expected.\n\u201cWe\u2019re anticipating a wave of new buyers to come into the market,\u201d Duchon said.\n",

        "content": "Two senior leaders at the\nWeingart Center Association\n, one of the largest homeless services nonprofits in Los Angeles, have been placed on leave amid an ongoing investigation into irregularities in its housing projects.\nWeingart president and CEO Kevin Murray,\u00a0 a former state senator, and Weingart real estate development director Ben Rosen have been put on leave while the nonprofit conducts an internal review, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\nThe company is looking into \u201ccertain\u201d homeless housing projects \u201cin light of recent reporting raising questions concerning the valuation,\u201d spokesperson Stefan Friedman said. The Weingart board appointed chief operating officer Tonja Boykin to lead the firm in the interim.\nThe inquiry comes after the outlet reported that Weingart\npaid $27.3 million for a Cheviot Hills nursing home last year\njust months after real estate executive Steven Taylor allegedly bought it for $11.2 million using falsified financial records.\nFederal authorities charged Taylor\nlast month with nine felonies in connection to the deal.\nInvestigators are looking into what Weingart and the city knew about the purchase, as the nonprofit had received $47 million in public funds, including $26.6 million from California\u2019s\nHomekey program\n, to convert the nursing home into supportive housing.\nAnother similar project is under the microscope.\nWeingart planned to buy a 122-room Extended Stay America in Torrance for $30 million with the help of state and local funds designated for housing homeless people and convert the property into supportive housing.\nBut the $30 million appraisal was believed to be way off, with experts pinning the value between $21.5 million and $22.7 million. An appraisal commissioned by Torrance officials determined the hotel\u2019s value was $10.2 million.\nFor that project, Weingart had sought $37.7 million in state Homekey+ funds, which helps pay for efforts to quickly house homeless people by converting hotels and motels into housing. Weingart ultimately decided not to move forward with the project following community pushback.\nThe company operates and develops housing sites across Los Angeles County and serves nearly 2,000 people daily.\nSam Josephs, an attorney representing Rosen, said his client welcomes the review.\n\u201cMr. Rosen is a career-long advocate of housing for people experiencing homelessness and is excited about, and welcomes, the opportunity to participate in Weingart\u2019s review to create the most robust internal controls to fulfill the mission of the Weingart Center, where he\u2019s served for more than seven years,\u201d Josephs said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Meanwhile, the number of signed contracts held steady year-over-year at 17.\nThe\nEklund Gomes report\ncounts properties listed at $4 million or more in the Multiple Listing Service.\nLast week\u2019s signed contracts were not the usual mega deals typical of Los Angeles\u2019 luxury market.\nA Malibu home at 28036 Sea Lane Drive was last week\u2019s top home to go into contract based on listing price.

Taylor and the other is linked to Taylor\u2019s son, Rob Taylor, and his wife Claudia Taylor. Rob and Claudia Taylor run Sea Lane Studios, a project management and design firm in Malibu.\nColdwell Banker Realty\u2019s Sadie Pollock Barish and the Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Trevor Wright hold the listing.\nThe over 4,000-square-foot Sea Lane Drive property sits in the ultra-exclusive neighborhood known as Billionaire\u2019s Bluff. It has its own private beach access, gardens, a saltwater pool and outdoor kitchen.\nThe gated property consists of a main house, guest house and separate studio structure.\nLos Angeles County\u2019s next largest home to go into contract, based on asking price, was in the nearby Pacific Palisades.\nThe property, located at 14148 Rustic Lane, is asking $10.4 million, or $2,371 per square foot.\nCompass\u2019 Diana Braun and Frank Langen are listing the property.\nProperty records show the sellers are a trust tied to Charles Corwin, film producer and CEO of content studio SK Global, and Olivia Corwin. The trust paid $9.3 million for the home in 2020.\nKnown as the Newman Residence, the property was designed in 1948 by Lloyd Wright and is the former home of Alfred Newman, an award-winning film composer.\nThe five-bed, four-bath home is 4,386 square feet sitting on nearly 1.5 acres.

The first, offering a potential teardown on a unique lot, sold in less than three weeks with no change to the asking price. The second, a bigger, newer build on a smaller lot, spent over 130 days on market and took a $775,000 price cut before selling.\nThe top deal was a three-bedroom, three-bathroom asking $6.5 million, or about $2,500 per square foot. The home at 2702 Valley Springs Road, a small drive that branches off Stratford, was built in 1964.\nPerched on a bluff, the 2,500-square-foot home commands an unobstructed view of the Austin skyline across the water.

Bassett Maguire inherited the home from Marjorie Maguire in 2010 and sold it to Rachel Maguire this January. Maguire\u2019s buyer hasn\u2019t been identified yet.\nIt went under contract in just 16 days, lightning fast, especially for this market. Austin luxury homes sell after an average of 90 days on market, making it one of the slowest luxury markets in the country, according to\nRedfin\n.\nThe second most-expensive home sold last week was just half a mile away, at 2505 Stratford Drive. The 5,000-square-foot home last asked $4.25 million, or about $800 per square foot.\nThe four-bedroom, four-bathroom home was listed for $5 million in June; the seller dropped the price on Oct. 12, according to Zillow.\nBuilt on half an acre in 2009, the contemporary glass-and-concrete home also boasts a view of downtown. Dave van Heuven, owner and broker of\nvan Heuven Properties\n, shared the listing with Deacon Shields of RA Residential.\nFinal sales prices aren\u2019t available for either deal.\n",

Tenants include textile designer Himatsingka and DKC Public Relations, and asking rents go up to $71 per square foot.\nFeil has been\nfaced with distress\nacross its 26-million-square-foot portfolio.\nPrivate equity giant KKR\u2019s securitized loan servicer, K-Star Asset Management, filed a foreclosure lawsuit in August alleging the landlord defaulted on debt tied to a four-story, 35,000-square-foot loft office building in the West Loop area in Chicago. The lender said Feil owed more than $8.2 million on the loan.\nIn Chicago, Feil already surrendered a similar loft office building in the River North district and is facing a lawsuit brought by special servicer\nRialto Capital for an alleged default on a $105 million CMBS loan\ntied to another office building and seeking either forbearance or another loan modification for a\n$75 million debt tied to the North Riverside Park Mall\nin suburban Chicago.\nBack in New York, Feil and its joint venture partners \u2014 BLDG and the Nakash Family \u2014\nstarted construction\non the conversion of a 14-story, 85,000-square-foot office building at 140 West 57th Street into 47 luxury condos; Deutsche Bank provided a $65 million construction loan for the project.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "After repeatedly refusing to reveal his position on the proposals, Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani said on Tuesday that he voted in favor of the controversial housing ballot measures.\nMamdani, before voting on Tuesday morning, confirmed that he planned to vote yes on the four housing ballot measures. City Council leaders and some of the city\u2019s most powerful labor unions oppose three of\nthose measures\n, which create faster approval processes for certain housing projects that bypass City Council review and an appeals board that could reverse the Council\u2019s rejection of projects.\nLater in the morning, he told WNYC\u2019s Brian Lehrer that the urgent need for more housing in the city guided his decision. He also, however, said he understood City Council\u2019s opposition to the measures, noting that they were guided by dedication to their communities. City Council leadership has said that the ballot measures would rob members of their ability to demand investments in their communities as a condition of rezonings.\nDuring the\nfinal mayoral debate\n, Mamdani said he had not yet taken a position on the measures, a refrain he repeated in the lead-up to the election.\nWhen asked Tuesday if he held off on announcing how he would vote to avoid alienating voters, Mamdani told Lehrer the timing reflected his desire to be \u201cintentional\u201d in deciding how to vote. He said he wanted to speak to various stakeholders and only announced his position once he made up his mind.\nStill, by holding off on voicing his support, Mamdani delayed drawing the ire of two unions that endorsed him, as well as City Council members he will need to work with if elected mayor.\nTwo unions that endorsed Mamdani, 32BJ SEIU and the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council, opposed the ballot measures, fearing that they would remove the City Council\u2019s ability to ensure union labor is hired on housing projects. A representative for HTC declined to comment, and a representative for 32BJ did not return a message seeking comment.\nThe City Council sent out ads warning voters that because of the ballot measures, their \u201cneighborhood essentials are at stake.\u201d\nWhile Democratic leaders in the Council presented a united front against the measures in the lead-up to the election, some City Council members have posted on social media that they support the changes.\n\u201cBallot proposals 2-5 are good,\u201d Manhattan Council member Shaun Abreu posted on his Instagram story Tuesday morning, referring to the housing ballot questions. \u201cThey hold more of your representatives accountable and make our growing city less hostile to the concept of more housing. That\u2019s why I voted yes.\u201d\nManhattan Council member Erik Bottcher posted on Instagram that he voted in favor of the measures. Brooklyn Council member Shahana Hanif\nreposted\nabout Mamdani voting yes on the measures, adding a saluting emoji.\nFormer Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent, supports the measures. Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa opposes the changes and told Lehrer on Tuesday that in supporting the measures, the other candidates are \u201chelping developers and realtors.\u201d\nAmit Singh Bagga, who leads Yes on Affordable Housing, a campaign that has spent more than\n$1 million\nto promote the measures, also voiced support for Mamadani Tuesday morning, saying that a vote for both Mamdani and the ballot measures will \u201cchange the course of our city\u2019s future.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Four years after scoring approval for a 354-unit luxury apartment tower in North Miami Beach, developer Celal Ozkan lost the site to the lender in bankruptcy court.\nAn affiliate of\nCEO Contract\n, led by Ozkan, will turn over the nearly 1-acre site at 16300 Northeast 19th Avenue to Miami Beach-based Safe Harbor Equity, which had provided an $8.5 million loan for the site in 2022, according to court records. CEO Contract has offices in Istanbul and New Castle, Delaware.\nFederal\nbankruptcy\ncourt Judge Laurel M. Isicoff in Miami approved the sale last week to Safe Harbor\u2019s distressed debt fund 3.\nA source familiar with the matter said the bankruptcy auction scheduled for Sept. 26 was canceled, likely due to a lack of qualified bidders. Bidders were supposed to offer at least $4.55 million for the site, according to court filings.\nThis marks the end of a yearslong, bitter feud between CEO Contract and\nSafe Harbor\n.\n\u201cThis is a fantastic property that we are excited to work with a developer to sell this asset,\u201d Chris Spuches, Safe Harbor\u2019s attorney, said, adding the firm won\u2019t be developing the property.\nAttorneys and representatives for CEO Contract didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\nCEO Contract, through its affiliate, Sky Gardens Residences, bought the vacant property in 2022 for $5.2 million. It scored\nfinal approval\nfor the 20-story apartment tower, to be called Sky Gardens Residences, with a rooftop garden and amenities in 2021, according to records. Construction never started.\nPlans took a turn beginning in 2022, when CEO Contract borrowed an $8.5 million loan with an 8.75 percent interest rate from Safe Harbor, with a one-year term and two six-month extension options, court records show. CEO Contract, its affiliates, Ozkan and Cagatay Emre Ozkan, COO of CEO Contract, were debt guarantors. Enforcement of their personal guarantees was only triggered in cases of fraud, misappropriation or diversion of the property, or other similar issues, according to CEO Contract\u2019s court filings.\nSafe Harbor alleged CEO Contract defaulted by failing to pay the August 2022 and January 2023 debt obligations by the due dates, according to court records. It also alleged that CEO Contract didn\u2019t timely pay the full taxes for 2022. Under a forbearance agreement in 2023, the pair worked out a deal for CEO Contract to pay down the principal to $7.7 million and extend the loan term.\nCEO Contract\u2019s Sky Gardens affiliate first sued Safe Harbor last year in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, accusing it of usury and manufacturing the default claims, according to court filings. It also disputed the amount it owes in property taxes and alleged that Safe Harbor pressured CEO Contract into the forbearance agreement and imposed a 2 percent extension fee on the original loan amount of $8.5 million, not on the lower balance of $7.7 million.\nAt one point, Safe Harbor allegedly tried to impose a retroactive default interest rate, which coupled with other fees amounted to more than the 25 percent maximum annual rate allowed in Florida, CEO Contract alleged in court filings.\nIn the lawsuit, CEO Contract called Safe Harbor a \u201cgreedy lender\u201d running a \u201cvicious campaign\u201d to take over the North Miami Beach site through a \u201c\u2018loan-to-own\u2019 scheme\u201d and \u201cimpairing\u201d the developer\u2019s ability to refinance.\nSafe Harbor responded with a countersuit for foreclosure, bringing up the default allegations and also alleging CEO Contract defaulted on the principal payment last year.\nIn January, CEO Contract filed for\nChapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization\n, which paused the dueling Miami-Dade Circuit Court lawsuits. An order for foreclosure was never issued in that case.\nThe property is appraised at $18 million, and the proposed project at buildout and lease-up is valued at $161 million, court filings say.\nThe property will be transferred free and clear from liens, except for a Miami-Dade tax lien for $114,000 for 2024 and 2025 property taxes, filings show.\n",

        "content": "Artificial intelligence startup Sierra, co-founded by\nOpenAI\nchairman and former\nSalesforce\nco-CEO Bret Taylor, is nearing one of the largest office leases of the year in San Francisco.\nThe enterprise-focused AI company has inked a deal for 300,000 square feet of offices at 185 Berry Street in China Basin, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. The building is owned by McCarthy Cook and Company and JPMorgan Chase.\nSierra was founded in 2023 by Taylor and former Google Labs head Clay Bavor; it was recently valued at $10 billion. The firm currently leases about 80,000 square feet at 235 Second Street in South of Market.\nLike other AI companies in the Bay Area and beyond, Sierra is in the midst of a growth spurt. The company currently has hundreds of employees and has plans to triple its head count down the line.\nThe China Basin complex at 185 Berry Street consists of two buildings on the edge of Mission Bay. Rideshare leader Lyft has its headquarters at China Basin, renewing its lease there last year while shaving down its footprint by more than half.\nIf Sierra closes its pending lease deal at the complex, it would be one of the biggest tech tenants in the city, ranking alongside AI giants OpenAI and Anthropic with office leases spanning six figures of square footage. Sierra\u2019s deal would be the biggest new lease in the city since OpenAI\u2019s 315,000-square-foot\nexpansion in Mission Bay\nlast year. At the top of this year, Google renewed its lease for 405,000 square feet at 345 Spear Street.\nLast month, Anthropic agreed to\nexpand its headquarters\nwith an additional 100,000 square feet at 505 Howard Street. OpenAI, meanwhile, is now\nturning its focus to Silicon Valley\nafter growing its headquarters operations in San Francisco; the Sam Altman-led firm is reportedly in the market for up to 500,000 square feet in the region, purportedly touring offices in Mountain View.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The 7,000-square-foot home sold for almost $643 per square foot.\nThey paid $3.65 million in 2012 \u2014 or $521 per square foot for the home. They listed it this spring after buying a 10-bedroom, 11,000-square-foot estate in unincorporated\nWinnetka\nonce owned by the late Chicago businessman\nAndrew McKenna\n.\nThe Cruzes paid $5.7 million, or $513 per square foot, for the McKenna property in June 2023. Their ownership via a land trust hadn\u2019t been previously reported.\nThe brick-and-limestone Lincoln Park house, built in 2010 on a 33-foot-wide lot and located at 2015 North Dayton Street, features seven bathrooms, multiple fireplaces, a four-stop elevator and designer finishes throughout.\nAmenities include a media room, wine cellar, gym and heated three-car garage. Outdoor spaces boast a bluestone patio with a fireplace and a 500-square-foot deck over the garage, with a pergola, pizza oven and retractable TV.\nThe Cruzes put the home on the market for $5 million before trimming the price to $4.85 million in May and finding a buyer three months later.

Ryan Preuett of Sotheby\u2019s International represented the sellers, and Danny Leung of Baird &amp; Wartner represented the buyers.\nCruz co-founded GoHealth in 2001 to build software for insurance brokers.

        "content": "The Eichner family\u2019s Continuum Company completed its bulk purchase of a waterfront condo building in North Miami where the firm plans a luxury condo tower.\nThe New York and North Bay Village-based development firm, led by Ian Bruce Eichner, paid $48.5 million for the four-story, 46-unit condo building at 12000 North Bayshore Drive, a spokesperson said. The developer previously secured approval to build a\n22-story, 267-unit condo building\n.\nContinuum plans to reveal project details and launch sales early next year, according to a press release.\nEichner, chairman and CEO of Continuum, said in a statement that the firm \u201cworked closely with the owners at Mariners Bay to consolidate the property through the condominium termination process.\u201d A termination of the association is a required legal step so a developer can eventually knock down the former condo building.\nIn October, CW Investment Advisers\nsued Continuum\nover the financing backing the buyout of Mariners Bay. CW alleges it\u2019s owed more than half a million dollars in fees tied to the sale, which was expected to close earlier this year.\nThe developer began negotiating with unit owners about three years ago and secured a rezoning of the property to allow for a 217-foot residential tower earlier this year. The association was facing \u201cmounting long-term deferred maintenance obligations and substantial special assessments,\u201d according to the release, which totaled $6.5 million in repairs, the South Florida Business Journal previously\nreported\n.\nAbout 1.5 acres of the property are submerged land in Biscayne Bay. The new project will have about 150,000 square feet of amenities, including a marina, water sports, golf and a health, wellness and social club. Kobi Karp Architecture and Interior Design is the project architect, Paul Duesing Partners will handle the interior design, and Martha Schwartz Partners is designing the landscaping.\nContinuum has a $3 billion, 1,000-unit condo portfolio in South Florida that includes planned projects in North Bay Village and Bay Harbor Islands.\nIn August, Continuum secured a\n$67 million construction loan\nfor the second phase of its Bay Harbor Islands condo project. The developer received the financing for La Baia North from S3 Capital Partners, a New York-based alternative lender that provides middle-market construction loans and bridge loans.\nThis summer, the development firm secured unanimous\napproval\nfrom the North Bay Village Commission for a special area plan, site plan and development agreement for the Continuum Waterfront District. The district is planned to have two Continuum condo towers, a 200-key Continuum hotel and a marina. One tower can now be up to 440 feet tall. The site includes the former Shuckers Waterfront Bar &amp; Grill, now called the Palm Tree Club.\n",

        "content": "The City of Beverly Hills is greenlighting builder\u2019s remedy projects after a\nbruising legal defeat\nfrom developers like Leo Pustilnikov.\nThe Beverly Hills Planning Commission approved a 19-story development for 145 Rodeo Drive proposed by Wilshire Rodeo Company, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n. The project applicant is tied to\nMax Netty of Soundview Investment Partners\n.\nThe firm plans just 30 units with one-, two- and three-bedroom residences above about 5,400 square feet of ground-floor retail. Six of the units would be set aside as deed-restricted affordable housing. The structure would rise about 237 feet above Rodeo Drive with designs by CARA Architecture.\nBeverly Hills\u2019 approval of the project comes after the city faced\nlegal tension from Netty\n, whose lawyer threatened to sue over the proposed development.\nIn addition to the Rodeo Drive development, commissioners also signed off on a builder\u2019s remedy project from Wilshire Skyline at 9229 Wilshire Boulevard.\nThat project involves a 14-story building with 116 studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom units including 24 affordable residences, a 60-key hotel, 7,300 square feet of ground-floor retail and subterranean parking for 140 vehicles.\nThe Planning Commission also voted to continue discussion of a\nproposed tower from Crescent Heights\nat 8844 Burton Way. That builder\u2019s remedy project calls for a 26-story, 200-unit building.\nLast month, prolific developer Leo Pustilnikov received approval for a builder\u2019s remedy project at\n125-129 South Linden Drive\n.

        "content": "A 211-acre master-planned community that could bring a surf park and $1.5 billion in development to Mustang Ridge, about 15 miles southeast of downtown Austin, is moving forward.\nThe Mustang Ridge City Council approved a development agreement with an affiliate of Austin-based SonWest Company last week, allowing the firm to advance infrastructure work on its long-gestating Pura Vida project, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe vote came after years of negotiations over water rights, state approvals and local entitlements in the small but fast-growing city of about 1,000 residents.\nSonWest partners Andy Bilger and Shawn Breedlove said construction could begin by late next year if market conditions hold. Early plans call for a multifamily, retail, restaurants, a hotel and civic space, plus a potential surf park that could span up to 30 acres.\nThe developers said they\u2019ve held talks with several surf park operators, including Surf Lakes Holdings, but have not finalized an agreement.\nSonWest, best known for building the 5,000-acre Sonterra community in Jarrell, has spent the past four years assembling land and negotiating infrastructure terms for the Mustang Ridge site, which sits off U.S. Highway 183 and FM 1327.\nThe property is across from a 1.2 million-square-foot industrial project under construction by Houston-based Clay Development &amp; Construction, including a building leased to a Tesla supplier.\nSonWest is footing the bill for tens of millions of dollars in new utilities for the project. The developer is coordinating with the Creedmoor Maha Water Supply District on a 30,000-foot water line and a new wastewater treatment facility capable of handling 3.3 million gallons per day.\nMustang Ridge\u2019s lack of infrastructure has long deterred large-scale projects, but city officials say Pura Vida could change that. Mayor David Bunn said the city expects \u201csignificant ancillary business\u201d from the development.\nThe agreement authorizes the city to consider financial incentives such as property tax abatements and sales and hotel tax rebates. Developers said they\u2019re already in talks with prospective multifamily and retail partners and are marketing sites to major anchors.\nWater use remains a point of contention. With Central Texas facing persistent drought, some residents have questioned the optics of building a surf park in the region.\nBilger countered that Pura Vida\u2019s system would rely on recycled and reclaimed water, not drinking water, and would use \u201cvery low volumes\u201d through a partnership with Austin-based VVater.\nThe Mustang Ridge project would add to the growing interest in lagoon- and surf-themed developments across Texas, including\niLand Development\u2019s\nproposed $1 billion Leander Springs project in the northwest Austin suburb of Leander; a $400 million lagoon project with a monorail iLand proposed in Marble Falls; and Discovery Land Company and Kelly Slater are already underway redeveloping a wavegarden lagoon near Austin in\nDel Valle\ninto a surf-and-condo community.\nSports Hospitality Ventures canceled plans recently for a Sports Illustrated Resort at the\nLago Mar Crystal Lagoon\nin Texas City outside of Houston. That project was announced in January 2024 and was to include a 200-room hotel, restaurant and beach club.\nAnother Houston-area lagoon-centered residential project launched in 2022, Dallas-based developer Megatel\u2019s $2 billion\nSaint Tropez\nnear Lake Houston, has completed its first phase.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Steven Roth opened Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s Election Day third-quarter earnings call with politics.\n\u201cThe election in New York City with the prospect of a Democrat socialist mayor has attracted enormous attention,\u201d Roth said. \u201cI\u2019m an optimist and believe that everything will work out for the best. Importantly, with respect to the prospect of a Mamdani mayoralty, we have not seen any pullback or hesitancy in space demand from our customers. In fact, the opposite.\u201d\nThe Vornado chairman and CEO stayed upbeat as he turned to the topic of real estate. Manhattan\u2019s office market has entered what he called \u201cthe third inning\u201d of a new growth cycle, with availability at Class A \u201cbetter buildings\u201d tightening rapidly. Roth said the market has flipped from favoring tenants to landlords.\nRevenue for the third quarter was $453.7 million, a 2.4 percent year-over-year increase. Net income for the first three quarters was $842 million, up from $7.1 million, due largely to the $1.6 billion master lease with NYU at 770 Broadway, which resulted in an $803 million gain.\n\u201cOur business is good \u2014 really good \u2014 and growing stronger,\u201d Roth said.\nVornado leased 3.7 million square feet through the first nine months of 2025, including 2.8 million in Manhattan. The REIT expects Manhattan office leasing volume to notch its highest year in over a decade and its second-highest year on record, Roth said. Excluding NYU\u2019s master lease at 770 Broadway, new Manhattan deals averaged $99 per square foot.\n\u201cTenant demand is robust,\u201d Roth said. \u201cCompanies are expanding, demand is broad-based across all industries and available space in the better buildings continues to evaporate quickly.\u201d\nThe firm\u2019s crown jewel \u2014 the Penn District \u2014 continues to outperform. Penn 2 is 78 percent leased and expected to surpass 80 percent by year-end. At Penn 1, Vornado has leased 1.6 million square feet since the start of its redevelopment in 2021, with average starting rents of $94, Roth said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the tipping point for the Penn District \u2014 our three-block-long city-within-a-city, is now behind us,\u201d Roth said.\nThe firm is in the planning stages for a 475-unit residential building at the northeast corner of\nWest 34th Street and Eighth Avenue\nwith construction slated to begin next year. It\u2019s also moving ahead with an overhaul of the \u201cjunky retail\u201d on both sides of Seventh Avenue and 34th Street into \u201cattractive, modern and exciting retail offerings,\u201d Roth said.\nRoth also said that Vornado is speaking with potential tenants for \u201csubstantial blocks of space\u201d at the old Hotel Pennsylvania site, known as Penn 15, which is expected to be office with some residential space. He didn\u2019t, however, reveal how far along those talks are or who might be interested.\nMeanwhile, Vornado is doubling down on Midtown with its acquisition of\n623 Fifth Avenue\n, a mostly vacant tower above the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship store that Roth called a \u201cblank slate\u201d for redevelopment into a \u201cvery best, elite\u201d boutique office building by the end of 2027. And its 1.8 million-square-foot\n350 Park Avenue\ntower with Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel remains on schedule to begin demolition next year, with tenant interest reportedly already emerging.\n\u201cWe\u2019re growing in New York \u2014 and we\u2019re growing smartly,\u201d Roth said.\n",

The tower is planned for 2.2 acres currently occupied by the church\u2019s school and parking lot. The church will remain intact and is expected to sell the site to the developers for\nabout $240 million\n.\n13th Floor\n, led by Arnaud Karsenti, and Key International, led by the Ardid family, are both based in Miami. They tapped Foster + Partners and Sieger Suarez Architects to design the waterfront tower, dubbed 619 Brickell. It will span 74 stories with 300 units, according to the press release. The building will have 90,000 square feet of amenities, including a pool, fitness center, spa facilities and a cafe. It will have a Nobu restaurant on the ground floor, making it the Miami area\u2019s second Nobu, after one in Miami Beach, the release shows.\nThe site is adjacent to the office tower at 701 Brickell Avenue, which Elliott Management bought for a near-record\n$443 million\nlast year.\nNobu Hospitality was founded by Chef Nobu Matsuhisa, actor and hotelier Robert De Niro, and producer Meir Teper. It is led by CEO Trevor Horwell and COO Struan McKenzie.\nThe firm has branded condos in Cabo, Mexico, and Toronto, Canada. It also has planned condos in Orlando; Punta Cana, Dominican Republic; Tulum, Mexico; Montenegro; Barbuda; Krak\u00f3w, Poland; Manchester, England; Amsterdam; Baku, Azerbaijan; Kuwait, Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia; Abu Dhabi and Al Marjan Island, United Arab Emirates; Cairo; Bangkok; and Da Nang, Viet Nam, according to its website.\nKarsenti and the Ardids both have other projects planned in Brickell.

The proceeds of the financing will go towards construction costs and the establishment of an interest reserve.\nA Meridian Capital Group led by Simon Rosenfeld and Ariel Taieb arranged the financing for the joint venture, which includes Pramukh Realty.\nBack in the spring of 2022, Irgang\nfiled plans\nwith the Department of Buildings to build an approximately 144,000-square-foot property. The 195-foot-tall building would feature 21 stories with 162 residential units.\nThe project has since expanded to 180 units, ranging from studios to two-bedroom apartments. The development will also include 17,000 square feet of commercial space and residential amenities such as a fitness center, a rooftop terrace and a library.\nCritically, the development is eligible for a 35-year tax abatement under the lapsed 421a program, according to Dwight Mortgage, because 30 percent of the units will be designated as affordable housing. The completion deadline to qualify for the tax abatement was pushed back to 2031 in last year\u2019s state budget.\nConstruction is expected to begin next year, according to Meridian; Irgang has owned the development site since 1991.\nA few months ago, Dwight Mortgage\nprovided a $155 million bridge loan\nto the Beitel Group to refinance a 405-unit rental complex at 261 and 315 Grand Concourse in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx. The refinancing provided a \u201csignificant cash-out\u201d to the developer, according to the Dwight Capital real estate investment trust affiliate.\nElsewhere in Harlem, Slate Property Group and Evenhar Development are\npursuing\na medical office and community facility property at 1578 Lexington Avenue, blocks from Mount Sinai\u2019s main campus.

Nexus has no lease on the buildings.\n\u201cThese were distressed properties,\u201d Mass said. \u201cWe know we can get them back up to a standard and continue operating them the way they should be operated by adding amenities, a fresher look.\u201d\nThe portfolio consists of the pair of two-story buildings at 8401 and 8461 Lake Worth Road near Wellington, completed in 2006 and 2007 on a 12-acre site; the one-story building at 2101 Vista Parkway near West Palm Beach, completed in 1989 on a 5-acre site; the two-story building at 20283 South State Road 7 near Boca Raton, completed in 1999 on a 2.5-acre site;\u00a0 and the two-story building at 1375 Gateway Boulevard in Boynton Beach, completed in 1991 on a 2.3-acre site, according to property records and TMT Properties. The only property in Martin County is the two-story building at 850 Northwest Federal Highway in Stuart, completed in 2004 on a 4-acre site.\nTMT Properties is a development and investment firm that also provides brokerage, property management and tenant build-out services, according to its website.\nIn past investments, TMT Properties paid\n$10.1 million\nfor a pair of Delray Beach office buildings at 190 and 200 Congress Park Drive in 2019. The deal was part of a 1031 exchange. In 2018, the firm paid\n$18.5 million\nfor the Shoppes At Loggers Run at 11411 West Palmetto Park Road near Boca Raton.\nIn January, CGI Merchant\u2019s loan on the buildings near Wellington and West Palm, and on the Stuart building entered special servicing due to\ndelinquent payments\n, Morningstar Credit shows. CGI Merchant\u2019s affiliates took out a $15.7 million refinancing on the properties in 2018 from Starwood Mortgage Capital, an affiliate of billionaire\nBarry Sternlicht\u2019s\nMiami Beach-based Starwood Capital Group. The loan has a balance of nearly $14 million, according to Morningstar Credit.\nRecords show this isn\u2019t the only financial trouble for the portfolio, with liens from the state and contractors, alleging unpaid bills.\nOn the buildings near Wellington, the Florida Department of Revenue filed four tax liens this year, most recently last month for $25,400, according to records. Separately, the Law Offices of James G. Gravera, a former tenant at the property, sued CGI Merchant\u2019s affiliate last year, alleging it didn\u2019t return the law firm\u2019s deposit for its lease after it left the building, according to the complaint. In January, a Palm Beach Circuit Court judge issued a default final judgment against CGI Merchant\u2019s entity for $8,596, including for the principal, attorney fees and 18 percent interest. Also, Highlight Reel Landscaping filed a lien for $8,100 for allegedly unpaid services at the property.\nAt the property near West Palm Beach, the Florida Department of Revenue filed three tax liens this year, including for $24,550 and $16,700 last month, records show. Highlight Reel Landscaping also filed a lien alleging $6,900 for unpaid work. In August, a Palm Beach Circuit Court judge awarded ProWaste USA a final judgment for nearly $4,600, or the amount CGI Merchant owed to ProWaste after the two reached a settlement on allegedly unpaid bills for waste services, according to records.\nThe Nexus properties near Boca Raton and in Boynton Beach also have state tax liens, records show.\nThe portfolio previously was slated to be sold to Santa Monica, California-based GBT Technologies, according to news releases and media reports. It\u2019s unclear why that deal was foiled. GBT didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nCGI Merchant\u2019s financial woes started early last year, when the firm defaulted on a\n$285 million\nloan on the Waldorf Astoria Washington DC, which the firm had bought from the Trump Organization for\n$375 million\nin 2022. Thomas, who got a 45-day postponement on the auction, tried to recapitalize, but lender BDT &amp; MSD Partners foreclosed last summer and took the property.\nCGI Merchant lost its 129-key Gabriel Downtown Miami hotel at the luxury Marquis condo tower at 1100 Biscayne Boulevard in Miami last year in a Uniform Commercial Code foreclosure auction. Lender Madison Realty Capital, which filed the UCC foreclosure over a\n$60.4 million\nloan, took over the property.\nIn July, Park Central Lender filed a foreclosure suit against CGI Merchant, alleging it defaulted on a\n$69 million\nloan on the 140-key Gabriel South Beach hotel at 620-650 Ocean Drive in Miami Beach. Park Central bought the loan from Deutsche Bank, which had filed a UCC foreclosure on the debt in 2023, postponing the auction several times.\nCGI Merchant\nlos\nt its five-story headquarters building at 3480 Main Highway in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove in February. Torose Equities, a Coconut Grove-based firm led by Scott Sherman, was the winning bidder in a UCC auction for the property.\nIn May, CGI Merchant staved off foreclosure on 65 commercial condo units at the Ten Aragon Condominium at 55 Miracle Mile in Coral Gables, selling the properties for\n$28.5 million\nto Miami Beach-based Elysee Investments, led by CEO Haim Yehezkel.\nThrough it all, Thomas has continued fighting to stop the bleeding, telling\nThe Real Deal\nin past interviews he is working to recapitalize his properties and secure equity partners.\n",

The buyer partially financed the purchase with a $40 million Wells Fargo loan.\nThe Carlyle affiliates own 66 percent, and Rutkovsky\u2019s entity owns 34 percent of Royal Eagle Plaza, the deed shows.

        "content": "Lincoln Property Company\npurchased a five-story Manhattan Beach office building on the Rosecrans Avenue corridor with multifamily redevelopment plans.\nThe Dallas-based firm paid $70 million, or $569 per square foot for the 123,000-square-foot building.\nThe seller is\nContinental Development Corporation\n; the firm\u2019s president of development, Alex Rose, signed the grant deed dated mid-October. The deal involved $45 million in seller financing, according to a deed of trust signed by Southern California Lincoln Property executive Rob Kane.\nBerkadia\u2019s Brett Betzler brokered the deal and said the offices will be demolished and replaced with apartments. Representatives for the buyer and seller did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Continental\u2019s Rose declined to comment.\nThe office property at 1500 Rosecrans Avenue is near Manhattan Village, a shopping mall, and many other retail spots and restaurants. It\u2019s part of a commercial center that spans parts of El Segundo and Manhattan Beach.\nThe Beach Cities office submarket, which encompasses Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach, has a 15 percent vacancy rate. That is lower than all of South Bay\u2019s 23.5 percent vacancy rate, according to CBRE \u2014 and far lower than downtown Los Angeles\u2019 33.3 percent, which has the lion\u2019s share of office distress.\nBut the average Manhattan Beach home value is $3 million, according to Zillow, and the average rent is $5,500 a month.\nThe deal is pricey: In South Bay, the most expensive office sale recorded in the third quarter was an $18 million trade in Carson, and the next was less than $10 million in El Segundo, per CBRE. Though those sold for $1,021 and $774 per square foot, respectively.\nFor context, Tishman Speyer\u2019s $205 million sale of the Maple Plaza building in Beverly Hills to Kilroy Realty, one of the year\u2019s biggest office deals, amounted to\n$707 per square foot\n.\nIt\u2019s the latest Lincoln Property office deal in Los Angeles. The firm\nsecured\na $197 million acquisition loan from Blackstone Group last year to finance its purchase of the Bluffs at Playa Vista, an office complex at 12181 Bluff Creek Drive.\nIt paid $187.5 million, or $375 per square foot, for that 500,000-square-foot campus, with no plans for a residential play.\u00a0However, the company\ntweaked\nits plans earlier this year for a mixed-use apartment complex in Culver City, nixing offices for more housing.\n",

        "content": "Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, has fallen behind on property taxes for his\nchildhood home\nin Chicago\u2019s South Shore neighborhood, adding to his recent real estate woes.\nHe bought the modest house in 2018 to save it from demolition.\nThe first-half property tax bill of $1,514, due March 4, hasn\u2019t been paid, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n, citing Cook County Treasurer records. The second installment, normally due Aug. 1, hasn\u2019t been mailed due to Cook County\ndelays\n.\nThe unpaid balance at 7815 South South Shore Drive is a drop in the bucket compared to the roughly $78 million in luxury real estate Ye once owned, but it hints at broader neglect across his\nfar-flung portfolio\n.\nOver the past two years, the artist\u2019s holdings \u2014 which once stretched from Malibu to Wyoming \u2014 have been plagued by unpaid bills, stalled projects and sharp devaluations.\nIn September, Ye sold his 6,700-acre Bighorn Mountain Ranch in Wyoming for $14 million \u2014 roughly half a million less than he paid in 2019.\nHis smaller Monster Lake Ranch, also in Wyoming, has been on and off the market for years without a reported sale.\nAnd in\nMalibu\n, a minimalist concrete mansion designed by Pritzker Prize\u2013winner\nTadao Ando\n\u2014 which Ye gutted after buying for $57 million in 2021 \u2014 sold last fall for $21 million, a staggering $36 million loss.\nCloser to Los Angeles, several of Ye\u2019s properties are in limbo. A $6.7 million Melrose Avenue commercial building purchased as Yeezy\u2019s future headquarters sits vacant. A Calabasas condo listed for $2.95 million reportedly has more than $60,000 in unpaid property taxes, and he\u2019s also marketing two other local parcels for a combined $3.5 million.\nThe South Shore house carries deep personal history for Ye: his mother, Donda West, bought it in 1981, and he lived there until he was a teenager. After a series of ownership changes and a foreclosure, Ye reacquired the home through an LLC from his longtime collaborator, Che \u201cRhymefest\u201d Smith, who had planned to convert it into an arts incubator called Donda\u2019s House.\nThe property shows signs of partial renovation \u2014 a new roof, siding, windows and a wrought-iron fence with \u201cDonda\u2019s House\u201d initials \u2014 but its current use is unclear. Whether Ye ever intended it as a residence, museum or symbolic gesture, the missed tax payment suggests the South Shore home has become just another loose end in an unraveling real estate empire.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "This week, I heard from an affordable housing developer who is increasingly worried about the federal government shutdown \u2014 food stamps and rental vouchers, in particular.\nNot only has the shutdown gone on longer than is typical, but the Trump administration has taken some seemingly discretionary actions to pressure Democrats to make a deal.\nUsually, the federal government tries to minimize the impact of shutdowns. But Donald Trump is not your usual president. He is always looking for leverage and is not a slave to political norms. As such, he has spoken openly about the shutdown giving him an opportunity to cut Democrats\u2019 favorite programs.\nThat\u2019s a problem for landlords who rely on Section 8 or whose tenants receive SNAP benefits, aka food stamps. I asked this developer about the expression, \u201cthe rent eats first.\u201d\nThe developer replied: \u201cPeople will definitely pay for food first before they pay rent. Wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\nYes. Hunger is immediate; rent is not. And I have learned \u2014 as many tenants did during the Covid moratoriums \u2014 that not paying rent doesn\u2019t mean you will be evicted anytime soon, if ever. Even without a lawyer, you can\nsquat for two years\nwithout paying.\nNot only that, but rent arrears are necessary to get a one-shot deal from the city, just as they were to get help from the state\u2019s Covid-era Emergency Rental Assistance Program.\nThat seems like an incentive not to pay, but other social programs work the same way. I recently helped a couple who\u2019d lost everything (except their house) pay the electric and gas bill \u2014 PSEG was threatening to cut off their service. But when I inquired about the utility\u2019s hardship program, I was told only customers in arrears are eligible.\nThe couple then applied for welfare but were rejected by New Jersey \u2014 because I had paid their bills. The lesson is clear: To get help from the safety net, you must be a deadbeat.\nBut I digress. Back to the developer, who had just read a Department of Housing and Urban Development press release in which HUD Secretary Scott Turner\nsaid\n, \u201cFor nearly one month, the Left has held our government hostage. Rather than ending this shutdown and putting our government back to work for the American people, they continue to shamelessly exploit Americans\u2019 pain for political gain.\u201d\nOnce upon a time \u2014 meaning 10 months ago \u2014 such a statement from an agency head would have been unthinkable.\nThe developer was disturbed.\n\u201cIf HUD stops paying, first repairs and maintenance will drastically suffer, then violations will pile up, then you will trip your debt covenants either by A) not maintaining the property or B) not servicing your loan. Or A and B.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nNissequogue River State Park is\nmarred by dozens of abandoned buildings\nfrom the old Kings Park Psychiatric Center, which closed 30 years ago. The 521-acre site was deemed parkland five years later, but the buildings remain because the state has higher priorities than to demolish them and execute\na plan\ncalling for playgrounds, concession stands, a farmers market, botanical garden and a museum. Should the state consider a public-private partnership instead? Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Insurance companies now pay more for\nsidewalk liability claims\nthan for fire- and water-related damages \u2014 the traditional top two insurance payouts. In response, carriers are issuing cancellation notices for properties with sidewalks they deem risky. At one time, the city was liable for mishaps caused by sidewalks it owns, but it was paying out so much money for alleged trip-and-falls that it made it the sidewalk owners\u2019 responsibility. It carved out an exception for owner-occupied residential properties of one to three units.\nElsewhere\u2026\nI don\u2019t wish ill on anyone. At the same time, I don\u2019t feel especially sorry for people who complain about\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s accurate coverage of their problems.\nA common sequence:\nThey love\nTRD\nwhen we cover the early successes that mark their arrival as real estate players.\nSomething goes wrong, and they complain when we cover it. A typical complaint is that it\u2019s not newsworthy and will be fixed immediately, so we should not run the story, or at least hold it until the problem is fixed.\nThe problem isn\u2019t fixed immediately.\nSimilar problems\nstart popping up\nat the complainer\u2019s other properties. We cover them, triggering more arguments that we are unfairly picking on this person.\nThe complainer begins to endure a wave of defaults,\nforeclosures\n, lawsuits and sometimes\nindictments\n.\nThe complaints to\nTRD\nstop, as the embattled businessperson realizes there are bigger issues to deal with than negative media coverage.\nWhat made me think of this? Could it have been the latest news about\nToby Moskovits\n?\nClosing time\nBecause of the election, there is no data to report today. Check back tomorrow to see the city\u2019s top closings and listings.",

        "content": "Cityview\nis looking to turn an office complex in Irvine into housing.\nThe Los Angeles-based firm has filed plans for a 422-unit residential building at the two-building Newport Summit office park at 19600 and 19700 Fairchild Road, the Orange County Business Journal\nreported\n. Newport Summit as it stands totals about 111,500 square feet.\nCityview acquired the property in March of this year from an affiliate of TPG Angelo Gordon for $34.5 million, or about $309 per square foot. New York-based TPG Angelo Gordon held a stake in the property since 2018. The office complex has traded hands at least seven times since 2007, with past owners including EQ Office,\nLincoln Property\n, Bixby Land Company and Maguire Properties, per CoStar data cited by the Business Journal. For the latest deal, Cityview got a $20.5 million loan from Banc of California.\nIn addition to the residences, Cityview is also looking to incorporate some retail along with the multifamily residential units. A timeline for the project has not been disclosed.\nIt\u2019s the latest residential project planned near the University of California, Irvine Health\u2019s new hospital on Jamboree Road. Uptown Newport, a mix of for-sale and rental units proposed by\nShopoff Realty Investments\n, is across Jamboree Road; that project is being built in phases and first opened for rentals about six years ago. The UCI Health\u2013Irvine complex\u2019s main hospital is slated to open for patients in December.\nOther housing projects are being considered for other nearby office sites in Irvine and\nNewport Beach\n. J+R Group, for example, has\nfiled plans\nto turn part of an eight-story, 178,000-square-foot office building at 1901 Main Street into 76 homes.\nIrvine Company, headquartered in Newport Beach, is\nlooking to build up to 2,500 new housing units near UCI\nin the nearby University Research Park. On the other side of town, the\nDonald Bren\n-led firm is planning to build 1,500 single-family homes and 1,600 apartments on the site of the\nOak Creek Golf Club\n; that plan calls for converting a nearby office complex into a school.\nThe City of Irvine must plan for 23,610 new homes by 2029 as part of its\nRegional Housing Needs Assessment\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "An Oregon investor is the latest to shop at the bottom of Chicago\u2019s battered office market, snapping up a Wacker Drive tower at a deep discount to its last sale.\nPortland-based Menashe Properties bought\n125 South Wacker Drive\nfrom Canada\u2019s La Caisse last week, Costar\nreported\n. La Caisse is the real estate arm of Quebec\u2019s largest pension fund.\nMenashe CEO Jordan Menashe declined to provide the selling price for the 547,000-square-foot building, but a person familiar with the deal told the outlet it was $51.5 million.\nThat would be $94 per square foot and a 65 percent drop from the $145 million that La Caisse, then operating as\nIvanho\u00e9 Cambridge\n, paid for the 31-story building in 2017.\nThe sale adds to a growing list of downtown office trades closing at fractions of pre-pandemic valuations, as investors bet on the sector\u2019s long-term recovery despite high vacancy, remote-work headwinds and expensive financing.\nFor Menashe, who entered Chicago\u2019s market two years ago, the purchase fits a pattern. His firm bought the nearby\n230 West Monroe\nStreet tower for $45 million in September 2023 \u2014 another sharp markdown that\u2019s since turned into a success story. That property, Menashe said, has been stabilized with about 50 new leases and renewals.\n\u201cThis is very similar to 230,\u201d Menashe told the outlet. \u201cIt\u2019s a pure lease-up play.\u201d\nMenashe said he plans to add eight to 10 move-in-ready spec suites to fill the roughly 37 percent of the Wacker building that remains vacant.\nWhile 125 South Wacker sits across from\nWillis Tower\n, it caters to smaller tenants occupying less than a full floor \u2014 a niche Menashe says is increasingly underserved.\n\u201cTake out ghost buildings that can\u2019t transact, and figure that nothing new will be built for five or six years, and we\u2019re under-officed,\u201d he said, arguing that constrained supply will eventually lift values.\nLa Caisse invested $21 million in renovations to 125 South Wacker during its ownership, upgrading mechanical systems, common areas and amenities. JLL began marketing the tower for sale in April.\nMenashe said he sees early signs of an office market recovery. A recent Costar analysis projects U.S. office occupancy to rise by 10 million square feet over the next year \u2014 a reversal from earlier expectations of decline.\n\u201cPeople went from office curious to office serious,\u201d Menashe said. \u201cThat goes for everywhere from Chicago to Portland. The word is out \u2014 and that will push prices up.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Instead, buyers are finding other ways to connect with sellers to test compliance with\nfair housing\nlaws, though correspondence could still be an option in some cases.\n\u201cIn lieu of the letter, we\u2019re able to, in an above-board way, communicate a little bit about the buyer,\u201d Alexander Lurie of City Real Estate said. \u201cWe just need to be thoughtful about how we communicate those things.\u201d\nFive years ago, the\nCalifornia Association of Realtors\nfirst advised sellers\u2019 agents not to take buyers\u2019 love letters because of potential unconscious bias toward legally protected groups. What could be a simple letter describing a family or romantic situation may instead open a door to discrimination.\n\u201cAs lawyers, it\u2019s our job to be paranoid and worry about these things,\u201d Gov Hutchinson, CAR\u2019s assistant general counsel, said.\nNow, CAR advises agents to not accept offers that come with a love letter; in fact, they are told to get ahead of it before any come in by announcing that none will be accepted. Sellers and their agents are largely following the guidance.\n\u201cSo much of what happens with offers is about communication and relationships, and the last thing I want to do is alienate the listing agent by giving them a letter they don\u2019t want,\u201d Jodi Nishimura of Kai Real Estate said.\nThat\u2019s not to say the love letter has completely fizzled. In fact, in some situations, sharing some personal information with listing agents has proven to help buyers seal the deal. \u201cThose things happen, not as often, but they do happen,\u201d\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Sereno\nagent Colin Halliday said.\nStill, buyers are advised to stay away from sharing personal anecdotes with sellers to avoid jeopardizing potential sales, even if unconscious bias on the part of the seller would violate fair housing laws.\n\u201cSellers like to envision who\u2019s buying this house that they like so much and put so much effort into,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cBut also, sellers, consciously or subconsciously, probably tend to favor people who are like them. That\u2019s the risk.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Financial terms weren\u2019t disclosed, but the 20-person Cooper Robertson team will merge into Corgan\u2019s 1,200-strong workforce while maintaining its office in New York\u2019s Financial District.\nFounded in Dallas in 1938,\nCorgan\nis best known for designing headquarters for Toyota, State Farm and 7-Eleven, and more recently, space for hospitals and data centers. It occupies about 110,000 square feet at The Luminary in downtown Dallas\u2019 West End and reported $510.5 million in revenue last year, with roughly three-quarters generated locally, according to the outlet.\nCooper Robertson, meanwhile, has long been a fixture in New York\u2019s cultural and urban landscape.

A retail village with 80,000 square feet for up to eight restaurants, a 317-unit apartment complex and office space are also part of the phase-two plans.\nConstruction financing comes from Madison Realty Capital, while Citizens Bank, Amegy Bank and others are backing the apartment and retail components.\nThe Birdsall will feature 44 condos above a 105-key hotel, topped by resident amenities including a pool, outdoor entertainment deck, fitness and wellness spaces and a members-only club.\nDesigned by New York-based Kohn Pedersen Fox with interiors by Roman &amp; Williams and Dillon Kyle Architects, the tower nods to River Oaks\u2019 architectural heritage \u2014 its name honoring early Houston architect Birdsall Briscoe. Auberge will operate and manage the hotel and residences.\nThe RO\u2019s design team reads like a who\u2019s who of top architecture firms:\nPickard Chilton\nis master planner and design architect for the office and multifamily components;\nMichael Hsu Office of Architecture\nis handling the retail design; and\nOJB Landscape Architecture\nwill shape the green spaces.\nPhase One\n\u2014 a 145,000-square-foot office tower fully leased to energy trader Vitol \u2014 is nearing its top-out and scheduled for occupancy next summer. The new phase, totaling roughly 740,000 square feet, is slated for delivery in late 2027.\nThe RO\u2019s mix of materials, including brick facades, cobblestone walkways and heritage oaks, is designed to feel like an extension of River Oaks rather than a new urban district, Transwestern executives said. Retail leasing, led by Transwestern, has drawn strong early interest from restaurant and boutique operators.\nThe RO site once housed ExxonMobil\u2019s upstream division.\nTranswestern is a commercial real estate firm that includes Transwestern Development Company, Transwestern Investment Group and Transwestern Real Estate Services. While most of its holdings are in Texas, its portfolio includes property all over the country.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "For the first time in a long time, Miami\u2019s next mayor won\u2019t be a member of a familial political dynasty.\nOn Tuesday, former Miami-Dade County commissioner Eileen Higgins and ex-Miami City Manager Emilio Gonzalez won first and second place, respectively, in\nMiami\u2019s mayoral election\n. However, Higgins did not capture more than 50 percent of the vote to avoid a runoff.\nThe race featured 13 candidates, but the real drama involved three contenders whose families have lorded over Miami politics since the 1980s. City commissioner\nJoe Carollo\n, who returned to city hall in 2017 after serving two terms as mayor from 1998 to 2001, mustered only 12 percent of the vote in his latest bid for Miami\u2019s top elected post. Carollo raised nearly $1 million, with many big name real estate players financially backing him.\nXavier Suarez, another former Miami mayor and father of the current mayor,\nFrancis Suarez\n; and Alex Diaz de la Portilla, an ex-city commissioner who was removed from office in 2023, each garnered 5 percent of the vote. Diaz de la Portilla is a former state legislator whose brothers Renier Diaz de la Portilla and Miguel Diaz de la Portilla also served stints as county and state elected officials.\nCarollo\u2019s political action committee, Miami First, relied heavily on real estate industry contributions, despite a federal jury slapping Carollo with a\n$63 million\njudgment after finding him guilty of violating the rights of Little Havana developers\nBill Fuller\nand Martin Pinilla. Entities controlled by JDS Development Group\u2019s\nMichael Stern\ndonated a combined $125,000 to Miami First. Stern\u2019s firm is developing a Dolce &amp; Gabbana-branded condo-hotel in Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood.\nEntities managed by Nuri Dorra, who is co-developing Essence Miami, a multifamily project with 88 affordable and workforce housing apartments in Little Havana, contributed a combined $120,000 to Miami First.\nDiaz de la Portilla\u2019s biggest support came from real estate investors\nDavid and Leila Centner\n. The Miami Beach power couple donated $100,000 to Diaz de la Portilla\u2019s political action committee, Proven Leadership for Miami-Dade County. The contribution represented nearly half of the committee\u2019s haul in the three months ended in June. The PAC reported zero contributions between July and September, the most recent campaign finance filing period.\nMeanwhile, Vlad Doronin\u2019s\nOKO Group\nand Blanca Commercial Real Estate each contributed $10,000 to Suarez\u2019s Imagine Miami PAC.\nHiggins resigned from her county commission seat less than a year after being reelected without opposition to run for Miami mayor. Her individual campaign and three political action committees supporting her collected five-figure donations from several prominent developers.\nDavid Martin\u2019s Coconut Grove-based\nTerra\ncontributed a combined $67,500, and\nRelated Group\n, also based in Coconut Grove and led by Jorge, Nick and Jon Paul P\u00e9rez, donated a combined $50,000. Swerdlow Group, led by Michael Swerdlow, Craig Robins\u2019 Miami-based Dacra, and land use law firm Bercow Radell Fernandez Larkin &amp; Tapanes each gave $10,000 to committees backing Higgins. Arnaud Karsenti, managing principal of 13th Floor Investments, donated $2,500.\n13th Floor Investments, Terra, Swerdlow Group and Bercow Radell also gave money to Carollo\u2019s Miami First PAC. Swerdlow contributed $50,000, 13th Floor donated $25,000, Bercow and Radell kicked in $10,000 and Terra chipped in $2,500.\nGonzalez, who testified against Carollo in the civil case brought by Fuller and Pinilla, successfully sued the city of Miami to hold the election this year, alleging city leaders violated the city charter in approving a delay of the election until next year. Six entities tied to Fuller and Pinilla donated a combined $20,000 to Gonzalez\u2019s Mission Miami PAC.\nKen Russell, a former city commissioner who was among the 13 mayoral candidates, placed third. His PAC, Breaking The Wheel, received a $10,000 donation from Miami-based CMC Group, led by Ugo Columbo.",

        "content": "A development site straddling the border between Queens and Brooklyn sold this week, but that\u2019s where the answers end and the questions begin.\nRenald Properties sold a seven-lot assemblage at the intersection of Myrtle and Wyckoff avenues for $37 million, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The 71,000-square-foot site is technically in Ridgewood, but is nearly adjacent to Bushwick.\nThe buyer was not revealed, but the price point represented one of the year\u2019s biggest deals in the area, according to the transaction brokers.\nThe site comprises 21 retail businesses, including an autobody shop, a department store and a McDonald\u2019s. The buyer would need to clear the businesses to make way for a development, in whatever form such a project takes shape.\nAnd there are options. The site allows for development up to 339,000 square feet large. Almost half of that could be put aside for residential use. But the mystery buyer has not filed any construction permits, adding to the site\u2019s intrigue. The population of the two neighborhoods have exploded in recent decades, creating a need for more housing.\nIn September, the average rent in Queens declined by a couple of cups of coffee compared to the prior month, landing at $3,051, according to\nMNS Real Estate\n. Ridgewood was in the middle of the pack in terms of prices across the borough\u2019s neighborhoods, sporting an average of $2,599 for studios and $2,857 for one-bedroom units.\nBrooklyn\n\u2019s average rent in September also fell to $3,932, down nearly 1 percent from August. Bushwick proved to be one of the borough\u2019s more affordable rental environments, recording an average of $2,638 for studios and $3,178 for one-bedroom apartments.\nAvison Young\u2019s Erik Edeen, Pat Madigan and Fritz Richter represented the seller.\n\u201cThis nearly full-block assemblage will be transformed to deliver mixed-income housing and refreshed retail space along a highly trafficked corridor as demand for housing continues to increase in Bushwick and Ridgewood,\u201d Madigan said in a statement.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Miami Beach voters propelled Mayor Steven Meiner and city commissioner Laura Dominguez to second terms, while two candidates vying for an open city commission seat are headed to a runoff.\nMeiner\ncaptured 51 percent of the vote, beating his lone challenger, city commissioner Kristen Rosen Gonzalez, by about 350 ballots, election results show. Dominguez thumped her opponent, spec home developer\nFred Karlton\n. She garnered more than 60 percent of the vote, despite a campaign by Karlton and city commissioner David Suarez to paint her as beholden to real estate developers in the city. Another city commissioner, Alex Fernandez, also won by a wide margin, capturing 84 percent of the vote against his opponent, Luidgi Mary.\nThe race for the city commission seat vacated by\nRosen Gonzalez\nwill be decided next month in a runoff between former city commission aide Monica Matteo-Salinas, who picked up 23 percent of the vote, and attorney Monique Pardo Pope, who landed in second place with 20 percent of the vote. But Pardo Pope led hotel investor Brian Ehrlich by less than a percentage point. If the margin drops to less than 0.5 percent, it would trigger an automatic recount.\nMeiner\nalso bested Rosen Gonzalez in garnering financial support from the city\u2019s real estate and hospitality industries. Players backing the mayor included Lennar co-CEO Stuart Miller, who lives in Miami Beach. Miller donated $50,000 to Meiner\u2019s political action committee Miami Beach First.\nThe PAC also racked up $25,000 from real estate investor and Miami Beach resident Michael Simkins; $20,000 from David Grutman, founder of Miami Beach-based Groot Hospitality; $18,000 from Alex Kleyner, another Miami Beach-based real estate investor; and $10,000 each from Miami Beach developer Scott Robins and New York-based Naftali Group, led by Miki Naftali.\nIn the race between\nDominguez\nand Karlton, real estate and hospitality players lined up behind the incumbent. Karlton bankrolled his own campaign by donating $150,000 to it.\nDominguez\u2019s individual campaign saw many real estate and hospitality bigwigs donating the maximum $1,000 each, including developer Michael Shvo; Jose and Diego Ardid, developers who lead Miami-based Key International; New York-based LeFrak Organization\u2019s managing director James LeFrak and a LeFrak affiliate; and two executives with Vlad Doronin\u2019s OKO Group.\nDuring the campaign, Karlton and commissioner Suarez attacked Dominguez by claiming she voted on legislation that benefitted developers that bankrolled her political action committee, Coastal Communities Matter, when she first ran in a 2022 special election. Dominguez did not raise funds through her committee for this year\u2019s election.\nIn the city commission race headed to a runoff, Ehrlich was the candidate backed by real estate and hospitality interests. His individual campaign received the maximum $1,000 donation from Arnaud Karsenti, managing principal of Coconut Grove-based development firm 13th Floor Investments, his wife Rebecca Karsenti, the Catalina Hotel at 1732 Collins Avenue, and two entities managed by Miami Beach-based real estate investor Jimmy Resnick.\nEhrlich\u2019s PAC, Miami Beach in Focus, got $25,000 from hotelier Shawn Vardi, and $5,000 from Christopher Cuomo, ex-COO of Groot Hospitality.",

The district turned out for President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election by a\nnearly 60-point margin\n.\nRehmet, an Air Force veteran and union president, is the only candidate left standing who is open to casinos in a race where Sands Casino threw millions of dollars behind a Republican who was knocked out in Tuesday\u2019s special election.\nRehmet is headed for a runoff with conservative Republican Leigh Wambsganss, who is staunchly\nanti-casino\nand spent the campaign engaging in a war of words with Republican challenger John Huffman, the former mayor of Southlake. Wambsganss had 36 percent of early voting, and Huffman had 16 percent.\nSands donated $1 million directly to Huffman\u2019s campaign and spent $2 million to advertise on his behalf.\nSands wants to build casino resorts in Texas, and it is flexing all of its muscles after buying the Dallas Mavericks and 200 acres adjacent to the Texas Stadium site in Irving in recent years.\nThe company, controlled by Miriam Adelson and Patrick Dumont, rezoned a 182-acre tract in March, though a\ncasino component was removed\nafter public backlash.\nAdelson is a major donor to President Donald Trump, giving his campaign\n$100 million\nlast year. Will the Israeli-American magnate cross party lines and endorse a pro-casino Democrat?\nWambsganss, who is chief communications officer for Christian wireless provider Patriot Mobile, is backed by Lt.

Nate Schatzline, who withdrew from the race after Wambsganss entered it.\nEven without the casino intrigue, it was an unusual ballot.\nTwo Republicans were pitted against a Democrat in the special election to replace Republican Kelly Hancock, who resigned to become acting state comptroller after holding the seat since 2013. No primary election was required.\nIf no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote, the two top vote-getters will head to a runoff election on Dec. 13.\n",

Nazarian\u2019s partners include Grammy-winning artist\nMarc Anthony\n.\nThe development team, including the Boschetti family\u2019s South Miami-based firm and Eduardo Otaola\u2019s Coral Gables-based Constellation, tapped Mauricio Umansky and Santiago Arana\u2019s\nThe Agency\nto lead sales and marketing.\nThe project will add to a growing pipeline of condo and apartment towers in Edgewater.\nNazarian\n, chairman and CEO of Beverly Hills-based sbe, told\nTRD\nin an interview that the project will fill a gap in Miami between the short-term rental-friendly condo projects that are less expensive and the $3 million-plus condos.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of luxury residential projects today. One thing we saw was there was a lack of personality and connectivity and collaboration in these towers,\u201d he said.\nCamilo Lopez, managing partner and co-CEO of Coral Gables-based\nBlack Salmon\n, said he interviewed more than 10 brands before choosing HQ.\nLopez said nearly 65 projects are in the pipeline in Greater Downtown Miami, and a majority of those are short-term rental-friendly condo projects. HQ Residences will be a traditional condo building with prices that start at $850,000 and average $1.5 million, Lopez said.\nNazarian and Lopez said the project aims to appeal to Millennials and Gen Zers, and Latino/Hispanic buyers. Units will range from one to three bedrooms and from 721 square feet to 2,074 square feet, according to a press release. The project will also have eight penthouses.\n\u201cOne of the biggest challenges in Miami is the entry level [price] is becoming extremely high,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cThis opportunity to design this product in this price point makes sense.\u201d\nThe building will mark the first residential tower branded by HQ, a hotel brand that Nazarian launched last year. Anthony will be involved in the Miami project and future branded residential developments.\n\u201c[Marc] is somebody who is the face of Miami,\u201d Nazarian said. \u201cHaving him be a validator for the largest buyers of residential, the Hispanic and Latino market, it\u2019s very exciting for me to partner with Marc and bring him into his first residential project in South Florida.\u201d\nConstruction could begin by September of next year, and it will take about 30 months to complete, Lopez said.

The asking rent was $125 per square foot.\nCurrent is relocating from RXR\u2019s 620 Sixth Avenue, where it leased about 72,000 square feet in 2023,\nCommercial Observer\nreported. A Current spokesperson declined to comment on the new lease.\nThe deal adds to Vornado\u2019s momentum at the Penn District, where chairman and CEO Steven Roth declared yesterday in an earnings call that \u201cit\u2019s clear that the tipping point \u2026 is now behind us.\u201d Penn 2 recently underwent a $750 renovation aimed at attracting blue-chip tenants. The 31-story tower is now 78 percent leased.\nCurrent Real Estate Advisors\u2019 Adam Hennick and Rob Kluge represented Current in the deal. Vornado was represented in-house by Josh Glick and Jared Silverman, along with a Cushman &amp; Wakefield team led by Bruce Mosler and Josh Kuriloff.\nThe deal comes as the office market shows signs of stabilizing and Manhattan\u2019s Class A towers are quickly filling up. The Penn Station submarket\u2019s vacancy rate was about 19 percent at the end of the third quarter, compared with the borough\u2019s overall rate of 22 percent, according to a Cushman &amp; Wakefield report.\nThe lease adds to a string of recent deals at Penn 2, as tenants continue to gravitate toward newly renovated properties near mass transit. Communications and consulting firm\nFGS Global\njust signed a 15-year lease for 80,000 square feet at Penn 2. Last summer, Verizon inked a\n200,000-square-foot lease\nwith plans to move its headquarters to the 1.8 million-square-foot building, formerly known as 2 Penn Plaza.\nOther tenants include Madison Square Garden\u2019s corporate offices,\nMajor League Soccer\nand\nUniversal Music Group\n.\n",

        "content": "One culprit of the housing crisis was overlooked in this mayoral campaign: the Landmarks Preservation Commission.\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like\nMayor-elect Zohran Mamdani\nor many other politicians are even aware of the issue.\nI\u2019m not just talking about NIMBY groups trying to get properties designated as landmarks to block housing that would replace them, or pressuring the commission to reject\nprojects that would replace parking lots\nor\ndeteriorated churches\nin historic districts.\nI\u2019m talking about the everyday struggles between property owners and the landmarks agency \u2014 the kind of fights that never make headlines.\nA recent social media post from frustrated developer Eli Lever cited an example. After waiting months for the notoriously anal landmarks agency to decide which color mortar it would allow for a brick facade, he\ntweeted a photo\nof the three choices facing the commission:\nI\u2019d probably go with the middle one. But it doesn\u2019t really matter. The point is, none of these mortar colors is going to destroy the historic look of the building. The highly trained preservationists at the LPC should have been able to pick one in 60 seconds, not 60 days.\nThe agency thinks it\u2019s protecting historic districts by being painstakingly thorough and exacting, but the opposite is true. Because it is so slow, and makes work two or three times more expensive and time-consuming, property owners often do things without getting LPC approval as required.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why if you walk around in a historic district, you often notice minor repairs obviously not done to LPC standards,\u201d Lever noted in an email to\nThe Real Deal\n. The result of the commission\u2019s overzealousness may well be less historic preservation, not more.\nBut the bigger problem for New Yorkers seeking affordability \u2014 like Mamdani \u2014 is that by making construction and renovation more expensive, the city ends up with less housing than it would otherwise have. That\u2019s a basic rule of economics.\nI asked Lever if it would have been cheaper to just pick a mortar color and proceed without the agency\u2019s blessing, paying a fine as needed. Not an option, he said. For renovations requiring building permits, LPC approval is essential.\n\u201cThis is where the wait can be a killer, but there isn\u2019t really a choice,\u201d Lever said. \u201cDoing a job without permits opens up a whole host of issues, over and above the LPC violation.\u201d\nThe people hired by Landmarks to enforce its standards have a lot of expertise about what buildings looked like a century or two ago, or at least the motivation to research and apply 19th-century standards to today\u2019s owners and contractors.\nWhat they appear to lack is any appreciation of how their decisions \u2014 and the time it takes to make them \u2014 affect the real estate industry and everyday New Yorkers.\nStaffers are surely aware that\nlandmarking has its critics\n. But art history majors with graduate degrees in historic preservation inevitably view applications through the lens of their education, not think-tank reports and the odd online gripe by a developer. \u201cPreservationists really struggle with change,\u201d a former LPC staffer\ntold Brooklyn Magazine\n.\nI\u2019m not saying the city should trash the landmarks system, although there is a case to be made for that. I am saying that when choices involve benefits and costs, both should be considered.\nIt can\u2019t just be \u201cit costs what it costs\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019ll take as long as we need to make a decision.\u201d\nI would suggest the City Council apply a builder\u2019s remedy to Landmarks: If the agency doesn\u2019t decide on an application in X number of days, it is automatically approved. I guarantee that timely decisions would immediately become the norm. LPC would lobby for more staff but would ultimately adjust its methods to meet the deadlines.\nMy second reform would be to stop designating new historic districts. We have enough.\nBy definition, any buildings left standing long enough become historic. Taken to its logical conclusion, the entire city will eventually be landmarked.\nNew York is not Pompeii. The city should not be frozen in time.\nTo see the effects of landmarking on housing development, one need only look at the\nSoho/Noho rezoning\nof 2021.\nIt was supposed to create thousands of units. But developers are\navoiding the historic portion\nof the rezoned area as if it were a toxic waste dump. Building there would mean competing with projects that cost less \u2014 an uphill, if not futile, battle.\nSome buyers and renters will pay extra to be in a new development built to LPC\u2019s specifications, but perhaps not enough to make a project pencil out. And keep in mind that affordable units, which are required in rezoned areas and in 485x projects, cannot charge a premium.\nWe are leaving housing on the table \u2014 in high-opportunity neighborhoods, no less.\nLandmarking was a nice idea, but it has reached the point of diminishing returns. The benefits of more landmarking do not outweigh the drawbacks. The main thing Landmarks is preserving now is the housing shortage.\nAbout 20 percent of Manhattan, which has the city\u2019s densest zoning and the most investment in transit, is now subject to the strict scrutiny of the LPC. Continuing this way would be a historic mistake.\n",
