        "content": "A federal judge in New Jersey sentenced Moshe Silber to 30 months in prison for his involvement in a\nbroad mortgage fraud scandal\n.\nSilber\n, 35, had turned himself in three weeks ago for violating the terms of his bond. He faced up to five years after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mortgage fraud in 2024.\nThe U.S. district court judge, Robert Kirsch, repeatedly said that Silber had committed a \u201csignificant crime\u201d and a \u201csignificant sentence was necessary.\u201d Silber, a co-conspirator of Boruch Drillman, had teamed up to buy an Ohio apartment building, the Department of Justice said. The group picked up the building, called the Williamsburg of Cincinnati, for $70 million, using a stolen identity, then flipped it to Drillman for $96 million, receiving a $74 million loan based on the second, inflated price.\nKirsch noted he deemed the fraud significant because of the \u201clayers and labyrinth of chicanery.\u201d\nThe sentence is shorter than another one Kirsch handed out in the scandal:\u00a0 Aron Puretz, who pleaded guilty last year to one count of wire fraud, got\n60 months\n, though his son, Chaim \u201cEli\u201d Puretz, only\ngot 24.\n\nSilber showed up to the packed court handcuffed, wearing a green jumpsuit with a white undershirt. Dozens of members of\nhis community\nwere present. Women read prayer books and cried during the course of the two-hour hearing.\nIn a surprise twist,\nMark Nussbaum\n\u2014\u00a0a lawyer who\nshuttered his firm\nin January and is the subject of several civil lawsuits over missing escrow funds \u2014\u00a0showed up to court wearing gold-rim glasses, a modern blazer and tight black pants. He sat with Silber\u2019s family and friends.\nAs the judge was reading Silber\u2019s sentencing, Nussbaum\u2019s phone went off, and security asked him to leave. (He returned to the courtroom at the end of the hearing.)\nKirsch observed that Silber had\nlived the American dream\n, with cars and jewelry worth $2.2 million, but still decided to commit fraud. He also noted how Silber had an annual salary of over $3 million from his father and from someone named Mr. Hoffman, yet claimed to be \u201cin the red\u201d financially.\n",

The buyer\u2019s identity had been hidden behind an LLC, which was signed for by Zalman Gottlieb.\nGottlieb is the financial controller for B&amp;H. Representatives for B&amp;H and Brookfield did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe sale of the 287,000-square-foot office property works out to $523 per square foot.\nIt\u2019s not clear what the new owner has planned for the 287,000-square-foot building, which is located around the corner from B&amp;H\u2019s iconic store at 420 Ninth Avenue. The retailer was previously reported to have\nexecutive offices at 440 Ninth Avenue\n.\n\nThe tenants at 333 West 34th Street include the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Sam Ash Music and Godiva Chocolatier. The MTA leases at least 100,000 square feet on a lease that isn\u2019t set to expire until 2035, according to\nCompStak\n.\nB&amp;H originally opened in Tribeca in 1973 and moved into its current store in 1997. The property is owned by the Kibel Company, which purchased it in 1994, according to property records.\nKnown as the Smith Barney Building, 333 West 34th Street was developed in 1954. SL Green bought the property in 2007 for $184 million and reportedly invested about $26 million worth into it. SL Green sold it to Nicholas Schorsch\u2019s American Realty Capital New York Recovery REIT in 2013 for $220 million.\nThe owner changed its name to New York REIT and then eventually went into liquidation, selling the property to Brookfield.\nThe West Side of Manhattan on 34th Street saw a surge of investment as the Related Companies\u2019 Hudson Yards and Brookfield\u2019s Manhattan West started to rise.\n",

The sale marks 10 percent off the initial price Gregg and his wife, Lisa, sought when it listed in June.\nThe couple purchased the eighth-floor unit in 2005 for $2.4 million.\nThe buyers were Elliott Investment Management partner Jason Genrich and his wife Sara, an attorney.\nThe five-bedroom, five-and-a-half bathroom home on East 82nd Street in the Upper East Side features a living room with a decorative fireplace, a primary suite with two bathrooms and two dressing rooms and a kitchen with a china closet. Two storage units were also included in the deal.\nGregg and Lisa listed the property in June for $12 million, eager to sell the unit at the prewar property as they continue to wind through a divorce battle that started almost five years ago.\n\nA Sotheby\u2019s International Realty team including Juliette Janssens had the\nco-op listing\n.\nRechler Equity, run by Gregg and cousin Mitchell Rechler, went public in 1995 and emerged as one of the tri-state area\u2019s largest real estate investment trusts. Eight years later, the company spun off its Long Island properties into Rechler Equity, an entity with roughly 7 million square feet in the portfolio today.\nRechler Equity is\nshopping the Hampton Business District\nin Westhampton Beach, a five-building, 385,000-square-foot industrial park. Bidding for the campus is expected to top $200 million, which would easily shatter Long Island\u2019s industrial sale record.\nElsewhere on the Upper East Side this week, Allen Simon \u2014 the inventor of the Wee Wee Pad \u2014\nagreed to sell\na sixth-floor apartment at 838 Eighth Avenue, which was listed for slightly less than $25 million.

        "content": "The 1.8 million-square-foot office tower planned for 350 Park Avenue is a special case.\nDuring an earnings call last month, Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s Steve Roth said the project was\u00a0 \u201cisolated, different,\u201d than other ground-up office projects in part because billionaire Ken Griffin is involved. (Griffin\u2019s Citadel is anchoring the tenant and is a partner on the project.)\nAt the time, Roth said the environment for ground-up development is otherwise so inhospitable that he doesn\u2019t think any other project will get off the ground anytime soon. Of course, RXR, TF Cornerstone and BXP might have something to say about that, given that they plan to break ground on their own\ntrophy office towers\nthis year.\nBut on Monday the Park Avenue project became the first office tower to be presented to the City Planning Commission in recent years. The Department of City Planning certified the project on Monday, kickstarting the monthslong public review of the project.\nThe project is made possible, in part, by the\n2017 rezoning\nof Midtown East, which allowed air rights from landmarked properties to be transferred to non-adjacent sites throughout the district. The development team is buying more than 480,000 square feet of air rights from St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and St. Bartholomew\u2019s Church. As part of those deals, the developers are paying more than $30 million to a public Realm improvement fund created as part of the rezoning.\nThe developers are also seeking special permits to add space for a public concourse and to make other design adjustments, hence why the project has to go through the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure.\nCorrection:\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly described the period of time that City Planning has gone without reviewing applications for office buildings, based on information from the agency.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: What City Council races are you watching closely? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The Department of City Planning will begin public review of the Jamaica Neighborhood Plan, a rezoning that is expected to pave the way for the construction of more than 12,000 housing units in the Queens neighborhood over the next 15 years.\n\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer postponed several stops on his book tour this week, citing \u201csecurity reasons\u201d as he faces criticism for voting in favor of GOP-drafted stopgap spending bill,\nPolitico reports\n. Schumer was expected to make stops in Baltimore, Washington, New York City and Philadelphia this week to promote his new book, \u201cAntisemitism in America: A Warning.\u201d\n\u2014 A professor is accusing William Paterson University in New Jersey of losing his 380 million-year-old fossils,\nGothamist reports\n. Paleontologist Martin Baker is suing the school, alleging that it botched sending the fossils to a colleague in Florida, resulting in the collection being sent to a landfill in Tennessee.\n\u2014 The city plans to build a new NYPD training facility and indoor shooting range on City Island,\nthe City reports\n. Residents of City Island have complained over the years about the noise from the shooting range. NYPD representatives say the new facility will result in \u201calmost zero to no noise at all.\u201d\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Monday was\n$33.9 million\nfor a condo unit at 15 Central Park West. The Zeckendorf-developed unit\u2019s last on-market sale was $22.7 million in 2008, though the condo is selling less than its initial listing price of over $60 million.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$150 million\nfor 333 West 34th Street. Brookfield was the seller of the Garment District office property, which is 287,000 square feet. Brookfield faces a significant loss on the asset after paying $255 million for the property seven years ago,\nper reports\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $45 million at\n10 East 67th Street\n. The Lenox Hill townhouse is 13,100 square feet and is listed by Serhant.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 48,902-square-foot, six-story, mixed-use building at 10-39 49th Avenue in Queens. The plans also feature 35 class-A units. Anthony Ng of Angelo Ng &amp; Anthony Ng Architects was the applicant on the file.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

        "content": "The Wilf family thinks its revamped development can go event bigger in New Jersey as West Orange looks to contribute its fair share of affordable housing.\nGarden Homes, the development company led by Minnesota Vikings owner Zygi Wilf, proposed building an apartment community of nearly 500 units across four buildings in a forest on top of a mountain in West Orange, Gothamist\nreported\n. A previous 136-home plan for the same land was rejected by the town.\nThe development would include 100 apartments for low- and medium-income residents, which would help West Orange on the path to contributing its fair share of affordable housing, as required under state law.\nLocal opposition is hitched to environmental concerns and the possibility the retraction of the forestland would lead to worse flooding. Environmental experts fear developing the 120-acre land \u2014 the largest undeveloped tract in a densely populated part of the state \u2014\u00a0could also lead to dangers for residents living atop a mountain.\nWest Orange Township Council president Joe Krakoviak doesn\u2019t support the project, but voted in favor of including it in West Orange\u2019s affordable housing plan in 2020, fearing the possibility of a lawsuit and a loss of control over what is ultimately built on the site through builder\u2019s remedy, a court order that allows developers to bypass town control to build affordable housing.\n\nWhen the Wilfs first proposed an initial project in the early 2000s, it was rejected and public safety was the chief reason given. The deputy fire chief testified it would be dangerous and inefficient for both residents and emergency responders.\nAfterwards, local residents banded together to try and preserve the forest as protected open space, but couldn\u2019t come up with the necessary financing.\nWest Orange officials and the Fair Share Housing Center kicked off negotiations over utilizing the land in 2015 to work towards affordable housing goals. At the time, the land was analyzed and there was no objection in including it in the town\u2019s settlement agreement, according to a Fair Share director.\nThe West Orange planning board is set to hold a hearing regarding the project on Wednesday.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner",

The 18-acre island is the last piece of real estate held by the Zieglers in Darien, where they\u2019ve embarked on a long-winded selloff.\nThe listing was first reported by\nMansion Global\n. Cynthia and her husband, Renfrew Brighton, are planning to relocate to the south.\nThe island with views of the Long Island Sound is accessible by a gated causeway. Not simply a plot of land, the island also has an 8,700-square-foot colonial home with six bedrooms, seven bathrooms and six fireplaces, and a two-bedroom guest house constructed 15 years ago.\nThere\u2019s also an infinity-edge pool, a private dock and a spa. It takes only minutes to get to the heart of Darien, an affluent town on Connecticut\u2019s Gold Coast.\n\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Lesle McElwreath has the\nlisting\n. She\u2019s pitching the two-lot listing as a way for a buyer to mold a family compound, like the Zieglers did. They\u2019ve since moved \u201cfar and wide,\u201d according to McElwreath.\nIn May 2023, the town of Darien\npaid $85 million\nfor Great Island, a peninsula off of the Gold Coast. The Steinkraus family, descended from Ziegler\u2019s granddaughter, put the property up for sale in 2016 for $175 million. The town floated a museum, youth camps, pickleball and a community pool among options for the land, which it aimed to preserve from extensive development.\nIn late 2023, descendants of the industrialist\nsold Ziegler Farm\nto an anonymous buyer for $57.5 million, more than $1 million per acre. The largely undeveloped 51-acre parcel was listed for $85 million, meaning the sellers took a 32 percent discount from the original ask.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "An odd thing happened Sunday after I tweeted about Lee Zeldin\u2019s\nabout-face\non climate change: I was attacked on X by an owner of rent-stabilized housing.\nUsually, we are on the same side. But this landlord\u2019s message accused me of being a left-wing \u201cactivist.\u201d\nAgitated, I\nfired back\n:\n\u201cFind one reporter on the planet who has written more about the failure of rent control. Let me know when you do.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t the only social media commentator to accuse me of bias. X users on the left have accused me of being an enemy of working people and a mouthpiece for the real estate industry.\nWhy? Because I advocate for privately-developed multifamily projects and don\u2019t believe social housing can solve the affordability crisis. Moreover, these critics note that I am employed by a real estate publication.\nI can see why people are confused. They want to assign everyone a label \u2014 liberal, conservative, Democrat, Republican, progressive, socialist, even libertarian. This way, instead of considering the contents of what someone says, they can just dismiss it based on a presumed tribal affiliation or financial motive.\nLet me be clear: I don\u2019t take positions on issues for the sake of a political party, ideology, employer or bank account. (No one goes into journalism to make money.)\nCredibility comes from basing your positions on economics, science, data and facts \u2014 even if it upsets your audience.\n\nTrying to live up to a label only biases your thinking. You\u2019ll start at the end \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m progressive, so I support rent control\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m conservative, so I support free markets\u201d \u2014 and then work backward, crafting a rationale for a predetermined conclusion.\nBetter to judge things on a case-by-case basis, even if the results don\u2019t fit a neat pattern. In my case:\nI favor regulation in the form of\ncongestion pricing\nbut not the\nHousing Stability and Tenant Protection Act\n.\nI support affordable housing, but not in a way that\nconcentrates poverty\n.\nI support a minimum wage, but not one that limits apartment projects to 99 units,\nas 485x has\n.\nI cheer the fundamental\nwork standards\nwon by organized labor but not the hotel workers union\u2019s special permit requirement that\nstopped hotel development cold\n.\nSometimes, a policy that seems reasonable \u2014 such as giving poor people but not high earners a break on sales tax \u2014 is impractical, which is why clothing items priced under $110 in New York are\ntax-free\neven for billionaires.\nThen there\u2019s the\nscaffold law\n, which sounds unreasonable, but on further exploration, is \u2026\neven worse\n.\nThe landlord who questioned my motives was gracious enough to delete the tweet after another reader came to my defense. And the owner then complimented my column about the legislature\u2019s\nbaseless bills\nagainst investors\u2019 buying houses.\nFor the record, on housing issues, we generally agree.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll never have enough housing in NYC until it becomes profitable to build, own, operate it,\u201d he\nposted\nrecently. \u201cYou can\u2019t\nregulate\nyour way out of a supply problem.\u201d\n",

The total contract volume was $85.4 million, up from\n$80.8 million across 27 signed deals\nreported in the previous period.\nDuring the same week last year, there were 19 contracts signed in the Brooklyn luxury market for a total volume of $75.3 million.\nThe top contract went to 246 Clinton Street in Cobble Hill with an asking price of $8.5 million.\nThe home previously sold over a decade ago for $4.4 million.\nSpanning 5,400 square feet with four beds and four baths, the 25-foot-wide home was renovated by Aman Architecture to maintain original details and add modern enhancements geothermal heating and cooling, radiant heated floors, water purification, smart home technology and an irrigation system for the garden.\nThe parlor floor features a living room with 21-foot ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows, and the garden floor functions as a self-contained one-bedroom.\nThe InHouse Group\u2019s Robert Earl and Virginia Incalcaterra had the listing.\n\nThe second priciest contract belonged to another Cobble Hill townhouse.

        "content": "Watermark Capital Group secured financing for one of Brooklyn\u2019s notable office-to-residential conversions.\nWolfe Landau\u2019s firm scored $125 million in construction financing for the conversion of 175 Pearl Street in Dumbo, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. Bravo Property Trust \u2014 an affiliate of Bravo Capital \u2014 and Integritas Capital provided the debt, which closed a year after BridgeCity Capital originated a $50.6 million acquisition loan.\nWatermark\nacquired\nthe eight-story, 185,000-square-foot office property last summer from Cannon Hill Capital Partners for $66.5 million. Landau immediately embarked on plans to convert the 1918-built property into a 19-story complex.\nOriginally, the plans reportedly called for a 14-story, 230,000-square-foot building with 238 rental units. Those plans have since shifted, with Watermark eyeing multifamily units on the eight converted floors and an 11-story condo property atop the rentals.\nCritically, the rental portion of the building will qualify for the city\u2019s 467m program, giving Landau a tax abatement for 35 years in exchange for 25 percent of apartments being earmarked for affordable housing. The abatement provides a 65 percent exemption for the first 30 years before falling to 10 percent annually for the last five years of the abatement.\n\nOccupants at the building included Constangy, Brooks, Smith &amp; Prophete, Thelab and coworking company Spaces. But a BridgeCity analyst said at the time of acquisition that all tenants had either departed or were soon to do so.\nAmenities are expected to include tenant lounges and a fitness center. Watermark expects to complete the conversion in 2027.\nLast summer, Williamsburg-based Watermark\nsubmitted a proposal\nfor a residential project on the site of a shuttered church in Greenwood Heights. The 218-unit project requires a zoning change from the district\u2019s light manufacturing zoning status to residential.\nIn June, the firm paid $15 million for Brooklyn\u2019s Hanson Place Central United Methodist Church in Fort Greene, while in late 2023, Watermark paid $12.3 million for St. Lucy\u2019s-St. Patrick Roman Catholic Church in Bedford-Stuyvesant and demolished it to make room for housing.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

That\u2019s a significant retrenchment from the\n391-unit project proposed\ntwo years ago.\nMichael Dubb\u2019s firm capsized the unit count amid concerns from the community, which Dubb said was a voluntary decision. The $220 million project now comprises 53 single-family homes, 153 townhomes and 82 villas, 29 of which would be set aside for affordable housing.\nThe development is still set to unfold on a property at the corner of Old Northport and Lawrence roads, previously home to a concrete manufacturing and sand mining operation. It also complies with Smithtown\u2019s Comprehensive Plan.\nBut opposition remains. The president of the Kings Park Community Association says the group remains concerned the development is too large and that the reduction in size will simply open the door for other developers to increase the size of their own adjacent projects. He added the project \u201cprovides no discernible benefits to the community.\u201d Concerns also include the area\u2019s environment, drinking water, traffic and schools.\n\nBeechwood is building a wastewater sewage treatment plant in conjunction with the Country Pointe Estates. The development is still a long way off; Dubb is hoping to secure all approvals by 2027 and complete work on the development by 2030.\nKings Park is home to several sizable projects, creating concerns for some community members about overdevelopment. Smithtown is creating a comprehensive master plan for Kings Park\u2019s downtown development.\nDespite concerns about overdevelopment, there\u2019s also a need to update the housing stock in the hamlet; the Country Pointe Estates project could increase the number of units in the hamlet by 4.4 percent alone, according to project consultants.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The deal was signed at the start of the year and closed a week ago.\nThe buyer used a limited liability company of its own to obscure its identity, but the entity appears to share an address with another well-known landlord, Taconic Partners, which also owns the neighboring property to the west of the asset. A representative for Taconic, however, denied the firm\u2019s involvement to\nThe Real Deal\n.\nA representative for Brookfield also did not immediately respond to a request for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe sale of the 287,000-square-foot office property works out to $523 per square foot. That\u2019s a small gain on the price per buildable square foot Brookfield paid New York REIT for the property in 2018, but not on the price per built square foot: Brookfield sold the property for more than $100 million less than\nthe $255 million\nit paid for the property seven years ago.\nTenants at the 10-story building include the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Sam Ash Music and Godiva Chocolatier. The MTA leases at least 100,000 square feet, according to\nCompStak\n, and is on a lease that isn\u2019t set to expire until 2035.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who brokered the transaction for either side.\nThe Garment District has been trimming the spirits of office landlords lately. A couple of weeks ago, Bahrain-based Investcorp took a hit on a pair of buildings in the neighborhood, selling them to Josh Rahmani\u2019s Empire Capital Holdings\nfor at least 68 percent below\nwhat it paid for them less than a decade ago.\nBrookfield\u2019s office luck has been a mixed bag of late, landing big leases but also facing serious distress. This month, the investor positioned itself to\nbuy a $93 million delinquent loan\non a distressed office building in San Francisco, which would allow the firm to ultimately take control of Vanbarton Group\u2019s 22-story property.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The lease spans the entire corner site at East 60th Street.\nAt one time, a Citibank branch occupied a portion of the ground-floor corner space of the property, which is also home to the Parc Cinq luxury building. In 2023, the building\u2019s co-op board \u2014 which controls the retail space \u2014 retained Newmark to market the site on Fifth Avenue\u2019s famed retail corridor.\nThe asking rent for the two-floor space was $4.8 million per year. The duration of the lease was not disclosed.\nA Newmark team including Jeffrey Roseman, Caleb Petersen and Drew Weiss represented the co-op board. CBRE\u2019s Jonathan Schley and GoodSpace\u2019s Chris DeCrosta represented the tenant.\n\nThe retail space used to have narrow windows befitting a bank, which have since been expanded. The alterations needed to go through the Landmarks Preservation Commission because the property is in a historic district.\nThis will be the global watchmaker\u2019s third spot in Manhattan. The Swiss company also has a sales boutique at 66 East 57th Street and a service center at 52-58 Gansevoort Street.\nIt\u2019s upping the ante with space on Fifth Avenue, long considered international shopping destination. It\u2019s set to undergo a seismic change after the city reached a deal with the merchants to redesign the street, Gothamist\nreported\nin the fall, which will see more space opened for pedestrians by doubling the width of the sidewalks between Bryant Park and Central Park.\nCity officials have estimated the redesign would cost $350 million, excluding the price of relocating underground utilities and sewers.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance subsidiary Barings purchased the property at auction on Thursday for $161 million.\nAt least three prospective bidders appeared interested in the property prior to the auction, according to court records. Barings, however, was the only qualified bidder to actually attend the event last week.\nIn May, MassMutual\nfiled a complaint\nagainst Rechler\u2019s firm after it defaulted on a $315 million mortgage, which matured earlier in the year. A spokesperson for the company said at the time that the property was high quality, but had a \u201cbroken capital structure.\u201d RXR had identified the building as \u201cdigital\u201d as opposed to \u201cfilm,\u201d meaning it was part of the company\u2019s portfolio that was deemed worth keeping.\nA loan modification was still a possibility at the time. As of May, there were about 300,000 square feet available, representing 40 percent of the building\u2019s total rentable area.\n\nRXR in April leased about 7,000 square feet to investment firm Yaupon Capital Management and 5,500 to Northampton Capital Partners, an infrastructure and energy-transition investment firm led by a former Apollo Global Management executive. RXR also signed renewals with SRS Real Estate Partners and Edelman Financial Engines and new leases with investment firm Tide Rock and Boundary Creek Advisors.\nThe 22-story, 760,000-square-foot building has estimated asking rents between $68 and $83 per square foot, according to CoStar.\nAn RXR representative declined to comment to Crain\u2019s on the auction.\nIn better news for Rechler, RXR and SL Green\nworked out a deal\non the $940 million mortgage backed by Worldwide Plaza on Eighth Avenue. The borrowers, which also include a subsidiary of the liquidating company for New York REIT, will use loan reserves to fund operating expenses and debt service shortfalls, according to Morningstar; the loan is still set to come due in November 2027.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "After seven years of searching, a pet product investor finally found a buyer for his Upper East Side condo.\nThe sixth-floor apartment at 838 Fifth Avenue, asking just under $25 million, was the priciest home to snag a signed contract in Manhattan last week, according to Olshan Realty\u2019s weekly report.\nAllen Simon, the inventor of the Wee Wee Pad, and his wife, Cynthia Simon, bought the apartment from the sponsor for just under $11 million in 2000. The couple sought to offload the condo nearly 20 years later with a $42 million asking price.\nThe 5,400-square-foot pad drifted\non and off the market\nfor several years and cycled through three brokerages before landing an inked deal. The contract includes two storage bins and a studio apartment.\nThe unit, which is due for renovation, has three bedrooms, five bathrooms and three fireplaces. It also features views overlooking Central Park and a private elevator. Amenities in the building, one of few condos lining the east side of the park, include a doorman and gym.\nCompass\u2019 Kyle Blackmon, Samantha Shuman and Ethan Mahgerefteh had the listing.\n\nThe condo was one of 36 homes in Manhattan asking $4 million or more to find buyers between March 10 and March 16. The total \u2014 just one pending deal higher than the\nprevious period\n\u2014 included 11 contracts signed for homes asking $10 million or more, the largest number of contracts for trophy properties since December.\nThe second and third most expensive homes to enter contract were two condos at 111 West 57th Street, both asking roughly $21 million, down $10 million from their asking prices when the developers started marketing them from floorplans in 2016.\nUnits 69 and 70, which were sold to different buyers, each span 3,900 square feet and have three bedrooms and three bathrooms. They also feature 14-foot ceilings and views of Central Park.\nThe Nikki Field Team with Sotheby\u2019s International is heading sales at the Billionaires\u2019 Row building, developed by JDS Development, Property Markets Group and Apollo. Amenities include a fitness center, pool, terrace and private dining room.\nOf the 36 properties, 27 were condos, five were co-ops and four were townhouses.\nThe homes\u2019 combined asking price was $323 million, for an average price of $9 million and a median of $6.5 million. The typical home spent more than 1,000 days on the market and was discounted 14 percent from the original listing price.\n",

        "content": "As the many candidates for mayor call for huge numbers of new homes \u2014 from\n200,000\n(Zohran Mamdani) to\n500,000\n(Brad Lander) to\n700,000\n(Zellnor Myrie) \u2014 Kenny Burgos is calling them out.\nThe CEO of the New York Apartment Association claims that most candidates are not truly pushing \u201cabundance\u201d as a housing goal, because none has identified a target vacancy rate.\nAbundance in housing means having far more units than is needed \u2014 that is, high vacancy \u2014 so renters and buyers negotiate prices down instead of bidding them up.\n\u201cA 5 to 10 percent vacancy rate should be the goal for a healthy housing market,\u201d Burgos said on his\nlatest podcast\n, reflecting the consensus view of economists.\nBut few city politicians take that position, for one simple reason: A vacancy rate of 5 percent would legally end the city\u2019s \u201c\nhousing emergency\n\u201d and thus rent stabilization.\n\u201cOver the past 50 years, elected officials have attempted to keep the housing stock as close to a 4 percent vacancy rate as possible,\u201d Burgos said.\nIt\u2019s a classic case of the tail wagging the dog.\nBefore\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s publisher, Amir Korangy, chides me for using an esoteric expression that confuses readers, I will explain. \u201c\nThe tail wagging the dog\n\u201d means something important or powerful is being controlled by something that isn\u2019t.\n\nIn this case, housing policy should determine the vacancy rate, not the other way around. But that isn\u2019t what happens in New York.\nBeginning with the citywide rezoning of 1961, elected officials have limited development, which along with strong demand to live in the city has kept the vacancy rate below the all-important 5 percent mark. When the rate surged after Covid, politicians\ndelayed\nthe Housing and Vacancy Survey until it went back down.\nThen it kept falling, all the way to a 56-year low of\n1.4 percent\n. That was a\nturning point\nin New York City politics. It\u2019s the reason all the candidates are talking about\nadding supply\n.\nBut, as Burgos alluded to, they don\u2019t want to add enough to solve the problem, because rent-stabilization would disappear and about 2 million tenants would storm City Hall like the January 6 mob did on Capitol Hill.\nBurgos represents owners of rent-stabilized housing, who obviously would rejoice at being able to charge market-rate rent. That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s wrong about\nrent control\nbeing a\nfailed policy\n.\nOn his podcast, the lobby group CEO challenged reporters to demand mayoral candidates reveal their desired vacancy rate. Tempting as that might be for journalists, it would serve no purpose because no Democrat could advocate for ending rent stabilization and expect to win the primary.\nBetter to cheer the plans that have a chance to break the 5 percent threshold, such as\nMyrie\u2019s\nand\nLander\u2019s\n, even if the candidates will never admit that is possible.\n",

But an analysis of public records found unsold buildings in the area accounted for\nmore than 20 percent\nof Manhattan\u2019s unsold units. An ill-timed development influx has left overpriced units piling up in Lower Manhattan.\nOne unit\nthat was sold\nin Downtown Manhattan was a West Village condo owned by Harsh Padia, CEO of HAP Capital. The sale of the unit for $60 million in an off-market deal represented a record for the most expensive condo in the area.\nThe Real Deal\nexplored the story\nof the tiny townhouse at 19 West 46th Street, a Midtown Manhattan relic that may be the third-narrowest in the entire borough.

        "content": "The Agency\u2019s Mike Fabbri was almost across the finish line on a Downtown Manhattan co-op sale.\nHis buyer, a woman in her 30s, had already signed a contract for the apartment and agreed to pay in cash. All that was left was the board application, a historically arduous process, but he was confident she fit the bill.\nThen came deal-breaking news \u2014 his buyer was the proud owner of a cockatoo.\nFabbri scrambled to pull together documentation that might convince the board that a new winged resident wasn\u2019t such a bad idea. He collected letters of recommendation from his buyer\u2019s previous landlord and a friend who used to watch her bird on occasion. Her doctor wrote a note testifying to the bird\u2019s capabilities as an emotional support animal.\nThe co-op board rejected her bid. Boards don\u2019t typically give a reason for their refusal, but given her other qualifications, Fabbri suspects it was the cockatoo.\nIn my time as a reporter, brokers across the city have recounted similar tales, especially when selling Manhattan co-ops, where rules are stringent and even the slightest error on a board package \u2014 or a dog teetering on the edge of 50 pounds \u2014 can scrap a deal.\nAs prices for co-ops stagnated, and buyers turned increasingly to condos, agents say several boards have\nrelaxed many of their policies\n, allowing buyers to finance more of their purchase or renovate their apartments in months that aren\u2019t June, July or August.\nCould requirements for pets, which appraiser Jonathan Miller\nonce referred to\nas a \u201cdog weighing-in ceremony,\u201d be the next to ease? While most still have weight and breed restrictions, blanket bans on pets are likely near impossible, since the pandemic prompted many New Yorkers to adopt a furry family member.\n\u201cPeople are not giving up their dogs, even if they love the apartment,\u201d said Brown Harris Stevens\u2019 Lisa Simonsen. \u201cSome people would probably prefer to leave behind a teenager.\u201d\nEven with restrictions still in place, brokers have found ways to skirt around the rules \u2014 and it usually involves tacking on a few numbers to the purchase price.\nOne of Simonsen\u2019s buyers was approved to buy a Park Avenue co-op, despite her two 70- to 80-pound hunting dogs.\n\u201cWhen you get to the point that you\u2019re getting full ask or over ask, they don\u2019t say no so quickly.\u201d\nUnlike Fabbri, other brokers have gotten lucky with the paperwork. About eight years ago, Compass\u2019 Vickey Barron was representing a doctor in the purchase of a co-op on lower Fifth Avenue.\n\nDuring the board interview, a member asked him if anyone would be staying in his apartment, to which he replied, his girlfriend, and potentially her dog. His response sent Barron on a chase to assemble the dog\u2019s vaccination records, adoption papers and anything else she could think of to prove the dog wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\nThe board\u2019s final request was for her buyer to bring the dog in for an interview.\nThe pup must have passed the test because Barron\u2019s buyer got the apartment. But last she checked, he\u2019d lost the girlfriend. And her dog.\nNot so fast\u2026\nThe time for acquisitions is now \u2014 at least that\u2019s what Real Trends co-founder Steve Murray\nprophesied on a panel\nat the HousingWire conference almost a year ago. And the latest headlines are proving him right.\nRumors swirled on Thursday that Compass was closing in on a deal to buy Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices. The speculation was all but confirmed in the afternoon when the Wall Street Journal reported that the firms were in\n\u201cadvanced talks,\u201d\nthough the story lacked any specifics about the pending sale.\nHomeServices CEO Gino Blefari\nrefuted the reporting\nin an email sent around to franchisees, claiming \u201cno such sale is being contemplated.\u201d\nTales of the alleged acquisition came just months after Compass purchased @properties and Christie\u2019s International Real Estate,\na $444 million sale\nthat sent shockwaves across the industry. In New York City, Compass and the local BHHS affiliate were both among the\ntop brokerages\nby sales volume in 2023, with Compass holding the No.2 spot with $5 billion in sell-side deals and BHHS in 18th with just under $100 million.\nIn the first two weeks of March, other major national brokerages have announced deals of their own. Keller Williams Realty, the largest brokerage by agent count, sold\na significant stake\nto Stone Point Capital, the parent company of CoreLogic. Earlier this week, mortgage firm Rocket Companies\npaid $1.75 billion\nto acquire Redfin.\nWith two deals in the books before the end of the first quarter, signs are pointing toward more acquisitions in the year to come \u2014 even if Compass buying BHHS isn\u2019t one of them.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nActress Grace Hightower sold the Central Park West co-op she shared with her ex-husband, Robert De Niro, for\n$18 million\nin the priciest deal to close in the city this week. The couple bought the apartment at 88 Central Park West for $21 million almost two decades ago.\nThe home, which De Niro and Hightower renovated after a fire in 2012, has five bedrooms, views of Central Park and an eat-in kitchen.\n",

        "content": "Waiting for a new Penn Station is a little like waiting for a train at Penn Station.\nYou are standing in the NJ Transit train hall, neck craned back slightly to stare down a screen that promises your train is \u201con time.\u201d A small number will appear next to your train, telling you where to catapult your body to join a swarm of commuters competing to squeeze onto the tiny escalator that will deliver you to your train.\nBut the number never appears, despite an automated voice that tells you the train is pulling up to the station. You get an alert on your phone that says all trains are suspended in and out of Penn because someone sneezed near some Amtrak signal cables. Or NJ Transit needs to investigate the sneeze; it is unclear. You know that no trains are coming, but that automated, female voice keeps informing you, over and over, that phantom trains are pulling up to the station.\nThat disembodied voice is a little like the announcements that the state is kick-starting a plan to redevelop Penn Station. You hear it, you want to believe it and then you wait and nothing happens.\nI\u2019ve been covering this project for the past 10 years, and in that time, the state has reintroduced the project at least five times. Many visions, by both the state and outside groups, have been pitched during that time.\nThis week Grand Penn Alliance, a group backed by hedge fund manager and Republican donor Thomas Klingenstein,\naccording to Gothamist\n, reupped a proposal it introduced in 2023. The plan calls for moving Madison Square Garden to the former Hotel Penn site, and building a park on the former arena site. Renderings show a classical facade, new train hall and single-level concourse. Last week Assembly member Tony Simone\npitched\nrevising plans for a megadevelopment surrounding the station to include more housing and a park on the Hotel Penn site.\nWe\u2019re still waiting on the state to announce its next move on redesigning Penn Station and whether Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s meeting with President Donald Trump on Friday will help get things moving. We\u2019ve been on standby for decades, and this train will not pull into the station until funding is lined up for the project.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: What is going on with\nBerkshire Hathaway HomeServices and Compass\n? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Mets owner Steve Cohen\u2019s casino project, which his press people will no doubt remind us should be referred to as Metropolitan Park, this week\ngot the rezoning\nit needs from the City Council, Gothamist reports. That was not a surprise, because the local Council member, Francisco Moya, supports the plan.\nCohen\u2019s main obstacle is getting parkland alienation from the state legislature, because the local state senator, Sen. Jessica Ramos, doesn\u2019t want a casino in her district.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the legislature will alienate the parkland over her objections, but that is rare for Albany. If ever an exception would be made, it would be for something like this. The parkland is really just a parking lot. \u2014\nErik Engquist\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 President Donald Trump hinted Thursday that he may seek Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s approval of a controversial pipeline as part of discussions that include congestion pricing and the redevelopment of Penn Station,\nGothamist reports\n. The so-called Constitution Pipeline would stretch 124 miles through New York\u2019s Southern Tier and western Catskills.\n\u2014 City health officials say two pet cats died after being infected with bird flu,\nthe New York Times reports\n. The cause of the infections was not clear, though potential sources include unpasteurized milk, contact with infected birds and infected food.\n\u2014 Last month Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado announced that he will not seek re-election next year. Now, it seems he\u2019s preparing to run for something else.\nCity &amp; State reports\nthat Delgado spoke at New York Somos in Albany last weekend and delivered \u201cstump speech-sounding remarks.\u201d He did not attend Hochul\u2019s private reception at the Executive Mansion.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Friday was\n$15.6 million\nfor a condo unit at 535 West End Avenue. The Upper West Side condo is 6,600 square feet. The unit was last sold in 2013 for $16.3 million.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$161.3 million\nfor 334-342 Madison Avenue. The 22-story office building was sold at auction after RXR\u2019s Scott Rechler defaulted on a\n$315 million\nmortgage on the building.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $7.2 million for 160 Leroy Street. The West Village condo is 2,000 square feet.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s\nArlene Gutterson has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 66,886-square-foot, 12-story residential building at 10 Van Cortlandt Avenue East in the Bronx. The development site sold last year for nearly $5 million. Saky Yakas of SLCE Architects is the applicant of record.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

        "content": "For some New York City property owners, there\u2019s still not enough incentive to limit carbon emissions.\nDozens of landlords are planning to pay fines for failing to comply with Local Law 97, rather than retrofit their properties to reduce emissions, according to responses by more than two dozen building sector executives to the Center for an Urban Future\nreported\nby Crain\u2019s.\nSome owners think the bottom line looks better if they absorb the fines that will be levied against them for failing to meet decarbonization goals dictated by the law. Retrofitting properties\u2019 lighting, insulation and various systems can be a costly endeavor in itself.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough sell,\u201d Center for an Urban Future policy director Eli Dvorkin told Crain\u2019s. \u201cFor many building owners, it just comes down to pretty basic math, and right now the payback period for those investments is long and getting longer with higher interest rates and rising costs for borrowing.\u201d\nBuilding owners are set to pay $268 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions that exceeds a property\u2019s 2024 limit, varying by building. Owners are required to file reports with the city by Mary to demonstrate compliance; emission reduction targets are set to grow at the end of the decade.\nSo far, a vast majority of buildings required to meet emissions targets are in compliance with the law. The Department of Buildings claims fewer than 11 percent are out of compliance with 2024-26 emissions targets.\n\nTo ensure future compliance, however, Dvorkin suggested the city may need to\nimpose higher fees\nfor violating the decarbonization law, something the Real Estate Board of New York opposes.\nAnother possibility is for the city to increase incentives and financial assistance to help property owners comply with the law, such as providing additional funds and tax credits.\n\u201cThe green economy isn\u2019t just going to build itself,\u201d Dvorkin added.\nThe aim of Local Law 97 is for the city to cut emissions 40 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2050 from 2005 levels.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The deal, which appears to be all-cash, works out to about $3,000 per square foot.\nThe nearly-200-unit building, blocks away from Washington Square Park, is\nknown for housing celebrities\nlike the Rolling Stones\u2019 Keith Richards and filmmaker Tim Burton and his ex-wife, actress Helena Bonham Carter.\nAbrams\u2019 new apartment, Unit 18GK, spans roughly 2,000 square feet and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms. It also features three terraces and views of the park and downtown Manhattan.\nThe co-op last traded for $7 million in 2008.\n\nSotheby\u2019s International\u2019s Martine Capdevielle and Brigitte Goldenberg had the listing.\nCapdevielle said the apartment would likely need a renovation, but declined to comment on the details of the sale.\nAmenities at the Art Deco co-op include full-time doormen and building staff. The landmarked building was designed by architect Harvey Wiley Corbett and built in 1927. It served as a hotel for wealthy artists until it was converted to a co-op in 1976.\nAward-winning actress Jessica Lange bought a ninth-floor unit at the building for $3.4 million in 2005, and more than a decade later,\npurchased the apartment\ndirectly above hers for $3.3 million.\nKeith Richards and his wife, Patti Hensen, sold their duplex penthouse at the co-op in 2018 for $9 million \u2014 roughly\n$1 million less\nthan they paid for it four years earlier. The couple initially tried to offload their pad for more than $12 million.\n",

        "content": "Bill and Dana Lozito\u2019s Trinity Southern is taking over development of a long-planned luxury condo project in Miami Beach called 29 Indian Creek,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nDeveloper Jason Halpern\u2019s JMH Development will remain an investor-partner and adviser on the planned 22-unit development at\n2901 and 2911 Indian Creek Drive\n, near the Faena District, Bill Lozito said. It marks the first South Florida development for New York-based Trinity, an owner-builder that has been involved in the ownership, assemblage or construction of more than 1 million square feet in its history, according to a press release.\nJMH launched sales of an 11-unit building on the site about\ntwo years ago\n.\nTrinity bought into the project for an undisclosed amount in September, Lozito said, declining to disclose more details about the deal.\n\u201cWe took the hard work that JMH has done and put our own spin on it,\u201d he said.\nThe development, which will overlook the Indian Creek waterway, will now include a 20-unit condo building with one- and two-bedroom units, and two two-story townhouses, the release said. Prices will range from $1.4 million to just over $3 million, and the developers tapped Ryan Serhant\u2019s\neponymous firm\nto lead sales. Serhant\u2019s other South Florida projects include Mercedes-Benz Places and MG Developer\u2019s\nThe George\ntownhouse development in Coral Gables.\nThe 29 Indian Creek condos will range from 820 square feet to 1,750 square feet. The townhouses will include 500-square-foot terraces with summer kitchens and wet bars.\n\nThe project will have \u201cas many [amenities] as the big developments,\u201d including a rooftop pool, gym and fitness area,\u201d Lozito said. Urban Robot is designing the development.\nBuyers will also receive membership to the beach club at the nearby Miami Beach Edition, according to the release.\nThe team could begin demolition work in April and begin construction shortly after that. The project could be completed by the end of 2026. Trinity is bringing its team down and will supplement construction labor with local subcontractors.\nThe developers will self-fund construction at the start and later take out a construction loan, Lozito said. Trinity is looking to work on additional projects in South Florida, he added.\nThe 0.3-acre Indian Creek development site previously traded in 2017 for $7.8 million. Halpern\u2019s JMH was tied up in\nlitigation\nwith former partners who included investor Dhruv Piplani. In 2022, a judge in New York dismissed the lawsuit filed by Piplani\u2019s PSB Indian Creek and affiliated entities, allowing JMH to move forward with the project.\nIt\u2019s a few blocks away from Len Blavatnik\u2019s Faena District, a luxury complex that includes the Faena House condo building and Faena Hotel Miami Beach, both developed with Alan Faena.\nAman Residences\n, developed by Vlad Doronin and backed by Blavatnik, is under construction in the district.\n",

IMC Equity\u2019s purchase also included two retail outparcels spanning 8,076 square feet built in 2023.\nIMC Equity representatives did not respond to requests for comment.\u00a0\u201cShoma Group has sold tens of thousands of units since 1985 and has never kept any assets longer than two or three years,\u201d A Shoma spokespeson said in a statement. \u201cThis has always been our business model \u2014 develop a project and sell the assets. There has been no change in our strategy.\u201d\nRoughly three weeks ago, Shoma sold a 2.5-acre shuttered car dealership at 3650 Bird Road for\n$35 million\n, abandoning plans to redevelop the site into a two-tower mixed-use project with 748 apartments and 20,000 square feet of retail.\n\nShoma sold the property for $1 million above its\n$34 million\npurchase price in 2022. A joint venture between 13th Floor Investments and Related Group, two Coconut Grove-based firms, and New York-based LeFrak Organization bought the site.\nThe same day the deal closed, Shoma paid off a $38.8 million loan secured by the former dealership, records show.\nShoma and its top two executives have faced some turmoil in recent months. In December, a foreclosure complaint was filed against Masoud and Stephanie Shojaee and two trusts under his name for allegedly failing to repay a\n$10.5 million\nloan secured by the retail component of Shoma Village. The lender voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit two weeks after filing it.\nIn January,\nCity National Bank\nfiled a foreclosure lawsuit against Masoud Shojaee and a Shoma entity alleging default on loans totaling $14.1 million, including a mortgage on a Coral Gables condo where the Shojaees reside. The bank quickly dismissed the complaint and reinstated the loans after reaching a settlement.\nShoma is also facing a pending construction defects lawsuit by the condominium association for\nTen30\n, a boutique three-story condominium with 33 units in Miami Beach that Shoma built in 2022.",

        "content": "A year into Coral Gables\u2019 Columbus Center\u2019s debt woes, Tourmaline Capital Partners paid $76 million for the property facing foreclosure.\nBryn Mawr, Pennsylvania-based Tourmaline bought the office complex consisting of a 14-story building and an eight-story building on a 2.5-acre site at 1 Alhambra Plaza, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The buyer borrowed $71.6 million for the purchase from Banesco USA.\nThe 262,000-square-foot complex was sold by receiver Chris Neilson, who was appointed by the court to oversee Columbus Center and its financials in the foreclosure suit pending against its previous owner, San Antonio, Texas-based Affinius Capital.\nAffinius started facing issues with its Columbus Center debt in March of last year. At the time, Affinius\u2019 $71.6 million loan on the property\nentered special servicing\ndue to its failure to renew an interest rate cap for its floating-rate loan, according to Morningstar Credit. That constituted a default under the financing agreement between Affinius and lender V\u00e4rde Partners.\nAn interest rate cap is a hedge against rate increases.\nIn October, Minneapolis-based V\u00e4rde filed the foreclosure suit against Affinius, alleging it defaulted on a\n$68.9 million\nloan. The total amount owed was $77.4 million, including interest and late fees, according to the complaint.\n\nThe $76 million sale to Tourmaline doesn\u2019t satisfy the total debt owed, but \u201crepresents a reasonable and fair market value,\u201d according to a motion to approve the sale filed by the receiver and V\u00e4rde in January in the foreclosure case. Tourmaline bought the property free from liens or other financial obligations.\nAffinius\u2019 attorney in the foreclosure case, Jamie Zysk Isani, didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment.\nAffinius, led by Len O\u2019Donnell, paid $10.7 million for Columbus Center in 1989, financing the purchase with a $10.6 million loan, according to records. The loan was amended several times in the following decades and assigned to V\u00e4rde in 2020.\nTourmaline, led by\nBrandon Huffman\n, also has an ownership stake in the 34-story\nCitigroup Center\nat 201 South Biscayne Boulevard in downtown Miami. In 2023, Tourmaline and New York-based Monarch Alternative Capital paid\n$250 million\nfor the 28-story office tower at 801 Brickell Avenue in Miami\u2019s Brickell. It marked the\nbiggest\nSouth Florida office deal that year.\nSouth Florida\u2019s office landlords have felt the\nsting\nfrom higher interest rates, skyrocketing property insurance and skittish lenders. While the tri-county region became a magnet for out-of-state companies from late 2020 through 2022, demand slowed in recent years. In some cases, even well-leased buildings have struggled due to higher interest rates.\nIn downtown Fort Lauderdale, lender Trimont filed a foreclosure suit in August against Alliance HP for allegedly defaulting on a\n$59.2 million\nloan for the 28-story One Financial Plaza at 100 Southeast Third Avenue. The case is pending, with Neilson serving as the court-appointed receiver for that property as well.\n",

The developers lease the site from Broward College.\nSantander Bank is the lender for the construction financing. Houston-based Marble Capital made a preferred equity investment for an undisclosed amount.\nPeter Mekras led the Aztec Group team that represented the developers in the loan and equity investment.\nParks at Davie will consist of studios and one- to three-bedroom apartments, with units ranging from 568 square feet to 1,415 square feet. It will include 6,200 square feet of retail and co-working space.\nAbout 77 of the units will be at workforce rents, according to a 13th Floor spokesperson. The targeted area median income will be determined when the project is closer to completion.\nConstruction will start this month, and is expected to be completed in 2027, the release says.\n13th Floor\n, led by Arnaud Karsenti, has completed about 3,900 residential units since its founding in 2008 and has more than 4,800 units in the pipeline, according to the release.\n\nIn July, the firm completed the\n420-unit Savio\napartment complex at 1874 Heron Club Drive in Delray Beach. The Ardid family\u2019s Key International, Wexford Real Estate Investors and CDS International Holdings partnered with 13th Floor on Savio, which marked the first phase of their Parks at Delray development slated for a total of 693 apartments and 54 townhouses.\nIn Hallandale Beach, 13th Floor is developing the five-story, 398-unit\nParks at Hallandale\napartment complex at 2002 Pembroke Road.\nJSB, led by J. Jay Lobell, is a private equity and alternative investment firm that focuses on real estate, according to its website. It has ramped up its South Florida investment in recent years.\nIn December, JSB paid\n$69 million\nfor the 197-unit Stellar at Emerald Hills apartment complex at 5800-5840 Lakeshore Drive in Dania Beach. JSB also bought the Havn Residences &amp; Yacht Club condo complex with 36 units and 54 boat slips at 176 Lake Drive in Palm Beach Shores for\n$58.5 million\nin 2023.\nThe Parks at Davie construction loan comes as South Florida faces a multifamily supply overhang. Developers completed a record\n18,600 apartments last year\n, outpacing 15,000 new leases signed, according to CoStar Group data. That\u2019s led to slower lease-ups, an increase in concessions and a slight decrease in rents. South Florida\u2019s median rent dropped by nearly 2 percent in February, year-over-year, a\nRealtor.com report\nshows.\nDemand is expected to catch up to supply this year and next year due to a slowdown of construction starts.\nSouth Florida multifamily\nconstruction lending\ncontinues to flow. This month, TM Real Estate landed\n$53.5 million\nto build the 250-unit Shalimar at Boynton Beach complex at 3570 West Boynton Beach Boulevard in Boynton Beach. That came on the heels of Savanna scoring a\n$380 million\nconstruction loan for the two 26-story Olara project with 170 apartments and 287 condos at 1919 North Flagler Drive in West Palm Beach.\n",

        "content": "Adam Neumann\u2019s Flow nabbed a $51 million acquisition loan and is partnering with Canada Global for a planned mixed-use project on an El Portal development site.\nNew York-based Ladder Capital provided the mortgage to a Delaware entity with ties to Flow that paid\n$71.5 million\nfor a 16-acre former trailer park at 8500 Biscayne Boulevard, records show.\nCanada Global\n, an Israeli real estate firm led by Assaf Tuchmair and Barak Rosen, came on board as a majority partner shortly after Miami-based Flow won a January court auction for the vacant property, a source familiar with the joint venture told\nThe Real Deal\n. In November, the two firms also partnered to purchase an Aventura office complex for\n$116.2 million\n.\nOn the El Portal site, the joint venture is planning to build 2,380-plus apartments with commercial space and a school, the source said. Approved for a 3 million-square-foot mixed-use project with 150 units per acre, a developer can build up to roughly 2,400 apartments.\n\nThe site, previously known as the Little Farm trailer park, has sat empty since 2016 when 45 residents settled a lawsuit with the village of El Portal and the previous ownership entity, led by Fu Jing \u201cLeo\u201d Wu. The Village and Wu\u2019s entity agreed to pay the residents $8,000 each for relocation costs. Wu also managed an entity that owned a former federal immigration building at 7880 Biscayne Boulevard in Miami.\nThe trailer park site and the immigration building landed in court receivership as a result of a 2020 Miami-Dade civil lawsuit alleging Wu\u2019s entities misappropriated funds from\nEB-5 visa investors\n. The federal program grants permanent residency to foreign investors who finance business and real estate development projects in the U.S., as well as their immediate family members.\nIn 2023, receiver Michael Goldberg entered into a settlement agreement with Wu that allowed the sale of the properties to move forward without Wu\u2019s objections. Upon both deals closing, Wu will receive $5 million from the sale proceeds. In 2023, Miami-based B Group Capital Management bought the immigration building for\n$23 million\n, but abandoned plans to also buy Little Farm.\nIn October, Miami-based Melo Group submitted a\n$35 million\nstalking horse bid for the 16-acre trailer park. During the court auction two months ago, Melo lost a bidding war to Flow by $400,000.",

        "content": "A group of investors bought Airport Commerce Park near Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport for $18.3 million.\nThe deal comes amid a paradox for South Florida\u2019s office market. While aging suburban buildings have traded at discounts and\nforeclosures\nhave popped up, Broward County recently scored two office deals for over $200 million each.\nAn entity managed by Jorge Linkewer, principal at Aventura-based Triarch Capital Group, as well as Sarah and Sergio Selcer bought the complex at 4101 Ravenswood Road in Dania Beach from ACP Partners, according to records and real estate database Vizzda.\nSergio Selcer is associated with Step by Step Management in Coconut Creek. ACP is managed by Mario Henriquez and affiliated with Brickell-based JCT Management, according to Vizzda and state corporate records.\nThe buyers borrowed $10.3 million from Popular Bank.\nCompleted in 1987, Airport Commerce Park consists of four one-story buildings on a 6.6-acre site, property records show. ACP Partners paid $13.3 million for the property in 2007.\nTenants include computer repair service Rescuecom of Fort Lauderdale, Ocean Exotic Car Rental, Precision Air Conditioning, Digital Marketing Service Pro and the Consulate of Sweden.\n\nTriarch, founded in 1996 by Linkewer, Daniel Halberstein and Mario Grosfeld, has a portfolio of about 3.5 million square feet of commercial real estate, according to its website. Linkewer also is founder of brokerage Axiom Capital Advisors, which lists the same Aventura office as Triarch.\nTriarch is a frequent South Florida investor. In 2023, it bought the Shoppes at 41st Street plaza at 10355 and 10405 Northwest 41st Street in Doral for\n$18 million\n. That came on the heels of Triarch\u2019s\n$7.2 million\npurchase of an industrial outdoor storage site at 12601 West Okeechobee Road in Hialeah Gardens.\nIn 2020, the firm scored a\n$35 million\nrefinancing for the One Turnberry Place office building at 19495 Biscayne Boulevard in Aventura, which Triarch bought in 2011 for $53 million.\nIn the fourth quarter, South Florida\noffice\nvacancies and asking rents\nremained flat or slightly increased\n, year-over-year, according to an Avison Young report. Broward County\u2019s average asking rent hit $40.18 per square foot, up from $38.34 a square foot during the same period of 2023. The vacancy rate fell to 14.5 percent from 16.8 percent. But in all of last year,\nBroward\u2019s\ntotal leasing was 2.4 million square feet, a 27 percent decline from 2023, the Avison report shows.\nGenerally, real estate has felt the sting from higher interest rates, skyrocketing insurance and a slowdown of the influx of out-of-state companies, experts have said.\nSome properties have traded at a discount. In September, Galium Capital bought the Lake Shore Plaza II office building at 1300 Concord Terrace in Sunrise for\n$17 million\n, a nearly 47 percent discount from its price in 2013. In January, Accesso Partners bought the six-story Sawgrass Lake Center at 13450 West Sunrise Boulevard in Sunrise for\n$36.5 million\n, a 36.4 percent discount from its price in 2018.\nStill, downtown Fort Lauderdale scored two mammoth deals. Last month, DWS Group sold the\u00a0 Las Olas Centre I &amp; II at 350 and 450 East Las Olas Boulevard for\n$208 million\n, and the\u00a0 Bank of America Plaza at Las Olas City Centre at 401 East Las Olas Boulevard for\n$220 million\n.\n",

        "content": "A partially built luxury condo project in North Bay Village, the city\u2019s first in more than a decade, may be back on track.\nNever one to shy away from a challenge, Vivian Dimond\nstepped in\nto take over development and construction of what is now called Tula Residences, a 54-unit, 21-story (once it\u2019s finished) building on the waterfront.\nConstruction workers disappeared from the site in late 2023.\nDimond\u2019s Bayshore Grove Capital took over the LLC that owns the property last year. Malaysian developer Pacific &amp; Orient, led by CEO Thye Seng Chan, will remain a partner in the project.\nIn Miami, most condo developers use the following strategy: buy land, hire a public relations firm to tease a project launch, begin sales, open a sales center, publicize that opening \u2014 maybe with a splashy party \u2014 etc.\nChan didn\u2019t really follow that approach. His firm waited to launch sales of the project, didn\u2019t make much of a splash when he did, and self-funded construction. The unit layouts weren\u2019t ideal, brokers and developers told me.\nLiens began to pile up, including nearly $7 million sought by the former general contractor. One vendor sued. That\u2019s when everything went dark. Residents on the island were not happy.\nI don\u2019t know exactly when Dimond\u2019s Bayshore Grove finalized its deal, but it made sense when I learned that she would be reviving the project. She made changes to the layout and floor plans, moved the lobby from the sixth floor (unusual choice by the original developer) to the ground floor, and plans to install larger windows for better views.\nOnce the building is completed in 2026, it will mark eight years since Pacific &amp; Orient secured its approvals.\nDimond\u2019s sales team, led by Brown Harris Stevens\u2019 Ellis Bachman, is tasked with selling nearly all of the units. Pacific &amp; Orient only had two buyers with contracts at the North Bay Village project. One was refunded, and another is staying in the deal, Dimond told me.\nWhile many developers seemed to shy away from the project, she saw it as an opportunity to be the first one out of the gate.\nNorth Bay Village has attracted tens of millions of dollars of investment, if not more, in recent years. But no one has gotten this far. Even though others (Eichner, Shoma, Sunbeam, Riviera Horizons, etc.) have launched sales of their projects, garnering much more attention than what is now called Tula ever did, Dimond\u2019s project is the furthest along, construction-wise.\nWhile there are downsides to picking up a project midway through construction, the upsides may outweigh them.\n\nIt will become harder and more expensive to complete a building from scratch today, given the situation with tariffs, concerns over construction labor as a result of immigration policies, inflation and more.\nBuyers are also less enthusiastic about waiting four, five, six years for a project to be completed. This is at a time when dozens of new condo developments are in the pipeline. Despite developer and broker talk of strong presales, we\u2019re hearing that a small number of projects are stalled.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nSo many Live Local Act project applications have been filed in South Florida. Are these developments getting built? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential:\nDeveloper James Curnin and his wife Jennifer sold their waterfront 9,640-square-foot home at 66 La Gorce Circle in Miami Beach\nfor $60 million\n. A land trust named after the address purchased the property.\nCommercial loan:\nPPG Development and BH3 Management secured a\n$225 million refinancing\nof the loan backing Slate Hallandale Beach, a 250-unit apartment tower next to the Shell Bay Club. J.P. Morgan and Monroe Capital provided the latest financing for the building, which was completed in 2022. The lenders have both worked closely with Witkoff, which is partnering with PPG on the adjacent Shell Bay project.\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nA new oceanfront estate in Palm Beach hit the market\nfor $45 million\n. The six-bedroom, seven-bathroom and one-half-bath mansion at 1742 South Ocean Boulevard was completed last year on a 0.6-acre lot. Christian Angle of Christian Angle Real Estate has the listing for the 8,170-square-foot house. Property records show a company managed by recycling mogul Anthony Lomangino paid $10 million for the lot in 2020 \u2014 a steal in Palm Beach.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\nThe Great Elephant Migration, an art installation of 100 life-size elephant sculptures, is actually\nstill in South Florida\n. You may remember it as one of the most photographed Art Basel exhibits last year. Three elephants are on display at Four Seasons Hotel and Residences Fort Lauderdale, available to the public, while another four are at Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach. They\u2019ll be there until Tuesday.\nElsewhere in Florida\nSwerdlow Group agreed to implement a voluntary heat safety program for construction workers at its $3 billion project in Little River and Little Haiti,\nPrism\nreports. The Miami-Dade Housing Committee recently reviewed the development agreement for the 63-acre mixed-use development. Swerdlow is the first to make such a voluntary move after state lawmakers passed House Bill 433, which bans local governments from mandating heat protections.\nDevelopers are increasingly building homes on former orange groves, marking another threat to Florida\u2019s orange industry, according to the\nAssociated Press\n. Consumers are also drinking less orange juice, and citrus greening disease has hit the industry hard in recent decades.\nRepublican and Democratic lawmakers grilled state insurance regulators about a report that showed insurers funneled billions of dollars to affiliates between 2017 and 2019 while they claimed to lose money. The regulators told lawmakers that the report was never given to the legislature because it was unfinished, the\nTampa Bay Times\nreports. Former Insurance Commissioner David Altmaier commissioned the report, but after he abruptly left his post to become a lobbyist, it was left in draft form.",

        "content": "Sam Nazarian, once known as the \u201cEmperor of Cool\u201d in the nightlife industry has turned over a new leaf.\nIn 2008, Bloomberg celebrated his kingdom of hotspots in Los Angeles, and if you\u2019ve ever eaten at Katsuya or stayed at an SLS hotel you can understand why. The founder of SBE knows how to make hotspots buzzy for a work-hard, play-hard crowd of A-listers.\nBy 2019, Nazarian had nine offices around the world and 11,000 employees. \u201cI was the majority owner of my company, and I was the most unhealthy I\u2019d ever been,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the same ambition and drive that I\u2019d had.\u201d\nThat year, he\nsold the hotel brands in a cash-and-asset swap to Accor\n.\n\u201cI was looking for a reset,\u201d he said. The deal included a three-year non-compete clause in the lifestyle sector, giving him time to contemplate his next \u201cdisruption.\u201d\nNazarian turned to friends who were feeling the same burn-out. They turned him on to health types like\nMark Hyman\nand \u201cbiohacker\u201d Gary Brecka. From there, his wellness journey took him to luxury longevity retreats like SHA and Lanserhof and Chenot.\nThen along came Tony Robbins.\nRobbins was early to some of wellness\u2019s more unconventional practices: \u201cTony was the first guy who was going in an ice bath, and everyone thought he was crazy,\u201d as Nazarian put it. Nazarian visited Robbins\u2019 Fountain Life longevity center in Orlando, Florida. There, a bevy of tests found a \u201cpretty aggressive\u201d aneurysm in his brain.\n\u201cOver the next 30 days, I saw four top neurosurgeons, got four opinions, did more testing and then had a seven hour brain surgery that removed the aneurysm,\u201d he told\nThe Real Deal.\nThe aneurysm is gone, but Nazarian\u2019s commitment to preventative health and his relationship with Robbins continue.\nNazarian and Robbins are working\ntogether on wellness-focused hotels\nand longevity centers with a new brand called the Estate. (They\u2019ve already\ninked a lease\nfor a center at the Reuben Brothers\u2019 Century Plaza, have a hotel under development in St. Kitts, and plan 25 locations by 2030.) Meanwhile, Nazarian and entertainer Marc Anthony, who\u2019s also a partner on the Estate, launched a new hotel brand. HQ, which is a partnership with Wyndham, will also have a wellness and longevity strategy.\nNazarian\u2019s next\nbusiness boom\nmay not have the same hard-partying style as the last one, and his weekends reflect that. With a wife, three kids and a home in Miami\u2019s Gables Estates neighborhood, weekends are more about kids\u2019 basketball games and family dinners than the nightlife scene or even business meetings.\nFriday\nEvening\nShabbat dinner with my wife and three kids. We do it every Friday night. We\u2019re not very religious, but my kids are eight, six and three so it\u2019s something we\u2019ve always had as part of our cultural component.\nMy mom flew in from L.A., so having her with us was a treat as well. I grew up in Los Angeles but we\u2019ve lived in Miami for five years now. This is our biggest market area, and we made a conscious effort in 2019 to raise our kids in Miami as well, so we got a place in Coral Gables, where the best schools are.\n\nWe also have access to more quality-of-life things here, like being out on the water. We have a place in the Bahamas as well. And obviously proximity to Europe, which is very important to us; my wife\u2019s European, so we have a home in Montenegro. It\u2019s just easier to get around the world from Miami.\nSaturday\nMorning\nI took my three-year-old son to soccer practice, then I took my daughters to tennis practice at Coral Oaks.\nAfternoon\nAt 12 p.m., I had lunch on my yacht with one of our bankers from CFG, Erik Howard. Actually, on the way there I went and saw a site, but we haven\u2019t announced that yet.\nThe rest of the day, we took the boat out to Fisher Island Bay as a family. In L.A., you\u2019re on the water, but you never go out in the water. Now we have a boat in the back of our house, a 48-foot bay boat, but we also ended up buying the yacht in 2021. That\u2019s a 42-meter Benetti. Nothing crazy, but big enough for us and a couple friends.\nUsually we keep it in the Caribbean, at our place in the Bahamas or we\u2019ll go to St. Barths or discover new islands. But it just so happened to be here, so we jumped on it. It\u2019s such a pleasure to have it and get to see the city from the water.\nSunday\nMorning\nI worked out in the morning. We have these oxygen and red light machines in our house, so I got in the hyperbaric chamber and red light in addition to the workout. Then I took the girls to Hebrew school.\nAfternoon\nI went to a meeting with our general contractor. We\u2019re actually building a permanent bio-hacking and longevity addition [on our house]. Our team from the Estates designed it. When you think about home gyms and spas, they\u2019ve been very traditional. We really believe that there are some key components \u2013 saunas, the red light and oxygen \u2014 that can pivotally change the different KPIs you\u2019re looking for, whether it\u2019s better sleep, deeper sleep \u2026 there are lots of benefits.\nRight now I have the machinery, and now we\u2019re integrating it into a new structure. Another part of it is a meditation room, kind of a quiet room. We have three young kids, they can\u2019t find you there.\nAfter that I took my son to the park before I coached my daughters\u2019 basketball game from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Then I had meetings from 4 p.m to 7 p.m on Sunday, because we had a board meeting on Monday.\nWant to hear more about Sam Nazarian\u2019s next chapter? TRD subscribers can join him at the next Salon Series event on April 3 to learn more.\nRSVP today\n.",

The tower is fully leased.\nFaisal Ashraf of Lotus Capital Partners represented the owners in the refinancing.\nHallandale Beach-based PPG and Paramus, New Jersey-based Premium Capital Resources bought the development site in 2018 for\n$43.3 million\n. The property includes the adjacent 127-acre former Diplomat Golf &amp; Tennis Club, which the firms redeveloped into the luxury Shell Bay Club.\nAfter Ari Pearl\u2019s PPG and Michael Herman\u2019s Premium completed Slate in 2022, Fort Lauderdale-based BH3 bought a 50 percent stake in the tower, according to the release. Premium Capital still has a stake in the building, a PPG spokesperson said.\n\nBH3 is led by co-founders Gregory Freedman and Daniel Lebensohn, as well as executive chairman Eric Edidin.\nThe recent refinancing replaces a\n$150 million\nrefinancing PPG and Premium had scored for the tower in 2022, records show.\nDesigned by Kobi Karp, Slate consists of one- to four-bedroom apartments, ranging from 859 square feet to 3,230 square feet, according to the release.

        "content": "The First Amendment may not save O Cinema from getting evicted for screening an Oscar winning documentary about the Gaza War and events that led to it.\nOn Wednesday, the\nMiami Beach\nCity Commission will consider Mayor Steven Meiner\u2019s request to terminate O Cinema\u2019s lease for a movie theater space inside a city-owned historic building at 1130 Washington Avenue, as well as end roughly $40,000 in grants to the nonprofit arthouse.\nMeiner moved to kick out O Cinema after it went ahead with sold-out showings of \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a film about the ongoing conflict between Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank. Directed by Palestinian activist Basel Adra and Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham, \u201cNo Other Land\u201d won best documentary feature at this year\u2019s Academy Awards.\nIn a newsletter to his constituents, Meiner called the film \u201ca false one-sided propaganda attack on the Jewish people that is not consistent with the values of our City and residents.\u201d\nMeiner and city officials did not respond to requests for comment. O Cinema co-founder Kareem Tabsch told\nThe Real Deal\nthat the nonprofit art house is ready to pursue \u201call courses to allow us to continue operating in Miami Beach.\u201d\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t ruled out what those measures would be,\u201d Tabsch said. \u201cI think it is very clear that when we decided to continue showing this film, [Meiner] introduced a resolution to pull our funding and cancel the lease.\u201d\nO Cinema is getting legal counsel from the Florida chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and Community Justice Project, \u201c Tabsch added.\nWhile some civil libertarians believe Miami Beach officials would be violating O Cinema\u2019s right to free speech by evicting the theater, the lease terms favor the city, according to commercial real estate experts.\n\nA copy of the agreement obtained by\nThe Real Deal\nshows that the city can terminate the lease \u201cwithout cause and without liability to the landlord\u201d as long as O Cinema is given 180 days prior written notice. O Cinema\u2019s five-year lease expired last year, but in April the city commission approved the tenant\u2019s option to renew for another two years, city records show.\n\u201cTo the extent it can be shown that canceling the lease was based [on the content of \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d] there would be a First Amendment violation claim,\u201d said Miami-based attorney Mitchell Jagodinski. \u201cThe question for the court would be whether the operator of the theater waived this claim via the lease contract.\u201d\nJagodinski is representing the developers of\nMiami Wilds\n, a canceled mixed-use project in unincorporated southwest Miami-Dade County that planned to feature a water park, 200-room hotel and 20,000 square feet of restaurants. Last year, Miami-Dade sued Mami Wilds to terminate a 2022 lease agreement to build the project on 66 acres of county-owned land.\nMiami Wilds\ncountersued by alleging Miami-Dade Mayor Danielle Levine Cava violated the developers\u2019 rights by allegedly killing the deal to appease environmental groups and boost her reelection chances.\nO Cinema likely waived a First Amendment claim by agreeing to the city\u2019s \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d clause, Jagodinski said. \u201cIt essentially gives the city full control to just cancel [the lease] whenever they want for whatever reason,\u201d he explained. \u201c[O Cinema] agreed to this type of situation eventually happening.\u201d\nMiami Beach\nelected officials are definitely within their purview to end the business relationship with O Cinema, said Jose Smith, a former city attorney for Miami Beach and North Miami Beach who also served on the Miami Beach City Commission from 1997 to 2005.\n\u201cI have not seen the entire documentary or the city\u2019s lease with O Cinema,\u201d Smith said via text. \u201cHowever, the First Amendment does not require the city to permit its tenant, in a city owned venue, to espouse anti-Semitic, hateful, one-sided propaganda, or to be subsidized by the city for doing so.\u201d\nYet, Norman Powell, a North Bay Village-based real estate lawyer who is also the city attorney for\nMiramar\n, isn\u2019t convinced the city of Miami Beach\u2019s \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d clause would trump a potential First Amendment violation claim by O Cinema.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the mayor\u2019s primary reason for terminating the lease is because he doesn\u2019t like this documentary being played there,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThe basis for termination is really not for convenience. It\u2019s being terminated to stifle free speech.\u201d",

Halfen and Rosenblatt financed the purchase with a $13.5 million loan from Amerant Bank, according to property records.\nRosenblatt and Halfen are both spec developers. In August, Rosenblatt sold a waterfront spec mansion in Bay Harbor Islands for\na record $22 million\n. In 2023, Halfen, who heads Treo Construction, sold a waterfront spec house in Golden Beach for\n$15 million\n.\n\nKrelstein bought the 8,300-square-foot Bay Point mansion for $11.2 million in 2020, records show. It was built in 1963 on 0.8 acres and has 190 feet of waterfront, according to records and the listing. It was renovated in 2023 and has six bedrooms and six bathrooms, records show.\nKrelstein first listed the mansion for $35 million in 2022, before upping the asking price to $42 million later that year. The price was subsequently slashed three times before the home was delisted in June, Zillow shows.\nIt\u2019s been a record year for luxury deals in Miami\u2019s\nBay Point\nneighborhood. In January, Fatos Rosenberg sold a 1.7-acre waterfront estate for\n$85 million\n, making it the most expensive home ever sold in Bay Point.

        "content": "Affordable housing developer Lewis Swezy plans an 80-unit age-restricted apartment project near the Earlington Heights Metrorail stop in Miami-Dade County.\nSwezy, through his Miami Lakes-based Centennial Management, wants to develop the six-story building with 60 one-bedroom apartments and 20 two-bedroom apartments on a 0.7-acre site at 4052 Northwest 22nd Avenue in an unincorporated area of the county, according to an application submitted to Miami-Dade this week. It will include rooftop amenities, 800 square feet of commercial space and 42 parking spaces.\nThe project, called Earlington Court Affordable Housing, will be for tenants 55 and older who earn from 30 percent to 80 percent of the area median income, Swezy said. A majority of the apartments will be for those earning 60 percent of AMI.\nMiami-Dade\u2019s annual AMI is $79,400, the Florida Housing Finance Corporation shows. To qualify for a unit designated for tenants at the 60 percent AMI bracket, a one-person household can\u2019t earn more than $47,700, and a two-person household can\u2019t earn more than $54,480.\nCentennial paid $875,000 for the five-lot vacant development site in 2019, records show.\nThe firm is asking the county for an administrative site plan review. It originally filed a request for a pre-application meeting in December.\nSwezy focuses on affordable housing, mainly using the state tax credit program that awards developers tax credits that they sell to investors and use the proceeds to finance projects. Centennial\u2019s portfolio spans more than 3,500 affordable units.\n\nIn recent proposals, Swezy filed an application to Miami-Dade last summer for an\neight-story, 132-unit\nage-restricted building at 13841 Southwest 252nd Street in the Princeton neighborhood.\nTax credits and other state and municipal government financing mechanisms make\naffordable housing\nmore resilient to elevated interest rates. While higher rates and other economic headwinds have\npaused\nsome planned\nmultifamily\nprojects, affordable rental development has continued. Also, demand is nearly ensured as many South Floridians are priced out of market-rate apartments due to\nrecord rent\nhikes in 2021 and 2022.\nAffordable housing also has proved a boon for developers. Last month, Swezy paid\n$14.8 million\nfor a six-bedroom Fisher Island home at 6923 Valencia Drive. He bought it from the widow of the late Russian real estate tycoon Dmitry Zelenov.\nDeveloper Michael Swerdlow wants to redevelop five Miami-Dade public housing complexes with\n5,730\naffordable and workforce apartments. On Tuesday, a county committee approved the project that would replace existing public housing complexes Victory Homes at 520 Northwest 75th Street, Newberg at 7200 Northeast Miami Court, Gwen Cherry 22 at 7101 Northeast Miami Court, Gwen Cherry 06 at the intersection of Northwest 71st Street and Northwest First Court, and New Haven Gardens at 7200 Northeast Second Avenue in Miami.\nThe P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group plans an\neight-story, 98-unit\nbuilding at 5350 West Flagler Street in Miami\u2019s Flagami. All units will be for households earning up to 30 percent of AMI.\nAffordable housing developers also have seized on the Live Local Act, a state law that allows bigger projects than permitted by a site\u2019s zoning and also grants property tax breaks to developers.\nRussell Galbut\u2019s GFO Investments family office proposes a\n410-unit Live Local Act project\nwith a 19-story and a 16-story building at 7350 Coral Way in Miami-Dade\u2019s Corral Terrace neighborhood. Dr. Jorge Perez, who specializes in neonatology and neonatal medicine, is a partner on the development and will lease a seven-story medical office building part of the project.\n",

It will relocate from 7,800 square feet at 777 South Figueroa Street and 9,973 square feet at 1100 Glendon Avenue, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.\nThe length of the lease, a Savills spokesperson said, is \u201cmulti-year.\u201d\nAsking rent in the building ranges from $6.50 to $7.50, according to a spokesperson for the landlord.\nThe Century City building, a 28-story, 627,000-square-foot, Class-A high-rise office building, is undergoing a $100 million redevelopment together with 1800 Avenue of the Stars by owner\nCentury City-based\nAnderson.

The seller was locally based LHMLP.\nThe deal works out to nearly $140,500 per room. Brokers Oliver Shah and Justin Myers of Atlas Hospitality Group represented the buyers. It\u2019s not clear what LHMLP paid for the property, and when.\nThe 87,500-square-foot economy class hotel, built in 1968, is near Interstate 5 at El Toro Road. Its rooms were recently offered for discount rates for refugees of January\u2019s fires in Pacific Palisades and Altadena.\nHotel sales in central and south OC have cooled, according to CoStar. Sales between Newport Beach and Dana Point were $125 million during the last \u201cvolume year,\u201d compared to a three-year average of $340 million a year.\nThe market didn\u2019t prevent Haley from doing well in its sale late last year of a 120-room Travelodge by Wyndham Orange County Airport/ Costa Mesa at 1400 Bristol Street\nIn December, the county agreed to buy the Travelodge from Haley for conversion into homeless housing under the state\u2019s\nProject Homekey program\n. The hotel purchase and conversion into 78 supported apartments was to cost\n$45 million\n.\n\nThe $45 million redevelopment project, dubbed Homekey Bristol, included a $4 million contribution from Costa Mesa and $3 million from neighboring Newport Beach. Orange County kicked in $7 million and nearly 50 project-based vouchers. The grants totalled\n$14 million\n.\nThe bulk of the money came from a Project Homekey grant from the state Department of Housing and Community Development, which kicked in\n$29 million\nfor the project led by American Family Housing. The Midway City-based nonprofit developer was to revamp the motel and run it as supportive housing.\nSuch grants generally cover the purchase of the property. In the case of the Travelodge, that means Haley likely sold the 120-room hotel for $29 million, or $241,667 per room.\nHaley Hospitality bought the Travelodge, built in 1970, in 2021 for\n$14 million\n, or $116,667 per room, according to the Central OC Times. The purchase came at the height of the pandemic, when the\nhotel industry tanked\nwhile\ntens of thousands of rooms\nwent dark.\nThree years later, the county, via a grant from the state, bought the 54-year-old motor inn for a 107 percent markup for its last traded price. And Haley walked away with a windfall.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

This month, the Planning Commission approved the revised environmental impact report for the project known as New Beatrice West.\nPlans include 3,400 square feet of shops and restaurants. An existing office building, home to Gehry Partners, would be retained.\nThe U-shaped, 135-foot-tall project, designed by Gehry, will have upper level setbacks to create terrace decks.\nConstruction is expected to take 18 months. A project cost and when NSB is expected to break ground were not disclosed.\n\nKarney Management, a property owner nearby, had repeatedly appealed the office building to attempt to force the project to undergo further environmental review, without success.\nThe company led by Aliza Karney Guren\nsued the City of Los Angeles\nto block the project. In January 2020, a Los Angeles judge ruled that the mitigated negative declaration conducted for the project had not sufficiently considered impacts to aesthetics, noise and traffic congestion.\nAs a result, the Planning Department was forced to redo the environmental review process, although project entitlements were not overturned by the decision, according to Urbanize.\nNew Beatrice West is the second collaboration between Larry Field, founder of NSB Associates, and his longtime friend Frank Gehry. In 2023, NSB completed its two-building,\n80,000-square-foot offices\n, designed by Gehry,\nin El Segundo\n.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

One is, that can\u2019t happen. It has to go back to voters. And the other is that it might be able to happen with action from the council and the mayor\u2019s office.\n\u201cWe\u2019re having that investigated through our attorneys right now,\u201d Bass said.\nShe hasn\u2019t spoken further about the topic since.\nZach Seidl, the mayor\u2019s communications deputy, didn\u2019t answer specific questions from\nThe Real Deal\nabout Bass\u2019 plans, but said in a statement to\nThe Real Deal\nFriday, \u201cwe are going to look at every possible option to support fire survivors and accelerate recovery.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear how the mayor or City Council could defy the results of the local ballot measure, which went into effect in 2023 and imposes a 4 percent tax on property sales above $5 million and a 5.5 percent tax on sales over $10 million.\n\nThe\nCity Charter states\nthat ballot measures can be overturned by voters in a subsequent election or by amending the City Charter to supersede the ballot measure.\nA spokesperson for L.A. City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMeasure ULA aimed to raise up to $1.1 billion in tax revenue to fight homelessness and build affordable housing. It has so far fallen far short of that goal, raising\nabout $300 million in its first year on the books\n.\nFewer than 5 percent of deals meet the threshold to be subject to the tax, but historically they account for about 40 percent the city\u2019s total property tax revenue, according to an analysis by Mott Smith, a founding member of the Council of Infill Builders and adjunct professor at the USC Price School of Public Policy.\nDuring her 2022 campaign for mayor, Bass\nnever took a stance supporting\nthe ballot measure, but she\napplauded a court ruling\ndismissing a lawsuit against it the following year.\nAnd later that year the former deputy mayor for housing took some heat saying real estate investors were having \u201c\na bit of a temper tantrum\n\u201d about the transfer tax, as\nTRD\npreviously reported.\n",

The campus at 1716 East 7th Street includes 364,000 square feet of studio space, offices, production support facilities and parking.\nIf all goes as planned, the project will break ground in 2027 and be completed two years later.\nOnce done, it could help to create a critical mass of residential, office and retail uses at the intersection of Alameda and 7th streets. Prologis\u2019 project is less than a half-mile walk to the\nRow DTLA retail and office complex\nor the recently opened Ava Arts District apartments, both located on Alameda Street.\nPoll finds support for building restrictions in fire-torn areas\nResults from a poll conducted by the Berkley Institute of Governmental Studies, co-sponsored by the Los Angeles Times, showed L.A. County residents were open to\nrestricting home building in fire-prone areas\n\u2014 to the tune of 70 percent of the nearly 5,200 registered voters surveyed between Feb. 17 and Feb. 26.\nMeanwhile, those same poll participants were a little more than halfway split down the middle on building higher-density projects, with 55 percent in support of said developments in urban areas.\nThe poll results call into question whether other cities in the county would be open to offsetting any housing shortage created should there be restrictions on building in fire-ravaged areas. In such a case, more time would no doubt be tacked onto efforts to quickly rehouse those who wish to return to homes damaged or destroyed by the fires.\nBuilder\u2019s remedy claims another win, this time in foothills\nSticking with the subject of building, this week brought more news for housing proponents by way of builder\u2019s remedy.\nA legal battle between a proposed mixed-use development and the\ncity of La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge\nis over. City officials gave up fighting the project, which would have consisted of apartments, hotel rooms and over 7,300 square feet of office space at 600 Foothill Boulevard.\n\nDeveloper Cedar Street used the builder\u2019s remedy loophole in state housing law to bypass city zoning requirements in exchange for including low-income homes. The city pushed back. However, a judge\u2019s order to either pay a $14 million bond or back off resulted in the latter by the city.\nLa Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge is the latest example in a rising tension playing out publicly between state and local governments.\nResi\u2019s whopping land listing\nIntrigue abounds around who might buy a\n$175 million, multi-parcel land listing\n.\nThe 33 acres, spread across 15 parcels in Benedict Canyon comes with a controversial past. Developer Gary Safady once aimed to build on site a Bulgari-branded hotel with 59 rooms, plus eight single-family residences ranging in size from 12,000 to 48,000 square feet.\nThe proposed project was axed in 2023 after then-planning director Vincent Bertoni caved to pressure from project critics and wrote a letter to Safady that called out project impacts well beyond what the city originally expected.\nSafady pulled a $30 million loan on the property from Motcomb Estates, the real estate investment arm for the Reuben Brothers. Records show Safady defaulted on the loan in November with Motcomb alleging a nearly $50 million unpaid balance at the time, pushing the parcels to the sales block.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether another developer might have a go at the property and buy it for purposes of another project. Any proposal is likely to face much of the same scrutiny Safady had in moving the Bulgari Resort Los Angeles forward.\nKeeping up with the OC\nCompared to a $175 million listing, the $16.3 million trade of a Laguna Niguel mansion may seem small. However, the closing marked an all-time record for the city.\nThe sale of the Spanish-style mansion in the gated community of Bear Brand Ranch also set a price-per-square-foot record in Laguna Niguel. The home at\n7 Searidge\npenciled out to $1,993 per square foot. That\u2019s well beyond the $625-per-square-foot held by the city\u2019s former residential record: a two-lot deal that closed in 2014 for $15 million.\nAs Orange County sees more unique developments come online, such as Almquist\u2019s River Street Marketplace in San Juan Capistrano, it\u2019s helping lend an air of cool and renewed desirability in the residential communities south of Los Angeles County.\n",

        "content": "State Farm General got its wish to hike home insurance rates by an average of 22 percent.\nThe news comes weeks after being\nstraight-armed\nby California\u2019s chief insurance regulator for a request to increase rates because of the Los Angeles wildfires.\nCalifornia Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara \u201cprovisionally\u201d granted the unit of Illinois-based State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance the emergency rate increase requested after billions in wildfire claims,\nthe Los Angeles Times reported\n.\nBut the increase \u2014 which includes a 38 percent rate increase for rental buildings and 15 percent for renters and condo owners \u2014 won\u2019t take effect until a hearing slated for April 8.\nLara approved the increase on March 14 after\nturning down the request last month\n, saying the insurer had failed to prove it was warranted.\nHe\u2019d given the insurer an opportunity, however, to provide more evidence to justify the request.\nIn making his decision, Lara called on State Farm to halt any pending nonrenewals of customers statewide and for the insurer\u2019s parent company to provide its California insurer an infusion of $500 million to stabilize its capital position, according to the Times.\n\u201cThe role of insurance commissioner involves balancing a stable and sustainable insurance market that serves consumers with effective oversight,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cTo ensure long-term choices for Californians, I had to make an unprecedented decision in the short term.\u201d\n\u201cThe facts will be revealed in an open, transparent hearing,\u201d he added.\n\nState Farm has faced years of losses and huge damage claims after the\nJan. 7 fires\nthat raged Pacific Palisades to Altadena, and leveled more than 12,000 homes.\nAs of March 11, State Farm General and its parent have received more than 12,000 fire and auto claims related to the wildfires, and paid\nmore than $2.2 billion to customers\n.\nState Farm General has estimated it will pay out $7.9 billion in the wake of the Palisades, Eaton and other L.A. County fires.\nBut, its net losses from the fires will be closer to $600 million after reinsurance payments, which largely will come from its parent company. Reinsurance is bought by insurers from other insurers to protect themselves from catastrophic events.\nLast March, the company announced it would\nnot renew 72,000 home, apartment and other property policies\nin California, citing wildfire risks and other concerns.\nThat followed a\ndecision in May 2023\nto stop writing insurance for new businesses, homeowners, and other personal property and casualties in the state, with the exception of personal auto policies.\nIn June, State Farm\nrequested a 30 percent rate increase for its homeowners policies\n, as well as other rate hikes, which await a decision. The request took state officials by surprise, with Lara saying it raised \u201cserious questions about its financial condition.\u201d\nState Farm General last month said it\u2019s lost $2.8 billion over the last nine years, including gains from investment income. State Farm Group, led by State Farm General\u2019s parent company, was given a superior financial rating in December by a rating agency.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Forever 21 is preparing to potentially close hundreds of stores, including more than a dozen in Southern California, as part of its ongoing bankruptcy.\nThe Los Angeles-based apparel firm, hurt by plunging sales and competition from overseas e-commerce merchants, will make cuts across Los Angeles and Orange counties,\nthe Orange County Register reported.\nThe pending closures come after the 41-year-old company l\nocked the doors of its Downtown L.A. headquarters\nlast month at the California Market Center at 110 East 9th Street, in the Fashion District.\nAfter decades of family ownership, the retail chain was sold in 2020 to investors who now seek a new owner.\nThe company is preparing to close down its remaining 350 stories as part of its bankruptcy filing,\naccording to Bloomberg\n, citing anonymous sources.\nEfforts to find a buyer for the fast-fashion retailer to avoid a liquidation have so far failed, they said. Talks with one potential bidder are ongoing\nForever 21 reported to the state it would be closing eight stores across Southern California \u2014 but the closures appear to be more widespread, with hundreds of employees to hit the bricks, according to the Register.\nThe official closures include stores at the The Outlets at Orange, Main Place Mall in Santa Ana, Galleria at Tyler Mall in Riverside, Ontario Mills in Ontario, Victoria Gardens in Rancho Cucamonga, Montclair Place in Montclair, Lakewood Center Mall and at Los Cerritos Mall\nThe company said the layoffs and store closures are permanent, beginning April 25 and continuing through May 9, letters submitted to California\u2019s Employment Development Department.\n\nReaders of the Register also reported stores at Westfield Fashion Square in Sherman Oaks, The Shops at Santa Anita in Arcadia, South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, Promenade Temecula and Inland Center in San Bernardino had closing signs on their storefront windows.\nThe company,\nwith 58 stores in California\n, announced in February that it would shutter at least 200 stores nationwide.\nThe retailer was founded in 1984 by husband and wife Do Won and Jin Sook Chang as Fashion 21, in Los Angeles, with its first store on Figueroa Street.\nRenamed Forever 21, the chain grew into a nationwide brand known for its trendy and cheap clothing for teens and 20-somethings. At its peak in 2015, the company reported $4.4 billion in sales and 1,300 stores worldwide.\nBut over the years, the company faced numerous controversies, including accusations of wage theft, the use of cadmium in its jewelry, controversial slogans on T-shirts and the cheap labor used abroad to sew its clothing.\nIn 2020, its assets were sold in bankruptcy for $81 million to a group of investors that included Authentic Brands Group, Simon Properties and Brookfield Properties. That group, known as SPARC, owned retail brands including Lucky, Eddie Bauer, Aeropostale, Brooks Brothers and Nautica.\nIn January, SPARC said\nit was merging with JCPenney\n, creating a new group called Catalyst Brands, which left off Forever 21 from its list of brands. Instead, the company said it was seeking a new operator for the retailer.\nToday, fast fashion in the U.S. has been overrun with competition from Chinese e-commerce companies such as Temu and Shein, which produce and sell items for pennies, according to the Register.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "The first to retreat was Beverly Hills, which laid down its arms in the battle against the state builder\u2019s remedy.\u00a0 And now La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, which threw in the towel after a two-year fight.\nThe La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge City Council voted to withdraw from its campaign to block a five-story apartment-hotel-office project proposed by Cedar Street Partners under the anti-NIMBY law at 600 Foothill Boulevard, the\nLos Angeles Daily News\nand\nBisnow\nreported.\nThe reason: the foothill city chose to quit an uphill legal battle after a Los Angeles judge ordered it pay a $14 million bond to appeal\na court decision to greenlight the project\n.\n\u201cContinuing the lawsuits is no longer in the best interest of the city,\u201d Mayor Mike Davitt said in a\nstatement\nsaying that the financial costs of its appeal outweighed its potential outcome.\nThe decision by La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge to back down may mark a Waterloo for opponents of the builder\u2019s remedy, a once-obscure provision in state housing law that has empowered developers while frustrating cities and counties across the state.\nThe builder\u2019s remedy allows housing developers to skirt local zoning\nin cities such as Beverly Hills\nthat failed to certify their state-mandated housing plans, provided their projects include 20 percent affordable housing.\nBeverly Hills, which had vigorously fought a slew of state-sanctioned builders remedy projects,\nbroached a compromise\nwith developers last month.\nNow La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge must come to terms with Cedar Street, led by Jonathan Curtis, a former city councilman and mayor who bought the property during his term in office.\nThe locally based developer had employed the 35-year-old legal loophole to allow the 80-unit complex with 16 hotel rooms and 7,300 square feet of offices, with 16 apartments set aside for low-income households.\n\nThe project, designed by Mid-City-based Riley Projects, would replace a former First Church of Christ Scientist, blocks from a large commercial district.\nCedar Street Partners had filed a\nlawsuit in July 2023\n, after a yearlong back-and-forth with the city and repeated denials. Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta\nasked a court\nto support the project, as well as the state builder\u2019s remedy provision.\nThe decision by the city to back down sends a disquieting message to cities trying to push back against housing laws, Ryan Leaderman, a partner at Holland &amp; Knight, who previously represented the 600 Foothill project, told Bisnow.\n\u201cThe message is: stop playing games with housing,\u201d Leaderman said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a price to pay when a city unlawfully denies a project.\u201d\nDespite the city\u2019s decision to abandon its appeal, the Foothill Boulevard project must still clear several hurdles before winning local approval. While the builder\u2019s remedy waives zoning rules, such projects still must comply with environmental, infrastructure and health and safety standards, according to the Daily News.\n\u201cThe City and community will need to chart a pathway forward that integrates the 600 Foothill project as reasonably as possible, and we hope going forward the developer will work with us to minimize any detrimental impacts on the City,\u201d Mayor Davitt said in his statement.\n\u201cThe ball\u2019s in their court,\u201d Cedar Street partner Jonathan Curtis told Bisnow.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

County. The survey\u2019s estimated margin of error is 2 percentage points, and larger for demographic subgroups.\nA 2019 Berkeley IGS poll\nsaw support from three-quarters of California voters\n, including 79 percent in L.A.

        "content": "Office properties hit hard by the pandemic often end up in the hands of their lenders or bargain-hunting buyers before they get a chance at a revival.\nYet for a West Loop office portfolio that plunged from 90 to 50 percent occupied, co-owner R2 has managed to remain in the drivers\u2019 seat and go debt-free through a new partnership. Public records show its joint venture with Beltway Capital Management \u2014 finalized last month with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure that took its former co-owner Heitman out of the picture \u2014 also adds a fifth building to the 350,000-square-foot portfolio.\nR2 bought six West Loop loft office buildings in 2016 for $86 million in a joint venture with Chicago-based Walton Street Capital. R2 later recapitalized a four-building portion of the portfolio in a joint venture with Chicago-based Heitman in 2019. The Heitman venture paid $65 million for the portfolio with a $42 million loan from Truist Financial. It\u2019s unclear how much R2 paid to maintain its stake in the properties.\nThe joint venture struggled to hold onto the four assets, located at 641 West Lake Street, 901 West Jackson Boulevard and 130 South Jefferson Street, after the pandemic hit.\nMaryland-based Beltway, which specializes in buying distressed debt, bought the loan note from Truist last May, when the properties and their owners faced a murky path forward. The loan was labeled nonperforming at the time of its sale, meaning it likely traded for less than its face value.\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for distressed debt buyers to file foreclosure actions shortly after acquiring a struggling loan.\nWhen Truist put the $42 million debt on the market, R2 and Heitman hadn\u2019t technically defaulted on the loan, but it was in cash management, people familiar with the offering said. That means its excess cash flow was being used to cover debt service costs.\nIn this case, Beltway tapped R2 as its partner in managing the assets. R2 CEO Matt Garrison declined to share how much the firm invested into the portfolio to maintain its stake or what terms dictated Heitman\u2019s departure from the joint venture.\nRepresentatives of Heitman did not respond to requests for comment.\nGarrison said R2 will be investing in \u201caggressive retention efforts for existing tenants,\u201d and upgrades to common areas.\n\nIt was worth it for R2 to hang onto the assets because loft offices are often the type of buildings targeted for residential conversions, he said, meaning the number of competing properties could dwindle. Others aren\u2019t in a position to fund the costs of competing for tenants.\n\u201cMany of the (loft office) owners are undercapitalized or lack a rationale to invest capital in new leases, because their properties are worth less than the debt,\u201d Garrison said. \u201cThis makes the effective inventory even smaller. We think there will always be demand for well executed loft buildings in the West Loop, and supply and demand looks better today for the right buildings than it has in a long time.\u201d\nA few months before it bought the distressed note from Truist, Beltway also pounced on another struggling loan issued by Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada to the Feil Organization for a loft office building at 730 North Franklin Street. Beltway also partnered with R2 to take over that asset.\nNow the firms co-own all five properties outright. Debt-free buildings\nhave emerged as an appealing strategy\nfor office investors seeking flexibility in making significant building upgrades and attracting tenants with competitive lease terms.\n\u201cDebt is just financial engineering. It isn\u2019t required from this entry basis to generate great returns,\u201d Garrison said. \u201cOne of the first questions tenant reps ask is about debt. Is the building in trouble, etc. Owning a property in all cash is the best answer to this question.\u201d\nWhether the new approach will kickstart a turnaround for the full portfolio remains to be seen.\nThe office at 901 West Jackson is 90 percent occupied but the offices at 641 West\u00a0 Lake and 130 South Jefferson are 50 percent occupied. Garrison said the firm is negotiating several leases across the properties.\n\u201cIn the office business, it is hard to stay flat,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are either growing or you are declining. The Chicago office market is really two markets today, with almost half of the buildings effectively offline.\u201d\n",

The firm added 6,600 square feet in 2023.\n\nThe city\u2019s average office lease size has increased for the first time since the pandemic, a promising sign of resilience, O\u2019Leary said.\nIt\u2019s likely too soon to tell if the broader office market in Chicago is headed for a noticeable turnaround. The downtown office vacancy rate hit 26.3 percent in the fourth quarter, up from 23.8 percent at the end of 2023 and more than double the 13.8 percent rate recorded at the start of the pandemic, according to CBRE.\nHenry Crown and Co. bought the 27-story building at 222 North LaSalle for $112 million in 2006 with a $100 million loan from the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America.\nThe investment firm dates back to 1959 and is tied to one of Chicago\u2019s wealthiest families. One of its scions, the businessman and philanthropist Jim Crown, died in 2023, and his Gold Coast condo at\n65 Goethe Street\n, was listed the following year for $17.5 million.\n",

It\u2019s a sharp drop from the $60 million Gaw Capital paid for it in 2016.\nThe buyers have added the Ambassador to a cluster of independently managed hotels operated by the Chicago Hotel Collection, which also manages three other properties downtown and in Wrigleyville.\nSeller Gaw Capital invested $11 million in renovations and rebranded the hotel under the Hyatt Joie de Vivre collection in 2020.\n\nThe pandemic forced the hotel to shut down for nearly a year, and it struggled to recover amid a slow rebound for the city\u2019s hospitality sector.\nDowntown Chicago hotels remain below pre-pandemic levels, when adjusted for inflation, despite some signs of a recovery. Revenue per available room was 11 percent higher last year than in 2019, but inflation-adjusted figures show the sector still lagging, according to CoStar.\nThe buyers must stabilize the hotel\u2019s operations fast if they want to turn a profit.

        "content": "Hamilton Partners is maneuvering to save a struggling suburban Chicago office deal without getting much help from its distressed ownership companion, Accesso Partners, which faces foreclosures at a handful of properties in the area.\nItasca-based Hamilton is a minority owner of the Esplanade I, a 609,000-square-foot office complex at 2001 Butterfield Road in Downers Grove, a property that had its $69 million loan transferred last month to special servicer CW Capital, a sign of financial trouble for the landlord.\nAccesso, based in the Miami suburb of Hallandale Beach, has the larger ownership stake in the 19-story property of the two firms, but it\u2019s either unable or unwilling to commit the capital necessary to work out the debt trouble alongside Hamilton, said Hamilton partner Ron Lunt.\nAs a result, Hamilton is seeking to delay the maturity of the property\u2019s loan, which comes due in July of next year, and is starting debt workout talks with CW Capital around how to fund the costs of turning the property around, such as tenant allowances for workspace buildouts and leasing broker commissions, Lunt said.\n\u201cWe have some lease talks going, but if we\u2019re going to spend a ton of money, we would like to work out an extension of some sort,\u201d Lunt said. \u201cOffices are low priority for lenders today, which is why you need to start the discussion early.\u201d\nCW Capital declared the loan is headed toward \u201cimminent monetary default,\u201d although Lunt said the loan terms were only breached on a technicality because its previous loan servicer, Iowa-based Principal, was allowing rents to be collected and debt costs to be paid later in the month than the special servicer.\nCW is reviewing Hamilton\u2019s request for a modification to the deal terms, and it\u2019s unclear when it will come to a resolution. Accesso, meanwhile, will have its equity in the property diluted further with each dollar Hamilton kicks into the deal as it attempts to rescue the loan from the brink of distress, Lunt said.\nAccesso didn\u2019t return requests for comment. It surrendered its office tower at 20 North Clark Street in the Chicago Loop to its lender earlier this year, and it is also facing a\n$75 million foreclosure at 200 West Monroe Street\n, which is next door to a property the firm previously sold at a major loss from its previous purchase price. Accesso made other\nsuburban office investments that recently ended up in foreclosure\n, too. The firm bought several of those properties from Hamilton, and entered the Esplanade deal in a 2015 joint venture.\nAccesso also lost a\nHouston office portfolio\nto financial distress last year.\n\nThe suburban Chicago property was appraised at $105 million ($172 per square foot) in 2016, when the joint venture\u2019s commercial mortgage-backed securities loan was originated. That\u2019s far more than what it\u2019s likely worth today as interest rates and subdued demand from tenants have eaten into property values. The loan\u2019s $57.3 million balance pencils out to $94 per square foot.\nThe property\u2019s financial trouble was triggered in part by the 2023 exit of Hillshire Brands, an affiliate of Tyson Foods, that previously leased a 72,000-square-foot annex building that serves as a research and development facility on the Downers Grove campus.\nThat space hasn\u2019t been refilled, and the asset is only 72 percent leased, about average for suburban Chicago office buildings amid one of the worst downturns of all time for the sector. The lackluster occupancy has sunk the property\u2019s revenue to well below the level required to meet debt service obligations, public loan data shows.\nThe property\u2019s debt-service coverage ratio was just 0.43 for 2024 through the end of September, loan data compiled by Morningstar Credit shows \u2014 anything less than 1.0 is below breakeven, meaning the Esplanade property was bringing in less than half the rent needed to cover its costs.\nStill, Hamilton is working with a brokerage team focused on food processing companies to help lease the space Hillshire vacated, with the hope it can get the deal back on track in time to dodge penalties with its lender.\nYet it\u2019ll be vying for tenants with other office properties in the suburbs that have already been through foreclosure or deeply discounted sales in\nnearby suburban markets\n, allowing their buyers to offer lower rents in some cases, Lunt noted.\n\u201cMajor projects in\nSchaumburg\nhave gone through ownership changes and the bases are all reset, and it makes it tougher competition,\u201d Lunt said.\n",

        "content": "Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi has fixed hundreds of property misclassifications after a months-long audit, but questions remain over how many errors are still unresolved.\nAt least 620 properties were\nmisclassified or undervalued\nduring the 2023 tax year, resulting in an estimated $444 million in missed taxable value.\nThe assessor\u2019s office has since corrected 491 of those errors, adding nearly $489 million in taxable value to county rolls \u2014 about 17 percent of the new construction value added countywide in 2023, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. An investigation by Illinois Answers and the outlet reported the misclassified properties last year.\nStill, 129 properties identified in the investigation remain incorrectly classified, with fixes delayed due to a backlog at the Cook County Board of Review and what Kaegi\u2019s office described as \u201cquirks in the tax calendar.\u201d\nThe office also blamed inconsistent permit data from local municipalities as a key factor behind delayed corrections.\nThe misclassifications carried major financial consequences.\nSome homeowners, like those in suburban Lynwood, have already received back tax bills as high as $23,000 after belated reassessments. State law allows for up to three years of back taxes, though Kaegi\u2019s office maintains that it won\u2019t issue back taxes in cases where it failed to act on construction permits it had on file.\nIn 46 out of 55 back-taxed cases, Kaegi\u2019s office did have relevant permit information, but missed it.\n\nMany affected properties were either new construction or had undergone significant renovations, but the assessor\u2019s records failed to reflect those changes. In some cases, properties were still being taxed based on outdated classifications.\nFor instance, a home in Gilmore Park built in 2021 and sold for $843,000 continued to be assessed as a vacant lot, with its value listed at less than $45,000.\nKaegi\u2019s office has since hired a dozen more staffers, including two permit specialists and 10 field inspectors, and promoted a veteran staffer to oversee data integrity. The office also plans to launch a sales validation team this year to help catch discrepancies, such as multimillion-dollar sales on properties incorrectly recorded as vacant.\nKaegi is pushing for broader systemic changes.\nLast week, he\ncalled on the Federal Housing Finance Agency\nto release appraisal data from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to local assessors. Kaegi argued that access to this data \u2014\ncurrently restricted\n\u2014 would help improve the accuracy of property assessments, particularly in addressing long-standing issues like regressivity, where lower-value homes are often over-assessed relative to their market value. His office released a public dataset on Monday morning with building permits submitted to the office by municipalities, another bid to bring transparency to the process.\nCritics argue the long delays and lingering errors undermine confidence in Cook County\u2019s property tax system \u2014 especially when homeowners can be hit with massive, unexpected tax bills for mistakes they had no hand in.\nKaegi\u2019s office is reviewing the 46 back tax bills for errors, as delays in delivering the permits to the assessor\u2019s office can slow its ability to make corrections, a spokesperson said.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Chicago landlords are set up to strongarm rent hikes this year and beyond.\nLeases struck within a group of 84 downtown buildings tracked by brokerage Luxury Living\nsurpassed an average of $3,000 per month\nlast year for the first time ever. With new supply limited by developers grappling with higher interest rates and construction costs, landlords are projected to have the upper hand until 2027, the earliest that a significant wave of rental deliveries is expected.\nChicago\u2019s top city lawyers are taking aim at the\nmost negligent property owners\n, and\nThe Real Deal\nis taking a look inside their plights.\nSuzie Wilson, dubbed the city\u2019s \u201cworst landowner\u201d by public officials, is nearing a $11.5 million settlement that could also include\na ban from investing in Chicago property\n.\nThe settlement would resolve the nearly $50 million in debts and legal claims she\u2019s estimated to owe the city, and she\u2019s not alone. The city is ramping its pursuit of two more firms,\nGoldmine Investments and QCD Financial\n, that similarly assembled large portfolios of properties on the South and West sides through delinquent tax sales and racked up a combined $9 million in unpaid fines and interest owed to the city through allegedly neglecting their real estate.\n\nIn the office market, the recently stubborn CMBS spigot loosed up to\nrain down $610 million on the owners of the newly built Salesforce Tower\n, which includes Hines and Chicago-based Chris Kennedy\u2019s famous political family. The deal replaces $549 million in construction debt.\nOn the other side of the financial spectrum,\nBeacon Capital Partners\u2019 190 North LaSalle Street\nwas listed for sale with Cushman &amp; Wakefield, and, like several of its fellow office buildings in the central Loop, has potential to fall short of its debt with its ultimate sale price.\nThe\nFarpoint-led team redeveloping the former Michael Reese Hospital site\nin Bronzeville released its vision for the Chicago Bears\u2019 new stadium to be built on the land. While the NFL team hasn\u2019t expressed any interest in the site as of yet, the developer is hoping to sway the team away from its previously announced plans to either build a new stadium just south of Soldier Field or outside of the city in Arlington Heights.\nOut in the suburbs, developer\nAdvent Properties scrapped a 278-unit Des Plaines\napartments project, investor\nZell Kravinsky paid $19.3 million\nto FPA Multifamily for a 63-unit Algonquin apartment complex and FPA Multifamily turned around and bought a\nbig Naperville apartment complex for $68 million\n.\n",

        "content": "Hines, Chris Kennedy of a famous American political family and their investment partners in a 60-story skyscraper in Chicago have defied the pandemic-induced downturn for commercial office space.\nThe owners of\nSalesforce Tower\non the bank of the Chicago River are nearing the finalization of a $610 million long-term debt deal, marking a milestone in the aftermath of the pandemic-stricken economy, CoStar News\nreported\n. Should the deal close later this month as expected, the property \u2014 developed by Hines and the Kennedy family as well as the AFL-CIO\u2019s real estate investment arm \u2014 will stand as a contrarian bet that worked out amid economic uncertainty.\nThe commercial mortgage-backed securities loan reflects the tower\u2019s long-term valuation of $888 million, as appraised by Cushman &amp; Wakefield. Its current valuation of $745 million is expected to rise further following the repayment of tenant-improvement costs and free rent allowances.\nThe refinancing package, with Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs serving as the lenders, will replace the property\u2019s $549 million construction debt and is projected to carry an interest rate of 6.525 percent until its maturity in March 2030.\nConceived during the early days of the pandemic, Salesforce Tower has upended market trends by maintaining high occupancy levels, with leases covering over 95 percent of its 1.2 million square feet. Key tenants include Salesforce, which rents more than 477,000 square feet, and Kirkland &amp; Ellis, which is on a 677,000-square-foot lease; those deals run into the 2040s.\n\nMeanwhile, much of the rest of the Chicago office market is depressed, with record-high vacancy rates of more than 25 percent and\nmassive foreclosure lawsuits\nagainst office landlords winding through Cook County court.\nFor the Salesforce Tower developers and Chicago\u2019s broader office market, scoring the loan is a testament to the investment thesis that the world\u2019s largest companies remain interested in ultra-premium workspace and aren\u2019t afraid to invest heavily in it as a method to attract and retain top talent. Kirkland has poured over $207 million beyond its tenant-improvement allowance to create its ideal workspaces, while Salesforce has put up an additional $78 million for its interior buildout, the Moody\u2019s report cited by the outlet shows.\nMoody\u2019s put out a robust outlook on the deal, buoyed by a net operating income projected to reach about $51.2 million by the second year of the loan.\nEastdil Secured arranged the financing package for Salesforce Tower.\n",

        "content": "The developer with ambitious plans for the Bronzeville Lakefront put pictures with its pitch for a Chicago Bears stadium, although the team\u2019s plans are far from certain.\nFarpoint Development released renderings for a $3.2 billion domed stadium on the 49-acre site of the former Michael Reese hospital on the South Side, aiming to present an alternative to the team\u2019s two other options, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The team is also considering a redevelopment of the Arlington Heights racetrack and a domed stadium near Soldier Field.\nThe Bronzeville pitch includes an entertainment district, hotels and a 20-acre park bridging over Lake Shore Drive, connecting the stadium to the lakefront, proximity to which has been one of the National Football League team\u2019s main requirements.\nThe developer argues the site offers the best of both worlds: an urban core location and room for ancillary developments \u2014 retail, dining and multifamily projects \u2014 that could generate additional revenue for the team.\nThe stadium would be privately financed by the Bears, but the developer is pitching $600 million in state infrastructure funds to prepare the site for development, including utilities, roads and environmental work.\nThat departs from\nthe Bears\u2019 other lakefront proposal\n, which sought a $900 million upfront public subsidy. By financing the stadium privately, developers see the plan as more palatable to political leaders wary of direct public subsidies.\n\nStill, hurdles remain. The Bears haven\u2019t publicly engaged with the proposal as of late, but\nrescinded a rejection in the fall\nafter Farpoint updated its plans to take out a conflict with Metra tracks it previously planned to build over.\nInsiders suggest the team is still focused on either advancing its lakefront vision or moving forward in Arlington Heights. The narrow footprint of the Michael Reese site has also raised concerns about feasibility.\nAnother complication is the adjacent Prairie Shores apartment complex, partially owned by Farpoint. The developer says the stadium could fit without impacting the complex, but demolishing units has been floated as a way to maximize the site \u2014 an option that would likely draw political pushback.\nThe city still owns the majority of the site and would need to contribute land, as well as cover about $40 million in debt tied to its acquisition. Public financing could also come from tax increment financing and leveraging the site\u2019s federal opportunity zone status.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

The lawsuit, which is seeking class-action status, was filed Thursday in federal court in Massachusetts.\nThe South Suburban Housing Center and Open Communities in Evanston received the same letter and faces similar funding losses posed to disrupt decades of work supporting low-income and minority communities.\nThe nonprofit lost its two grants, which totaled about $1.4 million over the next three years, funds it has received since 1995. The amount represented 92 percent of its fair housing budget and 37 percent of its total organizational budget.\n\nChicago\u2019s Continuum of Care network \u2014 responsible for coordinating housing services for the homeless \u2014 has over $112 million in HUD grants still pending contracts. At least 14 organizations have been operating without reimbursement since January.\nThe cuts come amid broader federal workforce reductions at HUD, including layoffs at the agency\u2019s Chicago office.\nHUD Secretary Scott Turner, who was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on Feb. 5, has defended the changes, saying the agency is \u201ctaking inventory\u201d to improve efficiency. HUD officials have promised some clarity in the coming weeks, with letters to awardees expected soon.\nThe cuts are targeting racial justice initiatives and could erode protections for vulnerable groups, particularly as\nhousing discrimination\ncomplaints rise and\naffordable housing options shrink\n, the National Fair Housing Alliance said.\nFor other organizations, like Ignite, which provides services for homeless youth as the parent organization for Continuum of Care, the clock is ticking.\nIgnite has dipped into reserves to continue operations while awaiting its yearly $320,000 contract reimbursement. Others are turning to donors or state-level funding to close the gaps.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "A venture involving Zell Kravinsky\u2019s Morning Sky Capital scooped up a 63-unit apartment complex on the bank of the Fox River in the northwest suburbs of Chicago from multifamily giant Greg Fowler\u2019s firm, which previously bought it out of distress.\nKravinsky\u2019s company partnered with several other investors to pay $19.3 million for the ReNew on Main property at 1 North Main Street in Algonquin, public records show. The price of $302,000 per unit included assuming an existing mortgage with a balance of more than $11 million that the San Francisco-based seller, FPA Multifamily, previously took out on the property, sparing the buyer from shopping for debt at today\u2019s elevated interest rates.\nFor FPA, one of Chicagoland\u2019s largest multifamily landlords, the deal extends a streak of activity in the area that has tended to follow the same pattern: the firm is\nselling off its smaller assets\nand buying up bigger ones with funds the transactions generate. The Algonquin deal closed right as\nFPA bought a 356-unit Naperville apartment complex\nfor $68 million, in another deal where it assumed the existing debt of the seller, Chicago-based Rockwell Partners.\n\u201cThere is not a lot of liquidity in the market right now, which is good for people who have a conviction in the market and are ready to make a bet,\u201d said Morning Sky\u2019s Lev Kravinsky. \u201cIn general most of what we\u2019re buying nowadays is either all cash or loan assumption. It\u2019s difficult but not impossible to find deals that pencil with fresh debt.\u201d\nFPA didn\u2019t return a request for comment on the Algonquin transaction.\nWhile the deal is relatively small for FPA, the seller posted a gain on the property after buying it out of distress in 2018 for $12.7 million ($201,600 per unit). The complex, which also includes six ground-floor retail units, has a checkered ownership history after running into delays during its development, and financial trouble after its 2011 completion.\n\nFPA bought it from a financial institution, Boston-based UC Funds, which acquired the property through foreclosure. The property was conceived as a 54-unit luxury condo project, awarded to Aspen Homebuilders back in 2006 by the village of Algonquin. Aspen went bankrupt two years later, and the firm\u2019s owner, Bruce Hawkins, pleaded guilty in 2013 to defrauding a bank of more than $1 million, the Northwest Herald previously\nreported\n.\nThe building remained unfinished for years, until developer John Bruegelmans took over the project in 2011 and gained approval to convert the project into rentals. Residents started moving in during 2015, but Buregelmans filed for bankruptcy in 2016 to restructure construction debt, the newspaper reported.\nThat\u2019s what prompted a UC Funds entity to take over the building and eventually sell it to FPA.\nMeanwhile, buyers in Chicago and its suburban multifamily markets are\nset to raise rents\nin the coming year as new supply craters amid a development dropoff.\nMorning Sky owns several other apartment complexes in the area, with three in the suburbs and one in the city, Lev Kravinsky said. His father, Morning Sky principal Zell Kravinsky, is well-known as a philanthropist and longtime real estate investor.\n",

        "content": "Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi is pushing the federal government to release property appraisal data to the country\u2019s largest assessors to help improve the accuracy of property tax assessments, which have received criticism locally for being systemically flawed.\nA resolution sponsored by Kaegi calls for the Federal Housing Finance Agency to hand data containing \u201cmillions of property appraisals\u201d over to 16 of the nation\u2019s largest assessment offices, according to a news release.\nThe assessor made the request just a day before the Senate on Thursday confirmed President Trump\u2019s nominee\nBill Pulte as head of the FHFA\n, which collects appraisal records from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Pulte\u2019s stance on Kaegi\u2019s idea is unclear; Pulte is the grandson of the late William Pulte, who started one of the nation\u2019s largest homebuilders, Pulte Homes, in Detroit in the 1950s.\nThe Federal Housing Finance Agency compiles Fannie and Freddie appraisals into a Uniform Appraisal Dataset that contains parcel-level property characteristics. Most of this data is inaccessible to government assessors, but Kaegi and 15 other assessment offices across the country are hoping to change that.\nThe Kaegi-backed proposal\u2019s supporters said it would aid in addressing a common problem encountered by Cook County homeowners: Less expensive homes tend to be overvalued for taxes relative to their actual sale price, while pricier homes tend to be undervalued for taxes in an issue known as \u201cregressivity.\u201d\n\nThis means that working class and low income families end up paying more than their fair share in property taxes or can\u2019t pay at all, putting a strain on the local municipality that relies on property tax revenue to fund public services. This has been\nparticularly true for small towns in the South suburbs of Chicago\nthat have a higher concentration of working class homeowners hit with overvaluations.\n\u201cIn recent years, we\u2019ve eliminated a large portion of the regressivity in Cook County\u2019s residential assessments,\u201d Kaegi said in the release. \u201cWith the release of this data, we would be able to clear one of the final hurdles to achieving thoroughly fair and accurate assessments.\u201d\nA 2022 University of Chicago\nstudy cited the main causes of regressivity as \u201climitations in the data and methods used in assessment,\u201d specifically a lack of data about property characteristics that might factor into calculating a property\u2019s assessed value. A study by Josh Myers Valuation Solutions also attributed\nthe undervaluation of commercial properties\n, in part, to \u201clack of data-sharing.\u201d\nThe resolution got a boost from the National Association of Counties\u2019 Board of Directors, which endorsed the measure in a March 1 annual legislative conference, according to the release. Kaegi\u2019s co-sponsor on the bill is Eddie Cook, the assessor of Maricopa County, Arizona, which includes the city of Phoenix.\n",

The price wasn\u2019t disclosed.\nBeacon acquired the nearly 800,000-square-foot tower in late 2019 for $230 million ($288 per square foot) and is selling at a time when Loop office buildings are trading at significant discounts. A $167.5 million mortgage ($209 per square foot) from U.S. Bank also weighs it down \u2014 a balance that now likely exceeds the property\u2019s market value amid rising vacancies and declining demand.\nTwo of the building\u2019s largest tenants, Neuberger Berman and Bain &amp; Company, are expected to exit by 2027 and 2028, respectively.\nThe looming vacancies add to the building\u2019s uncertainty despite its anchor tenant U.S. Bank\u2019s signing through 2030. The weighted average lease term across tenants is just over four years, according to marketing materials.\n\nThe sale offer comes after Beacon\u2019s\nloss on 303 East Wacker Drive\n, which sold in December for about $63 million, a steep drop from the $182 million Beacon paid in 2018. Another blow came with a foreclosure lawsuit at 330 North Wabash Avenue, where Beacon faces claims over a $372 million loan after its appraisal\ndropped 62 percent last month\nfrom issuance four years ago.\nBeacon recently invested $13.7 million in renovating 190 South LaSalle, upgrading the lobby, fitness center and conference spaces in hopes of attracting tenants.\nThe building, developed in 1987 and designed by Philip Johnson, is one of the few LaSalle Street properties to undergo significant recent updates. That list includes 135 South LaSalle Street, for which the city doled out $98 million in TIF subsidies to Riverside Investment &amp; Development, DL3 Realty and AmTrust RE to convert vacant office space into 386 residential units\nlast fall\n.\nSeveral nearby towers have fallen into foreclosure, like New York-based landlord Feil Organization\u2019s 10 South LaSalle Street.

The figure ranged from 61 percent to 77 percent between 2019 and 2022.\nSimilarly, the North Chicago Housing Authority reported a 50 percent lease-up rate last year, while the Lake County Housing Authority logged 62 percent. Some recipients are still searching for homes, meaning these rates could shift.\nThe struggle to find housing can be grueling for voucher holders, who may have to sleep in their cars or couch surf, shower at the gym and store personal items at work. Once they are approved for vouchers, the clock is ticking, and time can run out before they find housing.\n\nSome housing authorities are adopting strategies to address the problems. Housing authorities in Waukegan, North Chicago and Lake County last year agreed to allow voucher holders to lease units in any of their jurisdictions, aiming to expand options and increase lease-up rates.\nWaukegan and Lake County have also received HUD approval to offer monetary incentives to landlords.\nMeanwhile, landlords cite barriers like bureaucratic delays, inspections and a lack of standardization across housing authorities. Some housing providers have called for streamlining the process through faster unit approvals and more consistent administrative standards.\nNationally, about 60 percent of voucher holders are able to lease units, according to New York University\u2019s Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy.\nThe rates are lower in markets with older housing stock and among recipients of color \u2014 two conditions that especially apply in Chicago.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

They did not immediately reply to a request for comment via a representative.\nAI has been touted as the likely taker for a substantial portion of San Francisco\u2019s one-third-empty office space. There were\n86 AI leases signed last year\nin the city, according to Kilroy analysis, with AI expected to drive another 1 million to 1.5 million square feet in absorption this year. Tech office leasing was up 17 percent last year,\ndriven by AI\ndemand, according to CBRE.\nAI companies are \u201cabsolutely\u201d having an impact on the office market, Walker said, adding that with 5 million square feet of leased space, the city\u2019s 200 AI companies represent nearly 9% of the total occupied office space in the city.\n\u201cThese AI companies recognize the strategic value of being in San Francisco\u2014not just for access to talent and investors, but for building in-office cultures that will help shape the future of downtown,\u201d he said.\nIf more of these AI companies come to SoMa, it would be a much-needed boost to the neighborhood, which has been\nhit harder than other SF markets\nby tech\u2019s office retreat since the pandemic. At the end of 2024, SoMa was 40 percent vacant, compared to 36.5 percent citywide, according to CBRE data.\n",

        "content": "The dominoes of department stores and boutique shops falling around San Francisco\u2019s Union Square may include another luxury retail store: Saks Fifth Avenue.\nCanada-based Hudson Bay Company, which owns Saks, appears ready to cut the cord for its appointment-only store at 384 Post Street when its lease expires in 2027,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported\n.\nThe move comes after an affiliate of Hudson Bay, Saks Global Enterprises, picked up the Union Square flagship store from Neiman Marcus late last year at 150 Stockton Street during its acquisition of Neiman Marcus and its real estate properties for\n$2.7 billion\n.\nThe transfer of the six-story, 208,900-square-foot building at 150 Stockton assigned a new market value of $160 million, or $766 per square foot, according to public records and an unidentified source.\nThat left Saks, which for decades has leased a 136,000-square-foot building at 384 Post diagonally across the street from Neiman, vulnerable.\nSaks Fifth Avenue faces an expiring lease in January\u00a0 2027, Charlie McCabe, a locally based real estate investment broker, told the Chronicle. The department store\u2019s ongoing tenure in that building \u201cmay be tenuous,\u201d he said.\nSaks pays more than $6 million a year in rent to landlord Lincoln Property, based in Dallas. Last summer, Saks laid off workers as it converted the store to\n\u201cappointment only,\u201d\ncurtailing its retail clout in Union Square.\nKazuko Morgan, a veteran retail broker who specializes in leasing around Union Square, said that she was told Saks doesn\u2019t plan to renew its lease \u2014 and hasn\u2019t heard that Saks could move in with Neiman Marcus across the street.\n\n\u201cIf Saks does exit the market, it\u2019s not such a terrible thing today, since they have been appointment-only for months,\u201d Morgan told the newspaper. \u201cThey\u2019ve already diminished their presence.\u201d\nLincoln Property and Germany-based Cara Investment bought the building in 2021 for $156 million, or $115 per square foot. They now plan to redevelop it as \u201cmixed use,\u201d Morgan said.\nThe loss of Saks could be inscribed into a larger retail tombstone for greater Union Square, once the city\u2019s golden shopping district.\nNordstrom, which for decades anchored the mall at 865 Powell Street, packed up in 2023. Bloomgindale\u2019s, which occupied more than 300,000 square-feet at the nearly empty San Francisco Centre mall,\nwill close this month\n.\nMacy\u2019s, which for decades has occupied its three-building flagship store in Union Square plaza, plans to\nsell the property and close the doors\nof its only San Francisco store.\nOther retailers that have pulled up stakes include Saks Off Fifth, Nordstrom Rack, H&amp;M and Uniqlo, according to the Chronicle. Meanwhile, luxury retailers may be drifting over to historic Jackson Square.\nThis month, Ralph Lauren has returned to San Francisco with a\nnew store at 441 Jackson Street\n, following an\ninflux of luxury retailers\nlike Paul Smith, Isabel Marant and Zimmermann.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Architect-turned-builder Lara Dutto plans to build 15 homes next to a war memorial of thousands of white wooden crosses in Lafayette.\nDutto, principal of Orinda-based Laraarchitecture, bought the\nLafayette Hillside Memorial\nat 3600 Deer Hill Road two years ago to save the 3.1-acre parcel from development,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported\n.\nNow Dutto, a professor of architecture at Diablo Valley College, has pitched a plan to develop 15 homes on the northern two-thirds of the site.\nShe wants to split off the southern portion to preserve the memorial conceived in 2006 by contractor Jeff Heaton as a \u201cplace to recognize, honor, and commemorate individual national service contribution\u201d of those dying in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\nNonprofit Lafayette Hillside Memorial would continue to maintain the crosses.\n\u201cIts scale and rawness and simplicity somehow makes me stop, forces me to take a deep breath, and in that moment I am so grateful for my freedoms,\u201d she told the Chronicle.\nDutto, who has worked since 2010 to support the memorial and once sat on its board, grew concerned when the family that owned it put it up for sale, fearful that whoever bought it would remove the crosses. So she bought it in 2023 for an undisclosed price.\nPlans now call for preserving the memorial and half the property as open space, while building a subdivision of 15 single-family homes around a \u201cvillage green,\u201d with an outdoor cooking and dining area, according to the Chronicle.\nFive of the homes would have accessory dwelling units, or granny flats. The development would climb up the slope along Oak Hill Road, below a ridgeline of preserved open space.\n\nDutto has employed a state density bonus and Senate Bill 330 for streamlined approvals. On Monday, the Lafayette Planning Commission was slated to hold an informational hearing.\nThe application came as housing advocates\nsued the East Bay city\nfor creating \u201cmisleading and unrealistic housing sites\u201d to satisfy state-mandated housing goals.\nThe lawsuit by the Housing Action Coalition accused Lafayette of \u201cpretending\u201d to comply with the state housing element, a planning blueprint required of every city and county across the state every eight years.\nMayor Susan Candell took issue with the lawsuit, according to the Chronicle, saying the City Council has approved all housing projects that have come before it. She said the city will have no choice but to approve the Deer Hill Road project.\nLafayette, a wealthy city with $2 million homes, was once a battleground for the region\u2019s housing wars, with two lawsuits, a ballot referendum and more than 100 public hearings that delayed a 315-unit apartment building for almost a dozen years.\nWithin a 10-year span, 115 homes were built in the city of 25,000 residents, including 10 in 2010, 76 in 2018 and 29 in 2019. The city must rezone to build 2,114 homes, 943 of them affordable, by 2031.\nLast year, the\nstate Supreme Court declined\nto hear an appeal from a neighborhood group, allowing the development to move forward. The project has not broken ground.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

A previous 19-story hotel and fitness club project, approved in 2021, stalled.\n\u201cThis started out as a contrarian bet but as we dug in deeper and looked at the market, how it is evolving and maturing out of Covid, it doesn\u2019t seem so contrarian any more,\u201d Gino Canori, president of Related California, told the San Francisco Chronicle.\nRelated hopes to secure approvals to build the tower this fall, allowing the firm to break ground by late next year. If all goes well, it could be completed by 2030.\nMichelin-starred chef, Ralph Lauren come to Jackson Square\nRestaurateur Peter Hemsley of Michelin-starred Aphotic\njoined forces\nwith developer Brick &amp; Timber, which keeps its headquarters in the neighborhood, to buy a 15,600-square-foot store and building at 530 Jackson Street for $32.4 million, or over $2,000 a square foot.\n\nHemsley announced last year he would shut Aphotic, blaming the SoMa location. It\u2019s not clear whether the chef intends to revive the sustainable seafood restaurant or launch a new concept in the ground-floor space that was home to Kells Irish Restaurant and Pub for decades. Paul McAleese is the owner of Kells Irish Restaurant and Bar as well as the seller of 530 Jackson.\nJust down the street from 530 Jackson, Ralph Lauren opened its first new store in the city in years.\n\u201cThe opening of Polo Ralph Lauren in Jackson Square is a testament to the neighborhood\u2019s growing appeal as a premier destination for retail,\u201d Robbie Silver, CEO of the Downtown SF Partnership, said in a statement.\nSweetgreen, Blue Bottle sign long-term Mission Rock leases\nIn further retail news, Mission Rock developers Tishman Speyer and the San Francisco Giants announced\ntwo new long-term deals\nat their Mission Bay development. Blue Bottle Coffee and Sweetgreen have signed 10-year leases at Mission Rock and Arsicault bakery finally opened its doors in the development.\nOakland-founded Blue Bottle will occupy 2,069 square feet at the base of the building occupied by Visa at 300 Toni Stone Crossing. Salad-and-grain bowl shop Sweetgreen will take just under 2,400 square feet at the base of The Canyon, a residential tower at the intersection of Dr. Maya Angelou Lane and Toni Strone Crossing.\nAlex Sagues and Madeline Mandanis represented the landlords in the deal. Sagues called Mission Bay \u201cthe most vibrant neighborhood in San Francisco\u201d. He said retailers are drawn to the transit-friendly area because \u201cit is a true seven-day neighborhood,\u201d with office, life sciences, residential, and the UCSF hospital, as well as events at Chase Center and Oracle Park.\n",

        "content": "State insurance regulators have unveiled a new plan to stabilize the home insurance market by pushing insurers to expand coverage in fire-prone areas where companies have dropped hundreds of thousands of homeowners in recent years.\nThe plan updates a map of high-risk zip codes where insurers will be required to write more policies, aiming to create a more equitable insurance market despite growing wildfire threats, the\nSan Jose Mercury News reported\n.\nHowever, many high-risk Bay Area neighborhoods, including Oakland, the Berkeley Hills and Gilroy, aren\u2019t included in the updated map.\nState regulators say this is because those areas fall within zip codes where the overall insurance need is deemed lower. Despite this, new rules will still require insurers to offer coverage to homeowners in these areas who have been rejected by traditional providers due to fire risk.\n\u201cInsurance companies have ignored those homes, and we\u2019re trying to put the spotlight on them,\u201d Michael Soller, spokesperson for the California Department of Insurance, told the Mercury News.\nThe plan stems from a deal with the insurance industry, allowing companies to raise rates based on climate-related risks in exchange for expanding coverage in high-risk areas.\nCalifornians currently pay an average of $1,435 annually for homeowners insurance, below the national average. But prices vary widely. And insurers like State Farm and Allstate have stopped issuing new policies in the state, citing strict rate-setting rules and wildfire losses.\nThe new rules require insurers to cover a proportional share of high-risk policies. For example, if a company covers 100 of every 1,000 policies statewide, it must cover 85 of every 1,000 in high-risk areas.\n\nHowever, some consumer groups argue the reforms have loopholes that may allow insurers to delay meeting these targets or only slightly increase coverage.\nHomeowners in fire-prone areas, like Carolyn Grote of the Berkeley Hills, are preparing independently. Grote formed a \u201cFirewise community\u201d with neighbors to improve fire safety, hoping to retain her insurance.\n\u201cIf Firewise could help people retain their insurance, that might be the biggest motivator,\u201d she told the newspaper.\nConsumer groups are skeptical.\n\u201cInsurers can use secret models to raise rates right away with unenforceable promises to expand coverage,\u201d Carmen Balber of nonprofit Consumer Watchdog told the Mercury News.\nRegulators, however, insist they will monitor compliance closely and can revoke rate-setting privileges if insurers fail to meet coverage requirements.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "SAJ Development wants to swing a wrecking ball into three office buildings in Lafayette to erect a 90-unit apartment building in an upscale city long opposed to affordable housing.\nThe locally based developer filed revised plans to replace the offices with a seven-story, 171,400-square-foot complex at 1001 Oak Hill Road,\nthe San Francisco Business Times reported\n. The city will consider the project on March 17.\nThe application came as housing advocates\nsued the East Bay city\nfor creating \u201cmisleading and unrealistic housing sites\u201d to satisfy state-mandated housing goals. The lawsuit by the Housing Action Coalition accused Lafayette of \u201cpretending\u201d to comply with the state housing element, a planning blueprint required of every city and county across the state every eight years.\nLafayette\u2019s alleged shell game includes relying on faith-based institutions and longtime businesses with no plans to develop housing as potential building sites for homes, according to the complaint.\nThe lawsuit seeks a court to compel the city to adopt a revised plan with an update to its zoning laws. The city must rezone to build 2,114 homes, 943 of them affordable, by 2031. Within the decade through 2019, the city permitted 115 homes.\nSAJ could help remedy that by its mixed-use project calling for 79 market-rate apartments and 11 affordable apartments, including five for very-low-income households and six for moderate-income households.\nWhat appears to be a U-shaped complex, designed by Berkeley-based Trachtenberg Architects, would be draped in two shades of brown, with tiered roof decks, and floor-to-ceiling corner windows with exterior balconies, according to a rendering.\nThe developer would employ a nearly 23 percent state density bonus in exchange for the affordable housing, plus a state streamlining law for faster approvals. A cost and timeline for construction were not disclosed.\n\nSAJ applied using Senate Bill 330, which effectively freezes zoning that\u2019s in place at the time a project is submitted, limits the number of public hearings to five and suspends or eliminates restrictions on housing development.\nThe law aims to prevent cities from delaying projects unnecessarily over subjective standards, along with several other laws meant to stop cities from blocking affordable housing.\nThe developer had submitted an earlier version of the project in 2022 that called for tearing down just two of the three offices to build\n53 units\n. City officials approved that version in May, before SAJ revised its plans. Jeff Stone, owner of Diamond Construction, was listed as the property owner operating through SAJ Development, according to SFYimby.\nLafayette was once a battleground for the region\u2019s housing wars, with two lawsuits, a ballot referendum and more than 100 public hearings that delayed a 315-unit apartment building for almost a dozen years.\nLast year, the\nstate Supreme Court declined\nto hear an appeal from a neighborhood group, allowing the development to move forward. The project has not broken ground.\nMembership in SAJ Development, led by Stone, includes Diamond Swope Holdings, the Steven Kay Trust, the Griggs Community Property Trust and Outdo, based in Lafayette, according to state business records. Another firm, Valley Oak Capital, is based in Texas.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

In 1921, it tried to redevelop it into a mixed-use village, with homes and commercial properties, according to its website.\nA default notice filed this week gives the Zappettinis 90 days to pay off the default amount. If they fail, the lender will record a notice of sale, Steven Hoffman, a real estate attorney based in Sunnyvale who is not connected to the situation, told the Business Journal.\nThe Business Journal reported in February that the\nMountain View tech campus had been heading toward foreclosure\nor a loan modification after the owner defaulted on a $120 million mortgage debt.\nLoan servicer reports obtained in January showed Zappettini Investment Company failed to repay the mortgage debt by its June 2024 maturity date. The initial loan default was\nfirst reported by The Real Deal\nthat month.\nCiti Real Estate Funding issued the two loans \u2014 one for $65 million and a second for $55 million \u2014 and then pooled them into commercial mortgage-backed securities deals.\n\nAs of last summer, leases for 40 percent of the tech park\u2019s office, light-industrial and research and development buildings were set to expire within six months, a key factor in the default.\nThe Zappettini family was originally in the wholesale flower importing business and formerly used some of the Mountain View properties for its wholesale operations, according to its website.\nThe Zappettinis sold multiple parcels in Mountain View to Google in 2011, which the tech giant sold a few years later to the Irvine Company, according to public records. They sold another property to Google in 2016 for its now-abandoned\nGoogle Landings\nproject.\nThe family also owned almost 2 acres in the San Francisco Flower Mart from the 1950s until they sold it to Kilroy Realty in 2016 for $31 million in cash and $56 million in stock.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Fielder\u2019s motion to continue the vote passed unanimously, with a hearing set for March 18.\nThe Empty Homes Tax took effect at the beginning of last year, with collections planned for upcoming April.\n\nProponents estimated it would generate more than $20 million a year for housing and unlock about 5,000 units within two years, though critics have questioned the projections.\nThe tax has faced legal challenges since February 2023, when property owner groups filed a lawsuit alleging it was coercive and infringed on their rights.\nIn December 2023, Superior Court Judge Charles Haines\ndeclined to dismiss the lawsuit\narguing in a ruling that property owners don\u2019t need to wait until the tax is due to challenge it in court. In October, Haines\nstruck down the tax\n, saying that it violated the U.S. and California constitutions and was preempted by California law.\nThe court subsequently ordered the city to halt enforcement and collection, and the city treasurer stated that property owners would not be required to pay by the original April 30, 2025 deadline unless the court\u2019s decision is reversed on appeal.\nThe city attorney\u2019s office is now appealing the ruling and has expressed disappointment with the trial court\u2019s decision.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Aghamiri\u2019s Msasa Properties\nfiled plans in September 2023\nto build the seven-story complex near San Jose\u2019s Japantown.\nWith developers having built no market-rate projects larger than 20 units in the city last year, Aghamiri\u2019s project appears to be the first large-scale multifamily development since 2023, in which 336 units were built.\nPlans call for 118 apartments on a half-acre north of Basset Street between North First and North Second streets, with six set aside as affordable for very low-income households. Parking would be available for 74 cars.\nInitial plans by Aghamiri included 18 affordable units, or 15 percent, but he cut it to 5 percent to make the project pencil out, according to Erik Schoennauer, a local land use consultant who spoke on behalf of the developer.\n\nThe project, designed by Oakland-based Studio T-Square, features a charcoal and white complex with balconies, according to a rendering, bookended by a brown brick sections.\nThe site is located in an opportunity zone, which offers tax advantages to developers.\nAghamiri bought the office property in 2022 for $5.3 million, or $442 per square foot.\nThe 61-year-old offices have been vacant for 10 months, and have been damaged by vandals, Schoennauer said. They\u2019ve been 60 percent vacant for more than five years\nHe said Aghamiri hopes to break ground this summer, and complete the project in 20 to 24 months.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "A proposed legal settlement over the botched environmental cleanup of Hunters Point Shipyard would leave thousands of affected residents with just $606 per person.\nA federal judge denied the agreement between developers FivePoint Holdings and Lennar and lawyers behind the $1 billion lawsuit \u2014 calling it a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d for the builders and the \u201cworst settlement\u201d he\u2019s ever seen, the\nSan Francisco Chronicle reported.\nIn a scathing order, U.S. District Judge James Donato called the proposed payout to 6,500 residents of Hunters Point \u201cpaltry,\u201d and accused the plaintiff\u2019s lawyers of selling out their clients.\n\u201cNo question that the proposed terms are unfair to the class members,\u201d he said during a January hearing.\nResidents of Hunters Point filed a lawsuit in 2018 alleging they were the victims of fraud and had suffered health defects in connection with the former shipyard\u2019s ongoing toxic cleanup.\nIn the latest attempt by Irvine-based FivePoint and Miami-based Lennar to settle, the developers and Sausalito law firm Bonner &amp; Bonner had asked the court to approve a $5.4 million deal.\nBut with $1.4 million for attorney fees and $4 million in community payouts, it worked out to $606 per person. A settlement proposal in 2022 for 9,000 residents, also rejected by the judge, would have worked out to $400 per person.\nDonato accused the residents\u2019 attorneys, Charles and Cabral Bonner, of colluding against Tetra Tech EC, a third defendant in the lawsuit but left out of the settlement talks. The unit of Tetra Tech was hired two decades ago to\nclean hazardous radiation and toxic substances\nfrom the shipyard once owned by the U.S. Navy.\nThe developers and the Bonners had entered into a \u201ccommon interest agreement,\u201d which allows parties with shared legal interests to share information in order to collaborate on defense strategies. But the judge said the residents and developers are \u201cadverse parties\u201d who cut a deal to target Tetra Tech EC.\nSuch a settlement \u201cbecomes collusive when it is aimed to injure the interests\u201d of an absent defendant, Donato said.\n\nThe Bonners have denied wrongdoing, saying they acted in the best interest of their clients by collaborating with the developers. Lennar declined to comment to the Chronicle, while FivePoint didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nSam Singer, a spokesperson for Pasadena-based Tetra Tech EC said: \u201cThe judge\u2019s order speaks for itself.\u201d\nAfter signing the common interest agreement, the Bonners amended the residents\u2019 complaint for the sixth time. The changes \u201cdrastically narrowed plaintiff\u2019s claims against the home builder defendants, dropped the class allegations against them, and deleted the damages demand of $1 billion,\u201d Donato wrote in his order.\n\u201cThe evidence of collusion is striking,\u201d Donato wrote. During the hearing, he questioned why the developers should be allowed to exit a $1 billion lawsuit in exchange for \u201cpaying nickels.\u201d\nFivePoint, a spinoff of Lennar, has entitlements for thousands of homes and millions of square feet of commercial space at Hunter\u2019s Point.\nA trial date for the case is set for next year, but the Bonners said they are talking with the developers about another settlement deal, and\nreached out to Tetra Tech EC\nto \u201csee if they are interested in negotiating.\u201d\nTetra Tech EC has faced\nmultiple ongoing lawsuits\nrelated to the cleanup of the 500-acre shipyard site, including a lawsuit filed by the developers in 2020. This year, the U.S. Department of Justice agreed to settle a lawsuit brought against the contractor a decade ago, originally by whistleblowers, for\n$97 million\n, according to the Chronicle.\nThe Navy previously said in other court filings that the \u201cnegative fiscal impact\u201d of the fraud at the shipyard is between\n$370 million and $570 million\n.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "When Tony Prophet joined Salesforce as its chief equality officer in 2016, he wanted the \u201creal urban experience of living in San Francisco,\u201d which he didn\u2019t associate with the city\u2019s\ntraditional high-end neighborhoods\non the north side of town. Instead he went into\nSoMa\n, \u201ceyes wide open,\u201d buying a 7,000-square-foot top-floor condo at 9 Bernice Street for just over $7 million in November 2016.\n\u201cNo surprises,\u201d he said of his time living with his then-wife and their son at the semi-industrial location near Rainbow Grocery and the DNA Lounge. \u201cWe knew everything\u2014all the good and the challenges that we were in for\u2014and saw some real improvements along the way.\u201d\nNearly a decade later and with more than $1 million poured into creating a wind-shielded roof deck with astroturf and a fire pit, Prophet is hoping his condo will break West SOMA residential records, with an asking price of $8.8 million.\nA price of about $1,250 per square foot is not out of step for the neighborhood. But because there are not many condos or even single-family homes as big as 9 Bernice, there are seldom sales above $5 million. So while it\u2019s \u201cimpossible to replicate what\u2019s been done here,\u201d according to Compass agent Butch Haze, who is listing the skylit two-level loft with three bedrooms, 3.5 baths, a wine room, and a glass-enclosed gym, it\u2019s also nearly impossible to find comps.\n\u201cYou really have to compare it to buying a warehouse and what it would take to do the TIs,\u201d he said, adding that the turnkey aspect is \u201cbaked in\u201d to the asking price.\nThere are added perks as well. The condo includes the elaborate light fixtures and large-scale furniture, almost entirely from Restoration Hardware, including a 16-seat dining table that was craned in by the previous owner, luxury retailer Wilkes-Bashford co-owner Tyler Mitchell.\n\n\u201cNot everyone loves Restoration Hardware, but nobody hates it,\u201d said Prophet, who built on interior designer Ken Fulk\u2019s work for Mitchell.\nThe new price marks a big drop from the last time the condo was on the market in 2022, when it was listed at just under $11 million. The home didn\u2019t find a buyer at the time, but Prophet had already moved to Florida so his son could attend IMG, a sports academy about an hour south of Tampa. For the last two years, he has rented it to a foursome of entrepreneurs from the start up world. Haze said the new price had to speak to today\u2019s \u201cvalue-driven buyer.\u201d\n\u201cWe wanted to price it where the price per square foot is just too attractive,\u201d Haze said.\nThere are a lot of early stage businesses walking distance from the property, Prophet added, which borders the Mission, Potero Hill and the Design District. The \u201cperfect fit\u201d would be someone who is excited by the idea of walking to work and entertaining in the enormous space, he said.\nProphet said he hosted everything from fundraisers for London Breed and the Women\u2019s HIV Program at UCSF to media events for Salesforce during his time there. He left Salesforce in 2021, and now sits on the board at Dolby Labs and is an investor and board member for an AI-assisted sales platform called Aviso.\nThe likely buyer for this home probably also sits on a lot of boards, Haze said, and is in their 50s or 60s but still active in tech or finance. They probably already own more traditional homes outside the city, but are looking for something different. It may be somebody that has \u201cflirted with\u201d the north side of the city or Noe Valley, but can\u2019t pass up the outside-the-box offering.\n\u201cThey want to have fun in a really cool, almost superhero lair in San Francisco that wows all their friends,\u201d he said.\nThat\u2019s a very specific buyer profile, but Prophet said he can be patient until the right person comes along.\n\u201cIt\u2019s super special for someone who sees that opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the same situation when we bought it: a unique property and a high price point.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Two major San Francisco apartment building trades by longtime owners have closed in the first few months of the year, including the $35 million sale of the block-long Normandy Apartments, just behind the famed St. Mary\u2019s Cathedral.\nThe early spring sales are further signs of\nnew life in the market\nthat agents saw beginning in the latter half of last year.\nThe seller of the 1968-built 108-unit complex at 1135-1175 Ellis Street was a partnership called Normandy Apartments that goes back to at least the 1990s, according to city records. The buyer was affordable housing developer Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation, which bought the property with funding from the San Francisco Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing and Community Development and is planning a major renovation. The MOHCD confirmed the $35 million price.\nThe Jan. 31 acquisition will create \u201cpermanently affordable units in the City\u2019s Western Addition neighborhood for families, individuals, couples, older adults, and long-term residents within a variety of ethnic and racial backgrounds,\u201d according to a TNDC announcement. With the exception of one manager\u2019s unit, all apartments will be restricted to households not to exceed 120 percent of the city\u2019s area median income with an average of 80 percent of the city\u2019s AMI. In 2024, 80 percent of AMI would mean that a single person making up to $83,900 would be eligible, for example, while a household with three people could make up to $107,900, according to the MOHCD website.\nA November 2024 MOHCD memo about TNDC\u2019s request for just over $52 million in permanent financing for the purchase and rehabilitation of the nearly 70,000-square-foot property said the building is in \u201cgood condition\u201d and 90 percent occupied. The planned rehabilitation will focus on fire and life safety upgrades and accessibility and ADA upgrades and requirements.\nColliers agent Brad Lagomarsino represented the sellers and said that TNDC and MOHCD \u201cseized the rare opportunity to purchase 108 units in the heart of San Francisco\u201d. He added that the nearly 1.5-acre lot\u00a0 \u201coffers tremendous development potential that justifies the price paid for the asset.\u201d\n\nIn another early spring sale after a decades-long hold, a 36-unit Nob Hill apartment building traded for the first time since it was built in 1954, according to public records. The price was $14.5 million, or just over $400,000 per unit, according to the transfer tax on the sale. That\u2019s above the average of about $340,000 per unit in San Francisco in 2024, according to Colliers data.\nColliers listing agent Dustin Dolby said he could not comment on the Feb. 18 sale due to a non-disclosure agreement, but he posted on LinkedIn that, \u201cWith its proximity to Grace Cathedral, Huntington Park, and the Financial District, 1330 Jones exemplifies the enduring desirability of Nob Hill real estate.\u201d\nThe sellers were the descendants of the developer, Theo G. Meyer and Sons, which built the seven-story building, according to the deed and probate records. The buyer was Otrera Real Estate, LLC, a Delaware-created entity that lists its address as a P.O. Box at the Rincon Finance Center in downtown San Francisco, according to the deed. The buyers\u2019 agent is unknown.\nThe six-story building at 1330 Jones has 18 one-bedroom, one-bath units, six two-bedroom, one-bath units, and 12 two-bedroom, two-bath units, as well as 23 dedicated parking spots and onsite laundry.\nThe building was first listed as part of a\nthree-building portfolio\nthat was all developed by the Meyer family and came to market at an undisclosed price last summer. It is the smallest building of the three, and the only one to sell thus far. The other two buildings are a 62-unit, 13-story building at 1000 Green Street in Russian Hill and the 56-unit, 13-story Crest Royal at 1310 Jones, which is next door to the building that sold.\nAt least two other San Francisco apartment buildings asking over $10 million are also in contract but are still pending. Magnolia Place, which has 27 apartment units at 3322 Buchanan in the Marina, came to market at the end of September with an asking price of $18 million. The 2001-built non-rent-controlled building with two commercial units fronting Lombard Street has been pending as of Nov. 22, according to Redfin.\u00a0At 1745 Market, a property with 48 apartment units and eight commercial spaces, including local favorite piano bar Martuni\u2019s, went into contract on Jan. 27, according to Redfin. It is owned by\nMosser Properties\nand has been\non and off the market for the last few years\n, with a starting price of $25 million in 2022. It came back to market most recently last September, with an asking price of $14 million. That ask dropped to $13 million in November, just $1 million more than Mosser paid for it back in 2017.\n",

The two-phase project will replace former county probation offices.\nIt also may be first of its kind to use S-13 to streamline approvals and shorten development, according to the Business Times.\nThe S-13 zone allows 100 percent affordable housing projects to bypass environmental and discretionary review, while allowing an additional bonus height, if they meet certain objectives.\nWhile it can help developers get projects approved a year sooner than state streamlining laws like Senate Bill 35 and Assembly Bill 2011, it\u2019s three years faster than a traditional planning application.\nThe three buildings are part of a larger plan to remake Jack London Square with hundreds of affordable homes around a plaza containing a playground, public art and seating.\n\nThe developers plan to spend the next two years raising money to build the project, likely from Measure U Affordable Housing Infrastructure Bond funds, local funding and state financing in tax credits and bonds, according to the Business Times.\nA cost and timeline for the development were not disclosed.\nA later phase, also by Related and East Bay Asian Local Development, would add two affordable apartment buildings and a market-rate complex at 401 Broadway. A rendering suggests two seven- or eight-story buildings and a 20-story tower overlooking I-880.\nRelated California, founded in 1989, is a unit of New York-based Related Companies. The California subsidiary has developed 20,700 apartments, and owns and manages more than 13,000 affordable and workforce housing units across the Golden State, according to its website.\nEast Bay Asian Local Development, founded in 1975 by a group of Asian Pacific Islander college students and young professionals, owns and manages more than 35 residential and commercial developments, according to its website.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

That works out to $176,000 per unit.\nSunrise Realty Trust, an affiliate of TCG Real Estate, is providing $46.5 million of the loan; the rest was syndicated to an affiliate on the TCG Real Estate platform, the release said.\nThe Class A property, at 1207 North Zang Boulevard, is located across the street from Methodist Dallas Medical Center and was built on the site of El Fenix restaurant. It features a rooftop pool and a remote work lounge with private meeting rooms.\nSan Antonio-based developer Kairoi is known for its upscale apartments.

        "content": "The future of Dallas\u2019 iconic \u201cMushroom House\u201d is uncertain after car dealer Clay Cooley acquired the home along with two adjacent Highland Park properties, sparking speculation about potential teardowns.\nThe house at 4200 Armstrong Parkway, known for its curved design and green-blue copper roof, is one of three multimillion-dollar mansions Cooley and his wife, Lisa, own at Armstrong Parkway and Bordeaux Avenue, The Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. The other two are at 4208 Armstrong Parkway and 4209 Bordeaux Avenue.\nThe couple\u2019s plans for their 2.5 acres of prime properties are a mystery. They haven\u2019t commented, but it\u2019s led to questions about whether the unique home, and the historic residences next to it, will survive or be cleared to make way for new construction.\nThe Cooleys haven\u2019t filed any demolition or major renovation permits, though plumbing and mechanical permits were submitted for two of the properties. Preservationists are hopeful that at least the 1920s Tudor-style home on Bordeaux, designed by famed architect Hal Thomson, will be spared.\nThe group Preservation Park Cities recently toured two of the homes but wasn\u2019t allowed inside 4208 Armstrong Parkway due to structural concerns.\nClay Cooley attended a Preservation Park Cities meeting in February, where he expressed a desire to avoid community conflict. Preservationists suggested a design that would retain the Bordeaux home as a guesthouse while allowing for a new build on the Armstrong lots.\n\nThe couple bought the home at 4208 Armstrong Parkway first, in 2020, county records show. They then purchased 4209 Bordeaux Avenue and the Mushroom House in a five-month period, transferring them into their name by December 2024.\nThe Mushroom House, completed in 1997 by Dallas architect Tom Workman, has long divided opinion for its whimsical, storybook-like design. Its price history is unavailable, but its market value is estimated at over $7.5 million, according to Zillow.\nPreservationists admit that while the house is architecturally significant, it may be less defensible due to its modern construction and location on a highly visible lot.\nLocal ordinances also complicate the equation. Highland Park rules prohibit combining all three parcels into a single lot, which could influence Cooley\u2019s final decision.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

Although a groundbreaking ceremony was held last year, the convention center design hasn\u2019t been finalized; plans for the facility have shifted multiple times.\nConcerns about the train project compelled Dallas City Council to back an alternative route for the train last summer; officials said they\u2019d revisit the issue after reviewing the economic impact of various high-speed routes.\nHunt is also the developer behind NorthEnd, a $5 billion mixed-use development that will include a\n$500 million campus\nfor Goldman Sachs.\n\u2013Jess Hardin\n",

The asking price pencils out to $1,860 per square feet.\nA separate listing includes 4705 Island Cove, 4709 Island Cove and 4400 Island Avenue for $25.5 million, combining 4.85 acres and approximately 450 feet of Lake Austin frontage.\nEric Moreland of Moreland Properties has the listing; the identity of the seller, who owns all three properties, is hidden by a trust.\nForty-eight listings over $2 million were added to Austin\u2019s inventory last week, 12 more than it added\nthe week prior\n, according to the Eklund Gomes luxury report.\n\nContracts on luxury homes dipped, from 12 the week before to six last week, five single-family homes and one $2.24 million condo. Purchases typically slow when the annual 9-day SXSW festival and conference takes over the city, Eklund Gomes\u2019 Michael Reisor said.\nThe top contract was for a 5,800-square-foot home last listed for $5.3 million at 4900 Amarra Drive in Barton Creek. It has five bedrooms and a detached guesthouse. It asked $900 per square foot and was listed by Eric Moreland.\nThe other four single-family homes ranged in listed price from $2.5 to $3.25 million, with three in Tarrytown and one near Bee Cave, in the Bella Montagna neighborhood.\nThe condo deal went down for a penthouse asking about $900 per square foot at 901 West 9th Street, unit 704, at the Nokonah residences. The nearly 2,500-square-foot unit has 2 bedrooms, a balcony and an 800-bottle wine cellar.\nThe Nokonah was developed by Robert Barnstone and Perry Lorenz in 2001.

The 1.93-acre property has been owned by the Halperin family for the past 19 years.\nThe development would feature 310 residential units covering about 40 percent of the site, while the remainder will focus on open space, pedestrian-friendly amenities and two or three restaurants, some spanning multiple levels with roof terraces. GFF Design is attached to the project.\nTenants of the strip mall include Open Sesame Lebanese Grill, whose owners have been in discussions with Halperin about remaining in the neighborhood, though whether it stays on-site or relocates is still undecided.\n\nThe project\u2019s design takes a cue from the Old Parkland campus redevelopment by Crow Holdings at 3819 Maple Avenue, which GFF CEO Evan Beattie called \u201ctransformational\u201d for the neighborhood.\nThe redevelopment requires rezoning, which could take up to two years to finalize.\nThe project is set to add to the wave of redevelopment reshaping Oak Lawn, a neighborhood known for its nightlife and identity as the heart of Dallas\u2019 LGBTQ+ community.\nSeveral office and residential developments are underway nearby, like McCourt Partners and HN Capital Partners\u2019 40-acre mixed-use development at\n1650 Oak Lawn Avenue\nas well as\nThe Oak Lawn Design Plaza\n, covering nine acres at 1444 Oak Lawn Avenue from Charlotte, North Carolina\u2013based investor Asana Partners.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

But earlier this month, Dallas officials resolved that problem by securing the deed for the disputed portion of the property.\nThe company, however, has held firm, stating the\ndecision to close is \u201cfinal\u201d\nand that the situation is \u201cfar more complicated than what the public is being led to believe.\u201d Saks has also said its attempts to meet with city officials have been rejected.\n\nIt remains uncertain whether the city\u2019s proposed deal is enough to prompt reconsideration, or even a temporary extension of operations. Tolbert\u2019s letter asked for a response to \u201cthe collective group,\u201d and said Neiman Marcus would have time to \u201ccapture the opportunity we wish to discuss\u201d if the company keeps the store open for a few months longer.\nAlong with the store, Neiman Marcus also plans to vacate its 82,000-square-foot headquarters in NexPoint\u2019s 42-story Cityplace Tower at 2711 North Haskell Avenue.\nThe looming closure threatens to leave a major gap in the city\u2019s downtown retail landscape and in the historic character of Dallas. Neiman Marcus has operated its flagship store for more than a century, serving as an anchor for the district\u2019s identity and economic activity.\nThe consortium is holding out hope of avoiding the significant loss to the city\u2019s downtown core, while Saks is investing $100 million into its Neiman Marcus store at NorthPark Center.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

Twelve Republican lawmakers who replaced pro-gambling politicians in the last election are holding the line against casinos, the Texas Tribune\nreported\n. They are joined by three others who voted in favor of sports betting last session but have since rescinded their support.\nThey said this week they would oppose \u201cany attempt to expand gambling\u201d this session, which ends in May. After that, the Texas Legislature won\u2019t meet in regular session again until 2027.\nProposals to legalize casinos and sports betting have been introduced, but the GOP coalition aims to stop them in their tracks. Neither proposal has received a committee hearing, the first step to consideration by the full house.\nThat could be bad news for the city of Irving, where Sands is seeking zoning approval for a Mavericks stadium with a resort and entertainment center, including a casino. Sands is spending big on lobbying and advertising campaigns in favor of \u201cdestination resort\u201d casinos. If a casino is a no-go, Sands has said it is\nlikely to kill the entire proposal\n.\nMeanwhile in Southern Dallas, developer\nHoque Global\nmet its first deadline in its agreement with the city of Dallas for its University Hills megadevelopment.

The lease brings the building, at 845 Texas Avenue to 99 percent leased.\nAnother law firm, Hicks Johson, is spending $4.3 million to build out its lease at\nSkanska\u2019s\nNorton Rose Fullbright tower at 1550 Lamar Street, which is\ndowntown Houston\u2019s newest\noffice building.\nAnd a retail merchandiser is\nmoving its headquarters\nto 5801 Headquarters Drive in Plano, owned by\nMonarch Alternative Capital\nand\nTourmaline Capital Partners\nand built in 2021. The company will exit Granite Properties\u2019 Granite Park III, which was built in 2007.\nAnd in Austin, Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms is spending $3.7 million on an\noffice buildout in downtown Austin\n, although it\u2019s not clear for whom.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

Horton, holds 3,490 acres. As Houston\u2019s most active homebuilder in 2023, it led the region with 5,570 home starts and continues expanding in suburban communities.\nMeanwhile, Colony Ridge controls nearly 15,000 acres, primarily in Liberty County. The firm, known for developing infrastructure-ready lots, remains a major driver of suburban sprawl despite facing\nscrutiny over its business practices\n.\n\nPublic entities are also prominent landholders. The City of Houston manages 31,530 acres, including major public assets like George Bush Intercontinental Airport, parklands and municipal facilities. The Harris County Flood Control District controls 26,000 acres for its role in flood mitigation efforts.\nThe role of public entities in flood mitigation is particularly crucial, the Bayou City\u2019s low-lying topography and history of major flooding events making infrastructure and water management far more important to long-term development planning relative to most other Texas metros.\nHarris County itself holds 30,130 acres, spanning government buildings, recreational spaces and major event venues like NRG Park.\nHouston\u2019s sprawl is driven by a mix of public investment and private development, with much of the metro\u2019s expansion occurring along major growth corridors like Interstate 45, U.S. Highway 59 and the Grand Parkway.\nLiberty County, where Colony Ridge dominates, is one of the fastest-growing exurban areas, driven by demand for affordable housing. Its population increased 25.5 percent from mid-2020 to last summer, Census data shows.\nMeanwhile, Fort Bend and Montgomery counties continue to attract large-scale master-planned communities, fueled by population growth and proximity to Houston\u2019s employment centers.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

The development is near Fort Worth\u2019s Cultural District, just off Interstate 30.\nThe antique mall has been a fixture in the district for more than 30 years, drawing loyal patrons and housing the Secret Garden restaurant. News of the redevelopment sparked social media backlash, with some residents calling it a \u201cterrible decision\u201d that could displace locals and worsen traffic. No one spoke in opposition at the council\u2019s zoning hearing, despite online pushback.\nCouncil member Macy Hill noted that developers met with local stakeholders prior to the meeting and expressed optimism about the project\u2019s potential to modernize the area.\n\nMontgomery Street Antique Mall\u2019s owners have yet to announce whether the business will relocate or close.\nPhoenix is also working with the Texas Department of Transportation to address concerns about traffic flow and access at the nearby intersection of Montgomery Street and I-30.\nThe project is part of the redevelopment trend across Fort Worth.

Monarch Alternative Capital and Tourmaline Capital Partners purchased the property in 2021.\n\nIt includes features like a game lounge that includes a golf simulator.

Meanwhile, operators of older inventory are under pressure to compete with new deliveries.\nThat\u2019s just one segment of the Dallas-Fort Worth office market, which had 52.8 million square feet of unused office space in November. The Metroplex ranked third in the country for office vacancy, behind New York and Chicago.\n",

He joined Crescent in 2006 when it operated as Goff Capital Partners before its conversion to Crescent Real Estate in 2016.\nThe firm has also promoted several internal leaders. These include Christopher Goff \u2014 Chairman John Goff\u2019s son \u2014 to senior managing director, head of capital formation; Andrew Lombardi, who will remain CFO, to senior managing director; Noelle Garsek to managing director, general counsel; and Ben Molk to managing director, office. Joseph Pitchford, managing director of development, will join Crescent\u2019s senior management committee.\nThe leadership shift comes as Crescent expands its footprint across North Texas. The firm manages $4.4 billion in assets and oversees about $225 million in development.\n\nCrescent is raising $250 million for its fourth GP Invitation Fund as it strengthens its development pipeline. The firm\u2019s portfolio includes marquee assets like The Crescent in Uptown Dallas \u2014 a 1.3 million-square-foot property with office, retail and hotel components \u2014 and the Robert L. Crandall corporate campus for American Airlines in Fort Worth.\nIts development activity is also expanding. Crescent is advancing a\nsecond office tower in Fort Worth\n, constructing the 30-story, 215-unit\nCrescent Point Tower\nin Uptown Dallas and preparing to open a 31-story\nluxury apartment building\nat 2811 Maple in May, where rents start at $4,000 a month.\nIt recently started development on its 92-home\nhigh-end housing project in Horseshoe Bay\nnear Marble Falls, northwest of Austin. Groundwork and infrastructure at the 114-acre site is expected to be completed in March 2026.\nSuszynski said the company is deepening its focus on high-quality development, particularly in Uptown Dallas and Fort Worth, where Crescent is looking to cultivate environments that mirror the success of its flagship properties.\nThe leadership team has an average tenure of over 12 years, Suszynski said.\n",

        "content": "UPDATE: Irving\u2019s Zoning Commission narrowly approved two zoning requests that would pave the way for Las Vegas Sands to build a casino on land the company owns in Irving.\nLas Vegas Sands\u2019 vision for a destination resort in Irving is facing growing public resistance, with concerns over the proposed casino dominating recent discussions.\nMore than 30 Irving residents spoke against the proposal, criticizing the casino element and raising concerns about the city\u2019s planning process in a Planning and Zoning Commission meeting last week, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe commission is\nconsidering a proposal\nto rezone the 182-acre site owned by Sands to allow for high-density, mixed-use development. Sands acquired 259 acres near the former Texas Stadium in mid-2023.\nThe changes would pave the way for a destination resort featuring a potential casino \u2014 pending state legalization \u2014 as well as a 15,000-seat arena for the Dallas Mavericks, plus a hotel, retail and entertainment spaces.\nThe debate comes amid broader speculation about the future of the Dallas Mavericks, co-owned by Sands\u2019\nnewly promoted CEO Patrick Dumont\n. Sands bought Mark Cuban\u2019s majority stake in the Mavericks for $3.5 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nThe rezoning would also establish a baseline development framework, though Sands would need to submit detailed plans for approval later. The proposal is still moving through the early stages. The commission scheduled to revisit it on Monday before a possible city council vote next Thursday.\nResidents argued that discussions were being rushed and lacked transparency, with some claiming they first learned of the zoning amendments just 48 hours before the meeting. Others questioned why city leaders would consider approving zoning for a casino while gambling is illegal in Texas.\nSands has said that a casino is essential for the project\u2019s financial viability. Casino revenue is necessary to support other resort amenities like convention space and entertainment venues, the company said.\nThe company plans to have representatives at the upcoming meetings and maintained Sands is committed to \u201congoing engagement and collaboration,\u201d spokesman Ron Reese said.\nRemoving casino gaming from the zoning could force Sands to reconsider the development altogether, he said.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

The lease will begin in April 2026, but the terms weren\u2019t otherwise disclosed.\nThe deal leaves just 18,000 square feet available in the 47-story, 1.2 million-square-foot tower, which is co-owned by Houston-based Hines and Ivanhoe Cambridge. Savills\u2019 Mark O\u2019Donnell represented the tenant, and Michael Anderson of Cushman &amp; Wakefield represented the landlords.\nThe lease follows Hines\u2019\nlanding a rare $450 million refinancing\nearlier this month, marking the first time in two years a multi-tenant office tower outside New York City was financed through the CMBS single-asset, single-borrower market.\nSkadden will move from its 24,000-square-foot space at 1000 Louisiana Street, Wells Fargo Plaza.\nThat 71-story tower was built in 1983. Its owner, MetLife, plans to spend $138,000 to remodel its 900-square-foot\namenity space\nfor an arcade game room to lure tenants after adding a golf simulator last year. It is also adding a restaurant, bar and tenant lounge, according to the building\u2019s website.\nTexas Tower opened in 2021 and is among the city\u2019s most leased Class A office towers. Other tenants, with Hines\u2019 global headquarters, include law firms Vinson &amp; Elkins, Clifford Chance and DLA Piper as well as Cheniere Energy, Morgan Stanley and coworking space The Square.\n\nThe tower includes two restaurants managed by Berg Hospitality Group. The Sylvie, a French bistro, opened last year. Seafood restaurant Dune Road was set to open last year but hasn\u2019t yet delivered.\nIt also features amenities like underfloor air conditioning, private terraces and a 9,600-square-foot amenity center with a lounge and conference space.\nThe tower\u2019s leasing success highlights the \u201cflight-to-quality\u201d trend, Hines senior managing director John Mooz said.\nClass A inventory has tightened in the city as tenants opt to lease where amenities are enticing enough to lure and retain workers. Older buildings have suffered as a result. The office vacancy rate remains high; it was up to 25.7 percent in the fourth quarter, according to CoStar.\nHouston\u2019s office pipeline has 1.9 million square feet of space under development, about tied with Los Angeles as of January, according to data from CommercialEdge cited by\nCommercialCafe\n. Dallas has 2.8 million square feet underway, and Austin has 3.6 million, the second-most in the nation behind Boston.\nThe drop in office output from previous years across southern markets will likely have a positive effect on occupancy rates, especially as more employers initiate return-to-office mandates, the site said.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "The owner of a Nolita property once slated for development by\nBrandon Miller\u2019s\nReal Estate Equities Corporation is suing the developer and its principals for abandoning the ill-fated office project.\nAri Zagdanski\u2019s Kinsmen Property Group\nclaims Real Estate Equities, or REEC, owes more than $2.9 million in ground rent at 156-166 Bowery Street, according to a new lawsuit filed in state Supreme Court. Kinsmen is suing REEC, principal Mark Seigel and Brandon Miller\u2019s widow Candice, who\u2019s the\nadministrator of his estate\n.\nThe landlord claims that REEC owes more than $5.3 million in back rent, demolition costs, tax reimbursements and outstanding liens on the property.\nREEC took over the leasehold for the 15,000-square-foot assemblage in February 2021 in a deal valued at $50 million. It agreed to demolish the property within 18 months and complete construction on a six- or seven-story mixed-use office building by February 2026, the suit alleges.\nBut that never happened. Instead, REEC failed to pay the ground rent or made partial payments for several months in 2024, the suit alleges. REEC also bailed on more than $600,000 in real estate taxes, which Kinsmen paid to avoid interest and penalties, the suit alleges. The landlord slapped REEC with a default notice in August, the month after\nMiller died\n.\n\nKinsmen filed permits in October to tear down the vacant, graffiti-covered buildings on the property and spent $1.7 million on demolition and related costs, the suit alleges. The landlord later demanded to be reimbursed by Seigel and Candice Miller, as successor to Brandon, who it says \u201cjointly and severally\u201d guaranteed the construction costs.\nLawyers for Kinsmen and Miller did not immediately respond to comment. Seigel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBrandon Miller died by suicide on July 3, leaving behind a tangled web of\nunfinished real estate projects\nand delinquent payments. REEC has gone dark since Brandon\u2019s death and the company\u2019s website is now hidden behind a password, raising questions about the future of REEC and its projects.\nThe landlord terminated REEC\u2019s ground lease in January.\nMeanwhile,\ntwo other properties\nonce envisioned by Miller are turning a corner. Leasing has begun at an East Village office property developed by REEC and a vacant lot in Chelsea where Miller once envisioned another office building is up for sale.\n",

        "content": "Stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before: People in real estate gave Andrew Cuomo money.\nIt has been a while since I\u2019ve written a story about this, but there was a time when it was a regular thing.\nThe latest campaign filings (showing donations between Jan. 12 and March 13) show RXR CEO Scott Rechler, previously a\nconsistent\ndonor to Cuomo when he was governor, gave Fix the City,\na super PAC backing\nCuomo, $250,000. He also donated $2,100 directly to Cuomo\u2019s campaign this month.\nAn entity tied to Lightstone contributed $100,000 to the PAC. Joseph Paolino Jr., former mayor of Rhode Island turned developer, gave $25,000. A&amp;E Real Estate\u2019s Douglas Eisenberg donated $125,000 to the PAC. Anthony Scarmucci\u2019s Skybridge Capital threw the PAC $100,000. Scarmucci and his wife also each gave $2,100 to Cuomo\u2019s campaign.\nTwenty-one people who self-identified as working in real estate gave Cuomo\u2019s campaign the maximum $2,100, or a total of more than $44,000. That group included Cammeby\u2019s Avi Schron, KRE Group\u2019s Jonathan Kushner, Capstone Equities\u2019 Daniel Ghadamian, Ruben Companies\u2019 Andrew and Richard Ruben, Somerset\u2019s Keith Rubenstein, GFP\u2019s Jeff Gural and BFC Partners\u2019 Winthrop Wharton.\nSeveral employees of L+M Development Partners gave to Cuomo, including Ron Moelis ($400), as did employees of Two Trees Management (including founder David and principal Jed Walentas, with the latter having also donated to Whitney Tilson and Zellnor Myrie).\nDonors who indicated that they work in real estate gave more than $73,000 to Cuomo\u2019s campaign. But many real estate folks are sneaky and list their occupation as CEO or chief executive or self-employed, which is a small part of why sifting through campaign donations is a nightmare.\nAmong that group, in addition to Gural and Rechler, I spotted MAG Partners\u2019 MaryAnne Gilmartin, who donated $1,000 and Ashley Cotton (who\npreviously worked for Cuomo\n), who gave $250. Brown Harris Stevens CEO Bess Freedman donated $250, as did Douglaston Development\u2019s Jessica Sherman.\nReal estate donors in the other campaigns are more scattered. Mayor Eric Adams previously could count on donations from heavy hitters in the industry, but many have\nbacked off\ngiving to his campaign since his indictment. His latest filing shows he only brought in a little more than $36,000 between Jan. 12 and March 13, with only a couple donations from smaller real estate players.\nA PAC tied to the Real Estate Board of New York (Taxpayers for an Affordable New York) gave City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams $2,100.\n\u201cAdrienne Adams has advanced a pro-growth agenda as Speaker, most notably in her support for City of Yes,\u201d REBNY President Jim Whelan said in a statement. He noted that the passage of the broker fee bill, known as the FARe Act, was \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d but said she is an \u201cimportant voice to the Mayor\u2019s race.\u201d\nAdams is also remains an influential force in the city, given that even if she loses the primary, she will be the City Council Speaker through the end of the year.\n\nLaszlo Syrop, managing director of acquisitions at the Hudson Companies, donated $175 to Sen. Zellnor Myrie. Moelis also gave Myrie $400.\nA PAC tied to Airbnb has spent more than $400,000 on ads supporting City Council incumbents Kevin Riley, Oswald Feliz, Amanda Farias, Selvena Brooks-Powers and Mercedes Narcisse. The groups is also supporting Tyrell Hankerson\u2019s bid for Adrienne Adams\u2019 Council seat and Rafael Salamanca\u2019s campaign for Bronx Borough President. The incumbents are all sponsors on a bill that would ease stringent short-term rental rules for allow one- and two-family homes, allowing owners to rent out their property for fewer than 30 days, using sites like Airbnb.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat do you make of real estate companies\nrolling back\ntheir diversity, equity and inclusion policies? Do you have any experiences with these programs and policies? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nThere was a time when mortgages were great? Bill Pulte, the new director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency,\nposted \u201cMake Mortgages Great Again\u201d on social media platform X\non Saturday. On Monday, Pulte removed eight members from the Fannie Mae board and six members from the Freddie Mac board.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 The city agreed to pay cab drivers $140 million in back pay to settle a lawsuit filed in 2006,\nGothamist reports\n. A federal court found that the Taxi and Limousine Commission unfairly revoked licenses from thousands of drivers after they were arrested, even though they were never convicted.\n\u2014 The state will pay $8 million to settle a claim brought by Carl Dukes, who spent nearly two decades in prison for a murder he did not commit,\nthe Times Union reports\n. The settlement comes after a state appellate court ruled that Albany detectives had coerced a confession from Dukes, related to the murder of a University at Albany student in 1997. The court found that Dukes was innocent and should be further compensated for the time he spent incarcerated.\n\u2014 Unless a court says otherwise, the city\u2019s congestion pricing program will continue despite the Friday shutdown deadline set by the Federal Highway Administration,\nCBS New York reports\n. MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber said the \u201cdeadline will come and go and the congestion pricing program will continue to deliver much better traffic environment for New York and economic benefits as well.\u201d\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Tuesday was\n$60 million\nfor a 5,840-square-foot condominium at 150 Charles Street in the West Village. Peter Zaitzeff, Jared Freedman and Samantha Germano of\nSerhant had the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$27.5 million\nfor a 9,765-square-foot commercial building at 34 East 61st Street in Lenox Hill. Christian Advocates Serving Evangelism (CASE) sold the property to Kassin Sabbagh Realty.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$29.5 million\nfor a 4,019-square-foot condominium at 432 Park Avenue in Midtown. The Eklund Gomes Team at Douglas Elliman has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 226,342-square-foot, eight-story, 236-unit project at 694 East 142nd Street in North New York. Alen Moghaddam filed the permit on behalf of NYC\u2019s Building &amp; Land Development Services.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

Hu was\nindicted last month\nfor allegedly bribing the chief executive officer of a nonprofit.\nThe Fresh Meadows hotel has housed formerly incarcerated people since 2021 and served as the site for\nmultiple fundraisers\nto support Adams.\nProsecutors say\nHu paid Julio Medina, the head of a taxpayer-funded program for recently released incarcerated people, elaborate kickbacks including the purchase of a $1.3 million townhouse and financing on a luxury vehicle. In exchange, Hu allegedly received more than $20 million in city-funded contracts for two of her hotels, as well as her catering company.\nHu pleaded not guilty to all charges. She is negotiating a plea agreement, according to court filings, though her criminal attorney denies any negotiations.\nCity Comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander is pushing for the Adams administration to cancel a contract extension that would ultimately steer $20 million towards Hu, according to\nThe City\n. The three-year renewal would begin in July.\n\nA spokesperson for the mayor\u2019s office of criminal justice \u2014 the contract holder \u2014 said the administration is looking for an alternative site, but that it could be challenging; a spokesperson for HousingWorks, the nonprofit occupying the space, said no substantive coordination between the organization and city about relocating has happened.\nSecurity firm owner Christopher Dantzler was also charged in what prosecutors labeled an elaborate kickback scheme involving more than $120 million in public funds being steered toward Exodus. Medina ultimately funneled $51 million in public funds to companies belonging to Hu and Dantzler, according to prosecutors.\nHu was released on a $20 million bond with her passport seized, while Medina and Dantzler were released on $250,000 and $750,000 bonds, respectively. All three defendants pleaded not guilty.\nHu has been on the receiving end of positive regulatory decisions from local officials, including approval of construction projects that were either cited for worker safety or affordable housing violations.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The property is also only steps from Lincoln Center.\nThe property faced controversy when Glenwood\nnot only banned dogs\nweighing 15 pounds or more from the building but also required dogs to be carried by their owners into the elevator to avoid doggy paws scuffing up the lobby floors.\nElsewhere in Lincoln Square, the Gotham Organization and the Carlyle Group\nlanded a $216 million bridge loan\na year ago associated with their acquisition of the building at 200 West 67th Street. The loan, provided by MF1 Capital, was brought to market shortly after Gotham and Carlyle purchased The Aire from A&amp;R Kalimian Realty\nfor $265 million\n.\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Bally\u2019s is hedging a bet on its controversial diversity-focused fundraising plan for its $1.7 billion Chicago casino development on the former Tribune newspaper printing plant site in River West.\nBally\u2019s Chicago is now seeking to raise $195 million through a private share sale, as the Securities and Exchange Commission has halted an effort to raise $250 million through an initial public offering exclusively targeted at women and minority investors, the Chicago Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe shift in fundraising methods comes as the company, a subsidiary of Rhode Island-based Bally\u2019s Corp., is navigating significant regulatory challenges for its project, which is set to become the Windy City\u2019s first full-fledged permanent gambling emporium.\nLast summer, Bally\u2019s Chicago garnered attention with plans for a $250 million IPO exclusively targeting qualified female and minority investors. This initiative was prompted by a mandate from the city of Chicago, stipulating that 25 percent of the new casino must be owned by minorities and women. However, the SEC has yet to approve the IPO, citing the need for updated audited financials from Bally\u2019s Chicago.\n\nIn response to the regulatory delay, Bally\u2019s launched a private placement offering, which has already secured over $83 million from 270 accredited investors, the outlet reported, citing the firm\u2019s financial disclosures. This approach is running alongside the stalled public offering and includes individuals who meet the criteria specified by Chicago\u2019s ownership mandate, according to Bally\u2019s spokesperson Richard Land.\nLegal hurdles loom, however. The IPO has faced federal court challenges, with accusations of discrimination leveled by plaintiffs supported by groups like the American Alliance for Equal Rights and the Liberty Justice Center. These lawsuits argue that the IPO unfairly favors minority and female investors, potentially excluding others from participating in the investment opportunity.\nMeanwhile, Bally\u2019s continues to refund deposits to potential IPO investors as it strives to gain SEC clearance. The company remains optimistic about its casino project, which has recently received site plan approval and is slated to open in September 2026. The complex promises a 500-room hotel, entertainment venues, multiple dining options, and public spaces, and aims to redefine Chicago\u2019s hospitality and gaming scene.\n\u2014 Sam Lounsberry\n",

Investigators discovered one signature belonged to a co-owner who died in 2016.\n\nWeeks later, the defendants allegedly filed forged documents transferring a Kew Gardens Hills home from its mother-daughter owners to another one of Ray\u2019s companies. By May, they had sold this property to a third party for $600,000, according to the indictment, and approximately $442,000 was wired to an account linked to Ray.\nThe third party who purchased the property has since filed a civil suit against the legitimate owners, although proceedings have been stayed under legislation enacted in 2023 to\nprotect against deed fraud\n.\nIn May 2023, the group also allegedly targeted an 82-year-old woman\u2019s Jamaica Estates home using similar tactics.\nAll four defendants surrendered to authorities on Wednesday. They are scheduled to return to court on April 29. If convicted, Ray, Valeri and Avinger face up to 25 years in prison, while Guice faces up to 15 years.\n",

Meiner was upset that O Cinema\u2019s leadership went ahead with the screenings after initially acquiescing to his demand not to show the film, directed by Palestinian activist Basel Adra and Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham.\nLast week, Meiner condemned \u201cNo Other Land\u201d as \u201ca false one-sided propaganda attack on the Jewish people.\u201d\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s meeting, Meiner claimed his reaction was rooted in ensuring public safety for the city\u2019s Jewish constituents amid rising anti-Semitism across the globe because of Israel\u2019s ongoing destruction of Palestine since Hamas terrorists killed more than 1,400 Israelis and kidnapped 240 more on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\u201cThroughout history, there\u2019s been different excuses for hating Jews,\u201d Meiner said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s because Jews are too successful, sometimes because they\u2019re too poor. Now it\u2019s the state of Israel. It doesn\u2019t matter. Every generation it morphs into something else. It\u2019s just a convenient excuse. And that\u2019s what I was trying to highlight.\u201d\nStill, a majority of speakers during the meeting\u2019s public comments voiced opposition to Meiner\u2019s push to evict O Cinema, calling his actions government censorship.\n\u201cWe saw democracy in action,\u201d O Cinema co-founder Kareem Tabsch told\nThe Real Deal\nfollowing the meeting. \u201cThere was an outpouring of support for O Cinema, and I think Meiner did the right thing. I respect his viewpoint and decisions.\u2026It\u2019s not the government\u2019s role to dictate what art organizations should be showing or not showing.\u201d\nA majority of the city commission concurred with Tabsch\u2019s view. \u201cThe First Amendment is clear,\u201d commissioner Fernandez said during the meeting. \u201cThe government must never censor artistic expression even when it is controversial or deeply offensive.\u201d\nVice-Mayor Bhatt noted that O Cinema has shown more than 50 pro-Israel films by Jewish filmmakers, hosts the Miami Jewish Film Festival and screened a 12-hour documentary about the Holocaust. \u201cTo silence that voice does more damage than almost anything I can think of,\u201d Bhatt said. \u201cI will tell you that I\u2019m not censoring anybody.\u201d",

        "content": "Journey Capital scooped up a 404-unit multifamily complex in Plantation for $102 million.\nThe New York-based investment manager bought Rise at Plantation Walk at 333 North University Drive from Boca Raton-based Encore Capital Management, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The deal breaks down to $252,500 per unit.\nJourney borrowed $89.7 million from Houston-based Corebridge Financial.\nRise at Plantation Walk consists of a pair of seven-story buildings completed in 2021 and 2022 on a roughly 2.3-acre site, property records show. It offers studios and one- to three-bedroom apartments, with monthly rents ranging from $2,172 to $4,415, according to Apartments.com.\nThe complex is part of Encore Capital\u2019s mixed-use\nPlantation Walk\nproject on a 32-acre site that used to be Fashion Mall.\nEncore, led by\nArt Falcone\n, bought the then-vacant mall in a bankruptcy auction in 2015 for\n$37.7 million\n. In 2019, Plantation city officials\napproved\nthe redevelopment with up to 700 apartments, about 250,000 square feet of offices and 225,000 square feet of retail.\n\nEncore has sold completed portions of Plantation Walk over the years. In 2021, it sold the seven-story, 177,000-square-foot office building at 261 North University Drive to Vision Properties for\n$57.5 million\n.\nJourney Capital hasn\u2019t been a high-profile player in South Florida\u2019s market. The firm, founded in 2023, buys, develops and manages multifamily, industrial and mixed-use properties across the U.S., according to its website. It\u2019s led by CEO Peter Calatozzo.\nPreviously, Calatozzo was with Praedium Group, his LinkedIn shows.\nSouth Florida\u2019s\nmultifamily\ninvestment sales market has experienced an uptick during recent months after a slowdown over the past two years. Sales volume was $4.3 billion last year and $3.4 billion in 2023, down from $9.2 billion in 2022 and $15.4 billion in 2021, according to data from Avison Young. In 2021 and 2022, South Florida became a magnet for out-of-state residents, fueling\nunprecedented\ndemand from tenants and\nrecord\nrent hikes, but in the later years the market\nslowed\ndue to elevated interest rates and\nhefty new supply\n, which tempered tenant demand.\nLast month, FCP paid\n$90 million\nfor the 400-unit Arium Sunrise complex at 1501 Northwest 124th Terrace in Sunrise. That came on the heels of TA Realty buying the 300-unit Bell Pembroke Pines complex at 16700 Sheridan Street in Pembroke Pines for\n$118 million\n.",

        "content": "Douglas Elliman is celebrating its top-producing agents in New York City, who rose among the ranks of the firm as it waded through a turbulent 2024.\nThe brokerage on Wednesday announced the winners of its annual Ellie awards, recognizing brokers who earned the largest sales volumes and gross commission incomes, and closed the highest number of transactions last year.\nElliman\u2019s agents \u201cdidn\u2019t just have an outstanding 2024; they defined it,\u201d Richard Ferrari, the head of the company\u2019s brokerage, wrote in a statement. CEO Michael Liebowitz pointed to \u201ctheir expertise, entrepreneurial drive, and commitment to excellence\u201d\nAgents and teams with operations in the Big Apple racked up company-wide accolades this year, including the Eklund-Gomes Team, which once again snagged the Billion Dollar Club Award for exceeding $1 billion in sales. The cohort, led by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes, also nabbed the highest GCI among the firm\u2019s mega teams, followed by Noble Black &amp; Partners.\nIn Manhattan, Ann Cutbill Lenane was named the top agent by sales volume, transactions and GCI,\nadding a third honor\nto her spoils from the year prior. Lenane \u2014 who placed 26th in\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nlatest ranking\nof the city\u2019s top agents with $76 million in sell-side deals \u2014 was also the No. 4 agent by GCI for the entire company.\nFollowing Lenane in sales volume and GCI was Michelle Griffith, who led sales at the Reuben Brothers\u2019 Upper East Side hotel-condo conversion, alongside top broker Lauren Muss. The project, known as the Surrey, was a fixture atop\nweekly contract reports\nin the borough, scoring signed contracts for at least three units priced north of $20 million.\n\nThe Michael Lorber Team finished first in sales, transactions and commission income among Elliman\u2019s large teams in New York City. The group slid into the top spot after the 2024 winner, the Holly Parker Team,\njumped from Elliman\nto Compass earlier this year amid a\nwave of brokers\nexiting the firm over the last few months.\nLorber\u2019s team, which placed 11th in\nTRD\u2019s\nrankings with $103 million in sales, was also the third top-earning large team overall.\nAlso among the top teams highlighted in the awards was the Rubin Team, which was No. 1 in GCI and transactions among the firm\u2019s medium teams in Manhattan. The Lindsay Barton Barrett Team earned the most commission income, sales volume and transactions among the company\u2019s small teams.\nIn Brooklyn, the top-selling individual agent was Rebekah Carver, and the top-selling medium and small teams were the Scott Robles Team and The Bartolucci Team, respectively.\nElliman tapped its honorees following an end to the year rife with executive turnover. The firm\u2019s longtime CEO and chairman Howard Lorber abruptly retired in October under pressure from the board.\nThe head of the company\u2019s brokerage, Scott Durkin, was terminated just days after Lorber stepped down from his post. Chief operations officer Richard Lampen also exited the firm at the end of last year.\nElliman, Manhattan\u2019s third-largest brokerage by\nTRD\u2019s analysis\nof sales volume, closed 2024 with a\n$76 million loss\n, up from the $43 million lost the previous year. The brokerage has been in the red for more than two years, though it pushed its revenue above $1 billion last year.\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s real estate industry is pushing back against the anti-gentrification ordinance that took effect this month, with one group launching a letter-writing campaign against it.\nLandlords and brokers are frustrated with the right of first refusal granted to tenants in some Northwest Side neighborhoods, which allows tenants to band together to purchase their buildings ahead of any outside investor.\nThe Chicagoland Apartment Association and the Neighborhood Building Owner\u2019s Alliance said the right of first refusal will delay the sale of buildings, causing problems for owners who may need to sell quickly, and could have a cooling effect on investment in the area.\n\u201cThis ordinance punishes owners of affordable housing, devalues their property, and makes it harder to invest in neighborhood housing,\u201d said Mike Glasser, president of the Neighborhood Building Owner\u2019s Alliance, which launched a letter-writing campaign against the ordinance.\nGlasser\u2019s organization, an alliance of 11 landlord associations, put up a webpage with forms for contacting alderpeople, along with information about the ordinance.\nIt\u2019s also asking members to share personal stories of how the ordinance affected them if they are owners in the area. In addition to legislative tactics, the group is exploring ways to challenge the ordinance in court, according to comments made in an October conference call.\nThey are looking for examples of sellers being harmed by the requirement to give renters in larger buildings a 60-day notice of intent to sell and another 90 days to form a tenant association to decide if they want to buy the building. This timeline is shorter for buildings of four units or fewer, where the total timeline is 45 days.\nThe ordinance was crafted to address documented displacement and gentrification faced by residents in the communities covered by the ordinance, said Kelvin Gensollen Arellano, housing organizer with a community group called Palenque LSNA. The industry\u2019s arguments, on the other hand, are \u201chypothetical,\u201d he said.\nThe ordinance is a pilot program that will sunset at the end of 2029 unless renewed. The program applies to parts of Logan Square, Avondale, Hermosa, Humboldt Park and West Town as well as Pilsen. It is meant to stem exploding housing costs in areas that began gentrifying rapidly about 10 years ago, when developers started tearing down two- and three-flats and replacing them with luxury homes along the 606 trail. The area lost 6.1 percent of its two- to six-flat buildings between 2013 and 2018, according to the DePaul Institute for Housing Studies.\nIn response to the loss of smaller multifamily buildings, the ordinance also allows for the construction of two-flats by right in any areas within the ordinance\u2019s boundaries that are zoned for single-family. Finally, the measure increased demolition surcharges from $5,000 per unit or $15,000 per building to $20,000 per unit and $60,000 per building, whichever is higher.\n\u2018Unintended consequences\u2019 and \u2018trojan horse\u2019 arguments\nAndy Friedman, a multifamily broker with Kiser Group, said owners and developers will just find ways around portions of the ordinance designed to preserve existing affordable housing and protect against displacement, bringing \u201cunintended consequences\u201d to tenants and sellers.\nFor example, sellers will likely move to vacate buildings before selling as a way of skirting tenant rights, meaning less available housing in the area for that period of time, Friedman said.\nThe ordinance prohibits owners from displacing tenants after purchasing a building, requiring them to keep inherited tenants for 6 months or until the end of their lease, whichever is longer. That could pose a challenge for buyers looking to rehab a property and sellers may want to avoid the elongated timeline of granting tenants the right to first refusal. Vacating a property before bringing it to market may become a more attractive option, said Compass broker Mario Greco.\n\nThe increased demolition fees may hurt owners and sale prices in the area as buyers will take that cost off the top of any offers they make, Friedman said. Though he has not seen evidence of a drop in investment or average sale price yet, Friedman said the ordinance has \u201cdefinitely changed the attitude\u201d of developers toward the area.\nWith so much of the area\u2019s affordable housing already bought up by outside investors, Gensollen Arellano said most of the money from multifamily sales was not circulating or being reinvested in\u00a0 local communities anyway. Revenue from the surcharges will go to the Chicago Community Land Trust to support the \u201cconstruction, rehabilitation or preservation of affordable housing\u201d in the area, according to the ordinance. Developers who plan to reserve at least half of proposed units for families who earn up to 60 percent of the area\u2019s median income are exempt from the increased surcharges.\nThe Chicago City Council\namended the ordinance\nin response to concerns from the industry in December, adding the sunset date, delaying implementation of the right to first refusal until March 1 and requiring tenants to provide proof of financial backing to move forward in purchasing a building. The Chicagoland Apartment Association supported these amendments, but it would prefer for the council to overturn the measure altogether, said the organization\u2019s executive vice president Mike Mini. It\u2019s unlikely there is any political will to do so given strong support for the ordinance among aldermen, he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m certain that the evidence is going to show that this is not an effective ordinance, and perhaps then there\u2019ll be an opportunity to revisit this,\u201d Mini said. \u201cIf there\u2019s an opportunity to overturn it, we certainly would participate in that.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Palenque LSNA, which\nworked to get the ordinance passed last fall\n, has launched an education campaign of its own, canvassing Northwest Side neighborhoods to inform tenants about their rights.\n\u201cThis is the first step,\u201d Gensollen Arellano said. The second step has been talking with tenants about the kinds of \u201clegal, logistical and financial support\u201d they might need in order to execute their rights, so that Palenque and others can help bridge that gap, he said.\nBrokers who work in the area said they have yet to see an example of tenants organizing to match an offer from a third-party buyer to purchase their building, and Mini said he doubts the likelihood of it happening, particularly in larger buildings.\nThe timeline afforded to tenants to organize represents an unnecessary delay that will disadvantage small, live-in owners who may have more logistical and timing constraints around buying a property if they are taking out a mortgage, said NBOA member Joe Wilcox, a property manager and broker.\nThe ordinance states that 75 percent of occupied units should be in agreement in order for tenants to move forward with buying their building. That\u2019s more of a challenge in larger buildings, but Palenque LSNA is working to provide support to tenants on a case-by-case basis. Tenants can also opt to transfer their right of first refusal to a third-party organization that is committed to keeping the building affordable, Gensollen Arellano said.\nIndustry players\u2019 arguments that reforms will end up hurting renters or local, small-time landlords are often a \u201ctrojan horse\u201d for less community-minded concerns, he said.\n\u201cMost of the people who are purchasing these two-flats and three-flats are not families. Most of them are very big companies that are trying to resell them at a very big price and de-converting these units into luxury homes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a rational period of time to ask people to wait 30 days. It\u2019s not like the entire world will end during this period of time.\u201d\nBut Mini and others in the industry maintained that if the city really wanted to protect affordable housing in the area, they would remove restrictions on sellers, open up zoning and make it easier to increase the overall supply of housing.\n\u201cThe ordinances in the city of Chicago are such that it makes it very, very difficult to operate a rental property, and that puts upward pressure on rents. Costs are skyrocketing. Insurance is going up. Property taxes are high. Utility charges are high. It\u2019s difficult to get financing,\u201d Mini said. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of headwinds in the apartment industry right now, and until we change our policies to make it easier to build and maintain properties, we\u2019re going to continue to have this problem.\u201d\n",

It relies on Presidio profits and private donations,\nnot taxpayer money\n, according to a Trust report.\nThe White House didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment by the Standard.\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for President Trump to do what the state of California has failed to do,\u201d Charlene Nijmeh, chair of the tribe, said in a statement. \u201cNot only will returning the Presidio to Indigenous care be the right thing for our people and for the land, but it will also save the federal government \u2014 and taxpayers \u2014 money.\u201d\nThe tribe, working with the Lakota People\u2019s Law Project, has launched a\npetition\nseeking public support for the initiative.\n\nTribal officials said they submitted a right of first refusal to the federal government during the decommissioning of the military base in 1992, but faced opposition from prominent California politicians, including the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, both Democrats.\nIn the petition addressed to Trump and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe called the Presidio \u201ca beautiful national park on the tribe\u2019s traditional homelands in San Francisco.\u201d\nIt said the goal of the petition is to \u201crematriate\u201d the Presidio and \u201cestablish a new reservation\u201d there.\n\u201cRematriation,\u201d according to the Sogorea Te\u2019 Land Trust, is \u201cIndigenous woman-led work to restore sacred relationships between Indigenous people\u201d and \u201cancestral land.\u201d\nThe tribe said the \u201crightful return\u201d of the Presidio would be \u201can extraordinary act of reconciliation\u201d and that the Muwekma people maintain a \u201cdeep cultural and spiritual connection to the Presidio lands.\u201d\nThe Muwekma Ohlone Tribe claims on its\nwebsite\nthat it was once federally recognized as the Verona Band of Alameda County but was omitted from the Bureau of Indian Affairs\u2019 first official list of recognized tribes, drafted in 1978, according to the Standard.\nThe tribe has sought to reaffirm its federal status for more than 45 years. There are 614 members of the tribe, living mostly across the Bay Area, an unidentified spokesperson told the newspaper.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Construction is planned in six phases over 11 years, with work on the first phase beginning in June. A second phase is expected to launch in 2027. Qualico\u2019s business units include Sterling Homes and Pacesetter Homes, and it opened a McKinney office in 2018.\nThe 98-acre Erwin Farms, near North Country Lane and FM 1141, will include 123 lots, hiking and biking trails, and two multi-use sports courts. Prices are estimated to range between $750,000 and $1.2 million, with construction expected to span six years. The first residents could move in by mid-2028.\n\nThe developments underscore Rockwall County\u2019s rapid transformation. The county\u2019s population has increased 4 percent in the past year alone, surpassing 137,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Since 2020, it has grown an estimated 25 percent, making it one of Texas\u2019 fastest-growing counties, second only to neighboring Kaufman County.\nThe Dallas-Fort Worth home building market is experiencing significant growth, driven by strong demand and a robust development pipeline. The region is a leader in construction permits,\ntrailing only Houston\nnationally.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

        "content": "President Donald Trump said he wanted strings attached to billions of dollars in federal aid to\u00a0 Los Angeles County, where firestorms this year torched 16,000 homes and businesses.\nBut Republicans in Congress appear to have cooled on conditioning federal aid to California \u2014 which doesn\u2019t appear on the horizon months after the Jan. 7 fires in Altadena and the Pacific Palisades,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nLast month, Gov. Gavin Newsom requested\n$40 billion\nin disaster funding, but there\u2019s little movement on any aid.\n\u201cCongress must receive the formal disaster aid request from the administration,\u201d a spokesperson for House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, said in a statement to the Chronicle.\nThe White House declined to comment on when it might send Congress the request.\nTwo weeks after the fires, Trump\nthreatened to withhold federal aid\nfor the thousands of Los Angeles-area residents who lost their homes unless the state requires voter identification at the polls and opens the water spigot to Southern California.\nDisaster aid will likely get attention from Congress when lawmakers return from district work periods on March 24, Republicans Rep Ken Calvert from Palm Desert, and Rep. Doug LaMalfa from Chico, told the Chronicle.\nCalvert, the most senior California lawmaker and the only California Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, said he suspects there will need to be more than one vote on disaster aid, including one to provide additional funding to the\nFederal Emergency Management Agency\n.\n\n\u201cAt some point, we\u2019re going to have to put a little more money in FEMA, I think, because obviously the debris removal was extremely expensive,\u201d Calvert told the newspaper.\nMembers of Congress from California, including all nine Republicans, signed onto a\nMarch 7 letter\nurging congressional leadership to provide additional assistance to Los Angeles County.\n\u201cJust as the federal government has come to the aid of communities impacted by wildfires across the western United States, tornados in the Midwest, ice storms in Texas, or hurricanes in the Southeast, we should once again support the recovery of the impacted families, businesses, and communities in Los Angeles County,\u201d the lawmakers said.\nSeveral projections have estimated that insured losses from the January wildfires in L.A. County could reach $30 billion or more, making it the\ncostliest natural disaster in state history\n.\nSeveral California Republicans said they want to see a clearer accounting of existing liabilities to determine how much federal money is needed.\n\u201cFEMA is going through all the numbers and identifying what the costs are, and we\u2019re trying to determine the liability \u2014 who\u2019s liable,\u201d whether it\u2019s Southern California Edison, the insurance companies or other entities, Calvert told the Chronicle.\n\u201cRight now, California is hip-shooting a number. They don\u2019t have what amount is insured versus uninsured,\u201d and whether Southern California Edison will have responsibility for the Eaton Fire, added Republican Rep. Darrell Issa from Escondido. \u201cIf they have primary responsibility, that\u2019s a huge difference in the funding \u2014 literally billions of dollars. So we\u2019re prepared to offer a bill, but to put a number on it we do need these items done.\u201d\nIn January, several Republicans\nfloated the idea\nof making wildfire aid for California contingent on policy changes, an idea that drew a\nharsh rebuke\nfrom Anaheim Republican Rep. Young Kim.\n\u201cPlaying politics with people\u2019s livelihoods is unacceptable and a slap in the face to the Southern California wildfire victims and to our brave first responders,\u201d Kim said in a statement.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew",

It was built in 1901 but was renovated and partially reconstructed in 2010 after part of the building collapsed during a condo conversion.

There are also 18 indoor parking spaces on the property that Altitude will offer up with the condos when they go to market.\nAltitude plans to transform the units with finishes and floor plans designed to appeal to wealthy buyers looking to downsize with a Gold Coast home. The condos are set to hit the market in the middle of next year. Dohmen declined to specify price points for the units.\u00a0The building was previously a 50-room long-term-stay hotel called Dearborn Manor, a name that stuck around until at least the 1950s. Later, it was a 27-unit condo building.\n",

        "content": "A trio of Manhattan office buildings scored 10-figure CMBS deals in February, another sign of a post-pandemic recovery for trophy commercial properties.\nThe blockbuster refinancings come amid an overall surge in issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities. CMBS issuances totaled $18.3 billion nationwide last month, more than double January\u2019s total of $7.9 billion, according to KBRA. That\u2019s up 196 percent year-over-year, and the bond ratings association predicted \u201cno likely slowdown on the horizon.\u201d\nThe CMBS market is often considered a bellwether for the overall lending market and the broader commercial real estate market.\nIrvine Company\u2019s famed\nMetLife Building\nlanded the largest CMBS deal, a $1.5 billion loan issued by Bank of America and Wells Fargo.\nAnd Aby Rosen\u2019s RFR Holding got some good news for a change, scoring a $1.2 billion refinancing of the\nSeagram Building\n.\nIvanho\u00e9 Cambridge\u2019s trophy office tower,\n3 Bryant Park\n, grabbed another massive $1.1 billion CMBS loan.\n\u201cThe volumes have been fantastic,\u201d Trepp\u2019s Stephen Buschbom said of bond issuance on The TreppWire podcast. \u201cI\u2019m looking ahead at what\u2019s scheduled into April and we\u2019re just a stone\u2019s throw from hitting $35 billion.\u201d\nThe Real Deal\nbroke down February\u2019s five largest loans in Manhattan and the top five in the outer boroughs:\nNew life for MetLife | $1.5B | Midtown\nBank of America and Wells Fargo\noriginated a $1.5 billion CMBS loan for the Irvine Company\u2019s famed MetLife Building. The loan carries an interest rate of 6.25 percent over 10 years, a sizable jump from the 3.6 percent interest rate Donald Bren\u2019s firm previously faced. The debt-serving costs will double to approximately $100 million a year. The 58-story, 3 million-square-foot building is 94 percent occupied and generates $170 million in net operating income. Ownership, which included Tishman Speyer until it was bought out last year for an unknown price, has invested $180 million in the property dating back to the year before the pandemic.\nRosen refi | $1.2B | Midtown\nMorgan Stanley, Citi Real Estate Funding and JPMorgan Chase\noriginated a $1.2 billion CMBS loan to refinance RFR Holding\u2019s Seagram Building at 375 Park Avenue. The four-year, fixed-rate loan will carry a 6.25 percent interest rate, nearly double the 3.53 percent rate on the existing debt, according to Morningstar Credit. The refinancing package retires $1.15 billion in existing debt, utilizing $24.6 million from existing reserves to complete the payment. The loan structure will fund significant reserves, including a $26 million escrow for contractual free rent and $21.3 million for outstanding landlord obligations. Newmark recently appraised the 38-story, 860,000-square-foot property at more than $1.8 billion. The trophy office tower boasts a 96 percent occupancy rate.\nBryant Park boon | $1.1B | Midtown\nWells Fargo, Bank of America and Bank of Montreal\nprovided a $1.13 billion CMBS loan for Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge\u2019s trophy office tower, 3 Bryant Park. The loan for the 1.2-million-square-foot tower at 1095 Sixth Avenue \u2014 located between West 41st and 42nd streets \u2014 replaces a CMBS loan\nof the same amount.\nThe fresh financing is an encouraging sign for the Canadian investor, which has\nalmost $5 billion worth of loans\nset to mature in the next year. The real estate arm of Quebec\u2019s $300 billion pension fund tore through U.S. cities over the past decade, paying top dollar to buy top-tier properties.\n\nPark Avenue payday | $500M | Midtown\nCiti Group and JPMorgan\nprovided a $500 million loan to refinance Fisher Brothers\u2019\n299 Park Avenue\n. The fresh financing replaces a $325 million loan from a group of lenders. The landlord recently spent $20 million on a capital improvement project at the 42-story, 1.2 million-square-foot tower, which is 95 percent leased. Capital One and UBS combine to take up 30 percent of the rentable square footage in the building and are in place through 2031. Lease expirations are minimal for the next few years.\nWall Street windfall | $275M | Financial District\nApollo Global Management\nprovided a $275 million loan for\nRockpoint and Brooksville Company\u2019s\nresidential tower at 63-67 Wall Street. The two buildings are converted offices with more than 800 total units. The partners purchased the adjacent buildings from DTH Capital and Metro Loft Management in 2016 for $421.5 million, utilizing a\n$280 million loan\nfrom Wells Fargo. Since then, ownership has renovated the properties, upgrading common areas and amenity spaces.\nLogistics loot | $235M | Maspeth\nNew York Life Insurance Company\nprovided a $235 million loan for RXR Realty and LBA Logistics\u2019 vertical warehouse at\n55-15 Grand Avenue\nin Maspeth, Queens. The fresh financing replaces a $316 million loan from JPMorgan Chase.\u00a0 The partners\nspent $72 million in January 2018 on parcels\nfor the\nfive-story warehouse\nand\nAmazon agreed to lease the space\nfor its network of last-mile delivery warehouses.\nStorage swag\u00a0 | $143M | Long Island City\nBank of Montreal\nprovided a $143 million loan to Storage Deluxe for two industrial buildings on 21st and 22nd streets in Long Island City, Queens. The fresh financing replaces an $87 million CMBS loan. The properties at 41-45 21st Street and 41-54 22nd Street span a total of 277,601 square feet.\nRabsky refi | $140M | Fort Greene\nMadison Realty Capital\nprovided a $140 million loan for Rabsky Group\u2019s nearly-completed residential tower at\n240 Willoughby Street\n. The\nsecretive developer led by Simon Dushinsky\nis building a 30-story, 300-unit multifamily building near Fort Greene Park. It also plans to renovate an existing 21-story apartment project with 189 units. Rabsky secured a $72 million construction loan in 2022 from SCALE, the lending arm of Slate Property Group.\nFlatbush funds | $98M | Park Slope, Prospect Heights\nDerby Copeland Capital\nprovided a $98 million loan to Ed and Michael Ostad for their purchase of\na large portfolio of properties\nalong Flatbush Avenue. The Ostads bought the 26-building portfolio of mixed-use properties from Brooklyn\u2019s Pintchik family for $102.5 million.\nShelling out cash | $75M | Coney Island\nGoldman Sachs\nprovided a $74.8 million loan for Elie Fouerti\u2019s multifamily development at 2971 Shell Road in Coney Island. Fouerti Realty and Rybak Development wrapped up construction last year on the eight-story, 189-unit rental building, according to\nNew York YIMBY\n. The fresh financing replaced a $74.8 million construction loan from Popular Bank.",

Brokers in the Hamptons\njoined others\nin markets across the country tapped for accolades based on their sales volume, number of transactions and gross commission income in 2024.\nDouglas Elliman claimed the title of the top brokerage in the Hamptons in\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nlatest ranking\n. The brokerage closed nearly $1.5 billion in sales across more than 430 deals between June 2023 and June 2024.\n\u201cI am incredibly proud of this continued success,\u201d Tom Bourgard, head of Elliman\u2019s operations across Long Island, wrote in a statement.\nThomas Cavallo took home the prize for the most sales and commissions earned last year by an individual agent. Though the Sag Harbor-based broker didn\u2019t land the leading post in 2023, has\npreviously ranked\namong the firm\u2019s top producers in the region.\nSecond place went to Martha Gundersen, who was one of the three top finishers in the categories last year. Gundersen, alongside the No. 3 agent by GCI and sales volume Paul Brennan, was the listing agent for an East Hampton property that landed among the\ntop 10 most expensive\ndeals in the hamlet in 2024. The mansion at 253 Cove Hollow Road sold for $19.2 million.\n\nGundersen placed 17th among\nTRD\u2019s ranking\nof the top-producing agents and teams in the Hamptons between June 2023 and June 2024 with nearly $91 million in sales.\nKristy Naddell on the North Fork closed the highest number of transactions for the fourth consecutive year.\nThe Enzo Morabito Team scored the No. 1 spot by sales volume, transactions and GCI. The team also snagged fourth place in\nTRD\u2019s\nlatest ranking with roughly $150 million in sales across 46 deals.\nAlso notable among the teams honored in the Ellies was Noble Black &amp; Partners, who landed among the 10 groups with the largest sales volume last year. The cohort, which was the No. 2 megateam companywide, only officially\nexpanded to the Hamptons\nin May.\nOn the rest of Long Island, Maggie Keats was the top agent by GCI and sales volume, while Barbara Leogrande was the No. 1 in transactions. The Maria Babaev Team was the top-producing team by GCI and sales volume, with the Lina Lopes Team notching the highest number of transactions.\n",

        "content": "The New York mayoral race is very crowded, and newly released campaign filings show where real estate high-ups are placing their bets.\nAfter much speculation, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo\nlaunched\nhis campaign this month and quickly became the frontrunner. Despite the industry\u2019s complicated relationship with the politician, it was clear that many real estate professionals would back his campaign.\nDonations over the last two months\nbore that out\n.\nRXR Realty CEO Scott Rechler, a longtime supporter of Cuomo, gave Fix the City, a super PAC backing the former governor, $250,000. Rechler also donated $2,100 directly to Cuomo\u2019s campaign, the maximum amount permitted for an individual donor.\nLightstone executives gave the PAC $100,000, and A&amp;E\u2019s Douglas Eisenberg chipped in $125,000. Anthony Scarmucci\u2019s Skybridge Capital threw the PAC $100,000. Scarmucci and his wife also each gave $2,100 to Cuomo\u2019s campaign.\nOther industry donors to Cuomo\u2019s campaign include Cammeby\u2019s Avi Schron, KRE Group\u2019s Jonathan Kushner, Capstone Equities\u2019 Daniel Ghadamian, Ruben Companies\u2019 Andrew and Richard Ruben, Somerset\u2019s Keith Rubenstein, GFP\u2019s Jeff Gural and BFC Partners\u2019 Winthrop Wharton, each giving $2,100.\nNotably, some employees of New York-based title insurance companies also gave to Cuomo,\ndespite the state\u2019s attempts\nto reel in the industry\u2019s practice of wining and dining its clients during his time as governor.\nIn just two weeks, Cuomo raked in a total of $1.5 million, the most of any mayoral candidate (excluding public matching funds). Assembly member Zohran Mamdani raised the second-highest amount, taking in roughly $847,000 between Jan. 12 and March 13. Whitney Tilson received $310,000 during that time, and Comptroller Brad Lander raised nearly $228,000.\nAs for the others: Sen. Zellnor Myrie took in $136,000; Comptroller Scott Stringer, $188,000; Sen. Jessica Ramos, $70,000; and Republican Curtis Sliwa, $76,000 (which is also the total he has raised to date).\nCity Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, who recently jumped into the race and lost out on more than a month of fundraising during this filing period, managed to bring in $128,000 over a few days. Mayor Eric Adams took in a paltry $36,000 over the last two months, though he brushed off the totals raised by his rivals, telling reporters on Monday that \u201ceveryone is catching up to me,\u201d\nThe City reported\n.\nThe real estate industry, however, didn\u2019t just donate to Cuomo. Between Jan. 12 and March 13, real estate professionals, including veterans and lesser-known operators, contributed to Democratic mayoral candidates, with a few even throwing money to Sliwa.\nGeorgetown Companies\u2019 Adam Flatto, for example, gave $2,100 to former hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson in January. Flatto was joined by John Zeiler, founder and managing member of Hudson Housing Capital, who donated $1,000 to Tilson\u2019s campaign.\nTilson also drew $400 from GFP Real Estate co-CEO Brian Steinwurtzel and $250 from Cayre Group\u2019s Robert Cayre. Two Trees Managements\u2019 Jed Walentas, who also chairs the Real Estate Board of New York, gave $250 to Tilson, the same amount he donated to Cuomo\u2019s campaign. During the last filing period, Walentas contributed $400 to Sen. Zellnor Myrie.\n\nDespite being one of the top money-raising candidates, Assembly member Mamdani, a democratic socialist who has pledged to freeze rents for tenants living in stabilized apartments, didn\u2019t woo any large real estate donors. Instead, he received small donations, ranging from $5 to $100, from roughly a dozen residential and commercial brokers.\nCity Council Speaker Adrienne Adams officially launched her campaign a week after Cuomo, giving her the shortest time to raise funds. Even with the passage of the Fairness in Apartment Rental Expenses, or FARE Act, the Real Estate Board of New York showed Adams some support in her first fundraising haul.\nREBNY, through the PAC Taxpayers for an Affordable New York, gave Adams $2,100.\n\u201cAdrienne Adams has advanced a pro-growth agenda as Speaker, most notably in her support for City of Yes,\u201d REBNY President Jim Whelan said in a statement. He noted the passage of the broker fee bill, which requires landlords to pay the rental brokers they hire rather than forcing tenants to cover the cost, during her tenure was \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d but said she is an \u201cimportant voice to the Mayor\u2019s race.\u201d REBNY has\nfiled a lawsuit\nto repeal the law.\nSignature Urban Properties\u2019 Alan Miller gave Adams $400, as did Taconic Partners\u2019 Paul Pariser and Andy Zlotnick. GFP\u2019s Jeffrey Gural donated $250.\nEven if she doesn\u2019t win the primary in June, Adams will continue to serve as City Council Speaker through the end of the year, meaning that she has considerable sway over legislation and land use actions that come before her members.\nSen. Zellnor Myrie was the first of the mayoral candidates to roll out an extensive housing plan, which has earned him\nsome points with developers\n. Haussmann Development founder Josef Goodman gave Myrie $1,800. L+M Development Partners\u2019 Ron Moelis contributed $400, the same amount he donated to Cuomo\u2019s campaign.\nGilbert Winn of Boston-based Winn Companies gave Sen. Jessica Ramos $2,100 in January and then gave the same amount to Cuomo in March. Hudson Companies\u2019 Joe Riggs donated $150 to her campaign, the same amount he gave Comptroller Brad Lander in January.\nLander, meanwhile, received $2,100 from Millennium Partners Management\u2019s Philip Lovett. He also brought in donations from residential agents and nonprofit housing groups.\nBenjamin Companies\u2019 Kenneth Coyle contributed $2,100 to former Comptroller Scott Stringer, and Coldwell Banker kicked in $500.\nCory Zelnik of the commercial brokerage Zelnik &amp; Company gave Republican Curtis Sliwa $250. Marcus &amp; Millichap\u2019s Eric Anton donated $100.\nMayor Eric Adams, meanwhile, only took in a little more than $36,000 over the last two months, with a couple of donations from smaller real estate players. Once a favorite of the industry, some in real estate\nbacked off\ngiving to his campaign after he was\nindicted\nin September.\nThough many candidates have announced what they expect to receive in public matching funds based on this latest filing period, the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board will determine those amounts on April 15.\n",

        "content": "The city is gearing up for a rezoning that could bring 12,000 homes to Jamaica, Queens.\nWith nine months left of the first (and possibly last) term of the Adams administration, one neighborhood rezoning is on the cusp of being approved by the City Council, one just started public review and another is about to do the same on Thursday.\nCity Planning will certify the plan to rezone a swath of Jamaica to allow for the construction of more than 12,000 homes in the Queens neighborhood, of which 4,000 would be income-restricted through the city\u2019s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program. In fact, this would be the largest MIH area ever mapped, according to City Planning. The administration also projects that the rezoning could net 2 million square feet of commercial space.\nThe certification kickstarts the monthslong land use review process, known as the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure. The plan covers more than 300 blocks in and around Downtown Jamaica and will ultimately need buy-in from local Council members Nantasha Williams and James Gennaro, as well as City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, all of whose districts will be affected by the rezoning.\nHere\u2019s a quick recap of where the Adams administration\u2019s neighborhood rezonings stand:\n\u2014 The\nAtlantic Avenue rezoning\nis in the home stretch. On Wednesday, City Planning approved the plan, affecting a 21-block stretch in Central Brooklyn, which the city expects 4,600 new homes will be built. The plan now heads to the City Council.\n\u2014 In August, the City Council\napproved\nthe rezoning of 46 blocks in the Bronx, where a projected 7,000 homes are expected to be built over the next 10 years.\n\u2014\u00a0City Planning\nkicked off public review\nof the Midtown South rezoning in January, which would bring 9,700 units to the area.\n\u2014 The city released a draft for the planned Long Island City rezoning\nlast June\n, which could create 14,000 units.\nOf course the unit projections depend on developers having the appetite to build said units. Right now, the environment for ground-up development isn\u2019t, shall we say, great. Developers have bemoaned interest rates, high construction costs, the threat of tariffs and the wage requirements for projects looking to receive the property tax break 485x.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking abou\nt: What would it take for one of the mayoral candidates to overtake Andrew Cuomo as the presumptive frontrunner before the June primary? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nJamaica, Queens, is named after\u2026 beavers? The neighborhood is not named after the Caribbean island but is believed to instead derive from \u201cjameco,\u201d the Algonquin word for \u201cbeaver,\u201d\naccording to the New York Times\n.\n\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nA fourth person in New York has been diagnosed with measles, Gov. Kathy Hochul confirmed on Wednesday. About 81 percent of 2-year-olds in New York have received their first dose of the MMR vaccine, despite federal recommendations that children get the shot between 12 and 15 months old,\nGothamist reports\n. Three of the confirmed cases were in NYC, with one reported out of Suffolk County.\n\u2014\nIt is the end of an era. The MTA will stop selling MetroCards at the end of the year\n,\nthe New York Times reports\n.\n\u2014 Former First Deputy Mayor Maria-Torres Springer has a new gig,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. She is starting a fellowship at the Ford Foundation.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Wednesday was\n$6 million\nfor a 1,264-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at 685 Fifth Avenue in the Plaza District. McKenzie, Jade Mills and Alexander Boriskin of Douglas Elliman\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$68.5 million\nfor a 92,722-square-foot, 105-unit apartment building at 237 11th Street in Park Slope. Davidson Kempner sold the property to Living, N.Y.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$18.7 million\nfor a 3,851-square-foot condo at 33 East 74th Street in Lenox Hill. Kevin B. Brown and Craig George of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 60,702-square-foot, five-story school building at 1472 Boston Road in Crotona Park East. Matthew McChesney of KSS Architects filed the permit on behalf of Civic Builders.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "A Holmby Hills mansion tied to one of Los Angeles fashion\u2019s most prominent families is back on the market as it tries another price on for size.\nThe Azria Estate at 10250 West Sunset Boulevard, which has been\non and off the market\nfor the better part of a decade, once asked for as much as $88 million. It more recently reentered the Los Angeles real estate market with a $39 million asking price, after last being listed for $55 million in 2023.\nThe re-list comes after seller Lubov Azria, who owned the property with her late husband and BCBG founder Max Azria, placed the home on the auction block last May. Auctioneer Concierge Auctions estimated in the lead up to the sale the starting price could be as much as $38 million.\nLubov Azria did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday on the listing.\nA legal tussle arising after the auction\u2019s close has since stymied any movement on a sale of the property, which even\nJennifer Lopez\nhad been reportedly eyeing in the fall.\nRon Burkle\n, founder of private equity firm Yucaipa Companies, claimed in a Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit last June that his $30 million offer was the highest bid, but Azria \u201crefused to complete the sale except on additional terms.\u201d\nAaron Gordon, general counsel for Concierge Auctions, confirmed in a declaration filed in court Burkle had the winning bid but did not sign the sale agreement or pay the 12 percent escrow deposit within the two-business-day deadline. The tardiness caused Burkle to be in default.\n\nBurkle is now on the hook to pay a little over $36,000 for Azria\u2019s attorney fees and other lawsuit-related costs, a judge ordered in September. Three months later, Burkle filed to drop his lawsuit.\nWith the legal row out of the way, Azria will now try her hand once again at finding a buyer. She tapped The Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Branden Williams and Rayni Williams to market the property, which sits on a nearly 3-acre lot.\nThe agents did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday on the re-listing or the new price.\nThe Azria Estate counts a total of 60 rooms, including 14 bedrooms and 25 bathrooms.\nThe sizable property has been used to host Oscar parties, charity gatherings and other events.\nBuilt in 1939, the Paul Williams-designed Colonial consists of a main house and a separate 5,500-square-foot theater and game room. Outdoors is a tennis court, infinity pool, sauna, gardens, team room and greenhouse.\n",

        "content": "Four years after Los Angeles Council member Nithya Raman introduced a motion to clear out\nillegal, unregistered Airbnb and other short-term rental operations\n, the city may finally be cracking down.\nThe City Council unanimously voted Tuesday to explore how to increase enforcement of its home-sharing ordinance and residential hotel rules,\nCity News Service reported\n.\nThe council directed city departments to report on how much money and people they would need to take action.\nWhat\u2019s not clear is why it took four years for Los Angeles to consider addressing the problem.\nIn 2021, Raman, a Democrat, introduced a motion seeking to address problems with cracking down on illegal home sharing, which she said were \u201cdestabilizing\u201d neighborhoods. It was backed by fellow Democrats \u2014 Council member Bob Blumenfield and former Council members Mike Bonin, Paul Koretz and Kevin de Le\u00f3n.\nThe reason: illegal home-sharing had ushered in party houses, unauthorized events, and large yoga retreats, clothing boutiques and other commercial ventures, according to Raman. They\u00a0 also led to violent crime and homicides.\nIllegal home-sharing operations also buck up against legal brick-and-mortar businesses, allowing illegal advantages against tenants who rent commercial storefronts, from yoga studios to banquet halls.\nIllegal rentals \u201ctake your neighbors away and they remove affordable and protected rent-stabilized units from the long-term housing market, which is bad for L.A.,\u201d Raman stated in her motion.\nRaman said her constituents have been \u201cparticularly impacted.\u201d The Fourth District, which she represents, had the highest volume of both permitted and illegal home-sharing, putting a dent in its quality of life.\n\nSince the Home-Sharing Ordinance took effect in 2019\n, there have been problems with enforcement because of poor communication between departments and weak guardrails against bad landlords, Raman said.\nThe law regulates home-sharing through Airbnb, among other platforms.\n\u201cGood hosts go to extraordinary lengths to ensure they\u2019re in compliance with our laws,\u201d Raman said. \u201cWe should reward them and make sure that bad-faith hosts are treated with the appropriate enforcement actions.\u201d\nA property owner with a home of 2,500 to 5,000 square feet who has violated the ordinance would face a $3,000 penalty. Subsequent fines would be doubled.\nThe city may increase fines based on square footage of a rental in use during a violation.\nAmong the proposals to beef up enforcement is a public database for permit and citation information, making it easier to file complaints and submit evidence.\nThe Los Angeles Housing Department requested 18 new positions to help with investigations and issuing citations. As of October, about 300 administrative citations were referred to housing regulators, out of an estimated 7,500 home-sharing violators, according to a report.\nCity officials requested more staff to aid the City Attorney\u2019s Office with hearings and nuisance cases, which could lead to more revenue for enforcement.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

To move forward, approvals will be needed from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council.\n\nThe area has seen\nan influx of interest from developers and real estate investors\nahead of the presidential center\u2019s planned spring 2026 completion. It has also stoked fears of gentrification in the surrounding Woodlawn Neighborhood.\nNeighborhood leaders have proposed various anti-gentrification efforts in the area, including the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance. The ordinance established affordability requirements on all rental and for-sale housing developed on city-owned residential land and gave tenants the\nright of first refusal\nwhen a rental property is sold.\nThe right of first refusal is meant to prevent the area\u2019s naturally occurring affordable housing \u2014 particularly two- to four-flats \u2014 from being replaced with pricey residential developments. The provision requires landlords to notify tenants when they intend to sell and give them time to match the bid of a third-party buyer.\nChicago\u2019s hotel development pipeline has fallen to the lowest level in recent years as construction lending froze up, with fewer than 1,500 rooms under construction in the fourth quarter, CoStar\nreported\n.",

The city had 47.5 percent fewer office visits in February 2025, compared with the pre-Covid month of February 2019, while Chicago saw a 48.5 percent decline in the same time period.\nThe nationwide figure is off 36.3 percent, with top markets like New York and Miami only 17 percent and 20 percent behind their respective 2019 office visits. The figures are based on cell phone data from about 1,000 office buildings across the country, typically about 100 buildings per market, and do not include government properties for privacy and security reasons.\nChicago and San Francisco have been the bottom two markets for RTO while New York City and Miami have been at the top since the location analytics company began tracking office visit data in early 2021, according to R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai. The Windy City\u2019s freezing February and the commute-snarling construction on its roadways, along with tech employers pushing more days in office, may have finally lifted San Francisco out of last place, said Hottovy, who is based in Chicago.\n\u201cCongratulations San Francisco!\u201d Hottovy joked of the second-to-last victory. \u201cIt\u2019s been a horse race between these two markets for some time now.\u201d\nIn addition, while Placer.ai data shows that RTO appears to be stalling out in many cities, San Francisco is still improving. Nationwide, there was a 6.3 percent drop in office visits in February 2025 compared to February 2024, and only 3.5 percent of that drop can be attributed to last year\u2019s extra day for Leap Year. But San Francisco figures were only down 1 percent, the third-best in the nation after Miami and Boston, which were both at about half a percent below last year. Chicago office visits were down 8.2 percent in that same period.\n\u201cThere are green shoots everywhere in San Francisco, and these numbers are an early indication that we are moving in the right direction,\u201d Mayor Daniel Luire, who\nrecently set an April 28 deadline\nfor city workers to be in-office four days a week, told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cOur administration is leading by example, and many of our partners in the private sector are on the same page, bringing workers back to the office and kickstarting our downtown recovery.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco Chief Economist Ted Egan cautioned that Placer\u2019s office data \u201cshows a lot of volatility\u201d from month to month, and is just one indicator of RTO strength. But combined with other data points, like increased transit ridership and office demand, it adds up to \u201cgood news for the city\u2019s continuing economy recovery,\u201d he said.\nHottovy agreed that he\u2019d like to see a few more months of improved office visit data before he could call the RTO improvement a true trend, but that even this first month out of last place is \u201cencouraging.\u201d\nPopulation numbers have recently started to rise in the city, he said, and\ntech mandates on RTO\nwill continue to have a big impact as well.\n\u201cMaybe there\u2019s some hope,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe this is the first month of more pronounced recovery in terms of return to office, but it really is too soon to say.\u201d\nThere were 2.2 million square feet of office leased in San Francisco in the first quarter of 2025, according to early data from CBRE, slightly less than the fourth quarter of 2024 but 50 percent higher than the full first quarter of 2024. If San Francisco continues on this leasing trajectory, it will exceed the 8 million square feet leased in all of 2024, according to Colin Yasukochi, executive director of data for CBRE.\nThere were about 5 million square feet of office requirements in the first quarter, which is lower than previous quarters, but represents the highest level of company expansions since the pandemic at just over 20 percent of the total. Almost all of that growth demand is coming from the 30\nAI companies\nwhich are seeking a combined 1 million square feet of office space in the city, Yasukochi said.\nInvestors\ncertainly seem to be betting on San Francisco\u2019s recovery, according to Yardi data. San Francisco was the third-priciest market nationally, with office properties trading at $282 per square foot in the first two months of the year, compared with $177 per square foot nationally and $67 per square foot in Chicago.\n",

        "content": "In a rarity for commercial real estate these days, the value of a Montauk asset jumped after a short stay in special servicing.\nGurney\u2019s Montauk Resort &amp; Seawater Spa\n\u2014 owned by Lloyd Goldman\u2019s BLDG Management \u2013\u00a0was recently reappraised at $280 million, a 15 percent increase from its $244 million value when the loan was made in 2021.\nA spokesperson for BLDG did not immediately comment.\nWhen the loan was first issued, the high-end resort was the toast of the island. DBRS Morningstar said the hotel \u201cperformed extremely well\u201d during the early days of Covid as wealthy New Yorkers flocked to it for a close-to-home oceanside sojourn. But the $271 million loan ultimately landed in special servicing for maturity default in\nlate 2024\n, a transfer BLDG chalked up to an administrative hiccup that delayed the loan extension.\nDespite loan data showing a years-long trend of declining occupancy and revenue that could not cover monthly mortgage payments, the BLDG team stressed that the deal was in good shape.\n\u201cThe hotel continues to thrive and remains an outstanding asset in the portfolio,\u201d BLDG COO Justin Kleinman said in January.\n\nAround that time, Gurney\u2019s was shuttered for renovations.\nIn February, the resort reopened and BLDG scored another year to pay off the debt. The trade-off: a $9.4 million\npaydown\nof the loan and a $3.1 million personal guarantee.\nThrough the paydown, BLDG was able to hit a debt yield hurdle \u2014 a means to measure asset health by weighing revenue against the loan amount. The $3 million served as an extra cushion if income slipped.\nAny time an asset transfers to special servicing, it typically receives an updated appraisal.\nThe resort\u2019s facelift, which is ongoing, likely drove the value bump. Gurney\u2019s soft-launched The Dune Caf\u00e9 &amp; Lounge earlier this winter, according to the\nNew York Post\n. Two other restaurants, Gigi\u2019s Montauk and Gigi\u2019s Caf\u00e9, are set to open this spring, according to\nDan\u2019s Papers\n.\nWhen BLDG and partner Metrovest Equities bought Gurney\u2019s in 2014, the team pumped $54 million into refreshing guest rooms, common areas, amenities and restaurants and building out a $16.4 million spa that draws on ocean water to fill a full-size swimming pool.\n",

        "content": "In recent years, South Florida\u2019s office market appeared resilient to financial woes experienced elsewhere in the U.S. Major companies leased across the tri-county region, making brokers giddy. Developers announced plans for new South Florida office projects, offering flashy renderings.\nYet by now, some of these projects are canceled or paused. The progress and success of others remain in doubt due to a lack of preleasing.\nThe market \u201cwas a little bit bullish early on because you saw so many companies coming into town, lots of law firms, lots of financial firms,\u201d said Lisa Colon, a real estate development attorney at Saul Ewing. \u201cThat has definitely slowed a little bit \u2026 lenders are just requiring more.\u201d\nIndeed, while companies never preleased office space years in advance in South Florida before, this has changed. Financiers generally want to see 30 percent to 40 percent of space preleased before providing a loan for a large project. Brokers said they are seeing a revival of demand in the past three months, which they attribute to the end of uncertainty after the presidential election. But most tenants are looking for small to medium-sized offices and not big headquarter spaces, meaning the uptick in demand isn\u2019t enough to secure the preleasing necessary for major office projects.\n\u201cThe majority of the demand I am seeing right now is 5,000 square feet to 10,000 square feet or less,\u201d said Cyril Bijaoui of Longstead at Corcoran. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s more entry level sort of sizes, and to lease-up a mega floor plate [project], especially prelease it, that\u2019s tough.\u201d\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nanalysis of the status of office projects proposed from 2021 to 2023 shows that the larger towers are either canceled or paused. One developer put an office project on hold to focus on a smaller one.\nSkyrocketing insurance and elevated interest rates have also played a role. Although the Federal Reserve lowered the benchmark rate three times last year, after 11 aggressive hikes in 2022 and 2023, hopes for more decreases this year are dwindling. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate remains at over 4 percent, though developers tend to pay more than this to cover lenders\u2019 spread.\nPlus, the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as well as its deportation policies also are expected to boost construction costs. The U.S. construction industry procures most of its lumber from Canada and aluminum and steel from Canada and Mexico, according to Colon.\nHere are the South Florida\noffice\nprojects that developers are canceling and pausing, as well as those that remain in question.\nOne Brickell City Centre\nIn 2022, Swire Properties and Related Companies revealed plans for One Brickell City Centre supertall, marking likely the biggest office project ever envisioned for Miami.\nThe roughly 1,000-foot tall tower would have 1.4 million square feet of offices, with floor plates ranging from 40,000 square feet on upper floors to 60,000 square feet on lower floors. It was slated to rise at Swire\u2019s Brickell City Centre mixed use complex.\nBut in January, Swire nixed One Brickell City Centre, with President Henry Bott\ntelling\nBloomberg \u201cthe pre-leasing for that specific scheme has not materialized in the way that we had hoped.\u201d (Related wasn\u2019t involved in the project by then.)\nTo meet lenders\u2019 pre-leasing requirements, the developer would have had to secure tenants for 420,000 square feet to 560,000 square feet of the space before securing construction financing.\nWhile interest in One Brickell City Centre was strong, demand ultimately didn\u2019t meet the needed threshold, according to a source familiar with the project.\nThe 2.8-acre site at 700 Brickell Avenue and 799 Brickell Plaza is for sale. An asking price hasn\u2019t been disclosed.\nGateway Group\u2019s Mid-Beach offices\nLast year, the Giller family jumped on Miami Beach\u2019s office trend with plans for a seven-story building near Mount Sinai Medical Center.\nThe seven-story building at 976 Arthur Godfrey Road and 3915-3925 Alton Road would have had 28,200 square feet of offices on the top three levels. The family\u2019s Gateway Group was betting on both new-to-market and longtime South Florida tenants, as well as medical office demand, Ira Giller said last year.\nConstruction was supposed to start in January. Instead, the Gillers\nsold the site\nlast month.\nThey had budgeted for elevated interest rates and other economic headwinds. But once the Trump administration imposed tariffs and deportation policies, the equation changed, Giller said.\n\u201c\nThat would have a direct impact on the cost of construction. We bring in a lot of construction materials from Canada and Mexico [such as] steel and aluminum,\u201d he said. \u201cMy assessment of my cost to build didn\u2019t take into account the implementation of those elements. With 20 [percent] to 30 percent of tariffs and [deporting] 10 million people in labor, I felt like costs were going to go up significantly.\u201d\nOne Thousand Group\u2019s office-to-condos switcheroo\nOne Thousand Group \u2013\u2013 led by Louis Birdman, Kevin Venger and Michael Konig\n\u2013\u2013\nproposed a 47-story tower with 312,000 square feet of offices in Miami\u2019s Edgewater in 2023.\nIn December, One Thousand Group paid\n$53 million\nfor the 1.6-acre development site at 3601 Biscayne Boulevard and 345 and 409 Northeast 36th Street.\nYet, this time its plans are for a mixed-use branded condo tower with a helipad.\nThe move is in line with South Florida market trends. Last year, offices already experienced less interest from out-of-state firms, more\nsublease availability\nand higher interest rates, prompting some tenants to pause leasing plans. The condo market remains more resilient, with demand from out-of-state buyers continuing.\n\nIn a statement, Venger said One Thousand Group didn\u2019t switch to condos due to any issues with Miami\u2019s office market, arguing the asset class \u201cremains strong.\u201d\nThe development firm \u201cstill considers office use within its commercial programming [at the tower], but with tenants re-leasing close to lease end, preleasing is limited,\u201d Venger said.\nOne Thousand Group is best known for completing the Zaha Hadid-designed\nOne Thousand Museum\ncondo tower at 1000 Biscayne Boulevard in downtown Miami.\nAbbhi Capital hits brakes on Miami Worldcenter offices\nIn 2023, Abbhi Capital wanted to bring offices to the massive Miami Worldcenter mixed-use complex, mostly home to condos, apartments and retail.\nThe Coral Gables-based firm proposed a 33-story tower with nearly 370,000 square feet of offices, as part of a larger project that included a 59-story, 558-unit residential building.\nPlans are currently on hold, according to a source familiar with the project, declining to elaborate on the reason.\nGoldman\u2019s Core Wynwood\nGoldman Properties\u2019 Core was supposed to be an eight-story building with 99,400 square feet of offices in Miami\u2019s Wynwood.\nIn 2022, Goldman \u2013\u2013 founded by the late Tony Goldman, a pioneer developer in the neighborhood \u2013\u2013 scored approval for Core on the 0.6-acre site at 373-391 Northwest 24th Street and 376 and 390 Northwest 25th Street.\nBut construction never started.\n\u201cWe are putting it on hold because of rising construction costs and interest rates,\u201d Goldman CEO Scott Srebnick said, adding that Core is paused for about three to five years.\nYet, the firm is still betting on Wynwood\u2019s office market. This year, the city approved Goldman\u2019s five-story 2400 building with 10,000 square feet of retail and 38,000 square feet of offices. It is planned for 2400-2500 Northwest Second Avenue.\nSo how is the 2400 building a better investment now than Core? It will offer smaller suites, ranging from 1,600 square feet to 2,000 square feet, which are in high demand in Wynwood, Srebnick said.\n\u201cWynwood in particular attracts the entrepreneur, the creative user, the startup. They typically require a smaller office plate,\u201d Srebnick said. It \u201cis very much an entrepreneurial culture with small VCs, small companies, architecture firms, designers.\u201d\nConstruction is expected to start in July, he said.\nBancroft Hotel\nA hotel-to-office conversion on South Beach was first announced in 2021.\nAt the time, Boca Raton-based Pebb Capital, Coconut Grove-based Maxwelle Real Estate Group and Russell Galbut bought the shuttered five-story hotel at 1501 Collins Avenue and a building next door for $47 million from a Galbut affiliate. They announced plans to convert about half the 100,000-square-foot hotel into offices.\nThe project is paused, with other development options under review, Pebb said in a statement.\nKey International\u2019s 848 Brickell\nThe\nArdid family\u2019s\nKey International seized on Brickell\u2019s office boom in 2023 with a proposal for a 51-story, 750,000-square-foot office tower.\nThe project, called 848 Brickell, would replace Key International\u2019s existing 13-story office building on the site at 848 Brickell Avenue in Miami. The firm has its headquarters there.\nKey International, founded by patriarch Jose Ardid and led by his sons, Inigo and Diego Ardid, didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment. The firm hasn\u2019t formally canceled or announced delays of the project.\nThe Ardids aim to prelease 40 percent to 50 percent of space before pursuing construction financing, Inigo and Diego Ardid told\nTRD\nlast year.\nThe plans also come as Santander Bank and billionaire Ken Griffin pursue their own office towers in Brickell. While most of the space in each will be owner occupied, they also may offer space for lease, posing competition for 848 Brickell, amid less activity from out-of-state firms.\nSantander plans to convert its 14-story building at 1401 Brickell Avenue into a\n41-story tower\nwith about 800,000 square feet of offices. The Spanish bank has its offices at the existing building and will occupy part of the space in the new building.\nGriffin\nfiled plans\nlast summer for a supertall that will serve as headquarters for his Citadel and Citadel Securities. The tower at 1201 Brickell Bay Drive, 1221 Brickell Avenue and 1250-1260 Brickell Bay Drive also will have a luxury hotel, retail and restaurants.",

        "content": "A 250,000-square-foot shopping center in Harlem may be on the verge of defaulting on its debt. Grid Properties principal Drew Greenwald isn\u2019t sweating it.\nCo-owners Grid and the Gotham Organization could default on a $108 million mortgage backing Harlem USA at 300 West 125th Street, according to an analysis by credit rating agency KBRA\nreported\nby Crain\u2019s. Investors could take a $26 million hit on the \u201cloan of concern,\u201d according to KBRA.\nThe root of concern appears to be the 26 percent vacancy rate, which is 10 percentage points higher than the neighborhood average, according to the Department of City Planning. Modell\u2019s Sporting Goods, Chuck E. Cheese, and\nBuffalo Wild Wings closed\nduring the pandemic, but none have been replaced so far and 50,000 square feet are left empty. The vacancy rate was only 5 percent the year before the onset of the pandemic.\nThe loan is slated to come due next year, when ownership will likely face interest rates above the current 3.3 percent.\nKBRA estimated the property is worth $82 million, well below the value of the most recent mortgage.\n\nDespite long-term vacancies, co-owner Greenwald said he believes the complex will be fully leased in the next 12 months. He claims an unnamed supermarket will arrive soon and the property is generating more than enough cash to pay its bills. The KBRA analysis appears to validate that confidence, as the property is generating 170 percent of the necessary cash for existing debt obligations.\n\u201cI\u2019m not the least bit worried,\u201d Greenwald told the outlet of KBRA\u2019s analysis.\nHarlem USA, located across the street from the famed Apollo Theater, was the first property in the neighborhood to host national chains. Tenants include Old Navy, which is on a lease for 35,000 square feet set to expire in 2028, and the nine-screen AMC Magic Johnson movie theater, set to continue occupying nearly 70,000 square feet until at least 2030.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Discrimination against voucher holders has been illegal since 2008 but is still one of the most common types of housing discrimination, according to the city\u2019s Commission on Human Rights.\nThe half-dozen bills the City Council is weighing would stiffen penalties against both landlords and brokers for voucher discrimination.\n\u201cWe know the stories too well of tenants who are turned away from apartments because they are on a voucher, because they have Section 8, because they have a public benefit,\u201d said Councilmember Krishnan.\nOne proposal would add source of income discrimination to a list covered by the Certificate of No Harassment program, potentially allowing the city to deny building or construction permits. Another proposal would increase the maximum civil penalty for those who defy Commission on Human Rights orders.\n\nThe other proposals:\nBase landlord fines on the number of buildings they own, increasing penalties for large corporate landlords, a common denominator in source of income complaints\nProhibit credit history requirements for voucher holders\nRequire applicant notification if denial is based on a tenant screening report\nPublic disclosure of landlords found guilty of source of income discrimination\nRental vouchers are one option to help propel households from the city\u2019s shelter system to permanent housing. As of the end of last year, nearly 52,000 households were taking advantage of CityFHEPS vouchers alone, according to city officials.\nOpen discrimination against holders of Section 8 vouchers is\non the decline\n, Housing Rights Initiative founder Aaron Carr told\nThe Real Deal\nlast year, but prospective renters still have horror stories about being ghosted or deterred from using their subsidies.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A fast-fashion retailer\u2019s bankruptcy is leaving vacancies in 32 malls across Texas.\nForever 21 filed for bankruptcy for the second time in six years, citing rising costs and increased competition from overseas brands. The company\u2019s operator, F21 OpCo, voluntarily filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on Sunday, the Austin American-Statesman\nreported\n.\nAs part of the restructuring, Forever 21 will begin winding down its U.S. operations while searching for a buyer for its remaining assets. The retailer\u2019s stores and website will remain operational during the process. The company is seeking court approval to use cash collateral to continue paying employee wages and benefits.\nForever 21 has struggled to keep pace with low-cost competitors such as Shein and Temu, which have attracted consumers with trendy fashion at lower prices. While Forever 21 sells T-shirts for around $10, Temu offers similar items for as little as $5, for example. The growing dominance of these online retailers, coupled with economic pressures, has made it difficult for Forever 21 to maintain its market position.\nThe brand first filed for bankruptcy in 2019 before being acquired by a consortium that included Authentic Brands Group and Simon Property Group.\n\nBuying Forever 21 \u201cwas probably the biggest mistake I made,\u201d Authentic Brands CEO Jamie Salter said at a conference last year, Retail Dive\nreported\n.\nBut the brand is seeking buyers to salvage the business.\n\u201cRetail is changing, and like many brands, Forever 21 is adapting to create the right balance across stores, e-commerce and wholesale,\u201d Jarrod Weber, global president of lifestyle at Authentic Brands,\ntold\nFox Business.\nHigh occupancy, historic demand and stagnant development have defined the retail market across the Texas Triangle for the past couple of years. While big-box stores such as Conn\u2019s, Big Lots and Party City are shutting down, their spaces are often backfilled by retailers including Burlington and Ollie\u2019s Bargain Outlets, as well as various fitness concepts and specialty grocers, according to Weitzman.\nTexas\u2019 regional shopping malls are healthier after decades of decline and redevelopment. Occupancy was 93.4 percent among Dallas-Fort Worth malls at the end of last year, for example, up from 91.3 percent a year earlier, Weitzman said.\n",

        "content": "\u201cProfit\u201d is such a dirty word to some Americans it makes you wonder if they realize it has made the United States the richest nation in the world.\nWhich brings us to an astonishing rent control saga in Washington Heights.\nCovering a case pitting 78-year-old Freda Henderson against landlord Westside Ventura II LLC, Gothamist wrote, \u201cHer lawyer said in a statement that the judge\u2019s decision ensures Henderson can stay in her affordable home and protects her from the landlord\u2019s goal of evicting her to maximize profits.\u201d\n\u201cThis case is not just about one tenant,\u201d said Patrick Tyrrell of Mobilization for Justice, who represented Henderson. \u201cIt is part of a pattern of landlords exploiting legal loopholes to erode rent protections and displace long-term residents.\u201d\nWait a second. Exploiting loopholes? Eroding rent protections? Displacing residents?\nGiven the facts of the case, Tyrell\u2019s characterizations look a lot like spin. And dissecting his argument helps debunk some common myths associated with rent control and the motivations underlying both landlords and tenants.\nLet\u2019s start with his attack on profit. Setting aside whether the law entitles Henderson to a rent-controlled unit, her lawyer\u2019s demonization of profit is hypocritical.\nCapitalism works because people are trying to profit. That is why communist China switched to a market economy \u2014 pulling a billion people out of poverty and supercharging productivity. Yet Tyrell is portraying profit as a\ncause\nof poverty.\nIf the landlord is trying to \u201cmaximize profits,\u201d the tenant is trying to minimize rent. Which is really the same thing. Henderson\u2019s profit is her income (Social Security) minus expenses. Her primary expense is likely her rent, which is \u2026 wait for it \u2026 $640 a month.\n\nThat\u2019s for a two-bedroom in Manhattan, where the\nmedian rent is $4,500\n.\nTo accomplish her goal of maximizing profit, when her longtime roommate died, Henderson, who was not on the lease,\nkept paying the $640 rent in his name\nand hoped the landlord wouldn\u2019t notice. For years, he never did.\nBut in 2017 a new landlord caught on to her ruse and sought to convert the unit from rent-controlled to\nrent-stabilized\n.\nThat is how the law was designed in New York. It\u2019s not a loophole. It\u2019s the intent of the legislation. Fifty years ago, when rent control was replaced with rent stabilization, tenants were allowed to keep their rent-controlled leases until they moved out or died.\nIf the landlord can be said to be \u201cexploiting a loophole\u201d by evicting a tenant who was not on the lease, the tenant can be said to be exploiting a loophole by saying she was the previous tenant\u2019s common-law wife and thus entitled to succession rights.\nThat is what the judge ruled, by the way, although the decision could be reversed on appeal. Both sides certainly have a case. One could even argue that Henderson was the exploiter for occupying a $640-a-month two-bedroom in the name of a deceased tenant.\nBut to give the impression that the decline in rent-controlled units \u2014 from 100,000 three decades ago to 24,000 in 2023, as Gothamist noted \u2014 is \u201cpart of a pattern\u201d to \u201cdisplace long-term residents,\u201d as Tyrell said, is wrong.\nHere are the facts:\nRent control is being deliberately phased out by the state and replaced with rent stabilization. Landlords are trying to charge and collect the legal rent on their units. Westside Ventura II LLC and Freda Henderson are both trying to assert their rights under state law. The courts will decide who is right.\n",

It said the landlord was in talks\nwith lenders\nBarclays and Citigroup for months leading up to the December maturity default\nThe Real Deal\n, however, had reported in July that Maximus had\ndefaulted on $1.775 billion in loans\ntied to the blighted complex.\nIt was in 2019 that Maximus recapitalized $1.8 billion debt with $1.5 billion in senior financing from Barclays and Citi and a $275 million mezzanine loan from Aimco.\nMaximus had proposed redeveloping the World War II-era garden apartments by adding 5,700 homes, 230,000 square feet of shops and restaurants, 80,000 square feet of offices and a 64,000-square-foot community center.\nAlthough plans for its redevelopment were approved in 2011, and\nnew renderings put out\nin 2022, the project never broke ground, with Maximus founder Rob Rosania citing \u201csky-high construction costs, inflation and supply chain issues.\u201d\n\nRosania said in December his firm was planning to close a loan extension in \u201ccoming weeks.\u201d Notes sent to bondholders this month said future lender actions could include foreclosure.\nLast April, $1.8 billion in loans backed by Parkmerced were\nturned over to special servicing at the request of the landlord\n, citing high vacancy and a looming loan maturity.\nIn May, the\nSan Francisco Chronicle reported\ndozens of Parkmerced tenant complaints about broken elevators, lack of lighting in public areas, mold and mildew, leaks, car break-ins, rodents, overflowing dumpsters and squatters taking over vacant units.\nThe publication said the landlord may have cut back on security and maintenance, leading to\nrising crime and blight\n.\nParkmerced, a planned development from Metropolitan Life and designed by Leonard Schultze and Associates, opened its first apartments in 1944 for homecoming war veterans. It\u2019s the second-largest complex in the state behind L.A.\u2019s historic Park La Brea, another garden apartment complex with 4,225 units.\nDouglas Wilson, founder of his eponymously named company, said its goal will be to safeguard Parkmerced and work toward its \u201crepositioning.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been lacking capital for some time,\u201d Wilson told the Business Journal, adding his firm would address issues with life safety and spending. The company is considering bringing in a new property management firm.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "A long-neglected state-owned site in Brooklyn that has sat in redevelopment limbo for decades is once again up for grabs.\nGov. Kathy Hochul issued a request for proposals on Thursday for 1024 Fulton Street, seeking a developer to take over the 12,800-square-foot Clinton Hill site. The request comes with conditions: The new owner must build apartments where all rents are at or below 100 percent of the area median income, and the new building must include at least 100 units. The RFP also calls for a community center on the building\u2019s ground floor.\nWhoever is selected to take over the site will pay a nominal fee. The state may still opt to create a ground lease on the site rather than handing over full ownership of the property.\nPlans to redevelop the site have been snarled up in attempts to transfer the property to a nonprofit.\nIn 2014, the Cuomo administration halted plans to auction the site at the urging of then-Assembly member Walter Mosley, who wanted to sell the property to the nonprofit Northeast Brooklyn Housing Development Corp.,\nthe New York Daily News reported at the time\n. When that plan fell apart, the state legislature\napproved a bill\nin 2020 to sell the property to Philadelphia-based TCH Holdings for \u201cfair market value.\u201d\nThat proposal also didn\u2019t come to fruition because TCH didn\u2019t file the required paperwork outlining its plan for a senior center on the site,\nThe City reported\n.\n\nThe latest RFP requires that the development team be 51 percent owned by a nonprofit, and it gives a slight edge to those wholly owned by a nonprofit (five points out of a maximum of 100 a bidder can earn based on criteria outlined by the state).\nThe state budget for fiscal year 2024-2025 allocated $3.7 million to demolish the 33,000-square-foot vacant building on the site. The building served as a showroom for Brooklyn Union Gas in 1912 and then for manufacturing and commercial uses.\nThe state\u2019s Office of Children and Family Services bought the property in 1997, hoping to develop a community center. However, \u201cdue to structural issues,\u201d the agency abandoned that plan, according to the RFP. The building has since sat vacant.\nThe site\u2019s current zoning allows residential space that is four times the size of the lot (or a floor area ratio of 4), with a maximum building height of 85 feet. If a building includes affordable housing, the FAR can go up to 5 and the height to 115 feet. The RFP notes that the state is willing to override local zoning to maximize the amount of affordable housing, and will consider additional density, height and other modifications if they \u201csupport a superior design and site plan while being cost-effective.\u201d\nThe RFP for the Fulton Street site is the latest effort by the Hochul administration to build on state-owned land. The\nstate budget last year\ncreated a capital fund to build more than 15,000 homes on state-owned properties.\n",

        "content": "Miami Beach commissioners approved land use changes that will allow the Meruelo family and David Martin\u2019s Terra to build a larger project on the oceanfront property that was previously home to the Deauville Beach Resort.\nThe commission on Wednesday evening voted six to 1, with commissioner David Suarez casting the sole \u2018no\u2019 vote, on first reading to approve two amendments that would apply to the 3.8-acre oceanfront property at 6701 Collins Avenue in North Beach. Mayor Steven Meiner and commissioners Tanya Bhatt, Laura Dominguez, Alex Fernandez, Joseph Magazine and Kristen Rosen Gonzalez voted in favor.\nMartin, CEO of Terra, has been leading the charge on behalf of the Meruelos, who have a 75 percent stake in the property. Martin was brought on in part due to his reputation as a developer who negotiates successfully with local governments, helping\nwith damage control\n.\nThe Meruelo family and Terra now plan a 120-unit condo and 150-room hotel project on the site, designed by Foster + Partners, Shulman + Associates and ODP as the project architect.\nThe\nDeauville\nproperty currently has a floor area ratio, or overall project size, of 3.0 to 3.15. The developer is seeking legislative changes that would allow for an FAR of 5.5, for a project that could span nearly 916,000 square feet. The project would include a partial reconstruction of the Deauville and a proposed height of 400 feet tall.\nThe changes will require a referral to the planning board and a second reading vote from the commission, likely next month.\nThe Meruelos were heavily criticized for letting the iconic Deauville fall into disrepair to the point where it required demolition. The family has also been tied up in litigation with the city.\nThose sentiments weren\u2019t on display for the majority of the discussion at Wednesday\u2019s commission meeting. Residents and city officials spoke overwhelmingly in favor of the redevelopment.\n\u201cI want to speak to you from my heart when I tell you that this project is brilliant, and Mr. Martin, the time he has spent listening, public hearings, answering questions, I think the humanity of it is also brilliant for such a big project,\u201d said Richard Zaki, a resident at the nearby Sterling condo building.\nElizabeth Latone, who is on the city\u2019s planning board, spoke as a member of the public, begging the commission to approve the project.\n\n\u201cHow much longer can we wait? At what point is something going to be good enough for this spot? Yes, we have terrible owners. Everybody knows that they are toxic, but we can\u2019t wait anymore,\u201d Latone said.\nCommissioner Bhatt agreed.\n\u201cI hate the fact that they\u2019re going to make money off of this,\u201d she said, referring to the Meruelos. Bhatt said the city was nearing a deal to have the owners pay off millions of dollars in fines they owe the city.\nDaniel Ciraldo, executive director of the Miami Design Preservation League, supported the project and praised its design, but urged the city to remember that the Meruelos own the majority interest and asked that they negotiate a lower height.\n\u201cWe need to make sure that we\u2019re clear that the owners are also the Meruelos, and they owe millions of dollars to the city of Miami Beach, and David Martin is a very good developer, but there\u2019s another owner that a lot of us know cannot always be trusted,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt is a double height of what was there,\u201d he added. \u201cBetween first and second [reading], I hope you guys can really negotiate the height, make it even better.\u201d\nThe Deauville, built in 1957, was about 185 feet tall and 17 stories.\nThis latest proposal follows billionaire developer Steve Ross\u2019 plan to secure an FAR of 4.5, which voters\nrejected via a referendum\nin 2022. Ross entered into a contract with the Meruelos to pay $500 million for the site, but the deal was contingent on voters approving the referendum.\nIn a statement, Martin said the development team is \u201ctaking the time to get it right.\u201d The project, he wrote, \u201cwill pay tribute to the legacy of the historic Deauville.\u201d He joined the project about a year ago when Terra\npaid $12.5 million\nfor a 25 percent stake in the property.\n",

They include Banner starting demolition at the site no later than June 24, with completion expected by early August.\nBuildings like the Egg Harbor Cafe on Hale Street may remain intact, contingent on tenant operations, despite surrounding structures being boarded up in preparation for demolition.\n\nThe project has garnered mixed reactions from the community and local leaders. Former council member Scott Brown praised the investment potential but acknowledged they\u2019ve faced market challenges as construction loans have become more difficult to secure for developers since interest rates took off in 2022.\nBanner Real Estate has already submitted demolition applications ahead of the April 24 deadline. Additionally, a substantial payment of $250,000 to acquire a public alley crucial for the project\u2019s footprint has been scheduled upon demolition permit issuance.\nThe suburban Chicago multifamily market is experiencing strong rental demand, with rents rising 4.4 percent year-over-year, outpacing the city core. Despite challenges from elevated interest rates, the suburbs have become attractive for investors due to tax stability and limited new supply, leading to a competitive market.\n\u2014 Sam Lounsberry\n",

        "content": "A South Side landlord is testing how buzzy Bronzeville has become by listing two apartment buildings for $225,000 per unit.\nRaphael Lowenstiein, who previously landed in financial hot water from racking up code violations on other South Side properties, is putting two apartment buildings at 4201 and 4750 South Michigan Avenue up for sale together or separately. If the combined 45 units sold at the target price of $10.1 million, the sale would be on par with recent multifamily sales in more established real estate markets in Chicago. The properties do not have outstanding code violations.\nAssets snagging between $200,000 and $300,000 in the past year include a 17-unit complex sold in Avondale, which sold for $235,000 per unit last May; a 47-unit complex in river West that\nsold for $302,000 per unit\nthe following month; and in the West Loop,\na 274-unit tower that sold for $278,000 per unit\nin October.\nBronzeville had been experiencing a dramatic decline in population until recently, much like other areas of the South Side.\nThe neighborhood was a hub for Black population growth during the Great Migration in the early to mid-1900s, but years of disinvestment led its population to decline by more than 75 percent between 1950 and 2000, according to United Way of Metro Chicago.\nGrowth in nearby Hyde Park and the expected 2026 completion of t\nhe Obama presidential library\nin Woodlawn has spurred an influx of interest recently, along with Farpoint Development\u2019s planned\n$3.2 billion megadevelopmen\nt known as Bronzeville Lakefront.\nOn the residential side, a single family home in\nWoodlawn set a record this month\n, selling for $1.2 million, which was $400,000 more than any previous home sold in the neighborhood.\n\u201cFrom the 7100 block up to Douglas, it\u2019s all improved significantly,\u201d said SVN\u2019s Joe Connelly, who is listing agent for Lowenstein\u2019s South Michigan Avenue properties. \u201cIn Woodlawn, I was working on a deal for $200,000 a door. That would have been absolutely unheard of even four years ago.\u201d\n\nA sale at or above $200,000 per unit is not a guarantee, even with the area\u2019s growth. A two-building Hyde Park portfolio at 5111 South University Avenue and 5135 South Blackstone Avenue totaling 77 studio and one-bedroom units sold this month for $103,000 per unit.\nBut the South Michigan Avenue properties also benefit from their proximity to Bronzeville Lakefront and from larger-than-typical floorplans because they were converted from condos and renovated, Connelly said.\n\u201cLocal investors think the price per door is a little steep for Bronzeville, but it reflects the rents that they\u2019re achieving,\u201d Connelly said.\nAverage rents are close to $2,000 per unit, and the average average unit size is about 1,315 square feet, Connelly said. Some duplex units have 2,400-square-foot floorplans, he said.\nIt hasn\u2019t been smooth sailing for the buildings\u2019 owners. Raphael Lowenstein, who leads property management firm 312 Properties with his brother Ari Lowenstein, have been accused of allowing other properties they run to rack up code violations and leave tenants living in poor conditions.\nThe code violations at properties at 4520 and 4830 South Drexel Boulevard and 4612-4626 South Lake Park Avenue\nnearly led the landlords to default\non $54 million worth of CMBS loans backing the properties but they later cleared the violations and\nsecured new financing\n.\nRaphael Lowenstein did not respond to requests for comment.\n",

        "content": "Miami architect Kobi Karp pulled off a double play, scoring a green light on designs for a pair of apartment projects near Edgewater\u00a0 and Wynwood Norte.\nOn Wednesday, the\nMiami Urban Development Review Board\napproved 1600 Edgewater, Sabet Group\u2019s 33-story tower with 282 apartments, as well as Evolve Companies\u2019 Evolve Wynwood 35, an eight-story building with 141 rental units.\nBoth projects are redevelopment plays by out-of-state builders that entered the Miami market in 2022. The review board approved 1600 Edgewater and Evolve Wynwood 35 unanimously, and suggested a few minor design tweaks for both projects.\n1600 Edgewater\nLos Angeles and New-York-based Sabet Group, led by Andre and Edward Sabetfard, is developing 1600 Edgewater. The firm planted its flag in South Florida three years ago when Sabet acquired the 0.5-acre site at 1600 Northeast Second Avenue for\n$14.3 million\n. The property is in Miami\u2019s\nArts &amp; Entertainment District\n, but borders\nEdgewater\n.\nThe property is currently home to a single-story commercial building leased to a go-kart amusement company. The site is zoned for a 25-story apartment building with a maximum of 250 units, but Sabet obtained city approval for a height and unit increase through public benefits bonuses by setting aside 20 apartments for affordable housing.\n\nKarp designed the building with an eight-floor parking podium with 352 parking spaces. The planned tower will also have 9,519 square feet of retail, including a rooftop restaurant, plans show.\nEvolve Wynwood 35\nIn 2022, Evolve Companies, led by Joe McKinney and Mike Winstead Jr. entered the Miami market by dropping\n$9.8 million\nfor six lots with small single-family houses and apartment buildings at 543, 553, 579, 583, 585 and 535-539 Northwest 35th Street in Wynwood Norte.\nThe Greensboro, North Carolina-based firm tapped Karp to design Evolve Wynwood 35, which will replace the older building and homes, which were completed between 1926 and 1951. Featuring a facade painted in various colors by different artists, Wynwood 35 will also include a parking garage on the first, second and third floors with 202 spaces.\nSince 2013, Evolve has focused on multifamily and student housing projects, as well as providing construction management services, according to the firm\u2019s website. The company has more than $1 billion in assets under management with a portfolio spanning 25 million square feet and 20,000 units.\nEvolve is also planning a second project, an 11-story building with 105 apartments, in\nWynwood Norte\n. In 2022, the firm also paid\n$9 million\nfor a 0.7-acre site at 475 Northwest 36th Street.",

        "content": "Jay Paul Company has a new plan for its CityView development in downtown San Jose, swapping out some office buildings for an office-to-resi conversion, a brand new residential tower and retail.\nThe new design redevelops San Jose\u2019s CityView Plaza, which the Silicon Valley developer bought the bulk of for $283.5 million in 2018, adding two adjacent properties a year later for $100 million. That same year, the firm also bought the 19-story 50 West San Fernando Street for $238 million, bringing its holdings to about $680 million in downtown San Jose.\nOriginally plans called for three 19-story, interconnected office towers containing 3.4 million square feet of offices, shops and restaurants. The company\nasked the city for a five-year pause\non that plan last year, citing \u201ccurrent financial markets and a reduced demand for office leasing.\u201d\nNow downtown San Jose\u2019s biggest office owner is moving forward, but with a new plan for a mixed-use community with a large residential component, plus office, retail and restaurants, according to a news release from the company.\nThe Village at CityView is a 320-unit conversion of an existing four-building office campus, as well as the current 2.35-acre plaza, designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz. Apartment units will range from studios to three-bedrooms, with shared green spaces, a 10,000-square-foot fitness and wellness center, and a rooftop pool, \u201call of which enhance downtown San Jose\u2019s appeal as a vibrant place to call home,\u201d the release indicates.\n\nPhase two of the project details a brand-new 27-story apartment luxury tower, called The Tower at CityView, at 121 South Market Street. Also designed by SCB, it will have 360 units, from studios to three-bedroom penthouses, with rooftop lounges and outdoor terraces showcasing city views, along with onsite, underground parking.\nFor the retail component, The Shops at CityView will bring 35,000 square feet of retail and restaurants designed by architect DES to a \u201cdowntown environment that currently lacks similar amenities,\u201d the release says. Set to be located at the intersection of Park Avenue and Almaden Boulevard, the retail hub will \u201ccomplement\u201d the existing 15,000 square feet of street level retail in Jay Paul Company\u2019s adjacent\n19-story 200 Park\n, which houses Adobe World Headquarters, and the Center for the Performing Arts.\nThere is still a substantial office component in CityView proper with the extensive renovation of 150 Almaden, a 15-story, 204,000-square-foot Class A office building that will be \u201cmodernized to meet the evolving needs of today\u2019s high-tech workforce,\u201d according to the release. The renovation will include an upgrade to the building systems, a new lobby and tenant amenities like a conference center and fitness center. Like 200 Park, it will have three parking spots for every 1,000 square feet, which the company said would allow it to \u201ccompete with the convenience of suburban projects while offering a dynamic and exciting location in the heart of downtown.\u201d\n\u201cPeople want to live, work and play in the safest big city in the Bay,\u201d San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan said in a statement, calling the project \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d for its ability to help the city \u201creimagine what the capital of Silicon Valley looks and feels like\nin the age of AI.\u201d\nPaul did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the overhauled plans but said in a statement that, \u201cDowntown is evolving into a powerhouse of innovation, culture and commerce, and we\u2019re excited to be part of\nthat.\u201d\n",

        "content": "One of the nation\u2019s biggest construction lenders has given Nick Marietti the fuel he needs to start construction on a suburban Chicago rental project.\nMarietti\u2019s Schaumburg-based firm VennPoint Real Estate closed on $55 million in financing, led by Bank OZK\u2019s nearly $46 million construction loan, for the 144-unit townhome project slated for Five Parkway North Boulevard in Deerfield, according to a news release.\nThe developer scored the remaining $9.9 million in funding from an undisclosed insurance company in the form of a mezzanine loan.\nThe deal underscores growing interest in suburban Chicago townhome developments. Chicago-based JDI Realty last year spent $34 million on buying up a portfolio of 164 townhomes throughout Chicago\u2019s surroundings that the seller had built up over 14 years.\nVennPoint purchased the approximately 10 acres targeted for construction for $10.2 million, from its previous owner, Deerfield-based Quadrangle, which spent a little more than $5.8 million to buy the land in 2015, public record show. The development site is adjacent to a multi-building corporate office complex that includes the 258,000-square-foot\nOne Parkway North\nbuilding, whose landlord Joseph Horn is in default on a $12.7 million loan.\n\nThe residential development is dubbed Park5 and will include two- and three-bedroom layouts averaging a little more than 1,900 square feet each, with two-car attached garages and private yards and outdoor space \u2014 rarities for traditional multifamily rentals.\nVennPoint\u2019s plan is to set aside 14 units as affordable to comply with Deerfield\u2019s housing regulations, it told public officials in October. Its original plan was to build 147 units, but it scaled that slightly back to 144. The financing pencils out to $382,000 per unit.\nJLL\u2019s Matthew Schoenfeldt and Mary Dooley represented VennPoint in its deal for the construction debt. JLL\u2019s Dan Reynolds and Chris Cummins advised the land seller Quadrangle.\nThe project is one of several rental developments coming to Deerfield. Wisconsin-based Continental Properties last year raked in a $54 million construction loan to pursue a 254-unit rental project, with 25 units designated as affordable, near Interstate 94 and South Waukegan Road. Separately, Chicago-based Celadon Partners is kicking off a $70 million plan to replace an office complex at 1101 Lake Cook Road with an affordable senior housing community.\n",

        "content": "For one glorious week last June, the city opened a rent-voucher portal that had been closed for 15 years.\nThrough the magic door rushed 600,000 New Yorkers applying for Section 8, which comes from the federal government and is distributed by the New York City Housing Authority. NYCHA gets the money from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and forwards it to landlords. But first, it has to award Housing Choice Vouchers to tenants.\nFrom those applicants, NYCHA selected 200,000 by lottery. Cue the politicians.\nMayor Eric Adams, in a\npress release\n, touted the \u201cmuch-needed relief to families searching for affordable housing.\u201d And then-Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer said it \u201cwill be a lifeline to 200,000 New Yorkers who need affordable housing.\u201d\nThese statements were a stretch, to say the least.\nNo, 200,000 New Yorkers did not get a lifeline. They got on a waiting list to get a lifeline.\nAnd the lifeline has no apartment on the other end of it. Tenants have\n180 days\nto find a unit eligible for the voucher and a willing landlord \u2014 not easy in a city with a\n1.4 percent vacancy rate\n.\nNow, the punchline: Nine months after the application window closed, NYCHA has worked its way through 12,000 applications and only 318 have succeeded. In a city with nearly 6 million renters, 318 is the statistical equivalent of zero.\nThe numbers are mind-boggling. Only 1 of every 45 tenants handed a voucher has rented an apartment with it. At its current pace, NYCHA will take nine more years to get through the 188,000 people on the waitlist. Last time it took 15 years.\nWhat are the lessons here? Besides not trusting quotes from politicians, that is.\n\nOne takeaway is that the ongoing battles over vouchers are a sideshow if the programs don\u2019t get people into apartments and money in landlords\u2019 pockets.\nThe City Council is fighting the Adams administration for more CityPHEPS vouchers, and New York City landlord and tenant groups are doing the same in Albany for state vouchers. More efficiency should be at least as high of a priority.\nThe New York Apartment Association has made this point often, but the process remains tedious, overly bureaucratic and often arbitrary. A tenant could beat the deadline, only to have an inspector reject the apartment for some picayune reason. Hello, homeless shelter.\nAn even more overlooked lesson is that the\nvacancy rate is too low\nfor vouchers to achieve their potential. City lawmakers have not done enough to increase the supply of multifamily housing, and state legislators have done virtually nothing.\nA final point: State law should be changed to allow the full value of vouchers to be used at rent-stabilized apartments. Right now, the \u201clegal rent\u201d is the maximum the landlord can receive, even if the voucher is worth more.\nThis means, for Section 8, New York is leaving federal money on the table, even as our politicians complain about Congress and the Trump administration cutting Medicaid and other funding (this\n$80 million\n, for example).\nTenants with Housing Choice Vouchers don\u2019t make much money. The income threshold for an individual is $54,350 a year and $69,900 for a family of three.\nLetting them use their vouchers in full would give them a huge advantage over non-voucher holders (who are typically wealthier) in securing rent-stabilized units, which are about half of all rental units in the city. For probably the only time in their lives, they could actually outbid rich people.\nThis would make rent stabilization more like an affordable housing program, boost revenue at buildings that desperately need it for operating expenses and repairs and steer higher earners into market-rate units, where they belong.\nSome groups purportedly advocating for tenants oppose any change to this rule. They don\u2019t want landlords to get more money. There is no obvious policy rationale except to force more buildings into foreclosure.\n",

        "content": "Disclaimer: This is a worst-case scenario.\nYou\u2019re a landlord, or a co-op or condo board, and you install UL-rated gas detectors above your building\u2019s gas stoves and dryers by May 1, as required by\nLocal Law 157\n.\nBefore long, one starts beeping. A tenant calls 911 and, fearing an explosion, hangs up and leaves the apartment. The dispatcher can see the address but doesn\u2019t know in which unit the alarm sounded. She sends the Fire Department to investigate the potential gas leak.\nThe FDNY arrives, but cannot figure out where the alarm came from. The tenant who called is unreachable. Twenty minutes pass. Because gas might be building up in a unit, creating the potential for an explosion, the FDNY shuts off gas to the entire building.\nThe tenant finally returns and lets firefighters into her unit. They open the windows, turn the stove knobs to the off position and tell the tenant to come back in an hour. Everything\u2019s back to normal, right?\nWrong. Your building must pass a pressure test for gas service to be turned back on. On the first try, it fails. So you have plumbers pull every gas stove and dryer out from the wall, cap all the pipes, and run a second pressure test. Another fail.\nThe building is old, and the pipes have shifted or corroded over time. Somewhere, probably in several places, there are leaks. But where? No one knows.\nYou\u2019re faced with two unpalatable options: re-pipe the entire building or re-wire it and go electric, like\nthis Yonkers complex is doing\n. Either way, the cost is well into the six figures for a small building, and millions for a larger one.\nFor a co-op, that can mean refinancing your mortgage and raising your dues. For a rent-stabilized building, there\u2019s no way to recover the cost, because the state strangled the Major Capital Improvements program in 2019.\n\nWhatever solution you choose will take months, if not longer. Meanwhile, everyone is using hot plates, ordering in or demanding to be relocated.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nSource-of-income discrimination was the most common source of housing discrimination complaints to the city\u2019s Human Rights Commission last fiscal year, with\n554\n. But is the problem still \u201cpervasive,\u201d as City Limits claimed in\nthis story\nabout new City Council bills targeting the crime? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Sublet specialist\nRuth Colp-Haber\nof Wharton Property Advisors has a block on the computer of her colleague/husband Eric to make sure he is not distracted by NCAA basketball during work hours.\nElsewhere\u2026\nThe Atlantic Avenue rezoning \u2014 dubbed AAMUP \u2014 was approved by the City Planning Commission, which was a formality because it is an Adams administration initiative and the mayor appoints most of the commissioners.\nBut it\u2019s a good opportunity to debate the issues that have plagued the city\u2019s housing market, particularly the notion that rezoning for \u201cluxury\u201d (actually mixed-income) development makes the problem worse.\nThe Atlantic\u2019s\nJacob Anbinder\nhas spent years trying to debunk the myth that \u201cnew luxury housing is the reason that former working- and middle-class neighborhoods in their cities have become fancy enclaves.\u201d\n\u201cNot only is it a simplistic analysis that absolves nearly anyone who isn\u2019t a developer of responsibility for the problem,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut in portraying new housing as the proximate cause of gentrification, it exacerbates the very housing crisis it seeks to solve.\u201d\nClosing time\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "Developers Jeff Shapack and Shawn Clark are a step closer to starting construction on a massive Fulton Market mixed-use project by closing in on a luxury hotel operator.\nGlobal Ambassador, an upstart five-star hotel brand with a 141-room Phoenix location, is nearing a deal to run the lodging component of Shapack Partners\u2019 and CRG\u2019s planned development at 170 North Green Street, according to people familiar with the deal.\nThe hotel could take space within a 40-story mixed-use building approved by the city for the site. The plans also include office, retail and apartments, but the developers may still end up further emphasizing one use while scaling back others as they and competitors with shovel-ready sites in Fulton Market vie for corporate tenants.\nA Global Ambassador arrangement isn\u2019t closed, but if kept on track, it would add another high-end hotel option to Chicago\u2019s hottest neighborhood for commercial real estate, which already includes a Nobu hotel as well as Soho House and the Hoxton.\nIts ultimate outcome will be determined in large part by the office market, which across the nation has become increasingly concentrated in high-end new buildings within transforming neighborhoods, such as Fulton Market.\nMeanwhile, the Shapack-CRG venture behind the 170 North Green plan is eagerly awaiting decisions by potential office tenants scouting development sites in the area, according to market sources. As are Sterling Bay and Related Midwest, which respectively have city-approved office tower plans at\n330 North Green Street\nand 725 West Randolph Street.\nThe logjam in the development market could be unlocked with a move to anchor one of those potential towers by a handful of firms in the financial, legal and consulting sectors considering Fulton Market office space, although commercial real estate decision-making has slowed this year as economic uncertainty ballooned, leasing brokers have said.\nThe Global Ambassador deal could also be put on hold should a major office deal take shape for 170 North Green that would require non-workspace uses to be whittled down, the sources said. It could also be accelerated, should an office user sign on for some of the space within the building allotted to office by the plans, thus adding more momentum to the development team\u2019s search for financing. Some office tenants may prefer a building with an on-site hotel.\n\nThe 170 North Green site and Related Midwest\u2019s on Randolph Street previously made shifts away from hospitality in plans submitted to the city. Related in 2023 pivoted\n725 West Randolph\nfrom a mixed-use hotel-and-apartments project into office to compete for potentially lucrative tenants seeking upscale workspace in buzzy Fulton Market.\nSince developers received city approval in 2022 to build at 170 North Green, it has proven tricky to fund as construction loans got tougher to nail down when interest rates elevated. In 2023 they received city permission to remove the hotel element and replace it with an additional 65,000 square feet of office space, public records show. Now, they\u2019re again leaning into including lodging; they\u2019re approved for 150 hotel rooms in the property.\nThey also turned the vacant 62,000-square-foot lot \u2014 which previously contained the Bridgford Foods building that they\nbought for $60 million\nand later demolished \u2014 into pickleball courts while waiting to start construction on the permanent development.\nThe building is also approved to include 275 apartments, with 20 percent of them set aside for households making 60 percent or less of the area median income, as well as 350,000 square feet of office space, in addition to some retail. It\u2019s unclear whether a deal for the Global Ambassador, if finalized, would reduce the amount of space within the building planned for offices and apartments.\nShapack and CRG didn\u2019t return requests for comment, and neither did the Global Ambassador.\nSecuring the hospitality business could add some allure in their search for a construction lender. It\u2019s unclear if the project will also require an anchor office tenant to sign onto a lease in order to gain funding. The site is encumbered by a $31.3 million mortgage from Missouri-based Citizens Bank that was taken out by the developers to fund their purchase of the site in 2022. The developers\u2019 goal is to replace that debt with a construction loan.\nGlobal Ambassador was started by restaurateur Sam Fox, who opened his first property in Phoenix in late 2023 to critical acclaim, after about a decade of plotting and building the development. If its potential Chicago location is anywhere close to similar, expect it to be swanky: the Phoenix property contains five restaurants, a spa that offers cryotherapy and room rates for an early June stay start at just under $500 a night before taxes, with the 2,000-square-foot presidential suite available for about $3,400, the property\u2019s website said.\nShould CRG and Shapack Partners start construction at 170 North Green, it would be the second major Fulton Market project they\u2019ve kicked off in recent memory, after another joint venture of the firms landed an\n$84 million construction loan\nfor a 29-story, 308-unit apartment building at 220 North Ada Street last year. That project\u2019s total reported cost is $140 million.\n",

        "content": "The City of San Jose dished out sweeteners to attract developers for housing, and Hanover Company took the bait.\nThe city waived $4.9 million fees and taxes for the Houston-based developer to build a 345-unit apartment complex at 905 North Capitol Avenue, in north San Jose,\nthe San Jose Mercury News reported\n.\nWithout the waiver of in-lieu fees and 50 percent reduction of construction taxes\napproved by the city last year\n, the seven-story project would have never gotten off the ground, officials say.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great thing all around, but I think it comes with the recognition that we have to be able to right size our fees and processes and regulations and figure out how to be flexible and meet the market and allow that investment to flow,\u201d San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan told the newspaper.\nPlans by Hanover include 345 apartments, of which 328 units would be market-rate and 17 affordable for moderate-income households on a 2.1-acre site near the Penitencia Creek Light Rail Station. The building will contain 3,000 square feet of offices.\nScott Youdall, a regional development partner at Hanover, credited the city\u2019s program with helping move the project along after it was approved three years ago.\n\u201cWhen this project was originally entitled and approved, in the face of rising interest rates, we had not been able to get this project capitalized and started, but with the help of this incentive, we have been able to put the capitalization in place,\u201d Youdall told the Mercury News.\nRising interest rates and higher labor and material costs have curtailed office and market-rate projects over the past few years, leading San Jose to dangle more incentives.\n\nMarket conditions have especially hindered multifamily development.\nAfter averaging one new multifamily development per year, the city didn\u2019t see a single apartment project of more than 20 units break ground last year.\nTo help spur housing development, the city approved the new multifamily incentive program in December.\nThe initiative reduces park fees and a 50 percent cut in construction taxes for the first 1,500 units for projects in certain growth areas that applied by June 2022 and received building permits until the end of this year. A city analysis found that 35 projects qualified for incentives.\nHanover, founded by Murray Bowden in 1982, has developed multifamily residential and industrial properties in 12 states, including more than 56,000 apartments and $12 billion in project capitalization, according to its website.\nLast month, Hanover landed a\n$120.4 million construction financing\nto build 1,140 apartments\natop a historic persimmon orchard\nin north San Jose. It\u2019s not clear if the city incentives applied to plans to redevelop the Tsukuda Fruit Stand and orchard at 2620 Seely Avenue.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s no secret among San Francisco developers that landing a building permit can take years \u2014 making it the slowest city in the state to build anything.\nSupervisor Bilal Mahmood, who recently replaced antidevelopment Supervisor Dean Preston, has now called for a city investigation into what\u2019s taking so long to hand out permits,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nMahmood planned to ask the supervisors\u2019 budget and legislative analyst this week to study the permitting process in five other cities across the state and compare them to San Francisco.\nThe study would look into the number and types of permits required by other major cities and counties that allow everything from small businesses and single-family homes to large housing projects to be built more quickly.\nIt would also analyze every step in San Francisco\u2019s permitting gauntlet, and the time it takes its various departments to spit out the permits. A timeline for the proposed study was not disclosed.\n\u201cThere are over 1,000 pages of San Francisco building code that have resulted in us being the slowest city to build in the entire state,\u201d Mahmood told the Chronicle. \u201cThere are other cities in the Bay Area and across California that are building faster than us with the same interest rates, the same labor conditions, the same costs.\u201d\nSan Francisco must permit 82,000 homes by 2031, more than half of them affordable, according to the state-mandated housing plan. The city is now rezoning much of the city to meet the goal.\n\nMahmood\u2019s request for a new study aims to support the goals of PermitSF, an initiative by Planning Director Rich Hillis and Mayor Daniel Lurie to reform the city\u2019s housing and small business permitting process.\n\u201cThis effort to learn from other cities who are building faster than us is consistent with the goals of PermitSF to deliver bold, transformative permitting solutions to accelerate the construction of much-needed housing in San Francisco,\u201d Hillis told the Chronicle.\nIt\u2019s not clear why it has taken San Francisco so long to evaluate its\nglacial permitting process\n.\nIn 2023, the city greenlit the building of 1,136 homes, a 13-year-low, according to figures from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. That compares to an average of 2,476 permits a year since 2001, with a peak 5,200 permits doled out in 2018, according to the San Francisco Business Times.\nA year earlier,\nThe Real Deal reported\nit took nearly 1,000 days on average -\u2013 450 days for entitlements and another 525 days for permitting \u2013\u2013 to get cleared to start a residential project in San Francisco, according to the state Department of Housing and Community Development.\nA\nSan Francisco Chronicle analysis\nfound it took the city an average 627 days to permit an apartment project, and 861 days to permit a single-family home.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Gary Barnett\u2019s luxury project at 655 Madison Avenue is a ways away from reality, but he may have already found a retail tenant willing to pay big bucks to secure its space.\nLuxury fashion brand Chanel is in discussions to purchase the retail space at the Midtown Manhattan development, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. Chanel may pay in the mid-$400 millions for the 65,000 square feet at the corner of East 60th Street and Madison Avenue.\nThe deal, which has not been finalized, would give the brand space on the ground floor, as well as below street level and on higher floors. The blended price of a $450 million deal would break down to $7,000 per square foot.\nOutside of the large price tag, Extell Development could also benefit from the presence of Chanel as a means to help secure financing for the project.\nInsite Luxury Consulting\u2019s Paul Muratore is representing Chanel in the discussions.\n\nThe fashion brand previously negotiated for space across the street at 660 Madison Avenue, where it was willing to pay around $600 million. Those talks collapsed over a brokerage fee dispute. Chanel\u2019s presence in Midtown also includes a watch boutique at 730 Fifth Avenue and a fashion store at 15 East 57th Street.\nShould Chanel ultimately purchase the retail space, it would join a growing list of luxury retailers keen to own their own spaces in Manhattan.\nLast year, Kering \u2014 the French luxury group that owns Gucci, Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen \u2014 purchased the retail portion of 715-717 Fifth Avenue from Jeff Sutton and SL Green\nfor $963 million\n. Before that, Italy-based fashion brand Prada agreed to purchase 724 Fifth Avenue\nfor $425 million\n, also from Sutton.\nBarnett is\nplanning\na 193,000-square-foot building at 655 Madison Avenue that will include 62 residential units. Extell purchased the property in October for\nnearly $160 million\nfrom Williams Equities.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A Houston-based developer delivered a condo highrise, London House, with nearly all of its units already sold, proving that luxury can go vertical in sprawling Texas metros.\nRandall Davis Company\u2019s 12-story building at 2323 San Felipe Drive in River Oaks took two years to construct, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe 70,000-square-foot development has 23 units, including four penthouses. Prices range from $1.5 million to $3.8 million. Only two units are still available, according to company founder Randall Davis, who developed the project alongside his daughter, Natalie Davis.\nAll of the units have gas fireplaces, high-end appliances and cabinetry, 11- to 13-foot ceilings and customizable stone, porcelain and wood finishes. The building also includes a concierge-staffed lobby, resident lounge, dog run and pet-washing station. A four-story garage offers space for rent.\nA few luxury condo developers are catering to\ngrowing demand\nfor high-rise living across the Texas Triangle, where sprawl means luxury buyers have historically looked for luxury real estate with land.\n\nDavis is targeting buyers who are drawn to small buildings with top-notch amenities, he said.\nHis next project, The Chaucer, is also 12 stories, set to start construction soon at 2360 Rice Boulevard near Rice Village. The art deco-inspired development will have 29 units and span 75,000 square feet, with a third of units already pre-sold. The Chaucer will feature a brass-accented fa\u00e7ade, concierge-staffed lobby, dog park and storage.\nThe highest tier of the luxury market in Houston has shown resilience, with home sales over $10 million surging by 75 percent to seven million homes in 2023. Affluent neighborhoods like River Oaks and Memorial lead the market for most-expensive home sales. However, the overall luxury segment has faced challenges, with fewer high-end listings compared to previous years, and competition from Dallas, which outpaces other Texas metros at the highest pricing tier.\nOther luxury condos under construction in Houston include the St. Regis Residences, a 35-story development set to begin construction next year in the Upper Kirby district. The Ritz-Carlton Residences in the Woodlands will offer 111 units designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

        "content": "BH Group and Prime Group can charge ahead with plans for a Homewood Suites By Hilton hotel near Gulfstream Park, as South Florida\u2019s hospitality sector expects growing demand this year.\nOn Wednesday, the\nHallandale Beach\nCity Commission by a unanimous 7-0 vote approved a site plan for the joint venture\u2019s\n15-story project\nwith 246 rooms and 281 parking spaces at 804 South Federal Highway. The partnership can now move on to the permitting and groundbreaking phases.\nAventura-based\nBH\nis led by Isaac and Liat Toledano, and Hollywood-based Prime is led by Larry Abbo. Designed by Hollywood-based Prime Design Associates, the hotel would also have a ground-floor cafe, restaurant and an enclosed public plaza.\n\nThe city commission also approved a mechanical parking lift for 40 valet spaces and agreed to increase the height of the building by one story because the development site is capped at 14 stories.\nIn the tri-county region, hotel landlords can expect a rise in room rates and revenue in the coming months, according to a recent CBRE report. In Broward County, the average revenue per room is expected to grow by 2.4 percent, and the average daily rate is projected to increase by 1.4 percent in 2025, the report states.\nBut only a few projects, including the BH and Prime Hilton-branded hotel, are slated for construction this year, CBRE found. High financing and construction costs are limiting new hotel development. Potential additional tariffs, labor shortages or the Fed pulling back on further interest rate reductions could further slow hospitality construction.\nBH and Prime paid $6.5 million for the 0.8-acre vacant property in May. The joint venture abandoned a previous site plan to develop a\n14-story building\nwith 138 condo-hotel units, 60 hotel rooms and 4,000 square feet of retail space.\u00a0The hotel development site is near the\nSeville Mobile Home Park\nthat\u2019s been targeted for redevelopment. Property owner Seville General Partners, led by Paul Rosen, is seeking city approval to rezone the 7-acre property at 426 Northeast Fifth Street and 515 North Federal Highway to allow six mid-rise buildings offering a mix of retail and offices.",

An officer had allegedly gotten out of his vehicle to try to de-escalate the situation with Conover but was instead struck by the car and thrown 40 feet.\nThe officer, Cameron Emmett, was taken to the hospital for a leg injury and has since been released.\nConover denied the allegations at his arraignment and accused officers of lying about the incident.\n\u201cI have everything right here, and it\u2019s all falsified,\u201d Conover said. \u201cIf anyone dares try to test my mental competence, I will eviscerate every single person with my intelligence right now.\u201d\n\nConover runs a YouTube channel with nearly 3 million subscribers, which showcases ultra-luxury listings across New York City, Aspen and Miami, among others.\nConover, who launched his internet fame as a travel vlogger,\nventured into real estate\nafter collaborating on a listing video with Ryan Serhant in 2018. After obtaining his real estate license two years later, he joined Nest Seekers and was handed $100 million in listings from the firm\u2019s CEO, Eddie Shapiro.\nConover appears to be no longer licensed with Nest Seekers. His page has been removed from the company\u2019s website, and the New York Department of State doesn\u2019t have a record of his license.\nThe judge ordered Conover remain in jail until at least his probable cause hearing, which is slated for this week. Police also said Conover was arrested the Wednesday prior to the incident on a drunk driving charge, though Conover claimed he\u2019s been sober for roughly four years.\n\u2014 Sheridan Wall\n",

The four cases pertain to loans with an aggregate original principal stretching beyond $600 million.\nThe action is connected to more than half of Pinnacle\u2019s multifamily portfolio in New York City, roughly 5,200 units of the 8,700-unit portfolio. Two dozen Manhattan properties are linked to the litigation, as well as approximately 75 properties in the outer boroughs. The largest of the loans covers a 142-unit building at 25 Hillside Avenue in Manhattan\u2019s Washington Heights.\nAt this stage, the action only involves summonses, not complaints, which is an oddity for commercial foreclosure cases in the state. It\u2019s unclear why Flagstar did not file complaints in its action.\nPinnacle could not be reached for comment by\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\nEarlier this year, Flagstar \u2014 the rebranded New York Community Bank \u2014\noffloaded\n$142 million in rent-stabilized debt to Cantor Fitzgerald. The loans were backed by 27 assets, which were 86 percent rent-stabilized on a weighted average, according to an analysis by\nThe Real Deal\n. The portfolio featured both performing and non-performing loans from borrowers, including Steve Croman, Alma Realty, Fairstead and none other than Pinnacle Group.\nPinnacle\u2019s portfolio spans approximately 136 properties totaling about 7.5 million square feet, according to PincusCo data, which estimates the holdings are worth about $1.6 billion.\nIn 2022, the billionaire Wiener was penalized after he admitted to not properly acknowledging needed capital repairs at a Forest Hills condo conversion. Under a\nsettlement\n, Wiener paid $330,000 to the reserve fund of The Georgian at 109-20 Queens Boulevard, which covered the cost of the needed piping, as well as $150,000 to the HPD.\nWiener reached\nbillionaire status in 2017\n, despite once being a target of tenant complaints and fraud investigations.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A lender is allegedly refusing to take back the keys of a rent-regulated building in Harlem, showing how low that corner of New York\u2019s multifamily sector has sunk.\nL+M Development Partners is suing Santander Bank for declining the deed in lieu of foreclosure at 320 St. Nicholas Avenue, Bisnow\nreported\n. The landlord filed the complaint in New York County Supreme Court last week.\nThe complaint was first reported by\nPincusCo\n. Both companies declined to comment to Bisnow on the legal dispute.\nLisa Gomez\u2019s L+M argues that the loan documents for the building give it the right to walk away from the property.\nLegislation directly impacted the property and its future.\nThe loan dates back to 2019 when Signature Bank originated $12 million to finance the conversion of four rent-regulated units into 12 apartments. But in 2023, New York amended the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, removing landlords\u2019 ability to\ngenerate new first rent\non reconfigured apartments.\nThe owner stopped work on the property after the amendments were passed, L+M claims, and began warehousing the apartments \u2014 removing them from the market \u2014 arguing its renovations were no longer legal.\n\nSantander entered the picture in 2023 when it\nbought a 20 percent stake\nin the failed Signature\u2019s loan book, which was backed by both rent-stabilized and rent-controlled properties. The FDIC chose Santander to manage the debt, yet it doesn\u2019t appear to be working with its borrower.\nIn June, it informed L+M of the default in Harlem and demanded payment. Three months later, L+M offered to turn over the property\u2019s deed.\nSantander told L+M that the loan documents don\u2019t require the bank to accept in deed-in-lieu, according to the complaint. L+M argued the process was implicit in the loan.\nIn January, Santander sent a default notice to L+M claiming the loan is recourse to the borrower; mortgage agreement documents appear to show the opposite. There is a \u201cbad boy guarantee,\u201d which states the bank can go after other assets under specific conditions, including fraud, misconduct, abandonment and physical waste.\nThat appears to be exactly what Santander is trying to do, likely hoping to collect assets that are worth more than the relatively small 320 St. Nicholas.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The total was down from\n26 in the previous period\nand\nchilled from a busy period\nthat kicked off March for the market.\nThe priciest contract last week went to 17 Willow Place in Brooklyn Heights, asking $10 million, or $2,173 per square foot.\nThe 4,600-square-foot home was designed by Robert Kahn and completed in 2012 with east-west exposures that include a two-story window that looks out onto a private garden. The 25-foot-wide home has four bedrooms and three bathrooms.\nOnly the facade and sidewalls remain from the 19th-century stable that used to occupy the 100-foot lot, and a curved staircase connects the three floors. The double-height living room has a wood-burning fireplace, while the primary bedroom has a gas fireplace.\nBrown Harris Stevens\u2019 Joan Goldberg had the listing.\n\nThe second most expensive contract last week went to 218 North Fifth Street in Williamsburg, which asked $7.25 million or $1,588 per square foot. It was originally listed for almost $8 million last June before landing at its current asking price in August.\nSpanning over 4,500 square feet, it is the largest home ever sold in North Williamsburg, according to Compass Todd Lewin, who along with Michael Rubin of the Lewis and Rubin Team, had the listing.\nThe newly built corner-lot home was completed in 2013 by the current owners and put on the market for the first time last summer.\nThe four-bedroom, three-bathroom home has space for four cars across two garages, four bedrooms and four outdoor spaces totaling 1,530 square feet. It also features a wood-burning fireplace, and polished concrete and white oak flooring.\nThe total contract volume last week was almost $70 million, with a median asking price of $3.1 million and an average price per square foot of $1,640. During the same week last year, the total contract volume was $56.5 million with a median asking price of $2.75 million and an average price per square foot of $1,366.\n",

        "content": "In this contentious time, let us all come together in our hatred of sidewalk sheds.\nThe general consensus, for years, has been that sidewalk sheds are ugly, stick around for too long and, in the worst cases, can themselves be unsafe.\nThe City Council on Wednesday is expected to vote on a\npackage of bills\naimed at reducing the miles of sidewalk sheds (and the scaffolding above them) that crowd NYC streets. Last year, the Council held a hearing on more than a dozen shed-related bills. The package being voted on this week includes five measures.\nHere is a rundown of the bills coming up for a vote:\n\u2014\u00a0One of the\nmeasures\ndecreases the length of a shed permit issued for fa\u00e7ade repairs, from one year to three months. It also creates penalties that kick in when an owner renews a permit for the second time but work on the fa\u00e7ade is not progressing. The latest version of this bill seems to address a concern raised by the Real Estate Board of New York, which requested that owners be given the opportunity to show what is going on with their site. Owners must submit a report to the Department of Buildings explaining why work has stalled (be it a financial reason, inability to access a neighboring property, etc.) to avoid penalties.\n\u2014 Another\nbill\nbumps the first required fa\u00e7ade inspection for newly-constructed buildings from five years post-completion to eight. It also requires the DOB to complete a study and come up with recommendations to change the city\u2019s Fa\u00e7ade Inspection &amp; Safety Program, or FISP. Specifically, the measure calls on the DOB to increase the time between fa\u00e7ade inspections from five years to sometime between six and 12 years. DOB must provide a recommendation by the end of the year, and the changes would go into effect on October 1, 2026. (Last year, DOB Commissioner James Oddo indicated that his agency had already hired a firm to study FISP and make recommendations).\n\u2014 Hunter green is so 2013. One of the bills requires the DOB to study and recommend new sidewalk shed designs by Sept. 30. The bill also expands the permitted color palette for sheds, adding metallic gray, white or \u201ca color matching the fa\u00e7ade, trim, cornice, or roof of the building.\u201d\n\u2014Those three bills are sponsored by Council member Keith Powers. Another bill, sponsored by Erik Bottcher, would ramp up penalties for fa\u00e7ade work that is not completed in a timely manner. For example, owners who fail to file a permit application for fa\u00e7ade work within eight months of receiving a shed permit will face penalties between $5,000 and $20,000. The latest version of the bill allows owners to plead their case to the DOB to explain why they need more time to complete repairs. A second bill sponsored by Bottcher requires more lighting under sidewalk sheds.\nSome of these bills overlap with ongoing efforts by the Adams administration, which launched the \u201cGet Sheds Down\u201d initiative in 2023. Last year, the mayor announced that the initiative had resulted in the removal of 173 miles of sidewalk sheds in the city. The administration also tapped two firms, ARUP and PAU, to come up with six new designs for the sheds.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: The\nstate budget\nis due in one week. What policies are you hoping will make it into the budget? Which ones are you dreading? Is there something you think deserves more attention? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nThe New York Housing Conference\nestimates\nthat the city will build 15,750 fewer housing units over the next 10 years, compared to average production in recent years. The group is basing its analysis on the Preliminary Ten-Year Capital Plan, which shows capital funding for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development go from $3.6 billion this fiscal year, to $3.3 million next year and down to $2 billion or less each year between fiscal years 2027 and 2035. The group warns that such drops in funding will mean that the $2 billion in state and city funding dedicated to City of Yes for Housing Opportunity will \u201cplug budget holes rather than support additional needs.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 ICYMI: Mayor Eric Adams tapped Randy Mastro to be his new First Deputy Mayor, replacing Maria Torres-Springer,\nthe New York Times reports\n. Back in July, the mayor nominated Mastro to be corporation counsel, but Mastro withdrew his name from consideration when it became clear that the City Council would not approve his appointment.\n\u2014 In February, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that she was going to increase oversight of Mayor Eric Adams, but those efforts have stalled out,\nPolitico New York reports\n. The City Council would need to approve the governor\u2019s plan before it heads to the state legislature. \u201cWe had a preliminary conversation a few weeks ago and there were a lot of questions and concerns raised by Council members that I think will need to be worked through before we have a package that is ready for prime time,\u201d said Brooklyn Democrat Lincoln Restler, who chairs the Committee on Governmental Operations, told Politico.\n\u2014 Assembly member Zohran Mamdani doesn\u2019t want your money. That\u2019s because he raised more than $8 million, hitting the fundraising cap for his run for mayor,\nGothamist reports\n.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Monday was\n$14.7 million\nfor a condo unit at 151 East 58th Street in Midtown East. The One Beacon Court unit is 4,500 square feet and last sold on the market in 2005 for $13.2 million.\nSerhant\u2019s\nAlen Moshkovich had the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$10.8 million\nfor\n151 Avenue A in the East Village. The rental building is 9,600 square feet, five stories and has eight units.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $17 million for a co-op unit at 1020 Fifth Avenue. The Upper East Side co-op has four beds and four bathrooms and was listed by Compass\u2019s Eric Brown and Zeve Salman of the\nElevated Team\n.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

That\u2019s evident by the relatively low vacancy rate on the stretch above Grand Central Terminal, despite high asking rents in the area.\nThe vacancy rate on Park Avenue is down to 8.9 percent, according to CoStar, representing a seven-year low for the avenue. That\u2019s practically half the vacancy rate of Manhattan as a whole, which stands at 16.1 percent.\nJust a few boulevards away, however, landlords are offering discounts of 75 percent compared to the going rates of Park Avenue, and yet are still struggling to fill spaces.\nCompanies are willing to shell out big bucks on Park Avenue. Tenants such as law firms, real estate companies, insurers and money managers continue to flock to Park Avenue.\n\nBeyond being associated with Manhattan prestige, Park Avenue\u2019s attractiveness surged upon the completion of the Long Island Rail Road extension to Grand Central, making it even easier for Long Island commuters to get to 42nd Street and above.\nAdditionally, Park Avenue is attracting businesses that jumped to Hudson Yards in recent years. At least three tenants have moved from Hudson Yards to Park Avenue since the pandemic, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield.\nThere are more office developments on the way. JPMorgan Chase\nplans to open\nits $3 billion office at 270 Park Avenue this summer. RXR and TF Cornerstone are\nseeking financing\nfor 175 Park Avenue, which is expected to be the tallest commercial building in the Western Hemisphere upon completion.\nAnd last week, the 1.8-million-square-foot project at 350 Park Avenue, spearheaded by Vornado Realty Trust and Ken Griffin, became the\nfirst office tower presented\nto the City Planning Commission in five years.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The apartment features a private foyer, eat-in kitchen and a sprawling primary suite.\nExtell Marketing Group and a team from Corcoran Sunshine \u2013 led by Kane Manera, Janet Wang, Tim Rizzo and Gabriele Tonini \u2014 are heading sales at the Billionaires\u2019 Row tower.\nThe skyscraper, marketed as the tallest residential building in the world, has seen several of its units close for significant discounts compared to its initial offering plan. But the property has still logged a number of hefty sales, including a\n$115 million\ndeal last summer for a duplex penthouse.\nSince sales launched in 2022, 72 of the tower\u2019s 180 units have sold for an average of $4,600 per square foot.\nThe Central Park Tower apartment was one of 31 properties in the borough asking $4 million or more to land inked deals, down from 36 in the\nprevious period\n. Twenty-five of those homes were condos, four were co-ops and two were townhouses.\n\nAbout half of the condos were sponsor units, with last asking prices discounted an average of 20 percent from the originals and were on the market for almost five years.\nThe second most expensive home to enter contract was the 46th floor at 111 West 57th Street, with an asking price of $23.8 million. The apartment spans 4,500 square feet and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms.\nThe condo, which last traded for close to $27 million, hit the market in September for $24.5 million. It features a great room with 14-foot ceilings and views of Central Park.\nCompass\u2019 Jim St. Andre, Trevor Stephens and Michael Maniawski had the listing.\nAmenities in the building, developed by JDS Development, Property Markets Group and Apollo, include a fitness center, lap pool and private dining room.\nThe homes\u2019 combined asking price was $267 million, for an average price of $8.6 million and a median of $6 million. The typical home spent more than 970 days on the market and was discounted 15 percent from the original listing price.\nThe priciest homes to hit the market last week were a five-bedroom penthouse at 832 Park Avenue, asking just under $30 million, and Unit 66B at 432 Park Avenue, asking $29.5 million, according to the Eklund-Gomes team\u2019s weekly report.\n",

        "content": "A closer look at a rent-control drama in Washington Heights reveals the landlord is not shaking down a little old lady to \u201cmaximize profits\u201d but struggling to reduce losses and stave off foreclosure.\nThe legal battle between 78-year-old tenant Freda Henderson and landlord Westside Ventura II LLC, which property records indicate is controlled by Joseph Sbiroli, was written up by\nGothamist\nas a tale of good versus evil.\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s\nfollow-up\npresented a more complex view of the situation. It turns out there\u2019s even more to the story.\nHenderson\u2019s lawyer\u2019s claim that the landlord is seeking to \u201cmaximize profits\u201d by evicting her reflects the common assumption that landlords always make a profit \u2014 the only question being how big. But at rent-regulated buildings, owners are increasingly trying to minimize losses and keep lenders from forcing a sale.\nThat appears to be the case at 547 West 157th Street, where Henderson is claiming succession rights to a $640-a-month, rent-controlled lease held by her boyfriend, who died at least a decade ago. If she loses, the unit would become rent-stabilized and could fetch more than $2,000 a month.\nBut that wouldn\u2019t come close to salvaging the building\u2019s finances.\nAll 42 units in the building are rent-regulated,\ncity records show\n. It was\npurchased for $14.65 million\nin 2016, three years before a\nnew state law\ndevalued\nrent-regulated buildings. The price \u2014 a huge win for seller\nLazer Sternhell\n\u2014 worked out to $349,000 per unit.\n\nIn 2023, total rent revenue was $931,000, according to records from its tax assessment challenge. That\u2019s $1,850 per unit, per month. Operating costs were $687,000 and property taxes were $145,000. Subtract those expenses from revenue, and you get $98,000.\nThat\u2019s a tiny number for a 42-unit building, and it\u2019s not even profit. To find that, we must subtract interest payments on the\n$6 million mortgage\nfrom Chase Bank \u2014 about $275,000, based on rates when the loan was issued in May 2020.\nSo the building lost about $177,000 for the year. The owner spent $169,000 on repairs and maintenance, and records show a substantial reduction in\nbuilding violations\n. But with lead paint and other issues still to be addressed, it\u2019s hard to imagine the cost of maintaining this old building will go down in years to come. And interest rates have gone up several points.\nWhat is the path forward for a rent-stabilized building like 547 West 157th Street?\nBased on the net operating income and a 5 percent cap rate, one source put the property\u2019s value at roughly $2 million. In that case, refinancing the $6 million mortgage, which likely comes due in the next year or two, would require the owner to kick in $4 million.\nIt\u2019s hard to see how that would make sense for an asset that is losing money, especially when the state legislature shows no sign of changing the 2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act.\nWhether you side with Henderson in her quest to keep paying $640 a month for her two-bedroom or the landlord, \u201cmaximizing profits\u201d has no place in the discussion. There are no profits to maximize at 547 West 157th Street.\n",

        "content": "Remember those probes into city office leases?\nIn November, City Hall\npaused\nplans to move the Department of Aging to 14 Wall Street, following reports that the Department of Citywide Administrative Services\u2019 Jesse Hamilton pushed for the building, owned by a donor to Mayor Eric Adams, to be selected. At the time, then-First Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer indicated that she was reviewing that and other city office leases.\nBut much has changed since then \u2014\u00a0the mayor is poised to escape federal corruption charges and his administration has lost several leaders. Torres-Springer left last week, and there\u2019s been no word on that lease nor various investigations into city office leases.\nDuring a budget hearing on Friday, Council member Lincoln Restler asked DCAS Commissioner Louis Molina about the status of the City Hall probe. Molina said that the Mayor\u2019s Office of Risk Management reviewed the lease at 14 Wall Street and indicated that a decision on that lease is expected soon. As for the broader City Hall review, he directed Restler to City Hall. (A spokesperson told me that they didn\u2019t have an update.)\nMolina also said that DCAS is doing an internal review of asset management overall.\nThe commissioner said that his agency is still preparing a request for proposals to hire five commercial brokerages to\nrepresent the city\non its office leases. That\u2019s up from the two, Cushman &amp; Wakefield and CBRE, that the city currently works with.\nHe said the process is taking longer than initially anticipated because there were aspects of the leasing process, illustrated in part by the experience with 14 Wall Street, that Molina wants to strengthen. He said the RFP is under legal review.\nThen the conversation turned to broker Diana Boutross, the broker whose phone was\nreportedly seized\nby the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office as part of an investigation into city leases.\nRestler asked if Boutross was still the lead on Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s contract with the city and if DCAS had looked into her work on city leases, citing her \u201cglaring lack of qualifications\u201d related to office leasing. Molina confirmed that she is still on the team but noted that there are other brokers who also work on the city\u2019s contract. He said DCAS has not scrutinized her work on city leases but also disagreed with Restler\u2019s comment about her qualifications.\nHamilton has stayed out of the limelight. He wasn\u2019t at the Friday hearing (Molina said Hamilton had a medical issue).\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: During the budget hearing, Molina said the city is on track to cut building emissions 40 percent by fiscal year 2027 (after missing its\ninitial target\n) and then 50 percent by 2030. Restler expressed concern that the city may not reach those goals, given that the city has only reduced emissions by 26 percent so far. He said the city needs to lead by example as private building owners face a May deadline to submit reports showing that their buildings\u2019 emissions comply with Local Law 97. Will the city meet its own emission targets?

Chesterton\u2019s Catholic priest-turned-amateur detective, Father Brown, Levinson and Link wrote in their book, \u201cStay Tuned: An Inside Look at the Making of Prime Time Television.\u201d Thank you to my husband, who is reading \u201cCrime and Punishment\u201d for the first time and somehow made this connection before I did. As someone with great love for \u201cColumbo\u201d and \u201cCrime and Punishment,\u201d I found his discovery delightful and infuriating.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 A federal judge on Thursday dealt another blow to the nonprofit fighting to hold onto the Elizabeth Street Garden. The judge rejected the nonprofit\u2019s request to issue a preliminary injunction to block the city from moving forward with evicting the garden. The group, which is also called Elizabeth Street Garden, said it is filing an appeal of that decision. The city plans to build more than 100 units of senior housing on the site.\n\u2014 Bottem Realty has agreed to pay $403,000 to resolve penalties for failing to register rent-stabilized units and overcharging tenants, according to the state Department of Homes and Community Renewal. The agency issued the penalties after auditing Bottem\u2019s rent-regulated portfolio, which includes 266 apartments across seven buildings in Brooklyn and the Bronx.\n\u2014 Amy Schumer is selling the \u201cMoonstruck\u201d house. Two years after buying 19 Cranberry Street in Brooklyn Heights, the townhouse featured in the 1987 film starring Cher and Nicholas Cage, Schumer has listed it for $14 million,\nCurbed reports\n.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Friday was for a condo unit for\n$10 million\nat 108 Leonard Street. The Tribeca condo is 3,700 square feet and is a new development.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s\nElena Sarkissian, Raphael De Niro, Christopher Salierno, Matthew Mackay and Jane Powers have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$5 million\nfor 204-06 East 58th Street. The Midtown East, mixed-use building is four stories and has 9,800 square feet of floor area.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $30 million for a condo unit at 823 Park Avenue. The penthouse is 7,200 square feet and last sold on the market in 2008 for $30.5 million.\nCompass\u2019\nMaria Manuche, Clare Cukier and Michelle Flikerski have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 195,636-square-foot, eight-story affordable housing building with a community facility at 570 Eldert Lane in Brooklyn.

        "content": "For a few noteworthy Upper East Side properties, years on the market are turning into signed contracts.\nA pet entrepreneur\u2019s Fifth Avenue condo\nfinally found a buyer\nlast week after seven years of on-and-off shopping. The sixth-floor apartment topped Manhattan\u2019s luxury market, per Olshan Realty\u2019s weekly report, with an asking price of around $25 million.\nWhy now? Appraiser Jonathan Miller said buyers are making moves this year despite some uncertainty in the market.\nAlso, a $17 million price cut from its initial ask doesn\u2019t hurt.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing better pricing coming into the market as a general rule,\u201d said appraiser Jonathan Miller. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you most of those properties that have started to sell have had price reductions.\u201d\nAllen Simon, the inventor of the Wee Wee pad, and his wife, Cynthia Simon, bought the apartment at 838 Fifth Avenue for $11 million about 25 years ago. The couple has tried to sell their three-bedroom unit since 2018, first for $42 million, then $40 million, then $27 million before settling on $24.5 million.\nThe condo traded about a month after a Gilded Age mansion roughly 10 blocks up\nlanded an inked deal\nafter four years on and off the market. The sprawling home at 973 Fifth Avenue, which last traded for $42 million in 2012, once asked an eye-popping $80 million.\nBut it only snagged a buyer after dropping the price to just under $50 million.\n\u201cBuyers are much more sort of handcuffed,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the flexibility, so there\u2019s less tolerance for pie-in-the-sky valuation.\u201d\nWeeks after the townhouse entered contract, another historic Upper East Side home, known as the Woolworth Mansion,\nlowered its price\nfrom $60 million to $50 million. The listing broker, Adam Modlin, brought the buyer to the 973 Fifth Avenue purchase.\nIf sellers\u2019 latest moves are any indication, the neighborhood could start seeing more of its long-listed trophy properties in the hands of new owners.\n\n\u201c[Sellers] are just getting back in line with what market conditions actually are,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd when they\u2019re in line with market conditions, they\u2019re actually selling.\u201d\nNot so fast\u2026\nThe residential market is still moving though brokers say uncertainty and volatility are likely on the horizon.\nAcross the country, home sales\nrose 4 percent\nfrom January to February, though transactions were down slightly from the same period last year, according to the National Association of Realtors\u2019 monthly report.\nIn New York, new signed contracts rose again last month across Manhattan and Brooklyn, along with new listings hitting the market, according to Miller Samuel\u2019s monthly report. In Brooklyn, pending deals increased particularly in the luxury segment, defined as $2 million, compared to the overall market.\nIf listings continue to grow in each of the boroughs, deals are expected to continue to trend upward and restore a healthy pace of home sales to a market that was sluggish through 2023 and the beginning of 2024.\n\u201cThe way I\u2019ve described 2025 is getting back to zero,\u201d Miller said.\nWhile agents have warned about hesitancy in the market with an ever-changing policy landscape, the spring season is likely to boost activity.\n\u201cApril is really where things really take off,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThe uncertainty that we\u2019ve seen with tariff policy is not really causing the market to hold back yet. The volatility in the stock market doesn\u2019t seem to be holding things back.\u201d\nNYC Deal of the Week\nAn apartment at Witkoff Group\u2019s 150 Charles Street set a new record for Downtown Manhattan when it closed for\n$60 million\nearlier this week. The deal \u2014 the priciest to land in the city register \u2014 was double what the sellers, financier Harsh Padia and his wife, interior designer Purvi Padi, paid for it in 2016. The duplex has five bedrooms, five bathrooms and a sprawling terrace overlooking the Hudson River.\n",

Affordable housing in New York continues to be hard to come by.\nLast year, NYCHA selected 200,000 Section 8 tenants by lottery to be awarded Housing Choice Vouchers. Nine months after the application window closed, NYCHA worked its way through 12,000 applications; of those, only 318 succeeded in obtaining affordable housing through the program.\n\nIn a city with nearly six million renters, 318 is the statistical equivalent of zero,\nwrites columnist Erik Engquist\n.\nAlthough the Housing Choice Vouchers may not be much of a lifeline these days, the office market received a big one recently. A trio of Midtown office buildings\nscored 10-figure CMBS deals\nin February, a sign of post-pandemic recovery for trophy commercial properties.\nIrvine Company\u2019s MetLife Building landed the largest CMBS deal of the three, a $1.5 billion loan issued by Bank of America and Wells Fargo. Aby Rosen\u2019s RFR Holding scored a $1.2 billion refinancing of the Seagram Building, while Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge\u2019s trophy office tower at\n3 Bryant Park\ngrabbed a massive $1.1 billion CMBS loan.\nOn the crime beat, a federal judge in New Jersey sentenced Moshe Silber\nto 30 months\nin prison for his involvement in a broad mortgage fraud scandal, sparing him the maximum sentence. He faced up to five years after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mortgage fraud in 2024.\nMeanwhile, four individuals \u2014 including one real estate agent \u2014 were\nindicted\nfor allegedly stealing three homes in Queens through a deed fraud scheme involving falsified documents.

        "content": "After a year and a half on the market, the late Mary Tyler Moore\u2019s Greenwich estate may finally be sold.\nThe actress\u2019 widower, retired cardiologist Robert Levine, agreed to sell the property at 50 Dingletown Road, the New York Post\nreported\n. While the deal is in contract, a sale of the lavish Connecticut home has not been finalized.\nThe potential purchase price and buyer\u2019s identity were not reported.\nLevine listed the 14,000-square-foot property in September 2023 for\n$21.9 million\nbut slashed the asking price on the home multiple times. Last April, Levine dropped the ask to $18.9 million. In July, he dropped it even further to $16.9 million, the asking price when the home went into contract.\nAt the final asking price, the deal would break down to $1,207 per square foot.\nThe couple purchased the seven-acre estate for roughly $10 million in 2006. Moore, known for starring on \u201cThe Dick Van Dyke Show\u201d and \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d died in 2017; Levine decided to sell as part of the moving on process after his wife\u2019s death.\n\nThey tore down the Georgian-style house \u2014 with the exception of the front facade \u2014 and spent three years doubling the size of the property. The entryway has a curved staircase and harlequin-patterned floors, and a wall of windows to look out on the garden and a skylight. The primary suite, meanwhile, is in its own wing, featuring dual dressing rooms, including a closet with 100 linear feet of hanging space.\nThe property also has a spa with a massage room, hot tub and sauna, a gym with a ballet barre, a solarium, a billiards room and an outdoor pool.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Joseph Barbieri has the\nlisting\n.\nLevine previously said a portion of proceeds from the sale will go towards the Mary Tyler Moore Vision Initiative, which aims to preserve and restore vision for those with diabetes; Moore was diagnosed with diabetes in 1969.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Joseph Safdie bought a Gowanus development site a little over a year ago, betting on a replacement for the expired 421a tax abatement.\nThe bet seemed to pay off in April when the state passed a revamped version called\n485x\n. But it had deeper affordability requirements than 421a, and a higher wage scale for workers depending on location and project size.\nSafdie grabbed his pencil and started calculating construction costs for his property on the corner of Fourth Avenue and 14th Street.\n\u201cNormally, the density for such a site would be 140 apartments or so,\u201d said Safdie, chief executive of JSAF Capital Holdings. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t pencil out, given that if you add an extra 20 to 30 units your cost of construction goes up dramatically.\u201d\nSafdie scaled back the number of apartments to 99 to avoid the $40 wage floor that kicks in at 100 units. He isn\u2019t the only one who has drawn that conclusion.\nSeventeen new building permits for projects with exactly 99 units have been filed since January, when 485x went into effect. Those include several projects where developers subdivided large properties into multiple 99-unit projects. By some estimates, construction costs for buildings with more than 100 units are up 15 to 25 percent under the new program.\nThat\u2019s motivating many developers to weigh the cost of subdividing large lots.\n\u201cEvery large site that I have where rental housing is the highest and best use, developers are spending more time trying to figure out how to subdivide the site to create pads on which they could build 99-unit buildings than thinking about anything else,\u201d said BKREA\u2019s Bob Knakal, adding that the cost of multiple building cores, heating plants, roofs and other infrastructure, still pencils out to less.\nKnakal is marketing a\nlarge development\nsite in East Harlem owned by the Durst Organization, where buyers are exploring that strategy. Nearby, Cheskel Schwimmer\u2019s Chess Builders filed plans for two adjacent 99-unit buildings on the\nUpper East Side\n.\n\nIn Brooklyn, developer\nYitzchok Katz\nof Goose Property Management has filed three new building plans for 99-unit buildings at a Boerum Hill development site he bought in April. And the\nJay Group\nfiled plans for 450 units in Downtown Brooklyn, spread among five buildings, in an apparent nod to the 485x wage requirement.\n\u201cIt has had the opposite effect of trying to get better wages for construction workers \u2014 in some cases $40 minimum wage an hour, in some cases $72 minimum wage per hour,\u201d Knakal said, referencing the higher wage floor for projects with more than 150 units in some parts of the city. \u201cMake it $472 an hour. What\u2019s the difference? No one\u2019s getting those jobs anyway.\u201d\nLaborers unions that lobbied for the wage floor argue that large affordable housing developments have been built in the South Bronx, East Harlem and Brownsville in recent years with a $40 per hour wage standard after the construction unions\nreached deals\nwith individual developers.\n\u201cThese projects clearly show that construction laborers can be paid a $40 per hour wage while increasing the supply of affordable housing in our city,\u201d said Mike Prohaska of Laborers\u2019 Local 79.\nGary LaBarbera, president of the Building &amp; Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, said, \u201cIt is clear that these developers [building 99 units] are trying to unashamedly circumvent the law to avoid paying hard-working New Yorkers the fair and family-sustaining wages they deserve.\u201d\nBut developers also need construction loans, and lenders might deem projects with more than 99 units too risky.\n\u201cIf we were concerned about it, then I\u2019m sure the bank would be concerned about it,\u201d Safdie said. \u201cWe\u2019re only going to do a project that makes sense on our level, and we know what the banks will lend.\u201d\nA few developers will still opt for rentals with more than 100 units \u2014 if they bought their land cheap, have held it for a while and prefer the steady income of rentals over condo development, said Mark Willis of the NYU Furman Center. But the 485x program makes most of those larger projects apparently unworkable.\n\u201cDevelopers are dividing lots up, and it\u2019s all about the higher labor costs for bigger buildings,\u201d Willis said. \u201cThe resulting proliferation of separate structures with more lobbies and elevator banks and, in some cases, less units makes you wonder if 485x has ended up impairing the goal of expanding the supply of housing \u2014 and of affordable housing, in particular.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Marcy Javor is among a handful of top real estate agents who deal in one of Boca Raton\u2019s most expensive communities, the\nRoyal Palm Yacht &amp; Country Club\n.\nJavor promotes herself as part of the leading half percent of agents in the country, declaring that she\u2019s closed more than $1.6 billion in sales.\n\u201cLuxury real estate moves fast, and having the right agent makes all the difference,\u201d she wrote in a recent post on social media.\nBut Javor, who hangs her license with\nBoca Raton\n-based Signature One Luxury Estates, is accused of behavior associated with another type of real estate agent.\nJavor is tied up in litigation with former clients and is under investigation by the state. She is accused of misrepresenting herself as a broker, failing to disclose material changes to agreements with clients, lying about having buyers at the ready, and publishing misleading and inaccurate information about properties, court filings allege.\nThey are allegations that she disputes.\nIt all points to ongoing issues that buyers, sellers and agents have to handle on their own because the industry is under-regulated, experts say. It\u2019s especially true in Florida, where more than 320,000 brokers and real estate agents are licensed, outnumbering attorneys four to one.\nJavor is fighting back. Last year, Signature One Luxury Estates sued a former client, Arnold Galman, as part of a lawsuit that included Boca Raton\u2019s top broker,\nDavid Roberts\nand his Royal Palm Properties. (Roberts and Royal Palm are no longer parties in the complaint.) Two months later, in July, Javor filed a defamation lawsuit against Galman.\nFrom futures to real estate\nJavor has been a licensed real estate agent in Florida for about a decade, after she exited the futures industry in 2015.\nIn her application with the state to become a real estate agent, she allegedly failed to disclose that in her prior career as a commodities broker, she had been\nforced to withdraw\nfrom the National Futures Association and was ordered not to register as an associated person or principal of an NFA member for a period of four years.\nThe NFA found that Javor and her companies made misleading sales solicitations and provided false information, violating the NFA\u2019s compliance rules.\nJavor said in a statement to\nThe Real Deal\nthat she had already planned to leave the business before that complaint, which she said \u201cwas based on a partner who sent out information without my knowledge.\u201d\nNow, Javor is under investigation by Florida\u2019s Department of Business and Professional Regulation, which oversees and regulates the real estate industry, among other professions.\nDBPR is investigating the allegation that Javor obtained her license by fraud and perjury, according to a copy of a complaint submitted to the state.\nA spokesperson for DBPR declined to comment, and said it could not \u201cconfirm or deny\u201d the existence of complaints filed against Javor because the information obtained during an investigation is confidential. No complaints are listed on\nJavor\u2019s license\n. They would only appear on the state\u2019s website if a state panel determines there was probable cause, and rules against the agent or broker.\nAs in many states, DBPR is the only government authority that can revoke a license, issue fines or suspensions, and few agents and brokers face serious repercussions among the total complaints filed, a\nTRD investigation\nlast year found. It\u2019s also a self-regulating system: The state will typically only open an investigation if other brokers, agents or consumers file legally sufficient complaints.\nOftentimes, the most effective recourse that consumers or fellow real estate agents and brokers have is to sue.\nIn 2023, former clients filed two lawsuits against Javor. Matthew Epstein sued in July, and in November, Quentin Gillette and Beth Gillette, founders of a utility systems contractor called PowerGrid Services, filed a separate complaint.\nThe four complaints, including the defamation lawsuit against Galman and the one Signature One filed, are still open, according to Palm Beach County Circuit Court filings.\nEpstein lawsuit\nEpstein, CEO of real estate development and investment firm Delray Beach-based Primark Partners, sued Javor over her involvement in his $5.6 million purchase and subsequent listing of the planned spec mansion at 207 West Coconut Palm Road in Boca\u2019s Royal Palm in 2021.\nEpstein alleges that Javor misrepresented herself as a licensed broker and failed to disclose that she edited a listing agreement. She allegedly falsely represented that she only changed the price, when in reality she altered the commission structure and terms, according to the lawsuit. The edited agreement included conflicting terms saying that Javor was required to share all offers with Epstein, but also that she had the right to withhold verbal offers, according to the lawsuit.\nThe complaint also alleges that Javor lied about having interested buyers, pushing Epstein to sign the listing agreement quickly. While Javor agreed via text to a 2 percent commission, her brokerage Signature One actually was paid a commission of 3 percent, or about $180,000, on a $5.6 million deal.\nJavor also allegedly published inaccurate marketing materials about the property without submitting them to Epstein first, the lawsuit states. Javor allegedly acted \u201cwith the authority to execute the listing agreement, operate her real estate office, and make all decisions related to the marketing and listing of the property contrary to plaintiff\u2019s instructions and objections.\u201d\nJavor and Signature One deny the allegations, court filings show.\n\nSignature One and Javor\u2019s attorney, Brian Koch of Holland &amp; Knight, wrote in a motion late last year that Epstein \u201cmanufactured claims\u201d to avoid his contractual obligations.\n\u201cTo the extent that Epstein claims he did not review what he signed, that is 100% Epstein\u2019s fault \u2014 and he is therefore barred from his own admitted negligence in not reviewing a contract before he signed it.\u201d\nJavor and Signature One filed a motion to compel Epstein to disclose the amounts paid for construction and improvements he made to the property. During his deposition in January, he testified that the project ran over budget and that he made special upgrades to justify a nearly $30 million asking price. The house is now listed with Roberts of Royal Palm Properties for the same price.\nIn a statement to\nTRD\n, Epstein said his complaint \u201cspeaks for itself.\u201d\n\u201cThe fact that Ms. Javor is countersuing me because she believes she\u2019s entitled to a million dollar-plus commission without ever bringing a single written offer is shameful and puts other realtors in a bad light,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cIf Ms. Javor, or any agent for that matter, ever produced a buyer that met my terms and closed the transaction, I would be more than happy to pay the commission that was rightfully earned. However, I refuse to pay for work not performed or held hostage by anyone.\u201d\nSignature One\u2019s broker, Ben Schachter, said in a statement that \u201cpeople can say anything\u201d in a lawsuit. \u201cThe evidence in the case refutes Mr. Epstein\u2019s allegations,\u201d he said.\nGillettes\u2019 lawsuit\nThe Gillettes\u2019 lawsuit, filed in late 2023, alleges that Javor, Signature One, Dennis Lynde and Beaches MLS misrepresented the year the home they bought at 231 Thatch Palm Drive was built. The Gillettes were on the hunt for a newly built home, and based on the listing and a home inspection report provided by Javor, they believed the property was constructed in 2021.\nThe Gillettes entered into a contract with the seller, Lynde, to purchase the house for $10 million, which included a $300,000 commission to Signature One, according to court filings. After closing, the Gillettes then spent about $1.5 million to make improvements to the home, so they could potentially flip it for $15 million, filings show. When they began interviewing brokers to market and sell the house, they discovered the original structure was built in 1971.\n\u201cAs a Realtor, I was not involved in daily construction, but had been advised and was of the belief that the home was newly built,\u201d Javor said in a statement provided to\nTRD\n. \u201cI understand several million dollars went into new additions and the major construction that took place between 2019 and 2021.\u201d\nThe Gillettes ended up selling the property for $10 million, a \u201csubstantial loss,\u201d they allege in their complaint. They allege fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\nThe definition of \u201cnew construction\u201d is at the center of Javor and Signature One\u2019s questioning in a deposition of Beth Gillette.\n\u201cThat house should have been listed as a remodel,\u201d she said in her deposition.\nLawsuits with Arnold Galman\nAbout a year ago, property management mogul Galman began working with Javor. Galman entered into a buyer/broker agreement with Signature One, agreeing to work exclusively with the brokerage for any purchases in Florida for six months. If any deals were to arise, he would owe Signature a 3 percent commission, plus a transaction fee.\nA few days after signing that agreement, Galman signed a contract to pay about $11.8 million for the waterfront mansion at 2348 East Maya Drive in the Royal Palm community. The sale closed in April.\nTheir agreement is at the heart of two lawsuits and at least one counterclaim.\nSignature sued Galman to collect the commission it alleges it\u2019s owed for the deal. The commission is being held in escrow due to the dispute.\nIn a separate complaint, Javor is suing Galman and his company, the Jenkintown, Pennsylvania-based Galman Group, alleging that he has \u201corchestrated a smear campaign \u2026 after his initial bullying and intimidation tactics proved unsuccessful.\u201d\nIn his counterclaim, Galman said that he planned to withdraw his offer and recoup his initial deposit, because he believed the $11.8 million price was too high. But Javor convinced him she could find a buyer to flip the property for a profit of at least $500,000. If not, she would waive her entire commission, according to a letter signed by Javor, which is included in the counterclaim. Galman alleges that Signature One forged Gaiman\u2019s name on the buyer/tenant broker agreement, without his knowledge or consent.\nGalman\u2019s attorney, Stephen Padula of Padula Bennardo Levine, told\nTRD\nthat Galman expected Javor to represent his interests as his agent, but she did not, he said.\nGalman refused to pay the commission, and threatened Javor with allegedly defamatory mailers.\nIn May, a month after the $11.8 million deal closed, Schachter emailed Galman and said that Javor didn\u2019t have the authority to agree to waive her commission. Signature is also suing for a 3 percent commission on a separate deal, Galman\u2019s $515,000 purchase of a townhouse in Boca Raton last May. Signature alleges Galman \u201cintentionally circumvented\u201d Javor\u2019s brokerage.\nTheir battle quickly became unpleasant.\nGalman emailed Javor, Leonard Albanese of Albanese Builders and Schachter that he planned to expose Javor\u2019s alleged \u201cdishonesty and treachery.\u201d\n\u201cHire your lawyers \u2014 you are liars and dishonest !\u201d an email he sent to her reads. \u201cMarcy I am just getting started ~ you know the truth\u2026. you flat out lied to me !\u201d\n",

        "content": "Affiliated Development is the latest South Florida developer to nab construction financing for an apartment project, despite a slowing multifamily market.\nFort Lauderdale-based Affiliated, led by CEO Jeffrey Burns, secured an $80 million loan from Bank of Montreal to build The Era, a planned eight-story building with 400 apartments in the firm\u2019s home city, records show. The developer recently broke ground on The Era, which is on a 2.7-acre assemblage at 2125 South Andrews Avenue that Affiliated bought for\n$15.4 million\nlast year.\nBanks are showing confidence in the South Florida multifamily market, even as the region is experiencing an oversupply of apartments. Last year, developers completed 18,600 rental units, outpacing 15,000 net new leases signed, according to\nCoStar\ndata. Some landlords of new multifamily projects are offering prospective tenants incentives such as free months rent or the waiver of fees.\nYet, Affiliated is the fourth apartment developer to score a construction loan this month. In the biggest financing, New York-based Baron Property Group snagged a\n$206 million\nloan to build Metro Parc North, an eight-story building with 661 apartments in Hialeah.\n\nSantander Bank provided a\n$67.5 million\nconstruction loan for a 383-unit multifamily complex in Davie developed by Coconut Grove-based 13th Floor Investments and Miami Beach-based JSB Capital. TM Real Estate, a developer also based in Coconut Grove, landed\n$53.5 million\nin financing from Truist Bank to build a complex of 10 buildings with 250 units in Boynton Beach.\nBank of Montreal is bullish on Affiliated. In September, the financial institution provided a\n$50 million\nconstruction loan for the developer\u2019s planned 270-unit mixed-income apartment project in West Palm Beach called The Spruce, a press release states.\nFor The Era, Affiliated also received more than $5.5 million in property tax reimbursements from the city of Fort Lauderdale and Broward County in exchange for setting aside 210 units for workforce housing.\nLast year, Affiliated completed\nThe Grand\n, an eight-story building with 301 apartments and ground-floor retail in West Palm Beach. The firm is also developing\nThe Pierce\n, a 236-unit workforce housing project in Boynton Beach. Overall, Affiliated has $1.5 billion worth of projects that are completed or are under construction, the firm\u2019s website states.",

The lawsuit, filed in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, also names as defendants 13 contractors that filed liens between January and this month totaling nearly $950,000 in work that allegedly hasn\u2019t been paid.\nThe contractors include Coconut Grove-based\nArquitectonica\n, which designed the project, and Aventura-based Rieber Developments, which managed construction of\n1212 Aventura\n.\n\u201cMedical District Developments owes my company and multiple other companies money,\u201d Rieber Developments CEO Bernardo Rieber said in an email. \u201cDornin mentions all of us seeking to wipe out the construction debt owed to us.\u201d\n\nMedical District Developments hired Rieber Developments shortly after acquiring the 1.8-acre site for $2.9 million in 2019, records show.\n1212 Aventura\nconsists of 163 assisted living apartments, 39 medical offices spanning 25,796 square feet and 29,684 square feet of retail.\nIn 2021, Medical District Developments increased an existing $15 million loan from Coconut Grove-based BridgeInvest to $63.5 million. But a year later, the property owner allegedly defaulted on the loan by failing to invest its own capital to complete the project.\nBridgeInvest\nwarned Medical District developments that the project had a shortfall of $3.7 million of equity capital to cover cost overruns, the lawsuit states.\nBridgeInvest granted Medical District Developments two forbearances in 2022 and 2023. The second forbearance agreement required the property owner to place $15 million in an account for construction costs, which was provided by an investor that has a pending lawsuit filed in December against Medical District Developments, Rieber Developments and BridgeInvest.\nMedical District Developments allegedly defaulted on the second forbearance agreement by failing to pay the principal and interest owed on the loan by a Dec. 31, 2023 maturity date, the lawsuit states. Last month, Dorin\u2019s affiliate bought the mortgage from BridgeInvest.",

The apartment building would include 23 affordable housing units and 12 workforce housing units. The rental townhouse units would include two designated as affordable housing units and one as workforce housing, according to its amended site plan proposal.\n\nOak Lane also plans to replace about two-thirds of the space in the 130,150-square-foot office building that houses its headquarters with an 11,447-square-foot restaurant, a 2,570-square-feet outdoor dining area and an indoor recreation space spanning 72,428 square feet, the amended site plan proposal shows.\nThe planning and zoning board voted unanimously on Thursday to recommend conditional use approval of the recreation space planned inside the office building, which would include racquet courts, climbing walls, a miniature golf course and a toddler area.\nProperty records show that a company controlled by Oak Lane paid\n$20 million in 2023\nto acquire its 10-acre office property at 791 Park of Commerce Boulevard in\nPark at Broken Sound,\na 700-acre commercial and residential hub in Boca Raton.\nThe Live Local Act\nencourages commercial-industrial multifamily developments with an affordable housing component in areas not zoned for residential property.\nUnder the state law, municipal government staff can approve residential developments in non-residential zones, without review by elected city leaders, if the developments include affordable housing with below-market rents.\u201cThe project meets the eligibility requirements and development standards for CIMDs,\u201d Heather Hansen, a senior planner for the city of\nBoca Raton\n, said at the city\u2019s planning and zoning board meeting on Thursday, referring to Oak Lane\u2019s development.",

The buildings, 136,256 square feet combined, were completed between 1976 and 1980.\nFounded in 2013 by Macfarland, Kohl\u2019s Department Stores co-founder Sidney Kohl and Alliant co-founder James Jenkins, SROA Capital owns 650 self-storage facilities across the nation that total more than 30 million square feet, according to the firm\u2019s website. In South Florida, SROA Capital owns eight self-storage facilities in Palm Beach County, as well as four more in Hollywood, North Miami, Miami and Key West.\nThe $167 average rental rate for a 5-foot-by-5-foot self-storage unit in South Florida is the second highest in the country, according to a recent StorageCafe report. The tri-county region added 234,522 square feet of\nself-storage\nspace last year, representing a 2.7 percent increase, year-over-year, the report found. Developers are planning to complete another 348,159 square feet of new self-storage space this year.\nStill, the industrial subsector has only seen a few trades in the last year. In October, Ladera Ranch, California-based SmartStop acquired a North Miami self-storage facility completed in 2022 for\n$30.8 million\n. And in August, Houston-based Silver Star Properties paid\n$26.5 million\nfor a Delray Beach self-storage facility as part of a company reorganization to focus only on self-storage and single-tenant properties.",

        "content": "Insurance mogul Ivan Herrera\u2019s family office acquired a Miami apartment building for $71.5 million that was developed by the late Sergio Pino.\nThe sale of 850 Living, an eight-story multifamily project with 230 units at 811 Northwest 43rd Avenue, resolves the disposition of another key property among Pino\u2019s numerous assets that his widow,\nTatiana Pino\n, and her brother-in-law, Carlos Pino, are battling over in Miami-Dade family probate court. Separately, a lender filed a foreclosure lawsuit in November, alleging 850 Living\u2019s ownership entity defaulted on a\n$45.4 million\nmortgage debt.\nSale proceeds will pay off the lender, Lument, and the remainder will go to Pino\u2019s estate.\nOn July 16 of last year,\nPino\ndied from a self-inflicted gunshot wound as federal agents were serving a warrant to arrest him for orchestrating a murder-for-hire plot against Tatiana Pino.\n\u201cWorking with the estate\u2019s curator to get [850 Living] sold was the right thing to do,\u201d said Glen Waldman, Tatiana Pino\u2019s lawyer. \u201cWe are pleased with the outcome.\u201d\nCarlos Pino\u2019s attorney Sergio Mendez and representatives for the buyer, an affiliate of Herrera\u2019s\nUnicapital Asset Management Group\n, declined to comment.\n\nNancy Pastor, trustee for 850 Living\u2019s ownership entity who brokered the sale, also declined to comment. Pastor was reportedly dating Sergio Pino, who founded Century Homebuilders Group, one of the largest Hispanic-owned national home development firms.\nThis month, Century Homebuilders, now led by Tatiana Pino, sold three development sites in southwest Miami-Dade County for\n$25 million\nto national homebuilder Lennar in a deal that was approved by Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Yvonne Colodny, who is presiding over the estate case.\nIn August, Colodny appointed Coral Gables-based certified public accountant Philip Schecter as curator of Pino\u2019s estate after Carlos Pino filed motions to be appointed as personal representative of his late brother\u2019s assets.\nTatiana Pino\ncontested her brother-in-law\u2019s motion, but both sides agreed to have an independent curator catalog and appraise Pino\u2019s assets, as well as defend against any lawsuits and handle any taxes owed by the estate, court records show. Funds are being held in a trust until the dispute between Tatiana Pino and Carlos Pino is resolved.\nOn March 12, Colodny approved Schecter\u2019s motion allowing Pastor to sell the apartment building to Herrera\u2019s Unicapital. In January, Herrera launched the family office when he partially sold Univista Insurance for $700 million.\nIn 2021, an entity managed by Herrera, his wife Ania Herrera and Univista COO Luis Castro, paid\n$47.5 million\nfor a two-tower office complex at 850 Northwest 42nd Avenue (also known as Le Jeune Road). Those buildings, as well as 850 Living and a parking garage connecting both projects were developed by Pino and partner Pactia USA.\n850 Living\u2019s ownership entity and the Univista entity filed dueling civil lawsuits in 2023 over use of the garage, but both complaints were dismissed last year, court records show.",

Built in 1926, the Spanish Revival-designed home was used during Prohibition, according to the listing.\nThe seller is Los Angeles-based Black Hill LLC, which state filings indicate is tied to talent manager Mark Gillespie.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Eric Lavey holds the listing.\nSouth of Beverly Hills in Hermosa Beach, is last week\u2019s second-largest home that went into contract, based on a listing price of nearly $12 million.\nThe seller is a trust tied to Dean and Kelli Hallett. Dean Hallett is the president of executive coaching and leadership firm Hallett Leadership. He previously held executive positions at Twentieth Century Fox and Walt Disney Studios.\nJoseph Group\u2019s William Joseph and Rachel Joseph have the listing at 2722 Hermosa Avenue.\nThe four-bed, six-bath home was built in 2020 and totals nearly 4,800 square feet.

It will replace a 1.6-acre field.\nPlans call for a complex of mostly market-rate apartments, with two units set aside as affordable for moderate-income tenants. A project cost and timeline for construction were not disclosed.\n\u201cThis apartment project will provide funding to support the church and its good works for the next 100 years,\u201d Fr. William Goldin, parochial administrator at Our Lady of Guadalupe, told the council.\nThe project received strong pushback from neighbors, who voiced concerns about privacy, traffic and parking. The project also received criticism from affordable housing advocates, who took issue with its mostly market-rate homes.\nCesar Covarrubias, executive director of the Kennedy Commission, a nonprofit advocate based in Irvine, said he noticed the Diocese didn\u2019t seek a density bonus to build more units in exchange for more affordable housing. It also didn\u2019t employ\nSenate Bill 4\n, a state law that streamlines developments on churches and other faith-based properties.\n\u201cIt appears as if they\u2019re trying to do just market-driven development to maximize their return,\u201d Covarrubias said.\n\nThat\u2019s the point, Douglas Woodward, a consultant for the Diocese, told the council.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like any other apartment complex, it just happens to be owned by the Diocese,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an apartment complex where we are going to find people that want to call La Habra home, who want a beautiful new neighborhood and are willing to rent there.\u201d\nThe Diocese of Orange is moving into housing after the Archdiocese of Los Angeles\nannounced in August\nit aimed to turn its unused properties into affordable housing for workers, seniors and at-risk young adults. It\u2019s also following some churches in OC now\nturning properties into homes\n.\nThe Diocese, which oversees 56 parish churches, 41 schools and three hospitals, also plans to build homes in Santa Ana, Irvine and Fullerton. It will consider employing SB 4 to streamline approvals, according to a spokesperson.\n\u201cThe Diocese of Orange is committed to serving both its local faithful and the wider community in ways that align with its values and long-term vision,\u201d Jarryd Gonzales, the Diocese spokesperson, told the Daily Pilot. \u201cAs part of this commitment, we are actively assessing underutilized property assets to better serve our communities and generate funds to support our ministries.\u201d\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "W.P. Carey is selling the Binoculars Building off the Venice Beach Boardwalk,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nThe New York-based real estate investment trust hired CBRE to put the 78,578-square-foot building currently occupied by Google up for sale, according to an offering memo obtained by\nTRD.\nThe brokerage did not provide an asking price for the historic, binoculars-shaped building at 340 West Main Street, but nine other smaller, and less whimsical office buildings currently listed in Venice are asking $1,583 per square foot on average, according to Loopnet. Google\u2019s triple-net-lease at the building,\nwhich dates back to 2011\n, is up for renewal in October 2030, according to the offering memo.\nW.P. Carey\u2019s history with the property goes back much further than Google. The company bought the Venice building\nfor about $18.3 million in 1995\n. In 2023, it\nannounced a massive spinoff of 59 of its office properties\ninto a separate REIT, and the Binoculars Building was\non the list\nfacing a possible reappraisal or sale.\nAside from the Venice location, Google has a campus spanning three buildings in Silicon Beach. The tech giant\u2019s long-term plans for those properties are unclear. Google reversed course on its office expansion in L.A. last year and its former development partners Hudson Pacific and Macerich\nsold the former Los Angeles Mall to the University of California, Los Angeles\u00a0 for about $700 million\n.\nA spokesperson for Google did not immediately provide any comments.\n\nThere will likely be dueling bids for the one-of-a-kind property in Venice, according to CBRE\u2019s Todd Tydlaska, who\u2019s marketing the property along with Sean Sullivan, Michael Longo, Melissa Moock and Grant Goldman.\nTydlaska said through a CBRE spokesperson that there\u2019s already been \u201cstrong initial interest\u201d in the listing. He anticipates a \u201ccompetitive process,\u201d he added via the spokesperson.\nOffice vacancy has fallen faster in West Los Angeles than Downtown, but it\u2019s still hovering around 22 percent, according to a report by CBRE. Current average asking rent for office space in Venice is unclear, but asking rent in neighborhoods like Century City and Marina Del Ray has climbed faster than other parts of the city, reaching an average of $5.57 per square foot last quarter, according to the report.\n\u201cThis listing is a good example of what capital wants in the market right now,\u201d Tydlaska said. \u201cGreat locations, high-profile assets\u2026 at attractive price bases.\u201d\nThe CBRE spokesperson declined to comment further on the listing and a spokesperson for W.P. Carey did not respond to a request for comment.\n",

That leaves about 6,000 homes in the Palisades and surrounding areas to go.\n\u201cWe want this to be happening on your lot, too,\u201d Mayor Karen Bass said at a news conference in the Palisades.\nThe first permit was issued March 5, nearly two months after the Jan. 7 Palisades fire ripped through half the upscale neighborhood along the coast\nAnother approved permit was for repairs to a fire-damaged master bedroom, bathroom and garage of a split-level home near Rustic Canyon, according to city records and Paul Lobana, the structural engineer for the project. The homeowner submitted plans to city inspectors Feb. 17.\nThe Times wasn\u2019t able to contact the owner of the third property that received a permit to rebuild a home on bluffs overlooking Pacific Coast Highway.\nAs of last week, 72 property owners had submitted rebuilding applications to the city, according to the newspaper.\nAnother 135 property owners submitted blueprints to the L.A. County Department of Public Works for rebuilding in unincorporated areas \u2014 109 in the Eaton fire zone and 26 in the Palisades fire area.\n\nThe county is not approving plans until all debris clearing is complete on the property, Celeste Hampton, a department spokesperson, told the Times.\nBass and L.A. County leaders\nhave promised to streamline\npermitting procedures for homeowners who want to rebuild.\nThe city and county have opened\none-stop permitting centers\nfor fire victims. They\u2019ve also waived discretionary hearings and zoning reviews for those who want to replace their homes with projects of about the same size.\nLocal and state and local officials\nare still determining rebuilding rules\n, including if there will be any changes to building codes to incentivize or require more fire-resistant materials that might affect future permit approvals, according to the Times.\nThis week, Bass\nupdated an existing executive order\nclarifying that new accessory dwelling units would qualify for streamlined permitting. She issued another order to further expedite reviews for homeowners who choose to rebuild with all-electric systems and appliances.\n\u201cWildfires aren\u2019t going away,\u201d Bass told reporters. \u201cAnd climate-fueled disasters aren\u2019t going away, either.\u201d\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is reportedly looking into what\u2019s been a sore spot for real estate since 2023:\nMeasure ULA\n.\nThe 2022 ballot measure, often called the \u201cmansion tax,\u201d applies a tiered assessment to residential and commercial sales within the city. The tax is adjusted each year to account for changes in consumer spending. Thresholds set to go into effect June 30 apply a 4 percent tax on properties starting at $5.3 million and 5.5 percent on those $10.6 million or more.\nNow, city attorneys are looking into the possibility of temporarily nixing ULA to help expedite efforts to rebuild the fire-torn Pacific Palisades, which is part of Los Angeles.\n\u201cThere\u2019s two schools of thought,\u201d Bass said in response to a question on ULA\u2019s pause from\nBreitbart\nduring a March 11 press conference. \u201cOne is, that can\u2019t happen. It has to go back to voters. And the other is that it might be able to happen with action from the council and the mayor\u2019s office.\u201d\nSounds like Bass may have taken a cue from Jason Oppenheim and Ben Belack, who\nopined in a January\nletter, signed by nearly 50 of their colleagues, who called for the loosening of restrictions during the rebuilding process. Among the calls to action was a suggestion that property in fire-affected areas be exempt from Measure ULA.\nOn Feb. 21,\nThe Real Deal\nreached out to Bass\u2019s press team inquiring if it had reviewed the letter and if the suggestions were being considered. A spokesperson for the mayor requested a copy of the letter but did not comment on whether the proposals were under consideration.\nCaruso: \u201ctime and place for politics\u2026is not now\u201d\nThe Grove developer\nRick Caruso\nmade it clear where he stands on a recall attempt of Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, casting it as \u201cnot a good idea.\u201d\nThe comment made on Caruso\u2019s X account was in relation to a recall committee formed earlier this month, helmed by Los Angeles-area agent Sahil Nandwani. The recall effort aims to seize on discontent over Bass\u2019s handling of the Palisades Fire, in addition to safety and housing needs.\n\u201cThere is a time and place for politics, but it is not now,\u201d Caruso said on X, further characterizing such actions as \u201ccostly and expensive political distractions.\u201d\nNicole Shanahan\n, former Robert F. Kennedy Jr. running mate and ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, sought to poke Caruso over his stance asking over X if \u201cpeople deserve accountability.\u201d\nCaruso, who has been outspoken in his critique of Bass and the city\u2019s handling of the fires, reminded Shanahan \u201ca recall election doesn\u2019t happen overnight\u201d and would end up being a costly endeavor.\nOvation Hollywood struggles with occupancy as valuation dives\n\nThe mixed-use property at Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue has seen its value drop as occupancy has also dipped.\nOvation Hollywood\n, which was rebranded from Hollywood &amp; Highland, was recently appraised at $257 million by Morningstar. That\u2019s off 24 percent from $338 million in 2019, despite about $100 million spent in updating the property in 2023.\nThe entertainment and retail center currently counts Shoe Palace, Sephora, Lids, Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 and Johnny Rockets among its tenants.\nShopoff looks to redevelop Buena Park industrial site into housing\nShopoff Realty Investments\nsaw something in a Buena Park industrial site and seized on the opportunity to buy.\nThe Irvine-based development company paid nutritional products maker Amway $60 million for its nearly 14-acre industrial property that Shopoff plans to redevelop into townhomes.\nShopoff President and CEO William Shopoff said in a statement Buena Park \u201coffers a tremendous opportunity for strategic redevelopment\u201d and the company is moving forward on entitlements for its proposed project. The property sits next to the Metrolink and has proximity to Interstate 5 and State Route 91.\nAzria Estate tries on a new price: $39M\nThe\nAzria Estate\nin Holmby Hills has made a fashionable re-entrance into Los Angeles\u2019 luxury residential market.\nThe property at 10250 West Sunset Boulevard, which is being sold by fashion designer Lubov Azria, was recently re-listed for $39 million. That\u2019s down from a high of as much as $88 million as the property\u2019s swung on and off the market for about a decade.\nAzria is the wife of the late Max Azria, founder of BCBG.\nThe re-list comes after Yucaipa Companies founder\nRon Burkle\nsued Lubov Azria after an auction of the property in which the investor had the winning bid went south. Burkle ultimately asked a judge to toss the case late last year.",

Freddie Mac has similar guidelines, but doesn\u2019t keep such a list.\nThe mortgage blacklist has left homeowners stuck with unsellable condos,\naccording to the Wall Street Journal.\nNationwide, 5,191 condo complexes out of 150,000 complexes nationwide were blacklisted, or 3.5 percent of all condos.\n\nThe blacklist has ballooned across SoCal, which contains 64 percent of the 685 blackwashed complexes across the state.\nOf the 438 Southland complexes shunned by Fannie, the lion\u2019s share are in Los Angeles County, with 237. San Diego County has 98, Orange County 70, Riverside County 19 and San Bernardino County 14.\nFannie and sister organization\nFreddie\ndon\u2019t make loans, but buy roughly half of the country\u2019s home loans from lenders and package them to sell to investors, then guarantee payments on them, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nLoans that meet their underwriting standards can be cheaper, and require lower down payments than bespoke mortgages.\nAcross Southern California, condos have often served as an entry point to home ownership. Condo listings across the region jumped 61.8 percent this month to 7,781 units, compared with 4,809 a year ago, according to the Register.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Chicago retail magnate Fred Latsko is bringing a new buzz to Fulton Market, while also hanging onto his last one.\nHe expanded his hold on the city\u2019s market for cigar lounges with a store and private club called Chicago Cut that opened at 1003 West Fulton Street earlier this month, shortly after the landlord scored $22 million in fresh debt from New York-based Argentic Real Estate Finance, public records show.\nThe loan helps to refinance the 15,000-square-foot\nGuinness Open Gate Brewery\nsite at 901 West Kinzie Street, which Latsko owns and considered selling for over $20 million last year.\nHe elected to hang onto the property rather than sell it, after listing it with JLL brokers in October 2023. Latsko also put up some of his expansive Gold Coast retail holdings, at 23 West Maple and\n66 East Walton streets\n, as collateral for the Argentic loan. The former is leased to high-end convenience store chain\nFoxtrot\nafter that brand\u2019s revival from shuttering all of its stores last year. The Walton Street asset landed a 10-year deal with luxury consignment retailer TheRealReal a few months ago.\nChicago Cut joins Biggs Mansion, at 1150 North Dearborn Street in the Gold Coast, as another private cigar club within Latsko\u2019s portfolio. While Latsko renovated Biggs\u2019 interior 11 years ago, it\u2019s a historic building \u2014 constructed in 1874 for Northern Trust co-founder John Dekoven \u2014 that retained its classical look. The Fulton Market spot is meant to appeal to a more youthful crowd in the trendy neighborhood.\n\nLatsko paid $2.1 million to buy the Chicago Cut location in 2020. Its first level is a cigar shop open to the public, while the upper floors require memberships costing an initiation fee of $3,750 and then monthly dues of $375.\n\u201cWhy did I open Chicago Cut? More for the younger, more contemporary clientele of West Loop as another option,\u201d Latsko said. \u201cBiggs Mansion being a Chicago landmark located in the Gold Coast has the reputation as the finest cigar shop/club in the world.\u201d\nThe landlord\u2019s moves allowed him to partially pay down his previous\n$34 million loan\nfrom fellow Chicago-based real estate player Jeff Aeder\u2019s firm JDI that was levied against key properties in Latsko\u2019s retail portfolio, public records show.\nAdditionally, proceeds from Latsko\u2019s recent\n$17 million sale to the family behind Max Mara\n, as well as the refinancing of TheRealReal and Foxtrot properties, helped to pay down the JDI loan balance.\nLatsko, a lifelong Chicagoan, is also marketing a second home in West Palm Beach, Florida, for a little more than $6.2 million, and eyeing a residential purchase in the Los Angeles area. The Florida home spans 6,500 square feet with six bedrooms and seven bathrooms at 1017 North Flagler Drive, just off the waterfront with a view of nearby Palm Beach island. The property last sold for $3.2 million in 2021, and originally asked $8.9 million when first hitting the market in 2023. Suzanne Frisbie of the Corcoran Group has the listing.\n",

BP has held office space in the CME Center since 2009.\nMany office tenants downsized, relocated or went fully remote after the pandemic disrupted in-person work. The re-shuffling pushed landlords to scale up amenities to entice tenants.\nTishman has renovated the property\u2019s lobby, fa\u00e7ade and entrances while adding amenities such as a 24-hour fitness facility, 175-seat conference room, lounge and library.\n\nThe complex spans two 40-story towers totaling 2.3 million square feet. Other tenants include the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Wells Fargo, law firm Reed Smith and accounting services firm RSM.\nThe move was a win from the Loop, which has seen a flow of office tenants to the West Loop and Fulton Market seeking modern offices and loft style buildings converted from warehouse space over the past decade. Since the pandemic, the loop\u2019s office vacancy rate has been stuck around 30 percent.\nFulton Market is the only submarket in downtown Chicago with vacancy under 20 percent, and it also has the highest asking rents, averaging over $61 per square foot for Class A space. In the Central Loop, the vacancy rate is close to 28 percent, and average asking rents for Class A is under $50 per square foot.\nIt was also another boost for Tishman Speyer, which was on the brokerage side of\na recent lease expansion at 222 North La Salle\n. The firm represented the landlord, Henry Crown and Company, in a 15,700 square foot office expansion for fintech firm NinjaTrader.\n",

Farley also put his unit on the market in August 2023 with\nan initial asking price of $16 million\n, making it the second-priciest listing in the city at the time. Since then, the price on the 14th-floor home has been slashed nearly in half to $8.45 million.\nLurie\u2019s unit has three main formal rooms that span 63 feet, with views of Oak Street Beach and the near North Side lakefront.\n\nOriginally from Florida, Lurie moved to Chicago and worked as a pediatric intensive care nurse at Children\u2019s Memorial Hospital, later renamed to the Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital to honor her nine-figure donation.\nHer husband, Robert Lurie \u2014 real estate investor and business partner of billionaire Sam Zell \u2014 left a $425 million estate when he died in 1990. By 2012, Ann Lurie had given away $331 million to philanthropic causes, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nBeyond her support for the children\u2019s hospital, Lurie gave $60 million to Northwestern University and Northwestern Memorial Hospital. She also donated $5 million to the Greater Chicago Food Depository and $10 million to establish a 2.5-acre park downtown known as the\nLurie Garden in Millennium Park\n.\nAnn Lurie also invested in real estate, selling the family\u2019s lakefront Winnetka home for $5.5 million in 1997 and purchasing a Gold Coast mansion on Dearborn Street for just under $5.1 million in 1995. In 2017, she sold the Gold Coast home to the Latin School of Chicago for $12 million. Not all of her real estate ventures were successful, though. She bought an East Lake Shore condo for just under $4.7 million in 2007 and sold it a decade later for $2 million.\nLurie died last year at age 79 after she was diagnosed with a form of cancer called glioblastoma.\n",

        "content": "Data centers are not always welcomed with open arms in rural communities.\nBut some local leaders in Illinois area eager to overcome the facilities\u2019 environmental obstacles in hopes of generating property tax revenues and job opportunities, the Chicago Tribune\nreported.\nData center giant Equinix is working on securing approvals for a data center in Minooka, a rural community about 50 miles southwest of Chicago. The town\u2019s mayor, Ric Offerman, is helping push the project along.\nOfferman\u2019s encouragement joins a growing trend of data center development in Illinois.\nIn 2023, ComEd predicted a 40 percent increase in its electricity deliveries by 2040, primarily because of data centers.\nElectricity demand from data centers in Northeast Illinois alone is expected to triple as new leases and proposed data centers come on line, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield.\nOfferman joins other local leaders who are supportive of the proposals despite their environmental concerns.\nAbout 20 miles north of Minooka, the town of Yorkville has fully embraced the data center sector, city administrator Bart Olson said. The town recently approved its first 230-acre data center and has received interest from investors and data center companies and investors eyeing land totaling 3,000 acres.\nBack in Minooka, the Equinix project will cover 340 acres and require 700 megawatts of electricity a day. That\u2019s about the same amount of electricity needed to power half of the households in the city of Chicago.\n\nCooling the facility will also require 3 million gallons of water per day from a $1.54 billion pipeline currently under construction from Lake Michigan.\nMeeting those needs will pay off for Minooka, Offerman said, because the project will boost the town\u2019s property tax revenues and create hundreds of jobs.\nState environmental regulators will have a say in the project\u2019s approval.\n\u201cOne of the questions the state will ask is, is it really the highest and best use of a finite resource to use drinkable water to cool a computer?\u201d said Hugh O\u2019Hara, executive director of the Will County Governmental League.\nSome Equinix facilities overseas use \u201cgray water\u201d otherwise known as wastewater to reduce competition over drinking water. But the process and the regulations needed to accompany it have not been developed in the U.S. Equinix, which is based in California, operates 260 data centers in 33 countries.\nAn alternative option is cooling the data center with electricity, which presents its own challenges. Doing so could drive up electricity costs for residents and derail the state\u2019s goal to eliminate fossil fuel use for power plants by 2045.\nOfferman said he wants to help find a way to provide the water or energy needed to cool the plant and keep the project moving forward.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best use of that land except for farmland,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s much better than a hundred different things they could put there.\u201d\n",

The hotel could operate the hotel component slated for the 40-story mixed-use tower planned on the site, which is also approved for 350,000 square feet of office space, 275 apartments and retail.\nOn the South Side, developer Allison Davis, through his entity Aquinnah Investment Trust, is proposing to build a\n28-story, 250-key hotel property\nnear the almost complete Barack Obama Presidential Library, at 6402 South Stony Island Avenue.\nAnd in the Gold Coast, an investment group led by\nWheeling-based Marsha Forsythe\nacquired the historic 285-key hotel at 1301 North State Parkway, settling a\n2023 foreclosure lawsuit\nagainst its previous owner, a Gaw Capital affiliate, for allegedly defaulting on a $38.5 million loan.\n\nChicago multifamily landlords are\ntaking a political stand\nagainst the anti-gentrification ordinance that went into effect in Northwest Side neighborhoods and Pilsen this month. They\u2019re trying to rally support to stymie or overturn a rule that gives tenants the right of first refusal to buy apartment buildings imposed as part of the law, claiming that it could prevent sales from closing and deter investment.\nMeanwhile, lenders and landlords are still frustrated with each other at major Chicagoland properties.\nBank OZK\nwrote down an additional $17 million\nfrom its loan to Sterling Bay for its stalled Lincoln Yards project, ballooning the total to $38 million that the lender has charged off on its initial $128 million loan to the developer.\nItasca-based\nHamilton Partners\nis also aiming to get a suburban Downers Grove office debt back on track after it was sent to special servicer CW Capital with a $57 million remaining balance and an \u201cimminent\u201d default predicted. The landlord\u2019s co-owner in the property,\nAccesso Partners\n, is hesitant to contribute any additional capital to saving the deal as it already faces numerous legal and financial challenges with major Chicagoland real estate loans.\nStill, Bank OZK, a key construction lender, hasn\u2019t redlined the Chicago-area from putting new deals on its books. It led a\n$55 million construction loan\nthat included a $9.9 million mezzanine debt from an insurer to developer VennPoint Real Estate, which is led by Nick Marietti and aims to build 144 rental townhomes in Deerfield with the money.\n",

        "content": "Russ Burns, who began steering the massive Chicago-based construction, development and design firm Clayco when its founder Bob Clark was forced to step back for family reasons, died Thursday. He was 65.\nBurns spent 41 years as an executive at nationally renowned contractors, including the past 23 as president and CEO of Clayco. His death was confirmed by Clark, and the cause was cancer.\n\u201cHe and I were like Simon and Garfunkel. We had an amazing run,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWe could finish each other\u2019s sentences, and yet we were good at different things which is what made the partnership so strong.\u201d\nBurns was a part of Clayco\u2019s decision to move its headquarters from St. Louis to Chicago, where it maintains workspace in the historic Jeweler\u2019s Building at 35 East Wacker Drive. Clayco also recently opened a new office building in St. Louis that the firm named the Russ Burns Building.\n\u201cWe lost a great one in Russ. One of the most class acts of all time,\u201d said Shawn Clark, son of Clayco founder Bob Clark and the CEO of its real estate development arm CRG.\nThe elder Clark brought Burns on to run Clayco as its president in 2007, as Clark was unable to lead the business as normal following the diagnosis of his late wife Ellen\u2019s terminal illness around that time, according to Burns\u2019 LinkedIn profile and Bob Clark\u2019s blog.\nBurns\u2019 move to Clayco followed 21 years as an executive vice president for Turner Construction. He led a period of explosive growth for Clayco: in 2007 when Burns came onboard, the firm generated $700 million in revenue; last year it was about $8 billion, Clark said.\n\n\u201cWithin six to eight weeks of Russ coming to the Clayco office three days a week as a \u2018consultant,\u2019 it became apparent that everybody in the company was not only impressed with him but was also following him \u2014 including me,\u201d Clark wrote. \u201cHe had become the leader of all of us in very short order.\u201d\nAfter serving as Clayco\u2019s president for seven years, Burns\u2019 title became CEO for the past decade until he retired at the end of last year. Under Burns\u2019 direction in recent years, Clayco set itself up to help lead the data center boom now underway as artificial intelligence innovation and the economy\u2019s increasing reliance on cloud storage drive demand for computing power across the nation.\nBurns is survived by his wife Allison and son Tyler, said Bob Clark, who called Burns \u201cmy closest buddy, mentor, and the good angel on so many shoulders\u201d in a death announcement made Friday.\nThe CEO title was absorbed by\nClayco\u2019s Anthony Johnson\nearlier this year, following five years as president of the firm\u2019s industrial business unit that led to $3.6 billion in revenue from data center projects last year, half of its total.\n\u201cRuss taught us all to be better leaders, better bosses, better fathers, better husbands, and better humans,\u201d Johnson wrote on social media.\nEditor\u2019s note: This story was updated to clarify the amount of time Burns spent as CEO of Clayco.\n",

        "content": "Hamilton Partners scored a tenant at its Esplanade IV office building in Downers Grove, a win for the landlord as it scrambles to stabilize its troubled suburban office complex it co-owns with Accesso Partners.\nMatson Logistics, a transportation and supply chain company, leased nearly 21,000 square feet at 1901 Butterfield Road, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The firm will relocate from a 17,000-square-foot space at 1815 South Meyers Road in Oakbrook Terrace this August.\nThe deal was brokered by Colliers\u2019 Sven Sykes, Tom Volini and Brent Jacob for Matson, and Phil Sheriden for Hamilton.\nThe move boosts Esplanade IV\u2019s occupancy to 80 percent, according to CoStar, and reflects the \u201cflight to quality\u201d trend among tenants seeking modern offices to entice workers.\nThe lease follows a recent restructuring of the building\u2019s debt. Hamilton and Accesso struck a deal with lender Jackson National Life Insurance to cut their $30 million loan on Esplanade IV and neighboring Esplanade V to $19.6 million, extending its maturity to 2028.\nBut the landlords face a more urgent threat next door. Esplanade I, the 19-story, 536,000-square-foot anchor of the campus, is tied to a $69 million CMBS loan that was transferred to special servicing in February.\n\nHamilton, a minority owner, has\nbegun workout talks\nwith servicer CWCapital, but its larger joint venture partner, Accesso, has so far declined to reinvest, pushing Hamilton to shoulder turnaround costs and risk diluting Accesso\u2019s equity stake.\nAccesso is juggling distress elsewhere in its portfolio, having surrendered a Loop tower at 20 North Clark and facing a\n$75 million foreclosure at 200 West Monroe\n. Several of Accesso\u2019s suburban Chicago assets, some of which were purchased from Hamilton, ended up in\nforeclosure\n.\nAt Esplanade I, occupancy stands at 72 percent, but revenue has fallen below breakeven levels. Its former anchor tenant, Hillshire Brands, exited a 72,000-square-foot annex in 2023, and Hamilton is now targeting food processing tenants to backfill the space.\nMeanwhile, the building Matson is exiting in Oakbrook Terrace is struggling too. Its $19.3 million CMBS loan was recently transferred to special servicing after the loss of Matson and marketing agency InteQ.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

The land has been in the Wirtz family for six generations.\nIf any of those districts express interest, the district says it will pursue detachment of the site, citing the \u201cunsustainable financial burden\u201d of serving up to 940 new students it projects to enroll as Wirtz Realty Corporation\u2019s 3,600-home development is built out over the next two decades.\nThe suburb annexed the Ivanhoe Village land in late 2022.\nThe letter follows a\nrenewed round of talks\nearlier this month between the Wirtz family and local school leaders after negotiations collapsed in January.\nFremont officials say the Wirtz team recently offered a $3.8 million impact fee, while the district is seeking $90.1 million \u2014 about 75 percent of the projected cost of building a new school\u200b.\n\nThe district would be open to structuring a rebate program if tax revenue from the site proves sufficient over time, Fremont Superintendent Trisha Kocanda said. But she emphasized that Fremont doesn\u2019t have the space to serve the incoming students and can\u2019t wait until after they arrive to start building.\nMundelein officials pushed back, posting a statement disputing the district\u2019s enrollment projections and citing regional data showing enrollment has dropped more than 9 percent in the past five years, despite the addition of hundreds of new homes.\nThe letter drew mixed reactions from nearby districts.\nSome said they don\u2019t have the capacity to absorb Ivanhoe Village, while others are reviewing the proposal. The Fremont superintendent acknowledged the detachment plan is \u201catypical\u201d and would require creative redistricting but insisted the Wirtz proposal as it stands would unfairly offload school construction costs onto current residents.\nThe Wirtz family has not publicly commented on the school district\u2019s latest proposal. A previous plan for the village to vote on impact fee terms earlier this month was postponed to allow talks to continue.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

He began buying property in the tower in 2019.\nHe raised his concerns to the board\u2019s then-president \u2014 allegedly a vendor with a flooring company that does business with the building \u2014 but says they were dismissed.\nThe lawsuit alleges Dorneanu heard of misconduct by high-level employees from vendors and staff, and that after writing to Trump Inc. executives and other board members, a June 2024 internal investigation served more as a \u201ccover up\u201d than an address to his concerns.\n\nTrump Inc. later responded to Dorneanu, stating his claims were \u201cirrefutably not supported by facts,\u201d the suit says.\nDorneanu resigned from the board in August and claims building management retaliated by barring him from using amenities like the spa and health club in November. In February, he was arrested for trespassing after entering the building\u2019s spa steam room, an incident his lawsuit ties directly to his concerns.\nThe complaint does not list a specific dollar amount in damages, and neither Trump Inc. nor the condo board president has publicly responded.\nThe case adds to the list of legal disputes and financial woes that have plagued the Trump Tower since its completion in 2009. Those include a potential\ntax bill exceeding $100 million\nthat the Internal Revenue Service deemed was due to questionable accounting practices related to the property, and other claims that\nDonald Trump made false statements\nregarding a loan tied to the skyscraper.\nMeanwhile, a\nSeptember ruling by a Cook County judge\nfound the building\u2019s cooling water intake system has illegally drawn in and killed thousands of fish from the Chicago River for years, deeming the building a \u201cpublic nuisance.\u201d\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Sterling Bay\u2019s lender has lost more confidence in the developer\u2019s delayed Lincoln Yards plan as the developer is up against key deadlines to pay off big debts tied to the project.\nBank OZK, one of the nation\u2019s largest construction lenders, conceded that it\u2019s unlikely to be paid back another $17 million borrowed by Sterling Bay for the project, according to public disclosures the financial institution made earlier this year.\nThe move to write down a second big chunk of the $128 million loan that the Chicago-based developer took out in November 2019 follows Bank OZK last year making a\n$21 million chargeoff\nand placing the debt on substandard non-accrual status \u2014 a label denoting high risk of default.\nAfter the initial chargeoff, Sterling Bay made a $1.9 million payment to the bank last quarter to bring it current on interest payments, and it received another short-term extension of the debt\u2019s maturity date \u2014 it had previously received multiple maturity extensions, including one last year before the first writedown.\nWith Bank OZK\u2019s concession that $38 million is likely unrecoverable on the deal, and Sterling Bay\u2019s latest payment, the total loan balance was reduced to $88 million, according to the lender\u2019s public disclosures. The debt level was 72 percent of the property\u2019s appraised value as of June, the lender said, pegging the estimated market price for the land at about $122 million.\nDallas-based private equity firm Lone Star Funds partnered with Sterling Bay to buy the site encumbered by the Bank OZK loan as part of a 53-acre assemblage. The ownership venture spent $136 million in 2016 to buy the former A. Finkl &amp; Sons steel property that\u2019s subject to the loan, as the developer worked to solidify its grip on land along the Chicago River between Lincoln Park and Bucktown, public records show.\nLone Star and Lincoln Yards\u2019 other financial backer, JP Morgan Asset Management, has since sought to exit the project by selling its stakes in the land holdings at a discount. Those decisions sent Sterling Bay into the market for new capital partners, but it\u2019s so far been unsuccessful in its search for an investor willing to rescue the stalled project.\n\u201cWe all are committed to the transformative vision of Lincoln Yards and are in active discussions,\u201d Sterling Bay said through a spokesperson. Bank OZK declined comment and referred questions to the borrower.\n\nSterling Bay last year was cozying up to Los Angeles-based investment firm\nKayne Anderson\nas a potential investment partner, after\nChicago\u2019s teacher pension fund passed on Sterling Bay\u2019s courtship\nas the developer sought a $300 million infusion. But so far Kayne Anderson and other investors haven\u2019t entered the picture.\nBank OZK noted the land loan accounted for less than 1 percent of its total construction and land development loans.\nBut it\u2019s not the only deal the bank has with Sterling Bay within the vicinity \u2014 there\u2019s a second running up against its maturity date without any revenue coming in from the property at 1229 West Concord Place, Cook County records show. That\u2019s next door to Lincoln Yards, where Sterling Bay completed a 320,000-square-foot lab and office building aimed at life sciences tenants. Yet it hasn\u2019t been able to draw a tenant and remains fully vacant.\nThe landlord has a separate $125 million construction loan from Bank OZK that it needs to pay off or refinance by a mid-September maturity date, unless the developer scores another maturity extension from the lender.\nSterling Bay\nCEO Andy Gloor publicly blamed\nformer Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration for Lincoln Yards delays. He accused it of dragging its feet in approving a deal with a Wisconsin\u2019s Public Finance Authority plan that would have kickstarted infrastructure work on the development site.\nLightfoot rebuffed that take, instead claiming that Sterling Bay didn\u2019t bring the city into the discussion of the proposed financing deal until it had been fully negotiated, forcing city officials into a difficult position of verifying that taxpayers wouldn\u2019t be harmed. By the time the deal was ready to finalize, the economic environment shifted as interest rates rose, sinking a groundbreaking on infrastructure.\nSterling Bay also bought more time at its Fulton Market office building at 333 North Green Street after\nhaggling with another lender\nover a proposed paydown. The developer and its partner in that property, JP Morgan Asset Management, made a $19 million payment to their lender Wells Fargo to further extend the maturity date on a $230 million loan against the 553,000-square-foot building.\n",

Last summer, a judge had moved the deadline to March 31 for the sale of two of the city\u2019s largest hotels, at 333 O\u2019Farrell Street and 55 Cyril Magnin Street, respectively.\nThe judge also pushed out the lender\u2019s foreclosure deadline to July 15 if a sale wasn\u2019t completed by then.\nIn 2023, Virginia-based Park Hotels &amp; Resorts defaulted on a\n$725 million loan\ntied to both hotels.\nRusso\u2019s sale extension request states \u201cthe Receiver has made substantial progress on a sale of the hotels to a third party\u2026 and believes she will be in a position to file a motion to approve the sale imminently.\u201d\nThat aligns with this month\u2019s report on bondholders for the debt, which states a non-binding term sheet has been executed with the buyer, according to the Business Times. But the report does note \u201cmaterial terms\u201d are still being negotiated on the draft purchase and sale agreement.\n\n\u201cThere is still a risk that these material terms are not agreed upon and [the] receiver will not be able to close the sale,\u201d the report states.\nA bondholder report from early February said the debt\u2019s special servicer expected a deal would be finalized within 30 days, though that didn\u2019t happen.\nIn 2016, the properties were appraised at $1.56 billion, with an occupancy of 90 percent and revenue per available room of $217.\nThey\u2019ve since lost more than\n$1 billion in value\n, according to the Business Times. At the same time, their $553.6 million valuation last year from Kroll Bond Rating Agency \u201cis exceedingly generous,\u201d sources told the Business Times.\nLast year, the physically joined hotels had a $34 million net operating deficit, with a 12-month occupancy of 40.5 percent and revenue per available room at $96.24, a 56 percent drop in eight years.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Not anymore.\nTenants are vacating more offices than they\u2019re leasing, a trend since a broad shift to remote work during the pandemic.\nThis week, cybersecurity firm Okta listed more than 70,000 square feet of offices for sublease at 100 First Street, a 27-story office tower where it has leased 14 floors since 2017, an unidentified source told the Chronicle. It\u2019s the\nsecond time\nthe firm shed offices since 2021.\nAt the same time, an office shuttered by Indeed last year at 201 Mission Street also hit the market. The company has since pulled out of San Francisco, according to an unidentified spokesperson.\n\nOn a positive note, sublease availability in San Francisco fell 10 percent to 7.1 million square feet this quarter, from 7.9 percent last period, according to CBRE. The surfeit of offices available for sublease has decreased since the beginning of last year, when 8.9 million square feet were available.\nLandlords inked more than than 2 million square feet of office leases in the quarter ending March 31, 50 percent more than a year earlier, CBRE determined. But leasing activity so far this quarter fell 20 percent from last quarter, when owners leased out 2.5 million square feet.\nColin Yasukochi, executive director for CBRE\u2019s Tech Insights Center, said office vacancy dipped to 33.8 percent in the Financial District, from 34 percent at the end of last year.\nClass A office towers in the north and south Financial Districts were poised to have positive net absorption of 100,000 square feet, according to Colliers.\nDerek Daniels, director of research for Colliers, predicted the quarter will likely end with 2.7 million square feet of leases signed.\n\u201cThere is optimism for the office recovery to continue in 2025 considering increasing \u2026 leasing activity. It is expected that capital market activity will pick up as well,\u201d Daniels, referring to building sales, told the Chronicle. \u201cTrends in RTO [to-office] point toward an increasing in-office presence for some of the city\u2019s largest occupiers.\u201d\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

And California Forever, backers of a proposed city in Solano County, wants to help build them.\nThe Fairfield-based firm backed by Silicon Valley billionaires has proposed a shipyard on 1,400 acres near Collinsville, where the Sacramento River ends in tidal Delta estuaries, the\nSan Francisco Business Times reported\n.\nSupporters say the shipyard could take advantage of tax credits and federal infrastructure funding from an executive order Trump is expected to sign this week. His \u201cMake Shipbuilding Great Again\u201d order calls for an overhaul of the U.S. maritime industry,\naccording to USNI News\n.\nRio Vista Mayor Edwin Okamura\nposted on Facebook\nthat he and the city manager had met with retired military leaders, county officials and representatives from California Forever to discuss the proposed shipyard.\n\u201cWe are very early in the process, and are working with elected officials and local communities to explore how we can best use these assets to support American Sailors and stimulate economic growth in our cities, county and broader region,\u201d an unidentified California Forever spokesperson said in a statement.\n\u201cBringing this industry back to Solano County will require all of us to work together on this generational opportunity.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s order calls for creating an Office of Shipbuilding, which he said would \u201cresurrect\u201d the American shipbuilding industry and provide tax incentives to\nbring it \u201chome to America.\u201d\n\u201cWe used to make so many ships,\u201d Trump said this month. \u201cWe don\u2019t make them anymore very much, but we\u2019re going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact.\u201d\n\nIt could also impact plans by California Forever, whose controversial proposal to build a utopian city of 400,000 residents on secretly bought farmland\nstalled last summer\nafter a county report said the project that was to have gone before voters last fall \u201cmay not be financially feasible.\u201d\nA ballot initiative had been slated to go before Solano County voters in November, but was pulled last July after months of poor polling and public skepticism. California Forever now plans to go before voters next year, after agreeing to cooperate with county officials on an environmental impact report.\nIn January, Suisun City\nvoted to consider annexing California Forever\u2019s land\n, shifting part of the development from county to city land in an end-run around\nvoter approval requirements\n.\nThe shipbuilding proposal is also expected to be met with strong resistance from the project\u2019s opponents, who already have voiced concerns over the environmental impacts of the plan, according to the Business Times.\nThe California Forever spokesperson said the shipbuilding operation falls in line with a 1989 county study that identified the southern Montezuma Hills as the \u201clargest vacant site on the West Coast currently approved for heavy industry or marine terminal use, and the only one in California of more than a few hundred acres.\u201d\nThe county supervisors zoned more than 1,400 acres for maritime industrial uses in response, and included the industrial designation in its 2008 general plan. California Forever said Solano County is uniquely positioned to rebuild the country\u2019s naval power, developing shipbuilding, ship repair and related maritime industries.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "San Francisco\u2019s commercial market saw some signs of life this week, with two new artificial intelligence leases and the welcome news that San Francisco finally ditched its last-place return-to-office ribbon.\nFor the first time since\nPlacer.ai began tracking office visits\nin the early days of the pandemic, San Francisco has\nbested\nanother major U.S. city in RTO figures. The city had 47.5 percent fewer office visits in February 2025, compared with the pre-Covid month of February 2019, while Chicago saw a 48.5 percent decline in the same time period, according to Placer.ai office data.\n\u201cThere are green shoots everywhere in San Francisco, and these numbers are an early indication that we are moving in the right direction,\u201d Mayor Daniel Luire, who\nrecently set an April 28 deadline\nfor city workers to be in-office four days a week, told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cOur administration is leading by example, and many of our partners in the private sector are on the same page, bringing workers back to the office and kickstarting our downtown recovery.\u201d\nSan Francisco Chief Economist Ted Egan cautioned that Placer.ai\u2019s data \u201cshows a lot of volatility\u201d from month to month, and is just one indicator of RTO strength. But combined with other data points, like increased transit ridership and office demand, it adds up to \u201cgood news for the city\u2019s continuing economy recovery,\u201d he said.\nThere were 2.2 million square feet of office leased in San Francisco in the first quarter of 2025, according to early data from CBRE, slightly less than the fourth quarter of 2024 but 50 percent higher than the full first quarter of 2024. If San Francisco continues on this leasing trajectory, it will exceed the 8 million square feet leased in all of 2024, according to Colin Yasukochi, executive director of data for CBRE.\nThere were about 5 million square feet of office requirements in the first quarter, which is lower than previous quarters, but represents the highest level of company expansions since the pandemic at just over 20 percent of the total. Almost all of that demand is coming from the 30\nAI companies\nwhich are seeking a combined 1 million square feet of office space in the city, Yasukochi said.\nTwo AI firms sign leases at 501 Second Street\nThe Swig Company scored some of that coveted AI attention, announcing\ntwo leases\nwith AI firms this spring.\nLangChain, an open-source framework for building applications using large language models, is taking 11,800 square feet in the seven-story 200,000-square-foot former warehouse, while unitQ, an AI-enabled product quality and user experience analytics platform, has signed on for 7,500 square feet.\nBlake Walker and Caroline O\u2019Loughlin Livermore of CBRE represented LangChain. Walker said LangChain would be moving into a furnished space, which \u201cminimized disruption\u201d so they could focus on their business and give their team \u201can office they enjoy coming into.\u201d\n\u201cThe decision to move to 501 Second Street was driven by favorable economics, term flexibility, and a high-quality workspace that supports their growing team,\u201d he said.\nCory Kristoff, Swig\u2019s director of leasing, said in a statement that the company was happy to welcome \u201ctwo San Francisco-based enterprises advancing the application of artificial intelligence in business\u201d and that it looked forward to \u201csupporting their future growth.\u201d\nDistress at SF\u2019s biggest apartment complex\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t all good news for the city this week. San Francisco\u2019s largest apartment complex, Parkmerced,\nwent into receivership\nafter owner Maximus Real Estate Partners defaulted on nearly $1.8 billion in loans.\nA court appointed the San Diego-based Douglas Wilson Companies to serve as a receiver for the 152-acre, 3,221-unit complex at 3711 19th Avenue, south of San Francisco State University.\nDouglas Wilson, founder of his eponymously named company, said its goal will be to safeguard Parkmerced and work toward its \u201crepositioning.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been lacking capital for some time,\u201d Wilson told the Business Journal. The company is considering bringing in a new property management firm.\nMaximus had proposed redeveloping the World War II-era garden apartments by adding 5,700 homes, 230,000 square feet of shops and restaurants, 80,000 square feet of offices and a 64,000-square-foot community center.\nAlthough redevelopment plans were approved in 2011, and\nnew renderings put out\nin 2022, the project never broke ground, with Maximus founder Rob Rosania citing \u201csky-high construction costs, inflation and supply chain issues.\u201d\nMajor overhaul of Jay Paul\u2019s CityView plans\nIn the South Bay, Jay Paul Company announced a\nnew plan\nfor its CityView development in downtown San Jose, swapping out some office buildings for an office-to-residential conversion, a brand new residential tower and retail.\nOriginally plans called for three 19-story, interconnected office towers containing 3.4 million square feet of offices, shops and restaurants. The company\nasked the city for a five-year pause\non that plan last year, citing \u201ccurrent financial markets and a reduced demand for office leasing.\u201d\nNow downtown San Jose\u2019s biggest office owner is moving forward, but with a new vision for a mixed-use community with a large residential component, plus office, retail and restaurants, according to a news release from the company.\n\u201cDemand for older Class B and C office space at this site has declined, while the need for housing in San Jose continues to grow,\u201d company President Jay Paul told\nThe Real Deal.\n\u201cRight now, multifamily development is delivering stronger returns than aging office properties, making residential conversion an attractive proposition.\u201d\nIn a statement, San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan called the project \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d for its ability to help the city \u201creimagine what the capital of Silicon Valley looks and feels like in the age of AI.\u201d\n",

Or the mostly vegetarian grub at the once-anticipated food court nearby.\nSaluhall, a food hall anchored by an\n87,000-square-foot IKEA store\nat 945 Market Street, has sputtered,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported\n.\nNearly a year ago, the two-story food court\nopened\nto great fanfare, with\n11 vendors\ndishing out mostly vegan and vegetarian fare.\nOnly seven will soon be left.\nDownstairs, Saluhall has closed two of its proprietary food outlets. Upstairs, two independents are moving out, leaving two unfilled vacancies, according to the Chronicle.\nThe problem: a lack of business, Raul Medina, the chef-owner of Taqueria La Venganza, who recently\nannounced\nhis vegan taqueria would be pulling out, told the Chronicle. \u201cWe hardly made money this year,\u201d he said.\nSaluhall, with one new vendor in the works, has placed all its hopes on a public relations push \u2014 hiring locally based AF&amp;Co to promote the food court.\nIdeas include ads highlighting individual vendors. Or events like college basketball championship watch parties. Painting parties featuring drinks. Collaborations with the nearby Warfield Theater. Or its \u201cdrag bingo brunch\u201d and a Monday trivia night.\nToo little, too late, Medina said. \u201cThe things they\u2019re doing now are things they should have done since the beginning,\u201d he told the Chronicle.\nSaluhall, planned before the pandemic by IKEA\u2019s parent company and real estate arm, Ingka Centres, drew heavy hopes for a downtown revival, where\n37 percent\nof the city\u2019s offices are dark. As\nThe Real Deal\nreported, San Francisco had\n47.5 percent fewer\noffice visits last month, compared to February 2019, before the pandemic.\n\nDining options spotlighted vegan dishes, developed in a partnership with the cofounder of famed restaurant Noma. Some of those original vendors are gone, replaced by others.\nSaluhall management did not provide any specific visitor counts, which it measures by footfall counters and other data services.\nKayma owners Mounir Bahloul and his wife Wafa take turns serving Algerian dishes like shakshuka, spiced fries and bowls of couscous.\nLike Medina, Bahloul said the first couple of months looked promising. But come summer, hype over the new buzzy food hall died down. Sales slowed to a crawl. \u201cCompared to that high point, my sales are down 70 percent,\u201d Bahloul told the Chronicle.\nBahloul partially laid the blame on poor public safety in Mid-Market, which has driven pedestrians away from the hall. Even if there is security inside, he feels it makes no difference if there isn\u2019t a critical mass of customers. \u201cIf there\u2019s no foot traffic, there\u2019s no sales,\u201d he said.\nA month after the food hall opened in April, Ingka Centres emailed San Francisco police and the nonprofit Urban Alchemy to complain about dire street conditions around IKEA, specifically near the garage.\n\u201cVisitors are refusing to park in our building because of Stevenson Street conditions. This is also resulting in loss revenue daily,\u201d the Ingka Centres representative wrote, citing damage to exit doors from urine and feces, as well as alleged arson and trespassing.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also had incidents where people are refusing to move for vehicles to drive as well as people completely on drugs sleeping in the middle of the road.\u201d\nA slew of stores across San Francisco have closed, citing street conditions. A year after it opened a flagship store in Mid-Market, Whole Foods closed its doors in Mid-Market to\nprotect the safety\nof its employees.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Alexandria Real Estate Equities has revealed how it wants to turn a 54-year-old indoor mall in San Bruno into a life sciences research village with 1,000 homes.\nThe Pasadena-based life sciences developer unveiled plans to redevelop the 44-acre Shops at Tanforan mall at 1122 El Camino Real,\nthe San Francisco Business Times reported\n.\nThe real estate investment trust plans to raze the nearly 970,000-square-foot mall and replace it with 1.8 million square feet of tech and life sciences research offices and 1,000 homes.\nIf approved, the project could turn the area into a high-density, transit hub \u2014 with three life sciences buildings built within a retail village of shops and restaurants, a revamped movie theater, a public market, a 63,000-square-foot Target department store, homes and open space.\nA Tanforan Central Market, with soaring walls of glass, sits under a shed roof next to a verdant glade full of residents and visitors, according to a rendering.\nOf its 1,000 homes, 200 would be set aside as affordable. Alexandria is working with Strada Investment Group, a San Francisco-based developer, which has entered talks with two affordable housing developers. Strada expects to select a partner this year.\nIn early 2022, Alexandria\nbought the mall\nfor\n$328 million, or $338 per square foot\n, according to the San Jose Mercury News. Its days as a traditional mall may be numbered.\nThe redevelopment project, now under environmental review, could be approved by November, with mall demolition to follow. Alexandria is still sketching out its retail plans.\n\nWhat was once known as the Tanforan Park Shopping Center opened in 1971 with two anchor stores, replacing a historic race track used as an internment camp for Japanese Americans during World War II.\nIn January, anchor JCPenney announced it would\nclose its 275,400-square-foot anchor store\n, accelerating its redevelopment.\nSan Bruno sees Tanforan\u2019s redevelopment as a way to bring jobs and housing to a key corridor. The city must plan for 3,100 new homes by 2031.\nThe mall\u2019s location next to the San Bruno BART station makes it an ideal site for workforce housing for teachers and other workers. Many lower-income workers in the county struggle to afford housing, forcing them into long commutes, according to city officials.\nThe life sciences component may be more of a gamble. The life science sector is coming out of a four-year slump, with only\nthree properties trading hands\nnationwide in the first nine months of last year.\nIn the quarter ending in June, the Bay Area\u2019s once-booming 41.5 million-square-foot life sciences market was\n24.6 percent vacant\n, according to CBRE.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "A South Financial District office building is heading to foreclosure after its Marin County-based landlord defaulted on a $21 million loan on the property last year, according to court filings.\nJonathan Parker, a principal of Monahan Parker, told\nThe Real Deal\nhe still hopes to hang on to the six-story, nearly 70,000-square-foot building.\nParker said he has presented the servicer \u2014 Beacon Default Management, formerly known as Rialto Capital \u2014 with \u201cmultiple offers from third-party buyers at or above the loan amount, as well as loan extension proposals wherein we would maintain ownership.\u201d\nBut those efforts have all been rejected by the lender, U.S. Bank National Association, due to additional interest and default fees that the CMBS bondholders have been unwilling to renegotiate, he said.\nThe total amount owed, including interest and fees, is $24.7 million, according to a foreclosure notice filed on Feb. 25. The owners have 90 days from the filing before a foreclosure sale can take place.\nEfforts to \u201cresolve the purchase or refinancing of the property are ongoing,\u201d Parker said.\nBeacon referred comment to legal counsel for the lender, which said in a statement that it is \u201ccommitted to engaging with borrowers to find the best possible resolutions. At the same time, we expect these sophisticated commercial borrowers to honor the commitments they have made.\u201d\n\nMarin-based Monahan Parker is a partnership between Parker, who is also a filmmaker, and Tom Monahan, president of Monahan Pacific, which owns office, residential and mixed-use properties, primarily in San Francisco and Marin.\nParker, through his land-use attorney, said that he was the minority owner in the building, and that it represented \u201cone of hundreds of buildings in San Francisco that is a victim of the work-from-home trend.\u201d The city only recently\ngot out of last place\nfor return-to-office figures, according to cell phone data analyzed by Placer.ai.\nMonahan Parker bought the 1907 building, which was expanded in 1925, for $11 million in 1998. Built in the aftermath of the 1906 quake, it had been vacant since it was damaged by the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989. After a major seismic retrofit and new interior finishes that wrapped up in 2000, the owners took out a $21 million interest-only loan with Natixis Real Estate Capital, a subsidiary of French bank Groupe BPCE, in 2013, according to loan documents. That loan was then packaged with others into a commercial mortgage-backed security pool in 2014. At the time, the property was 100 percent occupied and worth $34 million, or about $400 per square foot.\nBut by March last year, the value\nhad dropped to $20.7 million\n, according to Morningstar analysis. The most recent appraisal from the end of August shows an even lower value of $16.3 million. Interestingly, as of Sept. 30, 2024, the property was 92 percent occupied, according to Morningstar, after holding steady at 71 percent from the end of 2022 to the end of 2023.\nA Cushman &amp; Wakefield marketing site for the property shows two available suites: the entire 11,200-square-foot second floor, which is asking for $60 to $64 per square foot annually, and half of the ground floor, which does not have an asking rent listed. If those listings are up to date, that would put the property at about 78 percent occupancy.\nAverage asking rents in the South Financial District were $78.54 in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to Colliers data, and the neighborhood was showing an availability rate of 32.1 percent. That\u2019s a slightly lower availability rate than the city\u2019s 35.5 percent overall rate, and a slightly higher asking rent than the overall average of just under $70.\n",

        "content": "A Houston-based developer cleared a major hurdle in its plan to convert a struggling office building into apartments in northwest San Antonio.\nSan Antonio City Council unanimously approved a zoning change last week allowing Woodbranch Management to redevelop one of two office properties at 8401 Datapoint Drive, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n. The approval enables the firm to build 60 residential units per acre at Highpoint One, while Highpoint Two will stay office space. The site spans 13.5 acres, according to city documents. The planned number of units and construction costs haven\u2019t been disclosed.\nWoodbranch acquired the site in 2023 after the previous owner\u2019s bankruptcy left Capital One searching for a buyer to recover $53 million in debts. Woodbranch ultimately secured the property as its ground lease owner.\nCity staff recommended denying the zoning change, but the Zoning Commission pushed it forward, as the council has shown willingness to be flexible in increasing housing density citywide.\nThe project will bring needed housing to the San Antonio Medical Center, said council member and mayoral candidate Manny Pelaez, whose district includes the site.\nThe council\u2019s vote set development restrictions, capping new structures behind Highpoint One at six stories and limiting heights near neighboring condos to minimize impact.\n\nA construction timeline hasn\u2019t been disclosed.\nState lawmakers are considering legislation that would\ntoss rezoning requirements\nfor commercial properties to be converted into housing. The proposal by Sen. Bryan Hughes would apply to municipalities within the 13 Texas counties that have populations exceeding 420,000, along with cities within those counties that have over 60,000 residents.\nThis project is one of a few office-to-residential developments planned in San Antonio.

Jeffers &amp; Company, to redevelop the 31-story Tower Life building at 310 South St. Mary\u2019s Street with 243 mixed-income apartments. The 95-year-old building, designed by Ayres &amp; Ayres, will have retail space at the River Walk level.\nThe office-to-residential conversion trend has legs, especially in cities where demand for housing is rising and older office spaces are getting left behind. Developers increasingly view conversions as financially viable solutions to address the surplus of vacant office properties and the ongoing housing crisis, with nearly 71,000 units in the\noffice-to-resi conversion pipeline nationwide\n. However, it\u2019s not a silver bullet, as not all office buildings are suitable for conversion due to structural limitations and potential high costs of conversion.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

        "content": "The Irving City Council approved a zoning change for Las Vegas Sands\u2019 proposed resort near the former Texas Stadium site Thursday, but without the casino or nightclub elements that drew public backlash.\nIn back-to-back 6-3 votes, the council passed a version of the proposal stripped of gambling and nightlife uses after Sands\u2019 request to remove those elements just hours before the meeting, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nThe decision follows\npublic outcry and heated planning meetings\n, including one in late February, when the proposal first went before the City Council and more than 170 residents signed up to speak, most in opposition.\nSands executive Mark Boekenheide, who oversees the company\u2019s global real estate, told council members the company wasn\u2019t walking away from the project \u2014 but that\nwithout legalized gambling in Texas\n, a full $4 billion casino resort wasn\u2019t financially viable.\nSands might still pursue hotel development on the 182-acre site, which the company acquired last year, Boekenheide said.\nThe resort project previously included plans for a 15,000-seat arena expected to serve the Dallas Mavericks, which is co-owned by Sands\u2019\nrecently elevated CEO Patrick Dumont\n, along with hotels, retail, restaurants and entertainment venues.\n\nCritics of the project raised concerns about gambling addiction, public safety and the impact on the city\u2019s family-friendly character. Representatives from the University of Dallas, whose campus borders the proposed site, were among those opposing the plan.\nSome council members voiced frustration that Irving continues to lose major development opportunities. The council ultimately stopped short of banning gambling from the zoning ordinance entirely, leaving the door open for it to return if gambling is legalized in Texas.\nThe revised approval sets the stage for Sands to build a non-gaming resort in Irving, though whether the company moves forward without casino revenue remains an open question.\nTo add gambling back into the plan in the future, the zoning would need an amendment. More crucially for the original project plan\u2019s viability, a statewide vote on a constitutional amendment is required to legalize casino gaming in Texas.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

White Lodging, which owns 11 other Austin hotels, is marketing its portfolio for multi-venue bookings to try to fill that gap.\n\nThe renovation will focus on the hotel lobby, bar and restaurant. Dripping Springs-based firm Nuvu Interiors ATX is the designer. The hotel is home to Corner Restaurant, which features Southern cuisine, and Dean\u2019s Italian Steakhouse.\nThe hotel is just two blocks from the Austin Convention Center and features more than 120,000 square feet of meeting space. The hotel claims to offer the largest guest rooms in the city and includes amenities like an on-site spa and a rooftop pool with views of Lady Bird Lake.\nIn addition to the renovation, White Lodging is adding to its Austin portfolio with Hotel Trinity, an Autograph Collection hotel it\u2019s developing in partnership with REI Real Estate. The 13-floor, 258-key property will be located at Trinity Street and East Fifth Street, also near the convention center.\nDespite adding nearly 16,000 rooms between 2016 and 2022, Austin\u2019s hospitality market is thriving, with an occupancy rate of 67.4 percent, ConnectCRE reported, citing data from Marcus &amp; Millichap. The market also saw a 4 percent increase in average daily rate for luxury hotels.\n",

The asking price pencils out to $786 per square foot.\nThe 10,800-square-foot home sits on a little under an acre in the Tall Timbers section of River Oaks, just north of the Highland Village shopping center.\nMike Mahlstedt of Compass Real Estate listed the property, while Laura Sweeney, also with Compass, represented the buyer. The buyer and seller weren\u2019t identified.\nDesigned by Eubanks Group, the residence features European architectural elements, including loggias, gardens and terraces. The interior showcases centuries-old reclaimed materials, such as antique doors, a 17th-century double-faced stone fireplace, reclaimed terra cotta tile floors, antique wood beams and imported limestone flooring, according to the listing. The home underwent renovations in 2022 and 2023.\n\nAmenities include a pool, pavilion with an outdoor kitchen and dining area, and a three-car garage with guest quarters above. The home has five to six bedrooms, six full bathrooms, and two half-baths.\nAnother home among the top 10 most expensive sales this month was 4018 Meadow Lake Lane, located just across the street from 19 West Lane. Mahlstedt also listed that home, which was priced at $3.09 million and sold for between $2.87 million and $3.31 million.\nThe luxury market in Houston is thriving, and demand for\nhigh-rise condos\nis evident with developments like the St. Regis and Ritz-Carlton branded condo projects underway. Despite challenges such as fewer high-end listings and competition from Dallas, the ultra-luxury segment has shown resilience, with home sales over $10 million surging significantly.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

However, the distinctive and highly visible mushroom house, built in 1997 and designed by Dallas architect Tom Workman, isn\u2019t of great concern to preservationists.\nWhile it does have architectural value, its modern style and exposure on an arterial street make it less viable for preservation.\nRather, they are more interested in preserving the 1920s Tudor-style home on Bordeaux, designed by architect Hal Thomson.\nMany historically and architecturally significant homes have been demolished in Highland Park over the past two decades, but even the wealthiest Dallasites don\u2019t always get their way.\nBillionaire banker Andrew Beal demolished Highland Park\u2019s historic Cox Mansion, but he put his request for rezoning to build a five-story house\non hold\nafter pushback from community members who feared it would set a precedent.\n\nCar dealership owners are frequent buyers of luxury real estate and often have second lives in commercial real estate.

Its owner, tied to Houston-based Kalkan Capital, has not made a payment on the $54 million loan since June. The complex entered special servicing for loan default in October.\nThe lender is dual-tracking foreclosure, simultaneously pursuing a foreclosure process while continuing negotiations with the borrower, according to servicer commentary cited by Morningstar.\nKalkan Capital, founded by Fercan Kalkan, has been connected to other distressed multifamily properties, including the Village at Piney Point, where it faced\na $73 million foreclosure attempt\nfrom Fannie Mae in August. That case was delayed after a minority equity partner sued to block the sale, accusing the lender of \u201cmanufactured technical defaults\u201d to force a takeover.\n\nKalkan was also connected to a group of assets involved in a $384 million foreclosure auction last November.\nThe extent of the storm-related damage to Palm Beach Estates is unclear; the servicer noted that capital repairs are underway.\nThe property, a Class-C complex built in 1976, was one of many Houston multifamily properties affected by the severe weather last year, which caused widespread power outages, fallen trees and property damage.\nThe U.S. multifamily distress rate is second only to office properties, according to Cred iQ, as elevated interest rates and rising insurance costs squeeze landlords \u2014 especially in storm-prone regions like Houston.\nOthers still have struggled to recover after declines in occupancy and rental rates in Houston\u2019s multifamily market, recently including New York-based Nord Group, whose $38 million loan backed by La Solera Apartments in the southwest Houston suburb of Alief was\nsent to special servicing\nin February.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "The owner of the last penthouse to sell at 520 Park Avenue is having buyer\u2019s remorse.\nThe buyer, identified as Park Ave. Condo LLC, filed a lawsuit against the property\u2019s developers, William Lie Zeckendorf and Arthur Zeckendorf, after purchasing Unit DP-PH-63 for\n$78.9 million in November\n.\nThe buyer claimed that the Zeckendorfs knew of an impending skyscraper that was \u201call but certain to ruin the Penthouse\u2019s unobstructed Central Park view, the unit\u2019s defining feature.\u201d\nThe offending skyscraper comes from Extell Development\u2019s Gary Barnett,\nwho bought three 60th Street lots from Solil Management\nfor $103 million earlier this month. The assemblage is next to 655 Madison Avenue, where Extell had already\nplanned a 62-unit residential tower and commercial space\n.\nThe buyer alleges in the complaint that Extell and Solil had made \u201csecret plans\u201d to develop a skyscraper that covers the entire assemblage and \u201cwill tower over 520 Park Avenue.\u201d\nDesperate times\nThe buyer alleged that the Zeckendorfs were privy to this non-public information because of \u201ctheir status as part of a small circle of New York City real estate insiders,\u201d and did not disclose it because of their desperation to offload the penthouse at a good price.\n\nThe complaint cites the Zeckendorfs\u2019 failed efforts to sell a\nformer triplex in the building\n\u2014 which was later subdivided into the duplex \u2014 for $130 million, and the years the resulting duplex spent on the market as the motivation to sell the penthouse at the maximum possible price.\nThe complaint also references the Zeckendorfs\u2019\nlawsuit against Los Angeles Angels owner Arte Moreno\n, who backed out of buying a unit at 520 Park Avenue, as evidence of the developers\u2019 \u201cdesperation\u201d to sell other units in the building.\nThe offering plan does disclose that west-facing windows on apartments, including the original triplex, are \u201cconsidered amenities that can potentially be lost,\u201d and also includes a general disclosure that \u201cno representation is made that future construction in the neighborhood surrounding the Property will not result in obstruction of views.\u201d\nBut the buyer claimed that none of the 26 amendments to the plan included a disclosure suggesting the west-facing windows faced a \u201cspecific, existing risk of obstruction.\u201d\nThe buyer is suing the Zeckendorfs for fraud and is seeking to rescind the sale, in addition to any other potential damages.\nA representative for the Zeckendorfs and lawyers for the buyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

The firm is buying 24 acres near 1500 South Riverfront Boulevard, just outside of downtown, with plans to build an $800 million resort. The seller was Lewisville-based development firm Matthews Southwest.\nTherme expects to spend $500 million on construction and $300 million on design fees and interest.\nIt still has to get planning and zoning approval from the city; it also plans to apply for incentives. The resort could generate $1.8 billion in tax revenues over the next 30 years and would create more than 1,000 permanent jobs, Therme US\u2019s John Alschuler told the outlet.\nThe Dallas location could open as early as 2030.\nIt will include a 450,000-square-foot facility with baths, saunas, a waterpark and restaurants. Georgetown Company owns a 25 percent stake in Therme US and plans to build a hotel on the site, too.\n\nAlschuler said day passes at the facility would cost about $60.\nCedars neighborhood association president Kirk Jordan visited Therme\u2019s Bucharest facility and has voiced support for the project, which he said would be \u201ctransformative\u201d for the area.\nTherme recently announced plans for a similar resort in Washington, D.C. It already operates two facilities, in Romania and Germany.\nThe land buy comes less than a year after the\nopening\nof WorldSprings, a 10-acre outdoor resort with 46 mineral pools. The $32 million facility is located in the Colony.\nNorth Texas has become a hotspot for experiential developments, with the $520 million PGA Omni Frisco leading the charge. Peppa Pig Theme Park recently opened in North Richland Hills. Universal Kids Resort is on deck to open next year in Frisco. Wisconsin-based Kalahari Resorts &amp; Conventions announced plans for an Allen waterpark resort earlier this year.\n",

CBRE will also oversee the office buildout.\nGranite Park 6 was completed in 2023, and the lease brings it to 58 percent occupied. It features amenities such as a market caf\u00e9, fitness studio, golf simulator and conference centers. The 422,000-square-foot building has recently attracted five companies, including a major insurance brokerage and Atlantic Aviation, totaling 126,000 square feet in new leases.\nSimpson Strong-Tie\u2019s decision to establish a second headquarters in Collin County was influenced by the area\u2019s strong labor market and proximity to its manufacturing facility in McKinney. Its office will house key departments and function as a co-headquarters alongside its base in Pleasanton, California. The company aims to relocate 55 office employees by the fourth quarter and plans to expand its local workforce to 300 employees over the next decade.\n\nThe Plano City Council is set to vote today on an $800,000 economic development incentives agreement supporting the company\u2019s move. The proposed deal requires the company to occupy at least 38,130 square feet, employ 50 local workers, and complete $5.3 million in renovations by December 1.\nPlano\u2019s youthful office market is benefiting from the flight-to-quality trend of employers exiting older office buildings for amenity-filled new construction or renovated spaces.\nRecent leasing deals include Sally Beauty\u2019s\nheadquarters relocation\nto 140,000 square feet at 7900 Windrose Avenue in Plano\u2019s Legacy West.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

        "content": "The owners of a Soho penthouse are suing Tal Alexander and Official Partners for allegedly defrauding them of roughly $400,000.\nThe lawsuit, filed in New York on Monday, accuses the former top agent, the brokerage he co-founded and his client, entrepreneur Daniel Fine, of lying about Fine\u2019s finances and deceiving the owners into renting their apartment at 54 Thompson Street to him.\nThe lease \u201cwas and continues to be a con-job disaster,\u201d the complaint states.\n\u201cOur client was shocked to discover that the then-respected Official Partners had conspired against its own client in order to gain a commission,\u201d Christopher Milito, an attorney for the plaintiff, wrote in a statement. \u201cOur client was defrauded and damaged by this group of unprincipled individuals.\u201d\nThe lawsuit adds to a growing list of complaints against Alexander and his brothers, Oren and Alon Alexander, who have been in custody since their arrest on\nfederal sex trafficking charge\ns in December. Along with dozens of civil sexual assault claims against the brothers, Tal and Oren, who co-founded Official, are\nfacing a lawsuit\nfrom the backer of their company, white-label firm Side, over an allegedly unpaid loan.\nIn the complaint, the plaintiff \u2014 an entity that appears to be tied to a mortgage firm executive \u2014 claims Alexander and Fine \u201clied, falsified bank documents and covered each other\u2019s bad acts\u201d to present Fine as a reliable renter.\nHowever, once the lease began, the complaint alleges Fine \u201cimmediately failed\u201d to meet the $45,000 per month rent and utility charges, racking up a six-figure outstanding balance. It accuses Fine of renting out the space for parties and for allowing others to sublet the unit.\nThe lease, which Fine signed through his company, FineCo, is in place until May 2026.\n\u201cIt does not appear that Fine ever resided in the apartment himself, as was the understanding,\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys wrote. \u201cInstead, FineCo and Fine have used the apartment to generate income for themselves without paying Plaintiff its justly-due rent.\u201d\nFine and attorneys representing Alexander and Official Partners did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe duplex penthouse last traded in 2021 for $12.3 million to an LLC linked to Tri Minh Nguyen, CEO of Network Capital, and Hung Nguyen, according to mortgage documents filed in the city register.\nAbout two years after buying the apartment, the owners started searching for a renter for the property, initially seeking $60,000 a month when it hit the market in April 2023, according to a Streeteasy listing.\nThe property history shows the owners tapped Official Partners, including Alexander and Nicholas Lounsbury, a former Official agent and defendant in the lawsuit, to find a tenant last March, though the complaint states they were hired the year prior. The complaint accuses Alexander and the brokerage of doing \u201clittle to market the apartment to the general public.\u201d\n\nInstead, court documents state Alexander offered Fine, described as a friend and in similar social circles, as a prospective tenant. Among the application materials submitted by Fine was a bank statement from JP Morgan showing he had more than $4 million in his account.\nThe owners claim they voiced concerns about Fine\u2019s credit score and his reported businesses.\n\u201cThe \u2018medical app\u2019 in Fine\u2019s biography appeared to be an iPhone app touting itself as a \u2018Cannabis Cooking Calculator\u2019 for \u2018Perfectly dosed edibles.\u2019 SetScale appeared to be a small, internet-based factoring lender,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cAnd a 710 credit score for the intended occupant of a $45,000 a month apartment was unusual.\u201d\nThe owners allege Alexander and Lounsbury instead pushed them to focus on the bank statement, which proved Fine had enough cash to meet the hefty rent.\nNow, they\u2019re claiming that document was forged, and that Alexander and Lounsbury knew it was a fake.\n\u201cDespite the knowledge of the fake Account Statement, Alexander, Lounsbury and Official urged Plaintiff to rely on it as evidence of FineCo\u2019s ability to pay rent for the Apartment,\u201d the complaint states. The defendants \u201curged this reliance in order to earn a leasing commission, which was paid by Plaintiff to Official.\u201d\nThe lawsuit, which seeks more than $150,000 in damages, includes allegations of fraud, aiding and abetting fraud and breach of contract.\nLounsbury did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAfter a decade at Douglas Elliman, Tal and Oren co-founded Official with three other partners in 2022. The firm quickly cemented itself as one of the leading brokerages in luxury markets such as New York and South Florida and later\nexpanded to the West Coast\nand\nAspen, Colorado\n.\nThe firm\u2019s early success halted last summer, after\nThe Real Deal\nfirst reported on sexual assault allegations levied against Tal, Oren and Alon. Tal and Oren initially stepped back from their roles at Official, but later\ntook control of the brokerage\nafter their co-founders exited.\n\nMost, if not all, of Official\u2019s agents have since left the firm, which is likely not operating, as Oren and Tal have been in a Brooklyn federal jail since earlier this year.\nSide sued Official and the Alexanders\nlast year, alleging they failed to pay back a $5 million loan it provided for them to launch their business. A California judge issued a temporary injunction barring the brothers from offloading or concealing assets used to collateralize the loan, a move the brothers are appealing.\nTal, Oren and Alon\u2019s federal sex trafficking trial is slated to begin in January 2026. Oren and Alon are also\nfacing state charges\nin Miami-Dade County; that trial could start as early as May.",

        "content": "Miami-Dade\u2019s housing czar Alex Ballina is leaving his government post to cash in on demand for affordable and workforce developments across the Sunshine State,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nHe recently formed Florida Development Building Group, or FDBG, a firm that will use \u201cdata driven insights and data-backed strategies to focus on projects for essential workers in underserved markets throughout Florida,\u201d Ballina told\nTRD\n. He will step down as director of Miami-Dade Housing and Community Development next month.\n\u201cI did a great job at the county, but the timing is right to go do my own thing,\u201d Ballina said. \u201cI know the blueprint for doing these types of projects.\u201d\nFDBG will focus primarily on workforce housing projects that take advantage of Florida\u2019s\nLive Local Act\n, Ballina said. The state law incentivizes developers with density and height increases, tax breaks and other sweeteners if they designate a portion or all of their residential units in a project for affordable and workforce housing. Local governments are required to administratively approve Live Local projects.\nIn a memo on Monday to the county commission, Miami-Dade Mayor\nDaniella Levine Cava\nannounced the departure of Ballina and Miami-Dade Innovation and Economic Development Chief Francesca de Quesada. Levine Cava did not provide any further explanation about their reasons for leaving.\n\nNathan Kogon, the housing department\u2019s assistant director, will lead the county agency on an interim basis while Levine Cava\u2019s administration conducts a search for a new permanent chief, the mayor\u2019s memo states. Her spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\u201cWe are going to miss Alex,\u201d said county commissioner Elieen Higgins, whose district includes downtown Miami and Brickell. \u201cBut I think we are in good hands with Nathan.\u201d\nBallina accepted the county housing director job in 2023 after working 11 years as an executive for\nResia\n, a Miami-based multifamily development firm. Prior to Resia, Ballina was an assistant director for the Miami-Dade housing department, overseeing maintenance and upkeep for housing complexes.\nWhen he took on the top job, Ballina replaced Michael Liu, a former federal housing official who was hired in 2014 to run Miami-Dade Housing and Community Development. Liu resigned eight years later after clashing with Levine Cava, and he now works as a strategic adviser for Coconut Grove-based developer\nMichael Swerdlow\n.\nUnder Ballina\u2019s watch, the county housing department \u2014 in\u00a0 partnership with developers \u2014 completed more than 25 affordable and workforce housing projects with over 6,000 units, Ballina said. \u201cWe reorganized and streamlined a lot of our processes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe catapulted development of affordable housing and unlocked a lot of stuck deals.\u201d",

        "content": "Sales of several $30 million-plus Atherton homes by the same builder \u2014 Pacific Peninsula Group \u2014 may \u201creset the ceiling\u201d for the nation\u2019s most expensive zip code, according to luxury San Francisco Peninsula agents.\nOn Feb. 18, Atherton notched its first $30 million-plus sale recorded in the multiple listing service for 2025: 112 Almendral Ave sold for $33.5 million to Amberhill Trust, according to the deed. It was a custom built by Pacific Peninsula Group for the previous owner, former Altera CEO John Daane, after he and his wife Linda bought the 1-acre parcel for $8 million in 2018, according to deed records and city permits.\nCompass agents Mary and Brent Gullixson listed the property and did not confirm the identity of the buyer or the seller, but Brent said that the custom home\u2019s high price speaks to \u201cthe buyer\u2019s desire to buy a new home in order to avoid the time it takes to build.\u201d\n\u201cWith such a low number of new homes in the pipeline, prices for new construction have reached a new high,\u201d he added.\nAt the end of last year, Pacific Peninsula Group quietly sold 358 Walsh Road for $36 million, according to San Mateo County records, the biggest sale in the infamously expensive community in 2024 and close to an all-time Atherton record. The buyer was 358 Walsh LLC, a Delaware-based entity.\nThe developer was also behind the sale of another $30 million-plus Atherton build \u2014 63 Santiago, which sold for $32.4 million in October to Santiago Avenue LLC, another Delaware-based entity.\nPacific Peninsula Group did not respond to emails and calls for comment. At both the Santiago and the Walsh properties, the buyers\u2019 agents and identities are unknown.\nThe current record for a single residential sale in Atherton reported to the MLS is\n233 Park Lane\n, which sold for $40 million in 2023 and was built by Pacific Peninsula Group for the owners, who ended up selling it with everything included down to the linens. Gap co-founder Doris Fisher also sold two parcels of her long-time Atherton estate\nfor a combined $48 million\nto one buyer in 2024.\nPacific Peninsula Group\nbought a different 2-acre parcel of the Fisher estate\nfor $15 million last year as well. Permits to demolish the existing residence were approved before the property even closed escrow. Permits for a new main residence, pool house and detached garage were approved in August.\n\nMichael Repka of DeLeon Realty represented the seller on the Park Lane sale as well as the seller in a 2023 deal where Pacific Peninsula Group bought a 2.5-acre estate for $25 million and said the company understands the formula for building houses that ultra-luxury buyers want, with strong resale value.\n\u201cPPG is an exceptional builder, but they are also exceptional business men,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are consistently able to command a premium over builders that are less in touch with the market.\u201d\nSales like these \u201creset the ceiling\u201d in the Atherton luxury market, he added.\n\u201cOnce you have a few high-priced sales of this nature it is easier to get others to fall into that price range,\u201d he said.\nCompass agent Omar Maissen, the co-listing agent on\nAtherton\u2019s most expensive listing\n, agreed that a few very high-end sales can help move the needle on the market because they help buyers feel like $30-plus-million prices are reasonable.\n\u201cBuyers seek the comfort of knowing they are not the first to the dance and this provides a great springboard to boost confidence in the market,\u201d Maissen said of the recent Pacific Peninsula Group sales.\nRepka said, in general, the Atherton market has seen a \u201cdramatic uptick\u201d in activity from international buyers in the ultra-high end, especially Chinese buyers. This includes buyers from Hong Kong and mainland China, he said, though they typically already have a presence in Atherton and are looking for move-up properties.\nCompass agent Tom LeMieux said the Peninsula had a relatively flat year overall in 2024, especially compared to the run-up in prices during the pandemic. But the upper end of the market, spurred by international buyers and the tech sector, has been seeing more sales. In 2023, he said, the only sale over $30 million in Atherton was the Park Lane sale. But in 2024, there were six, he said, including the ones on Santiago and Walsh.\n\u201cFor some of these very choice areas or these larger lot opportunities or, in the case of 358 Walsh, these newer, highly amenitized homes, it does speak to the demand we have for that in our market recently,\u201d LeMieux said.\n",

        "content": "Rent-stabilized distress, long tied to local banks, is now hitting CMBS.\nThe impact underscores that pains are radiating, exposing a new crop of investors to potential losses.\nIn the past two years, the distress rate for securitized New York multifamily loans has more than doubled to 14.4 percent, according to Kroll Bond Rating Agency data recently reported by Trepp\u2019s CRE Direct. Distress, per Kroll\u2019s definition, designates a delinquency or special servicing stay.\nNotably, 90 percent of the $1.8 billion in New York multifamily debt is tied to properties subject to some sort of rent restriction, according to CRE Direct.\nThe distress rate for apartment properties built before 1974 \u2014 when most rent-regulated units came online \u2014 is 25 percent, further highlighting the ties between rent stabilization and financial trouble.\nCitywide, rent-regulated buildings have suffered since the 2019 rent law severely suppressed revenues. To make matters worse, inflation and rising interest rates stoked expenses.\nNow, more owners are failing to fend off delinquencies and defaults. Some have succumbed to the struggle, selling off assets at\nincredible discounts\nor trying to toss keys back to lenders\nrefusing to play catch\n.\n\nBut as the downtrend crystallized, it was largely New York City bank lenders bearing the blow: Signature Bank failed, New York Community Bank narrowly avoided collapse and NYCB\u2019s recent rebrand, Flagstar Financial, is still\nscrambling to cut\nor cure its\nrent-stabilized debt\n.\nData showing rent-regulated CMBS deals are struggling signals the wider crisis isn\u2019t just a mom-and-pop problem. The big dogs that lean on securitized debt are suffering, too.\nThe $540 million senior mortgage tied to Meyer Chetrit\u2019s\nYorkshire and Lexington Towers\nat 305 East 86th Street and 160 East 88th Street, respectively, is one example.\nThe buildings, which are\u00a0a little less than half rent-stabilized, landed in special servicing last year after Chetrit and co-owner Stellar Management made a series of late payments.\nThe loan was marked current in March by Morningstar Credit. The deal\u2019s cash flow, however, cannot cover its total debt, which includes about $175 million in mezzanine financing.\nThe sponsors bought the buildings in 2014 and planned to renovate the overwhelming majority of their rent-stabilized units, aiming to boost rents by 20 percent, according to CRE Direct.\nThe 2019 rent law decimated such strategies.\n",

The home was\noriginally listed for $55 million\nin 2022 before going through a series of price chops until its last asking price of $37 million, at which point it was taken off the market last summer.\nThe co-op, which is feet from Central Park, has five bedrooms, multiple wood-burning fireplaces and a dining room that seats 30. The couple, who bought into the building in 2004 for $25 million, renovated the apartment with the help of French designer Robert Couturier.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Serena Boardman and Maria Bazo had the listing.\nThe buyers appear to be Rajaram Rao and his wife Anjuli Rao. In 2006, Rajaram founded infrastructure investment firm Global Infrastructure Partners, which was acquired by Blackrock in exchange for $3 billion in cash and 12 million shares.\n\nThe initial asking price may have been trying to take advantage of a historic sale that took place in the building just months prior, when a pair of co-ops owned by Paul Allen, the late Microsoft co-founder,\nsold for $101 million\n, the most expensive co-op transaction in New York history.\nJulia Koch, wife of the late billionaire David Koch, was the buyer of the two homes.\nThe discounted sale continues a string of co-ops in high-profile buildings unable to hit their initial asking price.\nKoch herself sold her\n18-room co-op at 740 Park Avenue for $45 million\n, a 25 percent discount from the reported $60 million she sought back in 2022.\nGrace Hightower, the ex-wife of Robert De Niro, didn\u2019t even try and make a profit on her co-op at 88 Central Park West, listing it for $20 million last year, slightly under the $20.9 million she and her former husband paid for it in 2006. The\napartment sold for $18 million\nin March.\n",

The $500-plus million phase one calls for 500 workforce housing units and 500 student housing beds in two eight-story buildings, new basketball courts, a turf field and academic facilities.\nMiami-based Kobi Karp Architecture &amp; Interior Design is expected to design the project.\nIncluding future phases, the project could exceed well over $1 billion, Burstyn said.\nMcCormick called the deal with Redwood a P3-plus, which he described as an enhanced public-private partnership centered around a ground lease with Redwood.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new model,\u201d McCormick said. \u201cWe want to be able to replicate this, and help universities replicate this.\u201d\n\nThe university was \u201cwiped of its debt years ago when Trump was in office,\u201d Burstyn said, referring to the CARES Act, which\ngave $1 billion\nto Historically Black Colleges and Universities and minority-serving institutions.\nConstruction could begin next year. Burstyn said each building would take about 18 to 24 months to construct.\nNew academic facilities will boost FMU\u2019s biology, music and cybersecurity training programs, according to a press release. McCormick plans to increase enrollment to more than 2,000 students, up from the current 1,300.\nMcCormick said providing affordable housing for professors, teachers and staff will help the university recruit, and offering more housing for students will boost enrollment. Since the pandemic, South Florida has become one of the\nmost unaffordable housing markets\nin the country.\n\u201cWe interview great people for key positions, but the relocation, they can\u2019t afford it, even on a great salary,\u201d he said.\nRedwood will handle the financial and development aspects of the deal. Burstyn said the arrangement is similar to its\nredevelopment\nof the Claude Pepper Park property in North Miami, which is a public-private partnership with the city.

The buyer was a joint venture between Terranova and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investing.\nAcadia joins a wave of institutional investors and real estate firms scooping up South Florida shopping centers.

One firm from Oakland promised a complimentary dinner at the Pasadena Hilton.\nBut nowhere is the stampede more apparent than on social media.\n\u201cWe are here to help,\u201d one firm\u2019s Instagram ad said.\n\u201cYou may be entitled to compensation,\u201d said another ad from an L.A. ambulance chaser.\n\u201cStart your 30-second eligibility quiz,\u201d said a Florida-based marketing agency, Legal Claim Assistant, which doesn\u2019t even list an attorney associated with it.\nJennifer Gray Thompson, CEO of After the Fire USA, a nonprofit that has worked in Lahaina, Paradise and other communities ravaged by wildfire, pointed out the potential exploitation.\n\n\u201cThe ick is real, and it feels very predatory,\u201d she told the Times. \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s a feeding frenzy off of people\u2019s trauma and suffering.\u201d\nBillions of dollars could be on the line for those who lost homes, businesses or loved ones in the flames.\nPacific Gas &amp; Electric paid a settlement\nof cash and stock valued at $13.5 billion to victims of the 2018 camp fire and other blazes. As part of negotiations for the landmark PG&amp;E payout, the state set up a fund in 2019 for future victims of fires caused by utilities, which now holds about $13 billion but can pay out up to $21 billion, according to the Times.\nWhether SoCal Edison sparked the Jan. 7 blaze remains to be confirmed by investigators. The\u00a0 county of L.A. and scores of Altadena residents have already sued the utility, accusing it of causing the inferno.\nCompany records uncovered by The Times\nshow that Edison knew some of its towers near the fire\u2019s epicenter were fire hazards.\nLawyers, who typically take no upfront cash, often require a one-third cut. The payout of a future settlement could be enormous.\nThe Eaton fire around Altadena destroyed\nmore than 9,400 structures\nand\nclaimed 17 lives\n. Its victims will battle the region\u2019s richest utilities, armed with an army of attorneys and savvy political operators.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of people who think this is a gold rush and are trying to sign up everyone and their brother,\u201d said John Manly, an Orange County lawyer known for representing sex abuse victims against USC, UCLA and the Catholic Church. \u201cThere are good firms advertising, and that\u2019s OK.\n\u201cBut when someone comes from Rhode Island and says, \u2018I\u2019ll do your wildfire case in California,\u2019 be suspect.\u201d\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Stephen Ketchum\u2019s real estate debt fund has set its crosshairs on a suburban Chicago office deal gone wrong under the direction of landlord Stanton Road Capital.\nAn affiliate of Ketchum\u2019s New York-based firm Sound Point Capital sued this week to foreclose on a $19.9 million Deerfield office building loan to Stanton Road, the owner of\n1751 Lake Cook Road\nin the northern suburbs.\nThe landlord is a commercial property investment firm that owns several Chicago-area office buildings. Founded by Timothy Ronan, Stanton has offices in Southern California and Park City, Utah.\nSound Point\u2019s foreclosure filing splashes the 214,000-square-foot Lake Cook Road property into a deep pool of distressed suburban office assets, including several others in Deerfield and nearby suburbs that have similarly sunk deals involving the owners of major downtown Chicago buildings.\nWith vacancy rates exceeding 30 percent in suburban Chicago office and elevated interest rates eating into property values established before the pandemic, even some of the biggest names among commercial real estate investors have fallen into trouble with their lenders.\nThe Deerfield office is one of at least three Stanton owns in the Chicago area, with the others at\n200 South Michigan Avenue\nin the city and at 1933 West Butterfield Road in Downers Grove, a western suburb.\nWhile Stanton\u2019s ownership of those two properties remains intact, it\u2019s under threat in Deerfield, where Sound Point claims the landlord stopped making principal and interest payments in January on its nearly $20 million loan originated in 2018.\n\nThat was when Stanton paid previous owner James Campbell Company $18.7 million for the property, with the extra $1.2 million in debt it took on beyond the purchase price from Sound Point likely meant to cover renovations and leasing costs, such as broker commissions and tenant improvement allowances.\nRonan and other Stanton leaders didn\u2019t return a request for comment, and a lawyer for Sound Point declined to comment.\nIn addition to Stanton\u2019s alleged default triggered by missed loan payments starting early this year, Colliers has filed a lien for more than $289,000 claiming that it has gone unpaid for property management services it\u2019s performed at the property.\nThere\u2019s also a Colliers lien of more than $229,000 filed in 2023 against the Stanton entity that owns 200 South Michigan in Chicago that also appears unresolved, public records show.\nAmong the other foreclosure lawsuits targeting Deerfield office buildings is embattled investor\nShaya Prager\u2019s Opal Holdings\n, which is facing a lender\u2019s attempt to strip its ownership of the Corporate 500 office campus on Lake Cook Road for allegedly defaulting on a $106 million loan against the property.\nElsewhere, Chicago-based\nBaum Realty Group\u2019s David Baum\nis linked to the buyer of a distressed loan note for a Deerfield office building facing foreclosure that\u2019s owned by Ameritus, owner of a Wacker Drive office tower. And in nearby Bannockburn, the Larry Krueger-led\nWanxiang America Real Estate\n\u2014 an owner and investor in several huge Chicago properties \u2014 is facing a foreclosure of a 134,000-square-foot building burdened by a $15 million loan with a $12 million remaining balance.\n",

        "content": "Longfellow Real Estate Partners and PGIM have spun a roulette wheel around plans to build an 84-acre life sciences workspace hub in Redwood City, betting on a market rebound within five years.\nThe Boston-based developer and New Jersey-based investor filed revised plans to\u00a0 redevelop the 84-acre office campus at 800-3800 Bridge Parkway and 900-1300 Island Drive, in Redwood Shores,\nthe San Francisco Business Times reported\n.\nThe developers drew up slightly smaller plans for the project known as Redwood Life: Evolve, calling for 2.8 million square feet of life science offices and research labs, with more open space between surrounding neighborhoods. The wider buffer was created in response to local opposition.\nThe life sciences market, faced with a glut of offices and labs and diminished funding, has been fighting to emerge from a\nfour-year slump\nthat led biotech companies to cut thousands of jobs, shed real estate and crimp their drug development pipelines.\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s read the headlines about the supply and demand of life sciences in the Bay Area, but we are very bullish,\u201d Peter Fritz, managing director of Longfellow, told the outlet. \u201cThis is a compromise with the community.\u201d\nThe previous plan, designed by St. Louis-based HOK Group, called for 13 buildings from 55 feet to 100 feet tall with\n3.1 million square feet of offices across 90 acres\nalong the Belmont Slough.\nThe new plan\u2019s environmental review is expected to proceed through next year. Pending approvals, the project would likely break ground in five years, executives say. The project was to include a 104-room hotel, a 46,000-square-foot conference center with a food court and outdoor terrace, and 47 acres of green belts, parks, amphitheaters, athletic courts, lawns and gardens.\nParking garages beneath the buildings would serve more than 7,000 cars.\n\nIt was to replace a campus, built during the 1990s, containing 20 two-story, cookie-cutter buildings with 1 million square feet of offices surrounded by parking lots north of the Redwood Shores Lagoon. It\u2019s home to such life science firms as Nevro, Procept BioRobotics and Jasper Therapeutics.\nIt\u2019s not clear if the latest plans by Longfellow and PGIM, the investment management arm of Prudential Financial, include the hotel and conference center.\nThe vacancy for life sciences properties across the Bay Area in December hovered around 29 percent, nearly four times higher than five years ago, according to market research by the Business Times.\nJoel Marcus, founder of major life science landlord Alexandria Real Estate, recently told Wall Street analysts that government approvals for new drugs, vaccines and treatments remain strong \u2014 a positive sign for biotech firms and life sciences projects.\nFritz, of Longfellow, also remains upbeat about the industry\u2019s long-term potential.\n\u201cThis hiccup has been a capital markets challenge,\u201d he told the Business Times. \u201cThe innovation never stopped. We are still in the early days of biomedical research.\u201d\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "A former AT&amp;T corporate dormitory complex in Irving could soon be demolished to make way for a high-end multifamily development, marking another major transformation in the city\u2019s real estate landscape.\nChicago-based Amli Residential requested a zoning change to redevelop the 13-acre site at 6201 Colwell Boulevard. The proposal includes 406 units spread across six apartment buildings and four townhome-style structures. Irving City Council is expected to vote on the request next month.\nThe site, adjacent to Dallas-based AT&amp;T\u2019s Advanced Education Center, houses 304 dorm-style units across 12 three-story buildings, along with a pool, tennis courts and a basketball court. AT&amp;T vacated the property in 2023 and intends to sell it to Amli. Details of the deal haven\u2019t been disclosed.\nThe site sits across from the 290-acre former Exxon Mobil headquarters, which Austin-based office investor Capital Commercial Investments\nbought in 2023\nwith plans to attract another corporate headquarters.\n\nAmli\u2019s plans for the community include a sports court, pocket parks and a 4,000-square-foot clubhouse. The project would expand the firm\u2019s Dallas-Fort Worth portfolio, which includes 12 apartment complexes. The developer is also undertaking a major project in Addison, where it is replacing the\nMidway Square Shopping Center\nwith a 570-unit apartment complex.\nFounded in 1980, Amli Residential is owned by Prime Property Fund, a real estate investment vehicle managed by Morgan Stanley. If approved, the Irving project would continue the trend of converting outdated corporate sites into modern residential hubs, catering to the region\u2019s demand for rental housing.\nPopulation growth and economic development are driving demand for apartments in DFW. Historic deliveries since the pandemic leveled the playing field between landlords and renters, with many complexes offering rent concessions. However, development is easing up, and analysts are expecting rent growth to kick back up in the next couple of years.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

        "content": "A data center development is in the works on Chicago\u2019s Near South Side, as Lincolnshire-based developer Scott Greenberg moves forward with adaptive reuse plans on land he\u2019s owned since 2020.\nThe $40 million privately funded project will transform a truck-trailer parking lot site at 2500-2540 South Wabash Avenue into a 76,000-square-foot data center catering to research institutions, universities and government agencies, Block Club\nreported\n.\nThe two-story facility was previously zoned for a 108,000-square-foot esports stadium, but\nGreenberg\u2019s $30 million plan for that fell through\n. Greenberg has owned the land eyed for the data center since 2020, when he paid a total of nearly $7 million across two different transactions for the properties.\nThe increasing demand for data centers is driven by the rapid growth of artificial intelligence and cloud storage needs, which require substantial computing power and infrastructure.\nChicago has 94 data centers, including Digital Realty\u2019s massive South Loop center. However, data center expansions have faced pushback from residents concerned about noise and environmental impact. They use massive amounts of power and clean drinking water.\nThe data center story is different in\nrural Illinois\n, though, where municipalities and residents are more likely to trade negative environmental impacts for jobs and property tax revenues.\n\nGreenberg\u2019s data center redevelopment will include seven backup generators enclosed in noise-reducing housing and a high fence for privacy.\nGreenberg also owns nearby production studio SMASH Virtual at 2617 South Wabash, and aims to integrate community amenities into the data center project. Plans include a 1,500-square-foot coffee shop on the ground floor, which will be offered to a tenant at cost, with no base rent, to encourage a local business presence.\nThe project, led by Gensler Architects, Terra Engineering, Power Construction and Thorton Tomasetti, is expected to employ 15-20 people.\nA construction start date has not been set, but the project has an estimated 18-month completion timeline.\nGreenberg is a longtime Chicago-area real estate player whose holdings also include the 310-key hotel at\n201 North State Street\nin the Loop.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

        "content": "Bob Myers, the ESPN analyst and former general manager of the Golden State Warriors, has sold his Presidio Heights home for $12.6 million, according to public records showing a closing date of March 14.\nMyers and wife Kristen bought the 6,300-square-foot six-bedroom, four-bath and two half-bath home at 200 Laurel Street in April 2016 for $10.275 million, more than $1 million over its $9 million asking price, according to property records and listing notes from the time.\nThe turn-of-the-century Queen Anne Victorian had been renovated by the previous owners shortly before they sold to the Myers, but it still maintains \u201ctimeless architectural elegance\u201d with \u201csoaring ceilings, intricate millwork\u201d and grand public rooms, according to the listing notes from Sotheby\u2019s International agent Janet Schindler.\nSchindler declined to comment on the sale, citing a non-disclosure agreement. She listed the home for $12.9 million on January 22 and it was in contract on February 21, according to Redfin.\nMyers, who grew up in the Bay Area, was the GM for the Warriors from 2012 to 2023, during a stretch in which the team won four NBA championships and he was twice voted NBA Executive of the Year. He was also the Warriors\u2019 President of Basketball Operations for the last seven years of his tenure.\nWhen he stepped down, he told ESPN, \u201cIt\u2019s just time.\u201d ESPN announced he would be joining its \u201cNBA Countdown\u201d pre-game show as an analyst later that year, a role he served again during the 2024-2025 basketball season. Last year he also became a consultant for the NFL\u2019s Washington Commanders.\n\nThe buyer was Mapache Listo LLC, which was represented by Tyler Stewart of Heath Real Estate.\nStewart declined to name her clients, citing security and privacy concerns, but said that they already had a home in Presidio Heights and a very narrow area that they were looking at for a larger home amid extremely limited inventory.\n\u201cIn this specific location, which is essentially a four-block radius, you get maybe one house a year,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when those houses come up, it is obviously a very lovely home, but it\u2019s really location driven.\u201d\nThe buyers also liked that the property is located on a corner lot and has big windows to let in a lot of light, Stewart said. Even though the last renovation took place ten years ago, she said they weren\u2019t planning on doing work. There was competition on the home, she said, but ending up at a price of $2,000 per square foot is \u201caverage for this sort of home in this location, so I think they felt really good about that.\u201d\nThough this house sold quickly at near asking, Tyler said there\u2019s been \u201ca little bit of turbulence\u201d in the market this spring because of the uncertainty in the national geopolitical and economic situation. Buyers are out there, but are also a lot pickier than they were during the height of the pandemic market in 2021 when \u201cif it had an address, it sold.\u201d That means she\u2019s written offers for hundreds of thousands over the asking price on homes that had eight offers on them this spring, while other properties are just sitting.\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that there\u2019s a steady trend going on right now,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems to be way more property-specific.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Four years later, the lien sale is back.\nNearly one year ago, with very little fanfare, the City Council reauthorized the controversial program through 2028.\nThe next one is slated for May 20, the first since December 2021.*\nFor the uninitiated: Properties end up in the lien sale when they have long-overdue property taxes and/or water and sewer bills. This debt is sold to a private trust, and then the trust can move to foreclose if the owner is not ultimately able to pay up.\nWhen the Council reauthorized the sale, it also made several changes to it, including creating the \u201cEasy Exit\u201d program, which allows certain one- to three-unit and condo building owners to have their property removed from the lien sale up to three times within 36 months. Owners can also opt for foreclosure and have their property transferred to an approved nonprofit. In those cases, the owner is guaranteed a 99-year affordable lease in the building.\nThe City Council is still trying to figure out how to revive another controversial but defunct program:\nThird Party Transfer\n. TPT hands over delinquent and distressed properties to a temporary owner who prepares them for sale, at which point they are converted to affordable housing.\nDuring a budget hearing on Tuesday, Bronx Council member Pierina Ana Sanchez stressed the importance of reviving the program.\nSanchez\nproposed\na bill to reform the program last year, but the Council and the Department of Housing Preservation and Development are still negotiating what the new version of TPT will look like.\n*H/t to Brick Underground for first\nspotting\nthe date for the next lien sale.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nAre you working on or considering any Universal Affordability Preference projects?\nSend a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: We knew this was coming, but the City Council\u2019s conservative Common Sense Caucus and other groups are filing a lawsuit challenging the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, alleging the text amendment violates city and state environmental review laws.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\n\u2014\nCouncil member Justin Brannan, who is running for City Comptroller, wants the city to divest from Tesla Holdings,\nGothamist reports\n. The investment is worth an estimated $1.2 billion. \u201cElon Musk is coming for us,\u201d Brannan told Gothamist. \u201cWhy should we be investing retirees\u2019 hard-earned pension funds in a guy who\u2019s already shown that he\u2019s got New York City in the crosshairs?\u201d\n\u2014\nThe city\u2019s Administration for Children\u2019s Services says it needs $1 billion in state funding to keep a program running that provides free or discounted childcare for tens of thousands of New Yorkers\n,\nthe New York Times reports\n. The state budget is due April 1, and the city agency says that an extended delay in its passing could result in vouchers going unfunded. The agency currently subsidizes more than 60,000 vouchers using state funding.\n\u2014\nA former senior prosecutor says that Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, who asked a federal judge to dismiss charges against Mayor Eric Adams, told another prosecutor to shred notes taken during a meeting about the possibility of dropping charges against the mayor,\nReuters reports\n. Former Manhattan U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon, who resigned rather than seek a dismissal of Adams\u2019 case, emailed herself a draft letter to Bove that detailed her reasons for resigning and mentioned his shredding directive. The email became public in court filings on Tuesday. Bove denied that he had instructed any materials to be shredded.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Tuesday was\n$37 million\nfor a roughly 7,000-square-foot co-op unit at 4 East 66th Street in Lenox Hill.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$13.4 million\nfor a 133,765-square-foot, 145-unit residential apartment building at 9704 Fourth Avenue in Bay Ridge.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$19 million\nfor a 5,000-square-foot townhouse at 246 West 12th Street in the West Village. Christopher Riccio and Elana Zinoman of Douglas Elliman have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 40,260-square-foot, nine-story, 51-unit residential building at 449 Jackson Avenue in North New York. Nikolai Katz filed the permit on behalf of Hershy Silberstein of Blue Shine Builders.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "State fire officials have released the first fire hazard maps for Southern California in 14 years, outlining where wildfires are most likely to occur in the coming decades.\nThe maps, published Monday, come after the ashes have cooled on the January wildfires around the Pacific Palisades and Altadena, which burned more than 12,000 homes, highlighting the urgency of wildfire preparedness,\nthe Los Angeles Daily News reported\n.\nThe maps, developed by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Cal Fire, project the probability of wildfires across eight counties over the next 30 to 50 years.\nThey also indicate where stricter fire-resistant building codes apply and where residents must adhere to brush clearance regulations. Local governments can use the maps to guide planning decisions.\n\u201cI see them as an educational tool to let people know the potential hazards in an area,\u201d Brad Weisshaupt, assistant fire chief for Los Angeles County, told reporters from the Orange County Register and Riverside Press-Enteprise. \u201c[It can] help inform decisions when working on their house and what they plant around their house.\u201d\nThe maps cover parts of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Imperial, Mono and Inyo counties, where local fire departments oversee fire protection. They supplement maps\nreleased earlier this year for Northern\nand Central California.\nCompared to the previous maps, released between 2007 and 2011, the new versions categorize areas into three fire hazard levels: moderate, high and very-high. These classifications are based on factors such as vegetation, terrain, fire history and local weather conditions.\n\nHomeowners in high and very-high fire zones will face increased responsibilities.\nState building codes require fire-resistant roofs, double-pane windows and ember-resistant vents in newly constructed homes. Landscaping rules mandate the maintenance of \u201cdefensible space\u201d within 100 feet of structures, with strict vegetation control within 30 feet.\nSome communities, including Los Angeles and Orange counties, conduct annual brush inspections, with non-compliance resulting in fines of up to $500.\nAdditionally, real estate laws require sellers to disclose if a property is in a high-risk fire zone and confirm compliance with defensible space regulations. The state Board of Forestry is also drafting new regulations to create an ember-free \u201cZone 0\u201d within 5 feet of structures, prohibiting flammable materials like wooden gates and bark mulch.\nThe revised maps show a statewide increase in high-risk fire zones, to 1.4 million acres from 800,000 acres. However, insurance rates are unlikely to be affected, as most insurers rely on their own risk assessments.\nOfficials hope the updates will enhance wildfire awareness and encourage proactive measures to mitigate fire risks.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Tiao Properties has won a lawsuit seeking to force the East Los Angeles Planning Commission to reverse a successful appeal to block a 50-unit apartment complex in Boyle Heights.\nA court backed the Silverlake-based developer, which fought to overcome the appeal against the six-story building at 2115-2123 Cesar E. Chavez Avenue,\nUrbanize Los Angeles reported\n.\nThe court judgment forces the commission to reject the appeal and reapprove the project during a hearing slated for\nApril 9\n.\nIn 2021, the company led by Will and Diana Tiao filed plans to build the 56,000-square-foot apartment building with 4,000 square feet of ground-floor shops and an underground parking garage,\nThe Real Deal reported\n.\nTiao aimed to implement incentives for Transit Oriented Communities \u2014 places that are designed to make it more convenient to take transit than to drive\n\u2014\nto construct a larger building than zoning rules allow in exchange for five affordable apartments set aside for extremely low-income households.\nThe project, approved by the planning commission in 2023, would replace a 115-year-old apartment building with sidewalk storefronts. An affiliate of Will Tiao bought the three-unit, rent-controlled building in early 2020 for $2.1 million.\nThe brown and gray building, designed by West Adams-based Bittoni Architects, would contain vertical windows, with inset balconies on its upper four floors, with floor-to-ceiling windows below, according to a rendering.\nA year ago this month, however, the planning commission\nvoted 3-2\nto grant an appeal blocking the new apartment building at Cesar E. Chavez and North Chicago Street, near bus stops and the Soto/Cesar E. Chavez Metro station.\n\nThe appeal, filed by tenants of the building slated to be bulldozed, argued the project was inconsistent with zoning rules and the California Environmental Quality Act. It said the project had been approved without sufficient community input, and without enough affordable housing.\nPlanning staff had recommended the commission deny the appeal, pointing to state law allowing little discretion on such multifamily development.\nBut a majority of commissioners ultimately voted to grant the appeal, thus overturning the project\u2019s prior approval.\nThe reason: an uptick in evictions after the end of pandemic renter protections, plus an alleged lack of consideration to gentrification, displacement and mental health impacts,\nLA Public Press reported\n. The Tiaos then sued to overturn the decision.\nThe decision to reverse the planning commission appeal is the second such ruling by the courts, according to Urbanize.\nIn late 2020, a Los Angeles judge ordered the South Los Angeles Area Planning Commission\nto rescind its decision to block construction of the District Square project\n, which called for building more than 500 apartments near Metro\u2019s Expo/Crenshaw Station.\nTiao Properties, founded in 2012, manages $125 million in assets, including 200 apartment units, according to its website.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Brookfield Properties won approval from the Northbrook Village Board to begin residential construction at Northbrook Court before tackling the struggling mall\u2019s retail overhaul.\nVillage trustees permitted mixed-use redevelopment and amended an economic incentive agreement, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nThe amount of the economic incentive Brookfield is set to receive hasn\u2019t been disclosed; it was reported in 2018 that the developers sought $27 million in incentives, including $21.5 million in tax increment financing and $5.5 million in sales tax rebates, for a $250 million project. The most recent documents indicate the village has agreed to provide financing through TIF and business district revenues.\nHigh interest rates and economic factors have made operating regional malls like Northbrook Court challenging. High demand for suburban multifamily, on the other hand, has led to rent growth and a competitive investment market, and construction lending for apartments is less difficult.\nBrookfield\u2019s redevelopment plan includes a mix of apartments, row houses and townhomes, designed to meet shifting market demands.The earliest construction could start would be summer 2026.\n\nNorthbrook Court is part of Brookfield\u2019s broader strategy to transform underperforming retail spaces into mixed-use developments. The Northbrook project aims to incorporate residential units, commercial spaces and community amenities, reflecting a shift in focus from traditional retail to more integrated community environments. Brookfield\u2019s similar initiatives include the\nStonestown Galleria\nin San Francisco, where it plans to add thousands of homes and commercial spaces.\nNorthbrook first approved the redevelopment agreement with Brookfield affiliates in 2023, establishing a TIF district and a business district to spur a revamp of the 100-acre property at 1515 Lake Cook Road. However, financial incentives tied to the deal will only be activated once retail development begins, said Amy McEwan, Northbrook\u2019s director of development and planning services.\n\u201cWe safeguarded the agreement, ensuring developers must lease at least 50 percent of retail space before accessing incentives,\u201d said village president Kathryn Ciesla.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

With the purchase, Blox became the lender and completed the foreclosure, according to the Mercury News.\nThe $6.8 million Blox paid to buy the loan is 81.7 percent below the most recently available assessed value for the building, according to the newspaper.\nThe Class A office building, built in 1988 next to the Public Market Emeryville food court, is 60 percent occupied. It was revamped in 2017, according to LoopNet.\n\nBlox sees plenty of potential in the Emeryville market.\n\u201cEmeryville is a leading innovation hub in the Bay Area,\u201d Jason Oberman, CEO of Blox Ventures, said at the time the Blox affiliate bought the loan for the building.\n\u201cWith global leaders like Pixar Animation Studios, Bayer and Novartis, along with the area\u2019s expanding residential offerings, the long-term potential of this property is very promising.\u201d\nThe deal joins other\nEast Bay office properties\nselling for a fraction of what they were once worth following a pandemic shift to remote work, resulting in high vacancy. With higher interest rates and refinancing costs, many landlords have struggled to keep their buildings.\nThis fall, Lakeside Group and Rubicon Point Partners\nacquired a 15-story, 279,700-square-foot building and parking garage\nat 180 Grand Avenue, near Downtown Oakland, through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, after buying its loan for $30.2 million, or $108 per square foot.\nBlox Ventures, founded by Oberman in 2015, owns more than 6 million square feet of commercial real estate valued at more than $3 billion across the Bay Area and in Salt Lake City, Utah, according to its website and the San Francisco Business Times.\nIn 2018, Blox and New York-basedAngelo Gordon\nbought a 58,000-square-foot commercial complex\nof offices, shops and a long-vacant supermarket in Palo Alto for $78.3 million. They leased out the market space and flipped it two years later for $103.6 million, 32 percent more than its last traded price.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "The Witkoff Group and Cammeby\u2019s International Group refinanced the office portion of the famed Woolworth Building in Lower Manhattan.\nBlackstone Group provided a $278.9 million loan at 233 Broadway, PincusCo\nreported\n. The loan breaks down to $358 per square foot.\nThe transaction closed earlier this month. The debt replaced a previous $256 million issued in 2015, also by Blackstone.\nNone of the parties involved immediately responded to a request for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n. The entire debt of the property is $301.6 million, according to Traded.\nSteve Witkoff and Ruby Schron purchased the entirety of the Woolworth Building in 1998 for $137.5 million. In 2012, an investment group led by Alchemy Properties purchased the top 30 floors of the 60-story building for $68 million and proceeded to create luxury condos, which were not involved in the refinancing.\n\nA portion of the office condo\u2019s debt was included in a CMBS deal in the fall of 2020, providing\na peek at the building\u2019s performance\n. As of July 2020, the office condo was 92 percent leased to 84 tenants, up from 79 percent leased in 2015. The largest tenant at the time was New York University, which utilized 94,000 square feet for its School of Professional Studies, as well as administrative offices.\nLast month, tenants signed deals\ncovering 1.25 million square feet\nin Downtown Manhattan alone, according to a Colliers report, representing the district\u2019s highest monthly leasing volume since December 2019.\n\u201cDowntown leasing has sort of been the exception to the uptick we\u2019ve seen in demand over the last several quarters,\u201d said Colliers\u2019 Franklin Wallach, one of the authors of the report.\nA Blackstone-led venture is in the midst of\ntrying to sell\ncommercial debt once held by Signature Bank, at least its third attempt to sell loans from the stake.

        "content": "Westside luxury agent Jacqueline Chernov and a portion of her team have jumped to\nThe Beverly Hills Estates\nas the boutique brokerage looks to grow its presence in the Pacific Palisades post-wildfires\nChernov, who previously affiliated with Compass, was part of a team of agents representing spec developer Yaniv Nehemia on last year\u2019s\nrecord-breaking Pacific Palisades sale\nof 538 Chautauqua Boulevard for $32.3 million. Compass\u2019 David Berg, F. Ron Smith and Kristin Alexander were also part of the listing team. The deal was the neighborhood\u2019s priciest sale on record in more than a year.\n\u201cI wanted to make a change and I had a good opportunity to go to a smaller company because I prefer to be in a more boutique environment,\u201d Chernov said.\nFor The Beverly Hills Estates, Chernov\u2019s addition further bolsters its presence on the Westside and, more specifically, the Palisades, where she\u2019s guiding rebuilds for not only clients but herself, after losing two properties in January\u2019s fires.\nChernov team members Zoe Chernov, Max Chernov, Devin Harris and Stephanie Schembri joined The Beverly Hills Estates while Nicole Strober remains with Compass.\nAnother former team member, Anna Gera, moved on to Westside Estate Agency.\nMeanwhile, Jamielynn Storie will serve as the Chernov team\u2019s director of operations, while she stays with Compass as an agent.\nChernov and her team will be based in\nThe Beverly Hills Estates\n\u2019 West Hollywood headquarters on Sunset Boulevard. The brokerage is expanding its presence on the street, after taking over the building next door and is wrapping up renovations on the space.\nPalisades Rebuilding\nThe brokerage switch is one of several shakeups in recent months for Chernov.\nShe and her son lost their family home in the Palisades\u2019 Alphabet Streets, along with a property in the Huntington neighborhood. They bounced around to 10 different hotels and\nAirbnbs\nfor about six weeks after the Southern California\nwildfires began\n. She saw first-hand the price gouging from landlords, although didn\u2019t have the time to report anyone.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much going on right now just arguing with the insurance company on a daily basis and trying to rebuild the business,\u201d Chernov said. \u201cI was hoping some of the realtors I was friendly with would help [with the price gouging]. Not one did.\u201d\nShe plans to build back both homes, after selecting a builder and meeting with an architect.\n\u201cThe building process should be a year, but no one knows when you can start,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the tricky thing.\u201d\nChernov estimated two-thirds of her Palisades clients are planning on rebuilding. Those who are selling tend to be over the age of 65 or families with very young children not interested in investing the time to wait out permitting and construction.\nAs of Tuesday, there are 81 active land listings on the market in the Palisades, according to data provided by Amalfi Estates owner Anthony Marguleas. Another 17 lots are in escrow and seven have sold.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of potential in the Palisades right now,\u201d Chernov said. \u201cMy phone\u2019s ringing off the hook. I\u2019ve been to this point just helping clients navigate through whether or not they have the bandwidth to rebuild their properties.\u201d\nNow, she\u2019s added the role of developer headhunter to her resume. The roughly dozen spec developers she works with are pivoting from building for themselves to custom builds for clients. It\u2019s a learning process on both ends.\nIn some ways, Chernov\u2019s latest gig brings her back to where she always intended to be. In the early aughts she was studying interior design at the University of California, Los Angeles when a friend suggested she get into real estate. As a single mom with two kids, the work offered flexibility.\nChernov obtained her license in 2003 and started at Coldwell Banker Realty\u2019s Pacific Palisades office. A side hustle flipping homes with her son \u2014 they\u2019re currently working on one property in Mar Vista and another in Larchmont \u2014 exercises her interior design skills.\n\u201cI\u2019m finally doing what I wanted to do 20 years ago,\u201d Chernov said. \u201cWorking with builders helped me understand the process. I can read plans. Now, with the Palisades, all of a sudden, that\u2019s all it is right now: rebuilding.\u201d\n",

        "content": "More than 100 groups, City Council members, community board members and state lawmakers are asking a state court to annul the City of Yes, taking particular aim at the final rezoning that is expected to add 80,000 homes in New York over the next 15 years.\nA lawsuit filed in Staten Island state court on Wednesday alleges that the Adams administration violated city and state environmental laws by failing to do a comprehensive review of the impact of the zoning changes. Though the lawsuit is targeting City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, the legal team believes the other City of Yes zoning changes \u2014 City of Yes for Carbon Neutrality and City of Yes for Economic Opportunity \u2014 would be thrown out if the lawsuit succeeds.\nA City Hall representative said the administration stands by its review process.\n\u201cWhen it comes to housing, there will always be those who say, \u2018Not in my backyard,\u2019 but we stand by the city\u2019s thorough and transparent review process and will address any lawsuit when it is received,\u201d a City Hall spokesperson said in a statement.\nThe complaint seeks to undo City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, a text amendment that made several zoning changes to increase housing throughout the city, including eliminating parking minimums in some parts of the city, allowing more housing in areas near transit and legalizing some accessory dwelling units.\nBut the lawsuit is taking an even bigger swing: An attorney for the plaintiffs says if this lawsuit succeeds, the other two City of Yes zoning changes will also be annulled.\nThe members of the City Council\u2019s Common Sense Caucus, a group of Conservative City Council members who opposed the City of Yes, are named as plaintiffs in the suit. That includes Council members Robert Holden, Vickie Paladino, Joann Ariola and David Carr.\n\u201cThe City of Yes was never really about solving the economic or housing crisis,\u201d said Ariola, who is the Republican minority leader in the Council. \u201cIt was about clearing the decks for big developers to come into our communities and deceive us into thinking it would not have a negative impact on our communities or a negative environmental consequence.\u201d\nSpeakers at the sparsely-attended conference reiterated arguments that City of Yes for Housing Opportunity would lead to the Manhattan-ization of quiet, suburban neighborhoods in the outer boroughs. City leaders have argued that the zoning changes in the text amendment were modest and would lead to a little bit of housing in every district. Changes to low-density neighborhoods allowed three- to five-story apartment buildings near transit and two to four stories of housing above businesses.\nA spokesperson for the Real Estate Board of New York said, \u201creversing this plan would move New York City in the wrong direction by closing pathways to desperately needed new housing within all five boroughs.\u201d\n\nMany of the groups named are based in the outer boroughs, including the Queens Civic Congress, which is leading the suit. A few Manhattan and citywide organizations, including the Met Council on Housing and the Black Institute, are also listed as plaintiffs. Paul DiBenedetto, chair of Community Board 11 in Queens, is among the local community board members who have signed onto the lawsuit.\nThe complaint argues that the administration wrongly separated the zoning changes into three parts.\nThe result, according to the complaint, was to \u201ccover up and conceal the full environmental impacts of City of Yes.\u201d The three \u201cform one piece of an integrated and coordinated public policy overhaul\u201d and should have been considered together rather than presented separately to community boards, the lawsuit alleges.\nThe City Council\napproved\nCity of Yes in November, projecting that the zoning changes would lead to the construction of 80,000 units over the next 15 years, down from a projection that more than 100,000 would be built. The Council secured a number of changes to the proposal before signing off on it, including securing parking minimums in some parts of the city and a $5 billion commitment in public funding.\nEven with funding dedicated to improving local infrastructure, opponents argued that the new housing threatened to overwhelm water and sewer infrastructure.\nThe lawsuit alleges that the city didn\u2019t take a \u201chard look\u201d at how the changes under City of Yes for Housing Opportunity would affect many low-density districts. The city instead opted for a \u201cgeneric\u201d approach in its Environmental Impact Statement, studying \u201c28 prototypical sites and 14 representative neighborhoods.\u201d\nThat approach, as outlined in the city\u2019s environmental review law, is applied to \u201cprograms and plans that have wide application or affect the range of future alternative policies.\u201d\nThe groups also allege that the city failed to present any alternatives to the rezoning to \u201cavoid and reduce the serious and critical negative environmental impacts of City of Yes.\u201d\nA reversal of the rezoning, a signature policy for Mayor Eric Adams, would be a significant blow to an already troubled administration.\n",

        "content": "Douglas Elliman is out of a Section 8 discrimination fight aimed at several of its top producers.\nA federal judge last week dismissed the lawsuit against the firm and its New York City agents over alleged violations of the Fair Housing Act. The case was tossed with prejudice, which means the plaintiff, Shaniqua Newkirk, can\u2019t reopen or revive her claims in a future lawsuit.\nNewkirk, who is Black,\nsued Elliman\nand a number of its top agents \u2014 including Noble Black, Frances Katzen, Ann Cutbill Lenane and Lauren Muss \u2014 in 2023, alleging the luxury brokers either didn\u2019t help her find housing with her Section 8 voucher or didn\u2019t respond to her emailed requests to assist her.\n\u201cWe disagree with the Court\u2019s reasoning in dismissing the Compliant,\u201d Newkirk\u2019s attorney Andrew Miltenberg wrote in a statement. \u201cWe believe that there is a clear and compelling basis for the lawsuit\u00a0 and are considering our appellate options.\u201d\n\u201cWe are thrilled to see these predatory and baseless claims rejected by the court and that the well-earned reputations of our agents and our firm have been affirmed,\u201d said a spokesperson for Douglas Elliman. \u201cThe dismissal of this lawsuit underscores Douglas Elliman\u2019s zero-tolerance policy against any unlawful discrimination. We pride ourselves on our agent training programs, which include rigorous education on fair housing laws.\u201d\nThe decision to dismiss the case came after Newkirk and her attorneys failed to file an amended complaint despite two deadline extensions, according to court documents. The judge initially agreed to dismiss the case in December and allowed Newkirk time to submit a revised complaint. But her attorneys ultimately agreed to the dismissal last week.\nIn a letter to the judge, Newkirk\u2019s attorney Steven Siegel wrote that his research \u201cdid not find any authority to reinstate this cause of action\u201d considering the court\u2019s objections, including that Newkirk hadn\u2019t proved she sustained damages as a result of the allegations. He confirmed Newkirk initiated the case after the statute of limitations had run out for her claims.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Newkirk claimed she started reaching out to brokers on a list of the city\u2019s top agents in June 2021 to find someone to assist her in finding a new apartment with her voucher. Instead, Newkirk alleges her requests were\nbrushed off or went unanswered\n.\n\u201cI only specialize in luxury real estate transactions and don\u2019t even know what sec 8 means,\u201d\u00a0 Elliman agent Madeline Hult Elghanayan told the plaintiff in an email.\nOther agents named in the lawsuit included Eleonora Srugo, whose team recently starred in a Netflix\u2019s reality show called \u201cSelling the City.\u201d Disgraced brokers Tal and Oren Alexander, who left Elliman to launch their own company in 2022, were also named in the complaint.\nNewkirk\u2019s complaint also accused Elliman of violating city laws mandating it \u201cprominently and conspicuously\u201d include a link to the Fair Housing and Anti-Discrimination notice on the homepage of its website.\n\u201cOnly at the very end of the homepage in tiny font under the heading of State Disclosures is a link,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cDefendants are more concerned with their luxury brand than they are with following the law.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Elliman previously pushed back against the claims, calling them \u201cpredatory and baseless.\u201d The spokesperson argued the firm had a \u201czero tolerance policy\u201d for discrimination and maintained a \u201crigorous\u201d training program for agents around fair housing policies.\n",

KS joined the Astoria Cove project in September.\nKS plans to deliver more than 2,800 units across the three phases of the project, well above what Alma promised more than a decade ago; Alma Realty\u2019s Steve Valiotis and Cad3\u2019s Meyer Lebowitz \u2014 who was instrumental in bringing in KS \u2014 remain involved in the project, according to KS managing partner Daniel Spiegel.\nThe first phase of the revived development \u2014 greenlit by this new construction financing \u2014 involves four buildings with 736 apartments and 318 parking spaces. The 26-story residential tower and three mixed-use buildings will sprout at 25-02 Ninth Street and 4-34 26th Avenue.\nA 141-unit building has already been completed.\n\nKS is working towards a $95 million land deal for the development in the next year, as well as a $450 million construction loan for the second phase of the project that will build 1,000 additional units.\nThe third phase, for which the developer is hunting for another $450 million construction loan, will feature another 1,100 units.\nThe whole project will also have between 30,000 to 50,000 square feet of commercial space and a piazza on the East River.\nResidential amenities will include a rooftop pool, fitness center, golf simulator, children\u2019s playroom, indoor and outdoor cinemas and a business center. At least 30 percent of the residential units will be affordable since the project was financed under 421a.\nSpiegel estimates the overall price tag to exceed $2 billion.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s housing market has jogged at its own pace while other cities sprinted ahead since the turn of the century.\nThe city\u2019s home prices have doubled in the last 25 years, but that growth significantly lags home values of most major U.S. metro, according to the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nChicago\u2019s price index landed at just 211.23, placing it near the bottom of the 20-city list, while the national average has more than tripled since January 2000. Markets like Miami, San Diego and Los Angeles have seen prices quadruple since then.\nThe slower climb reflects strengths and weaknesses in Chicago\u2019s housing market.\nThe lack of a dramatic run-up means affordability is strong, making Chicago an attractive place to live even if it doesn\u2019t offer the same wealth gains as pricier coastal cities, said Karen Ranquist of Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nThe market has shown resilience in the short term. Case-Shiller showed Chicago leading most major metros in year-over-year price growth in January, second only to New York. That strength reflects a more stable post-pandemic market compared to places like Phoenix and Tampa, where prices surged and then cooled rapidly.\n\nThe long-term lag is tied to deeper structural challenges. Population loss, slow economic growth and the lasting impact of the foreclosure crisis and pandemic downturns are drags on appreciation.\nLocal markets have also diverged. Historically disinvested areas like Bronzeville and Humboldt Park have seen substantial appreciation driven by reinvestment and redevelopment, while parts of South Cook County have struggled from the decline of industrial jobs.\nChicago\u2019s real estate story is more about stability than speculation despite the uneven gains, with steady demand and an improving outlook for this year.\nMore recently, Chicago home prices have leapt, outpacing inflation with a\n7 percent surge in mid-2024\nand the market remaining active at the start of the year.\nSellers began\ncutting prices earlier than usual\nthis winter as high interest rates and buyer caution tempered demand. Median asking prices hit $410,000 in February, marking a three-year high, and overall values remain 4 to 5 percent above last year\u2019s levels, suggesting pricing power hasn\u2019t vanished even as buyers grow more selective.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

It\u2019s not entirely clear what Torrisi paid for the home, but the property was on the market for $10.75 million before being pulled in July.\nThe seller was Robert McBride, a prominent lobbyist in the renewable energy, real estate and hospital sectors. He declined to comment on the all-cash deal, as did Torrisi.\nThe estate, which overlooks Fort Pond Bay, stretches across more than an acre and a half. The main home was built in 2008 and spans 7,600 square feet, complete with five bedrooms and seven-and-a-half bathrooms. Additional features include a tackle room, a gym, a wine cellar with a tasting room and a pool.\nTorrisi already owns a home in Montauk. In 2023, he told\nPenta\nthat his Montauk home was an escape from work, where he could surf, cook and enjoy an outdoor lifestyle.\nWork is certainly busy for Torrisi. Beyond owning impossible-to-nab reservation spots like Carbone and Torrisi, he and his partners, Jeff Zalaznick and Mario Carbone, are expanding their reach beyond food.\n\nAt the end of last year, Major Food Group broke ground on Villa Miami, a branded project being developed with Terra and One Thousand Group; the partners also secured a $285 million construction loan.\nThe 56-story, 70-unit condo building represents Major Food Group\u2019s\nfirst branded residential development\n. The hospitality group will brand Villa Miami\u2019s food and beverage venues, including branded dining at the private, multistory Copper Club.\nUnits will range from 3,000 square feet to 6,000 square feet, and prices will start at $5 million. Villa Miami is expected to be completed in 2027.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\nREAD MORE LINKS:\n",

Other tenants include Douglas Elliman and RealSource Group.\nLori and Mitch Junkins bought the building in 1996 for $2 million, or $106 per square foot. Last year, they sold it to a \u201crelated entity\u201d for an undisclosed price, according to the Business Journal.\nPlans call for bulldozing it to make way for an eight-story, 118,600-square-foot apartment building with four studio, 15 one-bedroom, 42 two-bedroom and 15 three-bedroom apartments atop an underground parking garage for 190 cars.\nTwelve apartments would be set aside as affordable, including six for low-income households and six for moderate-income tenants.\nJunkins wants to construct an 85-foot-tall building, and seeks a height waiver from local zoning rules that limit projects to 32 feet. It\u2019s not clear if she would employ local or state density bonus incentives.\nA cost and timeline for development were not disclosed.\n\nThe project, designed by Irvine-based MVE, is the latest in multifamily developments proposed in Newport Center, a hilltop commercial district founded by the Irvine Company around the Fashion Island mall.\nAcross from Newport Center, Dallas-based Park Newport LP has filed plans to expand its Park Newport Apartments by 366 units at 1 Park Newport at a cost of\n$800,000 a unit\n.\nThe Irvine Company recently filed plans to build 200 apartments at Villas of Fashion Island at 1000 San Joaquin Plaza and 600 apartments at 110 Newport Center Drive, also known as Block 100.\nThe firm also wants to convert part of an office campus at MacArthur Court near John Wayne Airport into\n700 homes\n.\nIn December, Irvine-based Related California pitched a plan to demolish a movieplex near Fashion Island\nto build 140 condominiums\nin two towers at 210 and 300 Newport Center Drive.\nSanta Ana-based Nexus Companies also debuted Vivante Newport Center, a 99-unit assisted living senior complex, which replaced the former Orange County Museum of Art. It includes a movie theater, golf simulator, bowling alley and spa.\nThe upscale coastal city has a state-mandated plan to build\n4,845 homes by 2029\n, of which 2,386 would be affordable for low- and very low-income households. Of those, half the homes are planned around Newport Center.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "It took six years, but the real estate industry finally got a chance to grill Andrew Cuomo about the 2019 law that crushed rent-stabilized building owners.\nThe opportunity came in a meeting with the Real Estate Board of New York that was private, but Cuomo\u2019s spokesperson later issued a\npublic statement\nabout it.\nWarning: It might make your head explode.\n\u201cWhile well-intentioned, the 2019 bill had unintended consequences in some places \u2014 specifically changes involving MCI and IAI repairs,\u201d said the longtime Cuomo loyalist, Rich Azzopardi. \u201cThere\u2019s been widespread acknowledgment of these issues, which subsequently were the subject of legislative tweaks.\u201d\nTo the uninformed, this makes it seem like the law included a few innocent mistakes that were repaired. But owners of rent-stabilized buildings know better.\nThe tenant activists who literally wrote the law on behalf of Senate and Assembly leaders knew exactly what the consequences would be, as would anyone with even a passing knowledge of rent stabilization.\nFar from unintended, the consequences were deliberate. Let\u2019s give a rundown of the reality.\nAbout those IAIs, or individual apartment improvements: Even state legislators are not so stupid to think apartments can be renovated for $15,000, which is the amount they allowed landlords to recover through temporary rent increases.\nEven more damaging to old buildings, the lawmakers ended the 20 percent rent increase that had been allowed after a tenancy ended.\nThey figured landlords would swallow the extra cost rather than let apartments sit vacant. They were wrong. If the renovation expense is high and the legal rent is low, the math doesn\u2019t work. As it stands now, tens of thousands of rent-regulated units\nremain vacant\n.\nSimilarly, major capital improvements, or MCIs, cost far more than landlords were allowed to recover from tenants.\nThe \u201ctweaks\u201d passed several years later were barely better than nothing.\nCuomo should have prevented this from happening, but instead removed himself from the negotiations for reasons he never explained. The truth is that he had allegedly reached out to tenant activists, apparently seeking political cover for a compromise bill, but they\nrefused to meet with him\n\u2014 confident they could pass something without him. The governor, a famous control freak, had lost control of the process.\n\nAt that point, he made a disingenuous promise \u2014 a dare, really \u2014 that he would sign whatever state legislators put on his desk. And when the law passed, he had to live up to that pledge.\nThe conventional wisdom is that he didn\u2019t think Senate and Assembly leaders could round up enough votes without him to pass such a flawed law. But it\u2019s more likely that he was looking for a bill that both tenant leaders and the industry would endorse, only to realize that was impossible.\n\u201cThe governor played chicken and lost,\u201d said Jay Martin of the New York Apartment Association, which represents rent-stabilized owners and was not part of Cuomo\u2019s recent meeting with REBNY.\nWhatever Cuomo\u2019s rationale, I have no doubt that he was looking for the best possible outcome for himself, not for rent-stabilized housing. All politicians put their careers first in such moments. That\u2019s why he pretended to embrace the outcome, rubbing salt in landlords\u2019 wounds by celebrating with a bill-signing ceremony.\nAnother reason it\u2019s hard for landlords to wrap their brains around Cuomo\u2019s public explanation is that changes to individual apartment improvements and major capital improvements were hardly the only problem with the law.\nIt also made deregulation virtually impossible for individual units. That matters a lot for buildings\u2019 financial and physical health because market-rate rents from units in otherwise rent-stabilized buildings provide an important cross-subsidy.\nLandlords use that revenue to maintain and improve their properties, to attract and retain free-market tenants \u2014 something they have little incentive to do for regulated tenants, but which clearly benefits those renters.\nCuomo also presided over the separation of rent stabilization and the 421a tax abatement for multifamily projects. The two laws had been paired legislatively for years so the industry and tenants each had something to gain from the passage of the other. It was an unusual but effective political arrangement.\nSevering them left the governor with less leverage when the time came to renew the rent law, and the newly left-leaning legislature closed the rent spigot until nothing but drops came out. Buildings began to shrivel, and violations have piled up.\nCuomo\u2019s rivals in the mayoral race are all talking about his subsequent scandals \u2014 the nursing home fiasco and sexual harassment allegations.\nBut those matter little to owners whose buildings are under water and who are still waiting for accountability on the 2019 rent law. They were not in the meeting with REBNY, which is clearly backing Cuomo for mayor.\n\u201cAll of a sudden, it\u2019s wrapped in a bow,\u201d Martin said of Cuomo\u2019s sitdown. \u201cIt\u2019s kumbaya.\u201d\n",

Last week, the commission reassigned the $640,000 loan commitment to phase two of the affordable housing development.\nThough Pinnacle did not obtain 9 percent low-income housing tax credits last year, the developer landed other types of financing for phase one of Pinnacle at Cypress, including a State Apartment Incentive Loan (SAIL). In addition, \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten a bond inducement from the Broward County Housing Finance Authority, and we\u2019re in the process of applying now for some additional Broward County gap financing,\u201d Timothy Wheat, a partner of\nPinnacle\n, told\nThe Real Deal.\nThe developer will break ground in the first quarter of 2026 for construction of 100 affordable apartments for seniors in phase one, Wheat said. Pinnacle will complete construction of the two-phased development in June 2028, according to a conceptual timeline the developer submitted to the city.\n\nThe total cost of the development is nearly $90 million, he said.\nEligibility to become a tenant of Pinnacle at Cypress is based on area median income. On average, tenants of the senior and workforce housing units will earn 60 percent of AMI. AMI is $81,900, according to the Broward Housing Council.\nPinnacle is led by partners Louis Wolfson III, David Deutch, Wheat and Coraly Rodriguez and Hugo Pacanins.\nThe 1.8-acre site of Pinnacle at Cypress at 6250 North Andrews Avenue is owned by Poliakoff Becker &amp; Strietfeld LLP, led by Fort Lauderdale attorney Keith M. Poliakoff. He said that he and other owners of the site entered a partnership with Pinnacle to develop the affordable housing complex.\nPoliakoff also said the development at\nCypress Creek\nwill qualify for streamlined city approval by city staff under the state\u2019s\nLive Local Act,\nwhich encourages commercial-industrial multifamily developments with an affordable housing component in areas not zoned for residential property.\n\u201cThis development will move much quicker than other affordable deals, because it generally does not require board approvals,\u201d Poliakoff said.\nThe MS Foundation, which occupies an office building on the phase-two portion of the development site, will relocate to ground-floor office space in the 100-unit apartment building for seniors.",

        "content": "A federal office building\u2019s listing in downtown San Antonio created an opening for city officials to advance their vision for a major new sports and entertainment district.\nThe plans offer a hopeful glimpse of what could become of dozens of federal properties recently marked for disposition nationwide.\nThe 163,060-square-foot building at 727 East C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez Boulevard is one of eight properties nationwide the U.S. General Services Administration has listed for \u201caccelerated disposition,\u201d the San Antonio Express-News\nreported\n.\nThe 1974 building has housed agencies like the Social Security Administration, Federal Bureau of Prisons and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and sits within Hemisfair, a former World\u2019s Fair site that\u2019s become central to the city\u2019s long-term development plans.\nSan Antonio officials have long expressed interest in acquiring the building and nearby federally owned parking lots, which would give it greater control over land tied to Project Marvel, its\nredevelopment plan\nfeaturing a new San Antonio Spurs arena that could run the city as much as $4 billion. Officials did not disclose the status of negotiations for the building, or whether any are occurring.\nProject Marvel also calls for an expanded convention center, renovated Alamodome, second convention hotel and surrounding retail, residential and park space. Officials plan to create a land bridge over Interstate 37 to better connect the campus to the rest of the city.\n\nAgencies currently housed in the building may not need to move, the GSA said. A sale-leaseback is possible, depending on a new owner\u2019s plans.\nGSA has been refining a broader list of over 400 federal properties initially marked for sale, narrowing it based on maintenance costs, vacancy and availability of replacement space. No details have been released on the San Antonio building\u2019s condition or current occupancy rate.\nIn 2022, the city acquired two other federal properties nearby \u2014 the John H. Wood Jr. Federal Courthouse and the Adrian A. Spears Judicial Training Center \u2014 through a long-planned land swap.\nThe city also still holds an exclusive option to lease or buy the Institute of Texan Cultures site at 801 East C\u00e9sar E Ch\u00e1vez Boulevard, where the new arena would be located.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

Paxton said his office would pursue any violations of state law uncovered in the course of the investigation.\n\nThe probe follows online backlash that began after videos promoting the neighborhood went viral, drawing millions of views and criticism from right-wing figures and elected officials. State Rep. Jeff Leach, a Republican from Allen, previously called on Paxton to investigate whether the development would incorporate Sharia law, a charge that EPIC City\u2019s supporters have rejected.\nCommunity Capital Partners will work with Paxton\u2019s office to cooperate with the investigation to correct what president Imran Chaudhary characterized as misinformation and \u201crumor-milling.\u201d\nThe investigation comes as the East Plano Islamic Center has moved forward with two additional developments, EPIC Ranches One and Two, which would span 200 acres near the main site.\nOther state leaders also weighed in, including Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who suggested in a\npost on X\nthat the legislature may introduce new restrictions, along with a pending\nbill meant to ban foreign buyers\n, in response to projects like EPIC City.

        "content": "A New York City new development heavyweight is jumping from Douglas Elliman to Compass.\nDennis Mangone is joining the city\u2019s largest brokerage by headcount after more than a decade with his previous firm, where he developed a reputation for working with developers such as the Witkoff Group\u2019s Steve Witkoff, hotelier Ian Schrager and Alan Faena.\nIn his new role, Mangone is tasked with growing Compass\u2019 new development marketing business in New York and South Florida. Mangone previously worked on projects such as Schrager\u2019s 160 Leroy and Schrager and Witkoff\u2019s 215 Chrystie Street.\nA spokesperson for Compass said Mangone is the \u201cperfect person\u201d to bring the firm\u2019s new development business to the next level, given his longstanding relationships with developers and experience on the pre-development and design side of projects.\n\u201cWe see a real opportunity with new development right now,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe really want to lean into it.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Elliman said the firm \u201c[wishes] Dennis the best of luck.\u201d\nMangone\njoined Elliman\nfrom Brown Harris Stevens in 2011, bringing with him a roster of celebrity clients including Beyonce, Ricky Martin and Mario Testino. That year, Mangone sold Studio 54 co-founder Schrager\u2019s four-bedroom duplex at 285 Lafayette Street for\n$11 million\n.\n\nMangone has also worked with major fashion names such as Fabien Baron, French art director and magazine editor. Mangone sold his Soho condo for\n$7.5 million\nin 2012. Mangone also partnered with Elliman\u2019s Raphael De Niro to\nsell units at the Puck Building\n, which included deals north of $20 million.\nOutside of New York, Mangone worked on the pre-development of Schrager\u2019s The Residences at The Miami Beach Edition and Terra and Related Groups\u2019 Park Grove Miami.\nAt Compass, Mangone will focus particularly on branded residences. These developments have been gaining significant traction in New York. For example, Vlad Doronin\u2019s Aman New York quickly sold out and logged a number of banner deals. (Doronin himself paid $135 million for the penthouse at the Midtown development last year.)\nCompass\u2019 new development division in New York was built largely by\nacquiring the once-boutique\nManhattan firm, Stribling &amp; Associates, in 2019. Alexa Lambert, who spent 25 years with Stribling before joining Compass as part of the merger, was the top new development broker in the city in\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s\nlatest ranking\n, thanks in part to sales at some of Miki Naftali\u2019s Upper East Side projects.\n\u201cThis marks an exciting new chapter in my journey,\u201d Mangone wrote in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m eager to contribute to Compass\u2019s continued evolution.\u201d\nMangone\u2019s departure is the latest in a string of agent defections from Elliman to Compass. Just last month, top agent Holly Parker and her New York-based team\nmade the jump\nafter more than two decades with her former firm.\n",

        "content": "The 300 families who lost their homes in east Malibu to the Palisades firestorm have one more challenge to rebuild their houses: rising seas.\nHomeowners must not only gird their new homes with new fireproofing measures. They must also rebuild their homes to guard against rising seas and stronger storms from the south and west,\nthe Los Angeles Times reported.\nAnd that means raising the homes and constructing sturdier seawalls to protect properties and their septic systems from ocean encroachment brought about by climate change \u2014 with some projections putting sea level rise at up to 9 feet by the end of this century.\nThose that lost their homes simply want a chance to rebuild their houses and put their lives back together. Many families had inherited the aging properties built along the Pacific Coast Highway, with most of their wealth tied to the beach.\nOthers, including academics and climate policy analysts, suggest what local and state politicians will not: removing homes along the beach to accommodate the advancing ocean.\n\u201cRight now it would be political suicide for anyone in public office to talk about not rebuilding everything and anything, after the fires,\u201d one longtime observer of coastal development, who asked not to be named to avoid alienating Malibu homeowners, told the Times.\n\u201cThis is not a time that invites the most thoughtful policy discussion.\u201d\nFor the swath of homes along PCH from Topanga Canyon Boulevard to Carbon Canyon torched in the January firestorm, the damage appears to be getting worse. With little dry sand or protective shore, tides and waves continue to wash charred debris from burned homes into Santa Monica Bay, according to the Times.\nWith homes and their seawalls now heavily damaged, the already vulnerable Highway 1 could be more exposed to erosion. In addition, hundreds of septic systems for human waste at each of the houses remain buried under blackened debris.\n\nMany homeowners will be required to install bigger tanks and better protective devices, which could drive up costs $250,000 or more. For Malibu, incorporated 34 years ago to keep L.A. County from installing sewers and a flood of development, installing sewers is a nonstarter.\n\u201cWe want to get people back in their houses, and with the sewer system there are major hurdles,\u201d Malibu Mayor Doug Stewart told the Times. \u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves and think we can wait three or four or five years to get a sewer system and then start rebuilding homes.\u201d\nMost of the fire victims face insurance payouts not expected, in most cases, to cover all their costs, with an estimated price tag for reconstruction at $1,000 a square foot or more.\nWhile Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered a waiver of the California Environmental Quality Act and the state Coastal Act to speed rebuilding, scientists predict challenges along the coast will grow with time.\n\u201cI think we suffer from what I call a short disaster memory. We want to get in there and build and rebuild as fast as we can,\u201d Gary Griggs, a UC Santa Cruz oceanographer and coastal geologist, told the Times. But the impermanence of coastal construction \u201dis not something most people are interested in hearing about.\u201d\nThe author of \u201cCalifornia Catastrophes: The Natural Disaster History of the Golden State,\u201d said extreme extreme weather \u2014 with bigger and more energetic waves connected to the warming climate \u2014 could be the biggest threat to coastal homes.\nMany lots along the east Malibu shore reach over the mean tide line \u2014 the boundary between private property and land that belongs to the public, according to the newspaper. Environmental advocates have called for a \u201cmanaged retreat\u201d for especially vulnerable properties.\n\u201cThe public has a portfolio with the public land along this stretch,\u201c Wade Graham, a historian who taught urban and environmental policy at Pepperdine University in Malibu, told the Times. \u201cI think it\u2019s really problematic to allow those houses to be rebuilt on that stretch of highway, where they probably shouldn\u2019t be in the 21st century.\u201d\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

LaVine purchased the three-bedroom condo in September 2022 for the same price from former Chicago Bears linebacker Khalil Mack.\nJameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent Nancy Tassone has the listing.\nUnit 2802 features a 750-square-foot wraparound terrace, complete with a hot tub and overhead heaters.\nIt has three and a half bathrooms, a 60-foot linear ventless fireplace and a living room outfitted with custom millwork. The kitchen is stocked with high-end appliances, including a steam oven and a 14-foot waterfall island.\n\nThe primary suite includes a sitting room and built-in bar, along with a bathroom featuring a TV-equipped dual shower and rain shower and a bathtub with a pop-up TV lift and champagne bucket. Heated floors and inlaid stone hallways fill out the package.\nLaVine\u2019s listing is the latest in a string of high-profile real estate activity at 9 West Walton. The tower has attracted a long list of athletes and business figures, including Ken Griffin, Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Jason Heyward, Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews.\nGriffin previously purchased the top four floors for nearly $59 million, and Pritzker acquired the top two from him\nlast year for $19 million\n.\nThe annual property taxes for Levine\u2019s unit were listed at $129,361, and monthly HOA dues total $4,937, or more than $59,000 annually.\nLuxury Chicago condos have been hot lately, particularly in the Gold Coast. Chicago Bulls forward Patrick Williams\ndropped $5.7 million\non a unit at 65 East Goethe Street last summer, and the most expensive deal so far this year went down for a\n$10 million penthouse\nin the Elm and State building.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "A massive park project is nearing construction in Dallas\u2019 urban core, with backers hoping it becomes the next centerpiece of civic life \u2014 and a catalyst for billions in real estate development.\nHarold Simmons Park, a long-planned $325 million green space along the Trinity River led by the Trinity Park Conservancy and the Trinity River Corridor Local Government Corp., is expected to begin construction April 8 after decades of planning, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n, citing a project presentation during a city meeting Tuesday.\nThe 250-acre site will stretch between the Margaret McDermott and Ronald Kirk bridges, with initial construction focused on the 22-acre West Overlook, which will include filter gardens, a water-play area and a skate and bike park.\nOnce completed, the park is projected to generate $2.7 billion in adjacent development over the next 30 years, according to a recent city presentation. Backers also anticipate 4 million annual visitors and an estimated $7 billion economic impact, while creating 600 construction jobs and more than 260 permanent positions.\nThe project\u2019s scale and ambition evoke Klyde Warren Park, the 5.4-acre deck park over Woodall Rodgers Freeway that has become one of Dallas\u2019 most transformative urban spaces.\n\nBut unlike Klyde Warren, which stitched together downtown and Uptown on a sliver of capped freeway, Harold Simmons Park occupies open riverfront land long seen as underutilized. Its size and programming could rival other metros\u2019 parks nationwide, with sport courts, a roller skate rink and new public buildings designed by Lake Flato and Wernerfield, and landscape architecture by New York-based Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates.\nKlyde Warren Park helped trigger over $1 billion in adjacent development and has become a case study in leveraging green space for real estate and community investment. Simmons Park aims to replicate that success at five times the size, and in a part of Dallas still awaiting reinvention.\nThe park is named after the late billionaire Harold Simmons, a Dallas businessman known for his leveraged buyouts. It\u2019s one of several major green space initiatives planned throughout the city, including Halperin Park, The Loop Dallas and the Five Mile Greenbelt.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Shed the sheds. Get sheds down.\nThe City Council on Wednesday voted to hopefully\nshed\nthe number of terrible shed-related calls to action.\nThe Sheddies\ncan stay, I guess.\nThe Council approved a package of bills that: ramp up penalties for owners who continuously renew permits for sidewalk sheds without progressing on fa\u00e7ade repairs, require the Department of Buildings to lengthen the period of time between mandatory fa\u00e7ade inspections and bumps the first required inspection from five years to eight years after a building is constructed.\nOne of the bills also requires the DOB to recommend less ugly sidewalk shed designs by Sept. 30. Sheds can also now be metallic gray, white or \u201ca color matching the fa\u00e7ade, trim, cornice, or roof of the building.\u201d Another bill requires more lighting under sidewalk sheds. I broke down the bills, sponsored by Council members Keith Powers and Erik Bottcher,\nhere\n.\nThe bottom line is that these bills are aimed at reducing the number of sheds that clog city sidewalks.\nAccording to the DOB\n, more than 8,500 sheds are up throughout the city, and have been for an average of 511 days.\nThe Real Estate Board of New York raised some issues with the original versions of some of the\nbills\n, including one that creates penalties for owners who fail to file permits for work within eight months of installing a shed and those that fail to complete that work within two years. The amended version of that bill seems to address REBNY\u2019s concern, allowing owners to file a request for an extension if they can explain why the work cannot be completed within the timeframe. Filing such an application temporarily stops the clock for calculating penalties.\n\u201cWe commend the bills\u2019 sponsors, City Council and Administration for considering the concerns from our industry on this topic and advancing legislation that will spur more user-friendly and creative sidewalk sheds,\u201d Daniel Avery, REBNY\u2019s director of policy, said in a statement. He noted that there are still issues that need to be worked out in the rulemaking process.\nA lot will be worked out in the rulemaking process. One of the measures calls on the DOB to adopt new rules to increase the time between fa\u00e7ade inspections from five years to sometime between six and 12 years. Powers noted on Wednesday that the agency will apply different timeframes based on a number of factors (fa\u00e7ade materials require different levels of maintenance).\nIf it feels like we\u2019ve been talking about the scourge of sidewalk sheds for a long time, that\u2019s because we have. This legislation has been a long time coming. In 2023, the mayor pitched his \u201cGet Sheds Down\u201d initiative and Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine released his \u201cShed the Shed\u201d report. And years before that, legislation to crackdown on these sheds was introduced in the Council.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nSpeaking of talking about things for a long time, it looks like we\u2019ll be talking about City of Yes for Housing Opportunity for the foreseeable future. What do you think about the\nlawsuit\nthat was just filed challenging the rezoning? Send a note to kathryn@therealdeal.com.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nPolitical consultant Jeffrey Leb, who has been behind a number of PACs that have taken contributions from the real estate industry, has a new PAC supporting Sen. Simcha Felder\u2019s run for City Council. The group hasn\u2019t yet posted information on contributions.\n\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 A state lawmaker proposed a bill on Wednesday that would rescind permits for Tesla\u2019s five sales locations in New York,\nPolitico New York reports\n. \u201cNo matter what we do, we\u2019ve got to take this from Elon Musk,\u201d Assembly member Pat Fahy, a lawmaker who championed legislation to fully lift restrictions on direct sales by EV makers, told Politico. \u201cHe\u2019s part of an effort to go backwards.\u201d\n\u2014\nICYMI: State Sen. Simcha Felder won the special election to fill Assembly member Kalman Yeger\u2019s vacant City Council seat in Brooklyn,\nCity &amp; State reports\n.\nFelder is finishing Kalman\u2019s two year term, which started in 2023, so he will run in the June primary and the general election in November.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Wednesday was\n$14.75 million\nfor a 5,000-square-foot duplex co-op unit at 834 Fifth Avenue in Lenox Hill. The Deborah Grubman Team of The Corcoran Group\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$2.6 million\nfor a 7,872-square-foot, 13-unit walkup apartment building at 25-32 Steinway Street in Astoria.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$16.9 million\nfor a 8,560-square-foot house at 42 West 71st Street on the Upper West Side. Jasmine Ji of Compass has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 99,031-square-foot, six-story community facility project at 269 Heyward Street in East Williamsburg. Amr Ouda of Jay Architect &amp; Engineering filed the permit on behalf of David Kohn.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "For South Side developer Jamie Nahon, a plan to capitalize on Bronzeville\u2019s real estate hype may have been easier said than done.\nIn 2021, Nahon set out to build over 20 townhomes scattered throughout Bronzeville and Woodlawn in hopes of cashing in on the area\u2019s growing cach\u00e9. A website promoted the project as a chance for investors to reap the benefits of the Opportunity Zone program, a federal policy that provides tax breaks to real estate investments in underserved areas.\nIt pointed to the groundbreaking of the multi-billion dollar megadevelopment known as Bronzeville Lakefront and the ongoing construction of the Obama Presidential Library in nearby Woodlawn as evidence that the time was right to get in on the early stages of the neighborhood\u2019s turnaround after decades of population loss.\nBut four years later, many of Nahon\u2019s townhomes sit vacant, while the developer navigates legal fights with Green Day Construction, the general contractor for the project.\nNahon and Green Day, which is run by Scott Allbright, agreed to a two-phase construction contract totaling about $15 million. Phase one involved the construction and rehab of 11 townhomes for $7.3 million or about $671,000 per building. Phase two involved the construction and rehab of 11 townhomes for $8.2 million or about $754,000 per building.\nAlthough most of the work was completed and paid for, Nahon, via an LP called Eagle OZB I, sued Green Day Construction accusing the company of low-balling its initial budget proposal, repeatedly requesting budget increases, diverting project funds for unrelated use, performing shoddy construction work and over-extending the completion timeline. The lawsuit also alleges that some buildings were left incomplete, including lacking appliances that were already paid for.\nNahon declined to comment. Allbright, his legal representatives and Nahon\u2019s attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.\nGreen Day Construction isn\u2019t willing to take all the blame, and is instead fighting back. It also filed mechanics liens against Eagle OZB\u2019s ownership of the properties, alleging the contractor is owed about $1.2 million for unpaid work outlined in the updated budget. Green Day requested a judge to approve a foreclosure of the properties that could transfer their ownership to the contractor, if advanced.\nHowever, Nahon also alleges Green Day Construction\u2019s poor craftsmanship led to significant maintenance issues within the buildings such as widespread plumbing leaks and access points for rodent infestations. It\u2019s unclear how many tenants moved into the properties but Nahon\u2019s lawsuit said some moved out due to maintenance concerns that Nahon alleges Green Day Construction refused to remedy.\n\nMany of the tri-flat buildings appear empty and are advertised for lease or for sale. Two sold for around $1 million and one sold for $875,000. Rents for individual units range from about $2,200 to $2,600.\nMeanwhile, a subcontractor sued Green Day Construction as well, alleging it\u2019s owed $235,000 for the entirety of a contract between the company and the general contractor for work on the townhomes.\nSeparately, Nahon is suing Green Day Construction for incomplete work on a $3.3 million renovation project for a 68-unit multifamily property at 7109 South Bennett Avenue in Bronzeville. The lawsuit alleges that Green Day Construction again low-balled its initial estimate and surpassed an agreed upon construction completion deadline.\nAs cost overruns added at least $2 million to the project, Nahon took out a separate loan from Renovo Financial backed by a personal guarantee to fund the additional costs.\nBut even with the additional funding, the projects continued to confront issues and stall. Nahon\u2019s lawsuit alleges that Allbright blamed overruns on inflation but also admitted to intentionally low-balling his initial construction estimates to land the job. Nahon also suspects Allbright of intentionally diverting funds for the project to non-related business and personal use, his lawsuit alleges.\nNahon would not have taken out the second loan had he known about Allbright\u2019s alleged fabrication of the initial estimate and misdealing of funds, his lawsuit alleges.\nConstruction came to a standstill in September and in December, Allbright filed mechanics liens against the property, alleging Green Day Construction is owed $236,000 for unpaid work on the project. The lawsuits remain pending in Cook County court.\nNahon in January listed for sale a\nformer Catholic school building at 545 East Oakwood\nin Bronzeville, previously slated for demolition and redevelopment, for $1.1 million, after he bought it from the Archdiocese of Chicago for $725,000 in September.\nIn 2023,\nNahon\u2019s firm Eagle Infinite\npurchased a $29 million portfolio of multifamily buildings across the Bronzeville, Kenwood and Hyde Park neighborhoods.\n",

        "content": "A long-neglected home designed by Frank Lloyd Wright on Chicago\u2019s West Side is finally set to receive urgent repairs, marking the first meaningful step toward its preservation after decades of decay.\nThe Walser House, a 122-year-old residence at 42 North Central Avenue in the Austin neighborhood, will be repaired by the bank that holds the mortgage, previously reported as PHH Mortgage, which informed a Cook County judge earlier this month that it would begin addressing a host of prevailing building code violations, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n.\nPreservationists view the repairs as crucial to saving the home, one of Wright\u2019s early works and a rare architectural landmark in a part of the city that has seen far less preservation investment than areas like Oak Park. Restoration costs are estimated at about $500,000, said Barbara Gordon, the conservancy\u2019s executive director.\nBuilt in 1903, the stucco residence was designed for printing executive Joseph Jacob Walser Jr. and is noted for its horizontal lines, overhanging eaves and bands of windows \u2014 features that would later define Wright\u2019s signature Prairie School style.\nThe home has fallen into serious disrepair. A court filing detailed damage that includes rotting wood, cracked stucco, exposed structural elements and a deteriorating roof and chimney.\n\nIt has stood vacant since its last owner died in 2019, and it is also entangled in foreclosure proceedings, with\na reverse mortgage that exceeds the home\u2019s value\n.\nA coalition of preservation advocates \u2014 including Austin Coming Together, the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy, Landmarks Illinois and Preservation Chicago \u2014 has pushed for years to save the house. Local leaders hope the home can ultimately be donated to a nonprofit that would raise funds to restore the property and repurpose it as a community space or tourism site.\nA status hearing on the repairs is scheduled for April 1, and while the future of the Walser House is still far from certain, preservationists say the bank\u2019s commitment signals the first real progress in years.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Berkeley\u2019s largest hotel and biggest waterfront tenant is headed toward default, according to Morningstar. The $48.3 million loan on the 378-room DoubleTree Berkeley Marina was transferred to special servicing this month for \u201cimminent monetary\u201d default.\nThe ratings company gave low revenue as one reason for the default, with a debt service coverage ratio of just .34x last year. It has been below issuance since the pandemic, according to Morningstar.\nHong Kong-based\nJunson Capital\n, the family office for Chinese billionaire Cai Kui, has owned the waterfront hotel since 2014 through 200 Marina LLC. The loans in question were originated by Wells Fargo and UBS in 2017 and packaged into a commercial mortgage-backed securities offering that year.\nBingdong Zhao, the New York-based head of Junson\u2019s Real Estate Investment Division, is listed as the manager of 200 Marina LLC in city documents. He did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\nIn April 2020, Junson representatives worked out a new 22-year extension to the land lease with the city, which owns the 14 acres the hotel and its 425 parking spaces have sat on since 1972, according to city records.\nThe lease now runs until 2080 and negotiations included a $3 million capital contribution for sidewalk improvements as well as an increase in rent minimums from $306,000 a year to $841,591 a year, with annual adjustments for inflation, according to a city report on the lease.\n\nThe hotel also pays the city a percentage rent on a quarterly basis, with a credit given for minimum rent, and that remains at 5 percent of room revenue and 2.5 percent of food and beverage revenue. Starting in 2040, and every 10 years after that, the city can reset those percentages \u201cif they are no longer reflective of market trends,\u201d the report says.\nThe new lease also requires the owner and any successor to operate it as a full-service hotel with at least an \u201cUpscale\u201d rating as defined by the STR Chain Scale. Other Upscale brands include Four Points by Sheraton, Hyatt House, Crowne Plaza and Wyndham. The 2020 lease report also noted that the owners had just completed an $8 million renovation to their back patio and waterfront restaurant, The Berkeley Boathouse.\nEven prior to the rent increase, the Doubletree Hotel\u2019s $1.4 million in annual rent payments made up more than 20 percent of all Marina Fund revenue and its transit occupancy tax generated close to $3 million for the city\u2019s general fund, according to the report. City Manager Paul Buddenhagen and Parks Recreation and Waterfront Director Scott Ferris did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the possible impacts of the default on the city and its marina, which is also home to two other full-service restaurants, Cesar Chavez Park and the Berkeley Yacht Club.\nThis is the second time the same hotel has been in default, albeit under different ownership. In 2010 it was owned by a partnership of Houston-based Westmont Hospitality Group and Montreal-based Cadim when they went into default on a $160 million loan with Citigroup, according to reporting from the time. That loan covered seven hotels in total: the Doubletree Berkeley, plus two hotels in Florida, two in North Carolina, one in Michigan and one in Ohio.\nDoubleTree Berkeley Marina is also one of many hotels under financial strain in the Bay Area since the pandemic, including two owned by Park Hotels in San Francisco, which recently found a buyer on its\n$725 million debt\n.\n",

        "content": "A mystery buyer has bought a 10,200-square-foot mansion on San Francisco\u2019s Billionaires\u2019 Row in a first-time sale for $26.5 million \u2014 $11.5 million less than the initial ask.\nThe family of the late philanthropists Fritz and Lucy Jewett sold the landmark home at the top of the famed Lyon Street Steps at 2990 Broadway in Pacific Heights, next to the Presidio, the\nSan Francisco Business Times\nreported.\nThe sale of the home, known as the Jewett House, was the first since the property was built in 1987.\nGeorge Jewett had initially listed his parents\u2019 home in June for\n$38 million\n, making it the priciest home listing in San Francisco, then cut the price in response to recent sales along the luxury Row. Lucy Jewett died in 2023 at age 94. Her husband Fritz died in 2008.\nThe Jewitts, heirs to the Weyerhaeuser lumber fortune, built the four-bedroom, 10-bathroom estate in 1987, where they hosted such guests as Nancy Pelosi, former President George H.W. Bush and Britain\u2019s Prince Philip.\nThe last house on Outer Broadway, designed by Sandy Walker, has sweeping views of the Golden Gate Bridge, Marin Headlands and Alcatraz.\nThe white mansion with curved bay windows has a grand entryway with a dramatic winding staircase, solarium, and hardwood and marble floors across numerous living rooms with 13-foot ceilings.\n\nThere\u2019s a full-service bar, library, butler\u2019s pantry and a seven-car garage. An outdoor balcony runs the width of the house, which has a gym and a spa and overlooks a garden.\nBrokers Joe Lucier and Stacey Caen of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty held the listing.\nIts sale doesn\u2019t come close to the home price record for San Francisco, set in July when Laurene Powell Jobs closed on a 17,300-square-foot mansion at 2840 Broadway for\n$71 million\n. In 2021, a home down the street from the Jewetts\u2019 sold for $43.5 million.\nThis year\u2019s official home price record belongs to a mystery buyer, who used an LLC for the off-market purchase on Jan. 31 of an 8,300-square-foot home at 260 Sea Cliff Avenue for\n$30 million\n,\nThe Real Deal\nreported. The seller was Douglas Shorenstein, former chairman and CEO of Shorenstein Properties.\nThe unofficial home price record in San Francisco belongs to\nSam Altman, who bought the Russian Hill home next door to his own\nfor what was reported to the multiple listing service to be\n$38.5 million\n\u2014 but listed in city records at $14 million.\nThis year ushered in a booming start for luxury properties in San Francisco, with a\n40 percent jump\nin luxury home, condo and co-op sales from a year earlier, according to the Business Times.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "A convoluted legal fight is brewing over a portion of the land underneath the Kimpton Surfcomber Hotel in Miami Beach.\nSean and Nicole Mirmelli, as trustees for the Deirdre Mirmelli Irrevocable Trust, sued Chisholm Properties South Beach last week in Miami-Dade Circuit Court over alleged violations of a 99-year-ground lease for one of two parcels beneath the three-story, 186-key\nArt Deco\nbuilding. The Mirmellis, who are siblings, want a court-appointed receiver to take over operation and management of the portion of the hotel site for which they have a joint 50 percent stake.\nThe sister and brother are seeking more than $20.5 million in damages, as well as a court order affirming cancellation of the ground lease and forcing Chisholm, led by Miami Beach hotelier\nRobert Balzebre\n, to cease operating the hotel, the lawsuit states. The complaint alleges Chisholm took out an unauthorized loan more than a decade ago without the Mirmellis\u2019 consent.\n\u201cMy clients grew up at the Surfcomber hotel,\u201d Joseph Pardo, Mirmellis\u2019 attorney, told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cImagine you woke up one morning and learned that your neighbor put a mortgage on a property that\u2019s been in your family for generations.\u201d\nIn a joint statement, Chisholm\u2019s attorneys Philippe Lieberman and Abbey Kaplan said the lawsuit has no merit.\n\u201cThe Surfcomber hotel is a great property that fell into disrepair when operated by the Mirmelli family,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAnd has since been brought back to iconic status because of Chisholm\u2019s great effort, hard work, and significant multimillion-dollar renovation that has enhanced the property.\u201d\n\nSince the mid-1990s, the Mirmellis have owned their 50 percent stake of a parcel at 1731 Collins Avenue that makes up half of the Surfcomber assemblage. Chisholm has owned the other 50 percent since 2004, records show.\nBalzebre\u2019s firm also owns the entire parcel at 1717 Collins Avenue that makes up the other half of the hotel site, as well as the building itself. Chisholm acquired both for $1.4 million, records show.\nThe Mirmellis, whose cousin\nAndrew Mirmelli\nis a prolific Miami Beach real estate investor, control the ground lease for the 1731 Collins Avenue lot that they co-own with Chisholm, records show. The lease was executed in 1948 by the original owners of the property when the hotel was built.\nIn 2011, Chisholm renovated the\nSurfcomber hotel\nand Kimpton took over management of the building. Three years later, Chisholm took out a $20.5 million loan with Bank of America secured by the hotel and both parcels.\nIn the lawsuit, the Mirmellis allege the mortgage was secured without their knowledge or consent, and that an estoppel letter attached to the loan with Nicole Mirmelli\u2019s purported signature is a forgery. In an affidavit attached to the complaint, she denies signing the document and said that she had never seen it until recently. An estoppel letter is a document that verifies the current status of a lease agreement.\n\u201cCounsel for Chisholm provided the [estoppel] certificate that is referenced in the complaint,\u201d Pardo said. \u201cWe did our homework and very quickly determined the certificate is not authentic.\u201d\nThe Mirmellis learned about the loan while conducting their due diligence for a pending deal to sell their stake in 1731 Collins Avenue, the lawsuit states. The mortgage, which holds first position, has placed a cloud over the title to the parcel, the Mirmellis allege.",

        "content": "Rialto Capital has found a new target in its aggressive pursuit to foreclose on borrowers of Signature Bank loans.\nRialto launched a foreclosure against Daryl Hagler\u2019s Cigar Factory creative office building in Astoria. Rialto alleges Hagler defaulted on a\n$20 million loan\nin October 2024. According to the lawsuit, Hagler, a health care entrepreneur, guaranteed the loan.\nPincusCo first\nreported\nthe news.\nIn 2023, Rialto, along with Blackstone and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, secured a\n20 percent\nstake in a venture holding Signature\u2019s $17 billion commercial real estate loan book. Rialto is tasked with servicing the debt.\nSince then, Rialto has embarked on a relentless pursuit of initiating defaults on property owners who had secured loans from the customer-friendly Signature Bank. At least one borrower, Joseph Cayre of Midtown Equities, filed suit against Rialto alleging the firm is illegally manufacturing defaults. (That suit was quickly settled).\nIn one case, Rialto initiated a foreclosure on Watermark Capital\u2019s 28-story, 497-unit residential project in Sunset Park last year. It was Hagler who stepped in as a lender and saved the project from foreclosure. Hagler provided a\n$42.5 million loan\nto Watermark, which replaced Rialto\u2019s loan.\nHagler was proud enough of the deal to put out a press release about it.\n\n\u201cMr. Daryl Hagler\u2019s swift action in replacing the debt allowed the project to proceed without further disruption,\u201d said the release.\nNow, Hagler \u2014 a co-owner of Centers Health Care and a vice chairman of El Al Airlines \u2014 is a target of\nRialto\n.\n\u201cWe are committed to engaging with borrowers to find the best resolutions possible. At the same time, we expect these sophisticated, commercial borrowers to honor the commitments they made,\u201d said a spokesperson from Rialto.\nHagler purchased the former DeNobili cigar factory at 35-11 9th Street for $26.4 million in 2022, marking a $5 million discount from what Bruce Brickman bought the 100,000-square-foot property in 2015.\nHagler is playing an increasingly active role in New York City real estate. He has backed Isaac Hager of Cornell Realty. The two partnered on a deal to acquire 960 Franklin Avenue in Crown Heights in Brooklyn for $42.8 million, which was sold in early 2024 for\n$64 million\n.\nHagler and his business partner, Kenneth Rozenberg, faced scrutiny from the New York Attorney General Letitia James for their oversight of nursing homes. The Attorney General\nsued\nthe partners in 2023, alleging they used more than $83 million in Medicaid and Medicare funds to enrich themselves. Hagler and Rozenberg settled for\n$45 million\n, with money going to improve resident care at the nursing homes.\nHagler did not return a request to comment.\n",

Dremonas\nfirst put the home on the market back in 2018\n, asking a whopping $21.9 million.\nThe home was later removed from the market and at least some of its space \u2014 perhaps its carriage house \u2014 listed for rent at a rate of $2,000 per month and, later, $4,000 per month, according to public listing information. It was last listed for sale publicly in July of 2019 at $19.5 million, but the listing was removed the following spring.\nNow, Dremonas is seeking $18.5 million for the home, or about $1,380 per square foot. The private listing\u2019s price tag makes it the second-priciest of any Chicago home listed publicly.\n\nThe mansion was built in 1888 by the architects behind the Chicago Opera House, according to a website used to market the property. It was an office for the Scottish Rite Cathedral from 1938 to 2006, receiving an historic landmark designation in 2003.\nThe home was last sold in 2009 to Dremonas for a little more than $3 million, records show. In 2009, \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d were invested into the mansion, renovating it to \u201cpreserve the original features while breathing new life into the home,\u201d the home\u2019s listing agent, Millie Rosenbloom of Baird &amp; Warner, said in a recent social media post. The total renovation cost was about $7 million, according to a 2018 Chicago Tribune\nreport\n.\nRosenbloom declined to comment on the listing Thursday. During Dremonas\u2019 previous attempt to sell, Coldwell Banker was the original listing brokerage.\nIts latest listing includes the mansion, attached three-car garage and a one-bedroom carriage house next door.\nCook County tax officials have pegged the property\u2019s value as high as $6.5 million in 2019, but have since lowered it to $4.8 million in its most recent assessments, public records show. Last year\u2019s tax bill at the property was a little more than $100,300, records show.\n",

        "content": "A push for density is reshaping the edges of Dallas.\nThe Dallas City Council approved development firm Henry S. Miller\u2019s plans to replace much of the aging Pepper Square shopping center in Far North Dallas with up to 868 apartments and several thousands of square feet of retail, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nThe measure passed 10-4 after clearing the City Planning Commission\nlast month\n, despite vocal opposition from dozens of nearby residents.\nThe 15.5-acre site at Preston and Belt Line roads will be redeveloped in phases, beginning with a four- or five-story residential building with parking, followed by a second building that could rise to 12 stories. A third phase would include two more mid-rise buildings.\nAltogether, the project could bring up to 67,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space, while preserving the southern portion of the site, where a Hobby Lobby and Trader Joe\u2019s will remain.\nThe rezoning marks a major milestone for the developer after more than two years of public meetings and scaled-down plans.\n\nMiller proposed more than 2,300 units in 2022 before cutting that number by more than half. The latest iteration also removes a previously proposed 116-unit mixed-income bonus but keeps 116 units designated for retirement housing.\nThe vote also adds to a growing list of approvals for large-scale multifamily developments in neighborhoods long dominated by single-family homes. The city is increasingly under pressure to add housing, and\nprojects like this one\nare being billed by proponents as essential to accommodating population growth and revitalizing aging commercial corridors.\nStill, the plan divided the community. More than 50 people signed up to speak at Wednesday\u2019s meeting, with nearly three-quarters opposing the project.\nCritics have cited traffic concerns, pressure on city services and changing neighborhood character. A traffic analysis by Kimley-Horn, commissioned by the developer, claims the new development would generate 50 percent fewer trips than the fully leased shopping center would.\nCouncil member Jaynie Schultz, who represents the district and supported the rezoning, called it one of the most difficult cases of her tenure, citing the political polarization and media attention surrounding the issue. She is not seeking reelection.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

The price was almost $1.6 million per acre.\nThe site previously housed several industrial and flex buildings. Riverbend Industries, a Chicago firm affiliated with one of Stack\u2019s development partners, was the seller.\nThe development will include a closed-loop water cooling system and be optimized for AI, machine learning and cloud workloads, Stack said.\nDemand for data storage fueled by artificial intelligence and cloud computing has been unrelenting. Industry professionals anticipate data center availability in top U.S. markets could all but disappear this year, and developers are racing to keep pace.\n\nThe O\u2019Hare-area market is one of the most competitive and supply-limited in the country, according to Stack.\nThe trend is reflected in other recent moves in Elk Grove Village, including Austin-based Digital Realty Trust\u2019s $900 million recapitalization of\ntwo data centers\nand a $185 million loan on a third. More recently, Virginia-based data center operator EdgeConneX\npaid $36.6 million\nfor two buildings at 821-891 Busse Road and the adjacent 901-985 Busse Road.\nLocal officials are embracing the shift. Elk Grove Village Mayor Craig Johnson said the project will bring jobs and \u201cresourceful development\u201d to one of the city\u2019s \u201cmost vital business corridors.\u201d\nChicago\u2019s suburbs have become a national hotspot for data center investment, particularly in repurposed industrial zones like the O\u2019Hare corridor.

The best way to reintroduce the district is through quality food and drink, Stream\u2019s Paul Bodenman said.\nStream is in talks with potential tenants, aiming to introduce businesses that can help transform the corridor into an 18-hour destination, starting with restaurants, and eventually adding other retail.\nThe firm, which began heavily acquiring properties on East Sixth in 2020, said leasing would open in\nJanuary last year\n. A year later, its tenant selection process is ongoing.\nThe company wants \u201chigh-quality operators,\u201d but not necessarily upscale dining, Bodenman said. A mix of local and national brands is expected, leveraging Austin\u2019s growing national profile.\n\nThis effort is a deliberate play for revitalization. The area was hurt by pandemic-era downturns and a mass shooting in 2021.\nRecent operational shifts show some early progress. The city reopened East Sixth to vehicle traffic from Thursday to Sunday evenings for the first time in decades. Preliminary police data shows a 21 percent drop in crimes against persons and an 11 percent decrease in arrests on weekend nights since the change.\nStill, trade-offs exist: the Pecan Street Festival, typically held on East Sixth, will move to Bee Cave this year due to the traffic change.\nStream has floated rebranding the area as \u201cOld Sixth,\u201d suggesting a desire to lean into the district\u2019s historic architecture and past status as a more rounded neighborhood destination.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Rent guidelines board season kicked off Thursday with the first of many temperature checks on the state of rent-stabilized housing, an asset class\ndrowning in distress.\nFor landlords praying for a lifeline in the form of a rent hike, the data isn\u2019t looking good.\nThis year\u2019s Income and Expense\nStudy\nfound buildings\u2019 net operating income \u2014\u00a0a measure of profitability \u2014\u00a0surged 8 percent between 2022 and 2023 when adjusted for inflation. (RGB data has a two-year lag time, a perpetual complaint of city landlords and their advocates.)\nDial in on the outer boroughs and Upper Manhattan, where distress has concentrated, and NOI grew 4.4 percent, according to the report \u2014\u00a0the first inflation-adjusted increase in four years.\nProperty owners, as in past years, called B.S. on the findings.\nFor starters, the New York Apartment Association, which represents rent-regulated owners, claimed the topline number includes over 120,000 free-market units. Many rent-regulated buildings were at least partially deregulated and contain a mix of market-rate and stabilized apartments.\n\u201cThe inclusion of these buildings distorts and confuses the data,\u201d NYAA CEO Kenny Burgos said. \u201cIt creates a warped perception that rent-stabilized buildings are doing okay, when the reality is that most are in severe financial distress.\u201d\nNYAA also said the analysis fails to break out inflation-adjusted data for properties outside of Core Manhattan and built before 1974. The RGB defines Core Manhattan as south of West 110th and East 96th Streets.\nThat older, outerborough product is more likely to be majority rent-regulated and therefore pulls lower rents, demands more repairs and is more likely to be distressed,\nrecent trades\nand\nforeclosures show.\nBy NYAA\u2019s math, NOI for that subset, which comprises 65 percent of the surveyed stock, slipped 2 percent between 2022 and 2023.\n\nBy borough, Bronx profits fell nearly 8 percent in the period, profits in Brooklyn by 0.2 percent, in Queens by 1 percent in Queens and in Northern Manhattan a little over 2 percent.\nThe Bronx is overwhelmingly rent-stabilized and its landlords are being\nthrottled\nby surging insurance costs.\nMeanwhile, RGB data showed inflation-adjusted NOI growth in Core Manhattan, where buildings popped 18.6 percent between 2022 and 2023. Those buildings are often newer, more recently stabilized at market rate and benefitting from a tax break, or if they\u2019re older, heavily deregulated.\nBefore the rent law banned the practice, owners deregulated units to reap the surging rents in the city. NYAA found pre-1974 buildings in the area, which are more likely to be deregulated, saw NOI jump 16.3 percent during the period.\n\u201cThis report shows a tale of two cities when it comes to regulated housing,\u201d Burgos concluded. \u201cThe data clearly shows disinvestment in these buildings from 2022 to 2023, which should alarm everyone.\u201d\nOne group seemingly unconcerned: tenant advocates.\nOn the heels of the report\u2019s release, Cea Weaver-led New York State Tenant Block claimed the RGB data supports a rent freeze, a demand\nechoed\nby rent-stabilized tenants every year since the pandemic.\nThe group argued the board has okayed three rent hikes in as many years and it\u2019s time for the members to throw tenants a bone.\nLandlords have repeatedly claimed that the hikes \u2014 7.75 percent in the last two and a half years \u2014 fail to cover inflation and the related surge in expenses, let alone needed renovations or mortgage payments, which are not calculated as part of NOI.\nBut the I&amp;E findings are only the beginning. There are still seven more reports, a slew of meetings and a preliminary hearing ahead of the board\u2019s final vote in June on adjustments for about half of the city\u2019s rental stock.\n",

        "content": "Pinnacle Housing Group\u2019s two-year-old apartment project near Fort Lauderdale\u2019s waterfront is hitting the market, and the listing brokers are expecting offers in the $50 million-plus range.\nMiami-based\nPinnacle\ncompleted Elyps, an eight-story building with 140 units at 2500 Southwest 22nd Terrace, in 2023, records show. The development firm is led by partners Louis Wolfson III, David Deutch, Timothy Wheat and Coraly Rodriguez.\n\u201cWe expect [Elyps] to trade in the low $50 million range,\u201d said Troy Ballard, a broker on the CBRE team marketing Elyps. \u201cThat makes it very attractive considering the [project] size with the waterfront nature. When someone buys [a waterfront multifamily project], they tend to hold on to them longer.\u201d\nPinnacle\u2019s business plan is to develop projects, stabilize them and move on to the next one, Ballard said.\n\nElyps, which overlooks Marina Bay Marina, is 94 percent leased with the average rent hitting $2,819 a month, according to CBRE The project offers a mix of one-, two- and three-bedroom units. Elyps is also designated as a\nLive Local Act\nproject, making it eligible for property tax credits on 100 units valued at $2,700 per apartment.\nElyps is the type of a mid-size multifamily project that expands the buyer pool beyond national institutional firms to include small family offices and high net worth real estate investors seeking a 1030 exchange deal, said Callum Weaver, another CBRE broker marketing the property.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very limited number of deals that trade with this number of units for new construction anywhere in South Florida,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cIt will check all of the boxes for a lot of different buyers.\u201d\nOverall, South Florida has experienced a handful of big-ticket multifamily trades through the first three months of the year. This month, Coral Gables-based Shoma Group sold Shoma Village, a mixed-use complex with 304 apartments, for\n$81 million\nto North Miami-based IMC Equity Group. In another March sale, insurance mogul Ivan Herrera\u2019s Unicapital Asset Management Group paid\n$71.5 million\nfor 850 Living, an eight-story, 230-unit multifamily project in Miami built in 2022 by the late developer Sergio Pino.\nLast month, Aventura-based BH Group dropped\n$83 million\nfor a waterfront complex of three 10-story buildings with 338 apartments in North Bay Village. And in January, Related Group and 13th Floor Investments, both based in Coconut Grove, acquired Arium Lincoln Pointe, a 285-unit property in Aventura, for\n$96.5 million\n.",

        "content": "A Presidio Heights home that hasn\u2019t changed hands in over 40 years went for more than $1 million over its $6.5-million asking, a sign that inventory-starved high-end buyers may finally be looking beyond turnkey properties \u2014 if the location is right.\nListing agent Ted Bartlett of Compass said that he and his co-listing agents Tina Bartlett Hinckley and Elizabeth Roeder \u201ccarefully priced\u201d 3333 Jackson, which had been in the same family for more than four decades.\nThe property was only on the market for eight days and received all non-contingent offers over asking from highly qualified buyers, he said. Bartlett said each prospective buyer was well represented by agents familiar with Presidio Heights and its local dynamics.\nBartlett did not name the sellers of the six-bedroom, four-bath 1913 Beaux Arts home, but property records show that it was owned by the Olness Family Trust and sold by the two sons of Richard and Susan Olness. The elder Olnesses both died in 2023 and Richard Olness ran his own eponymous real estate firm, according to their obituaries.\nCompass agent John Townsend repped the buyers and said that for years having a house in the city that needed \u201csome TLC\u201d was a \u201ctough sell.\u201d But buyer mindsets seem to be changing this year, he added. Townsend declined to name his clients but property records show it was Luke Ogelsby, a vice chairman at CBRE, and his wife Britt.\n\n3333 Jackson is \u201cquasi-livable\u201d as is, he said, which allowed potential buyers to \u201cchoose your own adventure as far as move in with minimal work and plan something later or do the big project.\u201d At nearly 5,000 square feet, any work could likely be done without a major expansion of the building envelope, making it a \u201cfar more manageable process.\u201d It has a prime location on a \u201ctop-ten block,\u201d with a relatively low price tag for the neighborhood, even with the overbidding.\n\u201cTo get a house of this scale on this block for under $8 million is difficult to say the least,\u201d he said, adding that it also has a walk-out south-facing yard, usable space in the basement and views from the top floor.\nTownsend said lack of inventory is pushing his buyers in Marin and San Francisco to offer\nhundreds of thousands of dollars\nover the asking price more and more often, even for fixers. Most are move-up buyers looking for their \u201cforever home.\u201d When you\u2019re looking at a long-term buy, he said, \u201cthe calculus changes as far as what you\u2019re willing to go after.\u201d\nTyler Stewart of Heath Real Estate, who recently represented the buyers on a\n$12.6-million deal around the corner\nfrom 3333 Jackson and also leads major renovation projects, agreed that the continued lack of inventory has made frustrated buyers feel like \u201cthey have no option but to build.\u201d\nConstruction prices are still high, averaging around $1,000 per square foot and upwards of double that for the kinds of high-end redesigns owners want in Presidio and Pacific Heights, she said. She anticipates that will only go up if the Trump tariffs on materials stay in place, and the high prices have put all her build out projects on hold.\nBut she said construction costs may be getting less important to long-term-minded luxury buyers who seem to be increasingly comfortable being \u201ca little in the red\u201d after their renovations, if they get the home they want, where they want it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re less worried about their return on investment, but they\u2019re realizing there is such a value to the quality of time that they get to spend at home, so if they end up overspending above what someone else would value their real estate at, they\u2019re okay with that,\u201d she said.\n",

He is incorrect on the law,\u201d Leitman Bailey said. \u201cWe will be expeditiously pursuing all remedies for our clients to regain the apartment as rent has not been paid and the lease has expired.\u201d\nAdam Turbowitz, an attorney for Arielle, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe two-bedroom, three-and-a-half bathroom apartment, spanning 3,700 square feet on the 59th floor, hit the market for rent about a month ago. The furnished unit is asking $55,000 a month with Serhant agents Marc Riedel and Jordyn Nusynowitz, according to\nStreetEasy\n. An availability date of April 1 is listed.\n\nRiedel as of November hung his license with Official Partners, the brokerage Tal and Oren founded with backing from white-label firm Side. (\nSide is also suing\nOren and Tal.)\nTal and his younger brothers, twins Oren and Alon, were all charged by the Southern District of New York with sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking.\nThe FBI raided Tal\u2019s apartment at 432 Park in December, the same day he was arrested at his parents\u2019 waterfront home in South Florida. Prosecutors said the raid\nturned up a hard drive\nwith videos and photos that showed Oren and Alon, along with unidentified third parties, \u201cengaged in sexual contact\u201d with women who appear to be intoxicated.\nProsecutors are expected to file a superseding indictment in the coming months that would likely include additional charges. FBI agents have spoken with about 60 women who say they were drugged and assaulted by one or more of the brothers over a period of time that spans over a decade.\nOren and Alon were also indicted in December by Miami-Dade prosecutors on charges of sexual battery, alongside their friend and former Official broker, Ohad Fisherman. Their trial is expected to occur later this year, as early as May. Fisherman\u2019s ankle monitor was recently removed,\nNBC Miami\nreported. Fisherman\u2019s attorneys argued his house arrest caused \u201csignificant harm\u201d to his \u201cdeeply held religious beliefs.\u201d\nThe Alexander brothers are also facing a number of civil lawsuits from women alleging they were drugged and assaulted.\nOn the business front, Tal and Official\nwere sued this week\nby the owners of a Soho penthouse. The plaintiff alleges it was defrauded of roughly $400,000 tied to the rental of an apartment at 54 Thompson Street.\n",

The impending exit, referenced in a Wednesday report from credit rating agency KBRA, equates to about a quarter of the space Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire has at the building, owned by Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge and RXR.\nFox agreed to an extension in January 2023 to stay at the property until 2042. The media empire\u2019s 1.2 million square feet there include Fox and News Corp.\u2019s corporate headquarters, as well as the New York Post and Wall Street Journal newsrooms and Fox News studio space.\nThe extension was announced as two separate long-term deals: Fox\u2019s 670,000-square-foot deal would begin in December 2025, while News Corp.\u2019s 485,000-square-foot extension would start two years later. But according to KBRA, the two entities agreed to a combined 924,000-square-foot extension through February 2042, allowing the rest of its 328,000 square feet to expire this coming November.\nCBRE\u2019s Mary Ann Tighe, who negotiated the lease extension on behalf of the tenant and said Fox\u2019s plans were known to the owner then, told Crain\u2019s that \u201cnothing has changed.\u201d The parent company of Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFox and News Corp. are expected to continue occupying half of the 1.9 million-square-foot property. Disney Streaming Services is expected to have its space sublet as it relocates to 7 Hudson Square.\nOccupancy at 1211 Sixth Avenue is expected to drop from 94 percent to 74 percent, according to KBRA, as law firm Ropes &amp; Gray is\nalso planning to leave\nbehind more than 300,000 square feet in approximately two years. The occupancy rate is expected to stabilize at 88 percent.\nIn January, Scott Rechler\u2019s RXR\nacquired a 49 percent stake\nin the building and embarked on a $300 million renovation plan, expected to last until 2028. Canadian pension fund Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec owns the majority stake.\nKBRA downgraded the $1 billion mortgage backing 1211 Sixth Avenue, citing the \u201cimpending decline in the property\u2019s occupancy.\u201d The mortgage is set to come due in August.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Their question: how FEMA can make sure stripping 6 inches of soil is enough to clear toxic substances from the blackened properties.\n\u201cThe residents of greater Los Angeles should be informed of any potential toxins in the soil as they navigate the complicated recovery process,\u201d the\nletter\nreads. \u201cWildfire survivors deserve to return to safe, toxin-free properties.\u201d\nThe Eaton and Palisades wildfires damaged or destroyed more than 13,500 properties across Los Angeles County. The resulting public health risks are too great to skimp on environmental testing, Friedman said.\n\u201cFEMA\u2019s refusal to test for toxins in the soil after wildfire cleanup in Los Angeles County is unacceptable,\u201d Friedman said in a statement. \u201cFamilies deserve to know their homes are safe and free of dangerous chemicals. This is a break from decades of FEMA precedent \u2014 and it risks exposing entire communities to long-term health threats.\u201d\nFederal cleanup crews have cleared ash and rubble from\nmore than 860 properties\n, according to the Army Corps of Engineers. About 200 rebuilding permits have been filed with local agencies \u2014 and a few have\nalready been approved\n, according to the Times.\n\nLos Angeles city and county officials say they won\u2019t require soil testing before issuing most rebuilding permits.\nWithout soil testing, many residents worry that new buildings could be built on contaminated land, increasing the likelihood that residents and workers may be exposed to toxic chemicals by inhaling airborne dust.\nEnvironmental and health officials have warned that wildfire ash from burned buildings can contain hazardous substances, including cancer-causing arsenic and brain-damaging lead. Experts warn that the pace of rebuilding shouldn\u2019t outpace necessary safety precautions.\nSoil testing in the aftermath of earlier wildfires found that a significant swath of properties still had excessive levels of heavy metals, even after cleanup crews removed a 3-to-6-inch layer of topsoil. They include the 2018 Camp fire in Northern California and the 2018 Woolsey fire near Malibu, which left properties where contaminants exceeded state standards.\nCleanup crews then returned to remove another layer of soil, and to conduct further soil testing, according to the Times.\nBut now FEMA officials insist that excavating 6 inches of soil from properties is enough to remove fire-related contamination. Anything deeper, they say, is likely to be preexisting contamination, which is beyond the agency\u2019s purview.\nThe federal agency encouraged state and local officials to pay for soil testing, if they believe it\u2019s necessary.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to show me definitive testing that shows that material below 6 inches is attributed to the fire or debris caused by the fire,\u201d FEMA Region 9 administrator Robert Fenton told the Times. \u201cI have not found that yet.\u201d\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Old Navy previously had the space. The shopping center owner declined to say when this year the new store will open.\nBloomingdale\u2019s and Ashkenazy Acquisition were each represented in-house in the deal.\nAshkenazy COO Joe Press said in a statement the addition of Bloomingdale\u2019s Outlet fits well with the center\u2019s focus on an \u201cin-demand niche in the retail market.\u201d\nThe 340,000-square-foot center has carved a spot for itself at the busy intersection of La Cienega Boulevard and 3rd Street with a tenant roster that\u2019s focused on off-price retailers.

Those locations range in size from a 24,000-square-foot location in Florida\u2019s The Avenue Viera center to a 31,000-square-foot store set for Pine Ridge Square, also in Florida. Both are slated to open in the fall.\n",

        "content": "Family offices are taking big swings in Chicago\u2019s distressed commercial real estate market, while many institutional investors are sitting on the sidelines. The family behind European alcohol giant Campari Group is leading the pack with no signs of slowing down.\nSince 2021, the firm has made over $100 million in real estate investments in Chicago across retail, office and multifamily.\nAlong with Chicago-based developer R2, Campari started construction today on the city\u2019s first publicly subsidized office-to-residential conversion, at 79 West Monroe.\nMilan-based Campari is known for spirit brands that include its namesake Campari as well as Aperol, Skyy, Grand Marnier and Wild Turkey.\nThe group\u2019s interest in Chicago comes as institutional lenders are holding back due high interest rates and Cook County\nproperty tax reforms adding uncertainty to the market\n.\nCampari\u2019s major deals in recent years include the $36 million purchase of Fulton Market food hall Time Out Market, the $21 million purchase of a boutique office building at 217 North Jefferson Street, and the $50 million spent to purchase 79 West Monroe.\nCampari Group bought the properties in cash and took mortgages out against them a few weeks later. The financing is not part of a broader strategy but gives the firm more flexibility in buying, said Massimilio Seliziato, director of Lagflin SCA, the Luxembourg-based entity overseeing the Campari family\u2019s investments and controlling shareholder of Campari Group.\n\n\u201cThey are jewels for us, and we really want to invest in them to preserve them,\u201d Seliziato said. \u201cWe know, of course, that they have a very strong connection to the city.\u201d\nAt 79 West Monroe, the developers plan to convert floors seven through thirteen into 117 residential units. The remainder of the 14-story property will be used for tenant amenities and mixed-use commercial space.\nThe adaptive reuse project is among the initial batch of properties to move forward as part of the LaSalle Street Reimagined initiative, a city-driven effort to revitalize the Loop by introducing more residential options in an area traditionally dominated by commercial spaces. The project is estimated to cost $64.2 million, with $28 million in property tax increment financing \u2014 a city-awarded subsidy that caps the cost of real estate taxes for over two decades \u2014 provided by LaSalle Street Reimagined.\nThirty-five percent of the units will be designated as affordable housing, slightly surpassing the city\u2019s requirements under the program.\nOther private investors are following Campari\u2019s lead, including other European-based family offices.\nAmancio Ortega, the billionaire founder of the Zara clothing retailer, paid more than $231 million for\na 492-unit apartment tower near Fulton Market\n, in\nthe priciest deal for any commercial property\nin Chicago in 2023.\nMore recently, the Maramotti family, which owns global fashion brand Max Mara,\nbought 41 East Oak Street\nin the ritzy Gold Coast neighborhood in late 2024. The Italian family bought the 5,000-square-foot retail building, which is leased to high-end retailer Bottega Veneta, for more than $17 million, or upward of $3,400 per square foot.",

        "content": "Federal funding delays have brought affordable housing projects across Illinois to a standstill, deepening uncertainty for developers already grappling with soaring construction costs and limited financing options.\nThe Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, a more than $1 billion Department of Housing and Urban Development initiative funded by the Inflation Reduction Act, has come under review by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, putting at least $52.5 million in grants for 15 Illinois projects in jeopardy, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nArcher Courts, a 146-unit apartment building at 2242 South Princeton Avenue in Chinatown, which was set to receive $11.7 million for green energy upgrades under the program.\nThat work is now in limbo after HUD terminated the contract of a consultant responsible for creating redevelopment plans, said Lauren Zullo of Jonathan Rose Companies, the project\u2019s developer.\nSeveral other projects, including a $39.5 million renovation of Corcoran Place and the $33.9 million Austin Renaissance complex, both in Chicago\u2019s Austin neighborhood, are also paused while developers await clarity from HUD. In some cases, work had already started, and developers are now uncertain whether they\u2019ll be reimbursed.\nA $14.5 million rehab at the Brainerd Senior Center, which had already closed on a $750,000 HUD loan, is considered more likely to receive funds, though developers say even that remains unclear.\n\nThe program\u2019s suspension follows mounting scrutiny from the Trump administration and billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, which has also targeted HUD\u2019s Fair Housing Initiatives Program.\nChicago-area nonprofits that previously received funding from the fair housing program had\ncontracts abruptly terminated\nor left pending, including at least 14 Continuum of Care organizations waiting on more than $112 million in unreimbursed HUD grants since January.\nHUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett defended the reevaluation, arguing the Biden-era emphasis on energy efficiency diverted resources from HUD\u2019s core mission. Local officials disagree, saying the funds help preserve hundreds of affordable units while improving quality of life for residents.\nAt stake is more than housing stock. Developers say project delays also threaten local jobs and destabilize future rehab efforts.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Kilroy Realty has settled a legal dispute that held up a 2.2-million-square-foot office campus atop the former Flower Mart in Central South of Market.\nThe Los Angeles-based developer settled mutual lawsuits with more than a dozen small business owners over who owned a private dead end alley, which for years had held up the 6-acre project at 610-698 Brannan Street,\nthe San Francisco Business Times reported\n.\nThe settlement, made official last month, will enable Kilroy to proceed with its plans to redevelop\u00a0 the Flower Mart at Brannan and 6th streets, while ensuring its neighbors retain their access, the court records say.\nA new cost and timeline for the development is not known.\nSan Francisco is in the\nfinal stages\nof creating a Central SoMa plan to allow developers to add more homes to office development proposals, if they so choose, according to the Business Times.\nIn 2014, Kilroy bought the Flower Mart site\nfor $70 million\n, with plans to build the 2.2-million-square-foot\noffice campus\nwith three buildings ranging from eight to 18 stories. The project was approved five years later.\nAfter years of negotiations by the real estate investment trust, the city\u2019s wholesale flower market uprooted itself late last year from its 66-year-old\u00a0 home in Central of South of Market to a\nnew home created by Kilroy\nat 901 16th Street, on Potrero Hill.\n\nMeanwhile, the San Francisco office market collapsed during a pandemic shift to remote work and Kilroy paused the redevelopment of the original collection of flower warehouses.\nThere was also an\nexchange of lawsuits\nover who owned its adjacent alley, considered key to both Kilroy and surrounding businesses. In total, Kilroy has spent $579 million on assembling a 6-acre development site.\nLast fall, Kilroy CEO Angela Aman said the\ndeveloper had no imminent plans\nto pivot away from building offices to replace the Flower Mart. The city\u2019s office vacancy now stands at 36.6 percent, according to CBRE.\nThis year, she said during an earnings call that Kilroy was redesigning the project to enable it to deliver in phases, while evaluating what mix of uses would be best for the site.\nKilroy, founded in 1996 by\nJohn Kilroy Jr.\n, has a real estate portfolio of 14 million square feet, including life sciences properties in the Bay Area, Seattle and San Diego, according to its website.\nLast month, Kilroy\nopened the second phase\nof its 3-million-square-foot Oyster Point life sciences campus in South San Francisco, now drawing financial and tech firms.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

When it doesn\u2019t succeed, they blame landlords or regulators \u2014 but never second-guess the choice to rely on rules instead of markets.\nTake the case of 2500 Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn.\nAt this 24-unit, rent-stabilized building, the landlord hasn\u2019t kept the tenants happy. He has little financial incentive to do so because the rents are capped at low rates. Tenants likely won\u2019t take their business elsewhere because finding better housing at the same price is\nvirtually impossible\n.\nMaybe the landlord,\nJonah Bamberger\nof Aulder Capital, is cold-hearted \u2014 which would be unusual for a graduate of the ultra-progressive Industrial and Labor Relations school at Cornell University, as he is. Maybe the regulated rents are just too low for him to upgrade the aging building or replace its balky boiler.\nWhich brings us to today\u2019s topic: What happens when the government eliminates market forces, only to have regulation fail in their place?\nThe pro-regulation crowd\u2019s answer is always more regulation. In this case, it\u2019s the\nAlternative Enforcement Program\n, which \u2014 as a last resort \u2014 allows the city to repair private property itself and bill the owner.\nThings got to that point at 2500 Bedford Avenue. But \u2014 and this may come as a shock \u2014 government takeovers don\u2019t always work.\nA spokesperson for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development said inspections at 2500 Bedford found improvements, notably adequate heat, after the city made repairs and fined the landlord $34,000. Yet, tenants still\nwent on a rent strike\nthis winter, citing cold apartments, leaks, mold, rats, electrical issues and fires.\n\u201cThe fines aren\u2019t working,\u201d said Rajiv Jaswa of Legal Services of NYC, one of the attorneys working with the tenants. \u201cIt\u2019s like the cost of doing business.\u201d\nIn fact, since the Brooklyn building entered into the Alternative Enforcement Program, Jaswa said, the violation count has actually increased. The two sides are now in court. Aulder\u2019s website says it is\n\u201crepositioning\u201d the property\n, which it acquired in 2015.\nJaswa blames the landlord, but the story of 2500 Bedford Ave is a reminder that when the government chooses regulation over market forces, and enforcement fails, customers cannot vote with their feet.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nCity Council members Robert Holden, Kristy Marmorato, Vickie Paladino, Joann Ariola, Susan Zhuang,\nInna Vernikov\nand David Carr, who comprise the Common Sense Caucus, are\nsuing on environmental grounds\nto stop the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity from taking effect. Do you consider these members environmentalists? Or, if you prefer to answer a different question: Will the City of Yes be good or bad for the environment? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Lawyers at Boies Schiller sued the city on behalf of building owners seeking compensation for sidewalk sheds that encroach on their property. The firm is seeking class-action status.\n\nElsewhere\u2026\nLuxury short-term rentals startup Rove, based in New York City, says its bookings tripled after a new city law drastically reduced Airbnb listings.\nBut why? The law cracked down on rentals of shorter than 30 days when the permanent resident is not present. Rove bookings are for 30 days or more, so it doesn\u2019t seem like an Airbnb competitor.\nOne possible reason that Rove\u2019s business surged is that visitors looking for short-term stays in luxury properties are booking Rove anyway and just not using the full 30 days of the rental.\nPreviously, they would have used Airbnb, but those listings are largely gone: In September 2023, the new statute knocked the platform\u2019s listings in the city\nfrom 23,000 to just 3,700\n.\nAlso, some hosts who had been listing on Airbnb surely moved their units to other platforms and required stays of at least 30 days to comply with city (and state) law. One aim of the law is to make more units available for regular tenants, but we have seen no data indicating success on that front.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Thursday was\n$28.5 million\nfor unit 19PHC at 730 Park Avenue. The Lenox Hill co-op apartment last sold in 2019 for $17.5 million.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$5.7 million\nfor a rental property at 51 West 71st Street. The Upper West Side apartment building is five stories, five units and 5,400 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $20 million for 7 MacDougal Alley. The Greenwich Village townhome is 4,000 square feet.\nCompass\u2019\nTim Malone has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 57,909-square-foot, 10-story, mixed-use building at 103 East 29th Street. Developer Impact Equities recently acquired the property, scrapping prior plans to build a hotel in favor of this 40-unit project,\nYimby\nreported. Michael Muroff of Michael Muroff Architect is the applicant of record.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

That includes residential developments in Bel-Air and Malibu among other places that are estimated to bring more than $100 million in listings in the back half of the year, according to Carolwood.\nJoining Partridge is director of operations\nMatthew Perrye\n, in addition to agents\nSkylar Saca\nand\nJessica Blafer\n.\nThe team\u2019s move is the latest swap in Los Angeles\u2019 luxury residential market, with the Beverly Hills Estates nabbing\nJacqueline Chernov\nand her team from Compass to help build out the brokerage\u2019s Pacific Palisades and broader Westside footprint.\nThe Beverly Hills Estates declined to comment on Partridge\u2019s departure.\nAmong Partridge\u2019s recent deals is his representation in December of buyer John Saca of Saca Development in the $44 million purchase of an office tower at 101 West Broadway in San Diego from the Irvine Company.\nPartridge\u2019s resume also includes listing 940 East Oakmont in Brentwood\u2019s lower Mandeville Canyon neighborhood, which was sold to filmmaker Simon Kinberg for $15.5 million in 2021. He also represented former Geffen Records CEO and Hallwood Media founder Neil Jacobson in the $8.5 million purchase of 1387 North Doheny Drive in West Hollywood, which was owned by \u201cAvatar\u201d star Sam Worthington.\n\nThe agent and Carolwood declined to comment on his team joining the brokerage.\nBallooning business\nPartridge Estates Group\u2019s addition comes as Carolwood lapped two years in business in November. The brokerage, started by Hilton &amp; Hyland alum\nDrew Fenton and Ed Leyson\n, said it had 2024 sales volume of $3.2 billion. That\u2019s double its production in 2023.\nEarlier this month, Carolwood nabbed a spot in Forbes Global Properties network. The invite-only listings site, which did not respond to a request for comment on Carolwood\u2019s addition, has a reach of 69 countries and more than 70 million U.S. visitors.\nSeveral heavyweights to the brokerage have also benefited Carolwood\u2019s business.\nLast year alone saw the addition of\nBond Street Partners\n, which is helmed by former \u201cMillion Dollar Listing Los Angeles\u201d cast members James Harris and David Parnes. In the summer, Bond Street added\nKevin Booker\n, who was previously at Westside Estate Agency.\nLisa Optican joined the brokerage in August as estates director, bringing with her nearly $139 million in off-market listings at the time.

It later upped the proposal to 210 units.\nPlans also call for adding a 7,100-square-foot lounge and swimming pool deck on the roof.\nA cost and timeline for the redevelopment were not disclosed.\nThe mid-century concrete building, designed by Welton Becket in 1965, has been an office fixture in Koreatown for more than half a century.

        "content": "Another Biden-era housing reform has been rolled back, and it could hit Chicago homeowners especially hard.\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development rescinded a rule that allowed property owners to request a second look at an appraisal if they believed it was racially biased, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe rule, created just last spring, enabled reconsideration of value requests when appraisals appeared to violate fair housing laws or nondiscrimination standards.\nHUD Deputy Assistant Secretary Jeffrey Little cited President Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 executive order to reduce regulatory burdens as the reason for the rollback. The revised policy removes any mention of race or equity, stating instead that requests for reconsideration of value can only be made if an appraisal failed to consider known factors at the time of evaluation.\nThe move dismantles one of the federal government\u2019s most recent efforts to address racial bias in home appraisals, a well-documented systemic problem.\n\nAppraisals for Black- and Latino-owned homes are often deflated due to the race of the homeowner or the neighborhood demographic, according to research from Brookings and Fannie Mae. That devaluation hinders home equity growth, a key avenue for wealth-building.\nThe reversal could have an outsized effect in Chicago, where appraisal disparities are among the nation\u2019s worst. Only Los Angeles had a wider gap in appraised values between white-majority and minority-majority neighborhoods in 2023, sociologist Junia Howell found.\nThe rollback adds to the wave of federal housing programs recently scaled back or placed under scrutiny.\nHUD has frozen funding for the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program \u2014 a climate-focused housing initiative \u2014 and abruptly\nterminated dozens of fair housing enforcement contracts\n, including several with Chicago-based nonprofits.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "The owners of the Signia by Hilton San Jose hotel have a month to dig up enough cash to pay off a $185 million mortgage loan, or lose the property to foreclosure.\nA Santa Clara County judge gave an owners group led by Sam Hirbod until May 1 to refinance the delinquent loan secured by the 541-room hotel at 170 South Market Street, in Downtown, the\nSan Jose Mercury News reported\n. Its owners had sued to delay foreclosure.\nSuperior Court Judge Shella Deen ruled to extend a temporary restraining order that blocks lender BrightSpire Capital from foreclosing on the hotel\u2019s loan. She said the delay would benefit the hotel owners, its lender, creditors and all its workers.\n\u201cThe court is concerned that failure to provide plaintiffs with at least an opportunity to secure a new lender could pose considerable risk of harm to the hotel, its staff and junior creditors that stand to lose their interest in the property in the event of foreclosure,\u201d Deen said in her order.\nThe judge ordered the Hirbod-led group to provide a status update on April 17.\nHirbod\u2019s ownership group bought the former 805-room Fairmont San Jose in 2018 for $223.5 million, then sank $75 million more into upgrades. BrightSpire Capital originated a\n$185 million loan\ntied to the property.\nThree years later, the hotel fell into bankruptcy and closed its doors, claiming business shutdowns and travel restrictions from the pandemic had ruined its bottom line. The hotel reopened in 2022.\nIn October 2023, Hirbod\u2019s San Ramon-based Eagle Canyon Capital sold the hotel\u2019s 13-story, 264-room south tower to Mill Valley-based Throckmorton Partners for\n$73.1 million, or $276,894 per room\n, which\nconverted it to student housing\nfor San Jose State University.\n\nEagle used the proceeds to pay down part of the BrightSpire loan. In August 2023, the hotel owner was\nclose to refinancing $165.3 million in debt\n.\nIn October, Hirbod said he\u2019d\ncut a financing deal\nto save the property from foreclosure. In all, he said his group poured $170 million into the hotel, according to court filings.\nThe hotel owner told the court he\u2019s got lenders now poised to pick up the slack. He said Bridge Investment Group and Nexpoint have agreed to a mortgage refinancing package, with the new lenders \u201care expecting to close refinancing in mid-April.\u201d\n\u201cBrightSpire will be paid 100 percent of the money it is due under the loan agreements,\u201d Hirbod said in the court filing.\n\u201cWe look forward to working with you on this transaction,\u201d Jeehae Lee, manager of Bridge Debt Strategies Fund, said in a March 10 letter detailing Bridge\u2019s term sheet.\nThe Signia by Hilton has boosted its bookings for conventions, events and guests, according to Hirbod. In October, the appraised value of the Signia by Hilton was $240 million, per a previous court filing.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

It sits just south of downtown and is the office of local uniformed federal police.\nThe building is part of a shorter list of properties up for sale after the GSA abruptly pulled down\na previous list earlier this month\nthat included more than 440 buildings across the country on the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s order\u00a0 \u2014 including\nthree in Houston\n.\nThe LaBranch property isn\u2019t on that broader list, which included the Mickey Leland Federal Building at 1919 Smith Street, the Houston Custom House at 701 San Jacinto and the Alliance Tower at 8701 South Gessner.\n\nThe new list, posted March 21, includes only eight buildings nationwide, including one\nin San Antonio\n. The initiative is part of an effort to reduce the federal real estate footprint and curb taxpayer spending on vacant or underused space, the GSA said.\nThe agency said it is accepting non-binding term sheets for the list of eight and that disposing of \u201cnon-core\u201d assets would allow investment in higher-quality workspaces aligned with federal agencies\u2019 needs.\nThe downsizing follows years of shifting office usage across the country, including the impacts of remote work.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Five years ago, a $120 million home sale in Miami Beach would have been unthinkable.\nThen came the pandemic, supercharging the market across South Florida. Billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin discovered Miami. Home prices surged. The demographic got younger and wealthier. And then, sales slowed a bit. Sellers were chasing numbers that were no longer realistic.\nRock bottom was last summer.\nYet, the market for waterfront homes \u2014 and land \u2014 is back, surging in recent months. In October, David and Victoria Beckham\npaid $72 million\nfor a mansion on North Bay Road, kicking off a flurry of activity on the street. Star, Palm, Hibiscus, the Venetians and Sunset Islands, La Gorce Island, and other pockets of Miami Beach also are on the upswing.\nIn North Beach, an oceanfront home in Altos del Mar sold for $36 million.\u00a0A mansion on Palm Island traded\nfor $45 million\nin February, less than a year after it sold for $40 million.\nAnd last month, billionaire developer Vlad Doronin sold his waterfront Star Island estate for\n$120 million\n.\nAll of these deals set new records for their respective neighborhoods. Doronin\u2019s trade set a benchmark for home sales across Miami-Dade County.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sort of blown away by these numbers, but it\u2019s becoming normal,\u201d said Douglas Elliman agent Oliver Lloyd. Lloyd represented the buyer, online gaming entrepreneur Richard Skelhorn, in the\nPalm Island sale\n, and he recently represented the seller in the $22 million sale of a waterfront teardown at 4744 North Bay Road.\nThe buyers are also big names, and \u201cmany of them\u201d are out looking, Lloyd said.\u00a0Doronin sold his house, a 22,000-square-foot six-bedroom estate with a pool, tennis court and dock, to a company tied to Michael Ferro, who leads the private equity firm Merrick Ventures. Sources told\nThe Real Deal\nthat Ferro is a straw buyer, and that Griffin, a close friend of Ferro\u2019s, is the real purchaser. If true, it would add to Griffin\u2019s massive holdings on Star Island.\nAfter brand mogul Anand Khubani paid $100 million for a 2.4-acre waterfront assemblage on La Gorce Island, he spent\nanother $40 million\nin December to acquire the recently completed waterfront estate at 5970 North Bay Road. Billionaire Jamie Salter, founder, chairman and CEO of Authentic Brands Group, sold the mansion. It spans 14,520 square feet with six bedrooms, two staff rooms, a home office, movie theater, wine room, game room, wellness center and pool on the second floor.\nJan Koum\n, the billionaire founder of WhatsApp has also been quietly shopping for a mansion.\n\u201cThe money in Miami is a little less conservative, just based on the time frame of their wealth,\u201d said spec home developer Todd Michael Glaser, comparing it to the generational wealth of buyers in the competing market of Palm Beach.\nKick-starting momentum\nColdwell Banker\u2019s Danny Hertzberg, part of The Jills Zeder Group, said the Beckhams\u2019 purchase brought attention back to North Bay Road, and started a domino effect. Hertzberg was involved in the\n$35.5 million sale\nof billionaire hedge fund manager Dan Loeb\u2019s waterfront home at 6440 North Bay Road, which closed in December.\n\n\u201cEach sale set off a chain reaction,\u201d Hertzberg said. \u201cIt was a combination, to be fair, of many properties adjusting their prices.\u201d\nPrice reductions last year brought buyers back into the fold. Once many of the priciest turnkey homes sold, bidding wars ensued for properties that had previously been sitting on the market, said Corcoran Group agent Julian Johnston. Now that the\nelection\nhas passed, uncertainty that held up deals is gone, brokers say.\n\u201cEveryone else started buying because they saw inventory is disappearing,\u201d Johnston said.\nBecause of this, buyers will ask their agent to find something off-market. This has a couple of advantages for buyers and sellers, agents say.\n\u201cPrivacy is big. People don\u2019t want photographs of their houses online,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cThey want it shopped very quietly to a select group of people to see if they can take advantage of what\u2019s going on right now.\u201d\nDeveloper James Curnin said he didn\u2019t plan to sell his waterfront La Gorce Island mansion. He and his wife Jennifer spent four years building the property, which they ended up selling in March off-market\nfor $60 million\n. Brokers were \u201cconstantly reaching out,\u201d Curnin previously said. Jordan Karp brought the winning buyer.\nSpec developers are back\nMick Duchon, a Corcoran Group agent, said a few properties are asking more than $80 million off-market, and developers are included among prospective buyers. They had, for a while, backed away from the market due to the cost of land and construction.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a few developers that have successfully built and developed homes [who] continue to show interest in North Bay Road,\u201d Duchon said.\nIn the past, celebrities like Dwyane Wade, Phil Collins, Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez, Matt Damon and Billy Joel owned waterfront homes on North Bay Road. Even though celebrities continue to buy homes, it\u2019s the billionaires and the developers courting them who are now taking over.\nDeveloper Glaser, who publicized his move to Palm Beach about three years ago, is busy again in Miami Beach. Glaser is in contract to acquire the 2.3-acre property at 5940 North Bay Road for $105 million. Developer Sonny Kahn, a founding partner at Miami-based Crescent Heights, and his wife Suzanne are selling the mansion. The sale is expected to close in May.\nGlaser and his partners may try to flip the property for about $150 million. But Glaser prefers to redevelop the waterfront lot into a spec mansion that could hit the market for $300 million.\nNelson Gonzalez of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty, who plans to list the house, said the street is \u201creally the Who\u2019s Who of anyone who has purchased on Miami Beach,\u201d calling it the city\u2019s version of Park Avenue.\nGlaser said he hopes to redevelop the property into the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d of homes.\n\u201cPeople are starting to really get comfortable with that $100 million-plus sale,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like 40 years ago when the $1 million house sold. They oohed and aahed.\u201d\n",

        "content": "David Childs, the visionary architect who designed the iconic 1 World Trade Center, died on Wednesday in Pelham, New York. He was 83.\nThe cause of death was Lewy body dementia, his wife Annie told\nThe New York Times\n. Childs was a principal at the renowned architectural firm Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, where he was the only partner to serve twice as chair.\nBorn in Princeton, New Jersey, on April 1, 1941, Childs found his calling in architecture after a lecture by architectural historian Vincent Scully while studying at Yale. He shifted from zoology to architecture, earning his master\u2019s degree in 1967.\nHis most notable work, 1 World Trade Center, became a powerful symbol of resilience, rising where the Twin Towers once stood. Standing at 1,368 feet, the building was both a memorial and a testament to urban renewal. It was one of the most fraught design processes in city memory, working through five iterations before being finalized.\nThroughout his career, Childs designed numerous recognizable buildings in Manhattan, including 7 World Trade Center, the Time Warner Center and\n35 Hudson Yards\n. He was known for his versatility, rejecting a signature style in favor of designs that responded to each project\u2019s unique context.\n\u201cI know a lot of what I\u2019ve designed is not \u2018A\u2019 work,\u201d Mr. Childs admitted to the Times in 2005. \u201cBut my role was different. I wanted to raise the level of everyday development as much as I could.\u201d\n\nChilds is survived by his wife, Annie; children Joshua, Nicholas and Jocelyn; six grandchildren; and a sister, Ellyn Allison. His son Joshua saved his life in 2016 by donating part of his liver for a critical transplant.\nWhen speaking to\nThe Real Deal\nfor\nThe Closing interview\nin 2011, Childs reflected on 1 World Trade Center.\n\u201cIt does achieve many of the very largest goals originally set for it, which have to do with being in the New York tradition, a marker in the sky for the most important building down there, which is the memorial,\u201d Childs said.\nHe added, \u201cIt was very meaningful to us, and cathartic in a way, to be working on a project that we saw destroyed.\u201d\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "\u201cSouth Florida by the numbers\u201d is a web feature that catalogs the most notable, quirky and surprising real estate statistics.\nIn his recent State of the State address, Gov. Ron DeSantis formally proposed an idea he had been pitching for weeks: eliminating property taxes in Florida, which would make the Sunshine State the first in the nation to do so. Under his proposal, voters would decide the matter in 2026, just before his second and final term ends in January 2027. Is this proposal a serious attempt to bring significant financial relief to homeowners, a way to further cement his impactful legacy, or a springboard to higher office? And how will public schools and municipalities make do with billions of fewer dollars? We explore in this edition of \u201cSouth Florida by the numbers.\u201d\n$55 billion\nEstimated shortfall that the removal of property taxes would create for Florida school districts and local governments. Most of that money ($33.7 billion) goes to government and social programs like police, firefighters and jails. The rest, $21.5 billion, goes to schools. The amount of property taxes raised in Florida has doubled over the past decade.\n[MiamiHerald]\n$40 billion\nAccording to the Florida Policy Institute, the estimated amount of revenue that could be generated if Florida were to double its 6 percent sales tax to 12 percent, which would be the highest in the nation. But DeSantis has already ruled out signing into law an increase in state sales taxes to cover the cost of services currently paid for by property taxes.\n[SunSentinel]\n\n20\nFlorida\u2019s U.S. rank in the category of most expensive homeowners\u2019 median property tax amount, at $3,100. But some Florida homeowners have seen some of the nation\u2019s largest property tax hikes in recent years. In Broward County, median property taxes have jumped 57 percent since 2019, an annual increase of $1,619 and the biggest percentage gain in the nation. Home prices in Broward are up nearly 60 percent in the same period. (Property taxes in Miami-Dade County have also risen sharply, gaining 50 percent since 2019, while home values have gained 59 percent.)\n[Realtor.com]\n40 percent\nAverage increase in Florida property tax revenues over the last four years, prompting some lawmakers to sponsor other relief bills for homeowners \u2014 including one that would install a $100,000 exemption on all homesteaded and non-homesteaded properties.\n[Tallahassee.com]\n2\nNumber of hypothetical \u201ctiers\u201d recently suggested by DeSantis as a layer to his proposal, wherein Florida\u2019s tax burden could be absorbed by tourists and foreigners. Recognizing that such a system would disproportionately benefit high tourism areas (specifically mentioning Broward and Miami), he assured rural voters that tax revenue would be allocated accordingly.\n[FloridaPolitics]\nThis column is produced by the Master Brokers Forum, a network of South Florida\u2019s elite real estate professionals where membership is by invitation only and based on outstanding production, as well as ethical and professional behavior.",

        "content": "Following a busy South Florida two-year buying binge, Longpoint shed a warehouse near Miami Gardens for $43.5 million.\nAn affiliate of Boston-based\nLongpoint\n, led by founding partner Dwight Angelini, sold a nearly fully-leased 221,471-square-foot warehouse at 1400 Northwest 169th Street in unincorporated northwest Miami-Dade. The buyer is New York-based Corebridge Real Estate Investors, led by CEO Douglas Tymins, according to a press release.\nThe deal breaks down to $196 per square foot.\nA CBRE team led by Jos\u00e9 Lob\u00f3n and Trey Barry represented Longpoint, which sold the property for a nearly $15 million gain. In 2021, Longpoint paid $28.9 million for the 11.2-acre site, records show. The building was completed in 1969.\nThe warehouse is within the Sunshine State Industrial Park, an industrial complex spanning five million square feet, the press release states.\n\nLongpoint has been among the most active institutional buyers of South Florida industrial real estate. In November, Longpoint picked up a 26-property warehouse portfolio across Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties for\n$331.3 million\n, representing South Florida\u2019s largest industrial purchase of\n2024\n. Blackstone was the seller.\nIn September, Longpoint paid\n$27.2 million\nfor three warehouses in Medley, nine months after acquiring three other facilities in the same town and another trio of industrial properties in Doral for\n$30 million\n.\nLongpoint also notched South Florida\u2019s largest industrial buy of 2023 when the firm paid\n$262 million\nfor a 25-building industrial portfolio in Miami-Dade and Broward in December of that year.\nPrior to its recent acquisition, Corebridge previously acquired an industrial facility in Miami Gardens for\n$25.5 million\n. The warehouse is fully leased to Moishe Mana, one of the largest land and commercial real estate property owners in Wynwood and downtown Miami.\nCorebridge has $10.1 billion in real estate assets under management, according to the firm\u2019s website.",

Ashkenazy and Bloomingdale\u2019s represented themselves in the deal.\nThe strip mall, across the street from the Beverly Center mall, contains other discount retailers such as Saks Off Fifth, Nordstrom Rack, T.J. Maxx and Ross Dress for Less.\nAshkenazy bought the two-story, 340,000-square-foot mall in 2014 for $260 million, or $765 per square foot. He financed it with three commercial mortgage-backed securities loans from Citigroup totaling\n$210 million\n, according to CO.\nAlongside the senior loans, the investor added $35 million in unsecuritized subordinate debt secured by the property, according to Morningstar.\n\nThen the pandemic struck five years ago, and brought a plunge in foot traffic. Ashkenazy began skipping loan payments.\nSince 2020, its three CMBS loans have been managed under a special servicer, according to CO. Three years later, Ashkenazy struck a reinstatement agreement, but the debt stayed with the special servicer.\nThe value of the strip mall just fell 10 percent. This month, the property was appraised at $193 million, down from its previous appraised value of $214 million, according to Morningstar.\nAshkenazy, meanwhile, has been fighting uphill on its own turf.\nThis month, a New York judge issued a scathing decision against the investor in a Union Station legal case, saying he \u201chad sufficient resources to repay the loan but chose not to.\u201d\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "River Forest developer Marty Paris is once again in court, this time not as a defendant, but a plaintiff.\nParis sued two of his former divorce attorneys for malpractice, accusing them of abandoning him on the eve of trial and later conspiring to collect fees that helped land him in jail.\nParis, founder of Sedgwick Development, sued attorneys Brian Hurst and Olga Stambler, along with their firm Hurst, Robin, Kay &amp; Allen, as well as attorney Howard Rosenfeld and his firm Rosenfeld Farmer, the Cook County Record\nreported\n.\nThe lawsuit alleges a breach of legal ethics, claiming the lawyers improperly switched sides and worked against Paris after having previously represented him in his long-running divorce case.\nParis claims Hurst backed out of representing him just before trial in 2022, leaving him without counsel during a critical phase. That trial ended with a judgment that left Paris on the hook for millions of dollars in legal fees and settlement costs \u2014 including $1.19 million to his ex-wife and another $1 million in legal bills.\nHe was jailed three times during the proceedings, including over the 2023 holiday season, after judges found him in civil contempt for not paying court-ordered fees.\n\nThe lawsuit argues Paris was unfairly targeted and the jailings were part of a \u201cdebtors\u2019 prison\u201d scheme meant to squeeze him. The financial demands far exceeded his liquid assets, and revenue from his developments had been mischaracterized as personal wealth, it states. Judges disagreed, estimating his net worth at more than $20 million.\nThe lawsuit adds a new wrinkle: Paris alleges that Hurst not only joined efforts to collect legal fees from him, but also began representing Rosenfeld \u2014 a court-appointed attorney for Paris\u2019 children \u2014 in a separate claim for $229,000. That violated legal ethics rules, Paris alleges, since Hurst had previously been his attorney and did not disclose his prior relationship with Rosenfeld.\nThe allegations follow ongoing legal and financial troubles for Paris, who is also fighting Republic Bank over a\n$52 million loan default\ntied to a stalled River Forest condo project.\nA bankruptcy court dismissed Paris\u2019 personal bankruptcy case in January, removing protections that had previously shielded him from creditors. One lender, BDS IIII Mortgage Capital, has since demanded nearly $10 million from Paris, according to a February court filing.\nParis is representing himself in the lawsuit. Hurst and the other defendants have yet to respond in court.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

Pricing was not disclosed.\nThe portfolio sale marks Wanda\u2019s full exit from the Jeanne Gang-designed skyscraper at 363 East Wacker Drive.\nWanda originally invested in the 101-story project in 2016 alongside Chicago-based Magellan Development Group, intending to debut its first U.S. hotel under the Wanda Vista brand. But after Chinese regulations on overseas investment\ntightened\n, Wanda sold its 90 percent stake to Magellan for $270 million in 2020.\nThis latest sale follows a bulk deal last November, when GD Holdings\nbought 84 units for $117 million\n, an average of $3.16 million per unit.\n\nThe St. Regis also includes a 192-key hotel operated by Marriott International under its luxury St. Regis Hotels &amp; Resorts brand. The hotel, owned by GD Holdings and Miami-based Gencom, opened in May 2023. The condos opened to residents in 2020.\nWanda\u2019s 37 units were never listed individually prior to this, and the sale could shake up the high-end condo market downtown, where sales have been slower in the years since the pandemic.\nThe tower has seen a flurry of deals so far this year, including\none of the year\u2019s priciest\n, for two 52nd floor units at just under $9 million last month.\nJust 19 units at the tower are listed publicly, with asking prices ranging from under $1 million to $8 million. Seven have sold so far this year, according to data from Homes.com.\nWith Wanda\u2019s impending departure, the tower \u2014 once a symbol of Chinese investment in U.S. real estate \u2014 is now firmly under domestic ownership. But the bulk sale could test market appetite at the top end, at a time when high-rise luxury living in downtown Chicago has yet to fully recover.\n\n\u2014 Judah Duke",

The Dallas resort could be a model for how cities can blend public space, tourism and economic development, he said. Council Member Jesse Moreno, who represents the area, said the project could generate $2 billion in tax revenue over 30 years, funds he hopes will boost city services and public safety.\nTherme\u2019s vision includes a retractable glass roof, swim-up bars and environmentally friendly infrastructure like geothermal heating and 80 percent water recycling. A zoning change is required, and construction could begin as soon as 2027 following city approval.\nThe land is owned by Matthews Southwest, which controls surrounding parcels and part of the Water Commons. Therme has a purchase agreement contingent on entitlements, and city staff are expected to review financial incentives in the coming year.\nIf built, Therme Dallas would be the company\u2019s first U.S. location. The company plans to bring 10 wellness resorts to the United States over the next decade.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

Peisach leads Category Five with his brother, Mike Peisach.\n\u201cOur bread and butter are Class C multifamily projects,\u201d Peisach said. \u201cWe do a light to medium value-add such as replacing the roofs and putting in new vinyl floors, granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, etc.\u201d\nOnce renovations are completed at its recently acquired properties, Category Five can raise the rents by about 10 percent from the current average of $1,800 a month, Peisach said. The complexes are in unincorporated northwest Miami-Dade, bordering\nMiami Shores\nand\nNorth Miami\n.\nCategory Five acquired Blue Lake Apartments, a complex of four one-story buildings with 106 units completed 1991, in an off-market deal that also involved the buyer assuming an existing loan, Peisach said. The purchase price breaks down to $273,584 per apartment.\n\nThe seller, an entity managed by Aventura-based investor Leon Ojalvo, obtained an $11.8 million loan from Bank Leumi when he bought the 6.4-acre site for\n$15 million\nin 2021, records show.\nA Berkadia team led by Yoav Yuhjtman brokered the deal for Lake Shore Presidential Apartments, a collection of four three-story buildings with a total of 90 units, completed in 1966, Peisach said. The deal breaks down to $200,000 per unit.\nThe seller, an entity managed by Jacob Shakibpanah in Aventura and FIP Realty Services, also based in Aventura, paid $9.8 million for the complex in 2006, records show.\nEstablished in 2021,\nCategory Five\nhas been on a buying binge since late 2023 when the firm picked up a six-building apartment complex in Deerfield Beach for $24.6 million. The portfolio has grown to 600 units and includes three more properties in Pompano Beach, Launderhill and Miami\u2019s Little River neighborhood, Peisach said.\nIn addition to renovations, Category Five also installs camera security systems, and in some cases, adds amenities such as children\u2019s playgrounds, Peisach added.\n\u201cThe assets we just closed on are in a really great area,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the bones of the buildings are very good. You essentially have well-built concrete bunkers on lakes, which makes both properties very attractive.\u201d",

        "content": "The National Association of Realtors is slashing jobs at its longtime Chicago headquarters as it attempts to rebuild after scandal and structural upheaval.\nThe nation\u2019s largest trade group said Friday it would cut 61 positions nationwide, including 37 in Chicago, as part of a broader reorganization strategy, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe move represents nearly 17 percent of its total workforce. NAR had about 200 employees in Chicago as of last year, meaning the cuts represent nearly a fifth of its local staff.\nThe eliminated roles were in communications, human resources, finance and IT, a spokesperson said.\nThe cuts follow a wave of turmoil that began fall 2023 after an investigation into\nallegations of sexual harassment\nled to resignations from two successive presidents, the\nouster of longtime CEO Bob Goldberg\nand mounting internal scrutiny.\nNykia Wright, the former Chicago Sun-Times CEO who was brought on to guide the organization through the fallout, was later named CEO of NAR and completed her senior leadership team and, earlier this month, hired Matthew Cenedella as CFO, according to a news release.\nThe trade group has also been hit hard by legal and reputational blows. In October 2023, a federal jury came to a $1.78 billion verdict in an antitrust lawsuit, finding that NAR and several major brokerages had conspired for decades to inflate commissions.\n\nThe verdict prompted a sweeping industry shakeup, with NAR ultimately settling the case and agreeing to overhaul commission standards; the new required practice changes\nkicked in last August\n, though\nthe industry is split\non the full effect of its consequences.\nEarlier this month\n, a survey found NAR to be among the least-liked organizations in the industry, viewed negatively by a majority of real estate professionals and the public.\nFounded in 1908, NAR has called Chicago home for more than a century.\nIts headquarters remain at 430 North Michigan Avenue, but the scope of its presence in the city could shrink further as restructuring efforts continue.\nThe organization also maintains an office in Washington, D.C., where four positions are being cut. Another 20 vacant positions across its offices will be eliminated as well.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "It may be checkout time for Aby Rosen at\nanother one\nof his hotel properties.\nRosen, Michael Fuchs and their company RFR Holding are battling with landlord Commerz Real in three separate lawsuits over the Soho luxury hotel\n11 Howard\n.\nThe\nGerman asset manager\nfiled a petition in February to evict RFR from the 211-room hotel; A hearing is set for April 3. A new lawsuit filed this week by the landlord claims RFR owes more than $18 million in back rent, taxes, insurance and other costs.\nMeanwhile, RFR alleges in another complaint filed in January that Commerz violated its lease agreement by \u201cshopping the property around\u201d to potential buyers despite RFR\u2019s contractual right of first offer to buy the building, according to a separate lawsuit filed by RFR.\nA spokesperson for RFR declined to comment. Lawyers for Commerz did not respond to a request for comment.\nRFR bought the 114,500-square-foot, 14-story former Holiday Inn from Procaccianti Group in 2014 for $89.7 million. It says it spent \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d to renovate the building. The upscale hotel opened in 2016.\n\nA week after opening, Commerz bought the hotel from RFR, which included an agreement to lease the building back from the landlord for 10 years with options to extend for another 10 years and ultimately buy the building back. If RFR were to exercise its repurchase option, the Commerz investment would end up as a de facto loan.\nIn its lawsuit, RFR claims Commerz \u201cwas happy to watch [RFR] turn its building into a luxury property,\u201d then used \u201cdefective default and termination notices\u201d in order to undermine RFR\u2019s right of first offer.\nThe landlord sent RFR its first nonpayment notice in October 2023.\nCommerz, meanwhile, claims RFR racked up $18.1 million in unpaid rent and related costs by the end of January. It sent a 15-day lease termination notice on Feb. 11. In this latest suit, it is seeking to collect the money, including $2.8 million in real estate taxes that it says Rosen and Fuchs jointly guaranteed.\nAfter a rough 2024, the year has gotten off to a rocky start for Rosen. A Manhattan judge in January ruled that RFR\u2019s ground lease with Cooper Union at the iconic Chrysler Building\nwas terminated\nand ordered Rosen\u2019s company\nejected from the property\n.\nBut RFR closed in February on a\n$1.2 billion CMBS loan\nto refinance the Seagram Building at 375 Park Avenue and\nalso recapitalized\n475 Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan after facing a foreclosure threat from its lenders.\n",

Its occupancy at the time of sale was not disclosed.\n\nThe sale marks a 79 percent drop in value since just before the pandemic ushered in a broad shift to remote work, and a relative collapse in the office market across the U.S.\nView Pointe bought the office building from Lincoln Property Group in 2023 for $15.5 million.\nLincoln Property, based in Dallas, purchased it in 2019 for $74.3 million, or $1,093 per square foot.\nOffice vacancy in South OC in third-quarter 2024 was\n13 percent\n, \u201cas a variety of tenants moved into the submarket,\u201d according to CBRE.\nEarly last year, the office vacancy across Orange County hovered at\n19.6 percent\n, with 18 million square feet of empty workplaces, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield.

        "content": "The lender behind a troubled conversion in downtown San Antonio is asking a bankruptcy judge to take the project out of the owner\u2019s hands, citing mounting debt, mold damage and \u201ca pipe dream\u201d of a business plan, the San Antonio Express-News\nreported\n.\nRiverwalk Reposition Partners, an LLC that holds a $14.4 million note on 145 Navarro Street, blasted the building\u2019s owner, an affiliate of Blueprint Hospitality, in a recent court filing.\nThe affiliate defaulted shortly after refinancing the former CPS Energy headquarters, which it bought in 2021 for $19 million with\nplans to convert it\ninto a 243-room Marriott Autograph Collection hotel called El Portal.\nThe lender accused the borrower of failing to meet basic financial obligations, including paying 2024 property taxes, maintaining insurance and covering utility bills, which has left the building without electricity. Contractors and suppliers have filed about $8 million in liens while a flooded basement has led to mold growth, which has yet to be remediated.\n\u201cThis case is directionless,\u201d the lender\u2019s attorneys wrote, asking a judge to either dismiss the bankruptcy entirely or appoint a trustee with hotel development experience to take over. They described a consistent pattern of \u201cexcuses\u201d and said the company failed to offer any viable business plan.\n\nThe Blueprint affiliate filed for bankruptcy in February, listing $3 million in assets and $29.4 million in liabilities, and initially assigned no value to the Navarro Street building. The company later revised its filings, stating the property is worth $46.7 million and its total assets at $49.7 million.\nThe developer\u2019s attorney told the court they are working on organizing the company\u2019s books and securing debtor-in-possession financing to continue operations through reorganization. But the lender\u2019s attorneys said they\u2019ve received little useful information and aren\u2019t willing to extend financing without clearer oversight.\nBankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez, who denied a motion to move the case to San Antonio, will hear arguments in April on environmental remediation and potentially appointing a chief restructuring officer. The lender originally appeared on the creditor list both as secured and unsecured, but was removed as an unsecured creditor in the revised documents.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Thursday brought the beginning of\nrent guidelines\nboard season, pitting landlords and tenants of rent-stabilized housing against one another. This year\u2019s Income and Expense Study found buildings\u2019 net operating income \u2014 a measure of profitability \u2014 jumped 8 percent between 2022 and 2023 when adjusted for inflation.\nProperty owners claim the study\u2019s findings are distorted by the inclusion of irrelevant buildings. Tenant advocates, meanwhile, argue the takeaways of the report support a rent freeze.\nA major legal challenge emerged to the\nCity of Yes\nfor Housing Opportunity (which could impact the other City of Yes initiatives). More than 100 groups, City Council members, community board members and state lawmakers are asking a state court to annul the City of Yes, particularly the final rezoning expected to add 80,000 homes over the next 15 years.\nThe lawsuit, filed in Staten Island court on Wednesday, alleged that Eric Adams\u2019 administration violated city and state environmental laws by failing to do a comprehensive review of the impact of the zoning changes. A City Hall representative said the administration stands by its process.\nThis week,\nEliot Spitzer agreed to sell\na large Upper East Side rental building to Miki Naftali for over $800 million. The 208-unit property was previously marketed as a potential high-end condo development opportunity.\n\nNaftali is known for condo projects and may convert the rental building into condos, given his development history in the area. A firm plan for the property at 800 Fifth Avenue has yet to emerge, though, as the deal has also yet to close.\nNaftali can\u2019t have buyer\u2019s remorse yet. The same can\u2019t be said for the buyer of an $80 million penthouse at 520 Park Avenue, who is suing the Zeckendorf developers for fraud, alleging they failed to disclose a planned skyscraper by Extell Development that would obstruct the penthouse\u2019s Central Park view.\nThe lawsuit claims the Zeckendorfs were desperate to sell the penthouse and withheld information due to their status as real estate insiders and previous difficulties selling other units in the building. The buyer wants to rescind the sale and aims for potential damages, arguing the offering plan did not disclose the specific risk of obstruction, despite a general disclosure about potential view changes.\nAnd in Astoria, KS Group landed $300 million in construction financing to revive the long-stalled Astoria Cove project in Queens, planning to deliver more than 2,800 units across three phases.\nThe project, which dates back to 2014, faced previous financing issues and affordable housing disputes but is moving forward with mixed-use buildings, residential towers and commercial space.\n",

        "content": "Two bills backed by a landlord group aim to fill vacant rent-stabilized apartments.\nOne would allow some rent-stabilized owners to collect the full voucher amount even when the regulated rent is less than the allowable rental assistance. The\nmeasure\n, introduced this week by Sen. Leroy Comrie, would create a pilot program that would allow owners of stabilized apartments registered as vacant in 2025 to collect the full voucher amount.\nThe idea is that the promise of additional rent could help owners renovate long-vacant units and rent them out. To qualify, a building must be constructed pre-1974.\nThe pilot would apply to local, state and federal rental assistance, and would expire in 2027.\nSen. Zellnor Myrie, who is running for mayor, pitched a similar program as part of his housing platform. Tenant groups were not happy, saying it would \u201cundermine rent stabilization.\u201d Their concern is that it could incentivize landlords to push existing tenants out in order to cash in on the increase in rent.\nThe New York Apartment Association\nindicated\nin January that it would prioritize this type of legislation this session. \u201cWe welcome any efforts to get empty stabilized apartments back online and to get New Yorkers in the shelter system into permanent housing,\u201d NYAA\u2019s Jay Martin said in a statement. \u201cThis bill would be a small step towards accomplishing both of these things.\u201d\nThe group also still has its sights on a\nmeasure\nthat would allow owners to reset rents for regulated apartments that have become vacant after continuous occupancy for 10 or more years. Owners must show that they renovated the apartment, and reach an agreement with the new tenant to reset the rent (which can\u2019t be higher than the caps set by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for Section 8 vouchers). That bill, which has been pitched in different forms over the last few years, was reintroduced this week.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: It\u2019s that time of year again! The Rent Guidelines Board held its first meeting this week and released its Income and Expense\nStudy\n. Where do you think the board will land this year on rent increases? Send predictions to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nArchitect\nDavid Childs\nwas studying zoology at Yale University when he heard architectural historian Vincent Scully give a lecture and decided to change majors. Childs died this week at age 83.\n\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Gov. Andrew Cuomo withheld Covid vaccines from a facility set up at Citi Field for several weeks because he didn\u2019t like that Mayor Bill de Blasio was the one to open the site,\nPolitico New York reports\n. A spokesperson for Cuomo called the report \u201cnothing more than silly, revisionist history from a bunch of de Blasio ex-pats.\u201d\n\u2014ICYMI: Gov. Kathy Hochul floated bringing lawmakers back to Albany for a special session to address federal cuts that are not addressed in the state budget, which is due April 1,\nthe New York Times reports\n. \u201cIf and when we lose federal dollars in various categories, we are going to have to completely re-evaluate sections of the budget or perhaps the whole budget,\u201d said State Sen. Liz Krueger, a Democrat who leads the Finance Committee, told the Times.\n\u2014 Attorney General Letitia James and the Department of State are siding with the city in the Real Estate Board of New York\u2019s lawsuit challenging the Fairness in Apartment Rental Expenses Act,\nCrain\u2019s reports\n. James filed an amicus brief backing the city\u2019s argument that the FARE act does not violate state law.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Friday was\n$6.6 million\nfor a co-op unit at 211 Central Park South on the Upper West Side.\nThe Peraino Team\nat Douglas Elliman had the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$11.5 million\nfor a 15,815-square-foot office building at 449 39th Street in Sunset Park.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$37 million\nfor a 11,695-square-foot townhouse at 121 East 65th Street in Lenox Hill. Serena Boardman of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 61,535-square-foot project in Charlotte Gardens, the Bronx.

        "content": "In a significant blow for Sterling Bay\u2019s\nstruggling Lincoln Yards project\n, the Chicago-based real estate firm has conceded a substantial portion of its planned development site to lender Bank OZK.\nThe move involves transferring the northern segment of the proposed 53-acre development through a deed in lieu of foreclosure, marking a pivotal setback to Sterling Bay\u2019s $6 billion vision involving a mix of offices, housing and retail along a stretch of the Chicago River, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n, citing a Sterling Bay letter to investors.\nThe developer\u2019s CEO Andy Gloor acknowledged in the letter that the company reached an agreement with Bank OZK, a prolific construction lender based in Arkansas, to help settle a $126 million mortgage loan Sterling Bay took out against the land. The deal likely allows the borrower to relinquish control of the property while dodging a potentially lengthy formal foreclosure court process.\nThe transfer comes as Sterling Bay falters with securing financing to revitalize the project, which was slated to encompass 14.5 million square feet. Gloor cited \u201cunprecedented pressures\u201d on real estate financing markets as the cause of the difficulty, the outlet reported.\n\nThe relinquished land encompasses a 28-acre parcel once occupied by the A. Finkl &amp; Sons steel plant, with the change in ownership posing further uncertainties about the project\u2019s future, size and use. Bank OZK had extended the maturity of the mortgage multiple times, and expressed its devolving outlook on the project\u2019s viability through recent writedowns, which cut its balance to approximately $88 million by the end of 2024.\nWhile Sterling Bay had been in talks with various prospective financial partners to inject additional cash into the project, including the\nChicago Teachers\u2019 Pension Fund\nand investment firm\nKayne Anderson\n, efforts to secure a deal faltered, prompting Bank OZK\u2019s action. The lender confirmed its intention to market the property to new sponsors.\nDespite the setback, Gloor conveyed optimism about Sterling Bay\u2019s ongoing involvement in Lincoln Yards\u2019 future. The company had previously sought to consolidate ownership under a single entity, aiming to overcome challenges posed by the early exits of its initial backers \u2014 J.P. Morgan Asset Management and Dallas-based Lone Star Funds \u2014 as well as regulatory hurdles.\nLincoln Yards was approved by Chicago\u2019s City Council in 2019 under former mayor Rahm Emanuel, and faced additional delays attributed to financing disputes with the preceding administration of former mayor Lori Lightfoot. Efforts to secure infrastructure funding through a proposed bond deal encountered setbacks due to rising interest rates and ultimately exacerbated tensions between the developer and city officials.\n\u2014 Sam Lounsberry",

        "content": "When it comes to fundraising for who can win the race for Oakland mayor this spring, former Rep. Barbara Lee has outperformed former Council member Loren Taylor.\nLee and groups supporting her have raised about $694,000, while\nTaylor\nand his supporters raised $488,000, a 42 percent gap,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nThe dollars will be used to pay for online advertisements, direct mailers and campaigns to replace former Mayor Sheng Thao, elected in 2022 and recalled on April 15 last year.\nThe contributions include all fundraising through March 1 and donations exceeding $1,000 through March 24.\nLee, viewed as the front-runner in the race because of her\nwidespread name recognition\nas a former congresswoman, depends on support from city unions and building trades that heavily backed Thao in 2022, plus Pacific Gas and Electric Company and support from outside the city.\nTaylor\u2019s support has come predominantly from individual Oakland residents and backers of the recalls of Thao and\nformer Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Price\n, according to the Chronicle.\nLee is politically progressive. Taylor is a moderate who\nnarrowly lost the 2022 mayoral race\nto Thao. She was\nrecalled by voters in November\nand then\nindicted on federal bribery charges\n.\n\nTaylor has criticized Lee for relying on labor groups that fueled Thao\u2019s campaign for mayor. Lee has said that she will not disparage Taylor\u2019s supporters, and that her support comes from across all groups.\n\u201cThe recall forces in Oakland feel like Loren Taylor\u2019s their candidate,\u201d Jim Ross, a political consultant based in the East Bay city, told the Chronicle. \u201cHe really has fully embraced that slice of the political community in Oakland for his campaign.\u201d\nThe largest contributions to the Lee campaign were $150,000 from the California Nurses Association Political Action Committee; $51,000 from the Service Employees International Union Local 1021; and $50,000 from the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers Local 21, according to the Oakland Public Ethics Commission.\nThe largest donations to the Taylor campaign were $67,000 from the Revitalize East Bay Committee; $51,000 from Ronald Nahas, a partner of Rafanelli and Nahas, a developer based in Lafayette; and $21,000 from Marty Glick, an adviser to the Golden State Warriors.\nThe election nears as the city confronts a budget crisis and concerns about crime, with residents unhappy with the state of the city.\nThree out of four respondents to an October poll by the Oakland Chamber of Commerce felt Oakland was headed in the wrong direction, nearly 10 percent more than\nprevious chamber polls\n, according to the Chronicle. A\ncity survey released\nthis month shows that satisfaction with local government is at a record low.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Neiman Marcus\u2019 decision to close its century-old flagship store in downtown Dallas is not so final after all.\nThe store\u2019s parent, Hudson Bay Company subsidiary Saks Global, has decided to keep the store open through the end of this year, and is considering \u201ca reimagination of the location in collaboration with the City of Dallas\u201d after that, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nCity Manager Kimberly Bizor Tolbert met with Saks Global CEO Marc Metrick this week to pitch a \u201cfinancially beneficial\u201d plan for Neiman Marcus to stay in the store, at 1618 Main Street, which opened in 1907 and is part of the city\u2019s identity as a major retail destination. City Council member Paul Ridley, whose district includes downtown, has said the city is open to using economic development funds on the store.\nBut how much of Dallas taxpayers\u2019 money Tolbert offered Saks to keep its declining store open wasn\u2019t reported.\nIt seems to have been plenty, because a couple of weeks after making the \u201cfinal\u201d decision, the Saks CEO said this: \u201cWe deeply admire the city\u2019s passion and unwavering dedication to Neiman Marcus\u2019 storied legacy in Dallas. The potential reimagination of this iconic shopping destination reinforces Saks Global\u2019s commitment to redefining the luxury shopping experience.\u201d\nThis reimagination could mean \u201ca luxury retail experience, a curated art exhibition and a fashion and event center,\u201d or an incubator for fashion design and manufacturing, the outlet said.\nShoppers since last Christmas have noticed the store\u2019s dwindling merchandise and bare-bones staff of employees on the sales floors. It was a far cry from the bustling days when Neiman Marcus had its offices in the building, and executives could walk down to the store and experience the merchandise first hand.\nCity leaders apparently didn\u2019t wake up to what was happening with the store until after Saks Global said it was exiting its massive lease at City Place and planned to close the downtown flagship on March 31. Saks first used the excuse of an\nexpiring land lease\n, but after city leaders\ncleared that up\n, it said the decision to close the store was \u201cfinal\u201d anyway.\n\nNeiman Marcus is exiting\n82,000 square feet\nof office space at 2711 North Haskell Avenue. But Saks Global is meanwhile investing $100 million in the Neiman Marcus store at the thriving NorthPark Center.\nHere\u2019s what else happened in Texas real estate news this week.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s administration released a second list of just eight federal buildings they want to sell off nationwide on an \u201caccelerated\u201d basis. It\u2019s not clear whether an earlier list of over 400 buildings, which was posted and then removed from the U.S. General Services Administration\u2019s website, is still part of the administration\u2019s downsizing plan. One of the two Texas buildings listed for accelerated sale is the 163,000-square-foot building at\n727 East C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez Boulevard\nin San Antonio, which is in the path of where city leaders are considering building a new arena for the Spurs. The other is the 75,000-square-foot\nLaBranch Federal Building\nat 2320 LaBranch Street in Houston. None of\nDallas\u2019 federal buildings\nmade the short list.\nIn other Trump administration news, Houston-based real estate investor\nTilman Fertitta\nsaid he would resign from his business empire, which includes\u00a0 Wynn Resorts\u00a0 if he is confirmed as ambassador to Italy and San Marino.\nTexas Attorney General\nKen Paxton\nis investigating a Dallas-area master-planned community being developed by an entity tied to the \u200b\u200bEast Plano Islamic Center, citing state consumer protection laws as a basis for unspecified reasons for the probe.\nAn\nEuropean spa resort\nwith an eye-popping $800 million price tag is coming for a sleepy corner of central Dallas. Meanwhile, the $325 million\nHarold Simmons park\ninside the Trinity River levees could finally be moving forward and is expected to result in $1 billion of related real estate investment.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

The brokerage plans to lean on Chernov and her team to build a presence in the Pacific Palisades as the community there rebuilds and then, longer term, when high-end sales bounce back.\nChernov, who was behind last year\u2019s priciest sale in the Palisades in over a year, hailed from Compass.\nLater in the week, Carolwood Estates nabbed\nMick Partridge\n\u2019s team from the Beverly Hills Estates. The agent comes to the brokerage, which has been quietly and quickly scaling, with residential and commercial business. Partridge\u2019s group estimates residential development deals in the pipeline will bear out in more than $100 million in listings later this year.\nThe estimate is likely welcome news as Carolwood looks to continue a growth streak that saw its 2024 sales volume double to $3.2 billion.\nBel-Air manse first of $100M-plus deals this year\nWestside Estate Agency\u2019s Kurt Rappaport and Carolwood Estates\u2019 Drew Fenton are behind this year\u2019s first trade of over $100 million.\nThe power agents represented Australian billionaire James Packer, who told a local outlet he plans to move into his new Bel-Air estate mid-year after agreeing to pay $110 million for \u201cLe Belvedere\u201d at\n630 Nimes Road\n. He\u2019s coming home to quite the pad: a practically brand-new build with 10 bedrooms, 15 bathrooms and pools inside and outside, among other amenities.\nOne industry source sees the deal as a good indication of the ultra-luxury segment\u2019s health: \u201cThe high-end market in L.A., $100 million-plus, is back.\u201d\nBloomindale\u2019s takes lease at Ashkenazy Acquisition\u2019s Beverly Connection\nLook no further than the Beverly Connection for the latest sign that retail\u2019s off-price channel is still going strong and benefitting landlords with space to lease.\n\nThe outdoor shopping center owned by\nAshkenazy Acquisition Corporation\nat the corner of La Cienega Boulevard and 3rd Street landed a 20,000-square-foot lease with Bloomingdale\u2019s Outlet. Bloomie\u2019s discount door will absorb space previously occupied by Old Navy and is set to open later this year.\nFor Beverly Connection, the lease is the latest win in a retail corridor where the center\u2019s bound by chains, luxury brands and boutique shops. Joe Press, chief operating officer for Ashkenazy Acquisition, said the center\u2019s newest tenant \u201cfits in seamlessly\u201d with a roster \u201cfilling an in-demand niche in the retail market.\u201d\nVenice\u2019s Binoculars Building hangs up for-sale sign\nOne of Venice\u2019s most notable offices is on the sales block.\nFrank Gehry\u2019s Binoculars Building\n, which comes in at 78,578 square feet and currently has Google as its tenant, has been placed on the market by W.P.

        "content": "San Francisco\u2019s rejuvenated spring luxury market was the subject of much focus this week, from the long-awaited sale of the city\u2019s most expensive listing to a quick trade on ESPN analyst and former Warriors GM Bob Myers\u2019 Presidio Heights home.\nMyers and wife Kristen bought the 6,300-square-foot six-bedroom, four-bathroom and two half-bath home at\n200 Laurel Street\nin April 2016 for $10.3 million and sold it for $12.6 million, according to property records.\nListing agent Janet Schindler listed the home for $12.9 million on Jan. 22 and it was in contract on Feb. 21, according to Redfin. Schindler declined to comment on the sale, citing a non-disclosure agreement. Mapache Listo LLC, which was represented by Tyler Stewart of Heath Real Estate, was the buyer.\nStewart told\nThe Real Deal\nher clients already had a home in Presidio Heights and a very narrow area that they were looking at for a larger home amid extremely limited inventory.\n\u201cIn this specific location, which is essentially a four-block radius, you get maybe one house a year,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when those houses come up, it is obviously a very lovely home, but it\u2019s really location driven.\u201d\n$1M over asking in Presidio Heights\nLocation was also key to the sale of a home just around the corner at\n3333 Jackson Street\n, which went more than $1 million over the $6.5 million asking price, despite the fact that it had a \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d level of work to be done, according to Compass agent John Townsend, who represented the buyers. He said that for years having a house in the city that needed \u201csome TLC\u201d was seen as a \u201ctough sell,\u201d but that buyer mindsets seem to be changing this year.\nListing agent Ted Bartlett of Compass said that he and his co-listing agents \u201ccarefully priced\u201d 3333 Jackson, which had been in the same family for over four decades.\n\u201cWe knew potential buyers would be excited about the opportunity and compete for the opportunity to make it their family home,\u201d he said, adding that it went into contract after just eight days on the market.\nSF\u2019s most expensive listing sells for $26M\nWhile some high-end northside homes are selling in just days, San Francisco\u2019s most expensive listing\nfinally sold\nafter about 10 months on the market.\n\nBrokers Joe Lucier and Stacey Caen of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty listed the home of the late philanthropists Fritz and Lucy Jewett for $38 million last June, dropped the price to $32 million in October and sold it for $26.5 million on March 25. It was the first time the 10,200-square-foot property at the top of the Lyon Street Steps next to the Presidio has traded hands since it was built in 1987.\nPete Rodway of Compass represented the buyer and couldn\u2019t comment specifically on the sale due to a non-disclosure agreement but said, in general, \u201cWe have not seen this level of buyer activity since the fever pitch market of 2022, which continues to be fueled by local buyers in the tech sector and adjacent industries.\u201d\nDefault imminent for Berkeley\u2019s largest hotel\nIn addition to the San Francisco residential news, Berkeley\u2019s hospitality industry also hit the headlines when\nTRD reported\nthat the $48.3 million loan on the city\u2019s largest hotel and biggest waterfront tenant was headed toward default, according to Morningstar. The 378-room DoubleTree Berkeley Marina had a debt service coverage ratio of just .34x last year and has been below issuance since the pandemic, according to Morningstar.\nHong Kong-based\nJunson Capital\n, the family office for Chinese billionaire Cai Kui, has owned the waterfront hotel since 2014 through 200 Marina LLC. The loans in question were originated by Wells Fargo and UBS in 2017 and packaged into a commercial mortgage-backed securities offering that year.\nBingdong Zhao, the New York-based head of Junson\u2019s Real Estate Investment Division, is listed as the manager of 200 Marina LLC in city documents. He did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\nReceiver asks for more time to close Park Hotels debt sale\nIn further hotel debt news, after\nTRD reported\non March 6 that lenders had found a mystery buyer for Park Hotels\u2019 $725M debt sale, the\nreceiver asked the courts\nthis week for more time to close the deal.\n\u200b\u200bVirginia-based\nPark Hotels walked away\nfrom the 1,921-room Hilton San Francisco Union Square and 1,024-room Parc 55 San Francisco in 2023 and Eastdil began marketing the debt for sale last July.\nThe deal originally needed to close by March 31 in order to avoid going back to lender JP Morgan Chase for foreclosure. Receiver Michelle Russo of HotelAVE asked a San Francisco court to extend the sale deadline to May 20.\nRusso\u2019s sale extension request states, \u201cthe Receiver has made substantial progress on a sale of the hotels to a third party\u2026 and believes she will be in a position to file a motion to approve the sale imminently.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Miami Beach\u2019s luxury home market hit rock bottom last summer. It\u2019s back.\nWe\u2019ve been reporting on deal after deal, at record prices. The latest big one, billionaire Vlad Doronin\u2019s sale of his waterfront Star Island mansion for\n$120 million\n, got everyone talking.\nThe calls I received?\n\u201cDo you know who the real buyer is?\u201d\n\u201cWhat brokers were on that deal?\u201d\n\u201cI heard it\u2019s not who you reported.\u201d\nMichael Ferro, a private equity multimillionaire, is named on the deed as the buyer. But Ferro is friends with Ken Griffin, the billionaire we all know and who owns a lot of land on Star Island. Sources told me that Griffin is the real buyer of Doronin\u2019s property.\nRegardless, the trade is indicative of\nwhat\u2019s been going on\nin recent months across Miami Beach\u2019s most exclusive areas: the islands, such as Star, Palm, La Gorce and the Venetians, as well as prominent streets like North Bay Road. (The WSJ reported that the roughly 150 waterfront homes there are collectively worth more than $1.7 billion.)\nA handful of agents have said in recent weeks that price adjustments led to the first couple of big deals.\n\u201cEach sale set off a chain reaction,\u201d Coldwell Banker\u2019s Danny Hertzberg said.\nThe first domino to fall was David and Victoria Beckham\u2019s $72 million purchase of 4736 North Bay Road in October. A mansion on Palm Island traded for $45 million in February, less than a year after it sold for $40 million. In March, developer James Curnin sold his waterfront La Gorce Island mansion off-market for $60 million.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sort of blown away by these numbers, but it\u2019s becoming normal,\u201d Douglas Elliman agent Oliver Lloyd told me. Lloyd represented the buyer, online gaming entrepreneur Richard Skelhorn, in the Palm Island sale.\nThe market of five or 10 years ago is gone. The buyers are much wealthier than before, and many are big names. They\u2019re looking for off-market deals, in part because they require privacy and also because a lot of the most desired homes have been purchased already.\n\nTodd Glaser is among the developers looking to raise the price ceiling even higher \u2014 think more than double the price of Doronin\u2019s trade. He\u2019s in contract to acquire developer Sonny Kahn\u2019s 2.3-acre site on North Bay Road for $105 million.\nGlaser\u2019s preference will be to redevelop the waterfront lot into a spec mansion that could hit the market for $300 million, he said. (This is up from the previously reported planned price of $250 million.)\n\u201cPeople are starting to really get comfortable with that $100 million-plus sale,\u201d he said.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nI wrote about the allegations surrounding\nMarcy Javor\n, an agent in Boca Raton, as well as the state\u2019s investigation into complaints filed against her. Do you have a similar story? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nSpecial thanks to Kate Hinsche for writing the rest of this newsletter!\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential:\nBillionaire media mogul Ric Elias sold his oceanfront Palm Beach mansion for\n$73 million\nin an off-market deal. The nearly 12,900-square-foot mansion was built in 2018 and spans eight bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, four half-bathrooms and a pool. Douglas Elliman\u2019s Jack Rooney represented both sides of the deal.\nCommercial:\nAcadia Realty Trust\npaid $68 million\nfor Pinewood Square, a shopping center at 6330 Lantana Road in Lake Worth Beach. The seller is a joint venture between Woolbright Development and Principal Asset Management.\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nWeatherTech founder David MacNeil listed an 11,700-square-foot mansion at 84 Isla Bahia Drive in Fort Lauderdale for $45 million. Built in 2020 on half an acre with 300 feet of waterfront, the home has five bedrooms, eight bathrooms, four fireplaces and six wet bars, the listing shows. It\u2019s on the market with Amy Carpenter of DuPont Registry Realty. MacNeil sold an oceanfront Fort Lauderdale mansion for $40 million in 2023, and bought an oceanfront Manalapan estate for\n$38.5 million\nlast year.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\nJack McMullen, childhood friend of\nTRD\u2019s\nKate Hinsche, made his Opening Day debut as the Miami Marlins lead radio announcer this week,\ncalling the play-by-play\nfor the team\u2019s first win of the season against the Pittsburgh Pirates.\nElsewhere in Florida\nRelated Ross chairman Steve Ross is teaming up with eMerge Americas and the Florida Council of 100 on an initiative to make South Florida an \u201cinnovation hub,\u201d\nSouth Florida Business Journal\nreports. Ross is boosting the region, specifically West Palm Beach as the \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d of tomorrow, and is building office towers and wooing over institutions like Vanderbilt University and the Cleveland Clinic to bring his vision to life.\nParents of the Parkland school shooting victims are condemning a bill that would lower the minimum age for purchasing a firearm in Florida to 18, from 21. The Florida House passed the bill, and it likely has Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 support, according to\nCBS News\n.\nLawmakers in Tallahassee are gearing up for a battle over tax cuts,\nAxios\nreports. Gov. Ron DeSantis has proposed eliminating property taxes statewide and House Speaker Daniel Perez has pitched slashing the sales tax as well. The State Senate isn\u2019t likely to support both cuts, according to Axios.",

        "content": "In late 2022, the state legislature offered some relief to owners of certain affordable housing projects: They could collect the full voucher amount on apartments where the rent was less than the value of the rental assistance.\nBut the rollout was slow. One affordable housing provider said that thousands of applications for the program have been waiting several months to be processed.\n\u201cIt was this great thing that popped on the scene, and everyone was excited,\u201d the provider told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cBut the result is different from what anyone was hoping for.\u201d\nNow, the relief is fully cut off.\nHPD\nannounced\nthat it is not accepting new applications from landlords seeking to collect the full voucher amount in their buildings under Section 610 of the Private Housing Financing Law. The agency\u2019s website points to \u201cthe current situation created by the uncertainty at the federal level,\u201d noting that federal funding is limited and must be stretched across all public housing agencies in the U.S.\nThe \u201ccurrent situation\u201d may be uncertain, but there are some major known challenges.\nCongress approved a stop-gap budget resolution this month that increased funding for Section 8 contract renewals, but not enough to keep up with rising costs. By some\nestimates\n, it could result in the loss of 32,000 vouchers.\nIn the last two months, payments to New York landlords accepting Section 8 vouchers were\ndelayed\n. The first delay, in January,\nresulted\nfrom confusion around whether President Donald Trump\u2019s order to pause federal grants and other government programs applied to rental assistance, given that the New York City Housing Authority receives Section 8 payments from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nActions on the federal level are not the only challenges at play.\nBy City Hall\u2019s count, some 11,000 households in city shelters that have vouchers through the City Family Homelessness and Eviction Prevention Supplement, or CityFHEPs, cannot find housing. The cost of the program will reach more than $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2025,\naccording to the Citizens Budget Commission\n. One of Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 key arguments against the City Council\u2019s expansion of CityFHEPs was that costs would balloon and create even more competition for limited housing. A court sided with Adams in August, and the Council appealed.\n\nGiven this climate, it wasn\u2019t surprising that a new discretionary program like Section 610 would be put on ice. From the program\u2019s launch, HPD\ncautioned\nthat its application could be disrupted if the available subsidies became too strained.\n\u201cWe kind of saw this coming,\u201d said Rachel Fee, executive director of the New York Housing Conference. \u201cThe agency doesn\u2019t have good options right now.\u201d\nStill, it\u2019s a hit to some of the most vulnerable rent-regulated properties.\nGov. Kathy Hochul signed Section 610 into law in December 2022. In its guidance for owners, HPD indicated that Section 610 was \u201cintended to help the most financially troubled, regulated affordable housing developments.\u201d\nIt permitted affordable housing owners to request permission to collect the full voucher amount, either through a local or federal program, even if it is higher than the legal rent of a unit (without affecting what the tenant pays). Voucher holders pay 30 percent of their income toward rent, and government subsidy covers the rest, up to a \u201cfair market rent\u201d set by HUD. Those thresholds differ in some parts of the city that calculate caps on a zip code level.\nOnly owners with regulatory agreements with the city or state that require affordable housing are eligible. The city excluded new construction from Section 610 and specified that projects that solely had affordable units through the city\u2019s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program or the property tax break 421a were not eligible.\nOwners often try to close on their projects by June, the end of the city\u2019s fiscal year. One attorney said some clients were hoping to secure Article XI by that time (a tax exemption for new projects and rehabs that have an affordable housing agreement with HPD) and, by extension, be eligible for Section 610.\nHPD\u2019s announcement may kill those projects.\nThere may be some hope. The New York Apartment Association, a group that represents rent-stabilized apartments, is pushing a bill at the state level that would fill in for Section 610. The measure, introduced last week, would temporarily allow some stabilized owners to collect the full voucher amount.\n",
