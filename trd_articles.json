        "content": "A\nHolmby Hills\nmansion tied to a business management firm to the stars topped last week\u2019s additions to the local high-end inventory.\nThat\u2019s according to the weekly report compiled by Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team, which counts new active listings and homes under contract in Los Angeles County. The\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\nfactors in only homes listed in the Multiple Listing Service with an asking price of at least $4 million.\nThe resort-inspired estate at 145 North Mapleton Drive, which is listed by Compass\u2019\nGinger Glass\n, is asking $48 million. That pencils out to $3,127 per square foot.\nThe over 15,000-square-foot property sits on nearly a 1-acre lot and last traded in 2020 for $36.5 million, or $2,378 per square foot. That was when a limited liability company called Maple Living purchased the home, striking a deal on a property that first hit the market for $55 million in 2019, according to property records and listing sites.\nMaple Living is managed by Tri Star Sports &amp; Entertainment, according to records obtained through PropertyShark. The West Hollywood firm represents actors, athletes, artists and other high-net-worth clients and has reportedly been linked to stars such as Britney Spears and Kim Kardashian in the past. Earlier this year, the company acquired Miami business management firm LRW Group for an undisclosed sum.\nThe Mapleton Drive home is big on privacy with the property behind 12-foot-tall gates and a guard house with its own kitchen and bathroom. In all, the home counts seven bedrooms and 14 bathrooms with a chef\u2019s kitchen, bar, pool cabanas and home theater.\nAmong last week\u2019s signed contracts was a Malibu home that claimed the No. 1 spot in the Eklund Gomes report, with a listing price of $7.5 million, or $2,707 per square foot.\nThe 1978-built beach house at 6649 Zumirez Drive, with its own private access to Little Dume, is owned by a trust tied to producers Paul Taublieb and Susan Cooper.\nThe Emmy Award winners paid $740,000 for the home in 1996. The duo is behind the documentary \u201cUnchained: The Untold Story of Freestyle Motocross\u201d and \u201cThe Vow,\u201d a movie starring Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams.\nColdwell Banker Realty\u2019s Susan Monus holds the listing.\nTaublieb and Cooper initially asked just under $8 million for the home in September, before reducing the price to $7.5 million in November.\nThe home sits on an over 1-acre lot and counts three beds and three baths across 2,752 square feet.\nOverall, Los Angeles County saw five residential properties added to the for-sale inventory in the week, according to the\nEklund Gomes report\n. Meanwhile, a dozen homes went into contract, which was good for $66.5 million in asking volume. That\u2019s a spike of well over 200 percent compared to the same time last year.\n",

        "content": "Whether Chicago\u2019s real estate dealmakers got the rebound they wanted in 2025 depends on who you ask.\nLuxury residential brokers would say it was one of the\nbest years of their careers\n, and the city\u2019s\nbiggest brokerage\nwas officially absorbed by an even bigger one from New York.\nYet commercial developers and office landlords are still mostly on the sidelines, with only a\nselect few\ngetting back into the game.\nTrophy office towers are roaring again,\nmegaprojects stirred back to life\nand the Midwest\u2019s multifamily landlords are riding some of the\nstrongest rent growth in the nation\n\u2014 a result of dropoffs in new construction that nonetheless helped stave off lenders.\nStill, plenty of players, tenants and banks were\nrattled by distress\n, and lawsuits containing allegations of foul play and fraud flew back and forth.\nThese were Chicago\u2019s juiciest real estate stories of 2025.\nOffice market shows signs of life\nAfter years of headlines about distress and record vacancies, Chicago\u2019s office sector gained real momentum in 2025 \u2014 though only at the top end.\nThe biggest splash came at\nSalesforce Tower\n, where developers Hines and Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises landed a $610 million refinancing. That deal preceded a string of subleases, including space Salesforce rented to\nNewmark\nand private equity firm Wind Point Partners, showing trophy space still draws demand from top-tier tenants.\nThe Bank of America tower at\n110 North Wacker Drive\nsecured a $700 million refinancing led by landlord Oak Hill Advisors, marking the city\u2019s largest commercial mortgage-backed securities office loan since the pandemic. With Bank of America the largest tenant in the building and the tower offering high-end amenities, lenders showed a level of confidence that has grown rare for Chicago office buildings.\nIn Fulton Market, developers Jeff Shapack, Tim Anderson and their partner Walton Street Capital also defied Chicago\u2019s office market woes with a\n$247 million refinancing for 167 North Green Street\n.\nBut the picture wasn\u2019t uniform. Blackstone extended the\n$1.3 billion loan on Willis Tower\nfor a sixth time, as valuation swings and tenant downsizing kept pressure on the skyscraper.\nPlans for office\nconversions into residential chugged along\n. And trades within the sector that did occur extended the streak of extreme losses in value from previous sale prices.\nNew York-based investors were the big buyers:\n601W Cos. bought the building at 525 West Van Buren Street\nfor just $35 million, Mike Kohan paid just $45 million for the skyscraper at 311 South Wacker Drive to mark an 85 percent discount from its last sale, while Namdar Realty Group and Mason Asset Management are working on a deal to snag the tower at 190 South LaSalle Street at a steep loss for the seller,\nBeacon Capital Partners\n. Plus, the New York-based\nStahl Organization\npartnered with Hines to buy the Boeing Building for just $22 million.\nMeanwhile, Neil Bluhm\u2019s aforementioned\nWalton Street Capital is having a tough time\nselling its Magnificent Mile office tower at 401 North Michigan Avenue after drawing initial interest from seriously capitalized buyers.\nMegadevelopment momentum\nChicago\u2019s major development sites, some long-stalled, made real progress in 2025.\nAt\nLincoln Yards\n, new investors emerged to buy undeveloped land off the clearance rack, including\nJDL and Kayne Anderson\n. They paid\n$84 million\nfor land on the north side of the Chicago River from Bank OZK, which seized the property from a venture of the original developer, Sterling Bay and its partner Lone Star Funds.\nMore recently,\nJohn Novak\nemerged as a buyer for much of the southern Lincoln Yards assemblage. The revived momentum pointed to a more phased, modular approach, replacing the bigger, $6 billion buildout originally pitched by\nSterling Bay\n.\nDespite\nsuffering some setbacks\n, Bally\u2019s pushed ahead on its\n$1.7 billion permanent casino\ncomplex in River West. Construction rose on the riverfront site, and remained on track for opening in late 2026.\nRelated Midwest and CRG bought the long-dormant\nformer U.S. Steel site on the South Side\nin partnership with\nBlue Owl\n, teeing up a multibillion-dollar quantum computing project on the lakefront as the anchor of a larger redevelopment play.\nAnd at The 78 megasite, Related and billionaire\nJoe Mansueto\u2019s Chicago Fire FC\nsecured approval to build a privately funded soccer stadium \u2014 the site\u2019s first real vertical development.\nMeanwhile, stadium plans for the\nWhite Sox\nand\nBears\nremained uncertain. The Sox were left out of stadium planning at The 78, and the Bears floated a\nmove to Indiana\nafter Illinois lawmakers ignored funding requests.\n@properties sale to Compass kicks off new consolidation wave\nChicago\u2019s\nbrokerage landscape shifted\nwhen Compass acquired @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate in a $444 million deal that closed early in the year.\nThe move gave Compass a dominant foothold in the city and combined its marketing platform with @properties\u2019 agent base and mortgage and title arms. It also set off a wave of local reactions, as competitors\nrecalibrated, and agents speculated\nabout the merger\u2019s effect on the city\u2019s top firm.\nLocal legacy powerhouse\nBaird &amp; Warner bought\nthe Chicago-focused brokerage Dream Town Real Estate to bolster its scale.\nBut by year-end,\nCompass had agreed to a $1.6 billion all-stock acquisition\nof Anywhere Real Estate, which owns Coldwell Banker and Century 21 among other brokerage brands. If approved, the merger would give\nCompass a sprawling umbrella\nand further consolidate power at the national level, as brokerage industry norms get\nscrutinized and reconsidered\n.\nSouth Side multifamily distress\nWhile rents climbed and inventory stayed tight across Class A apartments, the South Side\u2019s multifamily sector struggled with legal, financial and reputational blows.\nIn South Shore, properties owned by\nWisconsin-based investor Trinity Flood\nwere\nraided by federal immigration agents\nfollowing a wave of tenant complaints and building code issues. The ownership group had already\nfaced foreclosures and lawsuits\ndue to subpar property conditions and loan payment defaults before the stunning law enforcement operation carried out in the middle of the night.\nNearby, legal fights broke out between\nonce-active investors\n. Chikoo Patel, who oversaw a portfolio of dozens of buildings across the South Side, was\nsued by multiple partners\n, including investor Shai Wolkowicki, who claimed Patel improperly siphoned off millions of dollars for his own use. Wolkowicki and Patel also\nfaced a foreclosure lawsuit\nfrom lender Old National Bank. Separately,\nWolkowicki also sued Mitch Goltz\nover claims of mismanagement in their prolific former retail development partnership,\nGW Properties\n.\nBack on the South Side,\nNew York-based Emerald Empire\u2019s apartment portfolio\n, which included over\n$600 million in real estate it purchased in bulk from Pangea Properties\nin 2022, slid into forbearance on a massive Fannie Mae loan.\nAcross Chicagoland,\nThe Real Deal also tracked the nearly $100 million\nthat investors who got blacklisted by Fannie Mae tossed into regional real estate.\nLakefront luxury reaches new peaks\nHigh-end housing\nsurged past previous records\nin 2025, especially along the North Shore and into Wisconsin\u2019s Lake Geneva.\nA\nWinnetka lakefront estate\nowned by Walton Street Capital executive Jeff Quicksilver and his wife Ashley Quicksilver sold for $32.5 million \u2014 the most ever paid for a home in Illinois \u2014 just weeks after another mansion in the same wealthy power town traded for\n$31 million\n.\nThe\nQuicksilvers set another local record\nas they downsized to a\n$14.5 million Kenilworth mansion\n, and a\n$20 million Lake Geneva sale\nalso closed, reinforcing a strong year for waterfront trophy homes. North Shore specialist\nJena Radnay\nclosed both the big Winnetka deals as well as the Kenilworth sale, marking a new peak for her brokerage practice.\nBut it wasn\u2019t all good news for Lake Michigan\u2019s shoreline homeowners. The residents who\nsued the Winnetka government\nfor overhauling rules to make it harder to develop blufftop land along the water\nsuffered a setback in court\n. Yet they\u2019re still fighting to repeal the regulations.\nLake Geneva also saw litigation. The\nhistoric Aloha Lodge\nbecame the\nsubject of a lawsuit\nafter an initial buyer walked away from a $37.5 million contract. But demand overall stayed strong, with multiple bidders vying for move-in-ready estates at about the\n$10 million range\n. Interest rate pressure didn\u2019t seem to reach this end of the market.\nProperty tax troubles plague all of Cook County\nIt\u2019s a perennial theme in Chicago real estate:\nproperty tax chaos\n.\nDelayed bills\nleft buyers in limbo\nand cost\nChicago Public Schools nearly $250,000 a day\nin interest on short-term loans it took on to cover the gap from late property tax revenue. Assessments across the\nSouth and West Sides jumped\n, with some homeowners discovering tax bills that had doubled.\nLate in the year, a federal court ruled the\ncounty\u2019s annual delinquent tax sale system unconstitutional\n, casting uncertainty over how liens would be handled moving forward.\nThe result of it all was\ndeal slowdowns\n, broken underwriting assumptions and increased tension between commercial landlords and homeowners. With no sure fix in place, tax policy remains a key concern heading into 2026.\n",

Most of the space would be residential, though there would also be 3,900 square feet of commercial space; the Department of Buildings application references \u201cgeneral wiring for a nightclub\u201d on the ground floor.\nThe conversion plans were first reported by\nPincusCo\n. In comments to the Observer, Negrin said the project \u201cshows the adaptability of this great property,\u201d mentioning how it started as a printing factory a century ago.\nNegrin\u2019s excitement for the conversion is a departure from a few years ago, when the Lexin owner and president appeared ready to wash his hands of the property.\nLexin bought the property on West 28th Street, dubbed the Caxton Building, in 2014 for\n$81.5 million\nand refinanced it in 2016 with a $73 million loan from Aareal Bank. Lexin put the property up for sale in February 2020, at which time it was 90 percent leased, aiming for a price around\n$138 million\n.\nHe never sold the property, though, and leasing activity collapsed as the pandemic\u2019s impact raged across the office landscape. In 2022, Lexin reached maturity default on the property\u2019s non-performing loan, a $65 million debt an Aareal subsidiary\nput up for sale\nin 2023, when the property was only 58 percent leased.\nMonths later, a buyer emerged for the debt: Lexin itself, putting it in control of the building\u2019s future once more. That future doesn\u2019t appear to include existing office tenants, including health tech company Noom and wedding photographer Edward Dye.\nElsewhere, Lexin put the development site at 75 Nassau Street\nup for sale\nlast summer, seeking a valuation of around $75 million in either an outright sale or stake sale for one of the last 421a-eligible development sites in Manhattan.\nThe site \u2014 zoned for mixed-use residential and commercial and eligible to be developed into a rental or condo building with 253 units \u2014 has yet to be sold.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Columbia Property Trust has been hit with a notice of default tied to San Francisco office buildings six months after the debt matured.\nThe New York-based firm\ndefaulted on a $1.7 billion\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities loan in July and received the notice of default from its lenders on Dec. 17, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The loan was backed by\n650 California Street\nand 201 California Street in the Financial District and five other office buildings across the country.\nThe debt has since grown to $1.9 billion, according to the notice. Lenders could pursue foreclosure if Columbia doesn\u2019t rectify the situation and pay back the money owed.\nThe seven-building portfolio also includes three office buildings in Manhattan, one in Boston and one in New Jersey. Columbia\nsought to sell debt backed by 201 California\nthis summer; as of this fall, lenders were negotiating with Ridge Capital Investors to sell the debt for $75 million, but no deal has materialized.\nColumbia first defaulted on the $1.7 billion loan, originated in late 2021 by a group including\nGoldman Sachs\n, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, in January 2023, a few months before its scheduled maturity. Columbia negotiated an extension of the loan\u2019s maturity to July 2025, with an additional six-month extension option, according to CMBS data cited by the Business Times. The firm did not exercise the extension option or pay off the loan at its maturity.\nThe seven-building portfolio was appraised at a total of almost $1.3 billion this year, down from nearly $2.3 billion in October 2021. The appraised value of 650 California dropped to $305 million this year from $479 million over the same period. Columbia bought the building in 2014 for $309 million. The 34-story tower was 87 percent occupied as of September 2024, according to the most recent CMBS data available from lenders cited by the Business Times.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Solomon was an employee at the REIT for more than a dozen years.\nHe was charged last December\nwith stealing more than $9.5 million from the company between 2009 and 2023.\nProsecutors in the U.S. Southern District\u2019s office don\u2019t appear to be buying his argument about the disclosures.\nThey responded to Solomon\u2019s motion, saying that he was trying to shift the focus of the trial away from himself and onto Vornado.\n\u201cIn essence, the defendant seeks to convert a trial about whether he committed wire fraud and aggravated identity theft into a trial about whether Victim Company-1 has complied with securities laws,\u201d prosecutors wrote. \u201cWhether Victim Company-1 has complied with the securities laws is irrelevant to whether the defendant committed the charged offenses.\u201d\nSolomon pleaded not guilty in December and by May prosecutors told the judge overseeing the case that they had reached an agreement in principle with him to change his plea. Solomon switched attorneys, though, and\ndug in his heels\nto fight the charges.\nIf found guilty, he faces up to 20 years in prison.\n",

        "content": "The Department of Veterans affairs must build more than 2,500 housing units on its West Los Angeles campus, a federal appeals court has ruled.\nLast week, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a court order requiring the VA to construct 750 temporary units for veterans within 18 months and 1,800 permanent housing units within six years, LAist\nreported\n. The VA is accused of \u201cstray[ing] from its mission\u201d by leasing land to commercial tenants like the University of California, Los Angeles, for a\nbaseball field and Brentwood School for a sports complex\nrather than using it for veterans.\n\u201cThere are now scores of unhoused veterans trying to survive in and around the greater Los Angeles area despite the acres of land deeded to the VA for their care,\u201d Judge Ana de Alba said in the Powers v. McDonough case opinion. There are more than 3,000 unhoused veterans in the Los Angeles region.\nThe appeals court backed a 2024 ruling from U.S. District Judge David O. Carter that found the VA discriminated against disabled veterans by failing to provide adequate housing on the 388-acre property deeded as a soldiers\u2019 home in 1888. The ruling also invalidates most commercial leases on the property, including Brentwood School\u2019s 22-acre sports complex and an oil company\u2019s drilling license, though the district court\u2019s previous invalidation of UCLA\u2019s lease for its baseball stadium was overturned.\nThe case dates back to a 2015 settlement in which the VA promised to build 1,200 housing units, with more than 770 completed by 2022. The deadline came and went without new housing, which prompted the new lawsuit. The veteran plaintiffs said the dearth of on-campus housing has kept disabled veterans from accessing physical and mental health services at the VA.\nAs of late last year, there were 307 veteran housing units open on the West L.A. campus and 461 units under construction, according to the VA.\nJeffrey Powers, the main plaintiff in the class-action suit, lived in a tent outside the\nVA Medical Center\n. Following the appeal\u2019s court\u2019s ruling, he said the decision comprises \u201cabout 80 percent\u201d of what he\u2019d like to see done.\n\u201cWe got the most important thing, which was to get veterans off the street,\u201d Powers said. \u201cAnd for that, I\u2019m happy with the outcome.\u201d\nIn May, President Donald Trump\nissued an executive order\ninstructing the VA secretary to develop a plan to\nhouse 6,000 people\nat the West Los Angeles VA center by 2028. The case is now back in the hands of the District Court judge to implement the court\u2019s housing order and oversee construction of units.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

North Side Alderman Bennett Lawson, who has chaired the committee on an interim basis since August, said Monday he\u2019s done playing placeholder.\nLawson declined to schedule a January\nzoning\nmeeting, meaning no zoning items can advance to the full City Council next month. The move effectively freezes dozens of developments across the city that need final approval, according to the publication.\n\u201cIf I continue to be in the acting role, it kicks the can down the road,\u201d Lawson told the outlet. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to force the issue and bring about a quick resolution.\u201d\nThe Zoning Committee is where Chicago\u2019s development battles are won or lost, overseeing rezonings, planned developments and issues that routinely touch gentrification, landmarking and design standards. Without a chair and without meetings, projects large and small are stuck in limbo \u2014 an unwelcome delay for developers already navigating high interest rates, elevated construction costs and a cautious lending market.\nThe vacancy itself is the product of months of political gridlock. Johnson\u2019s first pick for the role, former Alderman\nCarlos Ramirez-Rosa\n, resigned amid bullying allegations. The seat then sat open until September, when Johnson tapped longtime zoning powerbroker Walter Burnett Jr. Burnett, however, stepped down from the council in July, reopening the wound.\nLawson has filled the gap twice now, first for nine months after Ramirez-Rosa\u2019s exit and again after Burnett\u2019s departure. He\u2019s made clear he won\u2019t do it indefinitely, citing the workload and political weight of the job, which comes with extra staff, office space and a seat on the Planning Commission.\nJohnson insists a solution is coming. The mayor said Monday he plans to propose a broader reshuffling of committee chairmanships and downplayed concerns about delays. When pressed on timing, he offered a single word: \u201cSoon.\u201d\nBehind the scenes,\ncompeting interests\nhave slowed any resolution. Progressive and moderate blocs, along with the City Council\u2019s Black and Latino caucuses, have jockeyed for control. Johnson\u2019s attempt to install Alderman\nDaniel La Spata\nwas rebuffed. Alderman Gilbert Villegas has floated himself as an alternative. Lawson, a freshman alderman but former zoning staffer, has also said he wants the job.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "In an Elmhurst neighborhood where teardowns have become the norm, a small 1920s house that dodged the wrecking ball is making its case for preservation \u2014 with a glossy, design-forward relaunch.\nA 1925 cottage on Arlington Avenue designed by architect Harold Zook has hit the market just under $1.5 million after a full-scale glow-up that leans into its storybook bones rather than erasing them. The four-bedroom, four-bathroom, 2,900-square-foot home at 231 South Arlington Avenue was listed Dec. 18 by Pattie Murray of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Chicago,\naccording\nto Crain\u2019s, which first reported the sale. The price amounts to $517 per square foot.\nOwner Kristin Luu calls it \u201c\nZook 2.0.\u201d\nThe renovation keeps the chalet-style wood ceiling, gingerbread staircase trim and rolled eaves intact, while layering in a high-contrast color palette, eccentric light fixtures and finishes that skew decidedly 2025. Luu, an executive search consultant, worked remotely with Finnish designer Maya Mhanna via Decorilla to update both form and function, carving out a mudroom and adding a basement powder room without flattening the home\u2019s original character.\nThat balance matters in\nElmhurst\n, where older homes are\nroutinely scrapped\nfor large new construction. The Zook house sits on a one-third-acre lot that would have been catnip for builders. Its two immediate neighbors are replacement homes, and at least four nearby properties have sold to teardown buyers in recent months, according to the publication. One such sale on Illinois Street closed in July for $1.7 million \u2014 for the land alone.\nBy comparison, Luu\u2019s asking price covers both land and a fully reimagined historic house.\nThe property\u2019s prior owner, Regina Bollaert, sold the home in 2023 for $1 million after her family owned it for six decades and actively resisted selling to developers. Luu told the outlet that she wasn\u2019t initially shopping as a preservationist, but the house\u2019s intact details changed the project from a simple redesign into something closer to a rescue.\nIn at least one case, the house won the argument. Luu initially planned to open up the kitchen, then backed off, deciding the closed layout better suited the home\u2019s\nCotswold-style\nfootprint.\nZook, who left his mark across the western suburbs and designed the art deco Pickwick Theater in Park Ridge, isn\u2019t typically associated with modest cottages. That architectural provenance sets this house apart from many of the homes that have disappeared nearby.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "L+M Development landed fresh capital for one of the city\u2019s most ambitious coastal housing plays in Queens.\nA joint venture led by the developer landed $278 million in construction financing to build the first residential phase of Arverne East, a master-planned development poised to reshape a large stretch of Far Rockaway with affordable housing, Commercial Observer\nreported\n.\nThe deal funds Building D, a 320-unit project at 116 Beach 36th Street that kicks off a megaproject due to deliver 1,650 affordable apartments across 116 acres.\nThe sponsorship group goes well beyond L+M. Partners include Urbane Development, the Bluestone Organization, Mega Group Development and Triangle Equities Development.\nGoldman Sachs Alternatives\u2019 Urban Investment Group is the anchor lender, alongside a roster of public agencies that underscores the project\u2019s political heft.\nThe capital stack includes the city\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development and Housing Development Corporation, New York State Homes and Community Renewal, plus funding from the City Council and Queens Borough President\u2019s office.\nBuilding D will deliver 230 affordable rental units and 90 homes slated for private ownership. The mix reflects a broader push to blend rental housing with paths to ownership in neighborhoods where prices have long shut residents out.\nConstruction is expected to wrap in 2028.\nArverne East has been in the works for years, born out of post-Sandy planning to rethink development along the Rockaways\u2019 flood-prone coastline. The project leans heavily on climate-resilient design, featuring buildings elevated above flood levels and packed with mitigation measures.\nPlans for Building D include roof-mounted solar panels paired with ground-source heat pumps, bioswale gardens to manage stormwater and flood-proofed ground floors.\nFar Rockaway was among the areas hardest hit by Superstorm Sandy in 2012, and later, by flooding tied to Hurricane Ida. Those disasters pushed city officials and developers to pursue projects that could withstand increasingly volatile weather while still adding housing supply.\nThe financing follows an earlier milestone for Arverne East. In mid-2023, developers completed a 35-acre nature preserve and a Coastal Conservation Center on the site, bringing a community center and Parks Department space to the area.\nFuture phases are slated to add more housing, retail, a community facility and even a boutique hotel.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The fallout from the alleged fraud tied to indicted developer Ken Mattson\u2019s LeFever Mattson firm is getting closer to the embattled developers\u2019 families.\nIn a new court filing, the unsecured creditors committee representing more than 600 defrauded investors won permission to subpoena the 83-year-old mother-in-law of co-founder Tim LeFever, alleging the now-defunct California real estate firm transferred more than $2.4 million to her in the years leading up to the real estate empire\u2019s collapse, the Mercury News\nreported\n. That figure includes more than $1.6 million in the year leading up to LeFever Mattson\u2019s bankruptcy filing.\nJudge Charles Novack approved the request the same day it was filed. LeFever\u2019s mother-in-law, 83-year-old Kathleen Hamlin, has now been identified as a litigation target in the ongoing case.\nHamlin lives near LeFever and his wife Amy in Dixon, California. Creditors are looking for recoverable assets \u2014 such as indicted developer\nKen Mattson\u2019s properties\n\u2014 in the case that prosecutors have described as a long-running Ponzi scheme. Mattson was\nordered to surrender the deed\nto his home in Piedmont earlier this month.\nThe subpoena seeks documents from Hamlin, her accountants, attorneys and family members, including Tim and Amy LeFever. It also targets a web of affiliated nonprofits, construction firms and limited partnerships\nconnected to the firm\u2019s\nreal estate investment vehicles, which at their peak controlled roughly 200 properties valued at about $400 million. Hamlin has until Jan. 9 to share the documents and until Jan. 30 to appear in court for oral testimony.\nProsecutors allege Mattson siphoned funds from investors into secret accounts for personal use, rather than using the money to invest in real estate on investors\u2019 behalf. LeFever has filed more than 60 claims in the bankruptcy proceedings saying he flagged accounting problems to regulators last year.\nThe committee and lawyers representing LeFever Mattson entered into mediation with Tim LeFever this month. LeFever has not been criminally charged, while Mattson has pleaded not guilty to\nnine federal counts\nincluding wire fraud, money laundering and obstruction of justice.\nCourt filings suggest the defrauded investors may ultimately recover between 20 to 40 percent of what they put in. Many were retirees who gave their life savings or retirement funds to LeFever Mattson. Still, many of them haven\u2019t lost hope, and have turned to each other for support, either over text message or in person. Some have even offered their prayers for Mattson, hoping for a \u201cheart change,\u201d the Mercury News\nreported\n.\n\u201cSometimes we joke, or we talk about the pain we\u2019ve experienced,\u201d investor Stephen Crane said of his relationships with fellow victims. \u201cBut there is ultimately justice. There will be a day when he has to stand before God and acknowledge what he\u2019s done.\u201d\n\u201cKen robbed us of our money. But he can\u2019t rob our joy or our peace,\u201d Crane\u2019s wife Maria added.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The company expanded its space at the building multiple times, ultimately moving from a 1,226-square-foot space to a 6,425-square-foot office in May 2024, according to the landlord. Modifications to the agreement included extending the lease until 2035.\nTerms of the lease outlined in the lawsuit show Venetos agreed to a payment schedule that started at a rate of $46 per square foot and incrementally increased to $60 per square foot by the end of the lease.\nRosewood claims Venetos was sporadic on payments starting in July 2024, and stopped paying rent altogether in June 2025. Rosewood terminated the lease in October, and Lurin Capital vacated the space in November.\nAlthough the property is in Dallas\u2019 most coveted office district, Rosewood said it\u2019s been unsuccessful in filling the space. Venetos owes the landlord $5.3 million because has personally guaranteed the lease, Rosewood said. The sum includes past due rent and fees, future rent and attorney fees.\nRosewood joins a growing club of lenders, vendors, cities and landlords suing Jon Venetos over unpaid bills. Acore Capital Mortgage kicked off the crush of lawsuits in the spring when it said\nVenetos defaulted on nearly $400 million\ntied to 12 properties in Florida.\nSince then,\nFannie Mae\nsued Venetos and Lurin over a $77 million default.\nVista Bank\nand\nKeybank\nalso filed lawsuits claiming defaults. In a series of October lawsuits, Acore claimed that Venetos personally guaranteed the money he borrowed from the lender and still\nowes $81 million\n.\nLurin also got slapped with a\ntemporary restraining order\nthat ordered residents of a Lurin-owned property in Plano to vacate due to unsafe conditions, including lack of access to water, sewer or gas.\n",

The deal closed Dec. 12, Brohn Chief Operating Officer Greg Barber\ntold\nthe Houston Business Journal, though the purchase price was not disclosed.\nThe transaction hands Brohn an instant footprint in Greater Houston, including a 30-person local team led by Roderick Flint and active or planned construction across 13 master-planned communities, according to the publication. Those include Sunterra in Katy, Attwater near Waller, Fulshear Lakes in Fort Bend County, Sierra Vista in Iowa Colony and Azalea in Pattison.\nHistoryMaker\nhas been a steady player in the Houston market. The Grapevine-based builder closed 247 homes locally last year and started 238 more, ranking 32nd among area builders by volume. The company entered Houston in 2016 and consistently expanded before this pull back to its core markets, according to the outlet.\nFounded in 1949,\nHistoryMaker\nwill now focus exclusively on\nDallas-Fort Worth\nand San Antonio. CEO Nelson Mitchell framed the sale as a cultural fit, saying the companies\u2019 shared values made the move a \u201cnatural alignment.\u201d\nThe acquisition is a shortcut into Texas\u2019 largest and most competitive housing market for Brohn \u2014 and one it\u2019s had its eye on for years. The builder has operated in Austin since 2003 and was acquired in 2018 by Clayton Properties Group, a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary and one of the country\u2019s largest homebuilding platforms.\nBrohn only expanded to San Antonio earlier this year, but Barber told the outlet that Houston has long been part of the growth plan.\nThe deal boosts Brohn\u2019s headcount from 80 employees in\nAustin\nto about 110 across its Texas operations. Longer term, the company has set an ambitious target: Building 1,000 homes per year in the Houston area within five years.\nThat goal puts Brohn squarely in a crowded field dominated by national giants and well-capitalized regional players, all competing for lots, labor and buyers in a market that has cooled from pandemic highs but remains one of the nation\u2019s most\nresilient\n.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Florida\u2019s Republican-controlled House of Representatives is fast-tracking a sweeping package of reforms that could dramatically slash residential property taxes in the state, causing heartburn for local governments that use the money to fund critical services such as law enforcement.\nLegislators are proposing seven constitutional amendments for the 2026 ballot that would give voters the chance to decide whether to scale back or eliminate property taxes on homesteaded residences, the Orlando Sentinel\nreported\n. If voters approve the changes, local governments could lose up to $18 billion in annual revenue.\nThe proposals, to be debated when the\nFlorida Legislature\nconvenes for its yearly session on Jan. 13, mark the boldest effort yet in Florida politicians\u2019 long-running battle over property taxes.\nOne of the measures would wipe out local non-school taxes on homesteads. Others would expand exemptions or create new ones tied to property insurance coverage.\nOrlando and Orange County are among the localities that warn the plans could destabilize budgets that rely on\nproperty taxes\nto fund police, fire, parks and basic infrastructure.\nHouse Speaker Daniel Perez, a Republican legislator from\nMiami\n, said lawmakers want to give voters a \u201cmenu\u201d of options rather than a single plan.\nGov. Ron DeSantis\n, who pushed for eliminating all property taxes, has opposed that approach, warning it could splinter support. But his influence is waning, as a lame-duck governor with no veto power over ballot initiatives.\nLocal officials and fiscal analysts say the proposals threaten to upend municipal finance systems that hinge on the stability of property levies.\nOrlando could lose about $72 million in annual revenue if homestead taxes vanish, while unincorporated Orange County could lose nearly $278 million. Critics argue that loss would inevitably shift the tax burden onto renters and small businesses or force cuts in essential services.\nSupporters, led by GOP legislators and state CFO Blaise Ingoglia, contend property tax growth has become \u201cunsustainable,\u201d arguing homeowners deserve relief amid surging values. Any resolutions that pass the House and Senate with three-fifths majorities will appear on a statewide ballot next year and require 60 percent voter approval.\n\u2013 Francisco Alvarado",

        "content": "Redondo Beach city officials have put the kibosh on a proposed residential building on Pacific Coast Highway.\nRedondo Beach Planning Commission members rejected a plan from Redondo Seaside Living to build a four-story building at 401-417 Pacific Coast Highway with residential units above ground-floor retail, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n.\nIt comes two months after the California Second District Court of Appeal\u2019s struck down the city\u2019s housing element, thus creating an opportunity for\nbuilder\u2019s remedy\nin the city once again, where developers can help fill housing gaps by benefiting from fast-tracked approval for affordable developments.\nThe development would have included 49 one-, two- and three-bedroom units and a 61-vehicle garage for residents. The developer applied using density bonus incentives and the provisions of\nAB 2011\nto build larger than zoning rules would normally allow at the site in exchange for including eight apartments set aside for very-low-income and moderate-income households.\nThe proposed development faced pushback from residents as well as members of the Planning Commission. Some residents said city staff didn\u2019t use its discretion to block or force changes to the project, and others said the project would block views of the ocean and increase traffic on the seaside highway.\nCommissioners cited a lack of sufficient parking on site as part of the reasoning for its denial of the project, the Daily Breeze\nreported\n. The officials said that spillover parking from apartment residents onto nearby streets would hinder potential beachgoers\u2019 entry to the coast below and create congestion that would block access to a nearby fire station.\nIf Redondo Seaside Living chooses to appeal the project, the issue would go before the Redondo Beach City Council.\nRedondo Beach has dealt with builder\u2019s remedy in the past and taken steps to prevent its application in the city. In 2023, city officials\nrepeatedly denied\na permit application from\nprominent Los Angeles developer Leo Pustilnikov\nto build a 35-unit mixed-use apartment complex at a\nformer power plant\nat 1021 North Harbor Drive.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Suzy Welch has staked another claim in the Upper East Side.\nAn entity tied to Welch, the author and widow of former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, closed on a $24.2 million condo on Park Avenue, property records show.\nIt\u2019s Welch\u2019s third purchase in the neighborhood in the last seven years. Earlier this month, she listed her townhouse at 160 East 81st Street, just blocks away, for $26 million.\nIt\u2019s not clear if Welch plans to live in the home. A chief of staff for Welch said, \u201cyour information is incorrect\u201d in response to questions about the purchase, but did not elaborate.\nWelch\u2019s new purchase is the penthouse atop the 11-unit pre-war building, which was converted into condos following a 2006 renovation.\nSpanning 7,200 square feet, the five-bedroom apartment sprawls across three stories, including a top-floor landscaped terrace and home theater.\nA private elevator landing leads into a double-sized living room with 10-foot ceilings, herringbone floors and a limestone gas-burning fireplace. The first floor also features a formal dining room overlooking Park Avenue and a wood-paneled library.\nThe second floor holds two more terraces, one of which features an outdoor kitchen and dining area, a primary suite and a sauna.\nThe seller is billionaire hedge funder\nJoseph Edelman\n, who bought the apartment for $30.5 million in 2008. He initially listed it for over $33 million in 2021, but dropped the asking price several times since then. The condo had a last asking price of nearly $27 million.\nCompass\u2019 Maria Manuche had the listing.\nFor Welch, an author and professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, the purchase is the latest in a series of property moves that have come since her husband\u2019s death in 2020.\nIn 2022, Welch sold her Lenox Hill co-op at 834 Park Avenue for\n$21 million\nafter buying it with her husband, Jack, for about $19 million in 2018.\nThat sale came roughly one year after she bought her now-listed townhouse for nearly\n$23 million\nin 2021. The double-wide home spans almost 7,700 square feet and comes with seven bedrooms and seven bathrooms.\nIn 2022, Welch also listed her Hudson Valley estate for\n$25 million\n.\n",

Financial terms of the deal for the six-story, 14,000-square-foot property were not disclosed.\nThe lease was revealed in a memorandum published to public records days before Christmas. The lease doesn\u2019t technically begin until the first day of 2026, but it will run through the end of 2061.\nZeisel could not be reached for comment, while Wharton did not immediately return a request for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe sole broker on the deal was Peter Weisman of Weisman NYC, who shared additional details about what Sutton has in store.\nWharton plans to capitalize on the difference \u201cbetween an increased rent roll and their obligations under the triple net lease,\u201d Weisman told\nTRD\n, pointing to a turnover expected next December on the ground-floor retail space, occupied today by the Veronica Beard clothing boutique.\nWharton also plans to redevelop the upper floors to high-end residential space, according to Weisman; there are five units in place. Weisman applied for rent stabilization exemptions for three floors \u201cas a courtesy to the owner.\u201d\nSutton\u2019s been making moves in Soho. Earlier this year, an entity connected to Ikea purchased 529 Broadway in Soho from Sutton\nfor $213 million\n. The Scandinavian furniture giant will occupy the first and second floors, a space totaling about 25,000 square feet.\nSutton is also in the midst of\nfighting a foreclosure lawsuit\ninitiated by the German bank Helaba on his Herald Square property at 27-29 West 34th Street.\nAs for Zeisel, the ground lease deal allows him to step back from day-to-day management while keeping ownership and avoiding the capital gains tax, for which the implications would have been severe, according to Weisman.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

An LLC led by Servito Morales sold the 6,700-square-foot home, which has six bedrooms and seven and a half bathrooms.\nSuarez\u2019s net worth soared during his time as mayor, from just over $400,000 in 2018 to more than $5 million today, according to financial disclosure records obtained by the\nMiami New Times\n. That net worth included his home in Coconut Grove, investment properties, a $235,000 boat and nearly $600,000 in cryptocurrency. But it did not include his latest home purchase, which closed on Dec. 22.\nThe sale marks one of the priciest non-waterfront home sales in the area.\nThe real estate industry rallied around Suarez during his eight-year tenure as mayor. Suarez helped push through major projects, including the Miami Freedom Park mixed-use stadium development. He was also considered\nMiami\u2019s \u201ctech mayor\u201d\nwho helped woo major Silicon Valley investors to the Magic City.\nAmong his side gigs, Suarez was a private consultant for former developer Rishi Kapoor, who was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly defrauding more than 50 investors who contributed\n$93 million\nfor his real estate projects.\nEileen Higgins\nwas sworn in as mayor days before Suarez\u2019s home purchase closed, following a runoff election earlier this month against former city manager Emilio Gonzalez. Higgins also garnered major support from the real estate industry.\nSuarez\u2019s new home was completed in 2025. It sits on nearly an acre of land with an outdoor grill, fireplace and pool, according to the listing. The property hit the market last summer for just under $10 million.\nMichael Martinez of One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty represented the seller.

        "content": "A longtime anchor of Chicagoland\u2019s Polish-American community is poised for redevelopment, as a local builder lines up a roughly $150 million apartment project to replace the shuttered White Eagle banquet hall.\nNoah Properties plans to raze the restaurant at 6839 North Milwaukee Avenue in Niles and build a 354-unit residential complex across seven acres, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n. The White Eagle, which operated on the site since 1967 and hosted generations of weddings, fundraisers and visiting dignitaries, closed earlier this month.\nBart Przyjemski\n, president of Schiller Park-based Noah Properties, said demolition could begin in January, kicking off a three-phase build expected to wrap up in late 2027. Plans call for clusters of townhouses and four mid-rise buildings designed by Chicago\u2019s\nJonathan Splitt Architects\n, along with a public park, rooftop terraces and a pool.\nIn a nod to the site\u2019s legacy, Przyjemski plans to carve out about 6,000 square feet of retail space along Milwaukee Avenue for a future restaurant, though the concept and operator remain undecided.\nThe developer has zoning approvals in hand but is seeking tax-increment financing to make the numbers work. Village officials are reviewing the request, which would divert future property taxes to help cover project costs.\nAn initial analysis found the development includes \u201ca substantial amount of eligible expenses,\u201d village spokesman Mitch Johnson told the outlet, adding that the public benefits are also significant. Any TIF package would still require Village Board approval.\nPrzyjemski\nsaid the subsidy is needed to address unusually poor soil conditions tied to prior excavation for the Deep Tunnel flood control project. Foundations will have to extend roughly 26 feet deep, he told the outlet, driving up construction costs.\nDemand, however, appears strong. Noah recently completed Novu, a 180-unit rental project a few blocks north at 6633 North Milwaukee, which Przyjemski said is about 60 percent leased. Records show he bought the White Eagle property earlier this month for $5.7 million, financing the purchase with a $3.99 million loan from Genesis Capital.\nThe White Eagle, with capacity for 1,500 guests, welcomed figures ranging from Pope John Paul II to former President Jimmy Carter. Mayor George Alpogianis acknowledged the emotional weight of its closure but said redevelopment is part of the village\u2019s evolution.\nThe project is expected to draw young families and improve the\nMilwaukee Avenue\nstreetscape with landscaping, wider sidewalks and buried power lines. Traffic concerns remain, though officials said a new signal could be added.\nOne last historical question lingers: Beneath the banquet hall\u2019s exterior cladding may be a century-old facade from the Silver Leaf Tavern. The developer is required to see if it can be salvaged and displayed \u2014 a small link to the past amid a major remake.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A $1.5 billion data center campus proposed for San Marcos is back on the city\u2019s agenda after a zoning stalemate, giving\nCentral Texas\nanother shot at a high-stakes test case in the region\u2019s data center boom.\nFort Worth-based Highlander SM One and New Braunfels landowners Donald and Germaine Tuff have restarted the entitlement process for the five-building project at 904 South Francis Harris Lane, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nCity officials and the development team said the application was formally reset in October, teeing it up for its first hearing before the Planning and Zoning Commission in January and the City Council in February.\nThe proposal hasn\u2019t materially changed. At full buildout, the campus would include five\ndata center\nbuildings with 76 megawatts of power capacity each, totaling a $1.5 billion investment. No job count has been released, though most employment would be tied to construction rather than permanent operations.\nThe project has drawn sustained opposition from nearby residents and skepticism from some council members, in part because it\u2019s been conflated with a separate gas-powered\ndata center\nproposed nearby in unincorporated Hays County, according to the publication. This site, however, is different \u2014 and now fully back in play after the council unanimously approved annexation of the remaining 64 acres in August.\nStill, the zoning effort collapsed last time around. Council members voted 5-2 to amend the city\u2019s comprehensive plan in TK, but the move required a six-vote supermajority after the planning commission recommended denial. Rather than triggering a formal denial and mandatory waiting period, the applicant opted to restart the process.\nOne notable shift: Dallas-based\nCyrusOne\nis no longer contractually tied to the development. The data center giant had been associated with the project and even held a community meeting, but delays caused its agreement to expire, Highlander manager John Mayberry said at a Dec. 16 meeting. He added that multiple potential operators remain interested but can\u2019t move forward without zoning in place.\nTo win approval, the developers are offering concessions. They\u2019ve proposed restrictive covenants addressing water use, drainage, impervious cover, noise and LEED standards. Cooling would rely on a closed-loop system requiring a one-time fill of up to 70,000 gallons, with daily water use of roughly 20,000 to 35,000 gallons \u2014 far less than a residential subdivision, city staff said.\nThe stakes are real for\nSan Marcos\n. City officials estimate the project could generate $9 million in property taxes for the city, $15.2 million for the school district and $5.3 million for Hays County. That revenue looms large as the city stares down a projected $13 million budget shortfall by 2029.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Walker &amp; Dunlop disclosed that it may have to repurchase millions of dollars of loans after Freddie Mac discovered borrowers committed\nmortgage fraud\n.\nThe finance and advisory firm revealed in its most recent earnings report and call with analysts that it has received requests from Freddie Mac to repurchase two loan portfolios with $100 million in unpaid balance because of fraudulent documentation submitted by the borrower.\nThe company has already entered into forbearance with Freddie Mac for one of the loan portfolios. It said it expects to enter into forbearance on the second portfolio of loans, totaling $49.3 million. But if it fails to reach an agreement, Walker &amp; Dunlop could be required to repurchase the loans.\nThe firm has hired an outside counsel to investigate suspect transactions in which borrowers may have committed fraud, according to sources familiar with the matter. As part of this process, Walker &amp; Dunlop has put some of its originators who worked on the deals on leave as it looks into the matter, sources said.\nWalker &amp; Dunlop did not return a request for comment.\nThe moves come in light of the federal government\u2019s continued investigation into commercial mortgage fraud. The Department of Justice and the Federal Housing Finance Agency have discovered a variety of schemes in which borrowers were able to obtain mortgages for far more than their properties were worth through inflated financials or purchase prices.\nSo far, the lender\u2019s role in these schemes has been less scrutinized than borrowers. The ease with which borrowers were able to obtain loans has raised questions about the lender\u2019s due diligence and underwriting.\nWalker &amp; Dunlop ranked as the largest Fannie Mae multifamily lender in 2024 with $7 billion in volume.\nAgency lenders such as Walker &amp; Dunlop originate loans and sell them to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. If a borrower commits fraud, the lender is usually responsible for covering Fannie or Freddie\u2019s legal costs or has to repurchase the loans.\nWalker &amp; Dunlop said it expects to use $20 million of its own capital as collateral to indemnify Freddie. It expects to take credit losses tied to the troubled loans in the fourth quarter, the firm\u2019s CFO said in its earnings call with analysts in November.\n\u201cWhile our portfolio performance is exceptional, and we feel extremely good about the credit quality of our book, we continue to investigate, in collaboration with the GSEs (Government Sponsored Enterprises), specific incidences of borrower fraud that took place largely as a result of changes in industry practices in the aftermath of the pandemic,\u201d said Walker and Dunlop\u2019s CFO, Greg Florkowski in the earnings call in November.\nThe firm\u2019s fraudulent loans represent a small fraction of the firm\u2019s overall business. Walker &amp; Dunlop reported a total transaction volume of $15.5 billion in the third quarter.\nWalker and Dunlop did not disclose the names of the borrowers it alleges committed fraud.\nThe firm has made at least three loans to embattled Mordechai Weiss or his wife, Basya Weiss.\nThe Monsey-based\nMordechai Weiss\nis a target of the DOJ and FHFA\u2019s\ninvestigation\n, according to sources familiar with the matter. Weiss is also the subject of a\nlawsuit\nby a lender of a Houston apartment deal over a sham deal where the lender alleges Weiss, along with his title insurer, used a fake purchase to obtain a $69 million loan.\nWalker &amp; Dunlop loans to Weiss\u2019s properties have also led to litigation and foreclosures.\nFannie Mae is seeking to foreclose on a $12 million loan for a multifamily property in Rochester, New York. (Walker &amp; Dunlop originated the loan, sold it to Fannie Mae and then repurchased it in December 2024, according to court documents).\nIn Greenbelt, Maryland, Freddie Mac initiated a foreclosure on a $35 million Walker &amp; Dunlop loan tied to Weiss\u2019s 178-unit multifamily property. Fannie Mae has also sought to foreclose on a $13.5 million Walker &amp; Dunlop loan on a rent-controlled multifamily property in\nEast Orange, New Jersey,\naccording to court documents.",

Landlords are still allowed to raise rents to market rates when new tenants move in. About 651,000 apartments, or approximately three quarters of\nLos Angeles\u2019 multifamily housing\nstock, will be subject to the new\ncaps on rent increases. Owners of older properties will be the most affected, though landlords of exempt apartments worry that the new rules will make it harder to secure tenants with their higher prices, according to the Journal.\n\u201cThe problem facing the nation and most certainly facing our state and city is affordability, and at the core of affordability is the price of housing,\u201d\nMayor Karen Bass\nsaid at a news conference last week after signing the new ordinance. \u201cThis is a step forward.\u201d\nAverage rent for a rent-controlled unit in Los Angeles is about $1,800 per month. Market-rate units typically rent for approximately $2,700.\nMultifamily developers are already shying away from building new properties within Los Angeles city limits. The\nMeasure ULA transfer tax\n, as well as years of rising interest rates, inflation and higher insurance costs, have\npushed developers to explore building\nin other Los Angeles County municipalities. \u201cIt\u2019s been death by a thousand cuts,\u201d\nDaniel Yukelson\n, CEO of landlord trade group Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles, told the Journal.\nCase in point: In the first eight months of this year, the Los Angeles metropolitan area approved the construction of fewer new housing units than the Austin, Texas metro, despite having five times the population, according to census data cited by the Journal.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Intel Corporation\nis looking into expanding its operations in its home city of Santa Clara with two new buildings.\nThe semiconductor chip maker plans to build a new manufacturing plant as well as a central utility building to support the new facility in the Silicon Valley city, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nThe new buildings would rise three stories and span approximately 107,000 square feet in two adjacent structures at Intel\u2019s Bowers Campus at the corner of Bowers Avenue and Central Expressway. Intel has had a presence at this site since the 1970s, according to the Business Times.\nIntel\u2019s Bowers Campus in total encompasses approximately 26 acres. The two proposed buildings would be on a 2.4-acre portion of the Bowers Campus. The company\u2019s main headquarters building is about a mile away at 2200 Mission College Boulevard.\nOne of the planned buildings will include manufacturing space, tools, servers and electrical and power facilities. The utility building will hold equipment for heating, cooling and power to support the manufacturing next door. The company plans to have current employees run the new facilities.\nSanta Clara officials are examining Intel\u2019s architectural review application as the proposal makes its way through the planning process. It\u2019s expected to advance at a hearing early next year before Intel receives building permits for the structures. If approved, construction would begin in the middle of next year and take about a year to complete.\nThe proposal marks the latest change to Intel\u2019s real estate holdings in Santa Clara. The corporation sold one of its industrial properties at 1501 Martin Avenue last month, the Mercury News\nreported\n.\nIntel\u2019s biggest competitor, multi-trillion-dollar chipmaker Nvidia, has similarly been shaking up its real estate holdings in its hometown of Santa Clara. Last month, Nvidia\nsubmitted an architectural review\nfor a new building for its headquarters campus slated to span 692,634 square feet. It\nbought its headquarters campus\noutright last year from Preylock Holdings for $374 million and has bought office buildings. The firm spent hundreds of millions of dollars\nbuying other\nSanta Clara office buildings\nthis year.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Hotel Daphne hasn\u2019t yet been open for a month, and its owners are already planning to make it bigger.\nThe boutique hotel that opened in the Heights earlier this month is preparing a roughly $15 million expansion that would add a two-story, 10-room wing and new amenities to the property at 347 West 20th Street, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n, citing a filing with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation.\nPlans call for 11,832 square feet of new construction, including king suites, a single-story pool bar with an adjoining terrace, event space, an event kitchen and a meeting room. Construction is expected to begin in spring 2026 and wrap up in early 2027, though state\npermit filings\nare preliminary and often change.\nThe expansion would build on the momentum of\nHotel Daphne\u2019s\nfirst phase, which opened Dec. 3 as a joint venture between Austin-based\nBunkhouse Hotels\nand Houston-based Wood Lane Partners. The five-story hotel was pitched as a \u201cneighborhood guest house\u201d meant to blend into the Heights rather than tower over it \u2014 a positioning that\u2019s increasingly common among boutique hospitality operators looking to tap into Houston\u2019s more residential submarkets.\nThe\nhotel\nfeatures an interior courtyard, a library that doubles as event space, a retail shop and an all-day restaurant called Hypsi. Design-wise, the project leans into the Heights\u2019 recycled industrial aesthetic, with painted brick, stepped parapets and steel windows. Bunkhouse handled the interiors in-house. Rooms at Hotel Daphne start at $359 per night.\nThe expansion marks a win for Wood Lane Partners, which has been trying to crack the Heights hotel market for years. An earlier plan for a smaller\nEuropean-style boutique hotel\n, Maison Robert, stalled after receiving approvals in 2019 as the pandemic upended hospitality development. Hotel Daphne finally broke ground in 2023, the same year Bunkhouse launched construction on its first Houston property, Hotel Saint Augustine in Montrose.\nSaint Augustine opened in 2024 and has since picked up a Michelin Key, marking an early win for Bunkhouse\u2019s brand of design-forward hotels in neighborhood settings.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Austin\u2019s\nbiggest leases\nof the year rang in just shy of one million square feet of office space, with about a third of that area in and around the Domain.\nNvidia led the way in planting its flag in northwest Austin, followed by Apple, BigCommerce and Spectrum in 2025.\nCitywide vacancy ticked up slightly to 22.6 percent in the third quarter of 2025, up 0.1 percent from the same period last year, according to a market report from Colliers. The Domain fared much better than the citywide office market, with a vacancy rate of 13.3 percent, thanks to demand from tech companies.\nBut around town, tech, insurance and healthcare companies are pushing millions of square feet back onto the market in the form of subleases giving tenants bargain options while keeping pressure on landlords. There was just under 4 million square feet of sublease space available at the end of the third quarter, CBRE said. The good news is that number is declining, down 14 percent from the same period last year.\nHere are the biggest office leases of the year in Austin, using data compiled from Newmark and Cushman &amp; Wakefield.\nNvidia | 11515 Burnet Road | 99,370 square feet\nNvidia\nsignificantly expanded its Austin presence with a nearly 100,000-square-foot lease at the Brandywine Realty Trust-owned One Uptown at 11515 Burnet Road. The office building is part of Uptown ATX, a mixed-use development near the Domain. Brandywine is billing the $3 billion, 66-acre hub as \u201cAustin\u2019s second downtown.\u201d Nvidia currently has two smaller leases in Austin \u2014 52,000 sq ft on Lakeline Boulevard and 5,000 sq ft off MoPac Expressway \u2014 and it\u2019s unclear if the new lease will consolidate these.\nOffice of the Texas Governor | 400 West 15th Avenue | 94,211 square feet\nGov. Greg Abbott\u2019s office not only renewed its lease at the 17-story downtown office building at 400 West 15th Avenue; it also set out to renovate 53,000 square feet of the Class A space with federal funds. In October, the Governor\u2019s office filed a permit for $2.6 million in renovations with federal funding at the site, according to a\nfiling\nwith the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, though a timeline for work is still unavailable. Austin-based Sixthriver Architects are providing the designs. The renewal doesn\u2019t help much with the glut of vacancies downtown, where the vacancy rate ticked up to 27.8 percent in the third quarter from 27.5 percent in the prior quarter, Colliers said.\nApple | 12365 Riata Trace Parkway B | 94,000 square feet\nApple renewed its lease of the entire building 8 at Endeavor-owned Riata Corporate Park ahead of the opening of its billion-dollar Northwest Austin campus at 6900 West Parmer Lane. The company employs nearly 10,000 people in the metro, positioning itself as one of the region\u2019s largest private employers, with the expectation that its workforce will grow all over the state, especially after CEO Tim Cook committed to a multibillion-dollar investment in U.S. manufacturing focused heavily on the Texas Triangle during a meeting at the White House in August.\nBigCommerce | 11920 Alterra Parkway | 65,000 square feet\nAustin-based BigCommerce took over space at the Domain 11 building that was offered up by Seattle-based Expedia. The lease spans portions of the eighth and ninth floors of the fully-leased, 338,900-square-foot, 16-story office building, at 11920 Alterra Parkway. Expedia didn\u2019t part ways with the neighborhood, as the firm built-out the top four floors of Domain 11, amounting to more than 250,000 square feet of space.\nFresenius Medical Care | 3711 South MoPac Expressway | 61,500 square feet\nThe global provider of products and services for renal disease patients renewed its office lease at The Park on Barton Creek, at 3711 South MoPac Expressway in\nSouthwest\nAustin. Los Angeles-based BH Properties bought the two-building office campus from\nStarwood Capital\nthis spring, after Starwood listed a $200 million Austin office portfolio. Fresenius, which is based in Germany, also operates kidney dialysis care centers throughout the Austin-San Antonio corridor.\nNinjaOne | 301 Congress Avenue | 60,000 square feet\nNinjaOne took a 60,000-square-foot bite out of the\n100,000-square-foot space RetailMeNot\nput on the sublease market. The 22-story, 436,855-square-foot downtown office tower was built in 1985. It served as RetailMeNot\u2019s headquarters until Ziff Davis acquired the company in 2020, after which it became a hub for all Ziff Davis\u2019 Austin-area employees.\nBasePower | 205 East Riverside Drive | 43,122 square feet\nThe Austin-based power company, which focuses on leasing out residential home backup batteries, renewed its full-building lease at 205 East Riverside Drive. The 44,000-square-foot office building is just south of downtown Austin. In 2025, the startup raised $1 billion in investments.\nSpectrum | 11921 North Mopac Expressway | 40,536 square feet\nThe international internet service provider renewed its second-floor lease at the Domain\u2019s Point 2 in May. The 162,959-square-foot office building sits at the edge of the Domain, overlooking the Mopac Expressway, but it\u2019s within walking distance of the restaurants and hotels that comprise the retail portion of the district.\nSonarSource | 206 East 9th Street | 37,454 square feet\nThe developer of AI coding tools renewed its 37,000-square-foot downtown lease in Capitol Tower, a 9-story, 178,600-square-foot office built in 1984 and renovated in 2018. The building is about 78 percent leased.\nBazaarvoice | 10901 Stonelake Boulevard | 36,592 square feet\nThe Austin-based software company that helps companies interpret user-generated content such as ratings and reviews, renewed its sublease at Quarry Oaks III, a 4-story 138,307-square-foot office built in 2015. The building sits across the Mopac Expressway from the Domain and J. J. Pickle Research Campus of the University of Texas.\n",

        "content": "Six of the 10 priciest multifamily deals in Los Angeles County were located in the City of L.A., meaning they were taxed extra via Measure ULA, which has slowed commercial trades but wasn\u2019t enough to keep these parties from buying or selling.\nThe 10 deals combined total about $1.2 billion, and the six within the City of Los Angeles accounted for approximately $45 million in Measure ULA taxes, which come at a 5.5 percent rate on sales of more than $10.5 million.\nThis ranking is based on\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nanalysis of data via CBRE and Kidder Mathews through late-September and prior reporting. While there is still time for potential record-breakers, these are the deals that make the top 10 for 2025 by publication.\n1. Kitt at Warner Center\nWaterton\npurchased\nthe apartment complex in Woodland Hills, a neighborhood on the edge of the Santa Monica Mountains in the San Fernando Valley, for about $180 million, or roughly $345,000 per apartment. The seller, AMLI Residential, developed the property at 21200 Kittridge Street around two decades ago. It is within the master-planned community Warner Center, where billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Rams Stanley Kroenke has proposed a $10 billion development. The city transfer tax came out to about $12 million.\nWaterton recently announced it purchased another apartment community at 21021 Erwin Street in Woodland Hills, less than five minutes away from Kitt at Warner Center, but didn\u2019t disclose price.\n2. Ovelo\nAEW Capital Management\npurchased\nthe seven-story apartment complex in Hollywood for $159 million, or about $431,000 per apartment. The sellers were Cal-Coast Development and Rescore, a real estate investment trust managed by Encore Capital Management. They developed the project\u00a0 at 1331 North Cahuenga Boulevard. The city transfer tax, which comprises a base tax and a special tax via Measure ULA, came out to about $9.5 million.\n3. Stella\nCarmel Partners\nbought\nStella, an apartment building in Marina del Rey, from Nuveen for $141 million, or about $578,000 an apartment, the priciest per unit deal on our ranking \u2014 and the priciest multifamily trade in Marina del Rey in more than a decade. Still, it\u2019s 15 percent less than what Nuveen paid for the property at 13488 Maxella Avenue. The city transfer tax came out to roughly $8 million.\n4. Chase Knolls\nJRK Property Holdings purchased the apartment complex in Sherman Oaks, a neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley, for $129 million, or about $322,000 per apartment from Waterton (our ranking\u2019s number one buyer).

        "content": "In 2025, rental brokers were handed a new playbook and New York City elected a Democratic Socialist.\nVoters signed off on changes that could transform a political dynamic that has guided rezonings for decades. A fatal shooting at a Midtown office tower raised questions about how best to protect tenants.\nThese and other stories had a major impact on real estate this year, and will continue to influence the industry in the years ahead.\nHere are some of 2025\u2019s most consequential New York real estate stories:\n1) Shooting at 345 Park Avenue\nThe tragic\nshooting\nof four people at Rudin Management\u2019s 345 Park Avenue deeply affected\nfriends, family and colleagues\nof the victims, and ramped up discussions about office security in the city.\nOn July 27, Shane Devon Tamura walked into the office tower with an assault rifle and killed three people in the lobby:\nWesley LePatner\n, chief executive officer of Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust; NYPD officer Didarul Islam; and Aland Etienne, a security guard.\nHe then took the elevator to Rudin\u2019s offices on the 33rd floor, thinking it was where the National Football Association is headquartered. There, he shot and killed\nJulia Hyman\n, an associate at Rudin, before turning the gun on himself.\nThe deaths left the real estate community reeling and sparked\nconversations\nabout potential ways to prevent future incidents and the\nlimitations\nof buildings already equipped with the best technology and security practices. A month after the shootings, Reps. Jerrold Nadler and Dan Goldman called on Congress to pass\ngun safety legislation\nthat, among other things, bans assault weapons and enacts universal background checks. (The gun used by Tamura was illegal to possess in New York but was purchased lawfully in Nevada.)\nThe shootings also inspired the City Council to pass legislation\nsetting minimum wages\nfor security guards and increasing training requirements.\n2)\nMamdani wins mayoral race\nReal estate professionals\ndonated\nmillions of dollars to political action committees\nbacking\nformer Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s run for mayor. When Zohran Mamdani\ndefeated\nhim in the primary (along with several other candidates vying for the job), some in the industry\nhoped\nMayor Eric Adams could gain enough momentum ahead of the general election, though such optimism didn\u2019t last long as the mayor trailed in the polls.\nDuring his campaign, the Democratic Socialist outlined several priorities that rankled landlords and the broader business community, including a promise to freeze rents on stabilized apartments for four years and to push the state to raise corporate and income taxes on the state\u2019s wealthiest.\nStill, Mamdani has also said that he is committed to reforming the city\u2019s property tax system and finding other ways to reduce costs for owners.\n3) Mortgage fraud saga\nFederal agencies ramped up their mortgage fraud investigations this year, extending an already\ntangled web\nof sponsors,\nattorneys\n, title agents and others. These parties were accused of perpetrating schemes that often involved\ninflated financials\nor sales prices to secure larger loans from various lenders.\nThis year saw the sentencing of some key players, including\nMoshe Silber\n, Fred Schulman,\nBaruch Drillman\nand\nEli Puretz\n. These cases involved properties and players outside New York but had larger implications for New York City-based firms. Fannie Mae blacklisted some title firms that were mentioned in fraud cases, though it\nreinstated\nMadison Title as an approved vendor in June.\n4) FARE Act goes into effect\nThe Fairness in Apartment Rental Expenses, or FARE Act,\nwent into effect\non June 11. The new law requires whoever hires a rental broker to pay said broker\u2019s fee. A broker who publishes a listing, however, is assumed to have been hired by the property\u2019s owner. In its\nlawsuit\nchallenging the law, the Real Estate Board of New York alleged that this provision violates the First Amendment because it discourages a specific type of speech (listings). REBNY has\nappealed\nthe case to the Second Circuit and is waiting on a decision.\nPublic rental\nlistings\nhave dropped and median rent prices have increased since the law was implemented, but it is tricky to disentangle the\nimpact\nof the law from other factors that influence such shifts, such as lack of supply and high demand.\n5) Housing approval overhaul\nMayor Eric Adams is leaving office with a legacy complicated by scandal. He was the first sitting mayor in recent history to face\ncriminal charges\n, which were\ndropped\nat the behest of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration in what was seen (including by federal prosecutors who resigned over it) as a trading of favors between the president and mayor.\nBut the Adams administration also shepherded major changes that will allow more housing to be built throughout the city. City of Yes for Housing Opportunity was approved last year, and this year, the mayor\u2019s Charter Revision Commission placed four proposals on the ballot that would allow certain housing projects to either sidestep City Council approval or would allow the City Council\u2019s rejection of a project to be appealed.\nThe measures,\napproved\nby voters in November, shorten some project approval timelines and weaken the tradition of member deference, in which Council members voted on land use issues according to the wishes of the local member. To what extent these changes lead to more housing remains to be seen, and will rely on many factors, including capital available for housing and the relationship between the next mayor and City Council leaders.\n",

        "content": "Eric Adams\u2019 administration is leaving Zohran Mamdani with another task: fixing the Hunts Point Produce Market.\nAdams announced a project to redevelop the Bronx wholesale complex responsible for distributing much of the city\u2019s fresh fruit and vegetables, Bloomberg\nreported\n. The project comes as the aging facility is weighed down by pollution and old infrastructure.\nExpected to cost $635 million, the redevelopment is expected to replace the facility with an all-electric market with better access to freight and rail transport. A joint venture led by Aurora Contractors and Primus Builders will eliminate diesel-powered transport refrigeration units, add refrigerated warehouse space and increase site-wide circulation, according to\nNew York YIMBY\n.\nFinancing for the project is split relatively evenly between federal grants ($145 million), New York City ($130 million) and New York State ($130 million). The city is also expecting to land $230 million in federal debt from the Department of Transportation.\nThe 100-acre facility handles more than 2.5 billion pounds of fruits and vegetables annually and is responsible for supplying approximately a quarter of the city\u2019s produce to its restaurants, bodegas and independent grocers.\nIn addition to creating 2,000 construction jobs, the redevelopment is expected to preserve existing employment at the facility. The next step in the project will be design work and environmental reviews overseen by the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation. Construction is being targeted for a start late next year.\n\u201cThis agreement represents an important milestone and creates a clear framework for the next phase of work as we advance planning and design for a modern, more sustainable market that supports our mission of feeding New York City with fresh produce from around the world,\u201d said Hunts Point Produce Market co-president Stephen Katzman, who added that he looked forward to collaborating with the Mamdani administration on the project.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Caesars owns the gambling facility, formerly\nIsle Casino\n.\nMillrose entered into an option arrangement giving Lennar the right to acquire the finished homesites, a structure that keeps the homebuilder\u2019s balance sheet relatively light on land while preserving control of future inventory.\nMillrose typically acquires residential land, installs infrastructure and then sells finished lots back to Lennar through option contracts shortly before the homes are sold to buyers.\nLennar filed plans in 2024 with 344 condos in seven midrise buildings and 82 townhouses in 10 three-story buildings, along with a clubhouse, fitness center, pool and 878 parking spaces.\nThe project reflects Lennar\u2019s increasing focus on multifamily-style, midrise residential buildings in land-constrained South Florida markets where assembling large tracts for traditional single-family subdivisions has become difficult.\nThe condo and townhouse community represents the latest residential phase at The Pomp, where Harrah\u2019s casino and a TopGolf facility are already operating, and developers are rolling out industrial and apartment components.\nIn 2022, TopGolf paid\n$14.7 million\nfor a nearly 11-acre site, where it built a three-story entertainment facility. A year later, Cordish and Caesars sold 87.8 acres within The Pomp to Boston-based Rockpoint, which is planning 1.5 million square feet of warehouses.

        "content": "Lenders across the Chicago metro went to court this year to settle troubled loans, bringing major foreclosure lawsuits downtown, in the suburbs and on the South Side.\nThe distress spread into hospitality, retail and even niche assets such as downtown parking garages, but the city\u2019s office buildings were the major target. Chicago\u2019s office market has\nstruggled to recover\nfrom the pandemic-era drop-off, with vacancy rates still twice as high as their pre-pandemic level. In October, the central business district\u2019s vacancy rate hit 28 percent, according to CBRE.\nThe Real Deal\ntallied the largest foreclosure lawsuits we saw in 2025. Properties are listed along with the amount lenders are looking to recover.\nThe list includes only cases where lenders filed foreclosure lawsuits. In some cases, landlords were able to stay out of court by handing over the keys to buildings through deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure. In other instances, lenders and special servicers refused compromise and went to court.\nIllinois Center | $260 million\nIn a dispute that spilled into court in 2024 but continued through 2025, AmTrust Realty\u2019s grip on the massive Illinois Center complex slipped after months of trying to stave off distress.\nIn November 2024, special servicer LNR Partners\nfiled to foreclose\non the New York-based landlord\u2019s $260 million loan for the two-tower property at 111 East Wacker Drive and 233 North Michigan Avenue. The trouble started when the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services vacated 170,000 square feet in 2023, leaving a hole in the 2.1 million-square-foot complex.\nAmTrust CEO Jonathan Bennett had previously claimed the firm was working toward a resolution, but LNR alleged the landlord stopped paying full debt service in January. Complicating matters, LNR claimed AmTrust never properly updated the loan\u2019s guarantor after the 2016 death of co-founder Michael Karfunkel\u2014a technical default that could pile on massive interest penalties.\n1100 South Michigan &amp; 1101 South Wabash | $187 million\nSu-Mei Yen, a longtime fixture in Chicago\u2019s hospitality scene, faced a double-barreled legal crisis this summer.\nSan Francisco-based lender ACORE Capital hit Yen and her firm, SB Yen, with a\n$187 million foreclosure suit\ntargeting two major South Loop hotels: the 172-room Best Western Grant Park and the 30-story Homewood Suites by Hilton. ACORE alleged that Yen\u2019s firm not only defaulted on the loan but also failed to deposit hotel revenues into the required accounts, diverting cash to pay back affiliates instead.\nThe foreclosure came as Yen battled a separate lawsuit from Chinese EB-5 investors who claim they were defrauded out of over $18 million meant for the projects. The investors allege Yen and her daughter, Cassie Yen, mismanaged funds and intentionally allowed the loans to default, jeopardizing their green card prospects.\nACORE has been coming after debtors elsewhere in Chicago this year. The lender\nseized a 16-story River North building\nfrom landlord JRE Partners in September through a deed-in-lieu. Property records show JRE borrowed $73 million from ACORE to finance the purchase, and the deed in lieu valued the property at nearly $60 million.\nWestbrook Corporate Center | $87 million\nIn the suburbs, CWCapital Asset Management rejected a lowball buyout offer from Group RMC and instead\nfiled an $87 million foreclosure\nsuit against the New York-based landlord.\nGroup RMC had offered to buy out the note on the five-building Westbrook Corporate Center in Westchester for $52.5 million\u2014roughly half the loan\u2019s original balance\u2014after a major tenant, Follett Higher Education Group, slashed its footprint.\nDespite the landlord\u2019s offer to inject $6 million in fresh equity to stabilize the 1.1 million-square-foot campus, CWCapital rejected the proposal and moved to seize the property. It\u2019s a harsh blow for Group RMC, which had spent the last few years aggressively acquiring suburban office campuses across the Midwest, betting on a recovery that has yet to materialize.\nRuben Espinoza\u2019s Southwest Side Portfolio | $68 million\nFlorida-based investor Ruben Espinoza spent 2025 mired in legal fights, capped by a\n$68 million foreclosure filed\nby Wilmington National Trust on two Southwest Side commercial properties.\nThe unpaid debt is split between two properties: Espinoza allegedly owes $43 million, including interest and fees, on the 661,000-square-foot Chicago Business Center at 2600 West 35th Street, according to Wilmington. He owes another $24 million at a 110,000-square-foot distribution center on South Damen Avenue.\nA receiver has already been appointed to take control of the assets, but that was just the start of Espinoza\u2019s legal troubles this year.\nEspinoza is\nfacing a lawsuit\nfrom a commercial tenant at the South Damen Avenue building Wilmington is foreclosing on. Produce wholesaler Galfresh Produce alleges Espinoza took a deposit and first month\u2019s rent but never allowed them to move into the building.\nEspinoza\nsued business partner Igor Gabal\nover a $6.2 million insurance payout at a West Adams Street building. Both investors are claiming the other misappropriated funds and trying to shut each other out of shared bank accounts. In October, a judge\nordered Espinoza to pay $631,000\nin a separate case where state Sen. Robert F. Martwick Jr. accused Espinoza of not paying Martwick\u2019s law firm.\nElsewhere, Espinoza is\nbatting a lender\nwho is moving to foreclose on a $9.6 million loan tied to a River North loft portfolio. Rialto Capital filed a foreclosure in March, but Espinoza is disputing the foreclosure.\nThe Poetry Garage | $33 million\nIn a dispute over a downtown parking garage, lender Swiss Re wasn\u2019t satisfied with taking back the troubled building. It came after the investors too.\nLender Swiss Re\nmoved to foreclose over a $33 million loan\non the literary-themed Poetry Garage at 201 West Madison Street. The investor group led by\u00a0 Richard Kaplan of Syndicated Equities and John Hammerschlag of Hammerschlag &amp; Co. defaulted on the loan in March, reinsurance giant Swiss Re said in court.\nSwiss Re gained control of the property with a $21.5 million credit bid this fall, and later secured a $9.6 million deficiency judgment against the owner group to cover the rest of the loan balance.\nThe investors had struggled with the parking structure since the pandemic decimated Loop office occupancy, securing multiple loan modifications before finally defaulting on the $33.2 million debt when it matured this spring.\n",

The location spans five parcels: 36-45 37th Street, 47-61 37th Street, 36-61 37th Street, 37-21 Northern Boulevard and 37-15 Northern Boulevard.\nThe properties are owned by Vesta Industries and Vecta Industries, according to property records. The site was once a Cadillac dealership \u2014 even featured in the 1990 movie \u201cCadillac Man\u201d \u2014 before recently housing the stage lighting equipment supplier arm of Kaufman Astoria Studios.\nTerms of the 10-year lease \u2014 which encompasses a warehouse, mechanic shop and showroom space \u2014 were not disclosed. The average asking rent for Queens industrial space in the third quarter was $34.27 per square foot, according to CBRE.\nJaffe Realty\u2019s Brian Jaffe represented the tenant in the deal, while Sholom &amp; Zuckerbrot Realty\u2019s Franklin Zuckerbrot and Joe Eliasoph represented the owner.\nThe Long Island City location will be Teddy Volkswagen\u2019s second in the city, following the operation of a dealership in the Bronx. The newest location is expected to generate 100 local jobs, according to the car dealer.\nThe flagship is across the boulevard from the Standard Motors Product Building, involved in its own real estate transaction in recent months.\nIn September, Scott Rechler\u2019s RXR\nsold\nthe property at 37-18 Northern Boulevard to Jack Guttman\u2019s Pearl Realty Management for $42 million. The sale of the 300,000-square-foot Queens office building broke down to $140 per square foot; Rechler purchased the former automotive parts manufacturing facility\nfor $110 million\nin 2014.\nOther notable dealership leases in the past 18 months include Ferrari signing a 10-year lease for 7,600 square feet at 425 Park Avenue in April for a showroom and private club Classic Car Club Manhattan taking 60,000 square feet for a flagship at 645 11th Avenue in Hell\u2019s Kitchen last June.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "California is entering an affordable housing refinancing crunch, with Yardi Matrix reporting that roughly $860 million in commercial mortgages on fully affordable properties will mature in 2026.\nThat figure rises sharply to $6.9 billion by 2030 and $13.3 billion over the next decade, underscoring the scale of upcoming capital needs. The 2026 maturities are concentrated in the state\u2019s largest markets:\nLos Angeles\n($390.3 million), the\nBay Area\n($223.1 million), Orange County ($64.1 million), and the San Fernando Valley ($76 million),\nGlobest reported\n. That\u2019s a total of $21 billion needed in the next three years.\nDespite these looming maturities, the sector is not facing widespread distress.\nAffordable housing benefits from government-backed financing, subsidized revenue streams and longer loan terms, all of which have historically limited defaults. Recent policy changes in the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act further reinforce stability. Enhancements to the\nLow-Income Housing Tax Credit program\nare expected to\nexpand opportunities\nfor recapitalization through resyndication, supporting both capital improvements and long-term affordability.\nYardi\u2019s analysis draws from a national database of 26,000 fully affordable properties \u2014 defined as assets where at least 90 percent of units are rent-restricted through government programs \u2014 totaling 3.5 million units.\nIndustry leaders echo the view that the refinancing environment, while challenging, remains fundamentally strong.\nCalifornia continues to attract lender participation due to high rental demand, meaningful rent advantages, and regulatory frameworks such as the Community Reinvestment Act and mandates for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, according to JLL\u2019s David Lott. State-level supports \u2014 including the California Welfare Exemption and various soft subordinate debt programs\n\u2014 further bolster refinancing prospects.\nLott highlighted the recent reduction of the LIHTC \u201c50 percent test\u201d to 25 percent, a shift expected to unlock constrained tax-exempt bond capacity and stimulate both renovation and new development. The new law stipulates that to qualify for 4 percent bonds, a property must have at least 25 percent of its units affordable, compared to a previous threshold of half.\nFrom a talent perspective, the new market is \u201ccreating opportunity\u201d for people with the right skill set, Chris Papa of executive search firm Jackson Lucas told Globest.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing owners, lenders, and public agencies prioritize leaders who know how to navigate complex capital stacks, work with government programs, and stabilize assets,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, refinancing will be more complicated in a higher-rate, higher-cost environment \u2014 but that pressure is precisely what\u2019s driving demand for experienced talent.\u201d\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s housing market is refusing to take the hint.\nWhile home prices across much of the country are flattening out or sliding, the Chicago area just posted the fastest price growth of any major U.S. metro, highlighting the city\u2019s durability even as buyers feel a squeeze from inflation and higher interest rates. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat the median home price in the Chicago region rose by\u00a0 5.83 percent in October, to $365,000, from a year earlier, according to S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices data released Tuesday. That was the highest increase among the 19 major cities tracked in the report and more than four times the national growth rate of 1.36 percent. (Detroit was excluded this month because of incomplete data.)\nThe gain also comfortably\noutpaced inflation\n. While a federal government shutdown delayed a national inflation reading for October, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported\nChicago-area\ninflation of 2.9 percent in September and 2.5 percent in November, putting local home price growth at roughly twice the pace of rising consumer prices.\nIt marked the second consecutive month Chicago topped the Case-Shiller leaderboard. In September, prices were up 5.45 percent year over year, again roughly four times the national increase, according to the index.\nNicholas Godec, head of fixed income tradables and commodities at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, said in a statement that Chicago now leads all major markets, breaking with a slight decline in inflation-adjusted home values over the past year nationally.\nThe broader picture shows just how much Chicago is swimming\nagainst the current\n. According to the index, home prices fell in nine of the 19 cities tracked in October and were essentially flat in four others. Tampa posted the steepest annual drop, down 4.17 percent. New York was the next-strongest major market after Chicago, with prices up 4.95 percent, followed by Cleveland at 4.06 percent.\nA year ago,\nChicago\nwas rising quickly but not wildly out of step with the nation. In October 2024, prices here were up 6.24 percent year over year, compared to a national gain of 3.6 percent. Since then, growth elsewhere has cooled sharply. Nationwide price growth is now running at about 62 percent of its pace a year ago, while Chicago\u2019s is still at roughly 93 percent.\nThe resilience traces back to the pandemic boom, when Chicago never fully joined the froth. At the peak in October 2021, local prices were up 11.5 percent annually \u2014 the slowest growth among the 20 Case-Shiller cities \u2014 while places like Phoenix surged more than 30 percent.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "South Florida real estate hit highs and lows in 2025, but construction financing flowed \u2014 for the right projects \u2014 and billionaire developers and investors like Amancio Ortega and Steve Ross pumped money into the tri-county region.\nOffice and multifamily developers backpedalled, despite a series of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Condo developers slogged through the summer, but demand picked up in the fall.\nDrama in the real estate scene was wilder than\n\u201cMembers Only: Palm Beach,\u201d\nfrom\ncondo association fights\nto legal battles involving some of the\nbiggest real estate dynasties\n.\nMeanwhile, in Tallahassee, Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Legislature pitched a number of proposals to\nreduce or eliminate property taxes\n\u2014 the fate of those will be determined in 2026.\nThe industry also mourned the deaths of influential players.\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the top stories of the year:\nBillionaire moves\nRoss, owner of the Miami Dolphins and founder and CEO of Related Ross, is among the billionaires making moves. Ross has about a dozen office properties (completed and in the pipeline) in West Palm Beach and was one of the most successful office landlords this year. Of this year\u2019s 10 biggest office leases in South Florida, Related Ross was the only landlord to sign a new-to-market firm: tech company ServiceNow took space at one of Ross\u2019 office buildings.\nRoss made downtown West Palm his\nplayground\nthrough Related Ross, his new company. His portfolio includes at least 18 buildings and a mixed-use complex collectively spanning more than 3.8 million square feet of offices, retail and restaurants, as well as about 1,500 condo, apartment and hotel units, according to\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nanalysis.\nZara billionaire Ortega doubled down on South Florida, making two big plays in Miami-Dade in 2025: his family office paid\n$274.4 million\nfor the 30-story Sabadell Financial Center in Brickell in October. A month earlier, the family office paid about\n$110 million\nfor Atlas Plaza in Miami\u2019s Design District.\nWe can\u2019t ignore Ken Griffin, billionaire hedge fund manager, who acquired fewer properties than in previous years but is still moving forward with plans for a\n$2.5 billion\nbayfront supertall in Miami that will house his Citadel hedge fund and sister firm, Citadel Securities. He also scored approval for a 30,000-plus-square-foot private marina with a crew pavilion, owner\u2019s suite and a pool on Terminal Island in Miami Beach.\nOn the residential front, Rockstar Energy billionaire\nRussell Savage\n, previously known as Russell Weiner, picked up trophy properties in Palm Beach County and Miami Beach as he builds his ultra-luxury residential portfolio.\nMegadeals\nDealflow at the highest end of the market soared to new levels.\nOak Row Equities and Vlad Doronin\u2019s OKO Group closed last month on their\nrecord $520 million\npurchase of Aimco\u2019s waterfront Brickell assemblage, where they plan an Aman-branded hotel and residential development. Mariposa Real Estate is also a partner. The deal marks the priciest development site sale in South Florida.\nOff-market resi sales set city and county records as well. In Palm Beach, billionaire cosmetics mogul\nWilliam Lauder\nreportedly sold 2.3 oceanfront acres for more than $160 million to billionaire Microsoft Excel creator Charles Simonyi, as part of a $350 million assemblage on the island. The deal was not recorded publicly.\nTwo Roads hits dead end in condo buyout litigation\nTwo Roads Development took a big blow in October, when Florida\u2019s Supreme Court\ndeclined to take up\nthe Biscayne 21 condo buyout case.\nThe story is complicated, but it started in 2022, when Taylor Collins and Reid Boren\u2019s Two Roads acquired the majority of condos at Biscayne 21, an older Miami condo building in Edgewater. The developer-controlled condo association then voted to amend the condo declaration\u2019s termination statute, lowering the threshold to 80 percent from 100 percent. A termination of the association is a required legal step so the developer could eventually knock the building down.\nTwo Roads launched sales later that year of an Edition Residences planned for the site. Then, the holdout owners sued the developer and the developer-controlled association. All the residents eventually had to move out, and the building is no longer habitable.\nThe lawsuit moved its way through the courts, and the Third District Court of Appeal issued an opinion earlier this year siding with the holdout unit owners. The court affirmed that the original condo declaration required unanimous consent for termination, invalidating the developer-controlled association\u2019s amendment.\nThe developer vowed to take the issue to Florida\u2019s Supreme Court, but the court\ndeclined to hear the issue\n, giving the holdout owners more leverage. Many expect Two Roads will settle with them.\nIn memoriam\nThe industry mourned the deaths of influential players, including developer\nDonald Soffer\n, who founded the city of Aventura.\nDarin Tansey, a longtime residential agent in Miami Beach, died unexpectedly in September at the age of 50. The Douglas Elliman agent moved to the city nearly two decades earlier, and built his business in the luxury sector. Tansey was a mentor to many:\ntributes poured in\nonline and at a celebration of life held at the La Gorce Country Club.\nIn August, Isaac Kodsi, a developer and real estate attorney,\ndied at the age of 59\nat his Coconut Grove home. Isaac, the brother of developer Dan Kodsi, was developing Arbor Residences, a previously stalled condo project he acquired out of foreclosure in 2023. Kodsi also founded Shake Wellness, a trampoline-based fitness business that he ran out of his home.\nMultifamily developers list their sites\nMany developers\nput their sites up for sale\nin 2025, in part due to higher construction costs, interest rates, a supply overhang and slower rent growth. A flood of completed projects in 2023 and 2024 suppressed rent growth, with prices falling in some neighborhoods, and developers had to offer tenants concessions to lease up their buildings.\nAt\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s Miami Forum in November, developers\npushed back\non the idea that a supply overhang exists. Developers Bruce Menin, Erik Rutter and Joe Lubeck instead pointed to skittish equity investment and other barriers to entry.\nA recent uptick in construction loans for multifamily projects suggests the market may be improving. In one of the larger deals that was recorded in December, Focus and Group Fox scored a\n$250 million construction loan\nfor their planned multifamily tower called Brickell Starlite, on the site of the former Starlite Motel at 128 Southwest Seventh Street in Miami.\n",

        "content": "A Beverly Hills residence with an A-list history that includes crooner Ricky Martin sold for $35 million, making a big splash to cap 2025.\nThe purchase price of\n1309 Davies Drive\n, which neighbors some of the market\u2019s most legendary homes, amounts to over $3,804 per square foot, according to listing sites. That would be a steal given the residence first hit the market in August for $75 million. Later that month, the price was reduced to just under $50 million.\nCarl Gambino\nof the Gambino Group at Compass represented the buyer and the seller. He declined to comment on the sale Wednesday.\nThe sale of 1309 Davies Drive is now one of Gambino\u2019s priciest Beverly Hills closings this year, after representing the buyer in the April sale of 942 North Alpine Drive for $51.8 million.\nA deed on the Davies Drive property with the buyer\u2019s information is not yet available, as the transaction closed Tuesday.\nProperty records show a shell company bearing the home\u2019s address for its name as the seller. It\u2019s registered with a Broomfield, Colo. address with ties to Blue Spruce Capital Corp.\nIt\u2019s the home\u2019s previous ownership dating back to before the LLC bought the property that makes for a robust celebrity lineage.\nAside from Martin, Oscar winner Michael Caine, who appeared in \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d and \u201cThe Cider House Rules\u201d also once called the property home, as did the family of singer and actress Doris Day.\nSurrounding the property are some of the market\u2019s most prominent residences and listings.\nThat includes 1261 Angelo Drive, also known as the\nPritzker Estate\n, listed for $175 million. A roughly 10-minute walk from the Davies Drive property will get someone to the residence being sold by Hyatt Hotels heir Anthony Pritzker and his ex-wife and philanthropist Jeanne Pritzker.\nA little farther out is Chartwell Estate at 875 Nimes Road. The property sits about 3 miles away and is known for its appearance in the opening credits of \u201cThe Beverly Hillbillies.\u201d\nLachlan Murdoch\n, son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, paid $150 million for Chartwell Estate in 2019 to notch a state record at the time. That\u2019s since been eclipsed by 2024\u2019s\n$210 million sale\nof a Malibu home once owned by Oakley founder Jim Jannard.\nThe new resident of 1309 Davies Drive is working with quite the spread. The six-bedroom, 12-bathroom home sits on over 2 acres.\nIn addition to the main residence, the estate has a motor court for over 20 vehicles, a tennis court, a children\u2019s playground, gardens, a separate house for security as well as a guest house.\n",

        "content": "Owner-user deals that have become popular in Houston are spreading north to Dallas.\nProvident Realty Advisors is the latest company to choose office ownership over leasing in the acquisition of One Lincoln Park, a 10-story office building at 8401 North Central Expressway near Northwest Highway. The Dallas Morning News first reported the trade, citing Dallas County deed records.\nThe\nfirm\ndescribed the property as \u201cour future home\u201d in a LinkedIn post announcing the deal, signaling plans to occupy the building rather than treat it as a pure investment play, a trend that has been playing out elsewhere in the\nTexas Triangle\n, specifically Houston.\nOwner-user deals \u2014 meaning deals where the business using the space buys the property rather than leasing it \u2014 have boosted Houston\u2019s sluggish office sector, where depressed values make buying more appealing than leasing.\nThe seller was Dallas-based\nTriumph Financial\n, which bought the property just last year with plans to make it its own headquarters. The transaction closed Dec. 17. A purchase price was not disclosed, though the Dallas Central Appraisal District values the 257,000-square-foot building at nearly $56.6 million.\nColliers executive vice president Jack Crews led the brokerage team that assisted Provident in the acquisition.\nTriumph\u2019s quick flip underscores the opportunistic churn still shaping the Dallas-Fort Worth office market. The financial holding company, whose portfolio includes TriumphPay, Triumph and TBK Bank, acquired the property in 2024 in an off-market, all-cash deal after Atlanta-based Piedmont Office Realty Trust owned it for roughly a decade. Piedmont sold the building for $54 million.\nAt the time of Triumph\u2019s purchase, the building was just 12 percent occupied, according to Colliers data. Triumph began clearing out tenants as part of a plan to reposition the 1999-vintage property \u2014 which was renovated in 2022 \u2014 ahead of a headquarters move-in slated for 2026.\nBut market interest intervened. As conditions improved, the company decided selling was in its best interest.\n\u201cWhile our initial plan was to make it our headquarters, we received significant interest from potential buyers during the preparation phase,\u201d Triumph Financial said in a statement.\nProvident\u2019s\nbuy comes as the DFW office market shows signs of stabilization, though the recovery remains uneven. Leasing activity picked up last quarter, helping push the region\u2019s overall vacancy rate down 30 basis points to 25 percent, according to Partners Real Estate\u2019s third-quarter 2025 report.\nThat momentum has largely favored newer, well-located buildings, reinforcing a flight-to-quality trend that continues to punish older stock and downtown submarkets. Downtown Dallas posted a 27.2 percent vacancy rate, the second-highest of any U.S. downtown, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Mayor Eric Adams\u2019\nefforts to stack the Rent Guidelines Board\nhave hit a snag.\nLliam Finn, a senior financial advisor with Merrill Lynch, has decided against serving as a public representative on the board less than two weeks after Adams appointed him, three sources with knowledge of the decision confirmed to\nThe Real Deal\nWednesday. This gives the mayor less than 12 hours to find a replacement appointment before he leaves office. It is unclear if he will be able to do so.\nA spokesperson for the mayor did not immediately comment. Finn did not return a message seeking more information.\nAdams this month announced\nthe appointment of two new members\nto the board, Finn and Sagar Sharma, an attorney with Legal Services NYC\u2019s housing unit, as a tenant representative.\nHe also reappointed landlord attorney Christina Smyth as an owner representative and Arpit Gupta as a public one.\nThe last-minute appointments were viewed by some as an attempt to sabotage Mayor-elect\nZohran Mamdani\u2019s campaign pledge to freeze rents\nfor stabilized tenants for four years. The city\u2019s Rent Guidelines Board decides what rent increases are permitted on one- and two-year leases, though mayors have influenced their decisions.\nThe appointments meant that most of the board\u2019s members in Mamdani\u2019s first year would be Adams\u2019 appointees. He can replace four members (the chair, as well as members whose terms are expired that represent the public, owners and tenants) when he takes office. He can replace the other five in 2027.\nIf Adams doesn\u2019t replace Finn, Mamdani would then have five potential appointees in his first year in office, meaning that he might have an easier time convincing the board of a rent freeze. However, the board is supposed to be an independent body, and a rent freeze could lead to a legal challenge from landlords.\n",

Urbanize Chicago\nreported\nthat the deal was announced by the buyer, which is betting on the corridor\u2019s foot traffic and scarcity of available space rather than another high-rise swing.\nThe\nbuilding\nsits on a 7,900-square-foot site with 75 feet of frontage along Maple Street, a high-visibility stretch just east of State Street. It\u2019s partially occupied, including by CorePower Yoga on the fourth floor, providing some in-place income as\nMavrek\nmaps out its overhaul.\nCalmwater Capital\n, the California-based lender that took control of the property through a deed in lieu of foreclosure nearly five years ago, sold the site. Greenstone Partners was hired to market the asset.\nThe transaction closes a long and winding chapter for a property that has repeatedly tempted developers aiming sky-high. Maple &amp; Ash co-owners David Pisor and Jim Lasky bought the site in 2017 for $13.1 million and pitched an ultra-luxury 22-story condominium tower with just 12 units. That plan stalled, as did a later proposal in 2022 for a 34-story condo tower by another development group.\nInstead of chasing entitlements for a vertical project, Mavrek is leaning into what the site already has: ground-level retail potential in one of Chicago\u2019s priciest and most pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods. The\nGold Coast\nremains a magnet for luxury brands, high-end dining and affluent shoppers, anchored by Oak Street boutiques like Herm\u00e8s, Dior and Chanel and restaurant heavyweights including Gibsons and Maple &amp; Ash next door.\n\u201cThere\u2019s very limited sites like this available that come around,\u201d Greenstone Partners CEO Danny Spitz said in a\nstatement\n. \u201cThe location sells itself.\u201d\nMavrek tapped Mid-America Real Estate Group to handle leasing, signaling a push to land top-tier retail and office tenants rather than speculative concepts.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The expansion of artificial intelligence wealth across the Bay Area is reshaping luxury residential markets throughout Northern and Central California, driving a surge in purchases from Napa to Carmel.\nBrokers said that many of these properties are not primary residences, but\nweekend retreats\n, long\u2011term investments or future retirement homes for tech professionals with growing liquidity, the San Francisco Business Times reported. Data confirmed the trend.\nIn the North Bay, there has been a strong influx of affluent buyers acquiring second, third and even fourth homes, Ohana Realty\u2019s Soren Olsen said. At Montage Residences Healdsburg, a project with 25 turnkey luxury homes, only one remains unsold, with roughly 30 percent of buyers coming from the Bay Area. Olsen attributed the demand to the spillover of new AI wealth from Silicon Valley and the East Bay into drive\u2011to destinations like wine country.\nSince September, luxury and ultraluxury home sales in Napa and Sonoma counties have risen 58 percent year\u2011over\u2011year, according to Compass analyst Patrick Carlisle. The region now has the highest number of $5 million\u2011plus homes in contract in at least two years. Napa and Sonoma also offer the widest selection of high\u2011end listings in the Bay Area, including 114 active listings above $5 million, 31 above $10 million, and eight above $20 million. A key differentiator for these markets is the amount of land that comes with the house.\n\u201cThe median lot size for homes listed in the two counties at $10 million-plus is well over 50 acres, while in the rest of the Bay Area, it is just a little above 1 acre,\u201d Carlisle told the San Francisco Business Times. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different style of living for the most affluent homebuyers.\u201d\nAgents across the region described a diverse mix of tech buyers.\nGrace Lucero of Vanguard Properties said she has seen weekend home seekers, early retirees and long\u2011term planners building multi\u2011lot compounds. Many are in their 30s and 40s, often paying all cash and leveraging stock wealth.\nTech buyers\n, especially those tied to AI, continue to favor\nNapa Valley\n, with some acquiring large tracts of land for future vineyard estates, Robyn Bentley of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate said. Several brokerages have expanded their wine country agent count, including\nChristie\u2019s Sereno\nand\nColdwell Banker\n.\nThe trend extends beyond wine country.\nMarin County\u2019s Stinson Beach is seeing increased AI\u2011driven demand, while Carmel and Pebble Beach are attracting Bay Area professionals seeking a two\u2011hour escape with natural beauty and hybrid\u2011work convenience. Monterey County\u2019s largest 2025 sale so far involved buyers from an AI infrastructure company, according to agent Simona Martin.\nFarther south, San Luis Obispo County is drawing younger tech buyers, many in their early 30s, purchasing second homes, Airbnbs and investment properties near Avila Beach, Pismo Beach and Paso Robles. Many have ties to Cal Poly.\nSome AI\u2011affluent buyers are even looking internationally. Compass agent Joske Thompson said he has seen growing interest in second homes in Panama and other countries, driven by asset diversification and favorable currency exchange rates.\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

The sale was recorded for $9 million, but the price was much higher, according to sources.\nPirez owns Mocca Group and Mocca Realty, and is active in Coral Gables. He declined to comment.\nThe $55 million price marks a record for the gated community, and is among the priciest, if not the most expensive, to close in Coral Gables.\nPirez, via 120 Leucadendra LLC, later bought a smaller waterfront home at 120 Leucadendra Drive, also in Gables Estates. Property records show residential broker Audrey Ross, who is licensed with\nCompass\n, sold the house. A price was not attached to the deed, and the MLS shows it sold for $7.8 million, but sources said it traded for $17 million.\nThe sale of 340 Leucadendra Drive surpasses The Weeknd\u2019s\n$50 million purchase\nof 41 Arvida Parkway in October.\nNearby, in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove, a company tied to billionaire businessman Jorge Mas recently sold the 7.3-acre residential lot next to the Kampong botanical garden to a hidden buyer for\nmore than $100 million\n.\u00a0This week,\nBanyan Ridge\n, a 4.5-acre waterfront compound at 3585 Anchorage Way that\u2019s also in Coconut Grove, traded for $101.5 million, according to the MLS.

        "content": "Investors have become major buyers of housing lots in the neighborhoods hardest hit by the January 2025 California wildfires, accounting for roughly 40 percent of all lots sold in the most affected ZIP codes.\nAn analysis of county records shows that in Pacific Palisades, investors purchased 48 of 119 lots, or 40.3 percent, sold in the third quarter of 2025 \u2014 compared with zero lot sales of any kind a year earlier,\nRedfin News reported\n. In Altadena, investors bought 27 of 61 lots (44.3 percent), also up from zero the prior year. And in Malibu, investors purchased 19 of 43 lots (44.2 percent), more than double their 21.4 percent share a year earlier.\nAround 80 percent of those lots previously had homes on them.\nThe surge in investor purchases comes as fire\u2011damaged neighborhoods face slow rebuilding timelines, insurance challenges and a glut of land listings. Redfin agents report that many\nAltadena\nresidents, especially elderly homeowners and those who were underinsured, are accepting low offers because they lack the financial means to rebuild. Many homes destroyed there dated to the 1940s and 1950s, and owners have waited nearly a year for permits. Some residents remain in nearby rentals; others have left the area entirely.\nPacific Palisades presents a stark contrast. With average household incomes near $400,000, many displaced homeowners have purchased temporary residences \u2014 often multimillion\u2011dollar homes in Santa Monica, Santa Barbara, Manhattan Beach, Orange County or San Diego \u2014 while planning high\u2011end rebuilds. One buyer purchased a $3.8 million Santa Monica home while preparing to rebuild with a prominent architect; another bought a $4.7 million Pacific Palisades home after losing a Malibu property.\nAcross the analyzed ZIP codes in the neighborhoods, listings far exceed sales. Lot listings have surged to 309 in Pacific Palisades, from seven a year earlier. In Altadena, 225 homes are listed for sale, up from two a year ago. And in Malibu, 214 properties are on the market compared to 125 a year ago.\nWith so much supply, sellers are cutting prices.\n\u201cMany of the lots that are selling in Altadena are in the $500,000- to $600,000-range\u201d said Redfin agent Sylva Khayalian. \u201cIf there was still a home on them, they might sell for $1 million or more.\u201d\nTypical lot sale prices were $510,000 in Altadena, $1.6 million in Pacific Palisades, and $1.3 million in Malibu.\nSingle\u2011family home sales remain depressed relative to pre\u2011fire levels, though they have rebounded from record lows immediately after the disaster. Pacific Palisades reported 31 home sales in the three months ending Nov. 30, down from 45 a year earlier, while Altadena saw 58 sales, down from 67. Lot sales now outnumber home sales in both areas, reversing historical patterns and prices that faced\ndownward pressure\n.\nIt\u2019s common for investors to buy homes after a\nnatural disaster\n, as Insurance costs and remediation burdens present major obstacles to rebuilding. Redfin agents note that some homeowners, overwhelmed by ash, smoke and lead\nremediation expenses\n, grimly joke that rebuilding is harder than losing the home outright.\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

In addition to Tesla, several other Elon Musk-associated firms have left the state, namely SpaceX and X.

They include high taxes, extensive regulation, elevated business costs, homelessness, public safety concerns, school system challenges, and political or social tensions.\nCalifornia\u2019s business climate rankings reinforce these concerns. The Tax Foundation places the state 49th in its Business Tax Climate Index, far behind states like Tennessee, Texas and Florida \u2014 destinations now attracting California companies.\nPopulation trends mirror the corporate shifts. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, California saw net emigration exceeding 200,000 people between 2024 and 2025. Fiscal pressures are mounting as well. The state faces a projected $50 billion to $70 billion deficit in 2025-2026, a stark reversal from the $97 billion surplus recorded in 2021-2022. The Reform California and Tax Foundation attributes the swing to California\u2019s reliance on income taxes from high earners and capital gains \u2014 revenues that decline when wealthy residents and major employers leave.\nLooking ahead, the state\u2019s new 2026 \u201cBillionaire Tax,\u201d which would require individuals classified as billionaires to pay 5 percent of their wealth annually, is expected by critics to accelerate the outflow of high\u2011net\u2011worth individuals and job\u2011creating companies.\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

The project also includes plans to develop a third structure on a 0.2-acre parcel at 151 East Travis Street. IBC\nbought the land\nlast year from Equity Secured Investments, which picked the parcel up at auction from Harris Bay who scrapped plans for a 121-room hotel.\nThe third building is set to include parking, a rooftop pool and other hotel amenities. Renderings depict a multi-level addition designed to support parking and guest amenities, adding variety to a property long dominated by office use. HKS Architects &amp; Designers and SWA Group are leading the design team. Dimension Hospitality, which manages the Embassy Suites by Hilton San Antonio Riverwalk Downtown, is attached as the hotel operator.\nIn a statement to city staff, the project team framed the development as a statement piece for the urban core. The proposed hotel would serve as a \u201ccultural and architectural anchor,\u201d the team wrote, tying together the historic 1926 Texas Theater fa\u00e7ade with the adaptive reuse of O\u2019Neil Ford\u2019s 1983 office building. The goal, according to the submission, is a hospitality destination that honors San Antonio\u2019s architectural heritage while leaning into the energy of the River Walk.\nThe move formalizes a pivot IBC has been signaling since a major office tenant walked away.\nVisionworks\nannounced in 2024 that it would vacate its large lease in the roughly 280,000-square-foot building, creating a hole that bank executives were reluctant to try to refill in a\nsoft downtown office market\n.\nIBC Bank Executive Vice President Bernardo De La Garza has previously stated that office tenants are still avoiding moves downtown. Newer buildings with deeper amenity packages, he added, have made it harder for older towers to compete.\nIBC told city officials it wants to begin construction in spring 2026, though the timeline still hinges on approvals. The proposal has been referred to the Historic and Design Review Commission, which will weigh in on the project\u2019s massing and treatment of nearby historic elements. A hearing date had not been set.\nIf approved, the\nJW Marriott\nwould add to downtown\u2019s hotel mix and highlight a broader trend playing out in Texas cities, where office owners are increasingly looking to hospitality and mixed-use conversions as a more viable path forward than trying to lease their way back to full occupancy.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Thanks, but no thanks.\nThat was the development team\u2019s response to the Adams administration\u2019s offer to build housing at another city-owned site if the developers dropped their lawsuit over their abandoned Elizabeth Street Garden project.\nThe administration\ndemanded\nlast week that Pennrose, Riseboro and Habitat for Humanity New York City and Westchester drop their legal fight over the garden project, known as Haven Green. In exchange, the city would designate the team as the developers of another city-owned site at 22 Suffolk Street.\nIn a Dec. 26 letter, First Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro gave the development team until Dec. 31 to abandon its\nlawsuit\n, which alleged that the administration did not have the legal authority to unilaterally declare Elizabeth Street Garden a city park.\nDevelopers shared a letter with\nThe Real Deal\nthat they sent to Mastro on Wednesday, stating that the offer provided in the \u201cwaning hours of the Adams Administration is not sufficient for us to abandon litigation that we believe is in the public interest.\u201d\nThe administration did not issue a request for proposals for the Suffolk Street site, intending to select the Haven Green developers using a \u201csole source\u201d method. City agencies typically bid out the opportunity to build on city-owned sites to determine the best team for the job. (The team led by Pennrose went through a public bidding process to win Haven Green.)\nWhen asked about the rejection, Mastro said, \u201cShame on them.\u201d\n\u201cYou can lead a horse to water but you can\u2019t make them drink,\u201d Mastro said in a statement. \u201cWe offered this group of affordable housing developers a chance to develop even more affordable housing at a neighboring site, but they turned it down because they would rather pursue a frivolous lawsuit over a site that has already been designated parkland and that they have no chance of reversing.\u201d\nThe developers want to try their luck in court and with the next mayor, and they believe a few factors are on their side.\nFor one, they argue that in order to turn Elizabeth Street Garden into an official park, such a land-use change would need to go through the city\u2019s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, or Ulurp. Another factor in their favor is that incoming Mayor Zohran Mamdani planned to evict the garden before Adams declared the site a city park.\n\u201cUltimately, the new administration should have the opportunity to determine whether to issue a designation letter [for Suffolk Street], how to address the legal issues surrounding the Elizabeth Street site, and how best to accomplish a feasible, sustainable, and trustworthy affordable housing plan for the city,\u201d the letter states.\nThe last-minute offer and rejection follow years\u2019 worth of controversy over the site. In 2017, the city awarded the developers the right to build 123 units of senior housing at the garden site. After several years of litigation, the city won the ability to move forward with its eviction of the nonprofit running the garden, but when Mastro joined this administration this year, he halted plans for the housing project.\nTo make up for\nabandoning\nHaven Green, Mastro said the city would pursue housing projects on three other sites: 22 Suffolk Street, 156-166 Bowery Street and 100 Gold Street. Mastro also received assurances from local Council member Chris Marte that he would support the rezonings necessary to build thousands of units across these sites.\nWhen Mamdani made clear that he would\nevict\nthe garden once in office, the Adams administration designated the city-owned site as parkland. Mamdani said at the time that undoing that action would prove nearly impossible because it would require buy-in from the state legislature.\nBut if a court decides that designation isn\u2019t valid, Mamdani\u2019s options may open up.\nThe developers also note in their letter that ballot measures approved in November weaken an individual Council member\u2019s ability to kill a rezoning that results in affordable housing.\n\u201cAlthough we hope the Council Member would support truly viable additional affordable housing sites regardless the outcome of the ongoing litigation, the reality is that the incoming administration does not need his approval to do so,\u201d the letter states. \u201cThus, by also maintaining the Elizabeth Street site, our lawsuit advances the cause of affordable housing.\u201d\nComplicating matters is the fact that the Adams administration also reached a licensing agreement with the nonprofit Elizabeth Street Garden to continue operating the park through the next 10 years, with the option of two five-year extensions. The nonprofit has also agreed to pay $100,000 it owes in back rent for the site, in 10 annual installments over the next decade.\nThe developers indicate in their letter that the licensing agreement reinforced their decision to stick with their lawsuit.\n",

The 34-year-old former Assembly member will be sworn in at midnight during a ceremony held in an out-of-service subway station under City Hall.\nTigani took over HPD in March, after stints as the first deputy commissioner and chief diversity officer of the department. His promotion came after Adams\ntapped the previous commissioner\n, Adolfo Carri\u00f3n, to step in as the deputy mayor of housing, economic development and workforce after Maria Torres-Springer resigned from the post amid the fallout from the Department of Justice\u2019s corruption charges against Adams.\nBefore joining HPD, Tigani served as the deputy commissioner of the Office of Neighborhood Strategies and the chief of staff to the Department of Buildings commissioner under former Mayor Bill De Blasio.\nIn a press release, Mamdani\u2019s team described Tigani\u2019s appointment as demonstrating the administration\u2019s \u201cfocus on experienced public servants with a proven track record of translating progressive vision into operational results.\u201d\nTigani in a statement described his vision for the agency as \u201ctransparent, efficient, and focused on serving New Yorkers.\u201d His appointment was announced alongside two others, including Louise Yeung as chief climate officer and Emmy Liss as executive director of the Office of Child Care.\nLast week, Mamdani\nappointed Leila Bozorg\nas the deputy mayor of housing and planning. Bozorg previously served in the Adams administration as the executive director of housing, a position he created two years ago. She was also a member of Adams\u2019 Charter Revision Commission, the group responsible for the four housing-related ballot measures that New Yorkers voted on last month.\nIn the press release, Bozorg, who worked with Tigani under the Adams administration, cast the incoming commissioner as a \u201cproven leader who has tackled the hardest housing problems head-on.\u201d\n",

        "content": "In his final day in office, Mayor Eric Adams handed a win to multifamily landlords and brokers.\nAdams on Wednesday vetoed the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act, or COPA, a measure\nderided\nby landlord groups as an unconstitutional intrusion into private deals. He also vetoed 18 other bills, including three that create new rules for city-financed housing.\nIn doing so, Adams both shot down a measure favored by the incoming mayor while also halting bills that the Mayor-elect\u2019s allies believe would hurt Zohran Mamdani\u2019s housing agenda.\nIt will be up to the next City Council and presumed Speaker Julie Menin to try to override these vetoes, though it\u2019s\nunclear\nif members will elect to do so. Most of the housing bills were passed by a supermajority of the Council, with the exception of COPA, which was approved with 30 votes. Notably, Menin was one of eight members who abstained from voting on COPA.\nIn a statement, Menin said the Council is considering its \u201cnext steps.\u201d\n\u201cRather than working collaboratively with the Council, the Adams administration has too often sidelined the legislative process,\u201d Menin said in a statement. \u201cFor years, agencies failed to provide basic data, commissioners skipped hearings, and meaningful negotiations were pushed to the last minute.\u201d\nCOPA would give city-approved nonprofits and joint ventures between nonprofits and for-profit companies the first opportunity to purchase certain multifamily buildings that are distressed or have a soon-to-expire affordability requirement. Landlord groups have said the measure will slow down sales and deter investment in the city.\nSoon after they were announced, real estate groups celebrated the vetoes. Real Estate Board of New York President Jim Whelan said the mayor\u2019s action \u201cprevented our housing supply crisis from worsening and the cost of housing from becoming even more unaffordable.\u201d Ann Korchak, of the Small Property Owners of New York, said that \u201csanity prevailed.\u201d\nMamdani, meanwhile, has\ncited\nCOPA as part of his strategy to take on bad landlords. Absent a veto override, the next Council could also work to pass another version of the bill with the new administration\u2019s support.\nThree of the other vetoed\nmeasures\nset new restrictions on the kinds of housing that the city finances, creating minimums for the percentage of units with two- and three-bedrooms, those affordable to New York\u2019s poorest and those designated as homeownership units.\nThough the administration\nvoiced concern\nabout the cost of another bill that creates a minimum wage for construction workers on certain housing projects, the mayor did not veto that measure. Under the Construction Justice Act, construction workers must be paid $40 per hour in wages and benefits on housing projects with 150 units or more that have construction costs of $3 million or more and receive $1.5 million or more in city financing.\nHousing groups warned that the measures threatened Mamdani\u2019s plan to build 200,000 new affordable housing units over the next decade.\u00a0The administration estimated that these bills would add $600 million to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development\u2019s annual budget needs. Most of that added cost, $425 million, was attributed to the Construction Justice Act.\nA spokesperson for City Hall could not provide an explanation for the mayor\u2019s decision not to veto the construction wage bill, given the administration\u2019s own calculations.\nIn a statement, Adams called the Council\u2019s legislation \u201creckless,\u201d and said that the vetoed housing measures would \u201cworsen our affordable housing crisis with new, unfunded mandates and red tape.\u201d\nAdams also vetoed a measure that would have set\nminimum wages\nfor building security guards and another that would allow the city to sell tax liens to a land bank, rather than a private trust. REBNY raised concerns about the legality of the city setting wages for these guards, which appears to be part of the impetus for the mayor\u2019s veto.\nHe additionally axed a bill that would have set\ntime limits\nfor co-op boards to respond to prospective residents about applications to live in a building and for accepting or rejecting them. This bill, as well as the land bank and security guard measures, passed the City Council with a supermajority of support.\nCOPA has percolated for several years but only gained momentum in the passed few months. It was first introduced in 2020 and has since undergone several changes that reduced the pool of eligible buildings and shrunk the period of time that nonprofits and eligible joint ventures can exclusively vie for properties.\nThe law would have required owners looking to sell certain multifamily buildings with four or more units to first notify the city and its list of approved prospective buyers.\nThose would-be buyers would then have 25 days to notify an owner that they are interested in bidding on a property. Once that time runs out, the interested qualified entities have 80 days to submit an offer. Qualified entities also have 15 days after a competing bid comes in to match it.\nThe vetoes top off what became an acrimonious relationship between the mayor and Speaker Adrienne Adams, especially over the last two years. The housing bills,\npassed\nat the City Council\u2019s final meeting this year, came after the Council unsuccessfully fought against three ballot measures approved in November. City Council leadership called the\nmeasures\n, which\u00a0 weakened the Council\u2019s sway over land use decisions, an unlawful power grab by the administration.\n\u201cThrough their actions, the Council continues to demonstrate the importance of our administration\u2019s proposals to streamline the city\u2019s housing approval process, which the Council fiercely opposed but voters overwhelmingly approved in November,\u201d the mayor said in a statement.\nIn a parting shot, Adrienne Adams said it was \u201cunsurprising that this mayor is ending his term by demonstrating, once again, that protecting and supporting working-class New Yorkers is not his priority.\u201d She said the \u201cvetoes put special interests above greater affordability and opportunity for hardworking New Yorkers.\u201d\n",

Pacific Urban had acquired it three years earlier for $50.7 million. Pacific Urban, a Palo Alto-based multifamily owner and investment manager, has been active in the market, recently selling an apartment complex in Fremont to\nBenedict Canyon Equities\nfor about $50 million.

Belveron Partners is an investment firm specializing in affordable housing ownership, while Las Palmas Housing is a nonprofit public benefit corporation involved in affordable housing development and social service programs. Neither organization commented to the Business Journal.\nThe sale price equates to roughly $453,000 per unit, slightly below Santa Clara County\u2019s five\u2011year average of about $458,000 per unit for multifamily properties with more than 100 units, based on CBRE\u2019s analysis of MSCI Real Capital Analytics. Built 55 years ago, Montecito Apartments includes amenities such as a pool and fitness center.\nThe transaction fits with Las Palmas\u2019 mission of \u201cacquiring, developing, rehabilitating and supporting affordable housing,\u201d according to its website. The Encinitas-based organization has development partners that include Amcal Housing, Related Companies and Aimco Capital Development.\nEarlier in 2025\n, Las Palmas and a partner paid $52 million, or $317,000 per unit, for apartments in San Jose.\nThe organization, which has 71 affordable housing projects with more than 6,500 units, is run by President Joseph Michaels.\nSan Francisco-based Belveron Partners runs funds for investors\ninterested in multifamily\n. It has acquired nearly 30,000 units in 14 states. Since 2006, it has raised more than $1.2 billion in equity financing for affordable projects.

The new design is significantly taller and denser than earlier proposals dating back a decade, when the site operated as a Honda dealership.\nCrescent Heights, which also built the nearby NEMA apartment tower, has taken steps to meet its affordability obligations by purchasing and donating a Mission District parcel next to the 16th Street BART Station for future affordable housing. That site had previously been the focus of\nintense opposition\nto a market\u2011rate project known as the \u201cMonster in the Mission.\u201d After it switched to affordable housing, San Francisco gave $60 million to\nthe project\n.\nIf completed, 10 South Van Ness would trail only Salesforce Tower and the Transamerica Pyramid in height, though other proposed towers \u2014 including Hines\u2019 77 Beale Street redevelopment and the stalled Oceanwide Center \u2014 could eventually surpass it. Construction could begin as early as 2027.\nMiami-based Crescent Heights, led by CEO Russell Galbut, has extensive experience in market-rate multifamily development in\nLos Angeles\n,\nChicago\nand its home market. Projects vary from conversions and redevelopments to ground-up buildings.The company owns 93 properties, according to its website.\n\u2014\nJoel Russell\n",

So much development is either high-end or income-restricted that the in-between homes are essentially missing.\nThe Chraibi brothers, as\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s\nLidia Dinkova\ndetailed in an\ninteresting profile\n, realized that if you build what\u2019s missing, it sells. Their buyers are Americans who make too much money to qualify for affordable housing but too little to get a mortgage for a luxury home.\nBuyers might also just not be inclined to buy more house than they need. These are my kind of people \u2014 practical, not\nextravagant\n, and focused on financial security rather than on keeping up with the Joneses.\nTo them, an oversized house means having rooms that you never use but still need to clean, heat and cool. An oversized lawn just means more mowing and higher property taxes.\nI recently visited relatives in Seattle \u2014 empty nesters \u2014 who had closed off half of their house rather than heat it. I also visited relatives in Los Angeles whose formal living room is sealed off like a crime scene, and filled to the brim with stuff that they will never use again.\nThe Chraibis\u2019 homes don\u2019t have redundant spaces like a living room and a family room on the same floor. But they sell faster than houses that do.\nThe profit margin on each home is lower, but the brothers make up for that with volume and quick sales. Their challenge is that south Miami-Dade, like much of America, is typically zoned for single-family homes on large lots. That inflates the cost of each lot and makes a starter home unprofitable to build.\nTo overcome this, the brothers ask localities to rezone their sites to allow more dwellings and more types of housing. For one development, instead of 30 so-called McMansions they are building 57 townhomes.\nThe risk is that the locality will cave to pressure from NIMBY neighbors and not rezone.\n\u201cYou build townhomes [nearby and] they are mad,\u201d Salim Chraibi told\nTRD\n. \u201cPeople think of workforce housing as, \u2018Oh, these people are going to come and they are going to destroy my neighborhood.\u2019 No, these are teachers, teaching your kids at school, these are people who show up at your door when you call 911.\u201d\nPlenty of home shoppers are interested in this kind of housing in New York City, which loses a lot of these folks to the suburbs. Homes for them don\u2019t get built because it\u2019s more profitable to build luxury housing in rich neighborhoods, affordable housing in poor ones, and 421a/485x housing everywhere else.\nThe market-rate units in 421a and 485x developments must have high enough rents to subsidize the affordable units required by these tax abatement programs. The result is a barbell-style rent structure \u2014 high-priced units, low-priced units and nothing in between.\nThe \u201cmissing middle\u201d is inherent in the politics-driven design of 485x, even more so than it was with predecessor 421a. Progressives required lower-rent units and construction unions demanded higher wages.\nThe gap between each end of the barbell can get even wider if rezoning is involved because it triggers Mandatory Inclusionary Housing and the local City Council member often demands even cheaper rents for the affordable units.\nOne exception was 970 Franklin Avenue in Brooklyn, which Bruce Eichner got the City Council to\nrezone\nafter a seven-year struggle. The key was unions\u2019 testimony that for the project to get financing (from their pension funds), the lower-rent units had to be workforce housing rather than deeply affordable.\nSouth Miami-Dade is very different from New York City, but both markets have a missing middle \u2014 and developers like the Chraibi brothers willing to fill it. New York state and city lawmakers must figure out why 485x, Mandatory Inclusionary Housing and current zoning are making that all but impossible.\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s fitting that Mayor Eric Adams is going out with a fiasco \u2014 one final harebrained scheme that blows up in his face.\nHis top aide, Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro, was supposed to prevent foolishness like the\nElizabeth Street Garden drama\nthat marred Adams\u2019 last day in office. Instead Mastro orchestrated it.\nRemember when the City Council refused to confirm Mastro as corporation counsel because he was too conservative? Adams\u2019 argument was that he was competent. Guess not!\nTwo days ago Adams and Mastro publicly\nannounced\nthat Pennrose would be designated as the developer of a city project at 22 Suffolk Street. Then the press release noted that Pennrose had not actually agreed to that.\nI started covering city government in 1992. Never have I seen the city announce a deal before it was reached.\nPennrose had two days to agree to the city\u2019s offer. In exchange, the developer would have to drop its\nlawsuit\nagainst the city for designating the Elizabeth Street Garden as parkland, blocking Pennrose\u2019s project to build affordable housing for seniors there.\nI doubt I can fit all the ways that Adams and Mastro screwed this up into a column. Here\u2019s the Cliff Notes version:\nAdams was gung-ho to evict the statue garden and let Pennrose build the housing, preserving some open space for the community. His lawyers won the court case, ending a 10-year battle with statue guy Allan Reiver, his son Joseph Reiver and privileged Nolita residents who opposed the project.\nThen Adams appointed Mastro and suddenly everything changed. The city\nreversed its position\n, siding with the Reivers and against Pennrose. It was the political equivalent of Aaron Judge switching from the Yankees to the Mets in the middle of a World Series between them.\nMastro then cut a deal with the local Council member, real estate hater\nChris Marte\n, who promised to approve three future housing projects if the statue garden could stay. Mastro continues to insist that without Marte\u2019s approval, that housing cannot be built. That is false.\nIn November, voters\napproved City Charter revisions\nthat remove much of Marte\u2019s leverage to stop projects. The incoming mayor, Zohran Mamdani, should be able to get the affordable housing done without Marte\u2019s cooperation.\nWhen Mamdani won the election and promised to revive the housing plan, Adams and Mastro had to act before Mamdani shuts the City Hall doors behind them and changes the locks. Their brilliant idea was to designate the site as parkland so housing couldn\u2019t be built there.\nPennrose sued, saying the city didn\u2019t follow any process in designating the land. That\u2019s the lawsuit that Adams and Mastro wanted the developer (which was partnering on the project with RiseBoro Community Partnership and Habitat for Humanity) to drop.\nNo way were Pennrose, RiseBoro and Habitat going to do that. They\u2019ll likely win the lawsuit, and if not, Mamdani can get Albany to reverse the parkland designation.\nBesides, had they accepted Adams\u2019 offer, there\u2019s no guarantee it would have held up with Adams and Mastro out of power. And the developers would have had to start from scratch on the Suffolk Street site, wasting 10 years\u2019 of effort on Elizabeth Street.\nThe kicker in the city\u2019s press release Monday was that the statue garden, which was to receive a 10-year lease, is behind on its rent for the city-owned site. It owes $10,000.\nRewarding a deadbeat tenant is bad optics. But optics went out the window long ago on Elizabeth Street \u2014 and the Adams administration.\n",

        "content": "For months, real estate professionals have\nspeculated\nabout what Mayor Zohran Mamdani will mean for the industry.\nNow, these conversations aren\u2019t hypothetical.\nMamdani was sworn in as the new mayor of New York City during a midnight ceremony Thursday by state Attorney General Letitia James. A separate public swearing-in ceremony will be held on the steps of City Hall on Thursday afternoon. Sen. Bernie Sanders will deliver the oath of office at that event.\nTop of mind for owners of rent-stabilized housing is Mamdani\u2019s campaign promise to freeze rents for regulated tenants for four years. The city\u2019s Rent Guidelines Board decides how much landlords can increase rents on one- and two-year leases on rent-stabilized apartments, though mayors have\ninfluenced\nthe board\u2019s decisions.\nMamdani\u2019s pledge was\ncomplicated\nby Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 last-minute appointments, though one appointee decided against serving on the board.\nHe has also, however, acknowledged that a rent freeze alone cannot solve the city\u2019s housing crisis. He also wants to change the city\u2019s property tax system and work with the state to find alternative insurance options to help owners reduce costs.\nMamdani has shown support for a lawsuit challenging the city\u2019s property tax regime, and his administration could make changes that are being\npushed\nby Tax Equity Now New York, the industry-backed group that filed the lawsuit. Still, broader changes, including the designation of condos and co-ops that determines how they are assessed, would require state intervention.\nHe also wants the state to raise corporate and income taxes to help pay for his policy priorities, both of which have faced opposition from the business community.\nMamdani has also vowed to crack down on bad landlords and to revamp the city\u2019s Office to Protect Tenants, which was launched under Mayor Bill de Blasio but has\nlanguished\nover the past few years. Mamdani wants the office to identify distressed multifamily buildings with unpaid fines or unaddressed dangerous conditions and\nfind ways\nfor the city to take control of these buildings, either through foreclosing on the properties or cutting deals with the owners.\nThough many in the industry supported former Gov. Andrew Cuomo ahead of the June primary, some were heartened by Mamdani\u2019s recognition of the private sector\u2019s role in addressing the housing crisis.\nAfter Mamdani\u2019s win in November, David Kramer, president of Hudson Companies, told\nThe Real Deal\nthat when he and other affordable housing developers met with Mamdani, the mayoral hopeful assured them that he wasn\u2019t running to punish landlords.\n\u201cIn our conversations with him, he struck me as somebody that was going to be practical,\u201d Kramer said at the time.\nThe new mayor has said that he wants to build 200,000 units of new affordable housing over the next decade. Some were concerned that last-minute action by the City Council would hurt his ability to execute that plan. Specifically, housing groups worried that a package of bills that set new requirements for the kinds of housing the city finances would add hundreds of millions of dollars to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development\u2019s budget needs.\nBut in his final hours as mayor, Eric Adams vetoed those measures as well as the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act, or COPA. It\u2019s unclear whether the next City Council speaker will try to override the vetoes on these measures. Mamdani has been supportive of COPA, so he could also encourage the City Council to approve a new version of the policy instead.\nThe new administration is also tasked with implementing the housing ballot measures approved in November that create new pathways for housing projects to be approved. The changes allow certain projects to avoid City Council approval and for an appeals board to reverse the Council\u2019s rejection of others. Adams has\nleft behind\nother initiatives for Mamdani to potentially pick up, including the\nso-called Manhattan Plan\n, which recommends different ways of ramping up construction in the borough.\nMamdani is still filling out his administration, but has\nappointed\nAdams administration alum Leila Bozorg as his deputy mayor of housing and planning. He also named Ahmed Tigani, who has served as acting HPD commissioner under Adams, as his Department of Buildings commissioner. He has not yet announced who will lead HPD or the Department of City Planning.\nIn the coming months, the new mayor\u2019s policy priorities will become clearer, as will his ability to deliver on campaign promises as he navigates working with the City Council and state legislature.\n",

        "content": "One benefit of being a reporter is having access to the press offices at otherwise impenetrable government agencies.\nYou might wonder, \u201cShouldn\u2019t I as a building owner have at least as much access as the media does?\u201d In a perfect world, yes, but \u2014 reality check \u2014 you don\u2019t.\nThere is some logic to this. The press office can share information with a reporter who in turn shares it with thousands of customers, as I am about to do on a law affecting multifamily buildings.\nThe Department of Buildings has one of the most responsive press offices in city government. So when I got a curious letter from JTG Master Plumbing about new fees for gas inspections, I checked it out with DOB.\nLocal Law 152, enacted in 2016, requires an inspection of gas piping in\nmost multifamily buildings\nevery four years by a city-licensed master plumber (or a qualified person working for one).\nInspections began in 2020 and the second round is underway. Plumbers have generally charged $600 per inspection, but at least there was no DOB filing fee.\nSoon, however, there will be, the letter from JTG warned.\nBut I was skeptical of its claim that \u201cafter Feb. 22, 2026, filing fees of\nup to $480\nwill apply for extensions, corrections, and no gas filings. This will slow down scheduling &amp; increase costs for everyone.\u201d\nThen came the pitch: \u201cAvoid these new costs by completing your inspection before the rule change takes effect in February. We recommend that you complete your inspection and filing before the Dec. 31 due date to prevent fees and penalties.\u201d\nFrom the letter, I couldn\u2019t tell what the fee for my building would be and whether the deadline to avoid it is Feb. 22 or Dec. 31.\nI wrote to JPG, which replied, but I was still confused. So I emailed the DOB press office. Here are the facts:\nNew rules\nfor Local Law 152 took effect Jan. 3, 2026. Fourteen people commented at the October hearing for the proposed rules \u2014 hats off to these folks! \u2014 but DOB didn\u2019t make any changes.\nThe new fee for certification of the gas piping inspection will be $35. Requesting an extension or submitting a corrected filing will also set you back $35.\nWhat about the February deadline? There is none. DOB will start collecting fees this summer, probably after posting a service notice\nhere\n.\nAnd the $480 filing fee that JPG put in\nboldface and italics\nbut failed to explain? That\u2019s for buildings without active gas service but with gas piping that could be used in the future. Not too many of those.\nIf your property was built\nall-electric\n, congratulations \u2026 but you\u2019re not off the hook. Local Law 152 still obliges you to certify that your building has no gas piping.\nA\nstory in The Real Deal\nabout your all-electric coolness does not suffice. You still need to hire a master plumber and pay $375 for the filing fee. The good news is that you only have to do it once.\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s restrictive lending environment is finally starting to ease up.\nA look at Cook County\u2019s biggest commercial loans in 2025 shows mega-lenders moving away from their\npandemic-era reliance on the industrial sector\nand embracing a variety of property types, according to data compiled by\nThe Real Deal.\nAfter interest rates began to rise in 2022, lenders tightened their pursestrings and Chicago felt the pain acutely. While many cities saw financing slow down, Chicago also dealt with negative perceptions from lenders tied to its\nunpredictable property tax environment\nand\nprogressive city council\n.\nBut constraints on developers put pressure on Chicago\u2019s existing multifamily supply, driving rents\nup more rapidly than the rest of the country\n. As a result,\nthe multifamily market heated up this year\nand buyers and owners started to score appealing debt packages from lenders.\nMeanwhile, top-tier office developments reaped the benefits of forging ahead during the coronavirus crisis. The city\u2019s top two commercial loans of the year were both office loans that came in over $600 million and were sold off on the bond market.\nThe top contenders in 2025\ncontrast last year\u2019s biggest commercial loans\ngetting bolstered by data center developments, with the priciest debt package below $300 million. Though data center and industrial projects still secured financing in Cook County this year, the heftiest deals were part of larger portfolios that spanned the country.\nBank of America tower | $700 million\nWhile many of Chicago\u2019s office landlords were fighting for survival, the owners of the Bank of America Tower bucked trends and scored a\n$700 million refinancing\nin November.\nThe refinancing was led by JPMorgan Chase and also included debt from Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and BMO, according to a statement from the borrowers. It was then repackaged and sold off on the bond market.\nThe transaction stands out in a city where few investors have been willing to touch office paper.\nThe tower\u2019s owners are a joint venture of Oak Hill Advisors, Callahan Capital Partners and Affinius Capital. The move marks the largest office-backed bond offering in Chicago since the pandemic, a sign that commercial mortgage-backed securities buyers will still write checks for top-tier assets.\nThe 57-story building at 110 North Wacker Drive is 98 percent leased, with Bank of America anchoring 17 floors and contributing roughly a third of total rent, according to bond documents.\nIts riverfront site and proximity to Union Station and Ogilvie Transportation Center have kept it competitive, and its slate of amenities \u2014 including restaurants from celebrity chefs such as Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s \u2014 gives it the kind of hospitality edge landlords now need to draw tenants.\nThe refinancing replaces a loan held by a group of banks and landed at a moment when a small drop in interest rates started to thaw capital markets.\nSalesforce Tower | $610 million\nThe owners of Salesforce Tower on the bank of the Chicago River secured a\n$610 million long-term debt deal\nin March, marking a milestone in the aftermath of Chicago\u2019s pandemic-stricken economy.\nThe property was developed by a political powerhouse\u2019s family office in the Kennedys, as well as Hines and the AFL-CIO\u2019s real estate investment arm. It stands as a contrarian bet that worked out amid economic uncertainty.\nThe refinancing package, with Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs serving as the lenders, replaced the property\u2019s $549 million construction debt and is projected to carry an interest rate of 6.525 percent until its maturity in March 2030.\nConceived during the early days of the pandemic, Salesforce Tower has upended market trends by maintaining high occupancy levels, with leases covering over 95 percent of its 1.2 million square feet. Key tenants include Salesforce, which rents more than 477,000 square feet, and Kirkland &amp; Ellis, which is on a 677,000-square-foot lease; those deals run into the 2040s.\nKirkland has poured over $207 million beyond its tenant-improvement allowance to create its ideal workspaces, while Salesforce has put up an additional $78 million for its interior buildout, the Moody\u2019s report on the new loan showed.\n167 North Green | $247 million\nA venture of Shapack Partners, Tim Anderson\u2019s Focus Development and Neil Bluhm\u2019s Walton Street Capital secured\na $247 million refinancing\nfor the largest office building in Fulton Market, in another win for downtown office owners.\nThe venture closed in July on a five-year, interest-only loan backed by 167 North Green Street, according to a presale report from ratings agency KBRA.\nThe deal paid off a $232 million Deutsche Bank loan from 2021, giving the group breathing room until interest rates settle and the office market stabilizes. The refinancing amounts to $387 per square foot.\nThe 17-story, 638,800-square-foot building was nearly 92 percent leased at the time of the refinancing compared to 73 percent for downtown Chicago overall. It was appraised at $370 million, or $570 per square foot, this year according to KBRA.\nTenants include CCC Intelligent Solutions, which leases more than 140,000 square feet through 2037. MoLo Solutions signed for roughly 94,000 square feet through 2034 but has marketed some space for sublease. WeWork still occupies over 93,000 square feet, keeping its lease intact after filing for bankruptcy in 2023. Virginia-based consulting firm Guidehouse subleased nearly 47,000 square feet in the building from Kroll in February.\nThe Row | $212 million\nA luxury high-rise in Fulton Market developed by Related Midwest nabbed a $212 million refinancing from Mizuho Financial Group two years after opening. The refinancing signaled the strength of both the Fulton Market neighborhood and Chicago\u2019s multifamily market in general.\nRelated built The Row at 164 North Peoria Street with a $164 million construction loan issued by the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio. Additional expenses likely added to the total development cost.\nThe 43-story, 300-unit tower opened in 2023 and features a rooftop pool, coworking space and other luxury amenities. About 20 percent of the units in the building were set aside as affordable to comply with the city\u2019s affordable housing requirements.\nMarket rate rents range from $4,000 per month to upwards of $10,000 per month for penthouse-style residences.\nMarshall Field Garden Apartments | $192 million\nA historic affordable housing complex secured a $192 million refinancing deal in May, indicating its value has grown since owner Related Midwest took over in 2016.\nThe Marshall Field Garden Apartments, which consist of a sprawling complex of 10 buildings totaling 628 units, were originally built by the estate of department store magnate Marshall Fields in 1929.\nThe estate\u2019s goal was to maintain the property as affordable housing. Since then, the Old Town property has cycled through two private owners, both of which agreed to maintaining below-market rents.\nRelated Midwest bought The Marshall Field Garden Apartments in 2016 with an agreement to maintain their affordability until 2045. The company spent $175 million on upgrades to the property and most recently refinanced it with Chicago\u2019s fifth-biggest loan of 2025.\nThe Renaissance Chicago Hotel | $165 million\nThe only hotel to make Chicago\u2019s list of top commercial loans in 2025, The Renaissance Chicago Downtown received a $165 million refinancing from Citibank.\nThe riverfront hotel at 1 West Wacker Drive underwent extensive renovations in 2013.\nCarey Watermark Investors Inc. bought the 553-room hotel for $139 million and planned to pour $27 million into rehabbing it. Since then, the hospitality industry took a hit during the pandemic, hampering many investors\u2019 abilities to sell or secure financing.\nBut this year, the Democratic National Convention, and other marquee events like the Lollapalooza music festival and NASCAR race, drove record demand for downtown hotel rooms.\nThe city\u2019s overall hotel revenue generated in June, July and August totaled nearly $950 million and set a record for the central business district.\nGrand Plaza | $160 million\nMorgan Stanley originated\na $160 million loan\nfor the 481-unit apartment tower called Grand Plaza, at 540 North State Street in March. The property is owned by an LLC led by New York-based investor Teresa Tsai and several other investors.\nEven after scoring the loan, however, Tsai faced a $16 million shortfall from the property\u2019s previous debt, a $186 million mortgage taken out in 2014, property records show. It\u2019s unclear how Tsai closed the gap \u2014 she could have paid out of pocket or raised the money from another investor in exchange for a piece of the property\u2019s equity.\nRegardless, landing a CMBS deal on relatively favorable terms was a strong sign for Chicago\u2019s apartment market.\nThe new Grand Plaza loan, $93 million of which was set to be sold in a CMBS package, marked the largest deal in the offering, which totals more than $934 million across 40 loans, according to KBRA.\nGrand Plaza was appraised at $241 million during the loan underwriting process. The debt comes with a five-year term and requires only the interest to be paid until its maturity, when the principal becomes fully due, according to a KBRA analysis. The estimated property value was down nearly 20 percent from its 2014 appraisal of $300 million.\nThe Tsai venture bought the property \u2014 along with a huge parking garage and 100,000-square-foot retail assets connected to the complex \u2014 for $265 million in 2007. It then refinanced with the $186 million loan in 2014, but appeared to only use the apartment tower as collateral, allowing the retail and parking assets to operate debt-free, property records show.\nIn the first nine months of 2024, Grand Plaza brought in $19 million in revenue and $9.2 million in net cash flow, after accounting for its operating expenses, according to loan data compiled by Morningstar Credit.\n370 North Morgan | $151 million\nVista Properties scored $173 million in financing to begin construction work on an apartment tower in Fulton Market in May.\nThe funds come from\na $151 million construction loan from CIBC\nand a $22 million preferred equity investment from PGIM Real Estate. The financing equates to $350,000 per unit. Cushman &amp; Wakefield represented Vista in securing the CIBC loan.\nThe 31-story tower will include 494 units and over 45,000 square feet of amenities. It is replacing the former Fox Deluxe Foods building at 370 North Morgan Street and is expected to be completed in the Spring of 2027.\nChicago-based Skender is the general contractor, and Antunovich Associates designed the building. DeSimone is the structural engineer.\n1475 North Kingsbury Street | $135 million\nThe team behind a Lincoln Park apartment high-rise\nsecured a $135 million refinancing from Rialto Capital Advisors\nin June.\nA joint venture made up of Cleveland-based PCP Generational Partners, Chicago-based Structured Development and White Oak Realty Partners finished construction on the 327-unit development at 1475 North Kingsbury Street in late 2023. The refinancing worked out to $412,000 per unit.\nThe ownership venture took out a $89 million construction loan to fund the 27-story project in 2022. It was the last multifamily tower to be completed as a part of a broader, $250 million mixed-used development called Wendelin Park, previously known as The Shops At Big Deahl.\nThe development is bordered by Kingsbury Street to the west and Dayton Street to the east, and bound by Blackhawk Street to the north and Eastman Street to the south.\nOther buildings included in the project are The Seng, a 34-unit affordable condo development and Post Chicago, a 126-unit apartment building. At The Post, 107 units are co-living spaces, and the remaining 19 units are standard apartments. The properties surround a park that was built by the developers but is open to the public. On the east end of the development, the venture built a climbing gym known as Movement Lincoln Park.\nThe Residences at Arlington Heights | $134 million\nIn an early sign that Chicago\u2019s multifamily market was going to have\na strong showing for the year\n, the owners of The Residences at Arlington Heights secured a $134 million refinancing in February.\nLos Angeles-based JRK Property Holdings bought the massive 838-unit suburban complex formerly known as The Tanglewood Apartments in 2014 for $78 million with a $65 million loan from Walker &amp; Dunlop.\nThe Residences at Arlington have gotten more than $20 million in renovations under JRK Property\u2019s ownership.\nNot long after the refinancing, JRK listed the property for sale. At the time the listing went public in July, the complex was fully leased. Marketing materials listed an average monthly rent of about $1,500, or $2 per square foot.",

        "content": "It may be one of the country\u2019s most sprawling metros, but Houston has a surprisingly\nnarrow\nluxury market for single-family homes.\nNine of the 10 most expensive homes sold in Harris County this year are strung along the Buffalo Bayou, and five of these are within one square mile of each other in the\nRiver Oaks\nneighborhood. Contrast Travis County, home to the denser, more constricted city of\nAustin\n, where the top 10 deals fan out westward from downtown as far as Bee Cave and Horseshoe Bend, which are up to 20 miles away.\nDallas-Fort Worth\nrivals Space City in geographic grouping \u2014\u00a0 none of the top 10 homes sold this year in the Metroplex is more than a mile and a half from the Dallas North Tollway \u2014 but Houston may be home to the clubbiest luxury resi market.\nIn Houston, the buyers and sellers of the top 10 deals shared 10 agents over just five brokerages. Austin and Dallas were far more diverse, with 18 different agents apiece represented in the top 10 deals for each city.\nThe home that topped the list reflects a trend that became more pronounced in Houston this year: As the wobbliness of the resi market finally infected the luxury set, some pockets were immune, including\nhistoric homes\n. The most expensive home sold in Houston in 2025 was built in 1938 by legendary Houston architect John Staub. Of the top ten, three were built in the last two years.\nHere are the top 10 residential sales of the year in Harris County, based on TRD Data and Redfin. Since Texas is a non-disclosure state, the final sales prices aren\u2019t public; the list is sorted by last listing price.\n2110 River Oaks Boulevard, Houston | $19 million\nThis gated estate, which is one of the 31 River Oaks homes Staub designed between 1924 and 1958, sold in the hot season when it was asking $18.9 million, about $2,000 per square foot. The 9,400-square-foot main house, remodeled in 2000, shares 1.6 acres with a guest apartment and an entertainment pavilion built in 2012. The estate of Larry Brookshire, former owner of Fisk Electric, sold the property to philanthropists Martha Long and Sean Wade. Compass Real Estate agents Dee Dee Guggenheim Howes and Laura Sweeney, two of the city\u2019s top producers, represented the seller and buyer, respectively.\n2307 River Oaks Boulevard, Houston | $16 million\nDown the street is the silver medal sale,\nanother River Oaks historic mansion\n. Steel industry mogul Daniel Benditz sold the 11,200-square-foot home built in 1952 to a trust in November. The six-bedroom, 10-bathroom home was last listed for $16 million, or about $1,400 per square foot. Compass\u2019 Sweeney represented both parties in the transaction.\n3996 Inverness Drive, Houston | $14 million\nInverness Drive fielded two of the year\u2019s top sales in May\n, and Nan &amp; Co founder Nancy Almodovar represented both listings. The first was a Tudoresque mansion at 3996 Inverness, which was listed for just under $14 million, or about $843 per square foot, when it sold. The six-bedroom, nine-bathroom home built in 2011 is the largest on the list, with more than 16,600 square feet. The property had previously been listed for $17.9 million in 2024.\n1 Longfellow Lane, Houston | $10.6 million\nAn outlier among the top 10 homes\n, the five-bedroom, five-bathroom, 9,800-square-foot property at 1 Longfellow Lane is the only one south of I-69. The sellers, Kenneth and Cara Moczulski, were recognized by Preservation Houston in 2021 for restoring the home built in 1926, designed by Rice University architect and professor William Ward Watkin. Rancher and political donor Ashley Watt bought the property. The Moczulskis originally listed the home at $11.8 million in April 2023. Martha Turner Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent Victoria Minton had the listing, and Guggenheim Howes represented the buyer.\n11264 Memorial Drive, Houston | $10 million\nThis Piney Point spec mansion was built in 2024 by the seller, an entity managed by Ghandi Saad. Guggenheim Howes and fellow Compass agent Nasseim Saad shared the listing, and Guggenheim Howes also represented the buyers, Dani Bidros and Shaghayegh Nikkhah. The six-bedroom, nine-bathroom home sold on June 30 when it was listed for $10 million, which comes out to about $815 per square foot for the 12,200-square-foot property.\n813 W Friar Tuck Lane, Houston | $10 million\nLocal custom builder Rob Ryan completed this home \u2014 that required the teardown of a home built in 1950 \u2014 in July and sold it to Robert Micah McDonald in September, according to public records. The 9,000-square-foot home is on a 1.7-acre lot on Friar Tuck Lane, a Memorial neighborhood street which\nfrequently\nappears\nin coverage of Houston\u2019s most expensive homes. The asking price amounts to about $1,100 per square foot. Sweeney represented both the buyer and the seller.\n11321 Green Vale Drive, Houston | $9.8 million\nAnother spec mansion, the five-bedroom, six-bathroom home at 11321 Green Vale Drive was built by Thompson Custom Homes in 2024 and sold to Wilber and Judy Baker in February. At the time of the sale, the home was listed for $9.8 million, or about $900 per square foot for the 10,799-square-foot home.\n4004 Inverness Drive, Houston | $8.85 million\nHouston architect Charles Tapley designed the 1974 home at 4004 Inverness Drive, down the street from the third-most expensive home on the list. Jacquelyn Fisher, owner of Houston-based moving company 3 Men Movers, sold the property to Jentry Kelley and Kenneth Shawn Lynch in May. At the time of the sale, the seller asked $1,180 per square foot.\n19 West Lane, Houston | $8.5 million\nOn a 0.9-acre lot, this five-bedroom, seven-bathroom, 10,800-square-foot home, built in 2000, was listed at $8.5 million when it sold, or about $785 per square foot. Yun Bo Li sold the property to Thomas and Barbara Skeuse in March, according to public records. Compass agent Mike Mahlstedt had the listing.\n302 Timberwilde Lane, Houston | $8.25 million\nThe mid-century home at 302 Timberwilde Lane may just survive after being purchased by Kelly Barnhart, a local restaurateur with a background in art history. The house built in 1956 was marketed as a teardown opportunity, with William Wheless of Wheless Realty calling the 2.73-acre property \u201cone of the last remaining building sites\u201d on Timberwilde, a street whose other properties include the home at\n412 Timberwilde\n, listed for $12.25 million, and the\nLodge at Hunters Creek\n, a palatial estate asking $60 million. The house at 302 Timberwilde has six bedrooms, seven bathrooms and 7,400 square feet, making the asking price about $1,100 per square foot.\nNot bad for a teardown\n.\n",

        "content": "As Pebblebrook Hotel Trust chairman and chief executive Jon Bortz previously told\nThe Real Deal\n, \u201cL.A. is a difficult market to sell in today due to unfriendly government policies and the lagging impact from the fires, strikes, ICE, National Guard.\u201d\nThe City of Los Angeles has its share of the regionwide challenges of homelessness and a specific $30 minimum wage for hotel workers and property transfer tax that seems to have investors looking to neighboring municipalities for deals. The transfer tax, known as Measure ULA, didn\u2019t come into play on our ranking of the priciest hotel sales in Los Angeles County because they were all either in other cities or were bought out of foreclosure.\nHere are Los Angeles County\u2019s top five hotel sales in 2025 based on the publication\u2019s analysis of public records and prior reporting.\nThe Line\n3515 Wilshire Boulevard\nLos Angeles\nCorten Real Estate Partners\npurchased\nThe Line in Koreatown for $68 million. The 384-key hotel was developed in 2014 by an entity connected to billionaire investor Ron Burkle and his Yucaipa Companies. Yucaipa secured a $100 million\nloan\nfrom Corten but later defaulted \u2014 then the lender made the buy. The distressed deal came out to $177,000 a room. No transfer taxes were paid due to the change of title via foreclosure.\nThe Montrose\n900 Hammond Street\nWest Hollywood\nPebblebrook Hotel Trust\nsold\nthe 133-key Montrose hotel in West Hollywood for roughly $44 million. The boutique hotel, near Sunset Boulevard, traded for about $333,000 a room. The company did not disclose the buyer at the time of sale, but a person familiar said it is a high-net-worth individual who has roots in Los Angeles, believes in its future and shops bargains in distressed markets. We now know that is Daniel Negari, founder and chief executive of XYZ, according to property records. He recently purchased two Irvine Company office towers in Downtown San Diego at a discount before the giant made its\nexit\n.\nThe Surfrider\n23033 Pacific Coast Highway\nMalibu\nLuxury fashion brand Chrome Hearts, owned by Richard and Laurie Stark,\npurchased\nthe Surfrider, a 20-key Malibu hotel, for $37.5 million. At about $1.9 million a room, it was California\u2019s priciest per-key deal all year, and one of the priciest ever. The seller of the luxe, oceanfront hotel at 23033 Pacific Coast Highway was Dauntless Capital Partners.\nMaison 140 &amp; the Mosaic\n140 South Lasky Drive and 125 South Spalding Drive\nBeverly HIlls\nMalta-based Corinthia Group and Kuwait-based Action Real Estate\npurchased\ntwo Beverly Hills hotels \u2014 the 44-room Maison 140 and the 49-room Mosaic Hotel \u2014 for $35 million. That comes out to roughly $376,000 per key. The seller of the two hotels, at 140 South Lasky Drive and 125 South Spalding Drive, is connected to Sandip Chadha, of the Chadha Family Trust, per records.\nThe Hyatt House\n810 South Douglas Street\nEl Segundo\nThe Mayer Corporation\u2019s Hyatt House hotel sold after it headed to a\nforeclosure auction\n. The company developed the five-story, 200-key hotel on the University of Southern California\u2019s health sciences campus, landed a $61.5 million loan from Westbrook Partners and then defaulted. The hotel at 810 South Douglas Street in El Segundo sold for $29 million or $105,000 a room. The buyer is not immediately known.\n",

The case could shift control of 5,100 rent-stabilized apartments across 93 buildings.\nWeaver told\nthe New York Times\nthe city was looking to ensure the new owner would pursue repairs and compliance with rent-stabilization laws.\nThe firm placed the buildings into Chapter 11 protection in May, after lender Flagstar Bank\nmoved toward foreclosure\non over $600 million in debt.\nThe portfolio spans Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, making Pinnacle Group one of New York\u2019s largest landlords.\nThe mayor\u2019s office\nsaid the buildings have been the subject of more than 5,000 violations, 14,000 complaints across 83 buildings over the years, and owed money to the city.\nPinnacle has argued in court filings the properties were compromised by a combination of factors, including high leverage,\nrising interest rates\n, increased operating and repair costs, and\nlimits on rent growth\nimposed by New York\u2019s rent-stabilization laws.\nWeaver brushed off the landlord\u2019s claims, telling\nthe Times\nthat the firm has a \u201clong track record \u2026 of egregiously treating renters in their buildings\u201d before the rent laws were passed in 2019.\nThe company \u201crelied on pushing people out of their homes and rent hikes that were untenable when you consider the affordability challenges that our city has,\u201d Weaver told the outlet.\nThe move kicked off Mamdani\u2019s time in office after a campaign that promised a four-year rent freeze for rent-stabilized tenants, a crackdown on bad landlords by revamping the Office to Protect Tenants, and exploring options for the city to take control of distressed properties.\nThe city\u2019s intervention in the Pinnacle bankruptcy would aim to enforce rent-stabilization laws and ensure any buyer is held responsible for fixing long-neglected building conditions, Mamdani said. He framed the case as a test of his administration\u2019s commitment to putting tenant safety and habitability ahead of distressed landlords\u2019 financial restructuring.\nThe move came days after Summit Properties USA made a\n$451 million stalking horse offer\nto acquire the 5,100 distressed units.\nThe bankruptcy paused foreclosure actions while the properties are marketed for sale under court supervision. Any sale would have to be approved by a judge.\n\u2014Rachel Stone",

        "content": "It wouldn\u2019t be the end of 2025 without one more office distress scenario playing out in Manhattan.\nThe debt backing Brookfield\u2019s\nOne New York Plaza\nwas shipped to special servicing recently, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The goal of the maneuver is to aid Brookfield in modifying the $835 million CMBS loan backing the 2.5 million-square-foot tower at the intersection of South and Whitehall streets in the Financial District.\nIt\u2019s unclear what prompted the transfer of the loan, but time is of the essence, as it\u2019s set to mature on Jan. 9. Brookfield has never been delinquent or late to make a payment on the debt.\nWells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and BMO Harris Bank provided the loan in 2020, refinancing a $750 million debt issued by Wells Fargo four years earlier. The refinancing included three-year extension options.\nBut cash flow and occupancy both declined at the 50-story tower in recent years. The loan was underwritten with an assumed net cash flow of $84.4 million, according to Morningstar Credit Analytics\u2019 David Putro, but last year\u2019s net cash flow was only $51.2 million.\nOccupancy, meanwhile, has fallen from 100 percent in 2022 to 83 percent as of this September. Office tenants include Morgan Stanley, law firm Fried Frank, and the New York State Office of General Services, while Starbucks and Chipotle are on the retail tenant roster.\nPutro expects Brookfield to pursue an extension on the loan. For its part, Brookfield appears ready to start 2026 with a breakthrough on the CMBS debt.\n\u201cGiven the circumstances and the constructive conversations to date, we are very confident that mutually agreeable extension terms can be achieved quickly with the special servicer,\u201d a spokesperson told the Observer.\nBrookfield can lean on recent success in this realm. In\nOctober alone\n, the landlord scored a $1.25 billion CMBS loan at 5 Manhattan West and a $1.2 billion CMBS loan at a recently redeveloped office tower at 660 Fifth Avenue.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Miki Naftali walks us on white marble floors to an indoor pool at the top of an\nUpper East Side\ncondo tower. He is eager to talk about the ceiling\u2019s heights.\n\u201cI mean, look at the size of the windows here,\u201d Naftali says, pointing to large arched openings that produce unobstructed views, all desired features of the building on East 83rd Street.\nListening to Naftali on the minutia, you momentarily forget he was the guy whose most sweeping deal was buying The Plaza Hotel in 2004 for what was then a record price per room.\nNow, the short and upbeat 63-year-old in clear-framed glasses has paid about a record price per square foot for a residential development site at 800 Fifth Avenue, where he plans to demolish the current structure and put up a 26-story\nRobert A.M. Stern tower\nfor New York\u2019s blue bloods and billionaires.\nIt\u2019s a project that celebrity broker Ryan Serhant believes will be the one the \u201cworld talks about for the next 30 years.\u201d\nIf Serhant is right, Naftali will be etching his name beside the city\u2019s real estate legends, along with Gary Barnett, the Dursts, Rudins, Silversteins and Elghanayans.\nNaftali became a major player in New York real estate seemingly overnight when he bought The Plaza for $675 million while at his former employer El Ad, ruffling feathers of the city\u2019s powerful hotel union and over plans to convert hotel rooms to luxury condos.\nThat splash laid a foundation for Naftali as a dealmaker \u2013 even before final numbers for the Plaza conversion came in. After that, he struck out on his own and did small but successful projects, gaining a reputation as an uptown tastemaker. His buildings are subtle, often with limestone facades, in line with the neighborhood and their residents\u2019 disdain for glass and steel structures favored by New York condo kings. His projects have brought in $1.6 billion worth of financing this year, he said.\n\u201c\u200b\u200bThese are not projects that are done in three years.\u201d\nJonah Sonnenborn, Access Industries, on why Naftali\u2019s big swings need patient capital\nEven before 800 Fifth, Naftali had begun doing deals on the level of The Plaza, while also expanding outside Manhattan. He\u2019s bringing 950 residential units to North Brooklyn with a project called the\nWilliamsburg Wharf,\na 67-story tower to Miami and a luxury-branded condo to Fort Lauderdale.\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the next couple of years, we have about $5 billion between New York and South Florida to sell, and this is in addition to about 2,000 rental units, right?\u201d\nThe question is whether Naftali can work on this scale with the laser precision and approach to windows and ceiling heights that have made projects like 200 East 83rd Street so successful. Condo development is always risky, in sway to foreign currency fluctuations, timing and the whims of a few buyers whose complaints about finishes can halt sales.\nNaftali combats the uncertainty with diligence. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do your research, you have no chance to be successful. And even if you do your research, sometimes you can make mistakes,\u201d he said.\nS\ningles and doubles\nNaftali moved to the United States from Israel in the 1980s and studied engineering at the University of Southern California. He got a job at El Ad Properties \u2014 run by Israeli billionaire Yitzhak Tshuva \u2014 in 2000 and was surprised to be working on straightforward projects out of a nondescript office in Fort Lee, New Jersey.\nBut he picked up bigger and bigger deals until he purchased The Plaza, which overnight made him a major player.\nNaftali had wanted to strike out on his own, but the financial crisis delayed his plans to exit El Ad. In 2011, he opened the Naftali Group.\n\u201cPeople were skeptical, and rightly so,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I had to start with smaller properties and start to grow the business and get the confidence [to] tap into investors in equity funds that I didn\u2019t know before.\u201d\nNaftali\u2019s first independent deals were a handful of rental buildings in Brooklyn; condos in Gramercy Park, Chelsea and the West Village; and a slew of uptown buildings on either side of Central Park.\n\u201cI tend to shy away from the ultra-tall buildings,\u201d he said.\nHe gained a reputation for luxurious, highly amenitized buildings that catered to Manhattan\u2019s upper crust. While he\u2019s ventured downtown and put up a few glassy structures, he\u2019s mostly known for the quiet limestone look that evokes old money status.\n\u201cHe\u2019s more of the Robert Stern school of architecture: limestone facades, classic finishes, not really pushing the envelope but more timeless,\u201d Craig George of Sotheby\u2019s said.\nGeorge added that while Naftali might not have the international recognition of a developer like, say, Extell\u2019s Gary Barnett, he\u2019s definitely got clout with local buyers: \u201cNew Yorkers know his reputation.\u201d\nHe\u2019s done four buildings so far with Robert A.M. Stern\u2019s office (800 Fifth will be the fifth and, possibly one of the last that the famed architect ever worked on \u2014 Stern died last year; see page 56).\nCompass\u2019 Alexa Lambert, who\u2019s headed sales on many of Naftali\u2019s buildings, agreed with the developer\u2019s own assessment that the details matter, even if construction is longer and more expensive.\n\u201cHe bet that people will appreciate it if you do things the right way,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so far he\u2019s been both right and lucky.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no shortcuts, no noise, no ego,\u201d Serhant said. \u201cThat\u2019s the trifecta for creating greatness in the development business, it\u2019s hard to find a developer who has one of those themes, let alone all three.\u201d\nNaftali\u2019s character sets him apart from other developers. He\u2019s not brash or physically imposing. When he was working in Israel, he said he felt out of place because people were always yelling to get the attention of contractors or subcontractors.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t think that he knows everything,\u201d said Glenn Grimaldi, the former head of U.S. commercial real estate at HSBC who now works at Naftali.\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked with him on a dozen projects over 15 and 20 years,\u201d Stuart Saft, who leads Holland &amp; Knight\u2019s real estate practice group, said. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard him raise his voice, he has authority, he delegates, but he\u2019s not one of these guys when a problem arises he starts screaming at everyone.\u201d\nT\naking Fifth Avenue\nBernard Spitzer developed 800 Fifth Avenue in 1978 on a prime corner at East 61st Street, a stone\u2019s throw away from Grand Army Plaza at the southeast corner of Central Park.\nThe building never really fit the location. Built during the financial struggles of the 1970s, units have low ceilings and basic layouts; the facade never stood up to its grand limestone neighbors.\nAfter Naftali went into contract in March to buy 800 Fifth Avenue from Spitzer Enterprises and the Winter Organization for $810 million, Adam Doneger of Newmark took to LinkedIn to announce that it was the highest price per square foot for land ever. Based on square footage from Property Shark, that would put the price per square foot at about $2,275.\nNaftali acknowledged the high price.\n\u201cWe looked at 800 Fifth and we said, there is only one,\u201d he said. This is the only opportunity anyone will ever have to develop such a prime piece of land overlooking Central Park. \u201cWe think that you pay a big price for a special property. So, time will tell if we are right.\u201d\nThe opportunity is similar to what The Plaza offered in 2004. The condos there drew in buyers like Harry Macklowe, Tommy Hilfiger and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\nBut The Plaza\u2019s conversion had obstacles.\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy right now. In the next couple of years, we have about $5 billion between New York and South Florida to sell, and this is in addition to about 2,000 rental units.\u201d\nMiki Naftali\nIn February 2007, Russian hedge fund manager Andrei Vavilov went into contract to buy two of the project\u2019s condos for $53.5 million. But he sued El Ad, insisting the apartments were \u201cattic like\u201d due to small windows, low ceilings, obstructed views and ugly drainage grates \u2014 demanding his $10.7 million deposit back and $36 million in damages.\nEl Ad countersued, saying the lawsuit was full of false and defamatory statements, and that Vavilov was just trying to get out of his obligation to buy the apartments.\nThe two sides settled, and Vavilov agreed to buy the smaller of the two units for $11.2 million, which he quickly turned around and sold for a $2.8 million loss.\nA number of owners, in fact, have sold their homes for a loss or just broken even.\nHilfiger bought his two units for $25.5 million and reportedly spent another $20 million, combining them into a penthouse. He put it up for sale \u2014 at one point asking $80 million \u2014 and after 11 years sold it for $31.5 million.\nExperts have said that The Plaza\u2019s best sales happened during pre-sales before people could see their units, and resales were hurt by competition from newer buildings like One Central Park South and 432 Park Avenue.\nV\nenture to Brooklyn\nAs Naftali was selling out new condo towers uptown, he had his eyes on a site across the East River. Naftali was among the many Manhattan luxury builders over the past decade who saw potential in a 3.7-acre site in Williamsburg.\nThey saw the property as the last undeveloped land site in North Brooklyn. It was owned since the 1980s by Abraham and Isaac Rosenberg, for their lumber business. They had their own plans to redevelop the property but were stalled by infighting within the brothers\u2019 Satmar Hasidic community, where two factions, the Aronites and the Zalmanites, were bickering over the best use of the property.\nThe Rosenbergs put the property on the market in 2013. HFZ Capital and Vornado Realty Trust both looked at it, according to The Real Deal articles from the time.\nBut the Rosenbergs discovered that petroleum, pesticides, PCBs and other pollutants had contaminated the site, quashing interest. Three years after that, Isaac died in a drowning accident while swimming off the coast of North Miami Beach.\nNaftali said he became friendly with Abraham at some point that decade. In 2019, it emerged that he\u2019d persuaded Abraham Rosenberg to sell.\n\u201cIt took me about two years to get them to agree to sell it to us,\u201d Naftali previously told\nTRD\n.\nNaftali could make the deal work, unlike developers who\u2019d been scared off. He had the time and money from a big-money equity partner in Len Blavatnik\u2019s Access Industries to go through the cleanup and remediation process. Naftali paid $180 million in 2019 and $100 million in 2020 for the parcels.\n\u201cA lot of [other potential bidders on the site] couldn\u2019t figure out the complexity of a complicated seller counterparty. They also knew that given the amount of buildable square footage that it was going to be a very significant equity requirement,\u201d Jonah Sonnenborn of Access Industries said.\nAccess also wasn\u2019t worried about a complicated deal. It was the firm, along with Witkoff, which ultimately took over the unfinished XI condo project on Manhattan\u2019s High Line when HFZ Capital collapsed.\nAccess and Naftali plan to bring a\nmini-neighborhood\nto Williamsburg.\nWilliamsburg Wharf\nwill span five residential towers with 500 rental units and about 450 condos.\n\u201cIn projects that are larger and more ambitious, it requires more patient capital. It requires permanent capital. These are not projects that are done in three years,\u201d Sonnenborn said.\nCondo sales have already impressed the industry. Williamsburg is a less tested market than the Upper East Side because there are fewer comps. But Naftali is already setting records. An 89-unit condo portion of the project sold 50 percent as of April, making it the city\u2019s top-selling building, according to Marketproof.\nE\nxpansion Mode\nNaftali is not a trend follower.\nSo when his peers started building in Miami Beach and Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood in the late 2010s, Naftali stayed put in New York. He missed the wave of wealthy New Yorkers seeking new condos in South Florida during Covid.\nIn 2022, Naftali saw an opportunity in a less glamorous part of Miami. He joined with Cara Real Estate Management and paid $40.5 million for a 1-acre site in a development site dubbed The WorldCenter. The building will be Naftali\u2019s tallest, a 67-story tower with a mix of condos and rental apartments.\nIn Miami, Naftali\u2019s pitch is similar to that of other New York developers: that he can bring New York-level living to Miami.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to get the quality in South Florida and in Miami. I mean, we\u2019re sitting in a building that\u2019s not the most expensive building in New York by any stretch of imagination, but the quality here is really good quality,\u201d Naftali said, gesturing around the East 83rd Street condo\u2019s amenity floor.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to get it in New York,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more difficult to get it in South Florida.\u201d\nMiamians roll their eyes at these sorts of claims, and Naftali makes clear there are talented developers in South Florida. Still, fewer condo builders are able to meet buyer expectations, according to Naftali.\n\u201cSpeak with brokers in Miami, and I think the last couple of years, they see it more and more, there is a big difference between some of the projects, between the beautiful renderings at the beginning and the end product,\u201d he said.\nOutside of Miami, Naftali is making an even bolder bet in Fort Lauderdale. The city is seeking to change its reputation as a hub for spring breakers and boat enthusiasts, and Naftali is betting on this potential with a 45-story branded condo.\nHe has also expanded into the debt business, launching a credit arm in 2019 and hiring Grimaldi in 2022. The business focuses on mezzanine loans to other builders.\nMiki\u2019s daughter Danielle is head of marketing sales and design \u2014 she keeps him on his toes, he said. Together, the two review every offer they get.\n\u201cIf, God forbid, I don\u2019t see it for five minutes, Danielle immediately texts me and \u2014 she doesn\u2019t call me dad, she calls me Miki \u2014 \u2018Miki did you see this offer?\u2019\u201d\nT\nhe Cycle\nNaftali\u2019s buildings tend to blend admirably into their surroundings instead of standing out like the towers on Billionaire\u2019s Row or those with flashy architecture.\nAnd the same could be said about the man himself.\nYet 800 Fifth will inevitably draw comparisons to the Zeckendorf\u2019s Stern-designed \u201cLimestone Jesus\u201d at 15 Central Park West, the supertalls on 57th Street and, to some extent, Naftali\u2019s Plaza conversion.\n(Things did not go well for the last developer who sought to do large-scale condo developments uptown: Ziel Feldman\u2019s HFZ Capital collapsed during Covid, losing historic Beaux Arts buildings such as the Belnord and the Astor to foreclosure. HFZ\u2019s managing principal Nir Meir was indicted in early 2024, accused of masterminding a $86 million fraud scheme in which he allegedly siphoned money out of the project accounts. Meir has pleaded not guilty.)\nSo what gives the developer the confidence he can pull it all off? It\u2019s the small successes, built over time. The attention to detail that hasn\u2019t wavered as projects have grown more ambitious.\n\u201cWe started to build it, and now we\u2019re 14 years after that,\u201d Naftali said of what might seem like a fast rise. \u201cSo this didn\u2019t happen in a day or a month.\u201d\nNaftali also points back to The Plaza. He\u2019s already got the experience, he said.\n\u201cI did it back at El Ad.\u201d",

It\u2019s more an assessment of what neighborhoods are being overtaxed versus undertaxed.\u201d)\nThat pledge expanded the \u201ctax the rich\u201d fear to wealthy, upper-middle class and middle-class homeowners who have enjoyed relatively low rates even as the values of their properties have surged.\n\u201cReading the tea leaves, it feels like personal tax is off the table, but corporate and real estate taxes don\u2019t seem to have the same \u2018no\u2019 fervor,\u201d Compass\u2019 Jason Haber said.\nMamdani reiterated to The Real Dealhis commitment to an across-the-board overhaul the week before he took office.\n\u201cWhen the city\u2019s wealthiest homeowners pay less in property taxes than working families across the five boroughs, it\u2019s clear our property tax system is broken,\u201d Dora Pekec, his spokesperson wrote. \u201cMayor-elect Zohran Mamdani will use the full power of the mayor\u2019s office to fix this inequity and ensure that the wealthiest homeowners pay their fair share and working New Yorkers aren\u2019t left carrying the burden.\u201d\nT\nhe politics of it\nFor decades, New York City property tax reform has been a chimera. Most agree it\u2019s necessary, yet no one has managed to make it real.\nOne of the biggest obstacles is that comprehensive reform will require action at both the city and state level. There\u2019s been a lack of political will to be the administration that picks winners and losers.\nWhile the city has purview over how properties are assessed, the main governing law is a state-level statute, which means substantive changes to it would need to be approved by Albany. But in order to make reform a reality, a New York City mayor would likely need to propose and shepherd the updates through the state legislature.\nMayor Bill de Blasio may have gotten closest when he set up an advisory commission to study the issue, but by the time it released recommendations, he was already on his way out. Mayor Eric Adams campaigned on a promise to \u201cimmediately\u201d overhaul the system but took no meaningful steps forward.\nNow the buck passes to Mamdani, who has a few things on his side that his predecessors did not, indicating that his vow to tackle the issue might not be another empty promise. For one, as TRD pointed out in October, he\u2019s made taxing the rich a central part of his platform, so previous mayors\u2019 concerns about upsetting residents with deep pockets likely won\u2019t weigh as heavily on him.\n\u201cIt feels like personal tax is off the table, but corporate and real estate taxes don\u2019t seem to have the same \u2018no\u2019 fervor.\u201d\nCompass\u2019 Jason Haber\nHe\u2019s also stepping into the role after the state\u2019s highest court gave a relevant, long-running lawsuit new legs. The Court of Appeals in 2024 ruled in favor of Tax Equity Now New York\u2019s petition to revive some of its claims against the city, arguing that the current property tax system is \u201cunfair, inequitable and has a discriminatory disparate impact on certain protected classes of New York City property owners.\u201d The group brought the lawsuit against the city and state in 2017, although the appellate court agreed to drop the group\u2019s claims against the state.\nThe lawsuit argues that homeowners in outer boroughs and working class neighborhoods are on the hook for higher tax rates compared to those in the city\u2019s wealthiest areas.\nUnder New York property tax law, condos and co-ops must be assessed in relation to rental buildings, and current city practice is to tie many of those values to rent-stabilized buildings. TENNY\u2019s\ncomplaint\nalso calls for the city to begin taxing some co-ops and condos at the same rate as market-rate rental buildings, a power it argues is under the city\u2019s control.\nWith part of TENNY\u2019s case reopened, the group and the city went back to the state Supreme Court and presented oral arguments in October. They\u2019re awaiting the judge\u2019s decision, which TENNY\u2019s policy director, Martha Stark, said should be handed down by press time.\nBut Stark also said that the appellate judges\u2019 order already paved the way for the city to make changes to its assessment practices without the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion.\nFor owners of properties with rent-stabilized units, property tax reform is a welcome prospect. Mamdani\u2019s commitment to freezing rents has so far meant he is open to hearing from these landlords about how to bring down their spending, including on property taxes, so they don\u2019t go broke.\nT\nax burden\nThe prospect of an overhaul is a touchy subject for a certain cohort of New Yorkers, especially owners of co-ops and condos in buildings where sales have been pricey, making them ripe for reform.\nIn court documents, TENNY pointed to several luxury co-ops that had been assessed using rent-stabilized buildings last year, including 998 Fifth Avenue, where Est\u00e9e Lauder chairman William Lauder sold his apartment for nearly $38 million in September.\nUnder the current system\u2019s wonky math, the swanky co-op was compared to a rental building at 945 Fifth Avenue, which includes both market-rate and rent-stabilized units, and then given a lower assessment.\nBut assessing properties in line with market-rate rentals could raise some tax bills to levels unsustainable for many owners, according to Rebecca Poole, membership director for the Council of New York Cooperatives &amp; Condominiums.\n\u201cNo matter what changes are made, there will obviously be winners and losers, and some of the losers shouldn\u2019t be losers,\u201d Poole said. \u201cHopefully, [Mamdani will] see the needs of the middle class homeowners.\u201d\nOne potential tool to make sure \u201closers\u201d don\u2019t lose too badly would be for Mamdani to push for so-called circuit breakers, stop gaps that cap or slow the rise of an assessed value or tax bill if it goes above a certain level, a mechanism he\u2019s already acknowledged he\u2019s considering.\nCo-ops and condo owners also don\u2019t have the same protections as owners of one-to-three-family homes, where a cap bars the city from raising assessed values more than 6 percent each year or more than 20 percent over five years. That cap is especially important for homeowners in neighborhoods where property values have skyrocketed.\nBut the future of that cap could be in question, given Mamdani\u2019s campaign\u2019s stance on shifting the tax burden to richer, Whiter neighborhoods.\nS\nooner or later\nGiven the lawsuit, it\u2019s likely that the city could decide to change how it assesses co-ops and condos as soon as Mamdani takes office, although some say any significant shifts would likely be phased in or out, not immediately instituted. Mamdani, unlike other mayors, has expressed support for TENNY\u2019s lawsuit, signaling he\u2019s more open to going along with its findings than his predecessors. That includes changing assessment ratios, which could lower bills for homeowners in some working class neighborhoods.\nBut more substantive changes to taxation would happen later. If Mamdani does introduce a plan to, for example, change the cap on assessed values for one-to three- family homes, passage and implementation would most likely be years away.\nThat may not be much comfort to the city\u2019s 1 million homeowners. If Mamdani were to adopt the issue as one of his priorities, the back and forth over the fate of property taxes could stall sales or give buyers the upper hand in negotiations for homes likely to be affected by any changes.\n\u201cIf you want to make consumers scared of investing in New York City real estate, the worst thing you can do is play this out over a long time,\u201d appraiser Jonathan Miller said. \u201cUncertainty does no favors to the housing market.\u201d",

        "content": "The seven-story building at the Northeast corner of Walker and Church streets in Tribeca is mostly scaffolding \u2014 for now.\nBut behind the curtain of beams and blue netting, the team at 32 Walker Street has been busy. Serhant\u2019s Peter Zaitzeff has been quietly shopping five full-floor condos, one of which has already sold after asking close to $10 million.\nZaitzeff, who is heading sales at the project, said his goal is to lock in three buyers before putting up any public listings.\nThe quiet sales process is not a one-off, and is becoming something of a perk offered by the top shelf in New York new development.\nAfter some brokers in 2023\ndeclared the death of the sales gallery, the latest wave of projects came online with little to no public listings, sales offices akin to Harry Potter\u2019s elusive Platform 9 3/4 and scarce Internet presence.\nThis includes several of the city\u2019s \u201c\nIt buildings\n,\u201d like 80 Clarkson, Zeckendorf Development and Atlas Capital Group\u2019s buzzy development, and Aurora Capital Group\u2019s and William Gottlieb Real Estate\u2019s exclusive boutique at 140 Jane Street, which\nfound a buyer\nfor a penthouse asking $87.5 million.\nWhen The Real Deal reached out to Corcoran\u2019s Tara King-Brown, who is leading sales at 140 Jane along with Corcoran Sunshine, a spokesperson for the project responded, saying that \u201cin the spirit of a quiet new development sales strategy, the team will not be commenting for the story.\u201d\nAt 80 Clarkson, which has eschewed publicity down to filing piecemeal offering plans with the Attorney General\u2019s Office that only revealed a handful of units at a time, the project is well on its way to a $2 billion sellout. The project has not even recorded contracts, an even more extreme level of stealth than competitors. In December,\nTRD\nreported that the building found a buyer willing to pay $129 million for multiple units in the building, which would smash the record for priciest sale downtown.\nRepresentatives for 80 Clarkson did not respond to requests for comment.\nThey really have no need to. The city is bursting at the seams with wealthy buyers who are only getting richer yet aren\u2019t finding enough homes that meet their standards. Quiet sales have also created a hierarchy among brokers, with the select few who gain access because of the caliber of their clients signing contracts at places that the rest of the market hasn\u2019t even heard about.\nThe trend has sparked big market moves even at smaller projects. At a nondescript brick garage in the West Village, four buyers have already signed contracts for homes in what will become a seven-unit boutique condo at 125 Perry Street. One of them bought a unit asking $57.5 million, making it among the most expensive downtown condos.\nCompass\u2019 Stephen Ferrara, one of the agents marketing the building, said that as soon as the sales team started talking about the project, they had a \u201cconsiderable inbound response.\u201d\n\u201cI think people really underestimate how deep the buying pool is,\u201d he said.\nN\nothing to buy\nBefore 2020, it was not unusual to see multiple developments looking to sell more than $500 million \u2014 or in some cases, $1 billion \u2014 in condos.\nDuring those heady days, buildings had to do what they could to break through the noise: splashy spreads in the New York Times, elaborate launch parties and sales offices designed to stick out amid the crowd.\nIn 2012, Gary Barnett\u2019s first Billionaires\u2019 Row tower, One57, had a model of the building\u2019s library with a 24-foot aquarium installed in one wall in its sales office. When HFZ\nlaunched\nits twisting towers along the High Line known as XI in 2018, the project\u2019s sales office had pieces installed by the stage designer for Kanye West and Lady Gaga, including a foyer with a eucalyptus wall and screens with simulated river views.\nSix years later, the game has changed.\nThe project at 80 Clarkson is the first to attempt to do more than $2 billion in sales since the XI, now known as One High Line, and no other approved condo project this year even topped $400 million. The years of shrinking developments have pushed unsold condo units to a 10-year low, according to data shared by Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Herm\u00e8s bag that nobody else can get.\u201d\nPeter Zaitzeff on quiet luxury listings\nThe vanishing competition has given sales teams free rein to handle their processes as they see fit.\n\u201cIt put sellers in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d Zaitzeff said of the limited supply of new condos. \u201cI feel like I could sell a C-plus project right now. The lack of inventory gives us a lot more leverage to get a better price and also to sell out a lot more quickly.\u201d\nCorcoran\u2019s Nicole Hechter has sold six buildings for the development firm Grid Group, all with a typical public-facing sales rollout.\nBut for the seventh, a 22-unit boutique building called The Myles, she\u2019s instead taking appointments at the development\u2019s VIP sales gallery. (Corcoran denied The Real Deal access to the office.)\nHechter said the decision was made after seeing the success of other downtown developments and the inbound calls she received before even doing any marketing.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just such a lack of inventory in this specific segment of the market that I think we\u2019re getting a tremendous amount of outreach,\u201d she said.\nAn 18-unit boutique at 220 East 9th Street, Ferrara had over 1,000 registrations on the \u201cComing Soon\u201d website before putting up a single listing. \u201cIt caught all of us by surprise,\u201d he said.\nBrokers said that projects with units asking at least $3,000 per foot or $10 million are a typical threshold, where the buyer is already inherently limited by the price.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to a small network of buyers,\u201d Zaitzeff said. In that price bracket, \u201cit\u2019s the 5 percent of agents who do 95 percent of deals.\u201d\nBut beyond being expensive, it seems that projects need a certain something \u2014 a name-brand architect or developer, a superprime location or a truly superior product (something every marketing team says it has).\nEach project has an unreplicable selling point. At 80 Clarkson, buyers have the chance to pick up a piece of a revolutionary phenomenon: a Billionaires\u2019 Row-caliber offering, downtown. The prime units in 125 Perry Street and 140 Jane Street offer incomparable location, and the design from Leroy Street Studio have been major draws. There is only one triangle-shaped Flatiron Building.\nMass marketing can still work for projects with a wider potential pool of buyers, at a certain threshold, the exclusivity becomes another selling point.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Herm\u00e8s bag that nobody else can get,\u201d Zaitzeff said. \u201cThat\u2019s the perception that we\u2019re getting to the market with a product like this.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s not a simple plug-and-play for buildings that cater to the high end of the market.\nAt the Aman Residences at 730 Fifth Avenue, the OKO Group eschewed a public-facing sales office and launched just a handful of its original 22 units in 2017. Developer Vlad Doronin told the Wall Street Journal at the time that the restrained sales strategy spoke to the brand\u2019s exclusivity. But by 2022, the building still had 17 unsold condos, according to an update filed with the Attorney General\u2019s office.\nLuxury housing report author Donna Olshan said the strategy at the time was to market to foreign buyers with brand loyalty \u2014 but she\u2019s skeptical of the whole proposition.\n\u201cIn my over 45 years of experience, the best results are achieved by pricing the property correctly, presenting it in its best light, and immediately marketing to the entire brokerage community to generate maximum activity and create an auction effect,\u201d she writes on her website.\nD\nesperate money\nIt remains to be seen just how restrictive incoming additions to New York\u2019s new development scene can be. But the trend is likely here to stay in the city where the richest have gotten richer in the last few years.\nAfter the first half of 2025, Wall Street firms were on pace for more than $60 billion in profits, after having already seen those numbers jump 90 percent the previous year, to $50 billion. The bonus pool hit record numbers in 2025 as well, and could be on pace to do so again this year, according to a report from the state comptroller\u2019s office.\nThe money flowing through the city has been reflected in a strong luxury market, where contracts for homes asking at least $4 million rose 51 percent in November compared to a year earlier.\nDevelopers are poised with a new playbook to entice future big spenders.\nSome buildings have rolled out pricing on a handful of units, giving developers more flexibility to up the pricing of other units later if the market seems to call for it. \u201cPsychologically it\u2019s easier to push pricing if you haven\u2019t already stated what your pricing is going to be,\u201d said Stephen Kliegerman, president of Brown Harris Stevens Development Marketing.\nIn a market flush with cash buyers and tight inventory, developers can then pitch buyers on getting in early \u2014 before the rest of the market comes flooding in.\nA quiet sales process can also be a way to appeal to those buyers, Kliegerman said, setting off a win-win-win scenario for developers, brokers and buyers.\n\u201cPeople of great means love shiny new items that very few other people can afford, or avail themselves of,\u201d he said. \u201cLike-minded people like to know that they\u2019re special and they like to know that their broker or their name carries enough weight to get them access.\u201d",

        "content": "Since the pandemic, New York City affordable developer Phipps has been giving more and getting less.\nPhipps manages about 10,000 affordable housing units using a comprehensive model, meaning that it provides social services to tenants \u2014 even to those who\nhaven\u2019t paid their rent\n.\n\u201cIt\u2019s become quite a burden on us for property management and social services to try to get the help needed for our families,\u201d Cathy Pennington of Phipps said.\nDistress in New York\u2019s subsidized affordable housing has been worsening since the 2019 Housing Stability &amp; Tenant Protection Act became law and then soaring insurance payments, high utility bills and increasingly expensive maintenance added pressure from the cost side.\nBut buried in the conversation is the fact that the revenue side of the equation has also taken a hit. Tenants, it seems, just don\u2019t\npay their rent\nlike they used to.\nThose in the affordable housing space have their theories about why that is: cultural shifts, economic forces and a system that helps only the renters in the worst shape. One thing they can agree on? It\u2019s not clear that collections will ever naturally recover.\n\u201cAs a lender, we\u2019re treating this as the new normal,\u201d said said Robert Riggs, from Community Preservation Corporation, a nonprofit lender.\nThe drop in collections and squeezing of revenue might on its own be brutal to New York\u2019s affordable housing. But combined with sharply rising expenses, the prognosis may be fatal.\nS\ntaying put\nAt Enterprise Community Partners, a nonprofit lender, the average rent collection in its New York affordable projects was once 95 percent. Now, it\u2019s\ncloser to 90\n.\nThe number of projects experiencing more concerning collection rates has also more than tripled. In 2017, just 3 percent of projects had collection rates below 80 percent. Now that figure is 11 percent.\nA shift from 95 to 90 percent may not seem big. But it can mean a loss of about $6,000 per month or $75,000 per year, according to Enterprise. That\u2019s as much as the annual insurance payment on three or four units.\n\u201cThat really does represent a lot of lost income to the properties,\u201d Patrick Boyle of Enterprise said.\nDuring the pandemic, market-rate units had increasing vacancies and lower rents, since tenants moved out of the city and supply overtook demand. But those living in regulated housing were both more likely to see their jobs cut and less likely to move away. They stayed where they were, and those who couldn\u2019t pay just \u2026 didn\u2019t.\nAnother nonprofit lender, Community Preservation Corporation, had collections at projects in its portfolio dip close to 70 percent during that time. Before the pandemic, the lender would underwrite all its projects to 95 percent collections, and it expected an even higher rate.\n\u201cThey kind of have to roll their dice out to the edge. Which is awful, right? But they won\u2019t help you unless you\u2019re in that position.\u201d\nJohn Crotty, founding member at Workforce Housing Group\n\u201cBefore the pandemic, it was just a truism in the industry that people with below-market rents paid their rent,\u201d Riggs said.\nSince then, CPC has had to revise its strategy.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t underwrite to 95 percent collections anymore,\u201d Riggs said. \u201cThere\u2019s no track record of that happening in the last 5 years.\u201d\nThe collections numbers still hover at about 92 percent.\nAffordable housing in New York is developed by both nonprofit and for-profit operators, who agree to certain conditions to access city and state funding and financing. One is pegging maximum rent increases to levels set by the city\u2019s Rent Guidelines Board. A freeze on those increases, the marquee campaign promise of mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, would stymie revenue even further.\nIt\u2019s not totally clear to what extent the trend in New York\u2019s affordable housing mirrors collection declines in the market-rate and national housing markets. Data is difficult to come by, especially pre-pandemic data. The American Apartment Owners Association says that traffic to its collections agency has stabilized since the pandemic, and the National Multifamily Housing Council has stopped monitoring national rent collections.\nThose who study these numbers say that they believe national collections in market-rate housing are just slightly below where they were pre-pandemic, but that\u2019s based more on educated hunches than on hard numbers.\n\u201cEverything within our data suggests that even when renters do fall behind, they show a high priority to catch back up,\u201d Jonathan O\u2019Kane of Chandan Economics, which monitors rental performance, said.\nBoyle, at Enterprise, said that he believes the issue is most acute in the affordable space, but not just in the city. About one-quarter of the projects in the nonprofit\u2019s data are outside the five boroughs.\nO\nut on the edge\nAmong borrowers in CPC\u2019s portfolio, collections are uneven across properties, Riggs said. But the lender has so far failed to find a pattern. Did the pandemic and the eviction moratorium change how tenants think about and prioritize rent? Are tenants who don\u2019t pay making their neighbors wonder why they don\u2019t do the same?\n\u201cSometimes we see an owner with similar buildings and the same management company in the same neighborhood and they have completely different collections,\u201d Riggs said.\nBut at the base of the issue, some in the affordable space say, is a tight financial reality.\n\u201cIf you have no money and there\u2019s three choices you have, and one of them is food, then there\u2019s the other two,\u201d John Crotty, a founding member at Workforce Housing Group and former city official, said. \u201cPeople are broke, they\u2019re hurting.\u201d\nThose in lower-cost housing are more likely to find themselves in a pinch.\n\u201cEveryone is concerned with affordability,\u201d Oksana Mironova, a housing policy analyst at the Community Service Society, said. \u201cLower-income people are the ones who are always hit.\u201d\nAt the same time, some city policies incentivize tenants to fall deeper into arrears. Housing court takes months, keeping renters in units they can\u2019t pay for without help.\nSometimes it takes being nearly evicted for a tenant to qualify for city resources.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to prevent eviction, but unfortunately, after a period of time and as the arrears grow, we do have to turn to the courts to help us,\u201d Pennington of Phipps said. \u201cAnd sometimes in court, they finally get the help they need.\u201d\nFor example, the city\u2019s \u201cone shot\u201d deal helps the neediest New Yorkers get out of arrears with a lump sum payment. But prioritizing only those in severe distress, some say, makes renters go through greater deprivation in the hopes of getting help.\n\u201cThey kind of have to roll their dice out to the edge,\u201d Crotty said. \u201cWhich is awful, right? But they won\u2019t help you unless you\u2019re in that position.\u201d\nOther rental assistance programs, such as the CityFHEPS voucher program, can end quickly, leaving a tenant in a unit they can\u2019t afford, Pennington said.\nThe highest levels of rent nonpayment are likely in metropolitan areas where rents have risen steeply since the pandemic and salaries have not kept up, according to Alexandra Alvarado of the American Apartment Owners Association. The median rent for a new lease in Manhattan has risen 13 percent in the past year, according to a December report from Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel.\n\u201cThe majority of people are just struggling financially,\u201d Alvarado said of those who aren\u2019t paying nationally. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s necessarily a choice.\u201d\nP\nush and pull\nThose in the affordable and nonprofit space are keen to discuss carrots, not sticks. They focus on easing access to city resources.\nThe New York Housing Conference, which advocates for affordable housing, has proposed a separate housing court specifically for those in subsidized units. Staff there could assist with accessing city one-shot deals and other rental assistance programs. This could, at least in theory, save the city money by helping tenants when they have less in arrears.\n\u201cThe tenant gets so far in the hole in accumulated arrears that they can\u2019t dig their way out,\u201d Rachel Fee, the group\u2019s executive director, said.\nBut speeding up housing court could also ease evictions.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s some hope \u2014 and this is terrible to say \u2014 that as evictions start to happen at a faster rate, that behavior will change,\u201d said Riggs.\nBut in the meantime, they say, something has to give. Piling on expenses without more revenue is pushing affordable housing toward a cliff.\n\u201cThe lack of cash coming in from failure to pay rent, and the court system not changing that in any timely fashion, indeed making it longer, is fatal,\u201d Crotty said via email. \u201cBuilding owners can\u2019t withstand it.",

        "content": "Sales slow, costs mount and investors grumble and place blame on e-commerce, tariffs or a pandemic:\nAnother\nretail\nchain\nis filing for bankruptcy. While creditors cross their fingers and lawyers go to court, landlords brace for missed payments.\nThis is when Ivan Friedman\u2019s phone rings.\n\u201cIn my business, bad is good,\u201d he said.\nOn the line, often, are the private equity firms and ownership groups who want to swoop in and buy low. To rescue a bankrupt chain, the companies need someone to renegotiate rents on hundreds of stores. It\u2019s unpleasant but critical grunt work, and many believe Friedman does it best.\nPlenty of mall mainstays have hit bottom during the four decades of his career. Friedman\u2019s company, Manhattan-based RCS Real Estate Advisors, was the go-between for retailers and their landlords for many of them. Friedman\u2019s arrangements can enable their survival. When\nClaire\u2019s\n, facing a $496 million loan it couldn\u2019t afford, filed for Chapter 11 last summer, the buyer turned to Friedman to\nfix its leases\nbefore closing on the sale. During Simon Property Group and Brookfield Corporation\u2019s purchase of Express out of bankruptcy in 2024, RCS saved the brand nearly $100 million on real estate obligations, court records show.\nEven those that have stayed out of bankruptcy, like Vans, Gap, Cole Hahn and Hollister, have used RCS\u2019 services to pay less for spaces or strategize expansions.\nThe typical story played out one Friday night a few years ago. Friedman was en route to his beach house when a call came in from an unfamiliar number. It was the head of a private equity firm that had recently purchased a national retailer out of bankruptcy.\n\u201cWe got a problem,\u201d the executive said.\nThe retailer and one of its landlords, a major shopping mall owner, could not agree on a reduced rent, putting nearly 300 of its more than 1,200 stores, and their revenue, at risk. As the court deadline approached and negotiations failed to advance, the executive started to sweat.\nFriedman worked out the numbers. If he could reduce the rent on that group of stores to 40 percent of the original, would the firm take that deal?\nAbsolutely, the executive said.\nAt the house, Friedman called the landlord. Only a handful of owners own most of the country\u2019s\nmalls\n, so a call from Friedman doesn\u2019t just mean they\u2019re about to accept less money at one location but that they may have to reduce the rent across several properties. In this case, if the landlord agreed, Friedman told him, the firm would accept all of the leases by the next day. \u201cTake it or leave it,\u201d Friedman said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s like the guys who play the Bond villain, and he plays the Bond villain better than anybody,\u201d another major mall landlord who sits opposite Friedman in negotiations like this told\nThe Real Deal.\n\u201cNot a lot of people want to do this job because they want to be liked.\u201d\n\u201cI holler a lot and tell them what they\u2019re going to be doing, and sometimes I get away with it.\u201d\nIvan Friedman\nThe next morning, the landlord called Friedman to accept the terms. The good news and the speed of its delivery stunned the private equity executive.\nFor the last two decades, about half of Friedman\u2019s career, the phones have been ringing in a world where the realities of retail are rapidly changing. The last few years have been particularly jarring. Foot traffic has dwindled at mid- and lower-tier malls, with 10 and 18-percent drops, respectively, compared to 2019, according to Placer.ai, which tracks consumer movement. Even one-time high-performing malls have fallen on hard times, landing in\nforeclosure\nand wiping out bondholders.\nThe king of the discounted mall lease isn\u2019t worried.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of years, and a lot of experience,\u201d he said. \u201cYou either get old and you benefit from the years, or you get old and die. And I ain\u2019t dying.\u201d\nH\nolding the line\nFriedman follows the retail industry like a sports team, so Claire\u2019s demise was no surprise. \u201cClaire\u2019s had been a mess for 10 years,\u201d he said. As Maryland-based private equity firm Ames Watson began circling the 64-year-old retailer, Friedman expected a call from co-founder Lawrence Berger, whom he\u2019s known for 15 years. Ames Watson\u2019s purchase would require saving several million dollars per year on rent across the U.S. portfolio.\nFriedman determined Ames Watson needed to keep at least 675 of Claire\u2019s roughly 1,300 U.S. locations for the deal to pencil. Then, Friedman swung into action. \u201cOnce we lock up a deal, Ivan has to go perform,\u201d Berger said.\nOver the next six weeks, Friedman and his team of 17 examined each individual Claire\u2019s lease, dialed the landlords and haggled.\nFriedman doesn\u2019t hire accomplished, successful negotiators. \u201cThey don\u2019t exist,\u201d he said. Instead, he brings on employees he can tell are \u201canxious for success, for money, to learn, and to become established.\u201d Negotiation is something you teach, Friedman said, often through fire.\n\u201cYou give someone 20 landlords and see how long it takes them to cry,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cAnd when they come back, because they were made to cry, they start asking the right questions. They start understanding that all landlords have the same stories of why what you\u2019re asking is too expensive and why they can\u2019t do it.\u201d\nFor the leases held by REITs such as Simon Property Group, Brookfield and Macerich, Friedman makes personal calls to top executives.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of \u2018Hey guy, here are the numbers, here is what I\u2019m going to need, and this is why I\u2019m going to need it, you\u2019re in or you\u2019re out,\u2019\u201d Friedman said. \u201cI holler a lot and tell them what they\u2019re going to be doing, and sometimes I get away with it.\u201d\nFriedman is adamant that the keys to his success are relatively banal: age, experience and relationships. Yet, he and his team have crafted creative ways to convince landlords to lower rents.\nSince Covid, percentage agreements, in which the landlord agrees to accept a lower base rent in exchange for a percentage of the store\u2019s sales revenue, have become more popular in shopping mall leases. The breakpoint percentage clause outlines the shape of this agreement, and sets the revenue threshold a store must reach before cutting the landlord in. For a retailer that spends $120,000 on annual rent, the landlord might set a breakpoint rate of 5 percent. This means that after $2.4 million in sales ($120,000 divided by 0.05), the landlord begins earning 5 percent of the store\u2019s revenue.\n\u201cI throw that out,\u201d Friedman said.\nIn that example, Friedman would instead aim to get the gross rent down to about 12 percent of total sales and then cut the landlord in on 12 percent of the sales revenue growth moving forward. These post-bankruptcy leases are often short-term, aimed at giving the retailer a chance to reset and begin growing the business again.\n\u201cI\u2019m selling them on the idea of keeping a long-term business that has value,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they want 18 to 20 percent of sales for rent, I can\u2019t grow. I\u2019m dead.\u201d\nMany in the industry respect his touch and gamesmanship. Still, Friedman knows his reputation: People have called him an animal, the enemy and the devil.\n\u201cBut that\u2019s probably because they lost the last transaction,\u201d the mall exec countered. In their small world, you\u2019re likely to\u00a0 encounter Friedman more than once, which helps the sides stay civil.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any landlord gets excited to hear from Ivan, but the reality is that it has to be done and he\u2019s a pretty rational person,\u201d Berger said.\nThis playbook worked for Claire\u2019s. When Ames Watson closed on its purchase in October, Friedman and RCS had successfully renegotiated more than 900 leases at heavy discounts.\nB\norn this way\nFriedman, now 84, is the child of Russian immigrants who came to Brooklyn in the early 20th century. The family lived above his father\u2019s shop, a women\u2019s clothing store in East New York, where Friedman began sweeping floors at age 5.\nAbout 1960, Friedman, not yet 20, opened his own ladies\u2019 clothing shop. An Army reservist, Friedman was briefly pulled back into active duty during the Cuban missile crisis. When he returned to New York, he expanded his business to \u201cfive or six stores,\u201d he said. Then, picking up the pace, he bought a department store chain with 150 locations in the late 1970s.\n\u201cHaving grown up in retail, there was nothing else for me to do besides the natural progression of opening up my own stores,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cImmigrant families are very much always focused on one thing, and don\u2019t always have the breadth of opening up to other possibilities.\u201d\nYet, he increasingly found the business exhausting, and as the 1980s approached, Friedman began looking for a way out.\u00a0 He found it in real estate.\nFriedman discovered he could make more money from selling off his brick-and-mortar leases than what the stores would earn over the next decade. \u201cThat business was worth more dead than alive,\u201d he said.\nFriedman didn\u2019t yet have a plan for his next chapter when General Electric Capital called later that year. An executive asked him to go down to Oklahoma on a semi-clandestine mission to gather information on the CEO of a retailer the company had invested in. Using his retail expertise, Friedman would operate as a \u201creal estate consultant,\u201d on behalf of General Electric.\n\u201cThen they said, \u2018While you\u2019re down there, maybe you can call some landlords and see if you could get some rent relief or something,\u2019\u201d Friedman said. \u201cI said, hmm, that could be a business. And it was.\u201d\nWord got around that Friedman was a worthy advisor, and he soon started hearing from more retail executives with real estate problems. He then founded RCS Real Estate Advisors.\n\u201cIvan and RCS have the power to say, \u2018We\u2019ll rip the lease up if you don\u2019t renegotiate.\u2019 And now we have the power to say, \u2018I\u2019ll take the space back,\u2019 especially in a market like this.\u201d\nanonymous mall executive\nUpon reflection, Friedman doesn\u2019t see too many other ways it all could have gone. He avoids grand conclusions about life or work. \u201cBusiness is business, life is life\u201d is a common Friedman-ism.\nIn life, he said he mostly avoids malls, except \u201cwhen my wife asks me to shop.\u201d\nBut business was the order of the day on a recent Thursday afternoon as he arrived at the entrance of Simon Property Group\u2019s Jersey Gardens Outlet Mall in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Friedman stepped out from the backseat of a black Lincoln Town Car and adjusted his Paul Stuart overcoat as he scanned the property. It\u2019s the state\u2019s largest indoor outlet mall, and Friedman\u2019s fingerprints are all over it. Of the 200 brands here, he\u2019s negotiated for 26 of them.\nFrom his coat pocket he took out a schematic of the mall\u2019s retail spaces, printed on two sheets of paper stapled together. Red lines mark the spaces of the retailers he has represented.\n\u201cYou judge a mall by how much business it does per square foot,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cShitty malls do $200 to 300 per [square foot].\u201d\nThis one does $930, roughly $1.2 billion per year, making it \u201cone of the better-performing malls, especially for an outlet,\u201d he said.\nInside, Friedman could barely walk 20 feet without pointing out former or current clients, Gap and Old Navy, Brooks Brothers, Ann Taylor Loft, True Religion and Vans. Eventually, he made it to Claire\u2019s.\n\u201cMy Claire\u2019s,\u201d he said.\nFriedman hesitates to talk specifics about his partners, deals, nemeses or numbers. But standing among his stores, he opened up, the storefronts surfacing war stories from the negotiation room. Friedman described Covid as \u201ca godsend\u201d for his company. His phone barely stopped ringing with brands desperate to renegotiate their leases. Yet, few contracts had contingencies for global pandemics, which meant many retailers found themselves stuck in closed malls.\n\u201cI called up David Simon and said, \u2018Don\u2019t give me this force majeure stuff,\u2019\u201d he recalled.\nInstead of going to court, he suggested an informal plan: \u201cFor the companies that aren\u2019t in trouble, how about we pay a month of rent, and then you pay a month. We share the pain.\u201d\nSimon eventually agreed.\nTouring the mall, Friedman seemed to sense that at least some of the brands he hadn\u2019t worked with yet would eventually call.\n\u201cThere will always be a supply of weaker companies,\u201d Friedman said \u2014 future customers.\nU\npper hand?\nMarket conditions used to give Friedman the clear advantage in lease negotiations. From the 1980s into the early 2000s, malls boomed, and landlords had to compete to retain tenants. Friedman could more easily predict the answer to the question: \u201cHey, do you want some rent or no rent?\u201d\nBut these are different times, as malls continue to close while demand for retail space climbs.\n\u201cThis has been described as probably the best two-year period of retail demand in the last decade,\u201d Vince Tibone, head of industrial and mall research at financial services firm Green Street, said. However, in this inverse reality where landlords have the power, quality is key.\nIn Class A malls \u2014 those that make more than $630 per square foot in revenue \u2014 occupancy has hovered near 95 percent in recent years. A November Green Street report showed Tanger\u2019s third-quarter occupancy rate at 98 percent; Simon Property Group\u2019s 96 percent occupancy is within a percentage point of its all-time high. For these landlords, a vacancy might be a chance to bring in a growing chain, like an Alo, Sephora or Everlane.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the circle of life,\u201d the mall exec said. \u201cIvan and RCS have the power to say, \u2018We\u2019ll rip the lease up if you don\u2019t renegotiate.\u2019 And now we have the power to say, \u2018I\u2019ll take the space back,\u2019 especially in a market like this.\u201d\n\u201cWe can say, \u2018Okay, give me my five best stores back, you can keep the five worst, and we make deals,\u2019\u201d the exec added. \u201cIf you want to give me 100,000 square feet back of Claire\u2019s, I can absorb that without being killed now, especially when I know I can re-lease it for higher.\u201d\nThe landlord said Friedman has an advantage over the mid- and lower-tier mom-and-pop mall owners who can\u2019t risk the expense of a vacancy. Between 2017 and 2022, an average of 40 malls per year shut down, and experts believe that trend is likely to continue among the weaker malls in the U.S.\nYet demand at the high end can mask underlying weakness. In October, a distressed debt fund\nseized\ncontrol of The Palisades Center in West Nyack, one of the largest malls in the country, leaving CMBS bondholders with a $231 million loss. It was only the second time AAA CMBS bondholders suffered losses since the financial crisis, Bloomberg reported. Meanwhile, the 1.5 million-square-foot San Francisco Centre, another Class A mall, is over 90 percent vacant, and AAA CMBS bondholders could also take losses on at least four other deals, according to a Barclays\u2019 report.\nRetail\u2019s been declared dead before, but Friedman believes that the industry will outlast turbulence as it always has, from department store consolidation in the 1990s, the Great Recession of 2008, the so-called retail apocalypse brought on by e-commerce in the mid 2010s and the 2020 pandemic.\nPeople, on the other hand, don\u2019t last forever. Friedman counts himself among a respected group of peers still working. He half jokingly compares himself to Mick Jagger and admires Vornado CEO Steven Roth, also 84. \u201cHe comes to work every single day.\u201d (He disagrees with Roth\u2019s decision to let his hair go gray. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in that.\u201d) Although he has a succession plan in place, Friedman has no plan to step away.\n\u201cIf I could move a coffin into my office so that I could die at my desk and they just wheel it over and drop me in, that would be fine,\u201d Friedman said.",

        "content": "Nick P\u00e9rez has a clear view of South Florida\u2019s condo market, especially the ultra-high-end segment. From September to early December of 2025, his family\u2019s Related Group sold $450 million worth of condos, with more to come. Between October 2025 and this coming March, Related and its partners are completing condo projects totaling 1,500 units, including the Crosby at Miami Worldcenter and Nomad Residences Wynwood.\nP\u00e9rez is president of the condo division at Related, where he and his brother, CEO\nJon Paul P\u00e9rez\n, have been taking on more leadership, though the Miami-based firm is still led by Nick\u2019s father, billionaire developer Jorge P\u00e9rez.\n\u201cThe strength is definitely in the ultra-luxury product,\u201d Nick P\u00e9rez said in an interview with\nThe Real Deal\n.\nWith partners, the firm is under construction at\nSix Fisher Island\nResidences, where buyers are paying an average price per foot of $4,000, high for preconstruction.\nBut he\u2019s also noticed that at cheaper, short-term-rental-friendly projects, developers are all fighting for the same buyer.\n\u201cTake a step down into the more affordable range, or once you\u2019re down in the range of $1,000 to $1,400 per square foot, that market is very saturated,\u201d P\u00e9rez said. That range includes Viceroy Residences, where\nTRD\nconducted this interview.\nSome developers are overleveraged and may fail, P\u00e9rez observed. But Related is pushing ahead with projects from Miami to West Palm Beach to Tampa, and holding onto a handful of sites with big plans, including one rumored to be a Ritz-Carlton-branded high-rise development in North Bay Village with Harry Macklowe\u2019s firm.\nIt\u2019s not 2008, when Related had to hand the keys over to its lenders on four condo projects.\nThe summer was slow, but an autumn boom emerged, thanks mostly to sales at three luxury waterfront condo projects: $70 million presold at Rivage Bal Harbour, which Related is co-developing with Two Roads Development; $80 million at the Ritz-Carlton Residences, West Palm Beach (with BH Group); and $100 million presold at the St. Regis Residences Miami, with partner Integra Investments.\nBaccarat Residences, a 75-story, 355-unit tower that\u2019s under construction in Miami\u2019s Brickell in the same complex as Viceroy, has fewer than 10 units left, P\u00e9rez said, though sales launched in 2021.\nHere\u2019s what else Nick had to say about the market and the firm\u2019s pipeline.\nThe interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\nTell me about 2025.\nIt was kind of a roller-coaster year. We had a new U.S. president, which the industry was super excited about. There was certainty on where we were going. Then Liberation Day came and the stock market took a tank. That caused a ton of\nuncertainty\n, not only in the real estate market, but in investment decisions across private equity, across data, every industry. Because uncertainty kills all investments. You don\u2019t know how to invest without knowing you know what your cost of goods is going to be. Are you going to hire? Are you going to fire? This summer was not a great summer, but come Sept. 1 there was some calm in the market. Interest rates have gone down, which has helped but still not enough.\nThere\u2019s still a lot of money on the sidelines waiting for further rate cuts.\nIs the Mamdani effect [of New Yorkers migrating to Southern Florida] overhyped?\nThis happens every time. Trump gets elected, some people think the world\u2019s going to end. Or Biden got elected, people think the world\u2019s going to end. Or when Mamdani got elected, New York\u2019s \u201cgone forever.\u201d Developers are talking with Mamdani. There\u2019s always a little bit of\noverhype\nbecause of, again, the uncertainty.\nYes, there\u2019s been more interest, more calls, more web leads, more form fills. But it hasn\u2019t been the rush that everyone has [predicted].\nThere is so much competition in lower price points. How do you stand out?\nBetween Miami-Dade and Broward, 144 projects have been announced. The vast majority are [like the Viceroy Residences]. But they don\u2019t have this location that we have [riverfront in Brickell], but it\u2019s that type of unit, size and price point.\nMiami has become extremely expensive. We\u2019re selling Icon Beach right now at $1,200, $1,300 [per square] foot in Hollywood. Six years ago, we sold out Hyde Beach House at $670 a foot. Prices have grown astronomically. Wages have not followed, and especially South American wages; and the dollar is strong. So, the purchasing power of South Americans has not kept up with the price appreciation that\u2019s happened in the market.\nAre you holding back on launching projects?\nWe are preparing, going through the design process, and getting all of our marketing material ready on a lot of jobs. Our Aventura multifamily site, we\u2019re going through the design process to get all the materials ready.\nNorth Bay Village\n, we cleared the site, we are going through the design process and getting through the marketing materials. That takes eight to 10 months.\nBird Road, which we bought with 13th Floor Investments, is another one, we think with product type, location, price entry point, young families. That one we\u2019re branding in a unique way, which we\u2019ll get to later next year. But that is going to have an entry point, about $1,200, $1,300 a [square] foot. It\u2019s right by the metro, in between Coconut Grove and Coral Gables.\nWe are getting all those ready \u2014 and watching the market.\nAre you expecting a price correction?\nPrice increases will be difficult. I don\u2019t think there will be a decrease. Immigration is starting to take effect on some labor issues. We haven\u2019t seen it but we\u2019re hearing labor is hard to come by. Construction costs, we haven\u2019t seen them spike a lot but it\u2019s starting to trickle in as we\u2019re pricing new jobs. There\u2019s no way someone can build cheaper in two years than they can today. The only thing that can adjust is owners\u2019 expectations of the value of the land. That\u2019s really hard to change also. You will see some people get in trouble for overpaying and realize how expensive it is to build.\nAre you offering incentives to sell condos?\nYes, they\u2019re definitely in the market. A lot of those are not very wide blasted. Once word gets out, then everyone else starts doing it.\nAre you looking at picking up stalled project sites?\nNot actively. We have enough. Maybe those buyers, if their projects don\u2019t come through, they come to our projects.\nI won\u2019t tell you where but we gobbled up a bunch of units in a condo to create a blocking position in case someone comes in. We\u2019re planting seeds for the next big run.\nNewly elected Miami Mayor Eileen Higgins campaigned on increasing affordable housing, restoring trust to City Hall and improving permitting issues. What policies or incentives would help create more affordable housing?\nAffordability is the biggest issue. People are spending over 50 percent of their income on rent, when the norm used to be 30 percent. It\u2019s not going to change overnight, but that has to change. We have the right mayor that was elected by the city of Miami to try.\nMayor Higgins was instrumental within the county in promoting affordable housing. She was probably one of our biggest cheerleaders. The county has massive amounts of land, so they\u2019re able to do affordable housing by executing 99-year ground leases to the developer.

        "content": "I\nn California, there\u2019s Irvine Company, owned by the country\u2019s richest developer, and there\u2019s everyone else.\nBut calling FivePoint Holdings an also-ran doesn\u2019t convey the importance of what the land developer has done \u2014 or could do \u2014 in the state. The coastal California master-planned communities developer, connected to deep-pocketed Lennar, has delivered thousands of homes in a state that is underbuilt by millions, and managed to turn a profit.\nNew megadevelopments are rare in sought-after parts of the Golden State, but the company has three: one in Orange County, one in Los Angeles County and a third in San Francisco, with 12,500 homesites completed so far. All together, they plan to deliver 40,000 homes and 23 million square feet of commercial space. FivePoint began to develop the first two, Great Park Neighborhoods and Valencia, under singularly difficult conditions, including lender bankruptcies, municipal bait-and-switches, community resistance and \u2014 this being California \u2014 battles over native fish and carbon emissions.\nNonetheless, the developer has recently sold sites at Great Park, the Orange County community, for about\n$10 million an acre\n, much more than their pre-2020 price.\nBut if Great Park and Valencia, the L.A. community, seemed feasible only to the kind of developer who could pull off the hardest stuff, the difficulty of developing FivePoint\u2019s San Francisco project, called Candlestick and The San Francisco Shipyard, veered toward impossible.\nIn 1999, San Francisco named Lennar the master developer of the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, which the Navy had used to decontaminate ships after nuclear tests. A decade earlier, the Environmental Protection Agency declared the area a Superfund site, and the Navy hired a firm called Tetra Tech to investigate, test and remediate much of the land in advance of handing it over to the developer. In the meantime, two things happened: In 2006, Lennar won development rights to the nearby Candlestick, once home to the San Francisco 49ers and Giants, and in 2009, Lennar spun out FivePoint to make the latter a focused land developer (or perhaps to satisfy a promising executive who may have wanted his own domain). Little went as planned. In 2014, it came out that Tetra Tech employees had falsified soil samples, swapping in clean dirt for contaminated in tests. Criminal and civil lawsuits dogged the remediator, and the development site, for years. Several, including one with FivePoint, are still winding their way through the courts. Two Tetra Tech employees were sentenced to federal prison in 2018 after pleading guilty.\nThe saga seemed to change FivePoint, which in 2022 installed a tight-lipped, Irvine Company-trained operator named Daniel Hedigan in place of its original chief executive, Emile Haddad, known industry-wide as a creative visionary not overly concerned with stock prices. The macro environment was changing too. Interest rates shot up, making financing more difficult, even as California\u2019s politicians finally came around to the idea that the state had to build more places to live. Per a state requirement, San Francisco is supposed to add 82,000 new homes by 2031. Together, FivePoint\u2019s Candlestick and Shipyard \u2014 neighboring peninsulas jutting out into the San Francisco Bay \u2014 could deliver 12,000, or 15 percent.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s there to do? Nothing really.\u201d\na Shipyard resident, where about 450 of a planned 12,000 homes have been built\nIn late 2024 came a sign that development could proceed.\nThe San Francisco Board of Supervisors granted approvals to transfer approximately 2 million square feet of the Shipyard\u2019s entitlements to Candlestick for research and development and office space. While this doesn\u2019t solve the problem of the Shipyard or its soil, it does mean that FivePoint will be able to develop land for\na little more than half the housing\nit originally planned \u2014 about 7,000 homes \u2014 if it can find the funding after all this time.\nThe San Francisco project could cost \u201chundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars, to develop,\u201d according to Walker &amp; Dunlop analyst Alan Ratner. And that\u2019s if the company can nab a partner at attractive terms.\nIf not, \u201cthe asset becomes worthless,\u201d Ratner said.\nFivePoint declined to make Hedigan or Haddad available for an interview. Lennar declined to participate.\nD\none it before\nGreat Park Neighborhoods, in Irvine, is among the best master-planned communities in the country, according to John Burns, who runs a research and consulting firm. Homes are modern and very uniform; residents report on Reddit that kids run around and families like the amenities, though some say landscaping is more sterile than in other Irvine developments. Either way, there are few other choices for buyers who want new builds. Valencia, in the Santa Clarita Valley, is the kind of place that began to do well during the pandemic as millennials simultaneously had kids and secured hybrid jobs that made the hourlong commute down the 5 freeway to L.A. proper tolerable. Valencia sells them angular townhomes, duplexes and single-family homes with model names like \u201cWren\u201d and \u201cSkylar\u201d for upwards of $800,000.\nGreat Park came into being after Lennar won an auction to buy the former El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in Irvine in 2005,\npaying\n$650 million for the ex-military base. In 2008, its lender, Lehman Brothers, declared bankruptcy, kicking off the global financial crisis. Development stalled until FivePoint, post-Lennar spin-off, landed\nfresh financing\nthree years later.\nHere, too, there was contamination from the military, but after a Navy cleanup, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took the majority of El Toro off the Superfund site list in 2014.\nThere were other problems. When Lennar purchased the land, it had transferred more than 1,000 acres to the city of Irvine and paid hundreds of millions of dollars in development fees. The idea was that the city would build a world-class park, and the development\u2019s homes and businesses would surround it. But the city\nspent\nmost of the $200 million Lennar paid without making much progress. By the time FivePoint took over the project, it had to figure out how to extend a private-public partnership and wrangle an agreement allowing the company to develop a scaled-back park and to double the number of homes planned.\nFivePoint made its first land sales that year, but a\nbattle\nover a cemetery tempered the victory. The city promised a veterans cemetery in the park, but Haddad, concerned about how a cemetery would be perceived by million-dollar buyers, proposed another location. The back and forth went on for a decade.\nBut development continued, and 9,400 homesites have now been sold to builders, including Lennar, as of September 2025. The homebuilders have sold 7,300 homes, and FivePoint is eyeing entitlements for more sites.\nThe road to Valencia wasn\u2019t any easier. A 2015 California Supreme Court decision required an amended analysis of the development\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and measures to protect the unarmored threespine stickleback fish, following uproar from environmental groups. In 2016, FivePoint filed an updated environmental review for the Santa Clarita Valley development, then called Newhall Ranch, which deemed the development net zero \u2014 no emissions ever. A year later, the developer reached a settlement to provide $25 million for conservation efforts and received reapprovals from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Builders have picked up about 3,100 homesites and sold nearly 1,800 to buyers as of the third quarter of 2025, according to quarterly filings.\nBut land sales have slowed while builders wait for buyers to be able to afford new homes and interest rates to ease. FivePoint has not sold any land at Valencia in about a year but said in its most recent quarterly report that it is \u201cworking with builders on two residential land sales that are expected to close in 2026.\u201d\nT\nhe missing element\nFifteen years ago, Newsom, then mayor of San Francisco, wearing a suit and signature blue tie, his hair only beginning to grey, held a press conference.\nHe signed 12 pieces of legislation to greenlight the second phase of what he said would be the largest redevelopment project in San Francisco\u2019s history \u2014 the future Shipyard and Candlestick.\nHe pitched the project well enough for at least one member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, Sophie Maxwell, to actually thank the private homebuilder at the press conference.\n\u201cI know that\u2019s the boogeyman,\u201d Maxwell said, \u201cbut I still want to thank Lennar for hanging in there with us.\u201d\nNewsom continued to beat the housing drum, and when he campaigned for governor in 2017, he promised to shepherd the addition of 3.5 million homes.\nIt made sense that Lennar and FivePoint, firms able to turn less-than-desirable land into thousands of homes, would be allies of politicians with even a slightly YIMBY bent. That\u2019s especially true in San Francisco, which is now so short of housing goals that the state could invoke a punishment called builder\u2019s remedy.\nInstead of its mandated 82,000 new units by 2031, the city\u2019s Family Zoning Plan is likely to deliver only half that, and in twice the time, according to a recent report by local economist Ted Egan. A group called the California Housing Defense Fund, which sues municipalities over noncompliant zoning, has already threatened legal action against the City of San Francisco, which could force the issue.\n\u201cThis is a pure play California strategy.\u201d\nStuart Miller, Lennar CEO, on the FivePoint spin-off\nIf triggered, builder\u2019s remedy would automatically allow some development proposals, even if they surpass local height limits or threaten rent-controlled units, essentially neutering local zoning power.\nMeanwhile, Newsom\u2019s second and final term is near an end, and there are nowhere near 3.5 million new places to live. (In 2022, running for reelection, he walked the number back to 2.5 million by 2030.) Just 650,000 new homes were permitted in the state between 2019, when he took office, and 2023, according to the San Francisco Chronicle\u2019s late 2024\nreporting\n.\nIn the same period, many developers and investors left rather than take on the feat that is building in California. That includes the country\u2019s fourth-largest apartment developer, Wood Partners, which in 2024 announced it was no longer pursuing new development projects in the state.\nA\nnew leader\nBut FivePoint pushes on in California, thanks to two sharply different personalities who have led the way through the development gauntlet.\nThe first was Emile Haddad, who came to the United States from Lebanon at age 27, following the civil war.\nThe war \u201cleft a scar \u2014 a scar of seeing communities being torn apart, families torn apart, friends torn apart,\u201d he once told a group of University of Southern California students. \u201cI started realizing that really what I have is a passion for building communities.\u201d\nHe started at Lennar in 1996.\nHaddad looked to Lennar CEO and executive chairman Stuart Miller as a mentor, a person familiar with the company said. Miller, who is also executive chairman at FivePoint, took a chance on Haddad, who rose through the ranks to chief investment officer. The two had an almost father-son relationship, though they sometimes clashed, the source said.\nAt $14, FivePoint\u2019s opening share price was below the expected range. On the first day of trading, Lennar purchased $100 million worth of shares. Lennar still owns a 40 percent share in its spin-off.\nBut FivePoint wasn\u2019t trying to be a national leader like Lennar, and Haddad\u2019s calling appeared to be on the ground in California, building alliances, wooing the press and bolstering his defenses against naysayers. Lennar\u2019s Miller may have seen that as an opportunity.\n\u201cThis is a pure play California strategy,\u201d Miller said the day of the IPO.\nAnd Haddad was all in from the start. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled,\u201d he said when Lennar outbid others on what would become Great Park. In 2011, he got financing for the stalled development in a tight lending environment. \u201cIt is very unusual in today\u2019s world to be talking about a project of this magnitude as one that is moving forward,\u201d Haddad said at a press conference then. He innovated on marketing, selling a lifestyle \u201cbefore it was a thing,\u201d a source familiar with the firm said.\nAfter the city of Irvine spent the Lennar money meant for a new park, Haddad had to win over the five-person city council on a new plan. FivePoint would develop the park in exchange for the right to sell more homesites. During a 10-minute break before the vote, in 2013, he walked to a private council room to offer some last-minute concessions, the OC Register reported. The vote, at 1:48 a.m., gave FivePoint most of what it needed. Haddad felt \u201cexcited and relieved,\u201d he said, \u201cand now I just want to go get some sleep.\u201d\nStill, over time FivePoint\u2019s board soured on Haddad. They felt he cared more about vision rather than selling land at a premium, the person familiar with the company said. In came Hedigan, an Irvine Company alum and an attorney, though Haddad remained on the board and is an advisor.\nHedigan oversaw the crucial shift of entitlements from Shipyard to Candlestick, beginning in 2023 when he said on an earnings call that the company had initiated the process to \u201cobtain an approvable plan that rebalances the current development entitlements,\u201d or the right to keep going on Candlestick while while the Shipyard remains stalled.\nCandlestick would become a \u201cstandalone development,\u201d he said, later adding in a 2024 earnings call that the approvals would serve \u201cas a catalyst for advancing conversations\u201d with potential partners. The approvals came November that year. Still, the company\u2019s shares are trading at about $6 lately, compared to about $15 at the end of the day it went public, and shareholders have all but written off the San Francisco project.\nT\nhe parcel that could\nThere was one piece of the Shipyard whose remediation went smoothly, about 70 acres on the tip of Hunters Point. The Navy had handed it to San Francisco all the way back in 2004, before the project\u2019s troubles began. In 2005, San Francisco conveyed the parcel, known as Parcel A, to Lennar, who fought its usual fight \u2014 securing approvals, negotiating land deals, and battling complaints and concerns about gentrification\u2014 before breaking ground in 2013.\nLennar never transferred Parcel A to FivePoint and itself built hundreds of homes. \u201cIt will be the next full neighborhood in San Francisco,\u201d a Lennar executive said in 2014. \u201cAlmost a city within a city.\u201d\nThe first 88 townhomes sold out in early 2015, a sign that even once-toxic sites could spur demand if they could get to the finish line.\nAll the while, Candlestick was undergoing demolition \u2014 and in Southern California, Great Park was\nbeginning\nto bloom, and Valencia was getting closer to take-off.\nBut at the Shipyard, everything outside of Parcel A was frozen. Though Lennar eventually delivered 450 townhomes and condos, the skeleton crew who moved in never felt like they lived in a flourishing master-planned urban community (there\u2019s not even a grocery store yet), though they were grateful for the neighborhood\u2019s affordability.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s there to do? Nothing really,\u201d one resident told the San Francisco Standard in 2024, conceding that he wasn\u2019t bothered by the quiet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not very walkable,\u201d another said to the same reporter. \u201cIf you want to go out to dinner, you\u2019re driving.\u201d\nHomes still for sale at Lennar\u2019s Shipyard are asking for as low as $400,000. Listings describe them as in a prime location directly on the San Francisco Bay. Four are move-in ready, two are labeled \u201cfuture release.\u201d\nS\ntaying relevant\nCandlestick could finally break ground this year, though on the adjacent peninsula. FivePoint now has to solidify its financing in a very different world.\nSan Francisco\u2019s Office of Community Investment and Infrastructure head told the San Francisco Business Times in 2024 that FivePoint informed him it had the funds on hand to break ground. The company does have $350 million cash on its balance sheet and access to another $217.5 million revolving credit facility, according to filings. That, plus Great Park Neighborhoods revenues could fund early development of Candlestick, and perhaps the firm can pace itself there until it has more clarity on when it\u2019ll actually get some or all of Shipyard from the Navy, according to Robert Rulla, a Fitch Ratings analyst.\nWhen it does need more capital, a pipeline of sites at Candlestick could provide more collateral to a lender. During recent earnings calls, Hedigan has changed his wording from saying the company continues to \u201cexplore opportunities to bring in a strategic partner or other capital sources\u201d to a slightly looser phrasing: The company \u201cremains engaged with potential capital sources to advance development,\u201d he said in the latest earnings call in October, reporting third-quarter 2025 results. Other firms on the West Coast that already have entitlements can\u2019t finance them, a knowledgeable insider said.\nThere will be plenty of time to engage lenders. Although cases concerning the botched cleanup could finally head to trial early this year, the Navy doesn\u2019t expect to transfer the Shipyard land until at least 2036, according to an agreement between San Francisco and the developer.\nWill California have solved the housing crisis by then? Will demand for San Francisco living persuade homebuyers to try these twin peninsulas?\nIf FivePoint finishes Candlestick and Shipyard, it may owe its success to Hedigan, who\u2019s kept the developer\u2019s reputation for doing hard things, even if the market doesn\u2019t have the patience for his timeline. But to bring them to life, the company could do well to heed the advice from its ex-CEO\u2019s 2012 TED Talk, about relevance.\n\u201cWe cannot survive unless we\u2019re relevant,\u201d Haddad said.",

        "content": "Multifamily syndication is an unlikely corner of real estate for a guy like Jon Venetos.\nInvestors who adopted the pooled-equity model of multifamily acquisition have a reputation. They\u2019re snake-oil salesmen for passive income, spreading the gospel of the value-add proposition to lawyers and doctors on LinkedIn: Give us money, and we\u2019ll buy old apartments, fix them up, raise the rents, sell the properties and get you an easy profit.\nMany syndicators got into the game when they were young and inexperienced. Take Sean Kia, who co-founded Tides Equities in 2016 at the age of 25. His work spawned headlines like Entrepreneur\u2019s \u201cThis 31-Year-Old Investor Nearly Quadrupled His Multifamily Housing Empire From California to Texas in Just 3 Years.\u201d\nWithin nine months of that story, Kia and his partner Ryan Andrade were begging investors for more cash. The foreclosures ramped up in 2024 as Tides\u2019 shabby apartment assets deteriorated. Then, lenders started pursuing the pair down for the loans they personally guaranteed.\nThe unraveling of Tides was the canary in the coal mine for aggressive multifamily investors and syndicators. The wave of distress then buffeted Alan Stalcup\u2019s GVA and Jay Gajavelli\u2019s Applesway Investment Group.\nVenetoses opened Lurin Capital the same year as Tides. The value proposition was similar, but the guy in charge seemed different.\nVenetos and his wife, Ashley, came up at prestigious banks and hedge funds. After launching at Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank, Jon joined Citadel in 2006, rising to head of one of the fund\u2019s stock-picking units, Surveyor Capital. Ashley did investor relations at Bill Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square.\nThe pair enjoyed the fruits of their finance paychecks, buying two penthouses in a five-story building at 87 Mercer Street in Soho. They combined the units and tapped Tony Ingrao to remodel them into a luxurious 6,700-square-foot pad, complete with a multi-level rooftop whose hot tub installation required a crane. They again hired Ingrao to design a shingled Hamptons mansion for the 2.3-acre tract they bought in Sagaponack in 2013.\nBut in 2016, a purge at Surveyor \u2014 whose primary funds tumbled at the beginning of the year \u2014 included Jon. He took a sharp turn, listing the penthouse, selling the 12,000-square-foot Hamptons estate for $15.8 million, moving to Dallas and pivoting to real estate.\n\u201cI saw a really inefficient market in real estate, specifically in the multifamily space,\u201d Venetos said on the Real Crowd Podcast in October 2022, the only time he\u2019s spoken publicly.\nHe thought he could professionalize the niche, introducing best practices from the big dogs on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \u201cThere was a significant amount of what we could define in the fundamental equity business as \u2018alpha,\u2019\u201d he said.\nThis thesis formed the basis of his multifamily portfolio, which peaked at 10,000 apartment units in 19 markets across five states.\nPlus, he had a family advantage: The Venetoses had been investing in apartments in Chicago for decades, he said.\nBut neither pedigree nor legacy were enough to save him, and it was just a matter of time before he met the same fate as his contemporaries. In the fall of 2025 came a\ncrush\nof foreclosures, default lawsuits and receivership appointments. In the hunt for money still owed to lenders and limited partners, suggestions of fraudulent dealings surfaced.\nLenders were suing on a near-daily basis by early December. Lurin Capital\u2019s mounting legal trouble started to hint of more than mismanagement or bad timing: One lawsuit accused Venetos of falsifying documents to lenders; another accused him of pocketing loan proceeds while in default. That\u2019s when former employees started coming out of the woodwork with claims that fraud was part of Lurin\u2019s operation \u2014 not just a symptom of distress.\nThat fits with trends loan servicers have tracked, according to Trimont\u2019s Rob Walton. Fraud is prevalent in Class C Texas multifamily \u201cin a way I didn\u2019t ever expect to see,\u201d he said at a multifamily conference in Dallas in August.\nIt is unclear where the Venetos are; the family moved to an Aspen mansion for a while this fall before lenders sued to foreclose on that property too. Venetos did not agree to be interviewed for the story or comment on the claims. Lurin and Venetos have denied claims made in lawsuits by their lenders.\nD\nown to Dallas\nThe Venetoses swapped their posh New York life for the large-format stateliness of Dallas\u2019 well-heeled.\nJon and Ashley moved to Highland Park, the neighborhood where Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones lives.\nThey bought the Italianate Craftsman at 4001 Miramar Avenue in 2021, a few months after the nearly 6,000-square-foot tan brick home got a glowing profile in local real estate blog Candy\u2019s Dirt. Built in 1920 for a Waco cotton merchant, it\u2019s framed by mature trees that shade the backyard and pool on an almost half-acre lot.\nThe mansion is also a block from the Dallas Country Club, and Ashley embraced the role of Highland Park wife, making multiple appearances in the Lone Star State\u2019s society rag, Paper City.\n\u201cJust give me my damn K1 and I can write this off.\u201d\nReddit user who claimed to have invested in Lurin and is ready to count their losses\nIn October 2024, she was photographed at the grand finale of Two x Two for AIDS and Art Gala, a storied Dallas fete that has drawn celebs like Alan Cumming, Natasha Richardson and Sigourney Weaver during its two-decade run. She cut a chic figure in a white skirt and cropped short-sleeve jacket, bracelets piled past her wrist; guests drank Dom Perignon and ate a four-course meal that included Regiis Ova ossetra caviar, per Culture Map.\nMeanwhile, Jon wasted no time building his multifamily empire.\nLurin launched four funds between June 2016 and January 2017, Securities and Exchange filings show. The first fund didn\u2019t have a capped offering, but the second fund offered $3 million and sold $2.98 million. The third offered $7 million and sold $6.95 million. The fourth fund sold $4.8 million of its $5 million offering. The minimum investment in the Lurin funds ranged from $5,000 to $10,000.\nIn December 2018, he signed an office lease at Rosewood Court at 2101 Cedar Springs Road, a prestigious office address in Uptown, across the street from the Crescent, the mixed-use development that anchors the sought-after neighborhood.\nFrom 2016 on, he bought a few apartment complexes in the Sun Belt each year. Purchasing ramped up in 2021 and 2022. The priciest was The Delmar, a 689-unit waterfront apartment building in Tampa that he picked up for $132.8 million in 2022. The acquisition seemed to announce that Lurin had moved into a bigger sandbox, capable of managing assets that were bigger and more centrally located than prior purchases, like The Beacon, a 223-unit complex in Huntsville, Alabama, which Lurin snapped up for $15.8 million in 2021.\nThe local business world took notice. Lurin Capital came in seventh on the annual list of fastest-growing small private companies in North Texas conducted by Southern Methodist University\u2019s Cox School of Business. The list is based on percentage growth and absolute dollar growth.\nT\nhe Venetos playbook\nLike fellow syndicators, Venetos focused on buying rental properties built after 1970 in high-growth markets. Unlike his peers, the cornerstone of the Venetos approach was rate caps.\nWhen syndicators were sweeping through Texas and picking up apartment complexes, interest rates were low. Some syndicators seemed to think they\u2019d always be. But this wasn\u2019t Venetos\u2019 first rodeo. He sensed rates would come back up again, and he paid to protect himself from that inevitability.\nDocuments provided by a former employee show that Lurin spent between 0.54 and 0.59 percent of the loan value on rate caps for three properties the firm purchased in Alabama in April 2021. The cost of rate caps quickly shot up when rates started increasing: Lurin bought a rate cap that cost more than 2.3 percent of the loan tied to a fourth Alabama property purchased in June 2022. The four caps in question cost between $76,000 and $406,000, including a $6,000 rate cap broker fee for each. They were attached to loans whose values ranged from $12.8 million to $21.8 million.\n\u201cWe have a deal where we paid sub $300,000 for interest rate cap. Today that\u2019s worth $4 million,\u201d he said in the 2022 podcast interview.\nVenetos\u2019 playbook also involved reducing exposure to external cost drivers like inflation by keeping things in the family. The Lurin Capital umbrella includes Lurin\u2019s in-house property management company Steward + Helm (which rebranded in 2024), Lurin Construction Services, Lurin Construction Management and Integrated Solutions and Integrated Renovations, two Lurin-owned companies that perform repairs, like roofing and unit upgrades.\nVenetos doesn\u2019t come off as braggadocious in the one-hour episode, but he gives the impression of an outsider who knows he\u2019s the expert.\nHe was \u201csuper surprised to hear\u201d that data-driven decision-making \u201cwas an exception rather than a rule\u201d in real estate, he said to the host. Government didn\u2019t have the answers. \u201cI think the Fed will overshoot and cause a deeper recession,\u201d he said.\nC\nrash out\nThe rapid interest rate hikes starting in 2022 proved a fatal blow for multifamily syndicators who took out floating rate debt and didn\u2019t have rate caps.\nDebt service payments ballooned. Construction costs soared. Outfits like Tides Equities and GVA effectively lost everything.\nVenetos held on longer, thanks to the rate cap play.\nBut three years later, problems hit in quick succession.\nIn April, lender Acore Capital Mortgage said Lurin defaulted on $384 million in loans tied to 12 properties in the Florida panhandle. The lender started auctioning off those properties in the spring and went after Venetos for what was left, claiming he\u2019d personally guaranteed the loans and still owed $81 million.\nBy fall, Lurin\u2019s lenders were in various stages of wresting control of Lurin properties and trying to get Venetos to pay what he still owed. Fannie Mae sued Venetos in November for defaulting on a $77.2 million loan tied to a Houston apartment complex and asked the court to appoint a receiver, claiming the conditions \u201cpresent immediate danger to tenants.\u201d Keybank did the same, claiming in a lawsuit that Lurin defaulted on $24 million in loans tied to two Dallas properties. In its lawsuit, Vista Bank alleged that he still owed $3 million after the lender took back a Lurin property at a foreclosure sale. A lender from Luxembourg, Select Securities Europe, sued Lurin, claiming it defaulted on 15 loans totaling $40.5 million.\nAll told, at least five lenders accused Lurin of defaulting on $710 million in loans tied to Sun Belt properties.\nA December lawsuit from Lurin\u2019s office landlord lays out a similar timeline.\nLurin missed a rent payment in October 2024 but caught up after two notices of default in November, landlord Rosewood Property Company wrote in a lawsuit. Lurin\u2019s last rent payment was made in May 2025. Rosewood terminated the lease in October and ordered the company to vacate, which it did in November.\nBy the end of six months, more than half of Lurin\u2019s holdings were in foreclosure proceedings or had already been handed back to lenders.\nLurin\u2019s remaining properties are mostly in receivership or foreclosure proceedings. Local municipalities have gotten involved after complaints about the decrepit state of the complexes.\nA Collin County judge on Oct. 27 issued a temporary restraining order on behalf of the city of Plano against Lurin and ordered residents of Evana Grove Apartments, an apartment complex there, to evacuate, deeming the property \u201cuninhabitable.\u201d\nThe property had racked up nearly 1,500 code violations. At the time the order was issued, residents did not have access to water, sewer or gas at the apartment complex. City official Curtis Howard called it \u201cthe worst apartment complex we have in the city of Plano.\u201d\nThis reality was starkly different from Venetos\u2019s take in 2022, when he critiqued the real estate world for not valuing human capital.\n\u201cThe people who operate your property, the people who support your properties, the people who reside in your property, the community, are all paramount to your success of that asset,\u201d he said in the same podcast interview.\nNow, it\u2019s the same groups \u2014 investors, tenants and employees \u2014 suffering most from his collapse.\n\u201cI have accepted that we as investors are totally screwed, there won\u2019t be any scraps after the banks and attorneys get whatever is left. Just give me my damn K1 and I can write this off,\u201d one Reddit user wrote on a thread about Lurin.\nDispatches from current and former residents of former Lurin properties paint a grisly picture of what can happen when value-add multifamily investors have financial trouble.\nAlondra Mendoza has lived at Estancia Estates, an apartment complex at 2222 Graycliff Drive in Dallas, for 15 years. The place was recently taken over by Dallas-based Indio Management, but during Lurin\u2019s tenure, work orders went unanswered.\n\u201cMy dad would fix everything at home,\u201d she said. When the building had a plumbing issue, Mendoza\u2019s family and her upstairs neighbor forked over $1,000 each to fix it, since Lurin wouldn\u2019t, she claimed.\nRegina Carruth, a resident of the Declan, at 1615 John West Road in Dallas, under Lurin\u2019s ownership, said the property fell into such disarray that \u201csquatters were coming in, kicking into empty apartments and staying in there.\u201d Her air conditioning didn\u2019t work for two months during the summer of 2023, the third-hottest summer in Dallas-Fort Worth on record.\n\u201cIt was just horrible,\u201d she said.\nThings got worse when Lurin stopped paying vendors altogether. Trash was an issue. At Estancia Estates, Mendoza said the dumpster was overflowing to the extent that \u201cthe trash took up half of the street.\u201d\nI\nnner workings\nOne investor surmised that Lurin didn\u2019t repurchase rate caps after they expired in 2023 and 2024, \u201cwhich made many of their properties [go] to a 3-4x higher rate, making things go to sh*t and belly up,\u201d per a Reddit post.\nBut lender lawsuits provide a first glimpse of something worse.\nKeybank alleged Venetos transferred $24,570 from his accounts with the bank to a personal account. Vista accused him of falsifying account statements from the lender in an attempt to take out loans elsewhere.\nEmployees say the fraud went deeper.\nA former employee who worked in property management and asked to remain anonymous claimed Lurin lied on reimbursement requests to lenders by inflating costs of repairs and submitting invoices for work that wasn\u2019t done. That meant Venetos could access new tranches of money before he\u2019d reached the thresholds in his renovations when they were supposed to be disbursed.\nIn an email sent after an inspection of The Sutton in Alabama, a lender rep picked up on the problem. \u201cNone of the units inspected are 100% complete as requested in the draw,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe roofing line item is 97% drawn with no work completed or materials on site.\u201d\n\u201cUninhabitable.\u201d\nA Collin County judge ordering residents of Evana Grove Apartments, a Lurin property in Plano, Texas, to evacuate\nThe lender also points out dramatic inconsistencies between the value of repairs and what was invoiced to complete the work: \u201cFor example the parking lot on the LURIN pay app is valued at ~52K and is 100% drawn while the Integrated Solutions deposit invoice values parking lot work at $210K\u201d \u2014 meaning Lurin budgeted $52,000 for the repair on an application and certification document, but submitted an invoice to its lender for $210,000. Integrated Solutions is Lurin\u2019s in-house renovations company.\n\u201cThe LURIN schedule of values need to line up with the contracts you have in place,\u201d the lender wrote.\nReal estate owners often create their own property management and construction companies to do the work at properties they own \u2014 in that, Lurin wasn\u2019t unusual.\nAt best, the coziness of these entities simply means they\u2019re fully integrated. But at worse, it means that operators can move money from an operating firm to a property management firm with little oversight.\nVenetos didn\u2019t just mislead lenders, employees claim.\nTwo former employees said Lurin stopped being eligible to offer a 401(k) plan to employees this fall but never informed employees. They provided documentation that shows their 401(k) contributions were withdrawn from their paychecks in November but not deposited into their Fidelity-managed 401(k) accounts.\nC\nonundrum Valley\nWhen things started going south, the Venetoses went north and west \u2014 to Aspen.\nThe family moved to a 4,882-square-foot manse, at 82 Winding Way Road, which they bought in April 2022. It\u2019s billed as a \u201cluxury estate compound in the Conundrum Valley,\u201d an apt location for the Dallas refugees. The blocky home, covered in reclaimed vintage barnwood, looks more like an angular office building. They bought the house and an adjacent 7.6 acres for $18 million.\nIn a Dec. 22 response to the lawsuit brought by Keybank, Venetos confirmed he and Ashley are living in Colorado, but little has emerged about what they are doing there.\nThe house\u2019s lender foreclosed in December, and it\u2019s not clear where the Venetoses are living now. A recent legal document identified a Venetos-backed LLC as having an address at 625 East Main Street, Suite 102, in Aspen.\nThe couple also finally sold their Soho penthouse \u2014 the traditional way, though below asking. The new buyer paid $17.4 million, less than a quarter of the $81 million judgment Acore is seeking. The penthouse was first listed in 2017, long before the Lurin collapse, for $29.9 million.\nMeanwhile, Lurin is fighting the default lawsuits on its remaining properties. The firm denies allegations made by Fannie Mae, claiming the lender interfered in the management of the property and forced Lurin to miss a loan payment \u201cwhich created a domino effect from which Lurin could not possibly recover.\u201d\nLurin has hung onto a few properties, like Valley Estates, at 929 Saint Paul Drive in Richardson, outside Dallas. Indio was tapped to manage two DFW properties currently in receivership, including Estancia Estates, where Mendoza lives.\nOn a December morning, reps from Indio were putting up Christmas decorations in the leasing office, and a team of men were working all over the property. Most of the doors and windows had been boarded up with plywood.\n\u201cIt looks promising,\u201d Mendoza said of the repairs.\nVenetos\u2019 victims up the chain are looking for answers too. They\u2019re also looking for Venetos, in Aspen \u201cor wherever else he may be found,\u201d as Rosewood put it in their December lawsuit against him.",

        "content": "Old office space is a millstone around the neck of Houston, and investors spent 2025\u00a0 trying to break free.\nFittingly, the\nbiggest office sale of 2025\nin Bayou City was the return of Houston\u2019s largest office complex to its lender. There\u2019s a bright side to the city\u2019s glum office market for\nowner-occupiers\n, or buyers who would rather use the space they own rather than leasing. Such buyers took more than 2 million square feet of vacant space off the Houston office market in 2025, Partners Real Estate concluded.\nHere are Houston\u2019s biggest office trades of 2025 based on data provided by Cushman &amp; Wakefield.\nHouston Center | 1221 &amp; 1301 McKinney Street &amp; 909 Fannin Street | 4.6 million square feet\nIn the\nbiggest office transaction\nof the year, Brookfield Properties handed Houston Center over to its mezzanine lender in April. A joint venture between pension fund AustralianSuper and Stream Realty took control of the sprawling four-building, 4.6 million-square-foot office campus that Brookfield bought in 2017. Despite Brookfield\u2019s efforts to modernize the property, it\u2019s still been bleeding tenants in recent years, including LyondellBasell, which left 358,000 square feet, and Norton Rose Fulbright, which left a 350,000-square-foot block.\n5555 San Felipe Street | 1.19 million square feet\nThe city\u2019s\nsecond-largest office sale\nreflected the rising trend of owner occupants taking advantage of old office buildings\u2019 low valuations. Dallas-based midstream energy giant Energy Transfer bought the building formerly known as Marathon Oil Tower, at 5555 San Felipe Street, from Starwood Property Trust in April. Starwood floated a possible residential conversion at the 41-story building, but nothing materialized. Starwood took control of the tower in 2022 after prior owner M-M Properties defaulted on an $88 million loan. The 1.2 million-square-foot tower, built in 1983 as the headquarters for Marathon Oil, underwent a $15 million renovation completed in 2022.\nLake Pointe Plaza | 1 Fluor Daniel Drive | 1.17 million square feet\nThe next building on the list is being eyed for demolition. Lovett Commercial is moving forward with plans to transform the former Fluor campus in Sugar Land into a $1 billion mixed-use community. The Houston-based firm bought the property, which includes a nearly 1.2 million-square-foot office campus, in the second quarter of the year and\nproposed plans\nfor the 53-acre redevelopment project in April. Lovett\nsecured approval\nfrom the local zoning commission in the fall for Lake Pointe Green, a 53-acre community that could feature up to 720 multifamily units. This isn\u2019t the first time a\ndeveloper tried to reimagine\nthe campus\nFluor vacated\nin 2023. Sugar Land-based Planned Community Developers took a stab at the project, but plans fell through.\nBrookhollow Central I, II &amp; III | 2800, 2900 &amp; 2950 North Loop Freeway | 810,091 square feet\nThe\nsale of Brookhollow Central\nis also a distress story. A British Virgin Islands court ordered the owner Hertz Investment Group to liquidate its U.S. assets in 2024 to repay $145 million owed to Israeli bondholders. A joint venture of Dominus Commercial of Irving and Houston-based Meneses Holdings reportedly paid a bargain basement price for the three-building, 810,000-square-foot office complex: $58.4 million, or $72 a square foot. Hertz paid $70.5 million ($87 per square foot) for the property in 2018.\n717 Texas | 717 Texas Avenue | 697,195 square feet\nHines offloaded 717 Texas, its downtown theater district office building that\u2019s anchored by electricity company Calpine. Hines and Prime Asset Management developed the building in 2003 and renovated it in 2019. The buyer was New York Life.\nOne City Center | 1021 Main Street | 594,595 square feet\n3L Real Estate envisions a second act for\nOne City Center\n. The Chicago-based developer bought the downtown office tower, at 1021 Main Street, from Accesso Partners after special servicer Midland took over the property. It\u2019s been in a downward spiral since 2020 when its largest tenant, Waste Management, left, leaving it about 90 percent empty. 3L plans to convert the property into 93 corporate suites for visiting employees and 460 traditional apartments.\nThirty Forty Post Oak | 3040 Post Oak Boulevard | 425,199 square feet\nBraun Enterprises\npicked up the 426,000-square-foot office building, at 3040 Post Oak Boulevard with plans for an extensive renovation. The 22-story tower was about 82 percent leased at the time. Planned upgrades include a fitness center, coffee bar, lobby refresh and exterior enhancements.\nClear Lake Central | 600 Gemini Street | 363,050 square feet\nJet Lending took control of Gemini Office Park near Houston\u2019s Space Port after owner JMK5 Holdings defaulted on a $4.95 million loan tied to the property. The two-story, 363,000-square-foot office complex was built in 1986 and renovated in 2021. It\u2019s home to Houston-based spacesuit maker\nAxiom Aerospace\n, which has a 180,000-square-foot lease at the property.\nEnergy Center I | 585 North Dairy Ashford | 339,764 square feet\nAl Khor Holding picked up an office property in Houston\u2019s coveted Energy Corridor, a submarket squarely at the top of corporate tenants\u2019 office wishlists. Energy Center I, at 585 North Dairy Ashford, was previously owned by Spear Street Capital. The 13-story property built in 2008 and renovated in 2020 is home to Omaha, Nebraska-based Kiewit Engineering, which\nadded 106,000 square feet\nto its lease in 2023 for a total of 277,105 square feet.\nKirkwood Tower | 11757 Katy Freeway | 280,436 square feet\nA final\ndistress sale\nto wrap up the list: Apollo Global Management ownership of Kirkwood Tower after owner Gemini Rosemont defaulted on a $30.9 million loan from Voya Insurance. The 15-story office property sheathed in black glass was built in 1984 and renovated in 2015.",

        "content": "Oak Row Equities and Vlad Doronin\u2019s OKO Group paid\n$520 million\nfor a bayfront Brickell property, marking the biggest development site sale in Miami and likely the state.\nThe December trade added fuel to the real estate industry\u2019s narrative that Miami\u2019s financial district is a prime market, insulated from the headwinds felt in most of the rest of the tri-county region and much of the nation, including elevated interest rates.\nSome lenders still are skittish, as South Florida has felt the sting in recent years from higher insurance and materials costs.\nYet, Brickell remains a prime target for investors and developers. It became a\nmagnet\nfor out-of-state companies in the first years of the pandemic, as well as\nresidential development.\n\\\nMost of the tri-county region\u2019s top development site deals have been in Brickell, with a few exceptions. Here\u2019s a look at some of Miami\u2019s most notable urban land sales over the years.\nOKO and Oak Row\u2019s new record\nMiami-based OKO and Oak Row, with offices in New York and Miami, paid $122.4 million per acre for the 4.25-acre Brickell site.\nPart of the purchase was financed by $85 million in transferable seller financing notes, according to Aimco\u2019s Dec. 22 filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe property consists of the 32-story Brickell Bay Office Tower at 1001 Brickell Bay Drive and the adjacent 31-story, 357-unit Yacht Club Apartments at 1111 Brickell Bay Drive. Both are income-producing.\nFor the first phase of their redevelopment, OKO and Oak Row plan a hotel and branded condos, they said in a news release.\nThe project will add to the surge in development of branded residences in South Florida, as the tri-county region is the\nepicenter\nof such projects in North America, according to Knight Frank. Miami had\n48 completed\nand 55 planned branded projects as of last month, second only to Dubai, according to Savills.\nThe Brickell property can be developed with multiple supertalls totaling more than 3 million square feet across property types. The Federal Aviation Administration caps heights in Miami to 1,049 feet. The site has 485 feet of Biscayne Bay frontage.\nRobert Given and Troy Ballard led the CBRE team that marketed the Aimco site. Aimco, which last month announced a\nvoluntary liquidation\namid a slower multifamily market nationwide, listed the property last year, asking about\n$650 million\n.\nKen Griffin\u2019s HQ supertall site\nFor the past three years, billionaire hedge funder Ken Griffin held the record for the biggest South Florida development site deal.\nIn 2022, an entity tied to Griffin paid\n$363 million\n\u2013\u2013 or $145.2 million per acre \u2013\u2013 for the 2.5-acre vacant bayfront site at 1201 Brickell Bay Drive, also in Miami\u2019s Brickell.\nGriffin, who moved his hedge fund Citadel and sister market marker company Citadel Securities\u2019 headquarters from Chicago to Miami in 2022, plans a 1,032-foot-tall supertall tower on the site. Designed by starchitect Norman Foster\u2019s firm, the\n$1 billion\n-plus project will have 1.3 million square feet of office space on the first 34 floors, including space for the headquarters for Citadel and Citadel Securities. The firms are temporarily leasing space elsewhere, including at 830 Brickell.\nSome of the office space at the supertall will be leased to other companies.\nThe 54-story project also will have 212 hotel keys on the upper floors, fine dining restaurants with 915 seats and an over 5,200-square-foot health and spa area with open space. In January, Griffin and New York-based Related Companies, led by Jeff Blau and President Bruce Beal Jr., announced they are\npartnering\non the project.\nThe site was long slated for a supertall. The Hollo family\u2019s Florida East Coast Realty, which sold the land to Griffin, and Corigin Real Estate Group and Frank McCourt\u2019s McCourt Global Properties had planned a pair of 1,049-foot-tall buildings on the property that never came to fruition. That project also was designed by Foster + Partners.\nSite of Swire\u2019s scrapped office supertall\nSwire Properties revealed its planned One Brickell City Centre supertall in 2022. This year, Swire Properties, which is the real estate arm of Hong Kong-based Swire, sold the 2.8-acre site for\n$211.5 million\n.\nMiami-based Melo Group, led by brothers Carlos and Martin Melo, bought the site at 700 and 799 Brickell Avenue in Miami in May for $75.5 million per acre. Melo Group, which has built over 8,000 condos and rentals in Miami and was started by the Argentine family\u2019s patriarch, Jose\u00a0 Luis Ferreira de Melo, hasn\u2019t revealed development plans for the property.\nSwire, which at one point was to partner with Related Companies on the project, had planned on a 1,000-foot-tall tower with 1.4 million square feet offices. It scored approval for some of the largest floor plates in Miami, from 40,000 square feet on upper floors to 60,000 square feet on lower floors.\nThis year, Swire\nscrapped\nthe office supertall just as the pandemic-era influx of out-of-state companies to South Florida slowed. (Related wasn\u2019t involved in the project by then.) Swire Properties President Henry Bott\ntold Bloomberg\n\u201cthe pre-leasing for that specific scheme has not materialized in the way that we had hoped.\u201d\nBecause of the tower\u2019s large size, it required significant pre-leasing before it could secure a construction loan. Though out-of-state firms took big blocks of space from late 2020 through 2022, their appetite to Miami offices waned in subsequent years.\nThe Aston Martin condos site\nIn 2014, a trio of developers sold the 1.25-acre bayfront lot next to the Epic Residences &amp; Hotel in downtown Miami for\n$125 million\n\u2013\u2013 one of the top deals at the time. It broke down to $100 million per acre.\nBuyer G&amp;G Business Developments, led by German Coto of the Argentine Coto Supermarkets family, completed the 66-story, 391-unit Aston Martin Residences condo on the property last year.\nThe sellers of the property at 300 Biscayne Boulevard Way were Spanish billionaire\nAmancio Ortega\u2019s\nPontegadea family investment firm, Ugo Colombo of Miami-based CMC Group and Diego Lowenstein. Ortega and CMC Group completed the adjacent 54-story Epic with 414 hotel keys and 362 condos, in 2008.\nDubai firm buys Surfside collapse site\nDubai-based Damac Properties closed on its\n$120 million\npurchase of the Surfside collapse site in 2022.\nThe 12-story Champlain Towers South, at 8777 Collins Avenue, collapsed in the early morning of June 24, 2021, killing 98 people. The judge overseeing the class-action lawsuit over the tragedy ordered the sale of the oceanfront property. Damac was the sole bidder.\nFounded by billionaire\nHussain Sajwani\n, Damac has developed luxury condos, many of them branded, across the Middle East and London. Damac\u2019s Surfside project is its first ground-up development in the U.S.\nDamac\nlaunched sales of its planned luxury 12-story, 37-unit development, called Delmore, a year ago. Designed by Zaha Hadid Architects, Delmore will consist of four- and five-bedroom condos, averaging more than 7,000 square feet with asking prices starting at $15 million. Penthouses will start at 10,000 square feet.\nDamac\u2019s purchase broke down to about $60 million per acre for the nearly 2-acre site.\nThe biggest deal that never closed\nIn 2023, a group of investors led by David Martin\u2019s Coconut Grove-based Terra was in line to purchase the Miami Herald\u2019s former bayfront site for\n$1.2 billion\n. But the deal, which would have set an all-time record for Florida, was\ncalled off\ntwo months after Terra and its partners put the 15-acre site under contract.\nKuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based gambling operator Genting Group listed the land at 1431 North Bayshore Drive in Miami\u2019s Arts &amp; Entertainment District, which represents more than half of Genting\u2019s holdings in the area.\nWhen Smart City Miami, the Terra-led group, put the property under contract, it gave a\nboost\nto the market, giving momentum for other South Florida deals at a time of higher interest rates and other headwinds.\nIn a joint statement about the deal cancellation, Smart City and Genting said the buyers sought amendments to the purchase terms and an extension to the due diligence period. At the time, it was expected that either Smart City would submit another bid or that Genting would renegotiate with some of the other four bidders. The property remains unsold.\nGenting paid $236 million for the 14.6-acre ex-Herald site in 2011, marking the top development site deal at the time. The newspaper\u2019s building was subsequently torn down.\nIf Smart City had closed on its $1.2 billion purchase, that deal would have penciled out to $77.4 million per acre.\n",

        "content": "HUBB NYC was among the buyers who closed out 2025 striking deals in Brooklyn.\nThe firm acquired 599 Baltic Street from Adam America for $40 million last week, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The deal works out to $571,000 per unit for the 70-unit building, which appears to feature both rentals and condominiums.\nJLL Real Estate Capital provided a $29.7 million acquisition loan to HUBB for the purchase. None of the parties in the deal commented to the Observer on the transaction.\nOmri Sachs\u2019 Adam America developed the nine-story building six years ago. It was part of a company portfolio of multifamily properties, including assets in Connecticut, Florida and Texas.\nFor HUBB, the acquisition was the culmination of a push in the borough to end 2025.\nIn November, HUBB acquired a 12-story, 105-unit multifamily building at 177 Front Street in Dumbo from the Carlyle Group\nfor $85 million\n. JLL Real Estate Capital was also involved in a lender position there, assuming a $43.3 million mortgage on the property.\nFounded in 2011, HUBB often positions itself as an all-cash buyer and features more than 80 properties in its portfolio. An affiliate of the company recently\npaid $20.3 million\nfor an apartment building at 254 Water Street; the seller of the 26-unit property was Michael Alvandi\u2019s City Urban Realty, which purchased the property in 2019 for $15 million.\nElsewhere in Gowanus, Midwood Investment &amp; Development\nsecured a $200 million construction loan\nfrom Affinius Capital for its 21-story, 276-unit multifamily project at 200 Douglass Street.\nThe development will include 20,000 square feet of retail space and a variety of amenities. The expected completion date is in the fall of 2027.\nGowanus grew in stature several years ago when the neighborhood was rezoned in 2021, a measure expected to add more than 8,000 apartments to the area over the span of a decade.\u00a0\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Related Group, Dezer Development and BH Group filed plans for their oceanfront condo tower in Sunny Isles Beach, months after acquiring the older condo complex that occupies the property.\nThe partnership\ncompleted a $131.8 million buyout\nof the 108-unit Miami Beach Club at 19051 Collins Avenue last summer, with plans for a luxury condo tower. The two-story Miami Beach Club was constructed in 1951 on a 2-acre site immediately north of\nResidences by Armani/Casa\n, a luxury condo tower that Related and Dezer co-developed.\nIn May, permit filings were submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration for a building that would be 828 feet above sea level or 820 feet above ground for the new project.\nOver the past year, the Related-Dezer-BH venture submitted plans to the city of Sunny Isles, obtained by\nThe Real Deal\n, that included renderings of the proposed high-rise, details about the project and the breakdown in ownership.\nThe project\nMB RE Investments LLC is the developer. An ownership chart submitted to Sunny Isles in December 2024 shows that a Delaware entity, BLFO MBC MEMBER LLC, owns 75 percent. That LLC is owned by Bahamian entities tied to a Brazilian family. The remaining 25 percent is owned by the developers, the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related, the Dezer family firm and Isaac and Liat Toledano\u2019s BH.\nA letter filed by the developers\u2019 land use attorneys regarding site plan approval states that with bonuses and the transfer of development rights, they plan a 62-story, 145-unit condo tower designed by Cohen Freedman Encinosa &amp; Associates Architects and Enzo Enea\u2019s landscape architecture firm. The developers plan to build a density of about 73 units per acre.\nThe project could cost about $294 million to build, and it has an anticipated completion date of December 2031, according to the letter, which was submitted by attorney Tracy R. Slavens of LSN Law. The developers are seeking up to five years from approval to obtain a building permit, and up to five years from the issuance of a building permit to complete the tower.\nThe tower is expected to include a padel court, pool deck, water features and a sculpture garden on the west-facing side of the property; and a lap pool, outdoor spa, cabanas and beach access on the east.\nThe buyout of Miami Beach Club was in the works for more than a decade.\nRelated owned units through executives, and the firm also created a company in 2013 named after the property\u2019s address. Investor and developer Richard Meruelo, or an entity he previously managed, sold the units to the Related executives, records show. Miami Beach Club\u2019s condo association and at least\none unit owner\nfiled lawsuits against the Related/Dezer entity that developed Residences by Armani/Casa. One lawsuit over construction next door was dismissed in 2022.\nIn Sunny Isles, Dezer is also building Bentley Residences. Dezer Development secured\na $630 million construction loan\nin November from Madison Realty Capital for the 61-story, 216-unit tower, which will mark the first Bentley-branded residential high-rise when it\u2019s completed.\n",

        "content": "AT&amp;T is officially leaving\nDowntown Dallas\n.\nThe telecommunications giant confirmed Monday that it will plant its flag in Plano after months of searching for office space across North Texas, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nA new global headquarters will rise at the 54-acre site at 5400 Legacy Drive in Plano\u2019s Legacy developement, with\nAT&amp;T\ntargeting partial occupancy as early as the second half of 2028.\nThe outlet reported that Stankey framed the decision as a consolidation move, saying the Plano site will allow AT&amp;T to \u201ccost effectively consolidate all Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex administrative space,\u201d including major offices in Dallas,\nPlano and Irving\n, while creating a purpose-built corporate campus.\nThe announcement raises fresh questions about AT&amp;T\u2019s long-term commitment to Downtown Dallas, where the company has invested heavily over the past decade. AT&amp;T spent roughly $100 million developing its Discovery District, a splashy downtown campus with a massive outdoor media screen, food hall and public gathering space that opened in 2021.\nAt its peak in 2022, AT&amp;T had nearly 6,000 employees assigned to downtown offices. Its footprint there spans about 2 million square feet across four buildings, anchored by the 37-story Whitacre Tower at 208 South Akard Street, where its lease runs through 2030. The company relocated its headquarters to Dallas in 2008 after leaving\nSan Antonio\n.\nAT&amp;T told the outlet that internal data showed a majority of employees would have a shorter commute to Plano, a factor that weighed into the decision.\nThe Plano site is owned by Dallas-based\nNexPoint\n, which controls 215 acres that include the former headquarters of Electronic Data Systems, the information technology company founded by Ross Perot. NexPoint had been planning a 4 million-square-foot mixed-use project dubbed the\nTexas Research Quarter\n, aimed at life sciences and advanced manufacturing tenants.\nPlano City Council approved up to $15 million in reimbursements for the redevelopment last year through a new tax increment reinvestment zone. How AT&amp;T\u2019s arrival reshapes those plans remains unclear.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Months after\nsecuring the former\n, Related Companies and Oxford Properties Group landed the latter in Hudson Yards.\nRelated and Oxford scored $1.6 billion in construction financing for their 72-story office tower project at 70 Hudson Yards, Bloomberg\nreported\n. The partners subsequently completed a $2.45 billion recapitalization of the development, according to a statement.\nWells Fargo, Bank of America and Standard Chartered underwrote and structured the construction debt. Institutional investors also provided equity for the development.\nRelated and Oxford broke ground on the project in July and anticipate opening the building to tenants by the end of 2028. Top floor leasing is expected to start this year.\nThe 1.4-million-square-foot development represents the nation\u2019s largest ground-up office development since the onset of the pandemic more than a half-decade ago. Amenities will include an event space, private dining, a media-podcast studio and \u201cred eye\u201d suites for use after flights.\nLast spring, accounting and consulting firm Deloitte agreed to lease 800,000 square feet at the property before it broke ground. The space, which includes an 8,000-square-foot terrace, will serve as North American headquarters for the company.\nThe developers are banking on interest from other tenants looking for high-quality office spaces. Judging from leasing activity in Manhattan last year, they should be feeling confident.\nManhattan was on track last month to surpass 40 million square feet worth of deals for the year, which would be the first time it crossed that threshold since 2019. Manhattan office availability came down to 14.2 percent in December, according to Colliers, the lowest rate since late 2020.\nThere were even a couple of leases last year that\ncracked the 1-million-square-foot mark\n; Deloitte\u2019s deal at 70 Hudson Yards was the year\u2019s third-largest lease in the borough.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Stuffy buttoned-up Midtown enclaves like the Penn Club, Harvard Club and Yale Club functioned more as after-hours boardrooms than places to meet up with friends for drinks.\nThat changed in 2003, when London-based social club\nSoho House\ncrossed the Atlantic, opening its first U.S. location in Manhattan\u2019s Meatpacking District. The club signed a lease for 45,000 square feet at the brick loft building at 29 Ninth Avenue, kicking off a new era of private spaces that were hip and exclusive.\nToday, the city is awash in clubs, from stalwarts like Zero Bond and Casa Cipriani, to ZZ\u2019s Member Club from Major Food Group, and the newest entrants such as Moss and Flyfish Club. They\u2019re cropping up in office buildings, hotels and condo towers, adding cachet and amenity value for landlords. At the same time, family-oriented concepts like The Beginning Clubhouse and Kings Athletic Club are\nslated to open\nin vacant properties in Brooklyn, filling less desirable spaces and branding themselves as urban country clubs.\nBrokers are now tracking more than three dozen private clubs operating or in development across the five boroughs. To landlords and dealmakers, the trend has produced one of the most compelling tenant classes in the post-pandemic real estate reset.\n\u201cI think landlords understand the importance of these clubs and how it\u2019ll help them potentially in the leaseability of the asset for cool brands that want an element of cachet or want an element of cool to offer their employees or their clients,\u201d broker Brandon Singer of Retail by MONA said.\nBut to doubters, the sheer volume signals oversaturation. Private clubs typically lock in long-term leases, offering landlords steady rent but little flexibility. If the membership fails to materialize, those cavernous, custom-built spaces can go dark, leaving both club operators and property owners exposed.\n\u201cI think when you have too many that are opening, it\u2019s creating a problem,\u201d Singer said. \u201cI don\u2019t care how much money you make, there\u2019s only so many people that can afford that [membership]. So I think you will see a thinning out.\u201d\nF\nrom nightlife to asset class\nThe current private-club boom can be traced, in part, to Zero Bond, a former Brooks Brothers factory at 670 Broadway that helped rewrite the playbook for post-pandemic hospitality.\nWhen Brandon Charnas first encountered the struggling loft building, he was a corporate lawyer at Kirkland &amp; Ellis. But Charnas saw an opportunity. He connected the building\u2019s owner with Paramount Group, whose chief investment officer happened to be a college friend from Penn. In 2015, Charnas brokered the sale of the nearly vacant building to Paramount for $112 million.\nThat move set Charnas\u2019s next deal in motion: persuading Scott Sartiano, newly untethered after selling his nightlife business, to consider the space for a members-only club. He also had to win over Paramount Group.\n\u201cThis was before [the] wave of clubs,\u201d Charnas said. \u201dThey had no idea what it was going to be, and they didn\u2019t understand it.\u201d\nBrokers are now tracking more than three dozen private clubs operating or in development across the five boroughs.\nCharnas managed to get approval from the city\u2019s Department of Buildings to change the address of the five-story landmarked property to 0 Bond. After Charnas secured a liquor license, Sartiano inked a 15-year, 20,000-square-foot lease across three floors of the office building. Asking rent was more than $100 per foot.\n\u201cWe got the lease done because we got the liquor license, and it all made sense,\u201d said Charnas, who co-founded Current Real Estate Advisors in 2018.\nThe club debuted in October 2020, when Covid restrictions were loosening, only to close weeks later amid new pandemic rules. It reopened in February 2021, just as the city began to loosen its grip. Since then, it has drawn a Who\u2019s Who of big names, including Bella Hadid, Hailey Bieber and Eric Adams. Zero Bond quickly became a textbook example of how a private club could anchor a building and boost its prestige. It\u2019s \u201cjust grown to this amazing place,\u201d Charnas said.\nAs Zero Bond made its mark, other would-be private club proprietors raced to find pandemic-era deals.\n\u201cThere were a lot of vacant spaces, rents were cheap, so a lot of these clubs swooped in and signed leases,\u201d Singer said.\nV\nenue of their own\nPrivate clubs hit a sweet spot for landlords. They typically sign 10- to 20-year leases, often with extension options. Buildouts are expensive and bespoke, which discourages early exits. Unlike restaurants, clubs generate upfront capital through initiation fees and recurring revenue through regular dues. Landlords frequently contribute to private club buildouts through tenant improvement allowances, rent credits or extended free-rent periods.\n\u201cI work on a lot of these types of deals, and the best ones are where there\u2019s mutual alignment with the business plan between the landlord and the tenant,\u201d attorney Shaun Pappas of Starr Associates said. \u201cThe landlord becomes almost a partner.\u201d\nA private club in an office or residential building also functions as a built-in amenity that helps landlords lease the rest of the building. Moss, which recently opened across five floors at Rabina\u2019s new supertall condo and office tower 520 Fifth Avenue, was conceived to add to the building\u2019s broader value proposition. Pappas negotiated the 40,000-square-foot deal on behalf of the landlord. Both declined to discuss the terms of the lease.\n\u201cAs part of that development, [Rabina] had this member-club idea that\u2019s offered not only for residents, but also to the public,\u201d Pappas said. \u201cIt\u2019s offering a little bit more than just a restaurant. It has amenities \u2014 a pool and gym and spa and all those things.\u201d He figures it\u2019ll be well-used in the neighborhood, by\nboth workers and residents\n.\nBrokers themselves patronize clubs as dealmaking venues. Last summer, Pappas brought together three of his real estate developer clients for dinner and drinks on the terrace at Casa Cipriani, one of the three private clubs he belongs to. The setting bred conviviality even though the clients hadn\u2019t previously met.\n\u201cI thought it would be nice for them to get together to talk about war stories,\u201d Pappas said. \u201cThat type of thing overlooking the East River on a nice Tuesday night at 7 o\u2019clock while the sun sets is a pretty awesome experience.\u201d\nMembership also means avoiding the scramble of booking a table at the right restaurant.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so impossible to even get reservations these days, right?\u201d he added.\nL\neasing versus owning\nNew York\u2019s private club boom is partly about filling a post-pandemic gap for \u201cthird places,\u201d gathering spots that are neither work nor home. Modern clubs double as coworking spaces, social lounges, dining rooms, wellness hubs and\nnetworking spots\n.\n\u201cThat element coming out of Covid of finding alternative safe spaces to congregate and socialize \u2014 there is a continued desire to find third spaces to kind of solve this trend of loneliness,\u201d CBRE\u2019s Aylin Gucalp said.\nClubs are growing more niche in an effort to stand out to potential members.\nIn Brooklyn, a wave of family-friendly clubs is cornering the borough\u2019s kid-packed neighborhoods. Little Big Hospitality is transforming an empty office building at 50 Columbia Heights into The Beginning Clubhouse, a seven-story space with a rooftop pizzeria, screening room, bowling alley and indoor jungle gym. Nearby, Kings Athletic Club will open in Brooklyn Heights with a mix of wellness and hospitality amenities for families.\n\u201cWhat they wanted to do was marry what everybody knows as that sort of private club scene and setting in a family-oriented environment,\u201d Newmark broker Peter Whitenack said. He represented landlord CIM Group at 50 Columbia Heights. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a place where adults are going to go and drop the kids off and have me-time upstairs. There\u2019s interaction with the kids and there\u2019s programming and movie nights.\u201d\nBut such specialized branding and build-outs can be expensive. While landlords love clubs right now, the clubs themselves don\u2019t have much leverage when leases come up for renewal, said Bob Knakal of commercial brokerage BKREA.\n\u201cAfter investing all that and having a location become known as \u2018the place,\u2019 the landlord would really have you [the tenant] in a pickle if you were doing great and your lease came up and they want to triple or quadruple the rent,\u201d Knakal said.\nBKREA is negotiating a deal for a private club planning to expand into New York from another location, Knakal said. The firm is also marketing the former Friars Club building, at 57 East 55th Street, which reverted to the lender in 2025 after the owner defaulted on a $13 million loan. BKREA has received multiple proposals for another private club that wants to buy the property.\n\u201cWe have several folks we talked to that own these clubs that have leased space,\u201d Knakal said. They wished they\u2019d bought instead, they tell him.\nA\ncrowded field\nSky-high dues and a flood of new clubs may be pushing the world behind the velvet rope toward a reckoning.\nAt Zero Bond, annual dues range from $2,750 to $4,400, depending on a member\u2019s age, and are on top of a $750 to $5,000 initiation fee also depending on age, according to the club\u2019s website. Casa Cipriani charges a $2,000 initiation fee plus annual dues of about $3,900, though prices vary. The ultra-exclusive Aman Club requires $15,000 in yearly dues, plus a staggering $200,000 initiation fee.\nMeanwhile, new clubs keep pulling members away from more established spots, in a constant shifting of the social landscape.\n\u201cBasically, you\u2019re going to one place now and then in a year, that place is yesterday\u2019s news,\u201d said Singer, who belongs to Colette, the private club on the 37th floor of the GM Building.\nSinger often pops into Coco\u2019s at Colette from his nearby office for breakfast, lunch or meetings, so he\u2019s still riding the trend, even if it\u2019s not forever.\n\u201cThe best of the best will last and stick around,\u201d he predicted. \u201cAnd I think the balance will shutter.\u201d",

        "content": "Kurt Bender waded into a pool of multifamily distress with the latest extension of his firm\u2019s Chicagoland dealmaking streak.\nBender Companies bought a former Sears department store reborn as apartments on Chicago\u2019s North Side for $29 million, closing the book on a foreclosure fight against the property\u2019s previous owner, an offshoot of the embattled Chicago-based development firm\nCA Ventures\n.\nChicago-based Bender bought the four-story property at 1900 West Lawrence Avenue in the Ravenswood neighborhood alongside Denver-based Walker &amp; Dunlop Investment Partners, CoStar\nreported\n. The deal was recorded Dec. 16, according to property records.\nThe sale resolves a foreclosure suit tied to the property\u2019s redevelopment, which converted the long-vacant Sears box into 59 apartments and roughly 19,000 square feet of ground-floor retail about four years ago. The building sits at the corner of Lawrence and Wolcott avenues, steps from the Ravenswood Metra stop.\nThe transaction is described in Cook County records as a sale in lieu of foreclosure. The property had been owned by an entity tied to CA Residential, an affiliate of CA Ventures which partnered with another local firm on the adaptive reuse. Cushman &amp; Wakefield brokers Jack Maloney and Brad Smith represented the seller.\nThe deal comes a little more than a year after\nLoanCore Capital\nfiled a $32 million foreclosure complaint against CA Residential, alleging the developer failed to pay off its loan on the property.\nWhile the apartment portion of the building is modest in scale, the retail is fully leased. One tenant is DeVry University\u2019s Advantage Academy, a program that allows Chicago Public Schools high school students to earn college credits in technology-focused courses, giving the property a community-facing component.\nBender\nsaid it plans to invest in both exterior and interior upgrades, including a new fitness space. In a statement, Mark Barnes, the firm\u2019s vice president of investments, pointed to a shortage of larger apartment offerings in Ravenswood as a key driver behind the acquisition.\nThe purchase adds to what\u2019s shaping up as Chicago\u2019s busiest year for multifamily investment sales since 2022. Investors closed on $4.9 billion worth of apartment deals in the metro area in 2025, according to CoStar data, eclipsing the $3.9 billion recorded in all of 2024.\nThe Ravenswood deal marks Bender Companies fifth acquisition of 2025. Other recent acquisitions include a $75.3 million purchase of a 509-unit complex in\nMount Prospect\nand a $75.8 million deal for a 550-unit property in\nHoffman Estates\n, both joint ventures with Eastham Capital.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Affiliated Development scored a $73 million construction loan for a Live Local Act project in Boynton Beach, amid a rush to build apartments under the state workforce housing law.\nFort Lauderdale-based Affiliated, a workforce and affordable rentals developer, started construction of The Dune with 336 units on a 4.3-acre site at 2607 and 2617 South Federal Highway, steps from the Intracoastal Waterway, according to records and the developer\u2019s news release.\nPacific Life Insurance provided the financing. Affiliated also tapped equity from family office capital partners and its Affiliated Housing Impact Fund, the release says. The firm launched a fund last year, with the goal of raising\n$250 million\nfor mixed-income multifamily projects in Florida.\nThe Dune will consist of an eight-story, 298-unit building; 38 three-story rental townhomes; and retail, the release says. Out of the 336 apartments, 198 will be reserved for households earning from 80 percent to 120 percent of the area median income. The Florida Housing Finance Corporation shows Palm Beach County\u2019s annual AMI is $111,800. This is expected to be updated in the spring.\nAffiliate\u2019s designation of 59 percent of units as workforce rentals exceeds Live Local\u2019s requirement that at least 40 percent of apartments are at below-market rents.\nThe state law, first approved in 2023 and tweaked the subsequent two years, incentivizes inclusion of affordable and workforce rentals in projects by allowing developers to build bigger projects than zoning permits and granting them property tax breaks. Through the law, developers also can bypass public hearings and score approvals administratively.\nAffiliated bought The Dune site in 2024 for\n$12 million\n, according to records.\nThe firm, led by Jeff Burns and Nick Rojo, has about a dozen multifamily projects in South Florida. Its completed buildings include the 142-unit The Six13 in Fort Lauderdale, 200-unit\nBohemian\nand 230-unit MID in Lake Worth Beach, and 301-unit\nThe Grand\nin downtown West Palm Beach.\nAlso in Boynton Beach, Affiliated plans the 300-unit\nThe Pierce\nworkforce rentals project with 17,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space at Ocean Avenue and Federal Highway, near the intracoastal. Construction of The Pierce is expected to start this year, according to the release.\nDevelopers have seized on the Live Local Act with a flurry of project applications, with a few also scoring construction financing and starting to build their complexes.\nCoral Rock Development Group landed\n$54 million\nlast month to build the eight-story, 227-unit Dulce Vida Live Local Act apartment building in Miami\u2019s Allapattah. Developer Daniel Abreu scored a\n$16.5 million\nconstruction loan in 2024 for an 80-unit apartment building near North Miami.\nOnly a handful of Live Local projects have been completed since the law passed.\nAcross Florida, developers finished nearly 3,200 below-market rentals under the legislation in 23 projects, according to a Florida TaxWatch, a nonpartisan and nonprofit research institute. The pipeline consists of\n43,400 units\nacross 143 projects that are in various stages from proposed to approved, research from the nonprofit Florida Housing Coalition shows.\n",

The rent was later raised to $7,000 per month.

Now they\u2019ll have one more place to do it.\nNewly-inaugurated Mayor Zohran Mamdani signed an executive order mandating \u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings in all five boroughs. The hearings invite tenants to complain about their landlords, as well as propose changes from the city.\n\u201cNew Yorkers know that too often, if they can find a home that they can afford, there is likely a reason they can afford it: Roaches and rats, heat that never turns on, elevators that are always out of order,\u201d the mayor said at a press conference focused on his housing efforts.\nMamdani\u2019s relationship with the real estate industry warmed toward the end of his campaign, as both sides realized they would need to work with one another. But the rental ripoff hearings stand to re-ignite the anger of the city\u2019s multifamily landlords.\nThe hearings will be organized by the city\u2019s new Mayor\u2019s Office to Protect Tenants, headed by former tenant advocate Cea Weaver, as well as the city\u2019s housing development, buildings, and consumer and worker protection departments. The order calls for every borough to have a hearing within the first 100 days of the Mamdani administration, with the hearings resulting in a joint summary and report.\nThe hearings will specifically concern, \u201cillegal, unfair, abusive, deceptive, or unconscionable landlord practices,\u201d according to the order. The text refers to landlords and property managers as potential speakers, along with tenant organizations, advocates, and service providers.\nThe report is due no more than 90 days after the last hearing and should include a plan for the city to address \u201charmful landlord practices.\u201d Outcomes should focus on ensuring faster correction of housing violations and increased coordination among agencies and with the public.",

        "content": "In the final hours of the Adams administration, the incoming mayor was handed a win.\nOne of Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 new appointees to the Rent Guidelines Board, Lliam Finn, decided against serving, leaving a vacancy for Zohran Mamdani to fill,\nThe Real Deal\nwas\nfirst to report\n.\nBefore leaving office, Adams tried to replace him with Christie Peale, head of the Center for New York City Neighborhoods, a nonprofit focused on affordable homeownership. Though Peale appeared briefly on the board\u2019s website over the weekend, she also turned down the role.\n\u201cIt was an honor to be selected to serve in a role of vital importance to so many New Yorkers, however, I decided it was not appropriate for my nomination to the Rent Guidelines Board to move forward at this time,\u201d she said in a statement.\nThe New York Daily News first\nreported\nthat Peale was up for Finn\u2019s seat.\nLast month Adams announced the appointment of\ntwo new members\nto the board: Finn, as a public representative, and Sagar Sharma, an attorney with Legal Services NYC\u2019s housing unit, as a tenant representative. It\u2019s not clear when Finn rejected Adams\u2019 offer, but he did not go through the process of getting approval from his employer, Merrill Lynch, to serve on the board.\nAdams also reappointed landlord attorney Christina Smyth as an owner representative and Arpit Gupta as a public one. A representative for Mamdani didn\u2019t return requests seeking comment.\nThose appointments meant that in Mamdani\u2019s first year as mayor, a majority of the board\u2019s members would be Adams appointees. The move was viewed as an attempt to prevent\nMamdani\u2019s\ncampaign pledge to freeze rents\nfor stabilized tenants for four years.\nFinn\u2019s departure and Peale\u2019s rejection mean that Mamdani can replace as many as five members (including the chair) whenever he chooses, ensuring that his appointees make up a majority of the nine-person board. Next year, he can replace the four remaining members.\nAppointing a majority of the members doesn\u2019t guarantee a rent freeze. The board is supposed to be an independent body, though mayors have historically influenced its decisions.\nThe final day of the Adams administration proved to be an eventful one. Adams vetoed 19 bills, including the\nCommunity Opportunity to Purchase Act\n, or COPA. He also tried to secure a last-minute\ndeal\nwith developers to drop their lawsuit related to their planned development at the Elizabeth Street Garden, but they\nrejected\nthe administration\u2019s offer.\nMeanwhile, Mamdani\u2019s first actions as mayor included\nintervening\nin a major bankruptcy case that will decide the fate of Pinnacle\u2019s rent-stabilized portfolio, relaunching the Office to Protect Tenants and announcing \u201cRental Ripoff\u201d hearings for tenants to sound off on bad landlords.\n",

        "content": "Lenders made another billion-dollar bet on the Manhattan market office in November, the latest vote of confidence in the borough\u2019s top-tier towers. Deutsche Bank Center landed the month\u2019s\nmarquee deal\n, a $1.1 billion CMBS loan from German American Capital Corporation and Wells Fargo. The fully leased Lincoln Square office tower is owned by a joint venture that includes Related Companies and sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and Abu Dhabi. Deutsche Bank occupies more than 93 percent of the former Time Warner Center under a 20-year lease.\nElsewhere in the borough, lenders doled out dollars to apartments, specialty medical buildings and student housing. Vanbarton Group\u2019s Midtown South apartment tower, which recently absorbed former WeWork floors for residential use,\nlanded a $280 million loan\n. Aire, a 43-story Upper West Side rental tower owned by Gotham Organization and Carlyle,\nlanded a $260 million refinance\n. And Nordic Trustee provided $245 million for the New York Proton Center in East Harlem. Rounding out the month, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo backed a $167 million CMBS loan tied to a hotel-to-dorm conversion at 525 Lexington Avenue, part of a larger student housing package spanning New York and Boston.\nHere are more details.\nDeutsche Deal | $1.1B | Upper West Side\nGerman American Capital Corporation and Wells Fargo\noriginated a $1.1 billion CMBS loan for Deutsche Bank Center, owned by a joint venture that includes Related Companies and sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and Abu Dhabi. The floating-rate, interest-only loan refinances existing debt on the 1.1 million-square-foot office tower at 60 Columbus Circle and covers roughly two-thirds of its $1.65 billion appraised value, Bisnow\nreported\n. Deutsche Bank, which relocated its U.S. headquarters to the tower from Wall Street in 2021, occupies 93.5 percent of the building under a 20-year lease with an option to renew for another two decades. The property \u2013\nformerly\nthe Time Warner Center before the media giant decamped to Hudson Yards \u2013 is fully leased.\nFresh Aire | $260M | Upper West Side\nNatixis\nprovided a $260 million loan to refinance Aire, a 43-story Upper West Side apartment tower owned by a joint venture of Gotham Organization and the Carlyle Group. The refinancing at 200 West 67th Street will go toward apartment renovations, as well as updates to the amenities. Carlyle and Gotham snapped up the 310-unit building in 2024 for $265 million from A&amp;R Kalimian Realty, which was forced to sell after being unable to repay a $225 million CMBS loan due to the expiration of the 421a tax break. The fresh financing replaced a $216 million bridge loan from MF1 Capital.\nVanbarton bucks | $280M | Midtown South\nInvesco Real Estate\nprovided a $280 million loan to refinance Vanbarton Group\u2019s Sixth Avenue apartment tower, where the developer recently\nconverted several former WeWork office floors\ninto apartments. Vanbarton bought the property at 980 Sixth Avenue in 2018 for $316 million. The 25-story building, just north of Herald Square between West 36th and West 37th streets, already had 380 rental apartments above the former co-working space and retail on the ground floor. The new loan replaces a $273 million one from Blackstone\u2019s mortgage trust.\nProton payday | $245M | East Harlem\nNordic Trustee\n, an Oslo-based bond trustee, provided a $245 million loan for the proton therapy center at 225 East 126th Street. The financing for the New York Proton Center, owned by an affiliate of Murphy &amp; McManus, replaced a $150 million loan from Nomura Holdings. Murphy &amp; McManus developed the 139,000-square-foot specialty medical building for a partnership between Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Montefiore Health System and Mount Sinai Health System, which leases the building. It opened in August 2019.\nDorm dollars | $167M | Midtown East\nGoldman Sachs and Wells Fargo\nprovided a $167 million CMBS loan for a hotel-dormitory owned by V\u00e4rde Partners and Hawkins Way Capital\u2019s hotel-to-dormitory conversion at 525 Lexington Avenue. The deal is part of a $431 million loan package for a three-building student housing portfolio in New York City and Boston, according to\nMorningstar\n. The two-year, interest-only note has three one-year extension options. Hawkins Way and V\u00e4rde purchased the shuttered Marriott\nin 2023\nfrom German investment firm Deka Immobilien\n$153.4 million\nfor the 655-key property \u2014 a little more than half the $270 million Deka paid for it in 2015. The 34-story building provides 1,355 beds for students from multiple New York City universities and colleges.\n",

        "content": "Tryperion Holdings paid $59 million for Mid America Plaza, a two-building office complex in Oakbrook Terrace near the intersection of Kingery Hwy and West 22nd Street, according to DuPage County property records and first\nreported\nby CoStar. The price is well below the $78 million that seller Equus Capital Partners shelled out for the property in 2016, before the office market fell into its current malaise.\nThe deal marks one of\nTryperion\u2019s\nmore visible entries into the Chicago-area office market, coming just months after the firm announced it had raised $163 million for its latest real estate investment and debt vehicle. The fund targets \u201csub-institutional\u201d assets that often fly under the radar of large institutions, according to the publication.\nAt the time,\nTryperion\nsaid it was actively bidding on office properties in gateway markets while keeping flexibility to invest across other property types. Fund IV drew capital from family offices tied to high-profile investors, including Oaktree Capital co-chairman Howard Marks, Apollo Global Management co-founder Tony Ressler, Moelis &amp; Co. CEO Ken Moelis and Panda Express founders Andrew and Peggy Cherng. The firm also cited an unnamed top-20 university endowment in the Southeast as an investor.\nTryperion financed its suburban Chicago buy with a $36.6 million loan from Continental Casualty Company, a subsidiary of Chicago-based CNA Financial, property records show.\nThe more than 413,000-square-foot\nMid America Plaza\nsits across from Oakbrook Center, one of the region\u2019s largest shopping malls. The complex hit the market in June and was 87 percent leased at the time, with a weighted average lease term of 6.5 years, according to marketing materials from JLL, which brokered the sale. The Oakbrook Terrace sale was brokered by JLL\u2019s Patrick Shields, Sam DiFrancesca, Jaime Fink and Bruce Miller.\nJLL pitched the offering as a chance to acquire a stable, well-leased office asset at a basis far below replacement cost. Newtown Square, Pennsylvania-based Equus had invested $17.7 million into the property since acquiring it, upgrading lobbies and common areas. Tenants including Graycor Services, BCS Financial and Mike Ditka\u2019s Restaurant renewed leases between 2021 and 2025, JLL said.\nTryperion founder and managing partner Jeffrey Karsh said in a statement to the outlet that the firm saw long-term value in entering the Chicago-area market below the replacement cost of the prior owner, calling the property a victim of the broader stigma hanging over the office sector.\nEquus, which is nearing the end of its planned hold period, said it is handing the asset off after a full 10-year investment cycle. The firm is still marketing another suburban Chicago office property \u2014 the Helmut Jahn-designed\nMetroWest\nbuilding in Naperville \u2014 where Newmark brokers were hired in October to seek a buyer.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Dallas County\u2019s $5 billion plans to construct a new jail could unlock one of the most prominent redevelopment sites in the city.\nCounty Judge Clay Jenkins said the county will begin moving forward in 2026 on a replacement for the Lew Sterrett Justice Center at 111 Commerce Street, citing severe overcrowding and the age of the facility, which was built nearly 50 years ago, according to an interview with\nWFAA\n.\nThe new jail is expected to cost north of $5 billion and could take nearly a decade to plan, approve and build.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just throw up a jail in nine months or a year,\u201d\nJenkins said\n, comparing the timeline to other major civic projects like the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center\noverhaul\n.\nOne of the biggest unanswered questions is\nlocation\n. What is clear, Jenkins said, is that the next jail will not sit between Dallas\u2019 two iconic Calatrava bridges, where the current complex occupies highly visible land along the Trinity River. State law requires the jail to remain within four miles of the county courthouse, narrowing the field but still leaving several potential sites in play.\nJenkins said the county expects to purchase land for the new facility later this year, a key step that would solidify plans and start the clock on what would be one of the region\u2019s largest public-sector developments in decades.\nThe relocation could be just as consequential as the jail itself, as vacating the current site would free up a large swath of prime riverfront land near downtown, a parcel that has already been floated as a potential site for a new arena for the\nDallas Mavericks\n, among other high-profile redevelopment concepts.\nThe jail sits on 15 acres of riverfront land owned by the county. The property is valued at $109 million, appraisal district records show.\n\u201cIf you were building a jail now, you probably wouldn\u2019t build it right in the middle of the postcard, front door of Dallas,\u201d Jenkins told the outlet.\nJenkins emphasized that the new jail will be designed to emphasize mental health treatment and lower recidivism, an improvement from the current situation, which cycles inmates through an outdated facility.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The 28-story building would be expanded by two stories and the residential unit count would come in at 169.\nFisch signed a ground lease for the property in 2022 for $88.9 million, taking control of the building\u2019s fate. Immediately before that, prominent investor David Werner bought the property from Vornado\nfor $101 million\n.\nFisch signed the ground lease with Fulton &amp; Pearl, an affiliate of Werner\u2019s. The ground lease and conversion plans were first reported by\nPincusCo\n.\nFisch could not be reached for comment by the Observer.\nThe conversion at the corner of Fulton and Pearl streets will put between six and eight units on most of the floors; there will be ground-floor retail space and office space on a majority of the lowest six floors. There will also be amenities, including a fitness center, a lounge and coworking spaces.\nThough Werner handed the keys of this project to another player, the developer has been involved in prominent office-to-residential conversions in Manhattan in recent years.\nWerner and Nathan Berman\u2019s Metro Loft Management are\nconverting\n675 Third Avenue into a 464-unit residential building, including retail space. Werner acquired the site for $100 million and received a $90 million loan for the acquisition and predevelopment.\nThe two firms are also partners on another large-scale conversion at 235 East 42nd Street, expected to be completed in late 2027.\nIn the first eight months of 2025, more than 4 million square feet of office space in Manhattan had been converted to residential use, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield, already exceeding the totals for each of the preceding two full years.\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Genetic testing company 23andMe has leased office space in Palo Alto after abandoning its larger headquarters complex in Sunnyvale.\nThe firm, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last year, leased 19,000 square feet at 2555 Park Boulevard in Palo Alto, the Silicon Valley Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe building is owned by Cresset Trust Company, a subsidiary of Chicago-based Cresset Capital Management.\nCresset\npurchased the office complex from The Douglas Living Trust in 2023 for an undisclosed price. The Douglas Living Trust\nbought the offices\nthat same year from developer Kenson Ventures for $58 million.\n23andMe\u2019s new deal marks a significant downsizing from the 155,000-square-foot office building at 223 Mathilda Avenue in Sunnyvale it started leasing in 2019. In 2021, the company left the three-story haunts and shifted its headquarters operations to Kilroy Realty\u2019s 65,000-square-foot building at 349 Oyster Point Boulevard in South San Francisco, the Business Journal\nreported\n.\nIn June, after the company went bankrupt, founder Anne Wojcicki acquired 23andMe\u2019s assets for $305 million through her recently founded research firm TTAM Research Institute. TTAM stands for \u201ctwenty-three and me,\u201d according to the Business Journal. That same month, 23andMe\u2019s former headquarters at 223 Mathilda Avenue was sold by Stockbridge Capital Group\nto Spear Street Capital\nfor $87.8 million.\nIn September 2023, 23andMe subleased 17,000 square feet of the 223 Mathilda Avenue building to cloud computing company CoreWeave. When it filed for bankruptcy six months later, the company asked courts to cancel its lease, prompting a lawsuit from\nCoreWeave\nto get its security deposit back and compel Stockbridge Capital to put the building up for sale.\n23andMe was founded in 2006 and has not been profitable since it went public in 2021,\naccording\nto CNN. The company is known for its direct-to-consumer genetic testing service that determines ancestry and genetic predispositions to health concerns via a saliva sample.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The sale of Kirkwood Tower in Houston appeared on The Real Deal\u2019s 2025 list of\nbiggest office sales in Houston\n. It should have appeared on the list twice.\nThe 280,000-square-foot office building at 11757 Katy Freeway, which\nfaced foreclosure\nearly last year, changed hands again in the last week of 2025.\nGemini Rosemont handed over keys to the Energy Corridor building in March to Apollo Global Management after defaulting on a $30.9 million loan from Voya Insurance. David Z. Mafrige Interests, a Houston-based firm that redevelops office and retail, purchased Kirkwood Tower from Apollo in December, according to a release from Stream Realty, which represented the buyer and handles leasing at the property.\nIn conjunction with the ownership change, Stream completed 150,000 square feet of lease transactions, bringing the building\u2019s occupancy to 76 percent, it said in a release.\nThe 15-story office property sheathed in black glass was built in 1984 and renovated in 2015. The building is located along Interstate 10, about 17 miles west of downtown, in Houston\u2019s Energy Corridor, which has become a popular office destination.\nThe availability rate in Houston\u2019s office market was a tick over 26 percent at the end of the third quarter of 2025, according to the Greater Houston Partnership. Office availability peaked at the end of 2022 at a little more than 28 percent.\nThe flight to quality trend continues to tell the story of the Houston office market, with buildings completed in the last 15 years averaging under 15 percent vacancy while older buildings have, on average, nearly 28 percent vacancy, the report said.Houston\u2019s Energy Corridor has become a resilient pocket of Houston\u2019s struggling office market. The submarket saw a slew of leases in 2025, including SM Energy, which\ndoubled its space at Granite Properties\u2019 Eldridge One\n, at 777 North Eldridge Parkway, and\nKansas engineering firm Black &amp; Veatch\n, which landed $5 million in improvement dollars when it signed a lease for nearly 41,000 square feet of Mac Haik\u2019s Energy Tower II at 11720 Katy Freeway.\n",

What is clear, Jenkins said, is that the next jail will not sit between Dallas\u2019 two iconic Calatrava bridges, where the current complex occupies highly visible land along the Trinity River. State law requires the jail to remain within four miles of the county courthouse, narrowing the field but still leaving several potential sites in play.\nJenkins said the county expects to purchase land for the new facility later this year, a key step that would solidify plans and start the clock on what would be one of the region\u2019s largest public-sector developments in decades.\nThe relocation could be just as consequential as the jail itself, as vacating the current site would free up a large swath of prime riverfront land near downtown, a parcel that has already been floated as a potential site for a new arena for the\nDallas Mavericks\n, among other high-profile redevelopment concepts.\nThe jail sits on 15 acres of riverfront land owned by the county. The property is valued at $109 million, appraisal district records show.\n\u201cIf you were building a jail now, you probably wouldn\u2019t build it right in the middle of the postcard, front door of Dallas,\u201d Jenkins told the outlet.\nJenkins emphasized that the new jail will be designed to emphasize mental health treatment and lower recidivism, an improvement from the current situation, which cycles inmates through an outdated facility.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A struggling mall outside of Chicago could be headed for a comeback.\nChicago-based commercial real estate firm Xroads Real Estate Advisors bought Lincolnwood Town Center this week for $12.3 million, completing a massive dropoff for a property dragged through a lengthy and costly\nforeclosure process\n.\nThe 31 acre property at 3333 West Touhy Avenue and McCormick Boulevard was previously owned by Washington Prime Group before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2022. The last loan on the property was issued in 2014 for $52.8 million, signaling a staggering loss in value over the past decade.\nEventually, Keybank took over the property before selling it to Xroads. The loan became the subject of a nearly $50 million foreclosure lawsuit in 2021. The new owner plans to work with the Village of Lincolnwood to \u201cre-imagine what this site can become,\u201d Xroads President Kirsten Bowersox said.\nThe move comes not long after the village of Lincolnwood considered taking over the site via\neminent domain\nas a last-ditch effort to bring the faltering mall back to life. But now the town has an easier path ahead that avoids\nthe legal\nchallenges of pursuing a takeover of the property\u2019s ownership.\nA redevelopment blueprint, the \u201cLincolnwood Town Center Concept Plan,\u201d was adopted by the Village Board in 2022, laying out mixed-use scenarios that include apartments, offices and entertainment.\nMall giant Simon Properties developed the mall over 30 years ago. Former Simon subsidiary Washington Prime became the sole owner of the property in 2014 when Simon spun off Washington Prime and it became an independent public company.\nLincolnwood Town Center was once dubbed \u201cthe largest redevelopment opportunity within Chicago\u2019s inner-ring suburbs,\u201d by Chicago\u2019s local NBC affiliate. The mall has cycled through owners and foreclosure proceedings for years. JLL was tapped to market it for sale in 2022.\nLincolnwood Town Center has long been a casualty of suburban malls\u2019 slow-motion collapse. Its largest anchor, Carson\u2019s, shuttered in 2018, and got replaced by RoomPlace, which has 84,000 square feet.\nToday, Kohl\u2019s is the main draw with a footprint of 102,000 square feet, alongside about three dozen smaller tenants, but swaths of space sit empty. The mall was 81 percent occupied as of the fall of 2025.\nJLL\u2019s marketing materials pitched the 423,000-square-foot center as a \u201c1990 vintage property\u201d ripe for repositioning. The firm highlights Lincolnwood\u2019s support for a new owner, existing lease structures and the potential to introduce multifamily, office and service retail to the site.\nThe recent sale also comes as other large Chicagoland malls have\nundergone major renovations or redevelopment\nand new\ninvestments in suburban shopping centers\nthat are primed for upgrades in the Chicago area are picking up.\nAt least one shopping center in the Chicago area has bucked the trend of suburban shopping malls taking a nosedive.\nBrookfield Properties\u2019 Oakbrook Center in Oakbrook\nhas seen a slew of new retailers\nas property values in the area reach new heights.\n",

        "content": "Leadership turmoil is rippling through Saks Global as the luxury retailer braces for a potential bankruptcy that could further complicate the future of Neiman Marcus and its presence in Downtown Dallas.\nMarc Metrick stepped down as CEO of Saks Global, the parent of Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, with executive chairman Richard Baker assuming the top role, the company announced in a Jan. 2 news release. The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat Metrick, a nearly 30-year company veteran, led Saks through its $2.7 billion acquisition of Dallas-based Neiman Marcus Group in 2024.\nBaker\nwill guide what Saks called the company\u2019s ongoing transformation.\nThe change comes days after Saks missed an interest payment of more than $100 million tied to debt from the Neiman Marcus deal, the Wall Street Journal first reported. The lapse has fueled expectations of an imminent Chapter 11 filing or asset sales as the company grapples with heavy leverage, soft luxury demand and a tough retail environment.\nThe uncertainty lands squarely on Dallas-based Neiman Marcus, the storied retailer whose real estate has already been in flux. Early in 2025 Saks announced plans to close Neiman\u2019s flagship store at 1618 Main Street, then repeatedly delayed the move after pushback from\ncity leaders\n, stating it would remain open beyond the 2025 holiday season as talks continue with the city on a potential reimagining of the nine-story property.\nThe fate of the historic downtown anchor remains unresolved, with possibilities ranging from a continued retail presence to a reimagining as a mixed-use destination or conversion to apartments or a hotel.\nDowntown Dallas Incorporated CEO Jennifer Scripps told the publication last week that negotiations with the city on an economic development package are ongoing but unresolved.\nOther Neiman properties have already changed hands. The retailer recently sold its Beverly Hills store at 9700 Wilshire Boulevard, which it occupied since 1979, while continuing to operate there, the Los Angeles Times reported. In North Texas, Neiman sold its three-level store at The Shops at Willow Bend in\nPlano\nas the mall undergoes a major redevelopment.\nEarlier this year, Saks also disclosed plans to shutter Neiman\u2019s headquarters at\nCityplace Tower\nin Dallas after just two years. Owner NexPoint initially contested the move before pivoting to a $445 million redevelopment that includes residential and hotel components.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "We\u2019re just a few days into the Mamdani administration, and we\u2019re already acronym and task force-rich.\nMuch has happened since Zohran Mamdani took office on Jan. 1. He has:\n\u2026rebooted a tenant-focused office,\nnaming\nCea Weaver as its director;\n\u2026named Dina Levy, who works for the state\u2019s Division of Homes and Community Renewal, as the new commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development;\n\u2026ordered city agencies to hold \u201c\nrental ripoff\n\u201d hearings;\n\u2026announced that he\u2019s\nintervening\nin Pinnacle Group\u2019s bankruptcy.\nAnd while much sets Mamdani apart from his predecessor, the new mayor has continued some initiatives spearheaded by Mayor Eric Adams. On his first day in office, Mamdani signed executive orders that created interagency task forces to study two issues that were also the focus of previous task forces created during the Adams administration.\nOne is dubbed the Streamlining Procedures to Expedite Equitable Development, or SPEED, task force. That group aims to identify policies and procedures that \u201caffect the timely production and availability of affordable housing, including such policies and procedures affecting pre- and post-construction approvals, project financing, and project marketing,\u201d and propose ways to expedite affordable housing construction.\nThat\u2019s similar to the goals of the\nBuilding and Land Use Approval Streamlining Taskforce\n, or BLAST, which was launched during the Adams administration and took some liberties with spelling and letter inclusion to make BLAST work.\nA separate executive order creates the Land Inventory Fast Track, or LIFT, task force, which will identify city-owned or -controlled properties where housing can be built. Adams signed a similar executive order in 2024 and launched the \u201c24 in \u201824\u201d initiative to advance 24 projects on city sites that year.\nIt remains to be seen how these new task forces will build on the findings of those previous groups.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat real estate-related issues will you be looking for in Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s State of the State address? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Fiorello La Guardia was the first New York City mayor to call Gracie Mansion\nhome\n. He preferred to call it the Mayor\u2019s House or Gracie Farm because \u201cmansion was a little rich for his taste,\u201d according to a 1979 New York Times story.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 During the first year of congestion pricing, 27 million fewer vehicles entered Manhattan below 60th Street,\nGothamist reports\n. Compared to the previous year, when congestion pricing was not in effect, that area saw an 11 percent reduction in daily traffic, on average.\n\u2014 The Queens Democratic Party on Monday endorsed Diana Moreno ahead of the Feb. 3 special election for Zohran Mamdani\u2019s former Assembly seat,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. Moreno has also been endorsed by Mamdani and the New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America.\n\u2014 Mamdani signed two executive orders on Monday to ramp up enforcement against businesses that trick consumers into paying hidden \u201cjunk fees\u201d and those that have misleading subscription services (including free trials that automatically convert into paid subscriptions \u201cwith critical disclosures buried in fine print or behind hyper links\u201d).\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$4.4 million\nfor 75 1/2 Bedford Street. The West Village townhouse is 1,000 square feet and last sold on the market for $3.4 million in 2023.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$52.9 million\nfor a portfolio of buildings in Rego Park. The properties include 94-14 63rd Drive, 95-38 Queens Boulevard, 63-79 Saunders Street, 95-40 Queens Boulevard, 95-60 63rd Drive, 96-44 Queens Boulevard and two retail properties at 95-05 and 95-02 63rd Drive. The total square footage of all addresses exceeds 60,000. The buyer was the Malachite Group, and the seller was Imperial Sterling Corp.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $12.5 million for a co-op unit at 1107 Fifth Avenue. The Upper East Side co-op is listed by\nColdwell Banker Warburg\u2019s\nBonnie Chajet and Lisa Ellen Chajet.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 90,355-square-foot, 11-story, mixed-use building at 270 West 135th Street in Harlem. Tahir Demircioglu Architect is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

The 19th-century home has had a host of famous residents, including Cary Grant, John Barrymore and Edna St. Vincent Millay, after whom the house is named.

        "content": "The law firm representing embattled developer Meyer Chetrit wants out.\nBaron Samson has accused members of the Chetrit family of failing to cooperate with counsel and not paying legal bills, with the law firm allegedly no longer able to trust information from its clients.\nIt\u2019s unusual to see these sorts of public accusations from an attorney about their client, but nothing about Chetrit\u2019s past year has been typical. The developer is battling a $132 million judgement owed to an entity of Maverick Real Estate Partners after a foreclosure case, as well as criminal charges of tenant harassment.\n\u201c[P]romises of cooperation were made and broken many times over the months,\u201d attorney Elliott Joffe wrote in a legal affirmation to support his firm\u2019s effort to withdraw as Chetrit\u2019s attorney in several cases. \u201cI do not fully understand the difficulties.\u201d\nJoffe said recent communications with the Chetrits had also raised questions about \u201cpotential conflicts of interest\u201d between Meyer and brother Joseph Chetrit, who both head The Chetrit Group.\nJoffe has represented Meyer Chetrit in litigation tied to the Maverick foreclosure and in a separate matter involving Mack Real Estate Group. In the affirmation he said he also had frequent contact with Joseph Chetrit and the Chetrit Group staff.\nBut Joffe allegedly ran into issues \u201calmost immediately\u201d getting his clients to cooperate.\n\u201c[S]ome of my requests for information and cooperation remained unfulfilled for months after I first made them despite repetition and promises of compliance,\u201d Joffe wrote in the affirmation. That resulted in missed deadlines and, in some cases, contempt applications. And at the same time, the Chetrit\u2019s expectations of his services grew, he said, creating an \u201cexplosion of additional work.\u201d\nAs the work snowballed, payment stopped, Joffe alleges. Baron Samson\u2019s most recent invoice is so far unpaid with a significant amount due, according to the affirmation. The firm\u2019s retainer deposit has been depleted and not replenished.\nThose factors have all led to a \u201cdeteriorating relationship\u201d between the Chetrits and the firm.\n\u201cInteractions which were once cordial have become contentious, to say the least,\u201d Joffe wrote.\nFinally, the affirmation refers somewhat opaquely to potential conflicts of interest between brothers Meyer and Joseph Chetrit, with Joffe referring to attorney client privilege as to why he couldn\u2019t say more.\n\u201c[W]e have become concerned that these conflicts, if genuine, could impair our ability to represent either or both effectively,\u201d the affirmation reads. \u201cIndeed, it may be that these conflicts are responsible for some or all of the lack of cooperation we have received.\u201d\nJoffe does not appear to have represented Joseph Chetrit in any suit specifically, and Joseph is not named as a defendant in the cases related to Maverick or Mack.\nJoffe did not respond to a request for further comment. His affirmation was posted briefly on the court\u2019s portal, but then returned for correction.",

He also announced that the city will \u201cintervene\u201d in a bankruptcy case that will decide the fate of thousands of rent-stabilized apartments.\nDuring Mamdani\u2019s first 100 days in office, the administration will host\nhearings\nfor tenants to sound off about their landlords and living conditions, dubbed \u201cRental Ripoff\u201d hearings.\nThese actions underscore a point the mayor made during his inauguration address, that he will not moderate or scale back on pledges he made while campaigning for mayor. He reiterated his promise to freeze rents and to \u201ctake on the bad landlords who mistreat their tenants.\u201d\n\u201cI was elected as a Democratic socialist and I will govern as a Democratic socialist,\u201d he said. \u201cI will not abandon my principles for fear of being deemed radical.\u201d\nReal estate professionals are closely watching the first days of the administration unfold. Seth Glasser, a multifamily broker with Marcus &amp; Millichap, wasn\u2019t surprised by Mamdani\u2019s first moves as mayor.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t just wake up today and think \u2018this guy doesn\u2019t like landlords,\u2019\u201d he said.\nHe noted that the city\u2019s involvement in Pinnacle Group\u2019s\nbankruptcy case\ncould create uncertainty around how the government will intervene in private deals going forward, which could scare away investors and lenders.\n\u201cThe one thing you can\u2019t underwrite is government intervention,\u201d he said.\nOn his first day in office, Mamdani signed three housing-related executive orders. One relaunched the\ndefunct\nOffice to Protect Tenants, giving it a more specific mandate than its predecessor to \u201cpromote tenants\u2019 interests and concerns\u201d and develop \u201cpolicy changes to strengthen tenants\u2019 rights.\u201d The order also leaves the door open for the mayor to assign the office more responsibility.\nHe named tenant organizer\nCea Weaver\nas the director of the Office to Protect Tenants. Weaver, who heads tenant advocacy groups Housing Justice for All and the New York State Tenant Bloc and was a policy advisor to Mamdani during his campaign, played a major role in the passage of the 2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act, which closed off most ways that landlords can increase rents on stabilized apartments.\nJoanne Grell, a rent-stabilized tenant and co-chair of the NYS Tenant Bloc\u2019s rent freeze campaign, said in a statement that Weaver\u2019s appointment \u201cmakes clear that Mayor Mamdani is serious about following through on his commitment to protect tenants.\u201d\nOne of the office\u2019s first actions was to\nintervene\nin Pinnacle Group\u2019s bankruptcy and the Jan. 8 auction that would transfer 5,100 rent-stabilized apartments in the owner\u2019s portfolio. As of Monday, the city hasn\u2019t filed anything in federal court, but Weaver told the New York Times that the goal is to ensure that the new owner pursues repairs and complies with rent-stabilization laws.\nKenny Burgos, CEO of the New York Apartment Association, said he is not against the city helping Pinnacle\u2019s tenants organize to buy the building, but doing so would cost millions of dollars. He also said taking such action should come with the recognition that there are many other rent-stabilized buildings in similar situations and that broader action is needed to help struggling owners.\nThe mayor signed an executive order directing the Office to Protect Tenants, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, the Department of Buildings and the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection to host \u201cRental Ripoff\u201d hearings. The hearings will focus on \u201cillegal, unfair, abusive, deceptive, or unconscionable landlord practices\u201d as well as \u201coperational improvements that the City should adopt to strengthen housing and building code enforcement.\u201d\nThe order indicates that the city wants to hear from landlords in addition to tenants, tenant advocacy groups and others.\n\u201cI want New Yorkers who have long been ignored by their landlords to finally be heard by our city government,\u201d Mamdani said during a press conference announcing the hearings, noting that the hearings won\u2019t simply be \u201clistening sessions\u201d but will help shape policy.\nWithin 90 days of the final hearing, the city agencies must issue a report detailing common issues raised and a plan for addressing them.\nBurgos described the hearings as \u201cperformative\u201d and in service of justifying the mayor\u2019s campaign promises.\n\u201cHe\u2019s clearly trying to build a narrative for a rent freeze,\u201d he said. \u201cThe data is not going to support a rent freeze, and he knows that, so he needs to create a public campaign of vibes instead of real numbers.\u201d\nMamdani also signed orders that continued initiatives started under the Adams administration. One such order creates a task force to study ways to speed up affordable housing construction, similar to the goals of one\nlaunched\nby the Adams administration. Another task force will identify city-owned or controlled sites where housing can be built. Adams\nissued\na similar order in 2024.\n",

        "content": "Mack Real Estate Group took control of a Hudson Yards development site long tied up in litigation with the Chetrit Group.\nMack closed on a $94 million title transfer for a vacant parcel at 545 West 37th Street, PincusCo\nreported\n. Mack acquired the site from a Chetrit affiliate in a deal that closed Dec. 18 and was recorded Jan. 2.\nThe transaction values the site at about $543 per buildable square foot, based on 172,00 square feet of unused development rights and no existing built space.\nMack and Chetrit did not immediately respond to requests for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe transaction caps a years-long unraveling of Chetrit\u2019s plans for the site, which sits just west of Hudson Yards proper. Chetrit bought the parcel in 2012 for $26.5 million and later filed plans for a 131-unit, 373,000-square-foot hotel, a project permitted in late 2021. But construction never moved forward and there have been no permit filings since 2022.\nInstead, the property became the subject of courtroom drama.\nThree years ago, Chetrit\ndefaulted\non an $85 million loan tied to the property. The debt \u2014 a $53.7 million senior loan and $31.3 million mezzanine loan \u2014\nwas issued in 2018\nby JPMorgan Chase and Mack, the latter of which became the sole owner of the debt, collateralized by the full equity interest in the site.\nMack won a judgment tied to an $18.5 million loan connected to the site last year. The firm also pursued a carry guarantee suit \u2014 related to guarantors\u2019 funding shortfalls \u2014 that remains technically active, though court records show no filings since October.\nIn the\nsummer\n, two lenders, including Mack, argued that Meyer Chetrit\u2019s maneuvers around a $21.7 million debt to his late brother Jacob\u2019s estate were an attempt to hide assets from creditors.\nMack and Maverick Financial are trying to recover $220 million and $132 million, respectively, from Meyer.\nBack to the site itself, the 17,000-square-foot lot is zoned for commercial or residential development with inclusionary housing. City records pegged its market value at $14.6 million in 2022.\nFor Mack, the takeover adds another development opportunity to a portfolio skewed towards hospitality. Roughly a quarter of the firm\u2019s New York City square footage is in hotels, according to PincusCo.\nFor Chetrit, the transfer trims a portfolio that still spans nearly 40 city properties with more than $1.6 billion in debt. The firm has not bought any New York City assets in the past two years, per PincusCo.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The apartment last traded in 2022 to an anonymous buyer for just over $20 million. It hit the market again a year ago with a $27 million price tag.\nThe 3,400-square-foot condo has two bedrooms and two bathrooms. It also features a home theater and a terrace with a pool.\nThe second most expensive property to enter contract was Unit 16B, with an asking price of $21.5 million. The condo was purchased by a Thailand-based investor for $20.7 million in August 2024 and hit the market again roughly six months later.\nAmie Buchanan, who led the in-house sales team at the project, had both listings.\nAnother 18th-floor unit at the building topped the borough\u2019s luxury market in December when it found a buyer with an asking price just under\n$30 million\n. The seller bought the apartment from the developer for $35 million in 2022.\nThe building nabbed its\nfirst resale\nin July 2024, four years after the developer launched sales of the 22 units atop the historic Crown Building. Unit 23A traded for $64 million, up from the $51 million the seller paid for it earlier that year.\nOf the 13 properties to find buyers, six were condos, three were co-ops, one was a condop and three were townhouses.\nThe homes asked a combined $113 million, which works out to an average of $8.7 million and a median of $6.5 million. The typical home was on the market for less than a year and had a discount of 7 percent.\n",

        "content": "The developers planning a 60-home neighborhood in\nGlenview\ntook over the site in December after village leaders gave it final approval.\nHighland Park-based Generation 4, led by\nKeith Jacobs, formerly of the Jacobs Companies\n, and Red Seal Homes \u2014 a Nashville-based firm with an office in Northbrook \u2014 purchased the 19.4-acre former Scott Foresman site at 1900 East Lake Avenue in Glenview for $14 million in December, according to property records. Chicago-based investment firm R2 was the seller.\nIn a joint venture with Wheaton-based T2 Capital Management, R2 purchased the site for $10.7 million in 2022 after the previous owners faced foreclosure, property records show. The now-vacant building on the lot was previously operated by Scott Foresman, a publisher of school textbooks.\nSales for the 60 lots on the site are already in progress, with prices ranging from $399,900 to $725,000. KC Kaage, a Compass agent whose team Kaage Homes is leading sales of the lots, said 24 of the 60 lots are currently under contract.\nFor most of the lots, buyers will be able to work with designers and builders to build custom homes, Kaage said. The developers will build a few spec houses on the land, with Kaage Homes leading design, he said.\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for people to customize their home to their tastes, to their liking,\u201d he said. \u201cThey control the budget, and it provides a unique opportunity that hasn\u2019t been seen in several decades here in Glenview.\u201d\nRed Seal Homes did not respond to requests for comment, and Jacobs declined to comment.\nMatt Garrison, CEO of R2, said the firm expected to flip the site into a residential development since it took it over. R2\nput the site on the market\nin 2023 after a\nprevious developer\u2019s proposal\nto turn the site into rental housing got rejected. Garrison said there was interest from buyers for other uses, but residential was the best fit.\n\u201cIn this case, with a 20 acre land site near downtown Glenview, it was clear from day one that this was likely a residential development site,\u201d he said.\nThe development, which was pitched as primarily marketed to empty-nesters, gained final village approval in December. Throughout the permitting process, the Glenview Village Board of Trustees wanted to ensure the lots were purchased by empty-nesters and limit the number of new school-aged children the development would add to the local district.\nThe village is requiring 75 percent of the homes built on the site to be ranch-style or have the primary bedroom on the first floor, according to city documents, in an attempt to appeal to the cohort.\nKaage said he could not share the demographics of the people under contract for the lots. The village\u2019s preferences for the first-floor bedrooms has \u201cproven to be very attractive to the market, given the lack of inventory right now,\u201d he said.\nThe developers plan to begin interior demolition on the vacant building in the next two weeks, Kaage said, and exterior demolition will begin in February. The building contains a time capsule installed by the education company, which the developers plan to hand over to the village, Kaage said.\nAfter demolition, the developers will begin preparing the lots by building utilities, roads and other infrastructure, Kaage said. He is expecting lots to be handed over to buyers by late spring.\n",

        "content": "Sterling Bay is continuing to unwind its North Side land holdings tied to the ill-fated Lincoln Yards megaproject, selling another development site near the formerly envisioned campus.\nAn affiliate of Calgary, Alberta-based Jack Carter Automotive Group paid $15.5 million last month for two neighboring parcels at 1642 North Besly Court and 1400 West North Avenue, according to Cook County property records. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthe buyer acquired the properties from a Sterling Bay venture that had assembled the sites more than seven years ago as part of its push to control land around Lincoln Yards.\nThe deal further shrinks Sterling Bay\u2019s\npresence\nin the stretch between Lincoln Park and Bucktown, where the Chicago-based developer once pitched a $6 billion, 53-acre mixed-use district spanning roughly 14.5 million square feet. After struggling to secure financing and land anchor tenants, Sterling Bay surrendered much of the Lincoln Yards site to its lender early last year and is now finalizing a deal to sell most of its remaining interest in the project to\nNovak Construction\n.\nAs the megaproject faded, Sterling Bay has been steadily offloading nearby properties it once viewed as strategic. In 2023, the firm sold a 122,000-square-foot industrial building at 1854 North Besly Court, just a few blocks north of the parcels that traded last month.\nPublic records show Sterling Bay acquired the North Avenue and Besly Court sites in separate deals in 2017 and 2018 for a combined $13.8 million, part of a broader land-grab aimed at giving the firm flexibility to expand or reshape Lincoln Yards if the vision took hold. At the time, Sterling Bay was aggressively buying up industrial and commercial properties throughout the corridor.\nOne of the parcels, at 1400 West North Avenue, had been teed up for redevelopment. Sterling Bay previously proposed a roughly 100,000-square-foot medical office building at the site, with marketing materials highlighting its visibility along the Kennedy Expressway and proximity to the planned Lincoln Yards\ncampus\n.\nThe\nproperties\ninclude vacant land, a surface parking lot and an industrial building. The area has become a hub for luxury auto retailers, with dealerships for Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Acura and Lexus clustered nearby. The North Avenue site was formerly home to Nortown Automotive, which has since relocated a few blocks east.\nBoth Sterling Bay and the Jack Carter Automotive Group did not respond to requests for comment from the publication. The company operates multiple auto dealerships, power sports outlets and a bicycle store across Canada.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The deal marks the largest one signed at the\nOyster Point development\nsince 2019 when Stripe took about 420,000 square feet in the project\u2019s first phase.\nTerms of the lease, including rent price, were not disclosed.

The university will open the new facility in early 2029.\nThe San Francisco university has been in expansion mode across the Bay Area over the past two years.

UCSF\u2019s School of Dentistry will relocate to 409 Illinois Street, as the school plans to turn the approximately 280,000-square-foot building into dental clinics and a 60,000-square-foot education center for students enrolled in the university\u2019s dentistry, medicine, nursing, pharmacy and physical therapy programs. Work is expected to kick off this year and finish in 2029. The school already occupies the adjacent 499 Illinois Street building.\nKilroy began work on the second phase of Kilroy Oyster Point in 2021. As of the third quarter of last year, prior to UCSF\u2019s new deal, the company inked 84,000 square feet in new leases.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A show trial is \u201cheld in public with the intention of influencing or satisfying public opinion, rather than of ensuring justice,\u201d according to Oxford.\nThat sounds like what Mayor Zohran Mamdani\u2019s \u201c\nrental ripoff\n\u201d hearings will be. His executive order asks tenants and activists to testify about \u201cillegal, unfair, abusive, deceptive, or unconscionable landlord practices.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t call for testimony about unfair,\nabusive\nor\nunconscionable\npractices by tenants, although landlords have lots of\nhorror stories\n. His order doesn\u2019t request facts about how laws and economic forces have made maintaining rent-stabilized housing so\nchallenging\n.\nNo, these hearings are only for landlord shaming.\nNew York City has thousands of landlords. Of course some are\nbad apples\n. In a functional housing market, with ample housing supply and no rent regulation, bad landlords would go out of business because tenants would move.\nBut Mamdani favors price controls, where tenants stay with a bad landlord because the rent is kept artificially low \u2014 as is the vacancy rate, so tenants can\u2019t easily move.\nInstead of normalcy, where landlords and tenants try to make each other happy, our system relies on enforcement, which is always going to fall short. This will be a recurring narrative at the \u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings.\nBut is it fair to call them show trials? How do we know that \u201censuring justice\u201d isn\u2019t the aim of these hearings?\nFor one thing, no one will be fact-checking, rebutting or even questioning any testimony. For an example of how this might go, at Mamdani\u2019s press conference announcing the hearings, tenant activist Fitzroy Christian complained about being charged for scratching the floors of his rent-stabilized apartment.\n\u201cWhen I want to clean under my bed, and I want to clean under my couch, and I want to clean behind my dressers, I have to pull them away. When they scratch the floors, the landlord says I damaged the floors, and I get billed for damages. And that becomes a permanent part of my rent.\u201d\nAt a real trial, a lawyer might ask Christian these questions:\nWho should pay to repair floors damaged by a tenant?\nWhat other damages caused by tenants should they not have to pay for?\nHow does a fee for scratching your floors become a permanent part of your rent?\nIf you must move furniture, why not buy\nsliders for $5.99\n?\nWho is really damaging apartments \u2014 neat freaks who clean under sofas and beds? Or troubled tenants who punch holes in walls, clog pipes and\nabuse dogs\n?\nChristian also cited\na report\npublished \u201cnot too long ago\u201d about fees that make affordable housing unaffordable. The report was published in 2013.\nA lot has changed since. The Rent Guidelines Board kept rent increases below the rate of inflation for\n10 consecutive years\n. The 2019 rent law eliminated the 20 percent vacancy bonus and essentially banned renovations.\nInsurance premiums\nsoared,\nwater rates\njumped and property taxes kept going up. Some tenants\nstopped paying rent\nand it became\nextremely difficult\nto evict them.\nUnable to boost revenue to match these cost increases, landlords cut back on maintenance. It will be impossible at Mamdani\u2019s \u201cripoff\u201d hearings to tell which landlords ignored violations because of malice or because of math.\nIncidentally, Mamdani\u2019s order says landlords can speak at his hearings. But that is kind of like inviting sheep to a gathering of wolves. I highly doubt Bronx landlord Les Lerner will testify about how tenants game the system, as he explained last year to\nThe Real Deal\n:\n\u201cHPD has designed a system that\nallows tenants to weaponize violations\n, and housing court has designed a system whereby violations and repairs prevent non-payment cases from advancing. This is all an orchestrated scheme to prevent evictions.\u201d\nLandlords will surely be hammered at the mayor\u2019s show trials. But should they be worried about anything besides being portrayed as demons? Yes.\nShow trials are not just to let people vent. They aim to grease the skids so some action can be taken without anyone stopping it.\nBoth parties practice political theater. When Mamdani was in grade school, congressional Republicans held hearings to publicize fabricated or exaggerated IRS abuses, after which they slashed the agency\u2019s budget. About one of every six dollars owed in federal taxes now goes\nuncollected\n.\nThe worst show trials, such as in Communist China or Stalin\u2019s Russia, result in executions. Mamdani is not in that realm of evil, but he likely plans something.\nA probable goal is to enact\nCOPA\nor otherwise transfer ownership of distressed buildings to mission-driven nonprofits. Never mind that these organizations \u2014 and the Housing Authority \u2014 are\nstruggling\nto maintain their own rental buildings, despite not having to pay property taxes.\nAt the very least, by turning public opinion even further against landlords, the hearings will make it harder to launch programs or pass laws that help them pay for repairs.\nA key question is how much power tenant activist\nCea Weaver\n\u2014 whom Mamdani put in charge of a revamped\nOffice to Protect Tenants\n\u2014 will have. Weaver has made clear she believes for-profit ownership is the cause of the housing crisis.\nWill she be kept in check by more moderate, higher-ranking Mamdani aides such as Deputy Mayor\nLeila Bozorg\n? Will new HPD Commissioner Dina Levy be reasonable or ideological?\nThe best-case scenario is that now that Mamdani has the keys to the kingdom, he will realize no secret remedies for housing violations have been hidden within its walls. Unfortunately, the \u201crental ripoff\u201d show trials will only promote scapegoating, conspiracy theories and magical thinking, making real solutions even harder to achieve.\n",

        "content": "Robert Rivani is going after restaurateur Derek Gonzalez of Goat Hospitality Group for $10.5 million over a failed plan to open a steakhouse in Wynwood.\nRivani claims in court filings that Gonzalez\u2019s WGOAT15 owes $9.1 million in rent through 2035, plus taxes and common area maintenance, the South Florida Business Journal\nreported\n.\nGonzalez signed a lease in 2024 to open Mia Steakhouse at Rivani\u2019s\nWynwood Jungle\nbuilding at 50 Northwest 24th Street in Miami. Last summer, Rivani\u2019s entities RJR Realty and RJR ML sued Gonzalez\u2019s affiliate, claiming it failed to pay May and June rent, and didn\u2019t open on time.\nRivani won possession of the property in August, but is now claiming damages against Gonzalez.\nRivani\nis an investor who moved his company in 2022 from Los Angeles to Miami, scooping up restaurant spaces and commercial buildings. In Miami Beach, he owns and is renovating the seven-story Rivani office building at 1691 Washington Avenue, where\nPlayboy\u2019s parent company\nwill move its headquarters.\nGonzalez\u2019s Goat Hospitality\u2019s venues include\nLuna Sol Night Club\nin Wynwood.\nRivani and Gonzalez are locked in the dispute partly over who was responsible for what payments. Under their agreement, Gonzalez was to pay for the restaurant\u2019s interior buildout and start paying rent early last year. Rivani was to cover the costs for the architect and interior designer.\nGonzalez said in a deposition that he thinks Rivani\u2019s entities led to the restaurant\u2019s opening delay partly by failing to release construction funds. Gonzalez also admitted that he didn\u2019t meet thresholds for the money to be released such as finishing the buildout.\nIn a countersuit against Rivani filed last week, Gonzalez again accused Rivani\u2019s affiliates of failing to pay for architects, interior designers and other agreed vendors, stalling the project.\nThe landlord also didn\u2019t provide electrical utility meters for the property, according to the counterclaim. Gonzalez claimed he was led to sign the lease partly by the landlord\u2019s false claims about other tenants signing up for space at Wynwood Jungle, including rapper Machine Gun Kelly.\nLisa Gonzalez, who is Gonzalez\u2019s attorney and wife, said that Mia Steakhouse didn\u2019t open because of the landlord\u2019s failures to meet its responsibilities, and that lease amendments were signed under pressure. She also said the dispute is part of\nbroader issues\nbetween the landlord and other tenants at Wynwood Jungle.\nThe lease terms were amended several times last year.\nAttorneys for Rivani\u2019s affiliates didn\u2019t respond to the outlet\u2019s request for comment. In court filings, they have reiterated that the landlord was on the hook only to pay the architects and interior designers.\u00a0\u2013\u2013\nLidia Dinkova\n",

        "content": "David Herro\nwill be sporting a haircut when he exits the Palmolive Building.\nThe deputy chairman of Harris Associates found a buyer for his full-floor condo in the Magnificent Mile building at 159 East Walton Place on Monday, marking the end of a five-year search to offload the property that saw its\nasking price slashed by nearly half\n.\nThe 31st-floor unit went under contract Monday with a price of just under $6 million, listing data shows. While the sale is not final and the ultimate price isn\u2019t known, the current asking price is a 45 percent drop from the $10.9 million Herro sought when he first listed in July 2020.\nAt $6 million, the sale would mark a loss for Herro, who paid $6.75 million for the unit in December 2013 \u2014 about $9.5 million in today\u2019s money, adjusting for inflation \u2014 property records show.\nThe three-bedroom, four-bathroom condo spans 5,500 square feet and features a renovation by Liederbach &amp; Graham Architects and interiors by Steven Gambrel that landed the home a\nfeature in Elle Decor\nin 2017. The unit comes with four spaces in a heated garage, a private elevator and three fireplaces.\nIt carries a hefty $9,230 monthly homeowner\u2019s association fee, and had a 2024 property tax bill of about $67,000, according to property records.\nThe unit\u2019s hard sell was a result of a downtown market that languished in the years after it was offered for sale. Other luxury condos at the top of the market, including\nKen Griffin\u2019s penthouse\nat 800 North Michigan Avenue and\nBill Farley\u2019s condo\nat 209 East Lakeshore Drive have also had to cut prices to find buyers after years on the market.\nAfter first listing for $10.9 million, Herro cut the price to $9.9 million in late 2020, then to $8.9 million in 2022 and $7.5 million in 2023. He pulled the listing in July 2024 before relisting it in September 2025 at $6.75 million, the same price he paid a decade prior.\nThe final price chop to $6 million came in December, just a month before the unit went under contract.\nKen Jungwirth of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate represents the listing. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nDespite the steep losses, if the condo fetches the $6 million asking price, it would be among the most expensive units to sell at the Palmolive building in the last few years. The 32nd-floor penthouse sold for $5.2 million in 2023, while the 23rd-floor unit brought in\njust under $5.2 million\nin February 2025, according to listing records.\n",

        "content": "The new year hasn\u2019t turned the page on Texas\ncommercial real estate distress\nafter loans flagged for foreclosure neared $1 billion in December.\nThe value of troubled loans backed by properties in the Texas Triangle headed to auction this month surpasses $826 million, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service \u2014 a dip from\nDecember\u2019s high of $911 million\n, but still far above prior months where the value hovered around $600 million.\nMost of the troubled loans are tied to\nmultifamily\nproperties, but, this month, loans tied to hotels made up 19 percent of the value of debt flagged for foreclosure. Harris County, home to Houston, is reliably the hardest hit and was again this month, with 11 loans topping a cumulative $300 million, and, for January\u2019s sale, Dallas County isn\u2019t far behind. More than $280 million worth of loans tied to Dallas properties are facing foreclosure this month.\nHere are the biggest loans up for auction. It\u2019s possible that some of these borrowers and lenders will reach agreements to avoid auction.\nHouston\nMultifamily distress hit Houston hard in 2025, but the largest loan headed to auction this month isn\u2019t tied to an apartment complex. Miami-based Terra Hospitality is facing foreclosure on Heritage Place Houston Brookhollow, a 197-key hotel at 2504 North Loop West in Northwest Houston. Terra reportedly defaulted on a $50.9 million loan provided by Wells Fargo tied to the property.\nAustin\nBrennen Degner\u2019s DB Capital Management could lose an Austin apartment building to foreclosure this month. The Denver-based firm is accused of defaulting on the $14.3 million loan backed by Ascent at Northgate, a 112-unit apartment complex at 1830 West Rundberg Lane. ReadyCap Commercial provided the loan in 2021, deed records show. It works out to $127,678 per unit for the property built in 1972. The loan was assigned to Los Angeles-based Ascendant Capital Partners in August.\nSan Antonio\nIt\u2019s most common to see apartment buildings from the 1970s on the auction block, but that\u2019s not the case with Broadstone Colonnade Apartments. The 280-unit property at 4330 Spectrum One was built in 2005. David Shippy\u2019s Quantum Leap Multifamily Group bought the property in 2022 with a $40 million loan from CBRE, which comes out to $142,857 per unit.\nQuantum Leap partnered with Edcouch Community Housing Finance Corporation to get property tax breaks on the property, using a loophole known as a \u201ctraveling\u201d housing finance corporation. Quantum Leap sold the property to Edcouch, an affordable housing organization 250 miles from San Antonio, and leased the ground. Gov. Greg Abbott\nsigned a bill\nclosing the loophole, which became a popular cost-cutting tool for multifamily syndicators and investors.\nDallas\nWhen it seems like there\u2019s nothing left for\nTides Equities\nto lose, the embattled syndicator gets hit with another foreclosure notice. This time, the firm owned by Sean Kia and Ryan Andrade could lose Tides at Highland Meadows, a 650-unit apartment complex at 11330 Amanda Lane in Dallas. New York-based Mack Real Estate Credit Strategies provided the $76.4 million loan tied to the property built in 1984. It works out to $117,461 per unit.\nFort Worth\nBruce Hall\u2019s AllTrades Industrial Properties could lose a 3.5-acre plot of land at 5001 Golden Triangle Boulevard in Fort Worth at this month\u2019s auction. AllTrades Industrial Properties bought the property in 2022 with a $5.8 million loan from Susser Bank.\nRepeat offenders\nOf the properties scheduled for auction, 12 have been flagged for foreclosure multiple times, sometimes reflecting a loan modification or ongoing litigation. Here are the properties that have been to the block before:\nLatitude 2976, a 734-unit apartment complex at 201 and 301 Wilcrest Drive in Houston ($77.2 million);\nMia Riverside, a 312-unit complex at 1601 Royal Crest Drive in Austin ($50.2 million);\nDecorative Center of Houston, a 500,000-square-foot design center at 5120 Woodway Drive ($50 million).\nVerandah Flats, a 120-unit apartment complex at 7130 Gaston Avenue ($26.5 million);\nTesoro at 12 Apartments, a 184-unit apartment complex 4271 Altoona Drive in Dallas ($24.2 million);\nAugusta North Houston, a 212-unit apartment complex at 12655 Kuykendahl Road in Houston ($22.7 million);\nGalleria Oaks Building 2, an 18,000-square-foot retail strip at 13376 North U.S. Highway 183 in Austin ($16 million);\nWyndham Garden Austin, at 3401 South Interstate 35 ($13.4 million);\nThe London, a 32-unit apartment complex at 5601 Gaston Avenue in Dallas ($12.9 million);\nIconic at The Station, a 75-unit apartment complex at 6810 Glendora Avenue in San Antonio ($4.9 million).\nA retail building at 6610 Low Bid Lane home to Soccer Central in San Antonio ($10.5 million);\nLa Bella Vista Apartments, a 152-unit complex at 3600 South Shaver Street in Houston ($9.2 million); and\n",

        "content": "Simon Dushinsky is gearing up to fill in a pit.\nThe Rabsky Group filed plans for a 24-story, 106-unit project at 65 Franklin Street in Tribeca, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The parcel on the corner of Franklin Street and Broadway is already excavated, but has sat empty and earned a rep\nas a neighborhood eyesore\n.\nDushinsky\u2019s firm previously proposed a 20-story, 89-unit project on the site, alternately addressed as 360 Broadway. But Rabsky was able to increase the scope of the development thanks to the City of Yes zoning reforms.\nLast summer, Rabsky\nlocked down\n$320 million in construction financing for the ground-up project, obtaining the debt from G4 Capital Partners. The latest filing doesn\u2019t indicate if Rabsky is building rentals or condominiums, but previous reporting points to the latter.\nDushinsky did not respond to the publication\u2019s request for comment.\nThe assemblage was formerly in the hands of HAP Investments, the firm led by Eran Polack, which planned a 19-story, 41-unit condo on the site. HAP picked up the land in 2018 for $46 million and spent years considering a project that never got off the ground.\nThe firm sold 360 Broadway to Rabsky in March for $57.6 million, setting the stage for a reinvention of the site. Rabsky also bought the parcel next door in September for $47.5 million, as well as 25,000 square feet of air rights above 67 Franklin Street for $3.6 million.\nThe site has a sordid history of litigation. Charles Dayan\u2019s Bonjour Capital controlled 59 Franklin Street through an LLC, which sued HAP Investments and Noble Construction Group, claiming negligent work at 65 Franklin Street destabilized the building. He was seeking at least $15 million.\nBonjour once filed plans to build an 18-story, 89,000-square-foot building with 89 luxury rentals at 59 Franklin.\nElsewhere in the city, Rabsky and Joel Gluck\u2019s Spencer Equity Group recently\ntook over\nthe long-term ground lease at 356 Fulton Street in Downtown Brooklyn from Gary Barnett\u2019s Extell Development in a $39 million deal.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Last month, former \u201cFull House\u201d star Lori Loughlin and estranged husband Mossimo Giannulli sold their home for $16.5 million, up from the $13 million they paid for it four years earlier.\nApple CEO Tim Cook\n, singer Justin Bieber, reality TV personality Kourtney Kardashian and her mother Kris Jenner, supermodel Cindy Crawford and music mogul Scooter Braun have also planted flags in La Quinta, per Realtor.com. The median home listing price there is $875,000. There are currently 188 homes listed for $1 million or more and 24 listed for $5 million and above.\nThe golf communities and mountain backdrops offer a \u201cbalance between resort-style living and a true residential community\u201d as well as \u201can exceptional level of privacy that attracts high-net-worth and celebrity homeowners,\u201d Karen Ahaesy, a Compass real estate agent and La Quinta resident, told\nRealtor.com\n. Wealthy residents have access to\nThe Thermal Club\n, an exclusive private motorsport club; the Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport for private jet access; and the ritzy Zenyara events venue.\nBuyers from Los Angeles, Orange County, San Francisco and out-of-state markets like Texas and the Pacific Northwest have been attracted to La Quinta because of the space, privacy, amenities and newer construction, according to Aheasy. The uptick of remote and hybrid work, as well as low inventory in top luxury communities such as The Madison Club, Hideaway, Tradition and The Quarry have driven up home values in La Quinta. There\u2019s also a strong demand for second homes in the town.\nLa Quinta, in contrast to nearby Indian Wells,\nPalm Springs\nand Palm Desert, offers a unique living environment. The mix of high-end living, privacy, natural beauty, contemporary homes and access to golf, tennis, equestrian sports and private air travel is \u201crare not just in the Coachella Valley, but anywhere in California,\u201d Aheasy said.\n\u201cPalm Springs is more urban, midcentury and nightlife-oriented,\u201d Aheasy said. \u201cNearby Indian Wells is elegant and established, but smaller and more traditional.\u201d Palm Desert serves as the retail and commercial center of the Coachella Valley. \u201cLa Quinta is quieter, newer and known for high-end gated communities and custom architectural estates,\u201d Aheasy said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",
