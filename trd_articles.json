        "content": "A Brazilian family sold their longtime Palm Beach compound for $25 million in an off-market deal.\nOrat LLC and 150 Dunbar Road Inc, two Florida entities tied to Thais and Deyse Racy, sold the adjacent homes at 151 Atlantic Avenue and 150 Dunbar Road to Heavenly Partners and Happy Isles Dreams, both Delaware firms owned by the buyer, for a combined $25 million, the\nPalm Beach Daily News\nreported.\nAshley McIntosh and Kendall Corso with Douglas Elliman represented the sellers, and Elizabeth DeWoody with Compass brought the buyer.\nThe Racys are from Sao Paolo, Brazil, and hired local architect Gene Lawrence to design the homes for seasonal use in the early 2000.\n\nThe Atlantic Avenue house was built in 2001 and spans 3,100 square feet, three bedrooms and three bathrooms, records show. The Racys bought the property for $675,000 in 1998, according to property records. The 5,700-square-foot Dunbar Road home was built in 2002 and has five bedrooms, five bathrooms, two half-bathrooms and a pool. Combined, the properties total 0.7 acres.\nThe Dunbar Road home was listed for $31.9 million last year, and the asking price was slashed twice before delisting in May, according to Zillow.\nIt marks the latest pricey deal in Palm Beach, as the island ramps up for its busy season. Earlier this month, private equity billionaire Greg Mondre\ndropped $58 million\non a 1.2-acre oceanfront lot, after buying a non-waterfront home for\n$31 million\nin March. Also this month, billionaire SC Johnson heiress Winifred Johnson-Marquart bought a landmarked home for\n$30 million\n. In September, Dutch hedge funder Pieter Tasselar sold his mansion on the island for $\n29.5 million\nin an off-market deal.\n\u2013\u2013\nKate Hinsche",

Apartment construction ramped up in the broader\nMontrose-River Oaks\narea during the pandemic but has since slowed, with no new multifamily projects starting in the district this year, a first since 2009, according to CoStar data.\n\nThat surge in supply suppressed rent growth in the submarket, leaving the average rent of $2,024 in\nMontrose\nflat for three consecutive years, according to CoStar.\nSoutheastern hasn\u2019t set rents for its project, at the intersection of Lovett Boulevard and Montrose Boulevard. The options will vary from studios to two-bedroom units, ranging from 550 square feet to 1,600 square feet, with 14,000 square feet of interior amenity spaces and a 20,000-square-foot outdoor courtyard with a pool, garden, event lawn and fire pit.\nThe apartments will turn a\nchapter\non the location while breathing life back into it. The \u201cDisco Kroger\u201d was open 24/7 and earned that nickname from the colorful late-night crowds that would flood the grocery store after closing time for neighborhood bars and clubs. The store was considered a hub of Houston\u2019s Pride celebrations.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

On the grounds of the property are a heated saltwater pool, outdoor kitchen, putting green and treehouse.\nBelfort, who is now a motivational speaker and married to Argentine model Cristina Invernizzi, owns an oceanfront home in Hermosa Beach in California, though he appears to have moved to Miami in 2021.\n",

        "content": "In the course of writing several\nrecent pieces\nabout co-ops, I have learned some interesting things about them.\nThese facts had somehow escaped me despite 56 years of living or covering real estate in New York City, the motherlode of residential co-ops.\nOne that jumped out at me: Co-op unit sales \u2014 which are actually sales of shares \u2014 were not recorded in ACRIS, the city\u2019s property records database, prior to 2003. Sales in HDFC co-ops are exempt from transfer taxes, so they still need not be recorded in ACRIS.\nThis made it difficult for me to investigate the\nbizarre history\nof unit transfers at 123-25 East 102nd Street in East Harlem. Actually, it would have been impossible if not for attorney Gregory Byrnes\u2019 having subpoenaed the co-op\u2019s records, which showed insiders passing units back and forth like baseball cards.\nI asked Adam Plotch, a veteran of co-op foreclosure auctions, how title insurers can verify the chain of ownership if the records are kept not in a public database or municipal office but in the dusty file cabinets of the co-op. The answer was, title companies don\u2019t necessarily rely on public records for co-op deals.\n\u201cAn original stock certificate and proprietary lease is immutable proof of ownership,\u201d he replied. \u201cA co-op will not issue a stock [certificate] and lease to a new owner until the old one is canceled. They also will not allow [them] to be transferred unless their own records reflect that the transferor is, indeed, the sole owner of the shares.\n\u201cSo if you have a stock and lease in your possession, and you couple that with the records of the co-op, it\u2019s as clear a record as any of valid ownership.\u201d\nThe system seems archaic to me. What would happen if fire destroyed a co-op\u2019s records and shareholders\u2019 stock certificates? How would anyone know who owned what?\nBut I don\u2019t want to single out co-ops. Records of real property transfers could also use modernization, as revealed by frequent reports of deed theft and fraud.\n\u201cA nefarious or sloppy owner of real property can, in theory, execute multiple deeds to the same property to multiple persons,\u201d Plotch noted. \u201cThis actually happens \u2014 and there\u2019s statutory and case law that determines how such conflicts are resolved: The first person to record his deed in the land records is deemed to be the owner.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nYiatin Chu and I have had our differences on X, but I couldn\u2019t argue with\nher post\non being a landlord in New York City: \u201cThis is what happened to my relatives. The renter subletted to someone who didn\u2019t pay. The squatter knew how to play the court system to delay. It took 3-yrs to evict. They won\u2019t get the $80k in unpaid rent and the tenant destroyed the place. It cost $70K to gut renovate. Many small property owners fear these situations and rather take their units off the market.\u201d Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\n\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: A Chicago judge is considering ordering tenants relocated from a violation-ridden building. In New York City, tenants aren\u2019t evacuated unless their building presents an imminent danger \u2014 because with the city\u2019s 1.4 percent vacancy rate, there is nowhere for them to go.\nElsewhere\u2026\nAn update on an item I wrote last week about a\nnew state law\nbanning algorithms that allow landlords to collude on rents:\nThe Real Estate Board of New York sent a statement explaining its strident opposition to the bill.\n\u201cAttempting to prevent collusion is laudable, but this legislation goes beyond regulations in other states, to the point of banning evaluation of public data outside of a property owner\u2019s portfolio when considering rents,\u201d said REBNY President Jim Whelan. \u201cWe believe more transparency and market analysis most often benefits the consumer and this bill will lead to unintended consequences like higher rents and reduced market efficiency.\u201d\nThat\u2019s quite a contrast to\nthis tweet\nby Jay Martin of the New York Apartment Association, which represents rent-stabilized owners (and doesn\u2019t always see eye-to-eye with REBNY):\n\u201cWe spent 0 time and energy opposing this bill. Why? We couldn\u2019t find any members that use \u2018algorithms to collude and raise rent.\u2019\u201d\nWith trademark sarcasm, he added, \u201cCongrats though. Eventually we\u2019ll get around to policy solutions that will make housing more affordable.\u201d\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$5.8 million\nfor a 2,500-square-foot condominium at The Caledonia at 450 West 17th Street in Chelsea. Joseph Pullen and Taylor Durland with The Corcoran Group\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$170.3 million\nfor the Dominick Hotel at 246 Spring Street in Soho. The hotel has 46 floors and 391 rooms.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$18.5 million\nfor a 4,689-square-foot condominium at 65 West 13th Street in Greenwich Village. Noble Black, Connor Cuccinelli and Cory Cahlon with The Corcoran Group have the listing.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Blocking affordable housing is nothing to be proud of \u2014 especially for an affordable building getting public money.\nIt\u2019s certainly not something the state should encourage. But that appears to have happened at Inwood Gardens, a\nMitchell-Lama\nin northern Manhattan.\nShareholders of the co-op at 45 Fairview Avenue voted twice to sell a vacant lot to affordable housing developers for $7.3 million, only to back out. This came shortly after a state affordable housing agency handed the co-op a $2.5 million mortgage from its\nPreventative Troubled Assets Program\n.\nThen this year, the state Assembly awarded Inwood Gardens\n$500,000\n.\n\u201cAt the same time the co-op was rejecting my offer to acquire its land, it was accepting bailouts from the state,\u201d said an exasperated Coconut Properties CEO Adam Zeidel, who partnered with the nonprofit RiseBoro Community Partnership on the proposal.\nInstead of 175 new, affordable apartments for seniors, the neighborhood was left with a garbage-strewn lot. The developers\u2019 six-year effort came to nothing. And taxpayers got stuck with the co-op\u2019s bills.\nIn short, everybody lost.\nCoconut and RiseBoro still hope to build the project, which would sit alongside a similar one they just constructed next door at\n37 Hillside Avenue\n(see photo, above). But the lenders they had lined up to finance the sister project have moved on.\nZeidel had implored the lenders to hang on as he attempted to rescue the deal with increasingly desperate emails to the state Division of Homes and Community Renewal and local elected officials.\n\u201cWe are simply seeking someone to mediate and navigate towards a resolution in which we can (i) give the Co-Op a big chunk of money (capital for present/future needs) and (ii) allows us to build a new, 100% affordable housing project on vacant land that the Co-Op has no use for,\u201d he wrote to a state official. \u201cThis result would benefit all parties.\u201d\nIn one message, the developer warned the state that by giving the co-op money, it was reducing the building\u2019s need to sell the land.\n\n\u201cAny time the Co-Op needs capital, HCR provides it,\u201d Zeidel emailed the agency. \u201cSo, what is the incentive for the Co-Op to make a deal?\u201d\nThe agency told\nThe Real Deal\nthat it has not awarded Inwood Gardens funding \u201crecently\u201d and that Mitchell-Lamas are privately owned and responsible for their operating expenses and maintaining their physical and financial integrity.\nMitchell-Lamas across the state have received\nnearly $500 million\nfrom the Hochul administration. Good fiscal practices are not required to qualify. To the contrary, dire financial circumstances appear to strengthen affordable co-ops\u2019 arguments for state help.\nThe case of Inwood Gardens shows that even when these co-ops make bad financial decisions and block housing that Gov. Kathy Hochul says is desperately needed across the state, they still get public grants to patch budget holes.\nEconomists might call that a moral hazard: The co-ops only get public money if they can show that they need it. Had Inwood Gardens sold its unused land for $7.3 million, it would be able to repair its retaining wall without a handout from taxpayers.\nThe co-op\u2019s shareholders voted overwhelmingly in 2021 to approve the deal, and its board followed suit, but never signed the sales agreement. Zeidel never got an explanation that made sense.\n\u201cEach time we got to putting pen to paper to execute the contract, the Co-Op backed out for some novel, unrelated reason,\u201d he emailed the state in January.\nDavid Baron, head of Inwood Gardens\u2019 property manager at the time, Metro Management Development, told\nThe Real Deal\n, \u201cI cannot speak to the reasons the sale did not go through.\u201d\nThe co-op initially squeezed Coconut and RiseBoro for more money. Two years after voting for the deal, the board asked for 40 percent more cash, plus $100,000 to repair a retaining wall. The developers agreed.\nBut then the board overplayed its hand, raising its price another 30 percent. Realizing the co-op would never get to yes, Coconut and RiseBoro withdrew their offer.\n",

        "content": "The remains of a burned Pacific Palisades mansion owned by Luminar Technologies\u2019 30-year-old founder and featured on\nHBO\u2019s hit series \u201cSuccession\u201d\nhave been condemned.\nThe home at 1601 San Onofre Drive is one of eight properties in the Palisades the City of Los Angeles just\ndeclared a public nuisance\n, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n. City officials claim the owner has yet to remove ash and debris from the deadly January wildfires. The home was featured in the fourth season of \u201cSuccession\u201d as the luxury estate of the fictional Roy family.\nThe five-member Los Angeles Board of Building and Safety Commissioners said the fire debris at the eight properties, which includes luxury estates, multifamily apartments and businesses, were a public nuisance and could be a risk to public health and safety. Officials say the owners of these properties failed to meet the Oct. 2 deadline to clear hazardous fire debris. With the Oct. 8 vote, owners must either clean up their lots or prepare for a city contractor to do it for them and slap them with a bill.\n\u201cOnce a property is declared a public nuisance, the owner has the right to abate the nuisance until the department solicits bids for the work,\u201d Gail Gaddi, a spokesperson for the L.A. Department of Building and Safety, said. \u201cA process or timeline has not been established for when the department will begin to solicit bids.\u201d\n\nThe six-bedroom, 18-bathroom mansion last sold in 2021 for $83 million. It was\nbuilt in 2020 by developer Ardie Tavangarian\nand is owned by 30-year-old Luminar Technologies founder Austin Russell,\naccording\nto The Daily Mail; in a \u201cSuccession\u201d-like twist, it was once owned by magazine magnate William Randolph Hearst. After the Palisades fire ripped through the neighborhood, the owner withdrew from the\nfederal debris removal program led by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\nout of worry that the government contractors wouldn\u2019t adequately preserve parts of the estate, according to Jon Mansfield, a representative for the owner. After learning that private debris cleanup would cost between $500,000 and $600,000, the owner changed their mind but it was too late to register.\n\u201cThere\u2019s millions of dollars of [building materials] that we were afraid would be destroyed in the process and further degrade the value of the property,\u201d Mansfield said.\nThe \u201cSuccession\u201d house and nearby lots are the latest properties in the Palisades to be declared a public nuisance nine months after the fire. Earlier this month, the Building and Safety Commission declared the 170-unit\nPacific Palisades Bowl Mobile Home Estates\ncommunity a public nuisance. The mobile home park\u2019s owner could similarly see the lots cleaned up and get a bill for the debris removal work.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

After selling out two Highland Park projects with record-setting\npenthouses\n, Fulton Developers is preparing to start construction on a third.\nMark Muller, principal of Fulton Developers, said the firm is seeking final City Council approval for its next project, the Walton, which would feature at least three penthouses priced above $3.7 million, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThat\u2019s the same range where Fulton has already closed six units \u2014 three at Park Sheridan and three more under contract half a mile away at the Wolbright. Rising construction costs could push prices closer to $4 million, Muller told the outlet, though he doesn\u2019t believe it would surpass that.\nThose figures put Highland Park condos in rarefied company, even compared with Chicago\u2019s top neighborhoods. Only a handful of\nGold Coast\nand\nLincoln Park\nunits have sold between $3.7 million and $4 million in the past year, and Fulton\u2019s sales now rival those.\nThe firm\u2019s $3.7 million Park Sheridan closings outpaced nearly all single-family sales in Highland Park during the same period.\nThe five-story Walton, to be located at the 1600 block of Second Street, was approved conditionally by the city council earlier this month, and would rise across from the under-construction Wolbright.\n\nThe site currently holds two houses and a 10-unit resi building. Its redevelopment would continue the corridor\u2019s shift from small-scale residences to luxury condos. The council asked Fulton to refine plans for on-site green space before granting final sign-off.\nWhen complete, the Walton will have 19 units, including multimillion-dollar penthouses and several others expected to top $1 million. Two units will be designated as affordable housing. Fulton aims to start construction in spring 2026.\nThe project marks the developer\u2019s seventh in Highland Park and extends a high-end experiment that\u2019s found surprising traction outside Chicago.\nMuller told Crain\u2019s last year that many affluent\nNorth Shore\nbuyers now prefer local luxury condos over city penthouses, citing concerns about crime and convenience. While other suburbs have struggled to land similar projects, he said Highland Park\u2019s walkable downtown and quiet side streets have made it the right fit for \u201ca penthouse lifestyle without the city.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Firms in the running to redevelop the location include sports businesses and industrial players as well as real estate investors and green tech companies.\nTrammell Crow Company, Pacific Maritime Association, Oakland Roots Sports Club, Industrial Realty Group, GreenCharge Mobility, Glovis America, Deca Companies, Outrigger Industrial and Vistra Corporation are all vying for the job.\nMore than 100 companies expressed interest\nin redeveloping the site, including real estate giants Prologis and Brookfield.\nCBRE-owned Trammell Crow views the\nredevelopment of Howard Terminal\nas an \u201cincredibly significant project for the East Bay,\u201d the company\u2019s Northern California market leader Adam Voelker said.\n\nThe\nOakland Roots Soccer Club\nsubmitted a proposal to build a 25,000-seat soccer stadium at Howard Terminal. The plans call for initially building a temporary structure while the permanent stadium is under construction.\nThe A\u2019s\u2019 certified environmental report could be used by a developer looking to build a sports stadium. The\nA\u2019s\u2019 plans\ncalled for thousands of homes, millions of square feet of commercial space and various public amenities. The baseball team was in an\nexclusive negotiation agreement\nwith the port, but it expired in May 2023, leaving a big question mark on the future of the site.\nIt will likely be several more months before the Port of Oakland chooses a finalist for the redevelopment effort. Tariffs, changes in global supply chains and increasing construction costs have already proven to be an obstacle for some, however, with a few proposals becoming financially infeasible and being withdrawn from consideration.\nFor now, Howard Terminal is being used largely for short-term property rental agreements for container parking, depot operations and other maritime uses.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n\\\n",

The six-story buildings will be arranged around tree-lined courtyards and pedestrian paths meant to echo the area\u2019s eclectic, walkable character, according to the filings.\nThe development marks Oxbow\u2019s first foray beyond its signature\nPearl campus\n, where it turned a defunct brewery into one of the city\u2019s most prominent mixed-use districts.\nConstruction is expected to wrap in 2027 or 2028.\n\nOxbow\u2019s plan includes relocating the historic Muench-Pollock House, a late-19th-century home sitting on the west side of Matagorda Street. Built in the 1890s and later owned by the San Antonio Independent School District, the structure will be deconstructed and moved to the corner of Matagorda and Lavaca pending further approval.\nThe project lands amid a broader city-led transformation of the area.\nSan Antonio officials are advancing plans for a sports and entertainment district anchored by a new Spurs arena at the former Institute of Texan Cultures.

        "content": "Delray Beach\u2019s planning and zoning board rejected a proposal to allow an indoor gun range in an industrial district, but the proposal will still head to the city commission.\nWallace Drive LLC, the owner of a 18,400-square-foot flex office warehouse built in 1983 at 1215 Wallace Drive, sought approval for a proposed ordinance that would allow indoor gun ranges in the Wallace Drive Overlay District. The 1.8-acre site is next to a senior housing community and a church and about 1,000 feet from an elementary school.\nFour out of seven planning and zoning board members voted against the proposal at a meeting on Monday evening.\nThe property owner wants to build an indoor gun range that will allow private members and\nDelray Beach\npolice officers to train with firearms, said Neil Schiller, Wallace Drive\u2019s attorney.\nThe legislation would also allow the owners of 12 other parcels within the same district (bounded by Southwest Tenth Street, Georgia Street, Southwest Ninth Avenue and Wallace Drive) to pursue plans for a gun range as well. Right now, the light industrial-zoned district includes a CubeSmart self-storage space, two additional warehouses, two single-family homes, and five vacant parcels (three of which are owned by the city).\nSchiller said under the proposed regulations, those property owners would have to submit their own plans to the city commission for final approval. All gun ranges in the district would be required to have 24-hour security, submit to the National Rifle Association\u2019s safety regulations, comply with noise regulations, and ban the sale of alcohol on the premises, he added.\nThe overlay district is adjacent to Groves of Delray II, an apartment community for people over the age of 62, and Calvary Bible Alliance Church.\u00a0 The district is also within 700 feet of Pine Grove Elementary School, board member Mitch Katz said.\nNevertheless, minimum distance requirements from homes and schools were absent from the proposed regulations pushed by Schiller and planning consultant Jeff Costello. Schiller said such details can be worked out during the conditional use process, but city planning staff pointed out that most other municipalities in Palm Beach County had distance requirements for gun ranges.\n\nKatz noted that they just had discussions about distance requirements for vape shops. \u201cBut gun ranges? Well, we can just put them across the street from a school,\u201d he remarked.\nSchiller replied that his client\u2019s building is at least 1,000 feet away from the school.\nThat didn\u2019t make board member Dedrick Straghn feel any less apprehensive about allowing a private gun range near a church and a senior residential community. Straghn also pointed out that gun ranges were already permitted in the city\u2019s mixed industrial and commercial district, where the Delray Shooting Center already operates just a quarter mile away.\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t smell right to me,\u201d Straghn said.\nMark Grafton, another attorney representing the developer, insisted that the range would be a state-of-the art facility that will meet the police department\u2019s needs, including training how to shoot in low-light conditions as well as how to breach doors.\nChairman Gregory Snyder proposed adding regulations that would require a future gun range to be 500 feet from a school, park, or church and that no noise louder than 60 decibels emit past the property line. But when the vote was called just Snyder, Katz and Roger Cope voted yes while board members Straghn, Price Patton, James Chard and Judy Mollica voted no.\nWallace Drive LLC, managed by Delia Lalchan, acquired 1215 Wallace Drive for $5.8 million in March from Aram LLC.\nThe property is about 1.5 miles away from where Kolter Group intends to build\nAlton Delray\n, a 386-unit apartment complex that will include 154 workforce apartments, under the state\u2019s Live Local Act. It\u2019s also less than two miles from\nAura Delray Beach\n, a 292-unit apartment community that an affiliate of New York-based Related Companies acquired for nearly $117 million in August.",

        "content": "Two recent apartment sales in Chicago this month point to the highs and lows of investing in the multifamily market since the pandemic rocked the economy, as local firms sold with disparate results to out-of-state buyers.\nNear the Lakeview neighborhood\u2019s border with Roscoe Village, a 95-unit, two-building complex known as the Low-Line Commons sold for $40 million to Utah-based Highland Partners, notching a solid win for its Chicago-based developers. The deal came out to about $421,000 per unit.\nMeanwhile, Chicago-based Origin Investments didn\u2019t fare as well on its $63 million sale of a West Loop complex to New York-based real estate fund LRE Management.\nTogether, the transactions illustrate the pitfalls of investing even with Chicago climbing the ranks of the nation\u2019s strongest multifamily markets, with a significant lack of new supply driving rents up in a trend poised to continue.\nA Chicago-based venture led by\nMatt Katsaros of Wildwood Investments\nand Michael Breheny of Contemporary Concepts broke ground in 2022 on the four-story Low-Line complex at 3431 North Ashland Avenue, which lines almost an entire block. The team refinanced the property for $27 million in January and less than a year later was able to sell it for well more to Highland.\n\u201cIt took us about just under four years to start and finish, which was our goal, and we sold it at about a 6-cap, which I think fits the current market environment,\u201d Katsaros said, referring to the deal\u2019s capitalization rate of about 6 percent. \u201cIt was a fair deal for us and for the purchasers \u2026 and we\u2019re very happy with the outcome.\u201d\nThe team also developed the adjacent 53-unit Topaz Apartments, which sold to local firm KMA Cos. and Property Management for $17.1 million, or about $322,000 per unit, last year.\nIn the West Loop, Origin sold the 120-unit Monroe Aberdeen apartments for a slight discount from its last purchase price to LRE. The property at 1050 West Monroe Street last traded for $65.8 million in early 2020, when Origin bought it from Michigan Avenue Real Estate Group, a developer backed by\nChicago Bulls and White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf\n.\nFor buildings like Monroe Aberdeen, which last traded at the onset of the pandemic, a sharp rise in interest rates and construction costs have disrupted otherwise strong fundamentals.\nOrigin typically invests in Mountain West and Sun Belt markets, but it\u2019s not walking away entirely from Chicago.\n\u201cOrigin will reinvest sale proceeds in select ground-up development projects in markets where Origin believes supply and demand imbalances create greater opportunities for rent growth and value creation on behalf of its investors,\u201d the firm said in a statement.\n\nSince the pandemic, distressed properties have been on\na wild ride to recovery\nas investor appetite for the market, and Chicago in particular, grows.\n\u201cThe strength of the rental market is the driving force behind these deals,\u201d said Interra Realty broker Joe Samzal, who represented the developers in the Low-Line Commons sale. \u201cIt certainly gives me confidence in what to expect in the next couple of years.\u201d\nHighland, the Low-Line Commons buyer, has spent $150 million on acquisitions throughout the U.S. this year, about half of which are in Chicago and its northern suburbs. That includes another project led by Breheny\u2019s Contemporary Concepts at 516 West Arlington Place in Lincoln Park. That sale came out to $10.3 million, or $739,000 per unit.\nLow-Line Commons\u2019 proximity to the Southport Corridor and mix of one- to three-bedroom units, which is unique for the area, were just two of several factors that piqued Highland\u2019s interest. The firm has offices in Chicago; Tucson, Arizona; and Ogden, Utah.\n\u201cWe love the Chicago market,\u201d Highland Partners co-founder Ben Frazer said. \u201cThe demand side has been great and there\u2019s really been strong employment growth.\u201d\nEven those who were previously hesitant to jump into Cook County\u2019s\nchaotic property tax system\nsay it\u2019s worth the risk now.\n\u201cFrom an underwriting perspective, we are comfortable with the uncertainty with the taxes,\u201d said Eric Londa, founder of LRE Management, the Monroe Aberdeen buyer based in Mamaroneck, New York.\nLRE has deployed about 40 percent of its capital in its fund so far, with a focus on not just Chicago but also Atlanta and Sarasota, Londa said.\nIncreased multifamily investor interest is also translating to an uptick in office-to-residential conversions, either subsidized or unsubsidized.\nWildwood, the seller of Low-Line Commons, recently took over a conversion project in Streeterville that was started by\nHorizon Realty Group\n. Horizon bought the property at 230 East Ohio Street for $5.6 million in late 2024, completed some of the interior work and then sold it to Wildwood for $9.75 million last week.",

The dumpling house is expected to open at The Brook in 2027.\nThe length of the lease at the Witkoff and Apollo Global Management-owned property was not disclosed, nor was the asking rent for the retail space. The average asking rent on retail space in Downtown Brooklyn ranged from $115 to $190 per square foot in the first half of the year, according to the Real Estate Board of New York.\nGoodSpace\u2019s Chris DeCrosta represented ownership on the lease, while Newmark\u2019s Ben Birnbaum represented the tenant.\nKnown for its soup dumplings and noodles, Din Tai Fung boasts more than 180 locations across the world.\nDin Tai Fung began as a cooking oil business founded by a Chinese refugee in 1958 before becoming a steamed dumpling and noodle restaurant in 1972. In 1993, the New York Times praised the restaurant as one of the\n10 best gourmet spots in the world\n. In 2010, its Hong Kong location was awarded a Michelin Star, the first time a Taiwanese restaurant ever earned such a distinction.\n\nIn New York City, it\nleased\n26,400 square feet at 1633 Broadway in Manhattan in 2022 for its first East Coast outpost.\nWitkoff and Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance\nscored a $388.4 million loan\nin the summer of 2022 to build a\n51-story, 591-unit tower\nat 567 Fulton Street. The development totals 448,000 square feet, including more than 30,000 square feet of retail across two adjacent sites.\nThe site was once owned by RedSky Capital and JZ Capital, who started creating an assemblage in 2012. But in 2019, JZ Capital said it would write down the value of the firm\u2019s shared portfolio by\nas much as $150 million\n.\nThe project\u2019s $154.6 million loan, provided by Apollo, went into\ndefault\na few months later.

        "content": "A months-long legal battle between Rok Lending and Miami developer Marlon Gomez over a foreclosed development site in Aventura appears to be nearing an end after a slew of bankruptcy filings and failed last-minute court maneuvers.\nAn affiliate of Aventura-based\nRok Lending\n, led by CEO Bryan Morjain, paid $477,800 for the 1.6-acre property at 21291 Northeast 28th Avenue in a foreclosure auction held Sept. 3, court records show. The purchase followed a $19.9 million judgment the lender secured in February against Gomez\u2019s entity, which allegedly defaulted on a $15 million loan issued in 2023.\nThe Rok Lending affiliate received its certificate of title on Oct. 15, court records show.\nThe sale came after months of procedural delays stemming from Gomez\u2019s efforts to stave off foreclosure by filing two Chapter 11 petitions \u2014 filings that judges have repeatedly described as frivolous and in defiance of court orders.\nGomez hasn\u2019t given up though. His entity filed a notice with the Third District Court of Appeals that it will be filing a petition seeking to reverse the auction and the $19.9 million judgment.\n\u201cDuring this case, we have identified several erroneous factors that we believe will come to light as the appeal progresses,\u201d Gomez stated in an email. \u201cDespite the challenges of today\u2019s market we have financing ready and are actively working to repay the lender to resolve this matter.\u201d\nGomez has run out of time to resolve the debt, Morjain said.\n\n\u201cThe borrower defaulted nearly two years ago and has had ample time to refinance our position or sell the property,\u201d Morjain said. \u201cUnfortunately, none of the proposed take-outs materialized.\u201d\nGomez\u2019s first bankruptcy petition in April postponed a planned April 22 auction of the\nAventura site\n, where he has proposed building a 142,000-square-foot medical office building. In May, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Mark dismissed the case and barred Gomez\u2019s entity from refiling for Chapter 11 protection for 180 days.\nDespite the order, Gomez\u2019s company submitted a second bankruptcy petition just minutes before a rescheduled Aug. 4 foreclosure sale, prompting\nRok Lending\nto seek another dismissal in bankruptcy court, and reinstate the auction in Miami-Dade Circuit Court.\nIn its filings, the lender argued the August bankruptcy petition was void, saying continued delays were causing \u201cimmediate and irreparable damage\u201d since the property was underwater and accruing costs.\nOn Aug. 8, Judge Mark dismissed the second bankruptcy case and issued a stern warning: Gomez, his entity, and their counsel were prohibited from further attempts to delay the foreclosure sale without Rok Lending\u2019s written consent. Days later, Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Abby Cynamon reset the auction for Sept. 3, when the Rok affiliate ultimately emerged as the winning bidder.\nEven after losing the property, Gomez sought to delay the ownership transfer. He requested that Cynamon vacate the foreclosure sale and delay the transfer of title to Rok Lending. She denied both requests \u2014 first on Oct. 7, then again on Oct. 14 \u2014 effectively clearing the way for the lender to take full control of the site.\nThe Aventura site isn\u2019t the only troubled property tied to Gomez. On a separate front, a court-appointed receiver is marketing another distressed asset \u2014 a 1.8-acre Miami River development site \u2014 with an asking price of\n$18.1 million\n. That property, also owned by a Gomez-managed entity, is encumbered by a pending foreclosure lawsuit alleging default on a\n$10 million\nloan.",

Landlord OYO Hotels broke state law by failing to provide the required 90-day notice before the mass terminations, according to the judge.\n\u201cThat\u2019s completely outrageous, actually, to terminate the employees without the notice to which they are entitled,\u201d New York County Supreme Court Judge Andrea Masley said, extending a temporary order.\nThe saga dates back to the beginning of August, when OYO allegedly blindsided property manager Highgate Hotels with a notice canceling its contract, according to a lawsuit filed by Highgate.\nThe cancellation attempt came four years ahead of schedule and included the citation of issues related to an entirely different property Highgate operates.\nThe issue centers on a 10-year management agreement entitling Highgate to a 3.25 percent cut of the 208-key hotel\u2019s gross revenue. OYO is supposed to provide working capital to the property, which Highgate describes as \u201cwell-performing.\u201d OYO begged to differ on Highgate\u2019s performance in the termination notice. The hotel owner said it now plans to welcome a new, unnamed property manager.\n\nThe fight pits one of New York\u2019s biggest management companies against one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing hotel owners.\nHighgate controls more than 30 New York hotels\nand 500 globally. OYO,\nbacked by SoftBank\n, bought Motel 6 from Blackstone last year for $525 million and is preparing an initial public offering that could value the company at $8 billion.\nThe effort to terminate Highgate\u2019s contract could be a means for OYO to cut expenses and boost earnings before the IPO.\nThe judge issued an ominous warning to lawyers from both parties.\n\u201cEventually you\u2019re going to break up.

Western Alliance provided $100 million in loans as a revolving credit facility also to purchase mortgage loans.\n(A lawyer for Cantor Group said it upheld all its contractual obligations to Zions Bank and any suggestion to the contrary is a lie. The lawyer said \u201cthere have been multiple audits and independent reviews of these loans at the bank going back years and there have been no monetary defaults.)\nThe news rattled investors who feared the other regional banks would reveal write-downs on troubled loans. It also came in the wake of the bankruptcies of auto parts company First Brands and auto lender Tricolor, which led to losses at major Wall Street banks.\nOn Oct. 16, Zions Bancorp\u2019s shares slid 13 percent, while Western Alliance\u2019s shares fell over 10 percent. The bank\u2019s shares have recovered and are trading around 3 percent below where the banks were prior to the decline.\nThe flip\nMichael D\u2019Alessio owned the Upper East Side buildings at 227 East 67th Street and 184 East 64th Street, but in 2019, a court sentenced him to six years in prison after he pled guilty to defrauding investors out of $58 million in what prosecutors referred to as a \u201cPonzi-like\u201d scheme. His lender, Preferred Bank, initiated a foreclosure and purchased the properties through bankruptcy sale for a combined price of $32.5 million in February 2019.\n\nTwo months later, Preferred Bank flipped the properties to a firm called Continuum Analytics for $38 million and also provided a $29 million loan on the properties. But the deed and loan were signed by Deba Shyam, who described her position as Cantor Group Member LLC\u2019s managing member. (Shyam was named in the lawsuit brought by Zions Bancorp.)\nIn late 2024, Shyam\u2019s Continuum Analytics found a buyer for the two buildings. Two Switzerland-based companies allegedly sought to purchase the Upper East Side pair for $24 million. The new sale was a 36 percent decrease from the price Continuum paid for the properties. The unknown Swiss buyers made a $1.2 million deposit and put the balance in escrow, but Continuum allegedly wanted out of the deal at the last minute.\nThe Switzerland companies filed a lawsuit in New York Supreme Court alleging Continuum failed to honor its purchase and sales agreements. The buyer also sought to appoint a receiver on the properties, alleging Continuum owes more than $460,000 in property taxes on the buildings. The lawsuit is still pending.\nPreferred Bank\nAt the heart of Western Alliance and Zions Bancorp\u2019s lawsuits is the allegation that the borrowers misled the banks about liens or security interests on collateral they believed secured their loans. In the event of a default, Western Alliance and Zions Bank presumed they were getting paid back first.\nBut Western Alliance\u2019s lawsuit alleges Cantor Group\u2019s fund hid other senior liens through bogus title policies. In many cases where Western Alliance presumed to have a senior lien, documents from title companies show the lienholder to be Preferred Bank \u2014\u00a0the lender on the New York properties.\nPreferred Bank, founded in 1991 to serve the Chinese American community in Southern California, was an active lender to Cantor Group. It had the first lien position on at least seven properties, according to Western Alliance\u2019s lawsuit. These include: 2522 South Grove Avenue in Ontario, California, and 28207 Newhall Ranch Road in Valencia, California, according to the lawsuit.\nWestern Alliance alleges the policies provided by Cantor had no reference to Preferred Bank\u2019s first position on the collateral.\nPreferred Bank did not return a request to comment.",

        "content": "A New York mall\u2019s\ncontinued distress\nhas spelled out bad news for investors.\nA loan tied to the Palisades Center mall in Rockland County, New York, has been settled, but with substantial losses to securities holders. Lower classes of the bonds were wiped out entirely, and first-priority investors also saw some of their investment vanish, according to Morningstar Credit. Occupancy and revenue at the mall had declined substantially since the loan\u2019s underwriting in 2016.\nPyramid Management Group developed the mall, located in West Nyack, New York, in the late 1990s. In 2016, the firm secured a $388.5 million refinancing against the property. That was just a fraction of the mall\u2019s value, then estimated at $881 million, according to Morningstar.\nThe loan was securitized and sold to investors. But the mall couldn\u2019t keep up its performance. JCPenney and Lord &amp; Taylor closed their locations there in 2017 and 2019, respectively. Those anchor spaces have never been filled.\nRevenue dipped precipitously during the pandemic and then failed to fully recover. The mall pulled in more than $80.4 million in 2016, but that fell to $61.8 million in 2022, according to Morningstar. Occupancy fell from 100 percent to 78 percent that same year, as the loan was transferred to special servicing for maturity and monetary default. Expenses, once 40 percent of revenue, rose to 60 percent by 2023.\nThe most recent data, from 2024, shows revenue has fallen more than 30 percent, to less than $56 million. At the time, the mall did not have enough revenue to cover its debt service. Current tenants in the four-story, 1.9 million-square-foot property include Home Depot, Target, BJ\u2019s Wholesale, AMC and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods.\n\nThe mall was most recently appraised at $191 million, a loss of 78 percent of its value, according to Morningstar.\nThe servicer\nfiled for foreclosure\nand was granted a receiver and summary judgment in the case.\nThe loan was resolved this month, after taking a $231.4 million loss. Class B, C and D bondholders were entirely wiped out. Class A lost about 32 percent of its value, to the tune of $72 million.\nPyramid Management Group has had a difficult year, beyond the Palisades Center. The company has\nlost two other malls to foreclosure\nin roughly one year: the Aviation Mall in Queensbury, New York and the Hampshire Mall in \u200b\u200bHadley, Massachusetts, according to\nreporting\nfrom Syracuse.com.\nPyramid Management Group did not immediately respond to a request to comment for this story.\n",

        "content": "Prosper Group is partnering with a Belgian developer on a planned $650 million luxury condo tower along the Miami River in Brickell,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nVersluys Group, led by CEO Bart Versluys and COO Peter De Decker, is a joint venture partner with Miami Beach-based Prosper Group, led by Jay Roberts, on the development of the waterfront assemblage at 99 Southwest Seventh Street, 66 Southwest Sixth Street and 625 Southwest First Avenue in Miami, the partners said.\nThe partners plan a 60-story, 158-unit branded high-rise with more than 300 feet of river frontage. The project will mark Versluys\u2019 first U.S. development, De Decker said. Construction will take about 30 months and the building is expected to be completed in 2028, according to a press release.\nThe joint venture is under contract to acquire the development site next spring for an undisclosed price, Roberts said. Sales are expected to launch in the third quarter. Roberts said he was introduced to Versluys through a mutual connection.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of appetite from European investors, and capital looking for opportunities outside of Europe and into South Florida,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cRegulations in Europe are hurting development and growth.\u201d\nDe Decker said the firm has always been interested in investing in Miami.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the high-end residential market in Belgium, Holland. We have a lot of deals in the top 1 percent of the market,\u201d De Decker said. \u201cIf we want to expand, we must look at other markets. We were looking at London, Singapore, Dubai.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Harvey Hernandez\u2019s Newgard Development Group and Two Roads Development\ninked a contract\nto sell a portion of the site to Prosper. It was part of the developers\u2019 three-tower assemblage site, where they are\ncurrently building\nLofty Brickell and the Standard Residences.\nDevelopers have been increasingly joint venturing on new high-rise projects, driven by rising costs.\nThe Prosper-Versluys project is expected to include about 35,000 square feet of food and beverage retail space. The developers declined to name the brand, but plan to announce that at a later date.\nProsper\u2019s portfolio includes more than 1,300 residential units planned or under construction in Tampa and South Florida, according to the release.\nEarlier this year, Prosper and its partner Forte Development\nsubmitted plans\nfor an 80-story mixed-use condo tower also in Brickell, at\n1040 South Miami Avenue\n. Their application was filed under Miami-Dade County\u2019s rapid transit zoning, which can provide developers with additional density. The site is about a block away from the Brickell Metromover station.\n",

        "content": "Millionaire Stephen Cloobeck, who is running for governor of California as a Democrat, knows that throwing money at a challenge doesn\u2019t always work.\nThe time-share entrepreneur saw the 2020 end of his five-month relationship with girlfriend Stefanie Gurzanski get ugly, litigious and public. Cloobeck, 58 when he met the OnlyFans model and Instagram influencer, spent over $1 million on Gurzanski, throwing her a\n$130,000 party\nfor her 26th birthday, buying her a $200,000 Richard Mille watch, and prepaying her annual rent on a luxurious Beverly Hills apartment. He claimed he didn\u2019t know she was shooting porn on his property and posting it on OnlyFans, and said he broke up with her when he found out.\nBut when it comes to his business acumen and wealth \u2014 which Inside Edition put at\naround $100 million\nin 2021 \u2014 Cloobeck is far more successful.\nAnd he\u2019s willing to throw some big money at the long-shot challenge of becoming California\u2019s next governor.\nThe former CEO of Diamond Resorts has\nthe most money in his coffers\namong all 2026 California gubernatorial contenders, raking in $13.6 million via 172 contributions, according to\nCalifornia Secretary of State records\n.\nGranted, he contributed $13 million of the total, but he got some contributions from real estate executives, including $72,800 from\nWilliam Meldman, chairman of Discover Land Company, a Scottsdale, Arizona-headquartered real estate developer and operator of private residential communities and resorts. Cloobeck reeled in another $20,500 from five Discovery Land Company employees.\nCloobeck, who turns 64 on Sunday, also received $51,400 from family-owned real estate investment firm Randall Realty Group, led by\nJames Randall\n, the airplane rivet king-turned-philanthropist, and $36,400 from Jim Murren, former CEO of MGM Resorts International. Residential agent Josh Altman, co-founder of The Altman Brothers at Douglas Elliman, who shot to fame on \u201cMillion Dollar Listing Los Angeles,\u201d shelled out $1,500.\nBeyond real estate, actress and comedian Tiffany Haddish supported Cloobeck with a $2,500 donation, director Brett Ratner gave $1,000 and actor and comedian Tom Arnold contributed $500.\nThe first-time political candidate, who once considered a run for governor of Nevada, announced his bid for California\u2019s top elected office about a year ago but only recently garnered attention atop the money list among candidates.\nHis slogan is \u201cCalifornia, Get a Cloo.\u201d (He is giving away\nmerchandise\n.)\nHe is one of many candidates competing to succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is term-limited and ineligible for reelection in 2026.\nHow he got here\nCloobeck, who started out as a busboy in a small California restaurant, built his first shopping center in the 1980s in Burbank, California, and others in Bakersfield, Hanford, Hemet, Buena Park and Mission Viejo. He built his first hotel, the Polo Towers, on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nHe founded Las Vegas-based Diamond Resorts International in 1992. The company\nacquired\nthe publicly traded Sunterra Corporation in 2007 for $700 million, helping Diamond Resorts to become the second-largest vacation ownership company.\nBy 2016, Diamond Resorts had a network of more than 420 vacation destinations in 35 countries. Cloobeck sold Diamond Resorts to private equity firm Apollo Global Management in a 2016 deal expected to total $2.2 billion.\nCloobeck was named Nevada Athletic Commission chairman for a two-year term in June 2021. He\nresigned\nin late 2022, saying he would not be able to work with Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican who took office in early 2023.\nThe matter seemed more personal than ideological.\n\u201cHe is not honest nor grateful for the great benefits I\u2019ve given to the State of Nevada,\u201d Cloobeck said at the time.\nAs chairman of the Athletic Commission, Cloobeck pressed for the cause of death in the case of Nathan Valencia, 20, who collapsed in the ring after a University of Nevada-Las Vegas fraternity-sponsored boxing match. Cloobeck successfully pushed the commission to pass \u201cNathan\u2019s Law\u201d which requires trained referees and on-site medical personnel at amateur boxing events \u2014 but noted in his resignation that then Clark County Sheriff Lombardo did nothing to help his effort.\nOther past appointments were serving as the inaugural chairman of the board of Brand USA Inc., a United States government-formed nonprofit corporation to promote travel to the U.S.; and a member on Nevada\u2019s Standing Committee on Judicial Ethics and Election Practices, a board that attempts to settle ethical disputes that may arise over the course of campaigns for judicial office.\nA native of the Encino district in the San Fernando Valley, Cloobeck received a degree in bio-psychology from Brandeis University in 1983. He lives in a Beverly Hills mansion. Twice divorced, Cloobeck has three grown children. After his father went bankrupt, Cloobeck supported him until he passed away, per Vanity Fair.\n\u201cThe internet says I\u2019m only worth $100 million, which is just fine with me,\u201d he told\nVanity Fair\nin 2021. \u201cMy house in Beverly Hills is worth $100 million, and I own a $45 million home for cash in Cabo, and I own my own jet. You can do the math yourself.\u201d\nCloobeck appeared on several episodes of the reality-television show \u201cUndercover Boss,\u201d working low-level jobs at Diamond Resorts International to see a different side of the business.\nIn June, the candidate released his second book, \u201cFacing Hard Truths: How Americans Can Get Real, Pull Together, and Turn Our Country Around.\u201d The book covers topics including immigration, crime and the cost of living. His first book, \u201cChecking In: Hospitality-Driven Thinking, Business, and You,\u201d came out in October 2018.\n",

        "content": "A shuttered Skokie school property could soon be redeveloped by a firm with a heavy presence in Chicago\u2019s Fulton Market into a new 68-unit townhome community.\nSkokie\u2019s Plan Commission gave the project its blessing last week under new developer\nFulton Street Companies\n, helmed by Ross Babel and Alex Najem.\nThe local body voted unanimously to recommend approval of the developer\u2019s proposal to build three-story rental townhomes at 4600 Main Street, near Kilpatrick Avenue, the North Shore Record\nreported\n. The 3.9-acre parcel, formerly home to Arie Crown Hebrew Day School, has sat empty since the school consolidated operations at its Gross Point Road campus in April, said board member Brian Levinson.\nThe\nChicago-based\ndeveloper plans 24 two-bedroom and 44 three-bedroom units, each with a two-car garage, plus a total of 158 parking spaces. The project mirrors an earlier plan approved in 2024 for the same site by developer Luz and Associates, which later folded before breaking ground, according to Skokie planning manager Kate Portillo.\nIf approved by the Village Board, which will take up the matter at a future meeting, Fulton Street would buy the property from Arie Crown and move forward with construction.\nThis is the first project Fulton Street picked up outside of Chicago proper, said Babel, a founder and managing principal at Fulton Street. Babel told\nThe Real Deal\nthat closing on the land sale still needs to go through for the project to proceed.\nUnder\nSkokie\u2019s\nInclusionary Housing Ordinance, adopted in May, the developer would normally be required to reserve 5 percent of units \u2014 four in this case \u2014 for affordable housing. Instead, Fulton Street has opted to pay a $450,000 \u201cfee in lieu\u201d to the village, an alternative allowed under the law.\nThat exemption drew pushback from residents during Thursday\u2019s meeting.\n\n\u201cFour hundred thousand dollars is chump change,\u201d said resident Emi Yamauchi, arguing the townhomes fail to expand affordable housing options.\nAnother neighbor, Thomas Whitaker, objected to the project\u2019s density and height, saying it would \u201coverlook two-story homes\u201d and clash with the character of the area. Babel said the only consideration on the fee in lieu of affordable housing units was to mirror the Luz and Associates approval.\n\u201cThis was a deal the village has already seen and was already approved before, so all we\u2019re doing is following in the footsteps of what\u2019s been done and approved before,\u201d Babel said.\nLevinson, who also serves on the village\u2019s Economic Development Commission, countered that the project would help revive Main Street and expand the local tax base.\n\u201cAll of us would love an open park, but the positives this will bring for the greater village far outweigh the negatives,\u201d he said.\nVillage staff also endorsed the plan, citing infrastructure improvements that would boost water pressure and free up nearby street parking. A traffic analysis found the residential project would generate fewer daily trips than the former school use.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A cornerstone of Houston\u2019s modern real estate scene has died.\nDan Moody Jr., co-founder of\nMoody Rambin\n, died Oct. 10 while on vacation in Woodstock, Vermont. He was 84. Moody\u2019s death was announced in an obituary that said he passed peacefully of undisclosed causes. The Houston native spent more than five decades building and reshaping the city\u2019s commercial landscape through his firm, which he founded in 1969 with partner Joseph Rambin III.\nRambin\ndied in 2024 at 79, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe two launched their eponymous company with a focus on zero lot-line residential townhomes before pivoting to the office sector, where they left a distinct architectural mark. Through the 1980s and 1990s, the firm delivered a string of signature business parks \u2014 including\nPost Oak Park\n, Town &amp; Country Office Park, Dairy Ashford Place and Northwest Park \u2014 known for their airy atriums and energy-efficient designs, features that helped redefine the look and feel of Houston\u2019s corporate corridors.\nIn the 1990s, Moody Rambin took on a more personal project: redeveloping\nTown &amp; Country Village\n, a 400,000-square-foot retail center originally built by Moody\u2019s father in the late 1960s. The property remains under Moody Rambin\u2019s ownership and management, a rare feat in a city known for its churn-and-burn development cycles.\n\nMoody\u2019s son, Dan Moody III, joined the company during that same decade, helping expand its portfolio into industrial, retail and multifamily projects. Under the younger Moody\u2019s leadership, the firm has grown to more than 100 employees and remains a mainstay in Houston\u2019s development and management circles.\nA graduate of Lamar High School and the University of Texas, Moody was remembered as a civic-minded developer with deep Houston roots. He was a founding member of Scenic Houston, a nonprofit focused on urban beautification, and contributed to the Methodist Hospital Foundation, the Brookwood Community and the Houston Parks Board.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The sites are 150 East 79th Street, 152 East 79th Street, 154 East 79th Street, 1135 Lexington Avenue and 1131 Lexington Avenue, according to a\nrelease\non the acquisition.\nGregg Winter\u2019s W Financial was the seller of the real estate. The sale of a sixth parcel, at 1133 Lexington Avenue, is expected to close in June, bringing the acquisition cost of the 100,000-square-foot assemblage to $76 million.\nWith a half-dozen sites in hand, Xin plans to pursue her first ground-up development in the city. She\u2019s planning a luxury condominium building with ground-floor retail, projecting demolition to begin in the first quarter of next year.\n\u201cOur thesis is to develop boutique-sized, luxury condos in historic districts across New York City like the Upper East Side, West Village, Chelsea and more,\u201d Xin said in an interview.\nW Financial acquired the assemblage\nthrough a foreclosure sale\nin February 2023 after HFZ defaulted on a $43.6 million loan. The site offers 71,500 square feet of buildable space.\n\nThe Don Filippo pizza restaurant next door, which has served up neighborhood slices for decades, initially agreed to sell to Macklowe Properties, but the agreement was canceled in December 2022. Its presence was once seen as a possible impediment to development, along with\na First Republic Bank branch\nthat closed after the business was sold to JPMorgan Chase.\nLast year, Xin acquired a townhouse at 45 East 74th Street from Italian developer Valerio Morabito, who absorbed\na rare loss\nin the Upper East Side market.\nShe\u2019s developed more than 54 million square feet across Beijing and Shanghai during her prolific property development career. She and her husband stepped down from Soho China in 2022 \u2014 a year after a scuttled takeover attempt by Blackstone \u2014 but she remains on the company board.\nInvestments in the United States have included the GM Building and Park Avenue Plaza in Manhattan, as well as the Lyrik in Boston. Xin\u2019s family office plans to own, operate and develop in those two cities.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

He removed walls separating the study from the kitchen, breakfast room and bathroom and combined them into one open space.

It fetched about 1 percent above its $8.5 million asking price, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The 7,478-square-foot home sold for almost $1,147 per square foot.\nListed Sept. 13 as a \u201ccoming soon\u201d offering, the five-bedroom home quickly drew multiple bids and was under contract by Sept. 24. The deal closed for $80,000 over ask, a clear sign of the competition for\nscarce waterfront listings\n. Agents declined to confirm whether it was a cash deal, though the closing timeframe suggests that\u2019s possible.\nThe home sits on less than half an acre about a mile-and-a-half from downtown\nLake Geneva\n, with 102 feet of lake frontage and two private piers. Built in 2018, the three-level property includes a main-floor primary suite and water views from nearly every room, according to the listing.\nCompass agent Jay Hicks, who represented the buyers, said his clients had been searching for six months to a year before seizing the opportunity. Hicks told the outlet the buyers jumped on the listing. The sellers, represented by @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate agent Gina Nocek, fielded two offers in two days.\n\nThe Bayview sale marks the fifth Lake Geneva property this year to close at\n$8 million\nor more, already surpassing last year\u2019s four, with two more high-end homes under contract. Lakefront listings remain rare, and affluent Chicago buyers continue to treat the resort town about 85 miles northwest of the Loop as their pandemic-era refuge-turned-permanent playground.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a fall sales season like this in a long time,\u201d Nocek told the outlet.\nAt least two additional Lake Geneva properties priced at $8.69 million and $9.8 million are set to close in the next two weeks, both snapped up within days of listing. Whether they\u2019ll join Bayview in closing above the ask remains to be seen.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

It involves four properties: 455 Mission Bay Boulevard South, 1450 Owens Street, 1500 Owens Street and 1700 Owens Street.\nMission Bay, once a dormant railyard area, has become the city\u2019s fastest-rebounding office market. Availability of space has dropped 46 percent over the past two years, fueled by AI-driven leasing activity. OpenAI is reportedly finalizing a lease for about 150,000 square feet at 455 Mission Bay, reinforcing the properties\u2019 appeal to tech firms.\nThe AI firm run by CEO Sam Altman has\nnumerous office addresses\nin the Mission Bay neighborhood.\nAlexandria\u2019s Mission Bay Life Sciences and Technology District was originally approved in 2008 with more than 1 million square feet of office space. With nearly all of that now leased, the developer wants to exercise its right to request additional space under the city\u2019s cap, up to a total entitlement of 2.7 million square feet.\n\nThe current request represents a reallocation of existing space rather than new construction.\nJoel Marcus, founder and executive chairman of Pasadena-based Alexandria, emphasized that AI tenants now play a critical role in shaping San Francisco\u2019s innovation economy. The Planning Department has preliminarily recommended approval of the lab-to-office conversion.\nCBRE Investment Management, in partnership with Alexandria, holds a 75 percent stake in five Mission Bay life science buildings, including the one at 455 Mission Bay.

        "content": "Houston condos might be suffering\n, but agents aren\u2019t worried about the luxury tier.\nThe median price of a Houston condo fell 21 percent year over year in September, according to CoStar. The city overall is in a buyer\u2019s market, sharing with Dallas the stark distinction of having the largest percentage of\ndiscounted sales in the country in August\n.\nThose trends seem to be concentrated in the lower tiers of the market, leaving a wave of\nnew luxury condo developments\nin the Houston metro untroubled so far. Agents are working to fill residences under the\nRitz-Carlton, Auberge and St. Regis brands\n. Despite weakening conditions for the overall market, they say demand for high-end condos remains strong.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a big separation in Houston between aging inventory and new luxury product,\u201d said Catherine Lee, president of new development for Douglas Elliman. \u201cIf anything, luxury has gone the other direction over the past year.\u201d\nThe lower tier seems to be running opposite, thanks in part to Houston having\nmore homes for sale than any other city in America\n. The market\u2019s single-family inventory has been setting records this year, and some residents in older, lower-tier condos are seeing the appeal of cheap houses in the suburbs, according to Martha Turney Sotheby\u2019s International Real Estate agent Rosie Meyers.\n\n\u201cIf you take an old building that\u2019s got lots of problems, then yes, just like\nMiami\n, you\u2019re going to have a lot of depreciation right now because there\u2019s work to be done,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cOur overall high-rise market is very strong because there\u2019s no supply in Houston. I don\u2019t see it devaluating this year in high-rises.\u201d\nLuxury residences like the St. Regis probably aren\u2019t competing for buyers who might see condos as a rung on the ladder to the suburbs. Branded developments are banking on a particular demographic \u2014 generally older, downsizing couples, according to Lee.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more locals being open to getting into condo living,\u201d said Adriana Banks, a Douglas Elliman agent selling the St. Regis Residences.\nLuxury condo developments also tend to offer significant points of difference thanks to more varied floor plans. That keeps them out of the sort of pricing competition that hits low- and mid-tier buildings, according to Douglas Elliman agent Misty Meredith, who\u2019s selling the Mondrian and the Sophie.\n\u201cI think part of that is the life cycle of aging inventory here in Houston. There\u2019s just not new product in that price point being built,\u201d Lee said of cheaper condos. \u201cAnd so you are starting to see some of those challenges with buildings that are greater than 15 years old.\u201d\n",

FiServ has invested more than $65 million into its space and plans future upgrades, the memo noted.\nRockwood and its partner, Joe Cayre\u2019s Midtown Equities, bought the building in 2018 for $140 million and then gut-renovated it, redesigning the lobby and building systems and installing amenities like a fitness center and roof deck with views of the harbor.\nThe property has 10 years of average lease term with more than $180 million of contractual revenue and net operating income of nearly $13 million. With those figures, the deal would work out to a capitalization rate around 7 percent.\nA representative for Rockwood declined to comment.\n\nA Newmark team led by Adam Spies and Marcella Fasulo is overseeing the sales process.\nThis is at least the third property Rockwood\u2019s recently put up for sale.\nLast week, the company, alongside partner the Dermot Company, listed their Lower East Side rental building at 250 East Houston Street, eyeing a price of $115 million. And in June, Rockwood listed its office building at 2 Grand Central Tower, seeking\n$270 million\n.\nRockwood last week announced that it would integrate its operations into Harrison Street Asset Management; the two companies are subsidiaries of Colliers International.\nRockwood managing partners Tyson Skillings and David Becker are remaining in place to oversee their firm\u2019s existing investments and will work on new initiatives as co-chief strategy officers of HSAM.\n",

Turns out, there\u2019s billions of reasons to not even consider it.\nThe capital gains taxes that would come with the sale of the franchise are big, the Miami Herald\nreported\n. It\u2019s possible such a bill could\u2019ve played a role in previous failed efforts to sell stakes in the team.\nRoss\n, chairman and CEO of West Palm Beach-based Related Ross, has been the majority owner of the franchise since 2009, but has been selling off bits and pieces in recent years, bringing his stake down to 84.5 percent. In one hypothetical scenario, a $10 billion sale of his share in the team and the Hard Rock Stadium property could result in a bill for Ross totaling more than $1 billion in capital gains taxes.\nLast year, Ross selling off 13 percent of the team to private equity firm Ares and Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai likely resulted in more than $150 million in capital gains taxes.\nHis family could avoid the capital gains tax if they sold the team after Ross dies, due to special consideration by the Internal Revenue Service. But that could instead trigger an estate tax of more than $2.5 billion, which would likely need to be paid within nine months of his death, the Herald reported.\n\nRoss first invested in the Dolphins in 2008. He acquired 95 percent of the franchise for $1 billion and invested more than $700 million into renovating the Miami Gardens stadium home to the Dolphins. He has subsequently signed deals that brought\nF1\n, the Miami Open tennis tournament, and the FIFA World Cup games next year.\nCitadel\u2019s billionaire founder Ken Griffin reportedly made\nmultiple attempts\nto wrestle the Dolphins from Ross, only for talks to dissipate. In the last two years, an unnamed buyer also made a $10 billion bid for the team, without success.\nMeanwhile, Ross seems content to keep the team in the family. Three years ago, he elevated his daughter, Jennifer, to\nbe his successor\nwith the Dolphins.\nRelated Companies president Bruce Beal was previously considered for the role, but was passed over around the time the NFL punished Ross and Beal\nfor violating the league\u2019s anti-tampering policies\nin their efforts to recruit then-Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady and then-New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The new location at the mall, which spans 3801-3993 Portola Parkway, marks Club Studio\u2019s second Orange County site and sixth in California.\nLaunched three years ago, Club Studio blends high-end amenities, boutique studio classes and wellness services into a single gym experience. It contrasts with traditional big-box gyms and mirrors the niche offerings of Irvine-based Xponential Fitness, which operates brands such as CycleBar and StretchLab in smaller retail slots. Publicly traded Xponential is valued at about $370 million.\nFitness International has annual revenue of more than $1 billion, the Business Journal said. The company, run by CEO David Mathews, operates more than 700 locations nationwide.\nClub Studio\u2019s first OC location opened at Oak Creek Shopping Center, replacing a hardware store. That 36,000-square-foot facility includes cycling, Pilates, hot yoga, boxing, traditional gym equipment and a pool. Club Studio currently operates 15 locations nationwide, with 11 more planned. Some future sites may reach up to 50,000 square feet.\n\nThe Orchard Hills location will feature weightlifting and cardio areas and locker rooms. Fitness classes will include yoga, spin, cardio and Pilates, with class sizes ranging from 30 to 48 customers.\nIn the\nGreater Los Angeles area\n, as malls and retail spaces face increasing vacancies, gym operators like Equinox and Royal Personal Training have signed some of the largest retail leases this year in the L.A. area, according to CoStar.\nFitness memberships climbed to a record 77 million last year from 72.9 million the year before, according to CoStar, citing data from the Health &amp; Fitness Association.

The space spans the top four floors \u2014 each roughly 29,000 square feet \u2014 and is being marketed by Savills and independent broker Todd Chessher, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe move extends Indeed\u2019s continued downsizing at the\nDomain\n, the North Austin business district that\u2019s become a tech hub for firms such as Amazon,\nMeta\nand Vrbo. Indeed has full-building leases at both Domain Tower and the nearby 183,000-square-foot Domain Gateway building at 2900 Esperanza Crossing. It\u2019s also the namesake tenant of the 36-story Indeed Tower downtown, where it\u2019s trying to sublease nearly 98,000 square feet.\nIn all, Indeed controls just under 800,000 square feet citywide and is now marketing about 216,000 square feet for sublease \u2014 a sizable slice of the roughly 4.1 million square feet of sublease inventory currently on the Austin market.\n\nIndeed said in a statement that it continuously evaluates the firm\u2019s office footprint based on employee needs. The company already found subtenants for parts of Domain Gateway, including Dun &amp; Bradstreet and real estate analytics firm Zonda. There are still three floors there that remained available until earlier this year, when CoStar data showed they were pulled from the market in February.\nIndeed\u2019s shifting office strategy is indicative of broader challenges facing Austin\u2019s once red-hot office market. A flood of new deliveries and persistent hybrid work policies have fueled record sublease supply. Indeed\u2019s retrenchment also follows a wave of tech cutbacks and real estate right-sizing across the\ntech sector\n, from\nMeta\u2019s\nAustin exits to\nGoogle\u2019s\nspace consolidations in other major markets.\nIndeed vice president of real estate, David Rudick said last year that the company\u2019s two major Austin hubs \u2014 downtown and the Domain \u2014 were meant to give workers location flexibility and ease commutes. That dual-hub strategy remains intact for the time being.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The true buyer is hidden.\nNick Malinosky and Michael O\u2019Connor with Douglas Elliman had the listing. Nicholas Gonzalez and Matthew Moser with Serhant brought the buyer.\nPerkins\u2019 late husband, Randy Perkins, founded AshBritt, the Deerfield Beach-based disaster relief company now helmed by their daughter, Brittney Perkins Castillo. AshBritt contracts with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for disaster response services in 25 states, including all hurricane states. It worked on the relief efforts for Hurricanes Katrina, Sandy and Irma, and has received lucrative contracts for fire cleanup in California, according to\nCalMatters\n. In 2021, Randy Perkins paid the Federal Election Commission a $125,000 penalty after AshBritt donated $500,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC, according to\nForbes\n. Government contractors are legally barred from donating to political committees.\nRandy Perkins died of a heart attack at the age of 60 in December, according to his obituary in the\nSouth Florida Sun Sentinel\n.\n\nRandy and Saily Perkins bought the Delray Beach home for $18 million in 2021, according to property records. The 9,800-square-foot mansion was built on 0.9 acres in 1994, records show. The couple renovated the home, which now has five bedrooms, two staff or guest bedrooms, nine bathrooms, one half-bathroom, a club room and a pool. The home was sold fully furnished and was designed by Marc Michaels Interiors, the listing shows.\nThe family also purchased the house at 1111 South Ocean Boulevard\nfor $21.1 million\nin 2021. They also own the home next door at 1141 South Ocean Boulevard.\nSaily Perkins listed the mansion at 1171 South Ocean Boulevard for $34 million in August, Zillow shows.\nHers is the latest in a string of pricey closings in Delray Beach in recent weeks.\nEarlier this month, spec developer Mark Pulte sold an oceanfront spec mansion for\n$59 million\n. In the nearby Stone Creek Ranch gated community, Mark Wahlberg bought a mansion for\n$32.6 million\n. Billionaire Quogue Capital founder Wayne Rothbaum also sold two adjacent oceanfront\nlots for $44 million\n, after buying them for $18.3 million.",

The private, for-profit institution, long known for its bold signage and expansive downtown footprint, is listing 10 buildings totaling nearly 375,000 square feet for approximately $130 million. These properties span key neighborhoods including Van Ness Corridor, North Beach, Nob Hill, Civic Center, and Union Square, and include historic landmarks like St. Brigid Church and a 138,000-square-foot office at 150 Hayes Street.\nThis move follows earlier sales of a student dorm at 825 Sutter Street and a Bayview warehouse, reflecting a broader downsizing trend. The university, founded in 1929 by the Stephens family, has been led by President Elisa Stephens since the early 1990s. Under her leadership, the Academy grew rapidly, doubling its property holdings between 1994 and 1998. However, the rise of remote learning and declining on-campus demand have prompted a strategic consolidation.\nThe university cited changing student needs and the growth of hybrid education as key drivers behind the sale. It also recently announced the end of its intercollegiate sports program. Despite the downsizing, the Academy plans to maintain a strong presence in San Francisco.\nThe school\u2019s expansion has not been without controversy. It faced a $60 million settlement in 2016 over zoning violations and unpermitted building conversions, and critics have long accused it of operating in a legal gray area. Additionally, the Academy settled a fraud lawsuit in 2021 and is currently under review by the WASC Senior College and University Commission for issues related to student success metrics and graduation rates. A follow-up accreditation visit is scheduled for this fall. The university remains confident in its compliance and future accreditation status.\n",

The buildings, at 619 and 701 Ocean Front Walk, were once home to Snapchat when the social media company was headquartered in the Silicon Beach neighborhood.\nThe roughly 45,000-square-foot property, which encompasses 10 beachfront live-work lofts (with outdoor patios and balconies, plus private rooftops) and ground-floor retail, was purchased by a company connected to Stefan Ashkenazy \u2014 who owns the Petit Ermitage hotel in West Hollywood. A BrightSpire Capital subsidiary provided a $27 million loan, according to documents signed by Ashkenazy.\nThe seller was a company linked to DLJ Real Estate Capital Partners. A firm managing director, Timan Khoubian, signed the deed. DLJ Real Estate Capital Partners purchased the property, also called Thornton Lofts, for $40.5 million in 2014. None of the parties involved responded to a request for comment.\n\nSnapchat\u2019s parent company, now headquartered in Santa Monica at 3000 31st Street, was housed in a blue beachfront bungalow at 523 Ocean Front Walk on the Venice boardwalk before it expanded throughout the beach. The company, helmed by Evan Spiegel, eventually attempted to\nsublease\nmuch of its Venice office space when it made the move to Santa Monica, but struggled to fill the space. For years, the company\u2019s rise was synonymous with the funky beachside neighborhood and its becoming part of Silicon Beach.\nThe property was marketed as an opportunity for luxury apartment loft rentals, the sale of individual condominiums or a creative office campus, per a brochure. West Los Angeles offices have a 22 percent vacancy rate, according to a third-quarter CBRE report.\nIn other Silicon Beach trades, earlier this year, Google\u2019s Venice office campus, the binoculars-shaped building at 340 West Main Street, went up for\nsale\n. Clarion Partners\nrecently sold\nits 300,000-square-foot business center in Playa Vista, another Silicon Beach neighborhood, to Barings for about $151 million.\n",

If the debt is non-performing or becomes so, Madison Capital could acquire the building through foreclosure or a negotiated transfer.\nJuul purchased the 29-story, 387,000-square-foot office building in June 2019 for $397 million to accommodate its growing workforce. However, regulatory scrutiny over its vaping products led to a sharp decline in valuation and staff reductions.\nBy May 2020, Juul announced its headquarters move to Washington, D.C., and listed the San Francisco building for sale. Multiple sale attempts, including deals with PGIM and Pimco, collapsed in 2020. Madison Capital, which previously partnered with PGIM on a bid, may now engineer a second attempt to acquire the property, likely at a discount price from the pre-pandemic valuation of $1,100 per square foot, or a total of $400 million.\n\nAffinius, formerly Square Mile Capital, originated a $220 million loan for Juul\u2019s acquisition of 123 Mission Street and has since reduced its San Francisco holdings. It recently sold One Montgomery to Empire and partnered with Fortress Investment Group to acquire debt on 600 Battery Street.\nJuul\u2019s\nleasing efforts\nfor 123 Mission also faltered.\nIn 2021, Align Real Estate and Newmark marketed 266,000 square feet for lease, but no deal materialized. Juul reportedly still leases about 62,500 square feet, though current occupancy details remain unclear. The outcome of the debt sale could determine the future of the high-profile downtown asset amid ongoing market uncertainty.\n\u2014\nJoel Russell\n",

        "content": "Fort Worth\u2019s long-awaited plans for the latest redevelopment phase of Panther Island are beginning to take shape, beginning with a call for help to ramp up commercial activity now that the city has boosted densities with new zoning.\nThe Tarrant Regional Water District issued a request for qualifications seeking a private developer for the island just north of downtown, according to an Oct. 16 announcement. The district controls more than 30 acres of developable land and expects that figure to rise once the\nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers\ncompletes $443 million of work for\u00a0 bypass channel construction and removes existing levees over the next decade, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nMeanwhile, the\nFort Worth City Council\nmoved Tuesday to clear the way for new density, unanimously rezoning 15.4 acres between North Commerce Street and the future\nRing Road\nthat now requires building minimums of 5 stories and maximums of 15 stories, according to\ncity documents\n. Last year, the council raised height limits to 20 stories along parts of North Main Street.\nThe new effort comes as TRWD prepares to begin work on the next section of the island\u2019s canal network, with a goal of creating a \u201cdistinctive waterfront experience.\u201d The $50 million phase \u2014 encompassing canals, paseos and park improvements across six acres \u2014 is slated to break ground in mid-2026. Developers must submit their interest by Nov. 7, with applications due Nov. 26. Susan Alanis, the district\u2019s Panther Island program director, told the outlet that a partner could be selected in spring of 2026.\n\n\u201cThe community has been waiting on this for a long time, and it\u2019s going to be a unique waterfront, trail-connected neighborhood\u2026 neatly between the Stockyards, the Cultural District and downtown,\u201d Alanis said.\nTarrant County College is preparing to list the historic\nTXU power plant\nit owns on the island for sale,\naccording\nto the Fort Worth Report. The eight-acre site \u2014 dominated by a 100-year-old brick structure that looms over drivers crossing the Trinity River \u2014 is expected to hit the market Oct. 23, with bids due Nov. 20. Preservationists have voiced concern, but the property could become a high-profile redevelopment at the island\u2019s southern edge, potentially reusing the landmark structure.\nPanther Island\u2019s last major addition was the 300-unit Encore apartments in 2018.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Karp once planned a sprawling two-building development called\nHello Nostrand\non the site.\nBut Karp only finished one of the buildings \u2014 a 93-unit rental building at 21 East 29th Street. It was auctioned in June, along with the undeveloped Nostrand Avenue property, according to a deed filed with the city.\nThe property had been mired in litigation for years. Karp\u2019s Hello Living bought the site for $13 million in 2014 with plans to build a luxury apartment complex. But as soon as construction started, he ran into trouble with lenders.\nKarp put the property into\nbankruptcy\nin 2021, one day before senior lender\nMadison Realty Capital\ncould initiate a UCC foreclosure process. Madison then sold the $6 million mezzanine loan and $73 million senior loan on the property to another firm, Arch Companies, which then sued Karp to initiate another foreclosure on the property.\n\nIn that suit, Arch alleged the project\u2019s ownership entity improperly entered into a master lease with a tenant that would defer rent payments for months and could disqualify the property from the 421a tax break.\nThen Arch ran into\ntrouble of its own\n, and Karp agreed to the bankruptcy sale. Madison later took back over the senior loan.\nKarp was once a promising developer who bet on building luxury rental apartments in less gentrified Brooklyn neighborhoods. All of his projects had \u201cHello\u201d in their names and stood out for their sleek designs, which appeared out of character next to neighboring buildings.\nAnother Karp property at 2417 Albemarle Road\nwas auctioned\nlast year and went to the lender in a credit bid.\n",

        "pub_date_dt": "2025-10-23T11:30:00",
        "content": "ICYMI, sidewalk sheds are top of mind for Zohran Mamdani.\nBlessedly, the Democratic nominee has not (yet?) introduced his own shed wordplay (however, in a video posted to social media, he did adopt Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine\u2019s call to action, \u201cShed the Shed\u201d).\nBut this week, he rolled out a few proposals to put his own stamp on the issue.\nHis proposals include removing any shed that has sat on a city property for more than three years. To do this, he says he will prioritize funding for the repairs necessary to remove the structures. He also wants to invest in preventative maintenance to ensure that fewer sheds are needed.\nIt is unclear how much all of that would cost, but the\nNew York Post reported\nin March that sheds at 130 city-owned properties had been up for more than three years.\nMamdani also wants to double the amount of time between required fa\u00e7ade inspections for newer buildings. Such inspections take place every five years; he wants inspections at newer buildings to take place every 10 years.\nIf this reform sounds familiar, it is because the City Council made a similar change this year, as part of a\npackage of bills\naimed at clearing city streets of long-standing sheds. The law required the Department of Buildings to study \u201cthe appropriate time period\u201d for such inspections and to recommend a new inspection schedule that shifts the interval from every five years to between six and 12 years. Though the inspection timeline would likely differ depending on building materials and other factors, the law indicated that new buildings should have their first fa\u00e7ade inspection eight years after being built, rather than five.\nThe law gave DOB until the end of December 2025 to provide these recommendations to the City Council. (Notably, if the 10-year rule for new buildings were in place a decade ago,\n432 Park Avenue\nwould be coming up on its first required inspection this December.) A DOB spokesperson indicated that the agency is on track to meet that deadline.\nMamdani also indicated this week that he wants to implement \u201cnew safer, brighter scaffolding design standards.\u201d\nAs part of that\nbill package\napproved in March, the City Council expanded the permitted color palette for these sheds, but not by much. Instead of just hunter green, the sheds can now be metallic gray, white or \u201ca color matching the fa\u00e7ade, trim, cornice, or roof of the building.\u201d The\nlaw\nthat allowed more color also required the DOB to study if changes could be made to shed design to \u201cimprove the pedestrian experience, including designs that are unobtrusive and aesthetically pleasing, without diminishing the safety of such sidewalk shed.\u201d\nThat study was due at the end of September. A spokesperson for the DOB said the agency expects to release upgraded designs soon.\nInterestingly, Mamdani\u2019s announcement didn\u2019t put much emphasis on ramping up fines or enforcement against property owners with long-term sheds, though he did indicate that he would \u201caggressively pursue enforcement.\u201d On social media, Mamdani said the Adams administration barely put the City Council\u2019s bills to use.\u00a0(One law that creates new penalties for owners who do not move forward with repairs in a timely manner, does not go into effect until next year.)\n\nSince the administration launched its \u201cGet Sheds Down\u201d initiative in 2023, 14,593 sheds have been removed from city streets, according to the DOB. Of course, new sheds have also popped up in that time, meaning that the city has seen a net drop of 818 sheds on city streets compared to July 2023.\nFor his part, Mayor Eric Adams appeared unimpressed by Mamdani\u2019s proposals. He reposted Mamdani\u2019s sidewalk shed announcement on X, adding: \u201c\u2018Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, that mediocrity can pay to greatness.\u2019\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Did you watch the second mayoral debate? Send me your reactions at\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nSix groups have joined Yes on Affordable Housing, a coalition that supports the housing-related ballot questions. Asian Americans for Equality, SAGE, Lambda Independent Democrats, Chinatown Partnership, Center for an Urban Future and Eleanor Roosevelt Independent Democrats Club joined the coalition and endorsed the four land use-related ballot questions, the coalition announced this week.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 The scene of a federal raid in Chinatown was largely deserted on Wednesday,\nGothamist reports\n. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers on Tuesday descended on a stretch of Canal Street where vendors have long sold counterfeit merchandise on the sidewalk. Officials said the raid was \u201cfocused on criminal activity relating to selling counterfeit goods\u201d and resulted in the arrest of nine West African immigrants. Another four people were arrested for allegedly assaulting a law enforcement officer, and one person was arrested on charges of obstructing law enforcement by blocking a driveway.\n\u2014 Assembly member Deborah Glick on Wednesday announced that she will not run for re-election next year. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I could continue to dedicate 100 percent of my energy beyond next year,\u201d she said. Glick has represented parts of Lower Manhattan for 35 years.\n\u2014 Referencing a scene in the movie \u201cBraveheart\u201d where Mel Gibson\u2019s character is executed (sorry, spoiler, but come on), Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa said he would rather be impaled than quit the mayoral race and work for Andrew Cuomo,\nPolitico New York reports\n.\u00a0 \u201cIf all of a sudden the executioner would have stopped, and I was on that gurney, and [he] said, \u2018Hey, you can work for Mayor Andrew Cuomo,\u2019 I would say: \u2018Finish the job. Impale me.\u2019 That will never happen,\u201d Sliwa said during a radio interview on WABC.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was a sponsor condominium unit at 53 West 53rd Street in Midtown, developed by Pontiac Land Group and Hines. The buyer was Mansion in NY Corporation, which paid $5.6 million for the pad. The 2,500-square-foot unit, which has been on and off the market for a decade, has three bedrooms and three and a half baths. The unit\u2019s most recent asking price was $7.4 million. Douglas Elliman\u2019s Renee Micheli, Jade Chan, Frances Katzen and Michelle Griffith\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded in the Big Apple was for a 12-square-foot sign. Broadway producer John Gore\u2019s John Gore Organization dropped $12.2 million \u2014 over $1 million per square foot \u2014 to take over signage at the Brill building at 1619 Broadway in Times Square. Gore earlier this year paid nearly $29 million for six other condos at the historic property. The seller was Mack Real Estate Group.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$12 million\nfor a 3,700-square-foot condo at 720 West End Avenue on the Upper West Side. Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 56,662-square-foot, five-story high school building at 111-32 66 Road in Forest Hills. Michael Freedman of MDSzerbaty Associates Architecture filed the permit on behalf of the New York City School Construction Authority.\u2014\nMatthew Elo, Mary Diduch",

        "content": "With Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa heckling him on stage, Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani stuck to his refusal to take sides: \u201cI have not yet taken a position,\u201d he said.\nMamdani was referring to three controversial housing-related\nballot measures\n, which Cuomo supports and Sliwa opposes.\nDuring the second and final mayoral debate ahead of the general election on Wednesday, NY1\u2019s Errol Louis asked Mamdani directly about the measures, which would consolidate the city\u2019s land use process and weaken the City Council\u2019s power over certain affordable housing projects.\nMamdani repeated a response he had previously given, that he appreciates that voters will be able to consider these issues. The answer comes just a few days before early voting starts, when New Yorkers will begin flipping over their ballots and voting on these questions.\nHe also noted the importance of ensuring that ramping up construction creates \u201cgood jobs,\u201d likely a nod to concerns from the city\u2019s unions \u2014\u00a0including 32BJ SEIU and the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council, which\nendorsed\nMamdani after the primary \u2014\u00a0that the measures remove their leverage in rezoning negotiations.\nWhen pressed to state his position \u2014 Sliwa and Cuomo repeated, \u201cYes or no?\u201d and then Louis also asked for clarity \u2014 Mamdani said he has not yet taken one.\n\u201cOh, what a shocker,\u201d Cuomo said.\nThe most contentious of the housing ballot proposals seeks to, in some cases, remove City Council review of housing projects and create an appeals board to reverse the Council\u2019s rejection of rezonings that result in affordable housing.\nThe reference to the ballot measures came up after moderators asked the candidates how they plan to meet the city\u2019s needs for more housing.\nThe candidates largely answered with responses they\u2019ve previously provided. Mamdani said he would streamline the building process for the private sector, ramp up construction near mass transit and scale up the city\u2019s programs for subsidizing deeply affordable housing.\nCuomo said he would \u201credo\u201d the Department of Housing Preservation and Development and\u00a0 \u201cchange the entire organizational structure.\u201d He said \u201chundreds if not thousands\u201d of units of housing need to be built simultaneously by the public and private sectors, a less intense version of his\nprevious calls\nto initiate 500,000 affordable units across 300 sites at once \u2014\u00a0an idea that defies the realities of construction and financing capacity.\nMamdani and Cuomo traded barbs on their respective housing records. At one point, pushing back on Mamdani\u2019s comments that he must have \u201crun an incompetent government\u201d given the pace of housing construction when he was governor, Cuomo said the governor doesn\u2019t build housing but provides financing to the city. However, the state plays a significant role in housing policy, and also steers construction of housing on\nstate-owned sites\n.\n\nSliwa emphasized the opportunities to convert vacant office buildings into housing and confirmed that he believes local City Council members should have veto power over projects in their districts. He said the ballot questions were a gift from Mayor Eric Adams to the real estate industry.\n\u201cHe went wild taking care of his developer friends,\u201d Sliwa said. He also said that Cuomo was in the \u201cback pockets of the developers who wine, dined and pocket-lined\u201d him.\nMamdani\u2019s pledge to\nfreeze rents\nfor stabilized tenants came up early in the debate. Cuomo called the promise \u201cB.S.\u201d because annual rent increases are decided by the city\u2019s\nRent Guidelines Board\n, not the mayor.\n\u201cNothing is going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just more political blather.\u201d\n\u201cIf you want a candidate for mayor who tells you everything that he cannot do, then Andrew Cuomo should be your choice,\u201d Mamdani fired back.\nCuomo also noted that Mamdani cannot immediately appoint new members of the board, who serve between two- and four-year terms. In fact, Adams is\nreportedly\nconsidering replacing six members\u2019 whose terms have ended before he leaves office.\nIn the final debate before the general election, not much new was revealed about the candidates\u2019 positions on housing and real estate-related issues.\nAt one point, however, candidates were asked if they support a casino in the five boroughs. Sliwa said, only if supported by the local communities, and Mamdani said that while he has reservations about casinos, he recognizes that state law allows for up to three licenses to be awarded.\nCuomo said he has not reviewed the proposals, and said he \u201chad no part\u201d in bringing three casinos to the city. That\u2019s incorrect: He was\ngovernor\nwhen voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2013 to expand gambling in the state, and supported the change. Still, on Wednesday, he called the casinos \u201chighly problematic.\u201d\nSuch a comment puts him at odds with the construction unions that\nbacked\nhis campaign ahead of the June primary. While many major unions endorsed Mamdani after the primary, many construction unions have\nheld off\non announcing who they will support in the general election.\n",

The Nafzgers have held the Del Mar beach property for decades.\nInitially listed at $75 million in\nNovember 2024\n, the price was reduced to $59.5 million by this June. Even at the discounted rate, the property at 2920 Camino Del Mar remained the priciest single-family home on the market in Del Mar, a coastal enclave known for attracting high net worth residents, including the Bill Gates family.\nListing agent Rande Turner of Pacific Sotheby\u2019s International Realty described the transaction as \u201ca remarkable sale for San Diego coastal real estate.\u201d\nThe compound features a 4,500-square-foot main residence with five bedrooms and an open-air ping-pong pavilion by the pool. It also has two guesthouses and a private beach accessible via a gated entry. The development process spanned over a decade, involving extensive permitting and the construction of a new sea wall, according to the Journal.\n\nSandra Naftzger and her sister sold the N3 Cattle Company ranch near Oakland in 2022 for $68 million.

        "content": "Atlantic Pacific Companies and the Archdiocese of Miami want to develop a 600-unit affordable apartment complex next to the St. Martin de Porres Catholic Church in Leisure City.\nMiami-based Atlantic Pacific and the Archdiocese of Miami propose the complex with five apartment buildings with roughly 120 units each at 28520 Southwest 148th Avenue in unincorporated Miami-Dade County, according to the developers\u2019 application filed to the county last week. Designed by Corwil Architects, the project, called St. Martin de Porres Residences, also would have two garages, one four stories and the other five stories, according to a preliminary site plan.\nAtlantic Pacific and the Archdiocese of Miami are asking the county for a zoning verification for the first 147 units.\nAn existing Catholic church and a child care center on a portion of the site will remain, and the project would be built on the vacant west portion of the property.\nThe Archdiocese of Miami is led by Archbishop Thomas Wenski.\nAtlantic Pacific, led by Howard Cohen, is a prolific affordable and workforce housing developer. In Miami\u2019s Overtown neighborhood, the firm wants to build an\neight-story, 375-unit\nbuilding with below-market rate apartments at 800 Northwest Fifth Avenue, near the Culmer Metrorail station.\n\nAtlantic Pacific also proposes to redevelop the long-closed Carver Theater in Miami\u2019s Liberty City with an\n11-story, 71-unit\naffordable apartment building. Nonprofit Martin Luther King Economic Development Corporation is partnering on the project at 6016 Northwest Seventh Avenue.\nIn south Miami-Dade, Atlantic Pacific is developing the multi-phase\nQuail Roost Transit Village\non roughly 9 acres on the southwest corner of Southwest 184th Street and the busway in the Perrine neighborhood. The entire project will have about 500 units, including workforce and affordable apartments.\nSouth Miami-Dade has become a magnet for developers. The area is home to the county\u2019s biggest supply of buildable land.\nIn Princeton, Paxton Development Group proposes a\n230-unit\naffordable apartment complex at 13850 Southwest 248th Street. Vestcor plans the\n590-unit\nAmbar Station at 27742, 27860 and 27862 South Dixie Highway in Leisure City.\nArgentine developers Martin Racca and Pablo Buttice want to develop a\n25-story, 300-unit\nLive Local Act tower on the northeast corner of Southwest 214th Street and U.S. 1/South Dixie Highway in Goulds.\n",

        "content": "After city leaders lost a summer-long legal skirmish to postpone Miami\u2019s November election to next year, the mayor\u2019s race and two city commission races are back on. Now, all eyes are on the battle royale to replace termed out incumbent mayor\nFrancis Suarez\n, in a fight featuring 13 contenders.\nSeven candidates are new faces to Miami\u2019s rough-and-tumble political scene and are not expected to make much noise. But the other six candidates represent a mix of Miami\u2019s longtime political dynasties and a recent wave of upstarts promising an end to the dysfunctional corruption that\u2019s permeated city hall in recent years.\nOn the real estate front, the sextet all preach about bringing more affordable and workforce apartments to a city that is among the most expensive rental markets in the nation. Given the wide open nature of the mayor\u2019s race, real estate bigwigs are hedging their bets \u2013 in some cases donating to more than one of the six establishment candidates. These candidates are Miami city commissioner\nJoe Carollo\n, ex-Miami city commissioner\nAlex Diaz de la Portilla\n, former Miami City Manager Emilio Gonzalez, Miami-Dade County commissioner Eileen Higgins, ex-Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez, and another former Miami city commissioner,\nKen Russell\n.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the top donors to each candidate, according to an analysis of campaign finance reports:\nThe $100K club\nDiaz de la Portilla can thank real estate investors\nDavid and Leila Centner\nfor helping fill the coffers of his political action committee, Proven Leadership for Miami-Dade County. In April, the Miami Beach power couple donated $100,000, representing nearly half of the committee\u2019s haul in the three months ended in June. The PAC reported zero contributions between July and September, the most recent campaign finance filing period.\nIn an email, David Centner declined comment.\nThe\nCentners\nplayed a key role in Diaz de la Portilla being removed from office two years ago when he was criminally charged with money laundering, bribery and other felonies. In 2023, state prosecutors alleged\nDiaz de la Portilla\n, then a city commissioner since 2019, steered a no-bid deal to give the Centners control of a city park where they planned to build a $10 million youth sports complex next to one of the couple\u2019s Centner Academy campuses. In exchange, Diaz de la Portilla\u2019s PAC allegedly received $245,000 in contributions from a Centner entity via their then-lobbyist, William Riley Jr., who was also criminally charged.\nLast year, authorities dropped the case against Diaz de la Portilla and Riley, citing \u201cunreliable\u201d witness testimony.\nRiley\n, a lawyer, has a pending lawsuit against the Centners alleging they let him take the fall. Meanwhile, the couple is suing the Miami Herald for defamation.\nAside from Diaz de la Portilla, Carollo is the only other mayoral candidate to score $100,000 or more from a single donor. A polarizing figure in Miami politics, Carollo served as Miami mayor from 1997 to 2001, and returned to city hall when he was elected city commissioner in 2017. In 2023, a federal jury slapped Carollo with a\n$63 million\njudgment after finding him guilty of violating the rights of Little Havana developers Bill Fuller and Martin Pinilla. Carollo allegedly mounted a code enforcement\u00a0 campaign against the duo\u2019s properties and businesses because they supported his political opponent in 2017.\nBut his tussle with Fuller and Pinilla hasn\u2019t given other developers pause. Entities controlled by JDS Development Group\u2019s Michael Stern donated a combined $125,000 to Carollo\u2019s Miami First political action committee. Stern\u2019s firm is developing a\nDolce &amp; Gabbana-branded condo-hotel\nin Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood. Stern did not respond to requests for comment.\nMiami First also received a combined $120,000 from entities managed by Nuri Dorra, who is co-developing Essence Miami, a multifamily project with 88 affordable and workforce housing apartments in Little Havana that received $5 million from a city bond program.\n\u201cWhen you are working as a commissioner you do good things and some things that people think are bad,\u201d Dorra told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cI believe Joe Carollo has done a lot of stuff that is very good for the community.\u201d\nDonors spreading out\n\nSome donors are financially supporting more than one candidate for mayor. For instance, David Martin\u2019s Coconut Grove-based\nTerra\nappears to favor Higgins, but also donated to Carollo\u2019s committee and a PAC backing Suarez.\nTo run for Miami mayor, Higgins is resigning her county commission seat less than a year after being reelected without opposition. Suarez, whose son is current Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, served as a county commissioner from 2011 to 2020. Before that, he was Miami\u2019s mayor from 1985 until 1993. He won a comeback bid in 1997, but his victory was overturned due to rampant voter fraud.\nEntities with the same address as Terra have contributed a combined $67,500 to Higgins\u2019 individual campaign account, as well as three political action committees supporting her candidacy, finance reports show.\nTerra entities also gave a combined $10,000 to Suarez\u2019s Community First PAC, and $2,500 to Carollo\u2019s Miami First committee. Terra did not respond to a request for comment.\nThree other Coconut Grove-based firms donating to more than one candidate are\nSwerdlow Group\n, the Related Group and 13th Floor Investments. Swerdlow affiliates donated $50,000 to Carollo\u2019s committee, as well as $10,000 to Ethical Leadership for Miami, a PAC backing Higgins.\nThrough four entities,\nRelated\ndonated a combined $50,000 to Higgins\u2019 committee, and another $10,000 to Community First, the PAC backing Suarez.\n13th Floor gave $25,000 to Carollo\u2019s PAC and $15,000 to Suarez\u2019s PAC.\n13th Floor\n\u2019s managing principal Arnaud Karsenti donated $2,500 to Higgins\u2019 PAC.\nRepresentatives for Swerdlow, Related and 13th Floor did not respond to requests for comment.\nOther donors to multiple candidates include affiliates of Craig Robins\u2019 Miami-based Dacra, New York-based Ashkenazy Acquisitions and Miami-based land use law firm Bercow Radell Fernandez Larkin &amp; Tapanes.\nThe Dacra affiliates donated a combined $10,000 to Carollo\u2019s PAC, and $5,000 to Higgins\u2019 PAC.\nBayside Marketplace\n, which is owned by Ashkenazy, gave $30,000 to Carollo\u2019s Miami First and $15,000 to Suarez\u2019s Community First. Bercow Radell donated $10,000 each to committees backing Carollo, Higgins and Suarez.\nRobins\nand Ashkenazy did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, Bercow Radell partner Melissa Tapanes Llahues addressed the law firm\u2019s contributions to Carollo and Higgins, but not Suarez.\n\u201cAs a Miami-based firm, we closely follow local elections and have supported incumbent officials running for higher office,\u201d Llahues said. \u201cIn addition to our contribution to Commissioner Carollo, we also supported Commissioner Eileen Higgins, recognizing her commitment to Miami\u2019s future.\u201d\nDonors to Gonzalez and Russell\nWhile most of Miami\u2019s real estate titans are lining up with Carollo, Higgins and Suarez, a few have thrown their financial support behind Gonzalez and Russell. Gonzalez is a former city manager who testified against Carollo in the civil case brought by\nFuller and Pinilla\n. Gonzalez also successfully sued the city of Miami to hold the election this year, alleging city leaders violated the city charter. Russell is a former Miami city commissioner who resigned before his second term was completed so he could run unsuccessfully for Congress.\nSix entities tied to Fuller and Pinilla donated a combined $20,000 to Gonzalez\u2019s Mission Miami PAC, while Miami-based\nCMC Group\n, led by Ugo Columbo, gave $10,000 to Russell\u2019s committee, Breaking the Wheel.",

        "content": "Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s plan to declare a record $1 billion tax-increment financing surplus to help cover a new Chicago Public Schools contract set off a rare wave of unified opposition at City Hall this week, with aldermen warning that the move would gut neighborhood development projects across the city.\nThe proposal \u2014 a centerpiece of Johnson\u2019s $16.6 billion\nbudget\nunveiled this week \u2014 would divert $552.4 million of TIF dollars to CPS, with the rest going to other taxing bodies, in what critics described as a \u201cbailout\u201d for the school system at the expense of parks, libraries and economic development initiatives, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n.\nEven Johnson\u2019s allies bristled. Alderman Michelle Harris of the 8th Ward, who chairs the City Council\u2019s rules committee, said the \u201cdrastic sweep\u201d could cripple future projects in South Side communities that rely heavily on TIF funding.\n\u201cUnintentionally or intentionally, we will lose projects in communities of color,\u201d Harris said at the meeting.\nBudget Director Annette Guzman defended the proposal, insisting that no existing or approved projects were cut to create the surplus, and that 83 percent of the city\u2019s 108 TIFs are netting year-over-year growth. Guzman said replenishment of funds was expected as\nproperty\nvalues within the TIF districts continue to rise.\nStill, the backlash was immediate. Alderman Nicole Lee of the 11th Ward said she was blindsided by the plan, calling it \u201coff-putting\u201d that affected wards were not consulted.\n\nAlderman Jason Ervin of the 28th Ward, the powerful Budget Committee chair, joined the pushback, noting that about 70 percent of the TIF surplus would come out of economically disadvantaged areas.\nErvin further demanded that CPS repay the city for a disputed $175 million pension payment for nonteaching employees \u2014 the same issue that prompted the mass resignation of the mayor\u2019s appointed school board and the firing of\nCEO Pedro Martinez\nearlier this fall.\nThe fight over the TIF sweep overshadowed debate on Johnson\u2019s other revenue-raising ideas, including a $21-per-month\ncorporate head tax\nand a 14 percent cloud computing levy \u2014 both decried by business groups as potential \u201cjob killers.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The loan will retire existing debt and help to fund upcoming leasing efforts.\nA JLL Capital Markets team of Aaron Niedermayer, Kellogg Gaines and Evan Pariser arranged the debt.\nThe 1.2-million-square-foot property at 1 Ridge Hill Boulevard, which first opened in 2011, features a number of well-established tenants, including Apple, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Whole Foods Market, T.J. Maxx and Lowe\u2019s.\nBeyond the traditional retail options, there are also restaurants, a Legoland Discovery Center, a 12-screen movie theater, an indoor skydiving center and an LA Fitness gym.\nOwnership recently completed work on a 17,000-square-foot activity zone for families and a 25,000-square-foot \u201cTown Square\u201d community hub. In the last three years, tenants have signed deals for 679,000 square feet at Ridge Hill, which traded hands in 2022\nfor $220 million\n.\n\nThis is the second significant refinancing deal on Ridge Hill Boulevard in Yonkers in a matter of weeks.\nAt the start of the month, Azorim North America landed a loan to refinance Mizora at Ridge Hill, a 364-unit multifamily complex down the road.

The building is part of the 555 California Street complex owned by Vornado Realty Trust and the Trump Organization.\nThe business school will lease the Cube for more than a decade and is expected to move into the building in the next year and a half. The institution\u2019s current San Francisco location at 2 Harrison Street, which it shares with Google, has gotten too small after the search engine company grew its footprint in the two-building office property on the Embarcadero earlier this year. The school has had a presence in San Francisco for about 25 years, and for the past decade, Wharton has leased about 35,000 square feet at the Harrison Street building, known as Hills Plaza.\nThe expansion comes as the school grows its tech-focused offerings, including a new master of business administration degree in artificial intelligence starting this fall. The Trump Organization owns a 30 percent stake in the 1.8-million-square-foot complex, which comprises the 52-story skyscraper at\n555 California Street\nand two adjacent buildings at 315 and 345 Montgomery Street. The Cube rises five stories and will serve as the dedicated building for Wharton\u2019s Bay Area activities. The school will also have its campus next to high-profile financial clients at 555 California like Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Dodge &amp; Cox and UBS.\n\nWharton\u2019s San Francisco satellite campus currently serves approximately 220 students. The Institute of Contemporary Art San Francisco, which\noccupied 26,000 square feet of the Cube rent-free\n, will move out next year.\nThe school\u2019s growth comes as another top-tier university, Nashville-based Vanderbilt,\nnarrows its search\nfor a place to call home in San Francisco. Vanderbilt has been\nworking with Mayor Daniel Lurie\u2019s office\nto determine the best path forward for its West Coast outpost.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "SpaceX has settled a lawsuit brought by Cards Against Humanity in September, ending a quirky\nTexas land dispute\nbetween the rocket maker and the Chicago-based game company known for its dark humor.\nTexas court records show the settlement was reached last month, just ahead of a Nov. 3 jury trial. Terms weren\u2019t disclosed, and neither SpaceX nor its attorney responded to requests for comment, according to the Associated Press, which first\nreported\nthe development.\nThe dispute centered on a patch of land in\nCameron County\n, at the southern tip of Texas near SpaceX\u2019s\nStarbase\nlaunch site. Cards Against Humanity presumably paid more than $2 million for the parcel\u00a0 in 2017 as part of a plan to send a message of opposition to\u00a0 then-President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed border wall. The company raised money from 150,000 fans who each chipped in $15 to \u201csave America\u2019s future\u201d by purchasing and preserving the land.\nIn its lawsuit, the card company claimed SpaceX encroached on its property for at least six months, using it as a dumping ground for gravel, debris and other construction materials as the company expanded its rocket testing operations nearby. Court filings show SpaceX admitted to trespassing during discovery, though the extent of the damage was disputed.\nCards Against Humanity had sought $15 million in damages, citing environmental harm and loss of vegetation.\nWhile the settlement amount remains confidential, the card company told the outlet it likely wouldn\u2019t have recovered much even if it won at trial.\n\n\u201cThe upside is that SpaceX has removed their construction equipment from our land and we\u2019re able to work with a local landscaping company to restore the land to its natural state: devoid of space garbage and pointless border walls,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nThe company hinted that proceeds from the settlement could help repay donors, though it downplayed expectations.\n\u201cWere we hoping to be able to pay all our fans? Sure. But we did warn them they would \u2018probably only be able to get like $2 or most likely nothing,\u2019\u201d it said.\nThe agreement closes another chapter in SpaceX\u2019s ongoing\nproperty disputes\nin South Texas, where rapid expansion around Starbase has clashed with locals.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

It\u2019s offloading part of that space to a subtenant.\nTransportation technology firm Verra Mobility is subleasing 57,000 square feet at the Financial District building, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The 10-year deal gives the company a new Northeast headquarters, which was temporarily located on Broad Street.\nAsking rent for the second-floor space at the property \u2014 owned by the Retirement Systems of Alabama \u2014 was not disclosed. The average asking rent in Lower Manhattan during the third quarter was $57.95 per square foot, according to CBRE.\nNewmark\u2018s Ira Rovitz, Chris Ventura and Rohan Kapoor represented Verra, while CBRE\u2019s Paul Haskin represented EmblemHealth, formerly known as the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York.\nIn May 2019, EmblemHealth\nleased 440,000 square feet\nacross 13 floors in a 15-year renewal at the building. The deal came a year after the company was said to be considering leaving the building and subleasing its space.\n\nThe 53-story building has been home to a couple of significant leasing deals this year. In April, telecommunications service provider MetTel expanded to 69,000 square feet. Two months later, engineering consultancy firm Jaros, Baum &amp; Bolles signed on for 68,000 square feet.\nIn April 2022, not-for-profit health care system MJHS signed a lease for\nmore than 138,000 square feet\n, the largest new lease in lower Manhattan in an 18-month span at the time, according to CBRE.\nSublet supply \u2014 a pandemic-era albatross \u2014 has\ndeclined by nearly 40 percent\nin two years and is back near pre-pandemic levels, according to a monthly office report from Colliers.\nTenants took 9.4 million square feet in the third quarter, a 2 percent jump from the second quarter and almost 27 percent higher than the five-year quarterly average. Leasing volume also surpassed 30 million square feet for the entire year, surging past pre-Covid levels and marking the strongest period of year-to-date demand since 2002.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Chicago investor Bill Silverstein is betting on an adaptive reuse project near Oz Park within the coveted Lincoln Park neighborhood.\nSandz Development sold the\nWebster Square Apartments\nfor $35.8 million, marking the latest turnover at the former Lincoln Park Hospital site, which sits inside one of Chicago\u2019s priciest neighborhoods for rentals, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nSilverstein, founder of\nBeal Properties\n, bought the 75-unit building at 558 West Webster Avenue, according to Triton Realty Group, which brokered the deal for both parties. The property includes nearly 20,000 square feet of ground-floor retail and sits in the heart of Lincoln Park, where rental demand remains among the strongest in the city with average unit leases exceeding $2,000 monthly.\nSandz converted part of the shuttered hospital campus into apartments in 2014, following years of planning and neighborhood wrangling over density and traffic. The broader\nWebster Square redevelopment\nadded condos and single-family homes, as well, cementing the site as one of the more successful examples of an institutional property\u2019s reuse on the North Side.\nThe building\u2019s appeal rests as much on its design as its ZIP code.\n\n\u201cThis transaction demonstrates the enduring value of quality real estate in highly walkable, lifestyle-driven neighborhoods,\u201d\nTriton president Matthew Fritzshall\nsaid in a statement. \u201cWebster Square is an exceptional example of modern adaptive reuse paired with timeless architectural character.\u201d\nRents in the North Lakefront submarket \u2014 which includes Lincoln Park \u2014 average $2,120 per month, according to CoStar data, and are expected to rise amid a slowdown in new multifamily construction. That dynamic has made well-located properties like Webster Square competitive for long-term investors seeking stable cash flow and appreciation potential.\nSandz financed the 2014 project with a $20 million construction loan, though the total redevelopment cost remains unclear. A Sandz executive declined the outlet\u2019s request for comment on the recent sale. Beal, which controls dozens of North Side apartment buildings and suburban holdings, didn\u2019t return a Crain\u2019s request for comment.\nSilverstein\u2019s outfit has recently scooped up several North Side multifamily properties, as he\u2019s active in the mid-market apartment space as well as Chicago\u2019s condo deconversion game. Earlier this year, Beal Properties picked up a 94-unit\nGold Coast\nhigh rise at 1344 North Dearborn Street for $27 million. In 2023 he bought a 60-unit apartment building at 528 West Oakdale Avenue from Chicago-based Horizon for $17.5 million and a 56-unit apartment building at\n656 West Wrightwood Avenue\nfrom JAB Real Estate for $14.1 million in 2022.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Barnes Coy Architects designed the home, which was freshly completed when Oringer swooped in.\nOn an estate more than two acres large, the eight-bedroom modern home features a gym, game room and media room.

Carlos also gave up his stake in Sergio Pino\u2019s Key Largo vacation home, and Century Homebuilders, which Tatiana Pino leads and owns fully, will forgive a nearly $700,000 debt owed by Carlos Pino.\nThe resolution confirms that Tatiana Pino is entitled to full ownership of Century Homebuilders, according to the Herald.\u00a0 When he founded the company in 2013, he and his wife were each entitled to 50 percent of the company. It became one of the largest Hispanic-owned homebuilders nationwide and has more than two dozen residential projects in Florida.\nLegal challenges to Sergio Pino\u2019s probate estate remain.\nIn September, Tatiana Pino and her daughters\nfiled a new lawsuit\nagainst Sergio Pino\u2019s longtime girlfriend, Nancy Pastor, and others that Tatiana Pino and her daughters claim were involved in allegedly fraudulent transfers in the days before and after his suicide.\n\nThat lawsuit centers on trust and lease documents, including a 99-year lease, which the plaintiffs claim were created or amended to minimize Tatiana Pino\u2019s ownership and benefit Pastor, without the consent of the bank, project partners or Tatiana Pino.\nSergio and Tatiana Pino were in the midst of a highly contentious divorce when he died. Sergio Pino began dating in the early 2000s, according to court filings.\nSeven of the nine men who have been charged in the murder-for-hire case have pleaded guilty in federal court.\n\u2014 Katherine Kallergis\n",

        "content": "Legal troubles are piling up for single-family home rehabbers Chris and Aneta Urban, who are facing a new string of lawsuits over unpaid loans and ballooning debt tied to a large portfolio in Chicago\u2019s South Side and south suburbs.\nThe brother-and-sister investors have been hit with dozens of foreclosure lawsuits for failure to pay debts across their vast fix-and-flip portfolio of more than 100 properties. Many were\nbrought by individual investors\nwhom they met through a local real estate training school. Andrew Holmes, Chris Urban\u2019s former mentor and the head of the Andrew Holmes Mastery Program, is also suing the siblings for fraud, accusing Chris of taking loans meant for construction and using them to pay off other loans across his troubled properties.\nThe Urbans had been buying and flipping properties in the South Side since 2019, starting with sales and later venturing into rentals. They began having trouble paying their debts last year,\nThe Real Deal previously reported\n.\nFive new lawsuits filed since the beginning of October represent a combined $1.5 million in unpaid debt that plaintiffs want to recover. One was brought by an investor that Holmes accused of being part of the Urbans\u2019 allegedly fraudulent scheme, Shirley Pollock. Through her company Best Funding Solutions LLC, Pollock is now seeking to foreclose on three properties where she loaned Urban money that hasn\u2019t been repaid.\nAnother investor is looking to foreclose on two properties where he loaned the Urbans money. A third is taking a different approach, by filing a breach of contract lawsuit demanding payment for a mortgage on a South Side property, but not seeking to foreclose it. Plus, a business loan company is seeking repayment on a second loan to Urban that went bad in late 2024.\nUrban declined to comment on the new lawsuits, stating he would resolve the matters \u201cthrough the courts, not the media.\u201d\nBest Funding Solutions\nA frequent investor in the Urbans\u2019 properties, Shirley Pollock began investing with the Urbans in 2021 and has loaned more than $5 million through her LLCs to them over the years,\nTRD previously reported\n.\nHolmes and his longtime business partner, Mary Desloover, are suing Pollock along with the Urbans on an accusation that Pollock helped cover up the Urbans\u2019 mounting debt in exchange for higher interest payments. Pollock has denied the claims in court, arguing she had no duty to disclose her loans and that she is also a victim of Urban\u2019s deception.\nPollock is now seeking to seize properties in Chicago, Hazel Crest and Calumet Park where she provided the Urbans mortgage loans. The combined principal for the three mortgages was $475,000, and Pollock\u2019s lawsuit says the amount owed with interest and late fees is over $581,000.\nAccording to loan agreements included in the lawsuit, the loans had six-month terms with 15 percent interest rates.\nAt one of those properties, Urban had given a second mortgage to Homes by MB, an LLC that has purchased a number of the Urbans\u2019 distressed homes.\nPollock didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment and her attorney declined to comment.\nPollock has also received deeds to some of the Urbans\u2019 properties where she had initially loaned them money for mortgages, property records show.\n\nJeffrey Meincke-Reza\nTwo more foreclosure lawsuits were brought by lender Jeffrey Wayne Meincke-Reza, who loaned the Urbans\u2019 LLCs $179,000 for a property in Dolton and $152,000 for a Calumet Park property.\nAccording to those suits, the Urbans owe more than $410,000 in principal and interest fees at the properties. The loans were given with a 10 percent interest and a six-month maturity term, according to the lawsuit.\nMeincke-Reza\u2019s attorney did not respond to a request for comment.\nMaria Bryjak\nIn another lawsuit, lender Maria Bryjak is seeking $283,000 from Chris Urban for a loan that he stopped making payments on in early January. The loan \u2018s principal was $186,000 for a mortgage on a house on South Prairie Avenue in Chicago. She is suing only Chris Urban and one of his LLCs, not Aneta Urban.\nIt appears to be the only property where Bryjak loaned the Urbans money, according to property records. The eight-month loan had a 15 percent interest rate, court records show.\nThe South Prairie Avenue property the loan is tied to has a second mortgage on it from an LLC operated by investor Wendy Valencia, who is also suing the Urbans for foreclosure at multiple properties.\nBryjak could not be reached for comment, and her attorney did not respond to a request for comment.\nOnDeck loan\nBusiness loan company OnDeck has filed a second lawsuit against Chris Urban over a loan that he took out in 2024. The loan had a principal amount of $225,000, and Urban stopped making payments in October 2024, around the time his payments to other lenders stopped.\nLate fees and interest have pushed the debt up to $261,800, which OnDeck is seeking to recover from Urban.\nIn a previously filed lawsuit, OnDeck is looking to recover $87,000 for a separate $155,000 business loan Urban took out in March 2024.\n",

        "content": "Uptown landlord Harwood International is quietly offloading buildings in its namesake district after\na year marred by distress\n.\nDeed records show Gabriel Barbier-Mueller\u2019s Dallas-based firm has sold Harwood No. 2, Harwood No. 6, Harwood No. 7 and Harwood No. 10 to San Francisco-based hedge fund TPG. The sales were recorded in September, a few months after\nHarwood tapped Newmark\nto help it find equity partners and debt for the next phase of its 30-acre Harwood District.\nThe four properties total 892,000 square feet of Uptown office space.\nHarwood No. 2, at 2728 North Harwood Street, is a 10-story, 178,000-square-foot property that was completed in 1996. It\u2019s appraised at $58.3 million.\nHarwood No. 6 (also known as Saint Ann Court) is a 26-story, 320,000-square-foot office building that opened in 2009 at 2501 North Harwood Street. It\u2019s valued at $160 million.\nHarwood No. 7 (also known as Frost Tower), at 2950 North Harwood Street, is a 22-story office property with 167,000 square feet of space. It\u2019s appraised at $83.5 million.\nThe 22-story 227,000-square-foot Harwood No. 10, at 2850 North Harwood Street, was delivered in 2019. It\u2019s valued at $120 million.\nNeither Harwood nor TPG responded to a request for comment.\n\nTPG also appears to be financing Harwood\u2019s latest project, Harwood No. 15. It\nprovided a $100 million construction loan\nfor the 23-story, 340,000-square-foot office project planned for 3008 North Harwood Street. A state filing last November showed the project was expected to cost $120 million, with a projected completion date of June 2027.\nHarwood said Jones Day is committed to a\n73,000-square-foot lease\nat the new building. The law firm has leased space at Harwood No. 3 since 1999.\nHarwood nearly lost Harwood No.6\nto foreclosure in January but saved the building with a recapitalization deal.\nIn purchasing the property, TPG assumed the $105 million loan tied to the building from New York Life Insurance Company.\nIt was the first of three foreclosures Harwood has been hit with this year.\nHarwood handed back the keys to Harwood No. 4\nafter allegedly defaulting on an $80 million mortgage tied to the building. San Francisco-based Spear Street Capital took back that 221,000-square-foot property in a $73 million credit bid.\nHarwood is facing its\nthird office foreclosure\nthis year with Harwood No.1, at 2651 North Harwood Street, heading to the auction block next month, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service.\nHarwood borrowed $37.45 million from First United Bank for the 105,550-square-foot property in 2020. The debt works out to $355 per square foot. The auction is scheduled for Nov. 4 at 10 a.m. at the Dallas County Courthouse. It\u2019s possible that Harwood and First United could work out a loan extension to avoid the sale.\nAs its name suggests, Harwood No. 1 was the firm\u2019s first office development, built in 1984 for Rolex. In April, the building was 54.1 percent leased.\n",

        "content": "A former Brown Harris Stevens agent is suing the firm over its clawback policies.\nScott Harris, who earlier this year\nleft the brokerage\nto launch his own shop, filed a lawsuit against the company, alleging it failed to pay him roughly $300,000 in commissions for deals that closed after his departure.\nIn the complaint, filed in New York last month, Harris claims BHS sought to \u201cpunish\u201d him for leaving by demanding Harris pay them money for perks he received during his employment, pursuant to the firm\u2019s\nclawback\npolicies.\n\u201cI have nothing against them,\u201d Harris wrote in an emailed statement. \u201cI had a great relationship with the firm up until the point at which I left.\u201d\nBut following his exit, which Harris described as an \u201cintentional decision to grow and expand\u201d by having his own business, his relationship with the firm began to break down.\n\u201cI\u2019ve experienced theft and retaliation,\u201d he wrote in the statement. \u201cI don\u2019t like being bullied and robbed.\u201d\nA spokesperson for BHS declined to comment on the pending litigation.\nAfter nearly two decades with BHS, Harris exited in January, bringing along his eight-person team to start a new operation called Magnetic backed by the white-label firm, Side.\nUnder Harris\u2019 independent contractor agreement with BHS, he was owed 40 percent of commissions earned from pending deals closed after his departure, according to the complaint. Harris, through his attorney, Adam Leitman Bailey, claimed he had 12 sales under contract when he left, which should have yielded more than $700,000 in gross commissions, $293,000 of which should have been paid to him.\n\nHowever, shortly after he submitted the paperwork to collect, Harris alleges BHS sent him a \u201cclawback letter\u201d claiming he owed the firm more than $430,000 for \u201ccommission splits and expense funds paid in excess of BHS\u2019s standard policies during the three years before Harris left.\u201d\nThe letter stated that the firm would not pay Harris the outstanding commissions considering the amount of money he owed the firm, which he alleges is \u201cvastly inflated.\u201d Included in their calculation was a $38,000 bonus paid to Harris for his performance in 2024.\nHowever, the complaint argues that Harris was actually owed a $75,000 bonus, the full amount of which BHS never paid him, and that it failed to deliver on several of its other promises, including giving him and his team a private office in the firm\u2019s Upper West Side location.\nThe complaint alleges BHS \u201ctook several other actions calculated to sabotage Harris,\u201d including \u201cmaliciously\u201d downplaying his sales volume to RealTrends by reporting he\u2019d only closed $104 million worth of deals in 2024 instead of $138 million.\nHarris also claims the firm didn\u2019t shut down or set up an autoreply to his former BHS account, which he argues is still receiving emails from \u201cclients, colleagues, and other important contacts\u201d and causing him to \u201cmiss potential sales and damage [his] reputation.\u201d\nThe lawsuit seeks at least $8 million in damages as well as a declaratory judgment clearing him from any outstanding balance with BHS.\nHarris\u2019 complaint comes after another former BHS agent, Chris Poore,\nsued the brokerage\nfor failing to pay him commissions on a $4.9 million deal after he left the firm. Like Harris, Poore claimed the brokerage sent him a demand to pay back hundreds of thousands of dollars under its clawback policies.\nA judge sided with Poore and awarded him summary judgment on two of the claims, though the litigation is still pending.\n",

The seller is the Ganger family\u2019s Ganger Miradero Community Property Trust. Pascal and Antonio Liguori with Premier Estate Properties had the listing, and Candace Friis with the Corcoran Group brought the buyer.\nThe sale was\nreported in September\n, but the buyer was not previously known.\n\nTurner is the head of Nashville-based Market Street Enterprises, the development firm founded by his late father, James Stephen \u201cSteve\u201d Turner, who is largely credited with the revival of the Nashville neighborhood, the Gulch, now known as a retail and restaurant hub. The Turners are members of the billionaire family that founded discount retailer Dollar General. They are also alumni and longtime supporters of\nVanderbilt University\n, which is seeking to open a graduate school campus in nearby West Palm Beach.\nThe 0.9-acre Miradero was designed by famed Palm Beach architect Maurice Fatio for Lila Vanderbilt Webb, granddaughter of Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, in 1928. It was last sold to the Ganger family for an undisclosed amount in 1970, according to published reports. The three-building compound totals nine bedrooms, 10 bathrooms and a pool and spans 121 feet of beachfront, records show.\nThe estate hit the market asking $25 million in September, Zillow shows.\nTurner\u2019s purchase isn\u2019t the only pricey Gulf Stream deal in recent months. In September, attorney Henry Rosen bought a\n$22 million\noceanfront home. Last year, Debra Levitetz, the ex-wife of Purity Wholesale Grocers founder Jeffrey Levitetz, sold her oceanfront teardown for\n$39 million\n, making it the most expensive home ever sold in Gulf Stream.",

        "content": "A long-promised affordable housing project in San Francisco\u2019s Tenderloin has been kicked down the road again.\nRather than building new homes at the site, the Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing and Community Development is opting to grant a five-year lease extension for La Cocina\u2019s incubator kitchen at 101 Hyde Street in the\nTenderloin\n, Mission Local\nreported\n. In keeping La Cocina at 101 Hyde, the city will purportedly save hundreds of thousands of dollars in vacancy fees amid a difficult funding climate.\nThe 96-year-old building was once a post office that was meant to be transformed into affordable housing.\nShorenstein\nbought the property, at 101 Hyde Street, in 2016 for $12.5 million in an agreement with the city to build affordable residences and donate the building back to the local government. The proposal called for 85 income-restricted units.\n\u201cThere was a small minority in the neighborhood who thought we could do better on the amount of affordable housing,\u201d Meg Spriggs of Shoreinstein\u2019s multifamily division\ntold\nthe San Francisco Business Times in 2016. \u201c101 Hyde Street had been on the market. [Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation] had their eyes on it, but really wasn\u2019t able to be competitive. They suggested we buy that property and dedicate it to the city.\u201d The building is owned by the City and County of San Francisco, per property records.\nIn 2021, La Cocina, a nonprofit geared toward serving women, immigrants and people of color aspiring to be food and restaurant entrepreneurs, turned the building into a public food hall in a $6 million revamp. The organization served $5 meals with the hope of reviving a blighted block plagued with drug activity. But with downtown workers slow to\nreturn to work post-pandemic\n, the nonprofit shuttered the food hall in 2023 and reverted to running a private commissary kitchen similar to its location in the\nMission District\n.\n\n\u201cThis is not a matter of prioritization, it\u2019s about feasibility,\u201d Anne Stanley, a spokesperson for the housing office, said in a statement, per Mission Local. \u201cGiven limited resources and the competitive nature of affordable housing finance, we must be strategic and responsible stewards of public funds.\u201d\nCritics in the Tenderloin see it differently, as the neighborhood has been promised affordable housing at the site for a decade.\n\u201cThey got the money for having that building based on that premise that they were going to be providing that ongoing benefit for the community,\u201d Kasey Rios Asberry, a community advocate who once helped create La Cocina\u2019s now-closed public street space, told Mission Local. \u201cMost of the time, the metal doors are down. It\u2019s again a blighted space on the sidewalk instead of a free flowing contributor to public health.\u201d\nUltimately, the lack of\nvisitor traffic\nproved too high of a hurdle for La Cocina to overcome.\n\u201cWe were trying to create economic opportunities for working-class immigrant and women-of-color small businesses while providing a welcoming space for the Tenderloin,\u201d La Cocina spokesperson Aniela Valtierra told Mission Local. \u201cPlaces like the Marketplace can\u2019t survive on admiration alone. They require consistent patronage and support.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

A domestic buyer put down all cash for the purchase, which will likely close \u201cin line\u201d with the other full-floor spread sold this year, according to a source close to the deal.\nThat unit, on the 116th floor, had a last asking price of $52.9 million\nand closed\nfor $45.9 million in April, a roughly 13 percent discount.\nSpanning over 7,000 square feet, Unit 121 features five bedrooms and five full bathrooms, sitting over 1,270 square feet in the air. A grand salon with triple exposures takes up most of the home\u2019s east wing, while the primary suite encompasses the western wing with a formal sitting room and oversized bathroom with dual features.\nThe tower\u2019s amenities include private swimming pools, a theater and a fine dining restaurant on the 100th floor.\nAn in-house team at Gary Barnett\u2019s Extell Development led by Gabriele Tonini is heading sales alongside a team from Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group helmed by Kane Manera, Tim Rizzo and Janet Wang.\nCompass\u2019 Maurice Mizrahi brought the buyer. The sales team and Mizrahi declined to comment.\n\nThe building, which was starting to become known for its steep discounts as much as its towering 1,550-foot-high frame, has strung together several deals closer to ask, after dropping prices earlier this year.\nA three-bedroom unit on the 62nd floor sold for $17.6 million in August, just 7 percent less than its last asking price from June \u2014 but over 20 percent below its original $22.6 million asking price from 2022.\nThe discounts from the original offering plan have pushed the building further and further away from its once-projected $4 billion sellout. The unit on the 121st floor was originally priced at $64 million in the building\u2019s first offering plan, marking a 14 percent fall in its asking price.\nThe 178-unit building is now more than two-thirds sold, according to Marketproof.\nThe Central Park Tower deal marks the second condo asking over $40 million this month at a long-selling tower. Unit 65 at 53 West 53rd Street,\nasking just under $47 million\n, inked a deal at the start of October.\n",

        "content": "A once-prolific real estate partnership that reenvisioned retail corners from Crystal Lake to downtown Chicago has collapsed into bitter litigation, with investor Shai Wolkowicki accusing his longtime former business partner\nMitch Goltz\nof siphoning funds and pledging company assets without proper consent.\nThe allegations mark an extraordinary public split for the duo once rising to become among Chicago\u2019s busiest retail developers.\nIn a lawsuit filed Monday in Cook County court, Wolkowicki and his firm Ruby Development Group claim Goltz \u201cengaged in wrongful conduct\u201d to divert more than $2 million in sale proceeds from the Evanston retail property known as Church Street Plaza. An affiliate of GW Properties, Wolkowicki\u2019s and Goltz\u2019s former firm, just sold it to Chicago-based\nContinuum Capital for $31.2 million\n.\nBut the timing of Wolkowicki\u2019s complaint prompts scrutiny, as he\u2019s currently\nfacing a barrage of financial trouble\ntied to distressed multifamily deals on Chicago\u2019s South Side and throughout Illinois, from Rockford to Springfield.\nIt\u2019s at least the\nsecond legal battle Wolkowicki has waged\nin recent weeks against current or former real estate partners. He\u2019s also casting blame on\nChikoo Patel\n, the head of a company that dissolved earlier this year called CKO Real Estate that was in charge of property management for dozens of South Side apartment buildings that he, Wolkowicki and Wolkowicki\u2019s wife Lauren Lampert owned.\nMeanwhile, Goltz, through his new company GTZ Properties, has continued buying real estate since splitting with Wolkowicki and their GW firm. In its most high-profile transaction, GW purchased an\noffice complex in the western Chicago suburb of Oak Brook\nout of distress this summer.\nGoltz declined to comment on this week\u2019s lawsuit other than to say he plans to formally deny the allegations.\nThis week\u2019s lawsuit further alleges Goltz personally enriched himself through unauthorized loans and distributions. The suit names Goltz, his living trust and several entities tied to their joint venture umbrella, GW Properties, as defendants.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the two men spent more than a decade developing dozens of urban infill projects under the GW Properties banner, a partnership that paired Wolkowicki\u2019s capital-raising prowess with Goltz\u2019s construction management. But the relationship unraveled in 2024 and 2025 amid what Wolkowicki describes as chronic cost overruns and mismanagement that left multiple projects undercapitalized \u2014 all of which he blamed on Goltz.\nThe flashpoint came with the Evanston sale this September. Wolkowicki\u2019s entity Ruby says it funded the entire $5 million equity stake for the venture and was owed virtually all net proceeds from the sale. Instead, the filing alleges, Goltz blocked the release of the money from escrow unless Wolkowicki agreed to a $1.6 million \u201cdevelopment fee\u201d for a Goltz-controlled affiliate \u2014 a fee the plaintiffs call \u201cmanufactured\u201d and unsupported by any contract.\nThe complaint further alleges that Goltz had already taken a $450,000 \u201cpartial payment\u201d toward that fee before closing, without his partner\u2019s consent, and later refused to release even the undisputed balance. \u201cGoltz has held the escrowed amounts hostage,\u201d the suit claims, \u201cin a transparent effort to leverage Wolkowicki into agreeing to the development fee.\u201d\nWolkowicki also accuses Goltz of treating a separate joint venture, 4550 W. Patterson LLC, \u201cas if it were his own.\u201d The suit says Goltz or an entity he controls pledged the company\u2019s membership interests as collateral for a loan that did not benefit the partnership and made more than $100,000 in unauthorized distributions to himself. Ruby Development, which owns a 20 percent stake in the Patterson project, discovered the loan only after finding a recorded lien against the property, according to the suit.\nThe complaint seeks declaratory relief and damages for breach of contract, tortious interference and breach of fiduciary duty, along with punitive damages and attorneys\u2019 fees from Goltz and his entities. Wolkowicki\u2019s suit names defendants that also appear to be partially under his own control and ownership, making it unclear how the case moves forward given that it appears the investor is suing his own interests.\nThe new suit paints Goltz as unable or unwilling to inject new capital, \u201crolling one deal into the next\u201d while Wolkowicki repeatedly bailed out projects. It also highlights how the partners\u2019 unwinding has turned personal: Wolkowicki, now based in Palm Beach County, Florida, accuses Goltz of using the fabricated development fee to \u201cavoid having to personally contribute funds\u201d to wind down their portfolio.\nThe case is pending before Judge Joel Chupack in Cook County court, with a hearing set for Dec. 22.\n",

        "content": "Namdar Realty Group\nis set to add another distressed Chicago asset to its swelling portfolio.\nThe New York-based firm agreed to pay $8.3 million for the 170,000-square-foot retail space at One North State Street, according to people familiar with the pending sale, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. That breaks down to almost $49 per square foot. The auction deal, expected to close next month, marks a steep drop from the property\u2019s mid-2000s value \u2014 and a sign of how far State Street\u2019s fortunes have fallen.\nThe property, located at the corner of State and Madison streets, last traded for $54.5 million in 2004, when a venture led by New York investor Isaac Shalom bought the four-level space. That equates to $320 per square foot.\nLNR Partners\ntook control last fall after filing a\n$50 million foreclosure suit\nagainst the ownership group over missed loan payments, Cook County records show.\nDespite the corridor\u2019s broader challenges, One North State remains 93 percent leased. T.J. Maxx rents the property with 45,000 square feet through early 2027, while Burlington occupies about 53,000 square feet through 2029. Smaller tenants \u2014 including Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Tropical Smoothie Cafe and Raygun \u2014 have recently signed leases, offering some stability amid downtown\u2019s retail turbulence.\nTranswestern\u2019s Paul Barile, who marketed the property, declined to name the buyer but noted increased interest from New York investors in financially troubled Chicago real estate.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a rush of New York buyers coming into Chicago because they think there\u2019s a lot of upside,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cIn time, it should be a moneymaker.\u201d\nThat timeline remains uncertain. More than five years after the onset of the pandemic, retail vacancy still hovers around 26 percent downtown, according to Stone Real Estate. Persistent foot traffic issues, retailer exits and higher interest rates have all contributed to plunging property values along what was once Chicago\u2019s signature shopping corridor.\nNamdar, based in Great Neck, New York, has built a national reputation buying struggling malls and retail centers at bargain prices. In Chicago, the firm has been\nespecially active\n, scooping up distressed office towers at 1 North LaSalle Street and 70 West Madison Street, as well as retail space at the base of the Warwick Allerton Hotel on the Magnificent Mile of North Michigan Avenue.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Dallas\u2019 skyline is set for a\nmajor makeover\nthanks to millions in\ncity tax incentives\n.\nDallas City Council unanimously approved a\n$103 million incentive package\nWednesday to back developers\nMike Hoque\nand Mike Ablon\u2019s ambitious plan to redevelop the 72-story Bank of America Plaza, the city\u2019s tallest tower and one of its most recognizable landmarks, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nThe duo plans to convert portions of the nearly 2 million-square-foot building at 901 Main Street into a hotel with event and retail space, plus a parking garage.\nThe payment will come from the Downtown Connection Tax Increment Financing District, whose boundaries were expanded as part of the same vote. The deal clears the way for Hoque and Ablon\u2019s firm, 901 Main PAHG Partners, to buy the property from Metropolis Investment Holdings, a Chicago-based firm managing assets for a German family investment group.\nThe redevelopment plan calls for a full reimagining of the 1.8 million-square-foot tower. Office space will be trimmed to 1.5 million square feet and fully renovated, while a 275-key hotel and related amenities will be added in partnership with hospitality veteran Dave Johnson of Horizon Capital.\nA glass-and-steel addition across Main Street will house a hotel lobby, ballroom and a 1,115-space parking garage, linked to the main tower by a skybridge. Plans also call for street-level retail, restaurants, as well as a 69th-floor restaurant with an outdoor observation deck.\n\nThe first phase of the $409 million redevelopment blueprint that includes four additional city blocks is expected to wrap in three years. As part of council\u2019s stipulations for the TIF funding, the developers must close on the property and four adjacent blocks by September 2026 and finish construction by 2032, investing at least $395 million and meeting benchmarks for office, hotel and retail space.\n\u201c\nDowntown Dallas\nis at a critical juncture where much of its development has to be rethought and reimagined,\u201d Hoque told the outlet. \u201cToday\u2019s approval paves the way for a transformational change that connects Main Street District with the West End and the new Convention Center.\u201d\nAblon, founder of PegasusAblon, said the project could be \u201ccatalytic for the next generation of Downtown Dallas,\u201d adding that it aligns with the city\u2019s Downtown 360 Plan. Downtown Dallas CEO Jennifer Scripps also endorsed the project, calling it key to maintaining the area\u2019s economic vitality amid shifting office demand.\nCouncil member Paul Ridley hailed the project as a model for adaptive reuse in the city center, while creating hundreds of construction and hospitality jobs.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Rebuilding efforts in Malibu nine months after the deadly Palisades fire have barely gotten underway.\nWhile owners in the Pacific Palisades next door and\nAltadena\nacross town have gotten hundreds of rebuild permits, the City of Malibu has granted just a handful, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n. As a result, burned-out lots across the seaside enclave remain fenced off and overgrown.\nThe City of Los Angeles handles most permits in the Palisades, issuing 833 so far, or about 42 percent of all applications received, according to the state\u2019s\nrebuilding dashboard\n. Los Angeles County, which handles most permits in Altadena, has issued 601, or about 26 percent of the total applications received.\nBy contrast, the City of Malibu has\nissued a paltry five permits\n, making up approximately 3 percent of the total applications received.\n\u201cIt\u2019s depressing,\u201d Abe Roy, a Malibu resident and professional builder, told the Times. \u201cIf this current pace continues,\nrebuilding\nwill take way longer than a decade.\u201d Roy was appointed as the city\u2019s first Rebuild Ambassador in May but publicly resigned last month.\n\u201cOur work is far from done,\u201d Roy told the Malibu City Council as he resigned,\naccording\nto the Times. \u201cTwo permits issued in nearly 10 months is an abomination by any standard.\u201d\nWhile many Malibu residents want to stay, others are listing their homes for sale and looking to start a new life elsewhere. About 75 lots in Malibu have sold since the fire, but sales are slowing, opening up a buyer\u2019s market. Of the 160 lots in Malibu listed this year that are still on the market, 47 have gotten a price cut.\n\u201cSupply is exceeding demand, and lots are selling anywhere from a 20 to 60 percent discount,\u201d Roy said. \u201cThat\u2019s a premonition for a freefall.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemodeling a kitchen or bathroom is onerous for most people. But building a house from the ground up is almost impossible,\u201d he added. \u201cAfter a while, you raise your hand and say, \u2018I don\u2019t know how long I can be on this treadmill.\u2019\u201d\nThe city has purportedly been sending applications back to residents to remedy necessary corrections, further delaying rebuilding efforts for owners. As a result, many are giving up entirely and opting to sell.\nMalibu\u2019s unique mountainous geography and rocky geology present even more issues in rebuilding endeavors. Of the roughly 720 homes in Malibu burned by the\nPalisades fire\n, 50 percent of them were on the water and 30 percent were on steep slopes, according to Yolanda Bundy, community development director at the Malibu Rebuild Center, the one-stop shop set up by the City of Malibu in the wake of the fires to help both homeowners and contractors through the rebuilding process.\n\u201cThese homes require septic systems, sea walls, retaining walls and complex foundations. Those come with restrictions,\u201d Bundy said.\nOne of the biggest factors in applications slowing to a crawl is architectural plans missing necessary notes and numbers. While only a handful of building permits have been issued, about half of the nearly 170 applications have already passed through the planning phase but are still waiting to advance through the building and safety review process, Bundy told the Times.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an oversimplification to say that we\u2019re not making any progress compared to L.A.,\u201d Bundy said. \u201cFamilies are frustrated, but I want every family to know we\u2019re doing our best to get them home.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

English credited the firms with significantly boosting the property\u2019s value through early-phase work, including upgrades to power capacity \u2014 a desirable commodity nationwide.\n\u201cThey played a critical role in assuring that the building has enough power,\u201d English told the outlet. \u201cThere\u2019s a shortage of power throughout the country right now. It\u2019s a great partnership where they created value, and now we\u2019re creating the next stage.\u201d\n\nLegacy, which specializes in data storage, logistics and life sciences real estate across the country, is betting that central locations like the Loop will play an increasing role in the next wave of data infrastructure. English said while most people think of data centers propping up only in \u201cfarm fields out in the middle of nowhere,\u201d the proximity of power and connectivity in urban locations also provides applicable value.\nThe deal stands out in a market still struggling with record-high office vacancies and rising financing costs. While most downtown buildings are currently trading at steep discounts, Prime and Capri\u2019s sale marks a rare profit-making turnaround, albeit with a new use in mind in an escape from workspace. The firms are also leading the $280 million overhaul of the Helmut Jahn-designed Thompson Center nearby, where Google plans to open a major new office.\nDemand for data centers has exploded with the rise of artificial intelligence and cloud computing.

        "content": "Main Square\u2019s\nTerra Nova\ncommunity is moving forward after revisions prompted by\ncommunity concerns\n.\nThe Terrell City Council approved the first reading of an annexation request this week covering 712 acres for a 1,550-acre mixed-use development proposed by the Plano-based developer, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The project faces a final council vote Nov. 4.\nMain Square President Hugo Morales called the annexation vote \u201can important milestone in the life of this project.\u201d The firm\u2019s plans call for roughly 3,600 single-family homes, 1,200 multifamily units, 145 acres of parks, and a 50-acre mixed-use center called Terra Nova Village along Griffith Road near FM 245. The community is expected to unfold over 14 to 16 phases.\nCouncil also approved the creation of a tax increment reinvestment zone encompassing the entire 2,061-acre Terra Nova footprint. It\u2019s designed to fund infrastructure improvements such as roads and utilities using future tax revenue. The TIRZ, like the annexation, will return for a final reading early next month.\nSome Terrell residents weren\u2019t originally on board with the scale of Terra Nova, bringing up concerns about congestion, rising home prices and strain on schools. The city of about 23,000 people could see its population surge by potentially tens of thousands under the plan. Morales said his team has modified the project in response to feedback.\n\n\u201cMultiple edits have been made to the development agreement to address the concerns brought up by the citizenry and reaffirm their voices have been heard,\u201d Morales said.\nMain Square\u2019s strategy mirrors the suburban\nmegaproject model\nreshaping much of North Texas. Developers are targeting cities\nbeyond Dallas County\nfor large-scale, mixed-use communities that blend single-family, multifamily and retail components with parks and open space.\nTerra Nova would be one of the largest in Kaufman County, part of Main Square\u2019s broader push to expand its footprint. Though this is Main Square\u2019s first project, the firm also controls about 1,100 acres in Cedar Hill and is eyeing projects in Sherman and Royse City.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Developers are trying to figure out the math for a site on Atlantic Avenue.\nBermuda Realty LLC, an entity tied to the Bawabeh family, plans to build 300 housing units at 1720 Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn.\nThe site, which currently operates as a one-story shopping center, sits outside the\nAtlantic Avenue rezoning\narea, a 21-block plan that is expected to create 4,600 homes. The City Council approved the rezoning in May.\nLocal Council member Chi Oss\u00e9 supported that rezoning, but said he has concerns about the 300-unit project to the east.\n\u201cI have been and will always remain a pro-housing Council member, however, I want to emphasize the urgent need for more deeply affordable housing, both in my district and across the city,\u201d he said during a hearing on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that this particular proposal will contribute to displacement pressures in this part of Central Brooklyn.\u201d\nAs the plan stands, 84 apartments will be permanently affordable to those earning, on average, 60 percent of the area median income.\nThe City of Yes for Housing Opportunity\nallowed the developers to slightly increase the size of their project and add 14 more affordable units than previously planned.\nThe back-and-forth between the developer and Council member on Thursday provided some insight into the challenges of satisfying competing visions for a project. It also showed that while several City Council members have signed on to the belief that ramping up housing construction is the key to addressing the city\u2019s housing crisis, demands for 100 percent affordability haven\u2019t gone away.\nRepresentatives for the developer indicated that they will look at eliminating a community facility, reducing parking spots and adjusting unit sizes as a way to increase affordability. Brian Cook, an attorney with Brown Weinraub, noted that while parking is required, community members want the project to add parking spots beyond the 50 spots that are already available at the shopping center.\nOss\u00e9 asked if the developers could provide projections of how eliminating or reducing the planned 116 parking spots could increase the number of income-restricted units and deepen the affordability levels. He said increasing the project\u2019s affordability was a priority, and that its proximity to mass transit should enable shoppers to travel to and from the project, even with grocery bags in tow.\nThen he asked a question often dreaded by developers: Had they, instead, considered building a 100 percent affordable housing project with the Department of Housing Preservation and Development?\nCook indicated that the Bawabehs have specialized in retail properties in Brooklyn, and that turning the project into 100 percent affordable would likely require bringing on more staff or another partner with expertise in managing such properties. He also noted that the project has more than 99 units, meaning that the developers will pay construction workers a minimum hourly rate for wages and benefits as a condition of receiving the property tax break 485x.\nAdditionally, he said it would be cost-prohibitive to continue pouring money into the site while waiting, likely years, for potential city subsidies.\nOss\u00e9 was not convinced by these arguments.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a plausible excuse, that it takes work and time to work with HPD and nonprofit developers on establishing a 100 percent affordable site,\u201d he said.\nStill, Cook indicated that the developers were looking to see if other sites nearby may be suitable for a 100 percent affordable project.\nAnd that\u2019s pretty much where the conversation was left. The most likely scenario seems to be an increase in the affordable units, if the developer decreases parking and makes some of the other changes the team floated Thursday, but we\u2019ll see where the project lands.\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: What lessons should other condo developers learn from 432 Park Avenue, given the\ncontroversy\nover its design? Are there other buildings we should be looking at? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Kelsey Grammer was only 38 when he appeared as the titular character in season one of the television show \u201cFrasier,\u201d which debuted in 1993.\nLearning this\ncompletely ruined my day.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nDuring the final mayoral debate, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo was the only candidate who said he would accept an endorsement from Mayor Eric Adams. A day later, the mayor confirmed that he is endorsing Cuomo and plans to campaign with him in neighborhoods where he is popular,\nthe New York Times reports\n.\n\u2014\nA construction worker fell to his death on Thursday while working on a Manhattan site related to the Gateway tunnel project,\nGothamist reports\n. Officials say the worker, who has not been named, fell 60 feet from a foundation wall that was poured Wednesday, and had to be hoisted up from a massive pit on the site. His death is under investigation.\n\u2014\nICYMI, here\u2019s a\nrecap\nof the real estate-related issues that came up during the final mayoral debate.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$9.75 million\nfor a 2,101-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium at 20 East 76th Street on the Upper East Side. Lauren Muss and Michelle Griffith with Douglas Elliman\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$62.6 million\nfor an assemblage of buildings at 150-154 East 79th Street and 1131-1135 Lexington Avenue on the Upper East Side. Combined, the five properties have 18,500 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$35.6 million\nfor a 10,160-square-foot, single-family townhouse at 436 West 20th Street in Chelsea. Ryan Serhant, Nicole Palermo and Chris Gillis with Serhant have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 277,206-square-foot, 26-story residential building with 347 units at 310 East 161st Street in Concourse. Ariel Aufgang filed the permit on behalf of Dimitrios Katehis of Gilbane Development.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

The show soared to No. 1 in the ratings by its third season, beating out the likes of \u201cFrasier\u201d and \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d\nRichardson herself was nominated four times for an Emmy throughout the show\u2019s eight-season run and eventually was given an executive producer credit later in the series. She told the\nLos Angeles Times\nin an interview last year her input into shaping episodes occurred from the start, but initially only resulted in an executive consultant credit in season one.\nThe show ended after Richardson was denied pay equal to what Allen was offered \u2014 $2 million per episode and an executive producer credit \u2014 to return for a ninth season, according to the Times report.\nWith Richardson\u2019s children grown, she made the decision to downsize and move into a condominium in the L.A. area, Yadegaran said of the decision to sell.\nSet on a roughly 1-acre lot, the 6,700-square-foot East Coast traditional is behind 20-foot privacy hedges, which made it the perfect venue for the two family weddings and several SAG-AFTRA events hosted on the property.\nThe double-gated home looks small from the front but expands going farther into the lot. It opens up to what Yadegaran described as park-like grounds with mature Redwood trees, a pool, spa, gazebo and three private trails.\n\nBrentwood rising\nBrentwood\u2019s been on a tear this year, partly driven by those displaced from January\u2019s Palisades fire and the need for temporary housing.\nIn the first three quarters of this year,\nBrentwood\nhas seen 206 single-family sales, according to Yadegaran. That compares with 150 sales for the same three-month period last year, which amounts to a 37 percent activity ramp.\nFive closings of estates of 1 acre or more have occurred in what Yadegaran described as prime Brentwood and all include Carolwood. The largest of those deals is Milwaukee Brewers minority owner Robert Beyer\u2019s sale of the estate named\n\u201cOcho Manos\u201d\nfor $44 million in September. The home is located at 11740 Crescenda Street. Carolwood\u2019s Drew Fenton and Andrew Beyer were the listing agents, while Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Jack Harris and Michael Fahimian represented the buyer.\nThe other driver in the residential uptick is a commercial story, with more restaurants and retail coming into the area.\n\u201cBrentwood\u2019s becoming a destination city,\u201d Yadegaran said, pointing to a friend who recently made the comment that it used to be the case that residents would have to leave Brentwood to shop at Westfield Century City or go to Beverly Hills.\n\u201cNow, that\u2019s not the case,\u201d the agent said. \u201cNow you have everything right there on San Vicente [Boulevard].\u201d\nIn August, A.O.C. on San Vicente Boulevard closed its doors after 16 years, replaced by the celebrity-loved activewear brand Alo Yoga. In September, it was reported Texas coffee shop La La Land Kind Caf\u00e9 is set to take over the former Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf, in a deal that was brokered by Carolwood Estates. Other recent openings this year include Great White and Matu Kai.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing it across the board \u2014 retail, restaurants and wellness,\u201d said Yadegaran, who grew up on the border of Santa Monica and Brentwood. \u201cThey\u2019re coming to Brentwood. It\u2019s being completely revitalized.\u201d\n",

Members of the Laurenzo family, through affiliates, are selling the four-lot property at 16385-16445 West Dixie Highway, and 2255 Northeast 164th Street.\nThe site is entitled for a massive 2.1 million-square-foot project with three 33-story towers with 1,217 units, combined, more than 23,000 square feet of retail and 1,622 parking spaces, according to Colliers marketing materials.\nMika Mattingly and Cecilia Estevez of\nColliers\nare marketing the property.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think someone is building that exact iteration today,\u201d said Colliers\u2019 Bradley Arendt, who also is marketing the site, referring to current headwinds for developers. \u201cBut someone can buy it at a pretty decent price, and when things turn around,\u201d it can be developed.\n\u201cThe entitlements are there for three years and I think they can be extended beyond that,\u201d Arendt said.\nThe listing marks the latest chapter in a three-year saga surrounding the property.\nIn 2022, the Laurenzo family\u2019s entities entered into an agreement with Triple Five Florida, an entity led by Isaac Kasztl of Miami-based Kastel Development, to sell the site for $30.5 million, with a closing scheduled for the summer of 2022, according court records and the purchase contract attached to legal filings.\nLast year, the Laurenzo family\u2019s affiliates sued Triple Five Florida LLC and May NMB LLC over the failed deal to sell the property, alleging the buyers failed to close by the final extended date in December 2023, despite 18 extensions and seven addendums to the contract.\nMay NMB is an entity that eventually joined Triple Five Florida as a co-buyer and is tied to Jack Klugmann\u2019s Edison, New Jersey-based development firm Accurate, records show.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the buying entity Triple Five Florida is tied to the Ghermezian family\u2019s Alberta, Canada-based\nTriple Five Group\nthat\u2019s known as a megamall developer. Triple Five representatives didn\u2019t immediately confirm or deny any ties to the firm.\nAs the final closing date approached, the buyers had failed to pay a $100,000 fee required for their last extension option and tried to renegotiate the contract, including asking for seller financing at a 10 percent interest rate, the complaint says. In one of the addendums, the two sides agreed to lower the price to $28 million, according to court filings.\nIn their suit, the Laurenzos claim that they agreed with the would-be buyers not to market the site for sale during the extensions and negotiations, missing the \u201cred-hot real estate market.\u201d That\u2019s likely referring to the pandemic-era boom when development site prices\nskyrocketed\n.\nAttorneys for Triple Five Florida and May NMB declined to comment.\nTriple Five Florida and May NMB countersued the Laurenzo family in November, claiming they didn\u2019t meet the terms of the deal, including failing to provide a 40-year building recertification, vacate the property and provide executed closing documents such as a deed by the closing date. At one point, the Laurenzos indicated that they agreed to renegotiated contract terms, including the seller financing, but then claimed the would-be buyers were in default of the contract, according to the countersuit.\nThe two sides settled in April, giving the buyers one last chance to close the deal, and ordering the release to the Laurenzos of $1.1 million the would-be buyers had put in escrow. The deal still didn\u2019t close. In June, a judge upheld the clause in the settlement that if the deal didn\u2019t close, Triple Five Florida and May NMB are on the hook for a $2 million judgment in favor of the Laurenzos\u2019 entities.\nThe Laurenzos are working to collect on the $2 million, said their attorney, Kyle Teal. They also sued closing agent Landmark Abstract Agency, and its president, Jacob Rekant, alleging they failed to turn over the $1.1 million in escrow, even though the agency was told to do so by both the seller and buyers. In part of its response, Landmark Abstract said it was not the escrow agent for the purchase of the site.\nThe site owners \u201chave been going through a lot,\u201d said their attorney Teal, of Buchanan Ingersoll &amp; Rooney. \u201cIt\u2019s been a fight every step of the way,\u201d he added.\nUnder the settlement, the development approvals Triple Five Florida and May NMB obtained from the city of North Miami Beach were re-assigned to the Laurenzos. The North Miami Beach commission approved Triple Five Florida and May NMB\u2019s proposed megaproject last year.\n\u201cThe most valuable thing about the case is land use entitlements which we were able to negotiate\u201d for reassignment to the sellers,\u201d Teal said. \u201cI think that adds a lot of value to the property.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Forest Development, Kenco Communities and a partnership led by Frontier Development &amp; Hospitality Group will make presentations to Riviera Beach officials next month, as they compete to acquire 2.2 acres of vacant publicly owned land near the waterfront.\nRiviera Beach\u2019s Community Redevelopment Agency received five proposals in response to a request for offers to buy the property at 1851 Broadway, across the street from Jim Barry Light Harbor Park and Safe Harbor Rybovich Riviera Beach marina.\nHowever, Wednesday evening, council members, sitting as the CRA\u2019s board of directors, voted 3 to 1 to hear proposals only from development teams that received the three highest scores from a selection committee of city administrators. The presentations to the CRA\u2019s board will be held on Nov. 12.\nLed by managing partner Peter Baytarian, North Palm Beach-based Forest Development received the highest score. The firm started the bidding process after it made an unsolicited bid to acquire the land for about $3 million in July 2024 to build a $325 million mixed-use project with more than 450 apartments and 17,000 square feet of retail. Forest Development later increased its offer to $3.78 million and promised to reserve 5 percent of the units for workforce housing.\nWashington, D.C.-based Frontier Development &amp; Hospitality Group, founded by managing principal Evens Charles, and Deerfield Beach-based Gedeon Financial, headed by managing partner Evans Gedeon, received the second highest score. The team offered to pay $4 million for the land to build an $89 million project with 300 apartments, 12,500 square feet of ground-floor retail, rental storage units and amenities that would include a pool lounge, gym and clubhouse. A minimum of 75 percent of the units would be reserved as workforce housing \u201cwith the intended renter profile to include teachers, police officers and entry level professionals that desperately need workforce housing,\u201d the proposal added.\nWest Palm Beach-based Kenco Communities, led by founder and chairman Kenneth Endelson, received the third highest score, offering about $4.56 million for the property to build a 191,908-square foot project up to eight stories tall and a four-level parking garage with 285 spaces. Floorplan sketches in Kenco\u2019s proposal depict seven townhouses, amenities and commercial space for a caf\u00e9, fitness space or public co-working on the first floor, plus at least 20 units for each of the six floors above it.\n\nEdged out of the top three were proposals from New York-based Coltown Properties and Palm Beach Gardens-based Elysium Land Development.\nColtown, led by principals Steven Neuman and Israel and Jonathan Weinberger, offered $4 million for a project that would have at least 400 apartments, retail, parking and amenities. Elysium, headed by Elliott Johnson, proposed 106 affordable housing units with 44,160 square feet of commercial space consisting of administrative offices, an urgent care facility, community services and retail. Rather than buy the land, Elysium stated it wanted to build the \u201ccommunity incubator\u201d in partnership with the city and \u201ca coalition of local stakeholder agencies and developers.\u201d\nAlthough Kenco, Frontier/Gedeon, and Coltown offered more money for the land, Forest Development scored higher overall based on criteria that included conceptual design, community benefits, developer qualifications, financial capacity and the project\u2019s alignment with the CRA\u2019s master plan, according to CRA documents.\nRiviera Beach has attracted increased interest from developers such as Forest Development, which intends to build Oculina,\na twin 25-story condo project\nat 3700 Broadway, just 1,600 feet away from the site where Forest and Royal Palm Companies are building a pair of 24-story towers called\nNautilus 220\nin neighboring Lake Park.\nKenco Communities has built several residential communities in Palm Beach County, including Orchid Isles and Coral Isles at\nAvenir in Palm Beach Gardens\n, the 72-acre Water Tower Commons\nmixed-use project in Lantana\nand The Estates at\nArden\nnear Wellington.\nFrontier Development &amp; Hospitality\u2019s projects include the $560 million Hill East in Washington, D.C., and a $500 million project in Philadelphia that includes the 210-room Autograph Hotel and the African American Museum. Frontier Development was also a joint venture partner in the 2022 purchase of a 254-room Marriott Suites hotel in Downers Grove in\nsuburban Chicago for $14.5 million\n.",

When considering the 117,000-square-foot facility, the deal breaks down to $741 per square foot.\nThe facility spans two parcels in East Elmhurst, while the parking lot takes up nearly two acres. FedEx occupies the entire warehouse and still has more than 17 years remaining on its lease, according to JLL. FedEx uses the property to support last-mile distribution.\nBlackstone made the deal through its portfolio company, Revantage. The Morgan Stanley fund used a limited liability company to make the acquisition.\nA JLL team including Tyler Peck, Andrew Scandalios and John Huguenard arranged the deal. Blackstone and Morgan Stanley declined comment.\nBlackstone acquired the warehouse from Steel Equities in 2019\nfor $55.5 million\n, roughly a decade after Steel acquired the building for $22.7 million. Nuveen provided nearly $39 million in acquisition financing to Blackstone.\n\nTwo years ago, however, the private equity giant\ndecided to list\na six-property industrial portfolio comprising assets in and around New York City. The portfolio totaled 929,000 square feet and was fully leased with one tenant occupying each property. The weighted average remaining lease term was 6.13 years.\nThat listing came after Blackstone\u2019s $3.1 billion industrial\nsale\nto Prologis. That portfolio deal consisted of 70 properties, mostly warehouses and distribution centers in markets across the country, spanning almost 14 million square feet.\nAs of the end of the third quarter, new industrial leases in the city\u2019s outer boroughs this year totaled 2.6 million square feet, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield, a 6.4 percent jump year over year.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Where the firm once sought a 27-story hotel, it\u2019s now pursuing a 71-story mixed-use project.\nThe development would be 1,050-feet tall and span 484,000 square feet, according to an application with the Department of City Planning.\nA majority of that space would be residential, calling for 130 units, but there would also be 159,000 square feet of hotel space \u2014 156 rooms \u2014 and 24,000 square feet for retail. Plans also call for a 55-car garage on the second floor and a two-car elevator.\nAs a trade-off for the expansion, Extell would make improvements to the subway station at 50th Street and Broadway, particularly in terms of accessibility.\nBarnett\u2019s firm did not respond to the outlet\u2019s request for comment.\n\nExtell acquired the site of the Wellington Hotel in 2022, making a $94.5 million deal with Richard Born\u2019s BD Hotels; Born remains involved with the project. The hotel closed during the pandemic.\nA few months ago, Extell revealed a similar plan to greatly enlarge a project in Midtown. Extell\nfiled a rezoning application\nfor 655 Madison Avenue, eyeing a 74-story property, or double the number of stories Barnett\nplotted\nfor when he first filed plans for the site last fall.\nThe rezoning application detailed a 765,000-square-foot project that would stand 1,162 feet tall and feature 154 residential units. The residential space would span 476,000 square feet, while the 233,000 square feet of commercial space would be split between office and retail, the majority dedicated to the former.\nSimilar to the Seventh Avenue site, Barnett is bargaining with the city on the rezoning application, offering improvements to the Fifth Avenue/59th Street N/R/W subway station in exchange for 130,000 square feet of space.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The Villages is betting big on the municipal bond market to keep its housing boom alive.\nThe sprawling 57,000-acre retirement empire in central Florida is selling nearly $130 million in high-yield municipal bonds to fund a 2,800-home district, Bloomberg\nreported\n. The sale, handled by Jefferies and Morgan Stanley, will bankroll infrastructure for the next phase of The Villages\u2019 long-term buildout, such as roads, bridges, irrigation and 36 new golf holes.\nThe project is part of a 20-year plan that could swell the community\u2019s population by 60 percent to roughly 260,000 residents by 2045.\nThe deal comes with notable risk. The bonds are unrated and fall into two of the municipal market\u2019s most volatile sectors:\nsenior housing\nand real estate. Offering documents warn of potential pitfalls from\nhurricanes\nto liquidity shortages. Yet analysts say the project has strong fundamentals with permits secured and steady demand from the retiree pipeline.\nFounded in the 1980s by developer H. Gary Morse and still run by his family, The Villages has evolved from pasture and wetlands into a full-fledged city for the 55-and-up set. The master-planned community includes some 60\ngolf courses\n, 3,000 social clubs and its own media ecosystem. Rules ban everything from window air conditioning units to political yard signs, though dueling golf cart parades are an election season staple.\n\nForthcoming homes are expected to average about $400,000, according to bond documents; the community\u2019s broader inventory ranges from $200,000 villas to million-dollar estates. The\nbonds\nwill be backed by property assessments levied on the new lots, a structure familiar to muni investors who\u2019ve financed past phases of the development.\nThe Villages has tapped bond buyers before: A separate entity issued $260 million in taxable debt earlier this year, backed by amenity fees and recreation revenues. Those bonds, rated AA-, priced at a 5.2 percent yield.\nWhile the new issue lacks a rating, investors like Lord Abbett\u2019s Daniel Solender expect demand to hold.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The Fire will relocate its headquarters to the 14th floor of the landmark tower in the coming months \u2014 a move into a property owned by Fire\u2019s billionaire owner and Morningstar founder Joe Mansueto.\nThe new lease means the Fire is leaving behind more than 52,000 square feet at 1 North Dearborn Street when its lease expires early next year.\nThe relocation cuts the team\u2019s office footprint nearly in half, extending a post-pandemic trend of tenant rightsizing. The Fire didn\u2019t comment on the downsizing, but the outlet reported sources said the team didn\u2019t need all the space it leased on Dearborn, a full floor originally built out for floral delivery firm FTD before its 2019 bankruptcy.\nThe new address keeps the club close to home.\nMansueto\npurchased the Wrigley Building for $255 million in 2018. The lease helps push occupancy at the two-tower property, with the Fire\u2019s office set to span both with a link by enclosed walkway, to roughly 90 percent, according to CoStar. Perkins &amp; Will remains the building\u2019s largest tenant, with about 65,000 square feet.\n\nThe Fire\u2019s shift north comes as Mansueto and Related Midwest prepare to break ground on a $750 million, 22,000-seat stadium at\nThe 78\n, Related\u2019s 62-acre megadevelopment site along the Chicago River just south of Roosevelt Road. The Chicago City Council\nsigned off\non the plan last month, paving the way for the club to leave Soldier Field by the 2028 season.\nWhile the Wrigley lease shores up Mansueto\u2019s downtown real estate, it creates a new challenge for the owners of 1 North Dearborn. The 938,000-square-foot Loop tower, held by Beacon Capital Partners and MetLife, has weathered a wave of tenant churn better than most. Despite Salesforce vacating 38,000 square feet last year, the landlords quickly filled the gap with a long-term deal from early education nonprofit Start Early. The building remains 93 percent leased, bolstered by Chicago Public Schools\u2019 headquarters.\nThe Fire\u2019s new digs may be smaller, but the move anchors the team in a Mansueto-owned trophy.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Price cuts\nhave been common in\nAustin luxury homes\nthis year, but last week\u2019s top sale may have sold at a loss.\nThe four-bed, five-bath, 6,100-square-foot home at 6358 Spanish Oaks Club Boulevard was the most expensive home sold publicly in Austin last week, according to the Eklund Gomes Team. Susan Stiles, co-founder of Compass\u2019 Trigaci Stiles Group, had the listing.\nIt had an asking price of $4.4 million when it went under contract on Oct. 18. The seller, Loretta Lowe, bought it last July when it was listed for $4.5 million, according to county records and Zillow.\nThe property\u2019s price history suggests that Lowe sold it for a small loss, but since Texas does not require final sales price disclosure, that\u2019s not certain.\nThe home built in 2012 is in the Spanish Oaks neighborhood, a guard-gated community anchored by the highly ranked Spanish Oaks Golf Club. The neighborhood is about 30 minutes west of downtown Austin.\n\nWhile the Austin area has generally remained\nbelow six months of inventory this year\n, it\u2019s considered a\nbuyer\u2019s market\n. There were 124 percent more sellers than buyers in July; in September, the percentage grew to 130 percent, making Austin the most imbalanced market in the country, according to\nRedfin\n.\nLuxury\nhasn\u2019t gone unscathed. Most of Austin\u2019s top public sales in recent weeks have been offering\nprice cuts\n, and some have beckoned sellers with location rather than luxury, with agents marketing homes\u2019\nteardown potential\n.\nEven homes that would have sold off the market in previous years are\nmoving to the MLS\nas sellers trade the property tax benefit of price secrecy for the sales advantage of high exposure.\nOther Texas cities aren\u2019t faring much better. A seller-to-buyer difference lower than 10 percent is considered a balanced market. San Antonio and Dallas both have about 100 percent more sellers than buyers, or about two sellers for every buyer, according to Redfin. Houston has 84 percent more sellers than buyers, and Fort Worth has 68 percent.\n",

        "content": "Fosun International is close to locking in a $900 million refinancing for 28 Liberty, a Financial District tower once hobbled by high vacancy after losing\nMilbank to Hudson Yards\n.\nThe three-year loan, disclosed by credit rating firm KBRA, suggests lenders still see more near-term risk downtown than in Midtown, where refinancings are typically landing five- to ten-year terms.\nFosun, which bought the former Chase Manhattan Plaza for $725 million in 2013, will contribute $78 million in fresh equity to close the transaction, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The 2 million-square-foot property was recently appraised at $1.35 billion.\nFosun did not respond to the outlet\u2019s request for comment.\nThe deal marks a vote of cautious confidence in Lower Manhattan\u2019s long-suffering office market, which is showing signs of life after years of tenant flight.\n\nFosun, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate listed on the HKEX, has poured more than $550 million into upgrades, including a landscaped plaza anchored by a 43-foot David Rockefeller-commissioned sculpture. Average rents hover around $68 per square foot, which is relatively cheap for Class A space with direct access to six subway lines, four of them express.\nThe tenant roster has shifted since Milbank\u2019s exit. The New York attorney general\u2019s office anchors 20 percent of the building under a lease through 2038, joined by others such as Strip and the London Stock Exchange. With those moves, vacancy has fallen to 8 percent, down from roughly 15 percent four years ago.\nFosun reportedly was\ninterested in selling\nthe 60-story property for $1.6 billion in 2016, but the company refuted those suggestions.\nOverall vacancy in the Financial District has declined for six straight quarters, hitting 22.8 percent midyear, according to the Alliance for Downtown New York. The World Trade Center and nearby properties like 100 Pearl and 225 Liberty are nearly full, while conversions and growing residential density are breathing life into the streetscape.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The parcels in question include a vacant lot across from the University of Southern California and a hillside parcel on downtown\u2019s Bunker Hill.\nIn Exposition Park, the site at\n3685 South Vermont Avenue\nwas the former site of the Bethune Library. The City of Los Angeles had tapped Orion Capital to build a 168-room Courtyard by Marriott at the site.\nThe deal, supported by City Council president Marqueece Harris-Dawson unraveled after the project faced opposition from the city\u2019s own zoning administrator and South Los Angeles Area Planning Commission. That led the City Council to step in and force its construction, a move that prompted a lawsuit from Strategic Actions for a Just Economy,\u00a0 a nonprofit group that challenged the entitlements for the Bethune site. The proposal eventually ground to a halt.\n\nThe Bunker Hill Y-1 parcel, located at Fourth and Hill Streets, was once slated for Angels Landing, a\ntwo-tower project approved by the city in partnership with\nMacFarlane Partners\nand the Peebles Corporation.\nThat $1.6 billion plan called for two skyscrapers rising 64 and 42 stories with more than 400 units, two hotels and retail space.\nThe developers\nfaced off\nagainst former\nCity Councilmember Kevin de Le\u00f3n\n, who represented downtown, leaving the proposal dead in the water. The developers ultimately sued the City over the collapse of the deal.\nNow that the City\u2019s option agreements for both sites have expired, CRA/LA is required by state law to declare the properties as surplus land, meaning it will have to first offer both properties to affordable housing developers during a 60-day exclusive window. If no developers respond or reach an agreement, the agency can then market the parcels more broadly.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The foreclosure comes after an affiliate of China-based\nZ&amp;L Properties defaulted\non a $19.5 million loan.\nZ&amp;L had been approved to build a 708-unit residential tower at the site but never broke ground. The company fought to keep the site via two Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases and a lawsuit to block the foreclosure, but they were unsuccessful. Z&amp;L claimed it spent $44.2 million on land purchase and pre-construction costs before the asset was seized. The new owners aren\u2019t looking to deviate from that plan.\n\u201cThe vacant land at issue is a rotting, empty former Greyhound Station,\u201d the lender said in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court filing. \u201cIf allowed to proceed [with foreclosure], the lender has the resources to develop this piece of property as originally entitled.\u201d\n\nWith the Greyhound terminal now out of its hands, Z&amp;L Properties, which once boasted a large real estate empire in the Bay Area, now owns just one property. A Z&amp;L affiliate\nowns a historic church at 43 East Saint James Street\n. Z&amp;L previously proposed a two-tower housing development at that site, which would also renovate the aging church. But, as with its plans for the Greyhound station, the project remains at a standstill.\nXu\u2019s real estate activity has largely been concentrated in the New York City area. The developer counts residential towers and a hotel in Queens among his developments. In San Jose, in January of last year, a group led by the developer\nacquired most of the Eastridge Center\nshopping mall in East San Jose for $135 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

But that\u2019s down about $324 million from the last time the bank\nreported\nits numbers, in July.\nThe\ndecrease\nis part of Flagstar\u2019s effort to right the ship after a disastrous 2024, when the company disclosed issues with its lending and sparked a stock sell-off that pushed it to the brink of collapse. The bank posted a net loss in the third quarter of 2025, but its smallest since 2023, at eleven cents per share.\nAbout 60 percent of Flagstar\u2019s loans to New York City multifamily buildings are tied to heavily rent-stabilized properties.\nOf its loans tied to New York City rent-stabilized buildings, about 45 percent have some financial red flags, according to Flagstar. Nearly half of those red-flag loans are not accruing interest and have been charged off.\nThe value of those loans is equal to about 80 percent of the appraised value of the properties. Net profits of those properties are slightly higher than their annual debt service.\n\u201cWe think we\u2019re more than covered, were there to be any further degradation in this portion of the portfolio,\u201d said Lee Smith, Flagstar\u2019s CFO.\nThose properties are 99 percent occupied, up slightly from last quarter, and 80 percent have seen a recent appraisal, according to Flagstar.\n\nMayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani has proposed freezing rents in rent-stabilized apartments. That would stymie revenue growth at a time the sector has seen growing distress, although the impact may not be felt for some time.\n\u201cThe way you model that out is you just make the assumption they\u2019re going to be flat revenues,\u201d said Joseph Otting, Flagstar\u2019s CEO. \u201cYou really need to understand the expense side because that\u2019ll make the difference on whether these properties are positive on a cash flow basis.\u201d\nExpenses for New York real estate have gone up significantly, most notably insurance costs.\nThe bigger impact on the properties may come from reductions in interest rates, Smith said. That could benefit owners struggling with debt.\nFlagstar has seen $372 million in net charge-offs for its total New York City multifamily portfolio since January 2024.\nThe bank will start originating new loans for commercial real estate, but outside New York, Smith said.\n\u201cThis won\u2019t be rent-regulated New York City loans,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for high-quality, geographically-diversified CRE loans in other parts of that footprint \u2014 the Midwest, California, South Florida.\u201d\n",

        "content": "More than a decade after sparking a squabble over housing in the Mission District, an affordable residential development is moving forward in the neighborhood.\nOn Wednesday, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors Budget and Finance Committee unanimously approved $60 million in revenue bonds for La Maravilla, a three-building, 350-unit supportive housing complex developed by the Mission Economic Development Agency and Mission Housing, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n.\nThe $110 million La Maravilla project is set to rise over the 16th Street\nBART station\n. Developer\nMaximus Real Estate Partners\nacquired the site on the northeast corner of 16th and Mission in 2013 and proposed building 330 market-rate apartments \u2014 an idea that became known as\n\u201cThe Monster in the Mission\u201d\nby opponents in the area.\nNeighborhood activists formed the Plaza 16 Coalition to advocate for affordable housing in the area to avoid the displacement of locals. In response, the city\u2019s planning department put a temporary moratorium on market-rate housing in the Mission District. Eventually, the Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing and Community Development acquired the 16th Street BART site from Maximus.\nAt the same time, several\naffordable housing projects\nbegan sprouting up. This included 168 units at 1515 South Van Ness Avenue, 81 units at 490 South Van Ness Avenue, 157 units at 1950 Mission Street and 127 units at 2060 Folsom Street. In total, approximately 800 affordable apartments have been built and another 600 are in the pipeline.\n\nThose developments came about thanks to the work of the Plaza 16 Coalition, according to Sam Moss, executive director of Mission Housing.\n\u201cOne of the most important aspects of the Maravilla is that it is being developed by Mission community orgs for the Mission community,\u201d Moss told the Chronicle. \u201cThe developer fees, the resources, the financing \u2014 it\u2019s all staying in the Mission.\u201d\nDemolition at the 16th and Mission site for December and construction will begin in January.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Retailers are racing to secure space in\nNorth Texas\u2019 fastest-growing suburbs\n, even with climbing construction costs and\nsoaring rents\n.\nIn Prosper, Celina and\nMelissa\n, asking rents for new retail space have surged from the mid-$30s per square foot five years ago to as high as $50 per square foot today, a jump of about 42 percent, Bisnow\nreported\n, citing a Weitzman report.\nThat works out to an annual base rent of about $100,000 for a 2,000-square-foot space, or around $8,300 per month. The price tag means small independent businesses won\u2019t be a major part of the retail landscape in these fast-growing suburbs, Bisnow said.\nThe spike is traceable to rising construction costs that developers say is forcing their hand, said Weitzman\u2019s Ben Terry.\n\u201cThe only way a developer can make these projects pencil is, unfortunately, by raising the rents,\u201d Terry told the outlet.\nWeitzman recently delivered the first 36,000-square-foot phase of The Creeks at Celina, a shopping center less than a half-mile from Dallas Parkway. Bids for the project\u2019s second phase came in roughly 20 percent higher than the first, Terry said, adding pressure to push rents higher.\nDespite the sticker shock, the appetite for space hasn\u2019t slowed. Household incomes in\nCelina\nand\nProsper\n\u2014 averaging $156,000 and $187,000, respectively \u2014 have given retailers confidence that consumers can handle higher price points. Around The Creeks at Celina, average household income tops $238,000, according to Weitzman.\nRegionally, limited supply and surging demand drove annual rent growth of 4.3 percent across DFW during the third quarter, per Matthews. The metro\u2019s average asking rent of $25.15 per square foot lags the wealthy northern suburbs, where Frisco leads at just over $40 per square foot and Allen and McKinney each top $30.\n\nA Coda Consulting Group report found that new retail construction in Prosper and McKinney commonly leases in the mid- to high-$40s per square foot, with restaurants exceeding $50. Vacancy rates remain tight \u2014 under 3.5 percent in McKinney and Frisco, and 4.3 percent in Allen.\nDevelopers blame rising material and labor costs \u2014 worsened by trade restrictions and immigration curbs \u2014 for the pricing pressure. Nonresidential construction costs are up 2.6 percent year-over-year nationwide, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nGrocery anchors like H-E-B, Kroger and Walmart are increasingly buying their own sites to sidestep soaring rents.\nCoda\u2019s Coni Hennersdorf said construction remains strongest in areas with available land. Allen, McKinney and Frisco together have about 900,000 square feet of retail under construction \u2014 13 percent of the DFW pipeline.\nTo offset costs, developers are leaning more on restaurant tenants, which generate higher sales and can absorb higher rents. Chad Long, VP of commercial development at Wilks Development, said restaurant-heavy projects like Frisco\u2019s multibillion-dollar Firefly Park are designed for affluent consumers.\nWeitzman is planning another 17,000-square-foot retail project in Flower Mound as part of a larger mixed-use development, with a $50 per square foot rent \u201cfloor.\u201d Terry said tenant demand there has been \u201cfantastic.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The residential condo board at 75 Wall Street scored a win in its dispute with its downstairs neighbor.\nThe board at the Financial District luxury condominium, which sits atop the Hyatt Centric Wall Street Hotel,\nfiled a lawsuit in May\narguing that the hotel owed nearly half a million dollars in unpaid common and utility charges.\nThe suit was filed on behalf of the property master board, which is made up of three residential members and four representatives affiliated with the hotel. This week, the judge ruled that residential members of the master board may place a lien on the hotel unit until its balances have been paid.\nThe judge also prohibited the hotel\u2019s board affiliates, which constitute a majority on the master board, from taking any action on behalf of the master board or holding a special meeting, something that the hotel\u2019s affiliated board members repeatedly tried to do in the wake of the lawsuit being filed.\nThe residential board said in a statement it was pleased with the judge\u2019s ruling. The hotel did not respond to a request for comment.\nPassing the buck\nThings have been awkward at the building for some time now, in what has essentially turned into a bad roommate situation, replete with unattended house meetings and bickering about who owes what.\nThe hotel is owned by an entity affiliated with Naveen Shah\u2019s Navika Capital, which purchased the portion of the building in 2021\nfor $85 million\n. The condo board claimed that the hotel stopped paying utility charges in January 2023 and has not kept current with common charges and special assessments levied since April 2024.\nIn May 2024, the building\u2019s general manager emailed the master board, telling them that she had continued \u201cto receive emails and calls on a daily basis from vendors wanting to know when they can expect payment,\u201d adding that the vendors were \u201cbeyond frustrated and have threatened to suspend services or file a lien if payment is not received soon.\u201d\nAt that point, the hotel allegedly owed nearly $320,000 in unpaid charges. The master board tried to hold a special meeting in June, but the hotel\u2019s representatives refused to attend, according to testimony from Dhwani Srivastava, the residential and master board president.\n\nThe following September, Srivastava emailed the master board to demand that outstanding balances be paid.\nThis time, the hotel\u2019s board members ordered a special meeting in October, where they agreed to deposit $135,000 into escrow, according to Srivastava.\nBy March of this year, the funds had not been deposited and the master board took a vote to place a lien on the hotel unit. The vote was defeated, given the hotel\u2019s majority representation on the board, according to Srivastava.\nIn response, the hotel representatives tried to hold another special meeting in June in an alleged attempt to remove Srivastava as president and replace the master board\u2019s general counsel with the law firm currently representing them, according to Srivastava.\nWhile the two sides argued in court over whether Shah and the hotel representatives had the authority to hold a special meeting, Con Edison informed the building\u2019s general manager on June 18 that service would be shut off by 3:30 p.m. that day if payment was not received.\nShah wired roughly $101,000 that day to pay off a portion of the arrears, but substantially less than the amount the residential board claimed the hotel owed, which had ballooned to over $500,000 by the end of June.\nThe hotel\u2019s board members sought to hold another special meeting in July, which the judge ruled they were ineligible to organize, given they still owed outstanding balances.\nThe dispute will now likely center on how much the hotel actually owes. The hotel allegedly is behind on almost $360,000 in utility charges, of which it paid roughly two-thirds \u201cunder protest\u201d on June 30. The hotel has claimed it doesn\u2019t owe the remainder of that balance due to incorrect electrical billing.\nThe board is seeking an additional $700,000 for the hotel unit\u2019s alleged breach of its fiduciary duty.\n",

        "content": "TA Realty picked up a 476-unit apartment complex in Palm Beach Gardens for $193 million, marking a continuing uptick of multifamily investment sales in South Florida.\nBoston-based TA Realty bought the gated garden-style community at 100 Portofino Drive from New York-based Blackstone, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The deal breaks down to $405,462 per unit.\nTA Realty assumed Blackstone\u2019s existing $108.5 million Freddie Mac loan on the property, records show. Generally, buyers\u2019 assumption of sellers\u2019 existing loans on properties allows the buyers to secure debt with a lower interest rate. The practice has become more common in the past three years due to elevated interest rates.\nCompleted in 2002 and 2003, the complex consists of 31 two-story apartment buildings on a 31-acre site, Vizzda records show. The community, previously called San Merano at Mirasol, has one- to three-bedroom apartments, according to Apartments.com. Rents aren\u2019t listed.\nTA Realty previously owned the complex, purchasing it for $69.1 million from developer Kolter in 2010. In 2017, TA Realty sold it to Blackstone, led by Stephen Schwarzman, for $103.6 million, according to records.\nTA Realty \u2013\u2013 led by managing partners James Buckingham, Michael Haggerty and James Raisides \u2013\u2013 has roughly $19 billion of assets under management across commercial property types, according to its website.\n\nIn January, TA Realty paid\n$118 million\nfor the 300-unit Pines West apartment complex at 16700 Sheridan Street in Pembroke Pines.\nIn June, the firm bought a 43.7-acre industrial development site in Opa-locka from Blackstone for\n$105.7 million\n. The site at 12691 Northwest LeJeune Road is planned as the second phase of Ironwood Commerce Center. TA Realty also bought the completed portion of Ironwood Commerce Center at 12700 Northwest 42nd Avenue for\n$160 million\nfrom Blackstone and its Link Logistics affiliate in December. Blackstone and its Link Logistics subsidiary have been unloading industrial properties in South Florida over the past year, with the selloff totaling roughly\n$1 billion\n.\nSouth Florida multifamily sales have picked up this year after slowing last year largely due to the higher interest rates. Many buyers are relying on discretionary funds, which need to deploy capital; Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae loans; and debt from insurance companies. Others are assuming sellers\u2019 loans or purchasing all cash.\nThis month, Tishman Speyer bought the 270-unit Bell at Broken Sound at 5500 Broken Sound Boulevard Northwest and 950 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway in Boca Raton for\n$124.5 million\n. Tishman Speyer used a $78.4 million Fannie Mae loan for the purchase.\nAlso this month, Morgan Properties paid\n$69.95 million\nfor the 300-unit Visions at Willow Pond complex at 4860 Sand Stone Lane near West Palm Beach. Morgan borrowed a $49.9 million Freddie Mac loan for the purchase.\nIn August, Related Fund Management bought the 292-unit Aura Delray Beach at 2095 West Atlantic Avenue in Delray Beach for\n$116.9 million\n. The buyer also used a $59.1 million Freddie Mac loan for the purchase.\n",

The dustup started when county officials\u00a0 informed the\nCity of Santa Monica\nthat two former senior living properties on the 400 and 800 blocks of Ocean Avenue will be turned into temporary housing for 49 people with behavioral health challenges, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\nThe incoming residents are enrolled in the county\u2019s\ntransitional housing\nprogram.\nSanta Monica Mayor Lana Negrete joined residents in criticizing the move by the county.\n\u201cThe system is not working fairly and informing people and it\u2019s above our heads often coming from state and county \u2014 yet we have to manage the chaos,\u201d Negrete told the Times. \u201cI think everybody deserves to know what is happening in their community and to be able to voice their concern, and shouldn\u2019t be chastised or villainized for having a response or a fear.\u201d\n\nFor now, the county has hit pause as it prepares to host a town hall and offer public tours of the facilities.\n\u201cWe want to ensure that everyone is heard, properly informed, and has multiple opportunities to provide feedback and help shape how the project is implemented,\u201d the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health said in a statement.\nL.A. County operates the largest county-run mental health department in the country, boasting a budget of nearly $3 billion. Last year, L.A. was one of 10 counties to receive nearly $133 million with the purpose of housing homeless people and those experiencing mental illness. That funding includes the Ocean Avenue transitional housing in question.\nThe\nVenice\n-based nonprofit St. Joseph Center will manage the facilities while the Department of Mental Health will operate the properties through the state\u2019s Behavioral Health Bridge Housing fund. The goal with the incoming residents is to transition them into secure housing while providing mental health treatment and other resources.

        "content": "Hyperion Group has teamed up with a veteran New York real estate investor to buy a\nNew Jersey rental building\nwhose owners were struggling to refinance the CMBS loan.\nHyperionMFP Partners, a joint venture between the New York- and South Florida-based investment and development firm and Lawrence Benenson of Benenson Capital Partners, snapped up The Centre, a 314-unit luxury rental building in Cliffside Park, New Jersey, for $165 million in an off-market deal.\n\u201cWe were attracted to the property, and it was a good opportunity, given market conditions,\u201d said Hyperion\u2019s Rob Vecsler.\nCompleted in 2017, The Centre sits in the heart of Cliffside Park\u2019s business district and has 50,000 square feet of retail. The seller, Arilex Realty, controlled by Arianne Schreer and Alexis Pizzurro \u2014 daughters of veteran Gold Coast developer James Demetrakis \u2014 financed the building with a $130 million CMBS loan after paying off a TPG Real Estate Finance bridge loan in 2017.\n\nThe property has maintained occupancy above 90 percent and generates cash flow stronger than initial underwriting expectations, with a debt service coverage ratio of 2.4, according to Morningstar. As of July, the building was 97 percent occupied, with an average rent of $3,200, per Trepp.\nBut when the CMBS debt matured in July 2024, Arilex was unable to refinance. A two-month forbearance expired in early September, and the loan\u2019s special servicer began modification talks as higher interest rates squeezed valuations and lending terms.\nA recent appraisal valued the property at $161.1 million, about 14 percent below its $188 million valuation when the mortgage was issued.\nThe sale effectively resolves the debt issue while giving the new venture a foothold in one of northern New Jersey\u2019s strongest rental markets. Vecsler said it will target similar opportunities in the Tristate region and South Florida, where it sees opportunity for rent growth and asset appreciation.\n",

        "content": "In the fall of 2023, developer Michael Shvo told a crowd of real estate professionals that buyers were paying up to $12,000 per square foot for condos at the planned ultra-luxury Raleigh project in Miami Beach.\n\u201cWe probably have the most expensive product in Miami Beach,\u201d\nShvo said\nat\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s Showcase and Forum. \u201cWe are seeing high-profile buyers,\u201d including from Middle East countries like Qatar and Turkey.\nAt the time, Shvo was leading the planned redevelopment of the Raleigh, South Seas and Richmond hotels on Collins Avenue into a 60-key hotel and 42-unit condominium. The project was closely followed by many who wanted to see the iconic Art Deco Raleigh brought back to life after years of dormancy.\nIt also marked Shvo\u2019s trophy asset in one of the hottest markets in the country, where his pipeline also included three planned Class A office projects in Miami Beach.\nBut just two years later, Shvo this month\nsold the Raleigh assemblage\nto New York-based Nahla Capital for $270 million. In September, he sold\nThe Alton office development site\nvia a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure to Infinity Collective for $28.3 million.\nAn affiliate of New York-based Shvo, the developer\u2019s company, still owns an office development site on Washington Avenue in Miami Beach. The third office project was planned for the clock tower building on Lincoln Road, but Shvo did not end up purchasing the property.\nThe sale of the Raleigh marks a dramatic exit for Shvo. He declined to comment for this story through a spokesperson.\nShvo\u2019s timeline\nShvo made a big splash in 2019 when he and his then-partners, Bilgili Holdings and Deutsche Finance America, acquired the three hotels that make up the nearly 3-acre Raleigh assemblage, paying a\ncombined $242.9 million\n. That included Tommy Hilfiger and the Dogus Group\u2019s sale of the Raleigh at 1775 Collins Avenue in Miami Beach for $103 million earlier that same year. The property, known for its fleur-de-lis-shaped pool, had been shuttered since Hurricane Irma hit South Florida in September of 2017.\nTurkish investor Serdar Bilgili\u2019s Bilgili Holdings eventually exited the project following a court settlement of a\ndispute\nwith Shvo.\nShvo and his team worked on plans for the project, and in 2022 marked a few milestones. The Miami Beach Historic Preservation Board\napproved changes\nthat allowed for a deeper underground garage.\n\nShvo also announced that Rosewood Hotels &amp; Resorts would brand the planned 17-story, 44-unit condo tower and manage the 60-key hotel. Cheval Blanc, a luxury hotel group owned by LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, was expected to brand the hotel, but that deal fell through, sources told\nTRD\nat the time.\nA year later in 2023, Shvo launched condo sales. The developer tapped Oren and Tal Alexander\u2019s Side-backed brokerage, Official, to lead sales and marketing. But the developer took a more extreme approach than the competition, one that industry experts said contributed to the project\u2019s downfall. The invitation-only strategy focused on Rosewood VIPs and friends of Shvo and New York architect Peter Marino. (Marino designed the plans along with Kobi Karp Architecture &amp; Interior Design.)\nIn the summer of 2023, Shvo and his partners secured\na $190 million refinancing\noriginated by BH3, a Fort Lauderdale-based lender, investment and development firm led by Dan Lebensohn and Greg Freedman. It paid off a $146.9 million loan that Acore Capital provided in 2019.\nSources told\nTRD\nthat presales lagged behind competitors such as Witkoff and Monroe Capital\u2019s Auberge-branded redevelopment of the\nShore Club property\na few blocks away at 1901 Collins Avenue.\nSome say the market for ultra luxury condo developments has softened following the post-pandemic boom. While most developers are delayed in completing their projects, construction under Shvo\u2019s ownership never went vertical. The Raleigh was originally expected to be completed in 2026.\nIt didn\u2019t help that a year after hiring Official, rape allegations against the Alexander brothers surfaced that ultimately led to Oren and Tal Alexander stepping away from the business, and developers who worked with the brokerage severed ties.\nAna Bozovic, broker and founder of Analytics Miami, said Shvo\u2019s sale of the property is more of a reflection of the challenges the capital markets are facing than it was about his sales strategy.\n\u201cWhen I see that this project has failed, with the construct of his involvement, the first thing that comes to my mind is challenges with capital markets,\u201d Bozovic said. \u201c[Developers] who had time pressure to perform have been ultra-challenged.\u201d\nBozovic said that buyers with cash to spend have options. The fact that the project\u2019s performance and delays were publicized likely introduced fear into the project, she said.\nSigns of trouble at the Raleigh continued to bubble up. Earlier this year, the Raleigh\u2019s ownership hired Newmark to market the property to potential bidders. That\u2019s how Nahla entered the picture with the winning bid.\nShvo had the right of first refusal and tried to match the offer, but ultimately sold the assemblage in October, when BH3\u2019s most recent extension expired. Nahla has not yet revealed its plans for the project. Its co-founder and managing principal Genghis Hadi did not respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Three New Buffalo homes found buyers this month in less than a week \u2014 indicating strong demand for desirable properties in the southwest Michigan resort town.\nTwo lakefront houses on Marquette Drive were listed this month asking nearly $7 million \u2014 the priciest listings this year, and among just a few lakefront listings this year.\nBoth houses are listed by Liz Roch, with @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate. She could not be reached for comment\nOne property, at 11561 Marquette Drive, was listed Oct. 2 and went into contract Oct. 5. The 5,500 square-foot house has five bedrooms and five-and-a-half bathrooms, with 100 feet of private beach frontage, according to the listing.\nAnother, at\n11869 Marquette Drive\n\u2014 the house of former Illinois Republican House Speaker Lee Daniels \u2014 went on the market Oct. 16 and went into contract Oct. 22. The nearly 5,000-square-foot house has five bedrooms and five-and-a-half bathrooms.\nThe record sale in New Buffalo was for an off-market deal for $8.5 million in 2023. Earlier this year, DRW Holdings founder and CEO\nsold his mansion in nearby Union Pier\nfor $7 million, the highest publicly listed sale in the area in recent years.\nMoving further inland, a house at 50111 Deer Park Drive priced at $4.4 million found a buyer just a few days after hitting the market on Oct. 15. The property\u2019s listing agent, Jan Smith of @properties, said the first person to tour the house went under contract within 48 hours.\n\u201cThis is usually a pretty quiet time of the year, and there\u2019s been quite a bit of activity of late,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI think people are trying to lock down spring-summer 2026 now as opposed to waiting.\u201d\n\nNew Buffalo is a popular second-home destination for\nChicago buyers\n. Smith said many of the buyers she encounters are from the city, looking for a nearby vacation home.\nThe two lakefront properties were rarities in New Buffalo, where lakefront listings have been sparse. One beach house sold for $2.4 million in August, finding a buyer in about a week. A couple other lakefront houses are listed at around $4 million, but none have approached the $7 million price tag on both Marquette Drive properties.\nNot everything in the town\nis moving. One inland house priced at nearly $4.9 million has been on the market since March 2024, and has been listed a few times without selling since 2021. Another Marquette Drive lakefront house has been listed on and off since September 2024 without finding a buyer.\nSmith said the properties that landed buyers quickly this month were all turnkey and up-to-date, which elevated interest.\n\u201cThis speaks to the properties that just went under contract, their condition,\u201d Smith said. \u201cA lot of times these properties haven\u2019t traded for many years and require a lot of work.\u201d\nDemand for property in New Buffalo has also moved inland recently, according to Smith. She said she\u2019s seeing more properties listed north of $4 million off the lake than she has in the past.\n\u201cThis is a very small area, so there just isn\u2019t very much inventory,\u201d Smith said. \u201cSo when something good comes up, there\u2019s an audience and someone\u2019s going to snap it up.\u201d\n",

Former UTSA professor and geologist Stuart Birnbaum called TCEQ\u2019s focus on limited contaminants \u201cblinders.\u201d\nTCEQ\u2019s decision sparked a backlash from the Scenic Loop\u2013Helotes Creek Alliance, which is backed by 15,000 letters from residents and lawmakers opposing the development.\nGuajolote Ranch has also become a flashpoint for affordable housing concerns. Even though San Antonio stands to face a 70,000-unit housing shortage by 2030, the homes in the community, expected to list between $300,000 and $700,000, will be unaffordable for many San Antonio residents, 30 percent of whom are below the poverty line.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand why a seventh project is essential,\u201d alliance chair Randy Neumann told the outlet, pointing to\nslow sales\nand discounts at Lennar\u2019s nearby subdivisions.\nLennar\u2019s plan for Guajolote Ranch includes 50 percent open space and a public improvement district. It\u2019s seeking $138 million in bonds to fund roads and utilities, which will cost homeowners more than $1,000 annually. County commissioners and the City Council are expected to vote on the PID this fall.\nDespite a\nsoftening market\n, Lennar is pressing ahead, issuing new bid solicitations through Pape-Dawson Engineers in October. Company officials didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nDevelopers argue that rising construction costs and scarce land closer to the city make projects like Guajolote inevitable. But environmentalists counter that each approval weakens protections for the Hill Country\u2019s fragile ecosystems.\n\u201cApproval here sets a precedent,\u201d Birnbaum said, warning that adjacent Medina and Kendall counties could be next.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

She has had a long-time friendship with the mayor, with the two often popping up at each other\u2019s events or in photographs together. In July, Srugo\nlaunched\na PAC to support Adams\u2019 re-election bid, which he ended last month.\nLike much of the city\u2019s real estate community, she has also been outspoken in her opposition to a Mamdani mayoralty.

        "content": "A group of homeowners on North Bay Road, one of Miami Beach\u2019s priciest streets, are pushing a plan to install security gates as a result of a string of auto thefts and increased traffic.\nThe street is home to celebrities and some of the city\u2019s wealthiest residents, including Mickey Drexler,\nCindy Crawford and Rande Gerber\n, Joshua Kushner and Karlie Kloss,\nDavid and Victoria Beckham\nand Barry Gibb.\nAbout eight or nine car thefts have occurred on North Bay Road in each of the past four years, compared with 14 in 2020, the\nWall Street Journal\nreported. Miami Beach Police Department spokesperson Chris Bess said they are related to a nationwide organized crime ring. In many cases, residents left their keys in the car with the engine on, or left their cars unlocked.\nThe Journal reported that two people jumped the fence surrounding developer\nMichael Stern\n\u2019s waterfront mansion and tried to steal his Maybach. Stern was not in the car; his private security, a former New York City police officer, was sitting in the front seat with the engine idling.\n\nCritics of the proposal to install security gates view it as an effort by wealthy residents to isolate themselves from the rest of Miami Beach, even if it means redirecting traffic onto their neighbors on Alton Road, and limiting how residents in other neighborhoods like Alton can access their homes. Some also say that walling off a portion of the street is a veiled attempt to\nraise property values.\nColdwell Banker\u2019s Danny Hertzberg, of the Jills Zeder Group, estimated that property values could rise up to 20 percent if gates are installed.\nNorth Bay Road residents in the middle section collected signatures from at least 10 percent of their households to move forward with the process to create a special taxation district. If the Miami Beach Commission approves the proposal, 50 percent of homeowners would have to vote in favor of gating off their neighborhood. The plan would also require Miami-Dade County\u2019s approval. The gates could cost between $200,000 and $300,000, which would be paid for via taxes imposed on those homeowners.\n\u2014 Katherine Kallergis",

        "content": "The\nElon Musk-fueled\nspate of development coming to Bastrop has political leaders of the Central Texas town wondering if it still needs an economic development corporation.\nCity officials in the fast-growing town 30 miles east of Austin are considering a ballot measure to dissolve the Bastrop Economic Development Corporation, signaling a dramatic shift in how the city approaches growth and business incentives, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nCity Council and the EDC board met Oct. 21 and directed staff to craft a dissolution plan for voter consideration in November of next year. The move reflects mounting skepticism about the EDC\u2019s usefulness at a time when Bastrop has become a magnet for major employers without needing the kind of subsidies or tax incentives that once defined the city\u2019s strategy.\nBastrop is home to facilities for\nMusk\u2019s Boring Company and SpaceX\nand has gotten the attention of the film industry with actor\nZachary Levi launching a $100 million campus\nin the town for the filming of \u201cnon-woke movies.\u201d Development activity has also spurred\nmultifamily projects\n; plus, the city is weighing a\n390-acre mixed-use development\nthat would include a convention center, hospital and hotel.\n\u201cOnce upon a time, Bastrop created the EDC and set this tax up because we were a sleepy little town,\u201d Mayor Pro Tem John Kirkland said during the meeting. \u201cWe\u2019re no longer that. We\u2019re a destination for businesses.\u201d\nBastrop established its EDC in 1995, funded by a portion of local sales taxes. After years of tension over spending priorities, voters slashed the EDC\u2019s funding by 75 percent last year, redirecting most of the revenue to road improvements. The agency now receives just one-eighth of a cent of sales tax, or about $1.1 million annually, compared with $3.3 million going to infrastructure.\n\nCity Manager Sylvia Carrillo-Trevino, who also serves as the EDC\u2019s interim executive director, said the organization has long suffered from limited authority and friction with past councils. The EDC can\u2019t act independently on incentives or land purchases, requiring council sign-off \u2014 a dynamic some officials described as a \u201cparent-child relationship.\u201d\nSupporters of dissolution argue the city can still offer targeted incentives without the EDC, freeing up funds for community projects like park upgrades, downtown infrastructure and affordable housing. Officials have floated ideas ranging from a $10 million arena renovation and downtown parking garage to new partnerships with local colleges. Another option under consideration: diverting the sales tax to a crime control district that could fund five or six new police officers.\nThe EDC still has about $5 million in outstanding obligations, including $2 million owed to Acutronic USA under a prior incentive deal, which would have to be addressed before winding down.\nMayor Ishmael Harris cautioned against sending the wrong message, saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to give the impression that we\u2019re not trying to have businesses come here.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The week in New York City, real estate was all about trouble: who\u2019s been in it before, who\u2019s in it today and how to avoid it in the future.\nFor Eli Karp, trouble arose this week. Madison Realty Capital\ntook over\nhis Flatbush property at 1580 Nostrand Avenue with a $70 million credit bid, where Karp once planned a sprawling two-building development called\nHello Nostrand\non the site.\nKarp\u2019s Hello Living bought the site for $13 million in 2014 touting plans to build a luxury apartment complex. As soon as construction started, however, he ran into trouble with lenders.\nHe put the property into\nbankruptcy\nin 2021, a day before senior lender\nMadison Realty Capital\ncould launch a UCC foreclosure process. Madison sold a $6 million mezzanine loan and $73 million senior loan on the property to another firm, Arch Companies, which proceeded to sue Karp to initiate another foreclosure on the property.\nHe has only finished one of the buildings, a 93-unit rental which was auctioned off in June alongside the undeveloped property. The once-rising star also lost 2417 Albemarle Road to his lender in a credit bid via auction.\nWrecking crew\nDemolition company Alba Services confronted issues from its past.\nThe nonunion subcontractor agreed to pay\n$1.5 million to settle\nclaims that it flouted New York\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws, retaliated against injured workers and failed to address reports of sexual harassment.\nAlba allegedly failed to report hundreds of workplace injuries between 2016 and 2024, allowing the company to lower its insurance costs. The company also threatened employees who tried filing workers\u2019 compensation claims.\nThe settlement was announced by the New York Attorney General\u2019s office, but the ball started rolling when the laborers\u2019 union, Local 79, launched a public\ncampaign\nagainst the firm in 2022, accusing it of offering rewards for information on employees who filed \u201cfalse\u201d workers\u2019 compensation claims as a means of intimidation.\nAs part of the settlement, the company will be overseen by the attorney general\u2019s office for at least three years and is required to file biannual reports showing compliance with workers\u2019 compensation and human rights laws.\n\nLitigation concerns are nothing new for Alba. In 2023, it was one of 26 companies\nindicted\nin a wide-ranging construction kickback scheme; Alba received $2.8 million in inflated contracts and change orders at 250 Fifth Avenue and 189 Bowery, according to the indictment.\nThe wolf\u2019s den\nTrouble used to dog Jordan Belfort \u2014 the inspiration of Martin Scorsese\u2019s Oscar-winning \u201cWolf of Wall Street.\u201d While he\u2019s looking to turn over a new leaf as a motivational speaker, anything connected to the disgraced former stockbroker and convicted felon will continue to grab headlines.\nHis former Long Island mansion at 5 Pin Oak Court in Glen Head\nfound a buyer at a $6.9 million\nprice point. lived in the 8,700-square-foot home with his wife, Nadine Macaluso, during the height of his career in the 1990s.\nThe feds took Belfort\u2019s home in 2001, two years after his conviction of securities fraud and prior to a two-year stint in federal prison. So much for \u201cnot f*king leaving,\u201d in the words of Leonardo DiCaprio, who played Belfort in the film.\nBelfort pivoted his life and moved west, buying an oceanfront home in Hermosa Beach in California, but has since apparently relocated to Miami during the pandemic.\nReboot\nSpeaking of pivots, Richard Coles and Gary Tischler\u2019s Vanbarton Group are becoming masters of office-to-residential conversions. This week, the company\nlanded a $280 million loan\nfrom Invesco to refinance a 455-unit building at 980 Sixth Avenue.\nThe loan replaces a $273 million one from Blackstone\u2019s mortgage trust. Vanbarton went seeking the permanent financing after converting WeWork\u2019s former three floors into 77 market-rate apartments.\nThe firm is one of the most\nactive office-to-residential converters\nin the city with a pipeline exceeding 2,000 units.\nYour move,\nNathan Berman\n.\n",

        "content": "The city has seen a spate of announcements for new sauna and spa concepts.\nThe most recent is Lore, a so-called \u201cbathing club\u201d in Noho that opened last month.\nAt the same time, Othership, whose Flatiron location offers both classes and raves, opened its Williamsburg location.\nWilliamsburg\u2019s Bathhouse, where the pools are heated by crypto mining and its lawyers have assured the public the water is\nNOT giving people UTIs\n, opened its Flatiron location last year.\nNot to be outdone, Kith Ivy, a padel club from the streetwear brand, plans to nestle a cold plunge, sauna and jacuzzi between the Erewhon tonic bar and the Giorgio Armani-branded locker room.\nRemedy Place, which bills itself as a \u201csocial wellness club,\u201d started in West Hollywood but opened its third location in Soho in November.\nFinally, sauna concept Saint is planning to open this fall in MAG Partners\u2019 residential building Ruby on West 29th Street.\nTo be sure, Manhattan had its fair share of saunas before this most recent wave: Koreatown\u2019s many spas, the Russian and Turkish Baths, your everyday Equinox locker room.\nAnd before that, there were gay bathhouses, although most of those were closed by the city in the 1980s in a controversial attempt to stem the spread of HIV.\nBut these new sauna concepts seem to be trying to do something slightly different: marketing these locations as a place to socialize. This is a reversal of the more traditional sauna etiquette, which calls for only quiet conversations.\nThe thinking is that people want a place to meet others that\u2019s not drinking or on their phones. Why not in a bathing suit, dripping in sweat?\nAt Othership, there are group sauna classes to facilitate that connection.\n\u201cRegardless of how long you stay in that ice bath, you\u2019re doing it with people you\u2019ve never met before,\u201d said Cassie Durand, an executive vice president at CBRE who is working with Othership expansion locations. \u201cYou\u2019re instantly connected, you instantly feel a sense of accomplishment that\u2019s a shared activity.\u201d\nLore has also tried to play up its role as a potential \u201cthird space.\u201d At Remedy Place and Kith Ivy, a social club is baked into the offering.\n(The exception here is Saint, which offers private sauna \u201cstudios,\u201d explaining, \u201cIn a time of \u2018social saunas,\u2019 we hope to offer something else: quiet moments of solitude.\u201d)\nThe interest in saunas and cold plunges appears to be national, Durand said. Home saunas are taking off among the nation\u2019s higher-dollar homebuyers, the New York Times\nreported\n. So it makes sense that New Yorkers, used to apartment living, would turn to more public options.\n\nAnd there has been broader interest citywide in boutique health and wellness, as the Real Estate Board of New York noted in a recent retail report.\n\u201cIt illustrates how formative COVID was in terms of awareness of self-care and mental well-being,\u201d said Keith DeCoster, vice president of research at REBNY.\nHowever, there are hurdles to building these sauna and cold plunge locations from a real estate perspective.\n\u201cYou\u2019re dealing with small pools, tons of power, just objectively challenging infrastructure requirements combined with code,\u201d Durand said. Part of the reason these businesses, including Othership, cluster in Flatiron, she said, is that the area pulls in the residential, office and tourism markets.\nSo, come on in \u2014 the water\u2019s freezing.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nPrivate equity owners have been getting into New York\u2019s multifamily market for a little while now. But what are they like as landlords? Well-capitalized stewards? Neglectful bad actors? Drop me a line:\nlilah.burke@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nYou can incorporate a sign as a commercial condo unit, as illustrated by the $12 million sale of a Times Square billboard this week. Vornado previously nabbed a $407 million loan in part secured by a\nsix-story billboard\non the Marriott Marquis.\nElsewhere\n\u2014 House Minority Leader and Brooklyn voter Hakeem Jeffries has offered Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani a last-minute endorsement. \u201cZohran Mamdani has relentlessly focused on addressing the affordability crisis and explicitly committed to being a Mayor for all New Yorkers, including those who do not support his candidacy,\u201d Jeffries said in a statement.\n\u2014 New York State Attorney General Letitia James pled not guilty today on charges of mortgage fraud, Politico\nreported\n.\n\u2014 The city\u2019s new 15 mph speed limit on e-bikes goes into effect today. Devotees of CitiBike\u2019s \u201cWhite Stallion\u201d e-bike are not pleased, the\nTimes\nreported.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$36 million\nfor 10 East 67th Street. The Lenox Hill mansion is 13,000 square feet. It last sold on-market for $28.5 million in 2006.\nSerhant\u2019s\nMelissa Post and Ryan Serhant have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$6.1 million\nfor 96 South 9th Street. The Williamsburg church is three stories and 3,400 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $5.8 million for 720 West End Avenue, Unit 11C.

Brown Harris Stevens\u2019\nJohn Burger\nand\nCaroline Berthet\nhad the listing.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nIn the West Village, a condo at\n299 West 12th Street\nchanged hands for $6.5 million, its asking price. The buyers were\nDavid Held\nand\nLisa Fisher.\nThe seller was actor\nDanny Strong\n, who paid $1.4 million for the unit in 2011. The two-bedroom residence has three bathrooms and spans about 1,700 square feet. Strong listed it for sale in May.\n\nBy the Numbers:\nHomebuilder confidence is growing, but will it last?\nWhat does today\u2019s housing market have in common with May 2020 and August 2012?\nThe answer is a lackluster Housing Market Index of 37.\nThe HMI\u2019s October reading of 37 was five points higher than September\u2019s \u2014 a welcome boost from the previous four months of\npersistent readings in the low 30s\n. Still, the index is down six points annually, according to the data released earlier this month.\nThe long-running monthly index,\npublished by the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) and Wells Fargo\n, indicates how much confidence builders have in the single-family housing market as measured on a scale of zero to 100. Anything below 50 means most builders have a glass-half-empty outlook.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "A Gilded Age mansion on the Upper East Side just traded for a steep discount.\nAn entity tied to hedge fund manager Joseph DiMenna sold the historic townhouse at 10 East 67th Street for $36 million, down significantly from its initial asking price of $50 million, according to public records.\nThe buyer, whose identity is shielded by an LLC, paid roughly $2,800 per square foot for the seven-story home, known as the Jules Bache Mansion. It has seven bedrooms and 10 bathrooms and features an elevator, garden and 1,700-square-foot rooftop deck.\nDiMenna and his now ex-wife, producer Diana, bought the sprawling 13,000-square-foot abode in 2006 for $28.5 million from Jeanne Andlinger, the wife of the late investment banker Gerhard Andlinger. Andlinger appears to have inherited the home in 2003 from the estate of the late art collector and socialite Catarina \u201cKitty\u201d Meyer.\nMeyer died at the home in 1997 after an electrical fire blazed through it in the early hours of the morning and trapped her and her guest, actress and socialite Zohra Lahrizi Zondler, on a balcony on the fifth floor, the\nNew York Times\nreported at the time.\n\nAfter the fire broke out, Meyer ran upstairs to rescue Zondler, but the two women weren\u2019t able to get back downstairs. Both Meyer and Zondler died after jumping from the balcony.\nThe home was gut-renovated after the fire, including a new chef\u2019s kitchen and solarium, according to\nMansion Global\n. The architect, Peter Marino, maintained the original staircase and portions of the formal dining room.\nThe DiMennas listed the property last February, three months before the couple filed for divorce in New York. The home hit the market with a $50 million asking price, though it later dropped to $45 million when Ryan Serhant and Serhant\u2019s Melissa Post took over the listing from Douglas Elliman earlier this year.\nThe deal follows a string of contract signings for notable Upper East Side mansions, including Bill Cosby\u2019s 13,000-square-foot home at\n18 East 71st Street\n, asking $29 million. The disgraced actor landed an inked deal for his townhouse earlier this month as the property faced foreclosure.\nBarbara Streisand also found a buyer for her home at\n49 East 80th Street\nin August. The eight-bedroom townhouse last asked $16 million.\n",

The industrial condos will rise at the southeast corner of Glendale Avenue and New River Road.\nMangat Group previously planned to build a luxury\nstorage facility\nat the site named MG Storage Condos; that property would have housed luxury vehicles like boats,\nrecreational vehicles\nand classic cars. Mangat has since abandoned those plans.\nThe new development will purportedly better meet the needs of the local market, company founder Tony Mangat told the Business Journal. It will be located on an 8.5-acre site that\u2019s part of 17 acres Mangat owns. The project is making its way through the\ndesign review process\nnow.\nThe site will include 36 units in five buildings totaling more than 84,000 square feet. Interested buyers can purchase units at pre-sale now with options ranging from $325 to $350 per square foot. Owners can opt for either shell delivery or spec offices catering to industries like manufacturing, warehousing and distribution.\n\nThe industrial condos are designed with small to midsize businesses in mind. Units at MG Business Park units are listed for sale by Brett Ranta and Jordan Tennant with Scottsdale-based Orion Investment Real Estate.\nMangat\u2019s adjacent 9 acres could also be developed at some point in the future, though details on what that could be remain light.\nConstruction is slated to begin at the end of March with the industrial condos expected to be available by the end of next year.\nIn total, Mangat Group owns about 1,000 acres in Greater Phoenix. Besides the MG Business Park, Mangat also plans to build a sports complex in Glendale with soccer and field hockey facilities; that project is in its early stages.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The 28,800-square-foot property is home to Chanel, Moncler, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels and Le Colonial, and represents one of the premier trophy assets on the city\u2019s Gold Coast shopping corridor, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nUnion paid $120 million for the property in 2021 \u2014 the highest price for a Chicago retail building since 2016 \u2014 marking one of the most expensive single-asset retail deals of the past decade. The company declined to comment on why it\u2019s selling or what it expects to fetch, but the move could be an early test of investor appetite for high-end retail after two years of muted transaction activity driven by higher interest rates and economic uncertainty.\nThe offering is rare for Oak Street, where turnover is infrequent and tenants skew ultra-luxury. Recent trades include the roughly $17 million sale of a\nBottega Veneta\n\u2013leased property late last year and\nRazny Jewelers\u2019\n$16.4 million purchase of 107 East Oak in February.\nBuilt in 2018, Union\u2019s property is among the newest on the street and one of its few modern multi-tenant buildings.\n\n\u201c65 East Oak epitomizes best-in-class construction, elite tenancy and stands as one of the most coveted luxury retail assets in the nation,\u201d Newmark Senior Managing Director Keely\nPolczynski\ntold the outlet. She is marketing the listing.\nPolczynski described Oak Street as among the top five highest-rent retail corridors across the country, often compared to Fifth Avenue in New York and Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills.\nOak Street has bucked broader retail trends in recent years. While other downtown Chicago corridors \u2014 including the Magnificent Mile \u2014 continue to grapple with vacancies and rent stagnation, Oak Street remains near full occupancy. It\u2019s also lured a new wave of tenants such as\nFrench handbag brand Pol\u00e8ne\nand Lugano Diamonds, which both opened boutiques there in the past year.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

A lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court alleges that an affiliate of\nLos Angeles-based CIM Group\ndefaulted on a $61.5 million loan backed by the property after failing to make its monthly payments since the beginning of August.\nThe loan was placed into special servicing in July. Yelp\u2019s lease of the entire 136,432-square-foot building was set to expire that month.\nAt the time, commercial mortgage-backed securities bondholders learned that \u201cimminent default\u201d was the reason for the loan transfer to a special servicer. Earlier this month, notes confirmed the servicer is gathering information about the building while figuring out \u201cworkout strategies deemed appropriate to achieve the highest net present value recovery.\u201d\n\nIf lenders are successful in the\nforeclosure seizure\n, they could sell the building and use the proceeds to recover some or all of the delinquent $61.5 million loan.\nYelp has been a tenant at 55 Hawthorne since 2014 and has been subleasing out some of its space in the building since before the pandemic. After COVID hit, the company listed its entire footprint at 55 Hawthorne for sublease. Over the past decade,\nYelp subleased its space\nto companies like NerdWallet and Motive, though notes sent to bondholders in July said most of the subtenants were expected to leave the building after Yelp\u2019s master lease expired July 31.\nCIM listed the property for sale\nin the spring of 2024, purportedly out of fear for the building\u2019s value once Yelp left, though no deal was ever signed. CIM acquired the property in 2016 for $123 million, or $900 per square foot; its listing price last year wasn\u2019t disclosed.

Southeastern Company is building a mid-rise apartment project on the grave of \u201c\nDisco Kroger\n,\u201d the Montrose grocery store where drag queens and partygoers would wrap up a night out, thanks to its 24-hour schedule and proximity to the neighborhood\u2019s LGBTQ bars and clubs. The iconic store was closed and demolished in 2021.\nWhether or not new development is blanching the funky soul of Houston, Fort Worth is counting on it to infuse life into\nPanther Island\n, a flood mitigation project decades in the making that\u2019s expected to create a vibrant mixed-use development on the Trinity River. The Tarrant Regional Water District is vetting developers for the land, over 30 acres of which can accommodate buildings. The Fort Worth City Council recently approved heightened density for the project, establishing minimum height requirements for 15 acres of the project.\nMeanwhile, unlikely neighbors\nSpaceX and Cards Against Humanity settled\na quirky tiff over a plot of land at the Texas-Mexico border. The irreverent card game maker claimed Elon Musk\u2019s company, located at nearby Starbase, dumped trash on the land it bought in protest of the border wall in 2017. The pair settled for undisclosed terms last month.\nUptown Dallas\nDallas has historically grown north. Lately, it\u2019s also been shrinking from the south. Local companies and out-of-state transplants alike have long favored Uptown, a neighborhood north of downtown known for its walkability and liveliness. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Deloitte are just a few of the firms with plans to ditch Downtown Dallas\u2019 blocky \u201980s high-rises in favor of Uptown\u2019s trails and trolley line.\nHowever, despite these indications of demand, Uptown office landlord\nHarwood International\nis struggling to stabilize assets in its namesake neighborhood, Harwood District.\nGabriel Barbier-Mueller\u2019s firm has\nquietly offloaded four office properties\nto San Francisco-based hedge fund TPG, the same firm that\u2019s supposedly financing Harwood\u2019s latest project, Harwood No. 15.\n\nNews of the trades come as Harwood faces its\nthird office foreclosure\nthis year. Harwood No. 1 at 2651 North Harwood Street, the company\u2019s first office development, is scheduled to be auctioned next month, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service. The $37.45 million debt on the building amounts to $355 per square foot.\nHarwood\u2019s issues are isolated to its 30-acre district. The Uptown office submarket still has some of the lowest vacancy rates and highest rental rates of the Dallas-Fort Worth office market.\nSpurs vs. Mavs\nThe San Antonio Spurs trounced the Dallas Mavericks this week, and they may win the race to a new arena to boot. But first they\u2019ll need the backing of voters.\nAs part of Project Marvel, the $4 billion redevelopment project aimed at transforming downtown San Antonio, local leaders plan to build a new arena for the Spurs. On Election Day, voters have the opportunity to weigh in on\ntwo ballot measures\nto fund the project.\nProposition A would authorize the county to collect $192 million for the redevelopment of Frost Bank Center and Freeman Coliseum into a stock show and rodeo district. If Proposition B passes, the county can collect $311 million for the new arena.\nPolls show\nmiddling support for the measures\na few weeks before the election. A survey from the University of Texas at San Antonio\u2019s Center for Public Opinion Research\u00a0 found that 44 percent of voters back Proposition A, and nearly 40 percent support Proposition B.\nCritics of Project Marvel, including\nnewly elected Mayor Gina Ortiz\n, want to make sure the Spurs foot enough of the bill. Beyond the venue tax, the city plans to chip in $489 million, and the Spurs plan to contribute $500 million.\nMeanwhile, the Mavs announced earlier this year that they\u2019d like to get out of the house that Dirk built. American Airlines Center is the last professional sports venue in Dallas proper, and the prospect of losing the team to a suburb like Irving or Frisco is rankling some locals. The city has teased a different centrally located site: City Hall, a brutalist landmark designed by I.M. Pei and made famous in Robocop. The aging building has racked up a costly bill of deferred maintenance, and the\nCity of Dallas is considering selling it\nand redeveloping it into a new arena.\n",

        "content": "Fame, but no fortune?\nI recently wrote about two pieces of real estate that once upon a time each had a moment in the sun: A beachfront mixed-use property that was home to Snapchat and synonymous with the social media company\u2019s rise, and an apartment building that was featured on the Eagles\u2019 Hotel California album back cover.\nThe former\nsold\n, but for less than its prior purchase price and only after a struggle to lease it.\nThe latter is now scheduled for a\nforeclosure auction\n, with San Francisco multifamily stalwart Neveo Mosser and his Mosser Capital owing $29.4 million. A notice of default went out before an auction for the apartments at 6500 Yucca Street was scheduled for October 28.\nMaybe it wasn\u2019t such a lovely place after all \u2014 the refrain from the Eagles\u2019 title track notwithstanding \u2014 or maybe the pending auction says more about Mosser\u2019s troubles.\nMosser Companies early last year, defaulted on an $88 million loan tied to 12 apartment buildings throughout San Francisco.\nOh, Snap!\nMeanwhile, the pair of three-story oceanfront buildings in Venice, home to Snapchat when it was headquartered in the Silicon Beach neighborhood, sold for $30.7 million. The 10 live-work lofts and ground-floor retail at 619 and 701 Ocean Front Walk were purchased by Stefan Ashkenazy, who owns the Petit Ermitage, a boutique hotel in West Hollywood.\nThe seller, DLJ Real Estate Capital Partners, purchased the property for $40.5 million in 2014. When Snapchat consolidated its Silicon Beach office footprint in Santa Monica, it left a glut in the office market of funky Venice.\nLaeroc won\u2019t lay down\nLaeroc Partners isn\u2019t going down without a fight.\nCathay Bank\nsued\nthe company, claiming it defaulted on a $31 million loan. The lender requested a foreclosure on the loan, and that a receiver be appointed for the office and data-center property at 530 West 6th Street.\nLaeroc Partners not only denied all allegations but asked that the complaint be dismissed with prejudice, with Cathay Bank covering all legal costs.\n\nThe court documents were signed by Kim Benjamin, president of Laeroc Partners.\nAttorneys representing Cathay Bank and Laeroc Partners did not respond to a request for comment.\nHello, BANC\nIn more downtown news, Banc of California,\ninked\nan 11-year lease for 40,000 square feet at 865 South Figueroa Street \u2014 and now its name will loom 35 stories over the cityscape, thanks to the naming rights that came with the deal.\nSo say goodbye to the TCW logo, and try not to call it the TCW Tower because the asset management company left two years ago.\nAnd please know that I know that not every naming deal lives up to its name \u2014 this is the same Banc of California that\nsigned\na $100 million pact to put its name on the Los Angeles Football Club stadium in Exposition Park but pulled out of the deal four years later.\nEY Plaza, again\nIn the last column, I relayed that EY Plaza had taken another\nvalue haircut\n, this time by a relatively small 10 percent to $135 million. Prior cuts have been steeper, after all, from a highwater valuation of $446 million before the pandemic took full hold.\nNow it\u2019s getting around time to see if the cuts will come on the $275 million note connected to the distressed office tower that Colliers plans to peddle at a discount.\nColliers said it \u201cwill be calling for offers on Tuesday, October 28,\u201d declining to share any further information on whether the brokerage has seen any interest thus far.\nIf you aren\u2019t up to speed on all things EY Plaza, here\u2019s a catch-up in 10 seconds or less: It\u2019s a 41-story office building at 725 South Figueroa that was owned by Brookfield before the company ceded control to a receiver after defaulting on hundreds of millions of commercial mortgage-backed securities debt. One deal for the tower has fallen through.\n",

        "content": "The Bay Area might be home of the Smeeze, and this might be the season for the Monster Mash, but San Francisco saw major higher education players this week bring their own, surprising moves to the dance floor.\nThe Wharton School of Business, the Philadelphia-based wing of the University of Pennsylvania that educated President Donald Trump, is now renting from him. Wharton is shuffling its San Francisco campus into the city\u2019s Financial District, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The Ivy League school\u2019s masters of business administration program has held a presence in San Francisco for 25 years, and\nplans to begin its next chapter at 345 Montgomery St, in a building known as The Cube\n.\nThe striking, 80,000-square-foot building is part of the larger Bank of America Center, which is owned by Vornado Realty Trust and the Trump Organization, according to the Chronicle. As part of the shuffle, Wharton plans to vacate its current campus at 2 Harrison St., where it shares a building with Google.\nA mile south, the tango between San Francisco and Vanderbilt University appears to be heating up. The Chronicle last week reported that the dons of the Nashville-based school\nhave set their sights on Fifth and Mission\n, home of the newspaper\u2019s own headquarters and the 5M mixed-use development.\nSan Francisco civic leaders have long discussed resuscitating the city\u2019s downtown from its pandemic pains with an increased presence of higher learning institutions\u2013but they can\u2019t count on the homegrown Academy of Art University to follow the same beat.\nThe private, for-profit university is\nreportedly looking to sell off 10 of its properties in the city\u2019s urban core\n.\nEven if you take higher education out of the mix, the city\u2019s real estate markets have enjoyed a recent surge thanks to artificial intelligence, which has\nrents a\u2019soaring\nand\noffices a\u2019leasing\n.\nThe hi-tech rush for the office sector has largely been a flight to quality, however, boosting Class A office buildings but leaving questions for some of the city\u2019s older stock.\nThe Newhall Building stands as a severe example. Built in 1908, the 12-story, Lewis Parsons Hobart-designed building at 260 California Street, was appraised in 2015 at $32 million. Today, it\u2019s worth $13 million,\na 60% drop in value\n.\n\nThe property owner, Swift Realty Partners, owes about $17 million on the loan it took out to purchase the building a decade ago. The address recently lost Google as a tenant, despite the tech giant signing onto major leases elsewhere in the city. And Citibank, another of the building\u2019s major tenants, will vacate the space early next year as it prepares to occupy a shiny new space in the Financial District.\nOlder office buildings bottoming out in value has the potential to bring pain upon lenders and landlords alike. But it may also bring a rare opportunity, according to the authors of a report published last month.\nLed by the Milan-based architecture firm OBR,\n\u201cRevitalizing Downtown San Francisco Through Architecture\u201d\nis a collaborative, multinational effort between design and real estate firms San Francisco and Italy that hits upon an oft-mused topic in urban planning: adaptive re-use.\nBrett Terpeluk and Valerie Beauchamp, of the participating Studio Terpeluk, argue that landowners have \u201cnot yet felt the full impact of the staggering 37% commercial vacancy rate,\u201d and that the only clear response is to convert offices into housing.\nAdaptive reuse has been long-discussed but rarely pursued due to complexity and cost of making offices suitable for living. However, Terpeluk argues the pandemic\u2019s paradigm shift for office space offers the perfect opportunity.\n\u201cIt is time to re-examine the enormous potential of infrastructural reuse, from environmental, urban, and economic perspectives,\u201d the authors write. \u201cWe are at a pivotal moment of change.\u201d\nOver in Oakland, the reality of San Francisco\u2019s residential surge has caught the attention of one major East Bay developer. Signature Development founder Michael Ghielmetti has been at work on the Brooklyn Basin since 2001, breaking ground in 2014, and delivering roughly 1,700 housing units along Oakland\u2019s waterfront since then.\nHe told The Real Deal that he is transitioning the 371-unit Caspian apartment building into condos, ranging from $349,000 to $799,000.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing San Francisco really coming out hot, and I think it\u2019s six to 12 months ahead of Oakland, because that\u2019s typically been the pattern,\u201d Ghielmetti said. \u201cTypically San Francisco gets to price points that are more challenging, whether you\u2019re an office tenant or \u2026 a residential renter, and you start to get priced out. And then you have choices, where do you go? Marin County isn\u2019t cheaper. The Peninsula is not cheaper. So, historically, people have come to the East Bay.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s rise to the top of the multifamily market is dominating the metro\u2019s real estate narratives.\nHere\u2019s a chapter on the risks of running hot, which include political ramifications as demand overwhelms a diminished pipeline of supply and sends rents skyrocketing.\nChicago\u2019s job base is stabilizing, migration is rebounding and\ntenants are paying up\nfor quality units. A key constraint, however, is self-inflicted: a mix of political paralysis, fiscal unpredictability and residents who protest density but complain about rent hikes.\nThat combination is\nexporting capital to collar counties\nand locking out the very housing the city needs most.\nAll politics are local, it\u2019s often said, but the mixed bag of the Chicago metro\u2019s multifamily market could go beyond how the legion of renters vote in elections for city councils that control zoning decisions, enough to become a factor in the March primary race for assessor.\nThat\u2019s a battle that already has the real estate industry paying attention, for obvious reasons and then some.\nIncumbent\nAssessor Fritz Kaegi\nis fielding a challenge from\nPatrick Hynes\n, who\u2019s garnering financial support from some big business players \u2014 with a $25,000 donation from Michael Sacks of massive asset manager\nGCM Grosvenor\nleading the way, public records show.\nReal estate power figures have followed suit: Hynes took in a $10,000 donation from\nDavid Carlins of developer Magellan\nand four-figure sums from developer\nJohn O\u2019Donnell\n, investor and commercial window magnate\nRodrigo d\u2019Escoto\nand landlord\nStuart Handler\u2019s firm TLC Management\n. Bill Silverstein of Beal Properties, who bought a\nLincoln Park property for $36 million this month\n, also chipped in $2,500 for Hynes.\nKaegi has earned the enmity of real estate interests over his penchant for steep hikes on commercial property assessments. Although he took in $5,000 earlier this year from Bulls and White Sox owner\nJerry Reinsdorf\n, a real estate legend aside from his sports interests, the incumbent\u2019s campaign war chest has largely been self-funded over his past two election victories.\n\nThe multifamily segment of the market could constitute a separate front in the assessor\u2019s race.\nThe Chicago region now leads the nation in rent growth, a milestone fueled by a yearslong supply drought that\u2019s turning existing buildings into cash machines.\nInvestors say the market\u2019s strength masks a structural problem: an\nanti-development culture\nand political dysfunction that\u2019s keeping new supply off the board and the\ncosts of property taxes uncertain\ninside the urban core.\nThe result is a push by investors deeper into the suburbs, where property values are rising more reliably and taxes are more predictable than in Chicago. The Cook County assessor\u2019s race could easily center around this theme \u2014 and it could cut any number of ways.\nHynes has\nhammered Kaegi for jacking up assessments\non large commercial properties. Meanwhile, landlords within Chicago\u2019s city limits have to consider the suburbs as both a competitor and an option \u2014 Hander, for instance, has recently traded out Hyde Park assets in favor of buying bigger multifamily assets in the suburbs.\nThen take the\n$181 million that a pair of Aurora apartment deals\njust fetched. Sellers in both of those appeared to do well with the transactions, as their buyers Vistria Group, Standard Communities and DRA Advisors paid top dollar in a bet on steady rent growth and fewer political surprises. It\u2019s more varied in Chicago proper, though. Locally based\nOrigin Investments took a loss on its $63 million sale\nof a West Loop asset it purchased for nearly $66 million in March 2020. Meanwhile, developer\nMatt Katsaros\u2019 firm Wildwood\nscored a gain with a $40 million sale in Lakeview to Utah-based Highland Partners.\nSome developers are hedging their bets. Fulton Street Cos., best known for Fulton Market projects, is\ntaking its first swing\nin the suburbs.\nThe logic is simple: even modest infill projects face gauntlets of neighborhood pushback and aldermanic vetoes. Every\nblocked building\ntightens the market, further enriching existing owners while exacerbating the affordability squeeze.\nMeanwhile, in Cook County, the political theater continues. Kaegi\u2019s progressive crusade against commercial landlords \u2014 marketed as tax \u201cfairness\u201d \u2014 has instead produced chaos. Assessments swing wildly year to year, partly due to successful appeals by landlords to the county\u2019s\nBoard of Review\n. Nonetheless, the system deters investment and erodes underwriting confidence. Kaegi\u2019s race with Hynes could be construed by some as a referendum on whether Chicago even wants new housing.\nDespite the dysfunction, investor interest keeps flowing in. Highland Partners\u2019 Ben Frazer told\nTRD\nhis firm \u201cloves the Chicago market,\u201d praising strong job growth and demand. LRE Management\u2019s Eric Londa, who bought Origin\u2019s West Loop asset, said his New York-based firm is \u201ccomfortable with the uncertainty\u201d \u2014 a clue about how far risk premiums have stretched.",

        "content": "The Miami mayor\u2019s race is a muddled mess.\nEarly voting is in full swing for Miami\u2019s\nNov. 4 election\n, and 13 candidates are sprinting across the city to drum up support in one of the most wide-open races in more than decade.\nThe contenders feature seven relative newcomers to Miami\u2019s political scene, and six veterans of the city\u2019s cutthroat election cycles. Major players in the real estate industry are primarily lining up behind Miami city commissioner Joe Carollo and Miami-Dade County commissioner Eileen Higgins. But a few prominent developers and investors are throwing their support to ex-Miami City Manager Emilio Gonzalez, ex-Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez and former city commissioners Ken Russell and Alex Diaz de la Portilla.\nYet, Carollo, Higgins, Gonzalez, Suarez, Russell and Diaz de la Portilla have not proffered any groundbreaking initiatives on the real estate front, aside from the usual promises to increase affordable and workforce housing in a city that ranks high in terms of home prices and rental rates.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of each of their track records and positions on major real estate issues:\nHiggins, whose county commission district includes downtown Miami, Brickell and Little Havana, is resigning her seat to run for mayor. She enjoys support from a formidable swath of developers whose projects she\u2019s championed in her district, taking credit for 7,000 completed or planned affordable and workforce housing units in her district. Projects Higgins has touted include Magnus Brickell, a 465-unit mixed-income apartment building developed by the Related Group. She successfully passed legislation to speed up construction of seawalls and bulkheads on private properties, by requiring permits to be reviewed and issued within 90 days, expanding administrative approvals and providing incentives for property owners and developers who use nature-based alternatives such as mangroves.\nDespite receiving financial support from prominent real estate developers and investors, Carollo has also had run-ins with the industry. In 2022, he supported a proposal to eliminate a city incentive for projects near transit stations and stops to reduce on-site parking requirements. At the time, Carollo told the Miami Herald that the parking breaks were only beneficial to developers looking to maximize their profits. The proposal ultimately went nowhere. A year later, a Miami federal jury hit Carollo with a $63 million verdict after finding him guilty of violating the civil rights of Little Havana developers Bill Fuller and Martin Pinilla by orchestrating a code enforcement crackdown on their properties and businesses.\nGonzalez, who was city manager from 2018 to 2020, successfully sued the city to restore the November election after the Miami City Commission voted to postpone it until next year. Gonzalez has built a formidable campaign war chest despite having little support from well-known real estate titans. Still, his Mission Miami political action committee scored $20,000 in contributions from entities tied to Little Havana developers\u00a0 Bill Fuller and Martin Pinilla. A MAGA-aligned Republican who has won Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 endorsement, Gonzalez is following the governor\u2019s lead by promising to eliminate real estate property taxes on homesteaded properties.\nRussell resigned his District 2 Miami City Commission seat in 2022 after his second unsuccessful run for Congress. During his time in office, Russell was repeatedly the odd man out, as his colleagues often rejected his legislative initiatives, including his attempt to revamp Coconut Grove\u2019s city code to curtail teardowns of old homes by developers.\nSuarez, whose last win for the mayor\u2019s seat in 1997 was overturned due to voter fraud, is mounting a longshot comeback bid after a stint as county commissioner from 2011 to 2020. Aside from pointing to affordable housing projects built during his tenure at the county, Suarez backs a proposal to increase tax breaks for homesteaded properties in Miami.

Diaz de la Portilla\u2019s time on the city commission was cut short in 2023 when he was criminally charged for money laundering and bribery. The charges stemmed from contributions tied to the Centners, allegedly provided in exchange for his steering a no-bid deal for a city park to a trust managed by the couple. The Centners were not targets of the probe, and last year state prosecutors dropped the case against Diaz de la Portilla.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill\n3-D printed homes\nbecome common in South Florida?

        "content": "Social media dragged the buyer of multiple\nMalibu lots\nthrough the mud after the deals were first reported back in August.\nCatcalls over the would-be builder\u2019s bulk buys, and mistaken presumptions of the\nethnicity\n, wasn\u2019t the response El Segundo-based\nZuru Tech US\n, expected.\n\u201cI think what the general public doesn\u2019t understand is the difficulties in going from an empty lot to a livable house,\u201d Zuru Tech U.S. operations director Marcel Fontijn said. \u201cRebuilding is not for everyone.\u201d\nDesign times, selecting contractors, permit pulls and then the actual construction has led some residents in the fire-impacted areas to\nsell\n.\nFor Zuru Tech, the lots they grabbed up \u2014 15 at last count \u2014 will make for nice case studies for its technology. The company, founded by brothers Nick and Mat Mowbray, makes design and manufacturing software that\u2019s used to power robotic factories owned by its parent Zuru Group of Hong Kong.\nAfter a bit of phone tag with Fontijn,\nThe Real Deal\nsnagged time with the executive to find out more about the company\u2019s lot purchases as part of a broader story on the state of the rebuilding (stay tuned for the November issue of\nTRD\n\u2019s magazine).\n\u201cFor us, we have a research project that focuses on factory-built homes, and we saw an opportunity,\u201d Fontijn said. \u201cIf you imagine there being rebuilding efforts on 300 houses that burned down in terms of how many contractors, how many framers [and] how many roofers, where are you going to pack all these people? And that\u2019s where we really saw that we can provide a solution to a problem.\u201d\nZuru Tech\u2019s homes take between two to three months to install, with the company estimating work on the first of those structures to begin a year from now.\nFuzzy on the numbers\nData sets can always be picked apart.\nThat doesn\u2019t help if you\u2019re an agent in the burn areas looking for market comparables. That was made more challenging when, immediately following the fires, some lot sales were being entered into the Multiple Listing Service as standing, single-family homes. Chalk some of that up to certain software that didn\u2019t upload land contracts. It made for skewed stats in the beginning, but that\u2019s since been ironed out, according to Compass Altadena broker Teresa Fuller.\nFuller told\nTRD\nrecently MLS fines cracked down on the problem, making for improved numbers for those such as herself closely tracking the market.\nLast year, over 350 homes were sold in Altadena. This year, there have been 69, Fuller said. Prices per square foot for standing structures dropped to as low as $738 a foot in May, and have since risen to $771.\n\u201cIt\u2019s much more hopeful. We\u2019re seeing housing starts if you drive around Altadena now,\u201d Fuller said. \u201cYou see framing going up. Not a lot, but some. And I think as people are more and more comfortable with what\u2019s being rebuilt, and people begin to trust more that Altadena will once again be the gorgeous mountain town that it was, prices will go back up.\u201d\n\nMore from the interview with Fuller will appear in the November issue of the magazine.\nMissed deadline\nAfter an Oct. 2 deadline to clear fire debris came and went, a Palisades mansion featured in HBO\u2019s \u201cSuccession\u201d, and seven other properties were deemed\npublic nuisances\n.\nThe properties include single-family homes, apartments and commercial real estate, per a report from the\nLos Angeles Times\n.\nIf the property owners can\u2019t get rid of the toxic rubble, the city will step in to handle the cleanup. The owners, however, will have to pay up for the service.\nNew record\nIt\u2019s been a while since the San Diego County residential market turned heads.\nThis past week, the Del Mar home at\n2920 Camino Del Mar\ntraded for $50 million to make for the county\u2019s priciest-ever sale.\nThat edges past a $47 million deal that closed this year, about 11 miles south of Del Mar in San Diego\u2019s La Jolla neighborhood.\nFalling apart\nSometimes you just have to walk away. At least, that\u2019s what an increasing number of homebuyers are doing.\nAugust saw the highest share ever, or 15.1 percent, of signed contracts nationally falling out of escrow, according to\nRedfin data\n. The company\u2019s data goes back to 2017.\nFor Los Angeles, specifically, 14.9 percent of sales fell out of contract in August, which is down from 15 percent in the year-ago period.\nThe biggest stated reason for buyers saying good-bye: inspection or repair issues.\n",

        "content": "Baird &amp; Warner is launching an initiative to bring more cohesion and tools to its Chicago-based agents as it seeks to stand out in a market against growing consolidation and national brands.\nThe brokerage with strong suburban footholds nearly doubled its agent count in the city of Chicago\nwhen it acquired Dream Town\nearlier this year, it said in a press release. The new initiative, called the \u201cCity Collective,\u201d will help unite its 800 city agents and give them new communications lines, tools and technology to compete, the company said.\nMost of Baird &amp; Warner\u2019s volume currently stems from outside the city proper: About 65 percent of the sales volume between Baird &amp; Warner and Dream Town year-to-date happened in the suburbs and outside Chicago, according to data provided by a spokesperson.\nThe focus on ramping up sales in the city will help Baird &amp; Warner\u2019s operations across the board, according to an interview with David Bailey, Baird &amp; Warner\u2019s senior vice president and general sales manager. Migration between the city and suburbs is a large factor in the market, and having a bigger focus on the city can help the firm capture more of the market, he told\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\u201cHistorically, we\u2019ve been able to serve the entire Chicagoland community very effectively,\u201d he said. \u201cThe relationships between our suburban brokers and our city brokers are only going to get deeper now.\u201d\nBaird &amp; Warner, which has had a Chicago presence for 170 years, also used the initiative to take shots at its biggest competitor, Compass, which acquired homegrown @properties last year to become the largest Chicago brokerage by far. Compass also intends to take over\nAnywhere Real Estate\n, which would bring several more of Chicago\u2019s top brokerages under Compass\u2019s umbrella.\nBaird &amp; Warner is the largest independent brokerage in Chicago, and combined with Dream Town\u2019s performance would have came in second in\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nrankings of top brokerages\nby Cook County sales volume in 2024, after the combined volume of Compass and @properties.\nBaird &amp; Warner framed the initiative as a way to make the independent firm stand out against \u201cWall Street-run firms,\u201d and the press release criticizes Compass specifically. It\u2019s the second time in recent weeks the local firm has\ndirectly bashed the national giant\nin public communications materials.\n\nBailey said private exclusive networks like Compass\u2019 marketing models are bad for consumers, noting Baird is a transparent alternative. Compass has\npushed for a marketing strategy\nin which some properties start out marketed internally only to other Compass agents.\n\u201cIt\u2019s being veiled in innovation and some impressive new marketing approach, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about that. I think it\u2019s just about control,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re not looking to serve the consumer, they\u2019re looking to get both sides of the deal.\u201d\nCompass has defended its private marketing strategy as an option that gives sellers more choice in how to market their homes. In a statement, Compass spokesperson Devin Daly said the firm \u201cthinks homeowners should be able to choose the best strategy for selling their homes.\u201d He pointed to Compass research that found pre-marketed homes brought in higher closing prices and sold faster after hitting public networks.\nCompass has made its own technology suite a cornerstone of its sales pitch to brokers, including a tool announced this week that it says will help listing agents find potential buyers in the Compass network based on buyer activity and search data.\nBaird &amp; Warner didn\u2019t give specific details about the new tools coming for its agents under the City Collective program. Its press release noted new technology and AI tools, new internal communication tools and listing and marketing strategies. The company also said the initiative would give agents updates on local regulations, neighborhood trends and conduct regular meetings across its city brokerages.\nBailey said the suite of tools would include \u201cadditional enhanced marketing opportunities\u201d and a tech stack, and that they would be released over the rest of this year and early 2026. He said the tools will combine the data and AI expertise of Baird &amp; Warner with the marketing and technology tools of Dream Town into a more cohesive product.\n\u201cCombining those two together is what\u2019s going to allow us to take a big step forward,\u201d he said.\n",

After expansions in the 19th century, Charles Edison, the former governor of New Jersey and son of Thomas Edison, purchased the home 1948 and commenced on a major restoration.\nThe seven-bedroom, four-bathroom property is also notably home to Sag Harbor\u2019s only formal ballroom according to the property listing.\n\u201cWe love old stuff,\u201d Glaser said of being drawn to the historic home, which he said he\u2019ll leave basically untouched.\n\nHe and his wife, interior designer Kim Aimee Glaser, have been on the hunt for a new place to call home after selling their Nantucket house two years ago. The couple picked up a waterfront Newport Beach house for $9 million last year, which Glaser, who spent nearly two decades in Nantucket, said wasn\u2019t the right fit.\n\u201cThe bottom line is my wife, this is her dream house,\u201d he said.\nCorcoran\u2019s Susan Breitenbach\nhad the listing.\nGlaser, who made a name for himself with\naudacious spec developments in Miami and Palm Beach\n, said in 2024 he had shifted his focus to\nrenovations over building from scratch\n\u2014 something he said he\u2019ll look to continue in the Hamptons.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to start looking for some stuff to renovate, not to build,\u201d he said of tapping into the Hamptons market. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to manage stuff in the Hamptons, and the big builders are building new stuff. So there\u2019s a little pocket that I think I can sneak in.\u201d\nThe Sag Harbor purchase looks quaint in comparison in comparison to the price tag on one of Glaser\u2019s current projects in Florida. He and his partners bought a waterfront home on North Bay Road for $105 million earlier this year. Glaser currently has the home\nlisted as a flip for $169 million\n, but has said he is considering redeveloping the property into a $300 million spec home.",

        "content": "LuxUrban Hotels is facing liquidation, capping off its failed bid to build a boutique empire in New York.\nThe short-term hotel operator\u2019s Chapter 11 case was converted to Chapter 7 last week after federal officials accused company leadership of \u201cgross negligence\u201d and mismanagement, according to\nBisnow\n.\nThe move hands control of the firm to an independent trustee, marking a rare and rapid collapse for a company that\nonce claimed it could compete\nwith hospitality heavyweights like Marriott and Hilton.\nLuxUrban filed for bankruptcy last month after abruptly shuttering its leased hotels, including The Herald and The Tuscany in Manhattan, while\nstill accepting online reservations\nand payments. Guests reportedly showed up to locked doors and dark lobbies.\nAttorneys for the Office of the U.S. Trustee\npushed for a takeover\nof LuxUrban earlier this month, arguing the company posed ongoing risks to the public and its creditors. The court-appointed trustee, Kenneth Silverman, scheduled a December meeting with more than 400 creditors, who together are owed roughly $123.6 million.\n\nNearly $119 million of that stems from unpaid state taxes and penalties owed to New York\u2019s Department of Taxation and Finance. Silverman\u2019s initial filing said \u201cno property appears to be available to pay creditors.\u201d\nFormer chairperson Elan Blutinger, who resigned in December, filed a $214,000 claim for unpaid loans. Founder Brian Ferdinand and other executives remain defendants in a class-action fraud lawsuit brought by investors, which could now expand to include conduct revealed during the bankruptcy.\nLandlords have sued to evict LuxUrban from all four Manhattan buildings it leased, and at least one property \u2014\nThe Herald at 960 Sixth Avenue\n\u2014 has become the subject of a foreclosure suit. Lender Aareal Capital submitted photos of garbage-strewn hallways and leaking ceilings after LuxUrban abandoned the site, calling conditions unsafe for other tenants.\nLuxUrban\u2019s lawyers consented to the liquidation order, acknowledging there were \u201cno meaningful assets\u201d to recover.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The firm will occupy the entire 16th floor and part of the 17th floor.

The move marks an expansion for the firm, which was recently acquired by private equity giant KKR. The relocation brings FGS closer to its new parent company\u2019s headquarters\nin Hudson Yards\n.\nThis marks another win for Vornado\u2019s bet on the Penn District property, where a $750 million renovation was completed last year. The revamped tower features a new glass curtain wall, terraces and upgraded amenities aimed at attracting blue-chip tenants seeking high-end space near a major mass transit hub.\nCBRE\u2019s Michael Liss represented FGS Global in the deal. Vornado was represented in-house by Josh Glick and Jared Silverman, along with a Cushman &amp; Wakefield team led by Josh Kuriloff and Bruce Mosler.\nRepresentatives from Vornado and FGS Global did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe deal comes as the office market shows signs of stabilizing and Manhattan\u2019s Class A towers are quickly filling up. The Penn Station submarket\u2019s vacancy rate was about 19 percent at the end of the third quarter, compared with the borough\u2019s overall rate of 22 percent, according to a Cushman &amp; Wakefield report.\n\nThe lease adds to a string of recent deals at Penn 2, as tenants continue to gravitate toward newly renovated properties near mass transit. Verizon inked a\n200,000-square-foot lease\nlast summer with plans to move its headquarters to the 1.8 million-square-foot building, formerly known as 2 Penn Plaza.\nOther tenants include Madison Square Garden\u2019s corporate offices,\nMajor League Soccer\nand\nUniversal Music Group\n.\n\nFGS Global is taking 80,000 square feet at Vornado\u2019s Penn 2.

The totals marked the first time since early June that 30 or more properties landed inked deals in two consecutive weeks.\nA condo at Extell Development\u2019s Central Park Tower was the priciest home to snag a contract, with an asking price just under $55 million. The\n121st floor\nof 217 West 57th Street, which initially asked more than $65 million when sales launched in 2018, sold to a domestic buyer in an all-cash deal, sources told\nThe Real Deal.\nSources added that the full-floor unit will likely close at a price closer to a similar condo on the 116th floor, which was asking $53 million when it found a buyer. The apartment closed for $46 million in April, a discount of 13 percent.\nThe condo a few floors up has five bedrooms and five bathrooms.

The transfer took place \u201cafter missing several loan payments over the last few months,\u201d as disclosed by Morningstar Credit Analytics.\nRepresentatives for the two ownership entities did not comment to the publication, only adding to the mystery of why the loan is in special servicing for a second time. Local eyes and ears have seen little in the way of changes to business or consumer activity at the 270,000-square-foot shopping center, which is anchored by Whole Foods and Target.\nThe loan ended up in special servicing in late 2023 due to pandemic-induced retail tenant distress. Ownership ultimately agreed to a three-year extension on the $360 million mortgage.\nThis is just the latest blow to the Chetrits, particularly Meyer Chetrit. Last month, he was\nindicted\non criminal charges, accused of harassing older, rent-regulated tenants in Chelsea over five years. He pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nChetrit is facing several civil suits, including\naccusations that he is shielding assets to avoid paying a $132 million judgment\nto a lender.\nThe Chetrits are allegedly defaulting on nearly $2 billion worth of loans, according to court documents and ratings agencies, including $280 million they personally guaranteed.\nMeanwhile, Colorado-based multifamily real estate investment trust UDR and its partner, MetLife, are seeking up to $500 million in a sale of Columbus Square rental buildings. UDR bought the buildings at 775, 795, 805 and 808 Columbus Avenue, as well as 801 Amsterdam Avenue, in 2012 for $635 million from Stellar and Chetrit, which did not include the retail assets in the deal.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Chicago landlords are facing an unexpected new expense line item:\nfear\n.\nA wave of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids across the city and its suburbs has left tenants missing rent, contractors skipping work sites and property managers bracing for rising costs. The disruption adds strain to a market already short of more than 100,000 affordable units, according to some counts. Landlords estimate up to 40 percent of their contractors are now absent, while some tenants \u2014 including those with legal residency \u2014 are too afraid to leave home, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n.\nOwners say they\u2019ve been absorbing the\nfallout\nbut warn that if raids persist through spring moving season, rents could rise to offset the losses. Jeff Weinberg of Drexel Properties, with 1,100 units citywide, told the outlet that the enforcement drag \u201cis going to hurt renters at the bottom of the bottom rung the most.\u201d\nFor John Warren of Forte Properties, the shock came Oct. 7, when armed ICE agents appeared at one of his Cicero buildings. Warren oversees about 450 units across Latino-heavy suburbs like Berwyn and Cicero, and says since the raid, \u201cresidents are scared to open their doors.\u201d Maintenance staff are staying home, and tenants who miss work are falling behind on rent.\nOther operators told the outlet similar stories. Crews are refusing to show up at buildings where agents have been spotted. In one highly publicized\nSouth Shore raid\n, federal agents in military gear tore through an apartment complex on South Shore Drive, arresting 37 people, including U.S. citizens, according to the Department of Homeland Security. ICE said some detainees were suspected of gang or drug ties, but has not provided evidence.\n\nGene Lee of TLG Development, who owns 18 South Side apartments, said labor costs are up as longtime contractors disappear. Tracy Scanlon, who manages 1,000 North Side units, said maintenance delays have stretched to weeks, leaving units unrentable and costs mounting. Adding to that, landlords have\nlimited legal recourse\nregarding police and federal conduct within their buildings, even in common areas or a tenant\u2019s apartment.\n\u201cInefficiencies hurt our community and make housing more expensive to provide,\u201d Warren said. \u201cAmerica was built by immigrants. For us to be chasing the good guys is counterproductive.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Howard University could join other East Coast schools in setting up outposts in the Bay Area, though the \u201cBlack Ivy League\u201d university isn\u2019t looking in San Francisco.\nThe Washington, D.C.-based school, one of the prominent historically Black colleges and universities, is in early talks with Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee about establishing a satellite campus in the East Bay city, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n.\n\u201cWe have had preliminary discussions with Mayor Lee, but it is premature to discuss any real estate endeavors in this area at this time,\u201d a spokesperson for Howard told the Chronicle. Lee, a Howard alum, said in a statement that she has been \u201cleading discussions with Howard University and will continue to engage with them about exploring opportunities in Oakland.\u201d\nHoward representatives have reportedly already toured several downtown properties, including the largely vacant Trans Pacific Centre at 1000 Broadway. The school purportedly is eyeing 60,000 square feet at the tower, which would be about one full floor at the 375,000-square-foot building. The property is owned by Florida-based GCB Associates and lost major tenants like the Oakland Unified School District and Cal State East Bay. GCB previously proposed\nconverting the office tower to residential use\n.\nAcross the Bay, other universities with San Francisco satellites could breathe new life into emptied-out office buildings.\n\nThe Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania signed a long-term lease\nfor the entire 80,000-square-foot \u201cCube\u201d\nbuilding at 345 Montgomery Street, part of the 555 California Street complex owned by Vornado Realty Trust and the Trump Organization. The world-renowned business school is expected to move into the building in the next year and a half.\nNashville-based\nVanderbilt University\n, meanwhile, is\nnarrowing its search\nfor a place to plant a flag in San Francisco. The research university reportedly has its sights set on the forthcoming 5M Project mixed-use development in South of Market.\nIn downtown Oakland, local Samuel Merritt University will open its new $240 million campus at 525 12th Street come January. The school is relocating from its current home at 3100 Telegraph Avenue in Pill Hill.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The pause comes after residents complained about persistent noise from diesel generators and HVAC systems tied to existing data centers, the Daily Herald\nreported\n.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just trying to give us time to make sure that we have the proper guardrails in place,\u201d Mayor John Laesch told the outlet.\nIn Naperville, city officials are considering a similar step. Councilman Ian Holzhauer said the city should coordinate with peer communities to set consistent regional standards rather than \u201creinvent the wheel.\u201d The Naperville Environment and Sustainability Task Force has called for a six-month pause, warning that a proposed data center by developer\nKaris Critical\nwould consume more than 10 percent of the city\u2019s peak electricity demand.\nA flurry of data center moves in Aurora and across the Chicago area may account for the hesitancy. Five data centers have already gone up in\nAurora\n, with five more entitled and two new applications filed just before the moratorium took effect. Developers have clustered data centers in recent years near O\u2019Hare International Airport, especially in adjacent\nElk Grove Village\n, and an office tower in downtown Chicago recently sold to a Virginia company planning to convert it into a\n33-megawatt data center\n.\n\nKaris, which plans a 36-megawatt facility on 40 acres at the former Lucent campus, pushed back. Company spokesman Patrick Skarr said Naperville already retooled its zoning in 2023 to allow the city to impose conditions on data center projects. The developer pledged to offset 100 percent of its IT power load with renewable energy credits.\nAcross the region, the data center debate has become a test of how far suburbs are willing to go to accommodate energy-hungry infrastructure. Geneva Mayor Kevin Burns, who chairs the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus\u2019 energy committee, said that along with the revenue and capacity data centers bring, they also stress existing resources.\nAurora\u2019s temporary pause could be extended as officials weigh new zoning rules and long-term infrastructure costs. Developers such as CyrusOne, which operates in the city, say they\u2019re cooperating with local leaders to install sound walls and noise-mitigation systems.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Plano\u2019s political leadership has its sights set on\ncompanies in Northern Europe\n.\nRepresentatives from the corporate relocation powerhouse are visiting Sweden this week to check in with telecommunications company Ericsson and global access solutions manufacturer Assa Abloy, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. Both companies have their North American headquarters in Plano. Ericsson employs 3,300 people in the north Dallas suburb; Assa Abloy employs 200.\nPlano Mayor John Muns and City Manager Mark Israelson made the trip. Just this year, Plano representatives have also traveled to Toronto, Canada, and Paris, France, and last year Mayor Muns visited Taiwan, said Doug McDonald, Plano\u2019s director of economic development.\nThe Collin County suburb, long known for snagging corporate heavyweights like\nToyota\n, JPMorgan Chase and Liberty Mutual, continues to punch above its weight despite giving up a key funding tool. Plano sends one cent of every sales tax dollar to the Dallas Area Rapid Transit system, meaning less cash for economic development than its neighboring cities, which aren\u2019t part of DART.\nThat fiscal reality hasn\u2019t slowed growth, said Doug McDonald. He credits the time and resources spent building relationships with companies, he told the outlet.\n\nBoth\nAT&amp;T\nand the\nDallas Stars\nhave recently considered what Plano has to offer as each considers a Dallas exit.\nIt\u2019s a strategy that\u2019s worked for decades. Plano has managed to retain legacy employers while landing new ones drawn to its mix of Class A office space, transit access and quality-of-life amenities. The city\u2019s deliberate focus on cultivating long-term corporate relationships, rather than relying on deep incentive packages, has helped insulate it from the boom-and-bust cycles that often hit suburban office markets.\nLocal officials frame the city\u2019s approach as \u201chigh touch\u201d economic development. McDonald said Plano\u2019s team prioritizes ongoing engagement with executives \u2014 helping them navigate everything from workforce issues to permitting \u2014 to keep companies rooted even when market dynamics shift.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The increase would allow Related and BH to develop a high-rise consisting of a five-story parking podium and a 22-story tower with 90 units.\u00a0 That\u2019s an additional 17 stories above the zoning\u2019s allowance.\nA date is not yet set for the city\u2019s vote on the proposal.\nCoconut Grove-based Related, led by Jorge, Nick and Jon Paul P\u00e9rez, and Aventura-based BH, led by Isaac and Liat Toledano, paid $34 million for the parcel last year. The property is home to a medical office building that will be demolished.\nTo secure the city\u2019s approval for the extra height, Related and BH Group will pay the city $3.7 million for improvements to Currie Park, which is adjacent to the project site, and $1.1 million for the city\u2019s transit service program and mobility fund, documents the joint venture filed with the city show.\n\nThe joint venture declined to comment.\nRelated and BH are partnering on a pipeline of condominium and mixed-use projects in South Florida, including\nRitz-Carlton Residences\n, a 28-story tower with 144 condos at 1717 North Flagler Drive in West Palm Beach. The project broke ground last year, and units start at $2.5 million.\nThe frequent partners are also developing two waterfront projects in Broward County.

It will be near\nWaldorf Astoria Residences Pompano Beach\n, a 92-unit high-rise at 28 stories that Related is co-developing with Merrimac Ventures.\nIn Fort Lauderdale, the Related and BH joint venture, along with Pebb Enterprises, recently won administrative approval under Florida\u2019s Live Local Act for\nThe Quay\n, a 33-story mixed-use tower with 521 apartments, including 217 units set aside for affordable and workforce housing.

The NBA legend\npurchased a 1930s manse\nat the site in 2020 for $37 million and demolished it to make way for his new estate.\n\u201cKing James\u201d received approval to split the 2.7-acre property at 9955 Beverly Grove Drive into two separate parcels, according to new planning documents reviewed by\nRealtor.com\n. Both lots will get a house, connected by a shared driveway complete with a 200-square-foot private security guard house at the entrance. Additional security measures include an intricate alarm system and 10-foot-tall fencing around the perimeter of the two properties.\nThe larger of the two homes will span nearly 24,000 square feet, including 16,000 square feet across two stories as well as a 7,700-square-foot basement garage and pool. The ground floor will also have a two-level garage. Other amenities include an outdoor kitchen and solar panels to provide constant power to the property even in the event of a grid outage.\nThe second home will be a 6,550-square-foot, one-story structure. It will boast a theater, terrace, courtyard and wellness area featuring hot and cold plunge pools, as well as a ground-level garage with space for two cars.\n\nCrest Real Estate\nand architecture firm Walker Workshop are bringing the project to fruition. The latter has helped design luxury properties across the Los Angeles region.\nConstruction at the Beverly Hills compound began in 2023 after James secured planning approvals for the estate. A timeline for completion is unclear. The Los Angeles Lakers star is currently sharing the court with his son Bronny in what could be James senior\u2019s last season in the NBA before retirement.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time James knocked down a home to build something bigger and better. His home in Akron, Ohio, which he purchased at 18 years old in 2003 after being the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft, was leveled to make way for a mansion estimated to be worth more than $10 million. That property spans 30,000 square feet and has six bedrooms and 10 bathrooms plus a bowling alley, recording studio, barbershop and two-story closet.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A waterfront home in Lake Geneva sold for $8.7 million, becoming the latest high-end home to sell fast in the Wisconsin resort town.\nThe house was listed as \u201ccoming soon\u201d in the Milwaukee-area MLS in late August by Bob Webster of Compass. It officially hit the market Sept. 2 and went under contract the next day. The house sold for $15,000 over the asking price.\nThe 9,000 square-foot lakehouse at N2224 Bonnie Brae Lane was the latest to find a buyer lightning fast in the resort town, where public listings are slim and demand on the second home market is strong. It features five bedrooms and five-and-a-half bathrooms and sits on a 1-acre lot with 110 feet of beach frontage. David Curry, who represented the buyer, could not be reached for comment.\nWebster previously told\nThe Real Deal\nthat demand in the region is as higher than he\u2019s ever seen it, and he said he received huge interest in two recent listings.\n\u201cIf we see some other things coming on the market here between now and the end of the year, I would predict that we\u2019d see a similar quick response from the market with anything in that kind of a price range,\u201d Webster said\nHe\nhas another listing on South Lake Shore Drive\nin Lake Geneva that went under contract within a few days of listing at $9.8 million, and Webster expects it to close Oct. 31. Both were listed on the Milwaukee-area MLS using a delayed listing, which markets the property as \u201ccoming soon\u201d to other brokers and on some listing services before it officially goes on the market.\nSeveral houses priced higher than $5 million have gone on the market this year and\nfound buyers quickly in Lake Geneva\n. Last week, a 7,500 square-foot lakefront\nhouse on Bayview Drive\nsold about a month after hitting the market, after\ngoing under contract in six days\n, according to listing services. And in the last month, two more properties priced at $5 million and above found buyers in days: A $7.4 million house on Hillside Drive was listed Sept. 24 and went under contract Oct 2. Another lakefront house on Park Drive, listed for $6 million, hit the market Oct. 1 and found a buyer the same day.\n\nA few of those listings have also used the delayed listing strategy to market properties to brokers as \u201ccoming soon\u201d on the MLS before going public. It appears to be contributing to quick sales, as brokers have a few days to share the listings with clients before they start accruing days on market.\nThe pricey deals are driven largely by the low inventory on the lake as most owners are not interested in selling their valuable lakefront property, Webster said. But he noted that the speed of the deals and high value being commanded by recent listings may coax some sellers to come out of the woodwork.\n\u201cIf they had been considering whether this is the right year or the right season or the right time, based on their circumstances, when they see these properties coming out and selling quickly, they conclude that this should be a really good time for them to consider it as well,\u201d he said.\nAt the Bonnie Brae Lane property, Webster said the seller accepted the first offer that came in on the house. He said the buyer is from Illinois and purchased the property as a second home.\nThe new buyer has still not been disclosed. Public records list the previous owners as Thomas and Margaret Riordan.\n",

        "content": "Lori Loughlin and Mossimo Giannulli\nmay finally be able to call it quits on their Hidden Hills estate.\nThe home at 25210 Jim Bridger Road within the guard-gated community was last week\u2019s top home to go into contract with an asking price just under $15 million, or $1,266 per square foot, according to Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team. The\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n, compiled by the team\u2019s Marcy Roth, counts Los Angeles County homes listed for $4 million or more in the Multiple Listing Service.\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s Tomer Fridman and Douglas Elliman\u2019s Marc Shevin hold the listing.\nThe home first hit the market last spring, with a $17.5 million asking price, according to\nRobb Report\n. In February, the residence reappeared, asking $16.5 million before being reduced in July to the current listing price.\nThe home is located in Hidden Hills\u2019 Ashley Ridge Estates, which is home to celebrities such as Khloe Kardashian and Kris Jenner. Jennifer Lopez and Britney Spears also once had addresses in the upscale enclave named after the late developer\nMike Ashley\n, whose imprint remains on several Hidden Hills mansions.\nAcross the home\u2019s 11,808 square feet are six bedrooms and nine bathrooms. There\u2019s also a gym, home theater and wine cellar. Outdoors, on the over 1.5-acre lot, is a pool, bocce ball court and BBQ area.\nLoughlin\n, known for her role as Aunt Becky on \u201cFull House,\u201d and her fashion designer husband are reportedly separated after nearly three decades together. Their marriage was most recently tested with the 2019 college admissions scandal that led to prison time for both. The two pleaded guilty in 2020 to wire and mail fraud involving fraudulent admission of their two daughters into the University of Southern California. Loughlin served two months in prison, while Giannulli was sentenced to five months. Each was also fined and ordered to complete community service.\n\nTheir Hidden Hills home led the pack of signed contracts by a wide margin, with the property in the No. 2 spot held by 116 South Carmelina Avenue in Brentwood. That property is asking $9.3 million, or $1,238 per square foot.\nThe six-bed, eight-bath home sprawls across nearly 7,500 square feet and sits on a lot that\u2019s just over 9,000 square feet.\nThe home was meant for entertaining with a bar, wine cellar, screening room, pool and outdoor BBQ area.\nProperty records show the seller is a Virginia shell company called Tonbridge Road, which bought the home in 2019 for $6.9 million.\nBeverly Hills Estates\u2019 Rayni Williams and Branden Williams hold the listing.\nAcross Los Angeles County, the residential market has quieted some in recent weeks, with last week seeing 23 homes go into contract. That equated to nearly $142 million in asking volume, which was still robust relative to a year ago when total volume was 39 percent less, according to the Eklund Gomes report.\n",

        "content": "North Texas country clubs are reaping the benefits of the pandemic-era\ngolf boom\nand beefing up their amenities offerings.\nMember-owned country clubs\u2019 assets topped $431 million in Dallas-Fort Worth, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n, after reviewing IRS filings from thousands of clubs.\nThe area\u2019s top clubs are: Dallas Country Club, which recorded $128.4 million in assets in 2023; Brook Hollow Golf Club near Love Field with $59.7 million in assets; and Northwood Club in Far North Dallas at $57.9 million. Dallas Country Club also ranked second statewide by asset value and led Texas in revenue, pulling in $32 million last year \u2014 ninth-highest in the country.\nNationwide, member-owned country club assets jumped 27 percent from 2020 to 2023, from a median of $1.4 million to $1.8 million. The surge reflects both a pandemic-driven influx of new members and a costly \u201camenity arms race\u201d as clubs seek to stand out with lifestyle upgrades beyond the fairway.\nClubs that are leaning heavily into wellness and performance offerings are becoming the most successful, Mark Kovacs, a private club adviser, told the outlet. Kovacs pointed to an influx of health-focused additions \u2014 like cold plunges, infrared saunas and biometric tracking \u2014 as members demand facilities that cater to every generation.\n\u201cLuxury is shifting from material exclusivity to optimal health and time well spent,\u201d Kovacs said.\n\nThat shift is reshaping club campuses into full-blown retreats. Noah DiPasquale, founder of Arizona-based Epic Golf Club, said the\nnext wave\nwill be \u201cdestination clubs\u201d where members can spend an entire weekend without leaving the grounds.\nThe founders of coworking company Common Desk, Nick Clark and Dawson Williams, are\ndeveloping a new club in Lake Highlands\n. The club is supposed to include a 6,000-square-foot pool, a gym with yoga and pilates studios, spa features like a sauna and cold plunge, plus two restaurants.\nRising land values and water constraints will continue to present challenges, making it harder to develop new courses near major metros, while existing clubs face mounting pressure to justify ballooning dues. Membership costs for golf clubs grew 9 percent from 2022 to 2023 and another 5 percent through mid-2025, according to Club Benchmarking\u2019s Chris Davis.\nDespite predictions of a slight dip in total course numbers through 2027, analysts expect a rebound beginning in 2028 as the industry stabilizes.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Alex Sapir\u2019s Sapir Corp has filed for insolvency, saying it can no longer meet its bond payments or cover operating costs.\nThe Israeli company that owns the Nomo Soho hotel in Manhattan filed a petition in Tel Aviv-Jaffa District Court requesting to open insolvency proceedings and the appointment of a trustee to manage it. All the directors of the company have resigned, according to a filing with the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, which names Alex Sapir as the controlling shareholder.\nAs the company faces collapse, Sapir has lined up a buyer for its\ntroubled Soho hotel\n. Israeli hotel chain Dan Hotels is in contract to buy the Nomo Soho for $125 million, according to the filing. The deal, which still requires court and bondholder approval, would mark Dan Hotels\u2019 first step into the U.S. market following its recent international expansion in India, where it opened The Den hotel in Bangalore.\n\u201cIn coordination with our lenders, and following the successful sale of Sapir Corp\u2019s final asset \u2026 we have decided to exit the Israeli market,\u201d Sapir said in a statement. \u201cThis decision took into account many factors including negative hotel market headwinds, a high-interest rate environment and an increasingly strong shekel compared to the US dollar.\u201d\nDan Hotels plans to renovate the 264-key hotel at 9 Crosby Street following the purchase,\nThe Jerusalem Post\nreported. Eastdil Secured advised Sapir Corp in the deal.\nThe sale represents a long-awaited exit from a property that has faced a years-long debt struggle.\n\nSapir and partner Gerard Guez bought the Nomo Soho from Deutsche Bank for $208 million in 2015, following a foreclosure sale. Sapir later bought out Guez\u2019s 49 percent stake, taking nearly full ownership. Over the years, the hotel has undergone several refinancings \u2014 including a $115 million loan from Goldman Sachs in 2019.\nSapir refinanced the hotel in 2022 with an\n$89 million loan\nfrom the Israeli bond market, just in time to pay down the previous loan from\nGoldman Sachs\n.\nBut as an outstanding $34 million debt came due in 2024, Sapir requested to push it back in exchange for a $6 million partial payoff and an increased interest rate. In July, Sapir Corp failed to make a $3 million payment, putting the firm in default. Last year, the hotel\u2019s value dipped to $179 million.\nA sleek boutique hotel known for its vine-covered entrance and modern design, Nomo Soho struggled during the pandemic, when occupancy plummeted to just 1.9 percent in April 2020. To shore up finances, Sapir Corp put the hotel on the market last year and replaced its management company in February, cutting management fees in half.\nSapir Corp is one arm of Alex Sapir\u2019s real estate companies. The Nomo Soho appears to be is one of only two remaining assets held by Sapir Corp. The other is an undeveloped site near Miami\u2019s Wynwood area that the company recently re-listed for $41 million. That property is in sale discussions, according to the filing.\n",

        "content": "The saga to sell the Woolworth Mansion is finally coming to an end.\nThe townhouse at 4 East 80th, last asking\njust under $50 million\n, finally found a buyer, according to a Streeteasy listing. The pending deal comes roughly 14 years after the owners, the family of the late gym mogul Lucille Roberts, first sought to offload the home.\nThe 20,000-square-foot property\u2019s latest stint on the market began last November, when the Roberts family listed it for $59 million. They dropped the asking price by $10 million in March and started\nsearching for a tenant\nfive months later, asking $125,000 a month for the furnished home.\nThe family initially listed the mansion \u2014 built in 1915 for Helena Woolworth McCann, daughter of \u201cFive-and-Dime\u201d store magnate, Frank Woolworth \u2014 in 2011 for a whopping $90 million. They pulled the 35-foot-wide townhouse off the market two years later without a deal, and instead found a tenant in 2021 with a monthly rent of $80,000.\nRoberts and her husband, commercial real estate investor Bob Roberts, paid the Young Men\u2019s Philanthropic League $6 million for the home in 1995 and renovated it. Roberts, who founded a chain of all-women gyms, died in 2003.\n\nThe seven-story mansion, decorated in the French Gothic style, has nine bedrooms, seven bathrooms and an elevator. It also features a wood-panneled library, patio, solarium and rooftop terrace. The sixth floor is currently outfitted with a gym and sauna.\nThe Modlin Group\u2019s Adam Modlin, who\u2019s representing the sellers, declined to comment on the pending transaction.\nThe signed contract comes after a deal for another Upper East Side townhouse\nhit the books\nlast week. A Gilded Age mansion at 10 East 67th Street sold for $36 million, a 30 percent discount from its initial asking price of $50 million. The home, known as the Jules Bach Mansion, was the site of a fire, which killed socialite Kitty Meyer and her friend, actress Zohra Lahrizi Zondler, in 1997.\nThe Woolworth Mansion, originally designed by Charles P.H. Gilbert, is the most expensive townhouse to enter contract since another at 973 Fifth Avenue\nsnagged a buyer\nin February. At the time the contract was signed, the home was asking $50 million, down $30 million from its price when it hit the market in 2021. It closed for $46 million in May.\n",

The properties include 600, 719\u2013737, 741, 801\u2013821 Lincoln Road and 723 North Lincoln Lane. It\u2019s unclear if Comras has an equity partner.\nNew York-based Morgan Stanley has been trying to sell the buildings this year, after buying them as part of a larger portfolio purchase in 2014, in a deal valued at $342 million. Miami Beach-based Terranova sold the properties at the time, retaining a stake.\nTenants include The Cheesecake Factory, Salt &amp; Straw, It\u2019Sugar and Lincoln Eatery.\nThis year, Duane Reade drugstore\u2019s Cohen family was under contract for more than $150 million to purchase the buildings, but the deal fell through because the Cohens couldn\u2019t find an equity partner or secure debt, the Commercial Observer reported.\nComras founded his eponymously named firm in 1992 after moving to South Florida from New York. The company, which also has a leasing brokerage division, already is a landlord on Lincoln Road.\nIts properties include 635-639, 701 and 734-744 Lincoln Road, according to the company\u2019s website. Tenants there include Aldo, Swarovski and Hoka.\n\nLincoln Road is South Beach\u2019s pedestrian promenade that developer Carl Fisher created in the early 1910s. It was redesigned by architect Morris Lapidus and converted to pedestrian-only in the 1950s.\nOver the years, it attracted hefty investment. In 2015, Comras sold the Lincoln Road block at 1001-1035 Lincoln Road to Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega for\n$370 million\n. Vornado sold the building at 1100 Lincoln Road in 2022 to an affiliate of Steve Gozini\u2019s Los Angeles-based BH Properties for\n$93.6 million.\nYet, in more recent years, Lincoln Road has lost some of its luster to newer competing retail and dining hubs such as the Miami Design District and Wynwood. Last year, Tricera Capital and investors Scott Robins and Philip Levine paid\n$13.6 million\nfor 318-334 Lincoln Road, marking a discount from the $20.5 million Aby Rosen\u2019s RFR Realty had paid in 2019. Also last year, Torose Equities bought 910 Lincoln Road for $10.4 million, a discount from the\n$15.8 million\nseller Invesco Real Estate had paid in 2010.\nMany storefronts are currently vacant, and the Regal South Beach movie theater is shuttered.\nStill, investors and developers are planning projects. Lionstone Development, the Ben-Josef Group and Flag Luxury Group started in August the first phase of their planned\n$12 million\nstreetscape improvement at the 100-300 blocks of Lincoln Road. The developers, who own Sagamore and Ritz-Carlton South Beach hotels at 1671 Collins Avenue and 1 Lincoln Road, plan a 15-story, 30-unit condo tower on the property. It will be branded Billionaires\u2019 Beach.\nNear Lincoln Road, Paul Cejas, former ambassador to Belgium and the chairman of PLC Investments, wants to develop a\n15-story, 210-unit\napartment tower at 1600 Washington Avenue and 1601 Drexel Avenue.\nIn August, Robert Rivani paid\n$37 million\nfor the historic Lincoln Theatre building anchored by H&amp;M at 551 Lincoln Road.\n\u2013\u2013\nLidia Dinkova",

        "content": "Another developer is throwing their hat in the ring to redevelop a suburban Chicago country club and golf course for industrial use \u2014 but not without resident opposition.\nRyan Companies, the Minneapolis-based developer behind projects for Amazon and Target, entered one of Chicagoland\u2019s longest-running real estate battles \u2014 the redevelopment of\nCalumet Country Club\n, located at 2136 175th Street, straddling the Hazel Crest and Homewood border. The company confirmed this month that it has a purchase and sale agreement for the 130-acre property, where multiple past attempts to rezone the site for industrial use have met fierce resistance, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nRyan\u2019s\nvice president of real estate development, Kyle Schott, pitched the firm\u2019s interest to\nHazel Crest\u2019s village board\non Oct. 14, describing it as the start of a \u201ctransparent dialogue\u201d with residents about the site\u2019s future.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve identified industrial as a very good use at this stage,\u201d Schott said during the meeting, while emphasizing that other options could be explored depending on market studies and community feedback. \u201cWe have our thoughts, but we need to find alignment with other folks that might have different ideas.\u201d\nThat cautious framing didn\u2019t stop local advocates from sounding the alarm. The South Suburbs for Greenspace coalition, which has fought industrial development of the club since 2020, argues that warehouses would erase one of the area\u2019s few major green spaces \u2014 a tree-dense site providing what they call an essential air buffer between Interstates 80 and 294.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t meet people anywhere who are for this development,\u201d said co-founder Liz Varmecky, who said her group has canvassed thousands of residents. \u201cThere\u2019s almost no green space in Hazel Crest or Homewood \u2026 this is about protecting what\u2019s left.\u201d\nThe latest fight follows a years-long tug-of-war between the two suburbs and\nArizona developer\nWalt Brown Jr., who bought the golf course in 2020 with plans to turn it into a warehouse park. Homewood blocked his rezoning request amid local outcry, prompting Brown to detach the property from the village and have it annexed into Hazel Crest under a legal settlement. His team later sought the same zoning changes through a new firm, Catalyst Consulting, before those efforts also stalled.\nHazel Crest residents \u2014 a majority-Black, largely middle-class community \u2014 view the industrial push as both environmentally and economically harmful. Varmecky said she believes developers assume the area would welcome low-wage warehouse jobs, a notion she called \u201coffensive and out of touch.\u201d\nOpponents want the Forest Preserves of Cook County or another public entity to buy and protect the land instead. They\u2019ve warned that an industrial project would likely depend on a tax increment financing district, or TIF, freezing property tax growth for more than two decades.\nRyan Companies\ndeclined to comment on community opposition. Schott said the firm intends to close on the site \u2014 all at once or in phases \u2014 and proceed with development if it can secure approvals.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Atherton is no longer the country\u2019s king of high prices.\nThe nation\u2019s most expensive ZIP code isn\u2019t in the tony Bay Area enclave, but on Fisher Island in Miami Beach, the Silicon Valley Business Journal\nreported\n, citing PropertyShark\u2019s 2025\nranking\nof the 100 priciest ZIP codes in the country.\nFisher Island\n\u2019s 33109 ZIP code has outdone Atherton\u2019s 94027 with a median sales price of $9.5 million, marking a 65 percent increase in home prices in the past year. The cheapest home sold on the island was more than $1.4 million, with the most expensive reaching nearly $23.7 million.\nBy contrast, Atherton\u2019s 94027 ZIP had a median sales price of more than $8.3 million. The drop to second place marks the first time in the decade-long history of PropertyShark\u2019s ranking that the country\u2019s priciest ZIP code isn\u2019t in California or New York. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s doom and gloom in Atherton, though; it still set a record with a 5 percent increase from the past year. Sales prices in Atherton have ranged from $3.2 million to $51.5 million with a\npurchase by tech executive Stephen Luczo\n.\n\nCalifornia isn\u2019t short on pricey homes despite Atherton\u2019s fall from first place. The Golden State holds 61 percent of the ZIP codes on PropertyShark\u2019s priciest homes list. Of those, 32 were in the Bay Area, more than any other metro area in the country; still, that\u2019s a drop from a pre-pandemic peak of 55 ZIPs.\nIn the top 10, two other communities besides Atherton made it into the top 10 of the country\u2019s priciest ZIPs. Stinson Beach\u2019s 94970 in Marin County saw a 38 percent year-over-year median price increase to $5.2 million, placing it at No. 7 and marking the first time it made it into the top 10. Closer to Atherton in the Peninsula, Los Altos\u2019 94022 came in at No. 9 with a $5.1 million median sales price \u2014 the first time the ZIP has crossed the $5 million median sales price threshold.\nWith 15 ZIPs in Santa Clara County on the list, including Los Altos, it\u2019s the second-most-expensive county in the U.S. behind Los Angeles County. Other Bay Area municipalities with ZIP codes in the top 100 include San Francisco, Saratoga, Palo Alto,\nSunnyvale\n, Stanford, Cupertino, San Carlos,\nSan Mateo\n,\nBelmont\n, Danville, Alamo, Hillsborough, Greenbrae, Ross and\nBelvedere and Tiburon\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

AmTrust, headquartered in the Financial District, has been listed on TASE since 2021.\nThe 1950s-era building has a large vacancy to fill. The buyer said the 570,000-square-foot property is only 68 percent leased, with about $10 million of annual net operating income.\nAmTrust plans to invest $60 to $70 million to stabilize and lease the building, and expects NOI to increase to $20 million.\nThe company expects to close the deal by the end of the year and is seeking financing of up to 60 to 65 percent of the purchase price.\nSapir\u2019s family has owned the building and another one across the street, the 28-story 261 Madison Avenue, which is not part of the AmTrust deal, since 1997.\n\nThe properties were at the center of a dispute between Sapir and his brother-in-law Rotem Rosen. Sapir sued Rosen in 2022, alleging Rosen lined his pockets with money from the Sapir Organization. Sapir accused Rosen of enlisting his brothers, Sapir Org. general counsel Omer Rosen and head of development Tom Rosen, to issue themselves a $580,000 personal loan from 260-261 Madison Avenue.\nThe two sides settled the case in 2022.\nSapir had put the properties up for sale in 2021, seeking a price tag of $600 million, but no deal ever went through.\nThe buildings, meanwhile, struggled amid the acrimony. The $126 million CMBS loan on the properties was sent to special servicing in November 2022, but soon after Sapir refinanced the properties with $326 million.\nAmTrust, meanwhile, paid $65 million last year to buy Savanna\u2019s 360 Lexington Avenue, a big discount to the $180 million Savanna paid in 2019.\n",

        "content": "The next mayor will need to make a choice about the fate of the Elizabeth Street Garden.\nIn June, the Adams administration\ncanceled\nplans for 123 units of senior housing at the garden site, while touting an agreement with Council member Chris Marte to rezone three other sites that would net 620 affordable units.\nThe decision was a stunning reversal of the administration\u2019s stance on the city-owned site, especially after years of litigation.\nWhen asked at an event hosted by Hell Gate on Friday, Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani confirmed that he would evict the garden from the Nolita site during his first year as mayor, if elected.\nThe response represented a more concrete commitment regarding the garden. He had previously\nindicated\n, before the June primary, that he believed housing should be built on the site.\nFormer Gov. Andrew Cuomo\nhas said\nthat it is a \u201cmistake to close gardens and green spaces\u201d and that the city should focus on other sites suitable for affordable housing. Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa has long opposed evicting the garden.\nIf Mamdani is elected mayor and makes the Elizabeth Street Garden project, dubbed Haven Green, a priority, it will be interesting to see what becomes of the three zonings Marte pledged to support in exchange for sparing the garden. City Council leadership has repeatedly cited the Adams administration\u2019s reversal on the garden as the height of its hypocrisy in pushing the housing ballot measures while also backing off of a housing project that was ready to go.\nIf the\nhousing ballot measures\ndo not pass, perhaps Mamdani\u2019s action on the Elizabeth Street Garden would build enough goodwill with other Council members to convince them to vote against Marte\u2019s wishes on those other rezonings.\nBut as I\u2019ve previously noted, the value of the deal made by the Adams administration disappears if the ballot measures are approved. Marte\u2019s buy-in will not necessarily be needed for those rezonings to move forward (assuming the next administration decides to move forward with those rezonings).\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nIf Mayor Eric Adams stacks the Rent Guidelines Board before he leaves office,\nwho will he appoint\n? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\n\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: New Jersey is home to 16 diners that are open 24/7,\naccording to NJ Advance Media\n.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 MTA officials say that a plan to bring Metro-North trains to Penn Station and open four new stations in the Bronx is delayed by at least three years,\nGothamist reports\n. Agency officials, who blame Amtrak, proposed opening three stations and delivering roughly 50 percent of planned service by 2027, which was when the entire project was supposed to be completed. Now, officials say the project won\u2019t be finished until at least 2030. Amtrak controls much of the route that would bring Metro-North trains to Penn, and the MTA says the federal agency has not cooperated. A spokesperson for Amtrak told Gothamist that the agency is \u201ccommitted\u201d to the project.\n\u2014 A new poll by Suffolk University Boston found that 44 percent of likely NYC general election voters support Zohran Mamdani, compared to 34 percent who support Andrew Cuomo and 11 percent who favor Curtis Sliwa,\nCBS News reports\n. The poll shows that Cuomo has cut Mamdani\u2019s lead in half, by 10 percentage points, compared to the last Suffolk University poll in September.\n\u2014 More than 223,000 New Yorkers voted in the first three days of early voting,\naccording to the city Board of Elections\n.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$16.3 million\nfor a condominium unit at 988 Fifth Avenue. The Upper East Side unit is 3,300 square feet and last sold on the market in 2022 for $14.6 million. Douglas Elliman\u2019s\nRichard Phan\nhas the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$66.2 million\nfor 630 Third Avenue. ATCO Properties &amp; Management sold the 260,000-square-foot office building in Midtown to The Davis Companies,\nper reports\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $11 million for a co-op unit at 800 Park Avenue. The Lenox Hill co-op has six bedrooms and six bathrooms.\nCorcoran\u2019s\nSteven Cohen and Stefanie Ruch have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 71,748-square-foot, 15-story residential building at 4137 Third Avenue in the Bronx. Fernando Geremia of Fred Geremia Architects &amp; Planners is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "Jamaica, Queens, could be the next site for more than 400 affordable housing units.\nA joint partnership unveiled plans for two 14-story mixed-use buildings in Downtown Jamaica. One will contain more than 350 affordable rental units, while the other will be the site of 72 income-restricted condos.\nThe Greater Jamaica Development Corporation is partnering with the Gotham Organization, Monadnock Development and Moses Sole Realty on the plan at 90th Avenue and Parsons Boulevard. The design calls for the redevelopment of a five-story parking garage on the lot that is currently owned by GJDC.\nDevelopment is estimated to cost $200 million or more. The team is calling the development \u201cArras.\u201d\nFinancing for the development has not yet been secured. But the joint venture is targeting tax-exempt multifamily bonds, low-income housing tax credit equity and funding from the city\u2019s housing department. The city operates two programs that could provide financing: the New Construction program for rentals and the Open Door program for condos.\n\n\u201cThe goal of the development is to create housing for the missing middle,\u201d said Bryan Kelly, president of development at Gotham. \u201cOne of the benefits of condominium ownership is creating generational legacy equity in the assets for families down the road.\u201d\nThe Open Door program finances affordable condo and co-op buildings. Apartment owners must personally occupy their units for a certain period of time. The apartment owner can only sell to purchasers who meet similar income requirements.\nThe plan calls for the rentals to target households earning between 30 and 100 percent of the area median income. The condos would target those earning 90 to 100 percent of the AMI.\nGotham has worked on a number of partially affordable developments before, including Gotham Point, a two-tower, 1,130-unit development in Hunter\u2019s Point, Queens, that is 75 percent affordable units.\nKelly said the planned development does not depend on the passage of an awaited\nneighborhood rezoning\n. The Jamaica Neighborhood plan would upzone the area, allowing for upwards of 12,000 new units, if approved by city lawmakers.\n",

Under the initiative, the first round of 12 properties would be sold at fair-market value to hand-picked development teams with the goal of building units for first-time homeowners, with proceeds from the land sales going toward assistance for the first-time homebuyers.\nThe City of Los Angeles is on the hook to build 456,643 new homes by the end of the decade as part of its\nhousing element\n.

        "content": "Two Long Island investment firms known for scooping up distressed shopping malls are back at it in Chicago\u2019s troubled office sector \u2014 this time with a deal for one of the Loop\u2019s marquee high-rises.\nNamdar Realty Group\nand Mason Asset Management reached a preliminary agreement to buy the 40-story tower at 190 South LaSalle Street, according to\nCostar\n. The sale is still in flux and could fall apart amid tight financing conditions, but the Great Neck, New York\u2013based partners are known for paying cash to close even large, complex deals.\nThe price for the 798,000-square-foot building hasn\u2019t been disclosed. The sellers \u2014 Beacon Capital Partners and U.S. Bank, which also occupies space in the tower \u2014 are being represented by Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s Tom Sitz and Cody Hundertmark. A previous buyer, Colorado-based Real Capital Solutions,\nwalked away\nfrom a deal for the property earlier this year.\nIf the deal closes, it would mark Namdar and Mason\u2019s third major office acquisition in downtown Chicago in less than a year. The duo picked up the 57-story\n70 West Madison\ntower and the 47-story\n1 North LaSalle\nby buying out its loan and taking title to the property \u2014 both believed to have traded for a combined $100 million. They\u2019ve also been active on the retail side, paying $23 million for a Magnificent Mile storefront and striking an $8.3 million deal for the retail component of 1 North State, according to Crain\u2019s.\n\nBuilt in 1987 and designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee, 190 South LaSalle is known for its green gabled roof and postmodern profile on the Chicago skyline. Boston-based Beacon bought it in 2019 for $230 million \u2014 or $288 per square foot \u2014 financed by a $167.5 million loan just before the pandemic upended the office market. Beacon later invested another $13.6 million in renovations before putting it on the market this spring.\nAny new owner faces a steep climb. The tower has significant vacancy and will soon lose key tenants, including Bain &amp; Co, which is relocating to\n131 South Dearborn Street\n. Still, for Namdar and Mason \u2014 who last year paid $45 million for Cleveland\u2019s 200 Public Square tower \u2014 Chicago\u2019s discounted towers are in line with their high-risk, high-reward business model.\nThe tower last traded for $230 million ($288 per square foot) in 2019, when Beacon bought it just before the pandemic upended the office sector. The 798,800-square-foot tower has experienced high vacancy in recent years, and Real Capital Solutions was expected to buy the building for less than the $167.5 million loan, provided by U.S. Bank, that Beacon Capital took out on it in 2020.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Brandywine Realty Trust is reworking the vision for its North Austin mixed-use campus Uptown ATX as longtime tenant\nIBM prepares to exit\nand the city\u2019s\noffice market\ncontinues to soften.\nThe Philadelphia-based firm was going to redevelop the campus, but is now planning to focus on renovations, CEO Jerry Sweeney said on the firm\u2019s Oct. 23 earnings call, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nIBM will vacate its 66-acre campus at 11501 Burnet Road \u2014 across from The Domain \u2014 in mid-2027, Sweeney said. That\u2019s when the next development phase of Uptown ATX is slated to begin. Instead of building new towers, Brandywine will focus on upgrading buildings 902, 904 and 906, totaling roughly 500,000 square feet. Brandywine expects to begin delivering renovated space in early 2027.\nWhile Sweeney didn\u2019t explicitly rule out future demolition, the pivot reflects the reality of a sluggish office market. Vacancy rates remain high and few tenants are seeking large new footprints. Other developers across Austin have shelved ground-up projects and are repositioning existing assets instead. Average office rents in the Central Business District hit $64.29 per square foot in the third quarter, compared with $42.23 in North Austin, according to CBRE.\nBrandywine tested the market this spring when it\nlisted 1 million square feet\nof Austin office assets. A company executive said the listings were aimed at gauging pricing, not pulling back from Austin.\n\nUptown ATX remains one of the region\u2019s largest mixed-use projects, envisioned as Austin\u2019s \u201csecond downtown.\u201d So far, Brandywine has completed the 348,000-square-foot One Uptown office tower and the 341-unit Solaris House apartment building on the site\u2019s southern end.\nOne Uptown is showing momentum despite broader leasing headwinds.\nNvidia Corp\n. and cybersecurity firm Axonius Inc. together occupy about 109,000 square feet, and Brandywine is in talks to fill another 75,000 square feet that would bring the building to roughly 60 percent leased. Nvidia also holds expansion rights, executives said. Solaris House, meanwhile, is 99 percent leased after heavy concessions during its first year, and renewal rents are up 8 percent.\nIBM\u2019s relocation plans remain murky. A previous 320,000-square-foot pre-lease with Houston-based Hines fell through, but the company\nsnagged Meta\u2019s space at the Domain\nlast year. Regardless, its exit gives Brandywine both a vacancy challenge and an opportunity to reset Uptown ATX\u2019s next chapter.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Amenities include two fitness centers, a yoga and meditation room, on-site valet and a parking garage.\n\nThe 106-unit condo complex has attracted a number of musically-inclined celebs, including rapper Kendrick Lamar, who\npurchased a penthouse for $8.6 million\nin 2023, and British musician Ed Sheeran, who\nbought a four-bedroom unit\nin May at 130 Furman Street, where\nhe had rented an apartment\nin 2023.\nThe second priciest contract belonged to a Fort Greene townhouse at 294 Carlton Avenue asking just under $4 million.\nSpanning over 3,100 square feet of interior space, the four-story home is currently configured as a three-family. Built in 1899, the historic home includes original details like multiple fireplaces, crown moldings, hardwood floors and a decorative skylight.\nSitting on a 100-foot lot, the home also comes with almost 1,500 square feet of unused FAR, according to the listing.\nCompass\u2019 David Chang had the listing.\nHomes put into contract last week had a median asking price of $2.7 million, an average price per square foot of $1,556 and spent an average of 82 days on the market.\n",

        "content": "Six years after Hang Dong Zhang purchased a site in the Court Square section of Long Island City, BZ Development Group is ready to do something with it.\nThe Flushing-based firm filed demolition plans with the Department of Buildings for its site at 23-08 Jackson Avenue, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The razing of the three-story, 18,000-square-foot building will give way to a luxury condo project dubbed The Moon Court Square.\nAn affiliate of BZ purchased the site in June 2019 for $8.2 million. It\u2019s unclear why it took more than half a decade for the developer to make progress at the site, though the pandemic seems like a logical culprit.\nDetails about the project, including size and unit count, have not been revealed. Zhang did not respond to a request for comment from the outlet.\nZhang\u2019s firm has already developed a number of properties in Long Island City under the \u201cMoon\u201d brand, including another project on Jackson Avenue, one on 27th Street and one on 44th Drive.\n\nThree years ago, Zhang acquired a site at 138-28 Northern Boulevard\nfor $48 million\nfrom Kit Realty LLC. Zhang planned to redevelop the site into a 14-story, mixed-use condominium.\nThe time may be ripe for development in Long Island City. In the spring, the city\nkicked off the process of rezoning\na 54-block area of the Queens neighborhood, intended to allow residential development in areas zoned for industrial use while also encouraging more commercial and light industrial development in other parts of the district.\nThe Department of City Planning estimated that after the rezoning is approved through the seven-month land use review process, 14,700 apartments will be built over the next decade, 4,300 of which will be set aside as income-restricted under MIH.\nThe rezoning could also lead to the creation of 3.5 million square feet of commercial development and 292,000 square feet of community space.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner",

        "content": "Ian Bruce Eichner\u2019s Continuum Company is being sued by a lender that alleges it\u2019s owed more than half a million dollars in fees tied to the firm\u2019s planned condo buyout in North Miami.\nBoston-based CW Investment Advisers filed a lawsuit against New York-based and Miami-based Continuum over the financing backing the $61 million buyout of the Mariners Bay condo building at 12000 North Bayshore Drive. The complaint was filed in New York County Court.\nThe four-story, 46-unit condo building would eventually be torn down and replaced with a\n20-story, 267-unit condo building\n.\nContinuum tapped a national mortgage brokerage firm to shop for financing for the project last year and selected CW, according to the lawsuit.\nOn the morning of the proposed closing this summer, CW alleges that Continuum \u201cthrew a curveball\u201d and was no longer willing to meet negotiated project milestones. Continuum walked away from the deal, according to the complaint.\nThe lawsuit is tied to the term sheet the developer and lender signed, in which Continuum allegedly agreed to pay CW\u2019s expenses for negotiating, underwriting and syndicating the proposed loan. Continuum also agreed to pay a 1 percent break-up fee, CW alleges. CW sued for breach of contract.\n\u201cAfter abandoning the transaction at the last minute, Continuum refused to honor its\nobligation to pay CW\u2019s loan expenses or the break-up fee,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.\nEichner, chairman and CEO of Continuum, declined to comment on pending litigation, but disputed the allegations and said the firm will \u201cvigorously defend ourselves against these spurious charges.\u201d\n\nAn affiliate of Continuum entered into a deal to acquire the units at Mariners Bay, records show. The developer has not yet completed the purchase.\nContinuum did not respond to a request for an update on the buyout, but condo buyouts are often delayed and are\nnotoriously tricky\nto complete.\nThe term sheet between CW and Continuum was based on a purchase price of more than $61 million and a loan amount equal to the lesser of $51 million, an amount not exceeding a 61 percent loan-to-cost ratio based on an approved predevelopment budget, or an amount not exceeding a 75 percent loan-to-cost ratio based on an appraisal of the property, the complaint alleges.\nCW alleges that Continuum\u2019s obligations to reimburse its loan expenses and pay a breakup fee were binding, according to the complaint.\nIts costs and expenses, which CW claims totaled more than $820,000, included paying for a flood risk report, insurance consulting, outstanding judgments and liens, and more. The firm also states that it uncovered issues that included obligations imposed by the city of North Miami and a zoning appeal filed by a neighboring property owner \u201cthat added complexity, delay and cost to the transaction,\u201d the complaint states.\nCW said it only received $325,000 from Continuum in deposits, leaving a shortfall of nearly $500,000 in unpaid expenses. The lending firm is seeking damages totaling no less than $510,000, according to the lawsuit.\nContinuum has a $3 billion, 1,000-unit condo portfolio in South Florida that includes planned projects in North Bay Village and Bay Harbor Islands. In August, Continuum secured a\n$67 million construction loan\nfor the second phase of its Bay Harbor Islands condo project. The developer received the financing for La Baia North from S3 Capital Partners, a New York-based alternative lender that provides middle-market construction loans and bridge loans..\nThis summer, the development firm secured unanimous\napproval\nfrom the North Bay Village Commission for a special area plan, site plan and development agreement for the Continuum Waterfront District. The district is planned to have two Continuum condo towers, a 200-key Continuum hotel and a marina. One tower can now be up to 440 feet tall. The site includes the former Shuckers Waterfront Bar &amp; Grill, now called the Palm Tree Club.\n",

        "content": "The New York City Economic Development Corporation has tapped Coney Island-based Rybak Development to lead the next phase of the sweeping redevelopment effort in Coney Island.\nThe announcement comes eight months after the mayor\u2019s office\nreleased a request for proposals\nfor a developer to build a 500-unit project on Surf Avenue between West 21st and 22nd Streets.\nThe development is one piece of the city\u2019s plans for the neighborhood, including funding affordable housing projects, a more than $1 billion investment in the historic Coney Island Boardwalk and a $42 million renovation of the Abe Stark Sports Center.\u00a0 Rybak\u2019s project is part of the city\u2019s broader effort to build nearly 10,000 housing units on city-owned land, 1,500 of which will be in Coney Island West.\n\u201cUtilizing public land for housing is a critical way to increase our supply,\u201d NYCEDC president and CEO Andrew Kimball said in a statement.\nRybak agreed to purchase 80,000 square feet of city-owned land that is currently being used for public parking to build 505 units of mixed-income housing. The project will include 25 percent of units designated as permanently affordable, ranging from 40 percent of the area median income to 100 percent of the area median income.\nSergey Rybak, the CEO of Rybak Development, said he expects the project to cost over $350 million.\nAs part of the RFP, developers were required to privately finance the deal, according to Rybak, and the project will be eligible for the 485-x tax abatement. He credited the firm\u2019s local expertise with informing how it underwrote the deal, pointing to a\n499-unit rental building\ncovering 1 million square feet down the street that launched in the last week.\n\u201cConey Island has been historically overlooked due to the lack of new development that is comparable with other areas in Brooklyn that have buildings which are highly-amenitized and located in proximity to transportation,\u201d Rybak said, noting that he\u2019s planning to build out larger units which he hopes will attract Brooklynites from across the borough.\nThe 800,000-square-foot project will receive an additional 175,000 square feet of development rights from the neighboring Coney Island Amphitheater. The project will also include 32,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space, new structured parking and 65,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor amenities.\n\nRybak will be working with Brooklyn-based developer IMC Architecture and construction is expected to begin in 2027 and be completed in 2030.\nA \u2018neighborhood revitalization\u2019\nThe announcement comes during the twilight of Mayor Erc Adams\u2019 administration, which has eased housing restrictions through the\nCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity zoning reforms\nthat are slated to\nenable 80,000 additional units of housing\nto be built throughout the city. NYCEDC chief operating officer Melissa Roman Burch cited the easing of residential parking requirements as one of the features of the legislation that made the development possible.\nThe development, dubbed the Tilyou Towers in honor of the Steeplechase Park founder, is part of a much larger effort from the city to redevelop Coney Island using public works investments and public-private partnerships.\nRybak credited the city\u2019s infrastructure investments with making the project workable. \u201cThis particular development is only possible due to the remapping of streets and introduction of a new street which will complete the four sides of the property as well as the needed flood and storm upgrades,\u201d he said. \u201cPrior to that, this amount of housing would not have been possible.\u201d\nThe city has more plans to invest in the area. Its 2026 capital plan allocates over $1 billion for service improvements and construction on the beach and boardwalk through 2032.\nThe investment into the area has marked a turning point for the city after a 2009 rezoning yielded\nlittle in the way of housing production\n. \u201cThis story really goes back to an important rezoning that the NYCEDC led in 2009 that envisioned a whole neighborhood revitalization that included hundreds of millions of investment into infrastructure,\u201d said Roman Burch.\nIn Coney Island West, two affordable housing projects launched in 2019 and 2022 and a third is slated to open in 2028. The city has also been providing public subsidies to affordable and supportive housing projects in the area, including announcing $90 million in funding in June for a 420-unit affordable development from BFC Partners.\nRybak\u2019s development will consist of an 11-story podium and two 28-story towers, with outdoor amenities that include an infinity-edge swimming pool, lounge, gaming area and playground.\n",

        "content": "New York legislators are taking aim at the insurance crisis battering affordable housing landlords.\nA trio of bills unveiled this week would create a $50 million fund and ramp up oversight of insurers after years of spiraling premiums that advocates say threaten the city\u2019s low-income housing stock, Bisnow\nreported\n.\nAssembly member Em\u00e9rita Torres, who represents the South Bronx, introduced the measures after\na study\nby the National Equity Fund and Enterprise Community Partners found that insurance costs for affordable buildings have more than doubled since 2017, from $712 to $1,495 per unit. The study also found that more than half of affordable landlords are spending more on operating costs than they\u2019re taking in through net income.\nTorres\u2019 package includes a grant fund offering up to $3,000 per unit, or $2 million per project, to help cover the widening gap between insurance bills and landlords\u2019 bottom lines.\nThe other two bills would require annual state reporting on premium rates, nonrenewals and denials, and convene a task force of housing and insurance officials to study the problem and propose long-term fixes.\nRachel Fee, executive director of the New York Housing Conference, who advised on the legislation, told reporters the lack of public data has made it nearly impossible to pinpoint what\u2019s driving the surge.\n\u201cWe have some anecdotes and examples, but we don\u2019t have a real pattern that we can see with any public data,\u201d she said.\n\nThe cost crunch is hitting hardest in the Bronx, where the concentration of rent-stabilized housing is highest in the city. Enterprise\u2019s study pegged the borough\u2019s per-unit insurance cost at $1,806 last year, roughly 6 percent above the citywide average.\nInsurers\u2019 retreat from the market has left landlords with few options.\nThe situation could worsen if mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani delivers on his campaign promise to freeze rents in stabilized units, a move that landlords warn could choke revenue as expenses balloon.\nGov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s office declined to comment on the pending bills but pointed to $1.5 billion in state housing funds earmarked this year to expand affordability. The Legislature won\u2019t reconvene until January, meaning any relief \u2014 if it comes \u2014 is still a ways away.\nIn the meantime, landlords are taking matters into their own hands. A group led by Wavecrest Management\nformed a captive insurance company\nto pool risk and negotiate better rates.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Barbara Corcoran just nabbed a new co-op on Fifth Avenue.\nThe founder of the Corcoran Group and \u201cShark Tank\u201d investor paid $16 million for a penthouse at 1016 Fifth Avenue in what appears to be an off-market deal, according to public records. The deal comes roughly three weeks after she\nclosed a deal\nfor another penthouse in the neighborhood, about a dozen blocks north of her new digs.\nCorcoran paid the full asking price for her latest pad, according to\nCorcoran\u2019s Carrie Chiang\n, who represented her in the deal.\nUnit PH-W hasn\u2019t traded since the city began recording property transactions digitally, so the unit\u2019s price history is unclear. The latest document attached to the apartment is from 2007, when the then-owner transferred it to a trust.\nChiang said the deal came about as she was on the hunt for a penthouse that fit Corcoran\u2019s requirements, including a location in the 80s. She said she found out about the apartment before it hit the market, and Corcoran asked to see it before it was officially listed.\n\u201cBarbara knows what she wants,\u201d Chiang said. \u201cOnce she saw it, she said, \u2018Carrie, I\u2019m not going to lose this one.\u2019\u201d\nThe unit has three bedrooms, formal dining and living rooms, a library and terrace, according to Chiang, who described the home as having tall ceilings and much of its original details. She added that Corcoran plans to move into the apartment shortly and is considering some minor renovations next year.\n\nThe co-op building housing the unit, along with 55 others, was built in 1926. It includes amenities such as a 24-hour doorman and elevator service.\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely the best penthouse I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Chiang said. \u201cShe\u2019s so happy there.\u201d\nSerena Boardman with Sotheby\u2019s International represented the seller.\nCorcoran\nfound a buyer\nfor her previous home, Unit PHB at 1158 Fifth Avenue, just one day after listing the duplex in May. She traded the five-bedroom apartment \u2014 known for its sprawling terrace and dining area encased in glass \u2014\u00a0 for $13.5 million, $1.5 million more than its asking price.\nAt the time of the deal, Corcoran said that she and her husband, Bill Higgins, had their sights set on another pad on the Upper East Side, one without the curving staircase that Higgins was having difficulty climbing safely.\nCorcoran and Higgins, now 76 and 80 years old respectively, bought the co-op at 1158 Fifth Avenue for $10 million in 2015 and shelled out roughly $2 million to renovate it. The couple lived there for a decade before offloading it.\n",

        "content": "Joel Rodstein has stacked 20 years in property management on top of the business degree he earned from the University of California-Santa Cruz. He\u2019s worked his way up to become CEO of North Oak Property Management. Rodstein oversees a portfolio of 185 buildings ranging from commercial to multifamily properties including around 800 units spread over historic Hollywood and hip NoHo Arts District.\nThese days, Rodstein spends a good chunk of time every week handling the sort of paperwork that seems more in line with an administrative assistant\u2019s duties.\n\u201cI spend two to three hours a week just reviewing paperwork like this,\u201d said Rodstein, referring to a seemingly innocuous rental application.\nIndeed, the necessary evil of paperwork that was once considered the stuff of secretaries now holds the potential to be just plain evil \u2014 rife with levels of risk that put it on the to-do lists of landlords and property managers.\nFraudulent applications have become an increasingly common form of theft that starts when a tenant who generally lacks the means or intention of paying rent gets into a lease and then uses eviction protections to take a free ride that can last for months.\nBeside the lost rent for however many months a bad tenant can game the system, landlords eventually bear the legal and administrative costs of an eviction, which\naverages $7,685\n, according to a\nsurvey\nby Snappt, an Ojai-based provider of fraud-prevention software.\nRodstein has plenty of company in finding new ways to\u00a0 avoid the toll of fraud. Advances in technology have made fake documents harder to detect and the problem more widespread. That\u2019s created an arms race of sorts, with service providers peddling software to uncover would-be cheats.\n\u201cLeasing fraud today has become far more sophisticated and brazen, using stolen or composite identities advertised for sale on\nsocial media\n\u2014 and often with no intent to ever pay rent,\u201d said Jay Parsons, who runs an eponymous consultancy that specializes in rental housing economics.\nThat brings in another, structural cost for landlords and property managers looking to stay ahead of the game.\nRodstein and North Oak Property Management now pay about $10 per applicant for fraud detection technology, forking over about $18,000 a year to service providers.\nFor developer and apartment building owner Balanciano Group, the measures cost around $25 per tenant application.\n\u201cAs fraud became more sophisticated, we implemented better tools, smarter systems and stronger safeguards,\u201d said Shawn Evenhaim, CEO of the Los Angeles-based Balanciano.\nSky Properties in Toluca Lake, has implemented a series of safeguards that includes tying credit reports to bank statements, reviewing utility bills, verifying employment directly, and running artificial intelligence-based ID verification.\nAll of that creates another layer of cost \u2014 because time is money and those steps take more time, according to Kari Negri, CEO of Sky Properties. A process that used to require one day now\u00a0 takes three, which means units sit vacant longer.\nWith a monthly rent of $3,500 that amounts to a $117 rental loss per day per unit.\nThe challenges of tenant-application fraud are clear and growing, according to landlords, property managers, security specialists, law enforcement and industry data.\nNationally, over 90 percent of rental housing operators dealt with some form of fraud in a 12-month period, a\nsurvey\nreleased by the National Multifamily Housing Council in January 2024 indicates.\nOf $4.2 million in bad debt that the average rental housing provider saw that year, a quarter could be attributed to fraudulent applications and the related failure to pay rent, per the association.\nFraud runs the gamut from old-school tactics such as providing phony references to new digital tricks like creating fake pay stubs.\nIt\u2019s the digital end that seems to have come out of a perfect storm that tracks back to the pandemic era. That\u2019s when virtual leasing processes reduced face-to-face interaction, financial hardship increased incentives to cheat, and technology made document fabrication easier than ever.\n\nRodstein recalls one incident when he couldn\u2019t evict a scammer due to tenant protections during Covid. Once those were lifted, North Oak served the man with a three-day notice, and he left in the middle of the night.\nCriminal networks are in the game, and will establish shell companies with legitimate registrations, websites and payroll systems that generate authentic-looking, but fraudulent pay stubs and bank statements, according to Daniel Berlind, founder of Snappt.\nThat level of sophistication requires looking at how long ago the business was created, what its website has been like over the years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about kind of creating this web and linking all of these data points together,\u201d Berlind said, like ID, documents, bank accounts and payroll.\nSmall landlords are particularly vulnerable, according to Dan Yukelson, executive director of the Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles.\n\u201cThe smaller owners are more likely to want to give a break to someone who seems nice and they do not follow strict screening criteria, and most importantly, do not have a way to get access to document fraud detection software,\u201d he said.\nSome of the biggest institutional landlords are on alert, too.\nCharleston, S.C.-based Greystar, which manages over $300 billion in real estate globally, reported that 12 to 15 percent of tenant applications are fraudulent.\nThe firm bears the costs of multiple applications to detect fraud, said Jamie Teabo, senior managing director of real estate. Greystar is fending off fraud for the most part, Teabo said, who notes success points up the virulence of the trend.\n\u201cThe percentages we report reflect only provable fraud,\u201d he said, \u201cmeaning confirmed cases identified through our verification processes, and do not include applicants who abandon the leasing process for fraud-related or other reasons.\u201d\nLandlords big and small will have to pay the freight on fraud prevention for the foreseeable future, according to Caren Maio, CEO of multifamily fraud prevention platform 100.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Wild West,\u201d Maio said. \u201cMaking, selling and using fake IDs is illegal, but many counterfeiters operate overseas and accept cryptocurrency or gift cards to evade U.S. law enforcement.\u201d\nAt the state level, a number of housing experts said there is no point in filing a complaint.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way any police agency in the state of California will go after a tenant, be it for even giving a counterfeit cashier\u2019s check, which is a federal crime,\u201d said attorney Dennis Block, who specializes in representing landlords on evictions. \u201cThey won\u2019t go after that. They won\u2019t go after tremendous damage to the property, which is vandalism, which is a felony in the state of California. They won\u2019t do \u2014 nothing.\u201d\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation reviews complaints on a national level, but prosecutions are rare, especially when the schemes have international ties, an agency spokesperson said.\n\u201cThe lost funds can\u2019t be recovered, and an arrest can\u2019t be made but we do urge reporting,\u201d she said.\nThe barrier of entry for fraudsters remains low as the feds take a passive approach to the problem.\nIdentity fraud can start at as little as $4 for a Social Security number on the dark web, and go up to $5,000 for a physical passport, according to an investigation by Atlas VPN based on Flashpoint Intelligence research findings between 2017 and 2019 cited by\nForbes\n.\nMeanwhile, the bad guys are moving on to the next big thing.\u201cIt used to be just folks doing this at their own home,\u201d said Berlind of Snappt. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s crime rings that are literally creating these entire fraudulent packages for folks \u2026 and, obviously, AI is certainly helping advance their missions.\u201d\n",

CBRE broker Tom Svoboda is leading the marketing property.\nThe 27,400-square-foot parcel, near the Harold Washington Library, is offered without a list price. Lennar bought the site in 2019 for roughly $18.3 million and has already spent about $2 million prepping it for construction, CBRE said. Neither Lennar nor Quarterra returned the outlet\u2019s requests for comment on the listing.\nThe listing comes as Chicago\u2019s downtown apartment pipeline is on track to hit its lowest delivery volume in nearly three decades by the end of this year, despite high demand among renters.\nDevelopers are facing stubborn headwinds: high borrowing costs, escalating construction expenses and institutional investors pulling back from the city.\nThe scarcity of new supply could work in favor of those who can still get deals done.\n\nClass A downtown rents climbed 6.4 percent year over year in the second quarter, according to Integra Realty Resources, reflecting strong demand and limited competition.\nThe Quarterra site\u2019s DX-16 zoning \u2014 the city\u2019s densest \u2014 allows up to 399 market-rate units with no affordable housing requirement, since developments that don\u2019t need City Council zoning approval aren\u2019t subject to Chicago\u2019s 20 percent affordability mandate.\nThe Lennar affiliate sold a 5,200-unit portfolio to\nKKR last summer\nfor about $2.1 billion and has been shopping other holdings since late 2023, when Lennar executives said they were exploring offloading the company\u2019s 11,000-unit apartment portfolio. Quarterra also sold properties in River North and Oak Park last year.\nThe\nSouth Loop\nsite \u2014 zoned for residential, hotel, office, medical or retail use \u2014 offers potential skyline and lake views and proximity to Grant Park. The area has seen renewed investor interest, with DAC Developments and Melrose Ascension Capital recently landing financing for a nearby tower at 626 South Wabash and plans advancing for a Chicago Fire FC stadium a few blocks south.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Downtown Dallas\u2019 third-tallest tower is getting a second act.\nSlate Asset Management and Stream Realty Partners are teaming up to redevelop the 60-story\nComerica Bank Tower\ninto a mixed-use hub that aims to reenergize the city\u2019s Main Street corridor, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nToronto-based Slate, which bought the 1.5 million-square-foot building at 1717 Main Street last year, plans to add residential, hotel and retail space while preserving a portion of the offices.\nDallas-based Stream, which is overseeing redevelopment and leasing, said the project will reconfigure about 600,000 square feet of office space on floors 19 through 42, with roughly half the tower repurposed for other uses.\nA 242-key hotel is slated for floors nine through 18, topped by 240 apartments \u201410 percent of which will be designated affordable \u2014 and more than 10,000 square feet of ground-floor retail. The design by\nDallas-based HKS\ntakes advantage of the tower\u2019s three existing lobbies, creating separate entrances for office tenants, residents and hotel guests.\n\u201cFortunately, the building lays out extraordinarily well for introducing multiple uses,\u201d Stream\u2019s Ramsey March told the outlet, adding that the plan is meant to bring \u201caround-the-clock activity\u201d back to a downtown long dominated by vacant office floors.\n\nThe 1987 tower, designed by\nPhillip Johnson\n, is half-leased, with Comerica Bank occupying much of the space. The bank\u2019s lease runs through 2028, but its future in the building is murky following its pending acquisition by Fifth Third Bank. Stream hopes Comerica stays put but isn\u2019t counting on it.\nHKS, which also designed AT&amp;T Stadium and Bass Performance Hall, plans to retain Johnson\u2019s signature arches and barrel vaults while modernizing interiors and public areas.\nA controversial piece of the redesign is an eight-story parking podium that would replace the existing banking hall and plaza along Ervay Street.\nStream reworked the structure after criticism from the city\u2019s Urban Design Peer Review Panel, adding a glass-and-fluted fa\u00e7ade and rooftop ballroom and pool deck. The podium will add about 400 spaces to the 700 already underground \u2014 a boost March said is essential to the site\u2019s long-term viability.\nStream hopes to start construction by next summer, pending City Council approval and additional tax increment financing. The two-year project will involve\nBalfour Beatty\nas general contractor and Mike Paneri Consulting on hotel strategy.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Units at the development are no longer being listed online as available for rent.\nThe complex, renamed Skyline OC, consists of two 25-story buildings with 350 units. Crescent Heights\u2019 purchase for $685,000 per unit from San Mateo-based Essex Property Trust was the most-expensive local multifamily trade of the past year, the outlet said.\nThe units for sale include one- and two-bedroom units as well as some penthouses. Prices are expected to range from $600,000 to $3 million, but current listings are between $850,000 and $1.3 million. Homeowners\u2019 association dues cost about $1,100 per month.\nAmenities include a pool and spa, a full fitness center, yoga studio and lounge, as well as an acre of outdoor living space.\n\nThe complex was built in 2008 by Santa Ana-based Nexus Development, originally planned as a condominium, costing $350 million to build. Nexus left the project amid the Great Recession.\nEssex and an unidentified partner bought a stake in the property in a 2010 deal that valued the complex at about $128 million. The company then\nconverted the residential towers from condo units to rentals\n. Two years later, Essex bought the remaining 50 percent from its partner in a transaction that placed the property\u2019s value at $170 million.\nThe Skyline towers maintained a 94 percent occupancy rate as of this spring, prior to Crescent Heights\u2019 purchase.\nThe median\nhome price\nfor an \u201cattached\u201d home, such as a condo or townhome, in Orange County is $733,000, according to Orange County Realtors.

        "content": "Sotherly Hotels defaulted on its $49.2 million loan on a Hollywood resort near the ocean.\nThe debt on the 10-story DoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hollywood Beach with 311 keys, at 4000 South Ocean Drive, entered special servicing after missing the Oct. 1 due date to pay off the loan, according to Morningstar Credit and Sotherly\u2019s second quarter Securities and Exchange Commission filing.\nThe recent default comes as Sotherly has been facing past due and impending maturities on some of its hotel loans, prompting the firm to seek extensions from lenders or face hefty paydowns on principal amid a difficult refinancing market. Williamsburg, Virginia-based Sotherly is a publicly traded real estate investment trust led by CEO Dave Folsom.\nIts debt woes come amid a higher interest rate environment that\u2019s led some lenders to retrench from issuing new loans and refinancings while they work through forbearance agreements and maturity extensions on existing debt. Generally, banks, which are under strict federal oversight, have to maintain a\nminimum of capital\nand clean up delinquencies before issuing new loans.\nSotherly didn\u2019t return a request for comment. But its public filings shed light on how it\u2019s tackling its loan issues.\nOn Monday, the firm announced it will be acquired under a merger agreement with Memphis-based Kemmons Wilson Hospitality Partners and Los Angeles-based\nAscendant Capital Partners\n. Kemmons Wilson and Ascendant Capital will pay $2.25 per share for all outstanding Sotherly common stock, marking a 152.7 percent premium over Sotherly\u2019s share price on Friday. The deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter, is valued at $425 million,\nHotel Investment Today reported\n.\nIn its second quarter filing, Sotherly also outlined how it plans to tackle the Hollywood hotel maturity, saying it will ask the lender for an extension. If it\u2019s unable to push the maturity on the loan, it would have to seek refinancing, Sotherly said in the filing.\nBut to refinance, lenders often require a paydown of the principal to reduce their risk. In that case, Sotherly expects it would have to pay down the debt by up to $12.3 million \u201cbased on current and anticipated financial performance\u201d of the property, the firm said in its filing.\nSotherly\u2019s recent merger could help with the paydown. Under the agreement, Kemmons Wilson will immediately provide Sotherly with a $25 million revolving line of credit at a floating interest rate, according to public filings.\n\nThe DoubleTree in Hollywood is on a strip home to\nupscale\nhotels and condo-hotels sandwiched between the Atlantic Ocean and Intracoastal Waterway. Near the DoubleTree, Sotherly also owns the 57-key Lyfe Resort &amp; Residences at 4111 South Ocean Drive and 68-key\nHyde Beach House Resort &amp; Residences\nat 4010 South Ocean Drive. Both are\ncondo-hotels\n.\nSotherly bought the DoubleTree in Hollywood in 2007 for $74 million, records show. The building was completed in 1973 and renovated in 2000, 2008 and most recently in 2017, when Sotherly brought it under Hilton\u2019s DoubleTree flag.\nIn 2015, Sotherly scored a $57 million loan from Bank of America, bumping up the principal to $60 million later that year. Sotherly refinanced in 2021 with a group of lenders, including Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Merrill Lynch. The loan has an interest rate of 4.9 percent and the balance is down to $49.2 million, according to the SEC filing and Morningstar Credit.\nThe REIT has faced on-and-off debt woes on the Hollywood property for years. In December of last year, the property had a debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) for net cash flow, a reflection of a landlord\u2019s ability to meet debt obligations, of 0.97x, Morningstar Credit data shows. A DSCR of 1x is considered the breakeven threshold. The DSCR increased to 1.15x in June.\nThe loan first went into special servicing shortly after the onset of the pandemic in 2020, when mandatory lockdowns battered the hospitality industry. The loan exited special servicing in 2021, according to Morningstar Credit.\nIn 2023, the hotel was in trouble again because its performance declined below a threshold required by the lender, triggering a \u201ccash trap\u201d provision under the financing agreement that mandated all revenue be deposited into a cash management account for the benefit of the lender, according to this year\u2019s second quarter filing. This summer, the DoubleTree in Hollywood\u2019s performance improved, allowing it to exit the \u201ccash trap\u201d predicament.\nLast year, the hotel\u2019s occupancy averaged 68 percent, according to Morningstar Credit.\nThis summer, Sotherly also defaulted on a nearly $38 million loan on its 326-key Georgian Terrace hotel in Atlanta. The firm requested a one-year extension on the loan and if it\u2019s unsuccessful, it would have to refinance and expects to pay down about $4 million of the debt, according to its second quarter filing.\nNext year, the loans on Sotherly\u2019s DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport and The DeSoto in Savannah, Georgia, are scheduled to mature.\n",

Thompson Center \u2014 and debt maturity is at play.\nChicago-based Ameritus listed the office portion of 121 West Wacker Drive for sale, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n, citing marketing materials from Cushman &amp; Wakefield. Brokers Tom Sitz and Cody Hundertmark are leading the campaign to find a buyer for the 41-story, 426,000-square-foot property.\nAmeritus refinanced it in early 2022 with a $71.3 million loan from German lender\nDeutsche Pfandbriefbank\n. That loan has since matured, and sources told the outlet that the parties are working on a potential sale to resolve the debt.\nAmeritus Partner Jeb Scherb said the firm could pursue a recapitalization if a new investor comes aboard.\nThe Art Deco building \u2014 completed in 1929 and updated by Sterling Bay before Ameritus bought it for $118.5 million in 2018 \u2014 is now valued well below its last trade, given the punishing drop in downtown office demand and higher borrowing costs that have chilled investment activity.\n\nThe property\u2019s proximity to the redeveloped Riverwalk and Google\u2019s $280 million Thompson Center overhaul are catalysts for future leasing momentum, according to marketing materials.\nStill, any buyer would be wading into\nchoppy waters\n. The tower is just 63 percent leased, below the roughly 72 percent average across downtown Chicago, and far off the 90 percent occupancy rate it boasted when\nAmeritus\ntook ownership.\nThe listing adds to the growing list of downtown towers under stress as hybrid work reshapes the office landscape. Many landlords are working with lenders on discounted payoffs or joint sales as loans mature and valuations sink. Some buyers have swooped in to reposition buildings through new capital and leasing pushes, while others are content to wait for the market to stabilize before reinvesting.\nAmeritus\u2019\ntiming may also reflect its lender\u2019s shifting priorities. PBB announced in June that it plans to wind down its U.S. operations and refocus on European markets. A sale of 121 West Wacker could untether it from one of its last stateside positions: a well-maintained, riverfront asset surrounded by billions in new investment that could rebound faster than many of its distressed peers.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A mostly empty office tower in\nFar North Dallas\nis headed for the auction block, setting the stage for a potential redevelopment play.\nPreston Plaza, a 10-story, 260,000-square-foot building at 17950 Preston Road, will be auctioned between Nov. 10 and 12 with opening bids starting at $2.25 million, or $8.65 per square foot, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nCushman &amp; Wakefield is advising on the sale. The 35 percent-leased property sits on a 6.3-acre parcel that brokers are marketing as a rare chance to reposition a struggling office asset or\nreimagine it\nentirely.\nThe site, which includes a structured parking garage, offers \u201cstrategic in-place zoning to minimize entitlement risk,\u201d Cushman\u2019s listing states, allowing redevelopment for multifamily, hotel or retail uses.\nCushman Director Matt Murphy told the outlet that the building presents a chance for investors to \u201clease up the property at a reset basis\u201d in a corridor with tight supply and strong fundamentals. Murphy said that comparable buildings in the vicinity are roughly 90 percent leased, and that the recently passed\nSenate Bill 840\n\u2014 which took effect Sept. 1 throughout Texas \u2014 could streamline residential conversions.\n\nBuilt in the late 1980s and renovated in 2015, the building counts Republic Title, Veritex Bank and Texas Health Surgery Center among its tenants.\nThe building has been recently plagued by financial distress. After falling into receivership in 2024, the property changed hands in April when an entity tied to real estate credit firm\nK-Star Asset Management\npicked it up at a foreclosure auction for $13.85 million. The Collin County Appraisal District most recently valued it at $35 million for tax purposes.\nWhile Uptown continues to absorb tenants and attract new development \u2014 capturing nearly three-quarters of the metro\u2019s 2.7 million-square-foot construction pipeline \u2014 older suburban properties such as Preston Plaza in Far North Dallas are fighting to stay relevant amid high vacancies and shifting tenant preferences.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "13th Floor Investments and its partners scored a $139 million refinancing for a 420-unit apartment complex in Delray Beach, amid a continuing lending flurry in South Florida.\nCoconut Grove-based 13th Floor, Brickell-based Key International, West Palm Beach-based Wexford Real Estate Investors and Boca Raton-based CDS International completed the Savio apartment complex last year at 1874 Heron Club Drive, according to records. CIBC USA provided the loan, according to a Newmark news release.\nJordan Roeschlaub and Nick Scribani were part of the Newmark team that represented the developers.\nSavio consists of three-story and five-story apartment buildings and rental townhomes. It offers studios, and one-bedroom to three-bedroom units, its website shows. Monthly rents range from $2,124 to $4,508.\nSavio is offering would-be tenants up to six weeks free, according to its website. That\u2019s consistent with landlords offering concessions to entice tenants amid an apartmen\nt supply overhang\nin South Florida.\nThe refinancing pays the balance of the\n$102 million\nconstruction loan the developers scored in 2022, also from CIBC, according to records.\nSavio is part of the larger mixed-use master-planned Parks at Delray project that will span 50 acres on the southwest corner of South Congress Avenue and Old Germantown Road.\n\nConstruction of the second phase, consisting of the 327-unit Skye, is expected to start this year, the release says. The project also could include commercial space such as retail and dining and a 1.5-acre park, according to media reports.\nThe developers paid a combined\n$33 million\nfor the Parks at Delray development assemblage in late 2018, including $20 million for the property for the project\u2019s first phase.\n13th Floor, led by Arnaud Karsenti, has developed some of Miami-Dade County\u2019s marquee condo towers and more recently has focused on public-private partnerships to redevelop transit stations. In May, the firm and Barings scored a\n$125 million\nconstruction loan for the 35-story, 432-unit Cadence apartment tower at 13th Floor\u2019s larger Link at Douglas mixed-use project adjacent to the Douglas Road Metrorail Station in Coconut Grove. 13th Floor leases the site from Miami-Dade.\nThe firm and the Ardid family\u2019s Key International are frequent partners. In their latest planned project, the duo want to develop an\n80-story condo\ntower behind First Miami Presbyterian Church at 609 Brickell Avenue in Miami\u2019s Brickell.\nKey International, led by brothers\nInigo and Diego Ardid\nand started by their father, Jose Ardid, traces its roots in condo and hotel development and expanded to rentals. In 2023, it proposed the 51-story, 750,000-square-foot\n848 Brickell\noffice tower at 848 Brickell Avenue in Miami.\nWexford is led by Joseph Jacobs and Philip Braunstein, according to its website. CDS International is entrepreneur Carl DeSantis\u2019 family office.\nSouth Florida refinancings have continued, despite\nhigher interest rates\nand some retrenching by lenders. This month, Crescent Heights scored a\n$238.4 million\nrefinancing for the 40-story, 588-unit Forma Miami completed last year at 2900 Biscayne Boulevard in Miami\u2019s Edgewater. Also this month, Resident Group scored\n$113.8 million\nto refinance its 32-story, 279-unit Metro Edgewater completed in 2023 at 452 Northeast 31st Street in Edgewater.\n",

        "content": "A home at an exclusive club on Geneva Lake sold for $7 million in an off-market transaction this month as real estate in the Wisconsin resort town shows no signs of slowing.\nThe 6,000 square-foot home at N1561 East Lakeside Lane in Linn, Wisconsin, is part of the South Shore Club community. Located on the former campus of the Northwestern Military Academy on the southwest end of the lake, the 40-acre development has about 40 homes that share a private beach.\nHomeowners also share docks and boats, with a staff that keeps boats fueled and maintained and will drive homeowners around the lake if requested. The club also has a pool, pickleball and tennis courts and other amenities, supported by a $2,350-per-month fee.\nThe convenience of South Shore Club\u2019s maintenance-free shared amenities has attracted buyers who sold their lakefront houses, said Tricia Forbeck, a Compass agent who represented the seller.\n\u201cEverything\u2019s at your fingertips, and you don\u2019t have to do anything,\u201d Forbeck said of the community.\nThe house is one of the priciest to sell around the lake in recent years. Another home in the same development\nsold in August for $10.1 million\nafter the buyer made an unsolicited offer to purchase the house.\nForbeck marketed the $7 million house privately for about 10 days and showed it to about eight potential buyers before receiving an offer. The offer came in mid-September, and the sale closed on Monday.\n\nThe buyer was represented by David Curry of Geneva Lakefront Realty, who did not respond to a request for comment.\nForbeck declined to identify the seller. Property records show the home was previously owned under a trust associated with Todd Mintz, who bought the property in 2018 for $2.7 million. Mintz paid about $31,800 in property taxes last year, county records show. Records that could identify the buyer are not yet available.\nForbeck said the seller put significant work into updating and improving the house, which needed maintenance when it was bought in 2018.\nAbout a 90 minute drive from Chicago, Lake Geneva is a favorite second-home location for city residents. Recent lakefront listings in the community have been grabbed up fast by eager buyers. Just this month, two other homes\nclosed for $8.7 million\nand\n$8.6 million\nafter going under contract in a matter of days.\nA handful of other\nlistings hit the market\nin September and found buyers in just a few days.\n\u201cDemand is over the top, and there\u2019s not much inventory,\u201d Forbeck said. \u201cThere\u2019s right now only two lakefronts on the market that aren\u2019t under contract.\u201d\n",

        "content": "China Construction Bank is seeking a buyer for a loan tied to a Class A office building in Oakland.\nThe Beijing-based financial institution is selling a $59 million loan secured by the 1333 Broadway building in downtown Oakland, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nThe debt amounts to about $242 per square foot.\nThe 10-story, 244,000-square-foot property has been owned by\nSwift Real Estate Partners\nsince 2019, when it purchased the building from CIM Group for $115 million, or $454 per square foot. That price was normal for the time, when offices were selling for as much as $550 per square foot.\nThe building is 74 percent occupied.\nDelta Dental is the building\u2019s anchor tenant\nwith 128,300 square feet, taking up more than half of the building\u2019s available space across two leases. Elsewhere in the building, a lease for 117,900 square feet is slated to expire in 2028 and a 24,500-square-foot lease is up in 2036.\nThe building sits on top of the 12th Street BART station and is adjacent to the Oakland City Center mixed-use development. On the ground floor, Walgreens has a 13,700-square-foot lease through October 2044. The pharmacy generated $14.8 million of contractual net operating income through May of this year.\n\nA buyer who purchases the debt could be in a position to acquire the property itself via a deed in lieu of foreclosure. In that situation, the property could sell at a significant loss. Other recent distress sales have amounted to $60 to $100 per square foot.\nEarlier this month, for example, 2001 Broadway sold to a private investor for $4.5 million, or $88 per square foot. In January, 1440 Broadway\nsold to Frontline Realty Capital\nfor $5.2 million, or $58 per square foot, after the lender seized ownership of the property from Tidewater Capital in July 2023.\nNonperforming debt tied to three Swift-owned office properties in California, Oregon and Washington also\nhit the market this month\n. That includes the 340,600-square-foot Mount Diablo Plaza in Walnut Creek.\nSwift also owns 1111 Broadway, a 568,000-square-foot building in downtown Oakland. It purchased the property in 2021 for $327.5 million, or $576 per square foot \u2014 one of the last office sales before building values took a post-pandemic nosedive.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",
