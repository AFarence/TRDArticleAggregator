        "content": "Cohen Brothers Realty\u2019s Charles Cohen, cover of foreclosure complaint and aerial of dev site at 850 South Dixie Highway in West Palm Beach\nA lender is seeking to foreclose on the site of a stalled office project in West Palm Beach by Charles Cohen, adding more woes to the New York-based billionaire developer.\nOn Monday, Union Labor Life Insurance Company sued an affiliate of Cohen\u2019s New York-based\nCohen Brothers Realty Corporation\nin Palm Beach County Circuit Court, according to real estate database Vizzda and court records.\nThe foreclosure complaint alleges the\nCohen\naffiliate defaulted on a $10 million loan issued in 2022, by allegedly failing to repay the mortgage by a May 4 maturity date. The lawsuit also names the West Palm Beach Community Redevelopment Agency, or CRA, as a defendant.\nThe CRA owns the 2.4-acre property at 801 South Dixie Highway, and entered into a ground lease in 2020 with the Cohen affiliate, which is planning\nWest Palm Point\n, a 23-story tower with 352,000 square feet of offices and 25,000 square feet of ground-floor retail, records show.\n\nCohen Brothers has not been served with any foreclosure filing, \u201cbut our lender has confirmed that the foreclosure complaint is being withdrawn immediately,\u201d Cohen Brothers Senior Vice President Ross Cohen told\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\u201cWe are in the process of refinancing the existing loan via our project financing, which is closing imminently,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThe existing loan is also in the process of being extended in the interim.\u201d\nMichael Woodbury, an attorney representing Union Labor, did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe Cohen affiliate filed a notice of commencement for West Palm Point last year, records show. Ross Cohen said the firm plans to break ground soon.\nThe West Palm Point foreclosure complaint is the latest headache for Cohen, whose net worth Forbes pegs at $1.6 billion. In New York, Cohen Brothers last month struck a deal to sell a distressed office building at 623 Fifth Avenue for\n$188 million\n, as part of its efforts to repay a $187 million judgment to Fortress Investment Group. A portion of the sale proceeds would cover some of the debt owed to Fortress.\nAnother lender won a foreclosure judgment in July for Cohen\u2019s Midtown East, a 31-story office tower at 750 Lexington Avenue that was recently valued at\n$41 million\n. That\u2019s more than an 85 percent drop from the property\u2019s $300 million valuation in 2015, according to Morningstar Credit.",

The development will feature one- and two-bedroom units and parking for 54 vehicles. All apartments will be reserved for low- and moderate-income households; in Los Angeles County, that\u2019s a maximum of $89,550.\nThe project is a joint venture between Meta Housing and the Foundation for Affordable Housing, according to the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee. Y&amp;M Architects is handling designs for the development. The estimated budget is $124.7 million, or $315,800 per unit.\nThe developer is using the city\u2019s\nfast track for affordable housing\napprovals. To the east in Reseda, another affordable housing project is on the fast track: a six-story, 95-unit apartment building by JZA Architecture and developer Efi Meirson to replace four rent-controlled cottages.\n\nMeta Housing is also mid-construction on an affordable housing complex at\n21300 West Oxnard Street\n. That project will feature 301 studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments with parking for 229 cars.

The property at 16000 Cambridge Street sold for $83 million and contains a mix of market-rate and affordable apartments for seniors.

        "content": "The artificial intelligence sector in San Francisco is juicing up local office demand.\nOffice leasing from AI firms is expected to accelerate in the coming months, with no break in a trendline that has seen demand from the sector more than double in the past year, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n, citing a new report from real estate software company\nVTS\n.\n\u201cOver the past month, in particular, we\u2019ve seen much larger tenant demand enter the market in San Francisco, so it\u2019s much more concentrated in that 50,000 square-foot-plus cohort,\u201d Max Saia, head of investor research at VTS, told the Business Times. \u201cWe saw some rather large users enter the market.\u201d\nAnthropic, for example,\njust leased\nabout 100,000 square feet of offices across several floors at the Foundry Square III building in downtown. That adds to its headquarters footprint of more than 230,000 square feet across the street at Foundry Square IV.\nOpen AI, meanwhile, has similarly\nbeen on a tear in San Francisco\nin recent years. In 2023, the Sam Altman-led giant subleased nearly 500,000 square feet of offices from Uber at 1455 and 1515 Third Street in Mission Bay. The following year, it picked up\nanother 315,000 square feet\nnext door at 550 Terry A. Francois Boulevard. As it stands, the ChatGPT creator boasts more than 1 million square feet of offices in the city.\n\nNew tenants entering the San Francisco office market have sought an average of 34,000 square feet, the Business Times reported.\n\u201cWhile New York showcases resilient growth within its diverse industry base, San Francisco presents an even more dramatic, tech-concentrated boom, with office demand skyrocketing since the public release of ChatGPT and the cascading demand for AI that was created,\u201d Saia said.\nAs of last month, San Francisco saw a 107 percent year-over-year increase in office demand \u2014 up more than 350 percent since ChatGPT was first released to the public in late 2022, according to the Business Times.\nSan Francisco and the Bay Area are expected to see an influx of more than 50,000 workers in the AI sector by 2030,\naccording\nto a recent report from CBRE. At the same time, office space used by AI firms is predicted to quadruple from 5 million square feet to 21 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

A joint venture between Los Angeles-based Steerpoint Capital and San Mateo-based Steelwave bought the 727,000-square-foot main portion of the property.\nThe mall at 2525 El Camino Real spans a total 1.1 million square feet. The purchase doesn\u2019t include the mall\u2019s anchor tenants such as\nMacy\u2019s\nand JCPenney.

At the $71.5 million price point, or $98 per square foot, Steerpoint and Steelwave picked up the property for a bargain.\nArchway Capital provided the buyers with a $42.9 million acquisition loan, according to CO. Of that, $4 million is set aside for capital improvements such as entrance upgrades, new common area seating and renovated restrooms. It marks Archway\u2019s largest loan transaction to date, per CO.\n\n\u201cThis acquisition highlights our strategy of securing high-quality assets at a low basis in markets with undeniable strength,\u201d Jack Steger, director of investment and development at Steerpoint, said in a statement, per CO.\nOther Southern California malls that have sold recently were transactions with notably higher prices per square foot.

        "content": "Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s plan to reset committee leadership and recalibrate his alliances landed dead on arrival Thursday as Chicago City Council wouldn\u2019t provide the 26 votes necessary to fill several vacancies.\nJohnson\u2019s plan was to fill the opening left by Chicago City Council dean Walter Burnett\u2019s retirement with progressives that might appease criticism from both the Latino Caucus and Black Caucus, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Although Burnett\u2019s replacement \u2014 his son, 29-year-old Walter \u201cRed\u201d Burnett \u2014 was unanimously confirmed to take over the 27th Ward seat, no committee chairmanships were voted on.\nThe biggest prize \u2014 chair of the zoning committee \u2014 Johnson slated for 1st Ward Alderman Daniel La Spata, a progressive who helped Johnson push through a landmark ordinance slashing parking requirements for\ntransit-oriented developments\n, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n. A cycling advocate known for championing protected bike lanes, La Spata is set to lead high-stakes negotiations with developers that shape the city\u2019s growth and housing pipeline.\nIf confirmed, La Spata would have sidelined 44th Ward Alderman Bennett Lawson, who\u2019d been serving as interim chair since the fall but was deemed too green to keep the role. Kennedy Bartley, the mayor\u2019s chief of external affairs, told the outlet that La Spata\u2019s efforts around parking minimums and other reforms made it easier to\nbuild housing\nin the city.\n\nWhoever ends up as chair of zoning will lead discussions with developers and either help push Johnson\u2019s effort to increase the speed of affordable housing development or come at odds with it. The city is still\nshort\nof an estimated 120,000 affordable units currently needed in the community, leaving the mayor to bet that La Spata can drive reforms to speed up housing construction.\nThe other key move in Johnson\u2019s plan was for 37th Ward Alderman Emma Mitts to replace Burnett as vice mayor. The veteran alderman has a long and sometimes fraught history with Johnson, including a very public spat last year when she accused him of reneging on a promised housing committee\nchairmanship\n. Burnett\u2019s version of the vice mayor role came with a $400,000 budget and an assignment as Johnson\u2019s political envoy; Mitts, who has criticized the mayor\u2019s handling of council relations, said she didn\u2019t expect the same perks and vowed to keep her independence.\nOther stalled moves included who would take La Spata\u2019s pedestrian and traffic safety committee. Johnson wanted that to shift to 40th Ward Alderman Andre Vasquez, a frequent Johnson critic who led the charge against the mayor\u2019s failed $300 million property tax hike during last year\u2019s bruising budget battle. Vasquez\u2019s former committee, immigrant and refugee rights, would then have been chaired by first-year 26th Ward Alderman Jessie Fuentes, a close Johnson ally. The contracting oversight and equity committee, previously held by Mitts, was proposed for 17th Ward Alderman David Moore to take over.\nThe planned reshuffle provided a glimpse into Johnson\u2019s effort to both shore up his base and placate critics. But critics were unappeased, pushing votes on committee chairmanships further into the fall.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Greg Abbott sees it, the state is primed for a massive influx of data center and AI-related investments unlike any so far.\nAbbott said diversifying the state economy with nontraditional industries was paramount, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\u00a0 Abbott\u2019s remarks, at a Texas Economic Development investor summit this week, came amid Oracle\u2019s plans with OpenAI and SoftBank to invest $400 billion over the next three years to open AI data centers across the country, in a joint venture dubbed \u201cProject Stargate.\u201d\nThe first Stargate campus opened in Abilene earlier this year.\nAbbott teased to-be-announced AI-related investments coming soon to\nTexas\n, which he claimed could be bigger than Stargate.\nFive more Stargate centers are on tap, including locations in Shackleford County and Milam County in Texas, as well as Lordstown, Ohio and Do\u00f1a Ana County, New Mexico. Another is planned for the midwest.\nSeven gigawatts of capacity for AI-related data processing will be reached once all five are completed, along with 25,000 onsite jobs and thousands of ancillary positions across the country.\n\nThe data center in Abilene is projected to consume 6 GW, nearly double the daily usage of the Texas Rio Grande Valley, for example.\nPlentiful land and infrastructure has made Texas a hub for data centers, according to CBRE. The Dallas-Fort Worth metro has about one-tenth of the U.S. data center market, the largest share after Northern Virginia. But power capacity is a\nchief concern\n. Abbott said the state produces more electricity than any other, generating 12 percent of the nation\u2019s total.\nIData Center equating to more than a gigawatt of capacity are under construction in Dallas-Fort Worth, said Curt Holcomb, managing director for data center solutions at JLL. Holcomb estimated another four gigawatts are in planning stages.\nHow that fares against the increased need for water and electricity created by these data centers remains to be seen, with\ndata computing\nexpected to increase electricity demand by 7 percent this year and 15 percent in 2026 according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\nSome developers are proposing electricity production\u00a0 along with the whole data center package. Fermi Inc., the real estate investment trust co-founded by former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, is pitching\n\u201cProject Matador\u201d\non land owned by Texas Tech University, a 5,000-acre advanced energy and intelligence campus aiming to attract data center and hyperscaler tenants, with plans for 11 gigawatts of power by 2038 from natural gas, solar, and nuclear sources.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "\u201cMember deference\u201d is not dead, but it cracked more than ever on Thursday.\nThe City Council, in an unprecedented move, voted twice at the same meeting to approve real estate projects over the objections of the local Council members.\nThe two most recent examples of this break from Council custom had been single votes in 2021 and 2009.\nOne of Thursday\u2019s votes was expected, as Council leaders had\nmade clear\nearlier in the week that the chamber would approve\n58 units of supportive housing\nin the Bronx for people just released from incarceration.\nIn that case, the overwhelming Democratic chamber defied Republican Kristy Marmorato, who in 2023\nousted a Democratic incumbent\nin part by campaigning against the project. Mayor Eric Adams, who is warring with Council leaders, also opposed the Bronx project after previously supporting it.\nBecause of that unique set of circumstances, the Council\u2019s action does not necessarily signal an increased willingness to buck the local member.\nThe other vote, on a more typical project, came a bit out of the blue. It may be more relevant to the real estate industry, which for decades has been held hostage by the local Council member on rezonings because the other 50 members nearly always parrot their colleague\u2019s vote.\nBy a vote of 37 to 8, members approved a\nrezoning\nto allow 53 units of affordable housing for seniors at 1946 East Seventh Street in Homecrest, a block from Ocean Parkway.\nOne of the \u201cno\u201d votes was from that district\u2019s representative, the conservative, convivial Democrat Simcha Felder. Some neighbors of the project site were opposed to the seven-story project, calling it too big. It will replace two vacant, four-story apartment buildings built in 1925.\n\nSome NIMBY opposition is almost always inevitable, even for utterly harmless projects like the one proposed for East Seventh Street by Ahi Ezer Congregation, an Orthodox Jewish organization. Felder is also Orthodox, and is at no risk of losing his seat, yet he folded like a cheap suit at the behest of the noisy neighbors.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good project,\u201d one of Felder\u2019s colleagues texted\nThe Real Deal\nmoments after the vote. \u201cI\u2019m glad we passed it.\u201d\nAffordable housing for seniors is among the easiest uses to get through the Council. Letting people on fixed incomes age in place appeals to progressives and conservatives alike. Local opposition is generally muted because elderly people are quiet and law-abiding, and don\u2019t contribute to traffic congestion or school or subway crowding.\nStill, Community Board 15 voted 32-0 against the application for East Seventh Street, calling the project\u2019s height \u201cdetrimental to the community in terms of congestion, traffic, and the shadows it will cause on neighboring properties.\u201d\n\u201cIt is way out of character for the neighborhood,\u201d the board concluded in a characteristic, knee-jerk reaction to any increase in housing density.\nAhi Ezer\u2019s proposal was supported by Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and the City Planning Commission. \u201cThe change in zoning from R5 to R6A/R7A will facilitate much needed senior affordable housing in the area,\u201d Reynoso\u2019s recommendation stated.\nBut the override of Felder had more to do with outgoing Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, who vowed early in her tenure that the chamber would increase housing production, and with the chamber\u2019s Progressive Caucus, which has embraced \u201cabundance\u201d as an answer to the housing shortage.\nThursday\u2019s votes were a promising sign that the Council is more willing than ever to put the city\u2019s housing shortage ahead of narrow-minded neighbors and their local representative.\n",

        "content": "The\nair rights revolution\nwas just getting started when\nThe Real Deal\ncovered it in June. At that time, however, the evidence was anecdotal.\nNow we have data.\nDevelopment rights transfers are on pace to increase by 39 percent this year and to reach their highest level since 2016, according to PropertyScout CEO Wilson Parry.\nThe jump will actually be much higher, broker Bob Knakal predicted, because so many deals are pending.\n\u201cIt\u2019s off the charts,\u201d Knakal said. \u201cBy the end of the year it\u2019s going to be triple what it was last year.\u201d\n\u201cThe assemblage game has totally changed.\u201d\nWilson Parry, PropertyScout\nCredit the\nCity of Yes\nlegislation, passed last fall, which\ngreatly increased\nproperty owners\u2019 ability to sell their unused development rights, and last month\u2019s\nMidtown South rezoning\n, which gave buildings in the neighborhood more of them to sell.\nCity of Yes eased air-rights transfers for split districts and landmarked properties, and introduced more flexible zoning envelopes, giving developers more ability to use air rights.\nFor example, to build a tower on an Upper East Side avenue, one can now purchase development rights from scores of townhomes on lower-density side streets nearby.\nA typical Upper East Side townhouse might have 2,000 to 4,000 square feet of unused air rights, sometimes more. That can add two to four apartments to a project that buys them.\nA development site can also now shop for landmarked properties\u2019 air rights from an area about 10 times larger than before.\n\u201cYou used to have two or three potential buyers of your air rights,\u201d Knakal said. \u201cNow you have 30 or 40.\u201d\nLandmark air rights are said to be selling for $180 to $400 per square foot of zoning floor area, meaning buildable square footage, but generally for $200 to $250. If a developer has a site worth $500 a foot, and can buy air rights for $250 a foot, the path to a deal is clear.\nThe other two types of transfers liberalized by the City of Yes were Zoning Law Development Agreements, or ZLDAs (pronounced zeldas), and special district transfers. The latter might allow a Theater District property to sell development rights to any of several dozen parcels.\nTo take advantage of the changes, Genessy Jaramillo, a managing director at Knakal\u2019s shop, BKREA, is exclusively working on air-rights deals. \u201cIt\u2019s on fire,\u201d said. \u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer to be in this niche right now.\u201d\nDevelopers and investment sales brokers, not property owners, are driving the activity. Many owners don\u2019t even know they have air rights to sell, or that they can now transfer them to parcels farther away than just next door or across the street.\nTheir ignorance is understandable. Air rights are an esoteric concept that few New Yorkers pay attention to, if they have heard of it at all. It never comes up in media appearances by Mayor Eric Adams because it is too far in the weeds for a general audience.\nAs a result, what the air rights revolution means for real estate and the city\u2019s skyline has been entirely overlooked by the mainstream media \u2014 and to a large extent by industry publications, too.\nNot by the industry, though.\n\n\u201cThe assemblage game has totally changed with this,\u201d Parry said. \u201cAny developer that\u2019s doing something in Manhattan is definitely keen to this.\u201d\nHe can see their excitement from the vantage point of his business. PropertyScout subscriptions have more than tripled in part because its software lets users see what unused air rights any Manhattan property has and where they can be transferred.\nParry has been fielding calls from users who reach the maximum number of daily property searches \u2014 typically 50 \u2014 allowed by their subscription tier and plead for an exception to see more.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a toy, what you built,\u201d one told him. \u201cIt\u2019s like a game.\u201d\nThe City of Yes has made the assemblage game more fun for builders and brokers. For example, clicking on a landmarked property now highlights a plethora of parcels that can buy its air rights, instead of merely several.\n\u201cIt went from four to six lots before City of Yes to like 60,\u201d Parry said. \u201cIt\u2019s a 10x increase.\u201d\nSurges in development-rights transfers previously occurred from 2005 to 2007 (averaging 115 per year) and from 2013 to 2016 (averaging 109), triggered by a combination of high land prices and rising applications for new buildings, Parry\nreported\non LinkedIn.\nThis year\u2019s projected total of 92 is probably understated, as Knakal noted, because transfers involving landmarked properties take longer than for the two other types. Dozens of these transfers are said to be in the works but had not been recorded yet when Parry tallied the numbers through Aug. 1.\n\u201cLandmark expansion hasn\u2019t shown up yet,\u201d Parry said, citing a certification step that delays deals. \u201cIt\u2019s lagging.\u201d\nPrior to the law changing, only 15 landmark transfers happened in 50 years. \u201cBefore the City of Yes, the landmarks transfer was a total failure,\u201d Parry said.\nNot only were transfer options limited to a few properties for each landmark, but the process was cumbersome and expensive. It required a special permit, which involves a public review and City Council approval.\nCertification is now much easier: The Department of City Planning takes the potential deal to the Landmarks Preservation Commission, which verifies that the seller has a plan to maintain the historic property.\n\u201cWhat used to take a couple of years now takes six to nine months,\u201d Knakal said, adding that a seller can close in 60 to 90 days and leave the certification process to the buyer.\nThe longtime broker, famed for his \u201cmap room\u201d of Manhattan properties, has charted every landmarked building south of 96th Street.\n\u201cWe\u2019re calling all those owners,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have real estate professionals selling air rights, institutions selling air rights, public companies selling air rights, and we have the proverbial little old ladies selling air rights.\u201d\nKnakal\u2019s pitch to property owners is fairly simple: There\u2019s no way to monetize air rights without selling them, and selling them doesn\u2019t reduce a building\u2019s revenue.\nManhattan has 1,220 landmarked buildings. The new law changed the rules for individual landmarks, not all properties in historic districts.\nAir rights do not automatically allow developers to build bigger projects. Height limits, setback requirements, street wall parameters and other factors collectively determine a site\u2019s potential. A massing study must be done to lay out the possibilities.\nFiguring that out, and how to transfer air rights to where you want them, \u201cis like three-dimensional chess,\u201d Knakal said.\n",

Developers in the outer boroughs locked in nine-figure loans to finish construction, refinance aging debt and reimagine retail hubs.\nThe month\u2019s top deals totaled almost $1.3 billion, led by a $340 million loan from Affinius Capital for Sky Equity Group\u2019s Gowanus multifamily project. Beitel borrowed $305 million for its multifamily project in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the Bronx. And Douglaston Development and Corebridge Real Estate Investors reeled in $287 million for their luxury rental tower on the Williamsburg waterfront.\nHere are the top five loans in the outer boroughs.\nSky high | $340M | Gowanus\nAffinius Capital\nprovided a $340 million loan to Sky Equity Group for its Gowanus multifamily development. The loan will allow the builders to finish construction and lease the 603-unit, mixed-use complex at 313 Bond Street. The luxury development, between Union and President streets, includes two multifamily buildings and 51,600 square feet of retail space. Sky Equity is reportedly affiliated with Simon Duchinsky\u2019s Rabsky group; the loan for the project replaces Rabsky\u2019s existing\n$286 million construction loan\nthat G4 Capital provided last year.\nScaling up | $305M | Mott Haven\nScale Lending\n, Slate Property Group\u2019s lending arm, provided a $305 million loan to Beitel for its multifamily project in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the Bronx. The loan will finance ground-up construction for the two-building, 515,000-square-foot development at 355 Exterior Street. The project will consist of connected 40-story and 26-story buildings. The development will include nearly 200 parking spaces, more than 11,000 square feet of retail space and residential amenities such as an outdoor pool, outdoor terrace, a gym and a pickleball court. At least 25 percent of the units will be affordable under the\nexpired 421a program\n. Landstone Capital arranged the 18-month whole-term loan, which includes two six-month extension options.\n\nWaterfront windfall | $287M | Williamsburg\nKKR Real Estate Credit\nprovided a $287 million loan to Douglaston Development and Corebridge Real Estate Investors for their luxury rental tower on the Williamsburg waterfront. The 41-story residential property at 1 North Fourth Place was built in 2015 and contains 509 units, and Douglaston has claimed it as the first high-rise rental project on the Williamsburg waterfront. The fresh financing replaced a $206 million loan from Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company.\nBronx booty | $201M | Concourse Village\nMerchants Capital\nprovided a $201 million loan to Arker Companies for 17 Bronx affordable housing developments. The fresh financing replaced a $178 million loan from Freddie Mac and the NYC Housing Development Corporation. The properties have 679 units and include 1041 Findlay Avenue, 1280 Sheridan Avenue and 1055 Findlay Avenue in Concourse Village.\nRentar refi | $160M | Middle Village\nDeutsche Bank and UBS\noriginated a $160 CMBS loan for Rentar Development\u2019s mixed-use plaza in Middle Village, which is in the midst of a retail overhaul. The fresh financing for Rentar Plaza at 66-26 Metropolitan Avenue replaced a $132 million loan backed by the complex. The three-story, 1.4 million-square-foot asset includes both retail and industrial space. The city is the property\u2019s largest industrial tenant, while BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club anchors the retail component.\n",

        "content": "With no discussion, Chicago City Council passed a far-reaching anti-gentrification ordinance for Chicago\u2019s South Shore and Woodlawn neighborhoods Thursday evening, giving tenants the controversial right of first refusal to buy their buildings and establishing requirements for \u201cjust cause\u201d evictions when a building owner plans to sell.\nThe proposal, known as the Jackson Park Housing Pilot Ordinance, was led by 5th Ward Alderman Desmon Yancy and passed despite prior attempts to enact a similar measure stalling for nearly two years.\nIts similarities to another hotly-debated anti-gentrification effort, known as the\nNorthwest Housing Preservation Ordinance\n, prompted pushback from the real estate industry.\n\u201cThe Jackson Park Housing Pilot Ordinance contains hazardous housing policy that could deter much-needed investment, worsen the affordability crisis, and ultimately harm the very tenants it claims to help,\u201d said Jon Kozlowski, Government Affairs Director for the Chicagoland Apartment Association. \u201cThis updated proposal was rushed forward with little input from those who actually provide housing for working families and without careful scrutiny such a sweeping measure deserves.\u201d\nThe new version of the ordinance includes some key differences that are helpful to the real estate industry and others that are not.\nLosses for the industry:\nThe new ordinance gives tenants the right of first refusal to purchase properties when their landlords look to sell, which was a feature of the\nNorthwest anti-gentrification effort\nthat has been sharply criticized by the industry for\nhampering multifamily properties\u2019 resale values\n.\nTenants have a longer timeline to close on a building purchase under the new version of the ordinance\u2019s right of first refusal provision. Instead of being given 120 days to close, tenants are given 180 days to close.\nWins for the industry:\n\nThe new ordinance limits the right of first refusal to buildings with 10 or more units.\nThe original ordinance stated that landlords in South Shore could not evict tenants for any reason other than \u201cjust cause,\u201d which is defined as a breach of a lease agreement or illegal activity. The new ordinance only places that restriction on landlords while they are trying to sell a building, presumably to stop a landlord from evicting tenants before they have time to form a tenants union.\nThe new ordinance removes a provision that states landlords must reimburse the city for relocation assistance provided to tenants under certain circumstances.\nThe new ordinance does not place limits on lease application fees and other moving fees charged by landlords.\nDuring a committee meeting to discuss the ordinance\nheld Wednesday\n, aldermen expressed support for the measure, citing the impending opening of the Obama Presidential Library as a harbinger of change. Johnson echoed those statements after the full council meeting.\n\u201cThis ordinance is a meaningful step in our mission to grow our city\u2019s housing supply while\nincreasing affordability in our neighborhoods,\u201d Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a Sept. 25 statement.\nMedian rent in the pilot area since 2015 has increased by 43 percent, while home values have risen by 130 percent, according to the city.\nOther provisions in the ordinance increased funding for initiatives like property tax debt relief and programs aimed at reducing costs of rehabilitating residential properties.\nChicago City Council\u2019s Committee on Housing and Real Estate voted unanimously to approve the South Shore ordinance Wednesday, in a process that industry lobbying group Neighborhood Building Owners Alliance of Chicago accused of being rushed through the system because it was posted publicly for the first time the day before the committee meeting, which was also during the Jewish high holiday Rosh Hashanah.",

        "content": "Homes on Lake Geneva\u2019s waterfront are selling at gold-medal speed, as two more mansions priced north of $8 million traded in recent weeks.\nThe Wisconsin resort town is forecasting a record year for its most exclusive stretch of shoreline.\nFour lakefront homes have closed at $8 million and up this year, with three more under contract,\naccording\nto Crain\u2019s. Four homes hit that price point last year, including the $22 million sale of the storied\nAloha Lodge\n.\nThe latest deals underscore just how fast buyers are snapping up lakefront inventory. A five-bedroom, 7,500-square-foot home at\n835 Bayview Drive\nhit the \u201ccoming soon\u201d section of listings Sept. 13 with for $8.5 million, or about $1,130 per square foot. A contract was signed Sept. 22, listing agent Gina Nocek of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate told the outlet.\nFive showings occurred soon after the listing, and multiple offers came through, she said. Nocek would not disclose the contract price, but the speed suggests buyers bid up.\nAnother home is right behind it: a new-construction, 7,800-square-foot, eight-bedroom house on Lake Shore Drive with an asking price just under $10 million, or $1,282 per square foot. David Curry of Geneva Lakefront Realty, who\u2019s marketing the property, said it\u2019s already drawing strong interest ahead of showings.\n\u201cThe momentum in this market is out of control right now,\u201d Curry told the outlet.\n\nIn late August\ntwo lakefront homes\nwere listed for nearly $10 million each, located at 620 South Lake Shore Drive and N2224 Bonnie Brae Lane. Those properties \u2014 along with 835 Bayview Drive \u2014 were rare public listings for the hot market and would rank among the priciest homes sold in high-end Wisconsin getaway this year at that price.\nRecent trades highlight the frenzy. A mansion that sold in June fetched $20 million after only three days on the market. In August, another closed for $10.1 million in an\nunsolicited deal\nstruck directly between buyer and seller. The price worked out to $1,442 per square foot.\nWhile brokers cite stock market gains and wealthy buyers\u2019 indifference to high borrowing costs, Curry added another driver: FOMO (fear of missing out).\nFor more than a century, Lake Geneva has been the summer playground of Chicago\u2019s elite. But even seasoned brokers say the pace of today\u2019s trophy-home market is unprecedented.\n\u201cFive years ago, you\u2019d have been out of your mind to build a $9 million spec house. Now it makes sense,\u201d Curry said.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "After a series of delays and contentious debates, Chicago City Council passed a citywide ordinance allowing accessory dwelling units \u2014 also known as granny flats \u2014 with\nmore restrictions\nthan housing advocates would have liked.\nAn original version of the ordinance would have allowed ADUs throughout most of the city with few barriers to the approval process. But a debate about aldermanic control over individual\nADU proposals\nturned into a year-long stalemate.\nAs a compromise, the ordinance approved Thursday bans detached units in low-density districts unless a local alderman opts in. Even then, construction will be capped at one to three ADUs per block, depending on zoning. Detached houses that add an ADU must be owner-occupied. For multi-unit districts, ADUs will be allowed by right.\nStill aldermen, industry groups and the mayor celebrated the outcome.\n\u201cThis ordinance offers a practical, balanced solution that supports both renters and the long-term health of Chicago\u2019s housing market,\u201d said Michael Mini of the Chicagoland Apartment Association. \u201cOur collective efforts should prioritize developing more housing options, particularly housing that is affordable to local residents who need them most.\u201d\nAldermen Marty Quinn\u2019s union-backed amendment requiring contractors to hire through certified apprentice programs for new construction also remained attached to the new ordinance. The Chicago Federation of Labor and building trades had pressed hard for the measure, warning they would sink the ordinance otherwise.\n\u201cI feel this revised ordinance better represents Chicago\u2019s values by lifting up our labor unions and workers,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cChicago is a union town, and including our labor unions in this process was critical.\u201d\n\nThe legislation also scrapped a 700-square-foot size cap on coach houses but maintains a 22-foot height limit and other spacing rules.\nAlderman Bennett Lawson, who originally proposed the ordinance, had pushed for a broader legalization effort, framing\nADUs as a way to chip away\nat Chicago\u2019s estimated 120,000-unit affordable housing shortage by creating unsubsidized, naturally occurring affordable units.\nLawson said the new version of the ordinance should still help the city\u2019s housing needs.\n\u201cThis is something that is very impactful,\u201d he said \u201cIt will bring hundreds of new units, hopefully a year, but in ways that you may not even notice in a neighborhood.\u201d\nQuinn and his allies, however, leveraged organized labor\u2019s support to force concessions, arguing aldermen must retain veto power over zoning changes in their wards. The compromise underscores the council\u2019s long-standing practice of \u201caldermanic prerogative.\u201d\nProgressives, including Mayor Brandon Johnson, had championed ADUs as a modest but citywide affordability fix.\n\u201cBy expanding ADUs to communities across the city, we are increasing housing availability and driving sustainable neighborhood investment,\u201d Johnson said.",

        "content": "JPI is thinking outside the financing playbook in Denton, where it\u2019s building a $132 million apartment community with the help of tax-exempt municipal bonds.\nThe prolific Dallas-based multifamily builder started construction in June on the 461-unit\u00a0 development at North Bonnie Brae Street and Bronco Way, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. The project is JPI\u2019s first bond-financed, public-private partnership, structured through the Denton Housing Authority, which owns the land. Berkadia Affordable Housing arranged the municipal bond financing, while\nJPI\nis overseeing development, construction and asset management.\nThe unusual funding model provided a way to deliver workforce housing while sidestepping traditional capital markets, JPI CEO Payton Mayes said. While not common in Texas, bond-funded development occasionally\npops up\nin other corners of the country.\n\u201cThe capital markets have been challenging over the past few years, but this was another tool in our tool chest that we could really bring value to the municipalities,\u201d Mayes told the outlet.\nJPI is in talks with other municipalities about replicating the model, Mayes said, suggesting\nbond-backed\nworkforce housing deals could become a more common fixture in Texas development.\n\u201cAs more municipalities kind of get to understand the structure \u2026 we think that more and more municipalities will favor this over some alternatives,\u201d Mayes told the outlet.\n\nDenton Housing Authority is projected to receive $35 million in equity from the deal over the first decade.\nHalf of the units will be designated affordable: 35 percent for households earning up to 80 percent of area median income, 10 percent at 60 percent AMI, and 5 percent at 50 percent AMI. The balance will be market-rate apartments. The first deliveries are slated for next fall, with full completion in the first half of 2027.\nElsewhere in Denton, Holt Lunsford\u2019s multifamily arm HL Communities is developing workforce\nhousing\ntargeting hospital workers near Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital and Texas Woman\u2019s University.\nJPI has seven active projects under construction across DFW, including a $100 million community in Haltom City and the $80 million Jefferson Ridglea Village in Fort Worth.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A historic Dallas listing aims to capture the momentum of upcoming projects meant to revitalize downtown Dallas.\nTanya Ragan\u2019s Wildcat Management is selling the Purse Building, a six-story, 75,000-square-foot landmark at 601 Elm Street that was once home to Purse &amp; Company Wholesale Furniture.\nThe brick building constructed in 1905 was used by the FBI as an investigative command center after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in nearby Dealey Plaza. It\u2019s on the National Register of Historic Place and is approved for state and federal historic tax credits as well as the city\u2019s 10-year historic tax abatement.\nWhen Ragan bought it in 2017, it had been vacant for decades. She began rehabbing the Purse Building by removing the outdated carpet and drop ceilings to reveal the building\u2019s original pine floors and timber beams. She originally planned to lease it to an office user, put in a rooftop deck and ground-level retail. At one point, she considered converting the building into a hotel.\nThe property could be transformed into \u201cmultifamily or condo development, creative office, or a flagship destination for a single use,\u201d per the marketing materials.\nThe property is \u201can irreplaceable piece of Dallas history,\u201d Ragan said.\n\nRagan, an advocate for the revitalization of downtown Dallas, got her start in oil and gas leasing. She specializes in adaptive reuse and helped with the redevelopment of the Dallas Farmers Market from a collection of old warehouses into a vibrant mixed-use district with a daily market.\nThe Purse Building listing reflects the challenges real estate operators are facing downtown Dallas, which has lost much of its luster to Uptown. Following the \u201cflight-to-quality\u201d office trend, countless companies have relocated from downtown to new trophy buildings across Klyde Warren Park.\nDowntown is also at risk of\nlosing AT&amp;T headquarters\n, with the telecommunications giant scouting a new location in the suburbs. AT&amp;T currently occupies Whitacre Tower, also known as One AT&amp;T Plaza. In addition,\nthe Neiman Marcus flagship store\n, a downtown landmark, hangs in the balance after a groundswell of support delayed the closure of the beloved store this spring.\nDallas\u2019 central business district struggled under the weight of excess older office space, which brings the area\u2019s office vacancy to nearly 35 percent, compared to the overall market, where vacancy is 25.3 percent, according to a recent report from Partners Real Estate.\nConverting obsolete buildings to other uses provided a much-hyped solution to the glut of office space, but making those projects pencil is a challenge.\nDespite the area\u2019s office market woes, the city is embarking on a $3.5 billion revamp of the Kay Bailey Hutchinson Convention Center. Meanwhile, Hunt Realty is planning a $5 billion redevelopment of Reunion Tower. Both projects would unfold within blocks of the Purse Building.",

        "content": "Developer Neighborlee Living, led by Kurt Jetta, won approval from Palm Beach County for a four-story, 38-unit affordable multifamily project with micro-units as small as 240 square feet.\nThe county commission greenlit the project, dubbed Neighborlee Living Westgate, at a zoning hearing on Thursday. Slated for the 0.7-acre site at 2818 Westgate Avenue, the project is in unincorporated Palm Beach County near\nWest Palm Beach\n, in an area zoned for growth governed by the Westgate Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA).\nJetta said his target renter for the project is recent college graduates.\nMicro-units are a growing segment of the pipeline for planned apartments nationwide. In April, Lyle Stern and Kerry Newman proposed a 400-unit Live Local Act project in Miami\u2019s Allapattah neighborhood that will\ninclude 40 micro-units\n. Proponents see the small scale of the units as an answer to the affordability crunch facing cities around the country. In Seattle, 66 percent of the city\u2019s planned apartments are micro-units,\nMultifamily Dive\nreported in June.\nNeighborlee Living Westgate will have 26\nmicro-units\nspanning 240 square feet, 10 studios spanning 360 square feet and two one-bedroom units spanning 538 square feet. The majority of the units are set aside for renters earning between 60 percent and 80 percent of Palm Beach County\u2019s area median income (AMI), which is $104,000 as of 2024.\nAccording to Neighborlee\u2019s website, micro-units will rent for $1,200 per month, studios for $1,600, and one-bedrooms for $2,000.

Following his approval, he said he has a new understanding of how the process slows down much needed growth in the housing pipeline.\n\u201cWe never ran into some cumbersome regulation,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s well-meaning, everybody\u2019s doing their job, but still, you don\u2019t get the affordable housing output people want to see.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The owners of a nine-story building known as Pasadena Office Tower face foreclosure in the wake of a notice of default on $40 million debt and election to sell that was recorded earlier this month.\nThe commercial mortgage-backed securities loan connected to the office building at 150 South Los Robles Avenue earlier landed in special servicing, with default considered likely and imminent. Borrowers acknowledged they would be unable to pay off the loan prior to maturity, blaming \u201ctenant flight to higher quality space, reduced office demand and inflationary pressures,\u201d according to servicer commentary via Morningstar Credit.\nThe owners, two entities connected to Albert Taban and Michael Pashaie, managing partners at Jade Enterprises and Golden West Properties, saw the property\u2019s\nvalue\nslashed by more than half as tenants fled. The offices were recently appraised at $23 million compared to $57 million at loan issuance in May 2015, per Morningstar.\n\nThat means the 142,000-square-foot property is worth less than the debt connected to it, which the landlords have defaulted on, but still worth around a million dollars more than what it was purchased for in 2002. Taban and Pashaie did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe offices, which were built in the 1970s, are 69 percent occupied compared to 93 percent occupancy at underwriting 10 years ago. The five largest leases combine to account for 39 percent of the space, and include the city of Pasadena, a California Department of Rehabilitation and the Pasadena Community Access Corporation. The three entities\u2019 leases are set to expire before the end of 2027.\nPasadena offices are not seeing the sort of post-pandemic revival that has lifted submarkets such as Century City on the Westside of Los Angeles, where newer, amenity-laden properties are billed as ways to lure workers back to their desks. Buildings in Pasadena, meanwhile, are generally selling at discounts. An office building at 790 East Colorado Boulevard recently\nsold\nfor $31.5 million \u2014 it was previously purchased for $59 million. An office complex at 55 South Lake Avenue and 800 East Colorado Boulevard\nsold\nfor $120 million compared to its $256 million previous price.\n",

        "content": "Shorewood Real Estate Group is the latest developer jumping into the frenzy in one of the Bronx\u2019s hottest neighborhoods.\nS. Lawrence Davis\u2019 firm is planning a 304-unit project at 350 Grand Concourse in Mott Haven, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Shorewood applied with the Department of City Planning nine months after acquiring the site for $28.5 million.\nThe 14-story, 244,000-square-foot development would be a mixed-use building, including a grocery store, which would span 40,000 square feet. Food Bazaar is the prospective tenant for the store. Plans also call for a 60-car parking garage.\nShorewood intends to utilize the 485x program, meaning 25 percent of the units would be set aside for affordable housing; in this case, they would be for families earning up to 60 percent of the area median income, on average.\nIn terms of the subsidy, Davis said rents would be pegged to \u201csupport the higher construction costs associated with the $40-an-hour wage,\u201d eschewing concerns about the wage floor\nattached to the 485x property tax abatement\n.\n\nThe firm projects the development will cost $175 million. It plans to begin construction in the first quarter and wrap in the first half of 2028.\nShorewood has more than 1000 residential units in its pipeline, along with prominent projects in Brooklyn and Queens. The firm was\nsued\nby tenants at 1 Archer Avenue in Jamaica at the start of the year, accused of manipulating rent concessions to dodge the requirements tied to the now-expired 421a tax program.\nAs for Mott Haven, it\u2019s one of the hottest development spots in all of New York City. This summer, Scale Lending provided the Beitel Group with\na $305 million loan\nfor a 755-unit development in the South Bronx neighborhood.\nScale previously\nprovided $150 million\nto Beitel for a 450-unit multifamily project at 120 East 144th Street in Mott Haven. RXR and Brookfield are also among the significant names to get involved in the neighborhood.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The newly named Christie\u2019s International Real Estate First Coast, led by founder Corey Hastings, has 130 agents and focuses on the Jacksonville metropolitan area, the release shows.\nHastings, a former Ohio University football player, is\none of many NFL hopefuls who pivoted to real estate\nafter leaving the league. He founded the brokerage in Jacksonville in 2018.\n\nFirst Coast has six offices in the region, including in Amelia Island, Jacksonville Beach, Ponte Vedra Beach, St. Johns, San Marco and Neptune Beach. Hastings has plans to open a St. Augustine office in the near future, the release shows.\nThe news comes on the heels of the bombshell that Compass is acquiring Anywhere Real Estate for\n$1.6 billion\nin an all-stock deal. First Coast falls under the Compass umbrella of brands, via Compass\u2019\n$444 acquisition\nof @properties and Christie\u2019s last year.\nConsolidation is on the rise across the industry, and brokerages have been jockeying for more territory in Florida since the state\u2019s pandemic market boom.

First Coast Sotheby\u2019s sales volume totaled $770 million the year prior to the acquisition.\nWhile the Jacksonville metro\u2019s real estate market surged during the pandemic, it has mellowed in the years since then. As of July, inventory was up 23.5 percent compared to pre-pandemic levels, and median home values were starting to dip, the\nJacksonville Business Journal\nreported.

        "content": "The Los Angeles City Council did more than greenlight a towering addition to one of Downtown Los Angeles\u2019 best-known commercial centers last week\n\u2014\nit also put a spotlight on a faraway firm and the one-time Peace Corp volunteer who runs it.\nThe 15-member council\napproved\nNational Real Estate Advisors\u2019 residential highrise project at The Bloc shopping mall at 7th and Flower streets, clearing the way for its Washington, D.C.-based developer to add a 41-story, 710-foot-tall tower with 466 apartments above The Bloc\u2019s existing parking structure. The residential component will join a fitness club that has partially filled a one-time\nMacy\u2019s\ndepartment store, various smaller retail shops, a 26-story Sheraton hotel, and 33 floors of office space that already comprise The Bloc.\nThe project will proceed under the guidance of the firm\u2019s CEO, Jerry Kanne, who comes to the rough-and-tumble world of real estate development via the Peace Corps. The Iowa native didn\u2019t go directly from do-gooder duty to development, though\n\u2014\nhe did some lumber trading, got his undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Iowa, worked for the Washington, D.C. law firm of Arnold &amp; Porter, and then cofounded Counts &amp; Kanne.\nKanne, who didn\u2019t respond to an inquiry for this piece, eventually landed with the parent of National Real Estate, which has about $4 billion in assets under management and is best known for its multifamily and office development. That was 38 years ago, and he has spanned various aspects of real estate development since.\nIn 2000, multi-billion-dollar pension fund National Electrical Benefit Fund formed an investment team to invest in real estate projects and Kanne ran its in-house real estate operations. In 2010, National Electrical Benefit Fund established National Real Estate Advisors as a subsidiary to manage real estate investments for pension funds and other institutional investors.\nUnder his leadership, National Real Estate Advisors formed a joint venture with\nCatalyst Healthcare Real Estate\nin November 2021 to focus on strategic capital investments in health care real estate. They paid $420 million to acquire and recapitalize two multistate health care portfolios by January 2022,\nCitybiz\nreported.\nThat deal \u201cnot only significantly scales our medical office portfolio, but furthers National\u2019s geographic diversification,\u201d Kanne said at the time.\n\nNational Real Estate, which is co-developing the 2,000-apartment mixed-use project The Stacks in Washington, D.C., has also made significant investments in the data center space. Through a joint venture with Sabey Corporation, Sabey Data Centers has a portfolio of more than 4 million square feet of efficient multitenant data centers. The firm has raised $1.2 billion to invest in data centers, the\nWashington Business Journal\nsaid.\nThe Bloc\nThe project in Downtown Los Angeles brings the development firmly back to the multifamily sector in a big and splashy way. The 41-story residential tower will be among the tallest buildings on the city\u2019s skyline at 710 feet, a status made possible because it starts atop an existing parking structure. The development\u2019s 466 apartments would include a mix of studio, one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments. Also on tape is a sculpted glass rooftop with an open-air amenity deck. A swimming pool, fitness center and lawn are planned.\nCalifornia-based The Ratkovich Company acquired the 2.4-million-square-foot site that was then called Macy\u2019s Plaza in 2013 for\n$241 million\n, according to the Los Angeles Times, and commenced plans for a $180 million transformation. Five years later, Ratkovich\nsold its interest\nto National Real Estate, its financial partner.\nAt the time, Kanne told the Times: \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to build a residential tower on top of the parking garage. Maybe 40 stories.\u201d\nThe recent approval from the City Council means he\u2019s positioned to make good on that hope\n\u2014\nalthough the developer will put in some some extras for the city\nNational Real Estate will make a nearly $16.8 million public benefits payment for a transfer of development rights from the Los Angeles Convention Center, with funds allocated for unspecified public amenities, affordable housing, and street lighting repair.\n",

During a debate on Sunday, according to\nGothamist\n, real estate took the spotlight during a critical moment.\nWhen asked about lowering rents, Sherrill retorted that her opponent was \u201cnot going to do anything about it because one of his biggest donors is actually being taken to court and sued on this very issue.\u201d\nThe oblique reference was about Jeff Kurtz\u2019s Kamson Corporation, one of 10 landlords being sued by the state alongside RealPage for the use of rent-setting algorithms, which the state argues is collusive.\nKurtz justified the use of the algorithm and Kamson was part of a motion in July to dismiss the state\u2019s lawsuit.\nThe Kurtzes have contributed more than $750,000 to Ciattarelli\u2019s campaigns since 2021, including multiple runs for the governorship. In June, they provided a $200,000 contribution to a political action committee attacking Sherrill.\n\nKamson owns and operates more than 10,000 units across the state. It drew scrutiny two years ago when two small children were killed in a fire at a Kamson complex.\nCiatarelli\u2019s campaign has brought in more than $250,000 from the real industry. Sherrill\u2019s campaign, meanwhile, has landed more than $100,000 in donations from the industry, counting developers Steven Plofker and Chris Yegen among her base.\nNeither candidate commented to Gothamist on the contributions.\nOn the policy front, Sherrill\u2019s real estate focus is on going after negligent landlords and cracking down on drastic rent increases tied to software use. Ciattarelli wants to lower property taxes and energy costs to improve affordability.\nAn Emerson College Polling/PIX11/The Hill survey\nreleased\non Thursday put the race between the two candidates at a dead heat.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The Miami City Commission finalized a controversial deal to transfer ownership of the historic Olympia Theater in downtown Miami to a charter school company co-founded by rapper Pitbull, whose real name is Armando Christian Perez.\nOn Thursday, city commissioners voted unanimously, 5-0, to sell the\n1926 landmark\nand its adjacent 10-story office building to Sports Leadership Arts Management, or SLAM, for just $10. In exchange,\nPitbull\u2019s\nSLAM pledged to invest a minimum of $57 million into restoring the deteriorating venue\u2019s interior performance space and seating area, with an additional $20 million budgeted for renovations to the theater\u2019s upper floors.\n\u201cThis is the best of both worlds,\u201d said commissioner Joe Carollo. \u201cThey\u2019re putting the money to upgrade the whole building, and we\u2019ll still have the Olympia Theater.\u201d\nOpened in 1926 as a silent movie palace, the Olympia Theater has long been considered a crown jewel of downtown Miami\u2019s\nFlagler Street\n. Designed by John Eberson and renovated decades later by Morris Lapidus, the theater was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It has hosted cultural icons including B.B. King, Luciano Pavarotti and Etta James.\nThe property\u2019s condition, however, has worsened in recent years. Leaks, structural damage and outdated systems have left the building in disrepair, city records show. Required upgrades in the SLAM agreement include reconstructing dressing and crew rooms, repairing water-damaged decorative plaster, retrofitting mechanical systems and restoring the marquee, fa\u00e7ade, roof and ticket booth.\nThe sale also resolves an ongoing legal dispute with the heirs of Maurice Gusman, the late developer who rescued the property from demolition in the 1970s. In 2019, his family sued the city for allegedly violating a covenant involving its management of the theater via the semiautonomous Miami Parking Authority. Under the SLAM deal, the city and the\nGusman family\nwill settle the lawsuit if SLAM restores the property within five years of receiving building permits.\n\nSLAM, which operates several\ncharter schools\nin South Florida, plans to open Miami Tech at Mater Innovation Academy within the Olympia Theater complex. The campus would likely partner with Miami Dade College for dual enrollment programs, and the building would be renamed the Miami Innovation &amp; Arts Academy. SLAM must also host programming that is available to the general public for at least 180 days of the year.\nDozens of charter school employees and parents whose children attend SLAM-affiliated schools spoke in favor of the agreement during the public comment portion of the city commission meeting.\n\u201cOlympia is an iconic landmark that must be preserved,\u201d said SLAM co-founder and CEO Millie Sanchez. \u201cOur proposal saves the Olympia Theater, and it saves the city and its taxpayers from bearing that cost. The Gusman family, the original benefactor, supports this plan.\u201d\nHowever, dozens of city residents spoke against giving Olympia Theater away to SLAM. Longtime Miami activist Elvis Cruz said the city was prioritizing its own convenience over residents\u2019 concerns.\n\u201cOver 45 years of civic activism I have learned the city of Miami loves to do things for its own comfort and convenience, even if it causes discomfort and inconvenience for residents,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cDon\u2019t sell the Olympia Theater. Please restore it.\u201d\nAnother activist, Sandy Moise, criticized city leaders for ramming the agreement through. \u201cCity officials have been acting like lobbyists,\u201d Moise said. \u201cWhat we are closer to is giving away one of Miami\u2019s greatest public treasures in a backroom deal that does not reflect the will or the best interests of the people.\u201d",

        "content": "Joe Mansueto is in the clear to start construction on a 22,000-seat soccer stadium for Chicago Fire FC at Related Midwest\u2019s megadevelopment The 78.\nThe Chicago City Council gave final approval for the plans this week, meaning dirt can start moving to meet the soccer club\u2019s goal of having the project finished in time for Major League Soccer\u2019s 2028 season, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. The stadium was previously reported to be a $650 million investment by\nMansueto\n, but recent reports pegged it at $750 million. It\u2019s unclear what has caused the discrepancy. The zoning amendment needed to allow the stadium to be built passed unanimously.\nThe\nprivately-funded stadium\nwill anchor Related Midwest\u2019s 62-acre South Loop megaproject. The 78 is expected to be an $8 billion mixed-use campus along the South Branch of the Chicago River, currently a vacant swath of riverfront land between Roosevelt Road and Ping Tom Memorial Park in Chinatown.\nThe soccer team agreed to cap major events at the stadium to 45 per year, including the Fire\u2019s 17 home games per season. Building a dedicated soccer stadium would enable the team to control its own schedule, create a more intimate fan experience,and host a range of events throughout the year. The team has experienced years of frustration sharing Soldier Field with the\nChicago Bears\n.\n\nAbout 5,000 apartment units are part of Related Midwest\u2019s plans around the stadium, along with over a mile of bike trails, 3 acres of sports fields, public parking and a water taxi stop along the 1,400 feet of riverfront.\nFirst proposed in 2019, Related Midwest\u2019s redevelopment agreement called for the developer to spend $551 million on rebuilding local transportation infrastructure for the site, which was to include a CTA Red Line stop and adjustment of nearby Metra train tracks. Tax increment financing would then be used to reimburse the developer.\nLast week Curt Bailey, president of Related Midwest, told the Chicago Plan Commission that the 2019 plan was no longer needed and had become too costly. A new proposal would scrap the realignment of Metra tracks and the Red Line station, Bailey said. The 2019 agreement is expected to be\nrenegotiated\n, according to Ciere Boatright, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Planning and Development.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The retailer is in talks with city officials about opening a store at 801 Market Street.\nTokyo-based Uniqlo underwent a series of store closures in the wake of the pandemic, locking its doors for good at its San Francisco flagship in 2021. Other clothing giants like\nMacy\u2019s\nand\nBloomingdale\u2019s\nfled the city and shut down their flagship locations.\nThe timing for Uniqlo\u2019s return feels right, company officials said. The company is getting close to confirming a location and considers San Francisco an important market, said Tomo Yasuda, Uniqlo\u2019s North America real estate director.\n\nYasuda and other Uniqlo bigwigs met with Mayor Daniel Lurie and his staff this summer. Uniqlo reportedly was looking to discuss how the company could \u201cpartner with the city to rejuvenate the city and have a successful opening.\u201d Uniqlo also sought to discuss \u201ccommitments to making the downtown better\u201d and how to \u201chelp to speed up our permitting process.\u201d\nWhile the location of the new Uniqlo outpost hasn\u2019t been confirmed, a representative for investment firm Pontegadea said earlier this year that it was \u201cworking on a lease with Uniqlo for Pac Place.\u201d The Pacific Place building, at 801 Market Street, is owned by Pontegadea and was formerly occupied by Old Navy before it closed in 2023.\nUniqlo\u2019s comeback in San Francisco would mark a major step in the company\u2019s post-pandemic growth, though it wouldn\u2019t be the only store location in the Bay Area.

But the judge sided with Core, pointing to a memorandum of understanding the parties drafted last year that restructured payment terms.\nShvo never signed the document, but Masley found the club had shown \u201cgood faith\u201d by paying rent in line with its modified obligations. The judge ordered Core to keep paying under the terms of its 2021 lease and barred Shvo from taking steps to evict.\n\nShvo\u2019s camp took the ruling as a win, emphasizing that the court affirmed Core still needs to abide by its original lease. An attorney for Core framed the decision as shutting down a \u201cbaseless eviction attempt\u201d and said the club will continue pressing for damages tied to what it describes as Shvo\u2019s \u201cegregious misconduct.\u201d\nCore, which relocated to Fifth Avenue in 2022 from East 55th Street, has roughly 1,500 members paying upward of $10,000 annually. Court filings show it pulled in $25 million of revenue last year with net income of $2.7 million. But the glossy brand has traded insults with its landlord, accusing Shvo of neglecting basic building services, from cold showers to clogged toilets.\nThe two sides are entangled in other disputes, including a separate judgment that Core owes Shvo $1 million on an old loan.\nMeanwhile, Shvo faces pressure of his own.

        "content": "Compass touted unity among the 340,000 real estate professionals it would add under its umbrella by acquiring Anywhere Real Estate, but Texas brokers aren\u2019t clear on how the move will change the game.\nThe move followed another blockbuster deal. Last year, Compass agreed to acquire Chicago-born @properties for a stunning $444 million. The deal for its competitor in the market built on their first- and second-place spots in the brokerage scene and secured Compass\u2019 foothold. If the merger with Anywhere goes through next year, brands affiliated with Compass will account for most of the sales volume of the\ntop 20 brokerages in Chicago\n, according to an analysis of last year\u2019s sales.\nNorth Texas is a more varied market. The top 20 brokerages in the Metroplex charted $37.9 billion in volume last year. Compass and the brands that it will absorb completed $12.39 billion altogether, meaning that Compass stands to gain about a third of the market share in North Texas. Other brokerages completed $25.55 billion in volume.\nColdwell Banker Apex, Coldwell Banker Realty, Briggs Freeman Sotheby\u2019s International Real Estate, Century 21 Mike Bowman and Century 21 Judge Fite are the top North Texas brokerages that operate under the Anywhere brand. With Compass, their combined volume of $12.4 billion would dwarf the No. 1 brokerage, Berkshire Hathaway-owned Ebby Halliday Real Estate, which completed $5.84 billion.\nA caveat: Coldwell Banker, Sotheby\u2019s International Real Estate and Century 21 are franchisors, so the local offices affiliated with their brand are independently operated. Compass owns its Dallas office, but Anywhere doesn\u2019t own the businesses that pay to use its brands, which compete with each other to varying degrees. The merger won\u2019t combine these businesses into one.\n\u201cWe have a franchise agreement with Anywhere, and that will stay in place for the long term,\u201d said Jim Fite, owner of Century 21 Judge Fite.\nA change in the guard doesn\u2019t make much difference in the day-to-day work of a franchisee, said Jerry Mooty Jr., CEO and broker of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate @properties Lone Star, which Compass also recently\nacquired\n.\n\u201cWe still report to the same Christie\u2019s leadership; if anything\u2019s happened, it\u2019s actually helped us on the recruiting side,\u201d Mooty said, adding that branding matters in the luxury world.\nChristie\u2019s brass told agents last year that the Compass name would boost prestige. Not all agents accepted the encouragement. Nancy Almodovar, founder of leading Houston luxury brokerage Nan &amp; Co, said her office was \u201c\nblindsided\n\u201d by Compass.\n\n\u201cI actually believe the consumer maybe even pays more attention to the brand of the individual agent than they do the company,\u201d argued Tommy Flood, head of the GO Network, the largest franchise in Keller Williams, which stands to become the second biggest brokerage in the country after the acquisition.\nFite said he doesn\u2019t expect his company or the Century 21 brand to be affected. His primary concern is data sharing.\n\u201cThe ownership of data is very important. I don\u2019t want my company data in the hands of my competitor, and I believe my franchise agreement prevents that,\u201d Fite said.\nCompass can collect \u201cagnostic data\u201d without violating franchise agreements using a multitenant technology structure that would protect each office\u2019s data, Mooty said.\n\u201cYou can build a technology stack on what\u2019s called a single-tenant model, where everybody plugs in and all that data is included in one big database. That\u2019s what Compass was originally when it was just Compass,\u201d Mooty said. For franchises, though, \u201cthere might be some agnostic data or whatever the word is \u2014 it\u2019s not identifiable data \u2014 that might pool up to where you get a bigger picture of the real estate market.\u201d\nCompass ranked second among North Texas brokerages last year in TRD Data, and Century 21 Judge Fite ranked 11th with $1.3 billion in volume. The nearest competitor to Compass under the Anywhere brand is Coldwell Banker Apex, which ranked fifth with $2.2 billion in volume.\n\u201cI think our presence is smaller in the more medium price range in the suburbs,\u201d said Michelle Wood, founding partner of the Detwiler+Wood Group, the highest-producing Compass team in the Dallas market.\nWhen asked if the acquisition might resolve any rivalries between brokerages, as it\u2019s expected to in\nMiami\n, Wood said that Anywhere brokerages \u201cdon\u2019t compete with us in the Dallas market.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Rithm Capital\u2019s\ndeal to buy\nParamount Group for $1.6 billion came as a bit of a surprise.\nAfter bids from Blackstone, SL Green and Empire State Realty Trust, it was Rithm, a lesser-known but still deep-pocketed asset manager with a focus on mortgage servicing, that came out on top.\nThe company is set to take on Paramount\u2019s 13 million square feet of office space in New York and San Francisco at a 40 percent discount to its book value.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very patient in the office sector, and we believe now is the right time to do so,\u201d said\u00a0 Rithm CEO Michael Nierenberg in a conference call with analysts on September 17.\nThe deal comes after Paramount and its long-time CEO Albert Behler have\nbeen in the news\nfor all the wrong reasons. Earlier this year, the company revealed it made millions of dollars in previously undisclosed payments to CEO Albert Behler\u2019s companies. Paramount also disclosed it is under an SEC investigation. Meanwhile, TRD further discovered that Behler gave a no-bid contract to a company tied to his ex-girlfriend.\nBut those days should soon be behind Paramount. Rithm\u2019s deal still requires shareholder approval, but is expected to close at the end of the year.\nParamount\u2019s sale is being closely scrutinized by analysts. It is among the first large-scale acquisitions of offices since the pandemic. And depending on who you talk to, either paints a positive picture of the New York office landscape or a dismal one for Paramount shareholders.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the deal:\nThe offer and other key numbers:\nRithm will pay: $6.60 per diluted share\nTotal offer amount: $1.6B\nParamount stock price, prior to Rithm\u2019s deal: $7.39\nParamount\u2019s highest stock price in last five years: $11.53\nParamount\u2019s portfolio:\nParamount\u2019s portfolio includes 13 owned and four managed office assets in New York City and San Francisco. About 8.7 million square feet of space is located in New York.\nOver 85 percent of the portfolio is leased as of June 2025 and annualized average rent is $90 per square foot, according to an investor presentation.\nIn New York, its buildings include: 1633 Broadway, 1301 Avenue of the Americas and 1325 Avenue of the Americas. In San Francisco, Paramount owns One Market Plaza, 300 Mission Street and One Front Street.\nWhy was Paramount put up for sale?\nParamount was facing pressure from shareholders and analysts over its high compensation to executives relative to its stock performance.\nIn early 2025, Paramount disclosed that it paid millions of dollars to Behler\u2019s outside companies or personal interests, including $3 million for a private jet firm Behler co-owned.\nA short time later, Paramount announced it was undergoing a strategic review and hired Bank of America as its financial advisor. The overall office market in New York had improved and investor appetite was growing. Paramount signed over 400,000 square feet of leases in the second quarter, its most in a quarter since 2019.\nBut despite the uptick in leasing, Paramount reported a net loss of $19.8 million for the second quarter, compared to $7.8 million a year prior. The losses included $7.5 million of expenses related to the acceleration of equity awards and severance payments.\nWho is Rithm?\n\nRithm was founded in 2013 as an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group with a focus on residential mortgage servicing under the name New Residential Investment.\nThe company internalized management and rebranded to Rithm in 2022. Since then, Rithm has gone on an acquisition spree. In 2023, Rithm acquired Sculptor Capital Management, which had $33 billion in assets under management. This month, Rithm inked a deal to buy Crestline Management, an alternative asset manager with $17 billion in assets.\nRithm now has $100 billion in investable assets. It lends across commercial and residential real estate.\nWhy did Rithm want to buy Paramount?\nRithm CEO Michael Nierenberg said on a call with analysts that the firm is seeking to diversify its investment strategies. Paramount presented a rare opportunity to acquire commercial real estate in gateway cities at a discount during a period when fundamentals are improving. Nierenberg repeatedly mentioned expected future rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. The cuts will lead to cap rate compression, allowing values to increase.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very bullish on office as we look at this so-called dislocated recovery trade or investment,\u201d said Nierenberg on the call.\nParamount\u2019s office towers are around 15 percent unoccupied with an additional 800,000 square feet of leases expiring in 2026, according to its investor presentation. Rithm can put in some upgrades, lease out the remaining space and hike rents, adding revenue to an existing portfolio.\n\u201cThis is\nan absolute value-add opportunity,\u201d said Dylan Burzinski, an analyst with Green Street Advisors, in an interview.\nRithm executives mentioned the deal will be balance sheet light in its call with analysts. In other words, the company will only use a portion of its own money to fund the deal and can raise money from co-investors and limited partners. Nierenberg said interest is already high. He added that Rithm could syndicate the whole deal if wanted to do so.\nRithm expects to 2x its investment.\nWhat does this mean for the NYC office market?\nRithm\u2019s offer could be looked at in one of two ways. It is either a huge testament to New York City\u2019s office recovery or a major disappointment for Paramount shareholders. Wall Street analysts covering Paramount have competing viewpoints.\nEvercore ISI analyst Steve Sakwa predicted Paramount was worth at least $7.58 a share and as much as $12, Crain\u2019s reported. Sakwa said Paramount shareholders may reject the offer based on the low offer.\nBut Dylan Burzinski, an analyst with Green Street, said Rithm\u2019s deal was in line with his team\u2019s expectations. He mentioned Rithm will likely have to put in a significant amount of money in capital improvements for Paramount\u2019s office buildings, which adds to the risk.\n\u201cThe public market just got a little bit ahead of itself in terms of where valuation would shake out,\u201d said Burzinski. \u201cThis is a very value-add portfolio.\u201d\nParamount claims to have a Class A portfolio. But the office market recovery has not spread across all office towers. Paramount\u2019s buildings are largely unrecognizable to most New Yorkers, most of which were built or redeveloped in the 1980s. It has no ultra-modern trophy asset like One Vanderbilt.\n\u201cWhat SL Green and Vornado [have] tends to be the best of the best in the New York City office. What Paramount has is good, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s as high of quality,\u201d said Burzinski.\nOverall, Burzinski said the reported interest in Paramount from big-name investors like SL Green, Vornado and Empire State Realty was a positive sign for the office market.\n\u201cOne year ago, I don\u2019t think you would have had that many buyers lined up wanting to take a look at this,\u201d said Burzinski. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good indicator that capital is looking more at office than in recent memory.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s next for Behler?\nIt seems hard to imagine Behler, who\u2019s been CEO of Paramount since 1991, will stay on when the deal closes. Most of the recent scrutiny surrounding Paramount stemmed from his cushy perks and unorthodox dealmaking. Rithm did not specifically mention Behler in its investor call. Nierenberg stressed that Paramount had a large management team.\nBut anything is possible. This is New York City real estate, crazier things have happened.\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s not actually called the Plumber Employment Act. But it should be.\nWhat other rationale could the City Council have for passing a bill on Thursday requiring a master plumber for basic installations of gas stoves and dryers?\nThe legislation could also be called the Keep Your Old Appliances Act.\nA basic rule of economics is that if you make something more expensive, you get less of it. Requiring a master plumber or specially qualified installers to put in a gas stove or dryer will add hundreds of dollars to the cost. As a result, landlords and homeowners will hold on to their old appliances longer.\nIf anything,\nIntro 429-A\nwill make New York more dangerous. Old gas stoves pollute indoor air and make people sick. Lint can build up in old dryers and vents, creating a fire hazard. The Council should be incentivizing replacement of old appliances, not discouraging them by dramatically raising installation costs.\nThe sponsor of the bill, Bronx Council member Pierina Ana Sanchez,\njustified it\nby pointing to an illegal gas hookup that led to an\nEast Village explosion\nin 2015.\nBut that tragedy was caused by amateurs running pipes from one building to another, not a standard stove or dryer installation that requires no piping to be moved. The city has already responded to the 2015 explosion by passing\nLocal Law 152\nof 2016, which mandates that multifamily buildings\u2019 gas pipes be checked by a master plumber every four years.\nSanchez\u2019s bill appears to drastically raise the usual $600 cost of those inspections by expanding them to include the point of connection to every gas appliance. It seems to me that instead of just popping in and out of the cellar, the master plumber would have to go into apartments and pull out every gas stove and dryer to check the connection.\nMy inquiry to Sanchez\u2019s office was not immediately answered.\nTo my knowledge, no tragedies have ever happened in New York City as a result of a standard stove or dryer replacement. These have generally been handled by a two-person crew that delivers appliances ordered from retailers such as PC Richard or AJ Madison.\n\nNow, crews will deliver, but not install, gas appliances; customers will have to find a master plumber on their own.\nI don\u2019t see how delivery crews will be able to haul off old appliances without disconnecting them from the gas valve, which would appear to violate this new law. So even replacing a gas unit with an electric one would require a master plumber.\nThink of how many thousands of basic appliance replacements have been made without a single one causing an explosion. What problem is Sanchez trying to solve, other than the potential lack of an endorsement by\nPlumbers Local No. 1\nfor her future political campaigns? The union pushed relentlessly for the bill, as did the\nPlumbing Foundation of New York City\nand Master Plumbers Council.\nSanchez knows that Mayor Eric Adams, who is making a desperate bid for re-election and welcomes union endorsements, is unlikely to veto the bill. But he should, because it increases costs. Also, his own Department of Buildings\ntestified against\nprovisions of the bill and has pointed out that only 1,100 master plumbers exist in a city of 8.6 million people. Why divert them to simple tasks?\nIncredibly, Sanchez claims her bill is merely a \u201c\nclarification\n\u201d that \u201cmakes explicit what has long been practice.\u201d What city has she been living in? In the Real World, gas appliances have routinely been replaced by people who are not licensed master plumbers.\nIt could have been worse. Sanchez\u2019s original\nIntro 429\ncalled for a licensed plumber to install dishwashers, garbage disposers and refrigerators with icemakers. These are also routinely installed without issue by appliance delivery people. The Real Estate Board of New York, as well as condominium and co-op interests, lobbied to narrow the bill\u2019s scope.\nMeanwhile, a similar battle lies ahead for the industry.\nCouncil member Farah Louis has\na bill\nrequiring owners of multiple dwellings to have a\nlicensed master plumber\nannually inspect all steam radiators in units with children under 6.\nLouis is responding to the death of an 11-month-old in her Brooklyn district. But her bill would\nimpose a great cost\non multifamily buildings, raising rents. And it likely would not prevent any deaths, as steam radiators are already inspected regularly and tragedies like\nthe one in Midwood\nare exceedingly rare.\n",

        "content": "Foundry Commercial and Wheelock Capital are teaming up to convert a shuttered indoor flea market in Pompano Beach into an industrial complex.\nOrlando-based\nFoundry\n, led by Paul Ellis, and Greenwich, Connecticut-based\nWheelock\n, led by Rick Kleeman and Jonathan Paul, paid $66 million for the 26-acre Festival Marketplace at 2900 West Sample Road, according to a press release.\nAn affiliate of Yoram Izhak\u2019s North Miami-based\nIMC Equity Group\nsold the property for $10 million above the previous sale price seven years ago. In 2018, the IMC affiliate paid $56 million for it, records show. Three years later, IMC sold a parking lot adjacent to the flea market for $16 million.\nFestival Marketplace closed in June.\nFoundry and Wheelock are planning Festival Logistics Park, a 474,000-square-foot complex divided into three buildings ranging from 60,000 square feet to 300,000 square feet, the release states. Demolition of the existing building and initial construction of the new project are slated to begin later this year, according to the joint venture. Festival Logistics Park\u2019s expected completion is in 2026.\n\nThe joint venture hired Nick Wigoda and Steve Medwin with Stream Realty Partners to lease up the planned industrial park, the release states.\nSince 2015, Foundry has developed and purchased $5 billion worth of commercial real estate assets across the country totaling 31 million square feet. The firm\u2019s south Florida portfolio is roughly 10 million square feet and more than $1.5 billion in project volume, the release states.\nIn July, Foundry and a real estate fund advised by Dallas-based Crow Holdings Capital paid\n$23.1 million\nfor a 10.2-acre parking lot near Festival Marketplace where the partnership is planning a pair of warehouses.\nSince its inception in 2005, Wheelock has acquired $11 billion-plus in real estate assets, primarily focusing on hospitality, industrial, retail and mixed-use projects, the firm\u2019s website states.\nThis month, Wheelock, Giles Capital Group, Rosemurgy Properties and Schmier Property Group sold the retail component of Uptown Boca, a mixed-use project in Boca Raton, for $118.4 million.

        "content": "The City of Garland scrapped plans to back a $71 million soccer complex that was supposed to anchor Atl\u00e9tico Dallas\u2019 entry into the professional ranks.\nThe club, set to join a United Soccer League division in 2027, said they found out this week the city no longer intends to pursue the\nproject\n. The move unwinds a deal the Garland City Council blessed in June, when it authorized a lease for city-owned land at Holford Road and the President George Bush Turnpike, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nAtl\u00e9tico Dallas envisioned a headquarters and training hub with a 2,000-seat \u201cshow pitch,\u201d academy fields, and a 28,000-square-foot building with team offices, locker rooms, therapy space and a dining hall. Plans also included futsal courts, a plaza and the possibility of a 127-acre sports and entertainment district nearby.\nExecutives called the reversal \u201cdeeply disappointing.\u201d Club co-founder Matt Valentine told the outlet that Garland residents had rallied around the project and that the decision \u201ccame out of left field.\u201d He added that Atl\u00e9tico had already been sourcing materials for the facility and offered to fund certain components privately to ease what he described as the city\u2019s \u201clegal concerns\u201d about the lease. Garland officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe proposed\nfinancing\nincluded $25 million for the fields, $20 million for the multipurpose building and $26 million for road improvements and a planned extension of Naaman Forest Boulevard. The club was also prepared to lease the complex from the city under a 20-year agreement with an annual rent of $75,000 for the fields with a 2.5 percent annual escalation\nWhile Garland was still in play, Atl\u00e9tico secured agreements with Dallas to stage home matches at the Cotton Bowl and to take over MoneyGram Soccer Park, a tournament hub at 2200 Walnut Hill Lane in Northwest Dallas. That arrangement won Dallas City Council approval in June. Valentine declined to say whether Garland\u2019s about-face was tied to the\nDallas\ndeal but acknowledged the timing raised questions.\nLosing\nGarland\nas a partner means the club\u2019s front office will look closer to Fair Park for its headquarters. Valentine said Atl\u00e9tico, currently operating out of Richardson, has begun scouting Dallas sites and expects to lean on MoneyGram for training.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Mayor Brandon Johnson scored a procedural win for his environmental agenda this week, moving a long-stalled zoning measure out of legislative purgatory.\nBut the fight over the\nHazel Johnson Cumulative Impacts Ordinance\nis far from over.\nThe city council voted to send the proposal to the zoning committee after it languished for months, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Named for the late Southeast Side environmental justice advocate, the ordinance would force developers seeking heavy industrial rezonings to study how projects would add to pollution in Black and Brown neighborhoods that already bear the brunt of emissions.\nSupporters cast it as a long-overdue check on environmental racism. Opponents \u2014 an unusual coalition of business groups and organized labor \u2014 say it could spook investors and threaten blue-collar jobs. The Johnson administration floated amendments last week clarifying that an environmental review board would only serve in an advisory role, not override city departments. But critics say the tweaks don\u2019t go far enough.\nThe opposition had planned to fight a motion to reroute the measure, but backed off after Alderman Julia Ramirez, a sponsor, agreed to further negotiations. Alderman Gilbert Villegas, who is against the ordinance as written, said he was encouraged by the compromise.\n\nChicago is trying to balance its economic development ambitions while advancing\ncommunity health\n. In the past, the city\u2019s patchwork approach to industrial zoning fueled frustration on both sides: developers face\nregulatory uncertainty\n, while residents fear being saddled with new smokestacks without meaningful input.\nDuring former Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s\nadministration\nthere was the General Iron saga \u2014 when the city first greenlit, then blocked, the scrap metal firm\u2019s move from Lincoln Park to the Southeast Side \u2014 remains a cautionary tale. That reversal triggered a hunger strike, multiple lawsuits and a claim for $100 million damages by the firm that is still winding through the courts.\nJack Lavin of the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce summed up the business position bluntly: companies need predictable rules before committing capital. Environmental advocates counter that predictability shouldn\u2019t come at the expense of neighborhoods already overburdened by pollution.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Meanwhile, the median rent for a two-bedroom climbed up to $5,000, a record for Zumper\u2019s reports which started tracking rents in 2016.\nYear over year, San Francisco topped the list for rent growth for a two-bedroom apartment, up 17.1 percent from last year. One-bedroom rent prices in the city were up 10.7 percent year-over-year, the third-highest increase nationally.\n\n\u201cThe\nAI boom\nhas brought an influx of\nhigh-paying jobs and investor activity\nback to San Francisco, fueling housing demand in a city where supply has long been constrained,\u201d Zumper spokesperson Crystal Chen told the Business Times. \u201cCombined with generally stricter\nreturn-to-office policies\n, it\u2019s not entirely surprising that the one-bedroom rent hit its pre-pandemic benchmark this year.\u201d\nIt\u2019s only a matter of time before median prices for a one-bedroom surpass the pre-pandemic record of $3,720 from June 2019. The city could leave its pre-pandemic records in the dust next year, Chen said, citing heightened renter demand and limited new housing supply as possible drivers of price increases.\nSan Francisco\u2019s rising rents are in stark contrast to nationwide trends. Rents across much of the country have either fallen or remained flat for the past three months, according to Zumper\u2019s National Rent Index.\nMeanwhile, as rents across San Francisco grow, home prices are trending in the opposite direction. They\u2019ve dropped to 2018 levels, according to the Business Times. Still, high home prices and mortgage rates as well as increasing insurance premiums have forced potential buyers to settle on renting for now.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "A partnership featuring billionaire Barry Sternlicht is putting on hold a request for zoning changes to the site of The Standard Spa, Miami Beach that would have allowed a major renovation of the hotel.\nThe Miami Beach City Commission was set to vote on the rezoning at its Sept. 16 meeting, but The Standard Spa, Miami Beach ownership group requested that the item be removed from the agenda, according to a letter obtained by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nFor the past year, plans to revamp the 100-key hotel at 40 Island Avenue have been embroiled in controversy tied to an agreement between the hotel\u2019s owner,\nNomade Lido\n, and the Belle Isle Residents Association that entailed a $1.2 million payment in exchange for the association\u2019s support.\nMiami Beach commissioner David Suarez has maintained that the deal may violate the city\u2019s ethics code barring any person or entity from receiving payments in exchange for securing government approvals.\nSternlicht\n, CEO of Miami Beach-based Starwood Capital Group, owns 15.4 percent of Nomade Lido. Other major partners include star architect Bjarke Ingels, Argentinian businessman and lawyer Antonio de la Rua, Argentinian hotelier Sebastian Sas and Miguel Isla, CEO of Miami Beach-based Nomade People and managing partner of\nThe Standard Spa, Miami Beach\n.\nMinority investors include tech billionaire and political activist Peter Thiel and his husband Matt Danzeisen, biotech investor Jeff Aronin, businessman Martin Franklin and former CEO of Softbank Group International Marcelo Claure.\n\n\u201cWhat should have been an honest, collaborative process has been poisoned by Commissioner Suarez\u2019s personal attacks, misinformation campaigns, and deliberate attempts to pit neighbor against neighbor,\u201d Isla said in an emailed statement to\nTRD\n. \u201cSuch conduct erodes the confidence that has been built for both residents and businesses who see Miami Beach as a place worthy of long-term investment.\u201d\nIsla made similar comments in a Sept. 17 correspondence with Miami Beach commissioner Laura Dominguez, who sponsored legislation to approve the rezoning, which would allow Nomade Lido to add condo units to The Standard Spa, Miami Beach. Isla requested that Dominguez not move forward with the item.\n\u201cI believe it is in the best interest of our community that you withdraw the pending item from further consideration,\u201d Isla wrote. \u201cWe will seek to move the project forward in a different way and not under the duress, distortions and smears of those seeking to make headlines.\u201d\nIn a recent newsletter to his constituents, Suarez took credit for Nomade Lido\u2019s retreat. \u201cThe bottom line is this: we stopped The Standard\u2019s upzoning scheme,\u201d Suarez wrote in the newsletter. \u201cResidents spoke out, the truth came to light, and once exposed to public scrutiny, the developer backed down.\u201d\nNomade Lido planned to replace the east wing of\nThe Standard Spa, Miami Beach\nwith a five-story building featuring six luxury condos, 50 hotel rooms and 66 parking spaces. The hotel owner also sought to renovate the three-story west wing, including reducing the room count to 50 from 67, according to plans filed with the city.\nHowever, Suarez was adamantly opposed to the renovation plan largely due to the previously undisclosed deal between Nomade Lido and Belle Isle Residents Association, or BIRA. Nomade Lido had agreed to pay a nonprofit entity created by BIRA\n$1.2 million\nin three separate installments for public improvements to Belle Isle, the Miami Beach neighborhood that is home to the hotel.",

        "content": "Shaya Prager is nearing the end of the shot clock while handling\nMidwest real estate disputes\n.\nThe mysterious investor from\nLakewood, New Jersey\n, who\nspent billions buying up suburban office properties\ndrilled by the pandemic, is losing his grip on a big Chicago-area corporate campus that has been tied up in foreclosure proceedings for nearly two years.\nHe has also drawn the ire of investors in Wisconsin nursing homes who claim he shorted them on payments and owes the state $3 million.\nThese advancing court battles are among many involving commercial real estate tied to Prager, whose firm Opal Holdings was a go-to buyer during the height of the pandemic until its controversial ground-lease strategy started to crack at some high-profile properties, such as the\ntallest tower in Fort Worth, Texas\n, that was seized from the landlord by a lender.\nNow, Prager is set to lose to control of another office property, this one in\nsuburban Chicago\n.\nIowa-based lender GreenState Credit Union is moving to confirm a court-ordered sheriff\u2019s sale totaling $66 million held last month for the four-building, 698,000-square-foot Corporate 500 complex in Deerfield, just north of Chicago at 500-540 Lake Cook Road. Prager has yet to file a motion objecting to the sale, with a deadline of Oct. 24.\nNeither Prager, GreenState nor attorneys for the investors in Wisconsin nursing homes who are suing Opal returned requests for comment.\nGreenState entered the picture after buying the loan note tied to the Corporate 500 property\u2019s leasehold interest, which is separately owned from the ground beneath it \u2014 such bifurcations were implemented frequently by Prager and his investment partner Katherine Cartagena during their buying spree.\nIn the case of the Deerfield property, Prager\u2019s Opal took out a $104 million loan from Unify Financial Credit Union to buy the building portion of the property, while also entering a 99-year ground lease with a Cartagena-led entity serving as landlord of the dirt. Prager\u2019s building ownership was set to pay annual rents to Cartagena\u2019s entity starting at $4.8 million per year in 2022, with 2 percent annual hikes as part of the deal.\nBut Prager allegedly defaulted on the leasehold loan from Unify in 2023, leading to a $106 million foreclosure lawsuit against the property\u2019s ownership.\nAlthough Prager initially tried to fight the foreclosure and the appointment of a receiver, a judge found Opal to be in default on the debt, and issued a $130 million judgment against the landlord that accounted for interest and fees. It\u2019s unclear how much GreenState paid Unify to take over the troubled loan note, but it was likely at a substantial discount to its face value.\nGreenState was able to use the judgment to make a credit bid for $66 million for the property at last month\u2019s sheriff\u2019s sale, meaning $64 million is still owed by the leasehold owner, a Prager affiliate, court records show.\n\nMeanwhile, Opal lost an initial ruling while trying to beat back the Wisconsin nursing homes investors\u2019 claims that they were shorted on payments by Prager\u2019s firm for years on deals involving four properties in small towns.\nA lawsuit the investors filed in a New Jersey court earlier this year alleged Opal transferred $860,000 out of the nursing homes to other parties, despite claiming the properties generated negative income of nearly $5 million between 2022 and 2024. The investors who sued say they were owed base rent payments by Opal as part of the operating agreements for the nursing homes, but that they were ignored. Simultaneously, unpaid property tax bills and assessments owed to the state of Wisconsin Department of Health Services stacked up, and the investors claim Opal owes more than $3 million to the state.\nWhile the New Jersey lawsuit was settled without prejudice earlier this year, meaning the claims could be revived later on, the investors have similar allegations against Opal moving forward through a suit in Wisconsin court. The investors are the funders of entities called GPH Fort Atkinson LLC; GPH Greenfield LLC; GPH Muscoda LLC; and Silver Spring Acquisition LLC.\nAt the nursing home Opal was operating in Fort Atkinson, deferred maintenance and a lack of repairs led to the property being named a \u201cSpecial Focus Facility\u201d under a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services program meant to get problematic assets back on track.\n\u201cThe Special Focus Facility program designates nursing facilities that have had a history of serious quality problems for increased visitations by state surveyors and more stringent enforcement actions for deficiencies identified by those state surveyors,\u201d the investors said in their suit. \u201cIn Wisconsin, only two of the approximately 330 nursing facilities in the state are designated as Special Focus Facilities.\u201d\nTwo more of the Opal-run facilities became candidates for the Special Focus program, the investors said. As of late last year, each of the facilities was under either an active designation or a candidate for the \u201cDenial of Payment for New Admissions\u201d designation by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, meaning the properties were suspended or close to being suspended from the right to receive reimbursement for admitting new Medicare patients.\nAs of Thursday, the Fort Atkinson property remains under the Special Focus designation, while another, the Silver Springs Health Care Center in Glendale, is still a candidate, according to\na list\npublished by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid.\nA Wisconsin federal judge denied Opal\u2019s motion to dismiss the allegations earlier this summer. The landlord has since answered the investors\u2019 complaint and raised affirmative defenses, including that they didn\u2019t take reasonable steps to reduce their own losses; that Opal may have had reasons for not paying the investors; and that Opal already paid at least some of what the investors say they are owed.\nThe parties have been tasked with working toward a settlement and, if unable to reach one, completing written discovery in the case by May.\nBack in suburban Chicago, however, the Corporate 500 property\u2019s financial health seems to be improving. During the foreclosure proceedings against Opal, the property\nlured a tenant to lease the entire campus\n, with the help of Illinois tax incentives. Vantive, a kidney care spinoff of medical device giant Baxter International, is set to invest $23 million into the property and make it a headquarters.\nThe lease was agreed to while the property was in control of a court-appointed receiver, and details of the deal have been obscured by the receiver\u2019s heavily redacted reports to the judge. It\u2019s unclear whether Prager, his partner Cartagena\u2019s ground landlord entity, GreenState or none of them will reap the benefits of the massive lease.\n",

        "content": "A Bay Area prep school is turning to municipal bonds to redevelop the historic anchor property of its campus on the San Francisco Peninsula.\nCrystal Springs Uplands School, located at 400 Uplands Drive in Hillsborough, is borrowing $26 million in\nmuni bonds\nto revamp the Uplands Mansion, a century-old former home, Bloomberg\nreported\n.\nThe $26 million from the California Enterprise Development Authority will help pay for the nearly $50 million makeover of the mansion that has served as the school\u2019s educational hub for nearly seven decades, according to Bloomberg.\n\u201cThis is really modernizing all of our teaching spaces,\u201d Brian Talbott, chief financial and operating officer of the school, told Bloomberg. \u201cClasses were being taught in rooms that were formerly bedrooms, and we had offices in rooms that were clearly formerly bathrooms, including multiple spaces where bathtubs were still in the person\u2019s office. So it was still very much a house.\u201d\nBuilt in 1917 for the grandson of railroad tycoon Charles Crocker, the Uplands Mansion features high-end touches like handmade marble fixtures from a 16th-century Italian castle. Crystal Springs acquired the mansion in 1956 as the first permanent location for the private school. It was originally founded as a girls\u2019 school and went co-ed in 1977.\nIn the years since then, Crystal Springs has built various facilities including a gymnasium, theater and artificial turf field on the 10 acres of land surrounding the mansion. It also grew into a second campus for its middle school. Today, the Uplands Mansion is now the centerpiece of the upper school campus, hosting several classrooms, offices and meeting spaces as well as a library.\n\nWith the funding injection, the school will renovate the building to add a modernized robotics workshop, physics lab and elevator, as well as structural improvements like a new HVAC system.\nThe $26 million deal marks Crystal Springs\u2019 first venture into the muni market for financing, having worked with private banks in the past to build its second location in\nBelmont\n. Other private schools similarly dove into the muni market last year after the 2023 banking crisis.\n\u201cWe have a loan with\nFirst Citizens Bank, formerly Silicon Valley Bank\n, on our middle school campus here,\u201d Talbott said. \u201cAs we started looking at our financing needs for the project at our upper school on the mansion, we explored essentially another loan with First Citizens as well as a debt offering.\u201d\nNaturally, the\ncollapse of Silicon Valley Bank\nduring the 2023 crisis made the school wary of working with a private bank again. \u201cThat did give pause, not just to us, but I imagine to many independent schools just because the market changed,\u201d Talbott said. \u201cHaving different options made a lot of sense then and still makes sense to my mind.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Rubin was arrested at his home in Fairfield, Connecticut. He also faces a bank fraud charge for allegedly lying to a lender about ongoing litigation while securing a mortgage for Powers\u2019 Texas home, which he financed.\nLawyers for Rubin and Powers declined to comment.\nThe case adds a criminal chapter to years of civil\nlitigation\nagainst Rubin. In 2022, he was ordered to pay $3.85 million to women who testified they were lured to his Manhattan penthouse for abusive encounters. His attorneys argued the women had consented and signed agreements, but a Brooklyn jury found him liable for sex trafficking and battery.\n\nProsecutors now allege Rubin and Powers ran a scheme that spanned a decade, arranging travel for women to meet Rubin under false pretenses.\nRubin\u2019s career trajectory once epitomized the excesses and innovations of 1980s Wall Street. At Salomon Brothers, he helped pioneer the collateralized mortgage obligation, a derivative that reshaped global finance. Lewis portrayed him in \u201cLiar\u2019s Poker\u201d as a cerebral young trader who analyzed homeowner behavior to predict mortgage prepayments. Rubin later parlayed that expertise into a $1 million-a-year deal at\nMerrill Lynch\n, before stints at Bear Stearns and, eventually,\nSoros Fund Management\n, where he ran mortgage-backed securities until 2015.\nRubin\u2019s name, once associated with financial engineering that fueled decades of real estate and credit growth, is now linked to an alleged criminal enterprise of coercion and abuse. His case also highlights the vulnerability of women recruited into sex work under the guise of consensual arrangements \u2014 a dynamic prosecutors say Rubin exploited with his wealth and power.\nIf convicted, Rubin faces the possibility of a lengthy prison sentence.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "As malls and retail spaces across Greater Los Angeles face increasing vacancies, an eyebrow-raising\u00a0\u2014 or rather, barbell raising \u2014 alternative has emerged to fill those voids.\nGym operators like Equinox and Royal Personal Training have signed some of the largest retail leases this year in the L.A. area, CoStar\nreported\n.\nRoyal Personal Training is growing its footprint from a 7,000-square-foot space in Beverly Hills to 30,000 square feet in the newly built mixed-use building at 639 North La Peer Drive in West Hollywood. The building boasts valet parking \u2014 a notable draw for a gym company known for attracting high-end clients.\nEquinox\nis gearing up to occupy a 30,000-square-foot retail space on the ground floor of an under-construction apartment building in Santa Monica. The Related-developed mixed-use building at 700 Broadway will include 196 apartments with luxury concierge services for residents. The new location is planned to open later this year.\nGold\u2019s Gym\nrecently had a soft opening for a 33,000-square-foot ground-level operation at the Beverly Center in Beverly Grove, according to CoStar. That location\u2019s opening comes about a year after Gold\u2019s opened a similarly sized 35,000-square-foot outpost at The Pike Outlets in Long Beach.\n\nPlanet Fitness, meanwhile, is picking up smaller spaces in suburban areas like Palmdale and Santa Clarita.\nVacant Rite Aid locations\nwith an average of 15,000 square feet appear to be Planet Fitness\u2019 spaces of choice.\nFor context, gym operators in Los Angeles typically sign leases for 5,000 square feet, according to CoStar. After the pandemic forced gym closures and decreased traffic for safety, it appears that the fitness business sector could be on the up and up. At the same time, retail vacancy ticked up in the second quarter to 5.6 percent, according to Kidder Mathews\u2019 Q2\nreport\n.\nFitness memberships climbed to a record 77 million last year from 72.9 million the year before, according to CoStar, citing data from the Health &amp; Fitness Association. In the first half of 2025, gym visits increased 3.5 percent compared to the first half of 2024.\nEquinox and Barry\u2019s Bootcamp are among the brands looking to capitalize on the growing demand for workout space. Last month, for example, Equinox\nsigned a similar 35,000-square-foot lease in Fort Lauderdale\n, Florida. Barry\u2019s is looking at opening 20 new studios annually in the coming years, according to CoStar.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "After a\nwhirlwind week of public meetings\n, Chicago real estate leaders are voicing concern about a new anti-gentrification ordinance that gives some South Side tenants in buildings with 10 or more units the right of first refusal when property owners look to sell.\nAs a result, City Council plans to host hearings on the ordinance, known as the Jackson Park Housing Pilot Program, next month, according to sources familiar with the city\u2019s plans.\n\u201cWe oppose the Jackson Park Housing Pilot Program ordinance and its onerous provisions for a tenant right of first refusal, but we are pleased that the City Council, under the leadership of Alderman Gilbert Villegas, will hold hearings on this policy. We are confident the hearings will lead to meaningful reforms,\u201d said Michael Glasser, president of the Neighborhood Building Owners Alliance lobbying group.\nVillegas did not respond to requests for comment regarding specific details of the hearings.\nCity council on Thursday passed the program that gives tenants in buildings with more than 10 units the right of first refusal, among other features aimed at preventing resident displacement. The new policies apply to much of the South Shore and Woodlawn neighborhoods.\nCritics have said giving tenants 180 days to form a union and purchase a building will slow down the sale process regardless of whether or not they\u2019re interested in banding together to buy the property. The possibility could deter future investment as well, opponents added.\n\u201cI imagine banks would not like that. Banks don\u2019t really like anything new and that provision is only going to kind of make it a little harder to get a deal done, and deals are already hard to get done,\u201d said Craig Yarborough of South Side-based Click Development.\n\nThe new ordinance is similar to another anti-gentrification effort that recently took effect in some Northwest Side neighborhoods known as the Northwest Side Housing Preservation Ordinance. Villegas\nrequested that his ward be removed\nfrom its purview, as did Alderman Felix Cardona Jr.\n\u201cIf a prospective buyer needs to wait 180 days from an offer, there will be no buyers. Owners will not invest and banks will not lend with this obstacle and why would they? It limits liquidity for the parties,\u201d David Goss, co-founder of multifamily brokerage Interra Realty, said on social media. \u201cLook no further than the northwest side of Chicago where this ROFR has been such an abject failure that two aldermen removed their wards.\u201d\nSo far, no South Side aldermen have opposed the Jackson Park ordinance.\nBut at least one developer has cited the Northwest Side Preservation Ordinance as reason not to build in the area.\n\u201cAs the person that does acquisitions, that\u2019s probably an area we wouldn\u2019t really target right now because of that. It just adds complication \u2026 and we operate at very low margins. We\u2019re a nonprofit. We\u2019re not maximizing rent,\u201d said Russell Rydin, COO of nonprofit affordable housing development firm Chicago Metropolitan Housing Development Corporation.\nProponents of the Jackson Park plan, which also calls for the sale of vacant city-owned lots for redevelopment into multifamily housing, say it\u2019s a necessary backstop ahead of the opening of the Obama Presidential Library, which is expected to drive investment to the area that could raise property values and, thus, taxes that burden low-income households and lead to their exits from the neighborhood.\n\u201cAnybody who does not want to support this or be a part of the solution, you are part of the problem,\u201d Alderwoman Jeanette Taylor of the 20th Ward said at\na Wednesday committee meeting\nreviewing the ordinance.\nWhile the new rule identifies 184 city-owned lots for potential redevelopment into multifamily residences, the right of first refusal could give some developers pause.\n\u201cInstead of addressing supply challenges, policies like this only make the problem worse. Chicago doesn\u2019t have a demand issue, it has a supply issue,\u201d KMA Properties president Devin Rowland wrote on social media. \u201cUntil policy shifts toward encouraging development and investment, affordability and growth will remain out of reach.\u201d",

        "content": "The lure of a Salesforce tower sublease is blowing Wind Point Partners away from its longtime Magnificent Mile office for a shiny perch along the river.\nThe Chicago-based private equity firm is in advanced talks to sublease about 24,000 square feet at\nSalesforce Tower\n, the 60-story building at 333 West Wolf Point Plaza, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. If completed, Wind Point would leave its offices at 676 North Michigan Avenue, continuing the broader trend of firms abandoning the corridor for modern spaces clustered near transit and the city\u2019s central business hub.\nSan Francisco-based Salesforce has been marketing roughly 120,000 square feet it leased two-and-a-half years ago but\nnever occupied\nin the 1.2 million-square-foot Wolf Point Plaza tower.\nNewmark\ngrabbed a portion of that space this summer, making Wind Point the latest tenant to buy into the appeal of Chicago\u2019s newest office skyscraper.\nThe tower was developed by Hines and Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises and delivered in 2023.\nIn the Loop submarket, even as overall office vacancy hovers near record highs, demand for premium buildings has pushed rents at trophy towers up 26 percent since 2020, according to Colliers. In contrast, average asking rents across downtown have barely budged.\nMag Mile landlords, meanwhile, are\nlosing ground\n. A generation ago, ad agencies and creative shops filled its towers, but much of that demand has been replaced by health care institutions looking for clinics and admin space in Streeterville. Some traditional office landlords have been forced to pivot entirely: Connecticut-based Marc Realty recently bought the mostly vacant 500 North Michigan Avenue to convert its offices into 320 apartments.\n\nWind Point would not be the first private equity firm to bail on 676 North Michigan. Flexpoint Ford decamped for Wacker Drive late last year. The tower, which also houses the Omni Chicago Hotel, has struggled to hold onto tenants as firms gravitate toward newer glass-and-steel high-rises. TRT Holdings, the Dallas-based owner, did not return a request for comment.\nFounded in 1984, Wind Point manages about $6 billion in assets and raised its largest fund ever \u2014 $2.3 billion \u2014 last year. Savills brokers Brandon Nasatir and John Goodman are representing the firm in lease negotiations, while CBRE is marketing Salesforce\u2019s sublease space.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The family behind Dallas\u2019 NorthPark Center is close to sealing a $900 million refinancing that would restructure the mall\u2019s debt and buy out its institutional partner, bringing full ownership back to the Nasher-Haemisegger clan for the first time in a decade.\nA Fitch Ratings presale report shows the family lined up a two-year, floating-rate CMBS loan from Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, plus $300 million in mezzanine financing, Bisnow\nreported\n. Proceeds will wipe out $650 million of old debt and acquire J.P. Morgan Asset Management\u2019s 60 percent equity stake in the mall, at 8687 North Central Expressway. The bank bought into the 1.9 million-square-foot property in 2014 through its Strategic Property Fund.\nNorthPark \u2014 developed in 1965 by\nRaymond Nasher\nand now operated by his daughter Nancy Nasher and her husband David Haemisegger through NorthPark Management Company \u2014 is one of the most successful malls in the country. Cushman &amp; Wakefield appraised it at $1.6 billion in August, pegging the debt package at a 55.5 percent loan-to-value ratio, or 63.5 percent when mezzanine loans are included. The mall generated $1.4 billion in sales last year, with anchors\nDillard\u2019s\n, Macy\u2019s, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Eataly and AMC accounting for $499 million of that haul.\n\nNorthPark is almost fully leased. Occupancy hit nearly 99 percent in June, and it hasn\u2019t dipped below 93 percent in the past decade. Nearly 40 percent of tenants are exclusive to the mall within the Dallas market, helping drive repeat traffic despite a crowded luxury landscape. CBRE\u2019s Elizabeth Herman Fulton said the property\u2019s private ownership structure allows for an unusually curated tenant mix, keeping NorthPark \u201ccool\u201d while other regional malls have lost their luster.\nThe Nasher-Haemiseggers have invested more than $25 million into capital improvements, including a south exterior revamp in 2018 and roof and HVAC replacements last year. Only Galleria Dallas and Grapevine Mills boast similar occupancy levels in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metro, according to Fitch.\nStill, competition looms. Just south, along Knox Street and Henderson Avenue, two\nmixed-use projects\nare slated to deliver about 180,000 square feet of high-end retail and dining next year.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher",

        "content": "Compass\u2019 quest for dominance\nis no industry secret, but it pulled off a shocking reveal.\nThe nation\u2019s largest brokerage by sales volume announced on Monday that it would merge with the industry\u2019s No. 2 heavy hitter, Anywhere Real Estate.\nThe acquisition, set to close next year, values Anywhere at\n$1.6 billion\nand would put Compass CEO Robert Reffkin at the helm of the titanic brokerage with his firm holding on to 78 percent of the ownership. Together, the agent count of the two firms would total around 340,000, and the companies, once combined, estimated their enterprise value at a whopping $10 billion.\nNews of the deal\nsent shockwaves\nacross the industry and raised questions about the duo\u2019s control over the residential market, especially in markets where the firms are most active.\nIn New York City, Anywhere is better known through its subsidiaries, some of which are among the city\u2019s top-producing brokerages. A deal to combine it with Compass would bring the two leading firms in Manhattan and Brooklyn under the same umbrella.\nTogether, Compass and Corcoran closed more than $9 billion in sell-side deals in Manhattan and $3.2 billion in Brooklyn in 2024, according to\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nlatest ranking\nof the city\u2019s top brokerages.\nCompass and Anywhere\u2019s brands and franchises accounted for roughly $15 billion in on-market, sell-side transactions across Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens last year \u2014 about 26 percent of the $57 billion in deals closed in the boroughs during the same time period.\nCompass, three Anywhere brands \u2014 Corcoran, Sotheby\u2019s International and Coldwell Banker Warburg \u2014 and Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, which Compass acquired this year, were among the top 10 brokerages in Manhattan with a combined sales volume of roughly $11 billion.\nThough the companies represent just a quarter of the total volume across the three boroughs, their presence in the luxury market is likely more outsized, as Compass, Corcoran and Sotheby\u2019s International Real Estate are leaders in those markets.\nMamdani or not, NYC real estate is doing just fine\nThat\u2019s the sentiment Compass agent Heather Domi expressed at a panel discussion on Thursday hosted by the New York Residential Agent Continuum, an organization she helped found in 2018, and the Master Brokers Forum in Miami.\n\u201cNever bet against New York City and New Yorkers,\u201d Domi said, referencing a quote from Barbara Corcoran. \u201cThat has held true time and time and time again. We will be fine.\u201d\n\nLuxury brokers seized on the Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani to hypothesize that wealthy New Yorkers could ditch the city for greener, more tax- and business-friendly, pastures. Some South Florida-based agents have jumped on the bandwagon, with one top broker, Dina Goldentayer,\ntaking out an ad\nin Times Square urging Manhattanites to move to Miami.\n\u201cI love New York and I want New York to always, always shine,\u201d said Alicia Cervera Lamadrid of Florida-based Cervera Real Estate. \u201cI am not excited about your mayoral election. I am terrified.\u201d\n\u201cBut New York\u2019s success is Miami\u2019s success,\u201d she added.\nDomi said she has seen contract activity in the Big Apple\nhas dipped\n22 percent year-over-year in the first three weeks of September, a drop-off she attributed, in part, to a hesitancy in the market ahead of the mayoral election in November.\nBut even if the numbers show signs of slowing down, Domi said that deals are still coming in and her business is running full steam ahead.\n\u201cWe are getting impacted,\u201d Domi said. \u201cBut anecdotally, we\u2019ve got lower interest rates, and I\u2019m super busy. People who have been dragging their feet and waiting are now pulling the trigger.\u201d\nSerhant expands to the Ocean State\nRyan Serhant is continuing his\nEast Coast sprawl\nwith an outpost in Rhode Island.\nThe celebrity broker is opening an office in Newport, Rhode Island, in October, HousingWire first reported on Friday. He\u2019s launching his eponymous firm in the tony New England beach town with five founding agents who, together, notched roughly $550 million in sales over the past 12 months.\nSerhant\u2019s latest expansion marks the 13th state where the brokerage now has operations after the firm started spreading its reach beyond New York City two years ago. The brokerage initially set up shops along the East Coast, though it has since planted its flag in Arizona.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe priciest deal to hit the city register this week was for a co-op at 998 Fifth Avenue, which sold for roughly\n$38 million\n. Evan Cheng, the co-founder of a cryptocurrency company, bought the four-bedroom apartment from cosmetics heir William Lauder in an off-market deal.\nLauder, the grandchild of the Est\u00e9e Lauder founders, purchased Unit 6W for about $24 million in 2017. The co-op also features five bathrooms, an eat-in kitchen and views of Central Park.\n",

        "content": "Want a\nhot take\non Compass\u2019 $1.6 billion deal for Anywhere Real Estate that you haven\u2019t already heard?\nLet\u2019s start from the top and work our way down.\nAn industry veteran in L.A.\u2019s high end jumped a few steps forward to conjecture about the end game. No, that doesn\u2019t mean market share and stamping out competition. Those are the tactics to achieve the strategic end of Compass creating a proprietary marketplace that gives them more control over splits, suggested this executive, who requested anonymity.\n\u201cI suspect this is not about creating a bigger brokerage per se because, at least for the foreseeable future, you would just have a bigger, less profitable brokerage with a lot of debt,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is more about Compass positioning itself to better overturn Clear Cooperation and become a real estate search \u2018portal\u2019 with listings no one else has.\n\u201cIf this is successful, they will create a direct link with the consumer and use that link to \u2018sell\u2019 that consumer back to the agent in the form of a lower percentage of the commission. What the agents fail to understand is that this is the first play in a long game to reduce their splits. I do not expect Compass to admit this.\u201d\nEveryone\u2019s been dissecting the consumer-facing implications of market-share consolidation. This view speculates that Compass will use scale of listings to roll back the generous splits that have been used by Compass and others to woo and retain star agents.\nAfter all, once you\u2019re large enough, rubbing a star Beverly Hills or Malibu agent the wrong way may not matter like it still does these days.\nRedundancies and such\nRent and staff.\nThey\u2019re the two biggest expenses on a balance sheet, Nourmand &amp; Associates President Michael Nourmand pointed out this past week in chatting about the Compass-Anywhere news. They\u2019re also the first things to be scrutinized when reducing expenditures.\nThis is M&amp;A 101,\u201d Nourmand said. \u201cWhat is M&amp;A 101? The first thing you do is say, \u2018Nothing\u2019s going to change\u2019 and then you slowly make changes, and you try to plan them out and make them incremental enough that people say, \u2018Oh, well, we had to move offices, but I still have my manager so it\u2019s OK.\u2019 And then \u2018Oh, the marketing guy or marketing lady I really liked they got rid of her, but I heard this other one\u2019s good.\u2019 [Compass] didn\u2019t come and make this bold, risky acquisition to let the brands be independent. You buy companies to make changes.\u201d\nIn fact, rent across what would be the combined entity\u2019s brokerage brand portfolio was one of the first subjects brought up by those who weighed in on the Compass-Anywhere deal this week.\n\u201cYou have too many of the same thing in the same area,\u201d said Westside Estate Agency co-founder Stephen Shapiro, \u201cIf it were me, I\u2019d be consolidating. Rents aren\u2019t cheap and then you have to have staffing. You have to have computers. You have to have telephones and all the things it takes to run an office. It\u2019s unwieldy.\u201d\nPlease, sir, can I have more paper clips?\nThe pending deal and the presence of so many major boutique players in L.A. leads to the question of what makes people tick and why some choose to remain fiercely\nindependent\n.\nSo, I asked\nWestside Estate Agency\nco-founder Stephen Shapiro why. He and business partner Kurt Rappaport have remained independent for the past 26 years.\n\u201cOnce you own your own ship and you make your own decisions, you don\u2019t want to go and make a request to New York or New Jersey for paper clips,\u201d Shapiro said.\nOther factors range from risk tolerance to maintaining speed of operations.\n\u201cOver the years, we have fielded offers to buy us out, but it never made any sense to lose the independence,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cSome years we make a lot of money. Some years we don\u2019t make any money, but that\u2019s up to us to decide what happens at the end of the day. I can\u2019t imagine having to talk to some regional manager to say \u2018Oh, I came across a great new video program. How do we get to use this?\u2019 and then not getting an answer. It\u2019s not the nature of the owner of an independent business unless you\u2019re paid enough to walk away. And you\u2019re not paid enough to walk away because everything is based on future performance.\u201d\n\nFor as much talk of tech as the differentiator in nearly any business, WEA and others like it tout a more personalized route.\n\u201cWhen one of my agents has a problem, they have me to come to,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cThey have Kurt [Rappaport] to come to. They have [executive vice president and general manager] Colin [Keenan] to come to. Between me and Kurt, there\u2019s no deal that could possibly be made that we haven\u2019t been a part of one just like it and know how to answer.\u201d\nHiltons head to Compass\nAs many ponder whether\nboutiques\nwill benefit from corporate brokerage consolidation,\nBarron Hilton and Tessa Hilton\nwent another way. They announced their jump to Compass on Thursday.\nIntriguing move.\nThe Hiltons were co-founders and co-CEOs of Beverly Hills-based Hilton Hilton. Their departure leaves co-founder and Hilton Hilton chair\nRick Hilton\nnow steering the ship.\nStatements provided to\nThe Real Deal\nfrom Barron and Tessa Hilton, who were unavailable for an interview, offered some additional insight on their decision.\n\u201cWe are making a strategic move to Compass to position not only ourselves, but most importantly our clients, for long-term success in an increasingly competitive market,\u201d the Hiltons said.\nThe husband-and-wife duo will be based in Beverly Hills and will also have a presence in Palm Beach with plans to expand in additional markets.\nHow many Hilton Hilton agents follow the couple to Compass or move elsewhere is likely to play out over the coming weeks and months.\nWhat Mark said\nOne more for the road,\u00a0 sticking with the Compass-Anywhere theme.\nIn case you missed it,\nTRD\ncaught up with former Compass California president and, more recently, chief real estate strategist Mark McLaughlin earlier this month after it was learned the executive had transitioned to a part-time mergers and acquisitions\nadvisory role\nat the brokerage.\nDigging into the\nsubject of M&amp;A\n, McLaughlin projected the pace of deals could quicken beyond what the industry\u2019s seen the past couple of years.\nResidential brokerages, McLaughlin said, generally trade at a multiple of 3 to 5.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. But, today\u2019s M&amp;A deals aren\u2019t simple multiplication.\nNon-recurring expenses must be factored in. That includes legal fees or last year\u2019s National Association of Realtors-related commission settlement that can impact EBITDA, which is used to gauge a business\u2019s cash flow, ability to pay down debt or valuation.\n\u201cThe thing you have to keep in context is four years ago, five years ago, the negotiation between buyer and seller was, \u2018What\u2019s my multiple of EBITDA going to be?\u2019\u201d McLaughlin said at the time. \u201cNow, it\u2019s \u2018How many adjustments can I make to my EBITDA so we can work out a deal?\u2019\u201d\nIf McLaughlin is correct, let\u2019s see what else emerges on the sales block.\n",

        "content": "Fights over multifamily policy, suburban retail revival and fresh investment in the office sector shaped Chicago real estate markets this week. From Fulton Market to Burr Ridge to South Shore, here\u2019s what mattered.\nThe drama surrounding embattled multifamily firm CKO Real Estate escalated when its\nex-investor Shai Wolkowicki\nlobbed a $10.8 million lawsuit at\nfounder Chikoo Patel, accusing him of running the firm as a \u201cPonzi-like scheme.\u201d\nThe allegations \u2014 misuse of investor funds, siphoning money into personal accounts \u2014 read like a playbook from the worst days of cheap credit. The dispute extends a trend of lawsuits popping up nationally as cracks form in the multifamily syndication boom of the last five years that thrived on low rates and easy money.\nIn Fulton Market,\nSterling Bay\nunloaded an\nentitled development site for $18 million\n, taking a loss from its previous purchase price. Local investor Marc Bortz was the buyer. While still the hottest ZIP in town for trophy developments,\nFulton Market land prices\nare cooling as rising construction and operational costs reset property values everywhere.\nSuburban retail told the opposite story. Edward Hassan and\nAdam Firsel\nsold the once-distressed\nBurr Ridge Village Center for $55 million\n, notching a tidy payday that shows how open air commerce centers have become a winner amid\nbrick and mortar retail\u2019s rebound\n.\nAlso in Burr Ridge, the late rapper\nJuice WRLD\u2019s mother listed her estate for $7.2 million\nafter three years of owning the home, which is currently the second-priciest listing in the western suburb, behind a\n$10 million ask\n.\n\nAt Chicago\u2019s high end, a\nSt. Regis penthouse fetched $7.5 million\n, another data point showing Chicago\u2019s ultra-luxury condo market is climbing out from a hole. A West Loop penthouse condo in a\nSulo Development project\nthis week also fetched over $5.2 million as raw space, meaning the sellers are likely to spend significantly more on finishing the unit.\nChicago residential brokers were\nbuzzing about the planned Compass acquisition\nof Anywhere Real Estate and its impact on the local market. The tie-up\nconsolidates power\nin an industry already wrestling with commission lawsuits and shifting consumer behavior.\nOn the policy front, activists scored wins in the Housing Committee and Chicago City Council this week by pushing\nSouth Side right-of-first-refusal and just-cause eviction rules\n. Landlords and investors, unsurprisingly, are\ngearing up to fight\n. Chicago\u2019s battle lines\necho national trends as cities from Washington D.C. to San Francisco debate\nsimilar anti-gentrification tools.\nThe office market produced two substantial Chicago investments, one a purchase and another a lease.\n601W Companies is circling the\nlong-distressed Brookfield-owned property at 175 West Jackson Boulevard\n. The New York-based buyer has\nmade a business of scooping up Chicago\u2019s troubled towers\n, and its latest move fits a broader national playbook: opportunistic capital targeting landlords caught on refinancing cliffs.\nMeanwhile, private equity firm\nWind Point Partners is subleasing office space in Salesforce Tower\n, highlighting how trophy assets are weathering the storm. The deal underscores a national trend \u2014 even as office demand slumps, the newest Class A towers are still drawing tenants from weaker buildings.",

        "content": "Things just keep getting worse for Norman Kravetz.\nThe Realty Bancorp Equities principal defaulted this summer on the commercial mortgage-backed securities debt connected to a five-office-property portfolio, and now faces calls to cede control to a court-appointed receiver.\nThe calls are coming via a Wells Fargo Bank unit on behalf of the commercial mortgage-backed securities holders.\nKravetz-linked entities are on the hook for around $70 million, which is more than five-building portfolio is worth.\nThe 346,800-square-foot portfolio is spread over the San Fernando Valley, including three properties in Agoura Hills \u2014 one of which was home to the Los Angeles Rams for years before the team\u2019s billionaire owner Stan Kroenke moved headquarters as part of a $10 billion development plan at Warner Center \u2014 and one in Calabasas and another in Woodland Hills.\nThe five offices were valued at $101.6 million at underwriting in September 2019, a few months before the pandemic was declared and remote work took over. In July, the portfolio was appraised at $48.85 million. Occupancy was 71 percent and properties were not making enough money to pay off debt, running a debt service coverage ratio ranging downward to 0.59.\nThis isn\u2019t the first bad bet Kravetz has made. Realty Bancorp Equities\ndefaulted\non more than $100 million in loans tied to an office complex in Santa Monica; the company later sold the property at a price that didn\u2019t cover its debt.\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported on Kravetz\u2019s delinquency on the five-building portfolio, after his debt landed in\nspecial servicing\n, and a multimillion dollar\nhaircut\nto the portfolio before the matter headed to court.\nStay tuned for more.\nKravetz could not be reached for comment.\nLeaning tower of Pasadena\nSouthern California\u2019s landscape of office distress goes beyond one valley: A nine-story property called the Pasadena Office Tower in the heart of the San Gabriel Valley faces\nforeclosure\nafter its owners defaulted on $40 million debt.\n\nThe default notice and foreclosure threat came after the owners, entities connected to Albert Taban and Michael Pashaie, managing partners at Jade Enterprises and Golden West Properties, saw the property\u2019s\nvalue\ncut by more than half as tenants cleared out.\nNow the 142,000-square-foot office, which is 69 percent occupied, is only worth $23 million.\nThat value is on paper, though, and we\u2019ll have to see if the current trend of deep discounts on office properties eats up that slim margin, too.\nSchool daze on multifamily\nSpeaking of vacancies, Azusa Pacific University\nsold\nan uninhabited apartment complex to Legacy Partners for $91.8 million.\nThe university received tax exempt financing for the property that would become student housing \u2014 but occupancy lagged in the post-pandemic era on college campuses, leading to the sale.\nHudson Pacific cuts, adds to board\nHudson Pacific Properties announced\nmore changes\nto its board of directors. Mark D. Linehan left the publicly traded real estate investment trust after 14 years and was replaced by T. Ritson Ferguson.\nIn a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the company said Linehan stepped down \u201cdue to his desire to devote more of his time to other professional commitments,\u201d and that he \u201cexpressed no disagreement with the company.\u201d\nFerguson was the chief executive of CBRE Global Investors and now an investment committee member.\nFerguson\u2019s cash compensation, per the Hudson Pacific\u2019s non-employee director compensation program, amounts to $40,000 for an annual retainer and $12,500 for being a member of the audit committee. He could elect to receive vested shares of the company\u2019s common stock instead of that cash \u2014 but he is already set to earn an annual award of restricted stock units valued at $90,000.\n",

        "content": "Homegrown\nAnthropic\nis looking to ramp up its arms race against OpenAI \u2014 not just for the best artificial intelligence technology, but for the most office space in San Francisco.\nThe Dario Amodei-led firm, hot off a $13 billion Series F round, just added a 100,000-square- feet lease across several floors at the Foundry Square III building in downtown to its footprint in the city.\nThe new digs are across the street from Anthropic\u2019s current headquarters at Foundry Square IV, where it subleases more than 230,000 square feet from Slack. That deal marked one of the largest local transactions in years, though it clearly trails the AI frontrunner in the physical space race. OpenAI has\nleased buildings\nspanning nearly 1 million square feet for its headquarters operations in Mission Bay.\nAnthropic\u2019s growth pattern on office space resembles OpenAI, which subleased nearly half a million square feet of offices at 1455 and 1515 Third Street in Mission Bay from Uber in October 2023. The following September, the Sam Altman-led firm grabbed an additional 315,000 square feet next door at 550 Terry A. Francois Boulevard.\nWhen OpenAI celebrated its grand opening of its Mission Bay headquarters in March, executives pledged to double its current San Francisco-based workforce of 2,000 employees.\nThe influx of AI workers to San Francisco and the Bay Area is expected to bring in more than 50,000 employees in the sector over the next five years, according to experts at CBRE. That\u2019s projected to\nslash the city\u2019s office vacancy rate\nin half as tenants in the red-hot sector more than quadruple the amount of office space used by AI firms from 5 million square feet to more than 20 million. Currently, the city faces a 34.6 percent office vacancy rate \u2014 reflecting a so-far slow recovery from a peak of 36.9 percent in the third quarter of last year.\nA new report from VTS indicates a change of pace, though, with demand more than doubling in the past year. AI companies are expected to accelerate the trend in the coming months. As of last month, there\u2019s been a 107 percent increase in office demand year-over-year in San Francisco. That\u2019s up more than 350 percent since ChatGPT was first released to the public in late 2022,\naccording\nto the San Francisco Business Times.\nEx-Apple chief takes a bite out of Belvedere\nJony Ive\nis adding to his Bay Area real estate collection.\nThe Apple design chief-turned-AI entrepreneur dropped $73 million on four houses in Belvedere. Three of the properties in the bayside Marin County enclave are next to each other at the end of Golden Gate Avenue, while the fourth is nearby on Beach Road. The largest of the homes, boasting five bedrooms, 11 bathrooms and four fireplaces, sold for $43.5 million.\nIve\u2019s purchases come after the Io Products founder spent tens of millions of dollars on nearly a block of property in San Francisco\u2019s Jackson Square neighborhood. The AI device pioneer also owns a mansion in San Francisco\u2019s Pacific Heights.\nHistoric buildings headed for reimagination\n\nMayor Daniel Lurie is going back to the future to address San Francisco\u2019s housing crunch.\nLurie\u2019s PermitSF zoning push now includes vacant historic buildings that he sees as ripe for conversion, covering everything from old churches to museum space to hotels.\nThe mayor\nintroduced legislation\nthat would enable entities such \u00a0nonprofits, retailers, movie theaters and nightlife operators to set up shop in one of the city\u2019s approximately 300 historic buildings without having to endure lengthy approval processes. It\u2019s part of Lurie\u2019s endeavor to spur redevelopment of private\u00a0 spaces by cutting red tape and unshackling businesses from what some see as outdated zoning rules.\nLurie\u2019s proposed law seeks to reform current preservation standards that present hurdles to potential tenants by preventing certain alterations or making them prohibitively expensive.\n\u201cAdding greater flexibility for these special buildings will ensure they won\u2019t fall into disrepair due to disinvestment,\u201d the Mayor\u2019s Office\nsaid\nof the proposal.\nParking-to-housing advances in one Bay Area city\nOut of a handful of Bay Area municipalities that have floated building housing on parking lots, Menlo Park has beat out Palo Alto and Los Altos with an actual plan.\nThe Peninsula city is\nseeking proposals\nfrom developers for multifamily housing combined with public parking and possibly retail or commercial components. Officials hope to turn three city-owned parking lots on Oak Grove Avenue between University Drive and El Camino Real into affordable housing properties.\nAlliant Communities, MidPen Housing, Presidio Bay Ventures and a joint venture between Related Companies and Alta Housing have already each been approved to submit one proposal. Interested developers must submit development proposals that would help the city create at least 345 residential units for low-income and extremely-low-income households.\nLocal business owners aren\u2019t too hot on the idea, though. The Save Downtown Menlo group has been\nopposed to the idea\n, criticizing the apparent rush to meet the city\u2019s housing goals with a quick fix in one spot.\nDevelopers have until Dec. 15\nto submit proposals to the city.\n",

Between June 25 and July 11, right after Cuomo\u2019s loss to Mamdani, Adams raised more than $480,000 from real estate, making him the clear industry frontrunner. But after current and former members of his administration were indicted in August \u200b\u200bon charges related to speeding up construction approvals and steering contracts to certain developers, the fundraising slowed down significantly.\nBetween July 12 and August 18, Adams brought in a little more $60,500 from real estate donors. That was slightly above the $53,700 Cuomo brought in during that period.\n\nAdams\u2019 campaign sued the board last month to try and force the release of $4.7 million in public matching funds.\nThe question remains whether Adams\u2019 dropping out will be a boost to Cuomo\u2019s campaign. A recent Suffolk University poll found Mamdani in the lead with 45 percent of the vote, followed by Cuomo at 25 percent and then Adams and Sliwa trailed behind at 7 percent and 11 percent, respectively.\nIn the video posted today, Adams continued to tout his leadership when it came to housing. \u201cWe built more housing in one term than any administration before us and removed barriers to build even more,\u201d he said.\n",

(The other was\n942 North Alpine Drive\n, which went for $51.8 million in the same month.) You can see the top 10 by clicking\nhere\n.\nThe price paid by Stancheck Capital LLC for the two-story estate at 1028 Ridgedale Drive was a reduction from its original 2023\nask of $85 million\n.\nPacker, a billionaire and the former chair of entertainment company Crown Resorts, bought the 12-bedroom, 18-bathroom mansion for\nover $60 million\nin July 2018.\n\nA white mansion with a black front door and black shutters, the home was built on 1.2 acres in 1930. The home spans 24,325 square feet of living space across a number of structures. Amenities include gym, office, pool house and guest quarters, theater with bar, game room, wine cellar and cigar room.\nKurt Rappaport of Westside Estate Agency and Drew Fenton of Carolwood Estates represented Packer in the deal. Rappaport also represented the buyer.\nJennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck rented the home and Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman lived there for nearly two decades before selling it to developers Stuart and Stephanie Liner\nin 2015\nfor $26.6 million, according to records. The Liners then extensively renovated the estate.\nThe sale comes on the heels of Packer\u2019s\n$110 million\npurchase of \u201cLe Belvedere\u201d at 630 Nimes Road in Bel-Air in March. The estate underwent extensive construction over the past five and a half years to basically rebuild the home from the ground up. Packer told an Australian media outlet,\nnews.com.au\n, in March that he intended to move into the 10-bed, 15-bath home mid-year.\nPacker was the largest shareholder in Crown Resorts, a casino operator, before U.S. private equity giant Blackstone bought it in February 2022 for $6.4 billion. He is the son of late billionaire Kerry Packer, an Australian media tycoon.\n",

        "content": "New York City\u2019s new development market is facing a reckoning in 2026.\nIt\u2019s not that demand has ground to a halt. A number of new buildings launched in the last year have sold quickly and with few discounts.\nBut the new buildings for buyers to tour in the back half of the year have all but disappeared in the proverbial fog of high financing costs and scarce assemblage opportunities, a trend that will only continue into next year, according to data shared from new development teams and analysts in the city.\nIn the second quarter of this year, the 3,600 unsold units in Manhattan marked a 10-year low, according to data from Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, and that number will only shrink heading into next year.\nThis year, only five more buildings are projected to deliver 245 units in Manhattan, according to data from Brown Harris Stevens Development Marketing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s surprising to me that it\u2019s taken so long for so many people to actually catch on, because this has been in the making for quite some time,\u201d said Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group president Kelly Mack.\nCaught between cycles\n\u201cIn terms of actual inventory delivery to the market, you\u2019re seeing a lull,\u201d said Reuveni Development Marketing\u2019s Daniel Pupke. \u201cWe\u2019re in between two eras of cycles.\u201d\nThe first was the\npost-pandemic boom\nthat brought one of the best markets the city had seen in years. Buyers rushed into available buildings, while developers scooped up parcels with cheap financing.\n\u201cPeople bought and mobilized very quickly,\u201d Pupke said, pointing out that many of those projects had seen success since coming to market in the last 18 months.\nTake Avdoo\u2019s 105-unit Boerum Hill project, Bergen. The firm\nacquired the site for $44 million\nat the end of 2021, and six months later had filed permits for the condo project. The project launched sales in the spring of last year and has been one of the best-selling condos in the city, with over 70 of its units sold.\nBut when interest rates\nrose heading into 2023\n, the first step of the development cycle was \u201cessentially on pause unless you had a contract and financing,\u201d Pupke said.\n\u201cThe biggest factor in why we have less new projects today on the market is available equity,\u201d said BHSDM managing director Robin Schneiderman. \u201cThat, to me, is what sort of drives the market overall.\u201d\nThe equity dry spell went hand-in-hand with an increase in land prices, making ground-up developments more difficult to pencil, and the 2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act that made it more difficult to convert rental buildings to condominiums.\nFrom the midpoint of 2025 to the end of year, only 1,450 units are expected to be delivered to the market on a yearly basis, a 29 percent decrease from historic average, and new development sales outpaced launches by 60 percent this year, according to Mack.\nBright spots\nAmid the downturn, the Upper East Side stands out. The neighborhood is expected to bring more units to the market through the end of 2026 than has historically been the case.\nThe largest launch there will be Related Companies\u2019 144-unit rental-to-condo conversion, The Strathmore, at 400 East 84th Street, which Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group will be selling.\n\nThe project, which will have some units offered at under $1,800 per square foot, is also filling a gap in what Mack referred to as entry-level inventory.\n\u201cWith new projects harder and more expensive to build and finance, most new projects are coming in at higher price points than we\u2019ve historically seen,\u201d she said, making the under $1,800 per square foot offerings \u201cincreasingly rare.\u201d The average annual delivery of units in that price range will fall by over 60 percent through the end of 2026, according to data from Corcoran Sunshine.\nAcross the park, the Upper West Side is bereft of development opportunities, on track to exhaust its new development inventory as soon as 2027, according to Mack, with only 30 units expected to be released in the neighborhood through the end of 2026.\nThe only other development over 100 units with a planned sales launch this year is Rotem Rosen\u2019s Billionaire\u2019s Row development at 126 East 57th Street, the Malabar Residences. The project, which is being sold by Douglas Elliman Development Marketing, recently lost its sales director when\nNoble Black departed for Corcoran last week\n.\n\u201cThere\u2019s some very high price profile, sort of exciting new developments are going to enter the market, but they\u2019re going to be in the luxury category and the super luxury category,\u201d Mack said.\nOne noteworthy market entrant will be the Brodsky Organization and Sorgente Group\u2019s 38-unit conversion project at the Flatiron Building, where some onlookers have said prices could reach as high\nas $6,000 per square foot\n.\nGrid Group\u2019s boutique 22-unit Chelsea project will also launch sales this year, offering 16 parking spaces.\nThe two developments fit the mold of what\u2019s coming to the market downtown, where buyer demand remains relentless: boutique, private and expensive. Projects like 140 Jane Street and The Katharine, which quickly sold seven of its 8 units after launching sales this spring, have laid out a playbook for developers that can find assemblages below 34th Street.\nLarger projects expected to come to market next year include Elad Group\u2019s condo conversion at 419 Park Avenue South and Continuum Company\u2019s 137-unit development at 26 East 35th Street, according to data shared by Corcoran Sunshine.\nBrooklyn is facing many of the same issues, albeit at a smaller scale. The nearly 1,000 units in the pipeline for next year are well above the yearly historical average of 535, according to data from BHSDM, but the average condo size is just 17 units, as many of the borough\u2019s projects center on brownstone conversions or smaller ground up developments.\nSales are expected to launch in the first quarter of next year at Charney Companies 182-unit project at 95 Rockwell Place in Fort Greene, according to a spokesperson for the project. Urban Development Partners will also be launching sales at a 71-unit project at 285 Schermerhorn Street this year in Downtown Brooklyn.\nLooking ahead\nThe good news for developers is that any project coming online in the next several years will face limited competition.\n\u201cI think that if you today presented a B+ or better site with views, you could be extremely successful if you deliver in three to five years,\u201d Pupke said.\nHe added that the activity around projects have shifted and developers are buying again.\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t see action following the conversations that were happening,\u201d he said of developers eying opportunities the last few years. \u201cSpeaking to the same groups, you\u2019ll read three months later that the site closed.\u201d\nThe paucity of sales launches also is good news for projects with significant inventory still to move, like One Wall Street or The Greenwich, two condos in the Financial District with hundreds of units still to sell. In the last 12 months, The Greenwich has been the third-fastest selling building in the city, according to Marketproof.\nStill, the volcanic winter of 536 lasted for 18 months, and had ripple effects for years after. Mack similarly doesn\u2019t see a quick fix on the horizon.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take at least five years to turn that picture around,\u201d she said.",

        "content": "Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 announcement Sunday that he will stop running for re-election closes the book on a fruitful and frustrating four years for real estate.\nHis decision, revealed in a video posted on X, might seem like a final gift to the industry, but it figures to only slightly improve Andrew Cuomo\u2019s chances to defeat Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani in the November election.\nAdams was drawing support from only 7 percent or 8 percent of voters in\nrecent polls\n. Even if most of those voters migrate to Cuomo, some will shift to Mamdani or Republican Curtis Sliwa, and some will simply not vote. Some might even vote for Adams, whose name may still appear on the ballot.\nAs a result, Cuomo, who trails Mamdani by 18 to 20 points in the most recent polls, figures to pick up just 3 or 4 points from Adams\u2019 withdrawal.\nThe lost promise of Adams\u2019 mayoralty could haunt the real estate industry for years, especially if Mamdani wins and lives up to his\ncampaign platform of freezing rents\nand\nopposing profit-making by developers\n.\nAdams\u2019 re-election campaign was fatally wounded by his\nSeptember 2023 corruption indictment\nand his\ndalliance with President Donald Trump\nin a successful effort to get the charges dropped.\nBut his popularity had already plummeted, thanks to\nscandals involving his confidantes\n, which\ncontinued even after\nthe Department of Justice abandoned the case against Adams in exchange for his cooperation on immigration enforcement.\nSome of Adams\u2019 accomplishments, however, will benefit the real estate industry for decades to come. No mayor in modern history has done more to increase the potential for more housing in the city.\nAdams\u2019 City of Yes for Housing Opportunity\n, which passed a year ago, will spur the addition of an estimated 82,000 more homes over 15 years. How much credit the mayor deserves for it, however, is a complicated question.\nThe bulk of the work on City of Yes was done by\nhis Department of City Planning and its director Dan Garodnick\n, a former City Council member who touted the reform to New Yorkers and Council members when the mayor was too unpopular and distracted to do either.\nCouncil Speaker Adrienne Adams, although she\nhas clashed repeatedly with the mayor\n, played a crucial role in tweaking City of Yes to ensure at least 26 members would vote for the proposal, which passed 31 to 20. A more popular mayor might have been able to get it through without the concessions that shaved about 27,000 homes off the projected gain.\nBut had the mayor not endorsed the plan and given Garodnick rein to make it happen, it wouldn\u2019t have. City of Yes modernized zoning and other regulations that had long ceased to make sense, if they ever did, yet were kept in place by Mayors Bill de Blasio, Mike Bloomberg, Rudy Giuliani and Ed Koch, all of whom considered themselves reformers.\nThe changes allowed for a little more housing in every neighborhood. One key reform was\neliminating parking requirements\nfor new developments in much of the city; the original proposal would have done so citywide.\nAdams got off to a slow start on rezoning neighborhoods for more housing, but his\nunderstaffed planning department got the ball rolling\nin his third year. By the time he leaves office, Adams will have presided over\nupzonings of Midtown South\n,\nLong Island City\n, Jamaica, the former Flushing Airport,\nAtlantic Avenue\nfrom Prospect Heights to Crown Heights, and\nsections of the Bronx\nwhere four Metro-North stations are planned.\nThe mayor also did more than his predecessors in pushing for city office buildings to be\nconverted into housing\n, although much of that effort came late in his tenure, leaving delivery of those promises to his successor.\nThe Adams administration lobbied Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state legislature for a change that housing advocates have\nsought for years\n: an increase in the city\u2019s maximum floor-area ratio, which had been stuck at 12 for ages. With a\npush\nfrom the governor, the state\nfinally did so\nin the spring of 2024, allowing for a\nmore robust\nMidtown South rezoning, with FAR being raised to 15 on some blocks and 18 on others.\n\nAs a result, the rezoning could yield 10,000 new homes.\nUnder Adams, the New York City Housing Authority has accelerated the de Blasio administration\u2019s\nPACT program\n, which enlists private real estate firms to renovate and manage NYCHA campuses. The program, conceived by former HUD secretary Shaun Donovan in 2011, has made improvements to public housing that long seemed impossible.\nAs part of that effort, NYCHA is moving ahead with the Related Companies on a\ndemolish-and-rebuild\nproject for the Fulton Houses, despite opposition from some Chelsea residents that had caused the de Blasio administration to back off.\nThe Rent Guidelines Board, which over time came to be controlled by Adams appointees, abandoned the rent freezes of the de Blasio years and passed increases for rent-stabilized properties that at least\napproached the rate of inflation\n.\nLandlords appreciated Adams\u2019 refusal to make them scapegoats for the city\u2019s high housing costs, and his repeated explanations that rent has to keep pace with expenses.\nOn the other hand, Adams made little effort to advocate in Albany for rent-stabilized buildings, which have lost billions of dollars in value since the state\u2019s rent law reform of 2019.\nIn recent months, Adams has been promoting himself as the most pro-housing mayor ever, based on changes championed by his administration. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build more housing in one term than [in] the 12 years under Bloomberg [and] the eight years under de Blasio combined,\u201d he said.\nThat\nwasn\u2019t accurate\n. What he meant was his rezonings and the City of Yes created the potential for 130,000 new homes, more than his two predecessors\u2019 rezonings did. The actual creation of those homes, if they happen, will be after Adams leaves office, either at year\u2019s end or sooner if he resigns to accept a new job.\nBut mayors do not, for the most part, create much housing. Their responsibility is to create the conditions that allow the private sector to build. On that standard, Adams can stake a claim as the most pro-housing mayor, even if fair comparisons are impossible because the city\u2019s challenges and circumstances change dramatically from one mayor to the next.\nKoch\u2019s great accomplishment was restoring New Yorkers\u2019 optimism about the city, and reclaiming thousands of buildings abandoned during the city\u2019s years of crisis. Giuliani presided over an unprecedented decline in crime, which raised real estate values more than any housing policy could.\nBloomberg\u2019s 12 years \u2014 despite starting with a recession and being interrupted by the Great Financial Crisis \u2014 were marked by record job increases, which rewarded landlords with higher rents than had ever been imagined. And de Blasio\u2019s policies embraced market-rate development as necessary to alleviate the housing crisis, although he rarely acknowledged that, lest he be cast as catering to real estate.\nAdams was more vocal about housing than any of them. He often derided the persistent not-in-my-back-yard opposition to housing from local communities and their representatives, and never sought to score political points by demonizing the real estate industry.\nBut in the end, that promise was cut short by his own mistakes and misdeeds. While he did bring in respected deputy mayors, including Maria Torres-Springer, who was in charge of housing, Adams also hired cronies from his time in the NYPD, Brooklyn Borough Hall and the state Senate, and let them engage in all kinds of self-dealing.\nThey seemed to take their cue from the mayor himself, judging from the 57-page indictment released by federal prosecutors, which showed Adams approving straw-donor deals and quid pro quo exchanges for first-class travel to Turkey. Adams denied everything, but New Yorkers didn\u2019t believe him, and he never recovered.\nThe upshot was a mayoralty that began with great optimism for real estate interest, then fell apart in a cloud of scandal, but ultimately did a lot of good things for the industry and for New Yorkers who need housing.\nMost of that housing will be realized in the years to come, although given the way his mayoralty ended, it is unclear if Adams will be remembered for it.\n",

        "content": "After years of plunging prices and a flight to the outskirts, Chicago\u2019s downtown condo market may be poised for a revival.\nThe downtown condo market has languished over the last few years. Luxury penthouse owners have\nslashed prices by millions to find buyers\n, and many condos have traded for far less than what they sold for years ago, with some even dropping to\nvalues from the 1990s or earlier\n.\nThe slump in sales has been brought on by a\ncombination of factors\n: Work-from-home norms during the pandemic meant wealthy city workers could move out to the suburbs or North Side neighborhoods, where demand has skyrocketed. Concerns about crime downtown kept out-of-town buyers out of the market, and Chicago was seen as less desirable in general.\nBut brokers who work in the downtown luxury condo market say buyers are showing more interest in downtown condos and the sector may be on the way to a recovery.\n\u201cI feel like the market\u2019s pretty much since the pandemic hit its rock bottom,\u201d said Rafael Murillo, a broker with Compass who sells luxury condos downtown. \u201cAnd each year you\u2019re seeing little improvements.\u201d\nAs other markets continue to climb, buyers are taking the opportunity to get downtown at a discount, Chezi Rafaeli, a Coldwell Banker broker who specializes in Chicago luxury condos, said.\n\u201cA lot of people are trying to secure properties, especially downtown, where the market is really interesting,\u201d Rafaeli said. \u201cPricing is really attractive to a lot of buyers.\u201d\nWhen Rafaeli spoke with\nThe Real Deal\non Sept. 25, he said he had 17 showings that day, where he would usually have fewer than 10 showings a day in the past. A lot of the activity he\u2019s seeing is in the $500,000 to $3 million price range, he said.\nBuyers are starting to see downtown Chicago as a desirable place to live as safety concerns are starting to ease and people find value in the perks of living downtown, brokers said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a nice little resurgence in how people are feeling about Chicago,\u201d said Carrie McCormick, an @properties agent who works in the luxury market. \u201cWe are a world-class city and I think that there\u2019s a shift in people\u2019s thought process.\u201d\n\nWhile competition is starting to tick up, buyers are still being choosy. They want high-quality units, McCormick said, describing the buyer sentiment as a \u201cflight to quality.\u201d\nInterest is especially high in newer buildings like the St. Regis and One Chicago, as well as newly-converted buildings like the Tribune Tower, brokers said.\nThose buildings aren\u2019t selling for the prices the developers asked for and expected in 2022, though, and many recently sold condos still took price cuts from their initial asking price. Murillo said units will move quickly if they\u2019re priced to reflect the new market realities, but if sellers expect more they\u2019ll have a hard time finding buyers.\nThe St. Regis skyscraper, at 363 East Wacker Drive, has been the site of some high-dollar deals this year, showing signs of improvement from a financial struggle for its developers since new ownership took over the property\u2019s unsold units. The 79th-floor penthouse sold for\n$7.5 million in August\n, likely the second-most expensive sale this year at the building based on property records.\nThe unit was part of a bulk investment in unsold condos in the building made in 2024 by an offshoot of Grupo Denim, a Mexican clothing company. At least five condos from that bulk purchase have sold for more than $5 million this year, based on property records. An 82nd-floor penthouse that was listed on the residence\u2019s website in May at $10.5 million is no longer listed for sale, but, so far, there has been no sale of that condo documented in Cook County property records.\nWhile the recovery may not have amplified yet, brokers said they think downtown condo prices are going to start trending upward in the next year. Inventory surplus that has long plagued the sector is easing as buyers are snatching up what\u2019s available and create more competition for desirable properties.\nThe median days on the market for downtown condos has fallen every month this year, according to year-over-year Redfin data.\n\u201cWhen someone\u2019s looking for a high-end property, we just don\u2019t have that many here on the market,\u201d McCormick said. \u201cSo once one does come on and there\u2019s a buying opportunity, people are just taking advantage of it.\u201d\nAside from a few new buildings like One Chicago and the St. Regis, there aren\u2019t many new high-end condos coming online in the near future, Rafaeli said. As availability in those buildings dries up, he said he expects prices to trend upward for lower priced luxury condos, especially if mortgage rates continue to come down.\n\u201cAnything that is in the luxury sector, which typically runs between $500 to $750 a square foot, we will see prices rising,\u201d Rafaeli said. \u201cBecause we don\u2019t have any new inventory coming on the market.\u201d",

The buyer wasn\u2019t identified.\n\nThe property is anchored by Texas Capital Bank, which occupies 44 percent of the property. The bank has 15 more years on its lease.

        "content": "Blackstone and Starwood Capital Group are heading back to Wall Street to refinance a sprawling portfolio of budget hotels.\nThe investment giants\u2019 joint venture, ESH Hospitality, is preparing a $1.94 billion CMBS offering secured by debt on 220 Extended Stay America hotels in 33 states, according to a KBRA loan analysis. The portfolio totals 24,560 keys, representing a large portion of the brand\u2019s U.S. footprint, Bisnow\nreported\n.\nJPMorgan Chase and Citi are expected to originate half the debt; Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and a Deutsche Bank affiliate would split the rest. The notes are likely to close before the end of November, KBRA reported.\nThe securitization is underwritten at a 65.4 percent loan-to-value ratio and an 8.27 percent cap rate. The Class A bonds are rated AAA. The two-year, interest-only loan comes with three one-year extension options and is priced at an estimated 250 basis points above the secured overnight financing rate and an expected 0 percent floor.\nBlackstone and Starwood must also secure an interest rate cap at no higher than 7 percent to guard against further volatility.\n\nHalf the portfolio\u2019s square footage is concentrated in Florida, California, New Jersey, Maryland and Massachusetts. Properties average 25 years in age, featuring room counts ranging from 68 to 161. Occupancy in the trailing 12 months was 77 percent, generating a revenue per available room of $60.13. Performance has seesawed in recent years due to pandemic-related disruptions.\nBlackstone and Starwood acquired Extended Stay America for\nabout $6 billion\nin 2021. The private-equity firms paid $19.50 per share for the hotel operator, following previous investments in the hotel chain by each company.\nThe offering comes as the hospitality market continues its split recovery. Luxury hotels are setting record room rates thanks to high-end leisure demand, but extended stay, midscale and economy operators have been slower to rebound as cost-conscious travelers resist spending.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "With just three months left in his tenure, Mayor Eric Adams is squeezing as much housing as possible into his remaining time.\nA day after\nending his re-election bid\n, the mayor announced he is shifting $1.8 billion from future capital budgets to this fiscal year for affordable housing projects.\nThe official rationale is not to burnish his housing legacy, but to take advantage of a new federal law that makes more projects eligible for low-income housing tax credits.\nPreviously, projects that use LIHTC had to be at least 50 percent funded by them, a threshold many could not reach. This summer, Congress\nreduced the minimum\nto 25 percent. But to take advantage of those credits, affordable housing developers still typically need public money to pencil out.\nThat is where the city\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development and Housing Development Corporation come in. Of the $1.8 billion being advanced from future years, $1.5 billion will go for this purpose.\nThe other $300 million is for the New York City Housing Authority\u2019s\nPACT program\n, which taps private developers to renovate and manage public housing campuses. That program, based on one called Rental Assistance Demonstration, has been accelerated by Adams after promising results during the de Blasio administration.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just talking about solving the city\u2019s housing crisis; we\u2019re putting our money where our mouth is to build more housing more quickly,\u201d Adams said in a statement.\nThe congressional bill did not allocate more federal funding, but it allows the city to use its resources more efficiently.\nFront-loading the $1.8 billion will shrink, for the moment, the future budgets from which it comes, but the city clearly needs as much affordable housing as it can get, as soon as it can get it. The HPD-funded projects are built by for-profit and nonprofit developers, who often form joint ventures for individual developments.\nSuch projects must often wait several years for HPD funding, which is allocated based on project readiness and whether they meet the agency\u2019s policy goals. HPD\u2019s capacity is also an issue, but it added staff this summer to handle more applications.\nTo get a piece of the newly available $1.5 billion, \u201cprojects must have been pretty far along in the process,\u201d a senior housing official told\nThe Real Deal\n. HPD has a robust pipeline of projects, the official added.\n",

The project includes the 44-story, 362-unit Lofty Brickell tower and the 46-story, 422-unit Standard Residences tower. They\u2019ll share a podium.\nA spokesperson declined to identify the senior lender.\nMiami-based Newgard has financed construction of the two-tower project so far with a\n$170 million\nconstruction loan from Miami-based 3650 REIT, a subsidiary of 3650 Capital, which it provided in 2022. Construction of the project is more than halfway through, and the buildings, which share a podium, are expected to be completed in 2027, according to the release.\nThe latest $513 million construction financing is one of the largest loans to close this year in South Florida. Other large construction loans include the\n$600 million financing\nBank OZK and mezzanine lender TZ Capital provided in June to Steve Ross\u2019 Related Ross for the planned South Flagler House condo project in West Palm Beach.\nMiami and West Palm Beach-based Two Roads joined Harvey Hernandez\u2019s Newgard as a\njoint venture partner\non the One Brickell Riverfront project last November. Earlier this year, they\nsigned a contract\nto sell a portion of the development site, where a third tower is planned, to Miami Beach-based Prosper, a development firm led by Jay Roberts, and an undisclosed partner.\n\nMiami-based Arquitectonica is designing One Brickell Riverfront. Lofty will include condos ranging from studios to two-bedroom units, and 40,000 square feet of amenities that will include a marina, pool deck, fitness center, spa, cigar lounge and co-working spaces. Remaining penthouses range in asking price from $2.4 million to $3.5 million. Owners will be able to rent their units out on a short-term basis. Cervera Real Estate is handling sales.\nAvra Estiatorio, a New York City-based Greek restaurant, will open on the ground floor of Lofty, according to the release.\nThe Standard Residences building will also have studios, one- and two-bedroom condos with prices for remaining units starting in the mid-$600,000s. Amenities at the Standard tower will include a club lounge and cafe; co-working spaces; a 10th-floor spa with a Hammam, saunas and cold plunge; a fitness center; bowling alley; a restaurant on the ninth floor and a riverfront restaurant at street level. The developers tapped One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty to handle sales.\nOther major projects under construction in the neighborhood include Related Group and GTIS Partners\u2019 Baccarat Residences, and Mast Capital\u2019s Cipriani Residences. Mast secured a\n$600 million construction loan\nfor the tower last year.\nThe One Brickell Riverfront project isn\u2019t the only Two Roads development to recently secure a large loan. In September, Two Roads nabbed\n$520 million in construction financing\nfor a waterfront luxury hotel and condo tower in downtown Tampa, which includes C-PACE financing.\nThe development firm\u2019s projects in South Florida include the planned Edition Residences in Miami\u2019s Edgewater, which has been on hold for years due to litigation surrounding Two Roads\u2019 buyout of the existing condo building on the waterfront site. This summer, an appeals court again ruled in favor of a group of eight holdout owners who have been fighting the buyout.\n",

It halts the acceptance or approval of applications for data centers or warehouses, as well as expansions of existing facilities. Exceptions include projects already filed, routine repairs and emergency government facilities. Developers with time-sensitive projects can apply for conditional processing but will need to comply with any future code changes.\nMayor John Laesch stressed that the city isn\u2019t anti\u2013data center but needs guardrails to address community concerns. Residents near CyrusOne\u2019s facility on\nAurora\u2019s East Side\n, at 2905 Diehl Road, have complained of \u201cunlivable\u201d noise from backup generators, while officials also flagged environmental risks tied to water consumption, diesel emissions and greenhouse gases. Laesch said he has fielded calls from labor groups and potential operators, assuring them that the goal is balance, not banishment.\nAurora currently has five\ndata center projects\nseeking approval, Chief Development Services Officer John Curley said. Staff will present an update in 90 days and aim to deliver draft code changes before the six-month window closes.\n\nThe lone \u201cno\u201d vote, Alderman Carl Franco, argued the council lacked information to justify the sweeping pause and warned against discouraging investment. Proponents countered that Aurora\u2019s code lumps data centers in with warehouses, leaving the city without standards to mitigate impacts on surrounding neighborhoods.\nThe moratorium follows months of tension over\nCyrusOne\n\u2019s site, where residents pressed the company and the city for relief from noise pollution. While temporary fixes have helped, residents remain wary of long-term impacts. Environmental advocates, including local Sierra Club chair Mavis Bates, applauded the move, calling it a chance for Aurora to set the bar for \u201csustainable data center hosting.\u201d\nAurora isn\u2019t alone in rethinking its approach.\nMunicipalities\nacross the country are grappling with how to regulate data centers and logistics hubs that promise tax revenue but come with noise, traffic and heavy utility demands.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Moishe Mana loaded more properties into his Wynwood portfolio in Miami with a $25.5 million development site acquisition.\nMana\n, who is arguably the largest landowner in\nWynwood\nand\ndowntown Miami\n, acquired a 0.7-acre assemblage at 2200-2230 Northwest Second Avenue and 224 Northwest 22nd Terrace, the buyer and the seller confirmed to\nThe Real Deal\n. The site is approved for a five-story mixed-use development that could be either offices or residential with ground-floor retail. If Mana were to capitalize on Florida\u2019s Live Local Act, he could potentially develop a 450-foot-tall mixed-use skyscraper with 789 apartments, an offering shows.\nBut he would not build a residential project on the site, Mana told\nTRD\n. \u201cThis is not a site for residential,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see it as a business center, and the properties are generating income. It is very much in line with our other properties in Wynwood.\u201d\nThe assemblage, consisting of two retail buildings and a parking lot, is surrounded by other Mana-owned parcels.\nAri Dispenza with Miami-based Central Commercial Real Estate represented the seller, an affiliate of New York-based\nAbingdon Square Partners\n, led by Benjamin Atkins. Abingdon paid $5.1 million in 2013 for the property, records show. The assemblage was listed last year with an asking price of\n$31 million\n, but Abingdon took it off the market, Atkins told\nTRD\n.\n\n\u201cMoise owns all the properties around this assemblage,\u201d Atkins said. \u201cWhen it got more serious, he and I were able to reach an off-market agreement. He has very exciting plans.\u201d\nIn Wynwood, the height of buildings is capped at five to eight stories, but developers can go as high as 12 stories in some areas of the neighborhood by offering public benefits. The assemblage purchased by Mana is capped at 70 units and five stories, but the developer could win an extra three stories and 55 more units by providing public benefits, last year\u2019s offering states.\nThe memo also noted that a buyer could take advantage of the\nLive Local Act\n, which allows developers to build new mixed-use or residential projects that can be as tall as buildings within one mile. In exchange, developers must set aside at least 40 percent of units for households earning no more than 120 percent of the area median income for at least 30 years.\nAmong the developers planning Live Local Act projects in Wynwood include Brooklyn-based\nLivWrk\n. The firm is seeking city of Miami approval for three 45-story towers with 1,363 apartments, 23,200 square feet of retail and 912 parking spaces on the northwest corner of North Miami Avenue and Northwest 24th Street.\nIn July, Mana landed a\n$150 million\nrefinancing for 56 properties in Wynwood that surround his Mana Wynwood Convention Center at 318 Northwest 23rd Street in Miami. The venue was not part of the refinancing.\nMost of the parcels are along 21st, 22nd and 23rd streets, both east and west of Fifth Avenue, where Mana is planning\nMana Wynwood\n, a 30-acre mixed-use development that was approved in 2016, but that project has not broken ground.",

The\nGensler\n-designed development will cost $150 million to build and will be the first facility solely dedicated to the Sparks.\nSparks players will have access to two WNBA regulation-size courts, modern weight and training rooms, hydrotherapy and spa suites, an outdoor pool, wellness spaces and dedicated nap rooms. When it opens in 2027, the facility will also be home to the Sparks\u2019 business headquarters.\nThe Sparks are the latest professional sports teams to plant a flag in\nEl Segundo\n.

Chargers built The Bolt, a 145,000-square-foot training facility in El Segundo, less than 2 miles from the Sparks\u2019 future home. Prior to the announcement of the Sparks\u2019 move, the team was just one of three WNBA squads without a practice facility either built or in development.\n\nWith the Sparks\u2019 move to El Segundo, the enclave near Los Angeles International Airport will be the only city in the United States to host five professional teams, per CO.\nInglewood, a few miles to the northeast of El Segundo, has similarly seen a sports makeover in recent years.\nStan Kroenke\n\u2019s $5.5 billion SoFi Stadium \u2014 the most expensive in the world \u2014 opened in 2020, while the $2 billion Intuit Dome opened just south of the SoFi site last August.

        "content": "Chicago real estate power players Curt Bailey, Bob Clark and\nMarc Zahr\ncompleted a $58 million real estate trade that could be the start of a consequential chapter for the South Side\u2019s economy.\nThe Zahr-led real estate division of\nBlue Owl Capital\nbought pieces of the South Side\u2019s sprawling former U.S. Steel site for about $29 million and subsequently sold it for about $58 million to\nRelated Midwest\n(led by Bailey) and CRG, the development arm of Clark\u2019s construction conglomerate Clayco, according to public records. Blue Owl appears to have issued a 99-year ground lease to the development firms to constitute the $58 million transaction, with the deal finalized earlier this month, public records show.\nRelated also directly purchased a little more than $3 million worth of land on the site from U.S. Steel, records show. The exact details of the ground lease between Blue Owl and the development team, and how the release of funds for the transaction was structured, is unclear.\nWith control of the real estate, the developers are tasked with building a multi-billion dollar quantum computing and microelectronics facility in coordination with the massive parcel\u2019s ultimate tenants PsiQuantum and the University of Illinois. So far, it\u2019s unclear whether the developers have acquired the entire site, or if the $58 million represents only the initial batch of acreage set for redevelopment.\nLeaders of Related Midwest, CRG and their representatives didn\u2019t immediately return requests for comment.\nThe transaction comes on the heels of Silicon Valley-based PsiQuantum \u2014 which aims to create the world\u2019s first \u201cuseful\u201d quantum computer \u2014 raising $1 billion earlier this month to help launch its plans for facilities in Australia and Chicago. The funding round, led by funds and accounts managed by affiliates of BlackRock, valued PsiQuantum at $7 billion.\n\nPsiQuantum will be the anchor of the Chicago facility, to which it has committed $1 billion. Construction is slated to start this year, and the facility is expected to be operational by 2028.\nAt least 128 acres of the 440-acre former South Works steel site are slated to be transformed, with the first phase of the quantum project set to erect a 458,000-square-foot facility as part of the larger research campus, into which the state is also pouring funds. Federal funding of $140 million from the U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency will also support the establishment of a quantum-testing facility on the campus.\nPrevious redevelopment efforts for the former industrial site have included similarly grand ambitions, with a project in the late 2010s envisioning up to 20,000 homes. But they fizzled out in part due to the fundamental challenges tied to the site\u2019s scale, soil contamination and broader economics.\nRelated Midwest and CRG secured rezoning approvals for the entire 440-acre site late last year. While the so-called Illinois Quantum &amp; Microelectronics Park will take up about a quarter of the area, the developers are allowed to build up to 59.3 million square feet of buildings across the campus, far\nexceeding the combined size\nof other planned downtown megadevelopments such as the new Lincoln Yards plan dubbed Foundry Park, Bronzeville Lakefront and The 78, the latter being another project that Related Midwest is pursuing.\nCheck back for updates on this developing story.\n",

The Downtown Dallas Development Authority and the Downtown Connection Tax Increment Financing District are slated to review the deal this week.\nThe agreement would dedicate future increases in property tax revenue to help fund redevelopment of the 72-story tower and four adjacent blocks. Staff recommended approval, setting the stage for City Council consideration.\nHoque and Ablon, through an entity called\n901 Main PAHG Partners\n, struck a deal last year to buy the 1.9 million-square-foot tower from Chicago-based Metropolis Holdings. The price wasn\u2019t disclosed. The Dallas Central Appraisal District valued the 1.85 million-square-foot tower at $130 million, or $70 per square foot. The purchase was expected to close mid-2025 but is now expected later this year. Metropolis bought the building in 1998 for about $300 million, or $162 per square foot.\nIn 2023 the building also lost its namesake tenant, when\nBank of America\ndownsized to 238,000 square feet in KDC\u2019s in-development Parkside Uptown, leaving a 500,000-square-foot hole.\nAblon and\nHoque\n\u2019s plan envisions a 300-key luxury hotel inside the tower, plus streetscape upgrades designed to turn the fortress-like superblock into a more walkable downtown anchor.\n\nBank of America Plaza, famous for its colorful LED outline, has long been a Dallas icon but hasn\u2019t had major reinvestment in decades. The proposed remodel could reposition the tower and reshape its surrounding blocks, dovetailing broader efforts to bring more residential and pedestrian activity downtown.\nHoque\nhas been at the helm of major public/private redevelopment ventures, including a planned 270-acre mixed-use project in\nUniversity Hills\nin far southeast Dallas that received a subsidy deal from the city, although his firm has missed deadlines in the past.\nSimilar TIF incentives have helped fund office-to-resi conversions and infrastructure upgrades along Main and\nElm streets\n.\nMeanwhile, Fort Worth is weighing its own incentive package. The City Council there will vote Sept. 30 on whether to offer up to $6 million in grants to Alcon Research, the global eye care giant founded in the city, as it considers relocating two European manufacturing lines to North Texas. The move would represent a $186 million investment and 241 new jobs.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

New Manhattan hotel developments have slowed to a crawl since the city enacted a 2021 law requiring special permits for ground-up hospitality development, a measure backed by the Hotel Trades Council despite real estate industry warnings that it would choke supply.\n\nWith financing still tight, operators wary of overbuilding in a market still stabilizing from the pandemic and an increasingly burdensome process at hand, filings for hotel projects have been exceedingly rare.\nAs of November, there were only three hotel special permit applications filed in the previous 12 months, according to a Cushman &amp; Wakefield\nreport\n. Those three developments accounted for 656 rooms, according to the Department of City Planning\u2019s data portal.\nThat scarcity makes the scale of Artifact\u2019s proposal notable. Though a small hotel by scale, the project would be among the few entrants in a city that has seen almost\nno fresh hotel inventory permitted\nin recent years.\nArtifact is best known for Harlem residential projects like the Harlem Collective coworking hub and a 421a-backed rental at 2335 12th Avenue.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The total was up from 21 in the\nprevious period\n.\nUnit 38 initially sought roughly $23 million\nwhen sales at the supertall launched\nnine years ago, before a brief suspension. The 4,500-square-foot condo has three bedrooms and three bathrooms, along with 14-foot ceilings with views of Central Park.\nAmenities at the 60-unit building, developed by JDS Development and Property Markets Group, include a fitness center, lap pool, private dining room and terrace.\nThe tower is 90 percent sold, with the sale price of the closed units averaging roughly $4,500 per square foot. Eleven units at the building have snagged the No. 1 or No. 2 spot\nin weekly contract reports\nso far this year.\nThe Nikki Field Team with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty had the listing.\n\nThe second most expensive home to find a buyer was a penthouse at 33 Park Row, asking $19.5 million \u2014 the\npriciest contract\ninked in the Financial District in four years. The duplex spans 5,400 square feet and has five bedrooms and five bathrooms.\nIf Unit PH3 closes for that price, it will tie with the neighborhood\u2019s most expensive deal, a penthouse at the adjacent building, 25 Park Row, which closed for $19.5 million in 2021.\nSince sales launched four years ago, 24 of the building\u2019s 33 units have closed for an average of $2,300 per square foot.

        "content": "A purportedly haunted hotel in San Francisco sold at auction just in time for Halloween season.\nThe former Hotel Union Square at 100-120 Powell Street sold its $102 million in debt for about $30 million, the San Francisco Standard\nreported\n. The buyer was Hotel Union Square LLC, an entity linked to commercial real estate investor Mahmood Alam, known for\nhigh-profile gas station projects\nin Mendocino County.\nThe 131-room property opened in 1908 as the Golden West Hotel and is located on a once-thriving stretch of Powell Street now plagued by retail vacancies. It was previously managed by private equity firm\nRockpoint Group and hospitality group Highgate Hotels\nand was converted to temporary residences for the homeless from mid-2020 to late 2021.\nThe hotel never reopened after that. The owners received a flat daily payment from the city as well as a $5.3 million payout for water and smoke damage during that shelter-in-place period. Rockpoint\ndefaulted on its mortgage in 2023\n, and a Swatch store in the building\u2019s ground floor closed this year.\n\nDuring its time as the Golden West Hotel in the Prohibition era, the property had a speakeasy called the Golden Bubble tucked away in its basement. \u201cThe Maltese Falcon\u201d author Dashiell Hammett was among the regulars at the bar; it was at the hotel where he had an affair with playwright Lillian Hellman. Hammett and Hellman frequently stayed in Room 207, and her spirit allegedly still haunts the room, with guests claiming to hear strange sounds, feel drops in temperature, and see a woman pacing in front of them.\nHotels in San Francisco and the Bay Area have been\nnavigating troubled waters\nsince the pandemic, with several properties falling into loan default, foreclosure or closing their doors entirely, as was the case with the Hotel Union Square.\nHotel Union Square was one of many San Francisco hotels that were used as temporary shelter during the pandemic, and just one of two that never reopened afterward. Hotel Whitcomb at 1231 Market Street also never recovered; its owners were paid $89 million for a 33-month contract and subsequently received $32 million for damages and lost revenue.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The company is facing the foreclosure of 66 buildings, referred to in city documents as the \u201cVeritas SF Portfolio.\u201d\nIn total, the 66 buildings house 1,566 residential units, according to Mission Local. The structures range in size from a 116-unit, five-story apartment complex at 57 Taylor Street in the Tenderloin to six-unit buildings in North Beach and Corona Heights. The Tenderloin property was the center of a 2018 lawsuit from tenants over alleged lead contamination. Most of the properties are in the Tenderloin, Civic Center and downtown.\nBecause the loan is secured by the buildings, all 66 could be sold within 90 days to pay off the debt, according to Mission Local.\nFirst American Title Insurance Company sent the notice of default to 66 properties owned by various subsidiaries of Veritas, per Mission Local. It gives Veritas until five days before a sale date to pay off its debt to its lender, Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s real estate investment arm RBC Real Estate Capital Corporation. Veritas reportedly has the option to work out a payment plan or ask for extra time, though if it foregoes either of those options, the lender reserves the right to set a sale date no sooner than 90 days from the Sept. 18 filing date, or Dec. 17.\nThose 66 buildings house 1,566 units, according to a review of records with the San Francisco Office of the Assessor-Recorder. Because Veritas\u2019 loan is secured by the buildings, all 66 could be sold at foreclosure within 90 days to pay off the debt, according to the notice.\n\nThe Veritas loan has an unpaid principal balance of $551 million which first came due last March, per Mission Local.

        "content": "A lender aims to foreclose on Grant King\u2019s Dream Hollywood hotel.\nA UCC foreclosure auction is scheduled for mid-October, according to a notice reviewed by The Real Deal. The LCP Group is seeking to foreclose on the equity interests in the 178-key hotel, which the lender alleges has over $30 million in unpaid debt.\nThe 10-story hotel at 6417 Selma Avenue is owned by a company connected to the embattled King-helmed Relevant Group. King told TRD that Relevant is working on a loan recapitalization and extension with the lender.\nRelevant raised hundreds of millions for the hotel, as TRD\nreported\nin March 2023, with some coming via the EB-5 program. It received a $33.3 million loan a month later from LCP.\nRelevant lost 6417 Selma Avenue before, but bought it back after King\u2019s personal bankruptcy in 2013. The hotel was completed in 2017.\n\nThe company then developed two other hotels: the 212-key Tommie and 190-key Thompson Hollywood hotels, both in 2021. The two are under different names and brands now, after lenders Machine Investment Group and Tachonic Capital acquired the properties at 6516 West Selma Avenue and 1541 Wilcox Avenue through\nforeclosure\nin 2023. Recent records revealed the lenders acquired the properties through credit bids; the mezzanine lenders provided a $72 million loan for the two hotels.\nIn June, the Los Angeles City Council\nrescinded\nits approval of another hotel proposed by\u00a0 Relevant, this one an eight-story, 114-room hotel at 6221 Selma Avenue in Hollywood, after a court ruled it would adversely impact air quality in the area.\nThe equity interest in the Dream Hollywood hotel will be put for sale along with the Tao Restaurant; they will be offered individually and then as a bulk sale.\nMatthew Mannion of Mannion Auctions is the auctioneer. The lender declined to comment.\n",

The shell space sold for $5.25 million, or $1,009 per square foot, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. A buildout at a \u201clow-ball\u201d estimate of $200 would cost over $1 million.\nJulie Busby of Compass represented the buyers, who she declined to identify. Tim Sheahan and Mark Icuss, the Compass agents who represented all 58 condos in the building, said all units have sold or are under contract. Forty-eight of the units sold for between $2 million and $3.6 million, they said.\nThe latest trade came at a high price point for the\nWest Loop\n. A\npenthouse\non the 15th floor of the tower sold in 2023 for $7 million. In 2022, a penthouse sold for $5.6 million at 900 West Washington Boulevard, and another sold for $5.72 million in 2019 in the same building.\nSulo Development\nstarted construction\non the tower in 2021, and the first condos were delivered in 2023. Pre-sale listings of 36 units started at $2 million, making them the neighborhood\u2019s most-expensive homes.\n\nSulo also built the Hayden, an eight-story, 28-unit condo building at 1109 West Washington Boulevard. Bucking the apartment-building trend in Fulton Market,\nSulo\nalso proposed a three-building, 243-condo project last year at 1325 West Fulton Street.\nSulo acquired that property from Sterling Bay, which had purchased the vacant lot in 2017 with the intention of building offices.\nIt\u2019s been a few years of rough sailing for the luxury condo market in downtown Chicago, and many developers have shifted to\nbuilding apartments\ninstead of for-sale products. However, GD Holdings bought Magellan\u2019s unsold St. Regis condos at 363 East Wacker Drive last year and has been offloading them at a good clip.

        "content": "Vanbarton Group locked in a large loan from Brookfield to close a Midtown office deal, marking the developer\u2019s latest office-to-residential play.\nBrookfield provided a $300 million loan to finance Vanbarton\u2019s\n$135 million purchase of 6 East 43rd Street\nfrom the Milstein family\u2019s Emigrant Savings Bank. The loan will also be used for Vanbarton\u2019s conversion of the 400,000-square-foot building to 441 rental apartments, including 111 affordable units.\nVanbarton will take advantage of a tax break ushered in by Gov. Kathy Hochul,\nknown as 467m\n. Developers who set aside 25 percent of a conversion\u2019s units as affordable to those making 80 percent of the area median income can nab a\n90 percent off\ncoupon on property taxes under the abatement.\nThe conversion of the 1968 building is possible thanks to last year\u2019s\nCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity\n. Before the City Council approved Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 signature housing policy, buildings constructed after 1961, apart from those in Lower Manhattan, were ineligible for conversion. Now, anything that went up before 1991 is fair game.\n\nSkyline Properties\u2019 Robert Khodadadian, Daniel Shirazi and Daniel Davidov represented Vanbarton in the deal. Eastdil Secured represented the Milstein family.\nVanbarton, led by Gary Tischler and Richard Coles, has been doing conversions for more than two decades, and its appetite shows no signs of slowing. It\u2019s the third office building Vanbarton\u2019s bought in the past year as bargains in the office market and demand for new apartments have led to a boom in conversion opportunities.\nThe developer is paying roughly $100 million to buy the home of the Archdiocese of New York at\n1011 First Avenue\n, which it plans to transform into 420 apartments. And in December, it bought 77 Water Street in the Financial District for\n$95 million\n, which will turn into 600 units.\n",

Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Long Beach, Calif., was once known as \u201cIowa by the sea,\u201d because of the migration of Midwesterners to the seaside city, as part of a broader influx that brought 2 million people to Los Angeles County between 1920 and 1930,\naccording to PBS SoCal\n.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Nearly 50,000 commuters are about to save one minute on their daily subway trips thanks to a planned route switch. Starting Dec. 8, F and M trains will switch East River tunnels between Manhattan and Queens,\nGothamist reports\n. The current setup causes between 15 and 20 percent of all rush-hour trains on the E, M and R routes to be delayed at Queens Plaza station, according to the MTA. \u201cThis will completely isolate local service from express service, so this will be much less prone to delays,\u201d Alan Foster, the MTA\u2019s Director of Rail Network Planning, said.\n\u2014 Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa is facing increasing pressure to drop out of the mayoral race following Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 announcement that he will no longer seek reelection. But Sliwa told reporters on Monday that \u201cthere\u2019s no dropping out,\u201d\naccording to City &amp; State\n. He also wouldn\u2019t acknowledge who he favors between Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo, saying of the choices: \u201cIt\u2019s the double-headed Hydra.\u201d\n\u2014 In case you needed another reason not to swim in the Hudson River: A federal judge recently sided with a company that is challenging the state\u2019s ban on dumping radiological substances. Holtec International wants to discharge 45,000 gallons of radioactive wastewater into the Hudson as part of its efforts to dismantle the defunct Indian Point nuclear facility in Westchester County,\nthe Times Union reports\n. U.S. District Judge Kenneth Karas ruled last week that New York\u2019s ban on such discharges is unconstitutional.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$18 million\nfor a penthouse at 50 Riverside Boulevard. The Upper West Side condominium unit at One Riverside Park is 6,200 square feet and was sold off-market. Its previous sale was in 2016 as a new-construction unit for $19.7 million,\nper property records\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$25 million\nfor 149 Spring Street. The Soho rental building is eight stories and 18,400 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $35 million for 15 East 62nd Street. The Lenox Hill townhouse is 16,200 square feet and listed by\nBrown Harris Stevens\n.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 20,981-square-foot, seven-story, mixed-use building at 563 Brooklyn Avenue.

        "content": "Eight years ago, the city of Albany required that 5 percent of units in projects with 50 or more units be affordable to the working class. The measure was modest enough that it did not appear to slow housing production.\nBut then Albany\u2019s progressive Common Council got greedy. Overriding vetoes by the mayor, in 2023, it upped the requirement to 7 percent to 13 percent, with larger projects requiring a higher share of affordable units, as well as the maximum rents lowered for those units.\nThis made multifamily development in Albany infeasible.\n\u201cSince the Common Council overrode my two vetoes in early 2023, new proposals for market-rate housing have\ndecreased by 71 percent\n,\u201d Mayor Kathy Sheehan said last year in her State of the City address.\nIt\u2019s only gotten worse since. \u201cBefore the change, the city had thousands of market-rate apartments in the pipeline; after, they have almost\nentirely disappeared\n,\u201d Times Union columnist Chris Churchill wrote this month.\nWithout new homes absorbing demand and competing for tenants, Albany landlords will be able to demand higher rents than they otherwise could. Churchill noted that the \u201cdisastrous law\u201d was \u201cdesigned to make Albany more affordable but threatens the opposite.\u201d\nSheehan has continued to urge the council to undo the policy, but her mayoralty will end this year without that happening.\nAlbany Council members have obviously not read the bestseller \u201cAbundance,\u201d which journalists Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson wrote to persuade fellow liberals to let America build the way it once did \u2014 and the way other nations now do.\nKlein and Thompson opined that Donald Trump\u2019s election was aided by progressives\u2019 not providing enough of what Americans need. One key failure was not building enough housing.\n\nLiberals have famously choked production in high-demand cities such as New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco with restrictive zoning, thick bureaucracy and a mind-boggling array of regulations and mandates. (Conservatives have done the same in blue states\u2019 NIMBY suburbs.)\nNew York got 322,000 new homes in the 1950s and\n369,000 in the \u201960s\nbefore a citywide downzoning kicked in. In the next five decades, the average production was 144,000.\nMeager production\nwas understandable when demand to live in the city was weak, but it was incredibly strong in the 2010s and yet only 169,000 units were built.\nProgressive politicians have belatedly begun to realize that more supply is essential to solving the housing crisis. But they still reduce the effectiveness of their own efforts to boost housing production, and sometimes wipe it out completely, as Albany did.\nIn New York City from 2014 to 2021, the de Blasio administration upzoned eight neighborhoods, but capped rents in at least 25 percent of apartments built on any upzoned parcel citywide.\nThis policy, Mandatory Inclusionary Housing, proved feasible in\nstrong markets\nbut\nnot in weak ones\n. It also forced developers to seek higher rents in MIH projects\u2019 market-rate units to subsidize the affordable ones.\nIt takes votes to pass pro-housing measures, and many laws would not have been approved by left-leaning legislatures without the political cover of affordability requirements and other feel-good provisions. But as Klein and Thompson explain in their book, these add-ons went too far.\n\u201cIn California broadly, and San Francisco specifically,\u201d they wrote, \u201cdozens of pro-housing bills have\nnot\nled to the construction of more homes in part because those bills are layered with additional requirements and standards that builders must meet in order to take advantage of the newly streamlined processes.\u201d\nThe authors concluded, \u201cFor developers we spoke with, the added costs of compliance weren\u2019t worth it.\u201d\n",

        "content": "There were 195 transactions totaling $252 million recorded in New York City from the evening of Friday, Sept. 26 until before 4:00 p.m. on Monday, Sept. 29.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Residential:\nThe priciest residential sale recorded in New York City was in Murray Hill. Irish talk show host\nGraham Norton\nand his husband, filmmaker\nJono McLeod,\nshed a carriage house at\n6 Sniffen Court\nfor $5.3 million. The buyer was\nMaisydogNY LLC.\nThe property dates to 1864 and has two bedrooms, two and a half baths and a roof deck. Norton, who purchased the home in the early 2000s, and McLeod put it on the market in May for just under $5.6 million. Corcoran\u2019s\nChris Kann\nhad the listing.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe top commercial transaction recorded in the city was in Soho, where a multifamily building at\n149 Spring Street\nsold for $25 million. The seller was an affiliate of developer\nEMP Capital Group\n, which purchased the 18,000-square-foot, eight-story property in 2022 for $17 million. The buyer in the latest deal was a company tied to\nCyrus Hakakian.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nBritish talk show host\nRicky Gervais\nand his girlfriend\nJane Fallon\nparted with a condo at\n140 East 63rd Street\nin Lenox Hill for $1.4 million, sold to an LLC. The couple had purchased the unit in 2008 for $1.7 million. The 800-square-foot apartment has one bedroom and one and a half baths. It went on the market in May for $1.5 million. Compass\u2019\nKatherine Camp\nand\nEric Schwarzkopf\nrepresented Gervais and Fallon, who still own a larger unit in the building.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nTolib Mansurov\n, a Brooklyn developer accused of arranging straw donations to Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 2021 mayoral campaign, sold a Park Slope development site for $24 million. Mansurov, who hasn\u2019t faced charges and denied the allegations, according to The City, filed plans in July to construct a 14-story, 99-unit mixed-use development at the site, which includes:\n67, 69, 71, 73, 75, and 77 Fourth Avenue\nand\n77 Saint Marks Place.\nThe buyer was\nShimon Kleinman\n, according to\nCrain\u2019s\n.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nIn Tribeca, an affiliate of\nOlshan Properties\npaid $13 million for a commercial condo unit at\n93 Hudson Street\n. The seller was an LLC tied to\nAEW Capital Management\nthat had purchased the units a decade ago for $48 million \u2014 73 percent more than the latest transaction. The office property stands 16 stories tall with six units.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nTwo adjacent one-story stores at\n272-06 and 272-08 Union Turnpike\nin New Hyde Park traded for $6.2 million. The seller was\nHillside-Queens Co. LLC\n, which had owned the site for decades. The buyer was\nSAMP 272 LLC.\n\nBy the Numbers:\nA tale of two boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn diverge on affordability\nEverything is relative, and that\u2019s especially true for aspiring homeowners in Manhattan.\nIt may be New York City\u2019s priciest, but Manhattan was the sole borough in the quarter whose home-buying affordability improved over the past year based on median price, according to a TRD Data analysis of third-quarter\nhousing data from Attom\n. It was also the only borough whose affordability was below its historical norm.\nOf course, buyers still needed to earn an annual income north of $360,000 just to afford the typical home on the island; the median household income there is\n$106,000\n. Manhattan buyers also had to drop at least 60 percent of their salaries \u2014 more than twice the recommended amount \u2014 on major home-buying costs.\nCorrection: Friday\u2019s Data Digest incorrectly described developer Yitzchok Schwartz\u2019s plan for a development site at\n960 Franklin Avenue in Crown Heights\n. Schwartz intends to construct a 300-unit condominium project on the property.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "Some of the biggest mansions in and around Los Angeles haven\u2019t been fetching anywhere near their original listing prices, despite former ownership by some big-name celebrities.\nThis month alone, homes once owned by Milwaukee Brewers minority owner Robert Beyer, singer Ricky Martin, and previously married Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck have sold or are asking for well under their listing price, Mansion Global\nreported\n.\nBeyer has been trying to sell his custom-built mansion in Brentwood since September 2023, listing it two years ago for $75 million. It\nsold earlier this month for $44 million\n, marking a 40 percent discount.\nThe Beverly Hills former home of Ricky Martin and Doris Day before him is on the market for just under $50 million, down $25.1 million from\nits August listing price of $75 million\n,\nper\nMansion Global. The 2.4-acre property includes the 9,200-square-foot mansion; Michael Smith, CEO of natural gas exporter Freeport LNG, bought the property from Martin in 2006 for $15 million.\nThe former marital home of Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck in Beverly Hills similarly took a haircut. That property is asking $52 million, or $16 million less than when it\nwent on the market last July for $68 million\n. The megamansion is located in the tony Beverly Crest enclave and spans 38,000 square feet.\nOver the past three years, the only listing over $50 million to sell for close to the asking price was a mansion in Beverly Park formerly owned by Mark Wahlberg. That property sold in June to Paris Hilton for $63.1 million, about $5 million less than the asking price. Wahlberg built the estate in 2014 and asked $87.5 million in April 2022 before finding a buyer for $55 million in February 2023.\n\nMeasure ULA\n, the so-called \u201cmansion tax\u201d that went into effect in April 2023, could be one of the reasons L.A.\u2019s ritziest homes are selling at a discount, Santiago Arana of The Agency told the outlet. Under that law, properties sold over $5 million face a 4 percent tax, and sales of $10 million or more are dealt a 5.5 percent tax.\nThe Los Angeles housing market is still feeling the effects of January\u2019s deadly wildfires. Some homeowners in the area are having a harder time securing property insurance as a result of the blazes. The fires that torched homes across the Pacific Palisades, Malibu and Altadena hastened the comedown from a pandemic-era sales boom.\nDisconnects between buyer and seller expectations, however, are a nationwide problem \u2014 so much so that U.S. home sales have fallen to their lowest levels in decades, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. Those looking for luxury homes, however, might want to pounce on a property before others start to circle.\n\u201cIn the high-end areas, we\u2019re the last ones to go down and the first ones to bounce back,\u201d Arana said. \u201cSo by the time you hear people talking about turning a corner, then it\u2019s too late \u2014 you didn\u2019t buy at the bottom. It\u2019s already the time to buy, and, in my opinion, it\u2019s going to start to slowly climb back.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Two decades after transforming a polluted paint factory site into a retail hub, Baker Development is ready to cash out.\nThe Chicago firm listed its Elston Retail Collection for just under $72.5 million, Costar\nreported\n. The asking price breaks down to about $383 per square foot.\nThe four buildings, at 2100-2196 North Elston Avenue comprise 189,000 square feet, and are fully leased to Best Buy, Kohl\u2019s, BMO Bank and Chicago Speech Therapy, with an average of more than five years left on their terms.\nA buyer could assume $58 million in debt on the property, carrying a below-market rate of 3.65 percent. Annual net operating income is pegged at $4.6 million, implying a 7 percent cap rate. Leases stretch into the early 2030s, each with rent bumps and renewal options. Chicago Speech Therapy recently signed a 10-year lease for an 8,500-square-foot space formerly home to Bubbles Academy, filling the last vacancy.\nMarketing materials pitch the complex as a rare triple-net-leased buy on the edge of\nBucktown\nand Lincoln Park, near the Kennedy Expressway and the long-stalled\nLincoln Yards\nsite. Boulder Group broker Jimmy Goodman, who\u2019s handling the listing, called it \u201cgenerational real estate in Chicago.\u201d\n\nThe sale would mark the end of a long hold for Baker, which began assembling 11 acres of industrial and residential parcels along Elston in the early 2000s. The developer, led by CEO Warren Baker, remediated the land, won a zoning change, and built the retail boxes and parking garage. The rezoning was part of an early push to chip away at the riverfront\u2019s industrial corridor designation, a process that later unlocked 760 acres for mixed-use development. That wave has already brought the Triangle Square apartments across the street, and JDL and Kayne Anderson\u2019s proposed\n3,300-unit Foundry Park\njust north at Lincoln Yards.\nBaker is pivoting toward industrial projects in Arizona, where the company has another office. Earlier this year, it sold the\nElevate Lincoln Park\napartments for nearly $114 million to Tishman Speyer, also with an assumable low-interest loan.\nGoodman said the timing could be right for a retail deal of this size.\n\u201cThere are bigger deals transacting and more institutional capital being deployed,\u201d he said.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The $235 million plan calls for a 254-key hotel connected to expanded meeting and convention facilities and parking garages spanning 70,000 square feet, the Houston Business Journal r\neported\n. The development aims to reposition Rosenberg as a regional draw for tourism, trade shows and business gatherings.\nThe $120 million, 230,000 square-foot complex will be \u201ca true game-changer for our community,\u201d said Fort Bend County Judge KP George..\nOfficials hope the project will complement the arena and catalyze retail, restaurant and hospitality development in the fast-growing corridor southwest of Houston.\nThe arena, at 28505 Southwest Freeway, opened a year ago with 10,000 seats, flexible floor space and a slate of concerts, sports and family entertainment. The venue has already hosted everything from high school graduations to national acts like All Elite Wrestling\u2019s \u201cDynamite\u201d and \u201cRampage,\u201d plus Hot Wheels\u2019 Monster Trucks Live Glow Party.\n\nThe region\u2019s growth trajectory is already evident.\nFort Bend\nis one of the fastest-growing counties in the country, with a booming population and rising demand for venues that can accommodate large-scale events. Local boosters believe the EpiCenter can capture a share of the conferences and entertainment business that typically defaults to Houston. If the hotel and convention piece comes together,\nRosenberg\ncould emerge as a secondary hub in Greater Houston\u2019s event economy.\nBuilding and maintaining public event venues often strains local budgets, however, and competition for concerts and conventions is fierce. Houston\u2019s established convention center and suburban venues like\nSugar Land\u2019s\nSmart Financial Centre dominate the market. But Fort Bend County officials see an opening: a mid-sized, modern facility that can land bookings too big for local gyms but too small for or priced out of downtown Houston.\nIf the packed crowds at wrestling shows and monster truck rallies are any indication, the arena has already proven it can draw.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "For a quarter century, Houston\u2019s wealthiest power players have funneled hundreds of millions into shaping politics in Texas and beyond. Who are they?\nThe top 25 Houston-area donors shelled out roughly $350 million to politicians and committees between 2001 and April 2025, according to an\nanalysis\nof campaign finance data by the Houston Chronicle.\nNo one came close to matching late homebuilder Bob Perry\u2019s giving. A longtime bankroller of conservative causes, Perry poured more than $63 million into campaigns and PACs before his 2013 death \u2014 nearly $30 million more than the next highest donor, John Nau, the former Silver Eagle Distributors CEO.\nBehind them were a mix of familiar names such as billionaire\nTilman Fertitta\nwith $7.9 million in donations. Currently the U.S. Ambassador to Italy, the CEO of Fertitta Entertainment owns the Houston Rockets, Landry\u2019s restaurants and the Golden Nugget Hotel and Casinos.\nOther\nreal estate executives\non the list include Alan Hassenflu of Fidelity Realty Partners and construction magnate Doug Pitcock.\nHassenflu, who is associated with Texans for Lawsuit Reform, donated nearly $5.5 million. Pitcock\u2019s $12.85 million in donations went primarily to state candidates but also Republican PACs.\n\nDick Weekley dropped more than $29 million on various causes. He founded Weekley Homes with his brother David in the 1970s, and donated heavily to causes such as Texans for Lawsuit Reform, the single biggest winner of Houston megadonor largesse.\nThat Houston-founded anti-tort-reform\nadvocacy group\nhas rewritten Texas\u2019 civil justice code and collected more than $37 million from the donor group, nearly 40 percent of all local political giving to state committees.\nGov. Greg Abbott\u2019s campaigns have received $24 million from Houston donors, while federal GOP committees such as American Crossroads and Restore Our Future pulled in $19 million and $13 million, respectively. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick netted about $7 million from the city\u2019s donor class.\nGiving strategies varied. Some, like energy trader John Addison, focused on federal PACs, while others \u2014 including Hassenflu \u2014 zeroed in on\nstate-level committees\n. Fertitta, Pitcock and businessman Stuart Stedman spread their checks across governors\u2019 races. Collectively, Houston-area donors steered $95 million to more than 200 state committees, and $154 million to nearly 500 federal committees.\nThe analysis also highlighted partisan divides. Donors to Democrat\u2019s causes, such as trial lawyers Amber and the late Steve Mostyn, clustered together, while the majority of Houston\u2019s megadonors lined up with\nRepublican\ncommittees. Fertitta and former hedge fund manager John Arnold straddled the two camps, cutting checks to groups backed by both parties.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Family patriarch Joseph Durst purchased the building for his burgeoning real estate empire more than 80 years ago.

It identified 48 new listings, and a total of 1,029 active listings on the market.\nOf the properties that found buyers last week, 13 were single-family homes and six were condos. The condos that found buyers are asking an average of $9.3 million, or $2,596 per square foot, and spent an average of 211 days on the market.\nThe single-family homes total $86.3 million in asking dollar volume and averaged 74 days on the market. The average asking price works out to $6.6 million.\n\nThe most expensive listing to find a buyer is the 5,000-square-foot unit 2203 at\nthe Bristol\nat 1100 South Flagler Drive in West Palm Beach, asking $22.9 million. Records show the seller is Grandin LLC, a Delaware entity that bought the unit for $12.2 million in 2020. Developers Al Adelson and Gene Golub completed the 25-story, 69-unit Bristol in 2019. Unit 2203 has four bedrooms, five bathrooms and one half-bathroom, property records show.\nThe condo hit the market for $29 million in 2023, and the price was reduced three times in the years since then, according to Zillow. John and Lisa Cregan with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty have the listing.\nThe second most expensive home to go pending was the 5,000-square-foot house at 218 El Brillo Way in\nPalm Beach\n, asking $20.9 million. Records show the seller is the estate of the late Suzanne Murray, who died in November. Murray was the wife of the late Terry Murray, a financier and the longtime head of Fleet Bank, which Bank of America acquired for $48 billion in 2003. The pair were prominent Rhode Island philanthropists and socialites, and he was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame in 1990.\nThe couple bought the El Brillo Way home for $2.1 million in 1997, records show. It was built on half an acre in 1950, and includes four bedrooms, five bathrooms, one half-bathroom and a pool, according to property records.\nIt was listed for $23.9 million in January, and the price dropped to $20.9 million in August, Zillow shows.

The home previously asked\n79.5 million\n, but the done deal still marks one of the priciest sales in the Hamptons this year.\nThe seller was a limited liability company connected to the estate of Polly Bruckmann, who was the wife of investment banker Donald Bruckmann.

Roosevelt\u2019s Secretary of the Treasury, William H. Woodin, and goes by the name \u201cDune House\u201d due to its position overlooking the Atlantic, according to the listing.\nCompass\u2019 Ed Petrie, James Petrie and Charles Forsman had the listing.

The property initially asked $89 million.\nIn the second quarter, there were 26 home sales in the Hamptons for at least $10 million, four more than there were in the same period last year and well above the six recorded for the quarter in 2023, according to a Douglas Elliman report by appraiser Jonathan Miller.\u00a0\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Billionaire Steve Cohen\u2019s plan for an $8 billion casino complex is heading to the final round of the state\u2019s casino licensing competition.\nA community advisory committee voted unanimously to advance Metropolitan Park, a project that would transform 50 acres of parking lots next to Citi Field.\nThe approval means that the proposal heads to the state\u2019s Gaming Facility Location Board for final consideration. The board is expected to select up to three projects by the end of the year for state casino licenses.\nCAC member George Dixon\u2019s affirmative vote came as a surprise, as he was appointed by local Sen. Jessica Ramos, who previously voiced opposition to the project. Afterward, Dixon said he thought the project would be good for the borough, clarifying that his vote did not reflect a change of heart on Ramos\u2019 part.\nMetropolitan Park is up against three other contenders in this final round: MGM Empire City in Yonkers; Queens Aqueduct Casino, operated by Resorts World; and Bally\u2019s in Throggs Neck. The remaining four proposals were eliminated by their respective community advisory committees.\nCohen\u2019s proposal nearly didn\u2019t make it to this key vote. The parking lot next to Citi Field is technically parkland, and the team needed state lawmakers to approve park alienation legislation to move forward. Sen. Ramos refused to introduce such a bill, which could have killed the project if Sen. John Liu, who represents part of the project site, hadn\u2019t ultimately sponsored alienation legislation. The legislature signed off on the bill in May.\n\nThe project would include a Hard Rock hotel and a 5,650-person live music venue, along with bars, restaurants and 25 acres of green space.\nThe project team, which includes Cohen and Hard Rock Entertainment, has indicated that if the state awards Metropolitan Park a license in December, it could begin construction the next month.\nPart of what won over Liu was the team\u2019s commitment to include Flushing Skypark, elevated bike and pedestrian paths that would connect Metropolitan Park, downtown Flushing and other neighborhoods cut off by Flushing Creek, as part of its plan. If Skypark doesn\u2019t get built, Cohen has pledged $100 million for upgrades to Flushing Meadows Corona Park.\nThe team also partnered with Slate Property Group to build 450 units of affordable housing on a parking lot at 54-19 100th Street, a few miles away from the casino project.\nMost expect the state to award MGM and Resorts World two of the three licenses available for downstate casinos, given they both already operate as racinos. That leaves Bally\u2019s and Metropolitan Park proposals competing against each other for the remaining license.\nCohen\u2019s pitch is the larger of the two and is projected to generate $850 million in tax revenue by its third year of operation, compared to $357 million in annual state and local taxes projected for the Bally\u2019s proposal. The state board will evaluate the casino proposals on a number of factors, but will give elements related to economic activity and business development \u2014\u00a0such as tax revenue, total investment and jobs created \u2014\u00a0the most weight.\n",

With the Miami market itself changing as rapidly as the brokerage model, hearing C-level insight is no longer optional \u2014 it\u2019s necessary.\nThe Real Deal\nis bringing the brokerage battle to the stage at the\n2025 Miami Real Estate Forum\n. We\u2019re hosting a frank, high-stakes conversation designed to pull back the curtain on the future of the agent-firm relationship. The session\n\u201c\nBrokerage Wars: What Do Brokerages Owe Their Agents?\n\u201c\nbrings together two of the industry\u2019s most influential leaders,\nGuy Gal of Side\nand\nMichael Liebowitz of Douglas Elliman,\nto weigh in.\nGal and Liebowitz will debate both the tangible and intangible value brokerages provide, defining how this critical relationship is evolving today. Is the future about\nbrand equity\n, cutting-edge tech platforms, unique\nculture\n, or simply the pure\neconomics\nof the split? This candid debate about the core business of brokerage is a must-watch for anyone who wants to understand what they should demand from their brokerage moving forward.\n\nWe\u2019ll also hear from Mauricio Umansky, CEO and founder of The Agency and co-founder of American Real Estate Association, in a\nPower Breakfast\non the opening day of\nTRD\nForum, Nov. 5. Attendees of this exclusive breakfast event will hear Umansky\u2019s take on everything from his deal-making strategies to leadership in luxury real estate, and will include an interactive Q&amp;A as part of the breakfast.\nDon\u2019t miss your chance to hear these C-level conversations live.

        "content": "Jim Letchinger is in the driver\u2019s seat for one of Chicago\u2019s most notorious North Side real estate projects.\nThe Chicago-based developer\u2019s firm JDL and its investment partner Kayne Anderson closed Tuesday morning on an $84 million purchase of most of the troubled former Lincoln Yards site from lender\nBank OZK, which took a hefty loss\non debt issued against the property with the deal.\nJDL\u2019s takeover of the project is the latest in a series of positive signs for Chicago megadevelopments targeting sprawling vacant landscapes that have all been caught in limbo for years.\nEarlier this month, publicly traded asset manager\nBlue Owl and developers Related Midwest and CRG closed on a $58 million deal\nto take control of the former U.S. Steel South Works site to start building a multi-billion dollar quantum computing and microelectronics campus for PsiQuantum, advancing a rethink of the South Side property after decades of uncertainty and multiple failed plans.\nFurthermore,\nRelated Midwest\u2019s project The 78\nreceived an infusion of momentum last week when the Chicago City Council approved billionaire Joe Manseuto\u2019s Major League Soccer team Chicago Fire FC to build a $650 million privately financed stadium on the property nestled between the South Loop and Chinatown, providing the megaproject the anchor it has sought for years.\nThe 31-acre northern portion of Lincoln Yards \u2014 which JDL and Kayne\nrenamed Foundry Park\n\u2014 was seized by Bank OZK after its previous owners, Dallas-based Lone Star Funds and Chicago-based Sterling Bay, defaulted on a $126 million loan. Bank OZK wrote the loan value down to $84 million before selling to Letchinger and Kayne, which have redrawn the previous plans for the land, envisioned by Sterling Bay as a $6 billion mixed-use campus, to focus on residential development.\n\nFoundry Park, which sits along the Chicago River between Bucktown and Lincoln Park, will feature far less office use than planned by the previous development team, which planned 14.5 million square feet of buildings. Instead, JDL and Kayne\u2019s $1 billion plans include 3,300 housing units, mostly rentals, with some to be designated for sale in later phases. Their plan also includes up to 350,000 square feet of office space, 435,000 square feet of retail, 250,000 square feet of hospitality and 12 acres of open space, according to city records.\nIt is also likely to scale back the required infrastructure improvements on the site, an aspect that proved to be a difficult hurdle for Sterling Bay, which agreed to front the cost of nearly $500 million in public works construction before starting construction, as part of its redevelopment arrangement with the city.\nLike Sterling Bay, Letchinger at one point also eyed the vacant land on both sides of the Chicago River at the site, but his plan to purchase the southern portion, consisting of 22 acres, from a joint venture of JP Morgan Asset Management and Sterling fizzled out as the bank\u2019s investment arm balked at making a deal earlier this summer. Letchinger has said he would still consider purchasing the southern acreage if it becomes available but is focused on advancing the northern side\u2019s development for now.\nBank OZK didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment on the transaction, and Letchinger confirmed the closing.\nFor Sterling Bay \u2014 which spent hundreds of millions assembling industrial real estate along the river, demolishing structures and remediating the sites to prepare their redevelopment \u2014 the\nLincoln Yards project turned into a financial disaster\n. JP Morgan has also explored exiting its position on the southern side at a loss, as Lone Star did by declining to further support the cost of debt service and refinancing for the northern side.\nNext door to the southern portion, the only property Sterling Bay completed in the area is a vacant life sciences-oriented building that\u2019s for sale and carrying a $64.7 million loan from Bank OZK that matured earlier this month. It\u2019s expected to fetch a value that\u2019s less than the loan balance, according to commercial real estate insiders.",

        "content": "Meyer Chetrit\nhas been indicted on criminal charges in Manhattan.\nThe developer, who is part of Manhattan\nreal estate\u2019s influential Chetrit family\n, has been accused by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg of harassing older, rent-regulated tenants in Chelsea over five years.\nBragg and Jocelyn Strauber, commissioner of the city\u2019s Department of Investigation, said Chetrit \u201cwaged a campaign of harassment\u201d against two septuagenarians, hoping they would move out so the building could be sold.\n\u201cFrom winters without heat and unrepaired roofs causing leaks and ceiling collapses, these New Yorkers were forced to live in uninhabitable conditions,\u201d Bragg said in a statement.\nChetrit, along with West Paramount LLC and The Chetrit Group, has been charged with two counts of harassment of a rent-regulated tenant in the first degree. Those charges are classified as a class E felony and carry a maximum sentence of four years in prison. However, there are many sentencing alternatives for nonviolent offenders with no prior felony convictions.\nA lawyer for Chetrit did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He has pled not guilty, according to court records.\n\nA release from the district attorney\u2019s office refers to an unnamed codefendant who has been indicted but has not yet appeared in court.\nThe tenants lived at 117-119 West 26th Street in Chelsea since the 1980s, according to the release.\nChetrit and the unnamed codefendant purchased the building in 2005 but failed to complete its conversion from commercial lofts to residential housing, according to the release. The apartments are classified as \u201cinterim multiple dwellings,\u201d and overseen by the city\u2019s Loft Board.\nIn addition to extended periods without heat and a ceiling collapse, the building has been without an elevator since September 2023, the DA\u2019s office said. That year, part of the building\u2019s unoccupied commercial section collapsed, prompting a partial vacate order.\nChetrit is facing several civil suits, including\naccusations that he is shielding assets to avoid paying a $132 million judgement\nto a lender. Attorneys for Chetrit in that case \u201cdeny in the strongest terms possible any and all allegations of fraud or wrongdoing,\u201d they said in August.\n",

        "content": "The clock is ticking on the federal flood insurance program, and\nFlorida real estate\ncould take the biggest hit if Congress fails to act.\nThe National Flood Insurance Program, which covers nearly 1.8 million Florida policyholders, is set to expire Sept. 30 unless lawmakers strike a deal to keep the government funded, the Palm Beach Post\nreported\n. If the program lapses, existing claims would still be paid, but no new policies could be written, a major problem for closings in flood-prone areas where mortgage lenders require coverage.\nThat could derail sales across the state\u2019s high-risk coastal zones at the height of hurricane season. Florida has more NFIP policyholders than any other state, thanks to its low elevation and more than 8,400 miles of coastline.\nWhile Congress has let NFIP technically expire 33 times in the past eight years, it has always been renewed. Still, some industry insiders say this round feels different, given rising political dysfunction.\nThe program\u2019s borrowing authority would also be capped at $1 billion during a lapse, raising the risk of delayed claim payments.\nFor Florida homeowners, the private market is hardly a fallback.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a [flood zone rated as high risk], then you have to go to the private market, and it\u2019s going to be much more expensive,\u201d Fort Lauderdale insurance broker Andy Kasten told the Post.\n\nCitizens Property Insurance, the state\u2019s insurer of last resort, has already started requiring all policyholders to carry flood insurance, further ratcheting up costs.\nMortgage pros warn the impact could ripple through housing affordability.\n\u201cJust supply and demand tells me prices will go up,\u201d said Bradley Greenleaf, a Fort Lauderdale loan officer, who noted that many buyers are already struggling. The National Association of Realtors estimates 1,300 home sales nationwide could be disrupted each day if NFIP lapses.\nYet most industry veterans still expect Congress to kick the can, citing flood insurance\u2019s systemic importance.\n\u201cIt will probably still be around forever, because that\u2019s the bank\u2019s protection,\u201d said Arden Insurance\u2019s Robert Norberg.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

However, Chilton didn\u2019t market the interior of the home, assuming the right buyer would want to teardown and rebuild.\n\u201cThe main draw for this property is obviously the land itself,\u201d Chilton said.\nHowever, the buyer is keeping the house, she said.\nAustin is \u201cdefinitely in a buyer\u2019s market,\u201d Chilton said. While the signs are clear now, the city hasn\u2019t rebounded to its pandemic-era growth, Chilton claims.\n\n\u201cThis property would have easily sold for $7 million in 2022 or 2021,\u201d Chilton said.\nThe home listed in August of last year for $6.5 million. The price fell to $6 million in December and to $5 million in May. A 2021 Xcursion pontoon boat was included in the deal.\nThe Austin market is shedding some luxury buyers\n, as people who moved here during the pandemic from places like California are moving back, Chilton said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s affected the market in addition to our pendulum swing downward. The people who came here are now leaving,\u201d Chilton said.\nAustin luxury homes, particularly on Lake Travis\n, have lingered on the market this year.\nLuxury condos\nare also selling more slowly than in recent years. The top sale in Austin last week, a 2023 mansion on 2 acres at 4800 Mondonedo Cove, also had a modest price cut from $6 million when it listed in April to $5.9 million.It\u2019s not the first noteworthy Austin luxury property to welcome teardowns. The agent for the \u201c\nBouldin Treehouse\n,\u201d an idiosyncratic build at 801 Post Oak Street, showed the home on HGTV\u2019s \u201cZillow Gone Wild\u201d but marketed the lot\u2019s redevelopment potential in the listing.\n",

The Manhattan-based operator says OYO blindsided it with an Aug. 1 notice canceling the deal, four years before its scheduled end, citing issues tied to an entirely different property.\nHighgate called the move \u201cbizarre\u201d and warned it would violate state law requiring 90 days\u2019 notice for mass layoffs.\nAt issue is a 10-year management agreement that entitles Highgate to a 3.25 percent cut of the hotel\u2019s gross revenue. OYO, for its part, is supposed to provide working capital to the property, which Highgate describes as \u201cwell-performing.\u201d\nThe operator says the hotel\u2019s unionized staff, employed under a collective bargaining agreement, would be illegally displaced under OYO\u2019s termination order.\n\nHighgate\u2019s lawsuit argues losing the Times Square assignment would cause \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to its reputation and workforce, and that OYO has threatened further legal action if it doesn\u2019t vacate the hotel by Oct. 1.\nAn attorney for Highgate declined to comment to the publication, while OYO did not return requests for comment.\nThe fight pits one of New York\u2019s biggest management companies against one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing hotel owners.\nHighgate controls more than 30 New York hotels\nand 500 globally, while OYO,\nbacked by SoftBank\n, bought Motel 6 from Blackstone last year for $525 million and is reportedly prepping an $800 million initial public offering.\nThis year, Alex Sapir\nreplaced\nHighgate with Crescent Hotel Management to operate the NoMo Soho hotel.

Newmark\u2019s Adam Spies and Adam Doneger are overseeing the sale process.\nThe offices are spread across 24 floors in the 70-story building, which was\ndeveloped by Bruce Eichner in 1990\n. Eichner infamously built the tower 11 feet taller than was allowed.\nTishman Speyer in 2004 acquired a 51 percent stake in the office portion, which it owns with GIC, Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund.\n\nThe 2020 renovation included an upgraded lobby, modern elevators, a new cooling system and a handful of prebuilt suites. Major tenants include the law firm Windels Marx Lane &amp; Mittendorf, the New York Road Runners and Calers, as well as Tishman Speyer\u2019s co-working company Studio.\nThe marketing materials show the 31,000-square-foot Studio could be converted into traditional office space or an amenity floor, depending on an investor\u2019s risk appetite.\nTishman Speyer has been more active in the investment sales market lately.\nThe company has sold three office buildings in Beverly Hills over the past year, including a 300,000-square-foot property at 345 North Maple Drive it sold to Kilroy Realty earlier this month for\n$205 million\n.\nIn May, the company made its first New York office acquisition since 2019, paying slightly more than\n$105 million\nto buy the Soho retail and office building at 148 Lafayette Street.\n",

The project could include a hotel, published reports state.\nLast week, the Miami Dade College board of trustees voted to give the land to the state, which set up Tuesday\u2019s vote by DeSantis and the three cabinet members. In 2004, the college paid $25 million for the property, and two previous attempts to develop the site fell through.

        "content": "A plan to bring a 48-unit apartment building to Edgebrook is dead after 45th Ward Alderman Jim Gardiner announced his opposition, following a raucous, three-hour community meeting that packed the Edgebrook School gym with more than 200 residents, Block Club Chicago\nreported\n.\nThe proposal from Drexel Properties called for a five-story building at 5500 West Devon Avenue, with ground-floor retail and 30 parking spaces. Apartments would have ranged from $2,700 one-bedrooms to $4,000 three-bedrooms, with 20 percent set aside for affordable units under the city\u2019s ordinance.\nOpponents said the project didn\u2019t fit the neighborhood\u2019s character and warned it would exacerbate traffic and parking woes. Supporters said the development could bring younger residents, foot traffic and a boost to struggling local businesses.\nIn a newsletter last week, Gardiner said he would not back the zoning change needed to move the project forward.\n\u201cYour feedback made it clear this project is not the right fit for our community,\u201d Gardiner wrote.\nDrexel founder Jeff Weinberg said the firm would not pursue the development.\n\nThe site, near the Edgebrook Metra station and North Branch Trail, houses a Compass Real Estate office, a cigar shop and a hair salon. Compass broker Phil Barone pitched the property to Drexel, whose principals envisioned the building as appealing to local downsizers and remote-working professionals. Drexel had pledged to manage the property itself and to relocate displaced businesses during construction.\nConcerns over height, density and rentals dominated the opposition. Neighbors said five stories would overwhelm the low-rise district and called for condos instead of apartments. Others warned that with just 30 parking spaces, spillover traffic would make streets unsafe. Some critics also blasted renters as transient, while advocates argued the city\u2019s housing crunch makes new supply essential.\nThe difficulty of pushing multifamily projects into Chicago\u2019s bungalow belt, even near transit, is apparent in several recent moves in the outer stretches of the city proper and suburbs as communities try to balance housing needs with\ncommunity standards\n.\nA recent plan to rezone Broadway in\nEdgewater and Uptown\nthat would allow for denser residential projects and more commercial uses had neighborhood groups waging all-out campaigns for and against it.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The exact price Prime paid for the loan wasn\u2019t disclosed, though the seller might have let it go at a discount given that the debt matures next summer and will need to be refinanced or repaid then, a source told the outlet.\nIn buying the debt,\nPrime Finance\npositioned the property to stay in the hands of Reilly, owner of the San Francisco Examiner and a portfolio of mostly historic commercial properties in San Francisco. Reilly, also a political strategist, was adamant about keeping the building in his portfolio.\nHe was caught off guard when American Home, a subsidiary of American International Group, listed the loan for sale in June. He purchased the building in 2018 for $128 million. That comes to $778 per square foot for the $164,500 square foot building.\n\u201cI have no intention of selling this building, or letting anyone else own it,\u201d Reilly\ntold\nthe outlet in June\nwhen the debt went on the market\n. \u201cThe issues around all of these office buildings going back to lenders \u2014 that is not what is happening here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re selling the loan at a discount so they can get out of town.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Reilly aimed to either acquire the debt himself or pay back any third-party buyer trying to take control of the building via foreclosure.\nPrime will likely stay on as lender rather than try to acquire the building outright, sources told the outlet. That will put Prime in a position to foreclose should the need arise. Reilly said he plans to work with Prime to refinance the loan when it matures in June.\nThe slow and steady recovery of San Francisco\u2019s office market has been marked by\nbuildings selling for less\nthan the value of the debt used to acquire them. That losing formula, combined with higher interest rates, has repelled cautious lenders from moving on any loan with a near-term maturity.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "One thing is clear about the battle for leadership of Silver Star Properties: it\u2019s going to take a while.\nThe Houston-based REIT is engaged in a nasty proxy battle with ex-CEO Allen Hartman and once again wants to delay the vote in response to Hartman\u2019s messaging to shareholders. Voting is underway and will wrap up before a shareholder meeting scheduled for Oct. 6.\nSilver Star claims Hartman is lying to shareholders to secure their votes and re-install him as CEO. The lawsuit fact-checks the materials Hartman has been disseminating to shareholders, including claims about executive compensation, the company\u2019s performance and allegations that Silver Star is lying to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\u201cWe have been advised by our proxy solicitor that some shareholders recently changed their votes from Silver Star to Hartman based on his unfounded accusations,\u201d Silver Star Director Jack Tompkins wrote in an affidavit attached to the suit.\nSilver Star asked a Maryland District Court to push the vote until Dec. 31 to provide a \u201ccooling-off period.\u201d The suit was filed in Maryland, because, though it\u2019s headquartered in Houston, it\u2019s a Maryland corporation.\nHartman called the filing part of Silver Star\u2019s \u201congoing effort to illegally reject the Company\u2019s bylaws, which require an annual shareholder meeting.\u201d\n\u201cBy pushing to delay the vote, Silver Star is seeking to extend their control, continue collecting salaries and fees, and further destroy shareholder value for their own benefit at the expense of the Company and its investors,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nSilver Star already delayed the shareholder meeting from August to October, telling shareholders the move was made because Hartman was \u201ccreating chaos\u201d and \u201cso that you have full and accurate information before casting your vote.\u201d\nThe filing is the latest development in the yearslong saga of Hartman\u2019s separation from the company he founded in 2009.\nHartman was ousted by the company\u2019s board in 2023 for accusations of nepotism and mismanagement that allegedly culminated in Silver Star defaulting on a $259 million CMBS loan from Goldman Sachs in October 2023. Silver Star trustees\nsued Hartman for $50 million\nin December 2023, accusing him of fraud and self-dealing. The\nSEC opened an inquiry\ninto the firm in February 2024. The board also claimed that Hartman has been trying to sabotage the company since his ouster.\nHartman has denied the allegations.\nAmid the firm\u2019s financial struggles, Haddock spearheaded an effort to sell off Silver Star\u2019s 35-property portfolio of low-to-mid-tier office properties and pivot to self-storage. It\u2019s not been easy. A Silver Star subsidiary filed for bankruptcy in 2023. Last month, the firm faced foreclosure on a $57.8 million loan from Benefit Street Partners tied to three office properties.\nMeanwhile, the company has been collecting self-storage properties, including a $26.5 million property at 14810 Hagen Ranch Road in Delray Beach, Florida, which it purchased a year ago.\n",

An NYPD representative said on Tuesday that the remains are in the process of being identified and that a cause of death is being determined.\nThe representative didn\u2019t provide additional information on what was discovered, but the New York Post reported that the remains included a human skull, as well as a leg and hip bone.\nThe city has big plans for the defunct airport site, which is surrounded by a chainlink fence that encloses wetlands and sits across from a shopping center on 20th Avenue near 132nd Street.\nIn July, the Adams administration\ntapped\nCirrus Workforce Housing and LCOR to build 3,000 units of workforce housing at the former airport, which was decommissioned in 1984. The project is expected to include the housing, as well as a new station for the New York City Police Department, along with 60 acres of public space, walking trails and preserved freshwater wetland.\n\nIt was not clear at what part of the site the remains were found. A source familiar with the matter indicated that the surveying work was being done as part of preparations for development of the site.\nRepresentatives for City Hall and the development team did not return requests seeking more information.\nThe project is being funded in part through a workforce housing fund launched by Cirrus, the city and construction pension funds last year. As of July, the fund has raised $300 million.\nCirrus and LCOR are also\npoised\nto take over the remaining sites at the Brooklyn megadevelopment known as Pacific Park. The state still needs to sign off on the joint venture before the development rights are transferred. For the six remaining railyard sites, U.S. Immigration Fund and Fortress Investment Group are expected to remain part of the development joint venture but will not have an active role in managing the development.\nThe developers are also seeking to develop a separate property known as Site 5, home to a former Modell\u2019s and a P.C.

The lots will range from 20,000 square feet to 25,000 square feet.\nConstruction and home sales are expected to start this year, with base prices ranging from $1.6 million to $1.8 million, Carr told\nThe Real Deal\nin June.\nThe project, called Estates by Turnberry, marks a redesign of Turnberry\u2019s proposal over a decade ago for 2 million square feet of offices and retail, plus a hotel.\nThe Davie Planning &amp; Zoning Board approved CC Homes\u2019 project on April 8, and the town council preliminarily approved it on May 7. The council\u2019s final vote of\napprova\nl was on May 21.\nThe council also approved a community development district for the project. Developers use CDDs to help pay for infrastructure needed for large projects, including water and sewer connections, roads and sidewalks. Generally,\nCDDs\nissue bonds and then levy assessments on homebuyers to pay back the bonds.\nDavie Mayor Judy Paul said at the May 7 town council meeting that she had cast the only \u2018no\u2019 vote against a previously proposed \u201cmassive shopping center\u201d on the site, likely a reference to Turnberry\u2019s project.\n\nTurnberry\u2019s previously planned development, called Davie Commons, fizzled out after KBNP bought the\n$17.4 million\nmortgage Turnberry had on the land in 2012. The previous lender, KeyBank, had filed a foreclosure on the loan.\nKBNP is tied to Jackie Soffer and reportedly also to New York investors.\nCC Homes\n, based in Coral Gables, was formed at least 15 years ago by Codina and Carr.\nCodina\nis founder of Coral Gables-based Codina Partners, which he leads with his daughter Ana-Marie Codina. Codina Partners is a major South Florida developer, with completed projects including the Downtown Doral mixed-use development in Doral and Beacon Logistics Park in Hialeah.\nCarr\nfounded land development and homebuilding firm Westbrooke Communities in 1976. After selling it to Pacific USA Holdings in 1998, he remained Westbrooke\u2019s president and CEO until 2001. Carr formed multifamily and urban infill development firm Carr Residential I in 2001, according to CC Homes\u2019 website.\nCC Homes recently completed\nPine Rockland Estates\nwith 26 single-family homes at Southwest 72nd Street near Coral Gables. The community is sold out, according to CC Homes\u2019 website.\nAlso in\nDavie\n, Hollywood-based BSD Capital paid\n$16 million\nin July for a 4.8-acre development site at 4491 South State Road 7, with plans for The Core, consisting of a pair of 24-story buildings with 744 apartments, 51,000 square feet of retail and 29,000 square feet of offices.\nCoconut Grove-based 13th Floor Investments and Miami Beach-based JSB Capital Group scored a\n$67.5 million\nconstruction loan in March for a 383-unit apartment complex with some workforce apartments on the northwest corner of Davie Road and Southwest 37th Street in Davie.\n",

        "content": "Longtime North Shore agent Peter Cummins jumped from @properties to Baird &amp; Warner to lead a new team, blasting his old firm\u2019s parent Compass and its push for office exclusives as a major reason for the move.\nHis leap underscores tension between corporate-owned brokerages and local firms as Compass \u2014 @properties\u2019 parent company following its\n$444 million acquisition\nthis year \u2014 seeks to grow its market share and transform the residential real estate industry. Compass announced Sept. 22 it\nplans to acquire Anywhere Real Estate\n, its next-biggest competitor. Anywhere includes brands like Coldwell Banker, Century 21 and Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nCummins joined Baird &amp; Warner about five weeks ago, he said, before Compass announced its plan to acquire Anywhere. But he said his opposition to Compass\u2019 business model was a major factor in his decision to jump to Baird &amp; Warner, a family-owned brokerage. He said he supports a model where listings are shared freely between agents instead of brokerages holding pocket listings marketed only internally.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a part of that,\u201d Cummins said in an interview of Compass\u2019 marketing strategy. \u201cBecause I think it\u2019s contrary to everything I\u2019ve ever learned and been exposed to.\u201d\nCompass has pushed for a three-phase marketing strategy, in which some listings start out as Compass exclusives marketed only to fellow Compass agents. The company has argued the model gives sellers more freedom and privacy and helps them test pricing before their house hits the open market, where statistics such as number of days listed and price cuts are publicly tracked and, according to some, stigmatize certain offerings.\nCummins has more than $500 million in career sales, and said he averaged $20 million to $30 million in annual transaction volume over the last few years. Cummins joined @properties in 2010, and has developed real estate on the North Shore. Before getting into real estate, he worked as assistant city manager in Lake Forest and the village manager of Lake Bluff and Glencoe.\nCummins will lead a new team, Cummins Advisors, at Baird &amp; Warner. He previously did not have a team at @properties. Cummins said he\u2019s planning to bring together three to five agents for his team, including his son, Liam Cummins.\nCummins spoke positively of his experiences at @properties and the company\u2019s co-CEOs, Thad Wong and Mike Golden. But he said he doesn\u2019t support Compass\u2019 business model and wanted to join a brokerage that shared his philosophy of providing a transparent market for agents and consumers.\n\nBaird &amp; Warner has been an advocate of Clear Cooperation, a National Association of Realtors policy requiring agents to enter a listing in the MLS within 24 hours of publicly marketing it. @properties and Compass have\nopposed that policy\n, saying it limits options for agents and sellers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much the future of our industry that I care about,\u201d Cummins said. \u201cAnd I want to be a part of people who share that vision.\u201d\nBaird &amp; Warner president and CEO Steve Baird said in a previous interview with\nThe Real Deal\nthat he views Compass\u2019 consolidation and growing market share as an opportunity to differentiate his brokerage as an independent firm and potentially pick up some agents. Baird &amp; Warner acquired competitor Dream Town Real Estate this year, uniting the city\u2019s two largest\nindependent brokerages\n.\nA spokesperson for @properties declined to comment, and a Compass spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCompass CEO Robert Reffkin said in a call with investors after announcing the merger with Anywhere that the merger will help develop a \u201cunified operating system\u201d for residential real estate using Compass\u2019 vast network of agents. Some brokers, including Cummins, have speculated Compass may move to a model where users need to subscribe to see certain listings that aren\u2019t on the MLS or public listing services.\n\u201cReffkin\u2019s plan is to try to create a Compass profile that works like Amazon,\u201d Cummins said. \u201cAnd if you really want to see these listings before they come out for the world, you better be a part of Compass. And if you\u2019re a consumer, we\u2019re not necessarily going to give away that information for free.\u201d\nThe move also signals Baird &amp; Warner\u2019s expansion in the North Shore amid growing competition for the luxury lakefront market. Baird &amp; Warner has an office in Winnetka, but its presence on the North Shore is not as dominant as Compass and @properties, which hold a large share of the listings there.\nCompass recently sold five offices in the North Shore to\nJanice Corley\u2019s RE/MAX Premier\n, cutting down its brick-and-mortar presence in cities where @properties also has offices. It\u2019s unclear how many of the agents at those offices will move to RE/MAX Premier.\n\u201cThe North Shore in particular is a land of opportunity to do things right,\u201d Cummins said. \u201c And there\u2019s a ton of great agents who, I know, share this philosophy about doing what\u2019s best for the consumer.\u201d",

        "content": "The\nforeclosure auction block across Texas\nis usually crowded with dilapidated Class C apartment complexes, but that\u2019s not the case with this suburban Austin multifamily asset.\nCanada\u2019s largest private landlord is facing foreclosure on Emerson at Buda, built in 2021. The property, at 950 FM 2001, is scheduled to be auctioned after owner Starlight Investments defaulted on a $47.7 million loan from Natixis, according to a foreclosure notice.\nThe auction is scheduled for Oct. 17 at 10:30 a.m.\nThe Toronto-based firm bought the 304-unit property in April 2022. The mortgage works out to $157,000 per unit.\nEmerson at Buda is a garden-style community with a gym, pool, cabanas and co-working spaces. The property is about 16 miles south of downtown Austin in Buda, a fast-growing town of about 15,000 people in the Austin-San Antonio megaregion. Its population has grown more than 8 percent since 2020.\nA historic wave of apartment supply came online in Austin over the last two years, causing rental rates and occupancy levels to plummet.\n\nRents have fallen so much in Austin\nthat the city leads the country in rental affordability, JLL\u2019s Kai Pan said at a recent\nTexas multifamily conference\nhosted by Connect CRE. Decreased rents, paired with high salaries, mean Austin renters, on average, spend 16.8 percent of their income on rent.\nEmerson at Buda\u2019s website archives make it possible to track how the Austin rent rate rollercoaster affected the property.\nThree years ago, one-bedroom apartments at Emerson at Buda started at $1,238 per month. Today, those same units are starting at $1,019, a drop of almost 18 percent. Rates for two-bedroom units have dropped even more. They started at $1,598 three years ago, and are now being offered for $1,278, a reduction of 20 percent.\nEven with the price drops, the property is offering concessions: a $1,000 credit for renters who sign a lease for a one-bedroom apartment and one month free for those who rent a two-bedroom apartment.\nExperts warn Texas multifamily distress is just beginning. In the next five years, $19 billion in CMBS loans tied to Texas multifamily will mature, CWCapital\u2019s James Shevlin said.\n",

The outlet reported that CBRE brokered the deal.\nAT&amp;T will join Guidehouse at the Reserve, a consulting firm that leased 107,000 square feet there a year ago. The building was left vacant for about three years after Nationwide left the complex and sold it in 2021.\nThe announcement is another blow to downtown San Antonio\u2019s beleaguered office market. For over a year, the city\u2019s office vacancy rate has been stable at about 17 percent according to JLL. The downtown submarket, however, has seen\nvacancy rates as high as 27 percent\n. PwC, local insurance giant USAA and Visionworks have all recently parted ways with downtown for outer reaches of the city.\nThe move comes as AT&amp;T considers\na similar shift in Dallas\n.\n\nThe company currently leases 1.1 million-square-foot lease at the 37-story Whitacre Tower, at 208 South Akard Street in downtown Dallas. The lease ends in 2030, but AT&amp;T is pondering a move to the Dallas suburbs,\nmuch to the dismay of Dallas politicians\nwho say the massive vacancy left by AT&amp;T would be a catastrophic blow to the downtown office market.\nExecutives have been touring sites like the Park at Legacy in Plano, but the firm\u2019s plans remain unclear.\nAT&amp;T already picked up office space in Richardson\nearlier this year, inking a deal to occupy 186,000 square feet at Lakeside Boulevard Tower in Richardson. The company has said it plans to grow its Richardson workforce from 400 to up to 1,400.\nThe company has been headquartered in Dallas since 2008, when the firm exited San Antonio for North Texas.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Ares\u2019 purchase was also $23 million above the previous sale price six years ago.\nThe seller, an affiliate of Boston-based Cabot Properties, paid $33 million for the 15.9-acre site in 2019, records show.

In May, a trust affiliated with Ares acquired the former Miami Herald headquarters in Doral for\n$25.9 million\n.\nThe seller of that property, Atlanta-based Panattoni Development, had begun demolishing the office building on the 9-acre site, but abandoned plans to redevelop the property into two warehouses spanning 153,653 square feet with 171 parking spaces. Ares paid $4 million less than Panattoni\u2019s purchase price last year.\nIn October, Ares dropped\n$147 million\nfor Midway Miami Park, a warehouse complex in Miami Lakes made up of four warehouses. The transaction was the fourth largest industrial deal in South Florida for 2024.\nAres is also partnering with Miami billionaire Jorge Mas and retired soccer star David Beckham to develop the $1 billion Miami Freedom Park, a massive mixed-use project in Miami, anchored by a new 25,000-seat home for Inter Miami Major League Soccer franchise. In April, the partnership scored a\n$450 million\nconstruction loan for the soccer stadium, which is nearly completed.\nAlso this year, Ares teamed up with Monarch Alternative Capital to provide a\n$413 million\nloan for One Twenty Brickell Residences, a planned two-tower Miami condominium with 803 units to be developed by PMG.",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s housing market is defying the national slowdown, with prices rising faster than in most of the country, even as sales volume plunged to the lowest August levels since 2011.\nThe median home price in the city hit $378,000 in August, up 5.9 percent year-over-year, according to Illinois Realtors. Across the nine-county metro, the median reached $375,000, up 5.6 percent. The national median was $422,600, a 2 percent bump, according to\nNational Association of Realtors\ndata first\nreported\nby Crain\u2019s.\nThe Case-Shiller Index confirmed the trend, showing July values in the region up 6.23 percent from a year earlier, compared with just 1.68 percent nationwide.\nThat makes\nChicago\nan outlier. Price growth here has stayed above 6 percent every month this year, and increased from June (6.09 percent) to July (6.23 percent) while nationally the rate has fallen by more than half since January. Half of the 30 major metros covered by the index had lower price growth in July than in June. The Illinois Realtors data comprises Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Grundy, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will counties.\nThe surge means equity gains and rising\nhousing wealth\nfor sellers and homeowners.\n\nBut for buyers, the math is tough. August sales in the city totaled just 1,920 homes, down nearly 10 percent from a year earlier and the weakest August since the post-crash recovery of 2011. Metro-wide sales dropped 4.3 percent to 8,395, also the lowest since 2011. By contrast, sales ticked up nationally 1.8 percent year-over-year, according to NAR.\nMeanwhile, contract cancellations are on the rise. Sixteen percent of pending agreements in Chicago were\ncanceled\n, a slight increase from last year and consistent with national trends showing the highest July cancellation rates since 2017.\nThe squeeze comes from a familiar combo: elevated mortgage rates and thin inventory. Homeowners who might otherwise trade up are staying put, wary of locking in higher borrowing costs and higher prices. That keeps listings scarce, pushing buyers to pay more for the limited homes available.\nChicago\u2019s unusual position \u2014 leading the nation in price gains while trailing badly in sales volume \u2014 is like a split personality in the market. Sellers are in a strong spot on paper, but deals are drying up. Chicago-area home sales in August were down year-over-year 0.8 percent.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "As Sonoma developer\nKen Mattson\nawaits trial for\nallegedly defrauding hundreds of local homeowners\n, one of his firm\u2019s lending partners has come under scrutiny of its own.\nVictims of Mattson have pointed out Socotra Capital\u2019s purported role in Mattson\u2019s wide-reaching alleged Ponzi scheme, The Press Democrat\nreported\n.\nThe Sacramento-based lender bankrolled much of Mattson\u2019s shopping spree, wherein KS Mattson Partners acquired 88 properties in and around the city of Sonoma. From 2007 to 2024, Mattson allegedly\nsold investors fake interests\nin real estate investment limited partnerships, using victims\u2019 money to fund personal expenses and pay other investors,\naccording\nto the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSocotra Capital provided Mattson\u2019s firms with more than 100 loans totaling upwards of $180 million, according to the Press Democrat. The loans covered notable local sites including Ravenswood Winery, boutique lodging properties like Cottage Inn &amp; Span and An Inn to Remember, and even chocolate factory Cocoa Planet. Many of those properties are now on the auction block in bankruptcies related to Mattson\u2019s dealings.\nSocotra holds liens on 75 properties tied to Mattson\u2019s network, court documents reviewed by the news outlet show. The debt totals more than $100 million. And while the hard-money lender has not been accused of wrongdoing, investors who lost money through Mattson\u2019s alleged fraud want to put a magnifying glass on the firm.\n\u201cFrom Socotra\u2019s website, they proclaim, \u2018We\u2019re not like your conventional lenders with strict parameters, slow turnarounds, and unnecessary hoops to jump through,\u2019\u201d Matt Treger, who invested with Mattson over more than 15 years, told the Press Democrat. \u201cAs someone whose life savings has been swallowed up, their business model seems clear evidence that parameters and hoops are an essential part of a just system.\u201d\n\nFederal prosecutors noted Socotra\u2019s role in the scandal by referring to it in the\nMay 13 indictment\nas \u201cLending Entity 1.\u201d For its part, Socotra denies knowledge of any of Mattson\u2019s actions.\n\u201cWith regards to KS Mattson [Partners], we had no knowledge or involvement in Mattson\u2019s alleged wrongdoing. Socotra acted appropriately and in accordance with the law at all times,\u201d a company spokesperson told the outlet. \u201cAs a secured, first-position lender, all our loans are secured by high-quality real estate, including those related to KS Mattson loans.\u201d\nMattson stands accused of wire fraud, money laundering and obstruction of justice in a nine-count indictment. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for each count of wire fraud and the obstruction of justice count and 10 years in prison for the money laundering count.\nSo far, Socotra hasn\u2019t faced legal complaints of its own from Mattson\u2019s investors or regulators.\n\u201cIn the aftermath of their lending spree, to continue putting profits over the victims in a scheme they enabled and benefitted from would feel morally reprehensible,\u201d Treger said. \u201cMy hope is that, as an investor group, we pursue every avenue to determine accountability and recompense\u2026 They may be trying to protect their profits, while we as victims are fighting for our lives and what was taken from us.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Since then, the cloud data company has transformed its headquarters into a hub for artificial intelligence moguls across the region.\nThe firm opened its \u201cSilicon Valley AI Hub\u201d last week. It\u2019s a 30,000-square-foot space on the top floor of its\nMenlo Park\nheadquarters, the San Francisco Standard\nreported\n.\nThe space is designed for companies and developers interested in AI to exchange knowledge and develop their products. In a recent event there, executives at OpenAI, Windsurf and\nGlean\ngave their ideas on how to scale AI startups, per the Standard.\nTo inaugurate the space, 13 startups will set up operations at the hub over the course of three months. They\u2019ll have access to coworking space, professional video studios and snacks for employees, as well as Snowflake\u2019s computing infrastructure and proximity to the firm\u2019s investor network.\nThat\u2019s not all; next year Snowflake will expand the space with a rooftop restaurant and bar, transforming it from a simple workspace to a destination for workers on and off the clock.\n\nThe public release of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT in 2022 prompted Snowflake to lean hard into AI. Between 2020 \u2014 when it had its IPO \u2014 and 2025, the company\u2019s headcount ballooned from 1,000 to 8,000. As the\nfirm grew\n, it needed space to accommodate all of its employees.\nLast year, it settled on\nsubleasing a 773,000-square-foot, three-building campus\nin Menlo Park that Meta had pre-leased and built out but never occupied. That deal is still the Bay Area\u2019s largest post-pandemic office lease.\nWith summer melting away, Snowflake is preparing for a blizzard of new releases. In November, the company is set to unveil a host of AI products. While it\u2019s partnered in the past with OpenAI and Anthropic to integrate language models into its products, Snowflake wants to cross-pollinate with as many AI voices as possible, and its AI hub is meant to be the meeting place.\nThe company plans to host up to 10 events a week at the AI hub, Snowflake chief marketing officer Denise Persson said. Those could include networking dinners, hackathons and educational sessions. The hope is that Snowflake will be able to discover and work with some of the brightest new minds in the\nbooming sector\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

She\u2019s converting the 37,000-square-foot warehouse, at 2501 Commerce Street, into an exhibition hall and event space, while the former lumber offices, at 25 Live Oak Alley, will become a 96-key boutique hotel with a rooftop bar.\nThe exhibition hall is slated to open in November with a splashy debut: the Balloon Museum, a global traveling art installation featuring large-scale inflatable sculptures. The $450,000 warehouse conversion is being designed by Conejo Architecture, and Molina told the outlet she\u2019s working \u201cseven days a week\u201d to meet the deadline, with weddings, quincea\u00f1eras and private events expected to follow.\nThe hotel, scheduled to open in time for the\n2026 World Cup\n, will add two floors to the historic 1938 concrete structure, bringing the building to four stories and 78,700 square feet. Designed by MCS Architects, the $4 million project won\u2019t carry a major hotel flag at launch.\n\nMolina, who founded Bonita Grand Holdings, bought the properties in 2019 and began planning last year. She previously advised real estate clients in Florida before diving into development herself.\nMolina\u2019s project joins other boutique hotel developments in Houston\u2019s hospitality pipeline, like\nHotel Daphne\n. The 51-key hotel, at 347 West 20th Street, is expected to open in early 2026. The developer is Austin-based Bunkhouse Hotels, the firm behind Hotel Saint Augustine in Montrose.\nThe timing also coincides with broader\ndevelopment momentum\naround Houston\u2019s East End, including the\noverhaul of the George R.

Now, rents on new leases are slipping in places such as Dallas, Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville, among the most oversupplied housing markets in the country.\nMeanwhile, single-family landlord giants like Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent, who previously bet that stretched affordability would keep young families renting, are also feeling the heat.\nNationally, more than 3 million homes were put up for sale at the start of summer, but only 28 percent found buyers, leaving nearly 2 million unsold, according to housing analytics firm Parcl Labs. That\u2019s a fifth higher than the same time last year.\nWith sellers either slashing prices, delisting or defaulting to renting, the spillover is hitting single-family rental operators.\n\nInvitation, which owns about 80,000 homes, reported rent declines for new tenants in several Florida and Texas cities. To offset the slide, it and rival AMH are raising rents for existing tenants; Invitation raised rates for existing tenants by 6.2 percent in South Florida this year, even as new renters got a slight discount.\nThat tactic props up revenue for now, but it risks widening the gap between in-place and market rents, potentially spurring turnover.\nInvestors who piled into the single-family rental trade during the pandemic are also feeling the squeeze. Shares of big landlords have lagged behind the S&amp;P 500, homebuilders and apartment real estate investment trusts.\nIronically, a break in mortgage rates could ease the glut of unsold homes now leaking into rentals, but it would also lure more renters into homeownership, raising vacancy risk.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A group of conservative City Council members is making a last-ditch effort to stop ballot measures that could overhaul how certain housing projects are approved in the city.\nMembers of the Council\u2019s Common Sense Caucus filed a lawsuit asking a state Supreme Court to void three\nquestions\nthat will be posed to voters in November.\nThe questions, if approved, would weaken the City Council\u2019s sway over certain housing and infrastructure projects, in an effort to speed up construction and sidestep members who are notoriously against new housing in their districts.\nThe lawsuit claims three of the five ballot measures violate city and state environmental laws by \u201cfailing to incorporate environmental concerns and considerations into the ballot proposals.\u201d\n\u201cPetitioners are not opposed to increased housing \u2013 particularly affordable housing \u2013 or in solving the housing crisis,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cPetitioners are opposed, however, to covering up and concealing the environmental consequences of the ballot proposals.\u201d\nThe lawsuit \u2014 filed against Mayor Eric Adams, his Charter Revision Commission and the Board of Elections \u2014 alleges that the questions should be annulled until the environmental consequences of the measures are assessed. Plaintiffs include Council members Joann Ariola, David Carr and Robert Holden, along with other Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, community groups and Council member Darlene Mealy, a Brooklyn Democrat.\nThe Board of Elections certified and printed the ballots this month, meaning that it is too late for the questions to be removed.\nCouncil members have not been shy about their opposition to the ballot measures, which threaten a fundamental power members have held since the 1980s.\nThe City Council effectively has the final say over land use actions through the city\u2019s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, or Ulurp. Members tend to vote according to the wishes of the local member, in a tradition called member deference (though the Council\ndefied\nthe practice last week with two small housing projects).\nOne of the ballot questions targeted by the lawsuit asks whether the city should replace the rarely-used mayoral veto in Ulurp with a three-member appeals board for certain housing projects. The board would be able to reverse Council decisions on projects that would result in affordable housing in one borough.\nAnother question asks voters if modest housing and infrastructure projects should go through a quicker review process, dubbed Expedited Land Use Review Procedure, or Elurp, that skips City Council or City Planning approval, depending on the project type.\n\nThe third proposal would fast-track housing (avoiding a Council vote) in the 12 districts that have approved the lowest rates of affordable housing over a five-year period.\nThe other two\nquestions\non the ballot, which have gone unchallenged, ask if local elections should be moved to even years, coinciding with presidential elections, and if the official street map of the city should be digitized and consolidated.\nThe questions are the same three that City Council leaders have called misleading. Speaker Adrienne Adams has said the proposals threaten to consolidate power in City Hall, while stripping Council members of leverage to secure deeper housing affordability and other benefits when negotiating with developers.\nThe Council tried to\nconvince\nthe city Board of Elections to remove the questions before ballots were printed.\nThat effort\nfailed\n, and Speaker Adams said she wouldn\u2019t file a lawsuit, opting for a public campaign against the measures instead.\nA spokesperson for Council leadership indicated on Tuesday that the Speaker and broader Council are not involved with the Common Sense Caucus\u2019 lawsuit. A representative for the Common Sense Caucus said that attorneys working on the case have filed the lawsuit pro bono.\nThe complaint shares plaintiffs and some arguments with\nanother lawsuit\nfiled in March, which alleged that the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity should be annulled. The complaint, also led by members of the Common Sense Caucus, claimed that the Adams administration violated city and state environmental laws by failing to do a comprehensive review of the impact of the zoning changes.\nThe Black Institute, Queens Civic Congress, Midtown South Community Council and Park West Village Tenants\u2019 Association are listed as plaintiffs in both cases. Attorney Jack Lester is also working on the two lawsuits.\nThe City Council recently launched a\nwebsite\nurging New Yorkers to vote against the three questions. Proponents of the questions, including pro-housing group Open New York, announced this month that they would spend $3 million to promote the ballot measures.\n\u201cThe GOP doesn\u2019t want affordable housing on the ballot because they know the truth: these measures are widely popular, will pass overwhelmingly, and help keep New York the most diverse and dynamic city in the world,\u201d Amit Singh, director of the YES on Affordable Housing campaign, said in a statement. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it here, I\u2019ve got a house to sell you in Nassau County.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Moshe Silber filed for personal bankruptcy as creditors circle the imprisoned real estate investor.\nSilber\n, who amassed a 10,000-unit multifamily portfolio by his early 30s, made the filing this month in New York\u2019s Southern District. He claimed he owned no property, had no income and no assets.\nSilber\u2019s bankruptcy filing shows a drastically different picture than his financial statements showed just three years ago. Silber once flaunted items and investments worth millions, including luxury cars, jewelry and a private jet, alongside multiple homes in upstate New York. He also owned part of a bank in Westchester County.\nThe managers in charge of one of Silber\u2019s former holdings companies, CBRM Realty, are seeking to move the case from New York to New Jersey, where CBRM\u2019s bankruptcy is ongoing.\nCBRM\u2019s attorneys claim Silber filed for personal bankruptcy on the eve of CBRM\u2019s plan to commence legal action against him. They claim that Silber mismanaged properties and \u201cextracted tens of millions (if not hundreds of millions of dollars) of value from those properties for his own benefit.\u201d\nSilber\u2019s personal bankruptcy blocks litigation in New York State Supreme Court, including at least three lawsuits from creditors seeking to pursue Silber for tens of millions of dollars over unpaid debts.\nSilber, of Suffern, New York, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud last year and was sentenced in March to 30 months in prison. It was part of a broader investigation into commercial mortgage fraud by the Department of Justice and the Federal Housing and Finance Agency.\nSilber and his co-conspirators allegedly provided a fraudulent purchase price of $95.8 million for their 976-unit apartment complex in\nCincinnati\nto obtain a $70 million mortgage from JLL and Fannie Mae. The judge presiding over the case noted Silber\u2019s fraud was significant because of the \u201clayers and labyrinth of chicanery.\u201d\nOnce Silber pleaded guilty, he was effectively banned from managing CBRM and its 6,300-unit\u00a0 multifamily portfolio. He appointed an independent fiduciary, which was approved by CBRM\u2019s noteholders. (Silber had obtained $200 million in financing from bondholders.)\n\nBut Silber and his co-conspirator Fred Schulman allegedly refused to give up the equity interests in the CBRM portfolio. This made it difficult to find financing for the bankruptcy or for the properties, according to a filing by CBRM\u2019s lawyers.\nSilber\u2019s properties were mostly vacant and had negative cash flow. Some units were uninhabitable. He was being pursued separately by the Alleghany County, Pennsylvania, District Attorney for taking money from his company\u2019s apartment properties outside of Pittsburgh.\nUnder the direction of an independent fiduciary, CBRM filed for bankruptcy in May to stop a creditor\u2019s attempt to\nsell\nthe company, which controlled 6,300 multifamily units, at a sheriff sale.\nCBRM is now trying to sell its properties through bankruptcy, including 1,512 units, in New Orleans. A portion of the proceeds will go toward funding litigation against Silber and Schulman.\nCBRM said Silber has made life difficult for the restructuring managers. The firm\u2019s lawyers tried to depose Silber this month in jail, but Silber asserted the Fifth Amendment to all substantive questions, according to a court filing.\nSilber\u2019s attorney declined to comment. CBRM\u2019s attorney did not respond to a request to comment.\nSilber\u2019s attorney initially filed the bankruptcy as a Chapter 7, a liquidation of assets, but later claimed it was an error and he meant to file Chapter 11, a restructuring.\nThe bankruptcy petition also makes a number of other surprising claims, including that Silber has not lived anywhere else in the past three years. (Silber\u2019s prison sentence started in early 2025.) It also claims he is not married, but at the time of Silber\u2019s sentencing earlier this year, he claimed he was married.\nThe filing states Moshe Silber borrowed money from his father Zalman Silber to cover his bankruptcy legal fees.\n",

The company is expected to build a\nsurf park\nwith state-of-the-art artificial wave technology for those looking to hang 10.\nToba Capital acquired the parcel from California landlord Continental Corporation. Continental bought the 30-acre office campus from Raytheon in 2021 with plans to redevelop it into a 600,000-square-foot mixed-use complex called Impact at Nash, with office, retail and media production portions.\nContinental and Mar Ventures redeveloped a 14-acre portion of the site into the\nChargers\u2019 $260 million training center and headquarters\n, which opened last year. As demand for offices and residences lost steam, Continental decided to sell off the property.\nThough he made his fortune selling his tech company to Dell Computer, Smith is no stranger to creating surf parks. Smith is an avid surfer and spent $80 million to convert the former Knotts Soak City water park in\nPalm Springs\ninto the Palm Springs Surf Club, which opened last year. The 21-acre complex has a wave pool large enough for 25 surfers at once and features a lazy river and restaurants.\n\nThe goal is to do the same in Los Angeles and possibly in other cities across the United States.\nAbout 20 surf parks worldwide are in operation, with\nfour in the U.S.\nand several others debuting in the next two years. Kelly Slater Wave Company, founded by the world record-holding surfer Kelly Slater,\noperates a complex at Surf Ranch\nin Kings County, California, and provides its wave technology to Surf Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.\nIn San Diego County, developer N4FL is planning to start construction next year on Ocean Kamp, a sprawling resort complex with a 3.5-acre wave pool, 700 housing units, a 300-room hotel and commercial spaces on a 92-acre former drive-in theater site in Oceanside, the outlet said.\nMeanwhile, In Newport Beach, a proposal for a 7-acre wave pool is moving forward, though residents have voiced opposition to the plan, which would partially involve the replacement of a portion of the public Newport Beach Golf Course.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

An Ikea store will occupy the first and second floors, totaling about 25,000 square feet.\nThe building is a 58,000-square-foot, six-story commercial building at the corner of Broadway and Spring Street, according to BKSK, the building\u2019s architect. The space is currently occupied by Nike.\nThe upper floors will be converted to office space and operated by Ingka, the company said.\nSutton\u2019s firm bought the building for $146.9 million in 2013, according to property records. He did not immediately return a request for comment.\nThe property is significantly smaller than Ikea\u2019s already-operating stores. Its Red Hook location, built in 2007, is more than 336,000 square feet. That location is zoned for big-box retail, while the Broadway location is zoned for more traditional retail, according to city property records.\n\nBut it also wouldn\u2019t be Ikea\u2019s first attempt to fit into a tight space.\nIn 2019, the company opened a \u201cPlanning Studio\u201d at 999 Third Avenue, in a 17,000-square-foot space,\nCurbed\nreported. But that only lasted for three years.

        "content": "I like to say that there are no coincidences in politics.\nCase in point: The last four City Council approvals of a real estate project over the objections of the local member were at the end of four-year election cycles: 2009, 2021 and 2025. Credit for that observation goes to Howard Slatkin of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council.\nThe Council\u2019s message when it ignores the custom of \u201cmember deference\u201d seems to be: \u201cSee? We\u2019re not provincial, turf-protecting insiders! We act in the interest of the whole city!\u201d\nBut we\u2019re talking about four instances in two decades, if not longer. The Council has considered thousands of land use applications in that time, and in 99.9 percent of them, the local member has decided the result.\nMake no mistake: Member deference is alive and well.\nIt\u2019s also not a coincidence that two of the four instances came last week, as the Council was preparing a campaign against City Charter revisions that \u2014 if approved by voters on Nov. 4 \u2014 would weaken member deference.\nPerhaps Council Speaker Adrienne Adams will point to the chamber\u2019s Sept. 25\napproval\nof Bronx and Brooklyn rezonings over the objections of Council members Kristy Marmorato and Simcha Felder, respectively, as evidence that the system works. No reform needed!\nSorry, no. As noted, these are election-year exceptions. True outliers.\nThe 2021 override was to approve a\nNew York Blood Center project\n. In that case, the Council snubbed a member unpopular with his colleagues, Ben Kallos. He had sided with\nentitled Upper East Side residents\nwho claimed shadows would ruin their precious playground. Project supporters said it was more important to find a cure for sickle cell anemia.\nTo be sure, there was some political theater going on. Kallos claimed he might have negotiated a deal with developer Longfellow Real Estate Partners had Council leaders not hijacked the process.\nIncidentally, the Blood Center project has\nyet to break ground\n.\nGetting back to charter revision: One measure would create an appeals process for applicants voted down by the Council. Rejections could be overturned by getting two votes from a three-member panel of the mayor, borough president and Council speaker.\nWill any voters change their minds about the charter questions as a result of the Council\u2019s votes last Thursday? No chance. Only land-use geeks will even connect those dots. But the Charter Revision Commission can take some credit for the overrides.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhile the Council speaker asks New Yorkers to vote against charter reforms that weaken the Council\u2019s power, Council conservatives and Rep. Nicole Malliotakis\nsued on Tuesday\nto remove those three questions from the ballot.\n\nThey complain that the revisions would fast-track some projects around environmental reviews. That is exactly the point: to stop needless reviews that gum up the process and make housing more expensive.\nOnce upon a time, conservatives sought to free the private sector from bureaucracy and frivolous litigation. Here, they are suing to do the opposite.\nIt\u2019s an ironic but common example of conservatives exploiting processes created by liberals to delay new housing and infrastructure. What are your thoughts? Email them to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: A Quinnipiac\npoll\nof likely New Jersey voters found only 6 percent of them (including 8 percent of Democrats and 4 percent of Republicans) considered affordable housing the most important issue in determining their vote in the governor\u2019s race. Why so few? In part because 63 percent of New Jerseyans are homeowners.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 Remember when residential mortgages\nwere bundled into securities and sold to investors in public markets? That hasn\u2019t happened since 2013 \u2014 not because publicly issued RMBS were banned, but because\nregulations\nput in place five years after the housing crash effectively killed them. The regs required detailed information on every mortgage in these bundled securities.\nLast week, the Securities and Exchange Commission\nasked for comments\nabout reviving them. If that sounds familiar, you are one of the few people who continued paying attention to this issue after \u201c\nThe Big Short\n.\u201d For everyone else: In 2019, then-SEC Chairman Jay Clayton issued an\nidentical request\n. But Donald Trump lost the election, Clayton left his post, and the RMBS effort was mothballed. (Clayton is now the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan.)\n\u2014 President Trump\u2019s new tariffs\non lumber and cabinets will add $720 and $280, respectively, to the cost of a new home,\nUBS estimates\n. The first tariff adds 10 percent to the cost of softwood timber and lumber imports, and the second adds 25 percent to the cost of kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and upholstered wood products.\n\u2014 Want an ADU?\nThe city on Tuesday began accepting applications to create accessory dwelling units through the\nDOB NOW: Build filing portal\n.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$5.75 million\nfor a 2,170-square-foot condominium unit at 151 East 58th Street, One Beacon Court in Sutton Place. Marina Bernshtein with Brown Harris Stevens had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial transaction recorded was $213 million for a 44,200-square-foot retail property at\n529 Broadway in Soho\n. The seller was a joint venture that included Jeff Sutton\u2019s Wharton Properties. The buyer was the furniture store Ikea.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$11.75 million\nfor a pre-war co-op at 770 Park Avenue in Lenox Hill. Leslie R. Coleman and Christina Lee with Brown Harris Stevens have the listing.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "Valerie Russo works two jobs, from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., at a Hudson Valley shopping center. She and her three kids have lived in a motel room for two years, courtesy of Ulster County.\nThe Albany Times Union ran an\nexcellent story\nabout homeless Hudson Valley families stuck in hotels for years, with Russo as its centerpiece.\nHer experience is not unusual. Ulster County has contracts with 24 hotels and two shelters, but families spend an average of\nmore than three years\nin this \u201cemergency\u201d housing.\nFrom a real estate perspective, these contracts are a reliable source of income for hotel owners. But from a social-welfare and public-spending perspective, this is a disaster.\nHotels are built for short visits, not for boys and girls to spend their childhood. The cost to taxpayers for Russo\u2019s room is $110 a night.\nIt would be cheaper to house families in apartments, but the article doesn\u2019t explain why that does not happen. Probably it\u2019s because motels can keep rooms available for immediate placements, while apartment buildings cannot.\nHowever, if the average stay is 1,132 days, it makes no sense to use properties designed for temporary housing. It\u2019s not disclosed why these families are not using rental vouchers, but we know that many more people are eligible for vouchers than actually receive them.\nThe article eventually gets to the question of why the rent in Kingston is too high for working families like Russo\u2019s.\nThis might sound familiar: Two Kingston council members say the area median income used to determine rents for affordable housing is too high because it includes richer areas outside Kingston.\n\nThey propose lowering the AMI by only including Kingston in the metric. That, in turn, would reduce rents that are based on a percentage of AMI.\nSome advocates make\nthe same claim\nabout New York City, where the AMI is elevated by wealthier suburbs.\nThe obvious problem is that in the Real World, legislating lower rents does not reduce the cost of building and operating housing. The lower the rent, the fewer projects pencil out.\nKingston\u2019s mayor and housing director predicted that if the affordability threshold were lowered for multifamily\ndevelopment in Kingston\n, it simply wouldn\u2019t be built.\nIt\u2019s clear that building housing with rents that some families cannot afford is better than not building at all. Without a doubt, the affordable units will become homes for some people who need them.\nHomelessness is largely a housing problem, and it persists in Kingston because housing growth did not keep pace with demand, pushing vacancy rates down and prices up.\nThe city does now have some multifamily developments in the pipeline. But Valerie Russo still might not be able to afford their affordable units \u2014 or any apartments freed up by people moving into the new projects.\nReal estate alone cannot solve her problem, which is as much about her income being too low for a family of four as it is about Kingston rents being too high.\nThe solution in Kingston, as it is in New York City, is a rental voucher and a sufficient supply of housing to ensure she can use it.\n",

        "content": "\ud83c\udfc6 Residential:\nThe priciest residential sale recorded in New York City was for a penthouse overlooking the Hudson River in Lincoln Square that sold for a loss. An LLC paid another LLC just under $18 million for the condo at Extell Development Company\u2019s\n50 Riverside Boulevard\n, which previously traded for $19.7 million almost a decade ago. The six-bedroom, full-floor pad spans nearly 6,200 square feet, pricing the latest deal at about $2,900 per square foot, and has a private elevator landing, 60-foot great room, 100 feet of Hudson River frontage. Actress Kerry Washington once rented the unit for $70,000 a month. The condo first went up for sale in 2021 with an asking price of $27.5 million.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe top commercial transaction recorded in the city went to a joint venture that includes\nJeff Sutton\u2019s Wharton Properties\n, which offloaded a 44,200-square-foot retail property at\n529 Broadway in Soho\nfor $213 million. The buyer was the furniture store Ikea, which had a pop-up in the neighborhood last year at 51 Crosby Street. In what was a record for Soho at the time, the venture purchased the property in 2012 for $147.9 million.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nA trust tied to\nRina Pan\nparted with a condo at\n151 East 58th Street\n, also known as One Beacon Court, in Sutton Place for $5.8 million. Pan purchased the two-bedroom, 2,200-square-foot unit in 2005 for $3.2 million. The buyer was\nEZ Equity NY LLC\n. The unit has been on and off the market since 2010; it went into contract at an asking price of $6.3 million.\nMarina Bernshtein\nwith Brown Harris Stevens had the listing.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nA development site at\n92-94 North 9th Avenue\nin Williamsburg with about 8,000 buildable square feet traded for $3.8 million. The seller of the vacant lot was Floral Park, New York-based investor and developer\nMetropolitan Homes\n. The buyers were\nAvi Dishi\n, founder of Elysee Investment Company, and his wife,\nRachel Dishi\n. Metropolitan Homes paid $1.3 million for the site in 2013.\nBy the Numbers:\nPending home sales jump across U.S. as mortgage rates fall in August\n\nPending home sales rose in August as mortgage rates declined.\nThe National Association of Realtors\u2019\nPending Home Sales Index\n, which measures home sales based on deals in contract, rose 4 percent in August from July and 3.8 percent higher year over year.\nThe rising index, adjusted for seasonality, indicates an improvement in the housing market, as transactions typically take one to two months to finalize. NAR, an industry organization that represents both the commercial and residential sectors, attributed the increase to last month\u2019s\ndrop in borrowing costs\nahead of the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s September meeting\n.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

It was the only California property among the 10 priciest homes last month, which included four sales in Florida between $28 million and $36 million, and a Greenwich, Connecticut, home that sold for $43.5 million.\nThe Benedict Canyon home sold for $2,793 per square foot. It hit the market in 2023 for $72.5 million. It was listed in January for $56.9 million. The buyer was an entity known as Murray Hill Real Estate. Caruso bought the home via RFG-Lavender LLC in 2018 for $16.7 million, or $982 per square foot.\nThe property spans more than 17,000 square feet and features a 130-foot-long driveway, six-car garage, elevator, library and theater. The primary suite is 2,000 square feet and has its own living room and 900-square-foot balcony.

Galvin declined to disclose terms of the pending sale or why Newcastle exited.\nThe refreshed plan leans heavily on smaller units, with a majority set to be studios aimed at offering more attainable rents in one of the city\u2019s hottest neighborhoods. Roughly 20 percent, or 54 units, will be affordable under the city\u2019s ordinance. The project also calls for 3,800 square feet of ground-floor retail and 30 parking spaces \u2014 fewer than Newcastle\u2019s approved version, reflecting the unit mix and the site\u2019s proximity to the Morgan CTA L station.\nGalvin called the site \u201ca tremendous development\u201d opportunity in the heart of Fulton Market. The project is slated for completion in 2027, though financing details are under wraps. He said the venture has seen \u201cstrong interest\u201d from equity and debt partners but isn\u2019t ready to name backers.\n\nApartment construction downtown has slowed sharply amid high interest rates, rising construction costs and broader economic jitters, although several\noffice-to-residential\nconversions are underway. With only a few hundred\nunits\nexpected this year and next, rents have surged, climbing 6.4 percent year-over-year in the second quarter, according to Integra Realty Resources. Developers willing to brave the financing headwinds may find an undersupplied market waiting.\nThe project marks the first ground-up downtown development for\nSloniger\nand his new firm after leaving Marquette, where he pushed the West Loop frontier with projects like Parq Fulton and Evo Union Park.\nGalvin\n, meanwhile, has expanded his brokerage firm into development, partnering last year on the Saint Grand tower in Streeterville.\nThe pivot at 210 North Morgan follows other resets in the area. Newcastle recently sold off another entitled site in the Gold Coast, while Sterling Bay offloaded its 39-story plan at\n350 North Morgan\nearlier this month for a loss.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Developer Dan Kodsi missed a deadline to post a surety bond as part of an agreement reached with his lender, Monarch Alternative Capital, in the Legacy Miami Worldcenter foreclosure.\nKodsi\u2019s Legacy MWC Trustee and Legacy MWC Land Trust have been wrapped up in\nlitigation\nwith New York-based Monarch since the summer over the construction loan backing the Legacy Hotel &amp; Residences project site at Miami Worldcenter. Construction of the 50-story tower has\nbeen on hold\nsince last year.\nIn an order Judge Spencer Eig\nentered in August,\nEig said the developer had until Sept. 22 to post a $32 million surety bond, and until early November to pay Monarch more than $35 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest and late fees. The order was the result of an agreement reached between the borrower and lender. The payment would satisfy the mortgage and eventually resolve the foreclosure suit.\nThe developer\u2019s LLCs \u201cfailed to timely post\u201d the bond, according to Monarch\u2019s notice, filed last Wednesday. Because no surety bond was posted, the developer\u2019s rights to enforce the terms of their agreement \u201cimmediately lapse\u201d and \u201care terminated without further order of the court,\u201d Monarch\u2019s attorney, Josh Rubens, wrote in his notice.\nA source told\nThe Real Deal\nthat the developer has the funds to post the bond, but instead is using those funds to try and settle with Monarch.\n\nRubens declined to comment. Kodsi and his attorney, Joseph Pardo, also declined to comment. The judge\u2019s August order bans the developer, lender, their employees, agents, representatives or attorneys from making any public statements about the case.\nEig\u2019s August order was necessary for the developer to refinance the loan. In a July 31 hearing, Kodsi, CEO of Royal Palm Companies, said he\u2019s working on a $390 million refinancing of the\n$340 million\nloan.\nSilverstein Capital Partners provided the developer with the original construction loan in late 2021, but Silverstein only funded $30 million, Kodsi said during the July 31 hearing. Monarch Alternative Capital took over the loan on June 6 of this year.\nLegacy, a partially built mixed-use condo and hotel tower at 942 Northeast First Avenue in downtown Miami, is expected to have 310 short-term rental-friendly condos, a 219-key hotel and a medical and wellness center. Kodsi launched condo sales in 2019, and the condo portion sold out during the pandemic for an estimated $160 million. Construction began in 2021, and it was expected to be completed last year.\nKodsi\n\u2019s Royal Palm has worked with Monarch before. The developer, in its counterclaim, alleged that Monarch was forced to back down from Monarch\u2019s alleged effort to wipe out Royal Palm\u2019s equity in a Coco Beach project. That\u2019s when Monarch allegedly shifted its attention to the Miami Worldcenter project, Royal Palm alleged.\n",

        "content": "Marx Realty\u2019s 35-story building at 10 Grand Central is nearly full. Craig Deitelzweig, Marx\u2019s CEO, did a multi-million-dollar renovation, adding hotel-like amenities to the drab office that used to go by 708 Third Avenue. Tenant demand is now so furious Deitelzweig raised rents four times in the past year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the strongest office markets that we\u2019ve seen in a decade,\u201d he said.\nNot all New York City office dealmakers will make a claim like that, but most will acknowledge the comeback in a sector that descended into the edges of hell during Covid only to remain in purgatory for years.\nEarlier this year, New York City recorded the lowest office vacancy rate of any major city, according to Moody\u2019s. Foot traffic has exceeded pre-pandemic numbers, Placer.ai data shows. And new leasing in Midtown rose to 5.3 million square feet in the second quarter, its highest mark since 2019, according to a report from Cushman &amp; Wakefield.\nNews from the leasing market has spurred big-ticket deals. RXR\u2019s recent purchase of 590 Madison Avenue, a 1 million-square-foot tower formerly home to IBM, was the first sale of over $1 billion since 2022.\n\u201c590 Madison was finally the culmination of all the trends that we were seeing and the conversations we\u2019ve been having that the market was finally ready to get a billion-dollar-plus single asset sale done,\u201d said Gary Phillips, managing director of Eastdil Secured, who brokered the deal.\nAnother sign of a comeback: Blackstone is looking at the sector. When Jon Gray and the trillion-dollar Blackstone operation put their money into something, others follow. In June, the firm made one of its first moves into office since Covid, acquiring a large stake in Fisher Brothers\u2019 1345 Sixth Avenue. It also bid on 590 Madison and on Paramount Group, the New York City and San Francisco office landlord with 13 million square feet of Class A office space that reached a deal to sell to Rithm Capital in September.\nMeanwhile, Related Companies might build a new office at 625 Madison Avenue, where it had planned a 1,220-foot, 68-story supertall with residential, hotel and retail. The pivot would be to an \u201cAA-class office tower.\u201d\nPadding the environment, the Federal Reserve finally lowered the federal funds rate in September, while suggesting future rate cuts. CBRE already expects an uptick in deals.\nBut the scope of the office comeback is unclear. Institutional investors are still not making broad bets on office, but are surgically picking spots in sub-markets within a sub-market. At the same time, an untold amount of distress is playing out behind the scenes with lenders.\n\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s early days of a recovery in office,\u201d said Spencer Garfield, co-head of CRE credit at Fortress Investment Group. \u201cBut that recovery is underway, and there\u2019s still pain to be had, because there are still over-levered properties, and there are still poorly run properties and undercapitalized sponsors.\u201d\nR\neturn journey\nNew York City\u2019s office comeback story started with leasing.\nWith new construction virtually stopped and the trophy towers of One Vanderbilt, Hudson Yards and Manhattan West filled up, companies searching for space looked elsewhere.\nThey first turned to Park Avenue because of its close proximity to Grand Central, which seemed more convenient than ever for employees returning to the office, especially from the Northern suburbs. With its historic reputation as the premier office address, vacancy rates for Park Avenue declined to less than 10 percent in 2024, far below the city\u2019s average, according to CoStar.\nPark Avenue building owners opted to spend tens of millions on amenities and upgrades.\n\u201cThere happen to be 30 to 40 tenants right now in the market looking for big block space in and around Grand Central and Midtown East.\u201d G\naby Rosen, RFR\nAby Rosen\u2019s RFR Holdings put about $30 million into the Seagram Building, considered the Rolls-Royce of buildings when it was built in the late \u201950s. It\u2019s now fully occupied, averaging leases in the mid-$200s per square foot. Some tenants at Seagram are making forward commitments for 2027 and 2028, son Gaby Rosen noted, because of concerns about finding space in the area.\n\u201cEven though the overall market availability rate is still relatively very high, there is a lack of supply of big block space,\u201d Gaby Rosen of RFR said. \u201cAnd there happen to be 30 to 40 tenants right now in the market looking for big block space in and around Grand Central and Midtown East.\u201d\nSuch tenants scour Midtown for buildings with their desired amenities, including modern lobbies, high ceilings and spacious conference rooms. Options have been limited. Amazon, which needed to find a place for its 350,000 corporate employees returning to the office, inked a 330,000-square-foot lease at Property &amp; Building Corp\u2019s 10 Bryant Park, a 1980s offIce tower with extensive upgrades. It also enlisted WeWork to lease even more space on its behalf.\nYet institutional investors remained on the sidelines. No one wanted to be the first mover, and other business lines, such as private credit, offered returns of over 15 percent, too lucrative for investment giants to pass up.\n\nSo while the leasing upswing brought hope, the lack of sales still led to stagnation. Without comps, investors could not ascertain valuations. The smart money worried about catching a falling knife. What if values dropped further and they were stuck holding an asset with a big mortgage and no buyers?\nN\new life\nBut deals started to trickle in around 2024. Kevin Chisholm\u2019s 60 Guilders and Sentry Realty bought 292 Madison Avenue, a 26-story Midtown office building, from Vanbarton for $90 million, or $450 per square foot, in late 2024. A few months later, Chisholm and Sentry partnered again to buy 1370 Broadway for $75.5 million.\nBoth purchases had hefty discounts, compared to previous sale prices. Neither building would be considered a trophy asset, but at least, the bottom of the market started to emerge.\nIn the summer of 2025, investors felt confident about the fundamentals of New York City. Employees were returning to the office at a faster rate than the rest of the country.\nThat\u2019s when Blackstone reappeared, picking up a 46 percent stake in 1345 Sixth Avenue, a 50-story office tower, as part of a deal that included an $850 million CMBS refinancing.\nAfter years of distancing itself from the asset class and assuring investors it did not have significant exposure to office, Blackstone\u2019s tone changed. It\u2019s okay to own at least some office again, it seemed to be confiding. There\u2019s no shame in being an office landlord.\nDeals kept coming rolling in. In August, RXR purchased 590 Madison Avenue. (Some have described the 43-story, 1 million-square-foot property as a B building in an A+ location.)\nBXP even indicated to investors it might build its 46-story, 1 million-square-foot office tower at 343 Madison Avenue on spec. (In late July, an anchor tenant emerged: BXP said it signed a letter of intent for an unnamed investment firm to lease 30 percent of the building.)\nIn September, SL Green went into contract to buy the former home of Brooks Brothers on Madison Avenue near Grand Central for $160 million, with the possibility of building a 800,000-square-foot office tower on the site.\nThat same month, Rithm Capital reached a deal to buy Paramount Group, which controls 9 million square feet of Class A New York office, for $1.6 billion, or $6.60 a share.\nRithm\u2019s CEO Michael Nierenberg noted his firm\u2019s own struggles to find New York City office space as a sign of the sector\u2019s recovery.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for this for a long time,\u201d Nierenberg said.\nN\new season\nEvery time a crash occurs, commentators say: This time, it\u2019s different. But the Covid-induced office crash really was different from the 2008 financial crisis, for one.\nThis time, work-from-home policies threatened the existence of office real estate, driving down values because of real changes in behavior. When the Fed started hiking rates in 2022, landlords had to consider cash-in refinancings for the first time.\nBanks backed out of the market, dealing with their own troubled loans, but debt funds and so-called alternative lenders filled the gap, offering new financing for existing landlords trying to fend off foreclosures.\n\u201cUnlike the 2008 Great Financial Crisis, there\u2019s still money available today,\u201d said Lonnie Hendry, chief product officer at Trepp. \u201cIt\u2019s just the terms that are very unfavorable.\u201d\nThese lenders allowed owners to hang on to properties, Hendry said. But the cost of their capital is still raising questions about whether the financing just postponed inevitable losses.\n\u201cYou can argue that it increases the risk across the system, that we just haven\u2019t seen it yet, or you can argue that that\u2019s been the saving grace,\u201d said Hendry. \u201cI think it\u2019s too soon to tell.\u201d\nMore lenders probably will take back properties, and more borrowers will likely suffer losses. At the same time, landlords are finally landing anchor tenants for their next towers, and new construction will start again.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a world of stress and distress, and then there\u2019s a world of recovery, and they\u2019re both unfolding at the same time,\u201d Fortress\u2019 Garfield said.",

        "content": "At 1422 Greene Avenue, tenants are paying the building\u2019s gas bill. Earlier this year, residents at 1335 Hancock Street went five months without hot water. The lock at 1339 Hancock is broken, and a metal bar holds the door open.\nThese Bushwick buildings have one trait in common: their landlord, Aron Stark.\nIn a rarity for negligent landlords, Stark spent eight days in Rikers Island in 2023 after failing to respond to the court about repairs ordered to 1422 Greene. But more than two years later, Stark hasn\u2019t cleaned up his act. Tenants say Stark has abandoned several of his properties, and many continue to rack up housing code violations, city fines and property tax bills.\nThe city put some Stark buildings into a program that lets regulators make repairs and then bill the owner, but even that hasn\u2019t had much effect on the situation, or the landlord\u2019s operations.\nSince the\n2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act\u2019s\npassage, falling property values and rising costs have surpassed income at many buildings, making major repairs financially untenable. In cases like Stark\u2019s, it can be cheaper to abandon a building than fix it.\nThe conundrum shows off the difficulty of city enforcement in a rent-stabilized market under strain. If the city does its own repairs and sends the wayward landlord the bill, that\u2019s\njust the cost of doing business\n. (That is if a landlord pays the fines; Stark, who did not reply to requests for comment, has not paid program fees in several years, according to records from the city\u2019s Department of Finance.) Even the worst the city has to offer, jail, didn\u2019t lead to reform. Meanwhile, tenants get stuck with hazardous conditions, as both the landlord and the city fall short.\nB\nugs and broken boilers\nThe saga at 1422 Greene began in 2013, when Stark tried to evict a rent-stabilized tenant. But after investigators found he had committed food stamp and Medicaid fraud, the case unraveled and Stark served a 14-month prison sentence. In 2020, while he was in prison, tenants carried out a rent strike over neglected repairs. The following year, the city\u2019s Alternative Enforcement Program took over, which meant more inspections, fees and sometimes the ability to make repairs at the landlord\u2019s expense.\nStark\u2019s\n2023 stint in jail\nstill led to no reform. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing any work,\u201d Michael Grinthal, a lawyer who represents the Greene Avenue tenants, said. When anything gets fixed, it\u2019s almost always by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, he said.\nThe property, a three-story building with white clapboard siding and 12 tenants, now has 79 open violations, of which 32 are deemed immediately hazardous. Stark also owes the city more than $140,000 in property tax and charges for emergency work, which included repairing the front door and replacing the boiler. Tenants say they still had to pay about $10,000 to keep gas running themselves.\n\u201cWe essentially run the building on our own,\u201d a representative for the 1422 Greene Avenue Tenants Association said. \u201cAny issues that come up, we deal with with our own funds or through working with the city. They\u2019re a mile wide and an inch deep, not well-funded enough to actually deliver on their missions.\u201d\n\u201cThe safety of New Yorkers is always our top priority, and through the Alternative Enforcement Program, HPD is able to conduct frequent inspections, work directly with tenants, issue violations, and, in some cases, carry out emergency repairs to quickly restore safe, stable living conditions,\u201d a spokesperson emailed.\nStark\u2019s other properties have similar problems. Three buildings on Hancock Street looked in disrepair during a recent visit. Tenants at 1335 Hancock say that Stark has abdicated. \u201cWe clean, we sweep, we take out the garbage,\u201d said a current tenant. \u201cWe do everything.\u201d The building has 77 open violations, including roach infestations, inadequate hot water and broken radiators, even though it too is in the city\u2019s Alternative Enforcement Program.\nBefore Stark stopped showing up, a tenant said that he would often barge into their apartment and take bottles of water from the refrigerator. The entryway is plastered with HPD notices of violation and unopened letters to Stark.\nNext door at 1339 Hancock, where the city now also oversees repairs, one tenant runs electricity into his apartment with an extension cord plugged into the hallway. A Con Edison notice warns service could be cut off because the landlord hasn\u2019t paid his bills. The front door hangs broken, and tenants have installed their own cameras for safety. The building has 138 open violations, 46 immediately hazardous. Across the street at 1336 Hancock, there are 139 more violations. (These are figures from mid-September, but violation count can fluctuate.)\nThe number of violations in Stark\u2019s buildings outstrips that of comparable buildings. Rent-stabilized units typically have about one or two deficiencies; even NYCHA units, long derided as some of the worst housing in New York, average 2.4. Stark\u2019s Bushwick buildings average 5.6 immediately hazardous violations or 18 overall violations per unit.\nN\no easy fix\nIn cases like Stark\u2019s, where an owner refuses to cooperate or pay bills, the city\u2019s enforcement program can fall short too. \u201c[The Alternative Enforcement Program] is about getting the landlord to clear violations, not about being a landlord,\u201d Grinthal, the tenant lawyer, said.\nThe housing department said it does try to stay involved when it is needed: \u201cWe will continue to monitor these buildings closely and use every tool available to hold the owner accountable as we work to ensure that every New Yorker has a safe, affordable place to call home,\u201d a spokesperson for HPD wrote.\nThe broader financial pressures of rent stabilization can help explain why some landlords abandon repairs. Because the 2019 law limited rent increases, many owners say they\nno longer earn\nenough to cover upkeep. Stark may be an extreme case, but he may not be as far from the average as first appears.\n\u201cIt\u2019s financial suicide to keep fixing things,\u201d Shaun Riney, a multifamily broker at Marcus &amp; Millichap, said about rent-stabilized operations. \u201cThere\u2019s no hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf someone was forcing you to show up to work every day, and not only were you not getting paid anything, but you were losing money by showing up to work every day, eventually you just lose your mind and you give up,\u201d Riney added.\nTo be sure, even among rent-stabilized landlords, most have no more than a quarter of the violations that Stark does.\nAnd, the Alternative Enforcement Program can work: More than half of the 2,630 buildings discharged from the program since its inception in 2007 were brought into compliance before the city had to issue a correction order, the HPD spokesperson said, adding that eligible owners whose buildings are in the enforcement program can apply for low-interest loans for moderate to major renovations.\nBut Stark\u2019s buildings illustrate how little difference any regulation can make when a landlord refuses to cooperate. Buildings belonging to Daniel Ohebshalom, one of the only other landlords in the city to be jailed for failing to make repairs, are also in the program, but a legal representative for Ohebshalom\u2019s tenants said that there was no marked difference on the ground before and after the buildings entered the city\u2019s purview.\n\u201cIf you asked the tenants today, they would say, \u2018We have no idea what it means to be in the AEP program,\u2019\u201d said Rebecca Whedon, a lawyer in the Tenants Rights Coalition at Legal Services NYC who represents Ohebshalom\u2019s tenants. \u201c\u2018We don\u2019t see any difference. We still feel abandoned by the city and the landlord.\u2019\u201d\nBecause buildings like Stark\u2019s have lost so much of their value since 2019, it\u2019s almost impossible to sell them. For a distressed property, especially one in the city-run enforcement program, to be sold, the price would need to be a fraction of what the owner originally paid, and \u201cit has to go through this long and painful ride of foreclosures and tax liens,\u201d Riney said.\nL\nast resort\nNew York City has one last weapon against negligent landlords: the tax lien sale.\nProperties with lots of tax owed or unpaid bills can end up on a lien sale list. If that happens, a private trust takes on the debt and charges the owner high interest. Then, if the owner doesn\u2019t pay, the trust forecloses and takes control of the property.\nUsually, the threat of a tax lien sale motivates a landlord to make repairs or pay up. If the building has a traditional bank mortgage, its lender is also paying attention because unpaid liens can wipe out the bank\u2019s collateral.\nBut Stark doesn\u2019t have a conventional lender.\nProperty records for all four buildings show that in 2019, the mortgages were sold to 189 Hart LLC, which lists its address as 156 Adar Court.\nThe LLC that owns the Hancock Street apartments has an address of 152 Adar Court, according to records of the 2007 purchase by 1335 Hancock St LLC, of which Stark is the managing member.\nBut both addresses appear to refer to the same building, a seven-bedroom house in Monsey, New York, according to Zillow. It is currently owned by Rgp Equities LLC, which bought it for $10 in 2014 from \u201cStark Ignat M.\u201d During his fraud case, Aron said the house was owned by a relative that he has never met.\nWhatever the exact relationship of Stark to his lender on these four mortgages, without a bank the usual leverage of a lien sale is weaker, with less financial pressure pushing him to make repairs or pay off debts.\nIn this case, neither owner nor lender appeared to care much about holding on to the buildings, and tax liens for all three Hancock properties were sold in June, though tenants worry a new owner might not improve conditions. At the Greene Avenue property, tenants successfully fought to keep their building off the tax lien sale list, fearing another slumlord.\nThe only other real method of enforcement in cases like Stark\u2019s is litigation. The city sued Stark, and won, in the Greene Avenue building case \u2014 but enforcing the judgment is a different ballgame. Residents are still trying to receive the damages they\u2019re owed.\nTenants \u201cdon\u2019t really see a ton of value in going back to court because they already did that and they won and it didn\u2019t bring about justice,\u201d said Grinthal, the tenant lawyer. \u201cRight now I think we\u2019re all trying to figure out what direction to go.\u201d\nAt Greene Avenue, the group of residents is hoping to form a co-op to take over ownership of the building. This is at a standstill since they say Stark won\u2019t show up to negotiate a sale. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to negotiate legally and financially when someone\u2019s not there,\u201d said the representative. \u201cHe\u2019s not shown up to a single hearing or a single milestone in the last five years.\u201d\nWhile Stark has been absent at his Bushwick properties, he hasn\u2019t fallen off the map completely and doesn\u2019t seem deterred from the real estate business. Property records show that in 2024, he purchased a multi-family building in Harlem for $6.8 million (which currently has 97 open violations).\n\u201cYou would think that someone who is so egregious would face some sort of accountability, but he\u2019s essentially living his life normally,\u201d the tenant association rep said.",

        "content": "Sam Rubin is used to working quick. Now he\u2019s working quicker.\nThe developer has four projects that qualify for 421a, New York\u2019s former tax exemption program. But a deadline is looming: June 15, 2026.\nRubin, head of Rubin Equities, is building in Mott Haven and Sunset Park, and he has eight months to finish construction. He\u2019s hiring pricier contractors to get work done fast, with more people at each job site. He estimates that he\u2019s spending about 10 percent more than he would on a typical project.\nBut missing the deadline would be even more expensive.\n\u201cThat\u2019s basically the difference between making money and not making money,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, it will take us a lot of time to recoup the investments.\u201d\nThe tax exemption expired in 2022, but last year New York lawmakers threw developers a lifeline. They passed a housing deal that gave the real estate industry five more years to complete construction and qualify their projects for the 421a program.\nBut facing political criticism, legislators\nrequired deeper affordability\nfor developments taking the extension. You can have more time, the state seemed to be saying to developers, but you won\u2019t get more flexibility.\n\u201cIf those owners are not going to\nget their act together\nright now, they\u2019re going to lose the project\u2019s value altogether,\u201d Eli Guttman, a tax abatement specialist at Metropolitan Realty Exemptions,\ntold\nThe Real Deal\nat the time, speaking about how to value 421a development sites.\nBut a year or two isn\u2019t long in the building world, and despite the extension, some smaller developers are still racing against the clock to finish their projects, hoping to be some of the last in the city to receive the implicit subsidy for building middle-income housing. Their scramble to finish isn\u2019t just about developers navigating the end of a complex tax break. It\u2019s also about the discord of a program that served many masters, pleased few of them and left a legacy of more than 100,000 units of housing in a city starved for supply.\nA\nffordable to whom?\nThe 421a program, though popular among builders, got a lot of criticism. With New York rents topping national lists, what was the use, critics asked, of subsidizing market-rate housing?\nAnd despite affordability requirements that grew with each iteration of the program, 421a was at its heart a subsidy for mixed-income and market-rate housing. Developers\u2019 favorite flavor of the program, known as Option C in the paperwork, most recently allowed them access to a 25-year tax exemption if they set aside 30 percent of units for households earning 130 percent of the area median income. Though the units were called \u201caffordable,\u201d in many places, the rent was just as expensive as the market rate.\n\u201cThere\u2019s \u2018trying\u2019 and then there\u2019s something called \u2018really trying.\u2019\u201d\nEli Guttman, tax abatement specialist\nThe income requirement was so high that developers sometimes struggled to fill the units, according to Sean Kelly, a partner and broker at Ariel Property Advisors. Applicants, who sometimes made six figures, needed to jump through bureaucratic hoops like asset checks, all to spend up to 30 percent of their income on rent.\nBut developers still flocked to the option, lured by high rents they could charge for the \u2018affordable\u2019 units. A 2022 analysis by the city comptroller\u2019s office found that 94 percent of projects in the program were pursuing that middle-income track, rather than options geared towards affordability for lower-income residents.\nThe ability to target 130 percent AMI under the \u201caffordable\u201d umbrella shifted the public\u2019s perspective towards skepticism.\n\u201cWhen New Yorkers say, \u2018Affordable to whom?\u2019 often it\u2019s a response to those 421a, 130 percent AMI units,\u201d Kim Darga, deputy commissioner of development for the city\u2019s housing arm, said at a technical briefing in August.\nE\night-month sprint\nResponding to that criticism, the state eliminated the 130 percent AMI option when it extended the construction deadline in April of last year.\nDevelopers who miss the deadline will only get the extension if they choose a different option. Most are going for Option B, which involves setting aside 10 percent of their units to target 70 percent AMI, while leaving 20 percent at the 130 option. In other words, the \u201caffordable\u201d units will bring in less rent than expected. Because market rates are unknown, it\u2019s difficult to estimate the effect this change will have on a bottom line. But if a project isn\u2019t bringing in the cash flow it predicted, refinancing can become tricky, real estate experts said.\nLosing access to the 130 option could mean a 10 to 15 percent drop in the value of a 421a project\u2019s land, said Kelly, at Ariel Property Advisors.\nJavier Martinez, head of\nArtifact Real Estate Development Company\n, is moving to finish three buildings in Upper Manhattan before the 2026 deadline. All are Option C, with the 130 percent median income threshold.\nMartinez said the projects, totaling 218 units, are in a comfortable place to meet the deadline. Although the developments would survive if they missed it, there would still be a \u201csignificant\u201d impact, he said. Rent increases at the affordable 421a units are governed by the Rent Guidelines Board while the building receives tax benefits, meaning the difference between 70 percent AMI and 130 percent will be felt for decades. And in neighborhoods like Washington Heights and Harlem, where rents are already less expensive, a developer can\u2019t necessarily hike up rents for market-rate units to make up the cash flow difference.\n\u201cIn this type of environment, where interest rates are so high and costs are so high, every little bit counts,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cIf you have projects you can\u2019t finance, then you can\u2019t go to the next one. You can\u2019t build more.\u201d\nGuttman, of Metropolitan Realty Exemptions, says developers like Rubin and Martinez are not alone in trying to save Option C for their projects. He gets calls multiple times per week from developers who are pushing their contractors and hoping to find any way around the deadline.\n\u201cThere is definitely a pressure going on on the development side to make sure to meet that deadline,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s \u2018trying\u2019 and then there\u2019s something called \u2018really trying.\u2019\u201d\nAnd the more expensive the neighborhood, the more it\u2019s worth it to try. The lower income restriction is a bigger hit to the rent roll in, say, downtown Brooklyn than in the Bronx, Guttman said.\nGuttman is working with Yitz Kaufman, COO of KS Group, on a large-scale development in Astoria. Kaufman has cut several months off the timeline for the 738-unit project, called Astoria Cove, hoping to score the 130 percent AMI option, and spending more to do it.\n\u201cThat\u2019s basically the difference between making money and not making money.\u201d\nSam Rubin, Rubin Equities\n\nHe knows that if the KS Group team doesn\u2019t make the deadline, the finances will take a hit, Kaufman said, but he doesn\u2019t know quite how much.\n\u201cHopefully that question will be hypothetical,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause hopefully we will be able to do it.\u201d\nSome back-of-the-napkin math gives a taste. Based on other developments in Astoria that have taken the middle-income track, studios for households at 130 percent of AMI list for $2,900 per month and two-bedrooms for $3,500. A resident making 70 percent AMI could pay something like $500, or even $1,000, less per month for either, according to a review of units available in the housing lottery compared to maximums set by the city. Multiplied across 10 percent of a large project, that could be a big hit, which a landlord could either absorb, or try to make up by raising rents on market-rate units.\nThat may not be make or break. Martinez and Kaufman said they are both planning to use the deadline extension for other developments, forgoing the 130 percent AMI.\n\u201cThere\u2019s obviously a financial incentive to finish earlier,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cBut the bigger financial incentive is just finishing the projects.\u201d\n\u2018\nYou either get it or you don\u2019t\u2019\nNot every developer is feeling the crunch. Big institutional players have mostly finished their 421a projects, they told\nTRD\n.\nSome other developers are working in zoning districts that have even steeper affordability requirements to build. Those players were overjoyed about the extension and unbothered by the disappearance of 130 percent AMI, since they weren\u2019t using it. That includes Charney Companies, which will have built 3,000 units under the 421a program by 2028, according to founder Sam Charney. The company is building on sites vested for 421a in recently rezoned Gowanus, where deeper affordability is required for big projects.\n\u201cIt was an unbelievable program,\u201d Charney said of 421a.\nThere were other big winners from the extension. Landowners, including those in the recently upzoned districts,\nsaw their assets jump in value\n. Suddenly, developers had the option to squeeze out the last drops of 421a before it was replaced with a less lucrative incentive program. Developers, some of whom were planning to make the original deadline, were also able to eke out some breathing room with lenders who had worried about missing the exemption entirely.\n\u201cProjects were not capable of getting financing without a certainty that they were going to be able to be completed in time,\u201d Brett Gottlieb, an attorney at Herrick, said. \u201cUntil the statute provided for the extension language, these projects were on hold. Some of them died permanently or were sold.\u201d\nBefore the deadline was announced, MAG Partners was working overtime. The development team, which builds in Manhattan, knew they could finish their projects by the 2026 deadline and access the tax exemption before it closed for good. The issue was convincing their funders. Lenders wanted assurances that projects could be completed significantly earlier.\n\u201cCapital markets and lenders really put a lot of cushion on the deadline,\u201d Jeffrey Rosen, chief investment officer at MAG Partners, said. \u201cThe end result of this is binary. You either get it or you don\u2019t.\u201d\nA\ntax exemption goes\nf\nrom rags to riches\nThe 421a program\u2019s transformation into an affordable housing program didn\u2019t happen all at once. The tax break\u2019s journey underscores New York City\u2019s transition from an emptying metropolis to arguably the most in-demand municipality in the country.\nIn the 1970s, the city hollowed out. The original 421a was a simple tax waiver for new multifamily rentals, marketed by Mayor John Lindsay as a way to spur investment. There was no affordability requirement because there was no need for one. Subsidizing middle- and upper-class taxpayers was the point.\nBut New York survived its doom loop, and by the \u201980s, development was making a comeback. Public opinion began to turn when\nDonald Trump\npushed for tens of millions of dollars in tax breaks through the program for his Fifth Avenue tower, full of luxury condos. When the program was up for one of its occasional renewals in 2006, New York\u2019s housing problem had firmly shifted from \u201cabandonment\u201d to \u201caffordability,\u201d as Michael Bloomberg put it. Critics blasted 421a for subsidizing luxury apartments in upscale neighborhoods.\nIn 2017, Mayor Bill de Blasio lobbied for all 421a buildings in the city to include affordable units. He got his wish, although with the highest-income option.\nDetractors have long focused on the program\u2019s cost, which reached $1.77 billion in foregone tax revenue in fiscal year 2022. The purported cost to the city of each affordable unit has reached more than $757,000, according to a report from the city comptroller\u2019s office.\nBut the real meaning of those numbers is complicated. Given how multifamily rental buildings are taxed in the city, most projects just don\u2019t work financially without some subsidy.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t pencil out a lot of property with full property taxes, given the construction costs and operating costs in this city,\u201d Mark Willis, a senior policy fellow at New York University\u2019s Furman Center, said.\nThe impact of the program has been so great that some real estate experts estimated there were few multifamily rental buildings constructed since the 1970s in New York that didn\u2019t have a tax exemption.\n\u201c421a is the gasoline that fuels multifamily rental construction in New York City,\u201d David Lombino of Two Trees said. \u201cWithout it, you don\u2019t have a multifamily development business in New York City.\u201d\nDevelopers have found 421a\u2019s replacement, 485x,\nuninspiring\n. \u201cBetter than nothing,\u201d as one broker described it.\nThe new program added another wrinkle to a developer\u2019s calculus: a construction wage minimum that kicks in at 100 units. The rate, $40 per hour, makes large buildings extremely difficult to pencil out, prompting many developers to target exactly 99 units.\n\u201c421a was like a very special vintage of wine,\u201d Ethan Stanton, senior managing director at JLL, said via email. \u201cThe sites we still have, whether they\u2019re under contract or on the market, are the only ones left in that case.\u201d\nUnless the wine passes its prime: Sites that have started construction under 421a but can\u2019t finish before the deadline won\u2019t be able to access 485x unless they rip up foundations and restart, according to Daniel Bernstein, an attorney at Rosenberg &amp; Estis.\nNot every developer is looking so far ahead just yet. While 421a is still here, they plan to make the most of it.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no second bite at the apple,\u201d Martinez said.",

        "content": "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac blocked the sale of a beleaguered condo complex in Pembroke Pines.\nThe companies\u2019 temporary injunction essentially halts the planned sale of Heron Pond in western Broward County that\u2019s been in the works for a year. It also puts on hold the planned distribution of proceeds to unit owners. A court-appointed receiver had determined that a sale was the best course of action due to structural safety concerns. The complex was evacuated last year.\nOn Friday, receiver Daniel Stermer designated Miami-based Integra Real Estate as the purchaser of the 25-acre complex with 19 two-story lakefront buildings at 8400 Southwest First Street. Integra had\noffered $20.5 million\nlast month for Heron Pond as the stalking horse bidder,\u00a0 setting the floor price should it have gone to auction.\nAn auction scheduled for last Thursday was canceled because no additional qualifying bids were submitted by the deadline of last Tuesday.\nUnder the current zoning, Integra \u2013\u2013 led by Nelson Stabile, Paulo Tavares de Melo, Victor Ballestas and Cory Yeffet \u2013\u2013 would be able to build a 321-unit project with one or multiple buildings up to eight stories or 100 feet tall, whichever is less.\nBut the sale process is on hold. Federal Judge Judge Rodney Smith in Fort Lauderdale on Thursday granted Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s emergency motion for a temporary restraining order. It is in effect until a scheduled hearing in front of Smith on Oct. 9.\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s argument is based on federal law that bans the sale of property that serves as collateral for a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loan without the consent of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\nFannie and Freddie hold first position liens on eight of the condos at Heron Pond, according to their motion filed on Wednesday of last week, one day before the canceled auction.\n\nIn court filings, Fannie and Freddie argue that because they are under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, any action that would impair the agency\u2019s power is banned, according to the Wednesday filing. Freddie and Fannie\u2019s motion to halt the sale is partly based on the argument that FHFA \u201cmust consent before any sale takes place,\u201d according to their court filing.\nStermer took over as\nreceiver\nlast year after Pembroke Pines city officials issued multiple notices of violations of the Florida building and fire codes at some of the buildings. Some unit owners also had alleged mismanagement by prior board members.\nPrior to Stermer\u2019s appointment, 122 units had been evacuated. Last August, all remaining units were evacuated after engineers working on repairs found additional structural deficiencies in buildings. Stermer decided to sell the property after he determined that assessments of damage and repair costs prior to his appointment were \u201csignificantly inadequate to assess the true nature, scope, and extent of the damage facing the association,\u201d he said in court filings.\nSince then, the court granted Stermer\u2019s request to terminate the condo form of governance and to proceed with the marketing and sale. In a statement,\nStermer\nwrote that the sale can\u2019t occur until the court rules or the parties resolve their issues. \u201cWe look forward to resolving the removal action and moving forward with the sale of the property as quickly as possible,\u201d Stermer said.\nIn his report to the court last month, Stermer wrote that the issue boils down to Fannie and Freddie asserting that \u201cunless they are paid in full from the sale \u2026 they will not consent to the sale.\u201d Essentially, this means that they are asking that sale proceeds designated for unit owners, including those with no mortgages on their condos, are first used to pay back Fannie and Freddie in full.\nThis will reduce \u201cthe pro rata share to be distributed to each unit owner,\u201d Stermer wrote.\nThe sale to Integra would break down to $67,434 per unit.\nRecords show one of the two Freddie mortgage loans on a Heron Pond unit is $132,000; and some of the Fannie mortgages range from the high $100,000s to over $300,000, though that\u2019s the amount lent and doesn\u2019t include how much has been paid off.\n",

Those playing in the sandbox that is South Florida\u2019s real estate market today find the signs of danger almost invisible, and talk in the region still focuses on its great performance, especially compared to the rest of the country.\nBut yellow flags that have been waving for a while are now threatening to turn red, as economic factors suggest storms. Macro indicators that include inflation, the widening wealth gap and the Trump administration\u2019s trade and immigration policies are leading to pullbacks and hesitation for some, even if it remains below the surface of the market. \u201cWhether it\u2019s on the way to recession or just weakening, I don\u2019t know,\u201d JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said of weak jobs numbers. In May, his firm\u2019s data put the probability of a recession by the end of the year at 40 percent.\nOn the\ncondo front\nin South Florida, the \u201ccuspy\u201d projects, as capital markets broker Scott Wadler describes them, are taking longer to sell. Some will be canceled, he said. At others, developers have had to kick in more equity or find partners to fill the gap.\n\u201cI have a couple of projects that are under-capitalized from an equity perspective,\u201d he added. \u201c[Developers] want too much leverage. Their rents are aggressive, and there\u2019s a lack of equity in the marketplace,\u201d Wadler, managing director of Berkadia\u2019s Miami office, said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that means that there\u2019s going to be a recession. I think that means that equity has been tough to find, and it\u2019s still tough to find.\u201d\nThe\noffice\nand\nmultifamily\nsectors have already experienced their fair share of pain, caused by high interest rates and construction costs, as well as supply outweighing demand. A number of office projects were canceled or put on hold in South Florida\u2019s urban cores, and suburban office is even weaker, as companies quashed planned expansions or halted hiring. Multifamily developers are looking to sell their sites, especially those with maturity dates looming and no other option in sight.\nRestaurants\n, a bellwether for consumer spending, have also suffered.\nH\narbingers\nProjects that sold out in better times have been delivered late or are still delayed, costing developers additional interest and frustrating buyers. Other more recently launched developments are struggling to capture enough presales.\nSome condo developers, brokerages and agents have eliminated or reduced their public relations budgets. Sales directors on new developments have seen their projects get entirely value re-engineered by their developers. This is tough news to deliver to buyers who already have contracts signed. It\u2019s also difficult to sell to new buyers.\nAnd then there are the projects that have continued to sell, but where the developer needs more capital.\nWadler described a project in Palm Beach Gardens that\u2019s under construction. The deal, he said, isn\u2019t in distress. It has the presales needed to move forward.\n\u201cMiami is not New York. It\u2019s not Paris. It\u2019s not L.A. Shit here runs different.\u201d\nFelix Bendersky, restaurant broker\n\u201cThe project is a little delayed, and it\u2019s a large project, so [the developer] needs to rebalance the deal, which is happening to a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s taking them an extra year, and on a big project with a big interest rate, you know, it could cost an extra $15, $20 million to rebalance the deal and pay extension fees.\u201d\nWadler and others insist that the majority of projects are selling and able to secure financing.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s fair or legitimate necessarily to tie that to a specific recession or market dynamic,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many projects that I\u2019m working on that are successfully obtaining financing and are oversubscribed.\u201d\nOn the office front, Swire Properties canceled its plans for One Brickell City Centre, a Class A office tower that would have some of the largest floor plates in Brickell, in January. Swire sold the site to Melo Group, which will likely build a mixed-use residential project. Smaller office projects were shelved by other developers: In September, Michael Shvo sold his office site at 1680 Alton Road in Miami Beach via a deed-in-lieu-of-foreclosure to Infinity Collective.\nMultifamily developers are also looking to move on. James Curnin\u2019s Clara Homes made a splash when it acquired a site in Wynwood that fronts the highway. Curnin secured approval for a Live Local Act apartment tower only to list the property for sale this summer. An oversupply of market rentals has put pressure on rents.\nBut locals are being squeezed out. The challenges of living and working in South Florida, including traffic, flooding and the high cost of living, have gotten worse. A majority of the population is also living in aging buildings that require significant financial investments.\n\u201cPeople are struggling to pay their rent. People who missed the window to lock in a great mortgage or to buy a house, now they\u2019re spending an inordinate amount of their income on rent, and inflation is killing everyone because a sandwich and a coffee cost $10,\u201d Wadler said.\nA number of experts have sounded the alarm on the widening wealth gap that\u2019s bifurcating the market.\n\u201cThe \u2018haves,\u2019 they have fixed-rate debt, and they were just lucky, and they\u2019re in the right place. And there are businesses that are flourishing,\u201d Wadler said. Including his. \u201cThe real estate capital markets [sector] is very active right now. I would make a general statement to say that a lot of brokers, maybe not on the sales side, but the capital markets financing brokers, year-over-year, all did better.\u201d\n\nThe \u201clarger economic reality\u201d might be evident in restaurant closures, according to Ben Wolkov, an attorney who\u2019s managing partner at Miami-based Caldera Law. Caldera\u2019s clients include the ever-successful Sunny\u2019s Steakhouse in Miami\u2019s Little River.\nBut unlike Sunny\u2019s, which continues to do well, dozens of restaurants closed over the summer, typically the hardest and slowest season for the industry. The closures include RedFarm, an upscale Chinese restaurant from New York that was open in Coconut Grove for only a year, and Miami Beach staple Sardinia, which was in the community for two decades.\nWolkov called it a \u201cperfect storm.\u201d Though some have pulled off major success, restaurants in general are also dealing with high costs of food and insurance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the return of seasonality overlaid with macroeconomic and other factors unique to this particular summer,\u201d he said. \u201cFrame that against cash flow practices. For some restaurants, that\u2019s been a fatal blow.\u201d\nRestaurant owners also suffer from another Miami-specific problem that costs residential and commercial developers time and money they sometimes don\u2019t have: an especially lengthy permit process.\n\u201cMiami is not New York. It\u2019s not Paris. It\u2019s not L.A. Shit here runs different,\u201d restaurant broker Felix Bendersky said on a recent episode of his podcast. \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t know how to navigate, there\u2019s a good chance that they\u2019re going to be closed before they open. Just because it works somewhere else, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to work in Miami.\u201d\nM\nore than hope\nThe red flags shouldn\u2019t be misinterpreted as a sure disaster. Despite the potential of a downturn, a number of residential projects are moving forward simply because demand still exists. New residents continue to move to the state, and the region\u2019s retail and industrial markets paint a picture of a region still outperforming other major U.S. metros.\nAnd money still pours in.\nThe massive wave of wealth that moved into South Florida as a result of the pandemic has fundamentally altered the region\u2019s demographics. Billionaires, including South Florida natives Ken Griffin and Steve Ross, as well as international retail magnate Amancio Ortega, have dropped hundreds of millions of dollars on real estate and the local economies. Griffin relocated his hedge fund and sister financial firm, Citadel and Citadel Securities, from Chicago to Miami.\nGriffin has contributed more than $300 million since 2022, and he recently announced a $50 million gift to Success Academy, a New York City charter school network, at a joint press conference with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\nOrtega, the third wealthiest person in the world, has been growing his real estate portfolio. In recent months, his family office Ponte Gadea paid about $110 million for Atlas Plaza, an anchor property in Miami\u2019s Design District that\u2019s home to Michael Schwartz\u2019s Michael\u2019s Genuine Food &amp; Drink, one of the longest operating restaurants in the neighborhood.\nPonte Gadea is under contract to buy Sabadell Financial Center, a 30-story office tower in Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood, for $275 million.\nA drove of multimillionaires has followed the billionaires. If the wealth migration has slowed, it certainly hasn\u2019t stopped.\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nrecent reduction in interest rates\nis floating the real estate world.\nBH Group\u2019s Isaac Toledano, a developer who\u2019s partnered with condo juggernaut the Related Group, Dezer Development, Kolter Group and others, said he\u2019s more optimistic now than he was a year ago, after the election put a lot of buyers, sellers and developers on hold. Even once activity picked up after the election, it slowed again because of President Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nToledano is bullish on 2026, across sectors.\nMost agree that the local real estate market won\u2019t experience the lowest lows of 2008. Although it\u2019s been difficult to secure financing, a number of condo, mixed-use and multifamily developers have closed on significant loans.\nCommercial leases also continue to be signed. For many of the restaurants that do close, a new tenant is ready to come in and take the space.\n\u201cNext year, you\u2019re going to be able to borrow money at about 5 percent. I think a lot of buyers sitting on the sidelines will start to be more active,\u201d Toledano said. \u201cRemember, everyone thought what we saw during Covid was going to last forever. Things usually change.\u201d",

        "content": "When one of south Miami-Dade County\u2019s sprawling suburbs ends, the landscape changes. Streets of master-planned communities level off into a vast expanse of open land and row crops that stretch into the horizon for a mile and a half, west toward Krome Avenue and Everglades National Park.\nThis is where, on a nearly 1,000-acre tract, homebuilding giant Lennar wants to build a mega-subdivision: homes, jobs, schools and entertainment.\nIn business-friendly Miami-Dade, government officials for years have catered to developers in an ongoing bid for new towers, complexes and homes. With real estate a major economic driver and tax base for the county, developers rarely hear no from electeds and sometimes\nget help\nto work around difficult sites and zonings.\nBut even Miami-Dade has its limits. The site Lennar  wants to develop,\nCity Park\nis outside what\u2019s known as the Urban Development Boundary. Past the line, development is strictly banned. This summer Lennar filed its application for 7,800 homes and 2.4 million square feet of commercial space.\nConstruction beyond the limit may be impossible, but as it turns out, the boundary itself is movable, if a developer can pass county and state administrative reviews, secure a supermajority commission vote and survive a potential mayoral veto, all while environmentalists lobby against the annexation of farmland and wetlands, which creep closer to protected national parks.\nIt isn\u2019t the first to embark on this quest. A pair of developers won approval to move the line in 2022 \u2014 following five public hearings where they capitulated to commissioners\u2019 many demands and halved their project size. But their plan was quashed in court, a warning that even hard-won victories can collapse before the end.\nBut if Lennar figures it out, City Park would be the single largest proposed project in the area and solidify its remaking of south Miami-Dade. It might also indicate a new upper limit of what developers can pull off here.\nThe Miami-Dade-based homebuilding giant has honed a machine-like business strategy of \u201cstarts, sales, deliveries\u201d that\u2019s made it the country\u2019s second-largest homebuilder \u2014 and the dominant force in this corner of the county. Since 2020, Lennar has delivered 8,430 single-family houses and townhomes in south Miami-Dade, nearly 70 percent of all such units built in that period, according to Colliers Research. Currently, it\u2019s building 840 more homes in the area. That accounts for almost 60 percent of the housing stock under construction.\nEven without taking the 7,800 residential units of City Park into account, Lennar plans nearly half of the proposed south Miami-Dade units, or 3,569 out of the 7,682 total, the Colliers data shows.\n\u201cThey are by far dominant,\u201d\nEd Easton\n, founder of Miami-based\nEaston Group\nand partner in City Park, said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question.\u201d\nNow, slowing sales and dropping prices, as well as stubbornly elevated construction costs and interest rates, have many pulling back from south Miami-Dade. Yet, Lennar, which also is experiencing a decline in sales and revenue from its nationwide portfolio, is only pressing on.\nH\nome base\nDuring South Florida\u2019s housing boom of the past five years, fueled by an influx of out-of-staters, builders raced south. Far from the construction cranes in Miami\u2019s booming Brickell and Edgewater neighborhoods, Coral Gables\u2019 Mediterranean Revival buildings and Pinecrest\u2019s manicured lawns, south Miami-Dade has one thing those areas don\u2019t: cheap land.\nLennar has been developing in the area, which consists of the municipalities of Homestead and Florida City, as well as unincorporated county neighborhoods such as Leisure City, Naranja, Princeton, Goulds, Redland and South Miami Heights, since at least the early 2000s.\nBut it ramped up recently. From 2020 to last year, Lennar completed the Siena Reserve community with roughly 1,200 single-family and townhomes spanning across Goulds and Princeton, according to property records. From 2019 to 2022, it completed the Campo Bello community with about 500 homes near Princeton; and from 2021 to last year, it finished Caple Farms North with over 200 homes near Cutler Bay.\nThe Simpsons-esque subdivisions are easy to spot, with their brand-new streets of cookie-cutter houses \u2014 three or four bedrooms, up to 2,000 square feet, selling in the $400,000-to-$600,000 range. Here, working families can have their own backyard and community amenities like pools and gyms.\nThe late Leonard Miller, a Miami-Dade landowner, sowed the seeds for Lennar\u2019s start here in the 1950s when he leveraged his land and $10,000 to partner with Arnold Rosen\u2019s F&amp;R Builders. By 1971, the pair had renamed the company to Lennar and taken it public. Over the decades, Lennar grew not just through its efficient homebuilding but also by acquiring existing homebuilders, giving it a nationwide foothold, and expanding its business lines into mortgage lending, title and insurance services, as well as a LenX proptech arm during the smart homes craze in 2018. The company\u2019s mantra is \u201cevolve or die,\u201d Stuart Miller, Leonard Miller\u2019s son, famously said. The younger Miller took the helm of Lennar in 1997 and leads the firm as co-CEO with Jon Jaffe. Leonard Miller died in 2002.\n\u201cBy having [developable land] on someone else\u2019s balance sheet, you are freeing your cash flow to do whatever you do best. Lennar is best at being very efficient in building again and again and again.\u201d\nEli Beracha, professor of real estate and finance at Florida International University\nLennar also seized on down markets, spinning off distressed commercial mortgage investment arms LNR and\nRialto Capital\n, eventually divesting its majority stake in both. It also launched multifamily division Quarterra, which it still owns.\nIn Miami-Dade, the Miller family has a reputation as top benefactors, with Stuart and his siblings, Leslie and Jeffrey, continuing their parents\u2019 legacy, including for homeless and medical research causes. (University of Miami\u2019s medical school was named for Leonard Miller, following a historic $100 million gift from the family in 2004.)\nFor all its scale, Lennar has kept a low profile. Unlike many Miami builders who spotlight every project milestone, Lennar rarely trumpets its projects beyond email blasts about planned or completed communities. The company declined to make a representative available for this story and generally hasn\u2019t responded to sporadic The Real Deal inquiries over the past couple of years regarding projects. Not all the press is good: Allegations of shoddy construction have been the most persistent blemish on Lennar\u2019s reputation, especially after Category 5 Hurricane Andrew pummeled south Miami-Dade in 1992 and homeowners alleged poor construction that failed to meet the state code. The homebuilder settled homeowners\u2019 class action suit for $2.4 million, denying any wrongdoing.\nLennar\u2019s move on south Miami-Dade also doesn\u2019t seem to have been explicitly announced or addressed, publicly or internally.\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever recall having that specific discussion, saying, \u2018Hey, we are going to target south Dade,\u201d Anthony Seijas, a former regional VP at Lennar in the early 2000s, said. \u201cIt started building communities in Homestead when I was there. It just became a natural progression [to] where there\u2019s land to build master-planned communities.\u201d\nAmid the rush on south Miami-Dade, development sites large enough for master-planned communities dwindled, leaving one area as the obvious place for Lennar to turn to: outside the UDB. The 990-acre site where City Park is proposed is \u201cadjacent to the Urban Development Boundary, making it the natural next place for growth,\u201d a project spokesperson said.\nIn the meantime, Lennar had done smaller projects within the UDB: In Redland, a proposed 97 homes; in the Goulds area, a project of 138 homes and another nearby with 54 homes; and in South Miami Heights, a complex with 24 single-family homes.\nH\now to build a resi empire\nBut Lennar\u2019s residential empire in south Miami-Dade rests less on bricks and mortar than on savvy land tactics. The builder has locked in developable sites for years ahead, cementing its near-monopoly and its main role in the future of the area\u2019s housing market.\nTake the palm nursery in Princeton, a half mile from the development boundary.The homebuilder doesn\u2019t own the land for a planned development where Lennar wants to build\n257 homes\n.\nYet, in a move typical for the firm, Lennar knows it can have the land when it wants it. In June, TPG Angelo Gordon paid $30.2 million for the property, not to own it, but rather to hold it for Lennar until it\u2019s ready to build, records show.\nAs such, TPG Angelo Gordon, a private equity firm, acts as a land bank for Lennar, purchasing, holding and preparing sites for construction until Lennar is ready to buy the plots and start building. Lennar\u2019s other land bank partners include New York-based JEN Partners, which paid\n$19.6 million\nfor a 19-acre site planned for 302 homes in Princeton; and Scottsdale, Arizona-based Garrett Development, which paid\n$20.4 million\nfor the 39-acre Florida City site where Lennar is now developing Le Jardine townhouse complex with 527 homes.\nIn the biggest nod to its strategy, Lennar this year\nspun off Millrose Properties,\nits own publicly traded land bank that enables the homebuilders\u2019 land-light strategy. Lennar put $5.5 billion worth of its land holdings and $1 billion in cash into Millrose. Through Millrose, Lennar already has expanded its south Miami-Dade development site stockpile.\nIn essence, Lennar outsources land ownership \u2014 the riskiest part of its empire building.\n\u201cBy having [developable land] on someone else\u2019s balance sheet, you are freeing your cash flow to do whatever you do best. Lennar is best at being very efficient in building again and again and again,\u201d Eli Beracha, a professor of real estate and finance at Florida International University, said.\nThe math is simple but powerful: Homebuilders pay a 15 percent to 20 percent deposit of the cost to land banks to get homesites ready for development. They also sign agreements to purchase the land. If it costs $100,000 to get 50 lots ready for development, a homebuilder working without a land bank ties up $5 million upfront just for the site preparation. But if the homebuilder uses a land bank, it would only pay $1 million to the land bank to get the lots ready (20 percent of the total cost) and then will have the rest of its capital free for construction, a land bank expert explained.\nFor Lennar, it\u2019s as much about efficiency as it is about optics. Because its land is off its books and sits with land banks, its financials look leaner to shareholders and its stock price isn\u2019t weighed down by non-income producing assets, Frank Schnidman, a retired economic development and urban planning professor at Florida Atlantic University, explained.\n\u201cThey are basically playing a shell game to move the property around to best benefit their balance sheet,\u201d he said.\n\nThe land, and Lennar\u2019s obligation to buy it from land banks, isn\u2019t hidden from shareholders, just less obvious, Beracha said.\n\u201cOf course it is a little bit less transparent of what is not on the balance sheet, so the shareholders need to be a little bit more sophisticated and realize \u2026 they [Lennar] have a separate liability,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a common practice.\u201d\nSouth Florida homebuilders generally focus on specific areas, in a way unofficially divvying up the tri-county region among themselves. While Kolter, Pulte and Kenco are primarily in parts of Palm Beach County, south Miami-Dade has long been the turf for Lennar and, for a long time, Arlington, Texas-based D.R. Horton.\nAlthough many south Miami-Dade market watchers call both Lennar and D.R. Horton the area\u2019s top players, data show D.R. Horton trailing Lennar by far. D.R. Horton completed 16 percent of the pipeline in the past half decade, and is responsible for 23 percent of the under-construction and proposed pipeline, the Colliers data shows.\n\u201cLennar is on the march,\u201d one south Miami-Dade tropical fruit farmer said, declining to be identified because he has a pending offer on his land from Lennar. \u201cD.R. Horton was around a lot but they have backed way off. They [Lennar] are gobbling up land everywhere you turn. There\u2019s not a person down there with land in the right area that they haven\u2019t run an offer by.\u201d\nMany south Miami-Dade farmers and nursery owners, with land holdings both inside and outside the UDB, aren\u2019t too keen to sell to Lennar, he said: Farmers want to be farmers. But sometimes, the economics of farming forces them to enter sale agreements with homebuilders.\nLandowners and residents are often against pushing the UDB, the tropical fruit farmer said. People there just \u201clike the low density.\u201d\nOne local landowner and developer cautioned his peers against entering sale agreements with any homebuilders.\nThe landowners are often locked into agreements and prices years before the homebuilder closes the deal, and by the time the builder buys, values may have soared \u2014 yet the farmer is bound to the old price, according Lewis Swezy, a south Miami-Dade landowner and affordable housing developer.\n\u201cA lot of these people aren\u2019t sophisticated sellers and they lock them in,\u201d Swezy said.\nB\noundary politics\nSometime in the 1980s, Easton, Lennar\u2019s partner in City Park, suggested to Leonard Miller that they purchase the land outside the boundary as a long-term investment. During the subsequent years, they assembled it in clumps, according to Easton.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t really talk about developing it at the time,\u201d Easton said.\nIn 2007, Lennar and Easton first filed a proposed project on the site, at the time called Parkland, with nearly 7,000 homes, a hospital and medical offices, retail, schools, warehouses and parks. By 2008, the project fizzled out after Miami-Dade administrators recommended denial, and the developers asked for a deferral of a commission vote, county records show. A City Park spokesperson cited the onset of the Great Financial Crisis.\nThe new City Park is a refreshed redesign of Parkland, a project spokesperson said.\nIt would consist of the 144-acre Village Core with shops, restaurants, a plaza and boardwalk; retail and offices; civic spaces; schools for up to 3,800 students and 250 acres of parks, lakes, a community farm and trails. The industrial space will include last-mile distribution centers and potentially support expected aerospace growth at nearby Miami Executive Airport.\nLennar and its project partners, Easton and homebuilding consultant Bill Albers, are in the early stages of approvals, a process that could drag into next year. Following their pre-application in July, they will file a formal application in the coming weeks, the project spokesperson said. Then, they will meet with commissioners, environmental groups, community members and other stakeholders, and will potentially fine-tune the proposal. Commissioners will vote several times, first on whether to transmit the application to the state.\nContention over the project is typical for Miami-Dade: build housing for the growing population or preserve remaining farmland.\nProponents say City Park would be a self-sustaining community and alleviate demand for attainably priced homes, especially for locals priced out of other areas. There would be 4,500 townhomes and 2,200 multifamily/live-work units, and 1,000 single-family homes. About 12.5 percent will be at workforce price or rents, which includes more than 300 affordable units.\nClose to 30,000 county residents are leaving annually, according to Jeffrey Bercow, a land use attorney for the City Park developers, often because they\u2019re priced out. Others make long commutes from affordable suburbs. City Park could be a place for people to work, as well as live, the project spokesperson underscores.\nSkeptics aren\u2019t convinced. \u201cIt would be a huge, huge mistake\u201d Miami-Dade Commissioner Roberto Gonzalez, whose district includes the City Park site, said, adding the planned office space isn\u2019t \u201cenough\u201d to create an employment hub. \u201cWhat we need is something that can alleviate traffic. Not more homes.\u201d\nThe project would continue a decadeslong practice of poor urban planning in Miami-Dade where homes are on one side of the county and jobs and entertainment on the other, causing traffic congestion, Gonzalez added. Developers also should consider land in the Urban Expansion Area, or the area that\u2019s designated for construction first before building elsewhere outside the UDB, Gonzalez said.\nMany south Miami-Dade farmers and nursery owners aren\u2019t too keen to sell to Lennar \u2026 farmers want to be farmers. But sometimes, the economics of farming forces them to enter sale agreements with homebuilders.\n\u201cOur internal rules make clear that we should not build outside that line [UDB] unless there is a need. There is no need,\u201d added Commissioner Danielle Cohen Higgins.\nSome environmentalists and preservationists argue that infill development, or building on developable sites on the right side of the UDB, is the best way to meet the housing needs of a growing population.\nThe county has land for about 230,000 residential units \u2014 with about 10 percent of that suitable for single-family homes and the rest for rentals, townhouses and condos. That\u2019s not enough, Bercow said.\n\u201cThe demand for single-family homes is pretty steady at about 5,500 units per year,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd with a 23,000 [single-family home] capacity, you are out in five years.\u201d\nThe would-be City Park site has no wetlands or other environmentally sensitive lands. Still, redeveloping it could destroy \u201cvaluable productive agriculture \u2026 battering\u201d Miami-Dade\u2019s endangered farming economy, according to Hold the Line, a longtime coalition of environmental groups that opposes most expansions beyond the boundary. A joint county-University of Florida 2023 study recommended keeping the UDB intact to preserve agricultural land.\nCurrently, the City Park land is leased for row crops and isn\u2019t part of the tropical fruit and nursery farms that the UF study listed \u201cas most critical to protect,\u201d a project spokesperson said.\nS\nhaky ground\nFor all the building, the south part of the county is still \u201cless tested\u201d of an area, broker Sebastian Faerman said. \u201cYou speak with new developers coming from outside Florida and they don\u2019t know it.\u201d\nWhen the real estate market slowed in recent months, some developers who had tried south Miami-Dade during the boom listed their sites for sale, walking back on their southbound exploration, Faerman said.\nHow much demand there is for homes in south Miami-Dade is also an open question, as the area is devoid from employment and entertainment hubs. Yet, because homebuilders can purchase land for cheap, they also can offer more attainable prices, providing residents priced out of most of Miami-Dade an alternative to leaving the county.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult choice for working families. They either buy an affordable single-family home in a community in south Dade and then drive for an hour or two to their workplace, or they move into a rental or a condominium multifamily project, which doesn\u2019t give them the same kind of amenities and space and community feeling they want,\u201d Bercow, the attorney, said.\n\u201cOr they move out of Miami-Dade County.\u201d\nIn the third quarter, Lennar reported a 9 percent drop in home sale revenues nationwide, as well as a drop in the average home sale price. As the top south Miami-Dade developer, the firm is most exposed to a slowdown in the local housing market. Yet if anyone can weather a downturn, it\u2019s Lennar, onlookers say, pointing to the Great Recession.\n\u201cThis is home base for them, so they understand this market probably better than anybody,\u201d David Burstyn, a Miami-Dade affordable housing developer and investor, said. \u201cStuart Miller is an industry genius.

        "content": "For Martin Melo, a principal with\nMelo Group\n, a Miami-based development and general contracting firm, the past year signaled a winding down of the city\u2019s most recent development boom.\n\u201cI think we are at the end of the cycle for projects that began shortly after the pandemic,\u201d Melo told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cThere is still a lot of inventory being built in the [condo and apartment] sectors, but the market seems much calmer.\u201d\nIndeed, the sprint to add more buildings to the Magic City\u2019s skyline has turned into a jog, according to an analysis of city of Miami active permits by\nTRD\n. Data show that general contractors held 1,697 active permits valued at about $3.7 billion from August 2022 through August 2025. Zoomed out over a longer stretch, it\u2019s clear the pace is slowing. Between 2019 and 2024, the same analysis showed that general contractors pulled 87,228 permits in Miami, with a total project cost of\n$14.9 billion\n.\nLast year\u2019s top performing firm, Winchester, Massachusetts-based John Moriarty &amp; Associates, saw its output diminish considerably. In the three-year period between 2022 and 2025, John Moriarty had total project costs of $340.2 million through 65 permits. Between 2019 and 2024, the firm had $1.1 billion in total project costs through 129 permits. As a result, Moriarty dropped to third place in the most recent ranking.\nMiami-based Coastal Construction, with a total of $858 million in project costs and 48 active permits between 2022 and 2025, clocked in with the highest dollar amount for a general contracting firm in the city. Melo Group grabbed the second spot among most active general contracting firms with a total of $380.5 million in project costs based on 25 active permits.\nMarket conditions and rising costs will make it tougher for projects that have not broken ground, according to Melo. \u201cYou are still seeing a lot of cranes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut next year, it\u2019s going back to a normal pace of construction.\u201d\nMelo\u2019s sentiment is shared by other construction industry experts. Uncertainty and volatility created by the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs and immigration crackdown is causing friction between developers, contractors and subcontractors over how much price increases can be blamed on the White House\u2019s agenda.\nPassing the buck\nTariffs on imported materials have become a persistent issue reshaping construction costs and contracts in Miami and nationally. Recent U.S. trade policies have significantly increased the cost of critical construction materials.\nSteel and aluminum imports saw tariffs jump from 25 percent to 50 percent this year, with additional baseline tariffs applied broadly across other imported goods. Experts estimate material import tariffs affecting construction have surged to an effective rate near 28 percent, potentially rising higher depending on trade negotiations and retaliatory tariffs.\nYet, general contractors and subcontractors are not seeing eye-to-eye on the root cause of the price increases, noted Tom C. Murphy, Coastal Construction\u2019s co-president.\n\u201cI think we are at the end of the cycle for projects that began shortly after the pandemic.\u201d\nmartin melo, melo group\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen an increase in materials and pricing from subcontractors,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much of it is related to tariffs. The potential or idea that there could be some market volatility will make people a little bit more aggressive in their fee structure.\u201d\nCoastal\u2019s projects include St. Regis Brickell, a 50-story condominium with 152 units; a 70-story mixed-use high-rise with a combined 789 condos and apartments at Miami Worldcenter by Nafali Group; and 2600 Biscayne, another mixed-use tower with multifamily and retail by Oak Row Equities in Edgewater.\nMelo told\nTRD\nthat his firm has seen cost jumps for a small segment of construction materials, like the price of faucets and elevator parts increasing by 10 percent to 20 percent. Yet, the cost of concrete has remained stable, he said.\n\nDisagreements over tariffs are also influencing negotiations between general contractors and developers, said Elizabeth \u201cLiz\u201d Coppolecchia, a construction lawyer and partner at Coral Gables-based law firm Weiss Serota.\n\u201cContractors want protection in contracts against unexpected tariff increases, while developers seek to limit their liability after signing agreements,\u201d Coppolecchia said. \u201cTariff provisions have become standard negotiation points in contracts here.\u201d\nLabored labor\nMiami\u2019s labor market within the construction sector remains under pressure from several factors, including ongoing immigration enforcement actions. Earlier this year, federal immigration raids and crackdowns created uncertainty for many contractors, especially in markets in Florida that rely on immigrant workers.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to take a political stance on this, but immigration has obviously affected this to some extent,\u201d Coppolecchia said, noting the construction labor pool has been in decline since before the second Trump administration.\n\u201cThis has been kind of progressing since the Covid days,\u201d she said. \u201cContractors are having a harder time getting the amount of manpower that they need for these massive developments.\u201d\nStill, Murphy and Melo said they have not dealt with any firsthand labor disruptions with their projects.\n\u201cWe were blessed not to have experienced anything of any real significance,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cReally, we heard about what was happening through word of mouth. It\u2019s really tough to pinpoint what the impact has been where some of the actual raids have occurred.\u201d\nMelo echoed Murphy\u2019s assessment: \u201cI can\u2019t speak for subcontractors, but we haven\u2019t felt any impact.\u201d\nRisk assessment\nAs the next development cycle begins, general contractors are concerned about a glut of projects that may not get shovels in the dirt.\n\u201cI think contractors would probably worry that developers are biting off more than they can chew,\u201d Coppolecchia said. \u201cI think developers are pushing for schedules that are a little tough to meet and may not necessarily reap the benefits that they\u2019re expecting.\u201d\nMiami\u2019s boom has also created a pool of new players thinking they can easily get into the development game and make money, added Coastal\u2019s Murphy.\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about the influx of unsophisticated and inexperienced teams and individuals that want to get into the real estate industry,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThey overpay for a property, start to develop plans only to find out that the project doesn\u2019t make real sense. You wind up with a hyper-market where everyone raises their prices, and then the bottom falls out.\u201d\nAccess the comprehensive data set supporting this ranking\nhere\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.",

        "content": "It\u2019s hard to say when exactly fortunes turned, but real estate players agree: Much of Miami-Dade County is in a buyer\u2019s market.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a buyer\u2019s market up to $2 million, $3 million bucks,\u201d Duff Rubin, Coldwell Banker\u2019s regional president for the Southeast, said. \u201cYou see a lot of stale inventory, and there\u2019s a lot of overpriced listings.\u201d\nBut above $3 million, and even more categorically above $10 million, the situation is different.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a story of contrasts,\u201d Corcoran Group\u2019s Pam Liebman said. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing a very, very strong uber-luxury market in Miami. Then you see other parts of the market where sales volume dropped by 40 percent.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a tale of two markets in a year marked by economic uncertainty and international conflict. South Florida faces high insurance costs, diminishing affordability and an\naging condo\ncrisis brought on by post-Surfside regulation.\nFor years, Miami\u2019s real estate brokers insisted that the Magic City was impervious to the obstacles kneecapping the national housing market. While the rest of the country\u2019s residential markets faltered, Miami persevered, racking up record sales and attracting billionaire transplants. A waterfront estate in Bay Point sold for\na record $85.2 million\nin November. Spec developer Todd Glaser and his partners dropped\n$105 million\non a waterfront North Bay Road estate they plan to flip for $169 million. They have a more ambitious plan they\u2019re also working on: Build a spec mansion they would sell for $300 million.\nThe luxury market\u2019s consistent growth means dollar volume is rising even as sales slow.\nThe top 20 brokerages in Miami-Dade County closed nearly $19 billion in on-market sales in the 12-month period ending in August, according to The Real Deal\u2019s analysis. The top 25 agent teams sold about $6.4 billion in on-market sales in that time, up from $5.4 billion in\nlast year\u2019s ranking\n.\nResi\u2019s kingmakers\nThe tops of the rankings for both firms and agents is crowded with familiar faces. Compass nabbed the top spot for brokerages with $3.7 billion in sales. Douglas Elliman, Coldwell Banker, One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty and Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM (BHHS EWM) Realty followed in second, third, fourth and fifth place, respectively.\nThe Jills Zeder Group, which includes Jill Eber, Jill Hertzberg and Judy Zeder at Coldwell Banker, once again clinched first place with nearly $1.4 billion in sales. Chad Carroll\u2019s Carroll Group with Compass placed second with $544.9 million. Elliman\u2019s\nDina Goldentayer\ntook third with $460.2 million in sales. Dora Puig, broker and owner of Luxe Living Realty landed in fourth place, closing $362.4 million. Nelson Gonzalez, of BHHS EWM, rocketed up to fifth with $347.8 million in sales, after falling off the ranking last year.\nThe Brokerage South Florida Real Estate\u2019s Joel Lusky is among the few, like Jordan Karp and the late\nDarin Tansey\n, who have joined the ranks of top agents in Miami-Dade in recent years. Lusky\u2019s top two deals over the past year include the record $20.7 million sale of a waterfront mansion in North Miami in August and the $23 million sale of a waterfront home in Bal Harbour a year earlier. Both were just outside of\nTRD\n\u2019s research parameters.\n\u201cNow buyers are more conscious of who they hire, their credentials. There\u2019s more loyalty.\u201d\nChad Carroll, Compass\nLusky said his strategy is to play nice with the competition.\n\u201cI have excellent relationships with every top agent in the business. That definitely has helped a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a relationship business, not only with clients, but with agents as well.\u201d\nTansey, a longtime Elliman agent who died this summer, made\nTRD\n\u2019s ranking for the first time due to his success at the Ritz-Carlton Residences, Miami Beach, where he lived. Lynna Weil, his executive assistant who is taking over much of Tansey\u2019s business, pointed to a burst of activity this summer at the Ritz.\nNoticeably absent from the list is\nOren Alexander\n, who led the Side-backed brokerage\nOfficial\nand placed eighth last year with $185 million in sales. Alexander, along with his brothers Tal and Alon, is in jail on federal sex trafficking charges and is set to face trial starting in January. He recently\ntapped the \u201cdream team\u201d\nof attorneys who represented Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs in his sex trafficking case.\nOren\u2019s exit from the market has created some opportunities for competitors to pick up his business, some said.\nIndustry shakeups\nShifts in market performance and the agent food chain were not the only elements resi players had to navigate.\nAgents and brokerages also had to adapt to the changes brought by the class action litigation that culminated in the National Association of Realtors reaching a $418 million settlement last year.\nUnder the agreement, buy-side agents are now required to sign buyer-broker agreements with their clients, a mandate some resisted. Many say it can stunt the client relationship by forcing an awkward conversation about compensation.\n\u201cI do see a lot of agents fighting for additional commission when it\u2019s not being offered, and trying to get it from the seller,\u201d said Compass\u2019 top agent, Chad Carroll.\nBut\nbuyer-broker agreements\nended up benefiting his business, he said. \u201cNow buyers are more conscious of who they hire, their credentials. There\u2019s more loyalty.\u201d\nGeorge CancioBello, the owner of Lifestyle International Realty, said the new rules have been a positive for the industry.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a great thing for the industry because now there\u2019s more transparency,\u201d he said. \u201cIt brought more professionalism to the business.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not all easy. Compass agent Nancy Batchelor said the NAR changes make it difficult to \u201cjust spontaneously run and show your listing.\u201d Some sellers are also unwilling to pay a standard commission.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen more discounts on the buyer\u2019s side,\u201d she said. Batchelor referred to a deal in South Miami where her buyers really wanted the property and the seller was paying a much lower fee. \u201cWe had to eat that and it was a very difficult sale.\u201d\nOwnership is also shifting the business. Zillow and Compass have been waging a battle over private listings. In September, Compass announced plans to acquire Anywhere Real Estate for $1.6 billion. The merger is set to close next year and will bring five of Miami-Dade County\u2019s top brokerages under the Compass umbrella. This includes Compass\u2019 fiercest rival in Miami-Dade, Coldwell Banker.\nIt may demand a shift in brokerage strategy from leaders who were more focused on treading water in a challenging market, even if they knew that growth was the path to profitability for traditional brokerages.\n\u201cWe are not of the mindset that larger is better,\u201d Elliman\u2019s Florida CEO Jay Parker said in an interview not long before the announcement. \u201cWe continue to make our primary focus our agent retention and agent success.\u201d\nBut this gargantuan merger may signal that growth is now truly necessary to compete, appraiser Jonathan Miller noted in his weekly newsletter, Housing Notes.\n\u201cThis merger provides a stern warning to all the boutique brokerage firms that they need to align with a large firm to keep up with Compass in terms of offerings to new agents,\u201d he wrote.\nTrump slump\nIn the weeks after Donald Trump\u2019s November presidential victory, exuberant buyers rushed to snap up homes in luxury enclaves in what was dubbed \u201cthe Trump bump.\u201d\nIn Miami Beach, there were 12 closings of $10 million or more in December 2024 and January 2025, compared to just one during those months a year earlier. Dollar volume followed suit, totaling $220 million, compared to just $16.5 million a year earlier, according to data compiled by Miller.\n\u201cMomentum at the end of \u201924 was really good,\u201d Liebman remembered. But market confidence wobbled in the weeks after Trump took office, and it nosedived in April when the president announced his tariff policy on \u201cLiberation Day.\u201d\nSpring, typically a busy time for real estate agents, was quiet.\n\u201cLiberation Day and trade wars aren\u2019t what we had on our bingo card,\u201d said Nathan Zeder, part of Coldwell Banker\u2019s Jills Zeder Group.\nAs markets shook off the shock of tariff policies over the summer, buyer confidence rebounded.\nCorcoran\u2019s top agent, Julian Johnston, said that he and his team were busy from December to February, but work quieted down in March and April. By the end of June, \u201cI was slammed,\u201d he said.\nWaterfront land in Miami Beach became more in demand, as inventory of turnkey homes remained low.\n\u201cThere are trophy properties still being bought by billionaires,\u201d Johnston said.\nGoldentayer said she sold $160 million worth of homes in a 40-day period this summer.\n\u201cI sold a house that was just a concrete shell for $70 million,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the location and view are perfect, buyers are willing to do the work.\u201d\nOne Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent Michael Martinez was among the agents who said uncertainty surrounding the transition of power, tariffs and other issues pushed a lot of sales activity to the summer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been the most active summer since 2020,\u201d Martinez said.\nMartinez said buyers continue to hail from the Northeast, West Coast and\nLatin America\n. Inventory is on the rise in his markets, and, as expected, \u201cthe houses that need more updating are the ones with higher days on market,\u201d Martinez said.\nMost top agents are looking ahead to New York City\u2019s mayoral election in November, banking on more wealthy New Yorkers relocating to South Florida in the likely event that\nZohran Mamdani wins\n. It\u2019s part of what they think will help fuel the winter season.\n\u201cWe always get an influx of New Yorkers, but the conversation with New Yorkers is especially high-tuned [right now],\u201d said Nathan Zeder.\nA good season could send a wider signal about the market.\n\u201cDevelopers are back in the game. I am starting to see more international clients,\u201d Puig noted. And now that Trump\u2019s been in office for about 10 months, \u201cpeople know what to expect in the next three years. Big money comes out to play.\u201d\nAccess data and contact information from the brokerage ranking\nhere\nand the broker ranking\nhere\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.",

        "content": "Robert Rivani, a commercial real estate maverick who bolted Los Angeles for Miami, recently arranged his latest coup: Playboy is moving its Hollywood headquarters to The Rivani, his newly rebranded, seven-story mixed-use project in Miami Beach.\nRivani started out as a sneakerhead and sold his collection for $150,000 as a teen. Even today, he\u2019s unconventional, sporting a gelled mohawk and chest-length beard while doing deals like a Wall Street rainmaker.\nHis approach: Don\u2019t wait for opportunity. Rivani\u2019s habit of outbidding rivals and closing fast has upended Miami\u2019s luxury hospitality sector including its restaurant scene, where he has landed trophy tenants like Delilah, Gekko, Catch and RosaNegra Miami in recent years. Now, the $40 million makeover of his building at\n1691 Washington Avenue\nwill host Playboy\u2019s 250-employee operation in a sprawling penthouse suite, courtesy of a 10-year lease and a promise to revive the faded luster of an iconic brand \u2014 so long as the company\ngets an $800,000 city incentive\nfor its headquarters relocation. The renovation is slated to finish in April 2026.\nThe Real Deal\nsat down\nwith Rivani\nat his Miami home to talk about changing his firm\u2019s name from Black Lion to Rivani, his latest projects, his outspoken persona on social media and in real life, becoming a father and why he is so bullish about Miami hospitality.\nThe interviews have been condensed and edited for clarity.\nBorn\n: April 3, 1990\nHometown\n: Los Angeles\nLives\n: Morningside, Miami\nFamily\n: Wife Krystal and son Ragna\nHow did you land Playboy as the penthouse tenant for The Rivani office project in Miami Beach?\nThey were looking at sites all over South Florida, especially in Miami Beach. When they saw the vision, hospitality and amenities that are coming with our building, it was just a perfect, harmonious match.\nYou\u2019ve coined the term Class X to describe The Rivani. What does that mean?\nI would never let anybody [describe]\nan office building\nof this caliber being Class A. So it\u2019s called Class X.\nWhat are some of the interior details that would give people a sense of why you\u2019re spending $100 million to renovate this building?\nWell, it\u2019s $100 million total [including the $63 million purchase price]. We\u2019re spending about $40 million in improvements. For example, valet for me is really important. We\u2019re the only office building in Miami Beach with a [covered driveway]. We\u2019re spending $5 million just on that. Our reception desks are almost $100,000 each because they are literally carved out of a mountain. And we have a speakeasy lounge where every VIP gets their own liquor cabinet. You can call ahead, \u201cPlease have my bottle of Scotch and four glasses ready for me and my clients.\u201d [Landlords will spend] $125 a square foot for average Class A office space. We\u2019re spending almost $300 a square foot.\n\u201cI\u2019m completely and utterly micromanaging.\u201d\nSo does that mean you\u2019re going to charge Class X office rents?\nI will have to break some records.\nAre you micromanaging or delegating the build-out?\nI\u2019m completely and utterly micromanaging. I\u2019m involved in every detail down to the carpet finishes, the handles of the kitchen cabinets, the toilets and the faucets.\nDoes The Rivani currently have tenants besides Playboy?\nWe are 85 percent occupied. For example, we already have a pretty robust tenant pool including Apple, Morgan Stanley, Raymond James, Williams Sonoma, Coldwell Banker, The Jills and The Peebles Corporation. We don\u2019t just want to let in anybody who wants to lease space. It\u2019s important to curate the right crowd.\nWhy did you decide to do this type of project in Miami Beach?\nI love Miami Beach. It\u2019s had a rough patch the past couple of years. But with the influx of wealth and all the high-net-worth individuals that are choosing to live on Venetian Island, Star Island, Palm Island and North Bay Road, an office building right there is overly convenient for those high-net-worth individuals, which is more of our target market.\nIn the last year or so, you\u2019ve sold a large chunk of your\nrestaurant space\nportfolio. How come?\nI don\u2019t raise money. I don\u2019t have outside investors. Any time I buy and sell a deal, it\u2019s my own money, so I need the capital in order to move on to the next project.\nWhy don\u2019t you like having business partners?\nI\u2019m a very unique character when it comes to my concepts and my ideas. I\u2019m sure you, just like everybody else, thought I was an absolute psychopath buying every single ground-floor vacant retail space that nobody can do anything with. And I have these weird, quirky ideas that I think will come to fruition, and I\u2019ve blown my own money to bet on it.\nIn 2023, you sold \u201cRivani Castle,\u201d your Los Angeles estate inspired by \u201cHarry Potter\u201dand \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d including a replica of the Iron Throne, for $20 million. What happened to the contents of the house?\nThe \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d stuff is coming to my office headquarters. The throne is going to be front and center.\nDo you have any plans to create a new castle in Miami?\nI wish that land wasn\u2019t so goddamn expensive. We had 2.5 acres in L.A. and it was a 15,000-square-foot home. It\u2019s almost impossible to replicate that in Miami.\nYou have a big social media presence, and you talk to the media. Why do you feel comfortable being front and center?\nIt\u2019s important for people to understand the vision, creativity and hard work of what you\u2019re doing. I want people to see that I want to help the businesses that we sign up. I want to help promote Playboy and all these new restaurants that open up in the city. And I like to speak my mind. I think a lot of people in real estate are scared to have their voice because they\u2019re getting money from outside investors. As soon as they do something that an outside investor doesn\u2019t want, they\u2019re going to slap their wrist or pull their investment or do something to control them.\nBut is social media engagement a strategy for you?\nFor sure. Instead of going on my website like a typical developer, you go to my Instagram and look at all the things I\u2019ve done and what I\u2019m about. People want to follow a person much more than follow a brand. I feel like I\u2019m the guy out of left field. Like, \u201cwho the hell is this guy with the mohawk and the beard?\u201d I was like, \u201cI\u2019m gonna play into that more.\u201d\nWhen did you get the mohawk and beard?\nIt happened during [the pandemic] because I couldn\u2019t get a barber when everything was shut down. My wife asked me if I wanted her to cut my hair. She shaved the sides of my head and I just slicked the top of my hair. Then I just let the beard grow out and ended up looking like the\nBlack Lion\nlogo. At the time, I didn\u2019t have public social media accounts.\nDo you spend a lot of time and money grooming?\nMy wife still cuts my hair from time to time. I use oils [on my beard] every single day. I gel my hair a few times a week. The problem is with gel in Miami is the heat is fucking nuts. You got all the stuff streaking down the sides of your head.\n\nYou and Krystal recently had your first child: a son, Ragna. For how long did you both want kids?\nWe always wanted children since we met, but I made it clear in the beginning [of the relationship] that my first child is my career. Once we moved to Miami, we decided to have fun for a few years and then it was time to have a kid. Our little guy was born eight months ago, and that has completely changed my life.\nI\u2019ve seen pictures of him. He\u2019s got a mohawk. Is he your mini-me?\nYes, he\u2019s mini-me. But he\u2019ll never be in commercial or any type of real estate.\nHow come? Most real estate tycoons set up a line of succession\n.\nBecause of the amount of pain and suffering that I had to go through to get [Ragna] to where he is financially set. He shouldn\u2019t have to work in an industry because I mandate him to do it. One reason my company was called Black Lion is because I was the black sheep of my family. [My parents] wanted me to be a doctor or an attorney, I don\u2019t want to force somebody\u2019s direction in their life.\nHow many siblings do you have, and did they become what your parents wanted?\nI have two siblings. They\u2019re in another world in another place where they follow Mommy\u2019s and Daddy\u2019s footsteps. I decided to get up and get out.\nYou refer to your little family as the Meatballs. How come?\nWe just call [Ragna] a meatball because he\u2019s super chunky.\nWhat\u2019s been your biggest surprise about being a father?\nThe biggest surprise is that all the things I thought were so important really aren\u2019t. We almost lost him during the first two months of his life. It made me realize that any other problem in life is absolutely not [a problem].\nWhere do you get your fashion sense?\nMy wife would say it\u2019s her. I would say that it is a blend of just being myself and wanting to stand out, even though I\u2019m more shy than you can actually imagine.\nHow many custom-made lion T-shirts do you have?\nI think 20, give or take.\nHow many sneakers did you have when you sold the collection for $150,000?\n200-plus. All stacked up everywhere in my house.\nWhat\u2019s the most expensive pair of sneakers that you have today?\nNothing crazy. I\u2019m more into watches now than I am into shoes. Rolex, Roger Dubuis and Hublot. But I am not going to spend half a million dollars to get a Richard Mille watch just because someone says it\u2019s a fashion statement.\nAre you still your wife\u2019s patient zero when it comes out to trying new foods and health and wellness trends?\nFor sure.\nWhat\u2019s a food that you recently tried for the first time?\nPassionfruit. It\u2019s fucking great. I\u2019ve had it in like nasty drinks, but not fresh by itself.\nDo you still make your own sushi?\nOh yeah. We\u2019re opening a sushi concept with Alvaro Perez, the chef behind [Miami restaurant] Ogawa. I will be one of the sushi chefs. It\u2019s a hobby for me.\nWhen did you start making sushi?\nAbout six, seven years ago. I go to Japan every [year]. It\u2019s my favorite place in the world.\nDo you like cooking, preparing meals in general?\nAbsolutely not. Sushi is as far as I\u2019ll go.\nWorking with your wife, how do you guys make it work?\nIt works great. She brings a feminine touch that I don\u2019t have. She\u2019ll do all the little intimate and delicate features that make [a space] really special. She also busts my chops.\nAnother thing you don\u2019t have a problem with is sharing your political views and where you stand on issues. How come?\nWhere do you think I stand on politics?\nWell, I know you\u2019re anti-Gavin Newsom and anti-Karen Bass.\nI\u2019m anti-craziness. I\u2019m not left, and I\u2019m not right. I\u2019m a very down-the-middle guy. If I do have a voice on social media or publicly, and I think that there\u2019s something wrong going on, if I don\u2019t speak up and say something, who\u2019s going to? It\u2019s been proven now that the politics of California and New York have caused this mass migration to Florida. It\u2019s because of their actions. And if those actions spread to Miami, then what\u2019s next? Miami is the last frontier. If Miami goes to shit or South Florida goes to shit, where are we all going to move to?\nHave your political views hurt you professionally?\nFrom a business side of things, I think most people love and appreciate what I\u2019m doing for South Florida. I do get hate mail and crazy direct messages. I\u2019ve talked about Jewish things and protecting Israel. I\u2019ve gotten messages like, \u201cI wish Adolf Hitler finished the job with your family and burned your bodies.\u201d",

        "content": "That\u2019s encouraging,\u201d Amalfi Estates\u2019 Anthony Marguleas murmured as he peered out the window of his coffee beige Porsche to get a look at a school bus on Sunset Boulevard.\nWhat would hardly warrant a second glance elsewhere was cause for optimism given that eight months ago the major thoroughfare\u2014one of only three ways in and out of the Palisades\u2014was gridlocked. Residents sat in traffic as they sought to escape January\u2019s Palisades Fire, with many abandoning vehicles that were later bulldozed to clear the road.\nDriving through the Palisades is different now.\nThe community, which Marguleas estimated saw about 5,900 homes\ndamaged or destroyed\nby the fire, has had debris cleared from most lots as the wood frames of new construction begin to emerge.\nMarguleas, who has run the Palisades-based residential brokerage Amalfi Estates for 31 years, and his wife Sue managed to evacuate unharmed, but their Alphabet Streets home was destroyed like so many others. The PTSD is real, he said.\nIt\u2019s like a moment in time, like Pompeii with the volcano.\u201d\nAnthony Marguleas, Amalfi Estates\nSince January, Marguleas\u2019 attention has crisscrossed\nland listings and sales\n(he\u2019s sold or is in escrow on 28 deals in the past eight-and-a-half months), educating owners and buyers (40 percent of land deals are falling out of escrow due to lack of understanding around financing or construction), consulting with builders, launching the 1Pali community-building group and dispelling misinformation flooding the market.\n\u201cI just want to help the community rebuild,\u201d Marguleas said.\nIt\u2019s a simple sentiment lost in the political tension circling the rebuild and one that leaves Marguleas biting back tears.\n\u201cOur goal is to bring everyone home. It may sound kitschy, but it\u2019s true,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the gist of what we\u2019re doing and why we\u2019re doing it.\u201d\nMarguleas spent a Monday in September with The Real Deal driving through the Palisades for a view from the ground of a community building back.\n1\n0:00 a.m.\nMarguleas pulls up to\n1186 Corsica Drive\nin the Riviera neighborhood.\nIt\u2019s the former home of late actor and comedian Dom DeLuise, which hit the market in August with a $21 million ask. About 150 people came through the broker caravan and the first Sunday of the open house.\n\u201cOpen houses as we know it are almost non-existent in the fire area,\u201d Marguleas said, but noting some exceptions such as the Riviera and Huntington neighborhoods. \u201cOpen houses are when we typically see other agents. That\u2019s when you find out about new listings. That\u2019s when you get to network with your sphere. And we lost that ability. Our job has changed quite a bit from selling houses to being a community leader.\u201d\n1\n1:21 a.m.\nAfter an extensive chat on the state of the residential real estate market, Marguleas heads onto Sunset Boulevard for the Alphabet Streets: \u201cWe also call it ground zero.\u201d\nIt was one of the hardest hit areas. Today, most lots are cleared and signs on some tout Thomas James Homes, Ram Miller Construction and residential brokerages.\nSeveral builders are now renting vacant parcels to store their equipment and Marguleas has helped broker a few of those deals.\n1\n1:50 a.m.\nMarguleas passes his home, which is blocked from street view by a wrap.\n\u201cThis is my lot here on the right. We just got building permit approval, so we\u2019re going to be starting construction. This one\u2019s closing escrow tomorrow. It\u2019s my neighbor\u2019s. You still see the Christmas lights. It\u2019s just weird. We\u2019re in September. It\u2019s like a moment in time, like Pompeii with the volcano.\u201d\n1\n1:51 a.m.\nJust a few seconds away, he stops at 915 Kagawa Street.\n\u201cThat\u2019s Thomas James. That\u2019s the model home. That\u2019s going to be the first home developed and they\u2019ll finish it by Thanksgiving. See how many homes are going up here? Every week, it\u2019s more and more.\u201d\nHe parks along the curb and walks in through the home\u2019s garage, talking to the site supervisor and taking a tour.\n\n1\n2:03 p.m.\nMarguleas continues his drive through the Alphabet Streets, which are named after Methodist ministers and laid out in a grid alphabetically.\n\u201cThere were wealthy people here, but the Palisades was also made up of a lot of retirees. Twenty-five percent of the Palisades locals are over 65. They bought their homes 30, 40 years ago for dirt cheap and it just happened to appreciate a lot. There were retired teachers and nurses. It wasn\u2019t like Bel-Air or Beverly Hills. People were very down to earth. In the Palisades, there\u2019s a great shirt that people would wear that said, \u2018If you\u2019re rich, you live in Beverly Hills. If you\u2019re famous, you live in Malibu. If you\u2019re lucky, you live in Pacific Palisades.\u2019\u201d\n12:04 p.m.\nThe Alphabet\u2019s Embury Street is adjacent to developer\nRick Caruso\u2019s\nPalisades Village\nshopping center. Barricades around the perimeter block public access as Marguleas drives past.\n\u201cRick Caruso has been fantastic at merging the public and the private partnerships. He started [non-profit] Steadfast LA as a way to do that.\u201d\nMarguleas pointed to Archistar as an example. He credited Caruso with pushing for the artificial intelligence-based software at the local and state level to help with expediting permitting times.\n1\n2:06 p.m.\nLunch at Palisades Garden Caf\u00e9 is a burger and Coke as Marguleas chats with Kevin Niles from the American Legion Post 283\u2019s executive committee. They catch up on recent openings, including CVS on Aug. 25.\nDuring lunch is when Marguleas opens up about\nMeasure ULA\nand its implications for the Palisades.\n\u201cWhoever marketed that was brilliant. They called it a mansion tax. Half the people affected were commercial, these big buildings in Downtown L.A. It was a $5 million lot in the Palisades. That\u2019s not a mansion.\u201d\nThere\u2019s also the day-to-day reality of businesses reopening, but not enough residents to serve: \u201cThat\u2019s the chicken and egg: They open a restaurant and there\u2019s not enough people living here or workers.\u201d\n1\n2:56 p.m.\nBack in the car, he motions to a stretch of Sunset Boulevard between Pacific Coast Highway and Temescal Canyon Road that\u2019s become part of the density debate.\n\u201cThe concern is multifamily; it\u2019s not the single-family. If you own a house in the Alphabet Streets and you find out the person next door to you is building four units, and the person on the other side is building four units, you\u2019re going to be in an uproar. But if you find out someone on Sunset\u2019s building higher density, \u2018It\u2019s not near me.\u2019\u201d\nCentral to the tussle is Senate Bill 79, which lawmakers passed in September. It\u2019s aimed at encouraging multifamily development near transit stops. As of press time, the bill was awaiting Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s signature.\n1\n:08 p.m.\nMarguleas wants to stop at Temescal Canyon Road, which reopened in August.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been down here since the fires,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s night and day.\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began using the road Feb. 23 to do recycling of concrete and metals from burned properties. Excavators, magnetic claws, conveyer belts and trucks filled the street. Today it\u2019s empty and quiet as a few cars pass.\nFrom there, he swings back through the center of town to get to the Huntington, one of the pricier neighborhoods and relatively untouched by the fires.\nThen it\u2019s a peek at Will Rogers State Park, which is closed to the public temporarily as the state works to restore the property. He passes the polo field, a husk of itself after the fire consumed it along with the historic ranch house and other buildings.\nFor Marguleas, everything is glass half full as he and his wife prepare to return to the Palisades and begin their own rebuild.\n\u201cWe\u2019re planning on moving back in about a month,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to rent a place because we miss the Palisades.\u201d",

        "content": "Beverly Hills Estates co-founder and CEO Rayni Williams was talking about Measure United to House L.A., better known as ULA or the mansion tax, when she paused to check her demeanor.\n\u201cSorry if I\u2019m shouting,\u201d Williams said, a bit sheepishly.\nThe tax has weighed on Williams and others in real estate for more than two years. Aimed at raising funds to prevent homelessness and add more affordable housing to the market, critics say it\u2019s done nothing but cast a pall over dealmaking.\n\u201cULA is the biggest detriment to the market right now. More than interest rates. More than world events,\u201d said Williams, whose Beverly Hills Estates team rose to the No. 1 spot on The Real Deal\u2019s list of L.A. County\u2019s top agents and teams.\n\u201cIt is an additional 5.5 percent [on sales of $10.6 million or more] on top of escrow fees and commissions,\u201d Williams said. The basis of the tax is price, not profit, which she finds especially irksome.\n\u201cYou are paying a tax that has no forbearance. In other words, you could still be losing money on your property. You could be upside down on your property and you are still paying a mansion tax that, by the way, nobody even knows where the money\u2019s going.\u201d\nEven with the headwind, L.A.\u2019s top agents managed to close $9.7 billion in deals.\n\u201cSorry if I\u2019m shouting.\u201d\nBeverly Hills Estates co-founder and CEO Rayni Williams, who got worked up talking about Measure ULA\nThe Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Williams &amp; Williams Estates Group swiped the No. 1 spot from the Aaron Kirman Group on this year\u2019s\nranking of the top 25 agents and teams\nin Los Angeles County. The team made the jump from second place last year by closing almost $1.3 billion in sales volume across 197 transactions.\nTRD analyzed the buy and sell sides of properties in the Multiple Listing Service between July 1, 2024, and July 1, 2025, for this year\u2019s\nranking\n. The list does not count deals of less than $1 million or off-market transactions, the latter of which would considerably alter the ranking\u2019s makeup.\nWilliams &amp; Williams enjoys a comfortable margin that sets it apart from No. 2\u2019s Aaron Kirman Group, which had about $891 million in volume across 221 transactions. Carolwood Estates\u2019 Bond Street Partners jumped up five spaces to No. 3 with 64 deals tallying to $635.8 million. Bond Street founders David Parnes and James Harris\nannounced their split\nas business partners in September, although both remain at the brokerage.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s The Altman Brothers Team stayed put at No. 4, closing on nearly $591.7 million in volume across 88 deals. Meanwhile,\nWestside Estate Agency\u2019s\nKurt Rappaport closed out the top five with 19 deals for the July-to-July period, coming out to about $568 million or nearly $30 million per transaction.\nMarket paralysis\nSome agents say they could have closed on more were it not for Measure ULA.\nThe Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Jack Harris and Michael Fahimian, who entered the list for the first time at No. 20, can attest to that.\n\nThe duo had been working on a recent deal for nearly two months, but it ultimately fell apart. They ended up renting the home instead of selling it.\n\u201cThe seller was not netting enough due to the 4 percent ULA tax, and we couldn\u2019t bridge the gap between the buyer and seller,\u201d Harris said. \u201c[The seller] would have lost money due to that 4 percent.\u201d\nHarris and Fahimian sold 18 homes in the ranking research period, which penciled out to $200.8 million.\nVoters passed Measure ULA, which applies only to property transactions within the city of Los Angeles, in November 2022. The thresholds change annually, with the current tax set at 4 percent for transactions of $5.3 million and 5.5 percent for those $10.6 million or more.\nCritics say that Measure ULA lacks guardrails and exclusions, akin to carveouts with the capital gains tax, that take specifics into account, like speculative developments selling at a loss or properties in the Pacific Palisades affected by the wildfires earlier this year. Instead, some in the industry argue Measure ULA punishes properties that sit on expensive dirt but are far from mansions.\nCarolwood\u2019s Linda May reported that in the over-$10 million range, the gap created by the tax crumbled her ability to close. May, who has one of the highest average prices per transaction on this year\u2019s ranking at $20.6 million per deal, rose two slots to No. 19 with 10 trades totaling $205.6 million.\n\u201cIn one case, both sides agreed on price, but once the tax was factored in, the seller wasn\u2019t willing to absorb it, and the buyer wasn\u2019t willing to increase their number,\u201d she said. \u201cIn others, negotiations dragged out much longer as both parties tried to rework terms around the tax.\u201d\nLast step\nIf acceptance is the final stage in the grieving process, parts of the market have arrived at that point in varying gradations.\n\u201cBuyers have factored it into their offers, but sellers are still struggling to accept the hit to their net,\u201d May said. \u201cUnless someone has a real reason to sell, many are holding off, which keeps inventory tight and the market stagnant.\u201d\nThere have been several starts and stops on attempts to modify or strike down the tax.\n\u201cThere were all these glimmers of hope that maybe it was going to go away, but now I feel like generally people accept and acknowledge that it\u2019s there,\u201d David Berg of Compass\u2019 Smith &amp; Berg Partners team said. The team counted 90 deals totaling $454.9 million in volume during the ranking period to sit at No. 8.\nLawsuits came hot and heavy after the tax\u2019s passage, with the most notable one lobbed by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association in December 2022.\nThe group, along with the California Business Roundtable, sponsored the Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act, which was removed from the November 2024 ballot after a California Supreme Court ruling dubbed it an all-out revision to the state constitution. It was a broad-based initiative that included invalidating Measure ULA.\nFor the real estate industry, the latest bright spot was\nSenate Bill 423\n, which carved out for apartment and other commercial buildings built in the past 15 years a transfer tax of no more than 1.5 percent within the city of L.A. Single-family homes built within the past five years on property destroyed by a disaster deemed a local emergency would have also seen a similar reduced transfer tax. However, that bill was pulled in September.\nAccess data and contact information from this ranking\nher\ne\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.",

        "content": "Victor Sigoura\u2019s Legion Investment Group\nis moving quickly on a coveted West Chelsea development site.\nThe latest piece of the puzzle: a $155 million construction loan from Eldridge Real Estate Credit, the real estate investing arm of Eldridge Capital Management.\nSigoura, who is partnering with AVRS Partners on the project at 550 West 21st Street, bought the site out of bankruptcy just a year and a half ago\nfor $87 million\n.\nExpected to be finished in mid-2027, the 23-story project will offer 83 condos. Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group has been tapped to lead sales, which are expected to launch next year.\nLocated from Chelsea Piers and overlooking the West Side Highway, Sigoura in a statement called the site \u201cthe last major waterfront development site in West Chelsea of this scale and quality.\u201d\nUri Chaitchik\u2019s Casco Development bought the plot in 2014 for just $5 million than Sigoura paid. Chaitchik had planned a 20-story condo project with a $539 million sellout price, but had to seek Chapter 11 protection after financing failed to materialize.\n\nSigoura purchased the land with a $56 million loan from Deutsche Bank.\nThe construction loan comes at a fortuitous time.\nDemand for downtown properties\non the city\u2019s west side has been fierce, and there\u2019s a scarcity of new condos filling the need. Witkoff Group and Access Industries\u2019 One High Line, which occupies a similar spot along the highway just a few blocks south, has been one of the\nbest-selling condo projects in the last year\n, passing $1 billion in sales at the end of 2024.\nMeanwhile there are\nno downtown condo projects over 100 units\nexpected to launch sales next year, according to data from Corcoran Sunshine. Atlas Capital and Zeckendorf Development\u2019s 80 Clarkson, which has 112 units and also sits right off the West Side Highway further south, launched sale this past spring but has yet to publicly report any contracts.\nSigoura has been wheeling and dealing elsewhere in Manhattan in recent years. Legion and its partner, Gindi Capital, in February closed on the\nfinal two properties in a six-parcel assemblage\non Third Avenue and East 21st Street, where they\u2019re planning a 20-story condo project, the largest development on Gramercy Park in a century.\nLast year, the Legion and EJS Development bought a Greenwich Village development site at 5 West 13th Street for $57.5 million. Legion also scored a $195 million construction loan from Deutsche Bank and JVP Management for its 26-unit luxury condo building at 1122 Madison Avenue, which began vertical construction this summer.\n",

        "content": "The Chicago Bears\u2019 vision for a $5 billion stadium-anchored campus in Arlington Heights could deliver a revenue windfall for the northwest suburb \u2014 but only if the math holds up.\nTwo economic impact studies released Tuesday show the NFL team\u2019s proposed mixed-use redevelopment at the former Arlington International Racecourse would generate at least $15 million annually for village coffers, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The development, slated for more than 1,100 residential units, a hotel, office space and retail, could yield $510 million in tax revenue for the village over four decades.\nBut officials in Arlington Heights cautioned that the rosy revenue picture doesn\u2019t yet account for the steep price of public infrastructure upgrades \u2014 as much as $855 million \u2014 needed to support the project.\nThe reports, prepared by Bears consultant HR&amp;A Advisors and vetted by the village\u2019s own adviser Hunden Strategic Partners, highlight expected gains from sales, amusement, hotel and food and beverage taxes. The Bears\u2019 analysis goes further, projecting $18 million a year for the village, $38 million for the state and $12 million for Cook County, plus 9,000 jobs across Illinois. Neighboring suburbs such as Rolling Meadows are already\nprimed\nto cash in on redevelopment projects to siphon off some of the economic activity should the project go forward.\nEven so, local leaders stressed that the project won\u2019t move forward without a net fiscal benefit. Arlington Heights Mayor Jim Tinaglia said in a statement that the findings show great potential, while noting ongoing studies of traffic, transportation and municipal service costs.\n\nAt the statehouse, the numbers haven\u2019t yet swayed\nlawmakers\n. House Speaker Emanuel \u201cChris\u201d Welch told a crowd in Arlington Heights Tuesday he\u2019s unsure whether a pending megaproject bill \u2014 legislation that would let developers negotiate decades-long property tax deals with local authorities \u2014 has the votes to pass, the Daily Herald\nreported\n. The measure, backed by the Bears and organized labor, doesn\u2019t mention the team but would clear the path for its proposed tax break.\nDemocrats hold a supermajority in the House, but Welch said he won\u2019t bring the bill to the floor without clear support, especially from Chicago\u2019s 26 legislators. Gov. J.B. Pritzker has signaled openness to the megaproject concept but reiterated the team must first pay off $534 million still owed for\nSoldier Field\u2019s 2003 renovation\n.\nThe Bears, who earlier this month said they are committed to pursuing the Arlington Heights site over a competing South Loop option, are\nbetting\ntheir stadium could deliver Super Bowls and other mega-events \u2014 the type of splash that suburban officials may welcome but that Chicago power brokers are reluctant to subsidize.\nThe question for Arlington Heights is whether the promise of increased revenue and regional prestige outweighs the risks of footing the bill for the infrastructure needed to make it work. In a statement on the village\u2019s website, officials made clear they will not approve the project \u201cunless there is a net fiscal benefit \u2014 meaning the village\u2019s new revenues must exceed new expenses.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "In Doral, the vacancy rate is up to 6.5 percent, and rents have hit a three-year low.\nYes,\nthe Miami market is cooling\n, but Doral is facing more than just a slowdown. About 40 percent of\nDoral\u2019s\n80,000 residents were born in Venezuela or have Venezuelan heritage, and these families are fleeing President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, the\nWall Street Journal\nreports.\nIn some Doral buildings, vacancy rates are reaching 10 percent or more as residents contend with uncertain immigration status, according to the Journal. Many Venezuelans are living in the U.S. with temporary legal status, the result of programs like humanitarian parole and Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which were expanded under the Biden administration.\nSince taking office in January, the\nTrump\nadministration has sought to revoke these permissions, launching a bevy of legal actions in recent months and leaving more than 1 million people in immigration status limbo.\nLeasing agents have a close-up view of how this uncertainty is playing out in Doral.\n\u201cThey\u2019re all telling me, \u2018No, I can\u2019t stay, my [temporary status] is expiring,\u201d Maria Eugenia Nucete, a Venezuelan-American broker, told the publication. She has worked in Doral for decades. In March, she lost a Venezuelan client who relocated to Italy.\nChristi Fraga, the mayor of Doral, said she\u2019s seen the exodus as well.\n\n\u201cI do personally know of some families that have self-deported. Their status was unsure and they didn\u2019t want to be here illegally,\u201d she told the Journal. \u201cI\u2019m sure it will affect the housing market to a certain extent.\u201d\nSelf-deporting residents often have plans to move to Spain or Italy, or return to Venezuela, according to the Journal. Gabriela Hernandez, a 26-year-old Venezuelan who has lived in the U.S. for nearly a decade, has been living with her boyfriend in a one-bedroom apartment. Her boyfriend, fearing the loss of his protected status, has already left Doral, and she has plans to depart in the coming weeks.\n\u201cAll of our plans here have collapsed,\u201d she told the publication. They plan to emigrate to Spain.\nFlighty tenants represent a new risk to building owners. Doral landlords now say they want to know immigration status before renting, and some are turning away potential tenants with temporary status, unwilling to face a rent delinquency if a court ruling strips their legal residency. But lawyers say these denials could amount to a violation of the Fair Housing Act.\n\u201cIt could be viewed as a race-discrimination case or it could be viewed as a case involving allegations of discrimination based upon national origin,\u201d Miami-based attorney Courtney Cunningham told the Journal.\nWhile Doral now faces a contracting rental market, it has attracted millions of dollars in investment in recent years, including from the Trump family. In January, the Doral City Council greenlit the Trump Organization\u2019s plan to develop up to\n1,500 luxury condos\non the Trump National Doral Miami property.\n\u2013\u2013\nKate Hinsche",

        "content": "It pays to be on the water.\nOr so it goes in Brooklyn, which in the third quarter hit a record price per square foot of $1,490 for closed sponsor sales, according to data by Brown Harris Stevens Development Marketing.\nDriving the price climb are two dueling waterfront projects that launched sales within five months of each other last year,\nNaftali Group\u2019s Williamsburg Wharf\nand\nTwo Trees\u2019 One Domino Square\n.\nIn the last 12 months, they have been the two top-selling developments in the city, according to Marketproof, combining for over 110 contracts. Both buildings have an average closed price per square foot of over $2,000, making for the kind of large-scale, ultra-luxury cocktail that can push prices up throughout the borough.\nThe developments in Brooklyn have been \u201ccoming into their age of luxury,\u201d according to BHSDM\u2019s Jason Thomas, citing One Domino Square and Williamsburg Wharf as projects with \u201clarger-scale, higher-end finishes, [and] bigger amenities.\u201d\nIn total, Brooklyn notched 247 new development contracts in the third quarter, roughly flat with the borough\u2019s 10-year average. The contract dollar volume of $435 million was 18 percent above the 10-year average.\nOne Domino Square, where an in-house team led by Aaron Goed is running sales, topped the borough with 18 contracts last quarter.\n\nManhattan has\nnot had the same ultra-desirable large projects\nlaunch that can juice contract numbers, even with buyer demand.\n\u201cWhen supply becomes constrained and people can\u2019t get what they want \u2026 a lot of times they just go to the sidelines and they just say, \u2018I\u2019ll wait it out,\u2019 Thomas said.\nAt the end of the third quarter, Manhattan counted just under 4,000 new development condos available to purchase, leaving it roughly 25 percent under its 10-year supply average, according to data from BHSDM.\nFacing slim pickings, buyers signed just an estimated 298 new development contracts last quarter, down 15 percent from the 10-year average. The contract counts adjust for the 650,000-square-foot elephant in the borough, 80 Clarkson, which has yet to report a contract, and for 125 Greenwich, which batch-reported 20 contracts in the third quarter.\nManhattan\u2019s top-selling building last quarter was Magnum Real Estate Group\u2019s La Maison Collette at 815 Broadway in Greenwich Village, which netted 18 contracts since launching sales in July. A Serhant New Development team led by Andrew Appell, David Fernandez and Irina Balueva are leading sales.\nDespite the borough\u2019s constrained supply, the average closed price per square foot was relatively flat at $2,095.\nThere are no quick fixes on the horizon for Manhattan. A levelling off of land prices will help, according to BHSDM president Stephen Kliegerman. But, \u201cwe don\u2019t see the supply situation turning around basically until the next decade,\u201d he said.\n",

FDNY officials said the collapse appeared limited to the structure\u2019s exterior corner, though the Department of Buildings is still assessing whether apartments were compromised.\nDebris piled high at the base of the property, where bricks, air conditioners and rubble blanketed the sidewalk, sparking several complaints about excessive debris. FDNY drones surveyed the damage, while two NYPD K-9s combed the wreckage. There were no signs of anyone trapped and by late morning, city officials confirmed there were no fatalities or injuries.\nThe Department of Buildings established a collapse zone around the site and demolition crews are expected to dismantle what\u2019s left of the chimney before restoring utilities. Con Edison cut gas service.\nThe Mitchel Houses already carried a partial stop-work order from June 25, per DOB records. There was also a plumbing/license complaint in June and a stuck elevator complaint last March. The building has six active violations with penalties due of $31,000, according to DOB records.\n\nResidents described the chaos of the evacuation.\n\u201cIt sounded like a bomb,\u201d one man told Eyewitness News. Another said families rushed out barefoot, carrying children into the cold.\nIn a statement, NYCHA said that \u201can investigation is underway to determine the cause of this event and the extent of any damage beyond the reported exterior damage to the chimney.\u201d\nMore than 3,400 people live in the Mitchel Houses, which date back to 1966. Tenants along the F and G lines were temporarily relocated to a nearby community center.\nThe incident adds another safety black eye for NYCHA, which has been frequently chided with tenant complaints and capital repair needs.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A waterfront office tower in Emeryville just sold at a significant discount.\nLBA Realty\npurchased the 2100 Powell Street building from CBRE Investment Management for $72.5 million, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The building rises 16 stories and contains 350,000 square feet of offices.\nThe approximately $200-per-square-foot sale price represents a 57.6 percent drop, or $98.4 million, from the $170.9 million that CBRE Investment Management paid for it in 2018. The seller in that $480-per-square-foot transaction was Blackstone Real Estate Partners.\nCBRE made several investments in the property, adding amenities like an on-site concierge, a fitness center and high-tech meeting spaces. That, combined with a cross-bay view of the San Francisco skyline, made the Powell Street building an attractive asset in the local office market.\nThe building has brought in some notable biotech and health care tenants in recent years.\nIn 2018, cybersecurity company Tanium leased 65,000 square feet in the building to serve as its headquarters; it moved to Seattle two years later, though it still occupies its space in the\nEmeryville building\n.\n\nEmeryville-founded protein bar company Clif Bar, meanwhile, is moving some of its workforce to the building, E\u2019ville Eye\nreported\n. And in 2022, insurance company Canopy Health signed a lease for 13,000 square feet at the building.\nThe building has approximately 103,000 square feet available for lease.\nLBA Realty has been largely absent from the East Bay real estate scene over the past decade. The Irvine-based firm used to own The Towers Emeryville, three office properties located near 2100 Powell Street. The company sold the buildings to real estate investment trust KBS in 2014 for $250 million \u2014 almost double the $130 million it paid for the 814,000-square-foot property in 2010.\nLBA Realty bought the 600 Townsend Street building in San Francisco in 2023 for nearly $25.4 million, the Business Times\nreported\n. And last year, it scored the\n255 California Street\nbuilding at a value of $55 million. Both discount purchases, along with the latest in Emeryville, speak to the ongoing\nslow recovery of the broader Bay Area office market\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Five years after completing the first condo tower at Metropica, a master-planned development in western Broward County, the developer announced he is reviving the project with new partners.\nMetropica Development CEO Joseph Kavana plans to begin construction on the next phase in October, he said at a ceremonial groundbreaking this week. The developer brought on Memphis, Tennessee-based Poag Development for the retail component, and Boca Raton-based\nWaypoint\nResidential for the residential phases.\nThe more than $1.5 billion mixed-use project calls for more than 3,000 condos and apartments, 650,000 square feet of office space, 485,000 square feet of retail space and two hotels on the 65-acre property.\nPoag and Waypoint will be responsible for about $300 million worth of development, said Metropica Development President Bernard Warren. Waypoint\u2019s managing director Chris Moore said the company is committed to building at least 900 residential units in the next several years.\nKavana has had his fair share of\nsetbacks\nover the years. He began assembling the site in the early 1990s and secured approvals for the mixed-use project in 2014. But he only completed Metropica One, a 263-unit condo tower at 1800 Northwest 136th Avenue, in 2020. In 2024, he tapped brokers to find and structure a\njoint venture partnership\n. And last year, Sunrise\napproved a density boost\nthat allows the developer to spread the cost to more residential units.\n\n\u201cThis is my work, and we are going to keep fighting the same way we fought over the last 15 years to try to make this a reality,\u201d Kavana said at the event on Tuesday.\nKavana is calling the next part of the\nSunrise\nproject the first phase, which he expects will be operating within three years. That includes nearly 1,000 luxury apartments and more than 150,000 square feet of retail space. About 50,000 square feet of condo office space will be built above the retail. The retail will be \u201ccomplementary\u201d to the nearby Sawgrass Mills and will be mostly restaurants, specialty shops and entertainment, Kavana said.\nMetropica Development sold portions of the property to Poag and Waypoint, Kavana told\nThe Real Deal\n. He declined to disclose the purchase prices. Metropica Development will handle the infrastructure and has the right to participate in the joint venture.\n\u201cAll the stars are aligned right now for us to be able to carry forward. We were ready to do this back in 2020 when Covid hit, and we had just finished the first tower,\u201d Kavana said. \u201cWe were ready to start with the retail. We had to wait for the right time.\u201d\n",

The sale price of approximately $150 per square foot for the part of the complex excluding the museum is more than 85 percent below the building\u2019s pre-pandemic value of $370 million, or about $1,000 per square foot.\nThe 409,000-square-foot property contains the former Wells Fargo History Museum on Montgomery Street and a 12-story office building on California Street. The offices are mostly vacant after Wells Fargo moved much of its operations to a 620,000-square-foot lease at 333 Market Street last year.\nThe purchase comes after housing developer\nForge Development Partners\nneared a deal to buy 420 Montgomery Street for a similar price with plans to convert the building into housing. The deal ended up falling through, leaving an opening for Redco.\nWells Fargo\nsunk more than $90 million in renovations on the property over the past decade. The office tower comes with a penthouse with a kitchen, dining hall, garden and rooftop deck that can be used for events.\nRedco has big plans to remake the building, starting with rebranding the property as \u201c450 California.\u201d The company is looking to transform the lobby into a public-facing space with various food and beverage tenants including a coffee shop, bar and restaurant.\n\nAt the top of the building, Redco is hoping to bring in a single tenant to lease the upper four floors, including the penthouse. Each floor has about 27,000 square feet of offices that can be occupied by one tenant or divided between multiple.\nMeanwhile, under the building, Redco plans to convert Wells Fargo\u2019s historic bank vault with a speakeasy bar, fitness center, bowling alley and other amenities. The former Wells Fargo History Museum on the ground floor will turn into a dedicated entrance for a large tenant.\nRedco\u2019s acquisition gives the firm control of nearly two blocks on the California Street corridor. Last year, the company bought 400 Montgomery Street next door to the Wells Fargo building for $25 million and 300 California Street for $28.5 million.\nFurther south in Showplace Square, in May, Redco bought a 78,000-square-foot office building at 208 Utah Street for $15 million. That property was\npreviously owned by Shorenstein\nand was vacant after anchor tenant Strava left for new offices downtown this year.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A major hotel player has staked ground in the Fort Worth Stockyards.\nIndiana-based\nWhite Lodging Services\nbought 3.5 acres in the Fort Worth Stockyards, a district that draws roughly 9 million visitors annually and has become a proving ground for high-profile hospitality projects, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe family-owned developer closed on the land at 400 East Exchange Avenue, next to the historic Armour &amp; Company building, which has been redeveloped as U.S. Energy Development\u2019s headquarters.\nThe seller, an entity tied to San Antonio\u2019s\nKairoi Residential\n, offloaded the parcel for an undisclosed sum, according to Tarrant County records. The land is adjacent to apartments operated by Kairoi dubbed The Union at Stockyards, at 601 Stockyards Boulevard, that started construction last year and opened to its first residents in May.\nWhite Lodging hasn\u2019t settled on what it will build, but the company is weighing a hotel and restaurant or a larger mixed-use destination. Conner White, vice chair and chief investment officer, framed the Stockyards as \u201ca unique intersection of history and opportunity,\u201d and said the company wants to add to the area\u2019s fabric while delivering new experiences for locals and visitors.\n\nThe move marks White Lodging\u2019s first project in Dallas-Fort Worth in more than two decades. The company, which operates about 60 hotels and more than 50 restaurants nationwide, has a heavy Texas footprint, particularly in Austin, where it developed the\nJW Marriott\nand Austin Marriott Downtown. It also controls 16 premium-brand hotels and 20 independent food-and-beverage venues across the state.\nCompetition for dirt in the Stockyards is fierce, as redevelopment has reshaped the once-sleepy historic district into one of Fort Worth\u2019s busiest destinations.\nThe Hickman family and California-based Majestic Realty pumped $200 million into an initial phase of a $1 billion expansion that delivered the Mule Alley corridor that includes the 200-key Hotel Drover, an Autograph Collection property. That partnership has floated plans for another 300,000 square feet of retail and hospitality but is now mired in litigation between Majestic\u2019s top executive and the former head of its Stockyards operations. The shakeup led to the exit of\ntwo Majestic executives\n.\nWhite Lodging hasn\u2019t revealed a timeline, but whatever it builds will join a lineup of projects designed to keep the historic district firmly in Fort Worth\u2019s tourism spotlight.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Cohen had previously been at Corcoran since 2000, and founded his eponymous team at the brokerage in 2017.\nThe Steven Cohen Team ranked as Elliman\u2019s No. 3 small team nationwide last year, closing $152 million in sales in 2024.\nCohen, who has closed over $2.4 billion in sales in his career, will bring with him six additional agents and four administrative team members.\n\u201cThe last five years at [Elliman] were really great for me,\u201d he said. His move to Corcoran came together in a matter of weeks, even though he\u2019d known \u201cthe door was always open.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I\u2019d see [Corcoran agents], they\u2019d always ask when I was coming back,\u201d he said.\nA spokesperson for Douglas Elliman said in a statement, \u201cWe wish Steve all the best at Compass.\u201d\nCohen returns to Corcoran with $110 million in active listings, including a $19 million penthouse at 535 West End Avenue.\nIn 2021, he brought the buyer of \u201cSex and the City\u201d star Kim Cattrall\u2019s $2.9 million cottage in East Hampton.\n\nHe\u2019s joining Corcoran at a tumultuous time for the brokerage. Its parent company, Anywhere Real Estate, recently agreed to be\nacquired by Compass\nin an all-stock deal. The deal, which is expected to close late next year, would bring the city\u2019s\ntwo top-ranked firms\nunder the same umbrella.\nCohen has made a name for himself with deals for historic Manhattan homes and a roster of the city\u2019s celebrity clients. In 2014, he sold a renovated neo-Georgian townhouse at\n39 East 74th Street\nfor almost $25 million. He also sold \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d producer Sidney Kimmel\u2019s Central Park South home for nearly $20 million and artist Abby Leigh\u2019s Upper East Side townhouse for over $20 million.\nCompass has thus far said that Anywhere\u2019s brands will maintain their independence. It also remains to be seen how antitrust regulation will factor into how Compass and its subsidiaries operate from city to city.\nCohen said he\u2019s not concerned about how the deal will play out at his new firm, which he said \u201cholds a really special place, particularly in New York City.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it will affect me,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course there will be some changes, but it\u2019s not something I\u2019m thinking about.\u201d\nCohen will join a number of other Elliman brokers who have jumped to Corcoran recently.\nLast month, one of the city\u2019s top brokers Noble Black, who ranked fourth in\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s 2024 ranking of the city\u2019s top brokers,\nbrought his team back to Corcoran\n, where he started his career. Earlier this year, veteran agents Kathy Murray and\nKirsten Jordan, along with her eponymous team\n, switched from Elliman to Corcoran.\nCorcoran hasn\u2019t been the only recipient of Elliman defectors.\nHolly Parker and her New York-based team\nand \u201cMillion Dollar Listing Los Angeles\u201d star\nTracy Tutor\nboth departed the firm for Compass this year.\n",

        "content": "AEW Capital Management and Mast Capital sold the Remi on the River apartment building on the Miami River for $108.4 million.\nBoston-based AEW and Coconut Grove-based Mast sold the eight-story, 342-unit property they completed last year at 999 Northwest Seventh Street in Miami, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The buyer is Valeris Capital, according to the sellers\u2019 news release.\nRobert Given and Troy Ballard were part of the CBRE team that represented the sellers.\nThe deal breaks down to $316,813 per apartment.\nThe buyer borrowed $72.3 million for the purchase from The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company, Vizzda records show. The loan matures in 2030.\nDesigned by Corwil Architects, Remi on the River consists of studios and one- to three-bedroom apartments. Monthly rents range from $2,300 to $4,700, the property\u2019s website shows.\nRemi on the River is the second phase of Mast and AEW\u2019s Miami River multifamily project. In 2020, they finished the first phase consisting of an eight-story, 346-unit building at 1001 Northwest Seventh Street, adjacent to Remi on the River. Grant Cardone, a motivational speaker who crowdfunds his real estate investments, bought the building for more than $100 million in 2022, incorporating it into his\n10X brand\n.\nAEW is led by CEO Jonathan Martin, and Mast is led by Camilo Miguel Jr.\n\nSouth Florida multifamily investment sales have calmed compared to during the pandemic, when an influx of out-of-staters prompted unprecedented demand, record rent growth and a flurry of sales. More recently, investment sales slowed amid elevated interest rates, a drop in rents and less demand due to slower in-migration.\nIn Miami-Dade, multifamily sales volume reached $6.2 billion in 2021 and $4.2 billion in 2022, according to data from Avison Young. Sales dropped to $1.5 billion in 2023 and $1.2 billion last year. So far this year, sales volume has picked up, hitting $940 million during the first half of this year, Avison\u2019s data shows.\nGenerally, buyers still purchasing apartments are either relying on Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae loans, or loans from insurers, which usually have better terms than bank financing. Some are all-cash buyers, and others are assuming sellers\u2019 existing debt on properties.\nIn July, Greystar paid\n$94 million\nfor the 358-unit Avana at the Moors apartment complex at 6200 Northwest 173rd Street in unincorporated Miami-Dade County. The buyer used a $65.5 million Freddie Mac loan.\nBlackstone bought the 359-unit Solea at Miami Lakes apartment complex at 17405 Northwest 94th Court in Miami Lakes for\n$115.9 million\nin April.\nLast month, health care honcho Rudy Rodriguez-Duret bought the 129-unit Sunset Apartments at 8951 Sunset Drive in Miami-Dade\u2019s Kendall neighborhood for\n$28.3 million\n; and FCP bought the 427-unit District West Gables at 2001 and 2101 Ludlam Road/Southwest 67th Avenue in West Miami for\n$111 million\n.\nAlso last month, Legacy Residential Group paid\n$77 million\nfor the 416-unit Legacy at Coconut Creek complex at 4303 West Atlantic Boulevard in Coconut Creek.\n",

        "content": "Arnaud Karsenti\u2019s 13th Floor Investments is partnering with a Dubai-based hospitality firm to develop the first Siro hotel in the U.S. in Miami\u2019s Brickell.\n13th Floor and Ian Ludmir\u2019s Forse Holdings, both based in Miami, are the local partners of Kerzner International\u2019s planned Siro Brickell, Miami tower. It will consist of 180 hotel rooms and suites, as well as 350 Siro-branded condos, according to a 13th Floor news release.\nKerzner, the Dubai firm, bought the nearly 1-acre development site at Brickell City Centre in August for\n$45 million\n. The property is at 9 Southeast Sixth Street in Miami.\nKerzner created the Siro brand as part of its hotel portfolio last year. The hotels have a focus on health and wellness, including on reducing jetlag and promoting sleep, the release says. Siro hotels also have fitness facilities and customizable nutritional offerings.\nSiro Brickell is expected to open in 2030, according to the release. It will mark the sixth Siro hotel, including those Kerzner opened and plans. On tap are Siro Palmilla in Los Cabos, Mexico, expected to open in 2027; SIRO Olaya in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, expected to open in 2028; and SIRO Roponghi in Tokyo, expected to open in 2029. Already open are Siro One Za\u2019abeel in Dubai and Siro Boka Place in Montenegro, according to the release.\nLed by Philippe Zuber, Kerzner\u2019s other brands include Atlantis Resorts, One&amp;Only and Rare Finds. The firm was founded in 1993 by late South African business tycoon Solomon \u2018Sol\u2019 Kerzner.\nSwire Properties, the real estate arm of Hong Kong-based Swire, developed the Brickell City Centre mixed-use complex, completing it in 2016, and sold the Siro development site to Kerzner.\n\nThe deal was part of Swire\u2019s divestment in recent months from its remaining Brickell City Centre holdings. In May, Swire sold the 2.8-acre development site where it had planned an office supertall to Melo Group for\n$211.5 million\n, after canceling the project. Swire also sold its remaining stake in Brickell City Centre\u2019s retail and parking to Simon Property Group for\n$512 million\nin June.\nBrickell\nbecame South Florida\u2019s darling market in recent years, attracting new-to-market office leases, as well as commercial and residential development.\nMore recently, higher interest rates and fewer out-of-state businesses and residents have slowed the South Florida boom. Generally, all-cash buyers have remained active, and some projects are pending.\nSpanish billionaire Amancio Ortega, founder of the Inditex holding company, is expected to purchase the Sabadell Financial Center office tower at 1111 Brickell Avenue for\n$275 million\n. Ortega, who makes real estate investments through his Ponte Gadea firm, is known for making all-cash purchases.\nLast month, funds affiliated with Blackstone bought the East Miami hotel, which is at Brickell City Centre, for nearly\n$300 million\nfrom funds managed by Trinity Investments and Certares.\nPlanned projects in Brickell include Yamal Yidios\u2019 Ytech firm\u2019s proposed\n54-story, 113-unit\ncondo tower at 41 and 75 Broadway; and Chilean developer Claudio Fischer\u2019s proposed\n41-story, 544-unit\nresidential tower on the former Mexican Consulate site in Miami\u2019s Brickell.\nAlso in Brickell, 13th Floor and the Ardid family\u2019s Miami-based Key International want to develop an\n80-story condo tower\nbehind First Miami Presbyterian Church at 609 Brickell Avenue. The project would replace the church\u2019s parking lot and school building, while the church itself will remain intact.\n",

        "content": "Rockwood Capital may be out of time. Special servicer Rialto Capital Advisors sued a company connected to Rockwood over a loan secured by the Santa Monica Clock Tower, once the city\u2019s largest skyscraper.\nRockwood assumed $26.7 million in commercial mortgage-backed securities\ndebt\nwhen it purchased the 12-story office building in 2019. Rialto alleges that Rockwood defaulted when the debt matured in May and owes about $25 million.\nRockwood\npurchased\nthe property, at 225 Santa Monica Boulevard overlooking the Pacific Ocean, from Sorgente Group of America six years ago for $58 million, or $1,084 per square foot. The alleged default amount works out to $447 per square foot.\nThe loan\nlanded\nin special servicing right before the local landmark\u2019s value was downgraded. Its value\ndeclined\nto $27.4 million in July compared to $49 million in 2015, according to Morningstar Credit. Occupancy is an issue: It stands at 43 percent, per Morningstar.\n\nRockwood Capital and managing partners David Becker and Tyson Skillings and attorneys for Rialto did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nRialto wants to foreclose on the Santa Monica Clock Tower and sell it. The special servicer requested a court-appointed receiver to take possession of the 53,500-square-foot, century-old, Art Deco building. Special servicers act on behalf of lenders; in this case, the loan was originated by German American Capital Corporation but was then sold off to investors in commercial mortgage-backed securities.\nRockwood expressed interest in transferring the title back to the lender, according to servicer commentary via Morningstar.\nSanta Monica offices have a 24 percent vacancy rate, according to a second quarter CBRE report. That isn\u2019t much worse than all of West Los Angeles, which has a 22 percent vacancy rate, but goes to show that the beachside city\u2019s office market hasn\u2019t seen a post-pandemic revival.\n",

        "content": "Chicago is taking fire from President Donald Trump, but visitors don\u2019t seem to mind.\nHotels in the\nCentral Business District\nbooked nearly 3.6 million room nights from June through August \u2014 a 4.3 percent gain over last summer that also topped the pre-pandemic high in 2019, according to Choose Chicago. The strong showing helped generate a record $949 million in hotel revenue for the summer, a 0.8 percent uptick from last year, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nChoose Chicago CEO Kristen Reynolds credited the record-shattering summer with a surge in regional travelers, which offset weaker international travel.\nDomestic tourism carried the season, with suburbanites and visitors within a five-hour drive filling rooms. International travel fell 3 percent year-over-year, dampened by Trump\u2019s hardline immigration and trade policies, while his repeated threats of federal intervention in Chicago haven\u2019t boosted the city\u2019s image abroad. Still, Reynolds said the drive market momentum is reshaping the city\u2019s tourism pitch.\n\nThe four biggest hotel weekends in city history all happened this summer: Blackpink\u2019s Soldier Field concert and a Nike youth tournament at McCormick Place led the pack with 92,643 room nights in July. Pride Fest,\nLollapalooza\nand Labor Day weekend each topped 91,000. Notably absent was NASCAR\u2019s Chicago Street Race, which is on pause until at least 2027.\nEven with the high occupancy and revenue, hotel owners aren\u2019t celebrating like it\u2019s 2019. Rising labor and construction costs, plus heavier property tax bills, have eaten into margins. Michael Jacobson, who leads the Illinois Hotel &amp; Lodging Association, warned that operators \u201ccannot rest on recent successes\u201d given ongoing cost pressures and economic uncertainty.\nThe city drew 55.3 million visitors last year, up 6.3 percent from 2023, but still shy of the 61.6 million peak in\n2019\n. Events are a key draw \u2014 and with Taylor Swift skipping this year and the\nDemocratic National Convention\nstill ahead in 2028, hotels are banking on a steady pipeline of sports, music and cultural festivals to keep the rooms full.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Foty is a principal with Rise Group Investments; Ganim is with Regional Properties Texas.\nMarcus &amp; Millichap\u2019s Chris Gaine and Philip Levy had the listing.\nDeed records show Charles Lucenay is the seller. He\u2019s the Houston-based owner of Cornerstone Commercial Properties. Foty and Ganim bought the property with an $11.7 million mortgage from Bank of Houston.\nSquare 67 sits on 17 acres and is 99 percent occupied, the release said. It is home to Fitness Connection and Family Dollar. The 25-suite retail strip is 2 miles from the Shops at Redbird, a landmark shopping mall in southern Dallas that\u2019s undergoing redevelopment. Developer Peter Brodsky purchased Red Bird in 2015. The mall is now home to apartments, a Dallas College workforce center, a day care, a Parkland Health Clinic and an outpost of UT Southwestern medical center.\n\nThe purchase comes a few months after Foty and Ganim purchased a similar property in Houston. Over the summer , they bought Woodforest Shopping Center, at 10907-11095 East Freeway, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. The 197,000-square-foot retail center was last valued at $11.9 million and was 96 percent occupied at time of the trade.\nRetail has proven to be a wise real estate investment after warnings about the death knell of retail after the Great Financial Crisis kept developers from building new products. As a result, space is limited and rents are high.\nIn Dallas-Fort Worth,\nretail rents are up from a year ago\n, increasing from $19.78 to $20.28 per square foot, according to Partners Real Estate. Vacancy rates are stable at 4.8 percent.\nThe market\u2019s stability means it\u2019s able to weather the\nclosure of big-box retailers, like Party City\n. The space has been gobbled up by\nexperiential users like gyms\nand even bookseller\nBarnes &amp; Noble, which is having a renaissance\n.\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s been eight months since the deadly Palisades and Eaton fires ripped through the Greater Los Angeles region, and if other parts of California scarred by fires are any indication, the communities that will reemerge from the ashes will be largely unrecognizable.\nResidents new and old are moving into areas damaged by wildfires, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\nTake the Northern California town of Paradise, burned by the 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest in the state\u2019s history.\nParadise native Jen Goodlin returned to her hometown six months after the 2018 Camp fire with plans to rebuild. Her family bought a lot where they parked a trailer, and eventually they moved into a new four-bedroom house. As younger residents like her are attracted to cheap land and room to rebuild, the demographics of the town have changed significantly from once being dominated by retirees. \u201cIt took the fire to bring me home,\u201d she told the Times.\nWhile less than a third of the 10,700 homes destroyed in the\nCamp fire\nhave been rebuilt, Paradise is still humming with life, the Times reported. Parks are open, construction crews work as taco trucks provide food for workers and residents, and registration for Little League is higher than they were before the 2018 fire. What\u2019s more, the new homes are often bigger as returning owners buy up adjacent lots and outsiders move in.\nRenters and low-income residents, however, have a different story.\n\nIn the Paradise area, many have moved into nearby Chico and other urban areas with more state-backed affordable housing projects away from fire-prone regions. In Santa Rosa, the 2017 Tubbs fire destroyed the Journey\u2019s End mobile home park, which provided housing to seniors on fixed incomes. It was later redeveloped into new apartments, but few former residents were able to return. Meanwhile, Santa Rose\u2019s formerly middle-class Coffey Park subdivision was rebuilt with homes now selling for more than $1 million, per the Times.\nCamp fire recovery has been slow and steady, though the\nrebuilding\nefforts after the 2020 North Complex fire in Butte County\u2019s Berry Creek has been even slower.\nOnly 5 percent of the nearly 1,500 homes have been rebuilt, the Times\nreported\n. That marks the lowest recovery rate of any major\nCalifornia fire\nin the past eight years. By contrast, about 30 percent of its housing stock has been replaced, thanks in part to billions in settlements and government aid. Berry Creek residents, however, were largely uninsured or underinsured; plus, because the fire was sparked by lightning, there was no legal standing to sue and little public attention or private donations. As a result, hundreds of residents are still living in trailers, recreational vehicles and makeshift shelters as officials direct affordable housing funds to\ndenser hubs\nlike Chico and Oroville.\nAs wildfires continue to spark across California, the divide between suburban and rural fire zones could become more pronounced.\nIn unincorporated parts of Los Angeles County torched by the Palisades and Eaton fires, 469 building permits have been issued so far,\naccording\nto the county\u2019s permitting dashboard. More than 16,000 structures were\ntorched\nin the January wildfires.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Construction workers in the City of Los Angeles could see the floor for their wages get considerably higher.\nOn Tuesday, Los Angeles City Councilmembers\nCurren Price\nand Hugo Soto-Mart\u00ednez introduced a motion to commission a study on the effects of setting a $32.35 minimum wage for all residential construction projects in the city with 10 or more residential units and under 85 feet in height, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\nIn addition to investigating the effects of such a minimum wage increase, the study would also examine the impact of an additional healthcare credit of $7.65 per hour for construction workers on such projects, according to the Times.\nPrice and Soto-Mart\u00ednez\u2019s motion argues that increasing wages and benefits is a necessary step to bring in more workers as the city continues to rebuild after the Palisades and Eaton fires. As fears across the construction world mount amid ongoing Immigrations and Customs Enforcement raids, demand for labor has surged as workers leave the industry.\n\u201cWe cannot allow an underground economy to continue exploiting vulnerable workers while\nour housing crisis\ndeepens,\u201d Price said in a press release, calling a\nconstruction worker minimum wage\nincrease \u201ca common-sense step toward dignity, stability and fairness in one of our city\u2019s most critical industries.\u201d\n\u201cConstruction workers who build housing in Los Angeles should be able to afford to live in Los Angeles,\u201d Soto-Mart\u00ednez added.\nCouncilmembers Bob Blumenfield, Heather Hutt, Eunisses Hernandez and Ysabel Jurado joined Price and Soto-Mart\u00ednez in their support for the motion. Construction unions and housing groups such as Abundant Housing L.A. and Housing Action Coalition have also voiced their support for a wage increase, according to the Times.\n\n\u201cThese are workers who can\u2019t afford a roof over their head, yet we rely on them to build the roofs over our own,\u201d Pete Rodriguez, western district vice president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, said.\nUnder the proposal, construction projects that already pay union-level prevailing wage and benefits would be exempt.\nThe idea drew backlash from Stuart Waldman, president of the Valley Industry and Commerce Association, who called the idea \u201cabsolute insanity,\u201d according to the Times. Many apartment\ndevelopers already have been avoiding building in L.A.\npartially because of\nMeasure ULA\n. \u201cThis will drive what little construction we have out of L.A.,\u201d Waldman said.\nA similar minimum wage increase for hotel and airport workers in Los Angeles faced\nsimilar pushback from business owners\n. Opponents sought to repeal the city\u2019s $30 minimum wage ordinance but failed to secure the minimum number of valid signatures needed to put the repeal before voters in a referendum.\nThe construction worker wage motion will proceed to a committee hearing.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

A record of the deal has not yet been recorded with the Los Angeles County recorder, leaving details of the buyer unknown at this time. Ramirez, reached Wednesday afternoon, was not immediately able to share client details.\nThe buyer nabbed a slight discount from the original list price, while Thorne walks away with about $600,000 more than what she paid for the home in 2019.\nThorne\u2019s breakout role was playing CeCe Jones on the Disney Channel series \u201cShake It Up.\u201d Since then, she\u2019s starred in \u201cFamous in Love,\u201d \u201cBlended,\u201d \u201cThe Duff\u201d and \u201cAmityville: The Awakening.\u201d\nThe Topanga property sits on an expansive 10-acre lot with the living space totaling about 7,600 square feet, with 360-degree views of the city, mountains and ocean.\n\nA gated, private road takes visitors up to the estate, where there\u2019s a roundabout and three-car garage. Outdoors, there\u2019s a pool, waterfall and BBQ area for entertaining.\nThe property is split between a 6,679-square-foot main house and a 945-square-foot guest house. Highlights of the main home include five ensuite bedrooms, arched windows, French doors and hardwood floors.\nThe detached guest house has its own two-car garage, living room and ensuite bedroom.\nThorne added some of her own personal design elements to the property, including a floral installation wrapping the stairs of the main home\u2019s foyer. The installation was created by florist Kristen Alpaugh and was part of the deal.\nThe median sale price of a home in\nTopanga\n, which is an unincorporated part of Los Angeles County, is $1.6 million, according to\nRedfin\ndata from August. That\u2019s down 20 percent year over year. Homes available for sale typically sell in a little over 90 days, which is up from 60 in 2024, per the Redfin data.\n",

CoStar first reported Crescent as the buyer. The valuation amounts to $638 per square foot.\nThat price eclipses the $218 million Uptown Link sale to Cousins Properties in August, setting a high-water mark for this year.\nThe 21-story tower, built in 2008, had only been on the market since\nJune\n. Union acquired it in 2016 for $226 million and listed it this summer with occupancy at 83 percent.

The firm already controls about a fifth of the district\u2019s office assets and is best known for the\nCrescent\ncomplex, a mixed-use campus that\u2019s long been a\nclubhouse\nfor Dallas\u2019 financial elite.\n\nTexas Capital Bank anchors the building, with a lease through 2040 that tripled its space and locked in naming rights.

During the same time frame, the number of active listings rose 7 percent from roughly 7,200 to 7,700.\nWhile elevated mortgage rates depressed sales across the country, transactions in Manhattan beat the decade norm. The number of sales was up about 1 percent from the long-term average of 3,030.\nThe borough\u2019s median price also increased nearly 6 percent year-over-year to just under $1.2 million.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing falling months of supply and rising sales outpacing that, which is keeping pressure on housing prices,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAffordability is still being tested.\u201d\nMortgage rates\nbegan dropping\nmidway through the third quarter, though Miller said the impact of that decline isn\u2019t yet evident in the data, given that prices remain high and most sales went to cash buyers.\n\nCash deals accounted for 65 percent of those transactions, with the number of all-cash deals rising 31 percent annually and the number of financed deals declining 9 percent.\n\u201cHigher-end consumers are better equipped to deal with elevated mortgage rates,\u201d Miller said, though he cautioned that \u201chigher-end\u201d isn\u2019t limited to the ultra-luxury sector.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t want to over-subscribe to the idea that these are all super luxury or super wealthy buyers. They\u2019re not.\u201d\nMany expect the Federal Reserve to announce two additional\ninterest rate cuts\nthis year, which could hold rates steady at their current lower levels or drive them down further.\nAn interest rate cut \u201cdoesn\u2019t guarantee that mortgage rates will fall, but it certainly helps given how damaged the job market has been,\u201d Miller said.\nHe added that a decline in mortgage rates could also\nease pressure\non the city\u2019s rental market, which has logged record highs in five of the last eight months.\nIf lower mortgage rates continue, \u201cwe\u2019ll see the rental market step back a little bit,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019ll be a dramatic improvement in affordability, but a reset to more stability.\u201d\nThe dip in mortgage rates will likely have a larger impact on results for the fourth quarter, Miller said, including an increase in deals at the lower end of the market compared to those at the higher end.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of pent-up demand in the market,\u201d Miller said, which could translate to a \u201crobust Q4 if mortgage rates fall.\u201d\n",

        "content": "With Mayor Eric Adams out of the race, some in the real estate industry see a path to victory for Andrew Cuomo. Others think nothing has changed.\nOn Monday, an email urged recipients to donate to Cuomo. This was one day after the mayor dropped his re-election bid and was the final day of fundraising before the next deadline for campaigns to file their contributions received between Aug. 19 and Sept. 29.\n\u201cWith Mayor Adams stepping out of the race, today marks a pivotal moment in the NYC mayoral election,\u201d it stated. \u201cToday is the day to support the Andrew Cuomo campaign so he can defend NYC against radical socialist policies.\u201d\nJared Epstein, president of development firm Aurora Capital Associates, who sent the email, says the effort helped raise $80,000, potentially more than $500,000 with public matching funds (though that has yet to be determined).\nEpstein thinks with Adams out, Cuomo can consolidate moderate voters. He acknowledged that some in the industry are not as optimistic.\n\u201cSome people talk like Mamdani\u2019s inevitable, but New Yorkers don\u2019t back inevitability, they back resilience,\u201d he said in an email.\nMeanwhile, one industry source told me that, absent Sliwa dropping out or an act of God, Mamdani is likely to be the next mayor. Believing he will likely be their next mayor, some in the industry have been focusing on ways to work with Mamdani.\nA poll released this month (before Adams bowed out) found that 46 percent of likely voters intend to cast their ballot for Zohran Mamdani. The poll, by the New York Times and Siena University, showed Cuomo in second with 24, but those margins narrow if Sliwa drops out. If the general election ends up being a two-way contest between Mamdani and Cuomo, the former would take 48 percent of the vote and the latter 44 percent, according to the poll.\nBut Sliwa has maintained that he won\u2019t quit the race.\nMamdani held a press conference on Tuesday outside 220 Central Park South \u2014 where the penthouse sold in 2025 for nearly $240 million \u2014\u00a0to criticize reports that Cuomo hit the phones after Adams dropped out of the race seeking donations ahead of the fundraising deadline.\n\u200b\u200b\u201cWe know that what billionaires and C-suite executives are once again trying to buy their way out of is a city that working people can actually afford \u2014 a city where the concerns of those people will be at the forefront and at the heart of our politics,\u201d Mamdani said in a statement.\nThe next set of campaign finance filings won\u2019t show us how real estate donors reacted to the news of Adams dropping out of the race, but activity over the next couple of weeks could provide more insight into whether more folks are holding out hope for Cuomo or have made peace with a Mamdani administration.\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill real estate try to appeal to the Trump administration on its decision to withhold billions of dollars from key NYC infrastructure projects? Will, say, the\nlargest property owner in the Penn Station area\nmake a call? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nCasinos play a major role in the fifth season of the show \u201cOnly Murders in the Building.\u201d For one, an illicit but grand casino is discovered in the subterranean levels of the fictional Arconia (the real-life Belnord) and figures into the aforementioned murders in the building. In the sixth episode, Oliver (Martin Short) and Loretta (Meryl Streep) are walking around Flatbush when they are asked by a man with a clipboard if they care about dogs dying. His mission isn\u2019t canine rescue, though: He\u2019s actually collecting signatures against opening a casino in New York City, noting that there are several competing bids.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 The Trump administration announced Wednesday that it is withholding $18 billion in federal funding for two key infrastructure projects in New York,\nPolitico New York reports\n. White House budget director Russell Vought said funding would be withheld from the Gateway Program, a new train tunnel under the Hudson River and the next phase of the Second Avenue subway, due to \u201cunconstitutional DEI principles.\u201d In a separate statement, the U.S. Department of Transportation indicated that funding for the projects was under review, to determine \u201cwhether any unconstitutional practices are occurring.\u201d The statement noted that the shutdown of the federal government meant that the review would take more time.\n\u2014 In his first public appearance since ending his reelection campaign, Mayor Eric Adams had a message for the next mayor: Don\u2019t f-it up. \u201cThis city is in good shape, and we need to make sure we don\u2019t go backwards,\u201d he said on Wednesday,\nGothamist reports\n. \u201cAnd let me say in the words of Bloomberg when I became mayor, \u2018Don\u2019t f\u2014 it up.\u2019\u201d\n\u2014 A NYCHA building in the Bronx partially collapsed on Wednesday after a gas explosion in the property\u2019s chimney shaft,\nWABC reports\n. No injuries were reported, and city officials are investigating the cause of the explosion.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$26.5 million\nfor a 9,652-square-foot single-family house at 11 West 12th Street in Greenwich Village.\nMark Fromm and Claudia Saez-Fromm with Douglas Elliman\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$7 million\nfor a 12,295-square-foot commercial property at 1619 Broadway in Midtown.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$32 million\nfor a 4,028-square-foot condominium unit at 432 Park Avenue in Midtown East. Anne Prosser with Brown Harris Stevens has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 47,984-square-foot, five-story school facility at 560 McDonald Avenue in Kensington. Lester Katz filed the permit on behalf of Jacob Bar Horin.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

Carey Smith\n, a Texas-based entrepreneur who founded Big Ass Solutions, his wife\nNancy Smith\nand their son\nTristan Smith\nsold a townhouse at\n11 West 12th Street\nfor $26.5 million. The Smiths purchased the home in 2019 for $19.9 million, then put it on the market in June, asking $27 million. The five-story, 25-foot-wide townhouse spans 9,700 square feet and has six bathrooms, a two-car garage, a gym, elevator and movie theater. It also has two terraces and a garden. The buyer was\n12th Street NY Holdings LLC.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe top commercial transaction recorded in the city was for a commercial condo at\n1619 Broadway\n, also known as the Brill Building in Times Square. The seller was\nMack Real Estate Group\n, and the buyer was\nNayaan LLC\n, tied to\nSaima Chowdhury\n, who paid $7 million for the 12,300-square-foot unit. Mack took over the Brill Building in 2023 in a\ndeal valued at about $216 million\n.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nIn Brooklyn Heights, a block from the waterfront, a trust tied to\nMichael B. Benner,\ngeneral counsel at Tishman Speyer, purchased a single-family home at\n104 Willow Street\nfor $11.3 million. The seller was an LLC managed by\nAlison Franco\n, who is also known as\nAlison Sargent\n, who purchased the property in 2014 for $10.6 million. The home dates to 1829 and has five bedrooms and four and a half baths. It spans more than 5,200 square feet. The seller first listed the home for sale in 2021 for $13.8 million, and it has been on and off the market since. Compass\u2019\nJames Augustine\nand\nEmma Teitgen\nhad the most recent listing.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: David Katz\ndropped $10.8 million on a 4,000-square-foot sponsor unit at The Astor at\n235 West 75th Street\n, developed by\nCIM Group,\non the Upper West Side.

The sellers of the home at\n57 Saint James Place\nin Todt Hill were\nRichard and Vania Cardinale\n, and the buyer was\nMontauk Island Estates LLC\n, tied to Mohammed S. Azad, who owns a contracting company. The Cardinales, owners of a chain of bagel restaurants, paid $1.5 million for the site in 2017 and built the 11,000-square-foot property over four years, according to\nCurbed\n.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Joanne and Craig Laurie\npicked up a full-floor condo, a sponsor unit, at\n126 East 86th Street\n, developed by\nRybak Development\nand\nBK Developers\n, on the Upper East Side for $6.6 million.

        "content": "More apartment towers are hitting the market in Chicago as the city and, more broadly, the Midwest, near the top nationally in rent growth, prompting\ndroves of listings\n.\nIn Lincoln Park, condo deconversion specialists Yitzy Klor and Saul Kupperwasser of\nStrategic Properties of North America\nare listing the K Square Apartments at 1749 North Wells Street. And a bit further north, Waterton is listing the Montrose Apartments in Buena Park at 4334 North Hazel Street.\nBoth SPNA and Waterton tapped Berkadia brokers Nick Harris, Pete Evans and Richard Evans to market the buildings. The brokers and a representative of Waterton declined to comment on the listings and representatives of SPNA.\nK Square Apartments\nKlor and Kupperwasser are hoping to cash in on the 268-unit K Square property after they converted it from condos to rentals in 2018.\nSkokie-based SPNA\npreviously listed the building\nbuilding with CBRE in 2023 but didn\u2019t end up selling it. It\u2019s unclear why the 22-story property didn\u2019t trade hands at the time but it appears SPNA is ready to try again.\nWhen the firm initially listed the property, it was fresh off of a separate failed deconversion deal at the Ontario Place condominiums in River North\nThe company had bought dozens of condos at the 467-unit building, after three years of negotiations, failed to close a $190 million purchase of the remaining units. The deal imploded in June 2023 when SPNA failed to put up $700,000 as a show of good faith to the remaining sellers.\nThings haven\u2019t been going much better since then. SPNA fumbled a second condo deconversion deal at 200 North Dearborn in 2024. The building\u2019s condo board voted to terminate an agreement with SPNA to sell the building\u2019s remaining units for $90 million after the company failed repeatedly to secure the financing needed to close the deal.\nStill, the time could be right for SPNA to score a win with the sale of the K Square Apartments. Chicago\u2019s multifamily market notched rent growth of 3.8 percent year-over-year in the second quarter, bested only by San Francisco\u2019s 5.1 percent rate, according to\nApartments.com\ndata. Plus, Klor in May saved a deal that one of his firm\u2019s affiliates looked set to lose to distress by getting a new $21 million loan for the 68-unit property at\n1211 North LaSalle Street\nto resolve a foreclosure lawsuit.\n\nWhile high interest rates have been tempering investors, SPNA is offering an assumable Fannie Mae loan that carries a 2.74 percent interest rate with a 2030 maturity date. The landlord refinanced the building with an $88 million loan in 2020 when rates were significantly lower than they are today.\nThe property was originally built as condos in 1971 before SPNA converted it into a standard rental building in 2018.\nThe Montrose Apartments\nIn Buena Park, multifamily heavy hitter Waterton is looking to offload the Montrose Apartments which the firm has owned since 2015.\nWaterton purchased the 18-story, 287-unit building for $65 million, with a $61 million mortgage from JPMorgan. The deal came out to $226,000 per unit.\nThe building is anchored by a ground floor Jewel Osco grocery store in the up-and-coming North Side neighborhood.\nUnits range from studios to 2-bedroom and 2-bathroom units with footprints of 520 to 1,025 square feet. Rents currently range from $1,770 to $4,850, according to Waterton\u2019s website.\nThe Chicago-based multifamily owner and operator has been active in the market recently with two recent purchases and one new listing.\nLast month, the firm dropped\n$90 million to buy a 263-unit building\nknown as the Mason in buzzy Fulton Market. The price came out to about $342,000 per unit. Over the summer, it made a\n$167 million purchase in the Los Angeles area\nof a 522-unit property.\nBack in Chicago, Waterton earlier this year listed the\n346-unit Grand Central apartments\nin the South Loop for sale, two years after acquiring it for $81.9 million.",

        "content": "A Schaumburg neighborhood is set to vanish under a proposal for two massive warehouses next to Experior Logistics\u2019 trucking hub.\nChicago-based Logistics Property Company lined up contracts for all 25 parcels along Long Avenue, including\n19 homes\n, to make way for a pair of speculative\nindustrial buildings\ntotaling 436,500 square feet on 70 acres, the Daily Herald\nreported\n. The company expects to close on the properties this winter.\nFor homeowners, the shift is bittersweet. Dina Menini, who has lived on Long Avenue for 25 years, said she once couldn\u2019t imagine leaving. But the arrival of Experior\u2019s 55-acre campus, and the round-the-clock noise of idling trucks, upended the rural atmosphere that drew residents there.\n\u201cNobody\u2019s going to want to buy our houses,\u201d she told the outlet. Menini, who owns a trucking company herself, described Logistics Property\u2019s offer as fair, but admitted the sale is emotional.\nThe homes, most built in the 1960s and 1970s, will be demolished if the project proceeds. Menini said she rebuilt her home 11 years ago. Some land in the assemblage is owned by the village, and\nSchaumburg\nofficials are already weighing how to support the redevelopment. The village is considering annexation and a tax-increment financing district to fund infrastructure improvements tied to the project.\n\nA study commissioned by the village projected the site\u2019s equalized assessed value would grow from $2.8 million today to $53.5 million over the 23-year life of a\npotential TIF\n. A review board of local taxing bodies meets later this month, with\u00a0 possible approval in December.\nIf greenlit, the development would cement the transformation of this southwest Schaumburg pocket from a residential enclave into a logistics hub.\nThe city\u2019s deal with Experior included a requirement for Experior to construct a bike path connecting Schaumburg\u2019s Metra Station to Rodenburg Road through the property, according to city documents. Its complex includes a 140,000-square-foot headquarters, warehouse space and a filling station for trucks.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The California Public Utilities Commission might be moving out of its longtime home in San Francisco.\nThe California Department of General Services floated moving the commission\u2019s staff from the Governor Edmund G. \u201cPat\u201d Brown Building at 505 Van Ness Avenue to the nearby Ronald M. George State Office Complex at 455 Golden Gate Avenue, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nIf the utilities commission decamps from the Pat Brown Building, the state could opt to sell the building, though other options have also been studied. A plan to renovate the building was rejected because of its projected cost of $880 million. The Ronald M. George Complex currently houses courtrooms, including the\nCalifornia Supreme Court\n.\nThe Department of General Services\u2019 recommendations to move staff comes after a review of the state\u2019s office portfolio, which is done every two years to identify places to save money. The post-pandemic proliferation of remote work prompted the state to clamp down further on owning excessive space at the risk of spending money unnecessarily.\n\nSome buildings under the Department of General Services\u2019 control are already on the sales block. Some of them are poised for transformation into housing. As for the RMG Complex, it could likely be headed to a renovation, though the government didn\u2019t disclose a cost estimate for such a project. The future of the Pat Brown Building remains uncertain, as the utility commission is the sole tenant at the property.\nThe state\u2019s office needs in San Francisco are projected to drop by up to 30 percent amid the shift to hybrid work and the overhaul of its real estate portfolio. With direct asking\nrents in San Francisco\nat $69 per square foot compared to a $36 average across the country, it appears more likely that employees will consolidate into the RMG Complex. If the Pat Brown Building is deemed to be surplus property, it could be converted into housing, similar to other state\noffice-to-residential projects\nin San Diego, Fresno and\nSan Jose\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The team behind one of Fort Worth\u2019s largest planned redevelopments is carving out space for an entertainment anchor.\nDallas-based\nLarkspur Capital\nand Fort Worth billionaire Robert Bass\u2019 Keystone Group plan to convert a former meat locker at 2800 Cullen Street into a restaurant-and-entertainment hub called \u201cThe Shed,\u201d which would serve as the northern gateway to the 37-acre, $1.7 billion Westside Village project, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe 3.67-acre property is slated for 19,100 square feet of indoor space, a sprawling 23,000-square-foot covered patio, another 23,500 square feet outdoors and 165 parking spaces, according to marketing materials from DBA Commercial Real Estate, which is leasing the space. A tenant has not yet been secured.\nSchafer Smartt, vice president at\nLarkspur\n, said the space is one of the few buildings in the district that has architecturally significant features worth retrofitting, noting the site\u2019s industrial heritage. Renovation work will start once a lease is inked, DBA\u2019s Austin Schenkel said. Line Design, known for adaptive reuse, is leading the design.\n\nThe development is meant to sync with the first vertical phase of Westside Village, set to start construction early next year at 100 North University Drive. That phase includes a $125 million, 308-unit luxury apartment building with a 716-space garage and a 100,000-square-foot Class AA office tower with retail, two restaurants and a private social club. Michael Hsu Office of Architecture is designing the office component, while Corgan is overseeing the residential piece. Completion is slated for 2028.\nThe broader\nWestside Village\nplan includes 880,000 square feet of office space, 238,000 square feet of retail, nearly 1,800 apartments, a 175-key hotel and $45 million in infrastructure upgrades by 2034. It would mark Fort Worth\u2019s largest office delivery in more than four decades.\nTo unlock a public incentive package\napproved this summer\n, the developers must invest at least $410 million and hit hard-construction spending of $311 million by 2030. Minimum requirements include 200,000 square feet of office, 95,000 square feet of retail and a hotel of at least 150 rooms.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Developer David Martin has set his sights on his next challenge, a redevelopment of the Miami Seaquarium property in Key Biscayne.\nAn affiliate of his Coconut Grove-based firm,\nTerra\n, has a $22.5 million deal in place to take over the lease for the 38-property at 4400 Rickenbacker Causeway, which is owned by Miami-Dade County. Resilient Aquarium LLC, the Terra entity, plans to renovate and modernize the Seaquarium. The marine mammals will be relocated under the proposal, according to a filing in Delaware\u2019s bankruptcy court. The current operator, MS Leisure Company, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April.\nIntegra Investments was among the companies to submit a proposal.\nThe Seaquarium has been operational since 1954. Miami-Dade County first moved to evict the company last year, but the\neviction proceedings\nwere stayed as a result of the bankruptcy filing. Miami-Dade alleged that the operator failed to maintain Miami Seaquarium in good repair and clean condition, and that it violated the federal Marine Mammal Act and Animal Welfare Act, citing substandard animal care. In 2023, the orca Tokitae, also known as Lolita, died in her tank of renal failure, following a decades-long effort by activists to retire her to a sanctuary.\nThe existing lease is set to expire in November 2044.\nTerra\u2019s plans\nMartin\n, CEO of Terra, plans to invest between $75 million and $100 million into the Seaquarium property, which will likely include adding restaurants, retail and a new marina with wet and dry boat storage for up to 350 vessels, he told Channel 10. Court filings show he plans a new accredited aquarium; marina and aquatic experiences; wellness spaces; a fisherman\u2019s village; and an education, conservation and research center. The historic Buckminster Fuller Seaquarium dome would be preserved and repurposed for event space.\n\nMS Leisure\u2019s parent company, the Mexico-based Dolphin Company, is developing a plan to transfer animals to alternative locations, and hired International Animal Exchange to handle the process.\nThe timeline\nA bankruptcy judge in Delaware has to sign off on the sale of the lease and is expected to rule on it at a 10 a.m. hearing on Oct. 17. Objections must be filed on or before Oct. 10 at 4 p.m. Miami-Dade County Commissioners also have to approve the deal at a later, unspecified date.\nIf the judge approves the lease transfer, the Seaquarium will close by the end of the year. The actual sale and transfer of the lease will occur 30 days after the final county approval, and no later than May 15, 2026.\nTerra\u2019s other projects\nMartin has long pitched himself and his company as a sustainable developer. He\u2019s partnering with the owner of\nJungle Island\nto redevelop a portion of the Watson Island property in Miami into a condo tower and a public park. Parks are often part of his developments, including the aptly named\nFive Park\nin Miami Beach, which has a 3-acre park that features an interactive playground, botanical garden, dog park and event lawn.\nHis other projects include the planned luxury condo tower at 1250 West Avenue in Miami Beach; the redevelopment of the\nDeauville Beach Resort\nproperty in Miami Beach; the Miami Beach Convention Center Hotel; the redevelopment of the Silver Sands Beach Resort property with Fortune International Group in Key Biscayne; and the Well-branded condo project in Coconut Grove.\n",

        "content": "A chunk of the vacant property in Pasadena owned by the California Department of Transportation will soon come under local government ownership.\nThe City of Pasadena is moving forward in its effort to acquire and\nsell 17 vacant Caltrans properties\n, Pasadena Now\nreported\n.\nThe Pasadena City Council first authorized the endeavor in June under SB 959, which requires three affordable units for every Caltrans unit purchased.\nThe City Council\u2019s initiative is aimed at transforming homes that were once slated for demolition as part of the abandoned State Route 710 North project and replacing them with denser housing. The area, now known as the \u201c710 stub,\u201d was cleared in the 1970s as part of the planned highway extension, displacing many low-income and minority residents in the process. Caltrans seized 400 homes by eminent domain for this effort in the 1960s.\nGetting movement on deals for the state-owned \u201cStub\u201d\u2013which comprises 400 parcels altogether\u2013 land has been a glacial process.\n\u201cWe\u2019re behind where we should be, without a question,\u201d Pasadena City Council member Steve Madison\ntold\nThe Real Deal\nin July\n.\n\u201cThe bottleneck is the city council, and in particular, the mayor [Victor Gordo].\u201d\n\nThe City is required to deploy the sales proceeds from the\nCaltrans\nproperties toward affordable housing by Dec. 31, 2026.\nPasadena officials identified four smaller non-historic properties as potential sites for affordable homes for sale. The remaining 13 properties will be listed on the MLS for fair market value,\naccording\nto an announcement from the city.\nBrokers will begin marketing the first 10 properties this week, according to the City of\nPasadena\n. Marketing for the other three addresses will begin this month. All properties will be sold as-is and will be subject to deed restrictions wherein the buyer would be required to repair the property and ensure it\u2019s ready for\noccupancy\nwithin a reasonable timeframe.\nUnder Pasadena\u2019s\nHousing Element\n, the city is required to plan for 9,429 units of new housing by October 2029. Of that, 2,747 must be very-low-income units, 1,662 units of low-income housing, 1,565 units of moderate-income housing and 3,455 units of above-moderate-income housing. In Los Angeles County, very-low-income is\ndefined\nas a maximum annual income of $53,000 for one person, while low-income is generally defined as making less than $84,850 every year. Moderate income, meanwhile, sits at around $89,550.\nDPP Compass, Sotheby\u2019s International Realty and Mutual Realty Consultants have been charged with marketing the vacant Caltrans properties for sale. How much they fetch on the market remains to be seen.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Against that backdrop, a blue-chip tenant adding space is a notable win for 734,000-square-foot Wacker Drive tower\u2019s landlord, a joint venture of Manulife and\nAllianz\n.\nThe deal comes after it lured investment firm Neuberger Berman into a 52,000-square-foot lease in a relocation from 190 South LaSalle Street as well as another law firm, Goldman Ismail Tomaselli Brennan &amp; Baum, into an expanded 43,000-square-foot space, both closed earlier this year. Goldman previously rented about 22,000 square feet at\n200 South Wacker\n, which sold earlier this year out of financial distress to investor Patrick Halloran and Chicago-based Glenstar.\n\nAt the time of Neuberger\u2019s lease, 191 North Wacker was 72 percent occupied, meaning the new relocations and Ropes &amp; Gray\u2019s expansion have boosted the property to well above downtown Chicago\u2019s average.\nThe law firm didn\u2019t immediately return requests for additional details about the lease expansion, such as the length of its term.\nIts growth comes as 191 North Wacker is set to unveil a 26,000-square-foot amenity center later this year, the kind of asset that tenants insist on having access to in today\u2019s market as corporate leaders try convincing workers that commuting into offices is worthwhile. The addition will include a tenant lounge, flexible conference facilities, a wellness center and a presentation theater, part of a broader push by landlords to make Class A buildings more competitive as tenants demand high-end perks from their offices.\nRopes &amp; Gray has been a tenant at 191 North Wacker since 2013 and has had a Chicago presence since 2008, when it started with three local partners and rapidly grew its headcount in the city. It began with a sublease of 38,000 square feet in the building 12 years ago.\nCBRE\u2019s Matthew Dobry and Geoffrey Euston represented Ropes &amp; Gray in the recent negotiations, while the landlord\u2019s leasing team included Transwestern\u2019s Katie Steele, Kathleen Bertrand and Eric Myers.\n",

Bilt now has more than 200 employees and plans to create 625 new jobs under the agreement with the Empire State Development Corporation.\nGov. Kathy Hochul said Bilt\u2019s decision to stay in New York \u201cunderscores the unmatched talent, energy, and opportunity that only New York can offer.\u201d\nJain launched Bilt in 2021 and boasts that the company\u2019s network includes one in every four apartment buildings across the country. He said the company was valued at $10.75 billion in July after a $250 million funding round led by General Catalyst and GID.\nThor Equities, Taconic Investment Partners and Square Mile Capital redeveloped 837 Washington Street in 2011 and leased the entire building to Samsung. They sold it to Nuveen, the real estate arm of TIAA-CREF, in 2015 for\n$200 million\n\u2014 setting a record for the Meatpacking District.\n",

        "content": "Owning a piece of one of New York City\u2019s most iconic landmarks finally has a price tag.\nThe team behind the hotly anticipated\nconversion of the Flatiron Building\nreleased the first glimpse of pricing at the building, according to an offering plan filed with the Attorney General\u2019s office.\nThe plan includes asking prices for 18 of the project\u2019s 38 planned residences, which together have a target sellout of roughly $375 million. Combined with the price of 38 storage lockers and six wine sellers, developers expect to yield more than $380 million.\nPrices released so far start at just below $11 million for a 3,000-square-foot unit with three bedrooms and three bathrooms. The two priciest condos are unit Nos. 20 and 21 asking $48 million and $50 million, respectively. Both feature five bedrooms and five bathrooms and span more than 7,400 square feet. Unit 21 also has 33 square feet of outdoor space.\nThe plan does not yet include pricing for 20 of the residential units, including a 4,600-square-foot penthouse. The four-bedroom unit isn\u2019t the largest offering, though it comes with more than 6,600 square feet of outdoor space \u2014 the most of any unit in the current plan.\nThe developers, the Brodsky Organization and Sorgente Group, earlier this year tapped Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group to\nhead sales at the project\nat 175 Fifth Avenue with a team led by new development veterans Donna Puzio and Angeli DeCecchis.\n\nPuzio previously worked on sales at Related Companies\u2019 Lantern House and Mickey Rabina\u2019s 520 Fifth Avenue, while DeCecchis\u2019 track record includes Related\u2019s 450 Washington and Extell Development\u2019s Central Park Tower.\nSales appear to have started at the building, with Corcoran\u2019s Steve Gold claiming in an\nInstagram post\non Wednesday he brought the buyer who signed the first contract at the conversion.\nGold did not respond to a request for comment on the pending deal.\nA spokesperson for the conversion declined to provide additional details or confirm an official sales launch, though the spokesperson said in September that sales would begin later this year.\nGFP Real Estate\u2019s Jeffrey Gural and a group including Sorgente, ABS Partners and Nathan Silverstein, paid\n$160 million\nfor the Flatiron Building at a 2023 auction, following a failed $190 million bid by an outside investor, Jacob Garlick, who didn\u2019t pay the deposit. Brodsky bought a stake in the project later that year.\nNews of the project\u2019s pricing comes as the city\u2019s new development market is headed for an\ninventory drought\n. Few new buildings are slated to hit the market this year, as developers struggle to land financing while loan and land costs continue to rise.\n",

Bush was in the White House.\nTenants gobbled up 9.4 million square feet \u2014 a 2 percent bump from the second quarter and nearly 27 percent higher than the five-year quarterly average, according to a new Colliers report. Leasing volume surpassed 30 million square feet for the entire year, blowing past pre-Covid levels and marking the strongest period of year-to-date demand since 2002.\nIf the third-quarter pace holds, the year will end north of 40 million square feet \u2014 about 20 percent higher than 2024, per Colliers. But it could still fall short of 43 million square feet of leasing activity in 2019.\nDeloitte\u2019s 807,000-square-foot lease at Related\u2019s 70 Hudson Yards was the largest lease of the quarter, and the third-largest deal of the year so far. Guggenheim Partners locked down the second-largest, a 359,000 square-foot renewal and expansion at Munich Re\u2019s\n330 Madison Avenue\n. Salesforce\u2019s 311,000-square-foot renewal and expansion at La Caisse\u2019s 3 Bryant Park was the third-largest deal.\n\nDemand is finally cutting into the post-Covid glut of empty space.

Sublet supply \u2014 once a pandemic-era albatross \u2014 has shrunk nearly 40 percent in two years and is back near pre-pandemic levels.\nRents are creeping up, too. The average asking rent hit $74.89 per square foot, its highest since late 2023 but still almost 6 percent below March 2020. Class B offices posted the biggest jump, up 3.2 percent to $67.83, while Class C space sank to a decade-plus low.\nInvestors are sniffing around again as well. Eleven office buildings traded hands for $1.6 billion in the third quarter, including RXR, Elliott Investment Management and Baupost Group\u2019s\n$1 billion purchase\nof 590 Madison Avenue.\n\u201cThere were continued signs of the Manhattan office market recovering in virtually every measurable way during the third quarter,\u201d said Colliers\u2019 Franklin Wallach. \u201cAlthough the march towards recovery has been building\u2026 the momentum must continue through the end of 2025 and into 2026 for full recovery to be achieved.\u201d\n",

Deuter, who specialized in capital markets deals as an executive managing director at Cushman, has tallied more than $15 billion in transactions nationwide during his career, Crain\u2019s first\nreported\n.\nDeuter will zero in on multi-tenant suburban office buildings across Chicago and the Midwest, a niche where he\u2019s well known among institutional investors, according to Colliers. He previously logged stints at CBRE and Pearlmark Real Estate Partners, and he cut his teeth in valuation work at Arthur Andersen after graduating from the University of Illinois.\nThe timing of Deuter\u2019s exit from\nCushman &amp; Wakefield\ncomes as transaction volume has slowed to a trickle, due in part to remote work dents in demand and interest rate plateaus. Many suburban landlords are under pressure from maturing loans and resorting to fire-sale discounts. That dynamic has opened the door for\ndistressed trades\n.\n\nThe trade for a seat at\nColliers\n\u2019 table also means Deuter is leaving a team \u2014 including Cody Hundertmark, Tom Sitz and Jeremiah Olsen at Cushman \u2014 that have risen to become go-to investment sales brokers in the post-pandemic office market. Most recently that team represented the seller of the deeply-discounted\n111 West Illinois Street\ntower to WindWave Real Estate and Path Construction in June for $17 million. The buyers plan a $64 million office-to-residential conversion of the top six floors into 153 apartments. The discount was steep, as the River North office building sold for $75 million in 2015.\nAdding a suburban office specialist could pay off for Colliers if activity picks up in the next few years, or if investors increasingly target distressed suburban products for opportunistic buys.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Earlier this year, Houston had the\nlowest sale-to-list ratio of any populous metropolitan area in the country\n, telegraphing negotiating power for buyers.\nHouston and Dallas led the nation in price cuts in August\n, with nearly a third of sellers caving to discounts.\nHarris County ranked fifth among the most-populous counties for annual decreases in median home price, according to ATTOM.\nBuyers are gaining an edge throughout the Sun Belt. After a swift run of accelerating demand, during which builders and sellers enjoyed a rush of in-migration and historically fast home appreciation,\nTexas and Florida\nboomtowns have braked suddenly and tumbled into buyer\u2019s markets.\n",

Because the zoning change is an ordinance, it requires a second reading vote.\nThe zoning change will clear the way for Boca Raton-based SobelCo to build four buildings on what was once a boat yard with a total of 508 condo units, 10,000 square feet of retail, 1,081 parking spaces, and a ninth-floor amenity deck with pools, spas, grilling stations and other features.\nThe condos, which will include 246 one-bedroom units and 262 two-bedroom units, will be marketed to young professionals interested in living near West Palm Beach,\nSobelCo vice president Tirso San Jose\ntold\nThe Real Deal\n. The units will be priced at just under $1 million.\nIt\u2019s planned for a site next to an expanding workforce townhouse project called Villa L\u2019Onz and near Marina Annex, a 175-unit workforce housing project with a 15,000-square-foot community center proposed by a development team led by New York-based\nO\u2019Connor Capital Partners\n.\n\nThe SobelCo development site is also across the street from Marina Village, a 90-acre area adjacent to the Port of Palm Beach that Riviera Beach officials want to redevelop to attract more jobs and revenue. It\u2019s on a portion of Marina Village where the Related Group\u2019s affordable housing arm, Related Urban, recently broke ground to build the\nResidences at Riviera Beach\n, a 149-unit workforce housing project after\nsecuring $100.3 million\nin construction financing. The Related Group, BH Group and Tezral Partners also intend to build\nGallery at Marina Village\n, a 20-story market-rate apartment project, next door.\nThe city also issued a\nnew bid for developers\ninterested in building hotels, restaurants and entertainment on another 12 acres near Marina Village\u2019s marina area.\nFarther north, at 3700 Broadway, developer Peter Baytarian of Forest plans to build\ntwo 25-story mixed-use condo towers\ncalled Oculina.\nAbout a half-dozen residents spoke in favor of the SobelCo project, including former Riviera Beach Councilwoman Julia Botel. Botel said the development will be the first thing people will see when driving over the bridge from West Palm Beach.\n\u201cInstead of vacant lots and underutilized land, people will see new life and new energy and beautiful construction that reflects the promise of Riviera Beach\u2019s future,\u201d Botel said.",

        "content": "A sprawling mansion sold for $11 million in Lake Forest on Wednesday, ending another powerful Midwest business family\u2019s run at the property with an elite history of ownership.\nThe home at 930 East Rosemary Road is the most expensive sale in Lake Forest since 2022, when a Mayflower Road estate brought in nearly $13 million.\nThe eight-bedroom, nine-bathroom house was designed by architect Benjamin H. Marshall in 1912 and expanded in 1996 by Thomas Beeby. It covers 11,800 square feet. The property has a pool, outdoor gardens and a glass-paned indoor conservatory. There is an attached coach house, a guest house and a poolhouse on the estate. The outdoor space features ornate landscaping, gardens and open green spaces.\nThe home was sold by the estate of Posy Krehbiel, who died in 2022. She was the ex-wife of John Krehbiel Jr., who she bought the property with in 1988. John Krehbiel Jr. was the co-chairman of electronics company Molex, which Koch Industries bought in 2013.\nThe home was initially\nlisted in August 2024 at nearly $15 million\n, making the final $11 million price tag around 73 percent of the asking price.\n\nProperty records that could indicate the buyers\u2019 identity are not yet available.\nAnn Lyon with @properties Christies International Real Estate represented the seller. Amanda McCmillan and Andra O\u2019Neill, also with @properties, represented the buyers. They could not be immediately reached for comment.\nThe Krehbiels bought the house in 1988 for $1.95 million. They later expanded the property to include five parcels covering nearly 9 acres. It\u2019s unclear if the latest purchase was for all parcels or if the buyer split off some of them. Krehbiel\u2019s estate paid a little over $126,000 in property taxes on the five parcels in 2025.\nThe house was built in 1912 for John T Pirie, president of Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Co, a dry goods and department store company. It was later owned by Laurance Armour Jr., part of the Armour meat packing family who was the vice chairman of the board at LaSalle Bank.\nThe sale is the latest in a year of success in\nChicago\u2019s luxury market\n. The North Shore has been the site of several home sales that surpassed $10 million.\nA $31.3 million estate in Winnetka\nset the record for the most expensive Chicago area home sale in history in August.\n",

The Houston-based midstream operator will relocate its headquarters from Hess Tower next year.

Griff Brandy of Partners Real Estate represented Third Coast in the deal.\nThe lease shows momentum for a building that has worked to differentiate itself from Houston\u2019s glut of office supply. Designed by Copenhagen-based\nBjarke Ingels Group\nwith a side-core structure that maximizes natural light, the tower overlooks Discovery Green and recently landed Tenfold Coffee on the ground floor.

        "content": "Vanbarton Group landed a $280 million loan for Pearl House, its recent Financial District office-to-residential conversion.\nAllianceBernstein provided a $238 senior loan for the 588-unit luxury apartment building at 160 Water Street, according to property records. Brookfield provided $42 million in mezzanine debt.\nThe fresh financing replaces a $277 million loan from Brookfield\u2019s lending arm for the conversion of the 24-story, 533,000-square-foot office building. Eastdil Secured brokered the deal, which was first reported by\nCommercial Observer\n.\nVanbarton, led by Gary Tischler and Richard Coles, purchased the 1970s-era office building in 2014 for $165 million. The developer mulled selling the property, but ultimately decided to undertake the conversion in 2022.\n\nLeasing for the market-rate units\nlaunched in 2023\nand the building was 99 percent occupied within a year, a Vanbarton spokesperson said. When the sales at the Pearl House first launched, rents for studio apartments started at $3,500. One-bedroom units were priced at $4,700, while two-bedroom units started at $6,400. The building has more than 30,000 square feet of amenities, including a bowling alley and a hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber.\nVanbarton has been doing conversions for more than two decades, and its appetite shows no signs of slowing. The firm just bought its third office building in the past year as bargains in the office market, new city and state incentives and demand for new apartments have led to a boom in conversion opportunities.\nThe developer bought\n6 East 43rd Street\nfrom the Milstein family\u2019s Emigrant Savings Bank for $135 million last May and plans to convert it into 441 rental apartments. It\u2019s shelling out about $100 million to buy the home of the Archdiocese of New York at\n1011 First Avenue\n, which it plans to transform into 420 apartments. And late last year, it bought 77 Water Street in the Financial District for\n$95 million\n, which it will turn into 600 units.\n",

Loan proceeds are expected to go towards capital improvements.\nA JLL team including Kevin Davis, Mark Fisher and Jillian Mariutti arranged the loan at the 774-key property.\nBesides Westin\u2019s brand recognition, Smith Hill\u2019s Brendan McCormick pointed to \u201creally attractive supply dynamics\u201d for the hotel market on the East Side of Manhattan as part of the rationale for his firm\u2019s involvement.\nDavidson Kempner acquired the property one block away from Grand Central from seller Host Hotels and Resorts\nfor $302 million\nin 2019. Goldman Sachs provided the firm with $197 million in short-term, floating-rate debt for the deal and Davidson Kempner planned $20 million in renovations; it was the firm\u2019s first purchase of a major hotel in the United States.\n\nIn 2023, Davidson Kempner paid down $63 million in principal from the Goldman Sachs loan and\nsecured a $150 million loan\nfrom Apollo Global Management.\nThe 41-story hotel was developed in 1981 by Harry Helmsley. It included design touches like a red-and-gold carpet and a pair of attached golden H\u2019s mounted over the front desk. Leona Helmsley, the \u201cQueen of Mean,\u201d reportedly lorded over the hotel\u2019s operations and staff.\nHer estate sold the property in 2011\nfor $313.5 million\nto Host Hotels, which closed it for 18 months and spent $75 million to renovate and replace the dated design. Host Hotels repositioned the property and opened it in 2012 under Marriott International\u2019s upper-upscale Westin brand.\nSmith Hill (whose parent company is Procaccianti Companie) and Bain formed a joint venture two years ago to provide capital solutions to hospitality ventures. In the spring, they\nlent $235 million\nto refinance Gurney\u2019s Montauk Resort on Long Island.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Mayor Eric Adams is making a major move before leaving City Hall: locking in Related Companies to run Wollman Rink for the next two decades.\nWollman Park Partners II, an affiliate of Related, was selected to take over the concession, beating out the Trump Organization and a bid from the Central Park Conservancy, according to a Parks Department announcement reported by\nThe City\n. The deal includes $10.9 million in upgrades to the rink and $91 million in concession fees over the 20-year term.\nThe nonprofit Conservancy pushed a competing offer to donate $120 million and operate the rink, promising a broader reimagining of the park\u2019s southeast corner.\nBetsy Smith, the group\u2019s president, blasted the city\u2019s decision to maintain \u201can island of for-profit commerce in the middle of Central Park\u201d rather than accept a plan that would have added bathrooms, fixed accessibility issues and created year-round cultural programming.\nInstead, Related will remain in control of the site it was\nfirst tapped\nto manage in 2021, when then-Mayor Bill de Blasio yanked the Trump Organization\u2019s contract after the Jan. 6 riot; Trump bid again for control this time around.\n\nRelated pledged to install a new ice-making system, upgrade mechanical infrastructure and improve stormwater management. A Parks spokesperson said the work wouldn\u2019t disrupt operations.\nThe timing was key: Parks rushed to get the deal before the Franchise Concession Review Committee\u2019s Oct. 16 meeting, ensuring Adams could finalize it before stepping down in December after ending his re-election bid. Had the administration missed that window, the decision would have fallen to his successor. The committee still needs to approve Related\u2019s bid.\nThe move extends Related\u2019s footprint in city-backed projects. In June, Adams\nannounced a deal\nwith the developer to build 4,000 apartments, including 764 permanently affordable units, over the Hudson Yards rail yard, a project buoyed by $2 billion in public funds.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Toronto-based Great Gulf bought the 3-acre waterfront property for\n$28.5 million\nlast year, after completing its 25-story, 83-unit\nLa Clara\ntower in 2023.\nIts latest planned condo, 5400 North Flagler, is slated to replace the Poinsettia Apartments, a two-building multifamily complex spanning three stories and 72 units built in 1966. The property at 5400 North Flagler will include a pool and the developer is considering adding a dock with between four and eight slips, according to the plans presented.\nThe design team includes Moshe Safdie\u2019s Safdie Architects, West Palm Beach-based Spina O\u2019Rourke + Partners, Toronto-based interiors firm Studio Munge, and landscape firm Enea, which is based in Rapperswil-Jona, Switzerland.\nGreat Gulf was founded in 1975 by Harry Rosenbaum, Elly Reisman, Norm Reisman, Larry Robbins and Seymour Joffe, according to reports. It has built more than 80,000 homes across North America, and currently has more than 9,000 units planned or under construction, according to its website. Neil Vohrah is its president of high-rise residential, and is overseeing the 5400 North Flagler project.\n\nIt marks Great Gulf\u2019s second project in the coastal city. It sold out La Clara at 200 Arkona Court for\nmore than $209 million\n.\nBuyers included American Express heiress Stephanie Currey Ingram, Marvel Studios executive Louis D\u2019Esposito, and Jonathan Lerner, whose D.C.-based developer family owns the Washington Nationals. Spec developer Todd Glaser and his partner Jim Randall bought the penthouse unit for\n$18.8 million\n, with the intention to flip it for $28.5 million, but the unit has since been pulled from the market.\nLa Clara\u2019s owners\nfiled a lawsuit against Great Gulf\nin February, alleging the building had construction defects and lacked the luxury finishes buyers were promised.\nIts 5400 North Flagler joins a stacked pipeline of planned condominiums in West Palm Beach, where\nmore than 2,000 units are in development\n. Also in the North Flagler Drive corridor are Related Group and BH Group\u2019s planned 21-story, 39-unit\nApogee\ntower and BGI Capital and Blue Road\u2019s 22-story, 55-unit\nAlba Palm Beach\n, which is nearing completion.\n",

Even so, the number of units under construction in Los Angeles has been in a free fall since early last year, approaching a decade low.\nFewer than 19,000 apartments were under construction in the third quarter, a 30 percent drop from three years ago, per CoStar.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a needle in a haystack to find an opportunity that makes financial sense to build today,\u201d developer Cliff Goldstein told the Times. \u201cA developer without investors would be like a king without clothes. I am an optimistic developer who wants to develop, but the investment community won\u2019t participate.\u201d\nDevelopers have shelved projects and taken their business\nto other municipalities\n.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t bought a site with the intention to develop it in over two years,\u201d Kahan told the outlet. \u201cI don\u2019t know when we will be building in L.A next\u201d\nThe Real Deal\u2019s Building Back L.A.\nroundtable revealed similar sentiments last month.\n\u201cBuyers and sellers are absolutely disgruntled over ULA, and it is not going away.
