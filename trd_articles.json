        "content": "The Federal Reserve is\nagain sounding the alarm\non commercial real estate, sharpening its focus on office-heavy loan books at community and regional banks that are absorbing the brunt of the post-pandemic reset.\nIn its latest supervision and regulation report, the central bank cited \u201celevated interest rates, tighter underwriting standards and lower commercial property values\u201d as pressure points that could complicate refinancings and push more borrowers toward distress, Bloomberg reported.\nFor real estate players, the subtext is familiar: lenders are bracing for more pain across offices and other challenged asset classes. The Fed\u2019s message isn\u2019t that banks are in danger but that the CRE drag is persistent and refinancing risk remains elevated.\nWith valuations drifting lower and buyers hesitant, banks holding CRE debt are navigating a landscape where even stable sponsors can struggle to extend maturing loans. Fed supervisors said they\u2019re not just tracking CRE trends but also scrutinizing credit-loss reserves and how aggressively banks are marking their portfolios.\nWhile the Fed found most institutions still well above minimum capital thresholds through the second quarter, watchdogs are taking a closer look at capital planning and liquidity management on Wall Street, according to the report.\nThe latest round of stress tests suggested big banks could weather a recession without triggering capital breaches or a freeze in lending, but policymakers are trying to keep attention trained on \u201cmaterial risks\u201d \u2014 including interest rate impacts and cybersecurity threats \u2014 a mantra championed by Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman.\nRegulators have eased certain capital rules this year and recently finalized tweaks to ratings for large banks, but the Fed signaled fresh vulnerabilities are cropping up. A spate of private credit defaults has raised concerns about banks\u2019 indirect exposure to nonbanks, where leverage is higher and oversight lighter.\nSupervisors plan to monitor that channel closely as traditional lenders keep partnering with private credit platforms hungry for deal flow.\nThe agency is also deepening its review of banks\u2019 recovery plans, focusing on how quickly institutions can marshal real-time data if those plans ever need to be activated. That includes strategies to shore up liquidity for key operations under multiple resolution scenarios.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A controversial bill that would give nonprofits first dibs to buy multifamily properties will now be less sweeping, but changes to the measure have not won over its fiercest critics.\nAn amended version of the\nCommunity Opportunity to Purchase Act\n, or COPA, would apply to multifamily buildings with four or more units that are also considered distressed or that have affordability requirements that recently expired or will soon end. The previous iteration simply applied to properties with three or more units.\nThe new version of the bill shrinks the pool of buildings subject to COPA and also decreases the exclusivity window granted to \u201cqualified entities.\u201d It also changes the structure of how buildings that don\u2019t comply are fined.\nWhen such buildings go up for sale, \u201cqualified entities\u201d approved by the city would be given the first opportunity to buy the properties. The new bill expands the definition of \u201cqualified entities\u201d to include for-profit companies that form a joint venture with nonprofits. That means those joint ventures, alongside nonprofits, will also have the right of first refusal under COPA.\nThe measure additionally excludes owner-occupied buildings with five or fewer units, while also making vacant lots zoned for residential use eligible for COPA sales.\nThe changes address a number of critiques of the previous bill, and even follow a suggestion\nmade by the Adams administration\nto limit the buildings eligible to those in significant and financial distress.\nBased on HPD\u2019s response on Tuesday, the agency hasn\u2019t yet been won over. A spokesperson\nprovided the same statement\ngiven to\nThe Real Deal\nlast week in response to the previous bill, saying that the agency is \u201ccommitted to providing input and feedback to ensure that all potential effects are fully evaluated and considered.\u201d The spokesperson said the agency is \u201cdeeply grateful\u201d to Council member Sandy Nurse, the bill\u2019s sponsor, for her \u201ccontinued engagement.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m proud that, by working closely with diverse stakeholders, we\u2019ve refined the bill while keeping its central purpose intact: preserving and expanding permanently affordable homes for New Yorkers,\u201d Nurse said.\nWill Spisak, senior policy strategist for the nonprofit New Economy Project, which advocated for COPA, said the bill now targets buildings that could most benefit from working with nonprofits that specialize in preservation work. He said COPA could also help buildings that would otherwise be shuffled between speculative buyers on their way to the city\u2019s lien sale.\nBut not all stakeholders are on board.\nAnn Korchak, board president of the Small Property Owners of New York, doesn\u2019t think the bill is workable even with the changes.\n\u201cClearly it still has in the crosshairs, small building operators,\u201d she said. \u201cBuildings end up on this distressed list because of state and city policies and housing courts.\u201d\nProperty owners and brokers sounded the alarm on the bill last month, saying it would devastate the city\u2019s multifamily market. Broker Bob Knakal, at the time, said the City Council had \u201cdropped a bomb on the multifamily market.\u201d\nMatt Cosentino, who leads multifamily sales at Brooklyn-based brokerage TerraCRG, acknowledged that the timeframes included in the new bill are preferable to the previous proposals, but said the new parameters around how a building qualifies will create confusion for owners.\nThe measure lays out various ways a building is considered distressed, including if it is part of the city\u2019s\nalternative enforcement program\n, has significant tax liens, is subject to the city\u2019s\nemergency repairs program\nor has unpaid municipal charges totaling $1,500 or more per unit. The bill also leaves the door open for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development to add its own qualifying criteria.\nProperties that had an affordability requirement expire in the past two years, or that have one expiring in the next two, would also be subject to COPA.\nThe bill additionally lays out a new timeline for these deals. For COPA buildings, an owner must give HPD at least five days, instead of 180, before moving to sell their building.\nQualified nonprofits and community land trusts will then have 45 days, rather than 60, to submit a letter of intent to make an offer on the property. They then have 90 days (starting after the 45-day limit runs out) to bid on the building.\nUnder the old version, the time limits ran concurrently, totaling 180 days. The new bill has windows that run consecutively, pausing these transactions for 135 days.\nOwners who fail to abide by COPA and sell their building to someone who is not a \u201cqualified entity,\u201d will be on the hook for a fine equal to at least 3 percent of the purchase price.\nEven some proponents of the bill aren\u2019t happy with this latest version.\nKenny Burgos, CEO of New York Apartment Association, said focusing on distressed properties will lead to fewer deals and make it harder for tenants looking to purchase buildings (by working with a nonprofit) due to the extent of repairs and debt on these properties. If the bill passes in its current form, he believes it will simply delay transactions.\n\u201cI just think the bill is losing its original intent in giving tenants the opportunity to purchase,\u201d he said.\nOther cities\n(including Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Chicago) have adopted similar policies, providing the right of first offer and/or refusal to nonprofits or a building\u2019s tenants. In New York, the state legislature is also considering a Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, or TOPA, which would give tenants first dibs on buying their building.\nA version of COPA was introduced in the City Council in 2020 and has been the subject of multiple hearings,\nmost recently\nin June. At that time, the NYAA pointed to San Francisco\u2019s COPA policy, which gives nonprofits 30 days to exercise their right of first refusal, as a potentially more reasonable timeframe.\nTime is running out for yet another version of the bill to emerge. The last City Council meeting of the year is slated for Dec. 18.\nThe success of San Francisco\u2019s version and other COPA policies relies on a consistent stream of funding being available for nonprofits. Spisak noted that New York City\u2019s bill would go into effect one year after becoming law, giving time for the program to be factored into next year\u2019s budget.\nThe Adams administration also recently\nrelaunched\nthe Neighborhood Pillars program, which could help buyers under COPA finance building rehabs.\nSome have reservations about whether HPD could handle the administrative burden of ensuring buildings comply with COPA.\nErica Buckley, a partner at Nixon Peabody, thinks before a sweeping bill like COPA is enacted, HPD should launch a voluntary pilot program to test it out. She noted that Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, who called for COPA\u2019s passage, could create a program that allows the agency to figure out the staffing levels required and includes a term sheet that would help line up public financing for these deals.\nShe said the program could also incorporate more direct efforts to encourage homeownership among tenants.\nTesting out this model before approving COPA citywide could also give the city, nonprofits and owners time to better understand the complexity of such deals. Buckley has worked on a few deals where a nonprofit is buying a building, with the intent of eventually turning ownership over to tenants.\n\u201cThey are incredibly expensive, and they take a lot more time than you think,\u201d she said.\n",

PCCP and U.S. Bank provided the debt for the project, which will unfurl along the Gowanus Canal.\nA JLL Capital Markets team including Christopher Peck, Winfield Clifford and Kellogg Gaines arranged the debt.\nThe 22-story project is sited to the west of the canal\u2019s northern end. It will include 225 market-rate apartments and 75 affordable units; the development was approved under the 421a affordable housing program prior to its lapse.\nThere will also be 30,000 square feet of commercial space and ground-floor retail, which will connect to a planned seven-acre esplanade. The development is expected to be completed by the last quarter of 2027.\nProjects continue to pop up in Gowanus, which was rezoned four years ago to unlock mixed-use developments where manufacturing hubs once reigned. At the time, city officials estimated that the\n82-block rezoning\nwould enable the construction of more than 8,500 apartments, 3,000 of which would be reserved for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers.\nGowanus was one of the Bill de Blasio administration\u2019s largest upzonings. Developers have responded in kind by trying to take advantage of the neighborhood\u2019s revitalization into a residential hub.\nLast month, David Tabak purchased a 38,500-square-foot development site at 563 Sackett Street in Gowanus\nfor $58.5 million\n. He\u2019s planning a 12-story, 350-unit residential building.\nMeanwhile, Monadnock \u2014 along with the Gotham Organization and nonprofit Christian Cultural Center \u2014 landed\na $315 million loan\nin the spring for their affordable housing project in East New York.

The school completed the purchase with funding entirely provided by the state\u2019s Higher Education Student Housing Grant Program. The total budget for the purchase was approximately $168.1 million, including the debt needed to pay off bonds required to help finance the project.\nAn affiliate of Throckmorton Partners sold the property, at 184 South Market Street.\nThrockmorton bought the building\n, a 264-room\ntower part of the Signia by Hilton San Jose hotel\n, in 2023 for $73.1 million. The Signia hotel remains open across the Paseo in a large building with 541 rooms. Throckmorton undertook the conversion of one of Signia\u2019s towers into student housing for SJSU attendees, opening the property as Spartan Village on The Paseo\nin August 2024\n.\nMill Valley-based Throckmorton Partners previously leased the tower to San Jose State University and agreed to give SJSU the option to buy and own the future student housing building. The handover of Spartan Village on The Paseo marks \u201cthe culmination of a landmark collaboration\u201d between Throckmorton and the university, SJSU President Cynthia Teniente-Matson said.\nSpartan Village on The Paseo rises 13 stories in downtown San Jose above the Paseo de San Antonio pedestrian mall. The tower can accommodate at least 679 student beds with a maximum capacity of 811 beds. A sky bridge lounge remains a popular gathering spot for students, connecting directly to the second floor, which has several dining options for students.\nIt\u2019s the latest vote of confidence in San Jose\u2019s central business district as a hub for SJSU students. Last year, Amcal Housing and Swenson secured a\n$150 million refinancing deal\nfor their 19-story The Grad San Jose student housing complex. That development, a 260-unit high-rise at 88 East San Carlos Street, is just a few blocks away from Spartan Village on The Paseo.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Texas State University is bringing a long-discussed hospitality anchor to its San Marcos campus, approving a $40 million boutique hotel that Houston-based Midway will build with a 75-year ground lease.\nThe university\u2019s Board of Regents signed off on the development agreement Nov. 20, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n, granting\nMidway\ncontrol of a 3-acre site at 429 North Guadalupe Street with options for two 10-year extensions. The parcel once housed the school\u2019s Richard A. Castro Undergraduate Admissions Center and sits just north of downtown, positioning the project to pull double duty for campus and\ncity\nevents.\nPlans call for a 120,000-square-foot, full-service hotel with at least 130 rooms and a slate of amenities rarely found in the area: an event lawn and amphitheater, restaurant and bar, pool and courtyard and modern meeting spaces. Regents said the project will be the only full-service hotel of its kind near downtown San Marcos, giving the school more flexibility in hosting state and national conferences, while also feeding local tourism at a time when the metro is bulging with growth.\nSan Marcos\n, roughly 30 miles south of\nAustin\n, now counts close to 75,000 residents, and Texas State enrolls about 40,000 students. University officials pitched the hotel as overdue for a downtown that has struggled to keep pace with regional demand.\n\u201cSan Marcos is long overdue for a true, full-service, top-of-the-line hotel and restaurant in the heart of downtown,\u201d Eric Algoe, the university\u2019s vice president for operations and CFO, said in a news release.\nMidway, which has completed comparable projects in College Station, secured city and county incentives earlier this year. The city of San Marcos approved a $9.1 million package paid out over 10 installments, with no property tax rebates but significant returns on other fronts: a 95 percent rebate on sales taxes and hotel occupancy taxes that phases down over time, as well as a rebate on construction sales taxes. The city will require Midway to invest at least $40 million, start construction by the end of 2026 and finish within 30 months.\nOfficials estimate the hotel will generate $2.4 million in city property taxes over the first decade and $456,000 in retained sales taxes. The hotel occupancy tax rebate could reach $7.3 million, with the city keeping another $1.8 million. The incentive agreement runs 15 years from completion, after which Midway can sell its interest to a public entity without paying the incentives back.\nAustin-based New Waterloo will operate the hotel, adding to a portfolio that includes South Congress Hotel and Hotel Ella.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Vienna waits for you, but savvy luxury homebuyers realized that they should wait out the initial ask on Billy Joel\u2019s Centre Island home.\nThe legendary crooner knocked $5 million off the listing at 502 Centre Island Road on Long Island, Newsday\nreported\n. Listed for\n$29.9 million\nin May, the massive home in the Oyster Bay hamlet can instead be had for $25 million today, or $1,250 per square foot.\nBerkshire Hathaway HomeServices Laffey International Realty chief executive officer Emmett Laffey referred to the price cut as a \u201cslight adjustment,\u201d though it dropped a sixth off the listing.\nPart of the former MiddleSea compound had already been slashed, literally. In May, a North Shore couple purchased the five-bedroom, four-bathroom gatehouse for $7 million.\nBut there\u2019s still plenty to be had on the 14-acre estate. The 20,000-square-foot home includes five bedrooms, eight bathrooms and 180-degree views of the Long Island Sound. The property also has a spa, a ballroom, a wine cellar and a guest house with a bowling alley.\nThe grounds aren\u2019t too shabby either, complete with a beach house, pool, private dock, tennis court, six-car garage and a helipad.\nJoel purchased the property for $22.5 million in 2002. During lengthy renovations on the estate, Joel moved out to the gatehouse and never returned to living in the main home.\nShould Joel leave Oyster Bay, the Hicksville-born artist has another place to go on Long Island: in late 2023, he\nspent $10.7 million\nto purchase 143 Town Lane in East Hampton.\nLast October, meanwhile, Joel sold his oceanfront Manalapan mansion\nfor $42.6 million\n, after listing the estate on and off for six years. He also just sold a two-bedroom condo on Elizabeth Street in Manhattan for $4.5 million to his daughter, Alexa Joel, according to\nRealtor.com\n.\nAn HBO documentary on Joel aired over the summer, but he\u2019s paused his live performances while battling a brain disorder.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A public-private partnership between Boca Raton,\nDavid Martin\u2019s Terra\nand the Frisbie family\u2019s Frisbie Group to redevelop the coastal city\u2019s government campus has erupted into an impassioned debate over how, exactly, public land should be used, sold and leased.\nBut a judge just threw a wrench in local efforts to drastically overhaul these processes.\nSince Terra and Frisbie\u2019s One Boca proposal\nwon the project bid\nin February, a vocal contingent of Boca Raton residents have organized against it under the banner of Save Boca, led by resident Jonathan Pearlman.\nSave Boca collected more than 7,000 signatures opposing the redevelopment and securing a referendum to amend Boca Raton\u2019s city charter and municipal code. The amendments would require referendums to decide whether Boca Raton could lease or sell any public land larger than 0.5 acres, something its proponents said would protect public land and that opponents decried as gumming up crucial city management processes.\nOn Monday, Palm Beach County Judge Joseph Curley ruled that the referendums were unconstitutional, citing precedent that ruled electorates do not have authority to subject city council action to referendum.\nLocal attorney Ned Kimmelman sued Save Boca and Pearlman in early October, seeking an emergency injunction to block the referendums.\n\u201cSave Boca and Pearlman are conducting an audacious scheme to evade Florida law and abuse our electoral process in Palm Beach County and the City,\u201d the suit read.\nIn a curious sequence of events, Kimmelman quickly withdrew the suit, only to file it again on Oct. 31. This time, a new organization, Rescue Boca Community Initiative, filed an amicus brief in support of Kimmelman. In the brief, Rescue Boca alleged Save Boca accepted more than $40,000 in donations before registering as a political committee.\nParties on all sides of the issue have alleged others are spreading misinformation, including at the Tuesday city council meeting. At the meeting, the council approved ballot language for the March referendum on One Boca, which only concerns approval of the project.\nPearlman asserted that while Judge Curley granted the injunction, the suit is ongoing and Save Boca is still pursuing the changes to the city charter and municipal code.\nTerra and Frisbie have\nwhittled down the scope of One Boca\nconsiderably in recent months, with the plan consisting now of just 7.6 acres, down from 15.4.\n",

The developer\u2019s proposal calls for 449 one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments, with 45 of them designated for low-income households.\nBy including deed-restricted affordable units in the development, Vista\u2019s project is eligible for density bonus incentives, which will allow the developer to build a larger structure than zoning rules would typically allow. The project, designed by Ovalle Architects, would rise in a podium-style building of six to eight stories. The structure would be built atop a parking garage with capacity for 815 vehicles.\nConstruction is slated to begin in February, according to an environmental report tied to the project. It\u2019s expected to wrap in September 2028.\nThe development is the latest to be proposed near Del Amo Fashion Center.\nLegacy Partners\nand DWS Group, for example, are building 200 apartments at 3863 West Carson Street for the Soto development, which will replace a surface parking lot. Lennar, meanwhile, is\nbuilding 260 townhomes\non a 16-acre site at 3405 West Carson Street and 21405-21515 Madrona Avenue for a development known as Fashion Square at Del Amo.\nAnother fully entitled development site in Torrance came under new ownership over the summer and is similarly in the midst of construction. CGI+ Real Estate Strategies\nsold the 4.9-acre location\nat 22107-22127 Vermont Avenue in Torrance to JPI for $40 million. In 2023, the Los Angeles County Development Authority approved a 525-unit housing project for the site known as The Bungalows on Vermont Avenue.

        "content": "Billionaire\nKen Griffin\nlanded a buyer for his penthouse at Park Tower, selling his last holdout of listed Chicago property three years after he headed south.\nThe 67th floor unit at 800 North Michigan Avenue is under contract with an undisclosed buyer, with a $12.5 million listing price. The six-bedroom, seven bathroom Streeterville condo spans 9,250 square feet.\nGriffin, the Citadel founder, left Chicago and moved his business to\nMiami in 2022\n, citing concerns about crime in Chicago. He has been\noffloading his portfolio\nof downtown properties in the years since. Forbes pegs his net worth at $49.8 billion.\nIf $12.5 million is the final closing price on the penthouse, it would be the most expensive sale for a single condo in downtown Chicago in at least three years, as the area has struggled to gain its footing since its pandemic-era heights.\nGov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s\ncombined purchase in November 2024 of two units from Griffin at 9 West Walton Street for $19 million was the only recent sale with a higher price.\nSusan Miner of Premier Relocation and Real Estate Services, the listing agent on the Park Tower condo, did not return a request for comment.\nGriffin sold the 66th-floor penthouse, below the 67th floor penthouse, at Park Tower to\nGeorge Lucas in 2023\nfor $11.2 million, taking a loss on the $15 million he paid for the unit in 2012. Lucas and his wife, Mellody Hobson, bought the unit to combine it with their 65th-floor penthouse that they bought in 2015.\nGriffin also sold the top four floors at No. 9 West Walton \u2014 including the sale to Pritzker \u2014 over the last year for a combined $35 million, losing more than $20 million from his 2017 purchase price for the units.\nThe 67th-floor condo at Park Tower was listed in 2022 asking $15.75 million. It was on and off the market at the same price in the years since then, and was last taken off the market in July. On Wednesday, the listing went back up, showing it was under contract at the new $12.5 million price.\nThe sale would mark one of a string of condo sales in Chicago this year after a long slump in recent years. Property prices have tanked as concerns about crime and work-from-home norms have kept buyers out of downtown. Buyers have been showing more interest in downtown luxury properties, but they are still selling well below their sale prices of two or three years ago.\nOther recent downtown sales include a 79th-floor St. Regis condo that sold for $7.5 million, and another at that building that Siri co-founder Dag Kittlaus purchased for $9.25 million. Former Chicago Bulls star Zach LaVine sold his 28th-floor condo at 9 West Walton in November for $6.4 million, taking a half-million dollar loss on the unit from his purchase price in 2022.\nThis most recent pending penthouse sale would land Griffin a better return than his other Chicago selloffs. He paid $6.9 million for the condo in 2000, representing a roughly 80 percent gain over the past 25 years.\n",

        "content": "A home on San Francisco\u2019s Billionaires\u2019 Row that has sat on the market unclaimed for the past two years has finally closed escrow.\nThe century-plus-old luxury home at 2898 Broadway sold for nearly $17.8 million, down from its most recent listing price of $26 million, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nThe seller was technology investor Jim Willenborg and his wife Barbara, who purchased it in 1988 for $3.4 million and revamped the manse with extensive renovations over the years. The buyer has not been disclosed. The Willenborgs first listed the home in 2023 for $32 million and later\ndropped the asking price to $26 million\n.\nIn the two years afterward, the\nSan Francisco luxury housing market\nremained in post-pandemic doldrums before an upswing this year. As artificial intelligence firms flock to San Francisco and the Bay Area at large, so too do the number of executives and employees looking for high-end places to live \u2014 so much so that there\u2019s now a\nshortage of mansions\nin the city for those buyers.\n\u201cWhat a difference 808 days makes,\u201d Compass listing agent Max Armour told the Business Times. \u201cWe\u2019ve moved from forecasts of decline to one of the strongest luxury cycles I\u2019ve seen in years, driven by AI, rising markets and renewed confidence in San Francisco.\u201d\nThe Broadway home was completed in 1899 and survived the 1906 earthquake, which destroyed nearly all of the city, with little damage. It was later featured in films like 1960\u2019s \u201cPortrait in Black\u201d featuring Lana Turner and 1985\u2019s \u201cJagged Edge\u201d starring Glenn Close, Jeff Bridges and Robert Loggia.\nThe mansion also twice served as the\nSan Francisco Decorator Showcase home\nin 1989 and 2024, with more than 20,000 visitors shuffling through the home each time. The five-level mansion boasts more than 11,000 square feet of living space, complete with 10 bedrooms, six bathrooms, eight fireplaces, two laundry rooms, a garden, wine storage capabilities and three storerooms.\nBillionaires\u2019 Row has seen an uptick in high-profile sales activity compared to recent years, according to Armour. Last month, the most expensive home in the city this year sold at 2930 Broadway\nfor $42 million\n; that followed the $26.5 million sale of 2900 Broadway next door to the Willenborgs\u2019 2898 Broadway, in the spring.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "North Texas developer Rex Glendenning secured a $17.5 million construction loan for part of his\nKing Place\ndevelopment in Celina.\nThrough his G-Man Development LLC, Glendenning borrowed the funds from Louisiana-based b1Bank for a 78-acre lot of the King Place tract on Tuesday, according to public records.\nThe King Place subdivision, platted in 2023, officially spans over 400 acres just west of\nCelina\n, one of a few small towns along the Dallas North Tollway that are quickly swelling with the Metroplex\u2019s northward growth. Other parcels adjoining King Place bring the total size of the area under Glendenning\u2019s ownership to 600 acres.\nThe 78-acre lot secured by the loan is Block C, the southwesternmost of three blocks in the King Place plat. It abuts Dallas North Tollway and FM 428, recently named Glendenning Parkway. Unofficial plats don\u2019t specify how the land will be used, but the development overall will include retail, offices, hotels and hundreds of single-family homes.\nThis financing is Glendenning\u2019s largest loan on the King Place project in Collin County records so far.\nGlendenning\u2019s company, Rex Real Estate, has plans for nearby sites as well. The company is selling several mixed-use, commercial and retail plots within a few miles of King Place along the DNT and Glendenning Parkway.\nRex Real Estate did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nA Celina native, Glendenning has turned his holdings into some of the most noteworthy real estate deals in North Texas during his 40-year career, including the sale of The Star, the multibillion-dollar mixed-use headquarters of the Dallas Cowboys. His family\u2019s land history began with a grant to his great-grandfather in the 19th century, the 160-acre germ of a now-vast operation.\nKing Place,\nwhich may become the site of Rex Real Estate\u2019s headquarters\n, is Glendenning\u2019s own contribution to a crowded pool of developments near Celina.\nSeitz Group\n,\nHillwood\n,\nCedarwood\n, the\nCelina Economic Development Corporation\n, Jerry Jones\u2019\nBlue Star Land\n, and\nGlendenning\u2019s occasional partner Mehrdad Moayedi\nhave all begun residential or commercial projects in the area.\n",

        "content": "Steve Croman is at risk of losing his home, but not without putting up a fight first.\nCroman, a\nnow-notorious landlord\n, allegedly defaulted on a $31 million loan connected to the Upper East Side house he shares with his wife and son. Now, the lender is trying to sell off equity interests in the property later this month, while Croman is arguing the process has gone awry.\nIt\u2019s the latest skirmish in Croman\u2019s legal battle with lenders, who are together trying to foreclose on more than $231 million in loan principal. In the background is\nhis fight with his father,\nEdward Croman, who is hoping to dissolve the family partnerships, alleging mismanagement.\nSteven, Edward and Harriet Croman bought the building at 12 East 72nd Street in 2002 through a shell company for $5.5 million, according to\ncontemporaneous reporting\nfrom the New York Times. The property was a six-story multifamily building at the time, off Fifth Avenue, but Croman was able to boot tenants out of its 23 rent-stabilized units and renovate the building into a personal mansion.\nInitial plans for the home included two pools, a koi pond, a basketball court, six wet bars and two fireplaces, according to contemporaneous reporting from the\nNew York Observer\n. However, it\u2019s unclear to what extent these plans were completed.\nThe now-single-family home is currently valued at $53 million and is more than 15,000 square feet, according to city records. In 2023, Croman\u2019s company took out a $31 million loan from Axos Bank backed by the property, as well as the family\u2019s membership interests in the borrower.\nBy the next year, the loan was in default. In a court filing, Croman blamed the legal dispute with his father for the inability to service or refinance the loan. The lender is planning to sell the membership interests on December 11 in a UCC sale.\nSteve and Harriet Croman, however, are arguing in court that their home is unique and valuable, and a quick sale process will depress what the lender can recover at the sale. The lender isn\u2019t properly advertising the property, they said, and is putting up barriers that will limit public interest, like mandatory nondisclosure agreements. They\u2019re asking the court to pause the sale and issue a preliminary injunction.\nArguments like this are common in UCC sales, and hinge on the requirement that a sale be \u201ccommercially reasonable.\u201d\nThe lender in the case, NYC Multifamily Portfolio LLC, is connected to Dalan Real Estate. The company purchased\n$140 million of Croman-connected loans\nlast year from Axos Bank and has since filed several foreclosure suits.\nA lawyer for the defendant didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment, but told the court that putting a stop to the sale is neither \u201cnecessary nor appropriate.\u201d\nCroman is also named as a defendant in\n28 other foreclosure cases\n, related to loans totaling more than $231 million in principal. Twenty-one of those suits were brought by Orange Owner LLC, associated with Bellwether Asset Management. In October, the entity bought loans tied to\n49 Croman buildings\nfor $247 million from Flagstar Bank, according to Traded.\nCroman is one of the few New York landlords to have been sent to prison for real estate-related crimes. Once named one of the city\u2019s worst landlords, Croman served eight months in state prison related to mortgage and tax fraud and paid $8 million in restitution related to accusations of tenant harassment.\nMatthew Ethan Hearle, an attorney with Goldberg Weprin Finkel Goldstein who is representing the Cromans in the dispute, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "A developer scaled back his plan for a 500-unit project with mostly apartments near Naranja to a 245 townhome complex, citing higher demand for larger homes.\nAttorney Gus Deribeaux, through two entities, wants to develop the townhomes on a 17.3-acre mostly vacant site on the southwest corner of Old Dixie Highway and Southwest 280th Street in unincorporated Miami-Dade County, according to an application filed to the county late last month.\nThe site consists of the vacant lots at 28030 and 28240 Old Dixie Highway, and 15450 Southwest 280th Street, and the lot at 28105 Southwest 157th Avenue that now has a single-family home.\nDesigned by Pascual, Perez, Kiliddjian, Starr &amp; Associates, the complex would consist of two-story buildings with five townhomes. The homes will range from two-bedrooms to four-bedroom townhomes.\nThe switch of plans is due to more demand for south Miami-Dade housing from families, who generally seek bigger homes, said Ben Fernandez, the attorney who filed the application on behalf of Deribeaux.\nLast year, Deribeaux scored county approval for a project up to eight-stories with 500 units, which would have consisted of 424 multifamily units and 76 townhomes, according to the application.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not often that you have a decrease in density like that,\u201d Fernandez said.\nIt\u2019s unclear if the townhomes will be for rent or for sale.\nDeribeaux didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment.\nRecords show Deribeaux\u2019s entities paid a combined $2.2 million in three deals in 2018, 2021 and last year for the vacant lots. He is under contract to purchase the single-family home lot, Fernandez said.\nSouth Miami-Dade has become a magnet for developers due to its healthy supply of buildable land that sells at a discount from sites in Miami\u2019s urban core. Over the past half-decade, developers have seized on this, filing a flurry of proposed projects.\nMiami-based homebuilding giant Lennar, which is the nation\u2019s second largest homebuilder, far outpaces its counterparts. It has delivered 8,430 single-family houses and townhomes in south Miami-Dade, or nearly\n70 percent\nof all such units built in the past five years, according to Colliers Research. Lennar also is developing almost 60 percent of the housing stock under construction.\nBrothers Salim and Kamil Chraibi\u2019s Miami-based Bluenest Development has emerged as one of the top workforce housing developers in south Miami-Dade. The firm\u2019s portfolio consists of 1,000 completed homes and a pipeline of\nanother 3,000\n.\nIn Princeton, one of south Dade\u2019s neighborhoods, Miami-based Paxton Development Group wants to develop the 230-unit\nLegacy Park\naffordable rental complex at 13850 Southwest 248th Street.\nAtlantic Pacific Companies and the Archdiocese of Miami proposed a\n600-unit affordable apartment complex\nat 28520 Southwest 148th Avenue, adjacent to St. Martin de Porres Catholic Church in Leisure City.\n",

        "content": "As developers continue to blame\nMeasure ULA\nfor choking multifamily construction across Los Angeles, more players are signing on to a renewed opposition campaign to the transfer tax.\nWhile developers are still confident in development in the region, the citywide tax has partially led many apartment developers to look outside L.A. city limits, coinciding with a dip in apartment construction overall, Bisnow\nreported\n. Now, a signature drive spearheaded by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association to put a repeal measure on the November 2026 ballot is gaining momentum.\nDevelopers are \u201cvery much bullish on L.A. County, but not so much on the City of L.A., and it\u2019s a complex set of reasons,\u201d\nKamran Paydar\n, a CBRE broker and partner, told the publication. \u201cULA is a piece of it. Interest rates, which have risen, are also a big component, then add to that the different housing policies that are being supported by different municipalities.\u201d\nA University of California, Los Angeles, report this year found that approximately 1,900 units each year have gone unbuilt since the measure was adopted in 2023. Another study cited by Bisnow found that commercial transactions fell between 30 and 50 percent in the two years since Measure ULA\u2019s adoption. In 2022,\nLos Angeles permitted a total of 23,422 residential units\nthat count toward the state requirements for housing, or 5.1 percent of its state-mandated goal; by contrast, last year, the city permitted 17,195 residential units, or 3.8 percent of its state-ordered goal.\nSimply put, \u201cThe math ain\u2019t mathing\u201d for developers, Chris Tourtellotte, managing director at LaTerra Development, previously\ntold\nThe Real Deal\nabout developing new apartment buildings in the City of Los Angeles. Many multifamily investors have followed suit and\nshifted their interests\noutside of the city, thereby depriving many developers of crucial funding. In the third quarter alone, fewer than 19,000 apartments were under construction in Los Angeles, representing a 30 percent drop from three years ago, per CoStar data\ncited\nby the Los Angeles Times.\n\u201cBuyers and sellers are absolutely disgruntled over ULA, and it is not going away. It\u2019s actually getting worse every day,\u201d\nAaron Kirman\n, CEO of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California,\nsaid\nat\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s Building Back L.A. roundtable in September. \u201cIt\u2019s the crux of the issues today when we\u2019re selling anything residential, even commercial. It comes up and it really has probably stopped 50 percent of the deals, maybe even more.\u201d\nWhether Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association\u2019s Measure ULA opposition referendum makes it to the ballot remains to be seen. For now, the organization is\ncollecting\nsignatures to put the issue before voters next fall.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Anne M. Burke, the retired chief justice of the Illinois Supreme Court and wife of disgraced former Ald. Ed Burke, bought a Lake Shore Drive condominium in Chicago for a little over $1 million.\nThe deal, recorded Nov. 12, marks a rare move outside the 14th Ward for a figure who has lived there since her husband first won office in 1969. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat the deed lists only Anne Burke for the condo at 850 North Lake Shore Drive, with Ed Burke absent from the document. He was released in July from federal prison into community confinement after serving less than half of a 24-month sentence tied to his\nconviction\non 13 felony counts, including racketeering, bribery and extortion.\nThe sale record shows Anne Burke\u2019s prior address as the couple\u2019s custom home on 51st Street in Chicago, completed in the early 2000s and still owned by the pair. The property isn\u2019t publicly listed.\nA court spokesperson told the outlet that the couple are simply \u201ctwo older people looking to downsize to a smaller space.\u201d\nTheir new condo \u2014 a two-bedroom, two-bathroom unit with roughly 1,740 square feet \u2014 sits in a 19-story 1920s building that Florida-based multifamily developer\nCrescent Heights\nbegan converting to condos after buying it last year. The sale price amounts to about $580 per square foot. The structure\u2019s long, varied history includes stints as an elite athletic club and a Northwestern University dorm.\nThe move caps a storied legal and civic career for Anne Burke that began well before she entered the judiciary. She co-founded the\nSpecial Olympics\nin 1968 alongside Eunice Kennedy Shriver, a contribution later lauded by the American Academy for Park &amp; Recreation Administration as the \u201creal spark plug\u201d behind the program\u2019s launch. After becoming a lawyer in 1983, she rose quickly, becoming the first woman appointed to the Illinois Court of Claims in 1987 and later securing a seat on the state Supreme Court in 2006. She won two full terms and served as chief justice from 2019 to 2022 before retiring.\nHer husband, once one of Chicago\u2019s most powerful aldermen, was convicted in 2023 on charges stemming from\nstrong-arming developers\nfor legal work, pressuring business owners over permits and leaning on Field Museum officials for an internship for a child of one of his friends,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported. His sentencing followed a decades-long run that shaped City Hall machine politics.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A beleaguered Far North Dallas office tower is getting a reset after landing a New York buyer with deep real estate lineage.\nArthur Zeckendorf and his firm, AZ Family Partners, placed the winning all-cash bid for Preston Plaza, a 10-story, 259,000-square-foot building on 6.3 acres at 17950 Preston Road that hit the auction block last month. The Nov. 10\u201312 auction, marketed by Cushman &amp; Wakefield, began at $2.25 million, or $8.65 per square foot, though Zeckendorf didn\u2019t disclose his final offer. The deal is expected to close within two weeks,\naccording\nto the Dallas Business Journal. It will mark the firm\u2019s first office acquisition in the city.\nPreston Plaza\nhas been stuck in a financial spiral for years. With occupancy down to about 35 percent and losses mounting, a receiver signaled in mid-2024 that the property could be forced into a sale. Significant debt added pressure, and by late October the tower was being pitched as a redevelopment candidate with potential for apartments, a hotel or retail.\nZeckendorf\nisn\u2019t biting. He told the outlet that he plans to keep the 1980s building as offices, arguing Dallas \u2014 especially areas north of downtown \u2014 remains one of the strongest office markets in the country. He called the asset a long-term family investment and said the building\u2019s fundamentals, including its Preston Road frontage and proximity to Richardson, Addison and Plano, remain solid.\nThe tower last saw significant upgrades in 2015, including a refreshed lobby, conference center and fitness area. Now AZ Family Partners plans to inject another $10 million to $14 million into improvements, ranging from new office buildouts and elevator equipment to a redesigned lobby and potentially an on-site restaurant.\nZeckendorf\nhired Garrison Jones to lead a landscaping overhaul aimed at turning the sprawling parking area into something closer to a shaded park.\nThe firm also studied residential conversion costs, but determined a reset office strategy made more sense at the tower\u2019s current basis. Leasing will be handled by Dallas-based Forge Commercial, with a target occupancy of 75 percent to 80 percent.\nZeckendorf\ntold the outlet that he\u2019s seen early interest from family offices and law firms, giving him confidence that a stabilized owner with fresh capital can reposition the tower.\nThe upbeat posture mirrors broader bullishness around Dallas\u2019 fundamentals, as major employers expand and the Urban Land Institute again ranks Dallas\u2013Fort Worth the nation\u2019s top real estate market to watch.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "This Friday marks the one-year anniversary of the City Council approving City of Yes for Housing Opportunity.\nTime flies when you are\u2026overhauling a zoning code that hasn\u2019t been significantly changed since 1961?\nThe Council approved the text amendment last Dec. 5, which made several changes, including eliminating minimum parking mandates for new construction in parts of the city, legalizing accessory dwelling units, expanding the types of buildings eligible for office-to-residential conversions and creating new higher-density residential districts that can be mapped throughout the city.\nFor a refresher, here\u2019s a\ncheatsheet\nwith details on the biggest changes.\nSince the City Council\u2019s approval, the text amendment has\nsurvived\na legal challenge (though the groups suing appealed the case\u2019s dismissal), and voters have\napproved\na set of other changes aimed at speeding up housing approvals.\nThe full impact of these changes will not be known for some time, but we\u2019ve already seen some results. Air rights transfers this year are\non track\nto reach the highest level seen since 2016, according to PropertyScout. The City of Yes allowed owners of landmarked properties to sell their development rights to more properties.\nCity Planning says that more than 12,000 homes resulting from office-to-residential conversions are in the pipeline, of which more than 3,000 are permanently affordable units. It\u2019s unclear how many of these changes are the direct result of City of Yes, though.\nCity of Yes created two new residential zoning districts, known as R11 and R12. These districts, when mapped, respectively allow residential floor area ratios of 15 and 18. So far, the districts have been used in the\nMidtown South\nrezoning, but have been proposed at individual sites, including at\n395 Flatbush Avenue Extension\nin Downtown Brooklyn and\na site above\nthe Second Avenue subway extension (which is coming up for a subcommittee and committee vote on Thursday).\nFriday also marks the end of a period in which projects were grandfathered in under certain rules that changed after City of Yes. For example, projects for which a permit application was filed before Dec. 5, 2024, and that the Department of Buildings approved before Dec. 5, 2025, can participate in the city\u2019s Voluntary Inclusionary Housing (VIH) program, rather than the Universal Affordability Preference (UAP).\nCity of Yes replaced the density bonus program VIH with UAP. The former provides a more generous density bump than UAP: VIH provides up to 3.5 square feet for every square foot of affordable space, while developers under UAP can only add as much space equal to the affordable square footage. The new program also requires deeper affordability.\nIn other words, there was an incentive to ensure your project is eligible for VIH.\nThe city\nreleased\napplications for UAP in April and\nopened\napplications for accessory dwelling units in September.\nAs I\u2019ve previously\nreported\n, developers are still figuring out how changes under City of Yes work with existing city programs and systems. It will be up to the next administration to oversee the continued rollout of the policies.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat do you think has been the biggest effect of City of Yes so far?\nSend a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nAirport lounges are in high demand. There are more than 3,500 airport lounges in the world,\naccording to the New Yorker\n.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nNearly 100 bills hit Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s desk on Monday, meaning that she has until next Friday to act on the measures,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. Including the 93 bills on her desk, Hochul has some 250 measures to act on.\n\u2014\nBrrrrrr! Temperatures in the city are forecasted to be in the upper 20s and lower 30s on Friday,\nGothamist reports\n. But, thanks to wind chill, it is going to feel like it is in the teens. Stay safe out there.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$40 million\nfor a 5,375-square-foot condominium unit at 443 Greenwich in Tribeca. Noble Black, Matthew B. Mackay and Cory Cahlon with Corcoran\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$133 million\nfor 115 West 40th Street in Midtown. Clarion Partners sold the 304,345-square-foot, 22-floor office building to AM Property Holding Corp.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$36 million\nfor an 8,800-square-foot condo at 445 Lafayette Street in Noho. Zack Sosne and Craig Roth with Next Stop NY have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 94,348-square-foot, 17-story residential building at 515 West 43rd Street in Hell\u2019s Kitchen. Manish Chadha with Ismael Leyva Architects filed the permit on behalf of City Builders.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

Onex constructed the 14-acre complex with original partner Muss Development, buying Muss out a year before the sale to Blackstone.\nIn 2021, Morgan Stanley originated\na $285 million loan\nfor the property, securitized into a single-asset commercial-mortgage-backed securities transaction. The refinancing replaced $306 million in existing debt provided by Morgan Stanley in 2016. Blackstone also agreed to contribute an additional $45 million in equity to the deal.\nTPG recently\nraised $2.1 billion\nfor its Real Estate Credit Opportunities fund, exceeding a $1.5 billion target. The fund has deployed $426 million worth of equity investments in more than a dozen assets across the country, mostly in the multifamily and industrial sectors.\nAs for Acadia, the Westchester-based firm sold 640 Broadway in Noho to German investor Pamera North America\nfor $49.5 million\nin September.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The company is planning hubs in Miami Executive Airport, Miami International Airport, Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport, Boca Raton Airport, Palm Beach International Airport and Stuart Witham Field Airport.\nArcher will also utilize helipads at Ross\u2019\nHard Rock Stadium\nand his Apogee Golf Club. Vertiports, which are similar to helipads, are being planned in West Palm Beach, the Magic City Innovation District in Miami\u2019s Little Haiti and North Bay Village, according to a news release and published reports.\nThe longest routes in the planned network will take about 30 minutes, according to the\nWall Street Journal\n.\nArcher plans to use its Midnight model in the South Florida network, which has seating for four passengers, a pilot and luggage. Pricing information isn\u2019t yet available, but was compared to pricing for high-end ride services like Uber Black by Archer\u2019s head of government affairs, Melissa McCaffrey. From Miami to West Palm Beach, that\u2019ll typically run about $200.\nIt\u2019s a service that could transform a growing region handicapped by gridlock traffic.\nWhen the network will be operational is dependent on approval from the Federal Aviation Administration, which has yet to certify Archer\u2019s air taxis for commercial use. Its eVTOL aircraft are the first new category considered by the FAA in almost 80 years.\nArcher is also planning air taxi networks in New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Abu Dhabi.\nIt\u2019s not the only eVTOL maker targeting South Florida.

        "content": "End of an era? Maybe.\nHilton &amp; Hyland\u2019s sign has come off the Standard Oil building in Beverly Hills, with the high-end brokerage beginning a move to smaller offices within the city.\nThe relocation comes after the company\u2019s soon-to-be former landlord, Standard Oil Investment Group, took the brokerage to\ncourt\nover more than\n$650,000 in back rent\nand over $65,000 in late fees before asking a judge to toss the complaint last month.\nDespite the now-settled court drama, Hilton &amp; Hyland Chair Lori Hyland told\nThe Real Deal\nin a call Wednesday the move has nothing to do with the court case.\n\u201cWe have a very good relationship [with the landlord] and it has absolutely nothing to do with our business,\u201d she said of the decision to relocate.\nShe also slammed market chatter earlier this year that placed the brokerage on the sales block, waving off any consideration of a future deal.\n\u201cYou know\u2026 we live in a very, tight community,\u201d Hyland said. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in Beverly Hills all my life. I went to grammar school here. I know it very well. Everybody has something to say and it\u2019s not necessarily true.\u201d\nThe move could serve as a fresh start for the brokerage, which had inked a 10-year lease for 15,000 square feet at the Standard Oil Building at 257 North Canon Drive in 2015.\nIt moved into the building three years later.\nHyland said she expects the business to be shifted over to its new location at Maple Plaza at 345 North Maple Drive, and at full operations by Monday. The move shrinks Hilton &amp; Hyland\u2019s footprint to about 5,000 square feet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just huge,\u201d Hyland said of offices it leaves behind on Canon Drive, \u201cand we don\u2019t need so much square footage. Nobody occupies that much space right now.\u201d\nThe brokerage counted over 100 agents and staffers when Hilton &amp; Hyland \u2014 founded by Hyland\u2019s late husband, Jeff Hyland, and Rick Hilton \u2014 moved into the Canon Drive office.\nIts roster is considerably smaller after years of\nagent departures\n.\nAs of Wednesday, California Department of Real Estate records show an agent and broker headcount of 25 licensed professionals.\nAmong the more recent exits was former Hilton &amp; Hyland President\nDavid Kramer\n, who decamped about a year ago to Compass, taking a\u00a0 six-person sales team with him.\u00a0 In April, former Hilton &amp; Hyland agent\nPaul Salazar\ntook three agents and an operations executive to Compass Beverly Hills. In August, broker\nSusan Pekich\nleft Hilton &amp; Hyland to join the Beverly Hills Estates.\nEven with the departures, Lori Hyland said she\u2019s intent on carrying on with the brokerage.\n\u201cI have taken Jeff\u2019s place as chairwoman of the company\u2013 I\u2019m not emeritus,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very much here, very much running the company and very much want to bring it into the future. Our name is world famous, and we operate with the same principles as we did before of integrity, ethics and our passion for Beverly Hills.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A headline-grabbing lawsuit filed four years ago against a landlord that was formerly among Chicago\u2019s largest may have been centered on a faulty premise.\nThat\u2019s the rationale behind Pangea Properties\u2019 recent request for sanctions against attorneys representing a group of tenants in a class action complaint filed in 2022.\nIn their original filing, attorneys claimed that Pangea, led by Peter Martay, had allowed its portfolio of 423 properties to rack up \u201ctens of thousands of code violations,\u201d resulting in poor living conditions that violated tenant rights. At the time, the accusations made news and cast doubt on the quality of Pangea\u2019s properties.\nA few months later, the landlord\nsold its entire portfolio\nof more than 7,200 units in Chicago to a New York-based firm, Emerald Empire, for $600 million. The sale was the largest commercial transaction in Chicago in 2022.\nBecause Emerald Empire did not take over control of the properties until after the lawsuit was filed, it is not named in the complaint.\nYears into the litigation, Pangea argues that the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys have failed to provide sufficient evidence to back up their claims, despite the company turning over tens of thousands of documents during the discovery process.\n\u201cPlaintiffs admit that they cannot produce anything that substantiates their pleaded allegations that the properties had \u2018tens of thousands\u2019 of violations. Still, plaintiffs unbelievably argue supporting [Department of Building] data exists, but they lack the technical skills to download and produce that data,\u201d the sanctions request reads.\nThe tenants\u2019 attorneys argue that they have not been able to properly analyze the records they have received during discovery and are also seeking additional documentation.\nPangea\u2019s attorneys claim that argument is likely more of a stall tactic than a legitimate rationale. They also claim that several requests from plaintiffs for substitute judges constitute another stall tactic known as \u201cjudge shopping.\u201d\nThe sanctions request goes on to add that the tenants are represented by \u201cthree different law firms, including a 1,200-attorney firm,\u201d and that \u201cit is implausible that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel lacks the technical ability to download a large data set from a public website.\u201d\nWhile disputing the trustworthiness of an allegation is typical in legal proceedings, the defendant\u2019s call for sanctions takes Pangea\u2019s defense to a new level. Not only are the company\u2019s attorneys claiming that the lawsuit is frivolous, they are also requesting that a judge essentially punish the tenants\u2019 attorneys for wasting the resources of the court system on a claim they allege the plaintiffs had no ability to back up from the beginning.\nThe attorneys representing the tenants work for Faegre Drinker Biddle &amp; Reath, Hughes Socol Piers Resnick &amp; Dym and The Legal Aid Society of Metropolitan Family Services.\nThe sanctions request also notes that records provided by Pangea show that \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s own documents indicated \u2026 the [Chicago Housing Authority] performed 7,300 inspections at the subject properties and \u2026 there were only 25 instances in which the CHA permanently terminated payments over the relevant 5.5 year time period. CHA routinely subsidizes defendants\u2019 apartments \u2026 and \u2018had a nearly 100 percent pass rate from HUD inspectors,\u2019\u201d according to one testimony.\nThe filing states that sanctions are necessary because of \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 disregard for the truth\u201d and \u201cpersistence with groundless litigation after warnings.\u201d\nIssuing the sanctions would \u201cprotect defendants from further harassment and the integrity of this court,\u201d the filing also states.\nAt one point, a judge in the tenant\u2019s class action lawsuit dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice but attorneys re-filed their claim shortly after.\nPangea\u2019s attorneys also argue that the sale of the portfolio for considerably more than it was bought for, was proof the company\u2019s properties were well taken care of.\nMartay began assembling the portfolio shortly after the great financial crisis, buying many properties for as little as $20,000 per unit. When he sold the properties in 2022, the price came out to about $75,000 per unit.\nA judge will consider the request for sanctions on December 15 and will hold a status call on December 23.\nPangea was also hit with a whistleblower lawsuit in 2018 over allegedly adding surcharges to units rented by HUD voucher holders. That case, however,\nwas dismissed in August.\nAny specific damages awarded to the federal government or the whistleblower were not outlined in the court filings.\nPreviously, Pangea denied committing fraud or systemic overcharging while admitting that there were some isolated cases of overcharging.\nAround the same time that the voucher dispute was dismissed, the portfolio\u2019s new owners, Emerald Empire, appeared to be running into trouble of their own.\nFannie Mae\nstruck a forbearance agreement\nin August with Moshe Wechsler\u2019s New York-based firm on at least $125 million worth of loans attached to Chicago apartment properties.\n\u201cThe loans in question are currently in forbearance and are performing in accordance with the agreement,\u201d a Fannie Mae spokesperson said at the time.\nAccording to public records, the properties in forbearance are encumbered by a tranche of debt within a bigger $430 million financing package.",

        "content": "Winnetka\u2019s ongoing fight over its fragile lakefront is back in federal court, with a group of homeowners alleging the village\u2019s 2024 bluff protection ordinance has already erased $16 million in property value across four high-end estates \u2014 and could ultimately cost hundreds of millions if applied across all 112 affected parcels.\nThe amended complaint, filed Monday in U.S. District Court, includes more than two dozen plaintiffs, among them investors Andrew Bluhm, Michael Hara and Terry McKay, plus former executives from Abbott, United Airlines and other Chicago-area firms, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The filing revives a suit\ndismissed in October\nfor lack of evidence of actual loss. This time, owners say they have the receipts: appraisals from Cohn Reznick showing steep value drops tied to the restrictions imposed by the ordinance.\nThe ordinance sharply limits how much blufftop land can be\ndeveloped\n, a response to years of public outcry over shoreline construction \u2014 a controversy amplified by billionaire\nJustin Ishbia\u2019s\n$77 million compound and its high-profile bluff reshaping. Homeowners insist the village has gone too far. Plaintiff organizer Bill Jackson, a retired Johnson Controls executive, told the outlet that the group doesn\u2019t want compensation, but rather to have the ordinance repealed.\nAmong the examples cited, Hara\u2019s Sheridan Road property allegedly lost nearly $4 million in value after roughly 10,000 square feet of buildable blufftop was eliminated, dropping the appraisal from $11.12 million to $7.31 million. The steepest hit \u2014 64 percent \u2014 was recorded at Barbara Irwin\u2019s estate on Taylorsport Lane, which fell from $7.54 million to $2.69 million after 17,700 square feet of land became off-limits.\nOwners argue the damage compounds over time: As Winnetka land prices rise, square footage removed from the buildable zone won\u2019t benefit from the\nappreciating market\n. They frame this as an unconstitutional taking under both the U.S. and Illinois constitutions, asserting the village has stripped land value without offering compensation.\nWinnetka\u2019s attorneys declined comment, citing the judge\u2019s order for plaintiffs to provide a black-lined comparison of the revised complaint. Village officials have defended the ordinance as necessary for safety and shoreline preservation, but plaintiffs say past permitting rules worked and that the new regime is driven by aesthetics, not geotechnical risk.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Bonham, a quiet Fannin County town better known for its frontier history than major development, is bracing for its biggest growth spurt yet.\nA 400-acre site near State Highways 121 and 56 is set to become Powder Creek Ranch, the town\u2019s first master-planned community and a 3,000-home bet on North Texas\u2019 continued sprawl, 70 miles away from downtown Dallas.\nDallas-based Sanchez &amp; Associates will complete the project in seven phases through 2035, according to a press release. The mix mirrors what\u2019s driving demand across the region: single-family homes, townhomes, build-to-rent units and multifamily units, backed by a commercial spine of retail, dining and office space, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. Parks, trails and open green networks aim to keep the development knitted to Bonham\u2019s small-town character.\nInfrastructure design is already underway for the 73-acre first phase, which will break ground in late 2026. That opening tranche will include 205 single-family homes and 350 BTR units, with rents between $1,200 and $2,200. Zillow puts Bonham\u2019s average home value at about $227,300, roughly $30,000 below that of Sherman and less than half of McKinney and Frisco.\nThat affordability, coupled with surging job hubs in\nSherman\nand northern\nCollin County\n, has accelerated Bonham\u2019s appeal to younger buyers and renters priced out of Dallas\u2019 inner ring. Commute times remain manageable, a quality of life advantage as traffic thickens along the region\u2019s major corridors.\n\u201cWith the tech boom happening in nearby\nGrayson County\nand continued growth into northern\nCollin County\n, Bonham continues to see increased attention from developers and employers,\u201d William Myers, the city\u2019s economic development director, told the Business Journal.\nThe Bonham City Council approved its first public improvement district last fall to help finance infrastructure for the decade-long buildout. Sanchez &amp; Associates CEO J. Martin Sanchez told the outlet that the project aims to honor the city\u2019s heritage while meeting the needs of \u201cfuture residents seeking attainable housing in the North Texas growth corridor.\u201d\nBonham, a town of roughly 10,500 residents, is one of Texas\u2019 oldest settlements. The town harkens back to an 1837 frontier blockhouse known as Fort Inglish. The Powder Creek Ranch site itself was part of a 1960s ranch owned by Joe Kirkpatrick, a World War II veteran and founder of Cisco Boots \u2014 history that Sanchez says will influence the community\u2019s design.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The development, known as Stocker Street Creative, would consist of five new buildings and a sixth small security office.\nBuilding A, slated to rise three stories at the corner of Santa Rosalia Boulevard and Stocker Street, would span 34,700 square feet and boast offices, a food court and retail space. Three to four fast-casual restaurants would take up 11,500 square feet on the ground floor, while commercial offices would comprise about 24,000 square feet on the second and third floors.\nLocated across a 31,000-square-foot landscaped central plaza would be Building B, a six-story, 133,200-square-foot structure with 44,400 square feet of studio production support, 88,800 square feet of leasable office space and a 9,000-square-foot rooftop restaurant and garden.\nBuilding D, situated across a service road, would rise 57 feet and have 30,000 square feet of sound stages. Building E similarly would be the same height and have 19,200 square feet of sound stages as well as 13,000 square feet across a mezzanine and underground mill shop space. Building F, attached to Building E, would be five stories tall with 370 vehicle parking spots, 50 bicycle parking stalls and a 3,000-square-foot community room on the ground floor.\nIf approved, construction on the Stocker Street Creative complex would take nearly three years, kicking off as early as July and wrapping up by May 2029.\nStocker Street Creative would join two other large commercial developments that are in the works nearby.\nHarridge Development Group is approved\nto add more than 900 homes, a hotel and other commercial space to the 42-acre Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza mall, and\nHudson Pacific Properties\nis poised to build about 300,000 square feet of offices across from the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza mall at the\nformer Marlton Square site\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "In a hush-hush deal, Austin philanthropist Ross Moody, scion of the influential Moody family, purchased a waterfront compound that includes a mid-century modern\nhome\nthat has never been sold before.\nThrough an LLC which he manages, and which has its address at another of his properties, Moody bought the neighboring houses at 3925 and 3919 Westlake Drive on\nLake Austin\nand a vacant lot across the street at 3809 Spirit Lake Cove, according to county records. Altogether, the property includes 550 feet of waterfront and 3 acres of land.\nAlthough each property has its own address and identification, all were owned by one seller, and the survey on the listing website for the home at 3925 Westlake yokes them under one border. Amy Deane with Moreland Properties had the listing. The listing and sales prices are unavailable.\nThe marquee home is at 3925 Westlake, which Deane likens to a \u201cyacht wrapped around the hills.\u201d Built in 1963 for the seller, physician Donald Counts, the three-bedroom, three-bathroom, 3,200-square-foot house blends into the wooded cliffside with stone, redwood and patinate copper as its primary materials. It shares a 2-acre lot with a boat house, a garden nursery and two other family dwellings, according to county information and the listing survey.\nThe property made headlines in January as Austin\u2019s most expensive active listing,\nasking $19.9 million, or about $988 per square foot over the 20,100 square feet of gross living space on the lot. The seller reduced the price to $17.5 million in September, according to Zillow.\nThe rest of the property is just as luxurious, though not quite as flashy.\nNeither Redfin, Zillow nor Realtor.com record any listing history for the home at 3919 Westlake. Deane created a listing website which invites visitors to inquire about pricing.\nThe 1-acre property includes a 6,000-square-foot house built in 1971 with three bedrooms and two bathrooms, overlooking the water from a cliff. Counts acquired it in 2006.\nInformation on the property at 3809 Spirit Lake Cove, the unimproved half-acre lot across the street, is similarly scant.\nAs a result, one can only estimate the total asking price of the 3-acre property, much less the final sale price. However, the $17.5 million asking price for the home at 3925 Westlake is more than double its net appraised value of $7.4 million, and the three parcels have a combined appraised value of $12.6 million, property records show.\nPrivate listings and sales are common in Austin\n, most practically as a way to evade higher property tax appraisals.\nMoody is a trustee of the Moody Foundation, the Galveston-based charitable organization founded in 1942 by financier William Lewis Moody. The Moodys endowed the Moody Gardens and the Moody College of Communication at the University of Texas, and they are the namesake of UT\u2019s Moody Center and SMU\u2019s Moody Coliseum.\n",

        "content": "Hobe Sound, just north of Palm Beach County\u2019s golf mecca Jupiter, has emerged as a hotspot for developers looking to build the next generation of exclusive\ngolf developments\n.\nThe golf community is hardly a new real estate phenomenon. Done well, they become prestigious luxury mini-markets.\nHeavy hitters like billionaire Related Ross chairman Steve Ross and Discovery Land Company\u2019s Mike Meldman, best known for building the Yellowstone Club in Montana, are among the developers with skin in the Hobe Sound game.\nMichael Jordan, famously a resident of\nJupiter\u2019s Bear\u2019s Club\n, turned to Hobe Sound for his own golf development.\nGrove XXIII\n, named for his number 23 jersey, doesn\u2019t have a residential component but has attracted a stacked roster of high-profile members. A leaked membership list obtained by Golf Digest in 2021 includes Mark Wahlberg, Bret Baier, Wayne Gretzky, and golfers Justin Thomas, Rickie Fowler and Rory McIlroy. From the real estate industry were Meldman and Frisbie Group\u2019s Cody Crowell.\nThe result is a pipeline of hundreds of luxury homes and thousands of acres soon to become immaculate greens.\nFlorida is a well-established golf destination. The National Golf Foundation counts more than 1,200 golf courses in Florida, more than any other state. The\npandemic\ninspired many Americans to take up golf and\npursue private club membership\n. It also triggered a wave of migration to South Florida, and developers responded in kind, planning thousands of luxury single-family homes and condos.\nThat includes luxury golf club communities like Centaur Holdings\u2019\nPanther National\nnear Palm Beach Gardens, a 218-home development with an 18-hole course designed by Jack Nicklaus and Justin Thomas. But much of the open land in Palm Beach County has already been cannibalized, and land prices have soared.\nSo developers went north. Here\u2019s a look at the planned golf developments in Hobe Sound.\nApogee |\n2103 Southwest Bridge Road |\nDevelopers: Related Ross, Michael Pascucci\nSteve Ross teamed up with Michael Pascucci, the chairman of investment firm Duck Pond Associates and owner of the Sebonack Golf Club in Southampton, to develop Apogee. The private club will have three 18-hole courses when it is completed. While there are no homes for sale, the club does have a residential component. Apogee will have 54 villas ranging between two- and four-bedrooms, for member use only.\nRoss announced this week that Apogee will be part of a South Florida\nair taxi network\n, as part of a partnership with Archer Aviation.\nAtlantic Fields | 2645 Southeast Bridge Road | Developers: Discovery Land Company, Becker Holding Corporation\nAtlantic Fields is Discovery\u2019s first project on Florida\u2019s east coast, developed in partnership with the Becker brothers\u2019 Becker Holding Corporation. The 1,500-acre project includes 317 single-family homes, an 18-hole golf course, equestrian facilities, a farm and other recreation and wellness amenities, according to the website.\nThe Ranch | 4505 Southwest Kanner Highway | Developer: Ken Bakst\nHistorically known as the Calusa Creek Ranch, this 3,900-acre development is slated for 175 single-family homes and two 18-hole courses, according to the project\u2019s website. The developer is Ken Bakst, who built the Friar\u2019s Club on Long Island.\n",

To land the three-year extension on the $151.5 million CMBS loan, Chetrit pumped in additional equity, which subordinates part of the debt.\nIron Hound Management\u2019s Kevin Thompson and Will Forbes negotiated the deal with special servicer CW Capital and a CMBS trust.\n\u201cWe believe in a positive future for this asset going forward,\u201d Michael Chetrit told the Observer.\nThe 65 Broadway debt landed in special servicing in February 2024 after tenants, including Great American Insurance and New York Cares, exited the property.\nThe loan was flagged in April 2024 for maturity default as cash flow failed to cover loan payments, according to Trepp. The former American Express Building was subsequently reappraised at $104 million, half of the value from five years prior and below the loan balance.\nBy last June, however, Chetrit and its co-sponsor were able to bring the payments current, according to Fitch commentary from July 2024. There were signs an extension was in the offing as Chetrit pursued a plan to offer additional equity, which is ultimately what went down.\nThe building is 110 years old and was last renovated in 2018, before the pandemic altered tenant expectations around amenities and customized space. The building was 35 percent vacant as of July 2024.\nThis is the second significant restructuring to cross the finish line for the Chetrit Organization in recent weeks.\nLast month, the firm modified the\n$714 million debt\nbacking the Yorkshire Towers at 305 East 86th Street and Lexington Towers at 160 East 88th Street on the Upper East Side. The\nmodification\nbrought the CMBS loan current, waived guarantees in the original deal and pushed back the loan\u2019s maturity date.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Horton slated the project for a 7.2-acre site at 530 Southwest Third Avenue, 354 Southwest Seventh Street and two adjacent lots, according to the developer\u2019s application filed to Miami-Dade County late last month.\nThe homebuilder is under contract to purchase the four-lot property at an undisclosed price, the application says.\nThe Torcise family, longtime farmers in the Florida City area, own the site, according to records.\nThe project would consist of two-story buildings with five- to 12 townhomes, the site plan shows.\nLed by CEO Paul J. Romanowski, D.R. Horton is the largest homebuilder nationwide.\nThe firm has been a home developer for years in south Miami-Dade, an area with an ample supply of cheaper buildable land.\nOver the past five years, D.R. Horton completed 16 percent of all single-family homes and townhomes built in south Miami-Dade, according to Colliers Research. D.R. Horton also is responsible for\n23 percent\nof the under-construction and proposed pipeline in the area.\nElsewhere in south Miami-Dade, the firm plans a complex with\n190 townhomes and 57 single-family homes\non the southwest corner of Southwest 344th Street and 193rd Avenue. The site is in an unincorporated area of the county.\nDevelopers have rushed to south Miami-Dade over the past half-decade in a bid to scoop up and build on one of the area\u2019s many vacant lots. The flurry of project proposals is partly rooted in the influx of out-of-staters to South Florida, which supercharged the tri-county region\u2019s housing market and created high demand for homes.\nAlso in Florida City, Lennar plans a\n521-unit townhome\ncomplex on the southwest corner of Southwest 167th Avenue and Southwest 344th Street. Garrett Development, a land bank for Lennar, paid $20.4 million for the 37.8-acre development site last year.\nIn April, Boston-based Freehold Capital Management bought the 50-acre land assemblage on the southeast corner of Southwest 344th Street and Southwest 199th Avenue near Florida City for\n$31.6 million\n. The site was previously planned for a 309-unit rental townhome project.\n",

        "content": "When the\nAstor Place Starbucks closed\nin 2024 after nearly 30 years, it left a hole in a busy East Village commercial strip \u2014 and in the pocket of the Gindi family.\nThe value of the commercial condo at 21 Astor Place has dropped 72 percent in a decade, from $42 million to $11.7 million, according to Morningstar Credit. The owner, an entity connected to Isaac and Edward Gindi, is currently\nbattling foreclosure\n.\nA company now associated with the Gindis bought the commercial condo for $13 million in 2004, according to city records. Ownership interests appear to have transferred several times, but in 2015, Isaac and Edward sponsored a $26.65 million refinancing loan for the location.\nTrouble began a few years later in 2021, when FedEx vacated more than 60 percent of its space in the commercial condo, which extends around the south side of the building on Astor Place. Revenue fell by about 40 percent from 2020 to 2021, according to information from Morningstar.\nDoorDash moved in swiftly to occupy the 6,000-square-foot space, lured by 90 days of free rent. That kept the property full, but rents were still lower than their peak, according to the loan servicer.\nStarbucks had signed a 20-year lease for just over 4,000 square feet at the condo, across the street from the \u201cCube\u201d sculpture, in 2004. The site quickly became a case study for the area\u2019s changing demographics.\n\u201cEast Village grit is giving way to Midtown-style blandness,\u201d\nThe Real Deal\nwrote in 2007\n, when Starbucks renewed another lease down the street.\nBut the coffee chain closed the Astor Place location last year.\n\u201cIt was a gentrifier that the neighborhood grew to accept pretty quickly,\u201d Curbed\neulogized\nafter the announcement. \u201cIt found its audience in a million NYU-freshman-year study dates.\u201d\nThe withdrawal of Starbucks triggered a requirement for the borrower to deposit $1.5 million in the lender\u2019s account, something it failed to do, the lender alleges in a July foreclosure suit. The Gindis, who served as limited guarantors on the loan, allegedly failed to submit documentation about their net worth and liquidity.\n\u201cThe vacancy at 21 Astor stems from high taxes, complex landmark regulations and lengthy municipal approvals,\u201d Terrance and Darren Oved, the Gindis\u2019 counsel of Oved &amp; Oved LLP, said in a statement. \u201cOur client is actively addressing these challenges and remains confident in securing a suitable tenant for the space and the community.\u201d\nThe court appointed a temporary receiver to the property on Friday.\n",

        "content": "Would you pay $773,000 for an apartment in Syracuse, where the median home costs one-fourth as much?\nNew York state is doing just that.\nThe state just broke ground on\nEast Adams Phase I\n, a $102 million, 132-unit affordable housing development on public land in Syracuse. That\u2019s $773,000 per unit \u2014\nabout as much\nas it would have cost in New York City.\nHowever, that per-unit cost would be much easier to justify in New York City, where half of all homes sell for\nmore than $845,000\n. In Syracuse,\nnot a single house\nis selling for that much.\nThe median asking price for the 783 Syracuse homes listed at\nRealtor.com\nis $195,000. At that price, the $102 million being spent to build Phase I\u2019s 117 apartments and four townhomes could have purchased 523 homes.\nI realize that the $102 million could not legally have been spent that way, because the development\u2019s funding streams cannot be used to buy free-market homes. Also, it\u2019s an inexact comparison because many of the existing houses need some work and operating costs for the new, all-electric rentals and townhouses will be lower.\nBut you have to admit, the 4x cost differential is huge. From a capacity perspective, 523 homes would house about 1,500 more people than the 132 will.\nIt\u2019s just hard to wrap your brain around the project\u2019s $773,000 per-unit cost when this gorgeous five-bedroom, 3.5-bathroom, 3,700-square-foot house, also in Syracuse, is listed for only $439,900:\nDid I mention that the house includes a two-car garage?\nThe new development, East Adams Phase I, is replacing McKinney Manor, a to-be-demolished public housing complex with $17 million in deferred maintenance. East Adams will house tenants earning 60 percent of the area median income. Project-based Section 8 vouchers administered by the Syracuse Housing Authority will support 63 of the units.\nThe rest of the funding is coming from state and federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits ($42 million in equity and $45 million in subsidy from HCR) and Empire State Development (an $8 million subsidy loan). There\u2019s also $2.1 million from HUD, $500,000 from city bonds and $400,000 from Onondaga County.\nOnly in fantasy land could these funds be used to buy and convert private homes to public housing. That said, if it makes sense for the government to spend $773,000 per unit on East Adams Phase I, it surely makes sense for it to pay $6,000 for this attractive, four-bedroom\nfixer-upper\nwith original detail and rehabilitate it.\nGovernment housing wonks might call this analysis nonsense. I acknowledge that there is not a binary choice between building the East Adams project and buying existing homes.\nIndividuals, house-flippers and investors will eventually purchase the listed homes and fix those that need fixing, so the government need not do that. Meanwhile, if the government doesn\u2019t build East Adams, no one will. The purpose of government is to do things that are needed but don\u2019t happen on their own. I get all that.\nStill, it\u2019s hard to make sense of paying New York City prices to build affordable housing upstate, where homes are dirt cheap.\n",

        "content": "The Los Angeles City Council is moving toward complying with California\u2019s new\nstate-mandated transit-oriented development\nlaw.\nThe City Council earlier this week voted unanimously to approve a set of recommendations that kicks off the city\u2019s work to comply with SB 79, the Los Angeles Daily News\nreported\n. The\ntransit-area housing law\nis slated to take effect next July.\nCity staff are now authorized to begin detailed mapping and modeling of where SB 79\u2019s new density and height standards would be permitted. The Department of City Planning will do so by getting software and technical support for the effort, while the City Administrative Officer has been directed to find up to $375,000 in General Fund money for the citywide analysis. The visualization effort is being billed as a way to help officials determine which parts of town could qualify for delayed implementation of the law, as well as where a locally tailored alternative plan could increase density in certain areas rather than others.\nUnder SB 79,\nsigned into law\nby Gov. Gavin Newsom in October, California cities must allow mid- to high-density housing within a half-mile of certain rail stations and major bus routes. In Los Angeles, about 150 locations could be eligible under the law.\nSB 79 comes with two methods of determining how the law can be implemented.\n\u201cDelay in effectuation\u201d allows for a temporary pause that the city can use in certain areas deemed eligible. The \u201c\ntransit-oriented development\n(TOD) alternative plan,\u201d or \u201cAlt Plan,\u201d permits the city to move where dense projects can be built as long as housing capacity isn\u2019t decreased. The city is tasked with extensive modeling and securing state approval under both methods.\nBoth options have their own limits, some planning officials have warned. Many low-density neighborhoods with increased access to jobs and schools will likely not qualify for the delay. Alt Plans, meanwhile, present the issue of identifying another place to build if developers opt to reduce capacity on certain parcels.\nCity officials plan to present initial findings for the effort early next year. Any delay ordinance or Alt Plans must be submitted to the state housing department in the first quarter in order for them to take effect before SB 79 kicks in on July 1.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Crescent Heights\nis moving closer toward making its planned 67-story residential tower in downtown San Francisco.\nThe Miami-based developer is in motion on its planned $1 billion project at 10 South Van Ness Avenue as it consults with construction, design and engineering teams on a path forward, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The 1,000-unit tower could begin construction by early 2027, opening for occupancy amid what\u2019s expected to be a hot market for\nresidences as the number of artificial intelligence jobs\ncontinues to grow in the city.\nThe progress on the project marks a thawing in the high-rise construction pipeline that has largely been frozen due to pricey construction and costly debt. If Crescent Heights makes it happen, it could be the first major developer to build a high-rise residential tower in San Francisco\u2019s recent supply-restricted market.\nRising rents in San Francisco could explain why the project is inching closer to actually being built. Rents in the city increased 4.6 percent year-over-over, representing the third-fastest jump in the country, per Apartment List data cited by the Business Times. As a result, financial models have also improved, thanks in part to increased investor confidence, construction costs decreasing between 5 and 10 percent from their peak, and an easing on borrowing costs. Case in point:\nEquity Residential\nrecently told its investors that the recovery of downtown San Francisco is picking up steam as workers return, occupancies increase and rents approach pre-pandemic levels.\nAs it stands, investor-driven lenders make up 30 percent of construction loans, while regional banks have fallen to 25 percent. Office and apartment starts are still notably down from a year ago, signaling that capital isn\u2019t quite ready to dive head-first back into the market.\nStill, other developers are also charging ahead with their plans for downtown San Francisco. Lincoln Property Company, for example, is moving forward with its proposal for about 370 residential units as part of a mixed-use redevelopment located\non the campus of Golden Gate University\n.\nLocal officials are hoping to help speed up the process. On Tuesday, city supervisors approved a rezoning plan that increases housing capacity by 36,200 units. Officials also recently waived impact fees in the city\u2019s Hub and Market-Octavia districts, which is where Crescent Heights\u2019 tower would be built. Moves like these should, in theory, lower upfront costs so approved projects can actually get started.\n\u201cWe are doing all of this work to be better able to deliver what our public needs,\u201d Leigh Lutenski, the director of development for the city\u2019s Office of Economic and Workforce Development, said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The Hilton Anatole, one of Dallas\u2019 most recognizable hotels, is set for roughly $100 million in renovations after Crow Holdings and Hilton inked a renewed long-term management agreement, the companies announced Dec. 3.\nThe investment marks the latest chapter in a decades-long partnership between Crow and Hilton, according to the announcement, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. Crow developed the 1,610-room landmark at 2201 North Stemmons Freeway that anchors the Design District skyline with its pyramid-topped tower in the late 1970s as part of the Dallas Market Center complex, opening the 52-acre property in 1979 as the Loews Hotel.\nToday, the Anatole is a sprawling convention host establishment with two atriums, an\nAsian art collection\ntopping 1,000 works\u2013amenities that helped cement its place as one of the city\u2019s most important meeting hubs.\nThe renovation plan is ambitious. Between now and 2028,\nCrow\nand\nHilton\naim to refresh 899 atrium rooms, overhaul the 600,000-square-foot event and convention complex and upgrade food-and-beverage offerings across the property. The work also covers a slate of additional capital projects, though details weren\u2019t disclosed.\nIt follows a $30 million update launched in mid-2023 that reimagined about 700 rooms and nudged the hotel\u2019s key count slightly higher. Before that, a $125 million renovation in 2010 helped the Anatole keep pace with Dallas\u2019 growing profile as a corporate and\nconvention\ndestination.\nThe Anatole\u2019s long history as a civic gathering point adds weight to the latest reboot. It has played a key role accommodating everything from national political events \u2014 including the 1984 Republican National Convention and CPAC in 2021 \u2014 to The Real Estate Council\u2019s annual Fight Night. Its top-floor restaurant, S\u0112R Steak + Spirits, and its museum-like public spaces have also helped the property maintain relevance as newer hospitality concepts crowd the market.\nCrow Holdings CFO Ian Dilley said in a news release that the improvements will ensure the Anatole \u201cremains a defining destination for Dallas for generations to come,\u201d noting its role as a backdrop for corporate groups, tourists and community events.\nThe two companies framed the renewed agreement as a continuation of their goal to keep the Anatole positioned as a world-class destination. Rooms currently start around $269 a night.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The saga of the former Z NYC Hotel in Long Island City took another turn last month when a former creditor on the property sold it for a sinking sum.\nPalette Hotels acquired 11-01 43rd Avenue from Taconic Capital for $25.5 million, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Taconic acquired the former 100-key hotel from Merchants Capital in May 2021 for approximately\n$38.4 million\n, three years after Merchants acquired it for $32.3 million.\nTaconic lent Merchants $38 million at the property in 2019, allowing it to swoop in for its acquisition two years later.\nIt\u2019s unclear what Palette has planned for the site; the company and Taconic both failed to respond to requests for comment from the publication.\nThe site was once the home of Z NYC, a trendy spot in the Queens neighborhood. But like so many of its hospitality counterparts in New York, it couldn\u2019t outrun the effects of the pandemic and closed in 2020.\nHospitality startup Sonder stepped into the void, agreeing to lease the entire property. It ultimately backed out of the deal, however, leading Merchants to sue the company for $2.5 million for allegedly breaching the contract. Sonder went bankrupt last month.\nRichard Lou formerly ran a chain of restaurants before diving into the hotel market two decades ago. The Lou family acknowledged its changing business model in 2023 when it christened its business as Palette Hotels. The company\u2019s portfolio is more than 20 properties deep, including the AC Downtown on Maiden Lane in Lower Manhattan.\nTaconic Capital \u2014 no relation to Taconic Partners \u2014 made waves towards the end of last year when it was reported that the hedge fund was\nwinding down\nits commercial real estate operation and talking to Axonic Capital about acquiring one of Taconic\u2019s funds. A deal was ultimately announced before the calendar flipped.\nElsewhere in Long Island City hospitality, the McSam Hotel Group sold a 142-key property at 38-04 11th Street last year\nfor $40 million\n. A limited liability company connected to Letap Group principal Jasmin Patel purchased the newly built hotel.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A combined $755 million in Chicago office transactions closed Tuesday shows trophy assets still commanding big-league valuations while older towers push deeper into distressed territory.\nOwners of the Bank of America Tower locked in the headline move, completing a $700 million refinancing on the 55-story riverfront skyscraper at 110 North Wacker Drive. Built in 2020, the roughly 1.5 million-square-foot property was recently appraised at just over $1 billion, CoStar\nreported\n.\nThe contrast came a few blocks south, where Namdar Realty Group and Mason Asset Management closed on 190 South LaSalle Street, a 40-story postmodern tower designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee and built in 1987. The Great Neck, New York-based firms, known for scooping up distressed assets nationwide, paid about $55 million \u2014 that\u2019s about $69 per square foot, people familiar with the deal told the outlet \u2014 a fraction of the $230 million Beacon Capital Partners spent on the 798,000-square-foot building in 2019.\nBeacon\u2019s exit from\n190 South LaSalle\nmarks a steep plunge from the tower\u2019s pre-pandemic financing. The sale price sits far below the $167.5 million loan Beacon took out in February 2020. U.S. Bank, the lender and a tenant in the high-vacancy building, declined to comment, as did the buyers and Beacon. The sale was brokered by Cushman and Wakefield\u2019s Cody Hundermark and Tom Sitz.\nMeanwhile, Callahan Capital Partners and Oak Hill Advisors touted the refinancing of\nBank of America Tower\nas evidence that capital markets still reward best-in-class assets. Since buying the controlling interest in 2022, the owners have pushed occupancy from 78 percent to 98 percent, helping secure one of Chicago\u2019s largest post-pandemic office financings. Only the Old Post Office and Salesforce Tower have landed bigger CMBS deals in recent years.\nRiverfront skyscrapers and newer top-tier offices have kept reeling in the city\u2019s highest rents and biggest loans, while aging towers struggle with vacancies, debt loads and changing tenant preferences. It\u2019s a pattern playing out in other major U.S. markets too, where trophy buildings continue to attract capital even as older stock trades at liquidation prices.\nSome Chicago real estate pros see opportunity in the discount era. More trades at reset values, they argue, could draw in buyers with lower cost bases capable of competing for leases, ultimately adding liquidity to the market in 2026 and beyond. Namdar and Mason fit that profile: the pair have already snapped up\n70 West Madison\nand\nOne North LaSalle\nthrough similar distressed asset moves.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The buyer\u2019s identity has not been disclosed.\n\u201cReally, it\u2019s land value,\u201d said Gina Haggerty, the Compass listing agent who also represented the buyers. \u201cThe home had no significant value to it.\u201d\nThe nearly 1.2-acre lot attracted 14 offers and interest from developers and buyers looking to build their dream home.\nIt hit the market Oct. 1, asking under $8 million, and was in contract two weeks later. The property was in distress, as the previous owner owed nearly $5 million on a 2017 loan on the property. A notice of a trustee sale had been published, and the fast turnover and relatively low sale price was likely due to sellers wanting to avoid a\nforeclosure sale\n, said Ken DeLeon, founder of Palo Alto-based DeLeon Realty.\nA home at 57 Fairview Avenue also recently sold for its land value.\nThe 1-acre property was listed for $7.8 million and sold last month for $10.7 million, almost a third more than the price of a comparable lot last year.\n\u201cEven I was surprised that it jumped so much higher than just last year,\u201d DeLeon said.\nDeLeon\u2019s clients have been spending between $2,200 and $2,600 per square foot on construction costs for new builds on\nteardown\nlots. A typical 20,000-square-foot estate will run the teardown buyers almost $50 million in addition to the $10 million lot.\n\u201cThe lack of supply of good Atherton lots, coupled with increased demand due to [artificial intelligence] liquidity, will drive the luxury market to new heights next year,\u201d DeLeon said.\nThat prediction is held among many observers who\u2019ve noted the uptick in luxury home sales over the past year, including Haggerty. \u201cPeople are feeling more confident in buying a big property,\u201d she said.\nAs more\nAI companies\nand wealthy people move into the region, competition for such properties has increased \u2014 so much so that San Francisco is experiencing an\nAI-related mansion shortage\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The purchase price was $23.98 million.\nAs part of the deal, Lennar terminated its purchase option for the homesites with JEN and signed a purchase option agreement with DW Partners that\u2019s valid until 2031, records show.\nThe lots are roughly south of Southwest 344th Street and east of Southwest 162nd Avenue.\nDW Partners\n, led by David Warren and Robert Clark, is an alternative asset manager founded in 2009, according to its website.\nMiami-based Lennar, the second largest homebuilder nationwide and the\nbiggest in south Miami-Dade County\n, heavily relies on land banks to secure development sites years before it\u2019s ready to start building homes on them. The strategy allows the publicly traded Lennar to carry the cost of the land ownership off its balance sheet, freeing up its cash flow for developing homes, experts have said.\nAside from JEN, Lennar\u2019s other land bank partners include Scottsdale, Arizona-based Garrett Development and New York-based TPG Angelo Gordon. This year, the homebuilder also spun off\nMillrose Properties\n, its own publicly traded land bank.\nLennar is led by Stuart Miller and Jon Jaffe.\nJaffe will retire\nfrom the firm this year.\nLocking in development sites in advance is also advantageous for Lennar in Miami-Dade due to the county\u2019s low supply of buildable sites. The south county area is the only remaining part of Miami-Dade with enough land for single-family and townhome communities.\nOver the past five years, developers have rushed to south Miami-Dade, scooping up sites and filing new project applications. Lennar has outpaced them all, completing nearly 70 percent of the homes finished in the area since 2020, according to Colliers Research. It also is developing 60 percent of the pipeline.\nAlso within the massive Keys Gate subdivision, Lennar filed a proposal in 2022 for\n1,335 homes\nand a golf course on 350 acres.\nOthers with stakes in Keys Gate include Miami-based Mast Capital, which paid\n$50.8 million\nfor a 292-townhome complex in 2021. The property is at 1140 Southeast 24th Road.\nOthers developing in south Miami-Dade include Arlington, Texas-based D.R. Horton, the nation\u2019s biggest homebuilder. In Florida City, it proposed a\n108-townhome complex\nat 530 Southwest Third Avenue, 354 Southwest Seventh Street and two adjacent lots.\nDavid Martin\u2019s Coconut Grove-based Terra wants to redevelop a portion of the South Dade Government Center at 10710, 10750 and 10800 Southwest 211th Street in Cutler Bay with a\n724-unit Live Local Act project\n. The first phase would consist of a pair of eight-story buildings with about 362 units and 458 parking spaces.\n",

        "content": "President Donald Trump wiped away the federal case against Tim Leiweke, the powerhouse executive who helped build Oak View Group into a worldwide sports and entertainment venue developer.\nLeiweke\n, who stepped down as Oak View Group\u2019s CEO after his July indictment, was pardoned Dec. 2, according to a notice posted to the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s website the following evening, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n. Leiweke had faced a single felony count of restraining trade tied to OVG\u2019s ultimately successful pursuit of a deal to develop the Moody Center arena at the University of Texas main campus in Austin.\nLeiweke is well known nationally for his years spent working for billionaire Philip Anschutz and Los Angeles-based AEG Worldwide, which owns the\nCrypto.com\narena and the Los Angeles Kings hockey club along with other venues around the U.S. and world. Leiweke later played a similar role with the Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment in Toronto before joining with music industry veteran Irv Azoff to form Oak View Group, which operates a roster of facilities ranging from the UBS Arena in New York to the Arie Crown Theater in Chicago and several Texas properties also in the mix.\nProsecutors alleged he conspired with Legends Hospitality in 2018 to rig the bidding, convincing a rival firm to back off in exchange for future contracts once the Austin venue opened. If convicted, he faced up to 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine.\nThe pardon arrives five months after the indictment forced Leiweke \u2014 one of the most recognizable operators in sports and entertainment real estate \u2014 to relinquish the CEO role at the Denver-based firm he co-founded.\nOak View Group\nsecured non-prosecution agreements in the case, paying a $15 million fine, while Legends paid $1.5 million. Leiweke consistently maintained his innocence, arguing that collaborating on the bid was a standard strategy for a young company competing for marquee projects.\nLeiweke\nexpressed deep gratitude to\nTrump\nin a statement to Sports Business Journal, calling the case a \u201clong and difficult journey\u201d for his family. A jury trial had been scheduled for May 4 after being pushed from an initial December date.\nThe timing wasn\u2019t subtle. Hours before the pardon became public, Oak View Group formally named veteran sports executive Chris Granger its permanent CEO. Granger had been serving in an interim capacity since Leiweke\u2019s departure and is now tasked with steadying a company that has ballooned into a global powerhouse, managing and developing arenas, stadiums and live-entertainment districts across North America and abroad.\nOak View Group struck a supportive note in a statement to SBJ, saying it was \u201chappy for Tim that he can now put this matter behind him\u201d while emphasizing its focus on clients under Granger\u2019s leadership. The company opened and operates the Moody Center, which has become a major anchor for Austin\u2019s live-events economy since debuting in 2022.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The Jogani brothers are back at it.\nTwo of the brothers are suing a niece and nephew, among other parties, for $775 million. The two allege their niece and nephew were paid hundreds of millions in fraudulent fees, salaries and bonuses by their father, another Jogani brother.\nThe brother named as a culprit in the suit is Haresh Jogani, who was\nordered\nin 2024 to pay plaintiffs Rajesh and Chetan Jogani, and their other brothers, to settle a two-decade dispute over the family\u2019s portfolio of 17,000 or so apartment units in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles; the payout verdict was valued at about $10 billion.\nNow Rajesh and Chetan Jogani claim their brother made payments to his children \u2014 the niece and nephew of the plaintiffs \u2014 in order to siphon off and hide assets from real estate management and diamond businesses, according to a complaint dated late-November, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court.\nThe current accusations are flying as the prior case is in the courts on appeal.\nThe first\nlegal brawl\nended with Haresh being ordered to pay Rajesh and Chetan a combined $1.5 billion in punitive damages. Rajesh and Chetan also were awarded punitive damages and a 10 percent and six and a half percent stake, respectively, in the\nmultifamily real estate portfolio\nthat was at the center of the case.\nA total of five Jogani brothers came to Los Angeles from India, and eventually amassed a fortune in real estate and diamonds.\nThe latest complaint claims Jeet Jogani and Dhwani Jogani \u2014 Haresh\u2019s children and the nephew and niece of Rajesh and Chetan \u2014 together received $225 million \u201clooted\u201d from three real estate entities. The case contends that all brothers own the businesses.\nThe two plaintiffs contend that a court-appointed receiver gave Haresh \u201cunfettered control\u201d over the businesses for a period of time, leading to illegitimate payments to his children.\n\u201cHaresh treated the partnership companies as his personal piggy bank,\u201d the complaint alleges, and \u201ctook advantage of his position, to loot billions of dollars, without making proportionate distributions to his brothers.\u201d\nRajesh and Chetan claim their niece and nephew held roles at the three real estate entities before a receiver terminated them. The two brothers argue that neither performed substantial work or contributed to profitability, that they received $25 million bonuses in the middle of the prior trial. The two brothers claim the monetary transfers exceed reasonable compensation, and that Haresh allowed them to \u201chinder and delay plaintiffs\u2019 ability to collect the amounts that Haresh owes to them.\u201d\nRajesh and Chetan allege the \u201cdefendants\u2019 conduct was malicious, oppressive, and done with the intent to defraud.\u201d\nThe two are suing for treble damages, a legal remedy where the court is required to award the plaintiff three times the amount of actual damages determined by the jury as punitive measure. In this case, the actual damages are $225 million, per the suit, therefore treble damages amount to $775 million.\nJeet Jogani and Dhwani Jogani could not be immediately reached for comment. The two do not appear to have retained attorneys based on available information.\nTheir father Haresh\u2019s prior attorney, Rick Richmond, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Peter Ross, an attorney who represented Rajesh and Chetan in the prior case, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "A long-stalled Arlington Heights apartment development just bought itself another year.\nVillage trustees approved a 12-month extension this week for zoning approvals tied to Mylo Arlington Heights, a six-story, 135-unit project that has been unable to break ground since securing entitlements in 2022. The Daily Herald\nreported\nthat the reprieve keeps the plan alive at\n116-120 West Eastman Street\n, where two obsolete office buildings \u2014 including one with a basement that once housed the 1960s teen club called The Cellar \u2014 have sat vacant on the edge of the village\u2019s downtown.\nDeveloper\nJoe Taylor\nIII of Compasspoint Development said the hurdles holding up the $66 million transit-oriented project are the same ones dogging multifamily proposals across the Chicago suburbs. Interest rates have pushed banks and debt funds to retreat from construction lending. Equity investors are hesitant too, Taylor said, because they can pick up existing northwest suburban apartment buildings at or below replacement cost. And construction pricing continues to rise, strained by higher materials costs, a tight labor pool and uncertainty around tariffs and inflation.\nEven so, Taylor told trustees he expects 2026 to be the year that it finally becomes realistic to see shovels dig in the dirt on West Eastman. The new zoning deadline requires Compasspoint to secure permits and begin construction by December 18, 2026.\nThe plan calls for a midrise building with a ground-floor restaurant and a renter base ranging from young professionals to local downsizers \u2014 a demographic mix\nArlington Heights\nhas been courting as redevelopment clusters near its Metra train station.\nTaylor said the extension provides enough runway to finalize design, engineering and construction pricing by the second quarter of 2026, with delivery and lease-up targeted for 2028.\nTrustee Tom Schwingbeck pressed him on whether that\u2019s achievable. Taylor insisted it is.\n\u201cI don\u2019t envision us coming back for a second time for a second extension,\u201d Taylor said at the meeting. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to get everything done.\u201d\nMuch of his confidence stems from new capital partners. Taylor said he has teamed up with Richard Wolper, founder of Utah-based luxury homebuilder Mark 25 Homes, who in turn has long-standing financing relationships with\nD.A. Davidson\nand SDP Real Estate Investment Trust.\nThose alliances, Taylor said, open doors to construction and long-term debt that smaller suburban developers often struggle to access, saying his new partners are well-capitalized and committed to financing the project.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Amenities include a podium-top courtyard and a rooftop deck spanning about 9,800 square feet.\nA previous version called for building 20 stories with 258 residential units.\nIn 2017,\nTrammell Crow Company\nreceived an entitlement for an eight-story apartment complex and sold the project to Leap Development the following year.\nLeap began construction in 2019 but suspended work the following year, allowing the site to collect water before a 2024 public nuisance lawsuit from City Attorney\nDavid Chiu accused\nLeap of abandoning the partially excavated development site.

        "content": "A Miami homeowner is accusing the city of attempting to take private property via an allegedly abusive permitting process, a scheme that may affect more than 1,000 homes in Miami, a lawsuit claims.\nCharles \u201cChad\u201d Trausch filed an amended complaint against the city on Wednesday. He first sued the city eight months ago over the city\u2019s demands that he transfer a portion of his front yard to the city for the public right-of-way. He filed the lawsuit \u200b\u200bpro se, which means he was representing himself, in April.\nTrausch and his wife Stephanie paid $710,000 for their house in the\nBuena Vista neighborhood\n, just north of the Design District, in 2021.\nWhen his wife was expecting their baby, they sought a permit for an addition so they could accommodate more family. Trausch submitted an application to the city\u2019s zoning department for the two-bedroom, two-bathroom addition to his Miami home last year, but the city notified him that it would not issue a permit for the project until Trausch conveyed a permanent deed for a portion of his front yard, according to the complaint.\n\u201cFor twenty months, the city withheld [Trausch\u2019s] permit because he refused to give up half his front yard,\u201d the lawsuit states. Once Trausch hired attorneys, \u201cthe city suddenly decided to \u2018approve\u2019 [Trausch\u2019s] waiver request\u201d without explanation.\nSince Trausch submitted his permit application in the spring of 2024, \u201cthe cost of construction materials and labor exploded,\u201d and his lawyers estimate it will\ncost\nhim more than $200,000 to complete the addition.\nTrausch\u2019s attorneys, who include Ari Bargil and Suranjan Sen of the\nInstitute for Justice\n, wrote in the amended complaint that the city of Miami has been taking property by \u201csystematically extorting hundreds of Miami residents.\u201d The Institute for Justice said it has identified 66 streets with more than 1,000 homes \u201cat threat to this scheme.\u201d\nA city spokesperson said they would respond to\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nrequest for comment but has not yet provided a comment.\nTrausch\u2019s attorneys argued that the city can\u2019t expand any right-of-way without paying the property owner for the land. Miami\u2019s procedures \u201csubject people to a shakedown,\u201d the complaint alleges. The lawsuit accuses the city of violating the\nFifth\nand Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution regarding the uncompensated taking of private property and due process.\nWhen a homeowner seeks a land-use permit, for example to build an addition, the city demands an expanded right-of-way to match the parcel\u2019s base building line. Base building lines are setbacks where owners can\u2019t build, but where they still own the land. But the city has been seeking the land via deeds instead, Trausch and his attorneys allege.\nThe Institute for Justice said that Miami has been getting homeowners to deed land over for right-of-ways for years, citing a city employee\u2019s testimony in a federal case with Trausch\u2019s neighbor that there have been \u201chundreds\u201d of these demands. The city is landbanking so that it can eventually widen roads on the affected streets.\n",

        "content": "Florida Republicans moved forward four proposals to reduce\nproperty taxes\nin the state, in spite of growing fears of funding impacts to local and emergency services.\nThe House State Affairs Committee approved four proposed constitutional amendments this week,\nCBS News\nreported. Among them is HJR 201, which would eliminate non-school homestead property taxes and could cut local government revenue by $14.1 billion in the first year it is implemented, and up to $18 billion in later years, according to the\nTallahassee Democrat\n.\nIn addition to HJR 201, Republicans voted on party lines to pass HJR 205, which would do away with non-school property taxes for homestead properties whose owners are 65 and older; HJR 209, which would eliminate non-school property taxes for homestead properties with\ninsurance coverage\n; and HJR 211, which would remove the $500,000 limit on transferring the property tax benefit to a new homestead.\nAll four amendments require approval by 60 percent of voters to become law, although it\u2019s unclear if and which of the bills will appear on ballots next November.\nRepublican lawmakers started work on these proposals after Gov. Ron DeSantis started calling to completely abolish property taxes, skewering them as \u201crent to the government.\u201d\nAn analysis\nby listings site Realtor.com\u2019s senior economist Joel Berner shows an outright elimination of property taxes would immediately increase property values between 7 and 9 percent. The aggregate value of Florida\u2019s owner-occupied housing stock would spike from $200 billion to $250 billion, the report showed. But the benefits would be uneven, Berner said.\n\u201cIt would be a boon to existing property owners,\u201d he told Realtor.com. \u201cBut this measure would disproportionately benefit wealthy Floridians at the expense of those who don\u2019t own homes, and would make it even harder to break into homeownership because of the increased prices.\u201d\nOpponents of the cuts also say it could induce a fiscal crisis for local governments, and leave crucial services like EMS, fire departments and road maintenance underfunded. Local leaders, including the Florida Association of Counties, Florida League of Cities, and Florida Fire Chiefs Association, have all raised fears about the consequences of billions lost in funding.\n\u201cThis is the biggest, \u2018bro, just trust me,\u2019 that I have ever seen in my life,\u201d State Rep. Ashley Gantt, a Miami Democrat, told the State Affairs Committee, according to published reports. \u201cHow many firefighters are dispensable? That\u2019s the question.\u201d\u2013\u2013\nKate Hinsche\n",

        "content": "One Houston developer sees opportunity in the void Macy\u2019s left when its Alameda Mall location shuttered earlier this year.\nRead King, which bought the former 23-acre Macy\u2019s property at the southeast Houston mall in fall 2024, is moving ahead with plans to convert the two-story, 290,000-square-foot department store into an indoor marketplace dubbed The Market at Almeda.\nThe mall, which is situated at the nexus of Interstate 45, Almeda Genoa Road, Kleckly Drive and Kingspoint Road,\nThe Houston Business Journal\nreported\nthat the shift comes months after\nMacy\u2019s\nshuttered the location as part of a 66-store national pullback. Read King leased the location back to Macy\u2019s after its purchase until March of this year, leaving the 57-year-old mall without a major draw.\nRead King\nsenior associate Travis Read told the outlet that the firm is negotiating with a grocer, a fitness center and a beauty school for the reimagined space. The grocer would anchor the project with about 65,000 square feet on the first floor, while the rest of the ground level would be carved into restaurant and retail bays along the building\u2019s east and west faces. Roughly 44,000 square feet upstairs would be leased to smaller tenants, with remaining space used for utilities.\nInstead of the full teardown the developer initially contemplated, Read King opted to adapt the hulking structure, citing its fortress-like construction, high visibility from Interstate 45 and the steep cost of ground-up replacement. Plans to reclad the exterior and install new glass storefronts will bring what Read called a \u201cretro vibe\u201d that nods to the mall\u2019s history. Bellaire-based Boucher Design Group is leading the architectural work.\nAcross Kleckley Drive, the firm plans to add a detention pond and two pad sites for sale or ground lease \u2014 likely to restaurant or retail users. Permitting is underway, with a groundbreaking expected in early 2025, though Read declined to disclose development costs.\nAlmeda Mall\nitself has been in long-term decline, having lost its Burlington anchor last year and cycling through tenants as national chains retrench. Current occupants include DD\u2019s Discounts, Foot Locker and Bath &amp; Body Works, plus a small food court. It\u2019s separately owned by South Florida-based\n4th Dimension Properties\n.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Will Kwan, a co-op board member who testified Tuesday against a bill requiring boards to tell rejected buyers why they were denied, said he can \u201ccount on one hand the number of applications we have rejected\u201d during his 28 years on the board.\nSo, if the bill passes, only about once every seven years would his board have to explain a rejection to a would-be buyer. Not a compelling argument against it, Mr. Kwan!\nBut I don\u2019t want to pick on a long-serving, unpaid board member. I am one myself. Fortunately, City Council member Eric Dinowitz voiced an even more illogical argument for me to highlight.\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be more prudent to just get more data, get better data before we invariably increase the risk for individual board members and increase the costs for shareholders?\u201d he said, according to\nSheridan Wall\u2019s article\n.\nDid you pick up on Dinowitz\u2019s hypocrisy? It\u2019s subtle at first but becomes clearer if you read his quote two or three times.\nDinowitz demands data while saying something wholly unsupported by data. To quote Dinowitz, before making claims, wouldn\u2019t it be prudent for him to just get more and better data showing the bill would \u201cinvariably\u201d increase the risk and costs for shareholders?\nAll he has to do is look at what happened in Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk counties after they passed similar legislation. Spoiler alert: Nothing. There was no increase in lawsuits filed by rejected buyers.\n\u201cThere is nothing about writing a letter that increases your costs,\u201d Craig Gurian, executive director of the Anti-Discrimination Center, told me. \u201cAnd the idea that there\u2019s an army of lawyers out there waiting to feast off non-compliant disclosures is patently absurd.\u201d\nAs readers of\nThe Real Deal\nknow, I often criticize Council bills that would create compliance headaches but little or no benefit. And I have not hesitated to call out Council member\nPierina Sanchez\nor Public Advocate\nJumaane Williams\nwhen I think they\u2019re wrong.\nBut, like most real estate agents, I believe they\u2019re right that people applying to buy into a co-op deserve a timely answer from the board and to know why they are rejected. Fears of litigation have not been borne out where such laws were implemented.\nIt\u2019s quite possible that bidders who are kept in limbo or rejected without explanation are\nmore\nlikely to sue. Give them answers and they tend to move on with their house hunting.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nChristine Quinn\u2019s nonprofit WIN (formerly Women In Need) came up with a Chutes and Ladders-style\nboard game\nto cleverly demonstrate the pitfalls families face while navigating the city\u2019s\nlong, complicated process\nto get affordable housing. Should the Real Estate Board of New York come up with a landlord\u2019s version for any particular program? Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: With Steve Buscemi\u2019s sale of his Park Slope townhouse, there might be no movie stars left in Park Slope other than John Turturro. The neighborhood previously lost Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, Jennifer Connelly and Paul Bettany, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard, and probably some others that I\u2019m forgetting. Kelly McGillis (Tom Cruise\u2019s love interest in the original \u201cTop Gun\u201d) is long gone from the brownstone on Garfield Place she had in the 1980s.\nElsewhere\u2026\nIn a recent \u201cwhat we\u2019re thinking about\u201d item, I asked if real estate firms are susceptible to the same kind of corruption that led to the conviction of 70 NYCHA employees for taking kickbacks from contractors they hired.\nOne industry veteran replied: \u201cThere is NO question that landlords, property managers, and \u2014 I would toss in \u2014 contractors and architectural firms are vulnerable to their employees\u2019 dishonesty.\u201d\nIt seems to me that whenever one person is spending another person\u2019s money, kickbacks will be a temptation.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$7.8 million\nfor a 7,414-square-foot condominium unit at 87 Leonard Street in Tribeca. Emily Beare, Lexi Alper and Beth Doud Tomashoff with CORE had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$5.5 million\nfor a former Family Dollar store at 224-11 Linden Boulevard in Cambria Heights.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$16.75 million\nfor a co-op unit at The Dakota, 1 West 72nd Street on the Upper West Side. Daniela Kunen with Douglas Elliman has\nthe listing\n.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 15,230-square-foot, 18-unit project at 715 East 224th Street in Wakefield. Mohammad Badaly filed the permit.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Sometimes all it takes is one big fish.\nThe hush-hush ultra-luxury offering from Atlas Capital Group and Zeckendorf Development at 80 Clarkson Street is the first Manhattan condo project to crack a projected sellout of over $2 billion since the\ninfamous Xi from HFZ Capital in 2018\n.\nThe two-tower project along the West Side Highway helped push the total sellout for the 10 most expensive condo projects in Manhattan above the $3 billion mark for the first time in the last three years.\nThat $3 billion serves as a new benchmark shows how far removed the city is from the boomtown years when multiple projects each year would cross the billion-dollar sellout threshold.\nAfter 80 Clarkson, which represents a staggering 63 percent of the total sellout volume of the top 10 condos filed this year, there is not a single project with a projected volume of over $400 million.\nPart of the low-key totals may be due to buildings holding back on pricing all of their units. MRR Development\u2019s Malabar Residence at 126 East 57th Street, for example, only has pricing on 38 of its 145 residential units, which explains why the project, which sits on the eastern end of Billionaires\u2019 Row, has a sellout of just over $100 million.\nAt the same time, top projects in recent years have continued to shrink. Of the top 10 condo filings, half have fewer than 50 units.\nThe years of dwindling sellouts may be catching up with the city, as multiple development marketing firms are projecting\nrecord-low inventory levels\nheading into 2026.\nDetails on the 10 most expensive projects that are underway and filed this year can be found below, which\nThe Real Deal\nanalyzed using plans filed with the attorney general and data from New York City.\n80 Clarkson Street | $2.2B\nAfter years of slicing and dicing its valuable land holdings along the West Side Highway, Atlas Capital Group partnered up with Zeckendorf Development to launch 80 Clarkson, the\nmost expensive project the city has seen in years\n.\nWith Baupost as equity partner, Atlas and the Zeckendorfs bought out another developer from the site with a\n$322 million loan from Blackstone\nin 2022 before going on to secure the largest residential construction loan in the city since the pandemic, a\n$985 million construction loan\nfrom Cale Street Partners and Farallon Capital Management.\nAll of that financing has helped build out some of the most expensive units in Downtown Manhattan, including an\n$80 million penthouse\nthat spans over 7,000 square feet.\nBut time will tell if all the investment has paid off, as the building hasn\u2019t reported a single contract since launching sales earlier this year. Cookfox is designing the building, and an in-house team led by Dan Tubb and Amy Williamson is overseeing sales.\n400 East 84th Street | $328M\nRelated Companies has bucked the trend of converting buildings into rentals by instead turning rentals into condos at The Strathmore on 400 East 84th Street on the Upper East Side.\nAfter securing a $100 million refinancing from Tyko Capital on the 48-story building earlier this year, Related set about converting the long-time rental building to capitalize on the growing demand in the Upper East Side.\nPricing is running relatively affordable for the area, with one bedrooms starting at $1.1 million and the most expensive four-bedroom units topping out around $5.5 million.\nThe 144-unit development is being designed by Tony Ingrao and Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group launched sales in October.\n142 West 21st Street | $170M\nYiannes Einhorn\u2019s Grid Group is turning a former two-story parking garage in Chelsea into a high-end condo building at 142 West 21st Street. It\nbought the site for $31 million in 2021\n.\nDesigned by BKSK Architects, the development, called The Myles, features 16 parking spaces for its 22 units. The priciest condo is the 13th-floor five-bedroom penthouse with a private rooftop spa pool, going for $17 million.\nNicole Hechter and Masayo Hashimoto of Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group are leading sales and marketing for the project.\n201 East 23rd Street | $164M\nAfter claiming the top two spots in last year\u2019s top condo filing list, Naftali Group came in fourth this year with its project The Willow at 201 East 23rd Street in Kips Bay.\nIn 2023, Naftali\npaid $21.5 million to lease the site\nfor 99 years from Snake River Development, an entity of BNS Real Estate. Designed by Cookfox, the 19-story brick facade will have 69 units, a private courtyard, rooftop terrace, fitness center and screening room.\nAlexa Lambert and Compass New Development Marketing launched sales in April and closings are expected to begin next year. The building is more than halfway sold, according to Marketproof.\n133 East 55th Street | $132M\nA joint venture from Rybak Development and BK Developers is developing a 20-story condo building on the corners of Lexington Avenue and 55th Street.\nThe team purchased the site for $24 million in 2021 and secured a $52 million construction loan from Emerald Creek Capital last year. The project will house 31 condos and include amenities like a spa complex, fitness center, and outdoor rec area.\nPrices range from just under $2 million for a one-bedroom to over $10 million for a three-bedroom penthouse.\nZproekt Architecture is designing the building and sales do not appear to have launched yet.\n350 East 18th Street | $116M\nA joint venture from Israeli-based Minrav Development and NYC-based T&amp;E 1 Development is developing a 54-unit condo project in Gramercy.\nThe developers picked up the site for $28.5 million in 2020 and secured a $63 million construction from Northwind Group in 2024.\nDesigned by ARC Architecture + Design Studio, the building will include 18 parking spaces, a full-time doorman, gym and rooftop terrace. Prices start at under $2 million for a one-bedroom and up to $6 million for a three-bedroom penthouse, which is one of the 14 units in contract at the building, according to Marketproof.\nJohn Gomes and Fredrik Eklund of the Eklund Gomes Team and Douglas Elliman Development Marketing launched sales this fall.\n24-28 West 9th Street | $115M\nOphir Sternberg\u2019s Lionheart Capital is turning a pre-war apartment building into 45 luxury condos on a coveted stretch of Greenwich Village.\nSternberg bought the property for $41.5 million in 2022 and Stonehill Taylor designed the conversion of the 1923 building.\nPrices range from just under $2 million for a one-bedroom to over $5 million for a three-bedroom penthouse with 1,270 square feet of outdoor space. Shlomi Reuveni\u2019s Reuveni Development Marketing launched sales this fall.\n126 East 57th Street | $111M\nA development triumvirate led by Rotem Rosen is developing the newest Billionaires\u2019 Row entrant, the Malabar Residences.\nIn 2019, Rosen, Israeli developer Zahi Hagag and Indian billionaire Anand Mahindra\u2019s\ndropped almost $104 million cash\non a 13-parcel assemblage. The developers then secured a\n$170 million construction loan\nfrom Bank OZK in 2022 for their roughly 350-foot-tall project.\nThe developers have only released pricing for roughly a quarter of the 145 units in the building, and prices range from under $2 million for a one-bedroom to over $12 million for a three-bedroom penthouse. Designed by ODA Architecture, the building includes a fitness center, swimming pool, spa pool, steam room, sauna and indoor half-basketball court.\nThe project has moved in fits and starts. Rosen\u2019s development firm MRR had to\nplead with a court\nnot once, but twice, to grant access to a neighboring property in order to continue work on the project.\nEarlier this year, the project lost its sales director when\nNoble Black\ndecamped to Corcoran\nfrom Douglas Elliman. Maria Mainieri took over as sales director, according to her website, and is marketing the building along with Douglas Elliman Development Marketing.\n118 West 13th Street | $92M\nSlate Property Group has claim to the smallest development on the list with their project at 118 West 13th Street dubbed The Katherine.\nIn 2021, Slate\nbought the site for $22.9 million\nwith private equity partner Avenue Realty Capital and gutted the seven-story building. Incredibly, the 34,000-square-foot property once housed 175 students as a dorm for The New School. BKSK Architects and designer Nate Berkus converted the building into just eight residences starting at just under $10 million.\nSeven of the units have already sold since Compass\u2019 Leonard Steinberg launched sales in the spring with Compass Development Marketing. The remaining available condo is the top-floor penthouse, asking over $22 million.\n114 East 25th Street | $74M\nAdellco has already sold through its 20 units at the Armorie after announcing its planned sales launch in February. The trick? Sell them all to one buyer.\nThe developer bought the commercial building from crowdfunding firm Prodigy Network and Shorewood Real Estate Group for $41.3 million five years ago in order to convert it into condos.\nAfter Corcoran Group\u2019s Hottinger Team started quietly marketing the residential units in the spring, a buyer came forward with an offer to buy them and the building\u2019s commercial space for $71 million. The buyer was a private family office, Adellco founder and CEO Matthew Adell previously told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nConstruction is expected to be complete in the first quarter of next year and amenities will include a gym, roof deck and lounge. Andre Kikoski Architecture is designing the building.",

        "content": "The vultures are circling\ntroubled multifamily investor Jon Venetos\n.\nThe founder of Dallas-based Lurin Capital was hit with two new lawsuits from Keybank claiming he defaulted on $24 million in loans, filings with Dallas County District Court show.\nKeybank is asking the court to appoint an emergency receiver for the properties tied to the loans: Villa Del Tesoro, at 7802 Villa Cliff Drive, and 46 Eleven, at 4611 Samuell Boulevard. Both are in Dallas.\nThe bank alleges Venetos defaulted on the $16.85 million loan tied to the 229-unit Villas Del Tesoro and the $7.15 million loan tied to 79-unit 46 Eleven. Keybank originated the loans on a refinance of the properties in October 2024. It claims Venetos personally guaranteed the loans.\nVenetos stopped paying monthly interest payments on the loans in June, and failed to pay them off when they matured in October, Keybank claims. In addition, he stopped paying property taxes and insurance for the properties and allowed liens to be placed against them, Keybank said in the filing.\nThe lender further alleges that Venetos transferred a total of $24,570 from his Keybank accounts to a personal account. Inspections conducted in October 2025 revealed multiple units out of commission in each property, deferred repairs and mold, the bank said.\nLeaving the properties in Venetos\u2019 control \u201cthreatens to accelerate the deterioration\u201d of the assets.\nThe Keybank filings are the latest in a passel of default lawsuits from Venetos\u2019 lenders.\nHe started losing properties in April, when Acore claimed he defaulted on nearly $400 million in loans tied to properties in Florida and Texas and started\nauctioning off the Florida properties\n. Acore also claims he personally guarantied the loans and is asking for an\n$81 million judgment\nagainst him.\nIn the last three months, Venetos has been hit with a succession of lawsuits, starting with one\nfrom Select Securities Europe\n, which accused him of defaulting on 15 loans totaling $40.5 million. There was a\nlawsuit from Fannie Mae\n, accusing him of defaulting on a $77.2 million loan tied to a Houston apartment complex.\nVista Bank also sued him\n, claiming he personally guaranteed a $10.3 million loan Vista provided for the purchase of a Fort Worth apartment complex. Vista alleges Venetos still owes $3 million.\nThere\u2019s a fraud element to Vista\u2019s accusation. In the suit, it accused him of \u201cattempting to obtain credit at another financial institution using false, altered, or fraudulent account statements of Vista.\u201d\nLurin also got slapped with a\ntemporary restraining order\nthat ordered residents of a Lurin-owned property in Plano to vacate due to unsafe conditions, including lack of access to water, sewer or gas.\n",

        "content": "Ortsac Capital Group bought a 206-unit apartment complex in Pembroke Pines for $52.5 million, marking a slight discount from its purchase price six years ago.\nThe deal at a 5.6 percent discount comes amid higher\ninterest rates\nand South Florida\u2019s multifamily market\nslowdown\ncompared to the post-pandemic boom.\nOrtsac\n, led by married couple Bobby and Sofia Castro, bought the Ventura Pointe property at 7850 Pasadena Boulevard from Dallas-based\nLloyd Jones\n, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The price breaks down to $254,854 per apartment.\nThe buyer assumed the seller\u2019s existing $38.6 million loan from MetLife Real Estate Lending and refinanced it as a Fannie Mae loan, bumping up the total $45 million.\nCompleted in 2018 on nearly 10 acres, the complex consists of two five-story buildings and two four-story buildings, Vizzda records show. Palm Beach Gardens-based\nEastwind Development\nbuilt Ventura Pointe.\nLloyd Jones, led by Christopher Finlay, paid\n$55.6 million\nfor Ventura Pointe in 2019, records show.\nThe firm, a multifamily and senior housing investor, has developed, owned and managed about $1.2 billion in multifamily properties since 1990, according to its website.\nFort Lauderdale-based Ortsac, a private family office also led by the Castro couple\u2019s children and grandchildren, has a portfolio of more than $700 million of multifamily assets under management and investments in commercial real estate, its website says. Bobby, who describes himself as a self-made entrepreneur, and Sofia Castro founded and owned\nBankers Healthcare Group\n, which they sold. They also founded and lead Stack and Rack, a three-day multifamily investment bootcamp, according to the Castros\u2019 LinkedIns and Bobby\u2019s website.\nIn 2021, Ortsac sold the 368-unit Lakeview Flats apartment complex at 8800 Northwest 78th Court and 8900 Northwest 77th Court in Tamarac for\n$69 million\n. That same year, it sold the 368-unit Golfview Flats apartment complex at 8445 Springtree Drive in Sunrise for\n$15 million\n.\nSouth Florida\u2019s multifamily market boomed in the years after the pandemic\u2019s onset due to an influx of out-of-staters, creating unprecedented demand and\nrecord rent growth\n.\nBut after developers seized on the bonanza with a flurry of new projects, the region experienced a record\n18,600 completions\nlast year just as the pipeline of new residents slowed. This led to slower lease-ups and a drop in rents, with Realtor.com showing the median asking rent in the tri-county region decreased 3 percent in October, year-over-year.\nAlthough the Federal Reserve cut the benchmark rate four times this year and last, it had imposed 11 aggressive increases in 2022 and 2023. As a result, some landlords are struggling to refinance maturing loans or meet debt obligations on floating-rate debt. Some lenders retrenched from issuing new loans while they worked out extensions and forbearance agreements with existing borrowers.\nDiscounted multifamily deals have popped up in South Florida.\nIn September, Waterton Residential sold the 427-unit Solena West Miami complex at 2001 and 2101 Ludlam Road/Southwest 67th Avenue in West Miami for\n$111 million\n, marking a 4.7 percent discount from its previous $116.4 million price. Waterton had bought the two-building complex in two deals in 2016 and 2017.\nLast year, Rreef Property Trust sold the 368-unit Marela complex at 250 Northwest 130th Avenue in Pembroke Pines for\n$110 million\n, or 9 percent less than the firm had paid in 2021.\n",

        "content": "Renowned architect Robert A.M. Sterns,\nwho died last week\nat the age of 86, will be primarily remembered for the condos he designed in New York City and\nSouth Florida\n.\nThe founder of Robert A.M. Sterns Architects (RAMSA) also garnered recognition for what\u2019s shaping up to be a genre-defining project in Texas. In addition to New York entries such as the Naftali Group\u2019s\nBellemont\nand\n15 Central Park West\nfor Arthur and William Lie Zeckendorf, the list of notable Stern-designed projects will soon include Howard Hughes Holdings\u2019 Ritz-Carlton Residences in The Woodlands.\nThe Real Deal tapped the project as an \u201c\nit building\n\u201d earlier this year. As Ritz-Carlton\u2019s first stand-alone condo project in Texas, it adds a new level of luxury to the state\u2019s burgeoning condo market.\nIt\u2019s also a project of which Stern was very proud, said Johnny Cruz, a RAMSA partner working on the Ritz. Cruz, who\u2019s been at the firm for 26 years and said Stern was \u201clike family,\u201d called the project \u201cone of his favorites.\u201d\n\u201cHe was very much involved from day one,\u201d he said.\nCities like New York and Miami are swimming in high-end condo projects, but in Texas, luxury residential real estate has long revolved around the ranch. The Ritz-Carlton Residences is a big swing that will test demand for high-end vertical living.\nSo far, it\u2019s looking like a big swing worth taking. Before the foundation was laid, 69 percent of the 111 units were pre-sold, prompting Howard Hughes to pause presales and open up a waitlist.\nCruz contends that the project has opened the floodgates of branded condos in Houston by giving others \u201cthe courage to follow suit.\u201d Since the Ritz started taking shape, Sunny Bathija\u2019s Satya unveiled plans for a standalone St. Regis condo tower in Houston\u2019s Rice/Military. Deiso Moss announced it\u2019s building a Ritz-Carlton condo tower and hotel in Houston\u2019s Uptown/Galleria neighborhood.\nThe project sits on 8 acres on Lake Woodlands and includes a 15-story building and an 11-story. The design highlights the scenic lakefront with views across the lake.\nStern was inspired by Houston\u2019s River Oaks neighborhood, Cruz said, so the project was designed to incorporate the tradition of John Staub, the early-20th century residential architect who designed single-family homes throughout the prestigious enclave.\nCruz describes Staub\u2019s style as having \u201ca restrained sense of detail\u201d and \u201ctimeless design\u201d\nCruz touched on what makes the project unique at an\nOctober event\nthat was part of BSH and The Real Deal\u2019s Building Luxury series.\nThe Ritz-Carlton Residences was also designed with the end-user in mind. Many Houston condo buyers are empty-nesters who are downsizing from single-family homes. To ease the transition to vertical living, the design offers a uniquely wide variety of apartment layouts to provide buyers with the sense of individuality baked into the single-family home. Of the 111 units, 55 are unique.\n\u201cAll beautiful American neighborhoods have variety in terms of the houses,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cSo that same attitude, but combined in a condominium.\u201d\nThe Ritz project will be RAMSA\u2019s ninth in Texas.\nThe firm designed the Residences at the Ritz-Carlton Dallas, a 70-unit condo tower that includes hotel amenities. The brick and limestone building is designed in a simplified Regency style.\nThe firm\u2019s other Texas projects are mostly public landmarks. RAMSA designed the upgrade for the Cox School of Business at Southern Methodist University in Dallas as well as the George W. Bush Presidential Center, also at Southern Methodist University.\n",

        "content": "Rockwood Capital\u2019s Christmas wish came true: it sold its Midtown office tower near Grand Central Terminal. But it may feel like a stocking of coal compared to previous offloading efforts.\nSovereign Partners sealed the deal on a $273 million acquisition of 2 Grand Central Tower on Thursday, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The deal for the 667,000-square-foot property breaks down to $409 per square foot.\nThis year, Rockwood put the property on the market, seeking a sale price of roughly $270 million. The last time the private equity investor tried to sell, back in February 2020 (shortly before the Covid-19 pandemic hit), Rockwood had expected to sell the tower for\nclose to $580 million\n, more than double its more recent aspiration.\nRockwood purchased the office building in 2011 from Boston Properties, now BXP, for $401 million. Boston Properties bought it for almost $428 million in 2008 from Harry Macklowe, who developed it.\nThe Promote\nreported\nthat Sovereign Partners was finalizing a deal for the office building towards the end of October, but it didn\u2019t close until this week.\nEastdil Secured\u2019s Gary Phillips and Will Silverman negotiated the transaction. Buyer and seller did not return requests for comment from the Observer.\nRockwood\nsecured\na $262.6 million refinancing of the 44-story tower in July, replacing the previous $260 million loan on the property made in 2018; both loans came courtesy of MetLife, which is providing $177 million in acquisition financing to Sovereign.\nTenants include the Nuvo Group, Maersk, Cigna and various financial, legal and professional services firms. Rockwood also has its headquarters in the building.\nRockwood recently announced that it would integrate its operations into Harrison Street Asset Management; the two companies are subsidiaries of Colliers International. Two months ago, it listed the 230,000-square-foot office building at 1 Broadway in the Financial District, seeking\n$180 million\n.\nCyrus and Darius Sakhai\u2019s Sovereign Partners are investors in the Midtown East market. Last year, it bought 780 Third Avenue from Nuveen for $178 million. Earlier, Sovereign Partners landed 100-104 FIfth Avenue from Clarion Partners for the\nheavily discounted price\nof $125 million.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner",

        "content": "What keeps New York\u2019s top commercial real estate players awake at night? Politics.\n\u201cIt\u2019s political risk at all levels,\u201d Related Companies\u2019 Jeff Blau said during a panel discussion on Wednesday. \u201cNational, state and city.\u201d\nBlau joined a group of CRE heavyweights \u2014 Bill Rudin of Rudin Management, Winston Fisher of Fisher Brothers and Mary Ann Tighe of CBRE \u2014 on stage at the NYU Schack Institute of Real Estate capital markets conference to discuss, among other things, the looming uncertainty posed by Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.\nPanelists weighed the broader social proposals Mamdani has championed. Free childcare and subsidized transportation, Fisher argued, aren\u2019t just social gestures, they\u2019re economic levers that could keep more families in the city. The cost of early childhood care is a massive tax on the working and middle class, he said. He also proposed offering free bus service to select groups, like CUNY students, noting that transportation costs prevent many from completing their degrees.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real estate angle that he\u2019s talking about, but it is infinitely deeper than that,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cWe are tethered to New York. We have to help him solve these problems because they are growing every day.\u201d\nBut Tighe cautioned against comingling housing legislation with social mandates.\n\u201cOne of the challenges for this mayor is there\u2019s a lot of virtue signaling going on \u2014 free this, free that,\u201d Tighe said. \u201cBut the reality of it is, you have to understand if you want to build housing, focus on building housing. Because if there\u2019s anything that history has shown us, you make a clear, crisp piece of legislation that has a target, and these folks will make it a reality.\u201d\nBlau said he is hopeful that Mamdani will continue the current mayor\u2019s initiatives that encourage companies to come to New York.\n\u201cThe reason companies come here is because talent wants to be here,\u201d Blau said. \u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s the mayor\u2019s job to make New York City the place where people want to continue to come.\u201d\nThe city\u2019s housing shortage dominated much of the discussion. Rudin zeroed in on the vacant rent-stabilized units kept off the market due to restrictions on rent increases.\n\u201cRaise that cap, you would see within six months these units come back on the market,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that the mayor-elect, we\u2019ve told him and his people.\u201d\nAll the panelists emphasized the need for the city government to work with private developers to draft legislation that makes sense. Not surprisingly, they were critical of the city\u2019s 485x tax break, which includes a wage floor that kicks in for projects with 100 or more units, making it difficult for large projects to pencil out.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a plethora of opportunities to continue to create more housing,\u201d Fisher said, adding that there needs to be incentive for the private sector. \u201cThat\u2019s the rub. I think if he allows private capital to come in and have an adequate return, private capital will build.\u201d\nDespite the clear uncertainty, the panel struck a cautiously optimistic tone. Fisher and Tighe highlighted New York\u2019s resilience, cultural vibrancy and tolerance for difference as reasons to believe the city can thrive, whatever way the political winds blow. While his ideology is unmistakable, panelists noted signs that Mamdani might navigate city politics with a mix of conviction and compromise.\n\u201cHe sort of plays the \u2018I didn\u2019t realize how complex it was gonna be\u2019 card very often, and with that, he says, \u2018I\u2019ll be more pragmatic now,\u2019\u201d Fisher said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true or not. We\u2019ll find out shortly, but he is learning very quickly that there\u2019s a ton of powerful constituencies that have a real voice, and when they speak, you have no choice but to listen.\u201d\n",

        "content": "One year later, sweeping changes to New York City\u2019s zoning rules are shaping the trajectory of housing projects.\nDevelopers are moving forward with plans for larger residential buildings. Air rights deals are\nheating up\n. Homeowners are moving forward with adding so-called granny flats.\nFriday is the\none-year anniversary\nof the City Council\u2019s\npassage\nof the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, a text amendment that eliminated parking mandates from some parts of the city, legalized accessory dwelling units, created new high-density residential districts, expanded what office buildings can be converted to residential and\nmuch more\n.\nIn recognition of the one-year mark, the Department of City Planning on Friday released a few stats on the progress of the text amendment.\nCity of Yes created the Universal Affordability Preference program, which\nreplaced\nthe city\u2019s Voluntary Inclusionary Housing program. The program provides a 20 percent density bonus to projects if the extra space is dedicated to permanently affordable housing, which must, on average, be affordable to those earning 60 percent of the area median income.\nThe city released applications for UAP in April, and has since received applications for more than 100 housing developments, according to City Planning. The agency would not provide details on these properties, but indicated that the projects are expected to net 5,400 new homes, of which 900 would be affordable.\nCity of Yes also\nmade it easier\nto transfer air rights from landmarked buildings and freed some of these transactions from the city\u2019s land-use review process (transfers that would increase the height of a project by more than 25 percent still need a special permit, though).\nThe changes have spurred more of these deals than in previous years. Five buildings have since sought approval for such air rights transfers, which would result in 400,000 square feet of new development, according to City Planning. By comparison, the city received only 15 applications for this kind of transfer over the last 50 years.\nSince launching applications for accessory dwelling units in September, 98 homeowners in the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island have applied.\nCity of Yes also created two new residential zoning districts, known as R11 and R12. In such districts (which must be applied through a rezoning), buildings can be 15 or 18 times the size of the lot where they are constructed, referred to as having a floor area ratio of 15 or 18.\nThese districts have only been mapped once so far, as part of the\nMidtown South\nrezoning. The districts have been proposed at two individual sites:\n395 Flatbush Avenue Extension\nin Downtown Brooklyn and\na site above\nthe Second Avenue subway extension.\nOfficials projected that City of Yes would add 80,000 housing units over the next 15 years. Whether that comes to fruition will depend on myriad factors, including to what extent future administrations and City Council members support development.\nSome in the industry think the current Council might stifle construction if it passes\nfour bills\nthat would set new rules for affordable housing production in the city. Developers have also argued that construction wage rules attached to the property tax break 485x will lead to less housing, and stunt the impact of City of Yes, as well as the housing ballot measures that voters approved in November.\n",

That sale marked a record for Sea Ranch Lakes, a small town about 5 miles away from Inter Miami\u2019s Fort Lauderdale stadium.\nThe 7,100-square-foot home, built in 2023, sits on a 0.3-acre lot with about 100 feet of frontage on Lake Seneca. The home includes a three-car garage. Veroushka Volkert of One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has the listing. She also brokered the previous sale.\nESPN reported in October that Busquets plans to take a break from soccer before he pursues coaching.\n\u201cI think in the future, yes [I\u2019d want to be a coach], but for now I\u2019d rather take a sabbatical,\u201d\nBusquets told reporters\n. \u201cIt\u2019s a long time, with hardly any weekends. \u2026 You want to enjoy time with your family, time for me, for them, seeing my children, being with them, traveling more, watching football from a different perspective.\u201d\nBusquets played for FC Barcelona from 2008 until he and Lionel Messi joined Inter Miami, the MLS team owned by brothers\nJorge and Jose Mas\n,\nDavid Beckham\nand other investors.\nMessi lives nearby. Also in 2023, he and his wife, Antonela Roccuzzo,\npaid $10.8 million\nfor a 10,500-square-foot, eight-bedroom estate in Fort Lauderdale\u2019s Bay Colony neighborhood. He also owns luxury condos\nin Sunny Isles Beach\n, including a unit at Porsche Design Tower, which was completed by Gil Dezer\u2019s Dezer Development in late 2016.Inter Miami, which includes\nAres Management\n, is moving quickly to complete a $1 billion mixed-use stadium development near Miami International Airport.

        "content": "As the Chicago area multifamily scene keeps heating up, midmarket dealmakers are finding a sweet spot in the city.\nA trio of recent sales on the North and West sides of the city indicates that both local and out-of-state buyers are taking interest in Chicago\u2019s inventory of midsized apartment buildings.\nAt 501 West Deming Place in Lincoln Park, the estate of John A. Brown sold the deceased investor\u2019s 56-unit building for $19.4 million last month. The buyers were a joint venture led by Chicago-based Hayes Properties.\nBrown was a longtime owner of the property and last refinanced it for $11.5 million in 2016. The recent $19.4 million sale price came out to about $346,000 per unit, though two groundfloor retail spaces somewhat skew the price per unit.\n\u201cThis generational location garnered a lot of buyer interest from both institutional firms and families which allowed us to achieve an above-ask purchase price with a solid buyer,\u201d Interra Realty Broker Colin O\u2019Malley said.\nBrown earlier this year also sold a long-vacant Gold Coast building. The property, which Brown had planned to convert to condos at one point, sold to Chicago-based developer\nAltitude Capital for $10 million\n.\nWhile highrises have to compete for sparse institutional capital, midmarket properties are garnering interest from buyers who can tap into alternative sources of funding.\n\u201cWe\u2019re finding not only through our capital markets group, but also our clients, that in the midmarket space, financing is not a problem \u2026 from the small regional or local lenders all the way up to the national lenders,\u201d said Essex Realty broker Jim Darrow. \u201cThey want to lend in Chicago and they want to lend on good, well-located assets.\u201d\nDarrow recently arranged a $15.7 million sale on behalf of Chicago developers Frank Campise and Jim Jann of\nJAB Real Estate\n, which completed a development play with the deal.\nJAB bought a development site at 1553 North Wells Street in Old Town in 2017 and built a 23-unit apartment building with one ground-floor retail space. The retail component is currently occupied by national coffee chain Philz Coffee.\nGround-up development is rare in Old Town, where much of the area is already built out and older buildings still carry high replacement costs, Darrow said.\n\u201cThese older, vintage-type buildings, they\u2019re worth a lot of money,\u201d Darrow said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to tear them down and build new construction.\u201d\nThe JAB property got interest from local and out of state buyers and ultimately sold to San Francisco-based Epp Properties. The sale came out to roughly $682,000 per unit.\nFurther northwest in the city, developer\nNoah Properties\nsold Block Belmont, a midsize building in Belmont Cragin, to local investor Terezia Covaci for $18.5 million.\nNoah, which is led by husband-and-wife duo Bart Przyjemski and Anita Lisek, bought the development site in 2020 for $750,000 with a $525,000 loan from Belmont Bank and Trust.\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly how much the developers put into the construction of the apartment building, but they initially took out a $9.7 million construction loan from Parkview Financial and later refinanced the property with a $13 million loan from GreenState Credit Union in 2023.\n",

It wasn\u2019t a question, it was: \u2018let\u2019s find the right property.\u2019\u201d\nThey ended up with a Chelsea condo for just under $5 million.\nBarron\u2019s client is one of many finance workers in the city with a winning lottery ticket in the form of a big year-end bonus. The city\u2019s biggest firms have turned in some of their best trading years in history, and New York City brokers told\nThe Real Deal\nthat cash flow has inspired a slew of buyers.\nBusiness hawks strategized and spent to prevent Zohran Mamdani\u2019s bid for mayor, but the city\u2019s\nluxury market hasn\u2019t skipped a beat following his election\nand the doomsday predictions that came with it.\nBut the timing makes sense: Wall Street bonuses are expected to bounce back this year after a lull, with one\nforecast projecting a rise to their highest level in four years\n.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with a lot of finance people right now that are, I think, feeling very bullish,\u201d said Brown Harris Stevens\u2019 Lisa Simonsen.\nBonuses in the securities industry rose 34 percent to a record $47.5 billion in 2024, according to a\nreport\nfrom the state comptroller\u2019s office. Trading firms like Jane Street Capital in particular rode booming equities markets to\nrecord trading profits\nlast year, with many companies on pace to do the same in 2025.\nEmployees at these firms, who often pay interns six-figure salaries, can earn millions in bonuses alone. In 2024, Jane Street gave out over\n$2.4 billion in bonuses\n, an average of $900,000 per employee.\nBarron said she has two more clients who work for Jane Street looking for Downtown Manhattan homes in the $5 million range after renting what \u201cyou would rent right out of college\u201d for the last year.\n\u201cThey could have afforded far more than what they were renting, but I think they honestly were just working so hard that they just needed a bed to sleep in,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now, of course, they\u2019re out shopping to buy because it paid off.\u201d\nWhile the first-time buyers splurging on their first apartments have been pumping the $5 million-plus market, industry veterans have been trading some of the city\u2019s trophy properties as well this year.\nEarlier this year, a financier was behind a Downtown Manhattan record. Harsh Padia, CEO of trading firm HAP Capital, sold his\nduplex at the Witkoff Group\u2019s 150 Charles Street for $60 million\n. The buyer was\nreportedly\nfrom Jane Street Capital, which has its office just minutes away down the West Side Highway.\nCompass\u2019 Zeve Salman, who represented the buyer on that deal, said he\u2019s working with at least a dozen other buyers looking for homes over $30 million and only sees prices going up.\n\u201cI would almost guarantee you\u2019ll see more records broken before the end of the year, and that is all post-election,\u201d he said. \u201cThe numbers that we\u2019re discussing with people, the type of properties that we were discussing \u2014 it\u2019s the exact same caliber, and it\u2019s still all local people.\u201d\nLuxury sales in the city have been particularly strong in recent months, after a spring market bogged down by economic and geopolitical uncertainty. In November, contracts signed in Manhattan for homes asking at least $4 million rose 51 percent year-over-year, according to a report from Miller Samuel. And in Brooklyn, the borough has seen contract volume crack $100 million in each of the last two months, a rarity for the borough.\n\u201cThere were not enough buyers actively looking last spring, and it\u2019s been night and day to this fall,\u201d said Compass Kallie Catt, who has put four homes into contract in the last several weeks, including a Dumbo condo asking $5.5 million.\nBuyers who have profited from the stock market in the last few years may have another motivation to buy real estate in the city \u2014 getting out of the market.\nCorcoran\u2019s Ryan Kaplan said many of his clients in finance \u201cfeel that the market is objectively frothy.\u201d\n\u201cThings are very rosy for these kinds of people, financially speaking,\u201d said Kaplan. \u201cSo that\u2019s probably why we\u2019re starting to see them deploying capital.\u201d\nDespite the money flowing into the market, Kaplan said buyers \u2014 especially the fiscally savvy ones \u2014 are still wary about getting a good deal. \u201cThere is this sense of opportunism,\u201d he said, where buyers know that inflation is still high, debt is still expensive and the presidential and mayoral elections have ruffled some feathers.\nThat maneuvering has meant\nsellers getting realistic with pricing\nhas been just as important for the market this fall, according to Douglas Elliman\u2019s Michelle Griffith. \u201cIf buyers wanted to come into the market earlier this year, the sellers weren\u2019t as flexible,\u201d she said.\nBut desperate buyers trying to fearmonger their way into a discount after the election may still be out of luck, according to Salman.\n[\u201cAgents will] come to a $10 million listing and it\u2019ll be like, \u2018Well, you know, the election \u2014 so he really thinks it\u2019s worth $9 million,\u2019\u201d Salman said.\nBut, for now at least, \u201cthose same properties end up selling close to their asking price,\u201d he added.\n",

        "content": "Beyond Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s interests in connecting with princes, former presidents and financial heavyweights, the\nlate, disgraced\nfinancier sometimes extended his attention to commercial real estate.\nAmong the more than 20,000 documents obtained by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform from Epstein\u2019s estate and released to the public in November were emails with links to\nThe Real Deal\narticles and what appears to be a saved or printed\nTRD\nweb story from June 2019. The emails and\nTRD\narticles touched on a Palm Beach development deal, a members-only club and a dealmaker who faced tax issues.\nThe documents shed some light on Epstein\u2019s Rolodex of business contacts at a time when the source of his wealth still remains somewhat of a mystery. At the time of his death in August 2019, Epstein\u2019s net worth was close to $600 million, which was largely thanks to two clients, Les Wexner and Leon Black. Epstein was the money manager to billionaire L Brands founder Wexner and he provided tax and estate planning services to Black, a co-founder of Apollo Global Management.\nBut Epstein appears to have had a keen interest in real estate more generally.\nA review of the documents shows he was also at least nominally interested in one Palm Beach development deal. In another email, he claims to have put the founders of a popular members-only club with a location in New York City \u201cin business.\u201d One email refers to a\nTRD\narticle about a case brought against a New York developer for tax evasion. Others provide insight into Epstein\u2019s partnership with New York real estate heavyweight Andrew Farkas on a small marina in the British Virgin Islands.\nOpaque real estate connections\nEpstein had owned ultra-luxury homes, but most reporting has not suggested that he was looking at commercial projects. His own property included a mansion in Palm Beach, a townhouse in Manhattan, an estate in New Mexico and, most notably, two private islands in the Virgin Islands where his victims were allegedly sexually abused.\nThough his brother, Mark Epstein, ran a New York real estate firm called Ossa Properties, Mark consistently maintained Jeffrey was not involved. After Ossa acquired a number of condo units in a building at 301 East 66th Street in Manhattan, Mark told Crain\u2019s in 2019 that his brother was renting apartments there, and that he had acquired the building in the early \u201990s based on a tip from Jeffrey. He added that his brother was not his business partner and his brother\u2019s investment firm, J. Epstein &amp; Co., had no connection to Ossa Properties, despite public filings showing otherwise.\nBut Jonathan Barrett, who worked at Ossa Properties, told the Wall Street Journal in 2019 through a spokesperson that Ossa and J. Epstein &amp; Co. were indeed affiliated.\nJonathan Barrett\u2019s brother Anthony appears to be the point person in recent years at Ossa Properties and has signed for an affiliate of the company in public documents recorded with the city. (Ossa Properties did not return a request to comment.)\nNew details\nEmails released by Congress show that Anthony Barrett at least considered Jeffrey Epstein a possible buyer of commercial real estate in Palm Beach.\nAmong the large batch of documents is an email from Barrett to Epstein in October 2018. In the email, with the subject line \u201cDeal info,\u201d Barrett sent Epstein the text of a recent\nTRD\narticle about the Palm House hotel in Palm Beach, which was heading to a bankruptcy sale.\nAnthony Barrett: Hi jeffrey,\nCam across this\u2026perhaps you have some interest?\nEpstein responded: \u201cfunn, but quite a mess.\u201d\nFederal prosecutors had accused the previous developer of the Palm House Hotel of siphoning millions of dollars in foreign investors\u2019 money. The investors, who put in more than $44 million as part of the federal EB-5 program, filed their own lawsuit, alleging the development group falsely touted that the hotel\u2019s advisory board would include Bill Clinton and Donald Trump and Celine Dion, Bill Koch and Tony Bennett were already members at the hotel\u2019s club.\nEpstein, who had a house about a mile away in Palm Beach, apparently had some interest in the story.\nAmong the other documents provided by the Epstein estate and released by Congress was a digital version of a more\nin-depth article\nabout the saga of the Palm House hotel that\nTRD\npublished in June 2019. The document shows the story was saved a week after\nTRD\npublished the story.\nJust one month later, in July 2019, Epstein was arrested in New Jersey and charged with sex trafficking. Prosecutors alleged Epstein sexually exploited and abused dozens of underage girls. In August, Epstein died by suicide while awaiting charges in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan.\nThere were other emails discussing news articles about various real estate happenings. In an April 2018 email, Richard Kahn, Epstein\u2019s accountant, sent Epstein a\nTRD\narticle about Michael Shvo\u2019s recent settlement of his tax evasion case with the Manhattan District Attorney.\nKahn: \u201cdirection of trump? criminal tax fraud??\u201d\nEpstein responded: \u201cCareful. Max might call.\u201d\nIt is not clear who Max is or why Kahn should be careful.\nThe documents\nalso showed\nemails between Epstein and Core Club\u2019s co-founder Jennie Enterprise. Core Club, a members-only club popular with the ultra-rich and hedge funders, opened its doors in 2005 at East 55th Street.\n\u201cI helped put them in biz,\u201d Epstein wrote in a personal message to an unknown recipient in 2018, referring to Core Club\u2019s co-founders.\nCore Club, through a spokesperson, refuted the idea of Epstein\u2019s involvement.\n\u201c[I]n no way, shape, or form did this individual play any business development role in the company, and any suggestion to the contrary is baseless,\u201d the spokesperson said to\nTRD\nin an email.\n",

        "content": "A historic piece of Houston\u2019s skyline has dodged the auction block \u2014 at least for now.\nThe owner of the long-vacant Exxon-Mobil tower at 800 Bell Street wired more than $16 million in a last-minute payoff that halted a Dec. 2 foreclosure sale, resetting the clock on a troubled saga that\u2019s dragged through loan disputes, bankruptcy filings and a stalled redevelopment plan, the Houston Chronicle\nreported\n. The reprieve doesn\u2019t solve the tower\u2019s structural and financial headaches, but it keeps a potential $35 million sale on the table, according to court records.\nChicago-based Sugar Pine Development has been circling the 45-story property and was expected to close on a deal by Dec. 5, though as of earlier this week it hadn\u2019t filed anything signaling it had backed away. The firm has begun assembling a redevelopment team, the filings show.\nThe 1.2 million-square-foot building \u2014 once the headquarters of Humble Oil, a predecessor to ExxonMobil \u2014 has been vacant since Exxon left for its Spring campus in 2015.\nThe tower\u2019s owner,\nBell Business Investments\n\u2014 an affiliate of New York\u2019s\nCMI Developers\n\u2014 is keeping its options open. A principal for the firm, Isaac Jacobowitz, told the outlet that they will either form the right team to revitalize the building or sell for a reasonable price. Asked whether a sale to Sugar Pine was imminent, he said both that deal and another buyer remain possible.\nThe legal fallout traces back to Bell Business\u2019 failed attempt to convert the 1960s-era office tower into a residential-heavy mixed-use complex. Its original lender\nsold the loan\nto an entity called 800 Bell Holdings, which declared a default in July and pushed for foreclosure this fall. Bell Business fought the claims, filing for bankruptcy in October to stall the sale, then withdrawing the case weeks later to pursue a transaction. When the sale didn\u2019t materialize, 800 Bell Holdings took another run at foreclosure.\nThe payoff \u2014 funded through a $13 million refinancing from Broadview Capital that matures in January 2027 \u2014 gives Bell Business roughly a year to land a buyer or revive a redevelopment plan. But the building\u2019s condition remains a major hurdle. Court filings describe water damage, broken windows, moldy drywall and moisture intrusion. A Harris County judge granted the lender access to perform emergency repairs, and its attorney said 40 workers completed roughly $380,000 worth of fixes. Questions about asbestos remediation linger, according to the journal.\nDowntown Houston\u2019s cadre of aging megatowers has proven tough to reposition even with interest from opportunistic buyers, and the\nExxon-Mobil\nbuilding is no exception.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Day, the company announced Friday.\nSL Green now owns 100 percent of the 750,000-square-foot property. Along with the buyout, the company modified and extended the tower\u2019s $177 million mortgage.\nChief Investment Officer Harry Sitomer said the transactions exemplify SL Green\u2019s long-term outlook on what the real estate firm considers to be well-located Midtown Manhattan assets.\n\u201cWe continue to see strong momentum on Third Avenue, with residential conversions helping reposition the corridor for strong office sector growth,\u201d he said in a statement.\nThere are a number of office conversions in the works along\nThird Avenue\n, which was hit hard with vacancies during the pandemic.\nNearby, SL Green is converting the tower it owns at 750 Third Avenue into 680 apartments. At\n845 Third Avenue\n, Rudin is turning the building into 411 units.\nThose projects, along with others in Midtown, have taken supply off the market and helped to improve conditions for the remaining office properties in the area.\nCurrent tenants at 800 Third include investment advisor Kimelman &amp; Baird, management firm Renaissance Technologies and law office Kobre &amp; Kim. Asking rent for a lease last January was in the mid-$70s per square foot, according to the Commercial Observer.\nSL Green acquired a stake in 800 Third Avenue in 2006, when it created a partnership with owners Joseph P. Day Realty Corp. and the estate of Norman Levy. That initial investment, valued at $102.4 million, came in the form of a loan secured by a 47 percent interest in the building. SL Green had the option to convert the mortgage into equity.\n",

The buyers borrowed $50.1 million from PGIM Real Estate. The price amounts to $315,455 per unit.\nTroy, New York-based United Group and Palm Beach Gardens-based Sina developed the complex, consisting of a pair of L-shaped buildings, in 2021, records show. It was developed on the 10.7-acre site of the Amara Shrine Center on RCA Boulevard, a fraternal organization.\nEverleigh consists of one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments for tenants 55 and older, according to the community\u2019s website.\nApartments.com shows monthly rents range from $2,764 to $6,910, with Everleigh\u2019s website showing that tenants could get up to two months free for base rent.\nLed by Bob Faith, Greystar is an investment, development and management firm focusing on multifamily, including student and senior housing, and logistics properties, according to its website. It manages about 1.1 million multifamily units, and has roughly $79 billion of assets under management and $36 billion worth of development projects.\nIn January, it sold the 284-unit Elan Polo Gardens apartment complex at 4310 Chukka Lane in unincorporated Palm Beach County to Property Reserve, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u2019 real estate arm, for\n$102.4 million\n. Greystar then bought the 358-unit Avana at the Moors complex at 6200 Northwest 173rd Street in unincorporated Miami-Dade County for\n$93.5 million\n.\nIn May, Greystar picked up a 36-acre industrial development site approved for three warehouses at the corner of Lyons Road and Atlantic Boulevard in Coconut Creek for\n$30.5 million\n.\nArtemis, an investment manager that\u2019s purchased more than $16 billion of real estate, was set to be\nacquired\nby Charlotte, North Carolina-based Barings in the first quarter of this year, according to its website. Financial terms of the deal weren\u2019t disclosed.\nThe Sunshine State has been a magnet for retirees for years, with South Florida senior housing generally enjoying continuing demand. (These communities offer independent, active living, which is different from facilities offering assisted living, memory care and skilled nursing.)\nInvestors and developers have taken note.\nIn January, AEW Capital Management bought the 424-unit senior living Welling Bay complex at\u00a0 2590 Wellington Bay Drive in Wellington for\n$100.1 million\n. Last year, Walton Street Capital bought the 136-unit Alamar Senior Living community at 8785 Lake Worth Road in unincorporated Palm Beach County for\n$23.5 million\n.\nDeveloper Lewis Swezy\u2019s Centennial Management plans an\n80-unit\nage-restricted rental building at 4052 Northwest 22nd Avenue, near Miami-Dade County\u2019s Earlington Heights Metrorail stop.

        "content": "San Antonio Spurs legend and pro basketball hall of famer Tony Parker has cut the asking price of his Central Texas villa as its\nunusual marketing strategy\nfaces the test of a buyer\u2019s market.\nIn a bid to become \u201cthe most-talked about estate in America,\u201d as its listing website claims, the NBA star\u2019s home\nfamously hosted web celebrity Kai Cenat\nfor a month over the summer before going on the public market. Parker\u2019s agent, Houston broker Erwin Nicholas II, conceived of the marketing scheme after Cenat approached him to find a rental mansion for his act to use for a month-long performance event. Nicholas has since applied the same strategy to\nJeff Greene\u2019s Beverly Hills estate\nand its $195 million price tag.\nParker\u2019s home listed publicly in September for $20 million, and the price dropped on Saturday to $19.5 million, according to the Houston Association of Realtors.\nLike Greene\u2019s property,\nwhich was once the most expensive public listing in America\n, Parker\u2019s home has struggled to sell in the past. Kuper Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent Binkan Cinaroglu, one of San Antonio\u2019s top luxury agents, represented the home previously.\nThe challenges continue.\n\u201cWe want to make sure that we represent the opportunity to negotiate,\u201d Nicholas said of the price cut.\nParker launched his gambit during a downturn for Texas sellers, even in the luxury tier. In September,\nseven of the top 10 most expensive homes for sale in the state were relistings\n, representing an increasingly stagnant market compared to earlier months in 2025. In Central Texas, the San Antonio and Austin metro areas\nled the nation in canceled deals and home value loss\n, respectively, at different points in the year. Meanwhile,\nhome supply is rivaling post-recession levels\nthroughout the Texas Triangle.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a buyer\u2019s market right now. There\u2019s a lot of inventory, so something has to happen,\u201d Nicholas said when asked about predictions for 2026.\nLuxury custom properties such as Parker\u2019s \u2014 which features what marketing materials call a water park,\u201d among other amenities \u2014 tend to take longer to sell than more conventional luxury homes at the same price point, according to Icon Global founder Bernard Uechtritz, who specializes in selling ranches. As a result, it\u2019s difficult to assess yet whether Parker\u2019s lengthening number of days on market suggests that it\u2019s going stale.\n\u201cThere really is no one-size-fits-all. That said, if we list a unique property \u2026 we expect to complete a campaign for something unique and unusual in really no more than nine months,\u201d Uechtritz said.\n\u201cIt\u2019d be very hard to write a one-size-fits-all kind of opinion on days on the market. I mean, if something is there for a year or two, that\u2019s tough.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Integra Solutions wants to take on one of Miami-Dade\u2019s\nbiggest public housing overhauls\n, proposing a $385.9 million redevelopment that would quintuple density on a 12-acre Brownsville site while layering in a wide spread of income-restricted units.\nThe Miami-based developer is asking the county for a 99-year ground lease and master development agreement to raze and rebuild the aging Annie Coleman 15 complex with 905 apartments, the South Florida Business Journal\nreported\n. The proposal heads to the county\u2019s Housing Committee next week.\nThe site, at 2200 and 2501 N.W. 57th Street, holds 144 public housing units built in 1965. Integra also has a small adjacent parcel under contract, which it aims to fold into the plan.\nMiami-Dade began shopping the property in 2023 as part of a broader push to modernize its public housing stock. These deals typically blend replacement public housing with deeper affordability and workforce units, but they require federal approval, adding time and complexity.\nIntegra estimates construction at $270.1 million, spread across three phases. The public housing delivered would allow all of the existing tenants to stay in place.\nThe unit mix is broad for a single site: 495 one-bedrooms, 187 two-bedrooms, 158 three-bedrooms and 65 four-bedroom townhomes. Income levels would range from extremely low-income to workforce, including 182 units at 30 percent of area median income, 270 at 60 percent, 272 at 80 percent and 181 at 120 percent.\nIntegra is padding the proposal with perks, including a fitness center, playground, 20 for-sale homes, a youth art center, 3,100 square feet of commercial space, an on-site police workstation, a 5 percent cut of developer fees for the Brownsville Civic Neighborhood Association and 10 percent of net cash flow for a local public art endowment.\nIntegra\u2019s principals \u2014 Victor Ballestas, Paulo Henrique Tavares de Melo, Jacob Conrad Morrow and Nelson Stabile \u2014 are expected to pursue state financing next year through the Florida Housing Finance Corp. The company could not be reached for comment.\nIf the proposal advances, the County Commission would vote in January.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A long-dormant corner of Glenview\u2019s office market is back in a developer\u2019s sight, with a local industrial player testing whether the suburb that has already absorbed one massive workspace-to-warehouse remake is willing to greenlight another.\nFormer Sterling Bay industrial chief Scott Gibbel plans to present his vision Dec. 10 to Glenview\u2019s New Development Commission to replace the mostly empty Caremark Towers with nearly 400,000 square feet of new warehouses, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. His newly launched firm,\nCurtis Ashton Partners\n, wants to level the two aging office buildings at 2211 Sanders Road and build a 29-acre, 395,000-square-foot industrial park dubbed O\u2019Hare Park 294, according to a village filing.\nThe concept mirrors \u2014 and expands on \u2014 a proposal Dermody Properties\nfloated in 2023\nfor a 300,000-square-foot complex on the same site. Dermody, the developer behind the industrial takeover of the 232-acre former Allstate campus just to the south, won commission approval but never secured a rezoning from the village board,\nThe Real Deal\nreported at the time. Rising interest rates killed Dermody\u2019s plan by year\u2019s end.\nGibbel\u2019s goes bigger by tacking on a vacant parcel along Interstate 294 that he aims to buy from Northwestern Memorial Hospital. His team says the project would serve \u201cshallow bay\u201d users \u2014 light manufacturers and R&amp;D tenants \u2014 who have been boxed out as developers chase bulk\nwarehouse demand\n. He hopes to start demolition this spring and deliver all three buildings by summer 2027, building on spec.\nStill, the market around him isn\u2019t exactly roaring. Dermody has struggled to fill portions of its Logistics Campus, envisioned at 3.2 million square feet at full buildout. And while Glenview planners liked the 2023 version of the Caremark plan, a core group of Mission Hills residents didn\u2019t. They\u2019re now reviving their opposition with an online petition ahead of next month\u2019s hearing on the Gibbel proposal.\nCaremark Towers\u2019\nfractured ownership\ndoesn\u2019t simplify matters. DTS Properties bought the taller building at 2211 Sanders Road for $2.3 million in 2022, while the Farbman Group picked up its neighbor at 2215 Sanders for $2.2 million. None of the owners or Gibbel are talking publicly.\nThe proposal reopens familiar fault lines for Glenview residents, as the village has watched residents push back on major redevelopment bids before, from a Core Spaces single-family rental plan to an apartment conversion of the nearby Renaissance hotel.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Align Real Estate\u2019s plan to\nturn three Safeway sites\nacross San Francisco into housing is facing early opposition.\nThe local firm filed plans to develop a 25-story waterfront apartment complex on the site of a grocery store at 15 Marina Boulevard, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. But the project is already facing pushback from Mayor Daniel Lurie and\nridicule\nfrom Marina district residents.\nLurie\u2019s Family Zoning\nplan was approved this week, but Align filed its plans before that, using lenient state height guidelines for the 790-unit proposal. Lurie\u2019s plan allows heights of 140 to 350 feet in districts where it wants to encourage housing density but limits other areas to 65 to 85 feet.\nAlign\u2019s timing caught the attention of the mayor\u2019s office.\n\u201cA developer trying to sneak in a project before our plan takes effect is a complete violation of the spirit of that work,\u201d Charles Lutvak, a spokesperson for Lurie, said. \u201cOur administration will stand up firmly to developers that game the system, and we will pull every lever we can to make this a project that works for this neighborhood and our city.\u201d\nAlign\u2019s plan for the 2.6-acre site includes 86 affordable units. The project would consist of two towers connected by a U-shaped center, rising 250 feet at its highest. It\u2019s a decrease in height from Align\u2019s original plans, which Lurie also opposed.\nThe development would reserve 63,000 square feet for a replacement Safeway, an increase from the existing store\u2019s 40,520 square feet. The development would have 473 residential parking spaces and 164 for the grocery store.\nLurie isn\u2019t the only one who\u2019s opposed to the project; the neighborhood\u2019s supervisor, Stephen Sherrill, also intends to fight it.\n\u201cI won\u2019t let it go unchallenged,\u201d Sherrill told the outlet. \u201cOur neighborhoods deserve stability and real rules \u2014 not to be blindsided by cartoonish mega-projects trying to exploit loopholes in state law.\u201d\nWhile the developer is not currently bound by the city\u2019s height and density limits at the site, the Family Zoning plan will target the Marina location in an attempt to shave down the project.\nAlign\u2019s other proposals call for similar transformation of Safeway sites into mixed-use towers. Those plans, revealed over the past month, include more than\n1,800 units at 1335 Webster Street\nin the Fillmore District, 526 units for the Safeway at 850 La Playa Street in the Outer Richmond and 370 units at the Safeway property at 3350 Mission Street in\nBernal Heights\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Gehry\n, the architect behind some of the most recognizable commercial structures around the world, has died.\nThe architecture giant died at his home in Santa Monica, California at the age of 96, the New York Times\nreported\n. He was battling a brief respiratory illness prior to his death.\nGehry leaves behind a legacy of envisioning lively structures often characterized by undulating, silver accents, including the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, the New World Center concert hall in Miami Beach, the\n8 Spruce Street residential tower\nin New York City and the Fondation Louis Vuitton museum in Paris.\nGehry was born in 1929 and raised in Toronto before moving to Los Angeles with his family in 1947. He studied architecture at the University of Southern California, graduating in 1954, and enlisted in the U.S. Army shortly thereafter. With the help of the G.I. Bill, he went on to study city planning at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design.\nArmed with an education and passion for architecture, Gehry worked as a designer and project manager at Gruen Associates, a firm known for its shopping malls. He opened his own office in 1962 and spent much of his early career working for mainstream developers. Eventually, however, he developed his own style, wanting to buck many of the building trends of the time \u2014 something likely birthed out of being introduced to the work of Modernist pioneer Raphael Soriano during his studies.\n\u201cI was rebelling against everything,\u201d he told the Times in 2012.\nGehry became a household name \u2014 literally \u2014 nearly half a century ago with the construction of a home at 1002 22nd Street in\nSanta Monica\nthat he designed and lived in for four decades. He earned the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1989 and left his mark around the globe with projects that include the Dancing House in Prague; the Biomuseo in Panama City; Maison Hennessy in Cognac, France; the Pierre Boulez Saal concert hall in Berlin; and the Louis Vuitton flagship store in\nSeoul\n. He was also one of the first architects to embrace computer design, and that tech pedigree synced up with Facebook when he designed its West Campus in Menlo Park, California.\nGehry is survived by his wife Berta Aguilera and their two sons, architectural designer Sam and artist Alejandro, as well as his daughter Brina Gehry from his previous marriage and his sister Doreen Gehry Nelson.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "A Toll Brothers project to demolish an office complex in Warner Center and replace it with housing is moving forward.\nThe Los Angeles City Council approved a proposal from Toll Brothers to tear down offices at 6464 Canoga Avenue and build an eight-story building with 276 apartments and 8,600 square feet of ground-floor commercial space, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n.\nToll Brothers\u2019 development is the first project to take advantage of density bonus incentives in the Warner Center Specific Plan area. In exchange for increased density, the developer will be required to designate 21 apartments for very low-income households, or individuals\nmaking\na maximum of $53,000 annually and households of four making $75,750.\nThe offices were formerly the headquarters of animation studio Filmation. It\u2019s been vacant for decades, following the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Seismic retrofitting for the property was determined to be too expensive.\nToll Brothers\u2019 presence in the multifamily market is evolving. In September, Kennedy Wilson\nacquired Toll Brothers\u2019 Apartment Living\narm for $347 million. Kennedy Wilson secured Toll Brothers\u2019 general partner interests in 18 multifamily and student housing assets worth approximately $2.2 billion, as well as a 29-property development pipeline worth approximately $3.6 billion of investment.\nThe Canoga Avenue project isn\u2019t the only multifamily development in the works in Warner Center. In September, Meta Housing Corporation\nsubmitted an application\nto build affordable apartments for senior citizens at 21010 Vanowen Street. That proposal similarly calls for demolishing a one-story office building and accompanying parking lot to make way for a six-story building boasting 395 apartments for low- and moderate-income households.\nEarlier this year, billionaire developer and Los Angeles Rams owner Stan Kroenke\nunveiled plans\nto build a 100-acre team headquarters, residential and retail entertainment hub in Warner Center. That project, dubbed Rams Village at Warner Center, is expected to boost foot traffic and density at the master-planned business district in Canoga Park and Woodland Hills.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

It also received a separate $81 million payment to terminate the existing lease, and transfer taxes for the sale were paid by the buyer, longtime tenant Riot Games.\nHudson Pacific is using part of the $231 million total proceeds from the sale to repay $206 million of commercial mortgage-backed securities debt tied to the property.

        "content": "Evidence of the\nTexas condo boom\nis popping up in Hill Country.\nNew Braunfels is getting its first downtown condo project, a mixed-use development called The Neue, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n. City Council approved $2.2 million in sales tax incentives for the project, which is being developed by Gillum Development and Seal Family Properties.\nDeputy City Manager Jordan Matney told council the project \u201cmost likely not moved forward\u201d without the boost from the city, the outlet reported. The incentives package will provide a $700,000 reimbursement for public improvements and $1.5 million for the developer after the project receives its certificate of occupancy. The city estimates the project will provide a $1.58 million net benefit to the city over a decade.\nThe four-story project will rise at 699 West San Antonio Street, which is currently home to an 18,000-square-foot retail and warehouse building built in the 1950s. The Neue will feature 43 condo units and about 5,000 square feet of ground-level retail and office space.\nNew Braunfels is about 33 miles northeast of San Antonio. It\u2019s known for its German heritage. It draws visitors who like to tube or float along the Comal and Guadalupe rivers. Like other towns in the region between Austin and San Antonio, New Braunfels\u2019 population is growing rapidly. Since 2000, its\npopulation has surged\nfrom 38,000 to more than 100,000 people.\nThe development of The Neue speaks to\nTexas\u2019 burgeoning condo market\n. Unlike cities like New York and Miami, the Lone Star State doesn\u2019t have many condo buildings, as luxury buyers have traditionally favored the ranch.\nDevelopers in the Houston area are testing the waters. Howard Hughes Holdings is developing the\nstate\u2019s first standalone Ritz-Carlton condo building\nin The Woodlands. When construction started on the 111-unit project, 69 percent of the units were pre-sold. Since the Ritz was announced, Sunny Bathija\u2019s Satya shared plans to develop a standalone St. Regis condo tower in Houston\u2019s Rice/Military neighborhood, and Deiso Moss announced it\u2019s building a\nRitz-Carlton condo tower and hotel\nin Uptown/Galleria.\n\u2013 Jess Hardin\n",

        "content": "In New York City, millions of New Yorkers apply to the Housing Preservation and Development for the slim odds of scoring an affordable apartment.\nBut those odds are still better than those for rent-stabilized buildings applying to HPD for financial relief. In November, HPD deferred every application for an Article XI property tax exemption under its Housing Preservation Opportunity program until February, citing project capacity, according to an e-mail exchange shared with\nThe Real Deal\n. The agency said in the email exchange that it received over 75 applications in the fall and will select a limited number of projects in February.\nHPD\u2019s program website states that it has \u201climited staff capacity and a significant backlog of projects. As a result, the assignment of a project manager can take up to one year.\u201d\nAn HPD spokesperson said the agency has not seen a significant increase in applicants over the last few years.\nThe program grants exemptions of up to 40 years on a needs basis for rent-stabilized portfolios with dwindling cash flows. Applicants have to jump through a number of bureaucratic hoops, like forming a housing development fund corporation, and HPD evaluates projects based on factors like their financials, their level of affordability and vacancy and potential repairs.\nBuildings also agree to other conditions, like keeping all units rent-stabilized, limiting rents and incomes and accepting a homeless set-aside filled from vacancies. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious preservation tool, not a light-touch tax break,\u201d said Belkin Burden Goldman\u2019s David Shamshovich.\nApplicants walk a tricky line. Show too robust an operation, and HPD will likely put its money towards the needier; but show a portfolio on the precipice of foreclosure and HPD might resist throwing good money after bad.\nIn the case of the most recent set of applications, none of those considerations appeared to matter, as they were all stymied by what seems like yet another understaffed city organization.\nShamshovich submitted several applications for the fall term, all of which will now be considered next year. One of them related to a 400-unit portfolio with all rents below the 50 percent area median income that is struggling due to its rising debt service.\nHis team submitted a host of paperwork, including a line-item capital budget showing the building\u2019s need for roughly $1.7 million in near-term work to keep the building up to code.\nHe summed up the state of affairs thusly: \u201cIt\u2019s a good deal for the city, and it saves these buildings and preserves them, but if you don\u2019t have bodies to process them, then they\u2019re essentially unhelpful.\u201d\nAnd despite the building meticulously filing all of the paperwork, the decision has been postponed while the building\u2019s finances continue to suffer.\nThe backlog comes during what has been a nightmarish period for rent-stabilized building owners, who have already had many of the levers to manage their balance sheets pulled out from them with the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019.\nWith the soaring costs of insurance, utilities and interest rates alongside a new mayor likely pushing for a rent freeze on rent-stabilized buildings, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see Article XI applications only increase going forward.\nThose owners might as well start checking their Powerball numbers instead.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: After reporting that billionaire Larry Ellison bought two apartments from Shari Redstone at the Pierre,\nThe Real Deal\nlearned that the co-op sale was part of the broader Skydance Media and Paramount merger. Now that we have another massive media merger between Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery, I\u2019m wondering if we\u2019ll see any other house swaps as part of the deal. Know of any homes used as deal sweeteners? Email me at\njacob.indursky@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: I had always assumed that avoiding New York taxes was as easy as spending your 183 days elsewhere (Florida, most likely). But this\nNew York Times article\nshed some light on the extent to which the tax auditors will go to catch town-skippers. Auditors caught one fishing enthusiast who said that he was a New York resident to get a $25 discount on his state fishing license (ultimately, he won his case but paid more in legal fees than he saved on the license).\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 Stricter safety regulations are coming for cranes, Gothamist\nreported\n. City officials said they are going to begin requiring diesel-powered tower cranes to have fire suppression and detection systems after determining the 2023 Midtown crane collapse was caused by a fire started on the crane\u2019s deck. Crane operators will also need to meet higher qualification requirements.\n\u2014 Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani said he will end homeless encampment sweeps, The City\nreported\n. The city spent $6.4 million on the sweeps since 2024; of the 3,500 people who were moved out of encampments, 114 (3 percent) were placed in shelters.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deals recorded Friday were\n1010 East Eighth Street\nin Ocean Parkway and\n1289 Lexington Avenue, 19B\nin Carnegie Hill, both for $8 million. The Ocean Parkway single-family home is 2,600 square feet. The Carnegie Hill condo is 3,500 square feet of new construction.\nBrown Harris Stevens\nJill Bernard has the listing for the condo.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$38.1 million\nfor 26 Bleecker Street. The Manhattan Health Center in NoHo is seven stories and 43,365 square feet. Planned Parenthood sold the building to Izaki Group Investments, per\nproperty records\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $5.8 million for 15 Renwick Street, Unit TH3. The Hudson Square condo triplex is 3,500 square feet.\nSerhant\nhas the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 104,970-square-foot, 14-story, mixed-use development at 54 Sullivan Place in Prospect Lefferts Gardens. Kao-Hwa Lee Architects is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

Experts told the publication that it\u2019s difficult to determine how much newer towers will settle in Sunny Isles Beach.\nAfter buildings are completed, they typically settle into the ground, but unexpected sinking that\u2019s excessive or uneven can create problems over time. Those issues include cracked pipes and facades, and doors, windows and floors that become uneven.\nFor newer towers under construction in Sunny Isles, which include Dezer Development\u2019s Bentley Residences and the two-tower St. Regis Residences, the foundations can extend up to 20 stories below ground \u2014 200 feet. Dezer secured a\n$630 million construction loan\nfor the project from Madison Realty Capital last month. And Bank OZK boosted the construction financing for Fortune International Group and Ch\u00e2teau Group\u2019s St. Regis Residences in Sunny Isles Beach to\n$418.3 million\n.\nNone of the experts the newspaper interviewed suggested any immediate concerns of structural or safety issues. But no one is monitoring how towers settle and shift after they are completed and what effect that is having on neighboring buildings.\nNearly three dozen buildings from Miami Beach to Sunny Isles Beach are sinking at \u201cunexpected\u201d rates,\nresearchers found\nin a University of Miami study published a year ago.\nThe buildings identified included the\nFour Seasons Residences\nat the Surf Club in Surfside, and in Sunny Isles, the Porsche Design Tower and Estates at Acqualina. The study relied on satellite images over the seven-year period that used reference points such as building balconies, air conditioning units and boardwalks to measure the buildings\u2019 shifts, and looked at the skyline from 2016 to 2023.\nSubsidence, or sinking, ranging from two to eight centimeters (less than an inch to about three inches) was found, with the most significant effects in Sunny Isles.\n\u2014 Katherine Kallergis\n",

        "content": "He may not have lived to see his $1 billion-plus vision to\nupgrade the Los Angeles River\ncome to fruition, but architect Frank Gehry was able to shepherd through a transformational plan that is slated to reimagine one of the West Coast\u2019s most underused natural features.\n\u201cHe\u2019s done almost everything you can possibly do as an architect,\u201d Bill Witte, head of Related Companies\u2019 California arm, previously told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cBut if something successful would emerge from this \u2014 and it looks like it might \u2014 it\u2019s an incredible legacy.\u201d\nNot one to rest on his laurels, Gehry was involved in numerous projects at the time of his\ndeath Friday\nin Santa Monica at the age of 96. A Pritzker Prize-winning architect, Gehry personally designed every project completed by his firm, Gehry Partners.\nThough not the building he will be most remembered for \u2014 which is likely the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain \u2014 Gehry put Los Angeles on the global stage with his innovative Walt Disney Concert Hall. Completed in 2003, the Downtown L.A. cultural destination, home to the Los Angeles Philharmonic, is notably punctuated by stainless steel sail-like forms. A tourist destination, tours are offered at the site almost daily.\nGehry is also responsible for a myriad of other projects like The Grand LA, Related California\u2019s two-tower, mixed-used development across from the Disney Concert Hall; and Panama City\u2019s Biomuseo.\nA contemporary icon, Gehry was born and raised in Toronto, Canada. He moved with his family to Los Angeles in 1947, and\nchanged his name\nto Gehry from Goldberg for professional purposes as he faced anti-Semitism.\nThe architect, known for breaking architectural norms and seeing buildings as sculptures, worked for Victor Gruen Associates while finishing his architecture degree at the University of Southern California.\nHe spent a year in the U.S. army in 1955 before studying urban planning at Harvard University\u2019s Graduate School of Design. He worked briefly at Pereira and Luckman Associates and then rejoined Victor Gruen Associates. He moved to Paris with his family in 1961 and worked with Andr\u00e9 Remondet. Gehry opened Frank O Gehry and Associates in Santa Monica in 1962. Gehry Partners, based in Los Angeles, was formed in 2001.\nOne of his most famous early projects was his personal home at 1002 22nd Street in Santa Monica, in which he lived for four decades. The 1978 home incorporated unconventional materials like chain-link fencing, corrugated metal and plywood. The house became known as Gehry\u2019s earliest Deconstructivist building, though he continued making a number of additions.\nCritics saw Gehry\u2019s\nearly, rough-edged work as combative\n\u2014 Mike Davis famously dubbed it \u201cDirty Harry architecture\u201d \u2014 but Gehry viewed it as a pushback against the elitist pursuit of purity that dominated 20th-century design, according to The New York Times. As digital tools emerged, his architecture grew more sculptural. He said\n\u201carchitecture is art.\u201d\n\u201cWhat Gehry was \u2018good at\u2019 was making architecture that both inspired thought and brought pleasure, making buildings that were unusual enough so that some confused them with art pieces and others found them merely bizarre,\u201d architecture critic Paul wrote in \u201cBuilding Art: The Life and Work of Frank Gehry,\u201d\nGehry had been working on an 82,000-square-foot flagship store for Louis Vuitton in Beverly Hills, and the conversion of a 1960s building into an exhibition space and events hall in Paris.\nIn New York City, his first building was for Barry Diller, designing IAC\u2019s headquarters at 555 West 18th Street. Goldberger wrote in his biography of Gehry that Diller was wary that Gehry could keep costs down, but the architect prevailed in convincing him that he could \u201cboth be reasonable and produce a building for reasonable cost.\u201d\nGoldberger wrote that Gehry faced a similar challenge at Forest City Ratner\u2019s 8 Spruce Street, which had to be economical, but also compelling: \u201cIt had to be Frank Gehry, but not\ntoo\nFrank Gehry.\u201d\nThe building, known as Beekman Tower and New York by Gehry, was the tallest residential tower in North America when it opened in 2011. Its height, at 870 feet, was not all that drew the eye: Ten thousand steel panels make up the building\u2019s undulating facade, meant to evoke the sculptural lines of Gian Lorenzo Bernini.\n\u201cWe helped bring to life what was then the most ambitious residential tower ever built in Lower Manhattan \u2014 a building that proved daring architecture and large-scale development could coexist, elevate one another and redefine the skyline,\u201d developer MaryAnne Gilmartin, who was at Forest City Ratner when Gehry designed 8 Spruce Street, said in a statement to\nTRD\n.\nOf course, sometimes cost can interfere with such ethos. Forest City originally hired Gehry as the master planner of the Brooklyn megadevelopment then\nknown as Atlantic Yards\n, but ultimately replaced him in 2009, scrapping his designs for the Barclays Center and a gleaming office tower, dubbed \u201cMiss Brooklyn.\u201d At the time, developer Bruce Ratner\ncited\nan economic downturn, rising construction costs and litigation against the project.\u00a0\u00a0But Gilmartin said Gehry\u2019s work still influenced Brooklyn\u2019s transformation, by reimagining\u00a0 \u201cwhat large, complex urban redevelopment could be: ambitious, integrated and rooted in creating a multi-generational neighborhood.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Ben Ashkenazy just placed a major wager on suburban retail by paying roughly $60\u202fmillion for Orland Park Place southwest of Chicago, cementing its shift in focus from the city\u2019s downtown shopping scene and into the suburbs.\nThe roughly 600,000\u2011square\u2011foot open\u2011air shopping center on 45 acres in Orland Park now belongs to the New York-based investor\u2019s firm Ashkenazy Acquisition, which acquired it from New Orleans-based PMAT Real Estate Investments, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe buyer has spent recent years tangled in turbulence on downtown Chicago\u2019s downtown retail strip only to pivot decisively toward the suburbs. In September, Ashkenazy\u2019s partner\nAurora Capital Associates\nironed out a $98\u202fmillion debt package that was coming due in order to keep control of the 300,000\u2011square\u2011foot retail chunk at 700\u202fNorth Michigan Avenue on the Magnificent Mile. While it\u2019s unclear whether Ashkenazy\u2019s ownership stake was changed by the transaction, the firm\u2019s focus in the Chicago area has been transitioning away from the urban core.\nAshkenazy this year raised a\n$750\u202fmillion war chest for acquisitions\n, largely from his own funds with backing from prior investors, to target retail and hospitality assets \u2014 especially those with overleveraged owners forced to sell at steep discounts.\nThat capital may now be deploying into properties like\nOrland Park\n, where a strong tenant roster and affluent suburban catchment area offer a steadier cash\u2011flow story than distressed downtown retail. Ashkenazy also purchased a retail property on\nChicago\u2019s Far North Side\nnear Evanston in 2023 for $22 million.\nOrland Park Place\u2019s mix of national retailers, discounters and steady foot traffic stands in contrast to the volatility that\u2019s plagued large downtown retail landlords, many of whom have wrestled with tenant departure, loan defaults or writing off underperforming assets.\nFor Ashkenazy, the purchase may signal a recalibrated retail thesis: rather than double down on vertical retail in a troubled downtown \u2014 where the firm already\ndefaulted on a $61\u202fmillion loan\ntied to another Magnificent Mile asset in 2024 \u2014 it is quietly building a suburban platform anchored by stable shopping centers.\nPMAT initially purchased Orland Park Place for $74.6 million in March 2024, based on Cook County property records. Because the recent sale to Ashkenazy, as reported by the seller\u2019s broker Mid-America Real Estate, did not encompass the outlots on LaGrange Road, the final price is estimated to be similar to what PMAT paid for the specific area included in the transaction, the outlet reported.\n\u2014Sam Lounsberry\n",

His William Macklowe Company\nacquired\nthe $46 million distressed loan note on the 129,000-square-foot, 10-story office building at 291 Broadway from Flagstar Bank.\nThe sale occurred after Flagstar sued the owner, Sutton Management, for foreclosure in July because of missed payments.\nThe building could be a candidate for a residential conversion if Macklowe forecloses or takes a deed-in-lieu.\nConversions are always a gamble. So is gambling. Luckily for dice rollers, the endgame for New York\u2019s gaming business is coming into focus.\nThe state Gaming Facility Location Board\nrecommended\ncasino licenses for the three remaining proposals in Queens and the Bronx: Steve Cohen\u2019s Metropolitan Park, Bally\u2019s Golf Links at Ferry Point and Resorts World\u2019s expansion of the Queens Aqueduct.\nThe level of investment for each bid dictates the license term: Metropolitan Park and Resorts World qualify for 20-year licenses, while Bally\u2019s qualifies for a 15-year license.\nThe proposals, which included plans for hotels, entertainment venues and a focus on \u201ceconomic activity and business development,\u201d next go to the Gaming Commission for final license issuance. That\u2019s expected to happen by the end of the month.\nYes, casinos are in a New York state of mind. Nas, famed rapper and Resorts World partner said it best after the recommendations were released: \u201cIt\u2019s a great day in New York City.\u201d\nFinally, the Epstein connection to real estate.\nThe late and disgraced financier privately\nclaimed\nin 2018 to have \u201chelped put them in biz,\u201d and by \u201cthem\u201d he meant Core Club founders Jennie and Dangene Enterprise, an allegation a spokesperson publicly refuted as \u201cbaseless.\u201d\nEmails released by the House Committee \u2014 a 20,000-page trove of documents \u2014 suggest a personal relationship between Epstein and Jennie Enterprise.\nThe invite-only Core Club caters to powerful clientele in real estate and finance, including figures like RFR\u2019s Aby Rosen and Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman.\n\u201c\u200b\u200b[I]n no way, shape, or form did this individual play any business development role in the company, and any suggestion to the contrary is baseless,\u201d said a spokesperson for Core Club.\nEpstein, as it turns out, was also\na reader of The Real Deal\n. While his interest in our publication is by no means a point of pride, released documents revealed emails with links to\nTRD\narticles,\nwhich appears to be a saved or printed web story from June 2019. The emails and articles touched on a Palm Beach development deal.\n",

        "content": "Luxury real estate is entering new territory in Chicagoland, but record-setting prices aren\u2019t necessarily boosting prospects of all sellers as several high-end deals resulted in losses.\nNovember brought about another record-setting home sale for Chicago, along with the movement of some long-sitting downtown condos as the usually sleepy holiday season approached.\nA\n16,000-square-foot mansion\nat 609 Sheridan Road in Winnetka fetched $32.5 million in the most expensive home resale in Illinois history on Nov. 19. The buyers paid $2 million more for personal property in the home, for a total price of $34.5 million.\nThe home was sold by Walton Street Capital co-founder Jeff Quicksilver and his wife, Ashley, who owns the Athene fashion boutique in Winnetka. The Quicksilvers had the French Provincial style home built in 2017.\nThe sale marked another win for @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate agent Jena Radnay, who represented both sides on the deal. Radnay set the previous record just a few months ago with the sale of another\nWinnetka lakefront house for $31.3 million\n.\nRadnay has represented one or both parties on the top six most expensive Cook County home sales this year, leveraging her expertise of the North Shore lakefront to close deals. The demand for luxury lakefront homes in the ritzy northern suburbs has hit a fever pitch in the last year, pushing prices to numbers rarely seen in the Midwest.\nElsewhere,\nLake Geneva\nsaw its strong fall continue into November, with three waterfront houses trading there for more than $6 million.\nYet the luxury condo market in downtown Chicago is still struggling.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the biggest residential deals closed in November and what they show about the market.\nLake Geneva continues rally\nLeading the list of luxury Lake Geneva sales in November was a 7,100-square-foot house at\n831 Bayview Drive\n.\nThe home sold in a quiet, off-market transaction for $8.3 million on Nov. 17. The buyers didn\u2019t come from far: Philip and Melody Lekousis, who bought the house, sold a 3,300-square-foot house on Park Drive for $6 million earlier that month, trading up for the bigger Bayview Drive house.\nCompass agent Daniel Oleston represented the sellers, and Wendy Murphy with Mahler Sotheby\u2019s International Realty represented the buyers.\nThe sale rounded out a busy fall as several lakefront homes hit the market in Lake Geneva, taking advantage of surging demand for luxury property near Chicago. The house was the seventh lakefront home to sell there since October, and the fourth to fetch a price of more than $8 million.\nIn addition to the Lekousis\u2019 Park Drive house, a lakefront property at 8 Hillside Drive in Lake Geneva sold for $7.4 million last month.\nWilliam Farley cuts losses downtown\nAfter two years on the market and a series of price chops, former Fruit of the Loom CEO William Farley and his wife Shelley finally\nunloaded their spacious Gold Coast\npenthouse for $7.5 million, less than half of their original $16 million asking price.\nThe 12,000-square-foot co-op on the 14th floor of 209 East Lake Shore Drive sold for $625 per-square-foot. The sprawling penthouse is a combination of two units Farley bought decades ago. The penthouse had been on the market since 2022.\nCompass agent Jeff Lowe represented the seller, and Katherine Malkin, also of Compass, represented the buyer. They declined to comment on the buyer, and the buyer\u2019s identity hasn\u2019t been determined through public records.\nThe sale comes as downtown Chicago is struggling to find its footing after years of weak demand and falling prices. Sellers like the Farleys have had to cut their asking prices, sometimes by millions of dollars to find buyers.\nBut interest is starting to come back to downtown and condos can find buyers if they\u2019re priced right. Lowe said the unit went under contract fairly quickly once it hit its last $7.9 million asking price.\nThat interest was reinforced in early December when billionaire Citadel founder Ken Griffin\u2019s 67th\u2013floor condo at 800 North Michigan Avenue went under contract with a buyer, with an asking price of $12.5 million. The deal hasn\u2019t closed yet, but if it closes at the asking price it would be the most expensive sale for a single condo in downtown Chicago in at least three years.\nZach Lavine leaves No. 9 Walton\nZach LaVine was another downtown seller to\ntake a loss last month\n. The former Chicago Bulls star sold his lavish condo at 9 West Walton Street for $6.4 million, taking a half-million dollar loss on the sale.\nLaVine, who was traded to the Sacramento Kings in February, bought the 28th-floor condo from former Chicago Bears linebacker Khalil Mack for $6.9 million in 2022. The 4,500-square-foot unit, which features a 750-square-foot wraparound terrace and a custom tub with a built-in champagne bucket, is the latest turnover in a building that has become a hot spot for some of the most high-profile Chicago residents.\nGriffin also took a loss at the building in the last year. He sold off the top four floors of the building last year after making his exit from Chicago for Miami, and two of those units were bought by Gov. J.B. Pritzker.\nFormer Blackhawks star Patrick Kane also sold his 25th-floor condo there for $6.4 million earlier this year.\n",

        "content": "Christmas miracle?\nVictor Coleman\u2019s real estate investment trust, where\nlosses\nare ballooning, made two early December announcements: Jon Bortz became a board member, and the company sold a Los Angeles office campus to tenant Riot Games at a price that permits it to repay the commercial mortgage-backed securities debt connected to the real estate.\nBortz, chairman and chief executive of Pebblebrook Hotel Trust, replaced Jonathan Glaser on the board. Bortz founded the hotel REIT and added LaSalle Hotel Properties to Pebblebrook\u2019s holdings after a spirited bidding war with Blackstone back in pre-pandemic days.\nBortz saw total compensation of $7.4 million last year compared to Coleman\u2019s take of\nabout $25 million\n. He\u2019ll close the gap just a bit with his new gig, getting a $40,000 annual cash retainer, plus $20,000 as an audit and compensation committees member.\nNow for the Olympic Boulevard\ndeal\n\u2026 Hudson Pacific sold a 248,000 square foot, five-building office campus at 12333 West Olympic Boulevard for $150 million and got an extra $81 million payment for the termination of Riot Games\u2019 existing lease. The video-game developer picked up transfer taxes, which came to more than $8 million under the City of L.A.\u2019s Measure ULA rate of 5.5 percent for commercial deals over $10.6 million.\nThe total take, in any case, came to $231 million, giving Hudson Pacific cushion on the $206 million debt it was carrying. The firm increased its funds from operations outlook for the fourth quarter to a range of $0.15 to $0.25 per diluted share compared to $0.01 to $0.05, partly on the news.\nThe deal at $150 million comes out to about $605 per square foot, but with the bonus payment on the lease cancellation it comes out to $931 per square foot. That\u2019s more than Kilroy Realty recently\ndropped\non Maple Plaza, the Beverly Hills office campus that at a $205 million purchase price came out to around $700 per square foot. Even at $605 a square foot, it\u2019s more than the second priciest office deal in all of West Los Angeles during the third quarter per CBRE: Kilroy\u2019s $40 million\nsale\nof a Santa Monica property, which was around $500 per square foot.\nBofA Plaza makes 3 for Brookfield distress\nIn Brookfield land, Colliers is\nshopping\nthe defaulted commercial mortgage-backed securities loan connected to Bank of America Plaza, which the landlord once owned but lost to a receiver. The brokerage anticipates substantially discounted bids to the $400 million debt balance.\nThe 1.4 million square foot, 57-story downtown Los Angeles tower at 333 South Hope Street is worth $212.5 million, or about $150 per square foot, based on recent assessments. That compares with $605 million value a decade ago. The latest distressed debt offering is one of three currently tied to Brookfield in DTLA these days, with the paper on the EY Plaza and the Wells Fargo Center \u2014 North Tower also on the block.\nFamily ties\nRemember the five brothers who emigrated from India, amassed a fortune in diamonds and Los Angeles real estate, then embroiled in a two-decade legal brouhaha that ended in a $10 billion verdict?\nOld habits die hard.\nTwo Jogani brothers, Rajesh and Chetan, are\nsuing\ntheir niece and nephew for $775 million. The two allege the younger relatives were paid hundreds of millions in fraudulent fees, salaries and bonuses by their father, another Jogani brother, Haresh.\nLast year, Haresh was ordered to pay Rajesh and Chetan, and their other brothers, to settle a dispute over their sprawling San Fernando Valley real estate portfolio. Now Rajesh and Chetan claim their brother made payments to his children, their niece and nephew to siphon off and hide assets from the real estate businesses.\nThe juicy complaint throws out accusations of \u201clooted\u201d money, \u201cunfettered control,\u201d \u201cpersonal piggy bank\u201d and \u201cmalicious\u201d conduct. Will it become another decades-long legal brawl?\nNewsom in New York\nCalifornia\u2019s ambitiously charismatic Governor Gavin Newsom \u2014 in a typical blue suit and open-collared crisp white shirt \u2014 appeared to have his next campaign in mind when he appeared at the New York Times\u2019 DealBook Summit. But he barely touched on the most pressing problem of his current job: An intertwining homeless and housing crisis in the Golden State.\nNewsom took a page from President Donald Trump\u2019s handbook, claiming his critics have \u201cCalifornia derangement syndrome.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never tackled our housing crisis more aggressively than we tackled it last year,\u201d he later said.\nAlas, there were no follow-up questions to Newsom on the results of his efforts.\n",

        "content": "For New York City\u2019s new development market, 2025 has been a year of whisper trades and low inventory.\nWhile a handful of buzzy sales launches powered the market, executives, brokers and data analysts spent the year warning of an imminent inventory cliff, as demand for quality projects continued to significantly outpace supply.\n\u201cThe overall story is continuing to just whittle down on the inventory,\u201d said\nMarketproof\nco-founder Kael Goodman. \u201cThe total number of units is growing so slowly.\u201d\nThe market still had its fair share of highs.\nPerhaps the buzziest new development launch kicked off with little fanfare in early spring, when the sales team at Zeckendorf Development and Atlas Capital started\nquietly inking deals\nfor condos at the development.\n\u201cEverything I\u2019ve said this year has been with an asterisk with 80 Clarkson next to it,\u201d said Goodman.\nThough some agents have described the West Village project as \u201cthe big one everyone is interested in,\u201d details about its sales progress have so far remained a tightly-guarded secret.\nThe few specifics that have surfaced have largely been through brokers\u2019 social media posts boasting about bringing buyers to the building, including last month when Bespoke\nposted on Instagram\nabout signing a contract for Unit 24, asking $31 million.\nInstagram also gave us the first hint of deals at the Flatiron Building conversion, another hotly anticipated project in Manhattan. Corcoran\u2019s Steve Gold\nclaimed credit\nfor representing the first buyer to sign a contract at the building in an October post to his account. About a month later, Unit 3North, asking\n$19.4 million\n, landed among the top two most expensive deals inked in Manhattan that week.\nAnother notable pending deal was at Aurora Capital Associates\u2019 140 Jane Street, which found a buyer for its penthouse asking\n$88 million\n. If the unit closes at that price, it would break the record for the priciest condo deal in Downtown Manhattan.\nFor other projects, 2025 was the year of the comeback.\nDeals at 111 West 57th Street had been slow before Sotheby\u2019s International\u2019s Nikki Field Team took over sales last summer. Since then, condos at the Billionaires\u2019 Row supertall, developed by JDS Development and Property Markets Group, have been routinely\namong the two priciest\npending deals noted in weekly contract reports. The tower notched $400 million in sales this year and is 95 percent sold, according to a spokesperson.\nAnother Midtown project has also picked up steam after roughly a decade on the market. In October, 53 West 53rd Street, known as the MoMA tower, nabbed a buyer for Unit 65, last asking\n$47 million\n.\nAcross the East River, two rival new developments in Williamsburg have been vying for neighborhood price records, \u00a0with deals at Two Trees\u2019 One Domino Square and Naftali Group\u2019s Williamsburg Wharf continuously one-upping each other for the priciest condo deals per square foot. Both buildings are now just below 65 percent sold, according to data from Marketproof.\nUnderneath the highlights ran an undercurrent of concerns about the waning inventory pipeline in Manhattan.\n\u201cThe inventory situation is going to continue to get worse, it\u2019s not going to get better,\u201d said Corcoran Sunshine\u2019s Kelly Mack.\nBut the shrinking options aren\u2019t an upside for buildings that have been struggling to offload units, Mack said. Instead, those buyers are turning to the resale market or waiting for a new project to start selling.\n\u201cSeveral amazing new development properties that have recently come to market, or will in the first half of the year, will be beneficiaries of the current market dynamic,\u201d Mack said. The lack of inventory \u201ccreates a sense of urgency to act quickly on those properties.\u201d\nNot so fast\u2026\nRyan Serhant\u2019s \u201cOwning Manhattan\u201d is back on Netflix.\nThe\nsecond season\nof the reality TV series premiered on Friday with eight episodes available on the streaming service. The show features a few new faces, including Peter Zaitzeff, who joined Serhant last January and took over sales at 200 Amsterdam for the brokerage.\nThe Real Deal\n, along other reporters, editors and influencers, got a sneak peek of the new season on Wednesday night at an event hosted by Serhant at Zero Bond. Members of the media, with cocktails and buckets of popcorn, cozied up on couches at the private club to watch the first episode, alongside the cast of the show.\n\u201cNot everyone lives in this season,\u201d Serhant, clad in a pale pink suit, said, calling back to a scene in the first season where he fired his former agent, Jonathan Normolle.\nIn response to a question about his leadership style, Serhant veered into an explanation of how the show came to be, alluding to a bidding war between Netflix and other streaming services.\n\u201cA lot of other people in real estate who have TV shows and don\u2019t anymore lost to us,\u201d Serhant said. \u201cBut that wasn\u2019t your question.\u201d\nCast member Jordan Hurt described the new season as a \u201cdeeper dive into everyone\u2019s personal and professional story.\u201d Jessica Markowski added that she hoped to change her perception this time after she was painted as a villain last season for recording a podcast with Normolle making fun of some of their colleagues.\n\u201cIt was something I wasn\u2019t really proud of,\u201d Markowski said. \u201cSeason two, I really focused on business first and foremost and really proving to Ryan and the company that I can do this.\u201d\n\u201cComing in and getting, you know, beat up a little,\nThe brokerage hosted its official premiere party on Friday at Terminal 5 on West 56th Street.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe priciest deal to land in city records this week was a penthouse at 443 Greenwich Street, which sold for just under\n$40 million\n. Unit PHG once belonged to Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel, who bought the apartment for $20 million in 2017 and sold it five years later for $29 million.\nThe 5,300-square-foot condo has four bedrooms and a 2,650-square-foot wraparound terrace.\u00a0 Corcoran\u2019s Noble Black had the listing.\n",

        "content": "The California-to-Texas pipeline typically involves making money in California and buying a house in Texas.\nTim Leiweke\nput his own spin on the trope: The sports-and-entertainment venue developer made his money in California and got indicted in Texas.\nThe indictment is history because Leiweke is now the latest beneficiary of President Donald Trump\u2019s clemency, adding a line to a resume that includes prior stints as CEO of Oak View Group, and a stretch serving as top executive for billionaire Philip Anschutz\u2019s AEG Worldwide.\nLeiweke is no stranger to attention \u2014 he led AEG as it gathered up ownership of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team, LA Galaxy soccer franchise, a piece of the Lakers, plus the L.A. Live entertainment complex and its\nCrypto.com\narena anchor.\nHis renown turned toward notoriety in Austin, however, where earlier this year he was accused of conspiring with a competitor to rig the bidding process for the $375 million development of the Moody Center, an arena and event venue at the University of Texas at Austin, to benefit Oak View Group. Leiweke promised subcontracting work on the project to the rival company in exchange for dropping its competing bid.\nHe flagrantly flouted the cardinal rule of business in the Internet age: \u201cdon\u2019t put in an email what you wouldn\u2019t want shared on a witness stand in court.\u201d Indeed, he apparently bragged about the scheme in an email, writing, \u201cwe were very clever to put together an agreement that scared everyone else away,\u201d the New York Times\nreported\n.\nTrump\u2019s own Department of Justice charged him with violation of the Sherman Act, the 19th-century antitrust law that prohibits conspiracies to restrain trade. Leiweke was indicted by a federal grand jury in July 2025.\nThe pardon was announced the day after the firm Leiweki founded named a new CEO, Chris Granger. Leiweke stepped down from his leadership position in June. The company was fined $15 million for its involvement in the scheme. It still manages the arena at the center of the crime.\nMehrdad Moayedi defines DFW real estate swagger\nIranian-American developer and founder of Centurion American\nMehrdad Moayedi\nmoved to Fort Worth from Tehran at the age of 15. A half-century later, he\u2019s the most prolific single-family lot developer in North Texas \u2014 at the same time that Dallas-Fort Worth exploded into one of the country\u2019s top five metro regions. The uniquely Texan story of his rise and his singular impact (he developed 75,000 acres of single-family lots) have made him an archetype of the North Texas developer.\nRobert A.M. Stern\u2019s Lone Star State legacy\nRenowned architect Robert A.M. Sterns,\nwho died last month\nat the age of 86, will be primarily remembered for the condos he designed in New York City and South Florida.\nThe founder of Robert A.M. Sterns Architects (RAMSA) also garnered recognition for what\u2019s shaping up to be\na genre-defining project in Texas\n. In addition to New York entries such as the Naftali Group\u2019s Bellemont and 15 Central Park West for Arthur and William Lie Zeckendorf, the list of notable Stern-designed projects will soon include\nHoward Hughes Holdings\u2019 Ritz-Carlton Residences in The Woodlands\n.\nIt\u2019s also a project of which Stern was very proud, said Johnny Cruz, a RAMSA partner working on the Ritz. Cruz, who\u2019s been at the firm for 26 years and said Stern was \u201clike family,\u201d called the project \u201cone of his favorites.\u201d\nTroubled CRE debt surges in Texas\nFor months, the value of Texas CRE loans flagged for each monthly foreclosure sale has hovered around $600 million. In December,\nit shot up to more than $900 million\n, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service.\nOf the $911 million in loans scheduled for auction, $659 million is tied to multifamily properties. Plus, multiple loans flagged earlier this year but were never sold appear headed back to auction block, like\nCharles Cohen\u2019s Houston design center\nat 5120 Woodway Drive, which was originally headed to auction in June and July.\nVultures circle over Jon Venetos\nThe founder of Dallas-based Lurin Capital was\nhit with two new lawsuits\nfrom Keybank claiming he defaulted on $24 million in loans, the latest in a passel of default lawsuits against the value-add multifamily investor. In the filings, Keybank not only accuses Venetos of defaulting and letting the properties fall into disrepair; it also claims Venetos transferred $24,570 from his Keybank accounts to a personal account.\n",

        "content": "Developers aren\u2019t the only answer to the urgent question of how to fast-track rebuilding after a fire, but they\u2019re one part of the solution, said\nNew Pointe Communities\nfounder and President Scot Sandstrom.\nThe San Diego-based developer would know after his firm was part of the community rebuilding following the Witch Creek fires in 2007.\n\u201cIn San Diego, from Witch Creek, there were over 300 homes [burned]. We did 47,\u201d Sandstrom told\nThe Real Deal\nas he stood outside New Pointe\u2019s nearly completed home at 3245 Arrowhead Court in fire-scarred Altadena. The four-bed, four-bath property is one of 15 single-family homes the company plans to redevelop on spec.\n\u201cThere are 4,000 homes here that need to be rebuilt,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need everybody to be a part of it, not just homeowners rebuilding [or] builders rebuilding. I think it takes everybody.\u201d\nSandstrom, company executives and agents were on hand Thursday at Arrowhead Court for a caravan to show the property.\nArrowhead Court is the first and will be completed in January. It\u2019s already listed for just under $1.9 million, or $890 per square foot. Compass\u2019 Jeff Salcido and Mark Marquez are the listing agents.\nThe listing hits close to home for Salcido, whose brother and sister-in-law were the previous homeowners. With a baby on the way, rebuilding didn\u2019t make sense and the couple made the decision to sell to New Pointe.\nPalisades hits milestone\nThe Pacific Palisades is showing its own signpost of progress.\nRick Caruso\nwas on hand Friday to help mark that milestone at\n915 Kagawa Street\n.\nThomas James Homes executives celebrated the completion of the company\u2019s first rebuild as its CEO James Mead told press he thinks the number of TJH projects in the neighborhood could balloon to 100 next year.\nMead led Caruso on a tour of the four-bed, four-and-a-half-bath showcase home, with a gaggle of reporters, photographers, executives and media handlers at their heels as they walked the 6,500-square-foot property.\nCaruso will be back in the area on Saturday when, just a few blocks away from Kagawa Street, his Palisades Village will host its Christmas tree lighting event as he noted the juxtaposition of something seemingly so normal with the surrounding burn scars.\nLori Hyland on the future\nBy Monday, Hilton &amp; Hyland is expected to be fully back up and running after making the move to 345 North Maple Drive in Beverly Hills.\nThe legacy brokerage\u2019s move comes just a few weeks after its former landlord, Standard Oil Investment Group, asked a judge to throw out its lawsuit against Hilton &amp; Hyland for unpaid rent. At the time of the May filing, the brokerage owed more than $650,000 with over $65,000 tacked on in late fees, according to court documents.\nHilton &amp; Hyland Chair\nLori Hyland waved off\nany thoughts the move was the result of a dispute with the landlord, calling their relationship \u201cgood\u201d and the new address \u201chas absolutely nothing to do with our business.\u201d\nOn that last point, market chatter had reached a fever pitch earlier this year as agents continued to leave the firm and speculation mounted that a sale was in the works.\nHyland \u2014 whose husband was the late Jeff Hyland, co-founder of Hilton &amp; Hyland with Rick Hilton \u2014 said the brokerage was never up for sale and she\u2019s not looking to strike a deal in the future either.\n\u201cYou know\u2026 we live in a very, tight community,\u201d Hyland said. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in Beverly Hills all my life. I went to grammar school here. I know it very well. Everybody has something to say and it\u2019s not necessarily true.\u201d\nWhat comes after reality?\nA lot, if you\u2019re Josh Flagg.\nThe Compass agent is running his family\u2019s commercial real estate business, Flagg Family Capital, which has deep roots in Los Angeles commercial real estate and history.\nFlagg seems to be all over the place simultaneously, investing in consumer businesses, such as a Pop\u2019s Bagels; co-founding real estate media firm Estate Media; and, of course, serving clients with his residential real estate business.\nIf you missed the story in\nTRD\n\u2019s December issue,\nclick here\nfor a look at Flagg beyond the small screen.\n",

        "content": "When is the passage of a historic, citywide rezoning law that creates room for more than 36,000 new homes in a single city not enough? When that city is San Francisco, cradle of the YIMBY movement, where the state has mandated the city permit more than 82,000 new homes by 2031.\nThe San Francisco Board of Supervisors\u2019 Tuesday passage of the rezoning rules was a major political victory for freshman Mayor Daniel Lurie. The so-called Family Zoning Plan, approved in a 7-4 vote, upzoned about 60% of the city, including neighborhoods that haven\u2019t added new housing in decades, such as the Richmond, Sunset and Marina districts.\nIn a recent conversation with The Real Deal, a major housing California developer characterized the plan as a \u201cfantastic long-term win,\u201d but expressed skepticism about the short-term impact on housing development. Among the challenges in the near term: Interest rates on development financing and the material and labor costs of construction as the real pain points in building housing in San Francisco. The developer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, doesn\u2019t expect costs to come down but foresees interest rates falling over the next year.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think much housing gets added in 2026 or 2027,\u201d the developer said, adding that \u201cthe city is doing everything it possibly can,\u201d on the legislative side to spur housing development.\nMajor pro-housing groups in the state disagree. According to a report from the San Francisco Business Times, three such organizations have threatened to sue the city for not going far enough with the Family Zoning Plan. YIMBY Law, the California Housing Defense Fund and Californians for Home Ownership, are each mulling legal action over what they see as a violation of state law.\nThe groups point to an October report by the San Francisco Controller\u2019s Office, which projected that the Family Zoning Plan would only produce 15,000 new homes over the next two decades \u2014\nwell short of the plan\u2019s promised capacity\n, and a fraction of the state\u2019s mandate for the city to permit 82,000 new homes by 2031. San Francisco planning officials told the Business Times that the state had endorsed early versions of the Family Zoning Plan.\nHowever, if the groups do file a lawsuit and are successful in court, the city, without an approved zoning plan, could end up out of compliance with state housing rules. The state may then implement builder\u2019s remedy, which allows developers increased latitude to propose projects without any consideration of local zoning law, provided projects designate a minimum of 10 percent of units for affordable rates, with the requirement ranging upward on a case-by-case basis.\nThen there are some who believe the city-wide rezoning goes too far, including District 1 Supervisor Connie Chan, one of four supervisors to vote against the changes. Chan\u2019s dissent sets the stage for the kind of debates San Franciscans will hear during the 2026 campaigns for Rep. Nancy Pelosi\u2019s congressional seat. Chan, a progressive second-term supervisor who declared for the race late last month, is likely to operate as a sort of foil to\nstate Sen. Scott Wiener\u2019s pro-housing development reputation\n. Wiener has already criticized Chan as \u201cunsuccessful at getting anything done\u201d since she joined the board of supervisors in 2021.\nWhile city hall was debating land use changes to spur new housing, two high-profile projects returned to the headlines with new life.\nThe troubled residential development at 360 Fifth Street is now poised to be taller and with more units after Novato-based\nThompson Builders recently submitted new building permit\ns that would take the project from 20 to 21 stories, with an additional 14 units, bringing the total to 272. The property faced a public nuisance lawsuit last year when San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu accused the former developer, Leap Development, of abandoning the partially excavated site. Thompson Builders, who was contracted by Leap to build the project, bought the site for $1.3 million earlier this year.\nDeveloper Crescent Heights is\nreportedly restarting talks for its $1 billion, 67-story residential tower\nin downtown San Francisco. The San Francisco Business Times reported that the Miami-based developer has begun early-stage talks around making the 1,000-unit project a reality. According to the Business Times, Crescent Heights aims to break ground in 2027 on what would be San Francisco\u2019s first high-rise residential tower in years.\n",

        "content": "Rising home prices aren\u2019t going anywhere in Chicago.\nThat\u2019s according to a recent forecast from Realtor.com, which predicts the market\u2019s prices will rise 4.4 percent year-over-year in 2026, about twice as much as the national average.\nThe expected increase is largely due to a lack of new inventory in the metro, said Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at Depaul University.\nChicago is behind most cities\nwhen it comes to home construction, ranking near the bottom among large metros in 2024.\n\u201cOther parts of the country that have exceeded pre-pandemic inventory levels are also areas where you see more new housing and construction,\u201d Smith said. \u201cChicago and Illinois tend to lag in producing new housing.\u201d\nThe bad news for brokers, however, is that despite\nhome prices going up\n, the report predicts sales volume will decrease by 2.3 percent, reflecting the tight competition and low supply in the market.\nSmith said his institute conducted a similar study for Illinois Realtors, which projected home prices in the metro will grow by 5 percent between October 2025 and October 2026.\nThis comes as\nChicago defies\nmuch of the nation over the last year in price growth while other regions, particularly in the South and West, have seen home values tumble.\nNationally, home prices are expected to grow by 2.2% and sales volume by 1.7%, the national report said. Chicago ranked among the top third of U.S. metros for projected price growth.\nThe Realtor.com report expects mortgage rates to drop slightly to 6.3 percent, down from an average of 6.6 percent this year. Those rates will likely unlock some new inventory as people move out of homes with low-interest mortgages, Smith said, but with strained inventory, new listings could see bidding wars and even higher prices.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a great short-term fix, other than just steadily reducing interest rates to unlock that inventory while also increasing demand,\u201d he said.\nEven if interest rates don\u2019t fall considerably next year, buyers have largely gotten used to the reality that rates above 6 percent are business as usual. Grigory Pekarsky, managing broker at Vesta Preferred Realty, said he hasn\u2019t worked with buyers who have expressed concern about mortgage rates in the last six months.\n\u201cThat just means a complete consumer absorption of normalization of these rates,\u201d Pekarsky said. \u201cSo that\u2019s not even a calculation in my opinion anymore.\u201d\nAs home prices are likely to rise across the metro, downtown Chicago may see a turnaround after years of falling prices and low demand, Pekarsky said. Pekarsky expects downtown prices to be buoyed in 2026 as buyers, especially first-timers, see it as an affordable and attractive option.\n\u201cI feel like next year the Gold Coast, River North, Loop market, is going to finally have its day,\u201d he said. \u201cThese areas are the last ones that just haven\u2019t recovered properly since COVID depression in pricing.\u201d\nMeanwhile, prices aren\u2019t likely to slow down in the hottest neighborhoods and suburbs that have seen major price growth in recent years. Jena Radnay, an @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate agent who has brokered many of the most expensive deals this year\nalong Winnetka\u2019s shoreline\n, said the North Shore suburbs are set for more growth in 2026.\nShe noted that the Mediterranean restaurant Avec is opening a location in Highwood. The introduction of the high end restaurant to the North Shore is a good sign for the continued rise of the area, Radnay said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be seeing a much more hip, savvy North Shore than we\u2019ve ever seen before,\u201d she said. \u201cI think things are going to start growing up here.\u201d\nWhile the high-end areas will see growth, Smith said the same is true over the past few years in Chicago\u2019s lower cost neighborhoods, as buyers seek affordability in an increasingly competitive market.\n\u201cPrice growth is strongest in a lot of lower cost or more affordable places,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hard to disentangle who\u2019s buying it. Is it investors who are seeking relatively low value, or is it owner-occupants that are really looking for more affordable homebuying options, or is it a bit of both?\u201d",

The ground-up development had an odd cast of partners and was spearheaded by Gary Segal and Brad Zackson, a protege of Fred Trump and a past business associate of Paul Manafort.\nBloomberg\nfirst reported on Dynamic Star\u2019s bankruptcy filing.\nIn recent months, Dynamic Star\u2019s lender initiated\nforeclosures\non the two parts of Fordham Landing. A mysterious lender with ties to Brooklyn-based CREMAC Asset Management alleged Dynamic Star had fallen behind on a $55 million loan and a $18.9 million loan, according to a notice for the foreclosure auction.\nDynamic Star could lose equity interests in both phases of the development if the foreclosure goes through.\nIn Fordham Landing\u2019s north phase of the project, the developers planned to build 2.7 million square feet of new development with 1.8 million market and affordable housing, 744,000 square feet of office, and 143,000 square feet of retail. In the south phase, they planned to build over 900 units of affordable housing.\nDynamic Star\u2019s larger north phase has a longer-term projection and Zackson said the development team has spent the past few years obtaining zoning approvals. In a bankruptcy filing, Zackson said once the zoning is approved, the developers are confident they will be able to bring in a new investor group to complete the project.\nMeanwhile, the 900 units of affordable housing in the south phase were expected to be delivered by next year, according to Zackson. The developers had recently secured over $55 million from the state to assist with site infrastructure.\nZackson said in a bankruptcy filing that the changes and modifications in the project limited the debtor\u2019s financing options.\nBut in another lawsuit, Dynamic Star\u2019s co-founder Segal blamed one of Fordham Landing\u2019s partners for some of its issues. Segal alleges Great Neck-based developer Igal Namdar was the actual buyer of its loans and attempted to foreclose to take control of the project.\nIn the bankruptcy filing, Zackson alleges Namdar may be the owner of the mezzanine loans. He further alleged Namdar failed to show up for an emergency meeting to discuss the bankruptcy.\nNamdar did not return a request to comment. Dynamic Star\u2019s bankruptcy attorney, Kevin Nash, also did not return a request to comment.\n",

        "content": "Waste is a terrible thing to mind. Just ask Dominick Romeo.\nOther than a few building superintendents and extremely close followers of city politics, nobody noticed that the West 18th street resident ran against City Council member Erik Bottcher this fall. Romeo was crushed.\nThe superintendent is best known for organizing opposition to the Adams administration\u2019s trash pickup rules, which he said were taking him and fellow supers away from their families in the evening.\nThis platform proved woefully insufficient for Romeo to win on the \u201c\nBlue Collar/Fight and Deliver\n\u201d ballot line in a heavily Democratic Manhattan district. He got a mere\n9 percent\nof the vote.\nBut we\u2019re going to highlight Romeo\u2019s main issue anyway because it matters to thousands of property managers \u2014 and costs some of them money.\nTo reduce rats\u2019 opportunity to feed, the Adams administration required that garbage be set out at 6 p.m. (if in bins) or 8 p.m. (if in bags) instead of 4 p.m. As a result, some buildings \u2014 even affordable housing developments struggling financially because of\nfalling rents\nand\nnonpaying tenants\n\u2014 are\npaying overtime\nto staffers who take out the trash.\nThe Department of Sanitation says paying overtime because of the\nnew rule\nis a choice, not an obligation.\n\u201cEven if a building chooses to set out [trash] after 8 p.m., it is a logical fallacy to say that \u2018forces\u2019 overtime,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cA building can simply set any work schedule that may fit its needs.\u201d\nThe agency offered a 4 a.m. to 7 a.m. set-out time for superintendents who work earlier shifts and designed routes to quickly collect the trash from the 2,500 buildings that opted in.\n\u201cWe have been extremely flexible to make this work for property owners and managers,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nMayor Eric Adams deserves credit for going after rats, and it makes sense to require rat-resistant bins for garbage, even though\nfood waste\nis supposed to go into thicker brown bins.\nBut if bins are mandatory, why also require later set-out times? How many rats are going to venture out from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. to gnaw through hard plastic bins?\nDSNY\u2019s response was that this is not just about rats. New Yorkers, according to the agency, shouldn\u2019t have to share the sidewalk with trash during the afternoon rush.\nAt this point, I am obligated to point out that Sanitation is not obliged to promptly collect the trash. If you call 311 on collection day to report that your garbage was not picked up, the agent will not take your complaint. Instead, you will be told to call back the next day if the trash is still there.\nThis is because DSNY is not officially late until 24 hours have passed. Enterprising rodents still have a chance. Dominick Romeo, not so much.\n",

Total projected sellout of the top 10 also declined 34 percent year over year, from $1.4 billion to $918 million.\nIn Brooklyn, the listing inventory for new development condos in the third quarter declined year over year by nearly 25 percent, according to a report from Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel.\nIn Queens, the number of closed sales on new development condos declined by 55 percent in the same period.\nNew Empire Corp\u2019s 757 Flatbush Avenue took home the top spot on this year\u2019s list. The finish was a sign of the times: the project\u2019s $136 million projected sellout would have come in fifth in 2024.\nThe neighborhoods home to the biggest condo filings also shifted. Last year\u2019s list was dominated by the trendy neighborhoods of Williamsburg, Boerum Hill and Long Island City, while the biggest developments in 2025 were situated further away from Manhattan, including projects in Flatbush, Arverne, and Windsor Terrace.\n757 Flatbush Avenue, Flatbush | New Empire Corp. | $136 million\nNew Empire nabbed the most valuable filing in the two boroughs with its 757 Flatbush project. At 132 units, the developer expects the eight-story project to pull in $136.4 million at final sellout. The project will be anchored by a retail and commercial space.\nThe project broke ground this summer and nabbed a $9.2 million refinancing from Pacific National Financing this fall.\n127 Kent Avenue, Williamsburg | Joyland Group and Prospect Developers II | $144 million\nJoyland Group and Prospect Developers took the No. 2 spot with \u201cThe Sixth,\u201d their 43-unit development in Williamsburg near the waterfront.\u00a0 The six-floor project features two penthouse floors.\nUnits have not been listed but Corcoran is advertising the project. Joyland paid $43.3 million for the development site at the end of 2024, PincusCo reported.\n141 Beach 67th Street, Arverne | Beechwood Homes | $110 million\nThe waterfront development at 141 Beach 67th Street is expected to yield $110 million. The project, called Lighthouse, is one block from the ocean, on the Rockaways peninsula. The units start in the mid-$500,000s, according to the project website.\n23 Ocean Parkway, Windsor Terrace | Aview Equities | $109 million\nAview Equities is planning a 99-unit development where Windsor Terrace meets Kensington, at Prospect Park\u2019s southern edge. The project expects to sell out at $109 million.\nThe development, which has an alternate address of 57 Caton Place, made headlines this summer for allegedly\ndisturbing horses\nat the Prospect Park stables. In 2023, Parkview Financial filed a\npre-foreclosure suit\nrelated to a $66 million construction loan it originated for the project. The suit was discontinued last year.\n110 Boerum Place, Cobble Hill | Avdoo Partners | $100 million\nAvdoo Partners expects $100 million from its development on Boerum Place, which will deliver 21 residential units. Valley National Bank provided a $47 million construction loan this summer. Initial prices will start at about $3 million for a two-bedroom, according to City Realty.\n600 &amp; 610 DeKalb Avenue, Bedford-Stuyvesant | Allure Group, Joel Landau | $99 million\nThe development at 600 DeKalb Avenue will deliver 70 condos alongside 320 rental units, according to New York YIMBY. Allure Group secured $155 million in construction financing for the project, on the western side of Bedford-Stuyvesant, which is expected to bring in $99 million in sales.\n2102 East 1st Street, Gravesend | Redhoek + Partners | $76 million\nThis Gravesend project from Redhoek + Partners is slated for just 12 units, but a $76 million sellout. Eight of the units in the ground-up development, called the Onyx Residences, will be duplexes with double-height spaces, according to the project website.\n70-40 45th Avenue, Elmhurst | Ching Lam and Jia Xin Chen | $63 million\nThe condo building at 70-40 45th Avenue is expected to deliver 93 residential units, for a total sellout of $63 million.

PRO Links Realty has taken over marketing and sales for the project, called 146 Northern. Prices start at $528,000 for a one-bedroom, according to the project site.

        "content": "Entry-level homeowners in Sugar Land, a suburb in America\u2019s amplest housing market, will be able to cover more renovation costs with city funding in 2026.\nSugar Land, a city about 19 miles southwest of Houston, announced Wednesday that it will expand its Great Homes Update Program, which reimburses homeowners for certain property enhancements. Since 2023, the program has covered 10 to 25 percent of project costs with a maximum payment of $10,000. Starting January, reimbursements of 50 percent will be available to homeowners whose properties are in the bottom 3 percent of single-family home values, amounting to about a thousand homes in Sugar Land, according to Ana Rodriguez, Sugar Land community development coordinator.\nThe city is also expanding eligibility to include heir owners. The Great Homes Program formerly required traditional proof of ownership, such as a recorded deed, but many heir-occupied homes have not gone through a formal title process.\nOnly eight homes in this category have used the program over the last three years. The city hopes the expansion will bring in 25 additional participants in 2026.\n\u201cMany of the households in the bottom 3 percent faced barriers that made it difficult to meet the program\u2019s original requirements. Some did not carry homeowner\u2019s insurance, or had fully paid-off homes, which meant they lacked the documentation required to qualify,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cOthers could not meet the $4,000 minimum project cost, making the program financially out of reach.\u201d\nThe program is available to landlords as well as owners who occupy their properties, Rodriguez said.\n\u201cThere are quite a few neighborhoods that we saw fall into this 3 percent bracket: Mayfield Park, Covington Woods, Farrington Place, Chimneystone and Ragus Lake,\u201d Rodriguez said.\nSo far, Sugar Land has reimbursed $791,000 for projects totaling $5.3 million in costs through the program. The city has budgeted $200,000 for the program for fiscal year 2026.\nThe Houston metro area has\nmore homes for sale than any other metro in the country\n. It\u2019s also the only metro in the Texas Triangle where inventory has grown apace in the past few months; sellers have been\nleaving the market\nin Dallas, Austin and San Antonio. The distinction is probably due to a swift pipeline of\nmaster-planned communities\nin the Houston area, where over 20 percent of all master-planned community sales in the country take place.\nNearby master-planned community projects include a\n7,000-home development east of Fulshear\n. Hines received $129.2 million in Texas Infrastructure Program bonds for the project, secured by Fort Bend County MUD reimbursements.\n",

Kennedy, James Nelson, Erik Edeen and Sullivan Johnston are leading the effort.\nThe property was built in 1958 and renovated in 2014. Its zoning would allow for redevelopment as multifamily, hospitality and office.

It was previously owned by\ntroubled syndicator Kenny Wolfe\n, who founded Dallas-based Wolfe Investments.\nWolfe announced his purchase of the tower, whose capital stack included the $13 million loan from Thistle Creek and $9 million in equity, less than a year earlier. He had planned to convert it from offices to 238 apartment units. Around the same time, he partnered with Dallas-based developer Bluelofts and purchased the historic Oil &amp; Gas Building in downtown Fort Worth with similar conversion plans. He lost that building to foreclosure, too.\nWolfe\u2019s downfall was defined by his attempt to stick the landing on an ambitious pivot from collecting a portfolio of dollar stores and older apartment complexes to executing the notoriously challenging office-to-resi conversion in downtown Dallas, Fort Worth and Cleveland.\nDespite the building\u2019s complicated recent past, conversion experts agree it has potential.\nA 2023 paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in coordination with New York University and Columbia University identified the midcentury-modern tower as one of 50 North Texas buildings structurally ripe for conversion.\nNew York University professor and report author Arpit Gupta said 211 North Ervay \u201cmet all the criteria\u201d for a conversion candidate, including location, age and the distance between the building\u2019s core and its windows.",

        "content": "The owners of Goat Hospitality Group secured a buyer during\nMiami Art Week\nfor their Pinecrest estate, which is on the market for $18 million.\nThe pending deal marks the most expensive of 14 contracts signed in Miami-Dade County between Dec. 1 and Dec. 7, according to the latest Eklund-Gomes report. It tracks listings of homes and condos asking $4 million and up in Miami-Dade that are included in the Multiple Listing Service. The properties spent 173 days on the market, on average.\nSixty-one luxury listings were added to the market, for a total of 1,323 listings.\nThe\nprevious week\n, buyers signed 11 contracts for properties in Miami-Dade, asking a combined $86.2 million.\nThe asking dollar volume for the 11 single-family homes and three condos under contract last week totals $100.6 million, according to the report published by the Douglas Elliman team led by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes.\nThe single-family homes that entered into contract last week have an average asking price of $7.4 million and spent an average of 169 days on the market. They total $81.6 million in asking dollar volume.\nEklund and Elliman\u2019s Jennifer Goldstein have the listing for the top contract, the pending sale of the 12,000-square-foot, 10-bedroom and nine-and-a-half-bathroom mansion at 10061 Southwest 60th Court. Records show Derek and Lisa Gonzalez of\nGoat Hospitality\npaid $5.7 million\nfor the 0.9-acre property in 2022. They had a new home built on the property with a Balinese-style pool, outdoor shower, sauna and a primary suite, according to the listing.\nThe condos that secured buyers last week have an average asking price of $6.3 million and spent 183 days on the market, on average. They total $19 million in asking dollar volume, or an average of $2,154 per square foot.\nA unit at the\nEstates at Acqualina\nin Sunny Isles Beach marked the priciest condo to enter into contract last week. Unit 1903 at 17901 Collins Avenue, with four bedrooms and five bathrooms, is on the market with Ryan Mendell of Maxwell E Realty Inc. Property records show David Schwartz of Lexington, Massachusetts, paid $5.4 million for the unit in 2022. It\u2019s under 3,300 square feet.\nLast week in New York, buyers signed contracts for 29 homes, according to the latest\nOlshan\nreport.

        "content": "Mountain View is now the priciest city in Silicon Valley for renters.\nRents in the Peninsula city have climbed past pre-pandemic highs, with some new luxury one-bedrooms fetching approximately $5.75 per square foot, up from a previous peak of $5.50 per square foot, per CBRE data\ncited\nby the San Francisco Business Times. At that amount, the typical new one-bedrooms at the national average of about 735 square feet would lease for approximately $4,200 per month.\nThe new high for Mountain View comes as artificial intelligence companies flock to the Bay Area in droves, attracting thousands of workers and executives in need of housing. AI giant OpenAI is\nreportedly on the market\nfor up to 500,000 square feet of offices in Silicon Valley, with Mountain View emerging as a top choice, according to real estate sources\ncited\nby the Business Times. As AI hiring picks up, so too does housing demand; AI job postings in Santa Clara County, for example, have jumped to 8 percent from 3 percent over the past three years.\nIn San Francisco,\napartment rents have increased\nan average of 6 percent over the past year \u2014 more than double the 2.5 percent jump in New York City, per CoStar data\ncited\nby the New York Times. By contrast,\nrent growth nationwide\nhas fallen to 0.5 percent year-over-year, while vacancy has increased to 4.4 percent and net absorption dropped to its lowest third-quarter levels since 2022, per CBRE data.\nLast month, the Mountain View City Council rejected a\nproposal from Greystar Real Estate Partners\nthat would increase housing supply in the city. The South Carolina-based firm has long planned to turn a J.P. Morgan Chase branch at 749 West El Camino Real into a 299-unit mixed-use development. Greystar requested to increase its construction timeline from two years to eight, but the city denied that request.\nUnder its state-mandated housing goals, the City of Mountain View must plan for 11,135 new housing units by 2031.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "In March, the city\nput out the request\nfor a developer to take on a conversion at 100 Gold Street. GFP Real Estate answered the call.\nThe New York City Economic Development Corporation selected GFP to redevelop the 10-story office building in the Financial District, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. GFP will revamp the 1960s-built government building with a mixed-income residential building with thousands of units.\nSpecifically, there are 3,700 units planned for the site, a drastic increase from the 2,000 units Mayor Eric Adams sought when revealing plans for the property back in January; Adams\nannounced plans\nfor the property in his State of the City address as part of a broader \u201cManhattan Plan,\u201d an initiative he said would bring 100,000 new homes to the borough over the next decade.\nAt least 25 percent of the units will need to be designated affordable. Other aspects of the redevelopment include 40,000 square feet of open space for the public and a fitness center.\nDetails of the acquisition costs for GFP were not disclosed, but funds from purchasing the city-owned site will go towards finding office space for relocating city tenants, including the New York City Department of Housing Preservation &amp; Development, the Housing Choice Voucher program and GrowNYC.\nThe Hamilton-Madison House, a social services nonprofit provider, will receive a purpose-built facility on the site and relocate nearby during the construction period.\nIn a statement, GFP co-chief executive officer Brian Steinwurtzel said the firm was \u201chonored to have been selected\u201d for the project. He also talked about a \u201ccollaborative process with the community,\u201d which will be put to the test with land use reviews in 2027.\nThe project builds on Adams\u2019 executive order calling on city agencies to identify city-owned or controlled property suitable for housing development.\nGFP is fresh off another FiDi conversion, turning a former 1.1-million-square-foot office property at 25 Water Street into one of the largest office-to-resi conversions in U.S. history. GFP, Metro Loft and Rockwood Capital recently secured\nan $835 million refinancing package\nfrom Apollo and GIC for the 1,320-unit project, which began leasing in late January.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Nick Kokonas, co-owner of Chicago\u2019s Alinea restaurant and founder of the Tock reservation platform, sold his distinctive Old Town property at a significantly discounted price of $4.65 million.\nThe restaurateur and his wife, Dagmara Kokonas, closed the deal for their home at 223 West Eugenie Street at nearly $2 million below the original asking price of $6.84 million set in October 2023, according to\nCrain\u2019s Chicago Business\n. The property consists of two 19th-century houses joined by a modern glass bridge, along with two rear buildings, one dating back to the aftermath of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.\nInitially, Kokonas attempted to\nsell the home\nusing his self-devised \u201cinverted commission\u201d model, which ties the buyer\u2019s agent commission to the accepted offer price, with a higher percentage commission tied to a higher sale price. The property sat on the market for months with no asking price and no listing agent. He had successfully used this method in previous sales in Winnetka, Kenilworth and Northbrook.\nHowever, after five months without a sale, Kokonas turned to\nCompass\nagent Jeff Lowe, who eventually reduced the listing price twice, bringing it down to just under $5.9 million by September 2024.\nThe final sale represents a roughly 32 percent discount from the original asking price.\nWhether the Kokonases profited on the property is uncertain. They purchased it for $3.66 million in 2009 and invested heavily in renovations, including a restaurant-style kitchen and updates to the historic outbuildings. If renovation costs exceeded $1 million, the couple may have taken a loss.\nNeither Kokonas nor Lowe commented on the sale, and the buyer remains unidentified in public records. From the street, the property appears as two modest wood frame houses typical of Old Town, but inside it blends historic architecture with modern design, including interiors inspired by Edgar Miller\u2019s neighborhood work in the 1920s and 1930s.\nThe sale comes during Kokonas\u2019 broader career transition. In September 2024, he sold his ownership stake in the Alinea Group, retaining only a passive minority interest in Alinea itself. His partnership with chef Grant Achatz had spanned 19 years, during which Alinea became Chicago\u2019s sole three-Michelin-starred restaurant. Recently, Michelin downgraded Alinea to two stars.\nThe Alinea Group continues to operate seven other venues, including Next and the Aviary.\nBeyond restaurants, Kokonas co-founded Tock in 2014 with Google engineer Brian Fitzpatrick. Initially focused on restaurant reservations, the platform expanded to wineries and hospitality bookings. Squarespace acquired Tock for $400 million in 2021, and Kokonas remained with the company until early 2023.\nThe Eugenie Street sale marks the 147th\nChicago home sale\nabove $4 million in 2025, surpassing the previous record of 136 set in 2022. The surge highlights the strength of the city\u2019s\nluxury housing market\n, even as the broader market remains relatively flat.\n\u2013 Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "Sharon Baum, a veteran Manhattan luxury broker, has died at the age of 85.\nThe powerhouse broker spent more than 30 years as one of the most successful agents in New York City, building on nearly two decades as a female trailblazer in corporate leadership before moving into brokering luxury deals.\nCorcoran CEO Pam Liebman announced Baum\u2019s death in an internal memo to the brokerage where\nBaum began her career in 1991\n, lauding her as a character of style and substance. Baum was with the firm for more than three decades before joining Douglas Elliman last year.\n\u201cSharon was a pioneer in every sense of the word: sharp, stylish and always several steps ahead,\u201d wrote Liebman.\nTo accompany her deals for premier properties, she sported a diamond pin on her lapel and a forest green Rolls-Royce bearing the license plate, \u201cSOLD 1,\u201d that she temporarily retired following the Great Financial Crisis for something more understated.\n\u201cShe\u2019s so focused on knowledge and intelligence rather than pizzazz,\u201d Leonard Steinberg told\nthe Daily News in 2015\n. \u201cShe has substance.\u201d\nJonathan Conlon, Baum\u2019s longtime associate at Corcoran with whom, along with John Gasdaska, she decamped for Douglas Elliman last year, said part of Baum\u2019s legacy is reinventing the profession that had long been treated as a pastime.\n\u201cShe was one of the first true professionals who moved into the world of New York City real estate and formalized it and treated it like a business,\u201d he said. \u201cShe really helped get the New York City real estate market and business to start seeing itself that way and not as this sort of social pastime.\u201d\nBorn in 1940 in Jefferson City, Missouri, Baum attended Randolph-Macon Woman\u2019s College and was\none of eight women in the first co-ed graduating class\nof Harvard Business School in 1965.\nShe later joined Chemical Bank, where she spent 17 years and became the company\u2019s first female vice president. She was the subject of a 1975 Wall Street Journal article\non the rise of \u201cdual-career couples,\u201d\nas she and her husband Stephen worked full-time jobs. \u201cEvery single minute is taken up,\u201d she told the Wall Street Journal in 1975. \u201cI never have time to watch TV or read a book.\u201d\nBaum made the jump to real estate in 1991, when she joined Corcoran. She quickly rose as the firm\u2019s top-selling agent, which she credited to the vast network she had built working in business for nearly two decades.\n\u201cWhat I did was a big mailing with very nice engraved cards that I sent to my master list, saying I was no longer at Chemical Bank, and I am going into a whole new field \u2014 and word got around,\u201d Baum previously told\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\u201cShe single-handedly walked the high-end market into my business,\u201d Corcoran co-founder Barbara Corcoran, who recruited Baum to her firm before selling it in 2001, told the Daily News. \u201cShe was that powerful. She\u2019s one of the most well-connected, well-wired brokers in Manhattan. I adore her.\u201d\nIn 1996, she was already doing over $50 million a year in sales, focusing on pre-war co-ops and townhouses. She scored one of her biggest deals in 2006, when she sold the $40 million Duke-Semans mansion on Fifth Avenue. The only agent to receive the Real Estate Board of New York\u2019s Deal of the Year award twice, Baum was also awarded REBNY\u2019s Henry Forster award for lifetime achievement in 2011. As of 2024, she claimed over $2 billion in sales over the course of her career.\nKnown as the Queen of Park and Fifth avenues, Baum evolved her business with the times as money started flowing downtown, turning her relationship with Gasdaska and Conlon into a strategic partnership in 2016.\nGasdaska recalled driving through the West Village with Baum for a pitch when she asked, \u201cIs this Tribeca?\u201d\n\u201cI was like, \u2018You don\u2019t come down here very often,\u2019\u201d Gasdaska. \u201cShe started to laugh and said, \u2018I don\u2019t like to go below 59th Street.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cBut she knew what she knew, and she knew what she didn\u2019t,\u201d he added.\nThat didn\u2019t stop Baum from finding downtown apartments for Taylor Swift and Jennifer Lawrence, helping the former secure a $20 million penthouse in Tribeca that was once owned by Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson.\nWhen Conlon and Gasdaska decamped for Elliman in 2024, Baum joined, as the pair had started helping manage her book of business in her later years.\n\u201cHaving her be a business partner over the past nine years has been a true honor in our career,\u201d Gasdaska said.\nElliman in an internal memo said despite Baum\u2019s short time at the firm, \u201cmany of us are blessed to have known and worked with her over the course of her long, trailblazing career.\u201d\n\u201cTo call Sharon a legend would be an understatement,\u201d said Elliman CEO of Brokerage for New York Richard Ferrari.\nBaum is survived by her husband, Stephen, their two sons, Ben and Sam, and her brother, David, and his husband, Ronald, according to Elliman.",

It is currently 98 percent occupied.\n\u201cOur investment in a transformative renovation has positioned 99 Park as one of the most sought-after addresses near Grand Central Station, and the building\u2019s strong leasing activity this year reflects that success,\u201d said leasing director Craig Panzirer.\nGlobal Holdings has been significantly upgrading the 1950s-era, 600,000-square-foot office building just south of Grand Central between East 39th and 40th streets. This included a redesigned facade, and amenities such as a speakeasy, golf simulator and conference center. The renovation is expected to be completed next year.\nEarlier this year, the landlord signed Amalgamated Bank to a 15-year lease in a relocation from its longtime headquarters at 275 Seventh Avenue. The 94,000-square-foot deal included space on the ground floor for a private entrance lobby.\nOther recent deals at 99 Park include the strategic advisory firm Geller &amp; Company, international children\u2019s apparel company Garan, wealth-management firm Steward Partners and Metropolitan Bank.\nGeller signed its lease\nfor 45,000 square feet\nin March, relocating from 909 Third Avenue. That same month, Garan doubled its space at the building.\nThe area around Grand Central has been one of the tightest office submarkets in the city in recent years. The availability rate was 13.6 percent in the third quarter, according to Savills.\n",

The University of Chicago owns the land and issued a 65-year ground lease to the Vue53 development team when the project began.\nVista and Boston-based Bain later refinanced that debt with a $45 million loan from Argentic in 2023, according to records. It\u2019s unclear what the total development costs were or when Bain joined the ownership group.\nRepresentatives of Blue Vista, Bain Capital and Antheus Capital did not return requests for comment.\n\u201cWe have conviction in the University of Chicago student housing market and, as the newest purpose built student housing asset in the submarket, we believe the asset is well positioned,\u201d a Bain spokesperson told\nThe Real Deal\nwhen the property was last refinanced.\nThe property likely benefited from the overall strength of student housing on a national level, as well as some nuances in the local market.

        "content": "Outer borough offices didn\u2019t have the Manhattan magic.\nBrooklyn and Queens office landlords spent much of 2025 courting the same tenants that kept the outer boroughs afloat since the pandemic: government agencies, schools and mission-driven groups. Private-sector users remained scarce, and the boroughs again lagged Manhattan\u2019s healthier leasing market.\nLong Island City and parts of Brooklyn continued to draw big-footprint tenants, but the surge of Midtown leasing still hasn\u2019t translated across the river. Brokers say outer borough availability remains high and deal flow uneven, even as education and public-service users quietly make up a growing slice of new leases.\nHere are the largest office deals of the year in Queens and Brooklyn, according to data compiled by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nNYC Department of Transportation | 47-25 34th Street | 212,094 square feet\nThe city\u2019s DOT brought the year\u2019s biggest outer borough deal,\nsigning on\nfor more than 212,000 square feet at 47-25 34th Street in Long Island City. The agency took the space from Metropolitan Realty Associates and Nuveen and plans to use it for both industrial and office uses. Newmark and SL Green represented the landlord side and a CBRE team represented the tenant.\nSpectrum | 59 Paidge Avenue | 200,000 square feet\nThe cable provider\nrenewed\nits 200,000-square-foot lease at 59 Paidge Avenue in Greenpoint, opting for another 10 years at the Steel Equities-owned site. Spectrum has occupied the low-slung complex since 2011 and locked in one of Brooklyn\u2019s largest commitments of 2025.\nBrooklyn Prospect Charter School | 181 Livingston Street | 147,944 square feet\nBrooklyn Prospect Charter School continued the trend of education tenants backfilling slow office corridors, taking nearly 148,000 square feet at Tishman Speyer\u2019s 181 Livingston Street in Downtown Brooklyn in the spring. At the time, it was Brooklyn\u2019s\nlargest lease\nsince the third quarter of 2023.\nU.S. General Services Administration | 159-30 Rockaway Boulevard | 139,377 square feet\nThe GSA signed a major lease in Jamaica at an Edward J. Minskoff building,\nTRD\nreported\nat the start of the year, to be used by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Queens. CBRE represented the federal tenant, while JLL handled the landlord side.\nAdministration for Children\u2019s Services | 1000 Dean Street | 105,000 square feet\nACS inked a full-building lease at 1000 Dean Street in Crown Heights, taking 105,000 square feet, Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The move was a consolidation of spaces in Bedford-Stuyvesant and East New York.\nBeacon Mobility | 2647 Stillwell Avenue | 83,000 square feet\nTransportation firm Beacon Mobility signed\nan 83,000-square-foot lease\nat Turnbridge Equities\u2019 Gravesend property. Turnbridge Equities acquired the Gravesend site two years ago for $13 million. Cushman &amp; Wakefield repped both sides of the deal.\nPlaza College | 118-35 Queens Boulevard | 80,000 square feet\nPlaza College renewed its Forest Hills presence,\ntaking 80,000 square feet\nat Muss Development\u2019s tower. CBRE\u2019s Roy Chipkin represented the tenant.\nNYC School Construction Authority | 30-30 47th Avenue | 75,000 square feet\nThe SCA extended its lease for 15 years at Atlas Capital Group\u2019s Long Island City building, at an asking rent of $45 per square foot. Unfortunately for ownership, the $300 million loan tied to the 1.1 million-square-foot office property was\nsent to special servicing\nin September for \u201cimminent maturity default,\u201d according to Morningstar Credit.\n",

The buyer borrowed a $67.9 million loan from FS Credit Originator, in the care of Rialto Capital Management.\nCompleted in 1988, Ryder Colonnade spans 205,400 square feet, according to its website. It\u2019s attached to the Hotel Colonnade Coral Gables, which wasn\u2019t part of the sale.\nThe price amounts to $331 per square foot.\nThe tower was recently rechristened to include the \u201cRyder\u201d name after\nRyder System\n, a Miami-Dade County homegrown logistics giant, moved its headquarters there. Ryder was based previously in a northwest area of the county for roughly 20 years, and it moved to a smaller office, citing the remote work shift.\nIn 2013, an entity tied to Boston-based TA Associates Realty paid\n$81 million\nfor the office building, property records show. In 2015, AEW Capital, also based in Boston, took over the entity, suggesting it purchased the entire ownership stake of the building, according to state corporate records.\nCrescent, led by Chairman John Goff and CEO Conrad Suszynski, is a real estate investor, manager and developer with $4.4 billion of assets under management as of February, according to its website. (The firm is different from Miami-based Crescent Heights.)\nThe discounted sale comes amid higher interest rates, insurance and other costs such as materials.\nAlthough the Federal Reserve cut the benchmark rate four times this year and last, it had imposed 11 aggressive interest rate increases in 2022 and 2023. This has made refinancing harder and also squeezed landlords with floating-rate debt, increasing their loan obligations.\nSouth Florida\u2019s office market prospered from an influx of out-of-state companies over the past five years, increasing rents to new records. Still, some landlords have felt the\nsting\nfrom higher rates and remote work, prompting them to sell their office buildings.\nIn other discounted deals, Orlando-based Foundry Commercial sold the six-story Sawgrass Lake Center building at 13450 West Sunrise Boulevard in Sunrise for\n$36.5 million\nin January, nearly $21 million less than its price seven years ago.\nIn May, Boston-based Rockpoint, Miami-based Tricera, Palm Beach-based NDT Development and Boston-based New England Development sold the 18-story One Clearlake tower at 250 South Australian Avenue in West Palm Beach for\n$45 million\n. It marked a nearly 26 percent discount from its price four years ago.\n",

The reversal of that trend at Cirrus is notable because second home buyers historically fueled much of Chicago\u2019s luxury condo market.\nBrondyke described the uptick as \u201cgreat news for the city,\u201d signaling that lingering fears about downtown living may be diminishing.\nCirrus, at 211 North Harbor Drive with views of Du Sable Lake Shore Drive, offers high\u2011end finishes, lakefront vistas and proximity to cultural attractions. These features aim to appeal to buyers seeking a pied\u2011\u00e0\u2011terre or weekend retreat. Of the 50 contracts signed this year, three are not yet closed but are expected to finalize by year-end.\nChicago\u2019s downtown condo market has faced challenges since the pandemic, with sluggish sales and price stagnation compared to suburban and single\u2011family homes. Safety concerns and perceptions of urban decline further dampened demand. The recent momentum at Cirrus suggests a turning point, particularly among affluent buyers who can afford discretionary purchases.\nWhile the number of contracts is modest compared to the overall market, the proportion of second home buyers \u2014 roughly 60 percent of Cirrus\u2019s 2025 sales\n\u2014 is significant. It highlights renewed confidence in downtown Chicago as a desirable destination, even for part-time luxury living.\nThis trend also aligns with broader patterns in Chicagoland\u2019s luxury\nhousing market\n, where multimillion\u2011dollar sales in both suburban and urban areas have surged in 2025.\nThe most recent second-home purchase at Cirrus was last week at $4.05 million for a unit on the 47th floor, Brondyke said. That represents a nearly 19 percent discount from the developers\u2019 original asking price of $4.98 million in October 2022.\nThe unit has about 3,650 square feet with a terrace facing Lake Michigan and is the third\ncondo at Cirrus\nto trade at\n$4 million or more\n, Brondyke added. The average sale price for a Cirrus unit runs about $1.3 million.\n\u2014- Joel Russell",

        "content": "Sheraton Arlington Hotel will close to make way for the construction of a $410 new hospitality property from Loews Hotels &amp; Co.\nThe Sheraton will be demolished after the 2026 FIFA World Cup, with completion of the new Loews hotel expected by 2028, according to\nthe Dallas Business Journal\n. The project, supported by incentives from the city of Arlington and the Arlington Economic Development Corporation, will transform 14 acres at 1500 Convention Center Drive.\nThe Sheraton\n, an aging 311\u2011room property built in 1984, sits less than a mile from Loews\u2019 existing 888\u2011room Arlington Hotel &amp; Convention Center and Live! by Loews in the city\u2019s\nEntertainment District\n.\nThe new Loews property will feature 513 rooms, 25,000 square feet of convention and meeting space and a parking garage with at least 735 spaces. Urbana Varro Hospitality Management Company, which operates the Sheraton, notified the Texas Workforce Commission that the hotel will close on Feb. 15, resulting in 110 layoffs.\nLoews spokesperson Lisa Garland declined to provide detailed construction timelines but hinted at an announcement in January. Marty Wieder, director of the Arlington EDC, confirmed the layoffs are tied to redevelopment plans and emphasized the strength of Arlington\u2019s hospitality market. He noted that displaced workers should find opportunities at other growing hotel properties in the area.\nThe financial agreement approved in 2023 includes $5 million from the EDC for site improvements, $15 million over seven years for the garage, and $20 million from the city over eight years for garage costs. Additional grants of $3.8 million over 10 years and $1.3 million over 14 years will be provided once the hotel opens.\nThe Loews project is part of a broader wave of hotel development and renovation in Arlington\u2019s Entertainment District. The\n$54 million Caravan Court\n, a 145\u2011key upscale hotel on Division Street, is under construction and expected to open by the 2026 World Cup. Meanwhile, the Crowne Plaza Suites Arlington, owned by Equinox Hospitality, is undergoing a $9 million renovation to update 200 rooms and common areas, while converting its indoor pool into 5,000 square feet of meeting space. The city has entered a 10\u2011year agreement to provide $3.25 million in support between 2025 and 2027.\nThe projects underscore\nArlington\u2019s push\nto expand its hospitality infrastructure, positioning the city as a destination for business events and tourism with a strategic location halfway between Dallas and Fort Worth.\n\u2013 Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "Construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar expanded its presence in Irving, Texas, buying an office building that was once the headquarters for jewelry retailer Zales.\nThe new Caterpillar site, about three miles from its current headquarters at Williams Square, will provide additional workspace and serve as a venue for hosting dealers, customers and visitors, according to\nThe Dallas Morning News\n. Financial details of the sale were not disclosed, but Dallas Central Appraisal District records value the 15\u2011acre property at 901 West Walnut Hill Lane at $51.5 million, although tax valuations often lag behind market prices.\nCoppell\u2011based office maker Vari sold the property, formerly called VariSpace Las Colinas, after acquiring it in 2019. Originally built in 1982 as the headquarters for Zales, the complex includes three office buildings totaling more than 400,000 square feet, along with a four\u2011level parking garage. At its peak, the site accommodated nearly 3,000 employees. Zales is now part of Signet Jewelers based in Akron, Ohio.\nOn its website, VariSpace calls the Las Colinas property a \u201cfully furnished turnkey office space\u201d with an onsite 7,000-square-foot cafe and lobby coffee bar, a conference and training center, a Wi-Fi enabled park and a 10,000-square-foot fitness center. Two recent leases at the property include a\nMUFG Bank renewal\nand the\nUniversity of St. Augustine for Health Sciences\n.\nCaterpillar relocated its\nglobal headquarters\nfrom Deerfield, Illinois, to the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth market in 2022. The company currently employs more than 800 people at Williams Square and about 6,600 statewide. Caterpillar has maintained a presence in Texas since the 1960s.\nLast year\nthe company added about 50,000 square feet to its Williams Square space.\nWith reported revenue of $64.8 billion in 2024, Caterpillar is the world\u2019s leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, off\u2011highway diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, and diesel\u2011electric locomotives. Led by CEO Joseph \u201cJoe\u201d Creed, Caterpillar currently ranks 64th on the Fortune 500 list of the largest companies in the United States.\n\u2013 Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "The real estate industry spent\nmillions of dollars\ntrying to prevent Zohran Mamdani from becoming mayor. The effort failed.\nMeanwhile, some working in the industry\nmade comparatively modest donations\nto Mamdani\u2019s campaign.\nThe latest campaign finance filings show that after the election, some of those donors and others in the industry contributed to the mayor-elect\u2019s transition efforts, giving at least $40,900 between Nov. 5 and Nov. 30. That represents less than 2 percent of the $2.6 million Mamdani took in during that time.\nRepresentatives for Mamdani indicated that donations through Dec. 5, which go beyond the city\u2019s filing period, have reached more than $3 million. The funds, according to the representatives, help pay for staff and operations as Mamdani prepares to take office.\nThe real estate-related donations include anyone who identified themselves as working in development, construction, architecture, property management or brokerage.\nA number of these real estate donors previously gave to Mamdani\u2019s campaign, including Beachwold Residential CEO Gideon Friedman, who donated tens of thousands of dollars to a pro-Mamdani political action committee ahead of the election. Washington, D.C.,-area developer Joseph Kaempfer, developer Craig Harwood and LCOR\u2019s David Sigman all contributed to Mamdani\u2019s campaign ahead of the general election and also donated to transition efforts.\nFriedman and Kaempfer each gave $3,700, while Harwood gave $2,000 and Sigman $250.\nAlbany-based developer Faraz Khan and New Jersey investor Mustafa Ladha each contributed $3,700.\nJRT Realty\u2019s Jodi Pulice, who donated $400 to former Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s mayoral campaign before the primary, contributed $2,000 to Mamdani\u2019s transition. JRT previously worked as a subcontractor on the city\u2019s commercial leases, which became the subject of a\nlegal fight\nthis year.\nIn May, the Department of Citywide Administrative Services issued a request for proposals\nseeking up to five brokerages\nto represent the agency on leasing and buying office properties.\nTwo weeks ago, Mamani\nnamed\n24 people to his transition committee on housing. Members hailed from housing organizations, unions, Yimby groups, tenant groups and private real estate companies. We don\u2019t yet know who the mayor-elect will tap to lead the city\u2019s housing-related agencies.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Who would you like to see lead the Department of Housing Preservation and Development? City Planning? The Department of Buildings? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Housing groups warn that\nfour bills\nthat set various requirements for city-funded housing would increase the Department of Housing Preservation and Development\u2019s budget needs by $545 million per year. In a letter to City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and Council member Rafael Salamanca, who chairs the Committee on Land Use, the New York Housing Conference, Citizens Housing and Planning Council and others urged against passing Intros. 958, 1433, 1437 and 1443. Three of the bills set citywide minimum percentages for city-funded housing, creating floors for the amount of homes affordable to extremely and very low-income tenants, two- and three-bedroom units and homeownership units. Another caps the percentage of studio apartments built in senior housing projects.\nThe housing groups argue that those measures, along with a separate bill that would set minimum construction wages on certain city-funded projects, would increase HPD\u2019s budget needs by $1.3 billion. Supporters of the wage bill, known as the Construction Justice Act, have objected to estimates of that bill\u2019s cost, saying that they grossly overshoot the potential added cost.\nThe clock is ticking for all of these bills, as the last City Council meeting of the year is slated for Dec. 18.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Port Authority police captured a horse at the entrance to JFK\u2019s Terminal 1 on Sunday night, after receiving reports that the runaway animal was seen on the JFK Expressway,\nGothamist reports\n. The equine, known as Sundance, had escaped from Curly\u2019s Cowboy Center in Southeast Queens, located less than a mile from the airport.\n\u2014 Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and his wife, Rama, will move into Gracie Mansion next month. \u201cThis decision came down to our family\u2019s safety and the importance of dedicating all of my focus on enacting the affordability agenda New Yorkers voted for,\u201d Mamdani said in a statement on Monday.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$21 million\nfor a condominium unit at 70 Vestry Street. The Tribeca condo unit is 3,200 square feet and last sold in 2023 for $15.5 million.\nCompass\u2019\nJared Schwadron has the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$488.4 million\nfor 35 Hudson Yards. Related Companies and Oxford Properties sold a 38-story portion, which includes retail, office and hospitality space, to Japan\u2019s Mori Trust,\nper reports\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $10.8 million for a condo unit at 1165 Madison Avenue. The 2,700-square-foot condo at The Bellemont last sold in 2023 for $8.8 million.\nCompass\u2019\nDane Gray and Caleb Loftus have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 92,273-square-foot, nine-story mixed-use building at 1383 Brooklyn Avenue in East Flatbush.

        "content": "Mendel Deutsch of Toms River, New Jersey, has pleaded guilty to one count of bank and wire fraud conspiracy and one count of wire fraud for his role in a brazen commercial mortgage fraud scheme in Brooklyn.\nDeutsch pleaded guilty in November, just a few weeks after one of the co-conspirators, Joshua Feldberger of the title insurer Universal Abstract, pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud conspiracy.\nThe Department of Justice accused Deutsch and Feldberger of assisting in a scheme with Arthur Spitzer to buy and sell properties and obtain mortgages on properties they did not own.\nProsecutors alleged Spitzer orchestrated the scheme in 2019 and 2020 by identifying properties in New Jersey or Brooklyn without mortgages or mortgages below the property\u2019s market value. The trio would make it appear like Spitzer owned three properties in Brooklyn and had agreed to sell them to Deutsch, who then took out a $4.5 million loan on the transaction, according to the DOJ.\nThe scheme involved multiple bad acts: The defendants allegedly created and sent letters stating that Deutsch had deposited escrow funds to close on the transaction, created fake documents showing the properties transferred to Spitzer and lied to the mortgage lender, stating Universal received more than $2 million from Deutsch at closing, causing the lender, Connect One Bank, to fund the loan.\nDeutsch\u2019s plea comes amid a crackdown by the Department of Justice and the Federal Housing Finance Agency into mortgage fraud. The agencies are targeting deals in which the borrowers sold properties to related parties or inflated building financials to obtain larger loans than they otherwise would have received.\nBut the scheme at the heart of the allegations against Spitzer, Deutsch and Feldberger is particularly bold since Spitzer and Deutsch never owned the properties. Deutsch even used the fraudulent loan proceeds to fund an actual down payment on the same properties.\n(The Brooklyn properties were owned by entities tied to Dahlia Kalter, civil court records show. Kalter\u2019s husband is Mark Nordlicht, who ran the infamous hedge fund Platinum Partners and was found guilty of securities fraud by a jury in New York federal court and given six months of house arrest.)\nDeutsch also fraudulently obtained about $1.8 million of government loans intended for small businesses during the pandemic. The businesses tied to these loans had little or no operations. He also submitted false statements about the number of employees, revenues, cost of goods sold and lost rents, according to prosecutors.\nAt a hearing in November in which Deutsch pleaded guilty, he told U.S. Judge Edward Kiel in Camden, New Jersey, that the highest level of education he had completed was the eighth grade. He stated his last job was as a salesman selling doors and hardware, which he held for 18 years.\nDeutsch, 39, faces a maximum sentence of up to 50 years and a maximum fine of $1.25 million, although he will likely be sentenced to far less. Deutsch is scheduled to be sentenced on March 16, 2026.\nSpitzer has pleaded not guilty.\nAn attorney for Deutsch did not return a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Amityville is pumping the brakes on its apartment boom.\nAfter a half decade of rapid multifamily growth, village officials want a six-month moratorium on new apartments, condos and townhomes while they study whether the surge has pushed local services to a breaking point, Newsday\nreported\n.\nThe proposed pause would block approvals or construction of any building with three or more units, Mayor Michael O\u2019Neill said. The village of about 10,000 people has the option to extend the moratorium another six months if needed and is set to take public comment Monday at Village Hall.\nAmityville\u2019s wave of development was encouraged in part by a $10 million Downtown Revitalization Initiative grant from the state in 2022, which included increased rental housing as a pillar of that revitalization.\nBut the buildout moved quickly: the village has added 500 new multiple \u201cdwelling units\u201d in the past five years, which amounts to a 20% increase over the total number, according to the proposed legislation. More than 300 came online in 2023 at AvalonBay Communities\u2019 Broadway complex.\nAvalonBay floated a second luxury building across the street while the first project was still leasing up, but scrapped the idea after local pushback. Even so, O\u2019Neill said developers continue knocking and the village keeps uncovering five to eight previously unregistered rentals each month. The moratorium, he said, is meant to \u201cmake sure we don\u2019t oversaturate the village.\u201d\nThe pressure isn\u2019t theoretical. Soon after the AvalonBay complex opened, village police and fire crews responded to nearly two dozen false alarms tied to what the developer described as construction glitches.\nOfficials also say they need better data \u2014 on occupancy, rents, traffic and infrastructure impacts \u2014 to gauge how the influx of renters is reshaping the village. Officials plan to tap internal staff and hire an outside firm through a request for proposals to run that analysis.\nResidents say the pause is overdue. Joan Donnison, president of the Bay Village Civic Association, told the outlet she was \u201cpleasantly surprised\u201d by the proposal and said the village is at \u201ca tipping point\u201d as it tries to balance revitalization with quality of life. She credited the housing influx for boosting downtown energy but said the community needs a clearer picture of how much more it can absorb.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Alec Baldwin has been\ntrying to sell\nhis Amagansett home for more than three years. But instead of knocking down the price \u2014 the logical move for stuck sellers \u2014 Baldwin is raising it.\nThe actor\u2019s home at 355 Town Lane in the Hamptons community is back on the market for $21 million, Newsday\nreported\n. The property was taken off the market a little more than a year ago, when it was available for $19 million.\nIt would be natural to think the elevated price accompanies an upgraded offering, but that isn\u2019t the case, according to Saunders &amp; Associates\u2019 Scott Bradley, the listing agent for the 10-acre estate.\nThe biggest development appears to be the home\u2019s role in a TLC reality show detailing the family lives of Baldwin, his wife and their children. But even seeing Baldwin at the home is not unprecedented for viewers, since he\ncut a two-minute video\nin early 2024 trying to hawk the home.\nBaldwin purchased the estate in 1995 for $1.7 million. Since then, he\u2019s made two additions, bringing the property\u2019s main home to 9,000 square feet. The property is approved for the construction of another home of similar size, as well as expanding the existing five-bedroom, seven-bathroom house.\nOther features of the home include two upper-level balconies, a wood-paneled library, a wine-tasting room and movie theater. The backyard features a pool with a spa, surrounded by a pavilion and stone fireplace. There\u2019s also private beach access.\nBaldwin listed the property in September 2022 for\n$29 million\n. At the start of 2023, he\ncut the price\nto $25 million, before reducing it again two months later to $22.5 million and then down to $19 million before it was taken off the market.\nIn other Baldwin dealings, the actor and his wife, Hilaria, sold their lake house upstate in 2022 for $530,000. He was also reportedly shopping his\npenthouse in Greenwich Village\nin Manhattan last year.\nRural life is the life for the Baldwins, it seems: the couple bought a 55-acre farm in Arlington, Vermont, for $1.7 million several years ago.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Other downtown property investors will likely be spooked by the selloff, which could trigger a domino effect, some insiders told the Journal.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really heartbreaking signal to other owners in the central business district,\u201d Norman Miller, a real estate professor emeritus at the University of San Diego, told WSJ. Despite the national office market showing some signs of a comeback, much of the activity is centralized in major cities like New York and\nSan Francisco\n.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say the San Diegos of the world fit that bill,\u201d Dylan Burzinski, a research analyst at real estate advisory firm Green Street, said.\nA spokesperson for Irvine Company said that the firm is still investing in San Diego, but is shifting its focus to other higher-growth markets in the city, such as La Jolla and University Town Center, as it leaves downtown. \u201cInvestment activity is shifting toward stronger submarkets,\u201d commercial real estate firm Kidder Mathews said in its third-quarter report cited by WSJ.\nIrvine Company began snapping up well-known office towers in San Diego in 2003 and eventually became the city\u2019s biggest office landlord. At the time, San Diego\u2019s economy was in the midst of growing beyond the defense industry as demand for high-quality office space increased. But with the onset of the pandemic and widespread adoption of work-from-home policies \u2014 and subsequent slow\nreturns to office\n\u2014 the local market began to suffer.\nThe firm started selling off parts of its six-building downtown San Diego portfolio last year. In October, it completed its exit with the\nsale of One America Plaza\n, the city\u2019s tallest building, for $120 million \u2014 more than 50 percent below Irvine Company\u2019s $300 million purchase price for the 650,000-square-foot property.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The other two that Zurich bought were a 131,000-square-foot building in the\nCherry Creek area of Denver\nthat fetched $52 million, and the 50,000-square-foot building at 58 Charles Street in Cambridge outside of Boston.\n\u201cIf you can pick these really interesting nodes inside these markets that have a dynamism and vibrancy, you can see where there is traffic and people returning to the office. We\u2019re trying to pick the right nodes,\u201d said Sean Bannon, head of U.S. real estate for Zurich, which has its North American headquarters just northwest of Chicago in\nSchaumburg\n.\nHe said Zurich wants to get back into the San Francisco office market, where it lost some bids to buy property earlier this year. It previously owned and operated a portfolio of boutique office buildings in San Francisco during the 2010s that it sold in late 2019, just before the pandemic rocked values. He wants to return to the market with a purchase in 2026, he told\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\u201cWe are finding a lot to like about office pricing in premium locations in good markets, particularly the discounts to replacement cost,\u201d Bannon said, adding it bought all three offices without using debt to fund the purchases.\nThe Chicago deal consists of a 32,000-square-foot building that L3 bought back in 2019 and since remodeled into a modern office building, with Live Nation as its anchor tenant. L3 paid a total of more than $19 million for it, along with the building at 932 West Randolph Street. It bought the properties from Fifth Third Bank, which closed branches in the buildings after it acquired MB Financial. The $19 million purchase also included a parking lot at 1020 West Lake Street.\nL3 used a $13.8 million construction loan from CIBC that it took out in 2022 to redevelop the building at 1020 West Randolph, property records show. The total cost of the project isn\u2019t clear, and L3 didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nL3 has been a serial investor in Fulton Market\n, where it also teamed up with LaSalle Investment Management on the popular\nTime Out Market food hall\non Fulton Market Street. The partners sold it in 2023 for $35 million to the wealthy Italian family of the global spirits brand Campari Group.\nPhair and Lanni\u2019s firm also has investments in the\nGold Coast\n, Lincoln Park, Lakeview and State Street in the Loop, among other out-of-state markets such as New York City and Miami.",

The property has sat empty since Foot Locker closed in 2020.\nThe sale follows other bargain transactions along State Street, including an $8.3 million deal at State and Madison streets\nin October\n.\nThe sale represents a major financial loss for Calmwater, which took control of the building in 2023 through a deed in lieu of foreclosure. The Sterling Organization, the previous owner which has other\nChicagoland retail woes\n, surrendered the property rather than pay off an $18.3 million mortgage. Calmwater did not comment on the deal.\nThe buyer, Downtown Islamic Center, took the opportunity to acquire a property to accommodate its growing congregation. The mosque already owns a building at 231 South State Street and had long sought additional space. Chairman Mohammed Kaiseruddin said the new facility will expand services for downtown congregants, including Sunday school for children, adult religious education and interfaith activities.\nBroker Ross Modjeska of McCaffery Interests, who represented the mosque, noted that given current market conditions, such deals are rare, and the organization was fortunate to act quickly.\nSVN Chicago Commercial brokers Chad Schroedl and Scott Maesel represented Calmwater in the deal.\nThe transaction highlights the challenges facing Chicago\u2019s Loop retail market. Nearly five years after the onset of the pandemic, downtown foot traffic remains depressed, remote work has reduced downtown activity and vacancy rates hover at about 26 percent, according to Stone Real Estate. These conditions have driven down property values, creating opportunities for buyers with local market knowledge. However, in the\nChicagoland suburbs\nretail has found a solid footing in tandem with residential development.\n\u2014\nJoel Russell",

        "content": "Nearly 900 acres of land near Yosemite National Park is coming back under the control of its original inhabitants.\nLast week, the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation closed a deal to purchase 896 acres of forests along the western border of Yosemite National Park, the Mercury News\nreported\n. The\nSan Francisco\n-based environmental group Pacific Forest Trust sold the land for $2.4 million, or $2,678 per acre.\nThe Mariposa-based tribe purchased it using funding from the California Natural Resources Agency, which has a program to help tribes acquire land.\nThe property has one house on it and was previously zoned for up to 19 ranchettes.\nThe Pacific Forest Trust bought most of the land in 2004 from a family that had owned it since 1925.\nThe trust intended to expand Yosemite National Park to the original boundaries proposed by John Muir in the 1880s. That proposed expansion was supported by the Mariposa County Board of Supervisors and the superintendent of Yosemite.\nLocated near the intersection of Wawona and Glacier Point Roads, the acreage is packed with cedar, white fir and sugar pine trees with views across the Sierra Nevada foothills and the Merced River.\nThe Southern Sierra Miwuks were driven out of the area in the 1850s as soldiers, settlers and miners moved into the Yosemite area during the\nGold Rush\n. The Ferguson Fire in 2018 charred parts of the property; the Pacific Forest Trust replanted 125,000 native trees to help restore it and began discussing a potential sale with the Southern Sierra Miwuk.\n\u201cHaving this significant piece of our ancestral Yosemite land back will bring our community together to celebrate tradition and provide a healing place for our children and grandchildren,\u201d said Sandra Chapman, tribal council chairwoman of the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation. The land will be used as \u201ca sanctuary for our people,\u201d she said.\nIt\u2019s the latest land transfer deal in California as more\nNative American tribes\nwork in tandem with environmental groups and state agencies to recover land that was once theirs. In May, the state completed the\nlargest-ever transfer of land\nto a Native American tribe in California history when the Yurok Tribe, using $56 million in funds raised from public and private sources, acquired a 47,100-acre parcel of land along the lower Klamath River, including the Blue Creek watershed.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The multifamily market in Oakland continues to face anemic property values, as evidenced by the two latest deals for apartment properties in the East Bay city. The deals are part of a broader wave of multifamily foreclosures and below-assessed sales that has swept the Bay Area for much of the year.\nArtHaus Partners and Belay Investment Group foreclosed on a loan that gave them ownership of nine apartment complexes totaling 268 units in Oakland\u2019s Lake Merritt area for a total of $30 million, the Mercury News\nreported\n. The $30 million purchase amount, or about $111,940 per unit, is 68 percent lower than the combined assessed value of the nine residential properties as of this January, per Alameda County Assessor\u2019s Office data cited by the Mercury News.\n\u201cThe combination of being in the early innings of a tech cycle and the Oakland market having bottomed out makes this the ideal time to invest,\u201d Riaz Taplin, founder and CEO of ArtHaus Partners, said. The company\u2019s \u201cnear-term priorities include stabilizing the assets by renovating and leasing the currently vacant units.\u201d\nIn a separate deal, South Bay investors Krishna Koganti and Seetaram Vemulapalli spent $21 million for the 83-unit Amelia apartment complex in Pill Hill after a lender previously foreclosed on the multifamily property. In October last year, SREC Amelia Owner foreclosed on the loan that financed The Amelia apartments; at the time, the unpaid debt totaled $23 million. The purchase by Koganti and Vemulapalli was at 8.7 percent less than its debt in last year\u2019s foreclosure; on a per-unit basis, the transaction works out to about $253,000 per residence \u2014 a low per-unit price for East Bay apartments this year.\nIn October, Madison Realty Capital began the\nforeclosure process on The Fay\n, a 363-unit, 23-story apartment tower in San Jose, after its developer Murro defaulted on a $182.5 million construction loan. That property opened to residents late last year. And in July, the University Park apartment complex in Berkeley\nheaded to a foreclosure auction\nafter Academy West Investments\ndefaulted on payments\ntied to the apartment complex.\nElsewhere in the East Bay, in August, an Abacus Capital Group affiliate paid $98.3 million for the 259-unit\nPark Central Apartments\nin Concord, working out to $379,500 per unit, or a total property value 24.7 percent lower than its assessed value of $130.5 million.\nThe\nAtrium Downtown apartments\nin Walnut Creek sold to a Fresno-based investor group led by Valley Yellow Pages CEO Siegfried Fischer, which bought the 78-unit property from Sequoia Equities for $31 million \u2014 down 3.4 percent from the complex\u2019s most recently assessed value of $32.1 million for a per-unit price of $397,400.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Tetra Technologies\u2019 current headquarters is at a seven-story, 171,000-square-foot office building at 24955 Interstate 45 North. It was built in 2008.\nNewmark\u2019s David Baker, Elliott Hirshfeld and Kristen Baker are the leasing agents for San Francisco-based Spear Street. Tetra Technologies was represented by Flatrock Commercial Real Estate Group\u2019s Caleb Lawson.\nTetra Technologies will occupy space in the South Tower of the two-building, 564,000-square-foot office property. The campus was built in 2014, and is about 26 miles north of downtown Houston. It\u2019s also home to Expand Energy, which has a full-building lease at the 279,000-square-foot North Tower.\nSpear Street bought 1000 Energy Drive in 2019, deed records show. It was valued at $142.7 million for property tax purposes in 2025, according to appraisal district data.\nHouston\u2019s battered office market\nis continuing its slow recovery, logging a second consecutive quarter of positive net absorption in the third quarter. That number increased to 639,000 square feet, Newmark reported, bringing the year\u2019s total net absorption of office space to 1.2 million square feet. Partners Real Estate put the market vacancy at 26.3 percent at the end of the third quarter, a slight dip from the previous quarter.\nThere\u2019s a bright side to the distress that\u2019s befallen Houston\u2019s aging office buildings. Valuations have dropped for these older properties to the extent that buying is more appealing than leasing for some office users. As a result, the number of\nowner-user deals\nhas risen, providing a much needed boost to the sluggish market.\n",

        "content": "Everyone knew\nthe switch from 421a to 485x would mean fewer large multifamily projects.\nTurns out, it\u2019s not as bad as expected. It\u2019s worse.\nThe new tax abatement has not merely reduced the number of mixed-income projects with 100 or more units. It has eliminated them.\nSince the state enacted 485x in April 2024 with a wage floor for projects with 100 or more units \u2014 at the behest of construction union leader Gary LaBarbera \u2014 exactly zero such projects have registered for the program.\nFourteen of the 180 projects seeking the abatement would have exactly 99 units, but the average unit count is only 31, according to an analysis by the Real Estate Board of New York of the\nlatest data\n(through October 31). Of the 5,546 total units, just 350 will be in Manhattan.\nClearly, the housing crisis has no end in sight.\nWhen it comes to housing supply, large projects carry the freight \u2014 even with the de facto cap imposed by 485x. The program\u2019s 99-unit projects make up just 8 percent of the buildings but 25 percent of the units.\nUnder the expired 421a, projects of 100 or more units yielded 59 percent of the homes, the NYU Furman Center\nfound\n.\nHowever, some 100-plus-unit projects are still being built in New York City. Because of the way all-affordable housing is funded and taxed, it pencils out without the 485x property tax break and is not subject to 485x\u2019s union-friendly wage floor.\nThis might sound like a good thing to activists who want more affordable and less market-rate housing built. But they are wrong.\nThe supply shortage can only be fixed if both affordable and market-rate development are firing on all cylinders. Reducing the latter does not produce more of the former. They are different animals. Shrinking the elephant population does not increase the mouse population.\nAffordable projects typically require piecing together a bewildering array of funding sources \u2014 Low Income Housing Tax Credits, project-based vouchers, grants and loans from city, state and federal agencies, foundation money and more.\nThis Syracuse project\nhas at least seven.\nThe timelines are longer because of the bureaucracy involved. The fee structure is different, as are the buildings themselves. For example, rooms in affordable housing must be larger. And units are rented via housing lotteries, not a standard leasing office.\nMany developers don\u2019t build affordable housing for the same reason that brain surgeons don\u2019t do knee replacements. Instead, they do certain kinds of projects again and again, allowing them to gain expertise, increase efficiency and reduce risk.\nLast month I ran into a developer who builds\nlarge multifamily projects\nbut only as-of-right. He has no experience with rezonings and doesn\u2019t plan to try one. Another firm, after a\ncontroversy\n, sticks to\nrehabbing empty buildings\n.\nNothing has been gained by stopping developers from building large, market-rate projects and the investors and lenders who fund them. All New York City is getting is less housing.\nAn activist might ask: Doesn\u2019t 485x\u2019s de facto ban on 100-unit projects allow affordable developers to outcompete market-rate ones for larger sites? Not really.\nIn many neighborhoods, rents are high enough that developers of sub-100-unit, 485x projects win the bidding for parcels zoned for more than 99 units. Sometimes they plan two or three \u201cseparate\u201d sub-100-unit projects, avoiding the 485x wage floor.\nEven if these midsize projects dried up, affordable development would still be limited by finite subsidies and the capacity of agencies that administer them.\nThe real estate industry and YIMBY groups need to get this message to Albany, and fast. The state legislative session kicks off next month and ends in early June. If 485x\ndoesn\u2019t get fixed\nby then, it\u2019s \u201cWait \u2019til next year,\u201d as Brooklyn Dodgers fans used to say.\nThey should explain that expanding 485x beyond 100 units won\u2019t snuff out all-affordable projects, which in some areas are the only ones that pencil out.\nConsider the Jay Group\u2019s attempt to\ndefy the odds\nand build a mostly market-rate project under 485x\u2019s predecessor (421a) at 2886 Atlantic Avenue in East New York. The developer couldn\u2019t lease enough market-rate units at the rents it needed ($2,500 to $3,000 for one-bedrooms), so it sold the project to Camber Property Group and the nonprofit Institute for Community Living, who turned it into a subsidized, all-affordable project.\nIf I were a civic-minded developer, I wouldn\u2019t rely on REBNY or lobbying firms to make the case. I\u2019d meet with as many Assembly and Senate Democrats as possible, so when they conference with chamber leaders to decide on an agenda, 485x has a shot to be included.\nOtherwise, we\u2019ll remain stuck at ground zero.\nEditor\u2019s note: This is the inaugural edition of Erik Engquist\u2019s newsletter Reality Check, which aims to cut through the political spin and rhetoric that plague the real estate industry.\n",

The 37\u2011acre mixed\u2011use project is designed to transform the area with 880,000 square feet of office space, 238,000 square feet of retail, 1,785 apartments and a 175\u2011key hotel.\nThe first phase of construction is expected to begin in early 2026 and finish by 2028. Fort Worth City Council already\napproved incentives\nin June, including a Chapter 380 grant and tax increment financing for FW Westside RE Investors, with grants spread over 15 years. The developers are now seeking additional support from the Near Westside TIF District.\nIn Texas, TIF financing leverages the increases in property value to fund infrastructure projects. Infrastructure at the Westside Village project will include roads, utilities and streetscaping.\nTo qualify for the incentives, developers must meet strict requirements. The first phase must involve at least $410 million in investment, with $311 million in hard construction costs spent by the end of 2030. Minimum build\u2011out requirements include 200,000 square feet of office space, 95,000 square feet of retail and a hotel with at least 150 rooms.\nWestside Village is one of several megadevelopments in Fort Worth.

        "content": "At his Douglas Enclave apartment building in Miami\u2019s Little Havana, developer Henry Torres cut rents for some of the 199 units. Yet, his bottom line took no hit.\nAfter completing the project in 2023, Torres decreased annual rates by an average of $3,000 and recouped the loss through a roughly $4,500 property tax break per reduced unit awarded by the\nLive Local Act\n. The total: about $450,000 in savings from his $950,000 tax bill this year.\nThe rent break also helped him fill the building faster. Amid South Florida\u2019s stubbornly persistent and pervasive\naffordability crisis\n, tenants are on the hunt for a reprieve.\n\u201cIt definitely got a lot more smiles on people\u2019s faces. I can tell you that. People are struggling right now, especially the blue collar class,\u201d said Torres, founder of the Coral Gables-based Astor Companies. \u201cIt helped us tremendously to get units rented faster.\u201d\nHe\u2019s no anomaly. South Florida apartment developers and landlords seized on the Live Local Act, a state law that incentivizes landlords to include\nworkforce\nunits at their buildings. Although much of the industry buzz has been over the law\u2019s main perk for\nlarger projects\n, its less touted bonus \u2013\u2013\nproperty tax breaks\n\u2013\u2013 is already reshaping the multifamily market.\nUnder the legislation, landlords who finished projects in the past five years and designate at least 71 units as workforce or affordable get a carrot: a 75 percent tax abatement for apartments reserved for households earning from 80 percent to 120 percent of the area median income, and 100 percent tax relief for apartments for tenants earning less than 80 percent of the AMI.\nAcross South Florida, at least 48 properties qualified this year, according to data provided by the property appraisers for Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. Many weren\u2019t planned as Live Local and were built before the law existed, and the developers brought the apartments under the state law\u2019s purview retroactively to tap into its tax breaks.\nIt came at a critical time. Over the past two years, demand slowed compared to recent years\u2019 boom, requiring concessions, and costs increased across the board.\n\u201cDevelopers are looking at projects and saying, \u2018Alright, property insurance is going up, property taxes are going up. How do we offset things?\u2019\u201d said Matthew Scott, a Greenspoon Marder land use and zoning attorney. \u201cThey run the math and Live Local gives the tax benefit, so that\u2019s less money they have to pay.\u201d\nLive Local math\nCoral Rock Development Group completed the 204-unit Metropolitan in Coral Springs last year, a dicey time for multifamily.\nAfter years of record in-migration and rent growth, developers jumped on the bonanza with new projects. By the time they completed a record\n18,600 mostly market-rent units\nlast year, outpacing 15,000 net new leases, the influx of out-of-staters had slowed and some transplants had\nreturned home\n.\nLease-ups slowed.\nCoral Springs wasn\u2019t as overbuilt with apartments as other submarkets, but Coral Rock still converted Metropolitan, planned as market-rate apartments, to workforce via Live Local. The building reached full lease-up this fall with roughly 160 apartments for earners of up to 120 percent of the AMI, charging about $350 less per month than market-rate units at the Metropolitan.\n\u201cWe determined through metric analysis that we would accelerate leasing and not lose money,\u201d said Coral Rock\u2019s Michael Wohl. \u201cYou need to lease-up faster and stabilize faster, so you can be eligible for permanent financing.\u201d\nFor the math to pencil out, landlords ensure tax savings offset reduced rents. The delta between market rents and workforce rents can\u2019t be too big, a condition far more common in suburbs far from the glitz of coastal neighborhoods that command top rates.\nOut of the 28 Miami-Dade properties that received a Live Local tax break this year, 19 are in suburban areas. Hialeah, a western city that\u2019s traditionally been a bedroom community offering cheaper housing, is home to nine.\nIMC Equity Group\u2019s Carlos Segrega said Live Local won\u2019t work for properties in Coral Gables.\n\u201cThe income demographics are higher,\u201d Segrera said. But \u201cif the market [rent] is at $3,000 and you can lease it at $2,700 \u2026 now the pro-forma pencils.\u201d\nAt IMC Equity\u2019s 340-unit\nThe Upland in Hialeah\n, about 80 units qualified for the abatement, Segrera said.\nAt other Hialeah properties, the market rent already is at the rate for earners of 120 percent of the AMI. Such was the case with the 260-unit\nPura Vida Hialeah\n, which Coral Rock qualified for the tax break before selling it earlier this year.\n\u201cYou are not losing money on the rents, and correspondingly, you are getting the abatement,\u201d Wohl said. \u201cSo you\u2019d be an idiot not to.\u201d\nWorkforce rentals specialist Affiliated Development received the tax break on four properties this year, without lowering rents since it already developed them underwriting below-market rates. The abatement covered unexpected increases in overhead.\n\u201cIt was necessary because of the dramatic spike in operating cost. Insurance doubled. Materials, for when you turn a unit, skyrocketed,\u201d said Nick Rojo of Affiliated. \u201cIt really helped offset those costs.\u201d\n\u201cA business to run\u201d\nThe tax reprieve comes with hurdles.\nLandlords said they try to lease as many units as possible to earners of up to 120 percent of the AMI, but also can\u2019t turn away prospective tenants with higher incomes. Qualifying for the Live Local tax break can be an administrative headache. The workforce rents are based on the lower of either the rent outlined by the Florida Housing Finance Corporation or 90 percent of the market rent in the area of their project.\nLandlords have to collect tax returns or paystubs from households to confirm their incomes meet the workforce threshold.\nAnother kink is that lenders still don\u2019t recognize the tax break.\n\u201cFannie and Freddie, which is 85 percent of the permanent [financing] market, do not recognize Live Local savings, so it\u2019s really hurt people from the total financing they could get,\u201d said Alex Ruiz of Prestige Companies, which received tax abatements on four Hialeah properties this year. \u201cIf they were going to give me $10 million for a project, and with Live Local I should be able to qualify for $14 million, it doesn\u2019t matter to them. They [still] give me $10 million.\u201d\nWhile the tax breaks are bad news for counties and municipalities that rely on the revenue, developers argue it\u2019s a necessary tool for them to provide the same level of service and quality to the workforce.\nSouth Florida\u2019s affordability crisis isn\u2019t lost on landlords.\nAt her 192-unit\nNo. 17 Residences\nin Miami\u2019s Allapattah, developer Lissette Calderon got the tax break after reserving some apartments for the workforce, offering one bedrooms below $2,000 a month and two bedrooms in the low $2,000. These rates are \u201cunheard of in today\u2019s market,\u201d she said, adding the tax break has allowed her Neology Group firm to continue offering a coveted lifestyle with amenities like yoga classes. Otherwise, higher expenses would have dented budgets, leaving Neology with no choice but to raise rents, Calderon said.\n\u201cThis has allowed us to continue to maintain the rents we were hoping to maintain and continue that aspirational living to the engines that drive our community,\u201d she said, referring to the workforce.\nTorres, too, is cognizant renters are struggling, saying it\u2019s become normal for many South Floridians to pay half of their incomes for housing instead of the commonly accepted 30 percent, He is considering applying the Live Local tax break to some of his projects on tap.\n\u201cI have a lot of sympathy for people struggling, but I have to make sure our building makes money,\u201d Torres said. \u201cWe have a business to run, too.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Sotheby\u2019s International Realty landed the Walters | Plaxen Group, which packed up its seven-person team and a hefty inventory list from the Beverly Hills Estates, TRD has learned.\nThe group, which has handled more than $220 million in Los Angeles real estate sales so far this year, will be based out of the Sotheby\u2019s offices in Beverly Hills and Miami.\nThe Walters | Plaxen with career sales in excess of $1 billion, is the latest big get for Sotheby\u2019s, which earlier this year recruited\nErnie Carswell\nfrom Douglas Elliman. Carswell brought his 15-person team, Ernie Carswell &amp; Associates, to Sotheby\u2019s in May with the agent referring to the brokerage in an interview with\nThe Real Deal\nat the time as being at the \u201ctop of its ilk,\u201d adding\u00a0 \u201cmy team and myself now want that type of solid track of consistency and longevity.\u201d\nCristian David, Sotheby\u2019s Southern California region executive vice president, said the brokerage\u2019s global brand is a big selling point to agents.\n\u201cThe industry\u2019s strongest professionals \u2026 want a brand that understands this marketplace\u2019s nuances, anticipates global wealth shifts and equips them with world-class tools and mentorship,\u201d David told TRD.\nWalters said as much in a statement, calling out the brokerage\u2019s \u201cglobal ecosystem.\u201d\n\u201cAs wealth expands across continents, we\u2019re expanding with it,\u201d she said.\nPlaxen added that \u201cunlocking new markets\u201d also factored into the decision to move their licenses over to a global brokerage to keep step with the movement of high-net-worth clients.\nWalters | Plaxen also includes Brooke Enwere, Christian Garcia, Yona Lador, Necole Hilbert and Milan Ciro.\nMarket \u201cstandout\u201d\nThe team brings a strong track record that has continued this year, when it joined with Beverly Hills Estates founders Branden and Rayni Williams to represent the buyers of Melhill Estate in Brentwood for $53 million in October. Walters | Plaxen also had a hand in the sale of 1414 Donhill, which was purchased by Fashion Nova\u2019s Richard Saghian for $32 million in June, and provided representation of Sir Anthony Hopkins in the November sales of his two Palisades lots at 15303 and 15309 Friends Street for $6.1 million.\nAt the top of the group\u2019s inventory was the $108 million co-listing of 1200 Bel Air Road in Bel-Air, which was removed from the market late last week. There are plans for the team to re-list the residence, according to a spokesperson.\nThere\u2019s also 9330 Flicker Way in the Bird Streets, which is asking $68 million. They\u2019re set to list 1360 Laurel Way in Beverly Hills for $53 million, 1951 Bel Air Road in Bel-Air for $88 million and 556 Catalonia in the Palisades for $40 million. The group also holds listings in Las Vegas, Miami and Thailand.\n\u201cThe Walters | Plaxen team had their biggest wins while at the Beverly Hills Estates, including several record-breaking sales,\u201d brokerage co-founder and President Branden Williams said. \u201cDuring their time here, they became a standout team, so it\u2019s no surprise the corporate giants came calling. That\u2019s just not who we are. We\u2019re a boutique brokerage built on collaboration, transparency and a culture the big firms can\u2019t replicate. It\u2019s been an honor to fuel their growth and watch their trajectory take off.\u201d\nComings and goings\nIndeed, the team\u2019s departure marks a year of changes at For the Beverly Hills Estates.\nIt landed big names such as Jaqueline Chernov from Compass and recently announced its expansion into the Palisades with a new office called\nPalisades Estates\n.\nIt\u2019s also seen some other talent leave.\nIn March, Mick Partridge left the brokerage for Carolwood Estates, bringing with him two agents and a director of operations. Carolwood also poached the\nTavangarian team\n, helmed by Shana and Emila Tavangarian. The two are the daughters of famed ulra-luxe spec developer Ardie Tavangarian. With their move, they brought along their co-listing of Villa Siena at 607 Siena Way, which was designed by their father, and listed for $177 million. The listing was shared with the Williams but has since been taken off the market.\nMore recently, in July,\nMatthew Clayman\nleft the Beverly Hills Estates as its broker of record and general manager to oversee Coldwell Banker Realty\u2019s Beverly Hills and Hancock Park offices. Clayman\u2019s since been on a recruiting tear, with the brokerage announcing seven new agents, including\nSeverin Braham\n, former director of operations for the Williams and Williams Estates Group at the Beverly Hills Estates.\n",

        "content": "Pulte Homes\npaid $14 million for the first phase of a townhome construction project at the former AT&amp;T headquarters redevelopment in Hoffman Estates.\nThe townhome construction is part of\nBell Works Chicagoland\n, a mixed-use development on the site of the\nformer telecom giant\u2019s headquarters\nin the northwest suburb of Chicago.\nInspired by Somerset\n, the site\u2019s developer, is partnering with Pulte Homes on construction of the residential portion of the campus, which will feature 164 townhomes. The developer is also planning a 300-unit apartment building on part of the residential portion of the site.\nPulte Homes spent the $14 million to purchase 87 lots from Inspired for the first phase of the townhome development on Nov. 3, according to public records. The lots are on the southern end of the residential site, which was previously undeveloped land to the east of the AT&amp;T campus.\nConstruction on the townhome site broke ground in March, and the project is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2026. After making initial land improvements, the developers received approval from the city to begin applying for building permits for phase one of the two-phase project in November.\nThe north end of the site contains about 80 more lots for townhomes that are planned for construction after the first phase is finished.\nPulte Homes did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe townhome prices will start in the low $500,000 range, according to Pulte Homes\u2019 website. They\u2019ll range from 1,900 to 2,400 square feet. The homebuilder\u2019s website lists three design plans, ranging from three to four bedrooms and two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half bathrooms. Each townhome will have a two-car garage.\nInspired by Somerset has developed the Bell Works site with the goal of establishing a \u201cmetroburb,\u201d an urban-style mixed-use development in the suburbs. The developer bought the 1.2 million-square-foot property at 2000 Center Drive in 2019 for $21 million.\nThe eastern portion of the building, covering 420,000 square feet, is 98 percent leased, a Somerset spokesperson said Monday. Tenants include offices, retail and coworking spaces. Somerset is also working on developing the west side of the building, which will open an additional 430,000 square feet of office and 70,000 square feet of retail.\nHoffman Estates planning officials will consider a change to the tax-increment financing agreement for the Bell Works project in a meeting on Monday. The new agreement would allow Somerset to keep 95 percent of TIF proceeds for 15 years, up from 10 years in the existing agreement. In the last five years of the agreement, the city and Somerset would split the tax proceeds evenly.\nPulte Homes has also been building elsewhere in the Chicago suburbs, including the planned Estates of Ravinia Meadow in Orland Park. That development will include 129 new homes, with prices starting in the mid $600,000 range.\n",

The buyer is a trust, and the only listed trustee is the buyer\u2019s agent, Genna Stolnik of Compass Real Estate.\nThe final sale price is unavailable, but the Highland Park home is the most expensive residential sale in Texas this year, based on information compiled by the Houston Association of Realtors.\nCrousen listed the home in February, easily taking the first spot on the list of\nthe most expensive luxury homes for sale in Texas\n, compiled by HAR from the state\u2019s foremost Multiple Listing Services.\nSince then, the home has only been outstripped in asking price by the $64 million\nCrespi Estate\nin Dallas; the $60 million\nLodge at Hunters Creek\nin Houston; and a\nUniversity Park mansion\nformerly owned by the late Fortress Investment Group CEO Joshua Pack, asking $35 million. None has sold yet.\nSitting on more than an acre, the six-bedroom, 13-bathroom Euclid Avenue home boasts one of the largest lots in Highland Park, according to listing agent Jason Garcia of Briggs Freeman Sotheby\u2019s International Real Estate.\nBuilt in 2015 by architect Robbie Fusch, the traditionalist manor imported its limestone floors, corniced fireplace and bronze hardware from France. A basilica-style dome, gilt in 24-carat gold leaf, caps the grand foyer. Roman pillars support an arcade belting the courtyard, which includes a fish pond fountain, a swimming pool, an outdoor kitchen and a loggia. With almost 19,000 square feet, the asking price amounts to about $1,700 per square foot.\nFusch also designed the most expensive listing of 2024, a\n17,700-square-foot mansion on Strait Lane modeled after the White House\nfor investor Toby Neugebauer. The \u201cWhite House of Dallas\u201d left the market this summer, apparently unpurchased, according to Dallas County records.\nOut of the state\u2019s major metros, the only sale that might rival the mansion at 4000 Euclid Avenue is a\nwaterfront compound on Westlake Drive\nthat recently sold with an undisclosed asking price somewhere above $20 million.\n",

JPMorgan Chase provided the financing, converting last year\u2019s\n$430 million bridge loan\ninto a five-year term.\nThe debt deal was first reported by\nCommercial Real Estate Direct\n. Iron Hound Management\u2019s Rob Verrone arranged the deal, which came about as the property stabilized with nearly 95 percent leased, according to Bistricer.\nThere are two units available on the property\u2019s\nwebsite\n: a studio apartment for $3,000 monthly rent and a one-bedroom unit for $5,300 monthly rent.\nClipper landed the bridge loan last May, months after topping out construction on the three-building complex. That debt retired a $386 million construction loan provided by the Bank of China and SL Green shortly into the pandemic.\nThe 799,000-square-foot property, unspooled along the East River, was designed by CentraRuddy Architecture. There are 230 affordable units, as well as 40,000 square feet of amenities, including a pool, a sauna, a fitness center, a tennis court, a game room and a pet spa.\nSL Green provided Bistricer a $70 million loan when he acquired the site with then-partner Joseph Chetrit for $25 million in 2012. Seven years later, Bistricer bought Chetrit out of the project.\nOutside of Brooklyn, Bistricer has suffered alongside his competitors when it comes to rent-stabilized properties. In the spring, Clipper sold an 83-unit apartment building with rent-stabilized units in Lincoln Square\nfor $45.5 million\n, a deep discount from the $79 million purchase price in 2017.\nBack in Greenpoint, the Jay Group recently acquired the lot at 97 West Street from Jack Guttman\u2019s Pearl Realty Management\nfor $130 million\n. The developer also\nlanded a $320 million construction loan\nfor a 590-unit rental project on the site.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "New York\u2019s bid to bring thousands of illegal basement apartments up to code is landing with a thud as housing advocates warn that proposed rules could scare off the very homeowners the program is designed to help.\nThe Department of Buildings\u2019 draft regulations \u2014 including a requirement for giant, five-inch red lettering marking basement entrances \u2014 have become a symbol of what critics describe as a burdensome approach to the pilot program, according to\nThe City\n. The signage rule specifically was mocked by the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, which unveiled an eight-foot banner to show just how impractical it would be.\nThe pilot is meant to give owners in designated neighborhoods a 10-year path to legalize otherwise off-the-books units without triggering the state\u2019s tougher multiple-dwelling law. In theory, tenants could remain while owners incrementally bring their apartments up to code.\nBut advocates and attorneys say the fine print exposes owners to steep penalties and tenants to displacement if owners can\u2019t meet the conditions, a dynamic that could keep already wary homeowners from enrolling.\n\u201cThis rule\u2026 would ensure that no one registers and comes out of the woodwork because it\u2019s too risky,\u201d Citizens Housing and Planning Council\u2019s Howard Slatkin told the publication. Pratt Center policy director Sylvia Morse called the rules unworkable and warned that the program is set up to \u201cfail.\u201d\nThe stumbling blocks go beyond signage. The rules require an apartment to have a full kitchen with a window, utilities and proper hookups. But owners cannot legally pull permits to install those features without first having a legal unit; that\u2019s the kind of catch-22 that doomed the city\u2019s earlier basement pilot in East New York, where not a single homeowner made it through the process.\nHPD\u2019s companion regulations also raise questions about tenant protections. While existing residents would have a nominal right to return after construction, they must have lived in the unit since April 2024 and vacate within 30 days of notice from owners. Tenant advocates say that the timeline is unrealistic for low-income renters in a market with vanishing affordability.\nBasement apartments remain essential, if risky, housing for tens of thousands of New Yorkers. After Hurricane Ida\u2019s deadly flooding, the push to bring these units above board gained urgency.\nThe Adams administration has\npaired the pilot\nwith its \u201cCity of Yes\u201d zoning push to unlock accessory dwelling units citywide. But unless DOB and HPD rework the rules in response to public feedback, the city risks repeating its 2019 failure and leaving a major source of informal housing stuck underground.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The surge in popularity of\narena-anchored mixed-use developments\nhas a late Dallas icon to thank.\nTom Hicks, who died on Saturday at the age of 79, was a pioneer in sports real estate, foreseeing the success of districts that integrate sports complexes with other uses, like offices, retail and multifamily.\nKnown for perfecting the leveraged buyout, Hicks and business partner Bobby Haas made beverage industry history when they brokered the merger of soda companies Dr. Pepper and 7Up.\nHicks spun his success into a storied career in sports ownership. He owned the\nDallas Stars\nfrom 1995 to 2011; the team won the Stanley Cup in 1999. He owned the Texas Rangers from 1998 to 2010. He also had a 50 percent stake in Liverpool Football Club from 2007 to 2010.\nAs owner of the Stars, Hicks partnered with Ross Perot Jr. to usher in the development of Victory Park, the entertainment district across Woodall Rogers Freeway from\ndowntown\n. The pair developed American Airlines Center, which opened in 2001. It\u2019s the home arena for the Stars and the Dallas Mavericks.\n\u201cThat partnership we put together in the \u201990s to build the arena\u2026 truly transformed the city,\u201d Perot\ntold\nthe Dallas Morning News.\nToday, Victory Park is part of the growing headquarters of\nY\u2019all Street\n. It will soon be home to the\nnew Goldman Sachs campus\n, which will anchor Hunt Realty\u2019s NorthEnd development.\nWhen he purchased the Texas Rangers, Hicks also bought the 270 acres around The Ballpark in Arlington. He had similar dreams of building a mixed-use development anchored by the ballpark, but that didn\u2019t happen while he owned the team.\nDuring his ownership, the Stars and the Rangers filed for bankruptcy in 2011 and 2010, respectively, and were sold at auction.\nHicks and his wife, Cinda, were owners of the iconic Crespi Estate in Dallas\u2019 Preston Hollow. It was built in 1938 for Italian Count Pio Crespi. The Hickses added a two-story guest house and a three-story pool house. The 27,000-square-foot estate at 5619 Walnut Hill Drive consistently ranks among t\nhe state\u2019s most expensive listings\nand has since been owned by banker Andy Beal and developer Mehrdad Moayedi.\nHicks\u2019 death drew condolences from fellow Dallas sports owner Jerry Jones, who said in a statement, \u201cBeing shoulder to shoulder with him was always more than ballparks and stadiums, though. It was about personal respect, trust and friendship.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Nvidia\n\u2019s Santa Clara headquarters campus is set to grow with another hexagonal building.\nThe world\u2019s most valuable company submitted an architectural review with the City of Santa Clara to build a 692,634-square-foot building at 2300 and 2350 Walsh Avenue, the Silicon Valley Business Journal\nreported\n. Nvidia owns the site, as it does with other properties in the Santa Clara area it occupies.\nThe planned office building would resemble the hexagonal shape of its other signature headquarters buildings along San Tomas Expressway and Walsh Avenue. Those two geometric buildings \u2014 dubbed \u201cVoyager\u201d and \u201cEndeavor\u201d \u2014 are across San Tomas Expressway from 11 other Nvidia headquarters buildings and two parking structures. The new hexagonal building, like the buildings across San Tomas Expressway from Voyager and Endeavor, will be connected to the starship-like headquarters buildings at 2788 and 2880 San Tomas Expressway via a pedestrian bridge, according to planning documents filed with the city. Gensler, which designed the Voyager and Endeavor buildings, is the architect for the expansion project.\nNvidia\u2019s proposed office building will sit on a 13-acre site currently home to a 10-building office and research campus, which the company\nbought earlier this year for $123 million\n. It marked one of the largest property deals of the year in the city.\nThe chip-making giant, bolstered by the exploding growth of the\nartificial intelligence sector in Silicon Valley\nand beyond, has been on a real estate tear this year, dropping more than $400 million on property surrounding its neighboring Voyager and Endeavor headquarters buildings. In July, it purchased a nearby four-building office complex at 2740 Scott Boulevard for $4.5 million. And in September, it bought a 125,000-square-foot building it was leasing at\n2701 San Tomas Expressway\nfrom Sobrato for $83.2 million.\nIn May, the company filed plans to build a separate 324,000-square-foot structure at 2400 Condensa Street, behind Voyager and Endeavor across the San Tomas Aquino Creek, to house offices, lab space and parking.\nWhile Nvidia\u2019s real estate moves have largely been concentrated near its Santa Clara home, the company has also been moving into new territory \u2014 namely, its\nfirst-ever offices in San Francisco\n. Last month, the Jensen Huang-led corporation finalized a lease agreement for 45,000 square feet at 1090 Doctor Maya Angelou Lane, known as Building B of the Mission Rock mixed-use development co-owned in part by Tishman Speyer and the San Francisco Giants.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The complaint and suggestion departments are open.\nMayor-elect Zohran Mamdani held a closed-door meeting Tuesday with members of the Association for a Better New York and the Partnership for New York City. There, he reassured developers, lenders and investors that he is always open to hearing from them.\n\u201cI [assured] that my door to their feedback, their concerns and into identifying areas of collaboration will always remain open,\u201d he said during a press conference after the meeting.\nThe meeting was initiated by the mayor-elect\u2019s transition team, which also scheduled a meeting with homeless advocates later on Tuesday. At the press conference, Mamdani said ABNY CEO Emma Pfohman, the Partnership\u2019s outgoing CEO and President Kathy Wylde and its incoming head, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, helped organize the meeting.\nRoughly 20 people met with the mayor-elect Tuesday morning, including Rob Speyer, CEO of Tishman Speyer and chair of the Partnership; Nadeem Meghji, global co-head of real estate at Blackstone; Priscilla Almodovar, former CEO of Fannie Mae; Jed Walentas, CEO of Two Trees and chair of the Real Estate Board of New York; Carlina Rivera, a former City Council member who recently took the helm New York State Association for Affordable Housing; and Asahi Pompey, chair of the urban investment group at Goldman Sachs, according to Wylde.\nTenant organizer Cea Weaver, who has advised Mamdani on housing policy, was also in attendance.\nMamdani began the meeting by citing a comment he made to the\nNew York Times\nin June, that his view on the private market\u2019s role in housing construction had evolved, and he now recognizes the \u201cvery important\u201d part it plays.\nThe meeting then touched on a number of issues that Mamdani\nbroached\nat a previous meeting with the Partnership, including his pledge to freeze rents for stabilized tenants for four years and his support for overhauling the city\u2019s property tax system.\n\u201cI spoke not only about my continued commitment to freeze the rent for more than two million rent-stabilized tenants, but also my commitment to asking and understanding the roadblocks that they have faced in building more housing across the city and how we can ensure deeper levels of affordability, how we can partner in advocating for the resources this city deserves from the federal administration,\u201d Mamdani said at the press conference.\nHe said he spoke to attendees about the importance of reducing the time it takes to lease up affordable housing units. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if he was speaking specifically about units set aside for formerly homeless individuals, but the median time to lease up such units was 235 days in fiscal year 2025, according to the\nMayor\u2019s Management Report\n.\nWhen asked about four pending City Council bills that would add new\nrequirements\nto city-funded housing, Mamdani didn\u2019t take a position. Housing groups have\nwarned\nCity Council that passing the measures, which Wylde said did not come up during the meeting, would significantly increase the cost of building housing and lead to fewer units being built.\n\u201cMy focus is on building as much housing as we can across the city, and I will stay in conversation with the City Council on the proposals they put forward,\u201d Mamdani said.\nWylde said the group discussed the need to fund renovations of rent-stabilized apartments that are being kept off the market, though no specific ideas emerged. Still, she felt the meeting was \u201cvery constructive.\u201d\n\u201cHe was taking notes the whole meeting,\u201d Wylde said. \u201cI think he was listening and was very interested in what everyone had to say.\u201d\n",

The sentence could ultimately stretch up to 10 years.\nConover was\narrested\nin March following a police chase in his Jeep, according to court documents. A local police officer tried to de-escalate the situation after multiple attempted stops, only for Conover to drive into the cop, throwing him 40 feet, then embarking on another chase that was ended by state police.\nThe police officer ended up in the hospital with a leg injury.\nConover\u2019s appearances in court created more noise over his legal future.\nBefore his arraignment\n, Conover said that \u201cif anyone dares try to test my mental competence, I will eviscerate every single person with my intelligence right now.\u201d He also claimed to be the victim of a police sting.\nAfter a closed-door competency hearing and a 30-day stint at a mental health facility, Conover was deemed competent for trial. In September, however, his attorney filed a notice of insanity defense, arguing before sentencing that Conover had bipolar disorder and suffered from a manic episode during the March incident.\n\u201cThis is not the outcome I hoped for, and not the outcome that reflects the severity of what happened,\u201d Bartlett Police officer Cameron Emmett said in a victim impact statement. \u201cA police officer being run down during the course of duty is not a minor incident.\u201d\nConover\u2019s YouTube channel showcases ultra-luxury listings across New York City, Aspen and Miami, among others.\nThe 36-year-old launched his internet fame as a travel vlogger, then\nventured into real estate\nafter collaborating on a listing video with Ryan Serhant in 2018. After obtaining his real estate license two years later, he joined Nest Seekers and received $100 million in listings from the firm\u2019s chief executive officer, Eddie Shapiro.\nConover is no longer licensed with Nest Seekers.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner",

        "content": "After the pandemic fueled an industrial building boom, developers are finding buyers for newly completed projects.\nThe development arm of Transwestern, known as Transwestern Development Company, last week sold a 255,000-square-foot distribution center in the Chicago suburbs to an Asian food wholesaler for $33.5 million, public records show. The sale price equates to $131 per square foot.\nThe buyer was JFC International, which is based in Los Angeles, according to the property\u2019s latest deed.\nThough total development costs are unclear, Houston-based Transwestern likely did well on the sale. The company bought the land for the property at 4101 Canterfield Parkway East in West Dundee for $2 million in 2022 and took out a $21 million construction loan from Comerica Bank shortly afterward, according to Kane County public records. No other loans have been publicly recorded against the property, which is known as the TDC I-90 Logistics Center.\nThe property likely benefits from Chicago\u2019s robust rail network as well as its proximity to O\u2019Hare International Airport. The distribution center is about 20 miles from O\u2019Hare and 40 miles from downtown Chicago.\nThough\nfears of oversupply in Chicago\u2019s industrial market\nwere percolating last year, by the halfway point of this year, absorption rates began to tell a different story.\nIn the second quarter, speculative industrial\ndevelopment overtook built-to-suit projects\nfor the first time since early 2024, according to NAI Hiffman.\nAt the same time, the region saw an absorption rate of 1 million square feet, indicating leasing activity is still outpacing vacancies, NAI Hiffman found. The region\u2019s vacancy rate has hovered between 5.5 percent and 6.5 percent since 2024.\nPending and recently completed sales indicate supply is still matching demand, even if activity has slowed somewhat since a pandemic-era peak.\nOn Chicago\u2019s Southwest side, local firm Bridge Industrial is under contract to buy Ford City Mall with a $150 million plan to demolish the 960,000-square-foot shopping center and\nreplace it with a four-building logistics complex\nspanning 913,000 square feet.\nExisting properties have been trading, as well.\nHouston-based Hines earlier this year\nbought a distribution center at 555 Saint James Gate\nin suburban Bolingbrook for $29.5 million, or about $73 per square foot. Seller TradeLane Properties had purchased the 404,000-square-foot facility in 2021 for $24.6 million.",

        "content": "The Quad, a newly redeveloped office and retail campus in Uptown Dallas, secured a $228.2 million refinancing.\nJLL Capital Markets represented Stream Realty Partners in arranging the five\u2011year senior loan, which replaces a prior $181 million construction loan for the site\u2019s redevelopment, the\nDallas Business Journal reported\n. An affiliate of New York\u2011based investment firm KKR provided the financing, with a deed of trust recorded Nov. 11 confirming the deal between KREF Capital, the real estate investment arm of KKR, and owner SRPF B Quadrangle Property, a unit of Stream Realty. The company has major holdings in\nHouston\nand\nAustin\n.\nOpened in May 2024, The Quad spans two office buildings and six standalone retail structures at 2828 Routh Street and 2699 Howell Street in Dallas. Its centerpiece is a 12\u2011story, 345,000\u2011square\u2011foot office tower that was about 80 percent leased as of September.\nTenants include M Financial Group, Revantage, Berkshire Residential, LDWW, Chicago Title and law firm Perkins Coie. The campus also features a renovated 500,000\u2011square\u2011foot legacy office building.\nBeyond office leasing, The Quad has a vibrant retail and dining scene. Michelin\u2011starred Mamani opened in September, joining Australian caf\u00e9 Two Hands, Korean\u2011Japanese restaurant Domodomo K\u014d, and Michelin\u2011recommended Written by the Seasons. Bread Club, an upscale bakery, is slated to open by year-end, while LDU Coffee launched its sixth Dallas site on the campus this summer. These establishments surround an acre of landscaped green space.\nStream Realty, run by CEO Chris Jackson, acquired the former Quadrangle in 2019 with the vision of transforming the aging site into a modern hub. Redevelopment began in 2022, backed by the original $181 million loan.\nThe refinancing signals lender confidence in urban office campuses, despite other challenges in the office market. The Quad has benefited from its position near other\ntrophy Uptown developments\nsuch as the 26\u2011story 23Springs. Although Uptown has emerged as a\ndowntown-like district\nfor Dallas tenants, it has managed to avoid the fate of legacy downtowns with their vacant office towers and dwindling foot traffic post-pandemic.\n\u2014\nJoel Russell",

        "content": "Core Investment Properties Fund and a partner bought a\nPublix\n-anchored shopping center in Plantation for $53 million.\nGrocery-anchored retail plazas are hot commodities in South Florida, as the asset class has proven resilient to e-commerce and other market headwinds.\nMiami-based Core and Miami Beach-based investor\nJames Resnick\npurchased the 184,300-square-foot Jacaranda Plaza at 8101-8373 West Sunrise Boulevard from Austin-based Epic Real Estate Partners and Chicago-based Heitman, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The buyers borrowed $34.5 million from U.S. Bank.\nThe price amounts to $288 per square foot.\nJacaranda Plaza consists of three one-story buildings completed in 1974 and 1999 on 16.2 acres, Vizzda records show. It was renovated in 2013.\nAside from Publix, the shopping center also is anchored by Ross Dress for Less. Other tenants include Five Below, Planet Fitness, Dollar Tree and nurse registry Value Care At Home.\nAn entity tied to Epic \u2013\u2013 led by Daniel Holland, Jason Maddox and Nick Tortorice \u2013\u2013 had paid $29.3 million for the plaza in 2016, Vizzda records show. In 2022, Epic and Heitman formed a joint venture through which Epic recapitalized five properties, including Jacaranda Plaza, according to a joint news release issued at the time.\nCore, a retail investment firm focused on Southeast markets, primarily Florida, owns and manages a portfolio of about 2.5 million square feet, its website shows. Led by Adam Greenberg and Michael Lapointe, Core has been a frequent investor in South Florida.\nIn August, Core and Spectrum Business Ventures sold the Aldi-anchored Palmetto Plaza at 15905-16341 Northwest 57th Avenue in Miami Gardens at a discount for\n$22.5 million\n. The buyer assumed the\n$22.5 million\nloan on the property, which Core and Spectrum had purchased for $33.6 million in 2020, records show.\nIn 2022, Core paid\n$44.8 million\nfor the Deerwood Town Center at 11905 Southwest 152nd Street and 12107 Southwest 152nd Street in Miami-Dade County\u2019s West Kendall neighborhood.\nResnick\u2019s investments include the Kendall Marketplace at 11531-11631 Southwest 88th Street in Kendall, which he bought for\n$32 million\nin 2022.\nIn other recent grocery-anchored sales, Boca Raton-based Carlyle Management and an entity managed by Edward Rutkovsky bought Royal Eagle Plaza at 9100-9190 Wiles Road in Coral Springs last month for\n$60.5 million\n. The center is anchored by Aldi, Hobby Lobby and Petco.\nSan Francisco-based Stockbridge Capital Group paid\n$118.4 million\nin September for the 150,600-square-foot retail portion of the Uptown Boca mixed-use development at\u00a0 20940 Uptown Avenue near Boca Raton. The plaza is anchored by Whole Foods Market.\n",

It was Los Angeles County\u2019s priciest listing last week, according to the\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n.\nThe weekly report, compiled by Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team, looks at new listings and signed contracts listed for $4 million or more in the Multiple Listing Service.\nThe Beverly Park mansion, located in a gated community where business titans and celebrities reside, sits just a few steps from 71 Beverly Park Lane, which\nParis Hilton\nand husband Carter Reum paid\n$63.1 million\nfor in June.\nThe latest neighborhood listing first went up for sale last May in hopes of nabbing nearly $90 million. It was taken off the market in March.\nThe speculative development is owned by Paradigm Developers\u2019 Todd DeMann, according to property and state records. Paradigm built the property with Harrison Design and Mike Moser Studio.\nThe developer dreamed up nearly every luxury, including a primary suite running about 5,000 square feet, screening room, two kitchens, home office, outdoor kitchen and fruit tree orchard.\nBuyers also have the option of snapping up the adjacent parcel, which has approved plans to build an equally expansive mansion of about 29,000 square feet at 74 Beverly Park Lane. Combined properties would span 4.5 acres.\nCompass\u2019 David Kramer and Carolwood Estates\u2019 Drew Fenton hold the listing.\nElsewhere last week, Eklund Gomes reported 705 Palisades Beach Road in Santa Monica as last week\u2019s top home to go into contract.\nThe nearly 4,000-square-foot residence has four bedrooms and five bathrooms with an asking price just under $16 million, or $3,991 per square foot.\nIt hit the market in late October and is listed by Pardee Properties\u2019 Colette Stevens.\nProperty and state records show the home is owned by a limited liability company, managed by Sherri Conn in Fort Worth, Texas. An individual of the same name and Texas address tracks to the CFO of family office Wildcat Partner Holdings and is also vice president of property management firm Tarrant Management.\nThe Santa Monica residence touts about 60 feet facing the beach, outdoor dining, a pool and elevator.\nIt also comes with a link to Hollywood history, with the home once owned by late actor and filmmaker Douglas Fairbanks. \u201cThe Mark of Zorro\u201d and \u201cRobin Hood\u201d actor established film production company United Artists with Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford and D.W. Griffith in 1919.\nMarket pulse\nOverall, last week\u2019s signed contract activity in the county showed a rebound from the past few weeks\u2019 doldrums.\nThe Eklund Gomes team reported 19 signed contracts equating to $143.3 million in volume. That\u2019s 10 more contracts and a spike of nearly 170 percent in volume compared to a year ago.\nForty-five homes were either listed or re-listed last week, which brought the market\u2019s total inventory to 1,204 properties, according to the\nEklund Gomes report\n.\nDespite the week-to-week swings, a measure of dealmaking in the third quarter showed the County\u2019s high end on the up.\nThird-quarter closings jumped 21 percent year-over-year to 497 trades for L.A. County properties listed in the MLS for $4 million or more, according to data compiled by Westside Estate Agency. Volume in that same period rose 25 percent from the year-ago period to $784.4 million.\n",

Bank of America provided the loan, Hotel Business\nreported\n.\nThe 300-key hotel project, which will be at 3737 Stadium Drive, is estimated to cost $450 million in total. It\u2019s the only permitted hotel in Kroenke\u2019s Hollywood Park mixed-use district surrounding SoFi Stadium, the Kia Forum and the Intuit Dome.\nWhen complete, the Kali Hotel will become a part of Marriott\u2019s luxury Autograph Collection. Construction\nkicked off last year\nand topped out in September; the project is expected to wrap up late next year.\nPlans for the development call for a rooftop dining space, spa and wellness facilities and 20,000 square feet of meeting space.\nThe Kali Hotel will be just one part of the Hollywood Park complex, expected to boast up to 4 million square feet of creative office space, roughly 900,000 square feet of retail space and up to 2,500 multifamily residences. Builder Clayco is handling construction of the hotel while Lamar Johnson Collaborative is acting as architect and Gensler is designing the interior. Kroenke\u2019s Kroenke Holdings is spearheading development in Hollywood Park with Wilson Meany working as development manager, and Clayco also building the forthcoming\nHollywood Park Studios\ndevelopment.\nThe 12-acre studio, poised for construction at the Hollywood Park retail village at 1001 Stadium Drive, would serve as a hub for the International Broadcast Center for the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games. After that, it would be available for entertainment production and operations. Plans for the project include five 18,000-square-foot soundstages and a three-story, 80,000-square-foot office building for support, production and postproduction facilities.\nThe Kali Hotel, like Hollywood Park Studios, is part of Kroenke\u2019s greater plan to create a contained community with multiple uses for visitors.\n\u201cThe vision for Hollywood Park has always been to build a city within a city combining media, entertainment and technology that will transform the greater Los Angeles area,\u201d the\nLos Angeles Rams\nowner\nsaid\nof the 300-acre development.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A newly formed tenants union\u2019s request for leniency from eviction was denied by Cook County Judge Debra Ann Seaton at a hearing on Monday.\nThe case involves residents of the apartment building at 7500 South Shore Drive, the site of a dramatic immigration raid in September. The tenants union requested $7,500 in relocation assistance and 60 additional days to vacate after the current deadline set for this Friday,\nBlock Club Chicago reported\n.\nSeaton denied the motions, siding with plaintiff Wells Fargo in its foreclosure case against property owner Trinity Flood.\nDespite Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s support for the tenants\u2019 requests, Seaton insisted residents had already been offered aid and emphasized the building\u2019s dangerous conditions, citing gas leaks, plumbing failures and reliance on portable heaters.\n\u201cIt would be inhumane for this court not to relocate people as quickly as possible,\u201d the Cook County judge said.\nSam Barth, an attorney representing the union, argued residents wanted to leave but could not secure leases on such short notice, warning that eviction risked homelessness. Seaton responded she was not making anyone homeless and criticized Barth\u2019s language as \u201ctriggering.\u201d Seaton ordered tenants to\nleave the building\nlast month.\nControl of the property had already been transferred to receiver Jared Friedman after Flood failed to address hazards. Friedman testified his company posted eviction notices and offered residents $5,000 in relocation payments \u2014 $2,500 upfront and $2,500 upon departure. Twelve tenants accepted, though organizers said the offers came with pressure to decide quickly.\nSeaton praised Friedman as an \u201cactively engaged receiver,\u201d dismissing union complaints that he avoided meeting with them.\nThe dramatic U.S. Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement raid took place in September, filmed by federal agents. It brought attention to conditions inside the building. A foreclosure lawsuit from Wells Fargo\nlaunched prior to the raid\n.\nThe incident raised legal questions\nfor landlords\nand put Neenah, Wisconsin-based Trinity Flood\nin a spotlight\n.\nAbout 30 residents remain members of the union in a building with 130 units. The union has decided to support tenants in accepting Friedman\u2019s offer, while supplementing assistance through its own fund.\nYet residents stressed that the money does little to solve the immediate crisis. Malfunctioning elevators, leases unavailable on short timelines and the sheer difficulty of moving in winter compound the challenge.\n\u201cFinding placement is the issue,\u201d said tenant leader Darren Hightower.\nFellow resident Raymond Corona lamented that despite following rules, he must relocate within days, hauling belongings through snow.\nOrganizers framed the plight as emblematic of the city\u2019s housing crisis, with some suggesting crowdfunding as a last resort.\nFriedman confirmed plans to lock the building Friday, promising scheduled access to retrieve\u00a0 belongings.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

One\nproposal calls for 1,800 apartments\nat the 3.6-acre Safeway site in the Fillmore District; another outlines 366 homes at the Bernal Heights Safeway location, as well as 532 units at the Outer Richmond Safeway. Last week, Safeway and Align filed\nplans for 790 apartments\nat the Safeway site in the Marina District.\nThose aren\u2019t all the Safeways in the city that could be redeveloped into mixed-use properties, according to the Business Times. Safeway, headquartered across the Bay in\nPleasanton\n, also has stores on a 1.2-acre site at 735 7th Avenue in the Inner Richmond; another 1.2-acre site at 2350 Noriega Street in the Outer Sunset; and a 0.8-acre site at 625 Monterey Boulevard in Sunnyside. The company also owns a handful of small parcels making up part of the surface parking lot for its store at 2020 Market Street.\nWhether the grocer, which is part of Idaho-based Albertsons Companies, plans to pursue\nsimilar residential-above-grocery projects\nat those sites remains to be seen.\n\u201cSafeway is constantly evaluating locations to better serve the neighborhoods of which we are part and to provide customers with a convenient, modern shopping experience that meets their needs,\u201d the company told the Business Times regarding the redevelopment of other stores in the future.\nWith 3,488 units already planned, Align has largely reached its goal of putting 3,500 apartments into San Francisco\u2019s housing stock at a time when the city needs it. San Francisco is mandated by the state to build 82,069 new units by 2031 under its\nhousing element\n.

Angle did not immediately return a request for comment, and Pope declined to comment.\nAcross\nPalm Beach County\n, deal signing for luxury properties has been picking up after the Thanksgiving holiday. The priciest home that went into contract was for a 23,000-square-foot mansion at\n118 Bears Club Drive in Jupiter\n, which had an asking price of $44 million. The residence has seven bedrooms and nine and a half baths and sits on a 3-acre lot.In Palm Beach, the most expensive listing to hit the market this season is for an oceanfront estate at\n1491 North Ocean Boulevard\n. The price tag for the 14,500-square-foot property \u2014 once home to Aldo Gucci, son of Guccio Gucci \u2014 is $205 million, or $14,138 per square foot. Angle holds this listing as well.",

        "content": "New Yorkers who own real estate \u2014 even a single townhouse \u2014 might be headed over a cliff.\nI\u2019m talking about the estate tax.\nIf a New Yorker with a net worth of up to $7,717,500 dies in 2026, the first $7.35 million is\nnot taxed\nby the state. But if an estate is worth more than 5 percent above that exclusion threshold, the entire estate is taxed.\nTax professionals call that a cliff.\nNew York\u2019s estate tax rate starts at 3.06 percent and rises quickly, topping out at 16 percent for estates worth more than $17.25 million. People worth that much have likely done some estate planning, or at least thought about it.\nIt\u2019s New Yorkers who don\u2019t consider themselves wealthy, but who have had a home and a 401(k) for a while, who tend to be shocked when they realize how the state will tax what they leave behind.\nThe impact of going over the precipice is severe. At the edge of the cliff, a $7,717,500 estate would pay a tax of just $49,980 \u2014 only 0.6 percent. An estate worth $1 more than that is over the cliff and would pay $734,580 \u2014 a hefty 9.5 percent. The difference between those two tax bills is $684,600.\nFrom a policy perspective, how does it make any sense that dying with a single extra dollar would cost your heirs $684,600? Perhaps state lawmakers really want to motivate New Yorkers to reduce their net worth.\n(There is no federal estate tax cliff. Plus, the federal exemption amount is absurdly high. An individual who dies with $14 million pays no federal estate tax.)\nIf you live in an $8 million townhouse with no mortgage, avoiding the cliff will be difficult. You could sell or mortgage the house and give away some of the money, but be warned that non-charitable gifts made within three years of your death will be clawed back into your estate by Albany.\nAnother option is to donate your home to charity with a life estate, meaning you can keep living there until you die, at which point the charity gets it. This immediately removes the home from your estate and also provides an instant income tax deduction that can be carried forward as needed.\nDonating the house also guarantees that your heirs won\u2019t fight over it when you\u2019re gone. But that kind of thing\nnever happens\n, right?\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nIf COPA (Community Opportunity to Purchase Act) passes and nonprofits buy a bunch of apartment buildings, the buildings would no longer have to pay property taxes. Has anyone mentioned the potential impact of the bill on city revenue?\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The city does not allow buildings\u2019 lighting \u2014 such as that on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s new skyscraper at\n270 Park Avenue\n\u2014 to display advertising or company branding.\nElsewhere\u2026\nTwo landmarked buildings are close enough to Extell Development\u2019s project at 655 Madison Avenue to sell air rights to it: 781 and 790 Fifth Avenue.\nBut only 790 Fifth can do so, says PropertyScout CEO Wilson Parry, because 781 Fifth \u2014 the Sherry-Netherland co-op \u2014 is overbuilt. It has been there since 1927.\nBarnett is also getting 129,000 square feet of development rights in return for making improvements to the Fifth Avenue/59th Street subway station. Those improvements will benefit his building and the public at large.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$7.3 million\nfor a 2,488-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium at 50 West 66th Street in Lincoln Square.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$4.2 million\nfor a 13-unit apartment building at 2923 Frederick Douglass Boulevard in Central Harlem.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$27 million\nfor a 5,475-square-foot condominium unit at 157 West 57th Street in Midtown. Nile Lundgren of Serhant has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 64,675-square-foot, 74-unit project at 191 Canal/17 Cedar Street in Stapleton. Lester Katz filed the permit on behalf of Zeldy Roth.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

Newmark\u2019s Jordan Roeschlaub, Daniel Fromm and Sam Speciale arranged the debt.\nThe 16-story, 170-unit development opened in March, featuring one- to three-bedroom apartments.

        "content": "NorthPoint Development secured an $82.6 million refinancing backed by a four\u2011property industrial portfolio totaling 1.6 million square feet in South Chicago.\nThe debt, provided by New York Life Insurance, carries a maturity date of 2031,\nCommercial Property Executive reported\n. Kansas City-based NorthPoint originally purchased the properties from Greenfield Partners in 2017, financing the deal with a $69 million acquisition loan later assigned to Nationwide Insurance, which was set to mature last month.\nThe portfolio, completed in 2002 and 2003, spans 88.6 acres and includes four facilities, according to Yardi Matrix. They include: Commerce Park Building 1 at 2924 East 126th Street (384,000 square feet); Chicago Campus Building 2 at 12525 South Carondolet Avenue (247,000 square feet); Chicago Campus Building 3 at 12519 South Burley Avenue (460,417 square feet); and Chicago Campus Building 4 at 3400 East 126th Street, the largest at 547,200 square feet.\nThe properties feature clear heights of 28 to 30 feet, dock\u2011high doors, grade\u2011level access, single\u2011load configurations and ESFR sprinkler systems. Together, they provide more than 1,000 small\u2011vehicle parking spaces and more than 150 trailer positions.\nTenants include Flex\u2011N\u2011Gate, Dakkota Integrated Systems, Troy Design and Manufacturing and Ford Motor Company.\nSituated along the Calumet Corridor, the buildings are near Ford\u2019s historic Chicago assembly plant.\nThe loan follows another financing from New York Life. Earlier this year, NorthPoint acquired a 2.8 million\u2011square\u2011foot\nChicagoland portfolio\nin a $270 million deal, supported by a $178 million loan from the insurer, maturing in 2032.\nEven with\noversupply\nand economic slowdown, Chicagoland\u2019s industrial market has proven\u00a0 resilient. Sales volume surpassed $2 billion year\u2011to\u2011date through October, ranking seventh nationally and second in the Midwest behind Detroit, based on Yardi Matrix data. Average sale prices in the metro stood at $90 per square foot, well below the U.S. average of $136, making Chicago the second\u2011lowest nationally after Kansas City. Asking rents have held up\nas well\n.\nNorthPoint Development, founded by CEO Nathaniel Hagedorn in 2012, operates in the Chicago and\nNew York metro\nmarkets.",

The project is part of a city\u2011backed initiative to transform outdated office towers into residential units, with requirements that at least 30 percent of apartments be affordable.\nYet the landmark designation has sparked debate among preservationists, highlighting tensions between redevelopment and architectural heritage. The tower replaced Louis Sullivan and Dankmar Adler\u2019s Chicago Stock Exchange Building, demolished in 1972 in a move widely criticized and credited with galvanizing Chicago\u2019s preservation movement.\nChicago Sun-Times architecture critic Lee Bey called it \u201can ironic twist\u201d that landmark status is now being considered for what he described as a \u201cnondescript\u201d replacement. Designed by Thomas Stanley, the tower incorporates New Formalism elements such as vertical columns and granite cladding, but many view it as uninspired compared to Sullivan\u2019s ornate original. Chicago Architecture Center CEO Eleanor Gorski argued the case underscores the need for consistent preservation standards.\n\u201cWhen preservation rules appear either arbitrary or inflexible, it invites uncertainty, and uncertainty almost always undermines investment,\u201d she told CoStar News.\nGolub and Corebridge acquired the property through\nforeclosure\nin 2023 and aim to make it one of the first major Loop office\u2011to\u2011apartment conversions. A smaller\nprecedent exists\nat the building at 79 West Monroe Street, where eight floors are being converted into 117 apartments.\nGolub principal Lee Golub acknowledged the tragedy of Sullivan\u2019s building\u2019s demolition, which claimed the life of preservationist Richard Nickel, but emphasized the importance of reviving\nthe office district\n. Plans include new windows, building systems, outdoor amenities and the return of urban farming company Farm Zero.\n\u201cWe need to move forward, and 30 North LaSalle is a vital project in the rejuvenation of the LaSalle Street financial corridor,\u201d he said.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

By contrast, Austin\u2019s housing starts fell nearly 15 percent in 2025 to 14,620, representing a steep 40 percent decline from 2022 levels, with accompanying declines in\nhome values\nand\nmortgage activity\n.\nTogether, the San Antonio and Austin metros produced about 32,800 housing starts, making the region the third\u2011largest homebuilding market in the United States, trailing only in-state rivals Dallas\u2011Fort Worth and Houston.\nBryan Glasshagel of Zonda Advisory emphasized the disparity, noting that San Antonio now ranks sixth nationally on its own and remains one of the few major markets\nstill expanding\n.\n\u201cShould Austin continue to pull back, San Antonio is going to be the volume leader in the state,\u201d he said.\nGrowth in the San Antonio market has concentrated outside of the city limits and even beyond Loop 1604, with notable increases in suburban markets such as Converse, Elmendorf, Castroville and Adkins. That puts most of the growth in the\nsouthern\nand eastern suburbs of the city.\nThe strength of the market was further underscored by data from the San Antonio Board of Realtors. Despite an 11 percent decline in October home sales to 2,639 properties, the median price held steady at $305,000, and inventory stood at 6.04 months \u2014 conditions described as balanced by local brokers.\n\u201cWhile sales have slowed, steady pricing and strong inventory levels give both buyers and sellers more flexibility,\u201d Sabor Chairman Ed Zapata noted.\nThe current dynamic marks a reversal from 2022, when Austin significantly out\u2011built San Antonio.",

        "content": "At first glance, architects had a banner year this year.\nThe number of permits filed for many of the city\u2019s top architects doubled or even tripled from last year. The incumbent top architect, Nikolai Katz, had his filings explode to 61 this year from 15 last year.\nBut dig a little deeper, and the numbers show a different phenomenon \u2014 one that appears to be entirely driven by the city\u2019s affordable housing tax abatement, 485-x, which was rolled out in April 2024.\nThe abatement requires projects building over 99 units to pay construction workers the prevailing union wages, resulting in the complete elimination of large projects using the city\u2019s tax abatement program.\nInstead, there have been a series of smaller projects that allow developers to stay under 100 units \u2014 and lead to more permits for architects.\nFor example, Katz has five projects with more than one permit filed for work being done on the same block. Combining the total number of units of each set of permits would yield over 100 units every time.\nThe numbers back up what architects have described for much of the past year.\n\u201cPeople are looking for smaller deals \u2014 clients that used to build 500-unit buildings are now looking at 100-unit buildings or less,\u201d Ben Grunwald, JFA chief operating officer and partner,\ntold The Real Deal in May\n.\nAside from the impact of 485-x, 2025 showed an industry that is getting back to work. In the third quarter of this year, there were\npermits filed for 11,746 multifamily units\n, a 69 percent increase from the prior quarter and the highest total since the first quarter of 2022.\nRead below for more about the most active architects filing those permits. The 2025 ranking is based on the number of initial permit applications filed for new buildings and renovations and reflects the architect of record through Dec. 1 on projects of at least 10,000 square feet. The methodology differs from the one\nTRD\nuses for its\nannual rankings published during the spring\n.\nNikolai Katz | 61 applications | 2.4M sf\nNikolai Katz once again claimed the top spot as the city\u2019s most active architect. His business has continued to benefit from its orientation in the outer boroughs like Brooklyn and the Bronx, which have accounted for over 78 percent of the more than 5,800 units proposed under 485-x, according to data from the Real Estate Board of New York.\nIn the Bronx alone, Katz is responsible for 36 permits covering 2,352 proposed units, including a set of 99-unit buildings on Mt. Hope Place. Katz\u2019s one permit for a building with more than 99 units is at 30-17 12th Street in Astoria, Queens, where he is working on a nine-story building spanning over 98,000 square feet that will yield 124 units.\nLeandro Nils Dickson Architect | 32 applications | 1.2M sf\nFor the second straight year, Leandro Nils Dickson Architect secured second place on the list of most active architects.\nSimilar to Katz, the architect specializes in midsize projects in the outer boroughs. The largest project filing for the architect is a more-than 70,000 square foot project in the Bronx on Marion Avenue which is expected to yield 45 units. Steven Westreich of Westorchard Management is listed as the owner behind the applications.\nDXA Studio | 18 applications | 440K sf\nDXA Studio has its fingerprints on a number of high-end condo developments across the city, including Avdoo\u2019s 105-unit project called Bergen, but its filings as the architect of record this year are based in the outer stretches of Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens.\nIts one Manhattan-based filing is for a 54-unit development from Lipa Engel at 47 East 30th Street that will rise 21 stories and span roughly 36,000 square feet.\nNode Architecture | 17 applications | 577K sf\nFounded in 2010 by Jakov Saric and Radomir Delic, Node Architecture did not appear on the list of top architects at all last year when the firm had just five filings for a total proposed square footage of roughly 85,000.\nThis year, Node has a single project spanning more square feet than that, an 11-story mixed-used building in East Harlem spanning over 101,000 square feet. The project will yield 96 residences.\nNode\u2019s other major project is taking place on East 167th Street in the Bronx, and is split across two buildings, one of which will yield 98 residences and the other of which will yield 85 residences. The total combined square footage of the project will be almost 139,000 square feet.\nKao Hwa Lee Architects | 17 applications | 1.2M sf\nDespite not having a website, Kao Hwa Lee Architects has made its presence felt in the city with a number of projects over 50,000 square feet. The firm has also gotten in on the 99-unit boom with over 33 percent of its 17 filings for 99-unit buildings.\nThe largest of those is an 88,000-square-foot project in Williamsburg on North 8th Street which will rise 17 stories. The architect\u2019s smallest project by unit count is a 29-unit mixed-use building at 31 Church Avenue in Brooklyn, which will have commercial, residential and community space.\nJFA Architects &amp; Engineers | 17 applications | 1.3M sf\nJFA may be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the industry\u2019s pivot to multiple sub-100-unit projects. The firm submitted six separate applications for buildings under 100 units on 165th Street in Queens in July for a project that will in total deliver 591 units across over 450,000 square feet.\nThe firm also submitted applications for neighboring buildings in Long Island that would yield a combined 166 units spanning over 160,000 square feet.\nGerald Caliendo Architects | 16 applications | 285K sf\nGerald Caliendo Architects has the honor of being the representative with the smallest average project size on the list, with its 16 applications covering an average of just over 24,000 square feet.\nIts largest proposed project spans over 65,000 square feet in Kew Gardens, Queens, and would yield 57 residential units. The firm has also taken on a number of alterations this year.\nS. Wieder Architect | 15 applications | 946K sf\nS. Wieder Architect fell to eighth from third last year, despite filing five more applications this year. Its largest filings are for a pair of 99-unit buildings at 230 and 234 Clarkson Avenue in Prospect Lefferts Gardens for developers Shlomo Karpen and Louis Handler of Keren Star Management. The site had previously been marketed as able to hold a single project of more than 150,000 square feet, according to\nCrain\u2019s\n.\nBadaly Architects | 14 applications | 421K sf\nNima Badaly launched his eponymous firm in 1988, and works alongside his two sons, Shahin and Shakib, who serve as an engineer and architect, respectively.\nBronx-based Badaly Architects, launched by Nima Badaly in 1988, is loyal to its borough. Every one of the firm\u2019s applications is for projects in the Bronx. The largest is a 99-unit project at 2748 Jerome Avenue spanning almost 70,000 square feet.\nGensler | 11 applications | 2.4M sf\nGensler arguably has claim to the most renowned projects on this list, reflected by its millions of proposed square feet across just 11 applications.\nAll but one of the filings are for alterations, which speaks to how Gensler has also managed to corner the office-to-residential segment of the market. Its largest project involves converting roughly 760,000 square feet of office space at 750 Third Avenue into 680 apartments for SL Green Realty.\nGensler is also behind InterVest Capital Partners\u2019 571-unit conversion project at\n30 Broad Street\n, Vanbarton Group\u2019s 440-unit conversion project at\n6 East 43rd Street\nand Metro Loft and David Werner Real Estate Investments\u2019 464-unit conversion project at\n675 Third Avenue\n.",

        "content": "The Downtown Austin building that houses Shiner\u2019s Saloon is slated for demolition, according to paperwork approved by the city last week.\nThe property, with a three\u2011story, 13,254\u2011square\u2011foot building at the corner of West Fifth Street and Congress Avenue spans two parcels at 422 Congress Avenue and 101 West Fifth Street, both owned by Los Angeles\u2011based Karlin Real Estate, the\nAustin Business Journal reported\n. . While the site plan review has been completed, city records show that a formal demolition permit has not yet been issued.\nKarlin, which\nlisted the properties\nfor sale in late 2024, declined to comment, and Shiner\u2019s Saloon management could not be reached by the Business Journal.\nThe site\u2019s redevelopment potential is significant, though Karlin has not disclosed future plans. A portion of the 422 Congress Avenue property lies within a Capitol View Corridor, which imposes height restrictions to preserve views of the Texas Capitol. However, most of the land is outside the corridor, allowing for taller construction with a staggered design.\nCurrently, the Austin City Council has capped downtown tower heights at 350 feet under a\ntemporary measure\npassed in October. Developers can exceed this limit if they participate in the Downtown Density Bonus Program and secure city council approval.\nThe site has long been eyed for redevelopment. Merritt Development Group once proposed a $170 million, 36\u2011story AC by Marriott hotel with 340 rooms and a 5,500\u2011square\u2011foot restaurant, but withdrew from the project in 2024.\nThe properties also carry historical significance. They were part of Nate Paul\u2019s World Class Holdings\nportfolio\nbefore Karlin acquired them. Karlin has since redeveloped other World Class properties, notably transforming the former 3M campus in Northwest Austin into a 1.1 million\u2011square\u2011foot\nlife science campus\n.\nThe demolition marks the latest step in reshaping Austin\u2019s downtown landscape. With a prime location, flexible zoning potential and evolving height regulations, the site could become a major redevelopment project, though its future remains uncertain until Karlin or a new owner reveals concrete plans.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

        "content": "Tech CEO Jody Glidden paid $4.8 million last month for a new home in Biscayne Park, a small town that\u2019s sandwiched between Miami Shores and North Miami.\nGlidden, who is dating \u201cThe Real Housewives of Miami\u201d cast member Lisa Hochstein, bought the tropical modern home after selling his waterfront Hibiscus Island home\nfor $11.9 million\nlast year. But he\u2019s not planning to live in the house; instead, he said he will rent it out. And he\u2019s looking for more properties in the village that he can purchase and redevelop, he told\nThe Real Deal.\nHis purchase in Biscayne Park marks one of a handful of deals that have set records for the village, as wealthy buyers increasingly seek proximity to private schools like Miami Country Day School, which recently secured approval for a renovation/modernization of the campus, and the Cushman School.\n\u201cBrand-new construction modern houses are breaking barriers in these alternative neighborhoods,\u201d said luxury broker\nDora Puig\n, owner of Luxe Living Realty. Puig compared price growth in Biscayne Park to what happened in neighborhoods like\nMorningside\nand Belle Meade. She called it a testament to the demand for private schools, as parents don\u2019t want to spend hours in traffic.\nGlidden, founder of software companies Introhive and Postilize, picked up a canalfront home that spans nearly 6,000 square feet with six bedrooms and five and a half bathrooms on a half-acre lot. The price amounts to $800 per square foot.\n\u201cAreas like Biscayne Park still offer pretty good value. If you want to make a decent multiple on your property, it\u2019s harder to do now in other parts of [Miami],\u201d Glidden said.\nThe developer, a partnership with Aaron Butler of Avenue Real Estate and Kobi and Nancy Karp, paid $1.4 million for the lot in 2022. Butler, who also brokered the sale, said the proximity to Miami Country Day, the village\u2019s curb appeal and low crime rate attracted him to invest.\n\u201cI would develop [in Biscayne Park] again. We\u2019re looking,\u201d Butler said.\nAt least two other newly built houses have sold in recent months in the same price range as Glidden\u2019s purchase. The house had been sitting on the market, but because Glidden paid cash, the deal served as a catalyst for additional sales, creating a comparable deal that appraisers can use.\nButler said it\u2019s a \u201ctransitional time\u201d for the community.\nPuig recently brokered the $5.3 million sale of the four-bedroom, five-and-a-half-bathroom house at 967 Northeast 117th Street. The 4,355-square-foot house was built on a third of an acre. An affiliate of Pintos Residential, led by Rodrigo Pintos and Roberto Lopez, sold the property to an LLC managed by an attorney in late November.\nThe property previously sold for $450,000 in 2021.\nA month earlier, a couple paid $4.6 million for the 4,860-square-foot, six-bedroom and seven-and-a-half-bathroom house at 740 Northeast 120th Street. A developer LLC led by Daniel Jaramillo sold the newly built house, which also sits on a third-acre lot. Coldwell Banker\u2019s Juan Zuluaga represented the seller, and Andrea Tavella with Vella Real Estate brought the buyers.\nThe lot previously sold for $750,000 in 2022.\nMiami Country Day, one of the top private schools in South Florida, recently secured approval to revise its master plan to include more properties that the school owns and to raise the height of some planned buildings to three stories, instead of two, said Francisco Garcia of the Euclid Group. The land-use consulting firm is working on the expansion of Miami Country Day\u2019s upper and middle school campus. The project calls for a new dining center, improved traffic flow and green space.\nThe school also recently opened a $20 million fitness and wellness center.\n\u201cWithout question there is\nexceeding demand for educational facilities\nin Miami-Dade County, particularly in the private school sector,\u201d Garcia said, noting that while new buildings will be constructed, the school\u2019s enrollment capacity will remain the same.\n\u201c[Biscayne Park] really is in a fortunate geographic location,\u201d he added. \u201cTraffic is going to be an issue for us for the indefinite future.\u201d\n",

The property includes two buildings and totals 230,691 square feet of office space. The sale price was not disclosed.\nNewmark\u2019s Chris Murphy, Robert Hill, Gary Carr and Austin Sheahan represented the seller, Denver-based Northwood Investors. It purchased the property in 2010, deed records show.\nThe Offices at Park Lane were constructed in the 1970s, but were recently upgraded with a new conference center, tenant lounge, gaming area and furnished outdoor spaces, Newmark said. It was valued at $29.1 million for property tax purposes, appraisal data shows. The property is currently 66 percent leased and serves as corporate headquarters for Boka Powell, Curtainwall Design Consulting and Condon Tobin, according to the release.\nThe office buildings are part of\nThe Shops at Park Lane\n, a 33.5-acre mixed-use district off U.S. Highway 75 about eight miles north of Downtown Dallas. The district features 540,000 square feet of retail space, including a Whole Foods, and more than 570 multifamily units.\nBorra made news this summer when his firm\npicked up 112 acres\nin Celina. He plans to develop a mixed-use project at the site. He also made a similar purchase to Offices at Park Lane in September, when he bought the 10-story, 242,00-square-foot Corporate Point office tower in Las Colinas. It was built in 1981.\nCommercial deal flow is on the rise across the nation, as institutional capital thaws. In the third quarter of this year, investment sales were up 19 percent, year-over-year, Newmark said.\nSimilarly, the\nDallas-Fort Worth office market\nis slowly rebounding. Total vacancy inched down from 25.3 percent to 25 percent from the second quarter to the third quarter, according to a report from Partners Real Estate. The rate slid slightly from 25.1 percent to 25 percent between the third quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of this year. In addition, average office rents jumped 2.5 percent between the second and third quarters to $32.06 per square foot. Third quarter rents are up 4.8 percent, compared to the same period of last year, Partners said.\n",

The deal is expected to close early next year.\nThat\u2019s about half of the\n$566 million\nprice tag that seller Rockpoint Group paid for the Midtown East office tower in 2019, and adds to the list of deeply discounted office buildings that Werner\u2019s snapped up in recent years.\nThat includes the Hudson Yards-area office building at 440 Ninth Avenue he bought in August for\n$105 million\n(sellers Taconic Investment Partners and Nuveen Real Estate\n$269 million\nin 2018), the building at 205 East 42nd Street he and 601W Companies bought last month for about $300 per square foot and the tower at 675 Third Avenue he and Metro Loft Management bought in April for\n$100 million\n.\nA representative for Werner declined to comment, and a spokesperson for Rockpoint did not immediately respond to a request. A Newmark team led by Adam Spies and Adam Doneger negotiated the sale.\nBuilt in 1972, the property also known as One Dag stands at 885 Second Avenue near the United Nations Headquarters and has long been home to various consulates and permanent missions.\nThe 870,000-square-foot building is about 72 percent occupied, with Memorial Sloan Kettering, the United Nations and the Republic of Germany counting as its largest tenants.\n\u201cOne Dag is strategically positioned among several iconic Class A office assets boasting an average occupancy of 90 percent in the Midtown East market,\u201d reads a marketing memo from Newmark, which notes the building recently received more than $20 million in capital improvements.\nSimilar buildings in the area get average rents ranging from $80 to $90 per square foot, according to Newmark, which positions One Dag as \u201ca compelling relative discount in Midtown East.\u201d\nBoston-based Rockpoint Group financed its 2019 purchase of the building with a $430 million loan from Wells Fargo and Brookfield.\nThe purchase price then worked out to about $650 per square foot. Werner\u2019s deal pencils to roughly $310 per square foot.\nWerner, known for striking when property prices are low as well as for his quirky dealmaking style and penchant for flipping deals, has been converting some of his discounted office properties into residential apartments, and keeping others as commercial buildings.\nHis current buying spree started in about 2022, and he\u2019s since been\none of the busiest investors\nin Manhattan.\n",

        "content": "Scott Rechler is no stranger to enormous office-to-residential conversion projects in Manhattan. In the Financial District, however, the developer is trying something very different.\nRXR filed plans this week to convert part of 61 Broadway into housing, the New York Business Journal\nreported\n. The plans were submitted to the Department of Buildings on Monday.\nRather than transform the entirety of the 670,000-square-foot office property, RXR plans to redevelop only a single floor of the building. The ninth floor will spread 21 apartments across 20,000 square feet of residential space, along with a bike room and a lounge. CetraRuddy Architecture will design the space.\nThe developer did not return the publication\u2019s request for comment.\nRXR ran into trouble at 61 Broadway a couple of years ago. In December 2022, RXR\nwent into default\non the property when it stopped making payments on the loan, which it took out in 2019. The loan had a two-year initial term and three one-year extensions, reaching maturity default in May 2023.\nMonths later, JLL\nlisted for sale\na $240 million nonperforming loan on the troubled Financial District office building. RXR had agreed to hand the keys back through a deed in lieu of foreclosure if necessary, but never did so.\nAt that time, the office space was only 57 percent occupied. In 2019, flexible workspace provider\nKnotel leased\n60,000 square feet across four floors, but\nfiled for bankruptc\ny two years later.\nThe mini-project is a sharp contrast to another RXR conversion that could prove to be one of the biggest in New York City.\nRXR, Marc Holliday\u2019s SL Green and Marc Rowan\u2019s Apollo Global Management are planning to convert the 38-story office building at 5 Times Square\ninto up to 1,250 units of housing\n, mostly studios, of which 25 percent would be affordable.\nThe project is expected to get 467m, a property tax break earmarked for office-to-residential conversions where at least 25 percent of units are designated affordable; it would be eligible for a 90 percent exemption for 35 years if construction begins before June 2026.\nThis summer, Corebridge Institutional Investments\nprovided a $561 million loan\nfor the development.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner",

The site, which is vacant and has an agricultural land-use designation, spans 77.1 acres.\nThe master-planned Old Town Floridian would consist of 178 villas, 160 townhomes and 108 single-family homes, according to the filings. Site plans show the homes would surround the pair of existing lakes on the site.\nCDDs are quasi-governmental agencies installed to help pay for the construction and maintenance of roads, water and sewer pipes, sidewalks and other infrastructure at massive developments. Overseen by boards, which at first consist of representatives of the developer, CDDs issue bonds that are repaid by special assessments, initially paid for by the developer and then passed on to homebuyers.\nFlorida City commissioners approved the Old Town Floridian CDD in 2020, and Miami-Dade commissioners greenlit it in 2021, according to the CDD\u2019s February board meeting filing.\nCapital improvements for the district are expected to cost roughly $12 million, including $6.8 million for roads, $2.6 million for sanitary collection, nearly $2 million for water connections and $937,000 for stormwater management, the meeting filing shows. The CDD plans to finance this partly by issuing an $8.6 million bond.\nZamora is led by Rosa Zamora, the filing shows.\nDevelopers have used CDDs in Florida since the early 2000s primarily for sprawling suburban housing projects along the state\u2019s west coast. Lennar and D.R. Horton are among the homebuilders that use CDDs.\nThe financing structure has gained more traction in South Florida in recent years, amid a development boom in the tri-county region with large projects. Miami Worldcenter\u2019s master developers, Art Falcone and Nitin Motwani, in partnership with Los Angeles-based CIM Group, created a CDD for the $6 billion project that spans 10 blocks in downtown Miami. In 2017, the CDD sold\n$74.1 million\nin tax exempt bonds.\nIn 2023, Sunrise commissioners approved a Community Development District for Metropica, a planned 64-acre master-planned project at 1800 Northwest 136th Street in Sunrise with 3,300 residential high-rise units. Through the CDD, developer Joseph Kavana can issue up to\n$65 million\nin bonds for infrastructure improvements and services for a 50-acre portion of the site.\nAlso in Sunrise, the city approved the creation of the\nSolterra Community Development District\n, which would finance infrastructure for developers Armando Codina and Jim Carr\u2019s planned\n900-home\nproject at 7400 Northwest 24th Place.\n",

The property was owned by finance industry veteran and racehorse breeder Jed Cohen and his son Tim; the elder Cohen died in 2022, and the son is now selling the property. The family bought the property from oil giant Texaco in 2000 for $3.9 million when the company was operating wells on the site.\nSince the nearly $4 million purchase a quarter century ago, the Cohen family has invested more than $30 million into the property.\n\u201cTwenty-five years ago, we started and built this thing together,\u201d Tim said of purchasing the property with his father. \u201cIt just feels a little different now without him.\u201d\nA buyer would gain access to eight separate residences on the property ranging in size from about 900 square feet to 2,000 square feet. Tim Cohen lives with his family part-time in one white stucco home, and the other structures are used for staff. The property is zoned to allow the creation of another home of up to about 20,000 square feet.\nBesides being Cohen\u2019s residence and a popular\nfilming location\n, Rancho Temescal is a fully operational farm with various commercial portions. That includes about 600 acres of irrigated agricultural land, including lemon and avocado orchards as well as other crops. There are several equestrian facilities on site and an events venue used by the family in the past to host weddings and charity events.\nWhoever buys the property could also end up benefiting financially, as the Cohen family currently collects royalties from an oil drilling operation that still exists on the property. The oil and farm businesses are for sale with the ranch.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Monroe Capital provided a $190 million loan for the purchase. Eastdil Secured advised the seller and arranged the debt.\nThe sale marks another large-scale hospitality trade in a market finding its footing after years of uneven recovery. Tourism has roared back and revenues are healthy, but rising labor costs, high interest rates and climbing property taxes continue to squeeze profits.\nLocated at 300 West 44th Street, the InterContinental opened in 2010 as one of the corridor\u2019s few luxury offerings. The project\nreportedly\ncost $500 million to develop. The property operates under IHG Hotels and Resorts management, but that structure will shift under the new ownership. The hotel is expected to convert to an IHG franchise, with Highgate taking over management, sources said.\nThe deal appears to be the second-largest single hotel deal of 2025, behind Kam Sang Company\u2019s purchase of the\nEdition Clocktower Hotel\nin October for $235 million. The same month, a group of large institutional investors\nbought a portfolio\nof four Manhattan hotels for $489.8 million.\n\u201cAfter a couple of years of New York being in the doldrums,\u00a0 it\u2019s kind of amazing the comeback that the city has endured thus far,\u201d said Daniel Lesser of LW Hospitality Advisors. \u201cThe hotel business is really strong in New York, from a top-line perspective.

        "content": "The city has tapped Slate Property Group, Xenolith Partners and nonprofit Comunilife to build more than 600 affordable housing units in northern Manhattan.\nThe team submitted the\nwinning bid\nto develop 4095 Ninth Avenue, a long-vacant, city-owned site along the Harlem River in Inwood, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development announced Wednesday.\nThe project, dubbed La Ostra, is expected to include approximately 625 units, of which 224 will be for senior residents. The other 401 will be subject to HPD\u2019s Extremely Low &amp; Low-Income Affordability program, which calls for most units to be affordable to those earning, at most, 80 percent of the area median income. The apartments will be spread across two buildings, with one rising 15 floors and the other 25.\nUnit counts and affordability levels will be finalized when the project secures financing and the property is transferred to the development team.\nThe project will also include a marine science and STEM education center (operated by the Billion Oyster Project and BioBus) and an indoor-outdoor soccer field.\nThe plan is years in the making. The one-acre plot, which has sat vacant for the past seven years, was once home to a City Ice and Fuel warehouse and then served as a parking lot for Spectrum. The city originally only owned the waterfront portion of the site, but reached a deal with Spectrum\u2019s parent Charter Communications at the\nend of 2021\nto acquire the portion of the lot that has street access.\nThe\n2018 Inwood rezoning\nincluded plans to build more than 900 units of housing on city-owned sites, including the Ninth Street property, the Inwood Library and NYCHA\u2019s Dyckman Houses. A new library and 174 units of affordable housing opened in June 2024, but the city still needs to work with NYCHA residents before moving forward with a new building on the public housing site.\nThe Ninth Street project will include green technologies, including solar panels, water turbines, algae panels and a sand battery (which uses sand to\nstore heat\n), according to architect Fernando Villa, of Magnusson Architecture and Planning, which is designing the buildings.\nDavid Schwartz\u2019s Slate recently\nannounced\nthat it is teaming up with Evenhar Development to build a medical office and community facility property at 1578 Lexington Avenue for Mount Sinai. The company has also\nagreed\nto build 450 affordable housing units at a parking lot at 54-19 100th Street in Corona, as part of Steve Cohen\u2019s casino plan for Citi Field. That proposal is\nawaiting\nfinal approval from the state Gaming Commission.\nThe Ninth Street project was part of the Adams administration\u2019s pledge to advance 24 affordable housing projects in 2024 on city-owned sites. HPD\nreleased\na request for proposals for the site in October of that year. The winning bid\u2019s unit count is slightly higher than the 570 apartments estimated when the RFP was released.\nHPD Acting Commissioner Ahmed Tigani said in a statement that the project underscores that his agency is \u201cfocused on building not just units, but affordable homes and communities.\u201d\n",

The deal for the property at 111 Clarkson Avenue breaks down to $504,000 per unit. The sellers were developers Seth Brown and Richard Ludwig.\nThe Lawrence is a fully rent-regulated property, providing \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d with his biggest challenge since delivering a championship to the Bucks five years ago. The building was developed in 2018 under the\n421a tax abatement program\n.\nAmenities at the two-building complex include a virtual doorman, a landscaped roof deck, a fitness center and two community lounges. No units are available, according to\nStreetEasy\n, and rents have ranged from $2,000 to $4,500.\nThe sale was first reported by\nPincusCo\n. Antetokounmpo\u2019s agent and investment firm did not return Bisnow\u2019s requests for comment.\nOutside of the world of commercial real estate, Antetokounmpo has been\nthe subject of persistent rumors\nthat he could be leaving the troubled Bucks franchise to become a New York Knick. Reports over the summer suggested he would be interested in a trade to the Knicks and the injured star was recently reported to be mulling his future over with the Bucks\u2019 brass.\nBut the purchase could be little more than a business move for Antetokounmpo. He launched Build Your Legacy Ventures, a venture capital fund, last year, according to the\nSports Business Journal\n. One of the fund\u2019s first investments was to back Unrivaled, a women\u2019s basketball league that puts on games during the WNBA\u2019s offseason.\nAntetokounmpo\u2019s portfolio also includes an apartment building in a suburb of Milwaukee, which he purchased last month for $11.4 million.\nHe isn\u2019t the only baller with multifamily real estate interests in Brooklyn.

        "content": "As the opening of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\ngleaming glass-and-steel skyscraper\ndrew near, some Midtown office landlords and brokers were quietly bracing for a shake-up.\nThe 2.5 million-square-foot Foster + Partners-designed tower at 270 Park Avenue is designed to accommodate roughly 10,000 of JPMorgan\u2019s 24,000 New York employees. Across the street is another building the bank owns, paving the way for what some have\ndescribed\nas a JPMorgan-centric neighborhood.\nWhen CEO Jamie Dimon cut the ribbon in October on the bank\u2019s new multibillion-dollar headquarters, it marked the start of a major migration from the company\u2019s other Midtown offices. The financial powerhouse has occupied several prime Manhattan buildings through long-term leases, leaving some to wonder whether they would vacate those properties once the new headquarters was complete.\nBut despite the grand opening, the Manhattan office market is not yet feeling any ripple effects. Rather than shrinking, JPMorgan is doubling down on some leases as it undertakes a $1 billion renovation of 383 Madison Avenue, the former Bear Stearns building across the street from its new headquarters that it\nbought in 2008\n.\nThe bank just inked a 60,000-square-foot sublease at nearby 390 Madison, boosting its presence there to nearly 500,000 square feet. Elsewhere, it signed a multi-year renewal on its 270,000-square-foot lease at\n237 Park Avenue\n, a win for co-owners RXR Realty and Walton Street Capital. JPMorgan has also extended its 123,000-square-foot lease at Brookfield\u2019s 5 Manhattan West through 2031, retaining a Hudson Yards foothold.\n\u201cWe continue to maintain significant space at our locations across Midtown as we fully renovate 383 Madison over the next several years,\u201d a JPMorgan Chase spokesperson said.\nOffice landlords may eventually feel the pain from the JPMorgan reshuffle. Renovations at 383 Madison are expected to finish in 2027, and the expiration of the 390 Madison sublease remains unclear. Landlord L&amp;L declined to comment on the deal, first reported by New York Business Journal.\nMeanwhile, landlords with expiring leases seem to be benefitting from the hot Class A office market. At Stahl Organization\u2019s\n277 Park Avenue\n, where JPMorgan occupies nearly half of the 1.9 million-square-foot building, it renewed 360,000 square feet in late 2024. Two other JP Morgan leases come due in the next few years. A 639,000-square-foot lease expires in March 2026 and a 175,000-square-foot lease expires in March 2028.\nThe landlord is in talks on both with \u201ctop echelon tenants at record-setting rents,\u201d a Stahl Organization spokesperson said.\n\u201cWe have signed leases, leases out, and deals pending for all of Chase\u2019s 2026 expirations. We have lots of inquiries and serious interest for their 2028 expirations,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nNearby, several buildings stand to be renovated to further cement the bank\u2019s \u201ccity within a city.\u201d The firm is weighing options for\n250 Park Avenue\n, an office building purchased last year for over $300 million, which could remain as-is, be redeveloped into a new office tower or converted into a hotel for employees. Plans for another office building at 410 Madison, acquired during the pandemic as a project office for the new headquarters, are also still undecided, according to Bloomberg.\nThe bank isn\u2019t holding on to all of its office properties. JPMorgan Asset Management is\nlooking to sell\na Plaza District office building for $270 million \u2014 roughly half of what it was asking for right before the pandemic hit five years ago.\n",

        "content": "The real estate industry rallied around frontrunner Eileen Higgins in the Miami mayoral runoff, and it paid off.\nThe ex-Miami-Dade County Commissioner defeated Emilio Gonzalez, a former city manager, by an 18-point margin on Tuesday.\nHiggins\nnabbed 59 percent of the vote compared to 41 percent for Gonzalez, who entered the runoff facing an uphill battle.\nIn the Nov. 4 city election, Higgins took first place in a crowded field of 13 candidates with 36 percent of the vote, while Gonzalez won nearly 20 percent. Because no candidate reached more than 50 percent of the vote, it triggered Tuesday\u2019s runoff.\nThe contest between Higgins and Gonzalez took on a heavily partisan tone, even though Miami local elections are non-partisan.\nGonzalez received endorsements from just about every prominent Floridian Republican politician, including President\nDonald Trump\n, whose primary residence is at his Palm Beach private club Mar-a-Lago.\nMeanwhile, the national and Florida Democratic parties invested heavily in advertising and mailers for Higgins, who also scored endorsements from famous Democrats like former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg.\nHiggins\u2019 win makes her Miami\u2019s first female mayor and the first Democrat elected to the position in more than two decades.\nHiggins rakes in real estate donations\nOn the campaign trail,\nHiggins\nand Gonzalez both promised to fix the city\u2019s permitting process, which small business owners and major developers have complained is cumbersome and causes delays for construction timelines.\nBoth candidates also touted plans to tackle housing affordability. Gonzalez backed eliminating property taxes on homesteaded properties, while Higgins promoted her record at Miami-Dade County approving projects with nearly 7,000 affordable and workforce housing units.\nHowever, Higgins scored more support from bigwig real estate players than Gonzalez.\nHiggins racked up nearly 10 times more campaign donations from real estate professionals, corporations and land use attorneys than Gonzalez, according to finance reports for their campaigns after the Nov. 4 elections.\nHiggins also likely nabbed hundreds of thousands of dollars in real estate donations to her political action committee, Ethical Leadership for Miami, which doesn\u2019t have to file its next financial report until January.\nLast month, Miami-based land use law firm Bercow Radell Fernandez Larkin &amp; Tapanes co-hosted a fundraiser for Higgins at Brightline Station in downtown Miami. Other heavy hitters on the invite included Jose Gonzalez, executive vice-president of Florida East Coast Industries, Brightline\u2019s parent company; Nelson Stabile, principal of Integra Investments; Jonathan Raiffe, CEO of Adler Properties; and Sara Adler, principal of Adler Properties.\nAttendees were asked to donate the maximum $1,000 allowed by state law to Higgins\u2019 individual campaign, or \u201cunlimited funds\u201d to Ethical Leadership for Miami. Under state law, no limit exists on how much money PACs can receive from a single donor.\nFinance reports for Higgins\u2019 individual campaign show she received the maximum $1,000 each from 14 developers, real estate corporations and land use attorneys, including Berkowitz Development Group\u2019s Jeff Berkowitz and his wife Yolanda, Swerdlow Group Chief Strategy Officer Michael Liu, Rilea Group and zoning lawyers Iris Escarra and Melissa Tapanes Llahues. In addition, three affiliates of Integra donated a combined $3,000 and six entities with the same address as Adler kicked in a combined $6,000.\nGonzalez received the $1,000 maximum from 11 real estate professionals and organizations, including Cervera Real Estate\u2019s Alicia Cervera Lamadrid, Associated Builders &amp; Contractors and land use attorney Anthony De Yurre.\nOther commission race runoffs\nThe city of Miami also held a runoff for an open city commission seat that ended with a victory for real estate broker and Brickell restaurant Sexy Fish manager Rolando Escalona. His win ended the Carollo political dynasty in Miami.\nWith 53 percent of the vote, Escalona defeated Frank Carollo, brother of Joe Carollo, who gave up the city commission seat for an unsuccessful run for mayor in this year\u2019s election. Joe Carollo was elected in 2017 when term limits forced Frank Carollo to relinquish the seat after he held it for eight years.\nAmong those who showed up at Escalona\u2019s victory party to congratulate him was Bill Fuller, a Little Havana developer who, along with his business partner Martin Pinilla, won a $63 million judgment against Joe Carollo in 2023.\nIn Miami Beach, former city commission aide\nMonica Matteo-Salinas\nwon an open city commission seat with 71 percent of the vote, defeating lawyer Monique Pardo Pope. The pair were vying for a position vacated by\nKristen Rosen Gonzalez\n, who was narrowly defeated in the city\u2019s mayor\u2019s race by incumbent\nSteven Meiner\n.\nPardo Pope attacked her opponent\u2019s tenure as chairperson of the Miami Beach Community Development Corporation, an affordable housing nonprofit which faced allegations of financial mismanagement and poor living conditions for low income residents in its multifamily buildings, according to the Miami Herald.\nPope faced criticism for\nfailing to reveal to voters\nthat her late father was a Nazi-sympathizing, serial killer executed in 2012 for murdering nine people. After Miami-based filmmaker and local activist Billy Corben disclosed her father\u2019s notorious past and her social media posts idolizing him, Pope released a statement that \u201cI too am a victim in this.\u201d",

        "content": "Another Magnificent Mile office tower is on the brink of default, and set to drag its landlords, Abu Dhabi-based BlueFive Capital and Chicago-based\nGolub &amp; Co.\n, into further financial distress.\nTheir 28-story building at\n625 North Michigan Avenue\nhad its $50.6 million commercial mortgage-backed securities debt transferred to special servicing last month due to cash flow issues, with loan servicers noting it\u2019s on track for \u201cimminent default\u201d after the property\u2019s performance plunged far below underwriting, according to Morningstar Credit.\nOccupancy at the 290,000-square-foot office portion of the property fell to just under 64 percent this summer, down from 92 percent when the loan originated in 2019. Its net cash flow is off 43 percent from initial projections, and the debt service coverage ratio \u2014 the amount of building revenue compared to the cost of its debt service \u2014 fell to just 0.41 in the first quarter of this year, far below the 1.35 trigger for lender control, loan servicer notes collated by Morningstar show.\nGolub and BlueFive \u2014 the latter of which gained control of the property after its September absorption of Dubai-based Neo Capital \u2014 now face the risk of foreclosure on the loan, according to Morningstar.\nThe ownership structure has shifted over time. Golub and\nLos Angeles-based CIM Group\npreviously co-owned the building before CIM sold it to Neo for $72 million in 2019. Golub still holds a stake in the property, marking at least its second Mag Mile distress saga this year following an episode at the tower at\n444 North Michigan\n.\nThat 36-story building was seized by\nBlackstone\nearlier this year via a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. CIM was also a part-owner in that deal.\nAt the building at 625 North Michigan, the situation deteriorated after SS Research \u2014 formerly the largest tenant, occupying 6 percent of the gross leasable area \u2014 vacated in May. Despite the tower\u2019s average condition with no major maintenance flagged, its revenue has been too weak to keep up with loan obligations, lender commentary shows.\nThe building\u2019s lower four floors \u2014 which house the retail portion \u2014 are owned separately and have had their own issues. In 2024, investor Ben Ashkenazy surrendered that piece of the building to its lender to resolve a $61 million debt, as\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported. The deed-in-lieu of foreclosure wiped Ashkenazy\u2019s equity and further fragmented the property\u2019s ownership structure.\nThe problems at the tower at 625 North Michigan add to a growing list of distress cases on the once-vaunted Mag Mile shopping corridor. Nearby, the office tower at 500 North Michigan recently sold for only\n$5.1 million to Greenwich,\u00a0Connecticut-based Commonwealth Development Partners\n, which plans a residential conversion. The fire sale price was a fraction of its pre-pandemic value, which once supported a $94 million loan against the property taken out by its previous ownership.\nJust to the south on the Mag Mile, Louisville, Colorado-based Real Capital Solutions is in talks to buy the frazzled office building at\n401 North Michigan Avenue\n. It fell into trouble after its owner, Walton Street Capital, took on a $160 million debt from lender ING, and the property\u2019s value has since dropped, potentially below that figure.\nReal Capital is reportedly eyeing an offer of more than $130 million for the 748,000-square-foot building, but well less than the ING loan balance. The would-be buyer is a backup for Walton after the\nOlayan Group\n, a Saudi Arabian enterprise, expressed interest in the building at 401 North Michigan before backing out of a purchase.\nWhile BlueFive touted its September acquisition of Neo Capital as a strategic foothold in North American real estate, the distressed status of the tower at 625 North Michigan suggests a rough patch within its portfolio. The firm, which announced the integration of $650 million in Neo properties, did not respond to a request for comment. Golub declined to comment, and LNR Partners, the special servicer for the building at 625 North Michigan, didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nPresident\nDonald Trump appeared to criticize\nthe state of the Mag Mile real estate market this fall with a cryptic post to social media, though local real estate professionals pushed back against his narrative of bleak prospects. Retail tenants have begun expressing more interest and making moves into storefronts on Michigan Avenue over the past two years, bringing vacancy down from post-pandemic peaks.\nBut the office market remains a challenge in Chicago and across the U.S., as remote and hybrid work, along with elevated interest rates compared to pre-pandemic keep flummoxing landlords who face upcoming loan maturities.\nWhether the tower at 625 North Michigan becomes the next to trade at a deep discount \u2014 or heads into foreclosure \u2014 now rests with special servicers and an ownership group struggling to stop the bleeding.\n",

        "content": "General Motors\nis looking to bring its\nBay Area\noperations under one roof.\nThe Detroit-based automaker is reportedly exploring consolidating its various business operations in the region into one campus in Silicon Valley, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n, citing those familiar with the discussions.\nIf completed, GM\u2019s footprint would shrink to about 400,000 square feet in one location from more than 1 million square feet between eight to 10 properties. The six-building Tech Corners office complex in Sunnyvale is reportedly a top choice for the car manufacturer, which welcomed Walmart\u2019s e-commerce division as a tenant earlier this year.\nCurrently, GM has Bay Area offices in cities like San Francisco,\nMountain View\nand Palo Alto. With an approximately 400,000-square-foot wishlist, GM could move several thousand existing workers into its future singular office. The automaker has purportedly struggled to find subtenants for portions of its San Francisco offices.\nGM will have to act fast, as the office market in Silicon Valley has gotten tighter as more AI companies set up shop and workers migrate to the region for jobs. Office vacancy has fallen for four consecutive quarters while demand for high-quality office space has picked up. At the same time, no new buildings are under construction.\nSunnyvale\nin particular has become a hotspot for tech operations as AI, software and hardware companies snap up office and research and development spaces in the city, such as\nDatabricks\u2019 305,000-square-foot lease\nin downtown Sunnyvale in July. In Silicon Valley at large, AI companies now occupy more than 6 million square feet, per\nCBRE\ndata\ncited\nby the Business Times. GM has seemingly been looking to beef up its AI and advanced software work beyond its AI research team in Mountain View, recently hiring AI leaders from giants like Alphabet,\nMeta\nand Amazon.\nGM could sign a lease for a new space in the next two months, the Business Times reported. Several of its office leases expire between 2026 and 2028.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",
