        "content": "A development firm scored a $43.3 million construction loan for an apartment project near the Metrorail and Tri-Rail transfer station in Hialeah.\nThe deal comes amid a multifamily construction boom in Hialeah and near transit stops across South Florida. At the same time, an apartment supply overhang in the tri-county region has slowed leaseups.\nDevelopment Alliance plans the eight-story, 189-unit Nexus Leah on the 1.1-acre site at 1140 East 25th Street, according to a news release from Ocean Bank, which provided the financing. The project will include affordable units. Completion is expected in early 2028.\nJose Lopez and Jesse James Herrera were part of the Ocean Bank team that arranged the loan.\nDevelopment Alliance is led by Christian de Gale, Jack London and attorney Javier Zayas-Bazan, according to state corporate records. In 2024, they filed a notice to start demolition of the pair of buildings on the site with automotive and marine uses.\nAlso in Hialeah, Coral Gables-based MG Developer, led by Alirio and Diego Torrealba, is developing several projects under its Metro Parc brand.\nIt scored a\n$105 million\nconstruction loan in April for the 10-story, 347-unit Metro Parc South at 954 and 934 East 25th Street. Adjacent to the site, MG and New York-based Baron Property Group completed the pair of 10-story buildings with 559 apartments, combined, for their Metro Parc project.\nMG and Baron also are developing Metro Parc North with an\neight-story, 661-unit\nbuilding at 901 East 26th Street.\nMiami Lakes-based Prestige Companies has seized on Hialeah with projects including the three-story, 114-unit\nMarket Station North\ncomplex and a redevelopment of the Hialeah Park Racing &amp; Casino into\nFlamingo Village\n, with a 343-unit apartment complex and a charter school. The site is at 100 East 32nd Street.\nNear Hialeah, Adell Investments, led by Jorge and Julio Quintana, proposed last year the five-story, 108-unit\nHUB Palm Springs North\nbuilding at 17601 and 17775 Northwest 78th Avenue and 7750 Northwest 178th Street. The site is in unincorporated Miami-Dade County.\nDevelopers jumped on South Florida\u2019s pandemic-era multifamily boom, defined by unprecedented demand and record rent growth, with plans for new projects. Amid hefty completions in recent years, the influx of out-of-staters slowed, prompting\nslower leaseups\n, an increase in concessions and a drop in rents.\u00a0Yet, developers starting apartment projects now say demand will catch up by the time they finish their buildings partly due to a\ndrop in construction starts\n.\n",

        "content": "Now that a federal bankruptcy judge approved an intramural battle between lenders on Oceanwide Plaza, creditors are facing a decision: Make their own or joint credit bids and try to finish the project or sell it off in hopes of recouping sunk costs, a person with knowledge of the matter told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe decision is imminent, the source said.\nThe project is estimated to require another $1 billion or more to complete.\nThe bankruptcy exit agreement recently\nreached\nover downtown Los Angeles\u2019 problem project clears the way for a potential deal. The latest framework appears to offer the two major creditors an avenue to either bid the debt they\u2019re owed in exchange for the property or sell for cash.\nBloomberg previously reported a potential investor is negotiating to buy the property, and the deal hinged on resolving the bankruptcy.\nUnder the latest agreement, LA Downtown Investment, funded via EB-5 investors, is entitled to a $230-million claim, and Lendlease, the one-time general contractor on the project, is in line for another of about $169 million. Other creditors, including one tied to Lendlease, are also in line for claims, per recent filings.\nThe mixed-use, two-million square foot development that sits opposite Crypto.com Arena near the LA Live entertainment hub, has been stalled for years since developer China Oceanwide ran out of money after putting more than a billion dollars into vision of a mixed-use megaproject with office, retail, hotel and residential components. The Beijing-based developer, which has since been delisted from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2024. Earlier, when the development stalled, China Oceanwide said it would\nneed another\n$1 billion to complete construction.\nNow the bankrupt developer is looking to sell the bedraggled asset off by making a presumptuous pitch about the priorities of the City of Los Angeles and its residents.\n\u201c\u201cA prompt sale and eventual completion of the project is a major priority for the city and the public at large, particularly with the upcoming 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles,\u201d lawyers for Oceanwide Plaza said a court filing last month, calling it a \u201chigh-profile civic issue\u201d for the city.\nThe settlement reached among creditors basically put an end to the millions of dollars being spent on lawyers while lenders sued each other. It outlined who got what and at what interest rate.\n\u201cThe settlement agreement puts an immediate stop to this value-destructive litigation, preserving estate assets and allowing the debtor to pivot from endless legal battles to the productive work of selling the project and confirming a plan,\u201d lawyers wrote.\nRepresentatives for LADI, Lendlease and Oceanwide did not immediately respond to a request for comment\n",

Prosecutors claim that the landlords improperly withheld security deposits, imposed rent increases beyond legal limits and charged excessive late fees.\nThe Pirians routinely kept most or all of tenants\u2019 security deposits after they moved out, according to Feldstein Soto\u2019s office. When tenants took issue with the withheld deposits, the landlords allegedly ignored them or told the former renters they would have to go to court to get their money back. The landlords also included a provision in their leases that allowed them to charge late fees equal to 10 percent of the base rent \u2014 an unenforceable penalty under the law, per the complaint.\nIn the height of the pandemic in 2020, Los Angeles implemented tenant protections including an\neviction moratorium\nand\nlimits on rent increases\n. The brothers were allegedly aware that the rent hikes they imposed on tenants were illegal, though the defendants reportedly told renters who complained not to tell others that the increases broke the law, prosecutors claim.\nThe Pirians are also accused of failing to pay required interest on security deposits held for one year or longer, discriminating against tenants based on the method used to receive housing subsidies, unlawfully passing off city fees to tenants and failing to provide legally required contact information for property owners and managers.\nFeldstein Soto\u2019s office is looking to get a court order to stop the alleged illegal activities, secure restitution for affected tenants and impose civil penalties on the landlords.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

CBRE\u2019s John Jaeger and Tom Svoboda are marketing the development site, while Michael Wilson and Christian Williams are handling the retail listing.\nCarlins told the publication that a new partner would not alter\nMagellan\u2019s long-standing vision\nfor a high-rise on the Columbus Drive parcel, known as Parcel O. The site is zoned for up to 574 apartments, 239 hotel rooms and more than 10,000 square feet of retail. Magellan and Hanwha struck a deal last year to bring U.K.-based Hoxton to the project for what would be its second Chicago hotel.\nParcel O is one of the last remaining development sites within the 28-acre Lakeshore East campus, built on a former nine-hole golf course east of the Loop. Since 2002, the master-planned community has reshaped the skyline, most notably with Jeanne Gang\u2019s 82-story\nAqua tower\nand 101-story\nSt. Regis Chicago\n.\nThe zoning predates the city\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance update, mandating that 20 percent of units in new projects be set aside at below-market rents. Only 33 new parking spaces would be required, with up to 329 spaces available through an easement in Aqua, according to CBRE.\nThe retail portion, known as Village Market, is 89 percent leased and anchored by a multilevel Mariano\u2019s grocery store. Other tenants include Avli on the Park, Eggy\u2019s Diner, Gordo\u2019s Tiny Taco Bar and MingHin Cuisine. The space has a weighted average lease term of roughly 4.5 years.\nMagellan has monetized portions of Lakeshore East before, including a $190.5 million sale of Aqua\u2019s apartment component in 2019.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The property, which is listed for $8.5 million, hit the market on Feb. 4 and went into contract Feb. 6, according to listing sites. The home was one of last week\u2019s top residences to go into contract, based on asking price, according to the Eklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles.\nThe weekly roundup, compiled by Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team, counts Los Angeles County properties listed for $4 million or more in the Multiple Listing Service.\nProperty records show Danault and Fortin bought the home in 2022 for just under $6 million and lived there while Danault played for the Kings. He left the team last year and made a return to the Montreal Canadiens, where he played between 2016 and 2021.\nThe asking price on the South Bay home, located in the American Martyrs district of\nManhattan Beach\n\u2019s Tree Section, pencils out to $1,971 per square foot. The roughly 10-block American Martyrs area gets its name from its proximity to the American Martyrs Church and School and is known for sizable lots, including some with ocean views.\nVista Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s June Emerson holds the listing.\nThe five-bedroom, five-bathroom home spans 4,312 square feet. It touts ocean views, a wine cellar, elevator, Tesla charger and parking for five vehicles.\nWhile the\nManhattan Beach\nproperty is headed for what could be a fast closing, it didn\u2019t top last week\u2019s list of homes to go into contract.\nThat designation went to 722 North Camden Drive in the Beverly Hills Flats. The seven-bed, 10-bath home is listed for $21 million, or $1,835 per square foot.\nProperty records indicate Vandad Zarrin and Nahid Chapchian are the owners. Zarrin owns VZ Construction Co., which built the Mediterranean-inspired home last year.\nRevel Real Estate\u2019s Ben Bacal holds the listing.\nThe home sits on an expansive lot of more than 15,000 square feet. Highlights of the home include a nearly 2,000-square-foot primary suite with its own sitting room and balcony. There\u2019s also a driveway made with Italian marble and each bedroom has its own bathroom. Prospective buyers also had the option of buying the home\u2019s Restoration Hardware furnishings.\nThe Flats property was one of 19 homes to go into contract last week, according to the\nEklund Gomes\nreport. That was good for $114.9 million in asking volume, which was off about 35 percent from the year-ago period.\n",

Even a 45-acre estate in St. Charles traded for $3 million in 2021, according to the publication.\nCompass\u2019 PK Johnson and Wes Ingold represented the sellers.\nMichael LaFido\nof the Luxe Group brought the buyer, who has not yet been identified in public records.\nBuilt in 1994, the six-bedroom main house is a revival of the\nPrairie Style\n, with stacked stone, a low-slung roofline and bands of warm wood against white interiors. Large windows overlook rolling pastureland. The property also includes a guest house, pool and pool house, a six-stall barn, indoor and outdoor riding arenas and a helicopter pad, according to the listing. The home is equipped with geothermal climate control.\nCummings and Bacola bought the 42-acre parcel containing the main house in 2010 for just under $2 million. Records don\u2019t show when they assembled the remaining acreage. They marketed the estate as a single offering or as two parcels \u2014 roughly 50 acres for just under $5 million and about 92 acres for $1.76 million \u2014 but the buyer opted for the full spread.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The average apartment rent dropped more in\nAustin\nin January than in any other major city in the country.\nDue to market saturation,\nAustin\u2019s average rent\nfell 4.8 percent in January, year-over-year, to $1,381, according to\nCoStar\n. That\u2019s the greatest decline among the 50 biggest metro areas in the country, surpassing runner-up Washington, D.C., by more than a percentage point. However, absorption rates suggest that demand may consume enough supply to level out the Austin multifamily market by the end of the year.\nRents have been falling in Austin for nearly two years, after a\nmultifamily building spree\nchased the swiftly rising demand for apartment living during the early 2020s. Between 2021 and 2023, average rent in Austin\nrose by more than 30 percent\n. Austin multifamily construction\npeaked in 2024\n, but oversupply continues to depress rents and force landlords to offer concessions that tenants in 2021 couldn\u2019t dream of getting.\nOther primary metropolitan areas in Texas also saw rent declines last month. In San Antonio, already the cheapest place to rent of the top 50 cities nationwide, rent dipped 3 percent in January to $1,076 per month, a 3.2 percent year-over-year decline, CoStar reported. Rent decreased by 2.1 percent in Fort Worth to $1,258 in January. Dallas and Houston had the flattest declines in Texas in January, with average rent decreasing by 1.9 percent and 1.8 percent year-over-year, respectively.\nIt\u2019s not an issue of demand, according to Grant Montgomery, national director of multifamily analytics at CoStar.\n\u201cIn Texas, demand is quite strong. Many of those markets are actually leaders both on absolute absorption of units, as well as the percentage of absorption,\u201d Montgomery said.\nIn the last quarter of 2025, Austin absorbed over 3,100 units, the fifth-largest level of any market in the United States, according to CoStar. Measured as a percentage of its total supply, Austin\u2019s absorption last quarter ranked second in the country at 1 percent, trailing only Charlotte.\nIn light of sustained demand, month-over-month data suggests that rents may soon reach the bottom of the curve. After 19 straight months of decline, Austin posted a marginal increase in rents in January, compared to December. San Antonio, Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston saw similar month-over-month increases.\n\u201cOne data point does not a trend make. [But] this is the first time it has turned positive on a month-over-month basis,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cBy the end of the year, Austin might get back to breakeven on a year-over-year rent basis, which would be a large accomplishment given the headwinds that it\u2019s faced over the last couple of years.\u201d\n",

A filing with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation pegs the cost of its buildout at $5.6 million, with construction slated to run from January through June. TDLR filings are preliminary, but offer an early look at tenant investment.\nUBS manages roughly $6.6 trillion in assets globally and already has a presence in Dallas-Fort Worth, including offices at The Crescent, Plano and Fort Worth.\nPrivate equity firm Stonelake Capital Partners is also relocating from The Crescent to\n23Springs\n, leasing about 16,000 square feet on the ninth floor. A confidential tenant signed for 22,099 square feet on the 10th floor, with occupancy expected in the third quarter, according to the publication.\nThe leases are notable in an office market still grappling with elevated vacancy. Paul Bennett, Granite\u2019s senior managing director, told the outlet that the tower\u2019s momentum reflects demand for top-tier buildings in prime locations. He added that several additional leases are in negotiations.\nLast year,\nDeloitte\nbegan building out its 112,000-square-foot office in 23Springs for a cost of $32 million. It is set to be completed this month.\nGranite broke ground after buying the Cedar Springs and Maple Avenue site in 2012 and demolishing existing structures in 2022. Bank OZK provided a\n$265 million construction loan\nfor the project. The building is jointly owned with Highwoods Properties, the North Carolina-based real estate investment trust that holds a 50 percent stake in 23Springs and Granite Park Six in Plano.\nOn the retail front, Australian-born restaurant Little Ruby\u2019s opened a freestanding restaurant at the project Feb. 2, joining \u00c9lephante and Torchy\u2019s Tacos.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "If your car\u2019s warning lights start flashing, do you take it in for repairs or keep driving until the brakes fail?\nLeila Bozorg keeps driving.\nBozorg, Mayor Zohran Mamdani\u2019s deputy mayor for housing, believes the state shouldn\u2019t amend 485x unless the crucial multifamily development law\nremains broken\nfor a while longer.\nHere\u2019s what\nThe City\nwrote last week:\nBozorg doesn\u2019t think the law needs any changes. \u201cIf you look at the history of 421a, there was slow uptake in early years and then it became a robust program that many used,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s too early to say that it has failed.\u201d\nPro-housing folks are optimistic about Bozorg. She just hired Andrew Fine from the YIMBY group Open New York as a senior adviser \u2014 one of several signs that she wants a lot more housing built. But her reasoning about the history of 421a needs a reality check.\nThe numbers simply don\u2019t tell the whole story of 421a, which preceded 485x as an essential tax break for developers to build mixed-income rental buildings in the city.\nThe last two times 421a expired, the state legislature made the new version less generous. So developers rushed to get their foundations in the ground before the expiration, then spent the next few years finishing the projects.\nOf course there was a pause before they embraced the new version.\nFirst, many developers didn\u2019t have the capacity to start a project with the new tax break while they still had holes in the ground under the old one.\nSecond, projects cannot compete on rents with simultaneous projects getting a more generous tax break. Projects that can\u2019t compete don\u2019t get built.\nFor the same reasons, 485x was destined to get off to a slow start, as Bozorg noted. Its terms are less generous than 421a\u2019s, and lots of 421a projects are under construction or soon to begin.\nBut the issues with 485x go beyond that. Its wage scale, which kicks in at 100 units and ramps up at 150, is\nshrinking\nprojects. That hasn\u2019t happened before. Developers\nwarned\nabout the\n99-unit problem\nas soon as 485x passed in 2024, and they have been proven right.\nProject filings show that developers are keeping projects\nunder 100 units\nto avoid the construction\nwage floor\nand the financial risks it presents.\nSome are splitting projects into two or three buildings, each with fewer than 100 units, but this is inefficient and raises costs \u2014 the opposite of what 485x is supposed to achieve.\nOther sites don\u2019t get developed at all because they can\u2019t accommodate two buildings and the economics don\u2019t work for a 99-unit project.\nLetting it fail for another two or three years is a bad idea. In a housing crisis rooted in a supply shortage, missing years of full production would be political malpractice. And there is no question that 485x is leaving thousands of units unbuilt.\nI don\u2019t mean to pin the blame on Bozorg. She works for Mamdani, who is aligned with construction unions just like his favorite villain Andrew Cuomo was. (As governor, Cuomo shut down 421a for 15 months at the behest of the unions before finally forcing them to make a deal.)\nBozorg believes developers will negotiate project-labor agreements with unions so they can do 485x projects without the high cost and risk of the wage floor. But that creates an obstacle for every 100-plus-unit project. Bozorg\u2019s job is to remove obstacles, not endorse them.\nThe city and state need to create a viable framework for developers to build as-of-right with as few bottlenecks as possible. Negotiating one PLA at a time is not the way to build our way out of the housing shortage.\nGary LaBarbera\nis the main reason lawmakers are hesitant to fix 485x. At one time, such projects didn\u2019t matter so much to the construction unions in his umbrella group, because they were busy enough building public infrastructure and Class A office towers. But things have changed.\nFirst, nonunion contractors learned how to build towers. And now infrastructure projects are stalling.\nDonald Trump \u2014 whom construction union members\nlargely voted for\n\u2014 is\nhalting infrastructure projects\nto get concessions from\nblue states\nor sanctuary cities, or because they are\nnot named after him\n. He also\nhates wind turbines\n.\nMeanwhile, not much office is going up.\nSo the unions want 100-plus-unit projects to themselves and will cling to the 485x wage scale even if it takes housing production down with it. State legislators and Gov. Kathy Hochul (all up for re-election) won\u2019t change the law this year, and Mamdani won\u2019t ask them to.\nHow many years will they wait?\n",

        "content": "Yay Yimby, nay bad landlords.\nOn Tuesday, back-to-back announcements delivered those two messages. The Mamdani administration released the dates for the five \u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings, and then appeared at a rally to celebrate Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s \u201cLet Them Build\u201d agenda, to support her proposal to reform the State Environmental Quality Review Act, or SEQRA.\nDuring the press conference, Mamdani lamented the years that environmental review can tack onto a project\u2019s timeline.\n\u201cTwo years just to get through the environmental review on the project,\u201d Mamdani said. \u201cAfter that, you don\u2019t even get to start building. That\u2019s just when the actual approval process can begin.\u201d\nHe went on to say that the governor\u2019s proposal \u2014\u00a0which would exempt certain housing projects of up to 500 units from environmental review \u2014\u00a0will allow the city to build more housing, which will drive down rents.\nWhile this was a welcome message for housing developers, property owners were reeling from another from the mayor.\nJust before this press conference, the mayor\nposted\na flyer on X that some have compared to a boxing match poster because of its declaration of the main attraction of the \u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings: \u201cNew Yorkers vs. Bad Landlords!\u201d\nNew York Apartment Association\u2019s Kenny Burgos, who\ncomplimented\nthe mayor\u2019s comments about housing development, said the hearings will be \u201call show and no substance.\u201d\n\u201cI think we are all exhausted of elected officials that are more focused on splashy events instead of actually making people\u2019s lives better,\u201d he said in a statement.\nThe dual announcements encapsulate the convergence of pro-housing development and pro-tenant policies.\nIn general, Yimby groups have increasingly\nincorporated\nmore pro-tenant policies into their legislative priorities. (Open New York supported 485x but also good cause eviction, for\u00a0instance, in 2024.)\nDoing so has perhaps helped make messaging around housing reform more palatable to those on the left. Over the last few years we\u2019ve seen progressive New York electeds support ramping up housing construction as the solution to the city\u2019s shortage, embracing a pro-development message without coming across as pro-developer, per se. Tuesday\u2019s rally showed that the trend has reached new heights. A Democratic Socialist provided full-throated support for a proposal aimed at quashing a key weapon against housing development in New York: Lawsuits seeking to undo rezonings or nullify project approvals based on allegations that the accompanying environmental review was illegitimate.\nWednesday\u2019s rally also showed the growing influence of pro-development groups like Open New York. Executive Director Annemarie Gray, who was the only speaker aside from Mamdani and Hochul, said SEQRA has been weaponized by wealthy Nimbys.\nReal estate often gets lumped into one big-bad villain, sometimes taking down with it policies that would benefit the greater pro-housing movement. The fact that SEQRA has such momentum signals a shift in that thinking when it comes to housing development. For property managers and owners, the conversation isn\u2019t centered on making their jobs easier, but cracking down on bad actors in their midst.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Wednesday was \u201ctin cup\u201d day in Albany. During an hours-long back and forth with state lawmakers, Mayor Zohran Mamdani gave two anecdotes about speaking to a millionaire New Yorker and meeting with a real estate leader. In the first, he said he spoke to a millionaire who claimed he would leave NYC if his taxes were raised. Mamdani said that when he told this person that the tax hike he is seeking is 2 percent \u2014 $20,000 for someone earning $1 million a year \u2014 the high-earner acknowledged that he would not leave.\nMamdani also said he met with a real estate leader who told him that much of the value of his company hinges on the work of City Hall. Who was the mystery millionaire and real estate leader? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Jonathan Miller, an appraiser reporters have on speed dial, will\nno longer\nauthor reports for Douglas Elliman after 32 years. He announced Wednesday that he and the brokerage are parting ways.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026.\n\u2014\u00a0During a joint legislative budget hearing on Wednesday, Sherif Soliman, director of the mayor\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, indicated that the administration is working on a bill to present to the state to reform the city\u2019s property tax system. Soliman said the proposal would build on the recommendations laid out in the 2021 report by the city\u2019s Advisory Commission on Property Tax Reform, on which he served as executive director. One such recommendation would be to eliminate assessed value growth caps.\nLast year\n, Mayor Eric Adams similarly told lawmakers that the city was working on a proposal to reform the city\u2019s property tax system.\n\u2014\u00a0Mamdani also provided an updated estimate of the city\u2019s budget deficit for the next two years. It\u2019s $7 billion instead of the initially announced $12 billion. The mayor said the projection adjustment was made after taking into account Wall Street bonuses and income tax revenues. The change, however, did not change the mayor\u2019s mind about raising taxes on the city\u2019s wealthiest and on corporations.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$24.8 million\nfor a 3,364-square-foot condominium unit at 15 Central Park West on the Upper West Side. Cathy Franklin, Alexis Bodenheimer and Shannon Suydam with Corcoran\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$24.1 million\nfor a 30,000-square-foot, 30- unit apartment building at 335 Carroll Street in Carroll Gardens. Mack Real Estate sold the property to GDC Properties.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$25 million\nfor a 2,156-square-foot, single-family house at 18 East 62nd Street in Lenox Hill.

The couple may be buying somewhere else on the island, but sources could not confirm where.\nThe Wall Street Journal broke news of\nthe purported contract\nfor 2 Indian Creek Island Road Monday evening. The purchase was said to be costing the Facebook founder between $150 million and $200 million and indicated that the longtime Palo Alto residents were ducking the Golden State ahead of its proposed 5 percent wealth tax.\nThe Cancros are not selling their home, according to broker Rena Kliot, who represented them in the purchase of the property in 2021.\nZuckerberg\u2019s possible purchase and relocation became the story of the week online and off. Many in the Miami real estate community touted it as proof of the Sunshine State\u2019s ascendancy and California\u2019s shortsighted policymaking.\nFlorida, and Miami in particular, has benefited from a significant wealth migration in recent years, including many tech billionaires.

Rollins\u2019 wife Marine Rollins, a real estate agent, did not respond to a request for comment about whether her home was the one that sold.\nBut many of the largest deals happen off-market.\n\u201cThere are several owners who have been quoting me these \u2018make-me-move\u2019 prices, ranging from $175 million on the lower end to upwards of $275 million,\u201d Joel Lusky of the Brokerage South Florida said.\nSources say football superstar Tom Brady\u2019s newly completed estate at 26 Indian Creek Island Road is quietly for sale in that price range.",

The 1.55-acre project site at 20955 Biscayne Boulevard is just south of the Broward County line, between\nAventura Mall\nand the Village at Gulfstream Park shopping center in Hallandale Beach.\nThe nine-story building will span 142,000 square feet, including 63,400 square feet of office. The rest is slated for retail, restaurant and fitness center uses. Jaxi Builders is the general contractor, and the development is already under construction.\nAventura paid $13 million for the property in 2020, acquiring it from a funeral service provider. The developer first submitted plans for the site in 2021, later revising them before moving forward.\nThe project adds new office and storefront space along a busy stretch of Biscayne Boulevard, in one of Northeast Miami-Dade\u2019s most active commercial corridors.\nThe retail vacancy rate in Miami-Dade County dropped to 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Colliers. That plus a slowing development pipeline has created demand for investors.\nThe biggest retail sale in the fourth quarter was Aventura Mall owners Turnberry Associates and Simon Property Group\u2019s\n$131 million purchase\nof the former Esplanade Aventura shopping center, at 19505 Biscayne Boulevard, which has been rebranded the Abbey at Aventura.\nRetail development hit a post-pandemic peak in South Florida last year, when construction completions outpaced starts. About 765,500 square feet of retail space is under construction in the fourth quarter across Miami-Dade, according to Colliers.\nMeanwhile, Aventura has a low office vacancy rate compared to the rest of the country, at 8.7 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Savill\u2019s. Office space is less expensive in the suburb, at an average of $54.35 per square foot, compared to averages of over $110 per square foot in Miami Beach and almost $89 per square foot in Brickell.\n\u2014 Rachel Stone",

        "content": "Graham Companies pitched plans for a 541-unit apartment complex in Miami Lakes, in a proposal that hasn\u2019t received full-throated endorsement from locals.\nThe family firm, which developed Miami Lakes and is a major landlord in the town, wants to build the complex on a site previously slated for a \u201csenior village\u201d and an assisted living facility.\nThe 22.2-acre lakefront development site is at Oak Lane and Commerce Way in Miami Lakes. Graham owns the property, records show.\nThe Town of Miami Lakes Planning and Zoning Board deferred voting Tuesday on a requested future land use map amendment and rezoning necessary for the project. The board will take up the items on March 10.\nThe proposal marks the latest iteration for a project on the site. Graham worked on a plan in 2010 for a senior village with age-restricted apartments and an assisted living facility with skilled nursing. That project fizzled out when\nMiami Jewish Health\n, a nonprofit with health care facilities for the elderly in South Florida, backed out of the partnership in 2019. Another health care partner eventually also opted out of collaborating.\nThe firm previously discontinued construction of an office building on a portion of the site after the pandemic unraveled the market, partly due to remote work.\nGraham president Luis Martinez framed its recent proposal as Graham putting Miami Lakes\u2019 needs first, avoiding over-development. The project would consist of three-story buildings fronting Commerce Way, and four- and five-story buildings on the rest of the site. Graham would contribute $1.3 million toward a town senior center.\nAlthough the firm could use the Live Local Act, which allows for high densities and heights as a way to incentivize affordable housing, Graham has no experience operating below market rentals and pointed out the law allows for property tax abatements, he told the board. Under Live Local, all units designated for households earning up to 80 percent of the area median income get a 100 percent tax break, and all units for households earning up to 120 percent of the AMI get a 75 percent break.\nThis \u201ccan hurt\u201d a municipality that has to collect taxes to continue \u201cthriving,\u201d Martinez told the board. If density is maximized, it would allow for 978 units, he said.\n\u201cWe sincerely wish we had been able to create the senior village. Unfortunately, we just could not make it happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThe two paths available are Live Local or the applications in front of you today.\u201d\nSome residents still weren\u2019t persuaded by Martinez\u2019s presentation.\n\u201cEverybody is furious \u2026\u00a0 because they already are overwhelmed with the traffic in this town,\u201d said Bonnie Cintron, adding that the site previously was rezoned for the senior village under the promise that zoning would revert back to industrial if the project fizzled. \u201cMaybe it was a boldfaced lie. I don\u2019t know. It seems to be.\u201d\nGraham traces its roots to milk, bottling and distribution company Graham Dairy, started in 1932 by the late Ernest R. Graham. His descendants have expanded the firm into real estate, including the development of the 3,000-acre master-planned Miami Lakes, according to Graham Companies\u2019 website. Prominent family members include the late Phil Graham, who was publisher and co-owner of The Washington Post, and the late Bob Graham, a politician.\nThe company is now led by CEO Stuart S. Wyllie.\nGraham also plans a\n220-unit\napartment complex on a site near its recently proposed project. In 2024, it paid\n$69 million\nfor the ground lease for the 448-unit Courtyards at Miami Lakes at 6431 Cow Pen Road in Miami Lakes.\n",

        "content": "The famous Casa Encantada estate in Bel Air is back on the market for nearly $100 million below its initial listing price as it remains at the center of an ongoing legal dispute.\nCasa Encantada at 10644 Bellagio Road is now for sale for $170 million, down from $190 million last year, the New York Post\nreported\n. The property\nlisted in 2023 for $250 million\nafter first\ngoing up for sale in 2019 for $225 million\n.\nThe home belonged to late telecommunications billionaire Gary Winnick, who purchased the estate in 2000 for a record $94 million. Since his death in 2023,\nhis widow Karen Winnick\nhas been fighting to keep the home as lender CIM Real Estate Credit LLC looks to foreclose on the property. CIM originated a loan in 2020 secured against the estate, and the debt has increased beyond $150 million.\nA foreclosure auction was scheduled for December 2025 but the home has still not sold and remains on the market. \u201cAt Karen Winnick\u2019s request, the California Court of Appeal granted a temporary stay of the foreclosure on Dec. 16, 2025. That temporary stay continues to be in effect as of now,\u201d a lawyer for Winnick told the Post.\nWinnick and\nher son\nAlexander claim they were left \u201ceffectively destitute\u201d by an alleged loan-to-own scheme against the mansion and other assets. Karen was reportedly unaware of the terms of the loan.\nCIM\n\u2019s recent filings in Los Angeles Super Court call for moving the legal dispute out of California, claiming the fight should be in New York due to unspecified provisions in the 2020 loan agreement and a personal guarantee signed by Karen Winnick. The lender argues that she personally signed the guarantee and later executed multiple amendments and advance requests tied to the debt. CIM believes Winnick\u2019s connection to these documents disproves the idea that she was unaware of the debt structure.\nCasa Encantada\n\u2019s 28,725-square-foot main residence consists of seven bedrooms and 20 bathrooms. The estate has been home to billionaires in the past, including Conrad Hilton and David Murdock. The property also features a walnut-paneled library, hand-lacquered dining room walls, two formal salons and a bar for guests. Outside, rose gardens, orchards and rolling lawns surround the manse with a 60-foot tiled pool and a tennis pavilion.\nCourt hearings regarding the loan dispute are scheduled throughout the spring, including debates over whether the case should remain in Los Angeles and whether key claims can survive at all. A breach-of-contract lawsuit has also been initiated in New York.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Winnetka Park District officials are considering scrapping an agreement with billionaire Justin Ishbia for a $3 million donation for park improvements after an outcry from residents over design plans.\nThe\nWinnetka Park Board\n, a separate body from the village government, last week approved a scaled-back version of a plan to install fencing on Centennial Park beach for an off-leash dog beach. Residents and village zoning officials had questioned the initial fence plans.\nThe new proposal violates the terms of a $3 million donation agreement reached in 2024 with the Ishbia Family Foundation. Commissioners also voted to revisit that agreement and potentially terminate it once they receive permits for the new plan. Ishbia, a founding partner of Shore Capital Partners and co-owner of the Phoenix Suns, is building a megamansion on his property directly south of the park.\nThe controversy is the latest in a\nstring of feuds\nspurred by Ishbia\u2019s goals for his 68,000-square-foot mansion spanning three lakefront lots. Ishbia, whose wealth Forbes pegs at $5.8 billion, has been engaged in controversial back-and-forth with the village and residents over privacy barriers at his property and a proposed land swap that would have extended his property into part of Centennial Park.\nA spokesperson for Ishbia said he declined to comment. The Winnetka Park District did not return a request for comment.\nThe\n$3 million Ishiba donation\nis contingent on a number of improvements, including a fenced-off dog beach at the border between the park and his property, and a pier extending into the lake.\nResidents argued the initial fence plan, which called for fences extending into the water on the north and south ends of Centennial Park beach, was intended to secure privacy for Ishbia\u2019s home to the south by limiting navigation of the shoreline. The village\u2019s Plan Commission rejected the proposal in a Jan. 28 meeting, citing the barriers the fencing would present to residents traversing the beach.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not hard to understand that only one person benefits from a fenced-in dog beach directly north of the property,\u201d resident Peggy Martay told the Plan Commission at that meeting.\nCommenters also argued the plan violated the public trust doctrine, an Illinois legal principle that requires submerged land to be open to the public.\nPark officials have denied that the project is intended to enhance privacy for Ishbia.\nIn an email to\nThe Real Deal,\nWinnetka Park District Executive Director Shannon Nazzal said the new plan does not eliminate public access and is intended \u201cto safely define a designated off-leash area while maintaining lawful public access.\u201d\nDuring the meeting last Thursday, commissioner Christina Codo said the elements required by Ishbia\u2019s donation were good for the general public.\nThe elements include \u201cpublic access, which we should all want, the dog beach \u2026 the dog beach fence, which seems to be a necessary safety feature, the ADA access pathway, which seems to be really important for this community as we all age,\u201d Codo said.\nThe new proposal to install the fence on existing steel groins that extend out to the lake addresses the access concerns, said Director of Parks and Maintenance Costa Kutulas at the Thursday meeting. It also reduces the length of the dog beach from 490 feet to 265 feet and is designed to allow beachgoers to walk around the dog park entirely.\nThe design mounts the fence on the steel wall to use \u201can already existing barrier in the lake instead of creating new barriers by installing new fencing,\u201d Kutulas said.\nBut residents said during the Park Board\u2019s meeting last Thursday that the new proposal still limits the ability to walk along the beach.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all designed to exclude people from that staircase,\u201d resident Ted Wynnychenko told the board, referring to a staircase on the breakwater at the edge of Ishbia\u2019s property. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that we\u2019ve gone back to that.\u201d\nVillage commissions will review the new plans in upcoming meetings, and the Village Board of Trustees has the final decision over approving a special use permit for the project.\nThe fight over the dog beach is just the latest chapter, as Ishbia has pursued building his lakefront mansion since 2020, spending an estimated $77 million on land and construction.\nIn 2020, the park district\nagreed to a land swap\nthat would have traded a portion of Centennial Park for Ishbia\u2019s property at 261 Sheridan Road, which sits between Centennial Park and Elder Park. That proposal, which was intended to unite the two parks, spurred a lawsuit that ended in a settlement, with the park district agreeing not to hand over the land.\nIshbia also initially planned to build walls along the stone breakwater at the edge of his property, but the plan was scrapped after public criticism that the walls obstructed the view of the lake.\n",

        "content": "Two suburban Chicago apartment properties sold for a combined $80 million last week to separate buyers as the region\u2019s multifamily hot streak continues.\nTaken together, they underscore the rising confidence of buyers from both out of state and local shops as a depressed development pipeline gives landlords the ability to raise rents at close to nation-leading rates across the Chicago area.\nIn the larger of the two transactions, Summit, New Jersey-based Solomon Organization bought The Orion59 Apartments from Manhattan Beach, California-based Orion Residential for $43 million, public records show.\nThe sale of the sprawling 224-unit, multi-building complex built in 1971 came out to about $191,000 per unit, likely marking a win for Orion. The company led by Marc Venegas and Mark Limpert first bought the apartments in 2018 for $26 million.\nOrion originally bought the Naperville apartments at 30W041 Flamenco Court in a portfolio purchase of over 1,700 units across the Chicago suburbs from Dallas-based Lone Star Funds.\nIn November,\nMarquette Companies bought another apartment complex in the same Orion portfolio\n. Naperville-based Marquette bought the 198-unit Arlington Lakes Apartments for $46 million, which came out to just over $232,000 per unit.\nThe other two Chicagoland properties in Orion\u2019s portfolio haven\u2019t yet sold. They are Orion Parkview, a 512-unit property at 1821 W. Golf Road in Mount Prospect and Orion Prospect, a 783-unit complex at 475 W. Enterprise Drive in Mount Prospect. The portfolio was originally listed in 2022.\nMeanwhile, over in Westmont, developer Holladay Properties offloaded The Quincy Station Apartments in a $37 million sale to\nBanner Real Estate Group\n, according to public records.\nThough it\u2019s unclear how much the South Bend, Indiana-based developer poured into the development in total, the company took out a $22.5 million construction mortgage from Hinsdale Bank &amp; Trust to fund the project in 2020 and refinanced the property upon completion for $27 million with a mortgage from Old National Bank, records show.\nChicago-based Banner Real Estate Group bought the 94-unit Quincy Station apartments at 1 Quincy Street in Westmont for roughly $393,000 per unit but the presence of ground floor retail spaces skews per-unit cost estimates.\nThe two suburban apartment sales come as more than\n1,700 multifamily units in the Chicago suburbs\ntraded in the last few weeks.\nThose sales were:\nOsso Capital\u2019s $110 million sale of the 730-unit Woodland of Crest Hill Apartments in Crest Hill to Bayshore Capital Partners.\nMark Manda\u2019s\n$51 million sale of the 378-unit Wheeling property\nformerly known as VIP Apartments to FPA Multifamily, which rebranded the property to ReNew Lake Arlington.\nThe Hispanic Housing Development Corporation\u2019s $31.4 million sale of the 200-unit Arrowhead Apartments in Arlington Heights to Artisan Capital Group.\nAmeritus\u2019 sale of the 248-unit Fox Pointe Apartments in Aurora to Palatine Capital Partners for $40.1 million.\nlocal investor Daniel Kotcher\u2019s sale of 226-unit Carriage Creek Apartments in Richton Park to Bender Companies for $11.9 million.\nThough sales activity in the city of Chicago has been slower, developers still recently notched a win with a\nsale of 73 East Lake Street\n.\nM&amp;R Development, which completed the building in 2014 in partnership with UBS Realty Investment, sold the 42-story, 322-unit apartment tower in the Loop to a joint venture of Magellan and Intercontinental Real Estate for $126 million.\nThe sale was the biggest multifamily transaction in the Chicago region so far this year.\nThe area\u2019s multifamily market has been performing well because of a\nhistoric low supply of new units\nhitting the market and the region\u2019s strong fundamentals like its job market and room for rent growth. Some investors\nprefer the outer suburbs\n, however, due to their\nmore predictable property tax environments.\nThe issue has drawn attention to Cook County\u2019s Property Tax Assessor\u2019s race, which is heating up ahead of\na contentious Democratic Primary next month\n.\n",

The most expensive residential listing on the market as of early this month is a\nPresidio Heights estate\nat 3199 Jackson Avenue listed for $32 million. Condominiums are also seeing price increases across the city, with two-bedroom units reaching a median price of $1.3 million last month.\nLow housing inventory combined with increasing demand is fueling the increase in prices and ongoing\nhousing shortage, especially at the higher end of the market\n. As of the beginning of February, only 651 homes were on the market or soon to be listed, down 27 percent year-over-year and the lowest number in more than four years. The number of new listings also dropped 19 percent last month compared with a year prior. About 30 percent of the listings were single-family homes, 60 percent were condominiums, and about 10 percent were tenancy-in-common homes or co-ops.\nSo far this year, San Francisco has had so few houses available for sale that Napa County, with 16 percent of the city\u2019s population, has more homes on the market than San Francisco, according to Compass. The diminished inventory and rising demand for living space is expected to drive prices even higher this year.\nThe influx of tech and artificial intelligence workers into the city in recent years has\ncaused a shortage of mansions\nat the higher end of the market. Renters also face increasing headwinds as AI companies continue to grow in the city,\npushing up rent prices\nas tenants fight for limited supply across the city.\nBut not everyone points to the AI boom as the reason for an uptick in activity.\n\u201cWhile national home price appreciation is stuttering to a halt and many states and regions are seeing price declines, San Francisco\u2019s median home sales prices continue to surge higher, a dynamic we expect to see continue in 2026,\u201d Compass chief market analyst Patrick Carlisle said, naming the \u201cunderlying factors\u201d as \u201can extremely inadequate supply of homes for sale [versus] rapidly increasing demand due to the\n[artificial intelligence] startup boom\n.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The developers of Colony Ridge, a sprawling master-planned community north of Houston, will pay $68 million and temporarily stop expanding under a settlement with the federal government.\nThe agreement, filed Tuesday in federal court, resolves a\n2023 lawsuit\nby the U.S. Department of Justice and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau alleging the project\u2019s owners targeted Hispanic buyers with deceptive advertising and predatory, seller-financed mortgages, Houston Public Media\nreported\n.\nFederal investigators alleged Colony Ridge lured buyers with the promise of affordable homeownership, then steered them into high-risk loans without verifying their ability to repay. The DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division also alleged the developers misrepresented flood risks and operated a bait-and-switch scheme that led to elevated foreclosure rates across the development.\nUnder the settlement, Colony Ridge is barred from developing\nnew residential plats\nfor three years. The developers must also invest $48 million in infrastructure improvements and pay $20 million to boost law enforcement presence in the community. The agreement requires the company to implement borrower protections and create a plan to address credit harm tied to its lending practices.\n\u201cIntentionally targeting vulnerable borrowers with the American dream of homeownership and then trapping them in a predatory scheme is not only wrong, it also violates our civil rights laws,\u201d U.S. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said in a statement.\nThe case became a political flashpoint in Texas well before the settlement. In 2023, Republican state leaders and conservative media outlets accused Colony Ridge of creating a haven for undocumented immigrants and fueling crime \u2014 claims the developers denied at the time. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, responding to the settlement Tuesday, said some of the law enforcement funding could support 287(g) agreements that allow local officers to assist with federal immigration enforcement.\nThe settlement throws a temporary wrench into the Houston-area\nhousing market\n, as well as one of the region\u2019s most prolific land development engines. Colony Ridge has added thousands of lots in\nLiberty County\nin recent years, marketing directly to working-class Hispanic buyers often shut out of traditional mortgage channels.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "New year, same rental market.\nThat was the story for January rents in the city, where median rent for a brokered, market-rate lease in Manhattan was $4,695, the third-highest number on record, according to Miller Samuel\u2019s monthly rental report for Douglas Elliman.\nThe median rent was up 8 percent from last year, and down just slightly from December\u2019s numbers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just in this mode of steadily rising rents and until we see more of a drop in mortgage rates,\u201d said report author Jonathan Miller. \u201cI think that trend is going to be sustained for a while.\u201d\nThe luxury rental market continued to outpace the rest of the market in terms of price growth, somewhat mirroring the sales market in the city as wealthy renters or buyers continue to be able to afford higher and higher prices.\nMedian luxury rents \u2014 defined as rents in the top 10 percent of the market \u2014 rose over 14 percent annually to $11,500, continuing a trend that persisted through most of the back-half of last year. Brokers have\npreviously cited\na lack of high-end rentable inventory as one of the reasons rents have started to routinely push $100 or $200 per foot in that market.\nVacancy rate fell to 2.44 percent, well below the 10-year average in January, while inventory fell over 9 percent from last year. While some of the inventory disappearing may be a result of landlords pulling their listings off public markets after the passage of the FARE Act in June, the falling vacancy rate indicates that more than anything, \u201cthe market\u2019s still tight,\u201d said Miller.\nIn Brooklyn, median rent was $3,814, up 9 percent from a year ago, while new leases signed and leasing inventory were down significantly compared to last year.\nIn northwest Queens, including the neighborhoods of Astoria, Sunnyside, Woodside and Long Island City, median rent was up over 10 percent annually to $3,754 per month.\nMiller has been closely watching the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision-making on rate cuts, which can trickle down to lower mortgage rates. Lower mortgage rates mean more homebuyers and likely fewer renters. But after a surprisingly robust jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics came out on Wednesday, the odds of relief just grew slimmer, according to Miller.\n\u201cThe possibility of mortgage rates sliding seems more and more remote,\u201d he said. \u201cEmployment popped this month higher than expected, which makes it pretty hard to cut rates.\u201d\n",

        "content": "As South Florida\u2019s multifamily market slows, AvalonBay Communities and MG Developer are proposing 374 apartments in separate Miami projects.\nArlington, Virginia-based AvalonBay wants to develop an eight-story, 166-unit building on a 1.6-acre site on the southwest corner of Southwest 23rd Street and Southwest 32nd Avenue, according to its application to the Miami Urban Development Review Board.\nAvalonBay paid $11.2 million for the site in November, property records show. It consists of lots at 2340 Southwest 32nd Avenue, 3224-3232 Southwest 23rd Street, and 3209, 3219 and 3231 Southwest 32nd Terrace.\nDesigned by Baker Barrios Architects, the project, called Kanso Coral Way, will taper down to three stories on the west side, where it will include townhome-style units, the application shows. It will have 21 studios, 75 one-bedroom units, 39 two-bedroom units, 18 one-bedroom lofts, five two-bedroom lofts, and eight three-bedroom units.\nCoral Gables-based MG Developer is proposing five- and six-story buildings with 208 multifamily units at the site of a hotel it owns at 1000 Northwest 42nd Avenue, near Miami International Airport, according to the firm\u2019s application.\nThe buildings would rise on the parking lot surrounding the five-story, 176-key Regency Miami Airport by Sonesta, which MG Developer purchased for\n$36 million\nin 2024.\nDesigned by Behar Font &amp; Partners, MG Developer\u2019s project is called Regency Parc &amp; Residences.\nThe site is also near the Miami Freedom Park project that\u2019s under construction. David Beckham, and Jorge and Jose Mas, are developing the complex with a 25,000-seat stadium for Inter Miami CF, as well as offices and retail.\nMG Developer is seeking the board\u2019s approval for three waivers, including for 161-foot pedestrian distances, more than the maximum allowed of 75 feet, as well as for an extension of the parking into the building\u2019s second layer and for a reduction of the required lot frontage.\nMiami\u2019s Urban Development Review Board will review the two proposals next week.\nAvalonBay, led by Benjamin W. Schall, is a real estate investment trust that develops and invests in multifamily, with a portfolio of nearly 100,000 units nationwide, according to its website and application. It has a pipeline of 7,800 units under construction across 21 projects.\nIn August, it paid\n$98.3 million\nfor the 270-unit garden-style complex at 5401 Wiles Road in Coconut Creek. In 2024, AvalonBay completed the 254-unit Avalon Merrick Park near the Douglas Road Metrorail station in Miami.\nMG Developer, led by\nAlirio Torrealba\n, was founded in 2014 and initially focused on Coral Gables, where it launched sales last year of the 78-unit\nAlhambra Parc\ncondominium at 33 Alhambra Circle. Vertical Developments is a project partner.\nThe firm has expanded beyond Coral Gables, planning\nDoral Parc\nwith partner Ernesto de Luca in Doral. The project will consist of three mixed-use buildings with 552 apartments, nearly 23,000 square feet of ground-floor retail and two garages. MG Developer also has been developing the three-phase\nMetro Parc\nin Hialeah and has plans for development in\nPrinceton\n.\nAfter developers jumped on South Florida\u2019s pandemic-era multifamily boom, defined by unprecedented demand and rent growth, they completed a record number of units in 2024. The deliveries came just as the in-migration lessened, leading to slower leaseups, more concessions and a\nsupply overhang\n.\nStill, developers starting projects now argue that by the time their new buildings are completed,\ndemand\nwould have caught up and rent growth will be restored.\n",

        "content": "When the City Council approved the rezoning of 42 blocks in Midtown South, it excluded 37 properties in the Garment District from changes that would pave the way for more housing.\nNow the owner of one of those properties is considering zoning changes to allow residential space anyway.\nManocherian Brothers signaled in a brief summary filed with the Department of City Planning that it wants to rezone 257 West 39th Street, a 16-story commercial building that is home to various fabric shops.\nThe owner filed a preliminary description of the project in December, calling for a partial conversion of the building to residential use. The site, along with the other 36 buildings carved out, is zoned for commercial, light manufacturing and community facility uses.\nNo application materials have yet been filed, and a property manager at the firm declined to comment.\nUnder a previous proposal, the northwest quadrant of the Midtown South plan would have been rezoned as M1-9A/R-12, a designation that allows both commercial and high-density residential use. But before approving the rezoning, the City Council made a number of changes. One was to drop the residential \u2014\u00a0R-12 \u2014\u00a0change from the Garment District, instead switching the area\u2019s zoning from M1-6 to M1-9A.\nAt the time, Council member Kevin Riley, then-chair of the subcommittee on zoning and franchises, said the\ncarveout\nwas in service of preserving a \u201cunique cluster of businesses\u201d in the Garment District. The New York Fashion Workforce Development Coalition agreed, praising the changes as \u201cvital protections\u201d for the district.\nThe building on 39th Street has fabric shops on the ground floor, including AK Fabrics, It\u2019s a Material World, Beckenstein Fabrics and Fabric House. More shops have taken residence on the upper floors, though one tenant indicated that much of the building sits vacant.\nThe street is among the endangered \u201cclusters\u201d referenced by Riley. The building next door, at 251 West 39th, is also home to several fabric and wholesale embellishments and accessory stores. Across the street is the Drama Book Shop, a reminder of the area\u2019s history of feeding the wardrobe needs of the nearby Theater District.\nBut you don\u2019t have to venture far for traces of that history to dissipate: Chain and fast-casual restaurants dominate 40th Street and have taken over much of 38th as well.\nAn analysis by PropertyScout found that most (more than 84 percent) of the Midtown South rezoning district is dedicated to commercial use, followed by residential at about 13 percent and manufacturing at 1.2 percent. PropertyScout CEO Wilson Parry pointed out that the original certificate of occupancy for the 39th Street building shows the property once served as tenement housing, which likely makes the property a good candidate for conversion, at least from an access to light and air perspective.\nIt\u2019s unclear if more property owners will seek site-specific zoning changes within the carveout area. However, if others follow Manocherian Brothers, the proposals could call into question the logic of the City Council\u2019s rezoning modifications, especially as the administration tries to ramp up housing construction. The city projects that the rezoning will allow the construction of more than 9,500 housing units, a decrease of\n200 units\nfrom the city\u2019s estimate before the Council\u2019s changes (though some have estimated the loss to be much greater).\nSuch individual zoning changes would be reviewed by the person who replaces local Council member Erik Bottcher, who won a special election this month to fill Brad Hoylman-Sigal\u2019s seat in the state Senate. Whoever takes over for Bottcher may have less final-say power for such proposals thanks to\nballot measures\nweakening the Council\u2019s tradition of member deference.\nThe northwest quadrant carveout drew the ire of some owners hoping to convert their properties or sell at a higher premium. At least\none property\nwithin that area was being marketed as completely vacant and ready for residential conversion right before the City Council amended the rezoning proposal.\nThe Garment District Alliance, a business improvement district whose board members include local property owners, opposed the Council\u2019s amendments, arguing that the city was needlessly leaving housing opportunities on the table.\nThe group recently conducted a survey of the 37 properties in the carveout and found a nearly 30 percent vacancy (though this doesn\u2019t account for any pending leases).\nBarbara Blair, president of the Garment District Alliance, said the zoning carveout sidelines an area where the city should be encouraging growth, given its proximity to the Port Authority Bus Terminal and Penn Station.\n\u201cIt\u2019s critically important that this is a high functioning neighborhood because it\u2019s a port of entry,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that the city should revisit it.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A mystery surrounding Oak Street\u2019s newest luxury storefront is solved, and the answer lies just one door away.\nVan Cleef &amp; Arpels is set to move its Chicago flagship into the planned redevelopment at 67 East Oak Street, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. The French jewelry house will lease about 3,500 square feet in the building, which is set to be built out to accommodate the brand\u2019s high-end aesthetic.\nThe Van Cleef move underscores a trend across the world\u2019s premier shopping strips such as Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills \u2014 where\nHerm\u00e8s recently spent a record $400 million\non property \u2014 and Bond Street in London. Luxury brands want to stand out as much as possible by exercising more control over their own real estate, people familiar with the Oak Street deal said.\nBy securing its own building where it will be the largest and most noticeable tenant, Van Cleef is separating from its current space at 65 East Oak Street, between Chanel and Moncler, which collectively take up a larger portion of the adjacent building than Van Cleef.\nThe move marks a high-stakes game of musical chairs \u2014 and an expansion for Van Cleef \u2014 on the Gold Coast\u2019s most exclusive shopping corridor. Van Cleef is relocating from a property as its German institutional landlord\nUnion Investment has been shopping it for sale\n.\nUnion hired Newmark in October to list the property, six years after acquiring it for a staggering\n$120 million in 2019\n. That pre-pandemic deal, which remains the largest price per square foot ever paid for a Chicago retail property at over $4,100, set a high bar for Oak Street. However, with one of the building\u2019s tenants headed next door, the valuation of the property could face fresh scrutiny as it hits the market.\nA spokesperson for Van Cleef said it didn\u2019t have any additional information Thursday but added, \u201cWe can be in touch closer to the opening.\u201d Union Investment said it wouldn\u2019t comment on \u201cmarket rumors.\u201d\nThe redevelopment at 67 East Oak represents a modern evolution for the block. The new two-story structure will replace a five-story Victorian-era building, continuing a movement toward sleek, glass-heavy modernist designs that are redefining the Gold Coast\u2019s aesthetic. By securing a tenant as prestigious as Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, the developers of the building have validated demand for purpose-built, boutique luxury spaces even as the broader retail market faces some headwinds,\u00a0especially on the Magnificent Mile where vacancy remains over 25 percent.\nA shroud of uncertainty still surrounds the identity of Van Cleef\u2019s next landlord. The property at 67 East Oak was transferred about a year ago by a trust that obscured its ownership to an LLC managed by real estate attorneys Ellen and Laura Distelheim, who appear to be based in Highland Park. The LLC in September took out a $9.1 million construction mortgage against the property from Wintrust.\nThe Distelheims didn\u2019t return requests for comment. An architect with Myefski Architects who\u2019s working on the design for the building at 67 East Oak Street declined to comment, and a consultant on the project with Chicago-based Malet Realty didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nThe jeweler\u2019s pending move has sparked speculation that one of Union Investment\u2019s current tenants at 65 East Oak, namely Chanel, could take the opportunity to expand into the Van Cleef space once it\u2019s vacated. The jeweler\u2019s new space should be operationally ready within 18 months to two years, a person familiar with the property said.\nA\nSavills team led by Todd Siegel\nrepresented the landlord in negotiating the lease at 67 East Oak, and declined to comment. A representative of Odyssey Retail Advisors, a brokerage that works with Van Cleef parent company Richemont, declined to comment.\nWhile some Chicago submarkets have struggled with retail vacancies, the Gold Coast\u2019s luxury market has remained a bastion of resilience. Oak Street continues to attract global brands seeking a presence in the Midwest\u2019s premier shopping district.\nRecent transactions backing that claim include the\n$17 million sale in late 2024 of the nearby property at 41 East Oak Street\n, which Bottega Veneta leases, to the Maramotti family that owns Max Mara. Furthermore, Burdeen\u2019s Jewelry also planted its flag on Oak Street in recent years, with a lease spanning two stories in the 10,000-square-foot former Northern Trust building at 120 East Oak Street. Landlord\nL3 Capital has also sought to sell the property\nover the past year without yet finding a buyer.\n",

The four-story office structure is expected to sell for roughly $800 per square foot, leading to a total price of more than $100 million, sources told the Business Times, though SKS said that pricing estimate was inaccurate.\nThe developer began construction on the office and light industrial building in 2019.

The property also includes 43,000 square feet of light industrial space; the tenant there is unclear.\nSKS secured $93 million in construction-to-permanent financing, consisting of a $56 million senior loan and $37 million in mezzanine funds. The $56 million loan matures in April.\nConstruction on the building wrapped in 2021.\nThe potential sale of 1 De Haro would be a rare handover of a stabilized office asset in San Francisco, according to the Business Times. Last month, DivcoWest acquired a major stake in 101 California Street for an undisclosed price; the tower\nhit the market late last year\nat $900 per square foot, giving it a roughly $1.1 billion valuation.\nIn the past three years, most buildings in San Francisco have sold with high\nvacancy rates\nor other issues like financial distress.

        "content": "Everyone in real estate had a chance to check out the renovated Waldorf Astoria at the\nREBNY annual gala\nlast month. Now, they\u2019ll have an opportunity to buy it.\nDajia Insurance Group, a state-run Chinese firm, is planning on putting the historic Manhattan property up for sale, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. Eastdil Secured will be in charge of marketing the property when it likely goes up for sale next month, expected to ask for at least $1 billion.\nThe full-block property on Park Avenue recently underwent a lengthy eight-year redevelopment. The renovation reduced the hotel portion of the property to 375 rooms, while also creating a 372-unit condominium offering; those units would still be sold separately, though the property\u2019s sale would include adjoining restaurants and retail sites.\nRoughly a year ago, the Waldorf Astoria landed its\nfirst condo closings\nsince the development launched in 2017.\nThat redevelopment was disrupted a year later when the\nChinese government seized Anbang Insurance Group\n, the original developer of the project, as part of a crackdown on companies with large foreign outlays. Months later, Anbang chief executive officer Wu Xiaohui was sentenced to 18 years in prison. Angbang had originally purchased the building in 2015 for $1.95 billion.\nThe hotel was eventually transferred to Dajia US, the American subsidiary of a Chinese government-established entity, and\nsales launched in early March 2020\n\u2014 days before the physical sales gallery was\nshut down due to Covid\n.\nTwo years later, the\nchief executive of Dajia US\nleft the project amid pandemic-induced cost overruns and project delays, as well as difficulties converting the landmarked property. At that time, sources familiar with the development projected work being finished by the end of 2023 at the earliest. It took another two years.\nWith construction overruns, the project cost more than $4 billion in total. While the sellers will be looking for at least $1 billion, they don\u2019t anticipate recouping all of the costs from the redevelopment, especially considering the small number of buyers who could put up ten figures for the site.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Sign up to get early access\nhere\n.\nA city-controlled land bank could soon acquire tax-delinquent properties and redevelop some of those parcels into affordable housing.\nThat\u2019s the idea behind four City Council bills approved with little fanfare in late January that are poised to transform the city\u2019s contentious tax lien sale, moving it away from the current model of selling liens to a private trust that charges owners hefty interest and can move to foreclose.\nUnder the legislation, a New York City Land Trust would have the authority to acquire tax liens from the city and transfer those properties to partners who would rehabilitate distressed or vacant parcels into income-restricted housing, while continuing to collect municipal arrears. Before officials can get started on any of that work, however, the city must apply for authorization from the New York State Urban Development Corp. and develop specific rules to govern the land bank.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to add to our toolbox to maintain and produce affordable housing,\u201d said Council member Gale Brewer, who sponsored a bill to establish the land bank. \u201cHow can we be innovative about the lien sale, instead of having properties just go to the highest bidder?\u201d\nThe bills are poised to become law by March, and crucially, they have the backing of the Mamdani administration. Matt Rauschenbach, a spokesperson for the mayor, told\nThe Real Deal\nthat the administration looks forward to implementing the land bank bills \u201cto keep New Yorkers safe, stable and in their homes.\u201d\nThe City Council initially passed the package of bills in December, but former Mayor Eric Adams vetoed the legislation out of concern that it would reduce the city\u2019s collection of arrears. On Jan. 29, a Council supermajority overrode those vetoes.\nBrewer\u2019s bill, which she said would enable the city to target \u201clikely dozens not thousands\u201d of properties to rehabilitate, creates a seven-member board of directors to control the land bank. It would be made up of appointees by Mayor Mamdani, the commissioners of the city\u2019s housing and finance departments and Council Speaker Julie Menin.\nHuge questions remain unresolved, however, about how such a land bank would function, and if the new system would result in substantially different outcomes for property owners.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still some uncertainty here about what the process will change,\u201d said Rachel Geballe, an attorney with Brooklyn Legal Services and a member of the Coalition for Affordable Homes, which is made up of more than 30 housing and community organizations that advocate for tax lien sale reform. \u201cThis is the first step in a longer journey,\u201d she added.\nFor starters, appointees to the board have to create bylaws on how the land bank would acquire and prioritize properties \u2014 this months-long process would include a public hearing to inform those rules \u2014 and then the board must submit an application to the Urban Development Corp. for permission to create the land bank. Once the application is with the state-run agency, it will take up to two months to process, but approval is all but assured.\nThe Urban Development Corp. has only once denied an application for a land bank, and that was due to a jurisdiction squabble because a county and a city within it submitted competing land bank applications, said Emily Mijatovic, a spokesperson for the Empire State Development Corp., which oversees Urban Development Corp.\nState push\nThe passage of the city legislation comes just as Gov. Kathy Hochul is pushing to expand the use of land banks as a tool to create and preserve affordable housing throughout the state. As part of her proposed budget, Hochul plans to increase the cap on the number of land banks that can be established in New York from 35 to 45 \u2014 there are currently 31 land banks across the state, including in Albany, Rochester and Syracuse. So far, none exist in the five boroughs.\nData from the New York Land Bank Association, an organization founded in 2015 to support the state\u2019s land banks, found that the land banks have returned $135 million in assessed value to local tax rolls over the last 13 years. That includes rehabilitating 3,231 properties, the association said.\nThe Hochul administration has made $170 million available to support land banks in the state since 2023. City lawmakers have separately sought to create a city land bank in previous years, but they ultimately weren\u2019t able to drum up enough support.\nFour bills toward tax lien reform\nBack in 2024 the City Council gave the Department of Finance permission to hold an annual tax lien sale\nthrough 2028\n. A tax lien auction doesn\u2019t have to occur each year \u2014 the mayor can put off a sale and has multiple times \u2014 but when they do, they\u2019ll have new requirements geared toward reforming the system thanks to the package of council legislation.\nBeyond Brewer\u2019s bill to establish the land bank, another bill, sponsored by former City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, formally authorizes the city to sell tax liens to a city land bank during any future sales. It also requires that any purchaser of a tax lien on a one- to three-unit residential property that is occupied by the owner cannot foreclose upon that lien until at least one year has passed after the sale and the value of the lien reaches either 15% of the property value or $70,000, whichever is the lesser amount.\nJennifer Polovetsky, partner at Duane Morris, who worked in the city\u2019s law department during the Giuliani administration handling tax lien sales and in rem foreclosures, said she\u2019s pleased with the new protections for homeowners, and that the bill differentiates more between owner-occupied housing and landlords who own multi-family rental buildings.\n\u201cTo take people\u2019s homes away for tax liens that are minimal, I think, is unfair, at the same time, everybody has to pay their taxes,\u201d said Polovetsky. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult balancing act.\u201d\nTo that end, a bill sponsored by Council member Sandy Nurse requires future tax lien purchases to make \u201cbest efforts\u201d to transfer those liens to the city land bank \u201cupon certain triggering events.\u201d That includes any tax liens being sold to the city\u2019s NYCTL 1998-2 Trust, often referred to as the graveyard trust. The trust warehouses the riskiest city liens, and currently holds 3,902 tax liens, according to Department of Finance data obtained by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nAs of 2025, the city\u2019s tax lien trusts contain 7,270 liens. That includes 3,468 liens on one, two or three-family homes, 2,452 on commercial properties and 1,355 on multi-family parcels, according to the DOF data. DOF spokesperson Ryan Lavis said the agency has not released a list of eligible properties for the next lien sale, which hasn\u2019t been scheduled yet.\nAnother bill sponsored by Nurse also requires the DOF to submit annual reports on properties with chronically unresolved liens \u2014 those outstanding for 36 or more months after being sold.\nA controversial program\nThe current tax lien sale process, established under the Giuliani administration in 1996, has faced criticism virtually since its creation for opening up property owners to predatory debt collectors. The system also has a reputation for being opaque and a beast to navigate.\nThe city adds a parcel to the tax lien sale list when its owner has long-overdue property taxes or water and sewer bills. The debt is sold to an authorized buyer, usually the Bank of New York Mellon and their servicer companies, MTAG Services, LLC and Tower Capital Management (Mellon, MTAG and Tower Capital did not return requests for comment on the bills). If the owner can\u2019t pay their arrears, plus accumulated interest, the firms foreclose on the property.\nUnder the new model, the land bank and its partners could take on some of these responsibilities, but perhaps the biggest unanswered question is: how will this be financed? As written, the council bills do not identify a specific funding mechanism for the land bank, though Hochul\u2019s support could help. It\u2019s also unclear which city agency would oversee and staff the entity, and who would partner with the city to redevelop properties under its control. Nonprofit community land trusts are one such partner the council is exploring, and for which grass-roots community and housing groups are pushing.\nAll those lingering questions have the real estate industry feeling wary.\nDev Awasthi, vice president of government affairs at the Real Estate Board of New York, noted that land banks can be successful in producing housing, but that the city must provide the new entity with the resources it needs in the upcoming budget \u2014 a tall order given the city\u2019s multi-billion dollar budget chasm.\nAnn Korchak, board president of the Small Property Owners of New York, went further and called the prospect of a city land bank \u201cvery troubling.\u201d\n\u201cTo my mind, it\u2019s another opportunity to create a COPA-like scenario to swoop in and take over distressed properties,\u201d said Korchak, referring to the\nCommunity Opportunity to Purchase Act\n. The controversial City Council bill would have given city-approved nonprofits, as well as joint ventures with for-profit companies, the first opportunity to purchase certain distressed multifamily buildings, or those with soon-to-expire affordability requirements.\n\u201cWe\u2019re watching this very closely,\u201d added Korchak.\n",

        "content": "A Marriott-branded hotel on downtown Long Beach\u2019s Ocean Boulevard traded hands for about half its prior price tag.\nThe Westin, at 333 East Ocean Boulevard and near the water, sold for about $42 million, according to records dated late last month,\ncompared to\nits sale price of $85 million nine years ago. Rockpoint and Highgate sold the 469-room hotel in the heart of the city\u2019s downtown to Khanna Enterprises, which received a $39 million note for the deal.\nThat trade comes out to less than $100,000 per key for the high-rise hotel. Los Angeles\u2019\nhotel world\nis in a rut, but that\u2019s still a very low per-key price that may have more to do with an upcoming cost the seller was on the hook for: a property improvement plan. That is basically an action plan designed to bring an individual hotel into compliance with the latest brand standards. An informed industry source said the property improvement plan was around $25 million.\nAnd things were already costly. The sellers completed a $23 million renovation of the hotel with a curved, modern facade, surrounded by palm trees, where a fountain sits at its entrance, two years after purchasing it. In 2024, the Long Beach hotel\u2019s unionized workers went on strike and later negotiated a new contract and a wage increase.\nLast year, Los Angeles\u2019 priciest per-key\ndeal\nwas in Malibu (it was one of California\u2019s priciest per-key deals ever, too). Luxury fashion brand Chrome Hearts, owned by Richard and Laurie Stark, purchased the luxe oceanfront Surfrider for $37.5 million from Dauntless Capital Partners. That deal came out to almost $2 million a room, but its pricing was an exception. Still, a West Hollywood hotel\ndeal\nthat had a per-key price reflective of the current market commanded more than the Long Beach trade, at $333,000 per room.\nRepresentatives for Khanna Enterprises, Rockpoint and Highgate did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOrange County-based and family-owned Khanna Enterprises has made discounted buys before. In 2022, it\npurchased\na Westin in San Jose for about $45 million, or 30 percent less than what the property commanded in 2017. Major players Rockpoint and Highgate have previously partnered on deals via joint ventures.\n",

        "content": "A long-vacant State Street landmark in Chicago could soon be fostering more than nostalgia.\nThe eight-story former department store at 401 South State Street \u2014 a hulking 485,000-square-foot building steps from the Harold Washington Library \u2014 is being pitched as an urban farming and food innovation hub. CoStar\nreported\nthat local investor Marc Calabria, who bought the property out of distress for\n$4.2 million last year\n, is teaming up with vertical farming firm Farm Zero to transform the space into what they describe as a first-of-its-kind controlled-environment agriculture campus.\nThe plan would carve the\nhistoric structure\ninto layers of vertical farming racks, research labs and startup space, alongside a public-facing produce market, restaurants and a rooftop outfitted with greenhouses, solar panels and outdoor dining. Calabria said he also intends to convert a portion of the building into student or senior housing, running parallel to the agriculture project as financing comes together. Total redevelopment costs have not been disclosed.\nFarm Zero\nhas already been testing its model in the Loop, growing leafy greens and herbs inside office towers at 30 North LaSalle Street and preparing to expand at 125 South Wacker Drive. The outlet reported that the State Street building would mark a leap from proof of concept to ecosystem, merging food production with health research and entrepreneurship under one roof.\nThe venture is expected to involve the Institute for Food Safety and Health, a partnership between Illinois Institute of Technology and the Food and Drug Administration, as well as Netherlands-based urban\nagriculture experts\n. The goal is to turn underused commercial real estate into local food infrastructure, with an emphasis on \u201cfood as medicine\u201d initiatives that tie fresh produce to chronic disease prevention and treatment, according to the publication.\nThe proposal adds a twist to the office-to-anything trend reshaping downtowns nationwide. While many distressed buildings are being eyed for apartments or data centers, Calabria\u2019s concept hinges on agriculture as adaptive reuse.\nThe building itself carries architectural heft. Designed by William Le Baron Jenney and completed in 1891, it is both a national and Chicago landmark, having housed Siegel, Cooper &amp; Company and later Sears before becoming an academic facility. Its prior $68 million valuation evaporated after tenant Robert Morris University vacated in 2020. Calabria\u2019s fall 2025 purchase equated to $9 per square foot.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Los Angeles-based KB Home claimed the No. 2 spot with 394 permits.\n\u201cSan Antonio is already highly concentrated,\u201d Zonda Advisory principal Bryan Glasshagel told the publication in January. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine Lennar or D.R. Horton grabbing much more share than they already have.\u201d\nEven in a slower cycle, San Antonio\u2019s fundamentals are keeping national builders engaged. Compared to other major metros, land remains relatively affordable and the permitting process comparatively streamlined, allowing builders to deliver lower-priced units more quickly.\nGeography tells the bigger story, as about 45 percent of last year\u2019s permits were issued on the city\u2019s South Side, particularly around Texas A&amp;M University \u2013 San Antonio, Von Ormy and Mitchell Lake. Once overlooked, the area has become a development darling thanks to cheaper land, public incentives and a wave of institutional investment.\nToyota has continued to expand its manufacturing space there, and British equipment maker JCB is relocating its North American headquarters to the area as well. Master-planned projects like\nSouthstar\u2019s\n600-acre VIDA community are rising alongside campus growth and infrastructure upgrades.\nThe West and Far West sides also captured more than 600 permits combined, buoyed by retail expansion and attainable lot prices.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Compass agent Kyle Blackmon just made a pretty penny off his company\u2019s stock.\nBut it wasn\u2019t for selling high or buying low. The veteran New York City luxury broker was awarded $5.5 million by a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) arbitration panel in a complaint he brought against UBS Financial Services over how it handled his Compass stock options and shares.\nIn January 2025, Blackmon brought a complaint to FINRA, which regulates the financial brokerage industry, accusing UBS of mishandling his unexercised stock options around Compass\u2019 initial public offering.\nCompass went public in 2021 with a share price around $20, but watched its stock fall to as low as $2 as interest rates spiked and the housing market cratered in the coming years. Its price has since rebounded as the brokerage\u2019s growth has continued to outpace the housing market and Compass has delivered cash-flow positive quarters in recent years.\nThe recommendations at issue involved \u201cvery complex\u201d trading strategies, a person familiar with Blackmon\u2019s claim told\nAdvisorHub\n. Blackmon claimed that UBS breached its fiduciary duty and violated an SEC rule governing how broker-dealers advise their clients, according to the arbitration award published by FINRA.\nThe hearings lasted over nine days starting on Jan. 26 and took place before a two-person panel in Boca Raton, Florida. Blackmon is registered in both New York and Florida.\nBlackmon did not respond to a request for comment. An attorney for UBS did not respond to a request for comment.\nBlackmon\nmade waves\nin the industry when he joined the fledgling Compass \u2014 then Urban Compass \u2014 in 2014. He had previously spent more than a decade at Brown Harris Stevens, where he made a name for himself when he sold former Citigroup chairman Sanford Weill\u2019s penthouse apartment at 15 Central Park West for\n$88 million\n, a record price in the city at the time.\nAt Compass, Blackmon, who has been described as a prototypical Southern gentleman, has continued to be a steady producer. He ranked 26th in\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s top agent rankings by deal volume in 2019.\nHis clients have included the former CEO of NBCUniversal, whose co-op Blackmon sold this week for\n$15 million\n, to Rupert Murdoch, whose Flatiron penthouse Blackmon sold for\n$24 million\nin 2024.\n",

        "content": "Dalfen Industrial cashed out of a Palm Beach County warehouse complex for $79.6 million, marking a 31.4 percent gain from its 2021 price as the market rebounds.\nAn entity tied to Dallas-based Dalfen Industrial and Goldman Sachs sold the Turnpike Logistics Center at 1673 and 1715 Meathe Drive in an unincorporated area of the county to Boston-based Cabot, according to records and real estate database Vizzda.\nThe price amounts to roughly $251 per square foot.\nDalfen paid\n$60.6 million\n, or about $191 per square foot, for the complex in 2021, when it was just completed.\nBillionaire developer and investor Jeff Greene developed Turnpike Logistics Center, consisting of a 124,500-square-foot building and a 193,000-square-foot building on nearly 30 acres, property records show.\nTenants include Eastern Metal Supply, KNOX Stones and Vault Logistics.\nCabot, led by Franz F. Colloredo-Mansfeld, was founded in 1986 and has invested over $17 billion in logistics properties, according to its website.\nThis purchase brought its South Florida shopping spree to 1.3 million square feet of industrial space. The firm also bought the two-building McCoy Logistics Center in Orlando, according to a Cabot news release. It also bought an industrial building at 2850 Ranch House Road, south of Palm Beach International Airport, the release says.\nIn Cabot\u2019s other South Florida deals, it sold the 231,000-square-foot warehouse at 3425 Meridian Parkway in Weston for\n$56 million\nin September, marking the\neighth\n-largest industrial deal in South Florida last year. Cabot paid\n$38.7 million\nfor the Pompano Business Center II, a 137,00-square-foot facility at 3001 West Copans Road in Pompano Beach.\nDalfen, led by Sean Dalfen, is an industrial investment firm, with more than $4.9 billion of assets under management across over 59 million square feet, according to its website. In South Florida, the firm sold Interstate Park Logistics Center at 3774 Interstate Park Road North in Riviera Beach for\n$55 million\nin 2024, and it bought the 192,000-square-foot warehouse at 5770 Miami Lakes Drive in Miami Lakes for\n$30.1 million\nin October.\nPalm Beach County\u2019s industrial market rebounded in the fourth quarter with a 6.8 percent vacancy rate, down from 7.2 percent in the previous quarter but slightly above the rate of 6.2 percent a year prior, according to Colliers. The drop in vacancy is partly due to a construction slowdown.\nOverall asking rents reached $16 per square foot, triple net, higher than the $15.83 a foot in the third quarter and $15.90 in the fourth quarter of last year, according to Colliers. Countywide, absorption last year reached 142,000 square feet.\n",

        "content": "The extent to which landlords across Los Angeles took advantage of the wildfire tragedy last year is the subject of a report attempting to quantify the narrative.\nWhen the blazes displaced thousands of residents in and around Pacific Palisades and Altadena,\nlandlords hiked up rental prices\nacross Los Angeles County despite calls from officials to crack down on price going, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n, citing data from Rent Brigade.\nThe tenant advocacy group analyzed Zillow listings in the year after the fires and found 18,360 potential instances of rent hikes exceeding 10 percent, potentially violating the anti-gouging rules signed by\nGov. Gavin Newsom\non Jan. 7, 2025, the day the fires broke out.\nCity and state authorities have filed only 12 lawsuits so far, even though officials vowed widespread enforcement. The legislation is in effect until Feb. 27.\nA Beverly Grove condo\u2019s listing price was hiked from $5,000 to $8,000 per month in the week after the fire, in one example. A property in Venice listed for 60 percent above its previous price, while the advertised rent price for a home in Santa Monica increased more than 100 percent.\n\u201cI was shocked by how many clear, unavoidable cases of price gouging there were,\u201d Philip Meyer, a co-author of the Rent Brigade report, told the outlet. \u201cA lot of folks didn\u2019t seem to think there\u2019d be any accountability, so they were breaking the law in plain view.\u201d\nOf the \u201cillegal listings,\u201d 42 percent were in L.A. County\u2019s Third District, which includes Pacific Palisades, as well as surrounding communities where many fire victims tried to relocate such as\nMalibu\n, Santa Monica, Venice and Calabasas.\nThe report claims that as much as $49 million in excess rent may have been collected over the past year. The actual number is likely much lower because the $49 million figure assumes that all 18,360 listings ended up being rented at the advertised price. The number of \u201cillegal listings\u201d could also be slightly lower as Zillow listings don\u2019t provide information on actual leases signed.\nL.A. County raised the price-gouging penalty to $50,000 from $10,000 a year ago, and the L.A. City Council increased the maximum penalty to $30,000. In July, the L.A. County Board of Supervisors allowed the Department of Consumer and Business Affairs to bypass the district attorney and directly fine price gougers, making it easier to go after landlords breaking the law.\nThe California Department of Justice\u2019s Disaster Relief Task Force, sent 753 warning letters to hotels and landlords who were accused of price gouging. State Attorney General Rob Bonta\u2019s office has filed five price-gouging lawsuits against individual landlords. L.A. City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto\u2019s office\nhas filed seven price-gouging lawsuits\nagainst individual landlords as well as housing companies like Blueground and Airbnb. L.A. County District Attorney Nathan Hochman hasn\u2019t prosecuted a single price-gouging case, acknowledging the work of city and state legal officials.\nAll 12 cases are currently pending or awaiting trial.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

San Francisco saw the highest rate since late 2019, while Los Angeles had the lowest rate since 2021.\nSupply is believed to be one of the biggest contributors to the gap between the two cities.\n\u201cSan Francisco has had a declining multifamily construction pipeline since 2018, whereas L.A. remained elevated through 2022,\u201d Rob Warnock, lead economic researcher at Apartment List, told the Chronicle.\nLast year, 15,095 multifamily units were completed in the Los Angeles area, marking an 18 percent increase from the year before, per CoStar data cited by the Chronicle. In San Francisco,\nhousing completions declined sharply\nafter the pandemic, with 2024 seeing the lowest number of finished projects in a decade with 1,597. The years of \u201cstrong production\u201d in Los Angeles \u201care paying dividends today by providing more apartments to absorb demand longer,\u201d Warnock said.\nWith the market flush with new supply, the vacancy rate in Los Angeles rose to a four-year high in January of 6.1 percent. San Francisco\u2019s was down to 3.3 percent, below the 4 percent registered in 2019.\nThe influx of artificial intelligence companies to San Francisco and growth of current tenants like OpenAI and\nAnthropic\nare expected to drive up demand for residences in the city and across the Bay Area in the coming years.\nPrices are\nalready following suit\nin San Francisco as\nheightened demand meets diminished supply\n. In the 94158 zip code that includes OpenAI and Nvidia\u2019s homes in Mission Bay, rents have increased 36 percent over the past year, while the surrounding 94107 zip code including South of Market, Potrero Hill and Dogpatch are up 21 percent. \u201cDemand is skyrocketing thanks to the AI industry,\u201d Warnock said.\nLast year,\nCBRE predicted\nthat AI companies\u2019 expansion could bring up to 60,000 new jobs to San Francisco, but job numbers in both San Francisco and Los Angeles tell a different story. Los Angeles County lost a net 6,700 jobs between December 2024 and December 2025, while San Francisco and San Mateo County together lost a net 4,400 jobs during that time, including 4,500 job losses in the tech-heavy information sector.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Cook County is barreling toward a tax sale it may not legally be able to afford.\nUnless Springfield lawmakers act within days, the county\u2019s annual auction of delinquent property tax debts will move forward in March, potentially compounding what housing advocates and legal experts say is a mounting constitutional liability. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat the urgency stems from the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2023 decision in Tyler v. Hennepin County, which found that governments violate the Fifth Amendment when they seize and sell a property over\nunpaid taxes\nand keep the excess equity.\nIllinois has yet to overhaul its tax sale system to comply.\nThat leaves Cook County Treasurer\nMaria Pappas\nin a bind. Without legislative authorization to delay again, she may have to proceed with a sale that could include as many as 40,000 properties with unpaid 2023 taxes. Each certificate sold could add another potential claimant if courts ultimately require counties to return surplus equity to dispossessed owners.\n\u201cEvery tax certificate an Illinois county sells is going to add to the county\u2019s potential liability,\u201d Bob Palmer, policy director of Housing Action Illinois, told the outlet. Matt Kreis, general counsel for the Center for Community Progress, echoed that concern, warning additional March sales could deepen financial exposure down the line.\nThe sale was already pushed from its traditional August date to March 25, 2026, after lawmakers signaled a fix was imminent. That fix never came. By law, owners must be notified 30 days before the auction, meaning notices would need to go out by late February \u2014 or sooner, given the logistics of printing and mailing tens of thousands of certified letters and placing legal ads.\nFOIA documents obtained by the publication show the March sale would cost roughly $190,000 in upfront expenses for printing and publication alone. Meanwhile,\nfederal judges\nin two Illinois districts have\ndeclined to shield\ncounties from liability, though no court has yet determined how past victims of so-called equity theft should be compensated.\nOther Illinois counties are improvising. Rock Island and White counties required tax buyers to sign waivers acknowledging they \u2014 not the county \u2014 would bear responsibility for excess equity claims. Participation held steady and bidding ticked up slightly, suggesting investors may pivot toward interest earnings rather than windfalls from forfeited equity, according to the outlet.\nIn Springfield, Sen. Celina Villanueva introduced legislation that would require counties to return surplus proceeds after taxes are paid. But with the notification deadline days away, Cook County may be forced to proceed under a system the Supreme Court has already called unconstitutional, and hope the bill comes through before lawsuits do.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A mystery sovereign wealth fund is the money behind Carlyle\u2019s blockbuster sale of a\nNew York self-storage portfolio\n,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nUnder the joint venture that acquired the\n15-property package for $1.03 billion\n, Columbia, Missouri-based StorageMart holds a 20 percent stake while the unnamed sovereign wealth fund controls roughly 80 percent, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.\nCarlyle, the seller, will remain involved as asset manager for the sovereign investor. The structure explains why property deeds list Carlyle-affiliated addresses and why a $615 million loan on the portfolio from Kayne Anderson also traces back to the private equity giant.\nThe transaction, first reported by Real Estate Alert, marks the largest\nself-storage deal in New York\nin five years.\nThe roughly 1.3 million-square-foot portfolio totals almost 26,000 storage units and is about 78 percent physically occupied, per REA. Washington, D.C.-based Carlyle assembled the properties over time as part of a broader push into outer-borough storage.\nEastdil Secured brokered the sale, which is the biggest trade in the sector since StorageMart\u2019s $3.2 billion purchase of 18 New York facilities from Edison Properties at the end of 2021, per REA.\nStorageMart will rebrand the newly acquired properties, located in Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan and Staten Island, under its Manhattan Mini Storage banner, according to a press release.\nThe facilities are relatively new, with an average age of four years, and in-place rents average $35.60 per square foot, per REA. Marketing materials suggested that improved management, stronger leasing and the burn-off of concessions could allow a new owner to triple net operating income within four years.\nEastdil declined to comment. Carlyle and StorageMart did not respond to requests for comment.\n",

An investor named Jho Low began buying trophy real estate in Manhattan with the money, though he later surrendered approximately $700 million in assets to the Department of Justice without admitting guilt. \u201cIf Low was 1MDB\u2019s architect, Leissner was its engineer,\u201d one source told the Post.\nLeissner pleaded guilty in 2018 and reported to federal prison this month. He admitted in 2022 that the Beverly Hills home was purchased using $25 million in money stolen from the Malaysian people. Simmons is not alleged to be involved in the fraud.\nIn November 2020, an LLC linked to Leissner sold the property in a distressed refinancing and sale-leaseback deal to entities affiliated with British real estate billionaires David and Simon Reuben. The mansion was never seized, however. The deal required Leissner and Simmons to pay $67,000 per month to remain in the home, but court filings allege no rent has been paid.\nSimmons filed a lawsuit in\nBeverly Hills\ncourt in January 2021 claiming the sale was unauthorized and that her signature on documents approving the handover to the Reuben brothers was procured through \u201cmisrepresentation and abuse of trust.\u201d Cantervale Limited, Chicago Title Company and 25 Beverly Park Circle Propco LLC are listed as cross-plaintiffs and defendants in the case, while Leissner, Simmons and Keyway Pride \u2014 the holding company for the Beverly Hills house \u2014 are cross-defendants and plaintiffs.\nA trial-setting conference in the ongoing case is scheduled for Feb. 25.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A portion of one of Alameda\u2019s biggest malls could be turned into housing near the waterfront.\nMerlone Geier Partners\n, owner of South Shore Center, is in discussions with Alameda officials to build an approximately 400-unit housing development on the southeastern corner of the shopping complex, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The site is currently home to Big 5 Sporting Goods and a car wash.\nThe location is one of two places at South Shore Center where Merlone Geier is looking to erect housing. Together, the two proposed developments could total 800 units. The project is still in its early stages and the company has yet to file an official development application with the city, Merlone Geier managing director Jamas Gwilliam told the Business Times.\nAs part of\nAlameda\n\u2019s state-mandated housing element, the city identified the Big 5 site and another parcel at the shopping center home to\nOfficeMax\nand Southshore Cafe as possible residential development sites to meet its goals. Merlone Geier is also eyeing the OfficeMax site for housing. Total units and building sizes for both locations are yet to be determined, though the firm is targeting roughly 400 units on each parcel, Gwilliam said. That would align with Alameda\u2019s desire to build approximately 800 units at South Shore Center as part of its housing element. If Merlone Geier does move forward with housing at the shopping center, the firm would be required to include some affordable units.\nIt\u2019s not the first time a developer has floated building housing at South Shore Center. In 2019, Atlanta-based Jamestown, which owned the mall before selling it to Merlone Geier in 2020 for an undisclosed price,\nproposed a 1,200-unit housing development\n.\nMerlone Geier is no stranger to building\nresidential developments at retail centers\n. The San Francisco-based firm is currently redeveloping the Northgate Mall in San Rafael into a mixed-use hub with more than 1,400 residences, making it the largest-ever housing development in Marin County.\nUnder its\nhousing element\n, Alameda must plan for 5,353 new homes by 2031.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The expansion follows a recruitment blitz that lured several teams in the last few months, as the Fort Worth area experiences sustained population growth.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been our plan to expand in Fort Worth when it made sense, when the need was there,\u201d said Bryan Pacholski, Compass\u2019 managing director for Dallas/Fort Worth. \u201cWith continued growth in Fort Worth like we\u2019ve had, the need has certainly arisen.\u201d\nWithin the past six months, Compass poached the Dewald Lipari Real Estate Group from Fort Worth independent brokerage League Real Estate; The Urban Group from\nWilliams Trew\n, an Ebby Halliday subsidiary; and Wendy Tockey and Ana Lopez from\nDouglas Elliman\n, Pacholski said.\nCompass sold $844 million in homes in Fort Worth last year, according to the brokerage.\nFort Worth\u2019s luxury residential market benefits from the steady influx of businesses to the Metroplex, albeit to a lesser degree than Dallas, Pacholski said. While\nPark Cities mansions\nare unlikely to slip off the state\u2019s ultra-luxury throne anytime soon,\nluxury estates\nand\nequestrian farms\ngenerate demand as well. The company\u2019s top sale in the Fort Worth area last year was a $13 million ranch, Pacholski said.\nSouthlake\nin Tarrant County also includes\none of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the state\n.\n\u201cYou have Toyota executives that live in Fort Worth. You have Goldman Sachs people that have moved. You\u2019ve got Bell. You\u2019ve got Lockheed Martin,\u201d Pacholski said.\nThe Shops at Clearfork is a mixed-use district west of the city, near suburban Benbrook. The amenity-rich offices have attracted companies as big as\nWells Fargo\nin a flight-to-quality trend away from aging downtown buildings.\n",

        "content": "Rental vouchers are one of the few things on which tenants and landlords agree. Mayor Zohran Mamdani, not so much. And it cost him some bad press.\n\u201cMamdani Reverses Campaign Promise to Expand Rental Assistance\u201d is the kind of\nNew York Times headline\nthat feels like a gut punch to a mayor.\nGothamist had the story\ntwo weeks ago, but its headline was tame (\u201cMamdani delays expansion of NYC housing aid program amid fiscal strain\u201d).\nThe ostensible reason for the decision is that Mamdani has to close a $7 billion budget gap, and can\u2019t add spending to a CityFHEPS program that has already ballooned from $176 million in fiscal 2019 to\n$1.2 billion\nlast year.\nBut one political consultant said there\u2019s probably more to it.\n\u201cThe enormous fiscal aspect is of course a factor in the new mayor\u2019s shift here, but I suspect there\u2019s a deeper underlying ideological reason,\u201d the source emailed me. \u201cThe mayor and\nCea Weaver\nand the like have a default setting of being suspicious and not supportive of any program that addresses affordable housing instability and homelessness through paying landlords.\u201d\nEdited version: \u201cThe mayor and Cea Weaver don\u2019t like paying landlords.\u201d\nIn any case, they can\u2019t pay landlords with money they don\u2019t have. Remember, they cannot raise income taxes. Only the state can. And that is not going to happen this year with Gov. Kathy Hochul facing a Republican challenger.\nBut tax revenue continues to grow even without an increase in rates. Will Mamdani eventually expand CityFHEPS to comply with the law passed by the last City Council? That\u2019s iffy at best.\nRather than fight the City Council\u2019s lawsuit demanding full funding for the expansion, Mamdani is trying to negotiate a settlement with the City Council and the Legal Aid Society.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the money involved, it\u2019s the mechanism and who gets paid,\u201d the source said. \u201cMy thinking is that City Hall has other plans for this crisis. Anything they do in this space is not going to include rent payments.\u201d\nThe Adams administration claimed the CityFHEPS expansion law could cost $17 billion over five years. The City Council insisted it would be less, but would be worth it regardless \u2014 in part because vouchers are cheaper than shelter beds.\nLost in this debate is an inconvenient truth: Rental vouchers don\u2019t create housing. They do the opposite: They increase competition for the available supply. That pushes rents up.\nHomelessness is not just about poverty or mental illness. Many cities have poverty rates like New York\u2019s, but little homelessness because housing is available and inexpensive. Here, the vacancy rate for voucher-eligible units is about 1 percent.\nA family in a shelter or crashing at a relative\u2019s house will take its voucher and go apartment-hunting. The city should ensure it\u2019s building enough homes to offset that increased demand.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nMichael Powell has been a New York City journalist for decades, but in the 1980s he was a tenant organizer in East Flatbush. That gave him a fascinating perspective to write about the struggles of renters and owners of rent-stabilized buildings \u2014 a perspective, he notes, that Mamdani lacks. Powell posted a\nfree link\nto his article. Send your thoughts on it to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Many readers emailed me to say NYCHA\u2019s\n$54,000-per-apartment\ncost to install heat pumps was too high. But one real estate source, whose co-op spent $70,000 per unit to add heat pumps, thought it was too low. NYCHA told me the $38.4 million project included electrical upgrades, window work, radiator removal and more to accommodate 2,137 heat pumps in 712 units, as well as new hot water systems. Alternatives to cure the development\u2019s heating problems would have cost as much or more, a spokesperson said.\nElsewhere\u2026\nThe mayor\u2019s new chief technology officer, computer scientist Lisa Gelobter, led the team that developed the animation technology used to create GIFs. She was also on the Hulu launch team.\nWith\nthose credentials\n, she ought to be able to bring technology to the antiquated, cumbersome HPD violations process.\nI have been gathering anecdotes and opinions on housing violations for a future column. From my discussions with landlords, the process is riddled with inefficiencies \u2014 and more than a little dishonesty.\nGelobter and her team could start by introducing technology to make it easier to clear violations after repairs are made.\nCoordinating city inspectors\u2019 follow-up visits with tenants is a full-time job for some property management employees. Even when they manage to get everyone on the same page, the inspector or the tenant sometimes misses the appointment, and it can be weeks or even months before the stars align again.\nOne landlord suggested that a superintendent could record and upload a video showing the completed repair, with the tenant validating that it was done. An HPD staffer could then clear the violation without ever leaving her desk.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$16.4 million\nfor a 4,962-square-foot, sponsor sale condominium unit at 211 West 84th Street on the Upper West Side. Alexa Lambert, Alison Black and Elizabeth Goss of Compass had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$5.9 million\nfor a bulk sale of sponsor-sale condominium units, storage spaces and parking spots by the Permanent Mission of Canada to the United Nations.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$9.7 million\nfor a 4,592-square-foot, 25-foot-wide townhouse at 37 Garden Place in Brooklyn Heights. Jennifer H. Cooke of Brown Harris Stevens has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permits filed were for a combined project at 680 and 690 East Fordham Road in Belmont. It would be 190 units and 116,822 square feet. Nikolai Katz filed the permit on behalf of Hen Vaknin of Bridge Asset Management.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

It alleges the developer failed to disclose deviations from plans and hasn\u2019t fixed the defects identified by the association and individual unit owners.\nCain International is not named as a defendant.\nIn addition to OKO Group, the association is suing project design firms Asymptote Architecture and Revuelta Architecture International, general contractor Civic Construction and 19 subcontractors.\nDoronin declined to comment, through a spokesperson. The condo association\u2019s lawyer Nicholas Siegfried and executives for the architecture firms and Civic Construction did not respond to requests for comment. The lawsuit does not specify the dollar amount in damages the association is seeking.\nThe developer obtained a temporary certificate of occupancy in 2023 but has been unable to get a final certificate of occupancy \u201cdue to ongoing, unresolved construction and design defects and code violations,\u201d the complaint alleges.\nOKO Group and Cain International started construction on Missoni Baia in 2019 after landing a\n$243.3 million\nconstruction loan.

Other alleged problems include lack of hot water in portions of the tower, defective fire alarm devices and fire sprinklers, leaks in the pool plumbing and filtration systems and non-functioning elevators.\nThe condo association of another branded development, the ultra-luxury\nAston Martin Residences\nin downtown Miami, recently sued developer Germ\u00e1n Coto, alleging he siphoned millions of dollars from the owners.",

        "content": "Oak Brook is poised to trade cubicles for shopping carts.\nA developer submitted plans to raze seven aging office buildings along Butterfield Road in the\nvillage\nwest of Chicago and replace them with a 225,000-square-foot Amazon retail store and a 150,000-square-foot, two-story Ashley Furniture flagship. The Chicago Tribune\nreported\nthat the 22-acre site at 2805-2907 Butterfield Road sits along I-88 and marks the latest push to reinvent the village\u2019s struggling office corridor as a retail hub.\nVillage President Larry Herman told the outlet that the Amazon store would be about 40 percent larger than the nearby Costco and would function strictly as a retail operation \u2014 not a distribution warehouse. Amazon is also planning a similar large-format store in Orland Park as it experiments with brick-and-mortar concepts.\nAs part of the deal, the developer would fund a new traffic signal and dedicate land for future westbound I-88 access ramps at Meyers Road, aimed at easing congestion and unlocking further development.\nThe proposal heads next to the Planning and Zoning Commission for a public hearing before returning to the Village Board for final approval. If greenlit, demolition could begin later this year, with construction stretching through 2027.\nOak Brook\ndoes not levy a municipal property tax, meaning sales tax revenue is the village\u2019s primary funding source, and officials expect the\ntwo anchor stores\nto generate several million dollars annually while drawing additional retailers to the Butterfield corridor.\nHerman framed the project as a strategic response to long-term suburban office distress. Several of the seven buildings slated for demolition have been repossessed by lenders, and he said many properties along the\ncorridor\nare unlikely to rebound.\nThe move would also create retail continuity between Oakbrook Center and Yorktown Mall, reinforcing the village\u2019s position as a regional shopping and dining destination, according to the publication. Costco, which recently began a multimillion-dollar expansion, isn\u2019t expected to suffer from the new competition, Herman said, arguing the membership warehouse and Amazon operate on distinct merchandising models.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The Austin Business Journal\nreported\nthat the county did not disclose the sale price.\nThe hulking limestone structure, built in the late 1800s, has been on the market for at least six months.\nCavileer\ntold county officials he spotted the for-sale sign on a Sunday about four months ago and called that day to make an offer.\nWhile plans are still fluid, Cavileer signaled a hospitality heavy vision for the site, potentially blending hotel rooms, restaurant space and other mixed uses.\n\u201cHospitality is in our blood,\u201d he said during the meeting, adding that the historic jail\u2019s\ncharacter\n\u2014 not just the dirt beneath it \u2014 drove the deal.\nCavileer was previously the public face of the redevelopment of the 70-acre Fort Worth Stockyards, a project led by Los Angeles-based Majestic Realty Company that repositioned the district as a retail, dining and entertainment anchor. He departed that venture last year amid a\nlegal dispute\nand launched Delightful Development, which has since surfaced on other projects, including in Florida.\nThe\nGeorgetown\nacquisition would mark a significant adaptive reuse of historic property in one of Central Texas\u2019 fastest-growing cities according to the publication. Georgetown, about 30 miles north of Austin, recently surpassed 100,000 residents and has attracted a wave of corporate investment, including manufacturers and industry groups setting up operations in the region.\nCounty leaders framed the sale as both preservation and opportunity, the outlet reported. Commissioners expressed relief that the building would not be demolished and praised Cavileer\u2019s track record with historic properties.\nThe site\u2019s proximity to the Square \u2014 the cultural and commercial heart of\nGeorgetown\n\u2014 could deepen tourism traffic and extend visitor stays, especially as the city continues to market itself as a Hill Country destination with urban amenities.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "After years in limbo, a troubled state-owned building is changing hands and getting a makeover.\nGov. Kathy Hochul on Friday announced that a nonprofit partnership made up of the Fifth Avenue Committee, Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation and One Brooklyn Health will take over 1024 Fulton Street, a three-story building in Clinton Hill that has sat vacant since the \u201990s.\nThe state will demolish the building to make way for 125 rental units, which will be affordable to those earning between 30 percent and 80 percent of the area median income. The project will also include 27,000 square feet of community center space operated by Fort Greene Council, and a 1,000-square-foot health clinic.\nApex Building Group and Henge Development will handle general contracting and project management. Their financial involvement in the project will be limited to collecting a portion of the developer fee.\nThe $111 million project is expected to be almost entirely financed through low-income tax credits, tax-exempt bonds and public capital subsidy, according to a representative from the governor\u2019s office.\nThe state\u2019s Office of Children and Family Services bought the property in 1997, hoping to develop a community center, but \u201cstructural issues\u201d stood in the way.\nThe building, which was once a showroom for Brooklyn Union Gas, has since sat vacant. The Cuomo administration halted an auction for the site in 2014, after then-Assembly member Walter Mosley urged that the building be transferred to the nonprofit Northeast Brooklyn Housing Development Corp.,\nthe New York Daily News reported at the time\n. That plan fell apart, as did another to\nsell the site\nto a Philadelphia-based company.\nThe latest plan has the state footing the bill for demolishing the 33,000-square-foot structure, for which it previously allocated $3.7 million.\nEmpire State Development issued a request for proposals for the\nsite last year\n, seeking a development team that is at least 51 percent owned by a nonprofit. The development partnership is 100 percent not-for-profit, which gave the team a slight edge in the competition for the site, according to the scoring RFP rubric.\nThe project will next undergo environmental review and then the state\u2019s general project plan process. As part of her executive budget, Hochul proposed reforming the State Environmental Quality Review Act to exempt certain housing projects. Given the project\u2019s parameters, the Fulton Street project could qualify for that exemption if the proposal is ultimately approved.\n",

        "content": "Housing production in Los Angeles is poised to pick up even more as a new adaptive reuse law goes into effect this month.\nThe Citywide Adaptive Reuse Ordinance makes it easier for developers to convert vacant commercial buildings into residences by streamlining approvals and increasing the number of properties eligible for conversion, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\nLast month, the Los Angeles City Council voted in favor of the\nCitywide Adaptive Reuse Ordinance\n, which repeals Los Angeles\u2019 existing Adaptive Reuse Incentive Areas Specific Plan, which limited conversions to certain parts of the city including downtown, Chinatown, Hollywood and Koreatown. With the new law, all commercial buildings within Los Angeles city limits can be considered for adaptive reuse.\nThe new regulations also lower the age of the buildings that can be considered for adaptive reuse to structures that are at least 15 years old, down from only allowing conversion at buildings built before 1975. Under the new law, more projects will also be able to receive approval by right, meaning they will be automatically approved if they comply with existing zoning, building codes and land-use regulations.\nJamison Properties\n\u2019s president, Garrett Lee, is leading the way. The Koreatown-based firm is behind the three largest\noffice-to-residential\nprojects in the city to date.\n\u201cThis is monumental for the city,\u201d Lee told the Times of the new ordinance.\nThousands of underutilized commercial structures across the city could be unlocked for housing, Ken Bernstein, a principal city planner in the Los Angeles Department of City Planning, told the Times.\nBy streamlining conversion approvals for projects that meet city guidelines, developers won\u2019t have to estimate how long before they can start construction. \u201cWhen you take that risk off the table, it materially improves the feasibility of conversions,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt addresses both the housing shortage and the long-term office vacancy issue.\u201d\nThere is more than 50 million square feet of vacant office space in Los Angeles, according to the Times. The city\nranks second nationwide\nin adaptive reuse projects with 5,640 apartments in the works, following Manhattan, which has 11,000 such units. In Los Angeles, office-to-residential projects specifically make up a total of 2,843 apartments, or about 50 percent of the city\u2019s adaptive reuse housing pipeline.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The buyer was an LLC managed by\nLinnette Miller and Robert Miller\n, a developer. The property spans 7,600 square feet and has five bedrooms and eight bathrooms. It dates to 1924. Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s\nCarole and Brett Koeppel\nhad the listing, which went live in November for $25 million.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe priciest commercial transaction recorded in the tri-county region was in Palm Beach County, where\nDalfen Industrial\noffloaded a warehouse complex\nat\n1673 and 1715 Meathe Drive\nfor $79.6 million. That\u2019s a 31.4 percent increase from its\n2021 purchase price\nof $60.6 million. The buyer of the Turnpike Logistics Center, comprising a 124,500-square-foot building and another 193,000-square-foot building, was Boston-based\nCabot\n. The latest sale works out to about $251 per square foot.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Todd Wider\n, a plastic surgeon-turned-documentarian, picked up a single-family home at\n9505 Southwest 63rd Court\nin Pinecrest for $10.7 million. The seller was an LLC, managed by\nAlex A. Rogers,\nwhich purchased the home in 2023 for $10.6 million. The five-bedroom mansion spans about 10,200 square feet and sits on a 1.1-acre lot. It has five bedrooms, six full bathrooms, two half baths, a pool, an elevator and fruit trees. The home went on sale in June of last year, for $11.5 million.\nDennis Carvajal\nwith One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty was the seller\u2019s agent, and\nMarilyn Cromer\nwith Douglas Elliman brought the buyer.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Dmitrii Khasanov\n, an investor, and\nEkaterina Khasanova\npurchased a home at\n13225 Arch Creek Terrace\nin North Miami for $7.5 million.

The seller listed the property for sale a little more than a year ago, for $10.8 million.\nDevin Kay\nwith Douglas Elliman had the listing.\nBy the Numbers:\nBuyers have the upper hand in every major metro \u2014 except one\nIf you needed another sign that\nbuyers\nhave the upper hand, here it is: just one of the top 20 metros in the fourth quarter saw homes trade above asking prices.\nThe outlier in the fourth quarter of 2025 was\nSan Francisco\n, where the average sale-to-list ratio in the fourth quarter was 104.7 percent according to an analysis of data from brokerage and research firm Redfin.

        "content": "Eran Polack\u2019s troubled\nHAP Investments\nlost control of three Harlem rental buildings and his firm appears to have shuttered entirely.\nThe commercial real estate lender\nLadder Capital\n, which was owed roughly $69 million, submitted $1 million credit bids for each of the buildings at 2211 Third Avenue, 329 Pleasant Avenue and 2338 Second Avenue at an auction last month. The trio of multifamily properties was part of HAP\u2019s once-ambitious push into Upper Manhattan. The foreclosure sale was first reported by\nPincusCo\n.\nThe foreclosure adds to the mounting troubles for HAP. Hundreds of Israeli investors lost a collective $70 million after Madison Realty Capital seized control in 2024 of the developer\u2019s failed HAP Seven condominium project at 4452 Broadway in Washington Heights. HAP founders Nir Amsel, Amir Hasid and Polack later informed investors that the property was officially transferred to Madison following Chapter 11 proceedings in state court, according to Ynetnews.\nNow HAP\u2019s website appears to be down and the phone number affiliated with the business has been disconnected. All of the New York properties listed on its website in November appear to have been sold or lost to foreclosure.\nA few years ago, HAP was marketing the three Harlem rentals \u2014 along with another property \u2014 for a combined $130 million. In 2019, listing broker James Nelson of Avison Young said most of the portfolio\u2019s 171 newly built apartments were free-market units. Two of the buildings include affordable housing, while the 30-unit property at 2338 Second Avenue was slated to receive a 421a tax abatement upon completion.\nThe debt dates back to a $64 million loan originated in December 2021 by Allegiant Capital Funding and later assigned to an entity tied to Ladder. The lender moved to foreclose in 2024, alleging the loan had gone into default with $60.9 million in unpaid principal, plus interest.\nIn its state Supreme Court complaint, the lender said Polack and an affiliated entity are listed as guarantors and could face recourse for certain losses.\nIn addition to HAP\u2019s website and phone being down, Polack now lists himself as CEO of HAP Construction on LinkedIn. He did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Attorneys for Ladder also did not respond.\n",

The firm filed an application with the Department of City Planning on Wednesday.\nCharney filed permits for the project in 2023, planning a 40-story building with 161,000 square feet of total space. The authorization application calls for another 10 stories and approximately 50 additional units, along with nearly 34,000 square feet of extra space.\nIf approved, the project would extend roughly 53 stories tall with more than 200 condos.\nThe city would be getting a benefit from the authorization, as Charney would make improvements to the nearby Nevins Street subway station, which serves four different transit lines. The developer would privately fund the upgrades \u2014 including improved accessibility and capacity \u2014 though it did not provide an expected cost.\nThe developer acquired the site\nnear the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the Downtown Brooklyn Whole Foods in 2023.

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s housing market has a new distinction, and it\u2019s not one brokers will love to tout.\nWhile homebuying became more affordable over the past year in most of the country\u2019s biggest metros, Chicago moved in the opposite direction. Buyers in the region needed 3.5 percent more income in December to afford a median-priced home than they did a year earlier, according to a\nreport\nissued Wednesday by Redfin. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat in eight of the nation\u2019s 10 largest metro areas, required income dropped during the same period.\nThe biggest affordability boost came in Dallas, where buyers needed 7.4 percent less income, year-over-year. Nationwide, the income required to buy the median-priced home fell 4 percent \u2014 a 7.5 percentage point swing compared to Chicago\u2019s decline.\nThe culprit is Chicago\u2019s\nrelative steadiness\n. Unlike pandemic boomtowns such as Phoenix, where prices skyrocketed and are now giving back gains, Chicago saw slower, steadier appreciation, according to the report.\n\u201cThe reason Chicago was getting more expensive in 2025 is that it didn\u2019t get too expensive during the pandemic,\u201d Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather told the outlet, contrasting the city with markets that overheated in 2021 and 2022.\nAt the peak of the boom in early 2022, Chicago home prices were up roughly 10 percent, year-over-year. Phoenix\u2019s were rising at about triple that pace. Now Phoenix buyers have seen affordability improve by 3.7 percent, nearly the inverse of\nChicago\u2019s slide\n.\nLocal agents say the squeeze feels persistent. Ryan Gable of StartingPoint Realty told the outlet that affordability \u201chas not gotten better in years.\u201d Uran Kabashi of Fulton Grace Realty pointed to the double bind of elevated mortgage rates and thin inventory, compounded by broader inflation eating into buyers\u2019 budgets.\nAmong the 50 metros Redfin tracked, only Detroit saw a slightly larger drop in affordability, with buyers needing 3.6 percent more income, year-over-year.\nEven so, Chicago remains\ncomparatively attainable\n. The median home price in Dallas tops $377,000, versus just under $349,000 in Chicago. And while buying\npower improved\nin coastal markets such as Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego, households there still need more than $230,000 in income to afford a median-priced home \u2014 more than double the $105,440 required in the Chicago area.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Blackhawk Plaza in Danville is facing escalating financial distress as its primary lender, Preferred Bank, has filed two loan default notices totaling $31 million, according to Contra Costa County records.\nThe defaults come on top of a separate $5 million loan from Nano Banc, placing the retail center under simultaneous foreclosure pressure from two creditors, the\nSan Jose Mercury News reported\n. The mounting delinquencies underscore a deteriorating capital structure for a property already struggling with declining tenancy and operational challenges.\nThe financing history reveals an increasingly leveraged position. Ramanujan Group, run by real estate financier Deba Shyam, acquired the plaza in 2020 for $28.3 million, immediately supported by a $28 million loan from Preferred Bank. The lender extended an additional $3 million in 2023, while Nano Banc provided $5 million in 2024. The combined $36 million\nin debt exceeds the acquisition price by 27 percent, indicating aggressive leverage relative to asset value and raising questions about underwriting assumptions, cash\u2011flow performance and the borrower\u2019s ability to service obligations.\nOperationally, the property has experienced weakening fundamentals. Key tenants, including Draeger\u2019s Market, have closed, and a planned Apple Cinemas lease never materialized after the prior theater operator exited in 2022. Reduced occupancy and declining foot traffic likely impaired net operating income, constraining the borrower\u2019s capacity to meet debt\u2011service requirements, according to the Mercury News.\nCompounding the financial strain, a coalition of commercial property owners \u2014 including the Blackhawk Automotive and Cultural Museum \u2014 has filed a lawsuit alleging severe deferred maintenance. The complaint cites \u201cever-widening cracks and potholes in parking lots, decrepit and non-functioning light stanchions, rusted and broken staircase railings, crumbling stairs, broken and inoperable irrigation pipes, unclean water, and dangerous erosion of soil.\u201d It also lists \u201copen and live wiring,\u201d conditions that could further depress asset value and complicate any refinancing or sale. Ramanujan Group has denied the allegations, but litigation adds another layer of risk for lenders and stakeholders.\nThe plaza\u2019s challenges are amplified by its geographic position, which experts note is disadvantaged by its distance from Interstate 680, limiting regional draw.\nHowever, Danville ranks as one of the\nwealthiest cities\nin the Bay Area, with an average home price north of $2 million. It has hosted a number of celebrity residents including David DeWalt, the\nformer CEO of McAfee\n, and Ken Behring,\nformer owner\nof the NFL\u2019s Seattle Seahawks. Blackhawk Plaza, once marketed as a premium open\u2011air center with Mediterranean architecture and landscaped water features, would seem a good fit, but the property now faces a convergence of loan defaults, operational decline, tenant attrition and legal disputes.\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

It will add roughly 70,000 new residents to the city of The Woodlands at full buildout, according to the website for The Woodlands-based developer, Howard Hughes Corporation. Currently about 50,000 people live within the community.\nThe deal, approved unanimously by county commissioners, would anchor 22 acres of the district with the Texans\u2019 headquarters, including indoor training facilities and outdoor practice fields, the Houston Chronicle\nreported\n.\nThe broader Toro District will blend retail, restaurants, hotel, entertainment and commercial space within Bridgeland Central, the emerging downtown of the community.\nFinancial details\nremain murky.\nHarris County Judge Lina Hidalgo\nsaid the county\u2019s proposed contribution would total $150 million, largely earmarked for\ninfrastructure upgrades\n, and funded through a tax increment reinvestment zone. Under that structure, a portion of property tax growth generated within the zone would be reinvested there rather than flow to the county\u2019s general fund.\nThe Texans\nwill participate in the development through an affiliate and plan to break ground later this year, targeting a 2029 opening. The team currently practices at the Houston Methodist Training Center near NRG Stadium.\nHoward Hughes CEO David O\u2019Reilly framed the project as more than a sports complex, calling it \u201ca statement about where Houston is going.\u201d The company \u2014 parent of Howard Hughes Holdings \u2014 also developed The Woodlands and controls 118,000 acres nationally, with 10 million square feet of office and retail space across five states, according to Bisnow.\nToro District is projected to generate $34 billion in long-term economic impact and create more than 17,000 jobs regionally, according to project backers.

        "content": "California Attorney General Rob Bonta has launched a civil rights investigation into Los Angeles County\u2019s emergency response to the\nEaton fire in Altadena\n, introducing significant regulatory and legal exposure for county agencies.\nThe probe centers on whether race, age or disability discrimination contributed to delayed evacuation alerts and\nlimited firefighting resources\nin west Altadena, a historically Black enclave that suffered disproportionate losses, the\nLos Angeles Times reported\n. Nearly all of the fire\u2019s 19 fatalities occurred in that neighborhood, and residents have argued that systemic failures in alerts and resource deployment directly contributed to the devastation.\nThe investigation follows extensive reporting by the Times that documents stark disparities between west and east Altadena. While eastern neighborhoods received evacuation orders within an hour of ignition, west Altadena residents waited up to nine hours for alerts \u2014 some areas nearly 12 hours \u2014 despite multiple 911 calls and visible fire activity.\nA Times analysis also found that most fire crews remained east of Lake Avenue even as the fire shifted west. These operational gaps raise questions about emergency\u2011management protocols, resource allocation and whether structural inequities influenced decision\u2011making during the disaster.\nBonta has previously charged real estate agents with price-gouging\nin the aftermath of disasters\n, but civil rights law represents a new avenue. From a governance perspective, L.A. County agencies, including the Fire Department, Sheriff\u2019s Department, and Office of Emergency Management, now face a multi\u2011layered review process: Bonta\u2019s civil rights probe, an independent state\u2011ordered investigation by the Fire Safety Research Institute and a separate audit by the California State Auditor.\nWhile county officials assert that responders acted appropriately under extreme conditions, the attorney general\u2019s office is uniquely positioned to evaluate potential \u201cdisparate\u2011impact liability\u201d \u2014 an assessment that does not require proof of intent.\nCleanup of the Eaton fire is\nessentially complete\n, but the rebuild\nhas lagged\n.\nPolitical groups, particularly Altadena for Accountability, view the investigation as a breakthrough in establishing precedent for civil rights oversight in disaster response. Advocates argue that climate\u2011related emergencies increasingly expose vulnerable populations to disproportionate harm, and that the Eaton fire illustrates the financial and institutional costs of inequitable preparedness.\nThe outcome of the probe could influence future emergency\u2011response standards statewide. Bonta noted that the goal is corrective.\n\u201cOur main focus is to make sure that whatever happened here won\u2019t ever happen again,\u201d he said.\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

Taylor-based E3 Agriculture plans to build up to seven homes using crop-based construction materials as part of a 14-home development along Main Street, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe project is a partnership with Liberty3D and will mark E3\u2019s first full-scale homebuilding. While the company has supplied materials to local efforts such as Community First Village, founder and CEO Lucas Evans said this is the first time it will take the reins on delivering an entire home.\n\u201cWe\u2019re wanting to take it on ourselves to do a production home that would be affordable, simple and efficient to build,\u201d Evans told the outlet.\nUp to 80 percent of each house\u2019s materials are expected to come from E3\u2019s hemp crops. Insulation, drywall and other components will be\nplant-based\n, with the exception of roofs, foundations and interior studs. Two homes are already underway and are slated for completion this fall, with\nprices capped\nat $320,000. E3 may develop as many as five additional lots, according to the publication.\nRockdale has a population 5,637 as of 2024 Census estimates, and sits between Austin and College Station. The former Alcoa site is being repositioned as a 33,000-acre, multi-company campus that already hosts\nbitcoin mining operations\ndue to its proximity to large transmission infrastructure. Liberty3D CEO Jason Jones said interest in the area has \u201cblown up\u201d over the past two years.\nAs Austin-area builders search for ways to rein in costs, Evans said hemp could become a viable alternative. Initial construction costs in Rockdale will likely mirror those of conventional builds, he said, but pairing sustainable materials with 3D printing technology could eventually \u201cdramatically bring down the cost of raw materials.\u201d\nThere are performance perks, too.

Later, it became entangled in a divorce between the show\u2019s star and her now ex-husband.\nNow it has a new claim, as one of downtown\u2019s most expensive condos after trading for $57 million on Friday, according to public records.\nThe final number falls short of the recent new record set by financier Harsh Padia\u2019s condo at\n150 Charles\n, which sold for $60 million last summer.\nThe penthouse at 70 Vestry was listed for $65 million in November after the seller, reality star Julia Haart,\nwon the home\nafter a messy three-year divorce from Italian entrepreneur Silvio Scaglia.\nModlin Group\u2019s Adam Modlin had the listing.\nScaglia bought the apartment for\n$55 million in 2018\n. He appeared as Haart\u2019s estranged husband during the second season of Netflix\u2019s \u201cMy Unorthodox Life,\u201d which showed Haart and her children living in New York City after leaving an Orthodox Jewish community in the Hudson Valley.\nThe massive penthouse also made an appearance. Spanning 7,800 square feet, the 16-room condo covers three floors and has a private elevator, two chef\u2019s kitchens, five bedrooms and five full bathrooms. It also has more than 3,600 square feet of terrace.\nHaart landed the condo after a judge granted her a default judgment in the divorce at the start of last year.\nWhile the proceedings were ongoing, the home\nrented for $125,000\nin 2022.\nThe sale is downtown\u2019s latest big deal after a number of developments along the West Side have attracted wealthy buyers for condos asking well beyond the recent record closings.\nIn December, a buyer at Zeckendorf Development and Atlas Capital Group\u2019s 80 Clarkson agreed to pay\n$129 million for multiple units\n. The deal has yet to close, while a penthouse at Aurora Capital\u2019s 140 Jane Street asking\n$87.5 million\nfound a buyer last summer.\n",

        "content": "Federal prosecutors have charged four individuals in a fraud scheme that resulted in the bogus sale of a Burbank home for $1.5 million, with neither the legitimate homeowner nor the purported buyer aware of the transaction.\nAccording to a federal complaint, the group \u2014 which included licensed real estate broker Glenis Cardona, along with Ivan Reyes, Arshak Akopyan and fugitive Basil Tikriti \u2014 used forged signatures, falsified loan applications and fabricated identities to orchestrate the scam, the\nLos Angeles Times reported\n. Three of the suspects were arrested on Feb. 11.\nThe scheme centered on securing nearly $1 million from a mortgage loan.\nAfter the sale closed in January 2024, Cardona received a $60,000 wire transfer, which she quickly spent on big-money retail purchases and on a new car.\nThe fraud came to light when employees at third\u2011party entities handling loan disbursements flagged suspicious wire activity. One gold\u2011purchasing business became alarmed when a caller attempted to pick up gold using the homeowner\u2019s phone number, but with a different name. The title company also raised concerns, prompting further scrutiny.\nFederal investigators uncovered evidence while examining WhatsApp and Signal messages tied to a separate mortgage\u2011fraud case. A cooperating witness provided access to communications in which the defendants discussed property targets, access logistics and even the need to recruit impostors to pose as elderly buyers and sellers before a notary.\nTikriti, who has prior convictions for identity theft and grand theft, joked about using gray hair spray and a cane to age an accomplice.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have old 65 yr old guys at my disposal to play ball,\u201d a message from Tikriti stated, according to the Times. \u201cI\u2019m not a casting director.\u201d\nBurbank Police had already opened an investigation after the real homeowner reported that his property had been sold without his knowledge. The supposed buyer later told police they were unaware of the purchase and were suddenly responsible for a $975,000 mortgage.\nMortgage fraud is nothing new \u2014 alleged culprits range from New York Attorney General\nLetitia James\nto Texas Attorney General\nKen Paxton\n\u2014 but usually one of the parties is involved in the scam.

It\u2019s a move that would expand its Chicago presence and shift its local office from River North to the Loop. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat the firm currently occupies less than 40,000 square feet in the 321 North Clark Street building.\nIf finalized, the lease would mark the latest vote of confidence from the\nlegal sector\nin a downtown office market still grappling with elevated vacancy, the outlet reported. While some of Chicago\u2019s largest firms have trimmed space in recent years, a cadre of small and mid-sized practices have moved the other way.\nChicago-based\nCroke Fairchild Duarte &amp; Beres\n, Cleveland-based Benesch Friedlander Coplan &amp; Aronoff and Chicago\u2019s\nGoldman Ismail Tomaselli Brennan &amp; Baum\nhave all inked deals for\nlarger downtown offices\nover the past year.\nA spokesperson for Loeb &amp; Loeb told Crain\u2019s the firm is \u201cevaluating all of our options for office space and have made no final decisions.\u201d JLL is representing the tenant in negotiations, while Stream Realty Partners oversees leasing at the Franklin Street tower.\nThe 35-story, 807,000-square-foot building is owned by a venture of Morgan Stanley and has proved relatively resilient, according to the publication. Even as anchor tenants CNA Financial and Meta have sought to shed chunks of space on the sublease market, the property has attracted new tenants. Shamrock Trading recently subleased a floor from CNA, and Vermillion Development signed for nearly 16,000 square feet.\nA Loeb &amp; Loeb departure would add pressure at the building at 321 North Clark Street. The 896,502-square-foot tower is now controlled by Nuveen, which\ntook over the building\nin December to resolve a troubled loan. The building is about 78 percent leased, according to CoStar Group, and recently lost another major tenant when CBRE relocated to the building at 300 North LaSalle Drive.\nLoeb &amp; Loeb launched its Chicago office in 2003 with six intellectual property attorneys and has since grown to roughly 80 attorneys and staff locally.

        "content": "Menlo Equities will abandon its previously approved plans for a 400,000\u2011square\u2011foot office and life sciences campus in Sunnyvale and will pivot to a large\u2011scale data center on the site.\nThe decision reflects the accelerating preference in Silicon Valley for artificial intelligence\u2011driven infrastructure, the\nSan Francisco Business Times reported\n. The revised plan cuts the original office footprint by roughly 200,000 square feet and replaces the multibuilding research and design concept with a single two\u2011story data center and an adjacent Pacific Gas and Electric Company substation to support the project\u2019s substantial power requirements.\nThe shift aligns with surging demand for\ndata\u2011center capacity\nas AI companies and cloud providers race to secure power\u2011dense facilities. Across the region, developers are shelving traditional office projects in favor of data centers capable of supporting AI workloads, which require significantly more electricity and cooling than conventional enterprise computing.\nMenlo Equities, run by Rick Holmstrom from its headquarters in Menlo Park, first entered the data\u2011center sector in 2025 through its Menlo Digital platform, partnering with NRG Energy to develop 350 megawatts of capacity across Northern Virginia, Silicon Valley and Dallas, with delivery expected between 2027 and 2028. The Sunnyvale project, located at 888\u2013894 Ross Drive in Peery Park, is now confirmed as one of those sites. The company has secured 49 megawatts of power \u2014 enough to supply more than 10,000 homes \u2014 positioning the property as a high\u2011capacity AI\u2011oriented facility.\nThe developer\nacquired\nthe 9\u2011acre site for $88.5 million in 2022 and initially proposed two, four\u2011story office buildings and a six\u2011level parking structure. The firm hired RMW Architects &amp; Interiors, RHAA Landscape Architects and Newmark\u2019s Joe Kelly and Mike Saign for the original concept. However, by early 2026, filings show the company had taken out a $20 million loan from Northern Trust and secured a redevelopment permit valued at $23.43 million, along with an entitlement extension through November 2026 \u2014 steps consistent with advancing a data\u2011center project.\nThe site\u2019s industrial zoning further supports the decision, as such zoning is typical for data\u2011center development. Menlo Equities already owns another\nSunnyvale data center\nat 444 Toyama Drive, purchased from Digital Realty in 2021.\nThe Sunnyvale project joins more than 30 new data\u2011center developments underway in California as Amazon.com, Microsoft, CloudHQ, Edgecore and others compete to build capacity.\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "Adam Neumann is fast becoming persona non-grata in El Portal, the small village in northeast Miami-Dade County where he wants to erase an old church to make way for his wife\u2019s private school.\nAt a town hall Thursday, a procession of village residents bashed Neumann, who was not in attendance, and two owner representatives for SOLFL School, who hosted the event.\nFour days earlier, crews began tearing down the Rader Memorial United Methodist Church at 205 Northeast 87th Street, which\nNeumann\npurchased 11 months ago for $13.7 million. The price was more than $8 million above the previous sale price in 2021. While the 1950s building is not a historic landmark, the church has stood as the village\u2019s signature property for nearly 75 years.\nEl Portal residents said they were blindsided by the demolition, fueling their suspicions that Neumann and SOLFL representatives are going to plow ahead with redeveloping the property without their input.\nThe name is an acronym for Student of Life, For Life, a holistic Jewish school founded by\nRebekah Neumann\nthat operates a Montessori-style, Torah-centered learning environment, according to SOLFL\u2019s website.\nNeumann did not respond to email requesting comment.\nRoughly 100 people attended the town hall, and several spoke with condemnation.\n\u201cWhen you tore down the church, you punched us in the face,\u201d said Denise White, a resident who spoke at the town hall. \u201cRight now, you\u2019re acting overlordy, not neighborly.\u201d\nIt was the first of two community meetings mandated by El Portal Village Council after its members delayed voting on zoning changes that would allow the school on the church property.\nSOLFL is a rebranding of\nWeGrow\n, a school started by the Neumanns as an off-shoot of\nWeWork\n, the co-working firm previously helmed by Adam Neumann. He stepped down as CEO in 2019 under pressure from WeWork\u2019s board of directors and investors after a botched attempt to take the company public.\nIn December and January, SOLFL representatives presented the vision for the new campus, which consists of two-story Tiki hut-style buildings and an eight-foot wall surrounding the property\u2019s perimeter. The structure would be built using 3-D printing technology. The proposed campus would teach a maximum of 350 students from kindergarten to 12th grade.\nDemolition of the church is in SOLFL\u2019s site plan and other documents submitted to the village, but school representatives did not disclose that a teardown permit was obtained in November and that the teardown would begin before the town hall, videos of the city council meetings show.\nSOLFL representative Jeffrey Davis said the demolition work could not be paused. \u201cIt has to be cleared,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is completely unsafe.\u201d\nResidents said keeping them in the dark about the demolition reinforced their lack of trust.\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t transparent at the last meeting,\u201d said Calixto Navarro Acosta. \u201cThere are ulterior motives and nefarious motives here. We are not dealing with a clean slate.\u201d\nSOLFL is seeking village council approval for a site plan, an amendment to El Portal\u2019s comprehensive master plan and a special exception for 2.1 acres that includes the church property and a neighboring single family house and vacant lot, which was part of the $13.7 million acquisition.\nNeumann purchased the church property from an affiliate of Miami-based Elm Springs, which paid\n$5.5 million\nfor the site five years ago, and had previously planned on converting the building into office, retail and restaurant spaces.\nOver the summer, SOLFL explored renovating the church into a school, but had to pivot to new construction because it is less expensive, Davis said.\nThe school is one of two projects Neumann is planning in El Portal.\nLast year, Neumann\u2019s Miami-based multifamily development firm Flow and Canada Global bought a 16-acre former mobile home park in El Portal for\n$71.5 million\nafter winning a courthouse auction for the site. The joint venture is planning a mixed-use project with 2,380-plus apartments, but plans have not been disclosed.",

        "content": "Highbridge Equity Partners has defaulted on another downtown Oakland office property, adding to a growing list of distressed assets in the foreclosure pipeline.\nJPMorgan Chase has filed a complaint in Alameda County Superior Court seeking to foreclose on 1540\u20131544 Broadway, a multitenant building in the East Bay city\u2019s core, after Highbridge failed to repay a $2.7 million loan tied to the property, the\nSan Francisco Business Times reported\n. The borrower stopped making payments in June 2025 and still owes $2.3 million as of February 2026, according to court filings.\nThe building sits adjacent to 1500 Broadway, one of three Highbridge-owned office towers \u2014 along with the Tribune Tower and the Financial Center Building \u2014 that entered foreclosure in 2025 and were placed in receivership. At the time, the receiver reported severe deterioration across the portfolio, including broken windows, asbestos, drug paraphernalia and other hazardous conditions.\nThe new foreclosure indicates that Highbridge\u2019s broader Oakland strategy, once built on acquiring and repositioning historic assets, has largely collapsed under debt pressure and deferred maintenance.\nHighbridge, run by CEO Douglas Abrams, purchased 1540\u20131544 Broadway for $6 million in 2018 and financed it with a loan from First Republic Bank, whose assets JPMorgan later acquired.\nThe lawsuit also names Thomas Beers, producer of the television show \u201cDeadliest Catch,\u201d and his wife Leslie Beers as guarantors. The Beers invested in the Tribune Tower and could be held liable for repayment, according to the Business Times.\nJPMorgan is seeking a court\u2011appointed receiver to stabilize operations and potentially prepare the Broadway property for sale.\nThe building has long served as an arts and cultural venue, most recently housing the Black Arts Movement Business District Community Development Corporation and the Lower Bottom Playaz theater company.\nHighbridge\u2019s troubles extend beyond Broadway. Between 2016 and 2018, the firm spent more than $117 million acquiring the Tribune Tower, Financial Center Building and 1500 Broadway, later refinancing the portfolio with a $111 million loan. That debt also went into default in 2025, prompting lender Rialto Capital Management to\ntake control\nthrough receivership. The firm additionally owns The Loom, a 5\u2011acre East Oakland redevelopment site with an uncertain future.\nThe context of Highbridge troubles is Oakland\u2019s weakened post\u2011pandemic office market, where vacancies have surged and\ndistressed assets\nare trading at steep discounts. Multiple buildings have already been\nseized by lenders\nor sold at fractions of prior valuations, signaling a deep market reset.\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "Ken Griffin isn\u2019t waiting around for 2030.\nThe Citadel founder\nopted\nthis week to accelerate his bet on 350 Park Avenue, electing to take a 60 percent stake in the joint venture developing the 2 million-square-foot tower rather than wait for his original deadline to either buy the site outright or assume control later. The move reshuffles the balance of power between Griffin and his partners, Vornado Realty Trust and Rudin Management, while speeding up one of Midtown\u2019s most closely watched office projects.\nUnder a 2022 agreement, Griffin had until June 2030 to either acquire a majority stake in the venture or purchase the site for $1.4 billion, which would have sidelined Vornado and Rudin from the development. Instead, he chose in December to lock in the 60 percent position now, according to comments from Vornado president Michael Franco during the REIT\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call.\nThe decision also amends the original ownership split. Vornado and Rudin have until July to secure between 23 percent and 40 percent of the joint venture, with Vornado\u2019s share ranging from 21 percent to 36 percent. Previously, Vornado was slated for 36 percent and Rudin 4 percent. Demolition is expected to begin in April following City Council approval of the rezoning and permit filings late last year.\nCitadel, the anchor tenant, previously committed to 850,000 square feet, but Vornado executives signaled that footprint could grow. CEO Steve Roth said the hedge fund is still finalizing its space needs, while Franco noted interest from tenants with leases expiring between 2031 and 2033 seeking as little as 50,000 square feet.\nThe accelerated timeline is a vote of confidence in a top-tier Park Avenue product at a moment when much of the office market remains bifurcated. Griffin is doubling down on trophy space as other landlords retrench, a high-stakes wager that demand for best-in-class offices will outpace broader market malaise.\nIt\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day weekend, which means it\u2019s time to turn down the lights, pour a glass of pinot noir and snuggle up to your loved one while reading the week\u2019s most important New York stories from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nWaldorf Astoria hits market after eight-year condo conversion\nDajia Insurance Group, a state-run Chinese firm, plans to sell the historic Waldorf Astoria property in Manhattan.\nA lengthy renovation reduced the hotel portion to 375 rooms and created 372 condominium units, which would be sold separately, though the overall property sale will include adjoining restaurants and retail sites.\nThe project, which launched in 2017, faced major disruptions, including the seizure of the original developer, Anbang Insurance Group, by the Chinese government.\nManocherian Brothers float resi conversion despite Midtown South carveout\nThe City Council\u2019s Midtown South rezoning carved out 37 Garment District properties, including a building at 257 West 39th Street, to preserve the area\u2019s \u201cunique cluster of businesses.\u201d\nDespite this exclusion, the owner of 257 West 39th Street is pursuing a site-specific zoning change to allow for a partial residential conversion of the commercial building.\nThe Garment District Alliance opposed the carveout, citing a nearly 30 percent vacancy rate in the excluded properties and arguing that the city is needlessly preventing housing and growth in an area well-served by transit.\nJonathan Miller and Douglas Elliman break up data partnership after 32 years\nAppraiser Jonathan Miller\u2019s 32-year relationship with Douglas Elliman has come to a close, with the final market report under the partnership published on Thursday.\nMiller, who heads Miller Samuel appraisal firm and is an adjunct professor at Columbia, is shifting his focus to a new neighborhood-level housing index venture called StreetMatrix.\nLaunched with economist Nick Huntington-Klein, the venture offers market performance data down to bedroom count and neighborhood, aiming to provide a more granular view than traditional city-wide housing indexes.\nTech took Manhattan office leases by storm in January\nJanuary was a good month for tech companies, going by the number of leases they signed within the five boroughs of New York City. Of the top ten office leases in January, four of them were for tech companies and two of those were for AI platforms.\n\u201cMy very wealthy Russians\u201d: Insider brokers\u2019 frenzy to access Epstein\u2019s townhouse\nAnd finally, Jeffrey Epstein tightly controlled access to his Upper East Side townhouse, arbitrarily rejecting offers and expressing suspicion about potential buyers.\nEmails show brokers attempted to gain entry by name-dropping ultra-wealthy individuals, often without success and in some cases using the names as bait.\nEpstein never sold the property while alive, seeking exorbitant prices (claiming to have rejected offers up to $250 million) and turning down a $125 million offer around 2010, indicating he was likely averse to selling.\n",

The seller was reality star Julia Haart, and the buyer was a trust. The 7,800-square-foot condo went on the market in November for $65 million. Italian entrepreneur Silvio Scaglia, Haart\u2019s ex-husband,\nhad purchased the pad\n, which also has 3,600 square feet of terrace, in 2018 for $55 million. Modlin Group\u2019s Adam Modlin had the listing.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nSoho had the top commercial deal recorded in the city. A six-story building at\n158 Lafayette Street\ntraded for $15.3 million. The seller was an LLC tied to New York-based\nWaterfall Asset Management\n, which took over the property in 2024 amid a foreclosure case, and the buyer was\nLink Real Estate\n, which on its website notes the 27,500-square-foot building will be converted into a co-working property with ground-floor retail.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nSocialit\nShafi Roepers\nparted with a co-op at\n4 East 66th Street\nin the Upper East Side for $28 million, about a decade after the unit first went on the market for $65 million. The buyer was a trust. The full-floor pad has a private elevator landing, five bedrooms, eight bathrooms and views of Central Park. Brown Harris Stevens\u2019\nMary Fitzgibbons\nand\nMartha Kramer\nhad the listing.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nBusinesswoman\nSegolene Frere-Gallienne\n, daughter of late billionaire Albert Frere, paid $7.2 million for an Upper East Side pad at\n50 East 77th Street\n. The sellers were\nDavid and Marcia Kaplan,\nwho had owned the unit since 2010, when they purchased it for $4.7 million. It has three bedrooms and three and a half bathrooms.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Mustafa Mete Karakaye\nand\nNeslihan Karakaye\npurchased a condo at\n200 Amsterdam Avenue\nin Lincoln Square for $7.1 million. The seller,\nVincent329 LLC\n, paid $7.3 million for the unit in 2021. The unit measures about 2,900 square feet and has four bedrooms and four and a half baths. Compass\u2019\nTania Isacoff Friedland\nand\nAlli Chiaramonte\nhad the listing, and\nLynne Samone Mazin\n, also with Compass, brought the buyer.\nBy the Numbers:\nMortgage delinquencies tick up as affordability strains homeowners\nThe U.S. affordability crisis is continuing to take a toll on homeowners, an increasing share of whom are missing their mortgage payments.\nIn the fourth quarter, the share of delinquent mortgages ticked up 28 basis points year over year and 27 basis points quarter over quarter to reach 4.26 percent, according to the\nMortgage Bankers Association\n. While more homeowners are falling behind on payments, the rate of loans starting the\nforeclosure\nprocess held relatively steady compared to the quarter and year before, at about 0.2 percent.\nMississippi had the highest 90-day delinquency rate, of 2.66 percent, and the highest 30-day delinquency rate, of 3.98 percent. Both rates increased the most quarter over quarter in the country, by 26 basis points (90 days) and by 44 basis points (30 days).\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "Humberto Lopes heard the opening bell, drew his fists and posted a profanity-laden TikTok urging landlords to stop paying their property taxes.\n\u201cLet\u2019s start not paying the property tax for this quarter coming up. We\u2019ll fucking bankrupt this city!\u201d he shouted in the video posted on\nTuesday\n. \u201cThe minute we don\u2019t pay your property tax, New York City will fucking crumble.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t foreclose on all of us,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhen you destroy us, we can destroy the fucking city,\u201d he concluded.\nIn the video, Lopes holds up a poster released by the Mamdani administration this week announcing dates for five \u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings, where tenants are invited to speak out about their experiences renting in the city. The image featured the text \u201cNew Yorkers vs. Bad Landlords,\u201d\nevoking\na boxing match.\nLandlord groups were not amused by the imagery.\n\u201cFraming his \u2018rental ripoff\u2019 hearings as a prize fight between tenants vs. landlords makes it disturbingly clear that this new mayor\u2019s housing policies are going to be driven by marquee-like politics, circus-like slogans, and us-versus-them divisiveness,\u201d Ann Korchak, board president of the Small Property Owners of New York, said in a statement.\n\u201cShow trials may make good theater, but they don\u2019t solve problems,\u201d Anthony Burgos, CEO\u00a0 of the New York Apartment Association, said in a statement.\nLopes echoed these sentiments, but with more f-bombs.\n\u201cWhat do you think you are going to accomplish that HPD didn\u2019t accomplish?\u201d he asked, clutching the poster, referring to the city\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development.\nHe also questioned why the administration isn\u2019t including NYCHA in the hearings. (Public Advocate Jumaane Williams called out the city\u2019s public housing authority last month as the city\u2019s true worst landlord, though it didn\u2019t make his official list.)\nWhen asked on Friday, Lopes said he is in earnest about urging owners to withhold property taxes, comparing it to when tenants stop paying rent to force landlords to make repairs. He said he\u2019s consulting with attorneys about following through with the threat.\nHow many others would follow him in such a protest is unclear. Korchak said that while small property owners are \u201cfrustrated with the anti-landlord vitriol,\u201d withholding property tax payments \u201cwould bring greater financial harm and distress\u201d to owners. She thinks a more constructive route is pushing the state to amend the 2019 rent laws.\nLopes heads H.L. Dynasty, which owns and operates 1.2 million square feet of real estate in New York and Florida, according to the company\u2019s website. Lopes recently launched a landlord group, dubbed Gotham Housing Alliance, inspired by his longtime love of Batman (in videos, Batman figurines can be seen on his desk, and in at least one video, a life-sized Caped Crusader statue appears in the background). Lopes noted in a call Friday that Batman\u2019s M.O. is to bring the \u201ccity back to normal.\u201d\nThe video features a bombastic style seen in his other videos on social media, where he speaks directly to the camera. Lopes has griped about other city policies in these videos, including the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act, or COPA.\n\u201cIf a poster about \u2018bad landlords\u2019 strikes a nerve, it\u2019s worth asking why. Our focus isn\u2019t on rhetoric \u2014 it\u2019s on results,\u201d a City Hall spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re eager to partner with anyone who\u2019s committed to providing safe, stable homes and helping us build a city that everyday New Yorkers can actually afford.\u201d\nTenant advocates say the \u201crental ripoff\u201d video proves the need for the hearings.\n\u201cHit dogs holler,\u201d Charlie Dulik, director of tenant organizing at Housing Conservation Coordinators, said. \u201cHis rage about tenants being offered a simple chance to speak about the conditions they endure shows exactly why these hearings are necessary.\u201d\nThe first hearing is slated for Feb. 26 in Downtown Brooklyn. As one of his first acts as mayor, Zohran Mamdani signed an executive order establishing the hearings to give tenants the opportunity to speak about \u201cabusive, deceptive, or unconscionable landlord practices.\u201d The executive order lists property managers and landlords as potential speakers as well.\nWithin 90 days of the final hearing, scheduled for April 7, city agencies must issue a joint report outlining common themes raised during the hearings and recommending policy and other changes to address them.\n",

        "content": "Related Urban\n, BH Group and Tezral Partners won initial approval to build an apartment complex with two 20-story towers on city-owned land in Riviera Beach.\nThe 418-unit project at\nMarina Village\nwas given the green light from the village\u2019s planning and zoning board Thursday, but its members recommended adding workforce housing to the mix.\nThe project, called Gallery at Marina Village, is slated for 2.45 acres surrounded by Broadway, East 12\nth\nStreet, Avenue C, and West 13\nth\nStreet. The proposal is headed to\nRiviera Beach\nCity Council for a final vote.\nThe Related Group\u2019s affordable housing arm, Miami-based Related Urban Development Group, is partnering with Aventura-based\nBH Group\nand West Palm Beach-based Tezral Partners on the project.\nIt will consist of 190 two-bedrooms, 152 one-bedrooms, 38 three-bedrooms, and 38 studios as well as 3,000 square feet of retail and 3,000 square feet of office. Amenities include an 1,800-square-foot fitness center, an 1,800-square-foot coworking space and a ground floor pool deck.\nA nine-level parking garage is planned with 652 spaces, about 25 percent fewer than the 863 spaces required under city code.\nThe development site is next to Residences at Marina Village,\nan eight-story, 149-unit\naffordable and workforce housing project that Related Urban and Tezral Partners have under construction. That project is close to topping off and will be finished in the fall, Related Urban president Albert Milo told the board.\nBoth developments are elements of Riviera Beach\u2019s Marina Village Master Plan, a 2013 concept designed to bring economic development to a 90-acre area by the waterfront owned by the city and its community redevelopment agency. It consists of a marina and an event space with an outdoor restaurant.\nThe complex that\u2019s under construction includes affordable and workforce housing, but the proposed development was designed as a market-rate project.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean a workforce person can\u2019t reside in the Gallery at Marina Village, but the market will dictate what the rents will be,\u201d Milo told the board.\nRents are expected to cost $2,500 to $4,000 a month, he said.\nFrank Fernandez, the board\u2019s vice chair, pressed for workforce units to be part of this project.\nMilo said he had no objections to that since workforce housing units only need to be affordable for households earning 120 percent of the area median income. In Palm Beach County, that is about $98,000 a year, an amount that is expected to grow to $108,000 in May, Milo told the board.\nRelated Urban is one of three development teams that submitted bids to build on 12 acres of Marina Village near the waterfront as part of the city\u2019s master plan.\nThe overall master plan includes 224 condo units, 120 hotel rooms, 10 three-story condos, waterfront retail and a parking garage with a soccer field and tennis and pickleball courts.\nRelated Urban\u2019s proposal will face off against Forest Development\u2019s offer to build a convention center of at least 320,000 square feet, along with 270 hotel rooms and 164 condo units, as well as Sonnenblick Development\u2019s plans to construct a mixed-use project that will include a\nMargaritaville Hotel\nand 270 residential units.",

        "content": "A power duo on Los Angeles\u2019 Eastside cleaned up this week with a couple of closings, despite more \u201csensitive\u201d conditions for the area\u2019s high end.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019\nJonathan Mogharrabi and Marci Kays\n, who count the actor Brad Pitt among their clients, double ended the sale of Fear of God designer\nJerry Lorenzo\n\u2019s Los Feliz home for $8.6 million, or $1,197 per square foot. The deal on the property at 2401 Nottingham Avenue officially closed on Wednesday.\nIt\u2019s the priciest deal to close in Los Feliz since June\u2019s $13.5 million trade of 4533 Cockerham Drive, which sold for $675 per square foot.\nMogharrabi and Kays, who co-listed the property with Plus Real Estate\u2019s Tyrone McKillen, represented the local family that purchased the home.\nLorenzo and his wife, Desiree Manuel, paid $8.5 million for the Nottingham Avenue residence, making the decision to list it after they purchased and moved their family to 9051 Briarcrest Lane in Beverly Hills Post Office for $19.5 million in 2023.\nAfter the closing of Lorenzo\u2019s home, Kays and Mogharrabi capped the work week with the closing of 2720 Glendower Avenue, also in Los Feliz, and also double ended by the high-end agents.\nThe 1920s, Spanish Colonial style home closed for nearly $7.4 million.\nProperty records indicate the seller was a shell company tied to registered agents with a Sacramento address.\nMarket dynamics\nMogharrabi called the Eastside\u2019s high-end market a \u201cmix.\u201d\n\u201cI think some of the properties are just being priced too high, but more than pricing it\u2019s just strategy on how to put these deals together now with the market being more sensitive on the Eastside,\u201d he said.\nProperties priced over $7 million in places such as Los Feliz and Silver Lake require careful strategy. That goes beyond simply factoring in\nMeasure United to House L.A.\n, which Mogharrabi said the market\u2019s generally accepted as part of buying and selling real estate in Los Angeles.\nThe\ntwo-tier tax\napplies a 4 percent levy on city of Los Angeles real estate deals starting at $5.3 million and kicks up to 5.5 percent on trades starting at $10.6 million.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about the market being slow, but there are plenty of buyers looking in this price point and we\u2019ve noticed a pickup for us personally with a lot of our inventory,\u201d he said.\nThat\u2019s a finer distinction that holds across the greater Los Angeles\u2019s high-end market. And, to that point, Mogharrabi said his and Kays\u2019 listing at 7141 Senalda Road in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Outpost Estates just went into escrow. The 1930s-built home counts six beds and seven baths and is asking just under $9 million, or $1,333 per square foot.\nOutpost Estates is the same historic community where Kays and Mogharrabi represented Pitt last August in the actor\u2019s\n$12 million purchase\nof a residence in the area known for its Spanish and Mediterranean designs. They followed up that deal the next month with their representation of Pitt in the off-market sale of his Los Feliz\nMid-Century Modern\nhome, known as\nThe Steel House\n. The property had been listed for $5.5 million, sources told\nThe Real Deal\nat the time of the closing.\n",

        "content": "The site of several demolished properties in Hollywood will become a 33-unit apartment complex from local developer Rom Investments.\nBased on an application submitted to the Los Angeles Department of City Planning, the apartments would rise at 1845 North Taft Avenue, at the corner of Franklin Avenue and north of the 101 freeway,\nUrbanize Los Angeles reported\n. The six-story building would include one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments above non-required parking for 48 vehicles.\nCategory Design Group is the architect on the project, and Alchemy Planning &amp; Land Use is working with the developer. A rendering shows a modern block-style structure in a podium configuration.\nRom Investments, run by Leeor Maciborski and his wife Orly Maciborski, has requested development incentives through the Citywide Housing Incentive Program to build a larger structure than otherwise allowed by zoning rules. The project would bring a mid-rise building to a neighborhood of shorter homes and structures. To qualify for the zoning exemption, Rom would rent four of the units as affordable housing for extremely-low-income tenants.\nROM Investments focuses on \u201ccurating,\u201d via acquisition or development, \u201cunique living spaces\u201d in Los Angeles, particularly the Hollywood market. The company has filed plans for an\n131-unit\napartment complex\nnear the Hollywood/Western Metro stop. It would include 74 studios, 49 one-bedroom apartments and eight two-bedrooms.\nLike the Taft Avenue project, the larger project at 5242 East Carlton Way in East Hollywood involved the demolition of older structures \u2014 in this case, two small multifamily buildings \u2014 and their replacement with a new 138,894-square-foot one.\nThe developer also has a Transit Oriented Communities project at 1807-1809 North Van Ness Avenue in Hollywood. The project replaces a 111-year-old house with five residential units, consisting of two duplexes and one single-family home.\nHollywood has emerged as a hotbed for apartment projects, with recent proposals from\nUncommon Developers\nin Chatsworth and\nKimco Realty\n.\n\u2014\nJoel Russell\n",

While the square footage is modest compared to the massive office leases that define the neighborhood, the deal signals a pivotal shift for the corridor.\nFulton Street Companies, led by Ross Babel and Alex Najem, has pushed to transform the fast-growing office hub and hot residential area into a\nhigh-end shopping destination\n. While brands like Lululemon and Anthropologie have planted flags, the arrival of Rick Owens \u2014 known for gothic minimalism and brutalist aesthetics \u2014 marks the first ultra-luxury brand to set up shop in Fulton Market.\n\u201cRick Owens embodies uncompromising creativity and cultural relevance,\u201d said Shanna Khan, CEO of Shanna Collective and the project\u2019s chief design officer. \u201cWelcoming a world-renowned, avant-garde designer such as Rick Owens creates a platform for bold expression in fashion and the arts.\u201d\nThe retail lease was brokered by Francis X. Scire, Jr., head of retail leasing for The Fulton, in collaboration with Khan. Fulton Street Companies tapped Scire in January to lead its leasing operations and bring in high-end clients. Najem said it was especially enjoyable to witness Owens\u2019 wife, designer Mich\u00e8le Lamy, walk the brand\u2019s new space with Khan and come up with ideas for its eventual presentation and opening.\nRick Owens was represented by Newmark\u2019s Andrew Turf, Jonathan Schley, Aubrie Pettersen and Aubrey Hinkson in collaboration with Chicago-based Canvas Real Estate\u2019s Anthony Campagni and Elan Rasansky.\nThe store will be located within The Fulton, a 535,000-square-foot development that involved the adaptive reuse of the historic Schwinn bicycle factory on Lake Street and the more than $230 million construction of an adjacent 12-story office building immediately to the north on 919 West Fulton Street.\nThe new construction project broke ground in 2023 \u2014 one of the few office developments to do so amid a high-interest rate environment \u2014 and recently completed work, with ongoing interior buildouts for high-end fitness tenant Equinix as well as a Gibson\u2019s restaurant.\nFulton Street Companies has been one of the most active developers in the neighborhood, betting that the area can sustain premium rents despite broader headwinds in the commercial sector. Its 919 West Fulton Street hosts Harrison Street Real Estate as its anchor office tenant, which recently moved its workforce into the building. Najem and Khan\u2019s firms purchased the Lake Street Lofts building next door, where Rick Owens is leasing, for $49 million in 2023.\n",

        "content": "Illinois lawmakers are gearing up to take another swing at one of the most closely watched insurance overhauls in years, reviving a bill that would give state regulators new authority to curb homeowners premium hikes.\nThe push comes after Bloomington, Illinois-based State Farm raised Illinois homeowners rates an average of\n27.2 percent last year\n, citing mounting weather-related losses. Capitol News Illinois\nreported\nthat Gov. JB Pritzker\nseized on the increase\nto call for tighter oversight, arguing insurers shouldn\u2019t be able to shift the cost of disasters in places like California and Florida onto Illinois property owners. In December,\nAllstate announced\nthat it plans an average 8.8 percent hike in Illinois homeowners insurance premiums starting Feb. 24, affecting over 209,000 policyholders, as previously reported in\nThe Real Deal\n.\nA measure granting the Illinois Department of Insurance authority to review and reject excessive rate increases cleared the Senate during the fall veto session, but fell four votes short in the House. Many assumed it was dead, but chief House sponsor Rep. Robyn Gabel refiled a motion to concur, according to the publication, teeing up a potential second vote as the General Assembly returns to Springfield for the 2026 session.\nIndustry groups say they\u2019re bracing for round two. Kevin Martin, executive director of the Illinois Insurance Association, told the outlet that insurers have heard the bill could be called as early as next week.\nAt the heart of the fight is\nIllinois\u2019 status\nas a \u201cuse-and-file\u201d state, allowing insurers to implement new rates immediately and submit them to regulators afterward. Supporters of the bill note Illinois is the only state that lacks a law explicitly barring \u201cexcessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory\u201d premiums and does not require prior approval of rate changes, according to the publication.\nThe proposal would keep the use-and-file framework, but empower regulators to review rates after they take effect and order refunds if they\u2019re found to violate state standards. It would also require 60 days\u2019 notice for hikes of 10 percent or more and mandate the use of Illinois-specific loss data to prevent so-called cost-shifting.\nInsurers argue the measure goes too far, particularly because it sets no time limit on how far back regulators could look when reviewing rates, according to the outlet. They also reject the allegation that out-of-state losses are baked into Illinois premiums.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

And the technology is fueling one of the firm\u2019s fastest-growing businesses: data centers.\nCBRE reported record 2025 revenue of $40.6 billion, up 13 percent, year-over-year, with fourth-quarter revenue rising 12 percent to $11.6 billion. Net income for the year climbed nearly 20 percent to about $1.2 billion. Core earnings per share of $2.73 beat Wall Street estimates.\nData center and digital infrastructure work accounted for roughly 14 percent of CBRE\u2019s pre-tax earnings in 2025, Sulentic said. The firm expects revenue from its data center business to hit $2 billion in 2026, growing at a 20 percent annual clip.\nCBRE has been\nbulking up\naccordingly. In 2024, it bought\ntechnical services firm\nDirect Line Global, and in November closed a $1.2 billion acquisition of Pearce Services from New Mountain Capital, expanding its reach into cooling systems and electrical infrastructure critical to server farms.\nSulentic acknowledged the possibility of an AI-fueled bubble, but added it should be taken into context that five years ago the current amount of data center business was considered unimaginable, and five years from now it is impossible for him to say whether it will grow larger or fizzle.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening is that talent is being used to support the growth of AI,\u201d Sulentic said. \u201cSo we think there\u2019s going to be enduring growth there.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Anti-poverty advocates are using some tricky math to push back on the \u201cabundance\u201d movement as a solution to housing affordability.\nA new\nreport\nby the Center on Poverty and Inequality at Georgetown Law School says that in markets where developers built a lot of housing, rents for low-income units went up more than for other units. The researchers got their study featured in a\nNew York Times\narticle.\nBut the actual rent increases might have been smaller than the report made them seem, and in the context of rising expenses, they should surprise absolutely no one.\nNor are they an argument against adding robustly to housing supply. The researchers, to their credit, don\u2019t reject the abundance strategy. But they do suggest that abundance doesn\u2019t help low-income tenants.\nI agree that very poor people need more than ample supply, because their incomes aren\u2019t enough to sustain any kind of decent housing. That is, they need income support such as rental vouchers.\nBut they also need an ample supply of housing to accommodate people who out-earn them. Otherwise they will be competing with them \u2014 a losing proposition.\nMy first bone to pick with the report is its title: \u201cAbundance for Who?\u201d That\u2019s like fingernails on a chalkboard for me. Would it have killed them to say \u201cAbundance for Whom?\u201d\nThen I took a close look at the\nLinkedIn post\nby Lelaine Bigelow, the executive director of the center behind the study:\n\u201cFor years, the narrative has been simple: just build more housing and prices will come down. But our analysis of six high-growth metros shows it\u2019s not that straightforward.\n\u201cTake Phoenix. The city built aggressively. New units had a vacancy rate over 9%. Yet rents for extremely low-income households jumped 26.7% while rents for high-income households actually fell by 5.3%.\u201d\nThe alleged increase was over eight years, from 2015 to 2023. And the \u201chigh-income\u201d statistic Bigelow cited actually included moderate- and middle-income households. These groups make up the majority of renters.\nThat\u2019s the first reason the study\u2019s numbers are \u2014 to borrow Bigelow\u2019s phrase \u2014 \u201cnot that straightforward.\u201d\nThe bigger reason is that researchers adjusted for inflation not by using the general Consumer Price Index but by using CPI for local rents for the metropolitan area in question.\nStay with me here, people. Math concept ahead!\nRent inflation across the Phoenix market was very low, perhaps even negative, from 2015 to 2023, thanks to aggressive building for moderate- to upper-income families.\nBut that rent inflation makes even modest nominal increases in rents paid by extremely low-income households (earning $30,000 or less) look very large \u2014 in this case, 26.7 percent.\n\u201cIf you told Class C/D operators in Phoenix their rents were up 26.7 percent over that period, they would look at you like you were crazy,\u201d housing economist Jay Parsons\ncommented\nbelow Bigelow\u2019s post.\nLet\u2019s review:\nPhoenix built like crazy, resulting in a real (inflation-adjusted) drop in rents for most households. That\u2019s a clear win for housing affordability.\nBut because so many rents fell, if your household\u2019s rent went up, the relative increase is going to be a big percentage jump.\nAnd why did rents increase for the cheapest units?\nLisa Gomez, CEO of the big New York City real estate firm L &amp; M Development Partners,\nanswered that question\n:\n\u201cIt\u2019s as much about operating expenses as it is about supply,\u201d Gomez wrote on LinkedIn. \u201cEvery area has its own operating economics and you have to have corresponding income to cover them.\u201d\nOwners of the cheapest rental housing are far more sensitive to those increases than at the high end. Those landlords must either raise rents to cover their costs or shutter the unit (which would remove it from the data).\nUnfortunately, the study did not compare rent increases to the increases in operating costs, such as for utilities, insurance, property taxes and maintenance. But they were probably\nlower\n.\nThe bottom line is: in markets with housing abundance, most rents stayed down because of competition. Because operating costs rose, the lowest-income tenants saw rents increase relative to higher earners\u2019 rents. And without abundance to absorb demand for housing, their rents would have gone up a lot more.\n\u201cWe need to do A LOT more to help low-income families access safe, quality housing (more subsidized housing, vouchers, etc.),\u201d Parsons\nwrote\n, \u201cbut simply demanding we build less market rate wouldn\u2019t provide any material boost to these families because those projects aren\u2019t gonna pencil out at the rent levels needed.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The show might have seemed to be over in the Live Music Capital of the World, but there may be an encore.\nAustin drew crowds in the early 2020s as any concerns over the pandemic were more than offset by cheap mortgages, the\ntech industry\u2019s\ninterest in the Lone Star state and remote workers trading\ntight coastal homes for roomier styles\n.\nBy the end of 2025, the bandwagon was long gone. Apartments built for the next wave of festivalgoers met with sparse demand, leading to\nvacancy rates almost double the national average of 8.6 percent\nand\nthe greatest decline in average rent of any of the top 50 metros in the country\nin January. Redfin found this month that\nfour out of five homes in Austin sold below their original listing price last year\n, the biggest share of any major metro in the state and one of the biggest in the country. Even the high end felt the chill: the prestigious Tarrytown neighborhood saw its home values decline year-over-year at a greater rate than any other ZIP code in Austin in 2025, with\naverage sale prices dropping 11 percent\nfrom $1.7 million in 2024 to $1.5 million last year. One high-volume resi team,\nTrinity Texas Realty\n, resorted to hospitality to fill the gap of lower home sales.\nBut loyal Austin fans aren\u2019t leaving the show just yet.\nA closer look at the data reveals persistent demand for Austin apartments, centrally located homes and certain luxury neighborhoods. Austin absorbed 3,177 multifamily units in the fourth quarter of 2025, trailing only New York City, Dallas/Fort Worth, Phoenix and Atlanta nationwide, according to CoStar. Those units represent a hundredth of Austin\u2019s entire multifamily inventory, putting Austin in second place nationally for the strongest absorption as a percentage of supply, trailing Charlotte.\nMeanwhile, the multifamily pipeline has slowed dramatically. CoStar projects a 47 percent decline in unit deliveries this year.\nOn the single-family side, most of the depreciation in the area has taken place in\nexurbs\nlike Round Rock, Kyle and Georgetown, one of the fastest-growing cities in the country three years ago.\nSale prices in Austin city limits generally held flat\n.\nSimilarly, prices in certain luxury enclaves also changed little. The average home sale price wobbled by just one percent between 2024 and 2025 in Westlake, and it actually rose marginally in Downtown.\nOf course,\na vast portion of Austin luxury deals go unrecorded on the Multiple Listing Service\n, obscuring the full picture of top-tier resi trends. The city\u2019s always been a hotspot for hidden gigs, after all.\nCourtroom drama\nColony Ridge \u2014 the Houston-area master-planned community that\u2019s been taking lumps left and right, politically \u2014 received another blow this week.\nSettling a federal lawsuit begun in 2023, the developers of Colony Ridge\nagreed\nto invest $48 million in infrastructure improvements and $20 million in law enforcement support.\nThe Biden administration alleged in the original suit that Colony Ridge targeted Hispanic buyers with deceptive advertising and predatory mortgages. Republican leaders floated suspicions that Colony Ridge was facilitating cartel crime and \u201c\nallowing illegal aliens to run rampant on its streets\n,\u201d according to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.\nDowntown divestiture for Nate Paul?\nMeanwhile, Paxton associate\nNate Paul may soon give up two Downtown Austin properties\n. A court-appointed receiver is negotiating sales of the 0.9-acre warehouse lot at 99 Trinity Street and a three-parcel assemblage near the Austonian condo tower at 201 and 203 Colorado Street.\nTrades and spades in the office sector\nDeals were struck and shovels sunk in the office market recently. McKinley Homes\nbought\nSam Houston Crossing I, a distressed building at 10343 Sam Houston Park Drive in Houston, in December. The Gutow Company\npurchased\nthe 13-story property formerly known as the Atlas Energy Tower at 12001 North Central Expressway in Dallas and disclosed plans to rename it 12001 NCX. Nearby, Hall Group\nbroke ground\nFriday on a $140 million office building in Hall Park, the company\u2019s ongoing development just south of The Star in Frisco.\n",

        "content": "Parking lots can be the most vanilla of commercial real estate assets, but they can be spicy when they\u2019re at the center of a complaint about an alleged conspiracy.\nCriscione Meyer Entitlement, which owns six downtown Los Angeles surface parking lots that total about 69,000 square feet, has sued three parking entities \u2014 all of which appear to be sister companies connected to Richard Ulemann Sr. \u2014\u00a0 over a loan dispute involving said lots near L.A. Live off the 110 Freeway, and have entitlements for redevelopment as affordable residential.\nHere are the twists and turns:\nPlaintiff Criscione Meyer Entitlement (CME) purchased the six parcels from defendant 110 West Properties out of bankruptcy for $22 million five years ago. The purchase price was paid via a loan obtained by CME in the amount of $10 million and secured by a deed of trust. The remaining $12 million was paid via a promissory note payable to the seller, 110 West, and secured by a second deed of trust. Then, CME became a landlord to 110 West, and later to defendants Shamrock Parking and Classic Parking, which the complaint calls \u201cco-conspirators\u201d and \u201calter egos\u201d of Ulemann.\nSome time passed, some extensions on the debt was granted, and CME eventually negotiated a deal to pay off that $12 million loan for just $500,000, per the complaint. CME claims 110 West accepted the $500,000 payoff in writing but then sold its $12 million note on the property to Classic Parking. Classic Parking then refused to honor the $500,000 payoff agreement.\nCME alleges this was a breach of contract and part of a coordinated effort to block the refinancing of five parcels and a sale of one to an electric vehicle fast charging company for about $11 million. (CME accused the lessees and defendants of illegally occupying the space because their lease is up and they owe rent, too).\n\u201cEach of them, knowingly and willfully conspired and agreed to cause financial hardship to CME by inducing 110 West to breach its discounted payoff agreement with CME and instead assign the $12 million note to Classic Parking,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cDefendants, and each of them, furthered the conspiracy and lent aid and encouragement by directing 110 West to repudiate the discounted payoff agreement with CME and instead sell the $12 million note to Classic, thereby aiding and abetting the tortious interference with CME\u2019s contractual rights.\u201d\nThe complaint continues: \u201cThe conduct of defendants in conspiring was, and is, fraudulent, oppressive and malicious.\u201d\nCME wants the court to force defendants to accept $500,000 and release the $12 million deed of trust, keep them from foreclosing while the case is pending and evict them. It also is seeking $5 million in damages.\nThe attorney for the plaintiff and a representative for the three related parking entities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nWhat we know beyond the litigation is that CME has been trying to sell the parking lots for years. The real estate came on the\nmarket\nin Aug. 2023 with an ask of $23 million. A source familiar with the matter said the parcels will trade for less.\nOne of the parcels is in contract and the others are in negotiations, per Patrick Sharples, a broker with Keller Williams via G&amp;S Group, who holds the offering. They could all close later this year, but it\u2019s unclear whether litigation will influence an outcome.\nThe real estate can be redeveloped and, because they\u2019re near L.A. Live, there\u2019s potential for apartments or a hotel. But neither pencil out, according to Sharples. He said he has talked with developers because the parcels are eligible for ED1, an emergency order by Mayor Karen Bass that streamlines the approval process for developments that are 100 percent deed-restricted affordable housing. The numbers didn\u2019t make sense, he said. When it comes to a hotel, the lots aren\u2019t zoned for that, so nothing would be completed before the World Cup or Olympics.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the lots won\u2019t eventually be redeveloped, but they may stay just parking lots for a bit.\nHamlet-esque\nOceanwide Plaza creditors are having their \u201cto be or not to be\u201d moment. After a federal bankruptcy judge greenlit a settlement ending a lender-versus-lender war, creditors have a\nchoice\n: Make their own or joint credit bids and attempt to complete the stalled mega-development or sell it off in hopes of recouping their losses, a person with knowledge of the matter told\nThe Real Deal\n. That decision is imminent, the source said. LA Downtown Investment, funded via EB-5 investors, and Lendlease, the one-time general contractor, are the two major parties. We\u2019ll see if they persist or ditch.\nKilroy trims exposure\nKilroy Realty reported\nearnings\nearlier this week, and a lot of chatter was about a big buy and sale in San Diego, but let\u2019s take a look at Los Angeles. Chief Executive Angela Aman, on the fourth-quarter earnings call, said Los Angeles is where the real estate investment trust has completed most of its portfolio modification after selling 501 Santa Monica and Sunset Media Center in the heart of Hollywood, and buying Maple Plaza in Beverly Hills, which is still one of her best talking points to date. Going forward, however, expect more action as it rejiggers in L.A., where Kilroy still is facing a little more than 400,000 square feet in lease expiration this year.\n",

        "content": "There\u2019s a common belief these days that there\u2019s nowhere left to build in the city.\nBut Rockrose Development\u2019s $100 million purchase of a Brooklyn city block, which closed Friday, shows that\u2019s not entirely true \u2014 it just might not be easy.\nThe sale follows Rockrose dropping $65 million on a neighboring parcel in Cobble Hill that had been the site of many plans and zero apartments. Both sites were once the home of Long Island College Hospital, which Rockrose has now pieced back together.\nAn entity tied to LICH and SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University sold Rockrose the most recent site, which covers 363 Hicks Street, 365 Hicks Street, 97 Amity Street and 340 Henry Street. Newmark\u2019s Dan O\u2019Brien and Jimmy Kuhn brokered the sale.\nMadison Realty Capital owned the other site at 91-95 Pacific Street. The lender had bought it from Fortis Property Group after the developer\u2019s plans for the parcels failed to materialize and it faced foreclosure on its $48 million loan.\nFortis seemed to have bought first and planned second.\nIts initial rezoning vision was shot down by then-City Council member Brad Lander, who was looking for more affordable housing and community benefits than Fortis seemed equipped to provide. Meanwhile, the developer became locked up in a lawsuit with SUNY over what the college claims was Fortis\u2019 failure to close on a second part of the deal that would have served as a medical campus for New York University.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Rockrose may not need to pursue a rezoning and has now pieced together a prime stretch of real estate for a multi-family development. It also successfully navigated the New York State Attorney General\u2019s office, which had to approve the purchase, given the non-profit involved in the sale.\nWhile the deals don\u2019t quite amount to adaptive reuse, they show that there\u2019s still plenty of prime real estate for developers who know what to do with it.\nNow if only there was a new plan for that\nleaning tower in FiDi\n\u2026\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Home sales in January were disappointing and one economist blamed it on the weather. New York has been a tundra as of late, but if somebody\u2019s going to buy a house, is an extra layer really going to stop them? Let me know if I\u2019m wrong by emailing me at\njacob.indursky@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: In the mood for love? Head to the most loveless place on earth, Times Square, where you can watch two engagements and two actual wedding ceremonies on\nValentine\u2019s Day\n. Nothing says romance like a life-size Elmo pointing at his watch because a new couple needs to get married.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 The online prediction market Polymarket launched its free grocery store on Thursday, Curbed\nreported\n. The store is only open through Sunday and stocked with Kirkland-brand olive oil and milk that seemed to have been purchased by a nearby Aldi. One shopper told the outlet they spent 11 hours in line for $120 worth of free groceries.\n\u2014 A Long Island town issued a three-month ban on new pickleball courts, Newsday\nreported\n. Glen Cove\u2019s City Council voted unanimously to prevent residents from putting new courts on their property, mostly to quell complaints about noise. But the courts aren\u2019t gone forever. The local law was put in place so that the city can undertake a \u201cthorough examination of the impacts playing pickleball may pose to city residents.\u201d\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$57 million\nfor 70 Vestry Street, PHS. The Tribeca condo unit is 7,800 square feet.\nThe Modlin Group\u2019s\nAdam Modlin has the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$15.3 million\nfor 158 Lafayette Street. The seven-unit, mixed-use building in Soho is 19,500 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $28.9 million for 217 West 57th Street, Unit 86E. The Midtown Central condo unit is new construction and 4,300 square feet.\nThe Corcoran Group\u2019s\nKane Manera and Janet Wang have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permits filed were for a proposed 40,239-square-foot, three-story building with 59 dwelling units at 480 Rosedale Avenue in Soundview Park.

        "content": "Chikoo Patel and Shai Wolkowicki have once again drawn the wrath of Old National Bank, as the investors face at least the second foreclosure from the lender as their own infighting rages on in multiple court battles.\nOld National Bank filed a foreclosure\nlawsuit this week targeting a mixed-use multifamily and retail property suited for ground-floor medical or dental office space at 316-324 Lake Street in Oak Park, according to public records.\nThe bank alleges that the duo, operating through Halsted South Partners, LLC, defaulted on a debt totaling approximately $2.32 million. According to the complaint, the borrowers failed to make monthly installments starting in November 2025, prompting the lender to accelerate the debt and seek a receiver to take over the property\u2019s management while the court case plays out.\nThe Oak Park filing is just the latest headache for\nPatel and Wolkowicki\n, whose partnership has dissolved into a thicket of litigation and allegations of financial misconduct. Old National is already pursuing a $16 million foreclosure against the pair for a larger multifamily property downstate in Springfield, a case that remains pending in court.\nThe broader collapse began with the implosion of Patel\u2019s firm, CKO Real Estate, which fashioned itself as an experienced property manager prepared to operate South and West Side multifamily buildings in challenging Chicago neighborhoods. It raised money from people who said they depended on CKO to handle repairs, rent collection and working with tenants in affordable housing programs funded by state and federal sources.\nBut multiple investors \u2014 including Wolkowicki and his wife Lauren Lampert, who have Chicago roots but now live in Boca Raton, Florida \u2014 have sued Patel, alleging he misappropriated or \u201cstole\u201d roughly millions of dollars from various businesses. Wolkwowicki and Lampert specifically claim Patel wasted over $10 million in investment capital by mismanaging properties and siphoning funds away from business operations into his own personal accounts.\nThe unraveling has also caught the attention of corporate creditors; American Express recently sued Patel for unpaid credit card debt of more than $63,000 as his firm\u2019s portfolio faced a wave of building code violations and habitability complaints from tenants.\nWolkowicki didn\u2019t return requests for comment and Patel and an attorney for Patel didn\u2019t return requests for comment. Patel\u2019s lawyer has previously said his client denies Wolkowicki\u2019s allegations.\nWhile the two were once frequent collaborators, Wolkowicki has another once-productive relationship that has soured into a legal civil war. Last year, Wolkowicki\nfiled a separate lawsuit pitting him against Mitch Goltz\n, the former partner in their old firm GW Properties, which has been selling off real estate throughout Chicagoland to wind down.\nGoltz, who now heads the firm GTZ Development, declined to comment on the dispute with Wolkowicki, which centers around how Goltz handled the distribution of proceeds from last year\u2019s\n$31 million sale of the Church Street Plaza\nproperty in Evanston. Goltz reiterated a separate\nforeclosure suit he and Wolkowicki are facing on a LaGrange property\nthat remains in the GW portfolio, filed by a venture of Chicago real estate firm Wolcott Group, and is still in the process of being resolved through new financing.\nWhile Wolkowicki deals with the fallout of his distressed multifamily holdings, Goltz is pivoting toward big redevelopment further west into the suburbs. GTZ is in talks to bring an\nAmazon large-store retail format and an Ashley Furniture store\nto an office campus in Oak Brook that his firm\nacquired at a deep discount out of distress\n. The seven office buildings on the property may be torn down to make way for the retailers.\nHowever, legal and financial pressures mark a downturn for Wolkowicki, who previously made headlines for reasons outside of real estate. In 2014, he was a victim in a boating accident on Lake Michigan that killed three of his friends, leaving him stranded on the water only to be discovered the next day. He was the sole survivor who was aboard the watercraft, whose fractional ownership company, insurers and repair company agreed in 2018 to a $27.9 million settlement with Wolkowicki and the estates of the other victims.\nThe next court date in the lawsuit Wolkowicki brought against Patel is scheduled for a March 9 hearing.\n",

        "content": "While the headlines in post-Super Bowl San Francisco were taken up by an extended teachers\u2019 strike that kept children out of school all week, Mayor Daniel Lurie \u2014 whose own frustrations with the strike fed the news cycle \u2014 quietly signed what could end up as one of the most impactful pieces of housing legislation in his tenure.\nOn Thursday, Lurie formally established a new public financing program he hopes will incentivize the conversion of the old office buildings of San Francisco\u2019s urban core into housing. The so-called Downtown Revitalization Financing District will direct increases in property tax revenue toward annual incentive payments for eligible conversion projects. The district\u2019s boundaries include the Financial District, Union Square, and parts of the Market Corridor and SOMA.\nSan Francisco rose as the poster child for the pandemic\u2019s decimation of America\u2019s traditional central business districts. Cities across the country concluded that a resilient downtown meant a transition from a strictly commercial center into a more mixed-use neighborhood. Thus, converting office towers into apartments was viewed as a key strategy. However, these projects proved expensive and logistically complex. Like some other cities, San Francisco has seen zero conversions, despite the hyped up potential.\nThe tax increment financing district set up by Lurie and the San Francisco Board of Supervisors could put more than $1.2 billion of redirected property tax increases into these projects over the next 30 years, according to city documents. The city estimates that about 50 buildings within the district could make for a good conversion, with the potential to add up to 7,000 new homes. One source inside the city\u2019s Office of Economic and Workforce Development\ntold the San Francisco Chronicle\nthat the typical project could receive about $100,000 per unit in incentives.\nYet, conversions are most feasible when the commercial real estate market has hit the floor, and investors can purchase old towers for steep discounts. Over the last year, the city\u2019s\ncommercial real estate market has bounced back profoundly\n. However, much of that activity has been confined to Class A and trophy buildings, which has left mid-to-low tier office towers,\nsuch as the one at 260 California Street,\nwith big question marks looming overhead.\nNew life for capped taxes\nSince it went into effect nearly three years ago,\nMeasure United to House L.A.\nhas drawn the attention of housing developers up and down California. Approved by voters in Los Angeles, ULA, which implements a 4-to-5.5 percent real estate transfer tax on home sales of greater than $5 million, has been criticized for stalling new housing construction in the city. Late last month, the\nLos Angeles City Council rejected proposed amendments to the legislation\n\u2014 which would have to be approved by voters \u2014 that would have carved out exemptions to the tax for multifamily properties.\nThwarted development in Los Angeles has seemed to fuel interest in a statewide limit on local real estate transfer taxes. A petition is now circling the state that asks whether they want to vote capping real estate transfer taxes throughout California. If it qualifies, which the president of the sponsoring Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association told CalMatters he is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about, Californians would vote on the tax cap in November. The League of California Cities estimates the measure, if approved, could trim tax revenue up to $3 billion per year, with the shortfall spread over municipalities big and small.\nYet, it may not be the only citizen-initiated tax limit on the ballot in November. Earlier this week, a petition began making its way through California that would exempt homeowners 60 and older from paying property taxes on their primary residence. According to the Secretary of State\u2019s office, the initiative could cost local governments and school districts up to $20 billion per year.\nCalifornia homeowners already enjoy the benefits of Prop 13. Passed in 1978 after a tax revolt, Prop 13 changed the landscape of homeownership in California, as it tightly limited how much a home\u2019s assessed value could increase. It is essentially rent control for owners. The legislation has resulted in fewer houses hitting the market, and has been cited as exacerbating the state\u2019s housing crisis.\n",

        "content": "Hilton &amp; Hyland\nlost its managing director, and you could call industry reaction to the latest in the brokerage\u2019s saga muted to say the least.\nSteve Katz, who joined the brokerage a\u00a0 little over a year ago, exited quietly shortly after New Year\u2019s Day, and was succeeded by Felix Pena.\nA lack of buzz about the latest twist at Hilton &amp; Hyland calls into question the brokerage\u2019s relevance in the market, and it comes off of what could be viewed as a particularly tough stretch for the business. That includes agent and executive departures, a lawsuit from what is now Hilton &amp; Hyland\u2019s former landlord over alleged unpaid rent, and a move to smaller offices on Maple Drive in Beverly Hills\u2019s Golden Triangle.\nInterestingly, the Maple Drive address is the same building where Hilton Hilton \u2014 the brokerage led by Hilton &amp; Hyland co-founder Rick Hilton \u2014 has set up shop. That business also seems to be at its own inflection point.\nThe Real Deal\nreported earlier this month The Agency poached\nJustin Alexander\nand two of his team members from Hilton Hilton. That\u2019s left the brokerage with an agent headcount of four, according to records pulled from the California Department of Real Estate on Friday.\nOn the primaries\nWant another example of a muted reaction from this past week? Look no further than L.A.\u2019s mayoral race, which saw Fourth District Councilmember\nNithya Raman\n\u2019s last-minute entry about a week ago.\nIf residential real estate cared about this latest development for the June primaries, the industry hid it well.\nRaman, a Democratic Socialists of America member, turned the heads of some within real estate late last month with her proposed\nMeasure United to House L.A.\ncarveouts, which mainly speak to commercial developers. That\u2019s a 15-year exemption from the tax for newly built multifamily, commercial and mixed-use projects. For existing commercial and residential properties, the proposed amendments do little outside a carveout in instances of a natural disaster. This could explain the largely silent reaction to the latest development at city hall.\nStill, when it comes to mayor of Los Angeles, the question is whether the industry\u2019s residential segment will offer a collective \u2014 or at least stronger \u2014 voice on the matter.\nWhat people are saying\nIn residential real estate, market dynamics are often oversimplified to either a buyer\u2019s or seller\u2019s market. What\u2019s playing out right now is more nuanced.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019 Jonathan Mogharrabi and Marci Kays are coming off a busy week in which they closed on\ntwo Los Feliz properties\n. That\u2019s no easy feat in an Eastside market Mogharrabi described as being more \u201csensitive\u201d in terms of deal flow. It\u2019s not that the market is slow, he said. It could be that the sell strategy of other listings may be missing the mark or buyer expectations.\nWhat he\u2019s saying holds weight considering he and Kays just double ended Wednesday\u2019s closing of Fear of God founder and designer Jerry Lorenzo\u2019s Los Feliz home at 2401 Nottingham Avenue for $8.6 million. Then, on Friday, the two represented the buyer and seller on 2720 Glendower Avenue for $7.4 million.\nWhat Mogharrabi is saying lines up with a point Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Nicole Plaxen noted last month when the listing at\n1200 Bel Air Road\nwas reduced to just under $100 million. That price cut wasn\u2019t the result of no buyer interest, she pointed out. Instead, it was about meeting \u201ctoday\u2019s buyer mindset.\u201d\nLA\u2019s condo market\nNext week sales are expected to resume on the former Pendry Residences, now called the\nSun Rose Residences\n.\nThere are a dozen units left at the 40-residence property sitting at 8420 Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood. They\u2019ll be priced from $4.3 million to $8 million and range from 3,010 square feet to 4,656 square feet of interior space.\nCondo building relaunches and resets are not an anomaly in a market often viewed as less mature than New York or Miami. Salespeople like to talk about the demand for security and services at a condo tower that are supposedly boosting local demand, but one can\u2019t turn away from all the about-faces on strategies to sell.\nLast June,\nTRD\nreported on the\nreintroduction\nof the Mandarin Oriental Residences in Beverly Hills and The Harland in West Hollywood. Each property has its own reason for the why behind the retooling. Part of it was a pricing mismatch. Sometimes it comes down to understanding the market and what amenities make sense.\nAll that to say, it will be interesting to see what\u2019s in store for when the Aman Residences \u2014 the ultra-luxe condos at Cain\u2019s\nOne Beverly Hills\nmixed-use project \u2014 are delivered to the market.\n",

Yet, a trial date remains elusive.\nIn 2022, five people were\narrested\nover allegations that former board members hired bogus contractors and diverted payments, including to ex-board President Marglli Gallego and her husband, Jose Gonzalez, who allegedly led some of the fake vendors, court filings say. Three more people \u2013\u2013 two of them Gallego relatives \u2013\u2013 were later\ncharged\n.

Gallego, painted as the ringleader by prosecutors, is the only one still in jail after being\ndenied bond\n.\nSince the initial charges, the West Kendall HOA went through\nreceivership\n, multiple civil suits and board elections.

Sometimes, hearings are postponed, including one for Feb. 6 moved to Tuesday.\n\u201cWe all want a conclusion,\u201d said Ana Danton, one of the roughly 18,000 Hammocks residents.\nAt issue:\nHOA\nfraud cases are massive, involving voluminous evidentiary files, and many witnesses and subpoenas, experts say. The problem is especially pronounced at the Hammocks due to its size and the fact that the HOA kept paper records. The court called it a \u201cmonster\u201d case.\nBy last spring, the state submitted its final evidence, so Judge Laura Cruz called on defense attorneys to schedule depositions and said that continually blaming the amount of paperwork would eventually become\n\u201cproblematic.\n\u201d Gallego\u2019s attorney,\nSabino Jauregui\n, countered the state had years to review files but the defense gets\nmonths.\nHe then filed a motion to disqualify or recuse Cruz, which was denied. (Judge Andrea Ricker Wolfson now presides, which a court spokesperson previously said was due to regular judge rotation.)\nJauregui and most defense attorneys didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Gonzalez\u2019s attorney declined to comment.\nGeorge Pallas, an attorney for\nIvan Dario Diez\n, accused of posing as a vendor, said the state controls the investigation\u2019s pace and built its case \u201cincrementally,\u201d hence Diez\u2019s 2024 arrest, showing \u201cthe probe is still active and evolving.\u201d\n\u201cMy client is entitled to a complete picture of the evidence, not piecemeal revelations that keep extending the proceedings,\u201d said Pallas, who has said Diez did legitimate work and was targeted by others who took plea deals.\nFor Hammocks residents, the protracted case has been years in the making. It took five years after investigators started poking into the HOA for the 2022 charges to be filed.\n\u201cWe want it to end, and it\u2019s been so long,\u201d Danton said.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill California\u2019s wealth tax send even more billionaires fleeing to South Florida?

        "content": "Ron Perelman is one step closer to shedding his worldly possessions.\nThe billionaire sold his Upper East Side townhouse at 36 East 63rd Street for $46.75 million, a source close to the deal told\nThe Real Deal\n. The townhouse had been asking $49.5 million.\nThe Modlin Group\u2019s Adam Modlin and Brown Harris Stevens\u2019 Sami Hassoumi had the listing. Leslie Garfield\u2019s Matt Lesser represented the buyer.\nPerelman listed the home for $60 million in 2021 during a period in which he sold off many of his assets in an attempt to live a \u201csimpler life.\u201d In 2022, he sold his Hamptons estate for\n$84 million\n.\nHis 40-foot-wide Neo Georgian Mansion proved harder to unload, and the listing rotated through a number of the top townhouse brokers in the city.\nPerelman initially tried to sell both the larger home and an attached smaller townhouse for\n$75 million in 2020\n, before listing his 16,000-square-foot house separately in\nApril 2021\n. Both listings were with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Serena Boardman.\nBHS\u2019 Paula Del Nunzio joined as a co-broker several months later. In 2023, John Burger and Sami Hassoumi of BHS\ntook over the listing\nat the same $60 million price tag.\nThe next year, Modlin replaced Burger. He and Hassoumi kept the home priced at $60 million until finally lowering the price to $55 million in October 2024, and then to its last asking price of $49.5 million in June 2025.\nThe property had served as Perelman\u2019s primary residence for years. Built in 1930, it once served as a private club for aviators, known as the Hangar Club. The home has 10 bedrooms and more than 10 bathrooms across its three floors. It has a private screening room, a home gym, a wine cellar and a landscaped roof.\nAt one point in the 1980s, Perelman was considered the richest man in America. His firm, MacAndrews &amp; Forbes, owned a number of high-profile brands, including Marvel Comics and later, Revlon. The firm suffered during the pandemic as Revlon\u2019s share price plummeted from $25 to $5. It was during this time that Perelman sold a number of his personal assets, including planes, yachts and part of his art collection.\nThe townhouse is the latest in what has been a string of marquee Upper East Side homes to sell after years on the market.\nLast year, the\nWoolworth Mansion\nat 4 East 80th Street sold for $38 million after asking as high as $90 million back in 2011. Less than one block away from Perelman\u2019s home, Oleg Cassini\u2019s former townhouse, which one asked $65 million, is awaiting court approval for a sale after receiving\nan offer of $35 million\nlast fall.",

        "content": "High-profile Chicago real estate industry figures are pouring donations into the Cook County Board President\u2019s race, but are showing less of a united front than they are in the\nTax Assessor\u2019s race,\ncampaign finance data shows.\nChicago Alderman Brendan Reilly, who represents much of the Loop and River North, is challenging longtime incumbent Toni Preckwinkle in the Democratic primary for Cook County Board President, which is set for March 17.\nAs final donations roll in, industry leaders including Fifield Companies\u2019 Steve Fifield, Riverside Investment\u2019s John O\u2019Donnell, Hubbard Street Group\u2019s John McLinden, developer Scott Greenberg, Waterton CEO David Schwartz, Equity Commonwealth REIT CEO David Helfand and members of\nbillionaire Neil Bluhm\u2019s family\nare some of Reilly\u2019s most prominent real estate donors. Neil Bluhm, his son Andrew and daughter Meredith Bluhm each gave $17,000 to the Reilly campaign.\nOne of Reilly\u2019s most impactful real estate donors is former Cinespace owner-turned-real estate investor and lender\nAlexander Pissios\nwho gave the campaign $50,000. Other business community donors include trading and real estate investment firm DRW\u2019s founder\nDon Wilson\nand Lettuce Entertain You restaurant group founder Rich Melman.\nWhile Preckwinkle has courted fewer industry heavy-hitters than Reilly, she still secured some donations from prominent real estate names, including\nCapri Investment\u2019s Quintin Primo\nand Clayco\u2019s Michael Fassnacht. She has also enjoyed broad support from construction companies and trade unions like The Chicago Federation of Labor and the International Association of Operating Engineers.\nReilly has raised at least $609,000 since the start of 2026, when his campaign had over $1.2 million on hand, compared to Preckwinkle raising at least $480,000 raised since the start of the year, when she had more than $614,000 in campaign cash, according to state campaign finance reports.\nThe labor and business split is a departure from patterns seen in donations in the Cook County Tax Assessor\u2019s race. Both groups are coalescing around challenger Patrick Hynes instead of incumbent Fritz Kaegi, a recent analysis by\nThe Real Deal\nfound.\nBoth Kaegi and Preckwinkle are supported by progressive organization Citizens Action Illinois. But Preckwinkle hasn\u2019t faced as much public scrutiny as Kaegi, who has borne the brunt of the blame from real estate investors frustrated by\nwild fluctuations in Cook County tax bills\nsince the pandemic. Preckwinkle also secured a $150,000 donation from Governor J.B. Pritzker.\nFurther, she\ncommissioned a study of Chicago\u2019s property tax system\nmore broadly with a goal of making the process more predictable for investors and homeowners alike. Kaegi has said he supports the recommendations in the study, which includes improving communication and data sharing between the tax assessor and the Board of Review so that initial assessments and appealed assessments\ndon\u2019t vary as widely as they do now\n.\nMeanwhile, Reilly, a moderate Democrat on Chicago City Council, is running a critical campaign against Preckwinkle amid backlash against progressives more generally. As Chicago\u2019s progressive\nMayor Brandon Johnson struggles\nto maintain support, real estate figures have been strategizing ways to regain influence in local politics.\nReilly has tried to pin blame on Preckwinkle for recently blown deadlines during a technology update for Cook County\u2019s property tax data and billing systems that severely delayed tax bills. The systemic setbacks causing the late tax bills forced local school districts to incur steep interest costs on loans while they waited for their share of tax revenue.\nReilly even suggested he would cancel the county\u2019s long-running contract with Tyler Technologies \u2014 the firm tasked with the tech upgrade \u2014 if the delays persist.\nPreckwinkle has pushed back against this narrative, noting that the property tax system is a multi-agency effort involving other independently elected officials, like the assessor and treasurer, who handle valuations and billing. She maintains that the solution lies in collaborative problem-solving rather than finding fault or attacking colleagues in other departments.\nHer supporters point out she hasn\u2019t raised Cook County\u2019s portion of the property tax levy for her entire tenure, nearly 16 years.\nWhoever wins the March primary is expected to win the general election in November because Cook County is considered a safely Democratic county.",

        "content": "Billionaire John Goff\u2019s firm, Crescent Real Estate, is locking in fresh debt on one of Uptown Dallas\u2019 signature properties.\nThe Fort Worth-based investor secured a $596 million refinancing for The Crescent, a 1.3 million-square-foot mixed-use complex of three interconnected buildings at 100, 200, 300 and 500 Crescent Court. Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan Chase Bank originated the three-year, floating-rate CMBS loan, with JLL Capital Markets arranging it, Commercial Property Executive\nreported\n.\nCrescent\nbought the 10-acre property in 2021 from J.P. Morgan Asset Management for $700 million, or roughly $495 per square foot, according to Yardi Matrix. At the time, Goldman provided a $465 million acquisition loan. Los Angeles-based Gibson Dunn advised Goldman on the latest refinancing.\nLast year,\nCrescent paid\n$292 million for the 21-story\nTexas Capital Center\n, at 2000 McKinney Avenue, in what was the city\u2019s largest office deal in years and the second biggest deal in Dallas-Fort Worth in 2025.\nCompleted in 1983, The Crescent includes three LEED Gold-certified office towers totaling 1.2 million square feet, plus a 167,510-square-foot retail and atrium component, according to the publication. The 18-story and 19-story buildings feature 30,500-square-foot floorplates and a roster of blue-chip tenants, including Jefferies, BankUnited, BMO Harris Bank, Wells Fargo, PNC Bank, Raymond James, UBS, Regus and Dentons. The property was 90 percent leased at closing.\nBeyond office space, the complex functions as a mini mixed-use district. Amenities include a fitness center, art gallery, two salons and a 3,600-space parking garage, according to a news release. The site is also home to 11 restaurants, the Hotel Crescent Court and its adjoining spa.\nElsewhere in Uptown, Crescent closed on CBRE\u2019s 19-story headquarters at\n2100 McKinney Avenue\nin December, with $170.4 million in financing.\nThe refinancing for The Crescent comes as Dallas\u2019 office market shows tentative signs of stabilization. In December, average asking rents hit $32 per square foot, up 2.8 percent, year-over-year, though slightly below the national average of $33, according to Yardi Matrix. Vacancies fell from the same period a year earlier to 21.1 percent \u2014 still above the 18.4 percent national rate, but part of a broader trend that saw 17 of the top 25 U.S. office markets post year-over-year vacancy declines in 2025.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "There\u2019s not much left of Harwood District that still belongs to\nHarwood International\n; after March\u2019s foreclosure sale, there may be even less.\nGabriel Barbier-Mueller\u2019s beleaguered Uptown development firm risks losing a block of condo units at Bleu Ciel, at 3130 North Harwood Street. It marks the first foreclosure of the year for the firm which gave up ownership of seven office properties in 2025 in a spate of foreclosures and sales.\nThe company\u2019s latest predicament involves an alleged default on a loan from TexasBank, according to a foreclosure notice. Loan documents show TexasBank provided a $30 million loan in December 2024 backed by 26 units at Bleu Ciel. Since the loan was provided, at least six units were sold, causing Harwood to be relieved of parts of its debt burden.\nHowever, the fact that Harwood still owns any condos at the property appears to indicate that about 10 percent of the property\u2019s 158 units never originally sold \u2014 eight years after Bleu Ciel opened in 2018. The property\u2019s website says it\u2019s 85 percent sold and advertises 16 units, including four penthouses.\nThis is the first time Harwood\u2019s distress has bled from its office portfolio into another asset class.\nIt comes a week after San Francisco-based private equity fund TPG announced it would be\nHarwood\u2019s recapitalization partner\n. Harwood quietly sold off five office properties, totalling 1.2 million square feet, to TPG starting in the fall:\nHarwood No. 2, at 2728 North Harwood Street;\nHarwood No. 3, at 2727 North Harwood Street;\nHarwood No. 6 (also known as Saint Ann Court), at 2501 North Harwood Street;\nHarwood No. 7 (also known as Frost Tower), at 2950 North Harwood Street; and\nHarwood No. 10, at 2850 North Harwood Street.\nTPG has plans to renovate the properties. According to the announcement, Harwood retains a minority stake.\nThe firm also lost two properties to foreclosure in 2025.\nIt handed back the keys to\nHarwood No. 4\nin April and lost\nHarwood No. 1\nin November. San Francisco-based Spear Street Capital took back Harwood No. 4, at 2828 North Harwood Street, in a $73 million credit bid.\nFirst United Bank seized\nHarwood\u2019s first development, at 2651 North Harwood Street, with a $27 million credit bid. Bill Cawley\u2019s\nCawley Partners bought the property\non Dec. 30.\nThe\nforeclosures started with Harwood No. 6\n, which Harwood saved from a January 2025 auction with a last-minute recapitalization deal.\nAnother blow came for the company when Jones Day, which was supposed to anchor the upcoming Harwood No. 15,\npulled out of the project\nlate last year.\nThe firm\u2019s distress is glaringly out of sync with Uptown\u2019s otherwise robust office market. The submarket has been a reliable outlier in a region that continues to struggle with\nhigh vacancy rates\n.\nThe coveted submarket has become synonymous with\nY\u2019all Street\n, with banks like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America selecting Uptown for expensive built-to-suit projects. Uptown also boasts the highest rents of any submarket in Dallas-Fort Worth, with an overall average gross rent of $62.21 per square foot, according to a recent report from Partners Real Estate.\n",

Opened in 1976, the Fairfield plant has operated for nearly 50 years as a major brewing, packaging and distribution hub, occupying a prominent site visible from Interstate 80.\nThe shutdown follows a wave of industrial pullbacks across the region from other manufacturers including USS-Posco Industries in Pittsburg, Valero\u2019s refinery in Benicia and the Mare Island dry dock.\nAnheuser-Busch announced the Fairfield closure in December as part of a broader restructuring of its U.S. manufacturing footprint, which also includes shuttering a plant in Merrimack, New Hampshire, and selling its Newark, New Jersey, facility.\nCompany officials said production from the three sites has been shifted to other U.S. breweries following nearly $2 billion in nationwide manufacturing investments.\nCity Manager David Gassaway said officials are already exploring potential reuse options for the highly specialized site, though redevelopment could prove challenging.\n\u201cTo be clear, I don\u2019t think it will be an easy task given the large and highly specialized nature of the facility,\u201d Gassaway said. \u201cI hope I\u2019m wrong though.\u201d\nThe complex spans more than 1 million square feet across 10 parcels and includes solar and gas power infrastructure as well as two wind turbines. Nearby, California Forever is planning a large-scale development east of the brewery along Highway 12.\nState filings show 238 Fairfield employees received layoff notices, per the Business Times, though the company said workers were offered transfers to other facilities. Fairfield Mayor Catherine Moy warned the impacts extend further, estimating that more than 500 workers at auxiliary companies could also be displaced, with millions in lost tax revenue for the city and state.\n\u2014\nLauren Elkies Schram\n",

        "content": "After less than a year with a development startup, Caitlin Chagan is returning to Douglas Elliman.\nThe former development marketing executive, who\nleft the firm\nafter a decade-long stint, is joining the brokerage once again, this time as the president of Douglas Elliman Development Marketing in New York.\n\u201cThis is really a homecoming for me,\u201d said Chagan, whose previous roles at Elliman included managing its Brooklyn portfolio and the Eklund-Gomes Team\u2019s portfolio. \u201cI left, I explored, and I came back more convinced than ever.\u201d\nChagan exited Elliman in July to serve as a co-founder and managing partner of Redeavor, a development advisory firm\nlaunched early last year\nby executives from the Agency, Official Partners, ST Residential and Formida Capital. While at Redeavor, Chagan was tasked with heading up the firm\u2019s expansion to the New York market.\nThe firm does not appear to have any active projects in the region, according to its website. Among its projects are the Ritz Carlton Residences and Hotel in Houston, Texas, the Pendry Residences in Nashville, The Ainsley in West Hollywood and other developments in California and Las Vegas.\n\u201cI left [Elliman] back in July really to pursue a vision, and that vision was to create the best in class services to my clients,\u201d Chagan said. She added that after a few months with Redeavor, she realized, \u201cthe only place that I could have that vision truly realized is back here.\u201d\nMike Leipart, a Redeavor co-founder and managing partner, said in a statement that he and his partners were \u201cbig fans\u201d of Chagan and \u201cappreciate her contributions\u201d to the team.\n\u201cThis is an incredible opportunity, and we wish her continued success as she returns to Douglas Elliman,\u201d Leipart said.\nBack at Elliman, Chagan will oversee all New York operations for the firm\u2019s new development arm, including jumping in on existing projects as well as working on the pre-development of upcoming developments in the city, Long Island, the Hamptons and Westchester. Her position as president is a new one for the company, which is run on a national scale by longtime Elliman executive,\nSusan de Fran\u00e7a\n.\nElliman CEO Michael Liebowitz billed Chagan\u2019s move as a \u201cbig victory\u201d for the firm, which has lost several of its top agents and leaders following the\nabrupt retirement\nof Elliman\u2019s longtime leader, Howard Lorber, in October 2024. Liebowitz took the helm shortly after with the promise of\nushering in a \u201cnew era\u201d\nfor the firm.\nLiebowitz said that establishing Chagan as a leader in the New York region joins his efforts to double down on the company\u2019s development sector, which he described as Elliman\u2019s \u201cmarquee crown jewel.\u201d He added that the firm plans to invest in its New York operations specifically.\n\u201cDevelopers are demanding, and we want to meet that demand,\u201d Liebowitz said. \u201cI\u2019m bullish on New York. New development in New York is going to be much stronger than people believe.\u201d\n",

The 10-year deal spans the entire 37th floor and part of the 36th floor at the 42-story tower. The asking rent was not disclosed.\nJLL\u2019s Lisa Kiell and Andrew Coe represented the tenant in the deal, which was first reported by the New York Post.

The property has faced a wave of turnover over the past few years after\nseveral major tenants\nvacated nearly 700,000 square feet across 25 floors.\nRecent lease signings and pending deals leave just 24,000 square feet of that rollover space to backfill, CEO Marc Holliday said during the firm\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call.\nThe rebound comes as Sixth Avenue emerges as one of Manhattan\u2019s strongest submarkets, with rents rising thanks to constrained supply along Park Avenue.\nManhattan office leasing\nposted its strongest quarter at the end of last year since before the pandemic.\n\u201cSixth Avenue is the new Park Avenue,\u201d Holliday said. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing rents rise dramatically on the avenue, given the tightening of supply.\u201d\nLeasing activity jumped more than 25 percent quarter-over-quarter to 11.9 million square feet, the borough\u2019s most active quarter since late 2019.Demand surged, availability tightened and rents pushed higher across much of the city, according to Colliers data.\nLocated between West 46th and West 47th streets in the Plaza District, 1185 Sixth Avenue sits steps from Rockefeller Center and major transit hubs. SL Green overhauled the 1.1 million-square-foot 1971 building with a newly-renovated entryway, lobby, elevator cabs and corridor to compete with gleaming new developments.\nGroombridge, Wu, Baughman &amp; Stone did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",

        "content": "The family of former Texas state Sen. Don Huffines quietly acquired the late Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s infamous Zorro Ranch in New Mexico in 2023, four years after the disgraced financier\u2019s death in federal custody.\nA limited liability company tied to the Huffines family bought the property at public auction in 2023 for an undisclosed price. The purchase was first\nreported\nby the Santa Fe New Mexican, which cited public records obtained through information requests. According to the paper, proceeds from the sale benefited Epstein\u2019s victims, the Texas Tribune\nreported\n.\nAs previously reported in\nThe Real Deal\n, San Rafael Ranch LLC was\nregistered\nwith New Mexico\u2019s secretary of state office in July of 2023, though its tie to the Huffines family was not revealed at the time.\nThe property, in southern Santa Fe County, features a 26,700-square-foot\u00a0 mansion, private airstrip, hangar, helipad, ranch office, firehouse and heated garage as part of the expansive ranch.\nThe Huffines purchasing entity later challenged the ranch\u2019s tax valuation, arguing it should be reduced to $13.4 million in part because of the property\u2019s \u201cnotoriety,\u201d according to the New Mexican. The records obtained by the publication show the property was renamed in 2024 to San Rafael Ranch and its address is now 49 Rancho San Rafael Road, near Stanley, New Mexico.\nIn a statement Friday, Huffines\u2019 campaign spokesperson Allen Blakemore said the family had \u201cnever visited the property\u201d before it was listed, and purchased it four years after Epstein\u2019s death. In a follow-up statement Monday, Blakemore added that the family has not been contacted by authorities about searching the ranch, but would cooperate if asked.\nAlthough he was never charged in New Mexico, the state\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office had confirmed an investigation into\nEpstein\u2019s activities\nat the ranch. The renewed scrutiny comes after emails recently surfaced alleging that two girls may be buried at or near the property, prompting calls from New Mexico officials for federal and state authorities to open a probe.\nThe deal surfaced as Huffines campaigns for\nTexas comptroller\n, the state\u2019s chief financial officer overseeing taxes and investments. News of the ranch\u2019s ownership also comes as the U.S. Department of Justice released the latest tranche of documents tied to\nEpstein\nrevealing more of the billionaire\u2019s ties to the elected officials and other notable leaders.\nHuffines previously lost a 2022 primary challenge to Gov. Greg Abbott and now faces Acting Comptroller Kelly Hancock, Michael Berlanga and Railroad Commissioner Christi Craddick in the March 3 Republican primary. A poll released this week shows Huffines leading ahead of early voting.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Pakistan is back to square one with its attempt to sell the multi-billion-dollar\nRoosevelt Hotel\nproject site.\nThe government\u2019s privatization commission is once again trying to find a broker to help monetize the development site at 45 East 45th Street, just across from Grand Central Terminal \u2014 which could be redeveloped into a 1.8 million square foot office tower.\nThe commission put out a call for brokers and financial advisors who have \u201cproven experience of successful completion of similar transactions in [the] New York metropolitan area (more specifically in Manhattan\u2013NYC) or any other metropolitan city of [the] USA,\u201d according to a request for proposals.\nThe 1920s era, 1,205-room hotel is a prime office development site that\u2019s available at a time when\ndevelopers\nare\neager\nto build new commercial towers for tenants willing to pay a premium for the newest, best spaces. But the new RFP comes after a few failed attempts to come up with a deal for the site over the past year.\nThe Pakistani government in 2024 hired JLL to market the property either for an outright sale or a joint venture development partnership. JPMorgan kicked the tires and\nShahal Khan\u2019s Burkhan World Investments\npitched a plan to co-develop the site.\nBut no agreement materialized and in July JLL resigned. The company cited a conflict of interest from clients who were interested in bidding on the site. But considering that brokerages deal with that potential conflict every day, the explanation was seen as a gracious way for both sides to part ways.\nPakistani officials at that time said they were intent on fast-tracking the process of hiring a new advisor, and in late November, it was reported that a team of CBRE and Morgan Stanley was the frontrunner to win the assignment. The Pakistani government said there was increased interest in the site after New York City terminated its contract to use the hotel as a migrant shelter.\nBut in January the privatization commission announced that it had hit reset on the hiring process after five of the seven proposals under consideration were rejected for non-compliance. (It\u2019s not clear who the candidates were, but when JLL won the process in 2024, a consortium led by Savills came in second place.)\nAnd this time around, the government has ruled out selling the property outright.\nPakistani prime minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s adviser on privatisation, Muhammad Ali, said the government is intent on redeveloping the property as part of a JV, according to\nmedia reports\n.\nUnder the plan the government would contribute the land into the venture and a development partner would pony up about $1 billion in equity, with the JV taking on another $2 billion to $3 billion in debt. The Pakistani government intends to have an ownership stake of around 40 to 50 percent.\nMany in New York\u2019s development community, however, remain skeptical as Pakistan\u2019s bureaucratic government has waffled over what to do with the hotel since acquiring it in 2000.\nPakistan is privatizing the Roosevelt along with other government-owned assets as part of a $7 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.\n",

        "content": "A 24-acre office campus in the Irvine Business Complex is due for a residential conversion after it sold for $232.1 million, fetching more than double\nits last sale price\nin one of Orange County\u2019s largest recent land sales.\nA joint venture of TPG Angelo Gordon and Essential Housing Asset Management, an affiliate of\nMiami-based homebuilder\nLennar, acquired the former Von Karman Creative Campus from IRA Capital, according to\nTraded\n. The nine-building campus totals roughly 433,000 square feet, putting the deal at $536 per square foot.\nThe deal closes the book on a yearslong effort to transform the aging property into a residential neighborhood, as the entitled site will be redeveloped into over 400 homes.\nA Lennar spokesperson\ndeclined to comment\non the sale to the Orange County Business Journal, but IRA Capital officials confirmed that Lennar will build homes on the site.\nBuilt in 1988, the campus once served as a high-end office complex, but demand never fully recovered after the pandemic.\nIrvine-based IRA bought it in 2023 for $102.4 million from EQ Office, a Chicago unit of New York-based Blackstone. At the time, Kasm told the\nBusiness Journal\n: \u201cThe value of this property is in the land.\u201d\nInitial plans called for an industrial redevelopment. City officials later urged IRA to pivot toward housing as Irvine faced mounting state housing mandates.\nThe city conditionally offered to buy the site for more than $300 million if housing failed to materialize \u2014 a backstop that helped ensure a residential outcome. Ultimately, IRA secured entitlements for 426 homes, including detached houses, townhomes and stacked flats, in what IRA said was an unusually fast approval process.\nIrvine Mayor Larry Agran called the project a step forward in the city\u2019s long-term vision for the business complex, which was rezoned to allow up to 15,000 homes.\nConstruction is expected to begin within months, with completion targeted in 18 to 24 months.\nThe joint venture\u2019s purchase ranks among the most expensive single-property deals in Orange County in recent times. Five Point Holdings sold 326 home sites in Great Park Neighborhoods during the third quarter of 2025,\nfor $257.7 million\n. In April, Miami-based Crescent Heights\npaid $240 million\nfor Essex Property Trust\u2019s 350-unit Skyline at MacArthur Place in Santa Ana, per Commercial Observer.\n\u2014\nLauren Elkies Schram\n",

        "content": "The prospect of builder\u2019s remedy could return to San Francisco, and one prominent city official wants to get ahead of the possibility by dedicating more funding and land to residential development if necessary.\nSupervisor Chyanne Chen, one of 11 members of the Board of Supervisors, which functions as the legislative body for the city, recently called for an audit of where the city stands on its goals for affordable housing, the\nSan Francisco Business Times reported\n. Inherent in the request is a check-up on whether the city is in line to meet the state-imposed mandate of 47,000 new units of housing by 2031. Missing the mandate, known as the \u201chousing element,\u201d would\ntrigger builder\u2019s remedy\n, which allows developers to skip local zoning approvals provided they include a certain amount of affordable housing in their projects.\nChen said the city\u2019s funds for affordable housing are largely committed or exhausted and noted the cuts to the minimum requirements on how many affordable units must be included in new projects have reduced affordable housing production. A cut in fees has, meanwhile, put a dent in funding, she said.\nChen called for the city to gauge where it stands on meeting its goals under the housing element as the Family Zoning Plan initiated by Mayor Daniel Lurie starts to take effect. The plan would allow significantly more residential development in designated areas of the city, but faces legal challenges.\nPlanning Director Sarah Dennis-Phillips said city staff will report on Chen\u2019s request by the end of the month, with a hearing\u00a0 to review production and funding levels slated for March.\nA recent report by the city noted that the rise in interest rates in recent years and increases in construction costs have put a damper on the development of affordable housing. The city also faces a $1 billion budget deficit.\nChen said the plan San Francisco devised to meet its state mandate on housing included more than 200 policies billed as \u201cadvancing equity\u201d and boosting \u201cpublic investment in affordable units,\u201d but is failing to make full use of them.\n\u201cI am disappointed to see that implementation of these equity-oriented policy actions has been incomplete, opaque and often delayed,\u201d Chen told the Business Times.\n\u2014 Jerry Sullivan\n",

The Chicago Tribune\nreported\nthat they\u2019re now trying to offload their longtime perch atop One Magnificent Mile, listing their 46th-floor penthouse at 950 North Michigan Avenue for $5.5 million after a recent price cut.\nThe Bayers first listed the six-bedroom, roughly 9,000-square-foot duplex penthouse in September for just under $6 million before trimming the asking price in January. The unit carries monthly homeowners association dues of $12,081.\nDesigned by Wheeler Kearns Architects, the condo has seven-inch-wide European white oak floors, Grigio Piesantina limestone, a Crestron lighting system and a sculptural staircase framed by floor-to-ceiling windows, according to the outlet. The great room includes a custom burl wood wet bar and glass wine room, opening to a private terrace. The Valcucine kitchen is outfitted with Sub-Zero and Miele appliances.\nUpstairs, a second-level \u201cwellness and entertainment sanctuary\u201d features a sunroom with a marble-clad wet bar. The primary suite includes a sitting area and two custom walk-in closets. In total, the home has eight full bathrooms and three half baths.\nRyan Preuett and Tim Salm\nof Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty have the listing. The pair also represented the sellers of the Dickens Avenue mansion. It closed at $14.25 million, or about $950 per square foot. The previous owners \u2014 retired Chicago Trading Company executive Paul Kepes and his wife Monica \u2014 spent $20 million to buy the land and build the Lincoln Park property.\nSusan Miner of Premiere Relocation represented the Bayers in that purchase. At the time, the home\u2019s $15 million list price made it the second priciest listing in the city, following a Park Tower penthouse owned by billionaire\nKen Griffin\nlisted at $15.75 million.\nThe couple assembled their\nStreeterville duplex penthouse\nin stages between 2010 and 2014, a period when ultra-luxury condo development along North Michigan Avenue was still regaining its footing post-recession.

The commercial mortgage-backed securities debt totaled $36.5 million when originated a decade ago but has a current balance of about $33 million via three loan pieces. The borrower reached out to lenders to pay the debt, according to recent servicer commentary, but indicated there could be a potential issue as a new loan would fall significantly short.\nJade\u2019s latest Los Angeles time bomb at 1950 Sawtelle Boulevard is a three-story, 100,000-square-foot, red-brick building \u2014 and it has a vacancy problem. The property was only 43 percent occupied last summer. Its largest tenant, Butterfield Productions, reduced its space by 10 percent, to 32 percent of the gross leasable area, and another Kung Fu Factory left, leaving 14 percent of the space vacant, according to Morningstar. The borrower said it was in discussions with a tenant for a large portion of the vacant space, recent servicer commentary noted . The office building (that can be used for medical or some retail, per a recent JLL marketing brochure) was 94 percent occupied at underwriting, and it was part of a portfolio buy in 2016.\nJade\npurchased\na five-office building portfolio including the Sawtelle property that totaled 350,000 square feet, from Blackstone for a reported $159 million then. The other offices were all on the Westside, in Beverly Hills, Santa Monica and Culver City. The Sawtelle office building hasn\u2019t received a fresh appraisal since 2016, when it was worth $54 million, per Morningstar.\nDowntown Los Angeles-based Jade Enterprises has seen its fair share of post-pandemic office distress. In 2024, it put a mostly vacant office tower in downtown Los Angeles on the\nmarket\nafter purchasing it for $80 million and spending millions more on renovations. Last year, the investment and development company\nfaced\nforeclosure on an office building in Pasadena after a $40 million debt default and an appraisal that slashed the property value in half.\nJade Enterprises and Taban did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "A planned 1 million-square-foot ICE detention hub in southern Dallas County is off the table for now.\nMajestic Realty Company said Monday it will not sell or lease its Hutchins warehouse to the federal government, backing away from discussions that would have converted the property into one of the largest migrant detention centers in the country,\naccording\nto the Dallas Morning News.\n\u201cGod answered our prayers,\u201d Hutchins Mayor Mario Vasquez told the outlet after learning of the decision.\nU.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, who represents the congressional district that includes Hutchins, released a statement that her office had not received communication from the Department of Homeland Security or ICE regarding the detention center, but that her office has remained in close contact with city officials and other regional elected officials \u201cto ensure a unified and informed response.\u201d\nInternal ICE documents had identified the Majestic-owned PointSouth Logistics &amp; Commerce Centre Building 1, at 950\nI-45 North\n, as a candidate to house up to 9,500 migrants as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s renewed mass deportation push. The facility was one of four proposed new detention centers in Texas, alongside sites in El Paso and San Antonio that the Department of Homeland Security has already acquired, according to the publication.\nIn January,\nmultiple outlets reported\nthat DHS had purchased the Hutchins warehouse with plans to retrofit it for detention use. Majestic pushed back this week, saying it had been contacted about a potential sale but \u201chas not and will not\u201d enter into an agreement with DHS for use as a detention facility. The City of Industry, California-based firm confirmed it still owns the building.\nA Majestic Realty listing for the address shows a building of just over 1 million square feet, aligning with earlier descriptions. The Dallas Central Appraisal District values the property at $80.1 million.\nThe reversal highlights the political and reputational tightrope\nindustrial landlords\nface, as federal agencies look to repurpose big-box logistics space for nontraditional uses. A document from the project\u2019s builder shows the warehouse was originally designed for Amazon. Vasquez said he warned the company that turning the property into a detention center would \u201cdevastate\u201d Hutchins, a small city that has leaned on warehouse development for tax base growth.\nMajestic framed its decision as part of a broader economic strategy, saying it looks forward to finding a buyer or tenant that will \u201chelp drive economic growth.\u201d The firm is one of the largest privately held developers of master-planned business parks in the U.S., with more than 400 buildings totaling about 92 million square feet nationwide. In North Texas, it\u2019s perhaps best known for its role in redeveloping the\nFort Worth Stockyards\n.\nCommunity opposition also played a role. Local leaders warned that Hutchins lacks the water and sewer capacity to support what would effectively double its population overnight, as previously reported in\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe Rev. Eric Folkerth of Kessler Park United Methodist Church told the Dallas Morning News that local pressure and outrage likely influenced the outcome, questioning the need for a \u201cmega center\u201d amid reports that thousands without criminal records would be detained at the site.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "To plug a more than $5 billion budget gap, Mayor Zohran Mamdani sees two options: Either raise taxes on corporations and New York\u2019s wealthiest or increase property taxes by 9.5 percent while tapping into the city\u2019s reserves.\nGov. Kathy Hochul has rejected the former, which requires state action, and the latter, which Mamdani unveiled Tuesday as part of his administration\u2019s preliminary budget, swiftly drew criticism from landlord groups.\n\u201cThis proposal, coupled with Mamdani\u2019s pledge to freeze rents for four years, virtually guarantees the physical destruction of tens of thousands of units of housing,\u201d Kenny Burgos, CEO of the New York Apartment Association, said in a statement.\nJim Whelan, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, said \u201ctax hikes of any kind, including increases to an already egregiously regressive property tax system, to raise revenue or plug budget holes is a non-starter.\u201d\nAnn Korchak, board president of Small Property Owners of New York, said that owners of small rental properties \u201care sick and tired of being treated like ATM machines every time the city needs to balance the budget.\u201d\nWhen presenting his $127 billion preliminary budget, the mayor said that his administration will do everything in its power to avoid the second path, calling raising property taxes the \u201ctool of very last resort.\u201d\n\u201cThe second path is painful,\u201d Mamdani said on Tuesday. \u201cWe will continue to work with Albany to avoid it.\u201d\nHochul didn\u2019t include the mayor\u2019s proposal to increase taxes on corporations or those earning more than $1 million in her own executive budget, and hasn\u2019t shown any appetite for taking up either cause. On Tuesday, she told reporters that she also doesn\u2019t support raising property taxes.\nThe city\u2019s property tax rates ranged from 10.8 to 19.8 percent in fiscal year 2026. The administration estimates that a 9.5 percent increase across the city\u2019s four property classes will increase revenues by $3.7 billion in the next fiscal year.\nThe prospect of property tax hikes comes after Hochul and Mamdani announced on Monday that the state would allocate another $1.5 billion to the city over the next two years, $510 million of which is recurring funding stemming from costs that had shifted from the state to the city in previous years.\nBut that still left the city with an estimated $5.4 billion deficit for fiscal years 2026 and 2027.\nThe mayor\u2019s preliminary budget dips into the city\u2019s rainy day fund, taking $980 million in fiscal year 2026 and $229 million from the city\u2019s Retiree Health Benefit Trust in fiscal year 2027. Taking into account $1.2 billion in general reserves used to bring down the deficit, along with the $980 million in rainy day funds targeted by the mayor\u2019s budget, the city expects to log $6.3 billion in reserves for fiscal 2026, down from a reserve originally pegged at $8.5 billion. For 2027, again accounting for general reserves ($1.1 billion, leaving only $100 million for in-year funds) and a planned raid of the retiree trust, that number is expected to drop to $6.1 billion.\nUsing reserves is a one-time fix that leaves the city with a smaller cushion in the event of recession or other crises. The mayor indicated that the rainy day fund and retiree trust would be replenished by fiscal year 2028, though doing so could be complicated by future economic pressures.\n\u201cAssuming the city will replenish the funds in FY28, when the budget shows a $6.7 billion gap, is at best extremely tenuous and at worst a gamble,\u201d Andrew Rein, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, said in a statement.\nEven as he laid out the possibility of raising property taxes, Mamdani reiterated that his administration plans to send Albany a proposal to reform the city\u2019s property tax system in the next few weeks. Sherif Soliman, director of the mayor\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, said the proposed bill would build on the recommendations laid out in the 2021 report by the city\u2019s Advisory Commission on Property Tax Reform. He noted the commission\u2019s recommendation to eliminate assessed value growth caps and use sales-based market value to assess condos and co-ops.\nThe mayor also reiterated that the plan is not final.\nCity Council leadership believes there are additional areas of savings and revenue \u201cthat deserve careful scrutiny\u201d before increasing property taxes.\n\u201cAt a time when New Yorkers are already grappling with an affordability crisis, dipping into rainy day reserves and proposing significant property tax increases should not be on the table whatsoever,\u201d Speaker Julie Menin and Council member Linda Lee, chair of the Committee on Finance, said in a joint statement.\nComptroller Mark Levine also said the city needs to search for other sources of savings, indicating that the mayor\u2019s plan might not be enough to bridge the budget gap because it assumes \u201can aggressive revenue projection,\u201d and presumes that the city will not move forward with the\nplanned expansion\nof CityFHEPS rental assistance.\n\u201cDrawing down reserves during a period of economic growth would leave us vulnerable to economic turbulence next year,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "Legion Investment Group and Nahla Capital\u2019s Upper East Side development snagged the two priciest deals inked in Manhattan last week.\nThe condos at 1122 Madison Avenue topped a busy period for the borough\u2019s luxury market, where buyers signed 31 contracts for properties asking $4 million or more between Feb. 9 and Feb. 15, according to Olshan Realty\u2019s report. The total followed\nanother banner week\n, during which 36 luxury Manhattan homes entered contract, including 13 properties asking $10 million or more.\nThe most expensive unit to land an inked deal was the 18th floor of the 26-unit development, which had an asking price of $39 million. The apartment spans 5,300 square feet and has five bedrooms and five bathrooms. It also features two balconies, 11-foot ceilings and views of Central Park.\nThe building\u2019s 16th floor, asking $36.5 million, snagged the No. 2 spot in the report. The unit\u2019s layout is similar to the 18th floor, though its two balconies total more than 170 square feet instead of 150 square feet.\nThe developers launched sales at the building last month with a team from Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, led by Cathy Franklin, and have already found buyers for 16 condos. Just a week into selling, the development\nnabbed the top spot\nin Olshan\u2019s weekly report when a buyer signed a contract to purchase Unit 11 North, which was asking just under $15 million.\nLegion and Nahla shelled out $95 million between 2019 and early 2024 to assemble six parcels for the development site. The duo scored\n$195 million\nin construction financing from Deutsche Bank JVP Management in August 2024.\nThe building\u2019s planned amenities include a fitness center with a squash court, cold plunge pool and sauna, as well as a bar, media room and billiards room. Construction is expected to be completed in the fall of 2027.\nThe 1122 Madison condos aren\u2019t Legion\u2019s first rodeo on the Upper East Side. The firm also developed 109 East 79th Street, which marked its founder and CEO Victor Sigoura\u2019s\nfirst major Manhattan project\nafter he left his executive post at Naftali Group in 2016. A penthouse at the development sold to investment banker Joseph Rallo and his wife, Ashley, for\n$25 million\nin 2023.\nDown in Miami Beach, Nahla, led by Genghis Hadi, paid $270 million to buy the\nRaleigh Rosewood Residences\nfrom its former development team led by Michael Shvo. Its other New York-based projects have included 221 West 77th Street and 152 Elizabeth Street.\n",

The\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n, which is compiled by\nEklund Gomes\n\u2019 Marcy Roth, counts properties listed for $4 million or more in the Multiple Listing Service.\nThe asking price for the home at 10444 Charing Cross Road equates to $1,753 per square foot and was first listed in February 2025 for $18.5 million, or $2,002 per square foot. Since then, it\u2019s been taken off and put back on the market, reappearing with new pricing.\nThe six-bedroom, eight-bathroom home is over 9,200 square feet, with a theater, a gym, an elevator, two laundry rooms and a wine cellar.\nProperty records show the seller is a limited partnership that counts as a partner Michael Shore, an attorney in Beverly Hills. The LP purchased the property in 2022 for $6.5 million, or $703 per square foot.\nLaura Brau of Compass holds the listing.\nLast week also saw 1520 Carla Ridge in Beverly Hills go into contract to make for the seven-day period\u2019s next priciest pending deal based on listing price.\nLocated in Trousdale Estates, the roughly 7,300-square-foot home has five beds and six baths, with an asking price just under $15 million, or $2,053 per square foot. Built in 2020, the residence sits on nearly half an acre.\nThe property has been on the market since August 2024, first hanging up the for-sale sign with a nearly $23 million asking price. The home has since seen several price reductions and was also listed for rent last May for $85,000 per month.\nThe seller is Kentaro Abe, a trustee for the P&amp;G Trust, according to property records.\nNicholas Property Group\u2019s Dustin Nicholas is the listing agent.\nThe Westwood and Beverly Hills properties were two of 16 homes that went into contract last week, amounting to $122.2 million in asking volume.\nThat activity represented nine fewer signed contracts and about 39 percent less in asking volume compared to a year earlier, according to the Eklund Gomes report.\nOne point to consider when factoring in the year-ago comparisons is the Los Angeles residential market is now lapping the post-Palisades and Eaton fires time period, which saw a significant increase in both leasing and sales activity as impacted homeowners scrambled for temporary or new housing.\n",

One of the suits is against CTBC Bank, which holds the loan on the apartment complex.\nCTBC Bank is seeking to take the property through foreclosure in weeks or months, with timing likely to be subject to rulings in the bankruptcy case and a separate legal action in Santa Clara County court.\nThe Neo isn\u2019t the only multifamily development in downtown San Jose in distress. A lender foreclosed on a 336-unit complex called The Fay last month over a\n$182.5 million construction loan\n.\nThat deal also pointed to a gap between debt levels and property values, with the lender claiming the Fay was worth $110 million. The Fay stood out on San Jose\u2019s skyline at 23 stories, and bought an upscale entry to the boundary between downtown and the city\u2019s SoFa district.\nU.K.-based developer Scape paid $16.5 million for the parcel for The Fay and took the $182.5 million construction loan for the project from an affiliate of Madison Capital Realty, which had foreclosed on it.\n",

        "content": "Texas thawed this month, but the ultra-luxury market remains cold.\nLast week, the first sale of the top 10 most expensive homes listed in Texas in January closed: a spec mansion at 4527 North Lindhurst Avenue in Dallas, asking $8.3 million at the time of sale, according to public records and the Houston Association of Realtors.\nIt was the least expensive of January\u2019s top 10 homes on HAR\u2019s monthly ranking, which covers the major metro areas of the state. A Highland Park home at\n3711 Lexington Avenue\nin Dallas led the ranking with an asking price of $29.9 million.\nSeller Bart Plaskoff, president of Summit Trucking and an\noccasional real estate developer\n, originally listed the Lindhurst Avenue home for $12 million in April 2024, according to Zillow. The low-slung contemporary mansion spans over 8,800 square feet on a 0.8-acre lot, with five bedrooms and eight bathrooms. Amenities include a sauna, pool and fire pit.\nCompass agents Julie Provenanzo and Meridith Hayes had the listing. Fellow Compass agent Stanley Williams represented the buyer, Kenneth Willey. The purchase was finalized on Feb. 12, according to public records.\nThe seller lowered the price gradually throughout 2025, delisting and relisting the home, before settling at an asking price of $8.3 million in January. The final sale price is not disclosed.\nThe most expensive listings of January include\na large share of relistings\n, many with significant discounts. The 20,500-square-foot Lexington Avenue home at the top of the list was asking\n$36.5 million last summer\n; today, it\u2019s asking $29.9 million. The second-most expensive listing of January, a Preston Hollow home owned by the founder of Cinemark, listed last September for\n$22 million\n; today, it\u2019s asking $18 million. Coming in third place, the home at 603 West Friar Tuck Lane in Houston hit the market with an asking price of $20 million in June. Today, it\u2019s asking $14 million.\nIn addition to his spec mansion enterprise, Plaskoff has undertaken community-scale development projects through his company, Jobar Development. Jobar floated a\n1,400-unit mixed-use development in Oak Cliff to city authorities in 2024\n, but the project\u2019s future is uncertain. The company sold the land to JMR Investments Group last February, public records show.\n",

The units are at the center of an\nownership dispute\nbetween\nHarry Macklowe\nand\nCIM Group\n, which is tied to the selling entity. Macklowe had lost the condos last year when he defaulted on the mortgages he took out from CIM to buy the units. The developer paid about $47 million for the units along with a smaller pad on the 28th floor, which is not included in the latest sale.\nSerhant\u2019s Glenn Davis\nand\nNicholas Compagnone\nhad the off-market listing. The buyer was\n78 Purchaser LLC.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nSoho had the top commercial deal to hit records, with the sale of the Nomo Soho Hotel at\n9 Crosby Street\nfor $121 million. The seller was\nAlex Sapir\u2019s\nv\nSapir Organization\n, which had purchased the more than 121,000-square-foot, 26-story property in 2015 for $200 million via a foreclosure sale.

The seller,\nRidgewood 57 II LLC\n, purchased the five-bedroom pad in 2023 for $13.5 million. It went back on the market nearly a year later, with an asking price of $17.5 million. Corcoran\u2019s\nCarrie Chiang\nand\nAndres Perea-Garzon\nhad the listing. The buyer in the latest sale was\nVision Start VIII, LLC.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nIn Lenox Hill,\nMichael L.

Spanning 6,000 square feet, the residence has five bedrooms, access to the secluded Jones Wood Garden, a gym, a multipurpose room and an elevator. It first hit the market in 2022 for just under $14 million; its most recent asking price was just under $12 million.

        "content": "Christine Quinn\u2019s nonprofit released an\nanalysis\nshowing CityFHEPS rental voucher expansion would save $635 million, contrary to a\nfinding\nby the Citizens Budget Commission.\nBut consider the source: Quinn\u2019s mission is to help the homeless, so it\u2019s no surprise that her study concluded that giving them vouchers saves the city money.\nThe budget group\u2019s agenda is fiscal prudence. If vouchers saved money, the CBC would have every incentive to endorse issuing more of them.\nInstead it found that \u201cshort-term savings are fleeting and vouchers cost more than shelter over time.\u201d\n\u201cRental housing vouchers require substantial subsidy and have not reduced the demand for shelter,\u201d the commission wrote. \u201cThe city cannot voucher its way out of the housing affordability crisis.\u201d\nA CityFHEPS voucher costs $54.80 per day. Shelters cost $144 for an individual and $270 for a family. But voucher payments run for five years or more. The average shelter stay is 15 months.\nAlso, the state and federal governments contribute to shelter costs, while the city pays for CityFHEPS on its own.\nQuinn\u2019s nonprofit, WIN, doesn\u2019t want families to spend 15 months in shelters. That likely influenced its decision to use a methodology that showed vouchers save money.\nWIN claims that CBC didn\u2019t account for people returning to shelters, which WIN says vouchers would reduce. CBC says it did account for that.\nI didn\u2019t get into the weeds on their math, but shelter population counts suggest that CBC is right: As the city handed out lots more vouchers in the past two years, the\nshelter head count\ndid not go down. It went up \u2014 even with the migrant surge ending.\nOver that time, the number of single adults in shelters rose by 22 percent. The small number of adult couples in shelters remained flat.\nThe families-with-children shelter population has dropped by 10 percent since January 2024, but largely because migrants stopped arriving. The family shelter head count has more than doubled since January 2022, even as voucher funding increased\nnearly sevenfold\n.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhen the House passed the Housing in the 21st Century Act\n390-9\non Feb. 9, one of the \u201cnay\u201d votes came from California, the state with the most acute housing shortage. It was cast by Republican Tom McClintock. Three Arizona representatives also voted against it. Lizzie Fletcher of Houston was the only Democrat to oppose\nthe bill\n. Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Compass has rolled out a\n$225 fee\npaid by the buyer or seller at every closing, which has upset some of the brokerage\u2019s agents \u2014 as have some other upcharges that Compass is testing. Share your comments with residential reporter Jake Indursky:\njacob.indursky@therealdeal.com\n.\nElsewhere\u2026\nIs earthquake evacuation a legitimate reason to oppose residential development? Earthquakes are unpredictable and last an average of 12 seconds, which doesn\u2019t provide much opportunity to evacuate. But that didn\u2019t stop a\nNIMBY group\nin Los Angeles County from writing in a newsletter to its members, \u201cWind driven fires, earthquakes and floods happen without warning. Are we prepared to handle evacuation of our neighborhoods as more housing is being built?\u201d Locals are\nfighting plans\nto redevelop part of a Woodland Hills golf course.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$52.5 million\nfor 432 Park Avenue, 78A/B.

        "content": "Two South Beach condo association employees were arrested over a kickback scheme that partly hinged on 40-year\nrecertification\nwork for the aging building, according to prosecutors.\nEuclid East Condominium\u2019s property manager Francisco Obispo, 38, was charged with one count of organized scheme to defraud and 18 counts of receiving a kickback. A maintenance worker, Jose Luis Hernandez-Aguiar, 52, was charged with one count of organized scheme to defraud.\nThe six-story, 57-unit building at 1545 Euclid Avenue was built in 1967.\nA Miami-Dade State Attorney\u2019s investigator started poking around in June, after a former board member pointed out financial discrepancies, including payments from the association to JLH Repair, a company registered to Hernandez. A review of financial records, including bank records obtained through a subpoena of JLH, showed that the alleged scheme capitalized on Euclid East\u2019s impending 40-year recertification.\nFlorida and Miami-Dade County tightened its structural integrity and recertification requirements after the 2021 Surfside condo collapse, imposing recertifications at the 30-year mark and every 10 years thereafter. The rules are stricter for buildings near the coast.\nThe Euclid East association paid JLH $25,000 for permit processing for the recertification, though the city of Miami Beach had no record of JLH pulling permits, according to the arrest warrant. JLH also received $24,500 for pulling recertification electrical permits, but the city had no record of JLH applying for or securing the permits, the warrant says.\nAround the time JLH received payments from the association, it cut checks to Obispo and a company registered in his name, Skyline Management Solutions, bank records allegedly showed.\nThe investigator tracked 18 money transfers, including nearly $200,000 allegedly paid from the association to JLH, with $66,100 of that allegedly transferred to Obispo. Another firm, led by a man who identified himself as the licensed contractor retained by JLH to pull permits for Euclid East, received $61,800 from the association, with $29,400 then transferred to Obispo, according to the warrant.\nObispo told the investigator he received nothing of value from Hernandez.\nEuclid East employed Obispo and Hernandez through a condo management company. Hernandez, the maintenance worker, was later switched to a direct employee of the association around the time Obispo, the property manager, was assigned to Euclid East in 2024, the arrest warrant states.\n\u201c[We] scratched our head, going where did this come from,\u201d a board member told the investigator, according to the warrant. \u201cNobody talked to us about it. One minute he\u2019s the janitor, the next thing you know, he\u2019s running $500,000 in construction projects.\u201d\nHernandez\u2019s bond was set at $15,000, and Obispo\u2019s at $105,000. They could not be reached for comment.\nThe arrests mark the latest incident in a string of alleged\nfraudulent dealings\nby condo association staff members.\u00a0Residents living in communities governed by condo or homeowners associations across South Florida have accused board members of\nwrongdoing\n, from diverting funds to themselves to election fraud and bullying of those who spoke out.

It\u2019s new digs? Business-friendly Miami.\nThe publicly traded AI software firm, led by Alex Karp, said in a brief X post on Tuesday that it moved its headquarters from Denver to Miami, the Denver Post\nreported\n.\nThe firm, with a market value of $312.2 billion and about 4,000 employees, hasn\u2019t announced its office location.\nThe planned move aligns with Miami\u2019s yearslong effort to become a magnet for tech firms and gives a boost to the city\u2019s push to grow its AI sector.\nThe company has faced regulatory and political headwinds in Colorado.\nPalantir has faced protests in Denver partly due to its work using AI to aid Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportations.\nA Colorado law will take effect in June creating more stringent regulation for data mining and predictive tools, though it didn\u2019t target Palantir directly.\nIn its move to Miami, Palantir is following the footsteps of its co-founder and board chair Peter Thiel, whose San Francisco-based venture capital firm Founders Fund opened a Miami office in 2021, first in\nBrickell\nand then moved to\nWynwood\n. His Los Angeles-based Thiel Capital investment firm opened a Miami office last year.\nPalantir isn\u2019t the only one opting for a Miami headquarters.\nPrivate equity firm Trinity Investments moved its headquarters to Miami from Honolulu; Canadian waste management firm GFL Environmental moved to Miami Beach from Vaughan, Ontario; and Danish retailer Danish Flying Tiger Copenhagen announced it will open its Americas administrative base at Miami Beach\u2019s Lincoln Road.\nTrinity, founded in 1996 and led by Sean Hehir, kept a Honolulu office and also has outposts in\u00a0 Los Angeles and London, a company news release states. Its recent investments include the 240-key The Hoxton, Poblenou hotel in Barcelona, and the 450-room Fairmont Olympic Hotel in downtown Seattle.\nIt leased\n3,000 square feet\nat Comras Company\u2019s The Canopy Offices at 2982 Grand Avenue in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove neighborhood.\nIn South Florida, Trinity, in partnership with Credit Suisse Asset Management, owns the 1,000-key oceanfront Diplomat Beach Resort in Hollywood.

Buyers will have the option to occupy, lease or resell their units.\nFour West plans to market the suites to small business owners and commercial investors priced out of office submarkets in\nAventura\nand Miami, the release states.\nFortune Development Sales, the brokerage arm of Edgardo Defortuna\u2019s Fortune International Group, is handling marketing and sales.\nFour West paid $8 million for the development site in 2024, records show. The developer plans to begin construction later this year.\nThe project\u2019s 18,000 square feet of amenities will include a terrace with pickleball and padel courts, a social lounge, and a fitness center with a cold plunge pool, sauna and studio. It will also have 18,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space.\nBroward\u2019s office vacancy rate hit the mid-teens at the end of last year, according to Newmark. Average asking rents pushed into the low $40s per square foot, cheaper than Miami-Dade but high enough that some smaller users are looking for alternatives to traditional leases, Newmark found. Brokers say tenants are gravitating either to high-quality, amenity-rich buildings or deeply discounted second-tier spaces.\nChaberman is an active developer in Hallandale Beach. His other firm, Kadima Developers, is planning\nSeven Park\n, a $70 million, eight-story mixed-use project with 121 condos and 4,500 square feet of ground-floor retail. Kadima purchased 12.2 vacant acres around the Big Easy Casino at 831 North Federal Highway for\n$31.1 million\nin December.

The loan will fund Marquette\u2019s Union Villa Park development at 110 South Villa Avenue in Villa Park, Illinois, which will include 238 apartments consisting of studios, two and three-bedroom units, as well as 8,000 square feet of commercial space. MetLife is serving as an equity partner in the project which is expected to cost $90 million, a release from Marquette shows.\nThe village of Villa Park approved an incentive agreement with Marquette for the development in 2025 that includes a garage with 94 parking spaces open to the public, The Daily Herald reported.\nThe financing follows a trend of lenders feeling more confident in non-Cook County suburbs than in the city of Chicago. Early last year, suburban apartment building sales between $1 million and $50 million\njumped 65 percent, year-over-year\n, Interra Realty found. The brokerage, which specializes in midsize deals, found that 53 midsize apartment buildings sold between March 2024 and March 2025, compared to 32 sold between March 2023 and March 2024.\nSince last year, investing activity continues to hold strong.

Tension over property tax adjustments in the wake of the pandemic have led to\na contentious race\nfor Cook County Tax Assessor, with donations from the real estate community flooding into Democratic Primary challenger Patrick Hynes\u2019 campaign.\nStill, activity is hardly at a standstill in Chicago.

        "content": "The \u201ctake your licks until 2026\u201d mantra has officially expired for the owners of the\nEmbassy Suites by Hilton hotel in Lombard\n, as they\u2019re still feeling the post-pandemic pain of depressed commercial real estate values.\nMonths after the 263-key hotel slipped into distress, a group of lenders steered by special servicer KeyBank are moving to strip operational control from its landlord, a joint venture of Corona del Mar, California-based Seaview Investors and San Diego-based Chelsea Hospitality Partners. The lenders asked a DuPage County judge to appoint Jeff Kolessar of GF Hotels &amp; Resorts as receiver to manage the property amid a $24 million foreclosure lawsuit, with a hearing set for March 3, public records show.\nThe move signals a cold reality for suburban hotel owners: Even as downtown Chicago hotels enjoyed a summer of 2019-level revenue, the suburbs remain a landscape of steep haircuts and aggressive foreclosures.\nThe lawsuit highlights a ballooning debt stack for the hotel. While the principal sits at $21.5 million, the bill has been padded by $1.6 million in default interest, $576,000 in deferred interest and various late fees.\nThe lender, a consortium of investors that bought the debt after it originated in 2019 as part of a commercial mortgage-backed securities deal, alleged the Seaview and Chelsea venture defaulted by failing to repay the loan upon its summertime maturity date last year. The landlords previously indicated they wouldn\u2019t try to refinance the property to save the deal, an acknowledgment of its value sliding too far since the loan origination before the pandemic.\nNow, the owners signed a pre-negotiation agreement with the lender and are \u201cengaged in discussions regarding possible exit strategies,\u201d according to KeyBank. \u201cThe special servicer continues to assess all options to maximize recoveries,\u201d it said last month in a report on the deal.\nThe lender is also seeking permission to fast-track $200,000 to $300,000 in tenant improvements without court oversight \u2014 a sign the group of banks that hold the note are already prepping the hotel for a post-foreclosure life.\nIf appointed, GF Hotels affiliate LOIL Associates would manage the property for $7,000 a month or 3 percent of gross revenue, whichever is higher, according to legal documents.\nStill, the Lombard Embassy Suites deal remains profitable on paper. The property has had no trouble bringing in enough revenue to cover its debt service costs, loan data shows, as it generated over $11.4 million for the 12-month period ending in March of last year, with expenses of just under $8 million and debt service costs of $2.4 million, leaving a roughly $1 million cushion.\nThe legal pressure extends beyond the real estate. The loan was guaranteed by trusts tied to hospitality industry veterans Robert Alter and Gary Stougaard, who have ties to Seaview. Their trusts were required to maintain a combined net worth of at least $35 million. So far, the borrowers haven\u2019t indicated they will fight the receivership.\nNeither Seaview nor an attorney for KeyBank returned requests for comment.\nThe Lombard case is the latest data point in a harrowing Chicagoland hospitality market. Suburban properties are especially desperate, as business travel and corporate visits to office campuses stay muted, while workspace vacancy hovers at a record high of over 30 percent in the suburbs.\nLast year, a\n318-key Crowne Plaza hotel in Northbrook sold out of foreclosure\nfor just $6.5 million, a 50 percent discount from its last purchase price in 2021, and the former\nTremont Hotel in Chicago\u2019s Gold Coast fetched just $13 million\nafter a stint as a shelter and a foreclosure dispute. Locally based investor Parag Patel has bought multiple properties at steep bargains in both the city and suburbs, including the Aloft Bolingbrook property he bought out of foreclosure, making him a potential candidate to buy the nearby Lombard Embassy Suites grappling with distress.\nYet, the pain is climbing into bigger hotel deals, too. Just blocks from the renowned Magnificent Mile,\nQuadrum Global\nis currently moving to foreclose on Oxford Capital\u2019s Godfrey Hotel in an $88 million debt dispute.",

He emphasized that the property is not zoned for detention and that, to the village\u2019s understanding, the space is being used for administrative purposes only.\n\u201cIt is not zoned for a detention facility,\u201d Herman said. \u201cIf they were to attempt to do so, it would be prohibited by our zoning.\u201d\nA\nprocessing and detention facility\nused by ICE and Customs and Border Protection already operates in\nBroadview\n, about six miles away.\nIn a statement to the broadcaster, DHS declined to confirm details about the Oak Brook site, saying: \u201cIs it really news that when a federal agency hires more personnel, that they need more space?\u201d The agency added that ICE plans to add 10,000 law enforcement professionals and cited an increase in threats against officers.\nLewis University said it hopes to continue using its Oak Brook classrooms as planned this semester, but has not made any decisions about its future lease.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A planned 402-acre Islamic-centered community northeast of Dallas is drawing fresh federal and state scrutiny, threatening to complicate one of the region\u2019s most ambitious master-planned projects.\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said Friday its Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity launched an investigation into EPIC Real Properties and Community Capital Partners over potential violations of the Fair Housing Act, including alleged religious and national origin discrimination tied to\nThe Meadow\n, formerly branded as EPIC City, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. EPIC stands for the East Plano Islamic Center.\nHUD said it received a complaint from the Texas Workforce Commission detailing a \u201clarge-scale pattern of religious discriminatory conduct.\u201d Among the allegations: marketing materials promoting the project as an exclusively Muslim community and \u201cthe epicenter of Islam in America,\u201d financial terms requiring lot owners to subsidize a mosque and Islamic educational centers, as well as a two-tier lottery system for lot sales that favored certain buyers, according to the outlet.\nHUD Secretary Scott Turner said the agency would ensure a \u201cthorough investigation so that this community is open to all Texans.\u201d\nCommunity Capital Partners, a for-profit development arm formed by members of the East Plano Islamic Center, denied discrimination claims and said it remains committed to complying with\nstate\nand\nfederal\nhousing laws. The group argues many of the issues raised were addressed in a prior settlement with the Texas Workforce Commission.\nThe\ndevelopment envisions\nmore than 1,000 homes, a K-12 faith-based school, mosque, senior housing, apartments, retail and sports fields across land in Collin and Hunt counties, roughly 40 miles from downtown Dallas.\nAt the same time, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton\nfiled a separate lawsuit\nin Collin County, his agency announced Monday, targeting Double R Municipal Utility District No. 2A, accusing board members of improperly expanding the district\u2019s boundaries to support what he called the \u201cillegal\u201d EPIC project.\nMunicipal utility districts, authorized by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, are critical to financing infrastructure for large-scale residential developments. Developers front the costs, then recoup them through bond issuances repaid by property taxes within the district.\nPaxton alleges that in September, the Double R board was replaced at a rural meeting and quickly approved a petition to annex roughly 400 acres tied to The Meadow \u2014 despite questions about whether the new directors met statutory qualifications or even resided within the district. His office is seeking to block further district action and strip the project land from its boundaries.\nThe developer\u2019s attorney, Eric Hudson, called the suit the latest escalation in \u201clawfare\u201d by Paxton and Gov. Greg Abbott, arguing the district process has been handled by Texas law firm Winstead for 18 months and that technical issues will be resolved in court.\nThe project has already weathered a securities lawsuit from Paxton as well as a now-closed civil rights inquiry by the Justice Department.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The Houston suburb of Kingwood continues to attract the attention of\nmultifamily investors\nand developers after becoming the site of\nHigh Street Residential\n\u2019s first apartment development outside the city.\nSentinel Capital, which is based in Houston, purchased Elm Creek Apartments from HGA, a firm headquartered in Hamburg, Germany, according to a release from Berkadia, which arranged the deal. Berkadia\u2019s Chris Curry, Jeffrey Skipworth, Chris Young, Joey Rippel, Kyle Whitney and Jed Dalton marketed the property as part of a four-property portfolio, according to the brokerage.\nSentinel Capital borrowed $10.6 million from JLL Real Estate Capital for the purchase, loan documents show. Terms of the deal weren\u2019t disclosed, but the property was last valued for tax purposes at $14.5 million.\nElm Creek Apartments, at 2911 Sycamore Springs Drive, was built in 1982. The 168-unit property offers one- and two-bedroom garden-style apartments. The property has not been renovated, according to the release. Appraisal district records show the last remodel was in 2012.\nThe property is in\nKingwood\n, a master-planned community about 27 miles northeast of downtown Houston. Billed as \u201cThe Livable Forest,\u201d the 14,000-acre development was created in 1971 as a joint venture between Friendswood Development Company and King Ranch. Kingwood has a population of about 80,000 people.\nThe suburb has become a favorite of heavy-hitter developers like High Street Residential, an arm of Trammell Crow Company. The firm\npartnered with Japanese developer Daiwa House Group\nto develop two apartment communities: Residences at Kingwood, a 289-unit property at 6519 Kings Glen Drive, and Residences at Kingwood East, a 181-unit property at 6518 Kings Glen Drive. Residences at Kingwood was High Street Residential\u2019s first suburban Houston multifamily development.\nCaldwell Companies is building an \u201cactive adult\u201d community in the neighborhood, Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.

        "content": "Before the pandemic, generational wealth migration and the seemingly endless stream of headlines about Steve Ross transforming West Palm Beach, there was Jeff Greene.\nHe saw a diamond in the rough more than a decade ago.\n\u201cSitting in my private plane at the airport, it struck me that there were 300 to 400 other private jets there,\u201d he told\nThe Real Deal\nin a 2016 interview. \u201cHow can a city with this much wealth and education have so few amazing buildings, restaurants and hotels?\u201d\nThe billionaire real estate investor\nlaid out his plans\nfor reinventing the coastal city. By that point, he\u2019d amassed a 75-acre portfolio in West Palm Beach and was dreaming up apartments, condos, a hotel, an office tower, retail and a school.\nA decade later, West Palm is threatening Greene with\na $5 million fine if he doesn\u2019t finish\nhis premier mixed-use development soon. Earlier this month, the city commission certified an agreement with the developer that he will complete the two-tower, 30-story One West Palm by the end of 2027. Otherwise, he\u2019ll have to fork over the hefty late fee.\nGreene said he plans to complete One West Palm before the deadline.\nIt\u2019s a squeeze play for a city widely seen as a partner to the real estate industry and the titans who want to build in it. And it\u2019s in sharp contrast to\nRoss\n\u2019 gargantuan efforts, which have produced millions of square feet of office and apartment developments in the same amount of time.\nBut to Greene, his delays at One West Palm distract from his myriad of projects throughout West Palm and Palm Beach County.\n\u201cWe\u2019re building stuff all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone focuses on the one building that seems to be taking a very long time.\u201d\nRed light, Greene light\nGreene\u2019s vision for his West Palm Beach projects came together at a time of great personal change.\nIn 2009, Greene bought a 3.6-acre oceanfront Palm Beach estate for $24 million. Comparable properties today trade for more than $100 million, but that was long before the pandemic altered market dynamics on the island. He had married his wife Mei Sze Chan a few years earlier, and the couple had just welcomed their first child. In 2010, he launched an unsuccessful bid for U.S. Senate.\nBut his political ambitions were dogged by his past.\nHe is among the mythologized figures who had the prescience to bet against the housing market in the mid-aughts, a move that earned him an $800 million windfall when Wall Street came crashing down in 2008. A profile in\nForbes\nthat year titled \u201cThe Reluctant Billionaire\u201d elevated his reputation nationally, along with tales of his bachelor days in Beverly Hills. For years, most articles about Greene mentioned that his best man was Mike Tyson, that he partied with Paris Hilton and Lindsey Lohan, and that he hosted infamous Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss in his guest house for a year, describing her as a \u201cnice girl.\u201d\nIt didn\u2019t play well with voters, and he lost to his rival in the Democratic primary that year.\nBut Greene had other irons in the fire. He was quietly amassing a sprawling portfolio in Palm Beach County, banking property as South Florida crawled out of its post-financial crisis pit.\nHe bought an incomplete 548-unit apartment complex in West Palm Beach for $6.8 million in 2011 and finished construction of the complex in 2015. He bought the former Palm Beach Post Office for $3.7 million \u2013\u2013 which he sold later to the Breakers for\n$28 million\n. He bought the oceanfront Palm Beach resort now known as Tideline for $42 million.\nHe also snapped up hundreds of condos in newly completed buildings like\nthe Whitney\nat 410 Evernia Street, City Palms at 480 Hibiscus Street and the Strand at 255 Evernia Street. In 2015, he paid $24 million for a 3.3-acre parcel at 419 Lakeview Avenue, still a vacant lot with seasonal pumpkin and Christmas tree markets.\nGreene estimates his property holdings in the county are worth billions.\n\u201cI did buy an enormous amount of land,\u201d he said, adding he\u2019s been intentionally restrained in pacing his developments. \u201cIf I built it all at once, it would flood the market.\u201d\nThe sites that have made headlines recently are a 26-acre spread he acquired between 2012 and 2016 in West Palm\u2019s Currie Park Mixed Use District. It was during this time Greene paid $10 million for the 3.3-acre One West Palm development site at 550 North Quadrille Boulevard.\nDesigned by Arquitectonica, One West Palm is set to include 200,000 square feet of office space, 326 apartments, 201 hotel rooms and amenities like a fitness club, spa, movie theater, pools and indoor tennis courts.\nConstruction started in 2019, with the expectation it would be finished in 2022.\nBut Greene found himself bogged down in conflict from early days. He clashed with both the contractor and the city, and\nultimately fired Kast Construction\nfrom the project in 2024.\nWhile other developers have investors and lenders breathing down their necks when construction runs behind, the self-financing billionaire didn\u2019t \u201chave anyone to answer to,\u201d he said.\nWhile One West Palm faced delays, Greene was at work on another major two-tower development nearby. He announced plans for the Herzog &amp; de Meuron-designed project at 2175 and 2251 North Flagler Drive in 2023, touting the Swiss architecture firm as a major get for a maturing city. The 76-unit project is predicated on a 2021 upzoning of the Currie Park Mixed Use District.\nIt was the upzoning, which allowed Greene to build well beyond previously allowed height limits, that was targeted by the city this fall while he was attempting to get final approvals for the condos. A letter from Mayor Keith James stating the city would retract the height allowances prompted Greene to sue the city in October, alleging West Palm was improperly dragging out the approval process.\n\u201cIf this mayor wants me to just be a land banker and not build anything, I won\u2019t build anything,\u201d he said at the time.\nGreene cut a deal with the city, agreeing to the potential $5 million One West Palm penalty, while securing the height for his Herzog &amp; de Meuron condos. He also committed to a land swap and a $6 million payment to the city for the connection of Northwood Road and Currie Park.\nA decade in the making, Greene\u2019s vision for his West Palm portfolio hasn\u2019t totally materialized. He completed the 198-unit Brandon Estates apartment complex in 2024, and he\u2019s finished industrial projects farther inland. He also opened the Greene School in 2016, and it now runs from pre-K to 12th grade with\nan admissions waitlist\n.\nHe still needs to get the condos through final approval and One West Palm its certificate of occupancy. He\u2019s also working on Live Local projects in the city\u2019s downtown, a land donation to the proposed Vanderbilt University graduate campus, and plans for an 8.4-acre waterfront site on Flagler Drive. To him, timing is everything. And with\nso many other developers building\naround his sites, the timing seems better than ever.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of luck in real estate development. I\u2019m not stupid, I know you can be an idiot and make money in a great cycle, and you can be a genius and lose money in a bad cycle,\u201d he said. \u201cWe delayed [One West Palm] to get the perfect project, and just by luck, everything around it has blossomed.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A San Clemente-based housing developer has sued the trade group Orange County Realtors, accusing it of trying to block a $130 million senior housing project that already obtained city approvals.\nNick Buchanan, an infill developer based in San Clemente, plans to build a\n180-unit senior housing development\non a 4-acre shopping center he owns along La Paz Road in Laguna Hills. But Buchanan says the neighboring property owner \u2014 Orange County Realtors \u2014 has interfered with the project,\nforcing him to take legal action\n, according to the Orange County Business Journal.\nBuchanan\u2019s La Paz Village Investors filed a lawsuit Jan. 7 in Orange County Superior Court, alleging the trade group and its contractors conducted unauthorized construction on his property, including excavating asphalt, staging heavy equipment and blocking access to the shopping center, according to the complaint.\n\u201cThis was a project we tried very hard to work through collaboratively,\u201d Buchanan told the Business Journal. \u201cI just want to sit in a room with them and figure out how we move forward so we can build this important housing project.\u201d\nOrange County Realtors did not respond to the Business Journal\u2019s requests for comment.\nThe dispute centers on the redevelopment of La Paz Village, an aging retail center located just south of Interstate 5. Buchanan purchased the property in 2022 for $23.5 million and initially proposed townhomes before pivoting to senior housing. The five-story project would include independent living units, underground parking and amenities such as a gym, theater and rooftop deck, with 10 percent of units reserved for very low-income seniors.\nBuchanan used California\u2019s \u201cbuilder\u2019s remedy\u201d law to secure approvals after Laguna Hills was found out of compliance with state housing requirements. The Laguna Hills City Council approved the project in September, despite some opposition.\nAccording to Buchanan, Orange County Realtors owns the adjacent site and holds access easements across portions of the property. He said the group initially appeared open to the redevelopment but stopped communicating after construction activity escalated last fall.\n\u201cThey dug up our property without asking,\u201d Buchanan said. \u201cThat creates liability for us as a landlord.\u201d\nBuchanan said the lawsuit is aimed at clearing the way for construction to proceed.\n\u201cThis is exactly the kind of housing California says it wants,\u201d he said, with housing scarce across Southern California.\n\u2014\nLauren Elkies Schram\n",

        "content": "Mayor Zohran Mamdani named five new members to the city\u2019s Rent Guidelines Board, meaning the mayor\u2019s appointees make up a majority of the body as he calls for freezing rents for stabilized apartments.\nMamdani announced Wednesday that he tapped Chatnella Mitchell, program director at the New York Community Trust, as the new chair, replacing Doug Apple. Maksim Wynn, director of development and supportive housing at Bronx-based Procida Development Group, is joining as an owner representative. Wynn previously worked for the city\u2019s Department of Homeless Services and the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, where he focused on homelessness.\nThe mayor also named to the board Sina Sinai, senior research associate at the Jain Family Institute; Lauren Melodia, director of economic and fiscal policy at the Center for New York City Affairs at The New School; and Brandon Mancilla, a regional director of the United Auto Workers; as public members.\nDespite\nefforts\nby outgoing Mayor Eric Adams to leave the board with a majority of his own appointees, Mamdani entered office with the ability to appoint up to five of the nine board members in his first year, with the ability to replace the remaining four in his second.\nBut another spot was freed up when public member Alex Armlovich, who has been publicly\nskeptical\nof freezing rents, announced Tuesday that he was stepping down ahead of schedule. In a letter\nposted\non X, Armlovich said he was leaving to take a new position at Coefficient Giving, where he\u2019ll work on housing supply policy.\n\u201cIn a democracy, the mayor who wins an election has some right to appoint people who reflect his policy priorities, including on the RGB,\u201d he states in the letter, adding that he has confidence that the mayor\u2019s housing priorities are being guided by a team \u2014\u00a0he mentions Deputy Mayor of Housing and Planning\nLeila Bozorg\n\u2014 that is \u201cengaging with the full complexity of the problem.\u201d\nArmlovich urged board members to consider a proposal by Arpit Gupta, one of the owner representatives on the board. The proposal, dubbed a \u201cslumlord freeze\u201d by Armlovich, would only freeze rents for property owners whose buildings have the highest number of hazardous violations.\n\u201cIt directly ties a landlord\u2019s revenue to their performance as a housing provider, and it addresses the legitimate concern that blanket guidelines reward negligent and responsible ones alike,\u201d Armlovich writes.\nArmlovich\u2019s decision to step down before his term was up at the end of the year was first reported by The City.\nInstead of naming a sixth new member, Mamdani opted to reappoint Ad\u00e1n Soltren, a tenant representative, appointed by Adams whose term had expired.\nThe terms of the remaining members, Gupta and Christina Smyth, both owner representatives, and tenant representative Sagar Sharma, expire at the end of the year.\nAppointing a majority of the rent board\u2019s members doesn\u2019t guarantee that the body will ultimately freeze rents this year, let alone over the next four. The board is supposed to act independently of the mayor, though past administrations have influenced its decisions.\nIn a press release, the mayor didn\u2019t mention his pledge to freeze rents on stabilized apartments for the next four years. In a statement, he said that under Mitchell\u2019s leadership as chair, \u201cthe board will take a clear-eyed look at the complex housing landscape and the realities facing our city\u2019s two million rent-stabilized tenants.\u201d\nThe news of the appointments comes one day after the mayor unveiled his preliminary budget, which calls for a blanket\n9.5 percent property increase\nif the state doesn\u2019t hike corporate tax and income tax rates for New York\u2019s wealthiest.\n",

        "content": "Jeffrey Epstein surrounded himself with sultans, former heads of state, British royalty and tech visionaries to cultivate the image of a high-flying financier.\nBut in real estate, Epstein often leaned on a down-on-his-luck New York City developer with a trail of lawsuits and an array of business ventures that ranged from a deli to a houseware retailer to boutique luxury condos: David Mitchell.\nEpstein\u2019s previously undisclosed real estate investments with Mitchell show deeper insight into Epstein\u2019s business strategy. He invested in real estate not just for paper returns but to enhance his connections and stature, specifically turning to Mitchell to build out his ever-expanding Rolodex.\nOne source who knows Mitchell said that Epstein saw Mitchell \u2014 whose father was a famed NYC restaurateur \u2014 as someone who could open doors and make social connections for the outer borough-born Epstein in New York\u2019s upper-crust society. The relationship evolved as Mitchell\u2019s investments went south and he relied on Epstein for short-term loans and financial advice. Epstein provided at least $7 million in loans and investments in Mitchell\u2019s projects, according to a\nTRD\nestimate based on transactions specified in the documents.\nThe thousands of emails exchanged between Epstein, Mitchell and Epstein\u2019s assistants were released as part of 3.5 million pages of documents by the Department of Justice into the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. The emails suggest the relationship was mostly transactional, although they did occasionally exchange birthday and holiday messages. Epstein once asked Mitchell about an erectile dysfunction drug and Mitchell invited Epstein to a birthday party in Tel Aviv, telling him it should be \u201cquite demonic and fun.\u201d\nEpstein provided Mitchell funding for many of his projects, including a $1.5 million loan in 2017 to cover shortfalls at the Life Hotel, Mitchell\u2019s ambitious rebrand of the Herald Square Hotel. Epstein also invested in at least four of Mitchell\u2019s ventures, including a six-unit condo development on the Upper East Side, according to emails released by the Department of Justice.\nMitchell, despite his blue blood bona fides, often found himself needing cash infusions from Epstein, emails show. Epstein, whose liquid assets were in the hundreds of millions for most of their relationship, seemed happy to help, providing over $2 million in loans to Mitchell.\n\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it, life is long . No stress from me,\u201d Epstein said in response to Mitchell trying to negotiate a repayment plan for one of the loans he had received.\nEpstein did not appear to financially benefit from his relationship with Mitchell. But after the Department of Justice charged Epstein with sex trafficking dozens of underage girls in July 2019, Epstein\u2019s attorneys sought to put assets from two individuals up for a bond package: Epstein\u2019s brother and Mitchell, who was described by Epstein\u2019s attorneys as a \u201cfriend.\u201d\nBetween 2009 and 2019, Epstein also regularly sought connections from Mitchell. Epstein turned to the dealmaker to find a friend of Woody Allen\u2019s son a restaurant job. Epstein asked Mitchell for a rabbi who would do a conversion for \u201cshiksas,\u201d or non-jewish women. And he requested Mitchell\u2019s help with a Soho House membership.\nEpstein also offered Mitchell career advice, warning him he was in too many deals.\n\u201cTry to be disciplined about deals. breaking the addiction is not easy,\u201d said Epstein in an email to Mitchell in 2016. \u201cAs your friend i think too many\u2026 slow down, I need you around.\u201d\nMitchell did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\nTwo connectors\nMitchell hailed from the world Epstein always aspired to be a part of. Mitchell\u2019s father, Jan Mitchell, revived famed New York restaurants L\u00fcchow\u2019s and Longchamps. He bought an estate in Southampton modeled after the Villa Medici in Rome and amassed a collection of pre-Columbian gold, donating some to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\nJan\u2019s son dabbled in real estate, focusing on retailers and small high-end condos in Manhattan and Brooklyn Heights. Among his more notable ventures was Gracious Homes, an upscale housewares chain, which filed for bankruptcy in 2016.\nEpstein and Mitchell had a longstanding relationship. When Epstein\u2019s cushy 13-month jail sentence in Palm Beach County ended for charges of soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor for prostitution in July 2009, Mitchell called Epstein\u2019s office to offer \u201ccongratulations\u2026 or welcome back.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just so happy for you. Give me a call when you can,\u201d Mitchell said.\nMitchell acted as deal guy for Epstein. Over the course of their relationship, Mitchell brought a number of investment opportunities and business ideas to Epstein.\nMitchell\u2019s pitches were often for new and off-the-beaten-path deals, getting into loansharking, buying properties in Alberta, Canada, and a self-storage property in Tampa. But Mitchell rarely seemed to have the funds to close on these investments.\nAfter Epstein\u2019s prison sentence in Palm Beach ended in 2009, Epstein viewed Mitchell as a trusted confidante. Epstein asked Mitchell to arrange meetings with some of his most valued contacts. In 2010, Epstein requested that Mitchell go to Dubai with an Epstein associate to meet Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, the CEO of logistics giant DP World. A year later, Mitchell was asking Epstein, then a convicted sex offender, for \u201ccredibility help\u201d in the U.K., while he attempted to make a bid on the Silverstone racing track with Guggenheim Partners. Epstein hosted a meeting at his NYC townhouse with Peter Mandelson, a member of the U.K\u2019s House of Lords, and Mitchell. The deal fizzled out and Mitchell said he was looking for new partners and asked Epstein if he could pitch the deal to the \u201cSultan.\u201d\nBack in 2011, Epstein appeared to have nearly blind trust in Mitchell.\n\u201c[I\u2019m] closing today on your deal\u201e with no due diligence. I am merely relying on your representations . thanks and good luck,\u201d said Epstein in one email.\nEpstein also offered to help Mitchell out when was short on capital. In 2011, Mitchell asked for Epstein to show \u201cproof of funds\u201d to purchase 7 million British pounds. Mitchell said he just needed a \u201cflash.\u201d In 2012, Mitchell once again asked Epstein to provide a \u201cproof of funds\u201d letter for $21 million to satisfy an \u201cedgy\u201d seller in another deal.\nA partnership in the red\nEpstein invested millions with Mitchell, in addition to loaning him money directly, according to financial documents made public by the DOJ. Many of those investments did not reap returns.\nMitchell and Epstein were partners on multiple condo developments, including an Upper East Side condo conversion project of a Beaux-Arts mansion at 320 East 82nd Street that Mitchell had purchased for $16 million in 2015. They also co-invested in a four-unit condo project in Flatiron that attracted A-listers like Chelsea Clinton, Jeff Gordon and Jennifer Lopez after launching sales in 2013.\nBut the Upper East Side development hardly saw any buyers, let alone celebrities, come through the door after Mitchell\u2019s then-wife, Douglas Elliman agent Jamie Mitchell, launched sales in 2017. After pestering Mitchell for months about a project update, Epstein\u2019s accountant Richard Kahn was dismayed at the numbers Mitchell sent over in May 2018. \u201cThis summary sheet is useless and [Mitchell] is clearly lost,\u201d he wrote to Epstein. \u201cIt appears from sales scenario\u2026we get back $0 on our $3,480,000 investment.\u201d\nMitchell\u2019s other projects were quickly unraveling, as well.\nHe bought the Herald Square Hotel for $40 million in 2015 and sunk $30 million into renovations and rebranding as the boutique, 98-room Life Hotel, with ground-floor dining from restaurateur Steven Hanson, who also invested in the project.\nNearly immediately, the hotel appeared to be a losing proposition. Emails from October 2017 show Mitchell asking his partner Hanson for $2,600 to cover overdraft fees, and by 2018 he was looking to sell the property but couldn\u2019t find a bidder to make him and his investors whole, according to a lawsuit filed against Mitchell in state court.\nEpstein played the role of strategic advisor and, when necessary, bridge lender. He told Mitchell he wanted \u201cno tie to hotel.\u201d In 2017, Epstein\u2019s company, Financial Trust Real Estate, agreed to extend a $1.5 million loan to Mitchell for the Life Hotel. In 2023, Mitchell lost the hotel after the lender foreclosed on the underlying loan.\nAs Mitchell became more indebted to Epstein, Epstein provided Mitchell other ways to make some cash, like helping broker Epstein\u2019s purchase of his neighbor, Bill Cosby\u2019s townhome on East 71st Street. He also enlisted Mitchell to auction off a Hercules statue and another Roman statue with a projected value of $1.5 million.\nStill, Mitchell continued to ask Epstein for multiple short-term loans.\nIn October 2018, Epstein wired Mitchell $70,000. In January 2019, Mitchell asked Epstein for $100,000 wire. Epstein\u2019s accountant emailed Epstein, \u201che\u2019s desperate.\u201d\nEpstein\u2019s accountant was especially dubious of Mitchell\u2019s ability to repay his debts and the whereabouts of the statues.\n\u201cSeems like he is stumbling out of control all answers noncommittal..and info he gives us is never accurate,\u201d said Kahn.\nKahn emailed Mitchell, \u201cquite disturbing that your story keeps changing\u2026 you should be more careful as jeffrey trusts you yet you give me bad info every day.\u201d\nRecords of ledgers from Epstein\u2019s accounts show that Mitchell and his wife made payments in increments as small as $2,200 to Epstein over the course, totaling over $600,000, ending in April 2019.\nMitchell\u2019s money problems\nAfter Epstein\u2019s death in a federal detention center while awaiting charges of sex trafficking minors, Mitchell continued to face financial and legal challenges.\nA New York judge found he owed over $6 million to a broker he stiffed on a land deal in Las Vegas over a decade prior. Two different law firms sued him for unpaid legal fees, he was evicted from his Midtown East co-op for failing to pay 18 months of maintenance fees and his wife filed for divorce.\nIn 2020, a roughly $42,000 check bounced for his children\u2019s tuition at elite private school Columbia Grammar &amp; Preparatory. When the school administrator was informed over email, she responded: \u201cYou did not tell me\u2026but it does not surprise me at all.\u201d\nBy 2021, he listed just $1,200 in his Chase bank account, according to a court filing.\nJust last month, Mitchell was sued by an art gallery owner who collects Pre-Columbian art for an unpaid loan of $34,200.\nIn an email, the gallery owner offered Mitchell one last chance to pay up before commencing litigation.\n\u201cThis situation has been prolonged by repeated misrepresentations and delays,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Illinois\u2019 data center boom may be headed for a time-out.\nGov. JB Pritzker is expected on Wednesday to call for a two-year suspension of the state\u2019s tax incentives for new data centers, a sharp pivot for a governor who has long touted business recruitment. The proposal, first\nreported\nby NBC News, would take effect July 1 and halt eligibility for Illinois\u2019 data center tax credit program while the state studies the industry\u2019s impact.\nUnder the plan,\nPritzker\nwill direct state agencies to examine how existing facilities are affecting the power grid, consumer energy bills and the broader economy. The goal, according to his office, is to ensure data centers are financially sustainable, don\u2019t drive up utility costs and fairly allocate infrastructure resources. The Democratic-controlled\nGeneral Assembly\nwould need to sign off.\nThe move comes as hyperscale facilities tied to artificial intelligence demands proliferate nationwide, often with rich incentive packages attached. Illinois has been part of that push. But\nbacklash\nhas been building from Oregon to Texas to Virginia, where residents have raised concerns about electricity consumption, water usage and limited permanent job creation.\nPritzker\nsignaled earlier this month that he\u2019s wary of approving projects that could push residential rates higher.\n\u201cIf they do threaten to raise rates, we\u2019ve got to slow them down,\u201d he said, adding that lawmakers will take up the issue this spring.\nOther governors are recalibrating, too. Pennsylvania\u2019s Josh Shapiro recently outlined new criteria for developers seeking state resources, while Florida\u2019s Ron DeSantis has backed guardrails around growth. In Georgia, lawmakers passed a bill last year to curb incentives, though Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed it.\nA freeze in Illinois could complicate land purchases and speculative infrastructure wagers in exurban and industrial corridors that have been marketed as prime data center territory, the outlet reported. The sector has been one of the few bright spots for large-scale development sites amid sluggish office and uneven multifamily growth.\nPritzker\u2019s office stressed that Illinois still exports roughly 20 percent of the electricity it generates and remains open to business, but the message is clear that the AI gold rush won\u2019t grow unchecked for the next couple of years.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The 8,200-square-foot house sits on nearly an acre just outside of the gated Cocoplum neighborhood.\nJeter, via a Delaware LLC, paid $6.5 million for the home in 2018, which means the property just sold for more than double that amount. It was on the market with Alex Pirez\u2019s Mocca Realty, most recently asking $14.9 million. Compass agent Maurice Boschetti represented the buyer.\nJeter, a hall of famer and five-time World Series champion, set team records during his 20-year career with the Yankees with the most hits, doubles and games played. Jeter headed to Miami in 2017 when he became CEO and part owner of the Miami Marlins, a role he held until 2022.\nIn 2021, Jeter and his wife, Hannah, sold their waterfront estate in Tampa\nfor $22.5 million\n, then a record for the Tampa Bay region. The property, on the Davis Islands, had been rented to\nTom Brady and his then-wife\n, model and businesswoman Gisele B\u00fcndchen.\nThe Old Cutler Road home includes a pool, basketball court, summer kitchen and outdoor entertaining areas. The house also has a primary suite, a chef\u2019s kitchen, wine cellar, office and elevator. It was built in 2004.\nThe LLC linked to Jeter paid $16.6 million in 2021 for a double-lot nearby in Gables Estates, where he is building a waterfront mansion, records show.\nCoral Gables has seen a big increase in home prices at the very high end amid a flurry of ultra luxury sales. Last month, University of Miami booster John Ruiz listed his waterfront Gables Estates mansion\nfor $175 million\n, marking the second most expensive listing in Miami-Dade.\u00a0Last year, luxury homebuilder Alex Pirez sold his waterfront Gables Estates mansion\nfor $55 million\n, and in a separate sale, billionaire businessman Jorge Mas recently purchased a mansion in the same gated community\nfor $75 million\n, a source previously told\nTRD\n.\n",

A J.P. Morgan Asset Management affiliate was the seller. J.P. Morgan bought the property at 923 Folsom Street as an entitled development site from\nTrumark Urban\nin 2015 for $20 million.\nThe per-unit price marks an increase from figures previously paid by investors in the early innings of San Francisco\u2019s post-pandemic multifamily market recovery. As the market heats back up, more investors are moving in on properties.\nRents are on the rise\nacross the city, in part due to the influx of\nartificial intelligence companies\nand their growing numbers of employees moving into town. The heightened demand and diminished supply as\nnew apartment projects come to a halt\nhave contributed to the rent increase in recent years, according to the Business Times.\nIn January, median monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment was up 16.1 percent year-over-year to $3,670, per Zumper data cited by the Business Times. In the same period, median rents for two-bedroom units were up 19.1 percent to $5,010.\nRising nine stories above Folsom Street, 923 Folsom consists of a mix of junior one-bedroom, one-bedroom and two-bedroom units. The building was 97 percent occupied as of last September, per the Business Times.\nIn October 2022, a J.P. Morgan affiliate secured a $25.5 million loan backed by 923 Folsom with maturity slated for November 2029. The residential property was appraised at $69.1 million that year. It is not clear if Stockbridge assumed that debt as part of its acquisition of the building.\nElsewhere in Greater San Francisco, Stockbridge is one of three firms working to redevelop\nTreasure Island\noff the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. Last month, the joint venture, dubbed Treasure Island Community Development, submitted a revised application to add between 1,400 and 2,800 homes to the already-planned 8,000 units slated for the island from Treasure Island Community Development, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",
