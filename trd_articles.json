        "content": "A federal judge in New Jersey sentenced Moshe Silber to 30 months in prison for his involvement in a\nbroad mortgage fraud scandal\n.\nSilber\n, 35, had turned himself in three weeks ago for violating the terms of his bond. He faced up to five years after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mortgage fraud in 2024.\nThe U.S. district court judge, Robert Kirsch, repeatedly said that Silber had committed a \u201csignificant crime\u201d and a \u201csignificant sentence was necessary.\u201d Silber, a co-conspirator of Boruch Drillman, had teamed up to buy an Ohio apartment building, the Department of Justice said. The group picked up the building, called the Williamsburg of Cincinnati, for $70 million, using a stolen identity, then flipped it to Drillman for $96 million, receiving a $74 million loan based on the second, inflated price.\nKirsch noted he deemed the fraud significant because of the \u201clayers and labyrinth of chicanery.\u201d\nThe sentence is shorter than another one Kirsch handed out in the scandal:\u00a0 Aron Puretz, who pleaded guilty last year to one count of wire fraud, got\n60 months\n, though his son, Chaim \u201cEli\u201d Puretz, only\ngot 24.\n\nSilber showed up to the packed court handcuffed, wearing a green jumpsuit with a white undershirt. Dozens of members of\nhis community\nwere present. Women read prayer books and cried during the course of the two-hour hearing.\nIn a surprise twist,\nMark Nussbaum\n\u2014\u00a0a lawyer who\nshuttered his firm\nin January and is the subject of several civil lawsuits over missing escrow funds \u2014\u00a0showed up to court wearing gold-rim glasses, a modern blazer and tight black pants. He sat with Silber\u2019s family and friends.\nAs the judge was reading Silber\u2019s sentencing, Nussbaum\u2019s phone went off, and security asked him to leave. (He returned to the courtroom at the end of the hearing.)\nKirsch observed that Silber had\nlived the American dream\n, with cars and jewelry worth $2.2 million, but still decided to commit fraud. He also noted how Silber had an annual salary of over $3 million from his father and from someone named Mr. Hoffman, yet claimed to be \u201cin the red\u201d financially.\n",

The buyer\u2019s identity had been hidden behind an LLC, which was signed for by Zalman Gottlieb.\nGottlieb is the financial controller for B&amp;H. Representatives for B&amp;H and Brookfield did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe sale of the 287,000-square-foot office property works out to $523 per square foot.\nIt\u2019s not clear what the new owner has planned for the 287,000-square-foot building, which is located around the corner from B&amp;H\u2019s iconic store at 420 Ninth Avenue. The retailer was previously reported to have\nexecutive offices at 440 Ninth Avenue\n.\n\nThe tenants at 333 West 34th Street include the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Sam Ash Music and Godiva Chocolatier. The MTA leases at least 100,000 square feet on a lease that isn\u2019t set to expire until 2035, according to\nCompStak\n.\nB&amp;H originally opened in Tribeca in 1973 and moved into its current store in 1997. The property is owned by the Kibel Company, which purchased it in 1994, according to property records.\nKnown as the Smith Barney Building, 333 West 34th Street was developed in 1954. SL Green bought the property in 2007 for $184 million and reportedly invested about $26 million worth into it. SL Green sold it to Nicholas Schorsch\u2019s American Realty Capital New York Recovery REIT in 2013 for $220 million.\nThe owner changed its name to New York REIT and then eventually went into liquidation, selling the property to Brookfield.\nThe West Side of Manhattan on 34th Street saw a surge of investment as the Related Companies\u2019 Hudson Yards and Brookfield\u2019s Manhattan West started to rise.\n",

The sale marks 10 percent off the initial price Gregg and his wife, Lisa, sought when it listed in June.\nThe couple purchased the eighth-floor unit in 2005 for $2.4 million.\nThe buyers were Elliott Investment Management partner Jason Genrich and his wife Sara, an attorney.\nThe five-bedroom, five-and-a-half bathroom home on East 82nd Street in the Upper East Side features a living room with a decorative fireplace, a primary suite with two bathrooms and two dressing rooms and a kitchen with a china closet. Two storage units were also included in the deal.\nGregg and Lisa listed the property in June for $12 million, eager to sell the unit at the prewar property as they continue to wind through a divorce battle that started almost five years ago.\n\nA Sotheby\u2019s International Realty team including Juliette Janssens had the\nco-op listing\n.\nRechler Equity, run by Gregg and cousin Mitchell Rechler, went public in 1995 and emerged as one of the tri-state area\u2019s largest real estate investment trusts. Eight years later, the company spun off its Long Island properties into Rechler Equity, an entity with roughly 7 million square feet in the portfolio today.\nRechler Equity is\nshopping the Hampton Business District\nin Westhampton Beach, a five-building, 385,000-square-foot industrial park. Bidding for the campus is expected to top $200 million, which would easily shatter Long Island\u2019s industrial sale record.\nElsewhere on the Upper East Side this week, Allen Simon \u2014 the inventor of the Wee Wee Pad \u2014\nagreed to sell\na sixth-floor apartment at 838 Eighth Avenue, which was listed for slightly less than $25 million.

        "content": "The 1.8 million-square-foot office tower planned for 350 Park Avenue is a special case.\nDuring an earnings call last month, Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s Steve Roth said the project was\u00a0 \u201cisolated, different,\u201d than other ground-up office projects in part because billionaire Ken Griffin is involved. (Griffin\u2019s Citadel is anchoring the tenant and is a partner on the project.)\nAt the time, Roth said the environment for ground-up development is otherwise so inhospitable that he doesn\u2019t think any other project will get off the ground anytime soon. Of course, RXR, TF Cornerstone and BXP might have something to say about that, given that they plan to break ground on their own\ntrophy office towers\nthis year.\nBut on Monday the Park Avenue project became the first office tower to be presented to the City Planning Commission in recent years. The Department of City Planning certified the project on Monday, kickstarting the monthslong public review of the project.\nThe project is made possible, in part, by the\n2017 rezoning\nof Midtown East, which allowed air rights from landmarked properties to be transferred to non-adjacent sites throughout the district. The development team is buying more than 480,000 square feet of air rights from St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and St. Bartholomew\u2019s Church. As part of those deals, the developers are paying more than $30 million to a public Realm improvement fund created as part of the rezoning.\nThe developers are also seeking special permits to add space for a public concourse and to make other design adjustments, hence why the project has to go through the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure.\nCorrection:\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly described the period of time that City Planning has gone without reviewing applications for office buildings, based on information from the agency.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: What City Council races are you watching closely? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The Department of City Planning will begin public review of the Jamaica Neighborhood Plan, a rezoning that is expected to pave the way for the construction of more than 12,000 housing units in the Queens neighborhood over the next 15 years.\n\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer postponed several stops on his book tour this week, citing \u201csecurity reasons\u201d as he faces criticism for voting in favor of GOP-drafted stopgap spending bill,\nPolitico reports\n. Schumer was expected to make stops in Baltimore, Washington, New York City and Philadelphia this week to promote his new book, \u201cAntisemitism in America: A Warning.\u201d\n\u2014 A professor is accusing William Paterson University in New Jersey of losing his 380 million-year-old fossils,\nGothamist reports\n. Paleontologist Martin Baker is suing the school, alleging that it botched sending the fossils to a colleague in Florida, resulting in the collection being sent to a landfill in Tennessee.\n\u2014 The city plans to build a new NYPD training facility and indoor shooting range on City Island,\nthe City reports\n. Residents of City Island have complained over the years about the noise from the shooting range. NYPD representatives say the new facility will result in \u201calmost zero to no noise at all.\u201d\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Monday was\n$33.9 million\nfor a condo unit at 15 Central Park West. The Zeckendorf-developed unit\u2019s last on-market sale was $22.7 million in 2008, though the condo is selling less than its initial listing price of over $60 million.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$150 million\nfor 333 West 34th Street. Brookfield was the seller of the Garment District office property, which is 287,000 square feet. Brookfield faces a significant loss on the asset after paying $255 million for the property seven years ago,\nper reports\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $45 million at\n10 East 67th Street\n. The Lenox Hill townhouse is 13,100 square feet and is listed by Serhant.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 48,902-square-foot, six-story, mixed-use building at 10-39 49th Avenue in Queens. The plans also feature 35 class-A units. Anthony Ng of Angelo Ng &amp; Anthony Ng Architects was the applicant on the file.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

        "content": "The Wilf family thinks its revamped development can go event bigger in New Jersey as West Orange looks to contribute its fair share of affordable housing.\nGarden Homes, the development company led by Minnesota Vikings owner Zygi Wilf, proposed building an apartment community of nearly 500 units across four buildings in a forest on top of a mountain in West Orange, Gothamist\nreported\n. A previous 136-home plan for the same land was rejected by the town.\nThe development would include 100 apartments for low- and medium-income residents, which would help West Orange on the path to contributing its fair share of affordable housing, as required under state law.\nLocal opposition is hitched to environmental concerns and the possibility the retraction of the forestland would lead to worse flooding. Environmental experts fear developing the 120-acre land \u2014 the largest undeveloped tract in a densely populated part of the state \u2014\u00a0could also lead to dangers for residents living atop a mountain.\nWest Orange Township Council president Joe Krakoviak doesn\u2019t support the project, but voted in favor of including it in West Orange\u2019s affordable housing plan in 2020, fearing the possibility of a lawsuit and a loss of control over what is ultimately built on the site through builder\u2019s remedy, a court order that allows developers to bypass town control to build affordable housing.\n\nWhen the Wilfs first proposed an initial project in the early 2000s, it was rejected and public safety was the chief reason given. The deputy fire chief testified it would be dangerous and inefficient for both residents and emergency responders.\nAfterwards, local residents banded together to try and preserve the forest as protected open space, but couldn\u2019t come up with the necessary financing.\nWest Orange officials and the Fair Share Housing Center kicked off negotiations over utilizing the land in 2015 to work towards affordable housing goals. At the time, the land was analyzed and there was no objection in including it in the town\u2019s settlement agreement, according to a Fair Share director.\nThe West Orange planning board is set to hold a hearing regarding the project on Wednesday.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner",

The 18-acre island is the last piece of real estate held by the Zieglers in Darien, where they\u2019ve embarked on a long-winded selloff.\nThe listing was first reported by\nMansion Global\n. Cynthia and her husband, Renfrew Brighton, are planning to relocate to the south.\nThe island with views of the Long Island Sound is accessible by a gated causeway. Not simply a plot of land, the island also has an 8,700-square-foot colonial home with six bedrooms, seven bathrooms and six fireplaces, and a two-bedroom guest house constructed 15 years ago.\nThere\u2019s also an infinity-edge pool, a private dock and a spa. It takes only minutes to get to the heart of Darien, an affluent town on Connecticut\u2019s Gold Coast.\n\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Lesle McElwreath has the\nlisting\n. She\u2019s pitching the two-lot listing as a way for a buyer to mold a family compound, like the Zieglers did. They\u2019ve since moved \u201cfar and wide,\u201d according to McElwreath.\nIn May 2023, the town of Darien\npaid $85 million\nfor Great Island, a peninsula off of the Gold Coast. The Steinkraus family, descended from Ziegler\u2019s granddaughter, put the property up for sale in 2016 for $175 million. The town floated a museum, youth camps, pickleball and a community pool among options for the land, which it aimed to preserve from extensive development.\nIn late 2023, descendants of the industrialist\nsold Ziegler Farm\nto an anonymous buyer for $57.5 million, more than $1 million per acre. The largely undeveloped 51-acre parcel was listed for $85 million, meaning the sellers took a 32 percent discount from the original ask.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "An odd thing happened Sunday after I tweeted about Lee Zeldin\u2019s\nabout-face\non climate change: I was attacked on X by an owner of rent-stabilized housing.\nUsually, we are on the same side. But this landlord\u2019s message accused me of being a left-wing \u201cactivist.\u201d\nAgitated, I\nfired back\n:\n\u201cFind one reporter on the planet who has written more about the failure of rent control. Let me know when you do.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t the only social media commentator to accuse me of bias. X users on the left have accused me of being an enemy of working people and a mouthpiece for the real estate industry.\nWhy? Because I advocate for privately-developed multifamily projects and don\u2019t believe social housing can solve the affordability crisis. Moreover, these critics note that I am employed by a real estate publication.\nI can see why people are confused. They want to assign everyone a label \u2014 liberal, conservative, Democrat, Republican, progressive, socialist, even libertarian. This way, instead of considering the contents of what someone says, they can just dismiss it based on a presumed tribal affiliation or financial motive.\nLet me be clear: I don\u2019t take positions on issues for the sake of a political party, ideology, employer or bank account. (No one goes into journalism to make money.)\nCredibility comes from basing your positions on economics, science, data and facts \u2014 even if it upsets your audience.\n\nTrying to live up to a label only biases your thinking. You\u2019ll start at the end \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m progressive, so I support rent control\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m conservative, so I support free markets\u201d \u2014 and then work backward, crafting a rationale for a predetermined conclusion.\nBetter to judge things on a case-by-case basis, even if the results don\u2019t fit a neat pattern. In my case:\nI favor regulation in the form of\ncongestion pricing\nbut not the\nHousing Stability and Tenant Protection Act\n.\nI support affordable housing, but not in a way that\nconcentrates poverty\n.\nI support a minimum wage, but not one that limits apartment projects to 99 units,\nas 485x has\n.\nI cheer the fundamental\nwork standards\nwon by organized labor but not the hotel workers union\u2019s special permit requirement that\nstopped hotel development cold\n.\nSometimes, a policy that seems reasonable \u2014 such as giving poor people but not high earners a break on sales tax \u2014 is impractical, which is why clothing items priced under $110 in New York are\ntax-free\neven for billionaires.\nThen there\u2019s the\nscaffold law\n, which sounds unreasonable, but on further exploration, is \u2026\neven worse\n.\nThe landlord who questioned my motives was gracious enough to delete the tweet after another reader came to my defense. And the owner then complimented my column about the legislature\u2019s\nbaseless bills\nagainst investors\u2019 buying houses.\nFor the record, on housing issues, we generally agree.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll never have enough housing in NYC until it becomes profitable to build, own, operate it,\u201d he\nposted\nrecently. \u201cYou can\u2019t\nregulate\nyour way out of a supply problem.\u201d\n",

The total contract volume was $85.4 million, up from\n$80.8 million across 27 signed deals\nreported in the previous period.\nDuring the same week last year, there were 19 contracts signed in the Brooklyn luxury market for a total volume of $75.3 million.\nThe top contract went to 246 Clinton Street in Cobble Hill with an asking price of $8.5 million.\nThe home previously sold over a decade ago for $4.4 million.\nSpanning 5,400 square feet with four beds and four baths, the 25-foot-wide home was renovated by Aman Architecture to maintain original details and add modern enhancements geothermal heating and cooling, radiant heated floors, water purification, smart home technology and an irrigation system for the garden.\nThe parlor floor features a living room with 21-foot ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows, and the garden floor functions as a self-contained one-bedroom.\nThe InHouse Group\u2019s Robert Earl and Virginia Incalcaterra had the listing.\n\nThe second priciest contract belonged to another Cobble Hill townhouse.

        "content": "Watermark Capital Group secured financing for one of Brooklyn\u2019s notable office-to-residential conversions.\nWolfe Landau\u2019s firm scored $125 million in construction financing for the conversion of 175 Pearl Street in Dumbo, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. Bravo Property Trust \u2014 an affiliate of Bravo Capital \u2014 and Integritas Capital provided the debt, which closed a year after BridgeCity Capital originated a $50.6 million acquisition loan.\nWatermark\nacquired\nthe eight-story, 185,000-square-foot office property last summer from Cannon Hill Capital Partners for $66.5 million. Landau immediately embarked on plans to convert the 1918-built property into a 19-story complex.\nOriginally, the plans reportedly called for a 14-story, 230,000-square-foot building with 238 rental units. Those plans have since shifted, with Watermark eyeing multifamily units on the eight converted floors and an 11-story condo property atop the rentals.\nCritically, the rental portion of the building will qualify for the city\u2019s 467m program, giving Landau a tax abatement for 35 years in exchange for 25 percent of apartments being earmarked for affordable housing. The abatement provides a 65 percent exemption for the first 30 years before falling to 10 percent annually for the last five years of the abatement.\n\nOccupants at the building included Constangy, Brooks, Smith &amp; Prophete, Thelab and coworking company Spaces. But a BridgeCity analyst said at the time of acquisition that all tenants had either departed or were soon to do so.\nAmenities are expected to include tenant lounges and a fitness center. Watermark expects to complete the conversion in 2027.\nLast summer, Williamsburg-based Watermark\nsubmitted a proposal\nfor a residential project on the site of a shuttered church in Greenwood Heights. The 218-unit project requires a zoning change from the district\u2019s light manufacturing zoning status to residential.\nIn June, the firm paid $15 million for Brooklyn\u2019s Hanson Place Central United Methodist Church in Fort Greene, while in late 2023, Watermark paid $12.3 million for St. Lucy\u2019s-St. Patrick Roman Catholic Church in Bedford-Stuyvesant and demolished it to make room for housing.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

That\u2019s a significant retrenchment from the\n391-unit project proposed\ntwo years ago.\nMichael Dubb\u2019s firm capsized the unit count amid concerns from the community, which Dubb said was a voluntary decision. The $220 million project now comprises 53 single-family homes, 153 townhomes and 82 villas, 29 of which would be set aside for affordable housing.\nThe development is still set to unfold on a property at the corner of Old Northport and Lawrence roads, previously home to a concrete manufacturing and sand mining operation. It also complies with Smithtown\u2019s Comprehensive Plan.\nBut opposition remains. The president of the Kings Park Community Association says the group remains concerned the development is too large and that the reduction in size will simply open the door for other developers to increase the size of their own adjacent projects. He added the project \u201cprovides no discernible benefits to the community.\u201d Concerns also include the area\u2019s environment, drinking water, traffic and schools.\n\nBeechwood is building a wastewater sewage treatment plant in conjunction with the Country Pointe Estates. The development is still a long way off; Dubb is hoping to secure all approvals by 2027 and complete work on the development by 2030.\nKings Park is home to several sizable projects, creating concerns for some community members about overdevelopment. Smithtown is creating a comprehensive master plan for Kings Park\u2019s downtown development.\nDespite concerns about overdevelopment, there\u2019s also a need to update the housing stock in the hamlet; the Country Pointe Estates project could increase the number of units in the hamlet by 4.4 percent alone, according to project consultants.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The deal was signed at the start of the year and closed a week ago.\nThe buyer used a limited liability company of its own to obscure its identity, but the entity appears to share an address with another well-known landlord, Taconic Partners, which also owns the neighboring property to the west of the asset. A representative for Taconic, however, denied the firm\u2019s involvement to\nThe Real Deal\n.\nA representative for Brookfield also did not immediately respond to a request for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe sale of the 287,000-square-foot office property works out to $523 per square foot. That\u2019s a small gain on the price per buildable square foot Brookfield paid New York REIT for the property in 2018, but not on the price per built square foot: Brookfield sold the property for more than $100 million less than\nthe $255 million\nit paid for the property seven years ago.\nTenants at the 10-story building include the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Sam Ash Music and Godiva Chocolatier. The MTA leases at least 100,000 square feet, according to\nCompStak\n, and is on a lease that isn\u2019t set to expire until 2035.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who brokered the transaction for either side.\nThe Garment District has been trimming the spirits of office landlords lately. A couple of weeks ago, Bahrain-based Investcorp took a hit on a pair of buildings in the neighborhood, selling them to Josh Rahmani\u2019s Empire Capital Holdings\nfor at least 68 percent below\nwhat it paid for them less than a decade ago.\nBrookfield\u2019s office luck has been a mixed bag of late, landing big leases but also facing serious distress. This month, the investor positioned itself to\nbuy a $93 million delinquent loan\non a distressed office building in San Francisco, which would allow the firm to ultimately take control of Vanbarton Group\u2019s 22-story property.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The lease spans the entire corner site at East 60th Street.\nAt one time, a Citibank branch occupied a portion of the ground-floor corner space of the property, which is also home to the Parc Cinq luxury building. In 2023, the building\u2019s co-op board \u2014 which controls the retail space \u2014 retained Newmark to market the site on Fifth Avenue\u2019s famed retail corridor.\nThe asking rent for the two-floor space was $4.8 million per year. The duration of the lease was not disclosed.\nA Newmark team including Jeffrey Roseman, Caleb Petersen and Drew Weiss represented the co-op board. CBRE\u2019s Jonathan Schley and GoodSpace\u2019s Chris DeCrosta represented the tenant.\n\nThe retail space used to have narrow windows befitting a bank, which have since been expanded. The alterations needed to go through the Landmarks Preservation Commission because the property is in a historic district.\nThis will be the global watchmaker\u2019s third spot in Manhattan. The Swiss company also has a sales boutique at 66 East 57th Street and a service center at 52-58 Gansevoort Street.\nIt\u2019s upping the ante with space on Fifth Avenue, long considered international shopping destination. It\u2019s set to undergo a seismic change after the city reached a deal with the merchants to redesign the street, Gothamist\nreported\nin the fall, which will see more space opened for pedestrians by doubling the width of the sidewalks between Bryant Park and Central Park.\nCity officials have estimated the redesign would cost $350 million, excluding the price of relocating underground utilities and sewers.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance subsidiary Barings purchased the property at auction on Thursday for $161 million.\nAt least three prospective bidders appeared interested in the property prior to the auction, according to court records. Barings, however, was the only qualified bidder to actually attend the event last week.\nIn May, MassMutual\nfiled a complaint\nagainst Rechler\u2019s firm after it defaulted on a $315 million mortgage, which matured earlier in the year. A spokesperson for the company said at the time that the property was high quality, but had a \u201cbroken capital structure.\u201d RXR had identified the building as \u201cdigital\u201d as opposed to \u201cfilm,\u201d meaning it was part of the company\u2019s portfolio that was deemed worth keeping.\nA loan modification was still a possibility at the time. As of May, there were about 300,000 square feet available, representing 40 percent of the building\u2019s total rentable area.\n\nRXR in April leased about 7,000 square feet to investment firm Yaupon Capital Management and 5,500 to Northampton Capital Partners, an infrastructure and energy-transition investment firm led by a former Apollo Global Management executive. RXR also signed renewals with SRS Real Estate Partners and Edelman Financial Engines and new leases with investment firm Tide Rock and Boundary Creek Advisors.\nThe 22-story, 760,000-square-foot building has estimated asking rents between $68 and $83 per square foot, according to CoStar.\nAn RXR representative declined to comment to Crain\u2019s on the auction.\nIn better news for Rechler, RXR and SL Green\nworked out a deal\non the $940 million mortgage backed by Worldwide Plaza on Eighth Avenue. The borrowers, which also include a subsidiary of the liquidating company for New York REIT, will use loan reserves to fund operating expenses and debt service shortfalls, according to Morningstar; the loan is still set to come due in November 2027.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "After seven years of searching, a pet product investor finally found a buyer for his Upper East Side condo.\nThe sixth-floor apartment at 838 Fifth Avenue, asking just under $25 million, was the priciest home to snag a signed contract in Manhattan last week, according to Olshan Realty\u2019s weekly report.\nAllen Simon, the inventor of the Wee Wee Pad, and his wife, Cynthia Simon, bought the apartment from the sponsor for just under $11 million in 2000. The couple sought to offload the condo nearly 20 years later with a $42 million asking price.\nThe 5,400-square-foot pad drifted\non and off the market\nfor several years and cycled through three brokerages before landing an inked deal. The contract includes two storage bins and a studio apartment.\nThe unit, which is due for renovation, has three bedrooms, five bathrooms and three fireplaces. It also features views overlooking Central Park and a private elevator. Amenities in the building, one of few condos lining the east side of the park, include a doorman and gym.\nCompass\u2019 Kyle Blackmon, Samantha Shuman and Ethan Mahgerefteh had the listing.\n\nThe condo was one of 36 homes in Manhattan asking $4 million or more to find buyers between March 10 and March 16. The total \u2014 just one pending deal higher than the\nprevious period\n\u2014 included 11 contracts signed for homes asking $10 million or more, the largest number of contracts for trophy properties since December.\nThe second and third most expensive homes to enter contract were two condos at 111 West 57th Street, both asking roughly $21 million, down $10 million from their asking prices when the developers started marketing them from floorplans in 2016.\nUnits 69 and 70, which were sold to different buyers, each span 3,900 square feet and have three bedrooms and three bathrooms. They also feature 14-foot ceilings and views of Central Park.\nThe Nikki Field Team with Sotheby\u2019s International is heading sales at the Billionaires\u2019 Row building, developed by JDS Development, Property Markets Group and Apollo. Amenities include a fitness center, pool, terrace and private dining room.\nOf the 36 properties, 27 were condos, five were co-ops and four were townhouses.\nThe homes\u2019 combined asking price was $323 million, for an average price of $9 million and a median of $6.5 million. The typical home spent more than 1,000 days on the market and was discounted 14 percent from the original listing price.\n",

        "content": "As the many candidates for mayor call for huge numbers of new homes \u2014 from\n200,000\n(Zohran Mamdani) to\n500,000\n(Brad Lander) to\n700,000\n(Zellnor Myrie) \u2014 Kenny Burgos is calling them out.\nThe CEO of the New York Apartment Association claims that most candidates are not truly pushing \u201cabundance\u201d as a housing goal, because none has identified a target vacancy rate.\nAbundance in housing means having far more units than is needed \u2014 that is, high vacancy \u2014 so renters and buyers negotiate prices down instead of bidding them up.\n\u201cA 5 to 10 percent vacancy rate should be the goal for a healthy housing market,\u201d Burgos said on his\nlatest podcast\n, reflecting the consensus view of economists.\nBut few city politicians take that position, for one simple reason: A vacancy rate of 5 percent would legally end the city\u2019s \u201c\nhousing emergency\n\u201d and thus rent stabilization.\n\u201cOver the past 50 years, elected officials have attempted to keep the housing stock as close to a 4 percent vacancy rate as possible,\u201d Burgos said.\nIt\u2019s a classic case of the tail wagging the dog.\nBefore\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s publisher, Amir Korangy, chides me for using an esoteric expression that confuses readers, I will explain. \u201c\nThe tail wagging the dog\n\u201d means something important or powerful is being controlled by something that isn\u2019t.\n\nIn this case, housing policy should determine the vacancy rate, not the other way around. But that isn\u2019t what happens in New York.\nBeginning with the citywide rezoning of 1961, elected officials have limited development, which along with strong demand to live in the city has kept the vacancy rate below the all-important 5 percent mark. When the rate surged after Covid, politicians\ndelayed\nthe Housing and Vacancy Survey until it went back down.\nThen it kept falling, all the way to a 56-year low of\n1.4 percent\n. That was a\nturning point\nin New York City politics. It\u2019s the reason all the candidates are talking about\nadding supply\n.\nBut, as Burgos alluded to, they don\u2019t want to add enough to solve the problem, because rent-stabilization would disappear and about 2 million tenants would storm City Hall like the January 6 mob did on Capitol Hill.\nBurgos represents owners of rent-stabilized housing, who obviously would rejoice at being able to charge market-rate rent. That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s wrong about\nrent control\nbeing a\nfailed policy\n.\nOn his podcast, the lobby group CEO challenged reporters to demand mayoral candidates reveal their desired vacancy rate. Tempting as that might be for journalists, it would serve no purpose because no Democrat could advocate for ending rent stabilization and expect to win the primary.\nBetter to cheer the plans that have a chance to break the 5 percent threshold, such as\nMyrie\u2019s\nand\nLander\u2019s\n, even if the candidates will never admit that is possible.\n",

But an analysis of public records found unsold buildings in the area accounted for\nmore than 20 percent\nof Manhattan\u2019s unsold units. An ill-timed development influx has left overpriced units piling up in Lower Manhattan.\nOne unit\nthat was sold\nin Downtown Manhattan was a West Village condo owned by Harsh Padia, CEO of HAP Capital. The sale of the unit for $60 million in an off-market deal represented a record for the most expensive condo in the area.\nThe Real Deal\nexplored the story\nof the tiny townhouse at 19 West 46th Street, a Midtown Manhattan relic that may be the third-narrowest in the entire borough.

        "content": "The Agency\u2019s Mike Fabbri was almost across the finish line on a Downtown Manhattan co-op sale.\nHis buyer, a woman in her 30s, had already signed a contract for the apartment and agreed to pay in cash. All that was left was the board application, a historically arduous process, but he was confident she fit the bill.\nThen came deal-breaking news \u2014 his buyer was the proud owner of a cockatoo.\nFabbri scrambled to pull together documentation that might convince the board that a new winged resident wasn\u2019t such a bad idea. He collected letters of recommendation from his buyer\u2019s previous landlord and a friend who used to watch her bird on occasion. Her doctor wrote a note testifying to the bird\u2019s capabilities as an emotional support animal.\nThe co-op board rejected her bid. Boards don\u2019t typically give a reason for their refusal, but given her other qualifications, Fabbri suspects it was the cockatoo.\nIn my time as a reporter, brokers across the city have recounted similar tales, especially when selling Manhattan co-ops, where rules are stringent and even the slightest error on a board package \u2014 or a dog teetering on the edge of 50 pounds \u2014 can scrap a deal.\nAs prices for co-ops stagnated, and buyers turned increasingly to condos, agents say several boards have\nrelaxed many of their policies\n, allowing buyers to finance more of their purchase or renovate their apartments in months that aren\u2019t June, July or August.\nCould requirements for pets, which appraiser Jonathan Miller\nonce referred to\nas a \u201cdog weighing-in ceremony,\u201d be the next to ease? While most still have weight and breed restrictions, blanket bans on pets are likely near impossible, since the pandemic prompted many New Yorkers to adopt a furry family member.\n\u201cPeople are not giving up their dogs, even if they love the apartment,\u201d said Brown Harris Stevens\u2019 Lisa Simonsen. \u201cSome people would probably prefer to leave behind a teenager.\u201d\nEven with restrictions still in place, brokers have found ways to skirt around the rules \u2014 and it usually involves tacking on a few numbers to the purchase price.\nOne of Simonsen\u2019s buyers was approved to buy a Park Avenue co-op, despite her two 70- to 80-pound hunting dogs.\n\u201cWhen you get to the point that you\u2019re getting full ask or over ask, they don\u2019t say no so quickly.\u201d\nUnlike Fabbri, other brokers have gotten lucky with the paperwork. About eight years ago, Compass\u2019 Vickey Barron was representing a doctor in the purchase of a co-op on lower Fifth Avenue.\n\nDuring the board interview, a member asked him if anyone would be staying in his apartment, to which he replied, his girlfriend, and potentially her dog. His response sent Barron on a chase to assemble the dog\u2019s vaccination records, adoption papers and anything else she could think of to prove the dog wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\nThe board\u2019s final request was for her buyer to bring the dog in for an interview.\nThe pup must have passed the test because Barron\u2019s buyer got the apartment. But last she checked, he\u2019d lost the girlfriend. And her dog.\nNot so fast\u2026\nThe time for acquisitions is now \u2014 at least that\u2019s what Real Trends co-founder Steve Murray\nprophesied on a panel\nat the HousingWire conference almost a year ago. And the latest headlines are proving him right.\nRumors swirled on Thursday that Compass was closing in on a deal to buy Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices. The speculation was all but confirmed in the afternoon when the Wall Street Journal reported that the firms were in\n\u201cadvanced talks,\u201d\nthough the story lacked any specifics about the pending sale.\nHomeServices CEO Gino Blefari\nrefuted the reporting\nin an email sent around to franchisees, claiming \u201cno such sale is being contemplated.\u201d\nTales of the alleged acquisition came just months after Compass purchased @properties and Christie\u2019s International Real Estate,\na $444 million sale\nthat sent shockwaves across the industry. In New York City, Compass and the local BHHS affiliate were both among the\ntop brokerages\nby sales volume in 2023, with Compass holding the No.2 spot with $5 billion in sell-side deals and BHHS in 18th with just under $100 million.\nIn the first two weeks of March, other major national brokerages have announced deals of their own. Keller Williams Realty, the largest brokerage by agent count, sold\na significant stake\nto Stone Point Capital, the parent company of CoreLogic. Earlier this week, mortgage firm Rocket Companies\npaid $1.75 billion\nto acquire Redfin.\nWith two deals in the books before the end of the first quarter, signs are pointing toward more acquisitions in the year to come \u2014 even if Compass buying BHHS isn\u2019t one of them.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nActress Grace Hightower sold the Central Park West co-op she shared with her ex-husband, Robert De Niro, for\n$18 million\nin the priciest deal to close in the city this week. The couple bought the apartment at 88 Central Park West for $21 million almost two decades ago.\nThe home, which De Niro and Hightower renovated after a fire in 2012, has five bedrooms, views of Central Park and an eat-in kitchen.\n",

        "content": "Waiting for a new Penn Station is a little like waiting for a train at Penn Station.\nYou are standing in the NJ Transit train hall, neck craned back slightly to stare down a screen that promises your train is \u201con time.\u201d A small number will appear next to your train, telling you where to catapult your body to join a swarm of commuters competing to squeeze onto the tiny escalator that will deliver you to your train.\nBut the number never appears, despite an automated voice that tells you the train is pulling up to the station. You get an alert on your phone that says all trains are suspended in and out of Penn because someone sneezed near some Amtrak signal cables. Or NJ Transit needs to investigate the sneeze; it is unclear. You know that no trains are coming, but that automated, female voice keeps informing you, over and over, that phantom trains are pulling up to the station.\nThat disembodied voice is a little like the announcements that the state is kick-starting a plan to redevelop Penn Station. You hear it, you want to believe it and then you wait and nothing happens.\nI\u2019ve been covering this project for the past 10 years, and in that time, the state has reintroduced the project at least five times. Many visions, by both the state and outside groups, have been pitched during that time.\nThis week Grand Penn Alliance, a group backed by hedge fund manager and Republican donor Thomas Klingenstein,\naccording to Gothamist\n, reupped a proposal it introduced in 2023. The plan calls for moving Madison Square Garden to the former Hotel Penn site, and building a park on the former arena site. Renderings show a classical facade, new train hall and single-level concourse. Last week Assembly member Tony Simone\npitched\nrevising plans for a megadevelopment surrounding the station to include more housing and a park on the Hotel Penn site.\nWe\u2019re still waiting on the state to announce its next move on redesigning Penn Station and whether Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s meeting with President Donald Trump on Friday will help get things moving. We\u2019ve been on standby for decades, and this train will not pull into the station until funding is lined up for the project.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: What is going on with\nBerkshire Hathaway HomeServices and Compass\n? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Mets owner Steve Cohen\u2019s casino project, which his press people will no doubt remind us should be referred to as Metropolitan Park, this week\ngot the rezoning\nit needs from the City Council, Gothamist reports. That was not a surprise, because the local Council member, Francisco Moya, supports the plan.\nCohen\u2019s main obstacle is getting parkland alienation from the state legislature, because the local state senator, Sen. Jessica Ramos, doesn\u2019t want a casino in her district.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the legislature will alienate the parkland over her objections, but that is rare for Albany. If ever an exception would be made, it would be for something like this. The parkland is really just a parking lot. \u2014\nErik Engquist\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 President Donald Trump hinted Thursday that he may seek Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s approval of a controversial pipeline as part of discussions that include congestion pricing and the redevelopment of Penn Station,\nGothamist reports\n. The so-called Constitution Pipeline would stretch 124 miles through New York\u2019s Southern Tier and western Catskills.\n\u2014 City health officials say two pet cats died after being infected with bird flu,\nthe New York Times reports\n. The cause of the infections was not clear, though potential sources include unpasteurized milk, contact with infected birds and infected food.\n\u2014 Last month Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado announced that he will not seek re-election next year. Now, it seems he\u2019s preparing to run for something else.\nCity &amp; State reports\nthat Delgado spoke at New York Somos in Albany last weekend and delivered \u201cstump speech-sounding remarks.\u201d He did not attend Hochul\u2019s private reception at the Executive Mansion.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Friday was\n$15.6 million\nfor a condo unit at 535 West End Avenue. The Upper West Side condo is 6,600 square feet. The unit was last sold in 2013 for $16.3 million.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$161.3 million\nfor 334-342 Madison Avenue. The 22-story office building was sold at auction after RXR\u2019s Scott Rechler defaulted on a\n$315 million\nmortgage on the building.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $7.2 million for 160 Leroy Street. The West Village condo is 2,000 square feet.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s\nArlene Gutterson has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 66,886-square-foot, 12-story residential building at 10 Van Cortlandt Avenue East in the Bronx. The development site sold last year for nearly $5 million. Saky Yakas of SLCE Architects is the applicant of record.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

        "content": "For some New York City property owners, there\u2019s still not enough incentive to limit carbon emissions.\nDozens of landlords are planning to pay fines for failing to comply with Local Law 97, rather than retrofit their properties to reduce emissions, according to responses by more than two dozen building sector executives to the Center for an Urban Future\nreported\nby Crain\u2019s.\nSome owners think the bottom line looks better if they absorb the fines that will be levied against them for failing to meet decarbonization goals dictated by the law. Retrofitting properties\u2019 lighting, insulation and various systems can be a costly endeavor in itself.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough sell,\u201d Center for an Urban Future policy director Eli Dvorkin told Crain\u2019s. \u201cFor many building owners, it just comes down to pretty basic math, and right now the payback period for those investments is long and getting longer with higher interest rates and rising costs for borrowing.\u201d\nBuilding owners are set to pay $268 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions that exceeds a property\u2019s 2024 limit, varying by building. Owners are required to file reports with the city by Mary to demonstrate compliance; emission reduction targets are set to grow at the end of the decade.\nSo far, a vast majority of buildings required to meet emissions targets are in compliance with the law. The Department of Buildings claims fewer than 11 percent are out of compliance with 2024-26 emissions targets.\n\nTo ensure future compliance, however, Dvorkin suggested the city may need to\nimpose higher fees\nfor violating the decarbonization law, something the Real Estate Board of New York opposes.\nAnother possibility is for the city to increase incentives and financial assistance to help property owners comply with the law, such as providing additional funds and tax credits.\n\u201cThe green economy isn\u2019t just going to build itself,\u201d Dvorkin added.\nThe aim of Local Law 97 is for the city to cut emissions 40 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2050 from 2005 levels.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The deal, which appears to be all-cash, works out to about $3,000 per square foot.\nThe nearly-200-unit building, blocks away from Washington Square Park, is\nknown for housing celebrities\nlike the Rolling Stones\u2019 Keith Richards and filmmaker Tim Burton and his ex-wife, actress Helena Bonham Carter.\nAbrams\u2019 new apartment, Unit 18GK, spans roughly 2,000 square feet and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms. It also features three terraces and views of the park and downtown Manhattan.\nThe co-op last traded for $7 million in 2008.\n\nSotheby\u2019s International\u2019s Martine Capdevielle and Brigitte Goldenberg had the listing.\nCapdevielle said the apartment would likely need a renovation, but declined to comment on the details of the sale.\nAmenities at the Art Deco co-op include full-time doormen and building staff. The landmarked building was designed by architect Harvey Wiley Corbett and built in 1927. It served as a hotel for wealthy artists until it was converted to a co-op in 1976.\nAward-winning actress Jessica Lange bought a ninth-floor unit at the building for $3.4 million in 2005, and more than a decade later,\npurchased the apartment\ndirectly above hers for $3.3 million.\nKeith Richards and his wife, Patti Hensen, sold their duplex penthouse at the co-op in 2018 for $9 million \u2014 roughly\n$1 million less\nthan they paid for it four years earlier. The couple initially tried to offload their pad for more than $12 million.\n",

        "content": "Bill and Dana Lozito\u2019s Trinity Southern is taking over development of a long-planned luxury condo project in Miami Beach called 29 Indian Creek,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nDeveloper Jason Halpern\u2019s JMH Development will remain an investor-partner and adviser on the planned 22-unit development at\n2901 and 2911 Indian Creek Drive\n, near the Faena District, Bill Lozito said. It marks the first South Florida development for New York-based Trinity, an owner-builder that has been involved in the ownership, assemblage or construction of more than 1 million square feet in its history, according to a press release.\nJMH launched sales of an 11-unit building on the site about\ntwo years ago\n.\nTrinity bought into the project for an undisclosed amount in September, Lozito said, declining to disclose more details about the deal.\n\u201cWe took the hard work that JMH has done and put our own spin on it,\u201d he said.\nThe development, which will overlook the Indian Creek waterway, will now include a 20-unit condo building with one- and two-bedroom units, and two two-story townhouses, the release said. Prices will range from $1.4 million to just over $3 million, and the developers tapped Ryan Serhant\u2019s\neponymous firm\nto lead sales. Serhant\u2019s other South Florida projects include Mercedes-Benz Places and MG Developer\u2019s\nThe George\ntownhouse development in Coral Gables.\nThe 29 Indian Creek condos will range from 820 square feet to 1,750 square feet. The townhouses will include 500-square-foot terraces with summer kitchens and wet bars.\n\nThe project will have \u201cas many [amenities] as the big developments,\u201d including a rooftop pool, gym and fitness area,\u201d Lozito said. Urban Robot is designing the development.\nBuyers will also receive membership to the beach club at the nearby Miami Beach Edition, according to the release.\nThe team could begin demolition work in April and begin construction shortly after that. The project could be completed by the end of 2026. Trinity is bringing its team down and will supplement construction labor with local subcontractors.\nThe developers will self-fund construction at the start and later take out a construction loan, Lozito said. Trinity is looking to work on additional projects in South Florida, he added.\nThe 0.3-acre Indian Creek development site previously traded in 2017 for $7.8 million. Halpern\u2019s JMH was tied up in\nlitigation\nwith former partners who included investor Dhruv Piplani. In 2022, a judge in New York dismissed the lawsuit filed by Piplani\u2019s PSB Indian Creek and affiliated entities, allowing JMH to move forward with the project.\nIt\u2019s a few blocks away from Len Blavatnik\u2019s Faena District, a luxury complex that includes the Faena House condo building and Faena Hotel Miami Beach, both developed with Alan Faena.\nAman Residences\n, developed by Vlad Doronin and backed by Blavatnik, is under construction in the district.\n",

IMC Equity\u2019s purchase also included two retail outparcels spanning 8,076 square feet built in 2023.\nIMC Equity representatives did not respond to requests for comment.\u00a0\u201cShoma Group has sold tens of thousands of units since 1985 and has never kept any assets longer than two or three years,\u201d A Shoma spokespeson said in a statement. \u201cThis has always been our business model \u2014 develop a project and sell the assets. There has been no change in our strategy.\u201d\nRoughly three weeks ago, Shoma sold a 2.5-acre shuttered car dealership at 3650 Bird Road for\n$35 million\n, abandoning plans to redevelop the site into a two-tower mixed-use project with 748 apartments and 20,000 square feet of retail.\n\nShoma sold the property for $1 million above its\n$34 million\npurchase price in 2022. A joint venture between 13th Floor Investments and Related Group, two Coconut Grove-based firms, and New York-based LeFrak Organization bought the site.\nThe same day the deal closed, Shoma paid off a $38.8 million loan secured by the former dealership, records show.\nShoma and its top two executives have faced some turmoil in recent months. In December, a foreclosure complaint was filed against Masoud and Stephanie Shojaee and two trusts under his name for allegedly failing to repay a\n$10.5 million\nloan secured by the retail component of Shoma Village. The lender voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit two weeks after filing it.\nIn January,\nCity National Bank\nfiled a foreclosure lawsuit against Masoud Shojaee and a Shoma entity alleging default on loans totaling $14.1 million, including a mortgage on a Coral Gables condo where the Shojaees reside. The bank quickly dismissed the complaint and reinstated the loans after reaching a settlement.\nShoma is also facing a pending construction defects lawsuit by the condominium association for\nTen30\n, a boutique three-story condominium with 33 units in Miami Beach that Shoma built in 2022.",

        "content": "A year into Coral Gables\u2019 Columbus Center\u2019s debt woes, Tourmaline Capital Partners paid $76 million for the property facing foreclosure.\nBryn Mawr, Pennsylvania-based Tourmaline bought the office complex consisting of a 14-story building and an eight-story building on a 2.5-acre site at 1 Alhambra Plaza, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The buyer borrowed $71.6 million for the purchase from Banesco USA.\nThe 262,000-square-foot complex was sold by receiver Chris Neilson, who was appointed by the court to oversee Columbus Center and its financials in the foreclosure suit pending against its previous owner, San Antonio, Texas-based Affinius Capital.\nAffinius started facing issues with its Columbus Center debt in March of last year. At the time, Affinius\u2019 $71.6 million loan on the property\nentered special servicing\ndue to its failure to renew an interest rate cap for its floating-rate loan, according to Morningstar Credit. That constituted a default under the financing agreement between Affinius and lender V\u00e4rde Partners.\nAn interest rate cap is a hedge against rate increases.\nIn October, Minneapolis-based V\u00e4rde filed the foreclosure suit against Affinius, alleging it defaulted on a\n$68.9 million\nloan. The total amount owed was $77.4 million, including interest and late fees, according to the complaint.\n\nThe $76 million sale to Tourmaline doesn\u2019t satisfy the total debt owed, but \u201crepresents a reasonable and fair market value,\u201d according to a motion to approve the sale filed by the receiver and V\u00e4rde in January in the foreclosure case. Tourmaline bought the property free from liens or other financial obligations.\nAffinius\u2019 attorney in the foreclosure case, Jamie Zysk Isani, didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment.\nAffinius, led by Len O\u2019Donnell, paid $10.7 million for Columbus Center in 1989, financing the purchase with a $10.6 million loan, according to records. The loan was amended several times in the following decades and assigned to V\u00e4rde in 2020.\nTourmaline, led by\nBrandon Huffman\n, also has an ownership stake in the 34-story\nCitigroup Center\nat 201 South Biscayne Boulevard in downtown Miami. In 2023, Tourmaline and New York-based Monarch Alternative Capital paid\n$250 million\nfor the 28-story office tower at 801 Brickell Avenue in Miami\u2019s Brickell. It marked the\nbiggest\nSouth Florida office deal that year.\nSouth Florida\u2019s office landlords have felt the\nsting\nfrom higher interest rates, skyrocketing property insurance and skittish lenders. While the tri-county region became a magnet for out-of-state companies from late 2020 through 2022, demand slowed in recent years. In some cases, even well-leased buildings have struggled due to higher interest rates.\nIn downtown Fort Lauderdale, lender Trimont filed a foreclosure suit in August against Alliance HP for allegedly defaulting on a\n$59.2 million\nloan for the 28-story One Financial Plaza at 100 Southeast Third Avenue. The case is pending, with Neilson serving as the court-appointed receiver for that property as well.\n",

The developers lease the site from Broward College.\nSantander Bank is the lender for the construction financing. Houston-based Marble Capital made a preferred equity investment for an undisclosed amount.\nPeter Mekras led the Aztec Group team that represented the developers in the loan and equity investment.\nParks at Davie will consist of studios and one- to three-bedroom apartments, with units ranging from 568 square feet to 1,415 square feet. It will include 6,200 square feet of retail and co-working space.\nAbout 77 of the units will be at workforce rents, according to a 13th Floor spokesperson. The targeted area median income will be determined when the project is closer to completion.\nConstruction will start this month, and is expected to be completed in 2027, the release says.\n13th Floor\n, led by Arnaud Karsenti, has completed about 3,900 residential units since its founding in 2008 and has more than 4,800 units in the pipeline, according to the release.\n\nIn July, the firm completed the\n420-unit Savio\napartment complex at 1874 Heron Club Drive in Delray Beach. The Ardid family\u2019s Key International, Wexford Real Estate Investors and CDS International Holdings partnered with 13th Floor on Savio, which marked the first phase of their Parks at Delray development slated for a total of 693 apartments and 54 townhouses.\nIn Hallandale Beach, 13th Floor is developing the five-story, 398-unit\nParks at Hallandale\napartment complex at 2002 Pembroke Road.\nJSB, led by J. Jay Lobell, is a private equity and alternative investment firm that focuses on real estate, according to its website. It has ramped up its South Florida investment in recent years.\nIn December, JSB paid\n$69 million\nfor the 197-unit Stellar at Emerald Hills apartment complex at 5800-5840 Lakeshore Drive in Dania Beach. JSB also bought the Havn Residences &amp; Yacht Club condo complex with 36 units and 54 boat slips at 176 Lake Drive in Palm Beach Shores for\n$58.5 million\nin 2023.\nThe Parks at Davie construction loan comes as South Florida faces a multifamily supply overhang. Developers completed a record\n18,600 apartments last year\n, outpacing 15,000 new leases signed, according to CoStar Group data. That\u2019s led to slower lease-ups, an increase in concessions and a slight decrease in rents. South Florida\u2019s median rent dropped by nearly 2 percent in February, year-over-year, a\nRealtor.com report\nshows.\nDemand is expected to catch up to supply this year and next year due to a slowdown of construction starts.\nSouth Florida multifamily\nconstruction lending\ncontinues to flow. This month, TM Real Estate landed\n$53.5 million\nto build the 250-unit Shalimar at Boynton Beach complex at 3570 West Boynton Beach Boulevard in Boynton Beach. That came on the heels of Savanna scoring a\n$380 million\nconstruction loan for the two 26-story Olara project with 170 apartments and 287 condos at 1919 North Flagler Drive in West Palm Beach.\n",

        "content": "Adam Neumann\u2019s Flow nabbed a $51 million acquisition loan and is partnering with Canada Global for a planned mixed-use project on an El Portal development site.\nNew York-based Ladder Capital provided the mortgage to a Delaware entity with ties to Flow that paid\n$71.5 million\nfor a 16-acre former trailer park at 8500 Biscayne Boulevard, records show.\nCanada Global\n, an Israeli real estate firm led by Assaf Tuchmair and Barak Rosen, came on board as a majority partner shortly after Miami-based Flow won a January court auction for the vacant property, a source familiar with the joint venture told\nThe Real Deal\n. In November, the two firms also partnered to purchase an Aventura office complex for\n$116.2 million\n.\nOn the El Portal site, the joint venture is planning to build 2,380-plus apartments with commercial space and a school, the source said. Approved for a 3 million-square-foot mixed-use project with 150 units per acre, a developer can build up to roughly 2,400 apartments.\n\nThe site, previously known as the Little Farm trailer park, has sat empty since 2016 when 45 residents settled a lawsuit with the village of El Portal and the previous ownership entity, led by Fu Jing \u201cLeo\u201d Wu. The Village and Wu\u2019s entity agreed to pay the residents $8,000 each for relocation costs. Wu also managed an entity that owned a former federal immigration building at 7880 Biscayne Boulevard in Miami.\nThe trailer park site and the immigration building landed in court receivership as a result of a 2020 Miami-Dade civil lawsuit alleging Wu\u2019s entities misappropriated funds from\nEB-5 visa investors\n. The federal program grants permanent residency to foreign investors who finance business and real estate development projects in the U.S., as well as their immediate family members.\nIn 2023, receiver Michael Goldberg entered into a settlement agreement with Wu that allowed the sale of the properties to move forward without Wu\u2019s objections. Upon both deals closing, Wu will receive $5 million from the sale proceeds. In 2023, Miami-based B Group Capital Management bought the immigration building for\n$23 million\n, but abandoned plans to also buy Little Farm.\nIn October, Miami-based Melo Group submitted a\n$35 million\nstalking horse bid for the 16-acre trailer park. During the court auction two months ago, Melo lost a bidding war to Flow by $400,000.",

        "content": "A group of investors bought Airport Commerce Park near Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport for $18.3 million.\nThe deal comes amid a paradox for South Florida\u2019s office market. While aging suburban buildings have traded at discounts and\nforeclosures\nhave popped up, Broward County recently scored two office deals for over $200 million each.\nAn entity managed by Jorge Linkewer, principal at Aventura-based Triarch Capital Group, as well as Sarah and Sergio Selcer bought the complex at 4101 Ravenswood Road in Dania Beach from ACP Partners, according to records and real estate database Vizzda.\nSergio Selcer is associated with Step by Step Management in Coconut Creek. ACP is managed by Mario Henriquez and affiliated with Brickell-based JCT Management, according to Vizzda and state corporate records.\nThe buyers borrowed $10.3 million from Popular Bank.\nCompleted in 1987, Airport Commerce Park consists of four one-story buildings on a 6.6-acre site, property records show. ACP Partners paid $13.3 million for the property in 2007.\nTenants include computer repair service Rescuecom of Fort Lauderdale, Ocean Exotic Car Rental, Precision Air Conditioning, Digital Marketing Service Pro and the Consulate of Sweden.\n\nTriarch, founded in 1996 by Linkewer, Daniel Halberstein and Mario Grosfeld, has a portfolio of about 3.5 million square feet of commercial real estate, according to its website. Linkewer also is founder of brokerage Axiom Capital Advisors, which lists the same Aventura office as Triarch.\nTriarch is a frequent South Florida investor. In 2023, it bought the Shoppes at 41st Street plaza at 10355 and 10405 Northwest 41st Street in Doral for\n$18 million\n. That came on the heels of Triarch\u2019s\n$7.2 million\npurchase of an industrial outdoor storage site at 12601 West Okeechobee Road in Hialeah Gardens.\nIn 2020, the firm scored a\n$35 million\nrefinancing for the One Turnberry Place office building at 19495 Biscayne Boulevard in Aventura, which Triarch bought in 2011 for $53 million.\nIn the fourth quarter, South Florida\noffice\nvacancies and asking rents\nremained flat or slightly increased\n, year-over-year, according to an Avison Young report. Broward County\u2019s average asking rent hit $40.18 per square foot, up from $38.34 a square foot during the same period of 2023. The vacancy rate fell to 14.5 percent from 16.8 percent. But in all of last year,\nBroward\u2019s\ntotal leasing was 2.4 million square feet, a 27 percent decline from 2023, the Avison report shows.\nGenerally, real estate has felt the sting from higher interest rates, skyrocketing insurance and a slowdown of the influx of out-of-state companies, experts have said.\nSome properties have traded at a discount. In September, Galium Capital bought the Lake Shore Plaza II office building at 1300 Concord Terrace in Sunrise for\n$17 million\n, a nearly 47 percent discount from its price in 2013. In January, Accesso Partners bought the six-story Sawgrass Lake Center at 13450 West Sunrise Boulevard in Sunrise for\n$36.5 million\n, a 36.4 percent discount from its price in 2018.\nStill, downtown Fort Lauderdale scored two mammoth deals. Last month, DWS Group sold the\u00a0 Las Olas Centre I &amp; II at 350 and 450 East Las Olas Boulevard for\n$208 million\n, and the\u00a0 Bank of America Plaza at Las Olas City Centre at 401 East Las Olas Boulevard for\n$220 million\n.\n",

        "content": "A partially built luxury condo project in North Bay Village, the city\u2019s first in more than a decade, may be back on track.\nNever one to shy away from a challenge, Vivian Dimond\nstepped in\nto take over development and construction of what is now called Tula Residences, a 54-unit, 21-story (once it\u2019s finished) building on the waterfront.\nConstruction workers disappeared from the site in late 2023.\nDimond\u2019s Bayshore Grove Capital took over the LLC that owns the property last year. Malaysian developer Pacific &amp; Orient, led by CEO Thye Seng Chan, will remain a partner in the project.\nIn Miami, most condo developers use the following strategy: buy land, hire a public relations firm to tease a project launch, begin sales, open a sales center, publicize that opening \u2014 maybe with a splashy party \u2014 etc.\nChan didn\u2019t really follow that approach. His firm waited to launch sales of the project, didn\u2019t make much of a splash when he did, and self-funded construction. The unit layouts weren\u2019t ideal, brokers and developers told me.\nLiens began to pile up, including nearly $7 million sought by the former general contractor. One vendor sued. That\u2019s when everything went dark. Residents on the island were not happy.\nI don\u2019t know exactly when Dimond\u2019s Bayshore Grove finalized its deal, but it made sense when I learned that she would be reviving the project. She made changes to the layout and floor plans, moved the lobby from the sixth floor (unusual choice by the original developer) to the ground floor, and plans to install larger windows for better views.\nOnce the building is completed in 2026, it will mark eight years since Pacific &amp; Orient secured its approvals.\nDimond\u2019s sales team, led by Brown Harris Stevens\u2019 Ellis Bachman, is tasked with selling nearly all of the units. Pacific &amp; Orient only had two buyers with contracts at the North Bay Village project. One was refunded, and another is staying in the deal, Dimond told me.\nWhile many developers seemed to shy away from the project, she saw it as an opportunity to be the first one out of the gate.\nNorth Bay Village has attracted tens of millions of dollars of investment, if not more, in recent years. But no one has gotten this far. Even though others (Eichner, Shoma, Sunbeam, Riviera Horizons, etc.) have launched sales of their projects, garnering much more attention than what is now called Tula ever did, Dimond\u2019s project is the furthest along, construction-wise.\nWhile there are downsides to picking up a project midway through construction, the upsides may outweigh them.\n\nIt will become harder and more expensive to complete a building from scratch today, given the situation with tariffs, concerns over construction labor as a result of immigration policies, inflation and more.\nBuyers are also less enthusiastic about waiting four, five, six years for a project to be completed. This is at a time when dozens of new condo developments are in the pipeline. Despite developer and broker talk of strong presales, we\u2019re hearing that a small number of projects are stalled.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nSo many Live Local Act project applications have been filed in South Florida. Are these developments getting built? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential:\nDeveloper James Curnin and his wife Jennifer sold their waterfront 9,640-square-foot home at 66 La Gorce Circle in Miami Beach\nfor $60 million\n. A land trust named after the address purchased the property.\nCommercial loan:\nPPG Development and BH3 Management secured a\n$225 million refinancing\nof the loan backing Slate Hallandale Beach, a 250-unit apartment tower next to the Shell Bay Club. J.P. Morgan and Monroe Capital provided the latest financing for the building, which was completed in 2022. The lenders have both worked closely with Witkoff, which is partnering with PPG on the adjacent Shell Bay project.\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nA new oceanfront estate in Palm Beach hit the market\nfor $45 million\n. The six-bedroom, seven-bathroom and one-half-bath mansion at 1742 South Ocean Boulevard was completed last year on a 0.6-acre lot. Christian Angle of Christian Angle Real Estate has the listing for the 8,170-square-foot house. Property records show a company managed by recycling mogul Anthony Lomangino paid $10 million for the lot in 2020 \u2014 a steal in Palm Beach.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\nThe Great Elephant Migration, an art installation of 100 life-size elephant sculptures, is actually\nstill in South Florida\n. You may remember it as one of the most photographed Art Basel exhibits last year. Three elephants are on display at Four Seasons Hotel and Residences Fort Lauderdale, available to the public, while another four are at Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach. They\u2019ll be there until Tuesday.\nElsewhere in Florida\nSwerdlow Group agreed to implement a voluntary heat safety program for construction workers at its $3 billion project in Little River and Little Haiti,\nPrism\nreports. The Miami-Dade Housing Committee recently reviewed the development agreement for the 63-acre mixed-use development. Swerdlow is the first to make such a voluntary move after state lawmakers passed House Bill 433, which bans local governments from mandating heat protections.\nDevelopers are increasingly building homes on former orange groves, marking another threat to Florida\u2019s orange industry, according to the\nAssociated Press\n. Consumers are also drinking less orange juice, and citrus greening disease has hit the industry hard in recent decades.\nRepublican and Democratic lawmakers grilled state insurance regulators about a report that showed insurers funneled billions of dollars to affiliates between 2017 and 2019 while they claimed to lose money. The regulators told lawmakers that the report was never given to the legislature because it was unfinished, the\nTampa Bay Times\nreports. Former Insurance Commissioner David Altmaier commissioned the report, but after he abruptly left his post to become a lobbyist, it was left in draft form.",

        "content": "Sam Nazarian, once known as the \u201cEmperor of Cool\u201d in the nightlife industry has turned over a new leaf.\nIn 2008, Bloomberg celebrated his kingdom of hotspots in Los Angeles, and if you\u2019ve ever eaten at Katsuya or stayed at an SLS hotel you can understand why. The founder of SBE knows how to make hotspots buzzy for a work-hard, play-hard crowd of A-listers.\nBy 2019, Nazarian had nine offices around the world and 11,000 employees. \u201cI was the majority owner of my company, and I was the most unhealthy I\u2019d ever been,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the same ambition and drive that I\u2019d had.\u201d\nThat year, he\nsold the hotel brands in a cash-and-asset swap to Accor\n.\n\u201cI was looking for a reset,\u201d he said. The deal included a three-year non-compete clause in the lifestyle sector, giving him time to contemplate his next \u201cdisruption.\u201d\nNazarian turned to friends who were feeling the same burn-out. They turned him on to health types like\nMark Hyman\nand \u201cbiohacker\u201d Gary Brecka. From there, his wellness journey took him to luxury longevity retreats like SHA and Lanserhof and Chenot.\nThen along came Tony Robbins.\nRobbins was early to some of wellness\u2019s more unconventional practices: \u201cTony was the first guy who was going in an ice bath, and everyone thought he was crazy,\u201d as Nazarian put it. Nazarian visited Robbins\u2019 Fountain Life longevity center in Orlando, Florida. There, a bevy of tests found a \u201cpretty aggressive\u201d aneurysm in his brain.\n\u201cOver the next 30 days, I saw four top neurosurgeons, got four opinions, did more testing and then had a seven hour brain surgery that removed the aneurysm,\u201d he told\nThe Real Deal.\nThe aneurysm is gone, but Nazarian\u2019s commitment to preventative health and his relationship with Robbins continue.\nNazarian and Robbins are working\ntogether on wellness-focused hotels\nand longevity centers with a new brand called the Estate. (They\u2019ve already\ninked a lease\nfor a center at the Reuben Brothers\u2019 Century Plaza, have a hotel under development in St. Kitts, and plan 25 locations by 2030.) Meanwhile, Nazarian and entertainer Marc Anthony, who\u2019s also a partner on the Estate, launched a new hotel brand. HQ, which is a partnership with Wyndham, will also have a wellness and longevity strategy.\nNazarian\u2019s next\nbusiness boom\nmay not have the same hard-partying style as the last one, and his weekends reflect that. With a wife, three kids and a home in Miami\u2019s Gables Estates neighborhood, weekends are more about kids\u2019 basketball games and family dinners than the nightlife scene or even business meetings.\nFriday\nEvening\nShabbat dinner with my wife and three kids. We do it every Friday night. We\u2019re not very religious, but my kids are eight, six and three so it\u2019s something we\u2019ve always had as part of our cultural component.\nMy mom flew in from L.A., so having her with us was a treat as well. I grew up in Los Angeles but we\u2019ve lived in Miami for five years now. This is our biggest market area, and we made a conscious effort in 2019 to raise our kids in Miami as well, so we got a place in Coral Gables, where the best schools are.\n\nWe also have access to more quality-of-life things here, like being out on the water. We have a place in the Bahamas as well. And obviously proximity to Europe, which is very important to us; my wife\u2019s European, so we have a home in Montenegro. It\u2019s just easier to get around the world from Miami.\nSaturday\nMorning\nI took my three-year-old son to soccer practice, then I took my daughters to tennis practice at Coral Oaks.\nAfternoon\nAt 12 p.m., I had lunch on my yacht with one of our bankers from CFG, Erik Howard. Actually, on the way there I went and saw a site, but we haven\u2019t announced that yet.\nThe rest of the day, we took the boat out to Fisher Island Bay as a family. In L.A., you\u2019re on the water, but you never go out in the water. Now we have a boat in the back of our house, a 48-foot bay boat, but we also ended up buying the yacht in 2021. That\u2019s a 42-meter Benetti. Nothing crazy, but big enough for us and a couple friends.\nUsually we keep it in the Caribbean, at our place in the Bahamas or we\u2019ll go to St. Barths or discover new islands. But it just so happened to be here, so we jumped on it. It\u2019s such a pleasure to have it and get to see the city from the water.\nSunday\nMorning\nI worked out in the morning. We have these oxygen and red light machines in our house, so I got in the hyperbaric chamber and red light in addition to the workout. Then I took the girls to Hebrew school.\nAfternoon\nI went to a meeting with our general contractor. We\u2019re actually building a permanent bio-hacking and longevity addition [on our house]. Our team from the Estates designed it. When you think about home gyms and spas, they\u2019ve been very traditional. We really believe that there are some key components \u2013 saunas, the red light and oxygen \u2014 that can pivotally change the different KPIs you\u2019re looking for, whether it\u2019s better sleep, deeper sleep \u2026 there are lots of benefits.\nRight now I have the machinery, and now we\u2019re integrating it into a new structure. Another part of it is a meditation room, kind of a quiet room. We have three young kids, they can\u2019t find you there.\nAfter that I took my son to the park before I coached my daughters\u2019 basketball game from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Then I had meetings from 4 p.m to 7 p.m on Sunday, because we had a board meeting on Monday.\nWant to hear more about Sam Nazarian\u2019s next chapter? TRD subscribers can join him at the next Salon Series event on April 3 to learn more.\nRSVP today\n.",

The tower is fully leased.\nFaisal Ashraf of Lotus Capital Partners represented the owners in the refinancing.\nHallandale Beach-based PPG and Paramus, New Jersey-based Premium Capital Resources bought the development site in 2018 for\n$43.3 million\n. The property includes the adjacent 127-acre former Diplomat Golf &amp; Tennis Club, which the firms redeveloped into the luxury Shell Bay Club.\nAfter Ari Pearl\u2019s PPG and Michael Herman\u2019s Premium completed Slate in 2022, Fort Lauderdale-based BH3 bought a 50 percent stake in the tower, according to the release. Premium Capital still has a stake in the building, a PPG spokesperson said.\n\nBH3 is led by co-founders Gregory Freedman and Daniel Lebensohn, as well as executive chairman Eric Edidin.\nThe recent refinancing replaces a\n$150 million\nrefinancing PPG and Premium had scored for the tower in 2022, records show.\nDesigned by Kobi Karp, Slate consists of one- to four-bedroom apartments, ranging from 859 square feet to 3,230 square feet, according to the release.

        "content": "The First Amendment may not save O Cinema from getting evicted for screening an Oscar winning documentary about the Gaza War and events that led to it.\nOn Wednesday, the\nMiami Beach\nCity Commission will consider Mayor Steven Meiner\u2019s request to terminate O Cinema\u2019s lease for a movie theater space inside a city-owned historic building at 1130 Washington Avenue, as well as end roughly $40,000 in grants to the nonprofit arthouse.\nMeiner moved to kick out O Cinema after it went ahead with sold-out showings of \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a film about the ongoing conflict between Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank. Directed by Palestinian activist Basel Adra and Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham, \u201cNo Other Land\u201d won best documentary feature at this year\u2019s Academy Awards.\nIn a newsletter to his constituents, Meiner called the film \u201ca false one-sided propaganda attack on the Jewish people that is not consistent with the values of our City and residents.\u201d\nMeiner and city officials did not respond to requests for comment. O Cinema co-founder Kareem Tabsch told\nThe Real Deal\nthat the nonprofit art house is ready to pursue \u201call courses to allow us to continue operating in Miami Beach.\u201d\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t ruled out what those measures would be,\u201d Tabsch said. \u201cI think it is very clear that when we decided to continue showing this film, [Meiner] introduced a resolution to pull our funding and cancel the lease.\u201d\nO Cinema is getting legal counsel from the Florida chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and Community Justice Project, \u201c Tabsch added.\nWhile some civil libertarians believe Miami Beach officials would be violating O Cinema\u2019s right to free speech by evicting the theater, the lease terms favor the city, according to commercial real estate experts.\n\nA copy of the agreement obtained by\nThe Real Deal\nshows that the city can terminate the lease \u201cwithout cause and without liability to the landlord\u201d as long as O Cinema is given 180 days prior written notice. O Cinema\u2019s five-year lease expired last year, but in April the city commission approved the tenant\u2019s option to renew for another two years, city records show.\n\u201cTo the extent it can be shown that canceling the lease was based [on the content of \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d] there would be a First Amendment violation claim,\u201d said Miami-based attorney Mitchell Jagodinski. \u201cThe question for the court would be whether the operator of the theater waived this claim via the lease contract.\u201d\nJagodinski is representing the developers of\nMiami Wilds\n, a canceled mixed-use project in unincorporated southwest Miami-Dade County that planned to feature a water park, 200-room hotel and 20,000 square feet of restaurants. Last year, Miami-Dade sued Mami Wilds to terminate a 2022 lease agreement to build the project on 66 acres of county-owned land.\nMiami Wilds\ncountersued by alleging Miami-Dade Mayor Danielle Levine Cava violated the developers\u2019 rights by allegedly killing the deal to appease environmental groups and boost her reelection chances.\nO Cinema likely waived a First Amendment claim by agreeing to the city\u2019s \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d clause, Jagodinski said. \u201cIt essentially gives the city full control to just cancel [the lease] whenever they want for whatever reason,\u201d he explained. \u201c[O Cinema] agreed to this type of situation eventually happening.\u201d\nMiami Beach\nelected officials are definitely within their purview to end the business relationship with O Cinema, said Jose Smith, a former city attorney for Miami Beach and North Miami Beach who also served on the Miami Beach City Commission from 1997 to 2005.\n\u201cI have not seen the entire documentary or the city\u2019s lease with O Cinema,\u201d Smith said via text. \u201cHowever, the First Amendment does not require the city to permit its tenant, in a city owned venue, to espouse anti-Semitic, hateful, one-sided propaganda, or to be subsidized by the city for doing so.\u201d\nYet, Norman Powell, a North Bay Village-based real estate lawyer who is also the city attorney for\nMiramar\n, isn\u2019t convinced the city of Miami Beach\u2019s \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d clause would trump a potential First Amendment violation claim by O Cinema.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the mayor\u2019s primary reason for terminating the lease is because he doesn\u2019t like this documentary being played there,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThe basis for termination is really not for convenience. It\u2019s being terminated to stifle free speech.\u201d",

Halfen and Rosenblatt financed the purchase with a $13.5 million loan from Amerant Bank, according to property records.\nRosenblatt and Halfen are both spec developers. In August, Rosenblatt sold a waterfront spec mansion in Bay Harbor Islands for\na record $22 million\n. In 2023, Halfen, who heads Treo Construction, sold a waterfront spec house in Golden Beach for\n$15 million\n.\n\nKrelstein bought the 8,300-square-foot Bay Point mansion for $11.2 million in 2020, records show. It was built in 1963 on 0.8 acres and has 190 feet of waterfront, according to records and the listing. It was renovated in 2023 and has six bedrooms and six bathrooms, records show.\nKrelstein first listed the mansion for $35 million in 2022, before upping the asking price to $42 million later that year. The price was subsequently slashed three times before the home was delisted in June, Zillow shows.\nIt\u2019s been a record year for luxury deals in Miami\u2019s\nBay Point\nneighborhood. In January, Fatos Rosenberg sold a 1.7-acre waterfront estate for\n$85 million\n, making it the most expensive home ever sold in Bay Point.

        "content": "Affordable housing developer Lewis Swezy plans an 80-unit age-restricted apartment project near the Earlington Heights Metrorail stop in Miami-Dade County.\nSwezy, through his Miami Lakes-based Centennial Management, wants to develop the six-story building with 60 one-bedroom apartments and 20 two-bedroom apartments on a 0.7-acre site at 4052 Northwest 22nd Avenue in an unincorporated area of the county, according to an application submitted to Miami-Dade this week. It will include rooftop amenities, 800 square feet of commercial space and 42 parking spaces.\nThe project, called Earlington Court Affordable Housing, will be for tenants 55 and older who earn from 30 percent to 80 percent of the area median income, Swezy said. A majority of the apartments will be for those earning 60 percent of AMI.\nMiami-Dade\u2019s annual AMI is $79,400, the Florida Housing Finance Corporation shows. To qualify for a unit designated for tenants at the 60 percent AMI bracket, a one-person household can\u2019t earn more than $47,700, and a two-person household can\u2019t earn more than $54,480.\nCentennial paid $875,000 for the five-lot vacant development site in 2019, records show.\nThe firm is asking the county for an administrative site plan review. It originally filed a request for a pre-application meeting in December.\nSwezy focuses on affordable housing, mainly using the state tax credit program that awards developers tax credits that they sell to investors and use the proceeds to finance projects. Centennial\u2019s portfolio spans more than 3,500 affordable units.\n\nIn recent proposals, Swezy filed an application to Miami-Dade last summer for an\neight-story, 132-unit\nage-restricted building at 13841 Southwest 252nd Street in the Princeton neighborhood.\nTax credits and other state and municipal government financing mechanisms make\naffordable housing\nmore resilient to elevated interest rates. While higher rates and other economic headwinds have\npaused\nsome planned\nmultifamily\nprojects, affordable rental development has continued. Also, demand is nearly ensured as many South Floridians are priced out of market-rate apartments due to\nrecord rent\nhikes in 2021 and 2022.\nAffordable housing also has proved a boon for developers. Last month, Swezy paid\n$14.8 million\nfor a six-bedroom Fisher Island home at 6923 Valencia Drive. He bought it from the widow of the late Russian real estate tycoon Dmitry Zelenov.\nDeveloper Michael Swerdlow wants to redevelop five Miami-Dade public housing complexes with\n5,730\naffordable and workforce apartments. On Tuesday, a county committee approved the project that would replace existing public housing complexes Victory Homes at 520 Northwest 75th Street, Newberg at 7200 Northeast Miami Court, Gwen Cherry 22 at 7101 Northeast Miami Court, Gwen Cherry 06 at the intersection of Northwest 71st Street and Northwest First Court, and New Haven Gardens at 7200 Northeast Second Avenue in Miami.\nThe P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group plans an\neight-story, 98-unit\nbuilding at 5350 West Flagler Street in Miami\u2019s Flagami. All units will be for households earning up to 30 percent of AMI.\nAffordable housing developers also have seized on the Live Local Act, a state law that allows bigger projects than permitted by a site\u2019s zoning and also grants property tax breaks to developers.\nRussell Galbut\u2019s GFO Investments family office proposes a\n410-unit Live Local Act project\nwith a 19-story and a 16-story building at 7350 Coral Way in Miami-Dade\u2019s Corral Terrace neighborhood. Dr. Jorge Perez, who specializes in neonatology and neonatal medicine, is a partner on the development and will lease a seven-story medical office building part of the project.\n",

It will relocate from 7,800 square feet at 777 South Figueroa Street and 9,973 square feet at 1100 Glendon Avenue, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.\nThe length of the lease, a Savills spokesperson said, is \u201cmulti-year.\u201d\nAsking rent in the building ranges from $6.50 to $7.50, according to a spokesperson for the landlord.\nThe Century City building, a 28-story, 627,000-square-foot, Class-A high-rise office building, is undergoing a $100 million redevelopment together with 1800 Avenue of the Stars by owner\nCentury City-based\nAnderson.

The seller was locally based LHMLP.\nThe deal works out to nearly $140,500 per room. Brokers Oliver Shah and Justin Myers of Atlas Hospitality Group represented the buyers. It\u2019s not clear what LHMLP paid for the property, and when.\nThe 87,500-square-foot economy class hotel, built in 1968, is near Interstate 5 at El Toro Road. Its rooms were recently offered for discount rates for refugees of January\u2019s fires in Pacific Palisades and Altadena.\nHotel sales in central and south OC have cooled, according to CoStar. Sales between Newport Beach and Dana Point were $125 million during the last \u201cvolume year,\u201d compared to a three-year average of $340 million a year.\nThe market didn\u2019t prevent Haley from doing well in its sale late last year of a 120-room Travelodge by Wyndham Orange County Airport/ Costa Mesa at 1400 Bristol Street\nIn December, the county agreed to buy the Travelodge from Haley for conversion into homeless housing under the state\u2019s\nProject Homekey program\n. The hotel purchase and conversion into 78 supported apartments was to cost\n$45 million\n.\n\nThe $45 million redevelopment project, dubbed Homekey Bristol, included a $4 million contribution from Costa Mesa and $3 million from neighboring Newport Beach. Orange County kicked in $7 million and nearly 50 project-based vouchers. The grants totalled\n$14 million\n.\nThe bulk of the money came from a Project Homekey grant from the state Department of Housing and Community Development, which kicked in\n$29 million\nfor the project led by American Family Housing. The Midway City-based nonprofit developer was to revamp the motel and run it as supportive housing.\nSuch grants generally cover the purchase of the property. In the case of the Travelodge, that means Haley likely sold the 120-room hotel for $29 million, or $241,667 per room.\nHaley Hospitality bought the Travelodge, built in 1970, in 2021 for\n$14 million\n, or $116,667 per room, according to the Central OC Times. The purchase came at the height of the pandemic, when the\nhotel industry tanked\nwhile\ntens of thousands of rooms\nwent dark.\nThree years later, the county, via a grant from the state, bought the 54-year-old motor inn for a 107 percent markup for its last traded price. And Haley walked away with a windfall.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

This month, the Planning Commission approved the revised environmental impact report for the project known as New Beatrice West.\nPlans include 3,400 square feet of shops and restaurants. An existing office building, home to Gehry Partners, would be retained.\nThe U-shaped, 135-foot-tall project, designed by Gehry, will have upper level setbacks to create terrace decks.\nConstruction is expected to take 18 months. A project cost and when NSB is expected to break ground were not disclosed.\n\nKarney Management, a property owner nearby, had repeatedly appealed the office building to attempt to force the project to undergo further environmental review, without success.\nThe company led by Aliza Karney Guren\nsued the City of Los Angeles\nto block the project. In January 2020, a Los Angeles judge ruled that the mitigated negative declaration conducted for the project had not sufficiently considered impacts to aesthetics, noise and traffic congestion.\nAs a result, the Planning Department was forced to redo the environmental review process, although project entitlements were not overturned by the decision, according to Urbanize.\nNew Beatrice West is the second collaboration between Larry Field, founder of NSB Associates, and his longtime friend Frank Gehry. In 2023, NSB completed its two-building,\n80,000-square-foot offices\n, designed by Gehry,\nin El Segundo\n.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

One is, that can\u2019t happen. It has to go back to voters. And the other is that it might be able to happen with action from the council and the mayor\u2019s office.\n\u201cWe\u2019re having that investigated through our attorneys right now,\u201d Bass said.\nShe hasn\u2019t spoken further about the topic since.\nZach Seidl, the mayor\u2019s communications deputy, didn\u2019t answer specific questions from\nThe Real Deal\nabout Bass\u2019 plans, but said in a statement to\nThe Real Deal\nFriday, \u201cwe are going to look at every possible option to support fire survivors and accelerate recovery.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear how the mayor or City Council could defy the results of the local ballot measure, which went into effect in 2023 and imposes a 4 percent tax on property sales above $5 million and a 5.5 percent tax on sales over $10 million.\n\nThe\nCity Charter states\nthat ballot measures can be overturned by voters in a subsequent election or by amending the City Charter to supersede the ballot measure.\nA spokesperson for L.A. City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMeasure ULA aimed to raise up to $1.1 billion in tax revenue to fight homelessness and build affordable housing. It has so far fallen far short of that goal, raising\nabout $300 million in its first year on the books\n.\nFewer than 5 percent of deals meet the threshold to be subject to the tax, but historically they account for about 40 percent the city\u2019s total property tax revenue, according to an analysis by Mott Smith, a founding member of the Council of Infill Builders and adjunct professor at the USC Price School of Public Policy.\nDuring her 2022 campaign for mayor, Bass\nnever took a stance supporting\nthe ballot measure, but she\napplauded a court ruling\ndismissing a lawsuit against it the following year.\nAnd later that year the former deputy mayor for housing took some heat saying real estate investors were having \u201c\na bit of a temper tantrum\n\u201d about the transfer tax, as\nTRD\npreviously reported.\n",

The campus at 1716 East 7th Street includes 364,000 square feet of studio space, offices, production support facilities and parking.\nIf all goes as planned, the project will break ground in 2027 and be completed two years later.\nOnce done, it could help to create a critical mass of residential, office and retail uses at the intersection of Alameda and 7th streets. Prologis\u2019 project is less than a half-mile walk to the\nRow DTLA retail and office complex\nor the recently opened Ava Arts District apartments, both located on Alameda Street.\nPoll finds support for building restrictions in fire-torn areas\nResults from a poll conducted by the Berkley Institute of Governmental Studies, co-sponsored by the Los Angeles Times, showed L.A. County residents were open to\nrestricting home building in fire-prone areas\n\u2014 to the tune of 70 percent of the nearly 5,200 registered voters surveyed between Feb. 17 and Feb. 26.\nMeanwhile, those same poll participants were a little more than halfway split down the middle on building higher-density projects, with 55 percent in support of said developments in urban areas.\nThe poll results call into question whether other cities in the county would be open to offsetting any housing shortage created should there be restrictions on building in fire-ravaged areas. In such a case, more time would no doubt be tacked onto efforts to quickly rehouse those who wish to return to homes damaged or destroyed by the fires.\nBuilder\u2019s remedy claims another win, this time in foothills\nSticking with the subject of building, this week brought more news for housing proponents by way of builder\u2019s remedy.\nA legal battle between a proposed mixed-use development and the\ncity of La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge\nis over. City officials gave up fighting the project, which would have consisted of apartments, hotel rooms and over 7,300 square feet of office space at 600 Foothill Boulevard.\n\nDeveloper Cedar Street used the builder\u2019s remedy loophole in state housing law to bypass city zoning requirements in exchange for including low-income homes. The city pushed back. However, a judge\u2019s order to either pay a $14 million bond or back off resulted in the latter by the city.\nLa Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge is the latest example in a rising tension playing out publicly between state and local governments.\nResi\u2019s whopping land listing\nIntrigue abounds around who might buy a\n$175 million, multi-parcel land listing\n.\nThe 33 acres, spread across 15 parcels in Benedict Canyon comes with a controversial past. Developer Gary Safady once aimed to build on site a Bulgari-branded hotel with 59 rooms, plus eight single-family residences ranging in size from 12,000 to 48,000 square feet.\nThe proposed project was axed in 2023 after then-planning director Vincent Bertoni caved to pressure from project critics and wrote a letter to Safady that called out project impacts well beyond what the city originally expected.\nSafady pulled a $30 million loan on the property from Motcomb Estates, the real estate investment arm for the Reuben Brothers. Records show Safady defaulted on the loan in November with Motcomb alleging a nearly $50 million unpaid balance at the time, pushing the parcels to the sales block.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether another developer might have a go at the property and buy it for purposes of another project. Any proposal is likely to face much of the same scrutiny Safady had in moving the Bulgari Resort Los Angeles forward.\nKeeping up with the OC\nCompared to a $175 million listing, the $16.3 million trade of a Laguna Niguel mansion may seem small. However, the closing marked an all-time record for the city.\nThe sale of the Spanish-style mansion in the gated community of Bear Brand Ranch also set a price-per-square-foot record in Laguna Niguel. The home at\n7 Searidge\npenciled out to $1,993 per square foot. That\u2019s well beyond the $625-per-square-foot held by the city\u2019s former residential record: a two-lot deal that closed in 2014 for $15 million.\nAs Orange County sees more unique developments come online, such as Almquist\u2019s River Street Marketplace in San Juan Capistrano, it\u2019s helping lend an air of cool and renewed desirability in the residential communities south of Los Angeles County.\n",

        "content": "State Farm General got its wish to hike home insurance rates by an average of 22 percent.\nThe news comes weeks after being\nstraight-armed\nby California\u2019s chief insurance regulator for a request to increase rates because of the Los Angeles wildfires.\nCalifornia Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara \u201cprovisionally\u201d granted the unit of Illinois-based State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance the emergency rate increase requested after billions in wildfire claims,\nthe Los Angeles Times reported\n.\nBut the increase \u2014 which includes a 38 percent rate increase for rental buildings and 15 percent for renters and condo owners \u2014 won\u2019t take effect until a hearing slated for April 8.\nLara approved the increase on March 14 after\nturning down the request last month\n, saying the insurer had failed to prove it was warranted.\nHe\u2019d given the insurer an opportunity, however, to provide more evidence to justify the request.\nIn making his decision, Lara called on State Farm to halt any pending nonrenewals of customers statewide and for the insurer\u2019s parent company to provide its California insurer an infusion of $500 million to stabilize its capital position, according to the Times.\n\u201cThe role of insurance commissioner involves balancing a stable and sustainable insurance market that serves consumers with effective oversight,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cTo ensure long-term choices for Californians, I had to make an unprecedented decision in the short term.\u201d\n\u201cThe facts will be revealed in an open, transparent hearing,\u201d he added.\n\nState Farm has faced years of losses and huge damage claims after the\nJan. 7 fires\nthat raged Pacific Palisades to Altadena, and leveled more than 12,000 homes.\nAs of March 11, State Farm General and its parent have received more than 12,000 fire and auto claims related to the wildfires, and paid\nmore than $2.2 billion to customers\n.\nState Farm General has estimated it will pay out $7.9 billion in the wake of the Palisades, Eaton and other L.A. County fires.\nBut, its net losses from the fires will be closer to $600 million after reinsurance payments, which largely will come from its parent company. Reinsurance is bought by insurers from other insurers to protect themselves from catastrophic events.\nLast March, the company announced it would\nnot renew 72,000 home, apartment and other property policies\nin California, citing wildfire risks and other concerns.\nThat followed a\ndecision in May 2023\nto stop writing insurance for new businesses, homeowners, and other personal property and casualties in the state, with the exception of personal auto policies.\nIn June, State Farm\nrequested a 30 percent rate increase for its homeowners policies\n, as well as other rate hikes, which await a decision. The request took state officials by surprise, with Lara saying it raised \u201cserious questions about its financial condition.\u201d\nState Farm General last month said it\u2019s lost $2.8 billion over the last nine years, including gains from investment income. State Farm Group, led by State Farm General\u2019s parent company, was given a superior financial rating in December by a rating agency.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Forever 21 is preparing to potentially close hundreds of stores, including more than a dozen in Southern California, as part of its ongoing bankruptcy.\nThe Los Angeles-based apparel firm, hurt by plunging sales and competition from overseas e-commerce merchants, will make cuts across Los Angeles and Orange counties,\nthe Orange County Register reported.\nThe pending closures come after the 41-year-old company l\nocked the doors of its Downtown L.A. headquarters\nlast month at the California Market Center at 110 East 9th Street, in the Fashion District.\nAfter decades of family ownership, the retail chain was sold in 2020 to investors who now seek a new owner.\nThe company is preparing to close down its remaining 350 stories as part of its bankruptcy filing,\naccording to Bloomberg\n, citing anonymous sources.\nEfforts to find a buyer for the fast-fashion retailer to avoid a liquidation have so far failed, they said. Talks with one potential bidder are ongoing\nForever 21 reported to the state it would be closing eight stores across Southern California \u2014 but the closures appear to be more widespread, with hundreds of employees to hit the bricks, according to the Register.\nThe official closures include stores at the The Outlets at Orange, Main Place Mall in Santa Ana, Galleria at Tyler Mall in Riverside, Ontario Mills in Ontario, Victoria Gardens in Rancho Cucamonga, Montclair Place in Montclair, Lakewood Center Mall and at Los Cerritos Mall\nThe company said the layoffs and store closures are permanent, beginning April 25 and continuing through May 9, letters submitted to California\u2019s Employment Development Department.\n\nReaders of the Register also reported stores at Westfield Fashion Square in Sherman Oaks, The Shops at Santa Anita in Arcadia, South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, Promenade Temecula and Inland Center in San Bernardino had closing signs on their storefront windows.\nThe company,\nwith 58 stores in California\n, announced in February that it would shutter at least 200 stores nationwide.\nThe retailer was founded in 1984 by husband and wife Do Won and Jin Sook Chang as Fashion 21, in Los Angeles, with its first store on Figueroa Street.\nRenamed Forever 21, the chain grew into a nationwide brand known for its trendy and cheap clothing for teens and 20-somethings. At its peak in 2015, the company reported $4.4 billion in sales and 1,300 stores worldwide.\nBut over the years, the company faced numerous controversies, including accusations of wage theft, the use of cadmium in its jewelry, controversial slogans on T-shirts and the cheap labor used abroad to sew its clothing.\nIn 2020, its assets were sold in bankruptcy for $81 million to a group of investors that included Authentic Brands Group, Simon Properties and Brookfield Properties. That group, known as SPARC, owned retail brands including Lucky, Eddie Bauer, Aeropostale, Brooks Brothers and Nautica.\nIn January, SPARC said\nit was merging with JCPenney\n, creating a new group called Catalyst Brands, which left off Forever 21 from its list of brands. Instead, the company said it was seeking a new operator for the retailer.\nToday, fast fashion in the U.S. has been overrun with competition from Chinese e-commerce companies such as Temu and Shein, which produce and sell items for pennies, according to the Register.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "The first to retreat was Beverly Hills, which laid down its arms in the battle against the state builder\u2019s remedy.\u00a0 And now La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, which threw in the towel after a two-year fight.\nThe La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge City Council voted to withdraw from its campaign to block a five-story apartment-hotel-office project proposed by Cedar Street Partners under the anti-NIMBY law at 600 Foothill Boulevard, the\nLos Angeles Daily News\nand\nBisnow\nreported.\nThe reason: the foothill city chose to quit an uphill legal battle after a Los Angeles judge ordered it pay a $14 million bond to appeal\na court decision to greenlight the project\n.\n\u201cContinuing the lawsuits is no longer in the best interest of the city,\u201d Mayor Mike Davitt said in a\nstatement\nsaying that the financial costs of its appeal outweighed its potential outcome.\nThe decision by La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge to back down may mark a Waterloo for opponents of the builder\u2019s remedy, a once-obscure provision in state housing law that has empowered developers while frustrating cities and counties across the state.\nThe builder\u2019s remedy allows housing developers to skirt local zoning\nin cities such as Beverly Hills\nthat failed to certify their state-mandated housing plans, provided their projects include 20 percent affordable housing.\nBeverly Hills, which had vigorously fought a slew of state-sanctioned builders remedy projects,\nbroached a compromise\nwith developers last month.\nNow La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge must come to terms with Cedar Street, led by Jonathan Curtis, a former city councilman and mayor who bought the property during his term in office.\nThe locally based developer had employed the 35-year-old legal loophole to allow the 80-unit complex with 16 hotel rooms and 7,300 square feet of offices, with 16 apartments set aside for low-income households.\n\nThe project, designed by Mid-City-based Riley Projects, would replace a former First Church of Christ Scientist, blocks from a large commercial district.\nCedar Street Partners had filed a\nlawsuit in July 2023\n, after a yearlong back-and-forth with the city and repeated denials. Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta\nasked a court\nto support the project, as well as the state builder\u2019s remedy provision.\nThe decision by the city to back down sends a disquieting message to cities trying to push back against housing laws, Ryan Leaderman, a partner at Holland &amp; Knight, who previously represented the 600 Foothill project, told Bisnow.\n\u201cThe message is: stop playing games with housing,\u201d Leaderman said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a price to pay when a city unlawfully denies a project.\u201d\nDespite the city\u2019s decision to abandon its appeal, the Foothill Boulevard project must still clear several hurdles before winning local approval. While the builder\u2019s remedy waives zoning rules, such projects still must comply with environmental, infrastructure and health and safety standards, according to the Daily News.\n\u201cThe City and community will need to chart a pathway forward that integrates the 600 Foothill project as reasonably as possible, and we hope going forward the developer will work with us to minimize any detrimental impacts on the City,\u201d Mayor Davitt said in his statement.\n\u201cThe ball\u2019s in their court,\u201d Cedar Street partner Jonathan Curtis told Bisnow.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

County. The survey\u2019s estimated margin of error is 2 percentage points, and larger for demographic subgroups.\nA 2019 Berkeley IGS poll\nsaw support from three-quarters of California voters\n, including 79 percent in L.A.

        "content": "Office properties hit hard by the pandemic often end up in the hands of their lenders or bargain-hunting buyers before they get a chance at a revival.\nYet for a West Loop office portfolio that plunged from 90 to 50 percent occupied, co-owner R2 has managed to remain in the drivers\u2019 seat and go debt-free through a new partnership. Public records show its joint venture with Beltway Capital Management \u2014 finalized last month with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure that took its former co-owner Heitman out of the picture \u2014 also adds a fifth building to the 350,000-square-foot portfolio.\nR2 bought six West Loop loft office buildings in 2016 for $86 million in a joint venture with Chicago-based Walton Street Capital. R2 later recapitalized a four-building portion of the portfolio in a joint venture with Chicago-based Heitman in 2019. The Heitman venture paid $65 million for the portfolio with a $42 million loan from Truist Financial. It\u2019s unclear how much R2 paid to maintain its stake in the properties.\nThe joint venture struggled to hold onto the four assets, located at 641 West Lake Street, 901 West Jackson Boulevard and 130 South Jefferson Street, after the pandemic hit.\nMaryland-based Beltway, which specializes in buying distressed debt, bought the loan note from Truist last May, when the properties and their owners faced a murky path forward. The loan was labeled nonperforming at the time of its sale, meaning it likely traded for less than its face value.\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for distressed debt buyers to file foreclosure actions shortly after acquiring a struggling loan.\nWhen Truist put the $42 million debt on the market, R2 and Heitman hadn\u2019t technically defaulted on the loan, but it was in cash management, people familiar with the offering said. That means its excess cash flow was being used to cover debt service costs.\nIn this case, Beltway tapped R2 as its partner in managing the assets. R2 CEO Matt Garrison declined to share how much the firm invested into the portfolio to maintain its stake or what terms dictated Heitman\u2019s departure from the joint venture.\nRepresentatives of Heitman did not respond to requests for comment.\nGarrison said R2 will be investing in \u201caggressive retention efforts for existing tenants,\u201d and upgrades to common areas.\n\nIt was worth it for R2 to hang onto the assets because loft offices are often the type of buildings targeted for residential conversions, he said, meaning the number of competing properties could dwindle. Others aren\u2019t in a position to fund the costs of competing for tenants.\n\u201cMany of the (loft office) owners are undercapitalized or lack a rationale to invest capital in new leases, because their properties are worth less than the debt,\u201d Garrison said. \u201cThis makes the effective inventory even smaller. We think there will always be demand for well executed loft buildings in the West Loop, and supply and demand looks better today for the right buildings than it has in a long time.\u201d\nA few months before it bought the distressed note from Truist, Beltway also pounced on another struggling loan issued by Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada to the Feil Organization for a loft office building at 730 North Franklin Street. Beltway also partnered with R2 to take over that asset.\nNow the firms co-own all five properties outright. Debt-free buildings\nhave emerged as an appealing strategy\nfor office investors seeking flexibility in making significant building upgrades and attracting tenants with competitive lease terms.\n\u201cDebt is just financial engineering. It isn\u2019t required from this entry basis to generate great returns,\u201d Garrison said. \u201cOne of the first questions tenant reps ask is about debt. Is the building in trouble, etc. Owning a property in all cash is the best answer to this question.\u201d\nWhether the new approach will kickstart a turnaround for the full portfolio remains to be seen.\nThe office at 901 West Jackson is 90 percent occupied but the offices at 641 West\u00a0 Lake and 130 South Jefferson are 50 percent occupied. Garrison said the firm is negotiating several leases across the properties.\n\u201cIn the office business, it is hard to stay flat,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are either growing or you are declining. The Chicago office market is really two markets today, with almost half of the buildings effectively offline.\u201d\n",

The firm added 6,600 square feet in 2023.\n\nThe city\u2019s average office lease size has increased for the first time since the pandemic, a promising sign of resilience, O\u2019Leary said.\nIt\u2019s likely too soon to tell if the broader office market in Chicago is headed for a noticeable turnaround. The downtown office vacancy rate hit 26.3 percent in the fourth quarter, up from 23.8 percent at the end of 2023 and more than double the 13.8 percent rate recorded at the start of the pandemic, according to CBRE.\nHenry Crown and Co. bought the 27-story building at 222 North LaSalle for $112 million in 2006 with a $100 million loan from the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America.\nThe investment firm dates back to 1959 and is tied to one of Chicago\u2019s wealthiest families. One of its scions, the businessman and philanthropist Jim Crown, died in 2023, and his Gold Coast condo at\n65 Goethe Street\n, was listed the following year for $17.5 million.\n",

It\u2019s a sharp drop from the $60 million Gaw Capital paid for it in 2016.\nThe buyers have added the Ambassador to a cluster of independently managed hotels operated by the Chicago Hotel Collection, which also manages three other properties downtown and in Wrigleyville.\nSeller Gaw Capital invested $11 million in renovations and rebranded the hotel under the Hyatt Joie de Vivre collection in 2020.\n\nThe pandemic forced the hotel to shut down for nearly a year, and it struggled to recover amid a slow rebound for the city\u2019s hospitality sector.\nDowntown Chicago hotels remain below pre-pandemic levels, when adjusted for inflation, despite some signs of a recovery. Revenue per available room was 11 percent higher last year than in 2019, but inflation-adjusted figures show the sector still lagging, according to CoStar.\nThe buyers must stabilize the hotel\u2019s operations fast if they want to turn a profit.

        "content": "Hamilton Partners is maneuvering to save a struggling suburban Chicago office deal without getting much help from its distressed ownership companion, Accesso Partners, which faces foreclosures at a handful of properties in the area.\nItasca-based Hamilton is a minority owner of the Esplanade I, a 609,000-square-foot office complex at 2001 Butterfield Road in Downers Grove, a property that had its $69 million loan transferred last month to special servicer CW Capital, a sign of financial trouble for the landlord.\nAccesso, based in the Miami suburb of Hallandale Beach, has the larger ownership stake in the 19-story property of the two firms, but it\u2019s either unable or unwilling to commit the capital necessary to work out the debt trouble alongside Hamilton, said Hamilton partner Ron Lunt.\nAs a result, Hamilton is seeking to delay the maturity of the property\u2019s loan, which comes due in July of next year, and is starting debt workout talks with CW Capital around how to fund the costs of turning the property around, such as tenant allowances for workspace buildouts and leasing broker commissions, Lunt said.\n\u201cWe have some lease talks going, but if we\u2019re going to spend a ton of money, we would like to work out an extension of some sort,\u201d Lunt said. \u201cOffices are low priority for lenders today, which is why you need to start the discussion early.\u201d\nCW Capital declared the loan is headed toward \u201cimminent monetary default,\u201d although Lunt said the loan terms were only breached on a technicality because its previous loan servicer, Iowa-based Principal, was allowing rents to be collected and debt costs to be paid later in the month than the special servicer.\nCW is reviewing Hamilton\u2019s request for a modification to the deal terms, and it\u2019s unclear when it will come to a resolution. Accesso, meanwhile, will have its equity in the property diluted further with each dollar Hamilton kicks into the deal as it attempts to rescue the loan from the brink of distress, Lunt said.\nAccesso didn\u2019t return requests for comment. It surrendered its office tower at 20 North Clark Street in the Chicago Loop to its lender earlier this year, and it is also facing a\n$75 million foreclosure at 200 West Monroe Street\n, which is next door to a property the firm previously sold at a major loss from its previous purchase price. Accesso made other\nsuburban office investments that recently ended up in foreclosure\n, too. The firm bought several of those properties from Hamilton, and entered the Esplanade deal in a 2015 joint venture.\nAccesso also lost a\nHouston office portfolio\nto financial distress last year.\n\nThe suburban Chicago property was appraised at $105 million ($172 per square foot) in 2016, when the joint venture\u2019s commercial mortgage-backed securities loan was originated. That\u2019s far more than what it\u2019s likely worth today as interest rates and subdued demand from tenants have eaten into property values. The loan\u2019s $57.3 million balance pencils out to $94 per square foot.\nThe property\u2019s financial trouble was triggered in part by the 2023 exit of Hillshire Brands, an affiliate of Tyson Foods, that previously leased a 72,000-square-foot annex building that serves as a research and development facility on the Downers Grove campus.\nThat space hasn\u2019t been refilled, and the asset is only 72 percent leased, about average for suburban Chicago office buildings amid one of the worst downturns of all time for the sector. The lackluster occupancy has sunk the property\u2019s revenue to well below the level required to meet debt service obligations, public loan data shows.\nThe property\u2019s debt-service coverage ratio was just 0.43 for 2024 through the end of September, loan data compiled by Morningstar Credit shows \u2014 anything less than 1.0 is below breakeven, meaning the Esplanade property was bringing in less than half the rent needed to cover its costs.\nStill, Hamilton is working with a brokerage team focused on food processing companies to help lease the space Hillshire vacated, with the hope it can get the deal back on track in time to dodge penalties with its lender.\nYet it\u2019ll be vying for tenants with other office properties in the suburbs that have already been through foreclosure or deeply discounted sales in\nnearby suburban markets\n, allowing their buyers to offer lower rents in some cases, Lunt noted.\n\u201cMajor projects in\nSchaumburg\nhave gone through ownership changes and the bases are all reset, and it makes it tougher competition,\u201d Lunt said.\n",

        "content": "Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi has fixed hundreds of property misclassifications after a months-long audit, but questions remain over how many errors are still unresolved.\nAt least 620 properties were\nmisclassified or undervalued\nduring the 2023 tax year, resulting in an estimated $444 million in missed taxable value.\nThe assessor\u2019s office has since corrected 491 of those errors, adding nearly $489 million in taxable value to county rolls \u2014 about 17 percent of the new construction value added countywide in 2023, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. An investigation by Illinois Answers and the outlet reported the misclassified properties last year.\nStill, 129 properties identified in the investigation remain incorrectly classified, with fixes delayed due to a backlog at the Cook County Board of Review and what Kaegi\u2019s office described as \u201cquirks in the tax calendar.\u201d\nThe office also blamed inconsistent permit data from local municipalities as a key factor behind delayed corrections.\nThe misclassifications carried major financial consequences.\nSome homeowners, like those in suburban Lynwood, have already received back tax bills as high as $23,000 after belated reassessments. State law allows for up to three years of back taxes, though Kaegi\u2019s office maintains that it won\u2019t issue back taxes in cases where it failed to act on construction permits it had on file.\nIn 46 out of 55 back-taxed cases, Kaegi\u2019s office did have relevant permit information, but missed it.\n\nMany affected properties were either new construction or had undergone significant renovations, but the assessor\u2019s records failed to reflect those changes. In some cases, properties were still being taxed based on outdated classifications.\nFor instance, a home in Gilmore Park built in 2021 and sold for $843,000 continued to be assessed as a vacant lot, with its value listed at less than $45,000.\nKaegi\u2019s office has since hired a dozen more staffers, including two permit specialists and 10 field inspectors, and promoted a veteran staffer to oversee data integrity. The office also plans to launch a sales validation team this year to help catch discrepancies, such as multimillion-dollar sales on properties incorrectly recorded as vacant.\nKaegi is pushing for broader systemic changes.\nLast week, he\ncalled on the Federal Housing Finance Agency\nto release appraisal data from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to local assessors. Kaegi argued that access to this data \u2014\ncurrently restricted\n\u2014 would help improve the accuracy of property assessments, particularly in addressing long-standing issues like regressivity, where lower-value homes are often over-assessed relative to their market value. His office released a public dataset on Monday morning with building permits submitted to the office by municipalities, another bid to bring transparency to the process.\nCritics argue the long delays and lingering errors undermine confidence in Cook County\u2019s property tax system \u2014 especially when homeowners can be hit with massive, unexpected tax bills for mistakes they had no hand in.\nKaegi\u2019s office is reviewing the 46 back tax bills for errors, as delays in delivering the permits to the assessor\u2019s office can slow its ability to make corrections, a spokesperson said.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Chicago landlords are set up to strongarm rent hikes this year and beyond.\nLeases struck within a group of 84 downtown buildings tracked by brokerage Luxury Living\nsurpassed an average of $3,000 per month\nlast year for the first time ever. With new supply limited by developers grappling with higher interest rates and construction costs, landlords are projected to have the upper hand until 2027, the earliest that a significant wave of rental deliveries is expected.\nChicago\u2019s top city lawyers are taking aim at the\nmost negligent property owners\n, and\nThe Real Deal\nis taking a look inside their plights.\nSuzie Wilson, dubbed the city\u2019s \u201cworst landowner\u201d by public officials, is nearing a $11.5 million settlement that could also include\na ban from investing in Chicago property\n.\nThe settlement would resolve the nearly $50 million in debts and legal claims she\u2019s estimated to owe the city, and she\u2019s not alone. The city is ramping its pursuit of two more firms,\nGoldmine Investments and QCD Financial\n, that similarly assembled large portfolios of properties on the South and West sides through delinquent tax sales and racked up a combined $9 million in unpaid fines and interest owed to the city through allegedly neglecting their real estate.\n\nIn the office market, the recently stubborn CMBS spigot loosed up to\nrain down $610 million on the owners of the newly built Salesforce Tower\n, which includes Hines and Chicago-based Chris Kennedy\u2019s famous political family. The deal replaces $549 million in construction debt.\nOn the other side of the financial spectrum,\nBeacon Capital Partners\u2019 190 North LaSalle Street\nwas listed for sale with Cushman &amp; Wakefield, and, like several of its fellow office buildings in the central Loop, has potential to fall short of its debt with its ultimate sale price.\nThe\nFarpoint-led team redeveloping the former Michael Reese Hospital site\nin Bronzeville released its vision for the Chicago Bears\u2019 new stadium to be built on the land. While the NFL team hasn\u2019t expressed any interest in the site as of yet, the developer is hoping to sway the team away from its previously announced plans to either build a new stadium just south of Soldier Field or outside of the city in Arlington Heights.\nOut in the suburbs, developer\nAdvent Properties scrapped a 278-unit Des Plaines\napartments project, investor\nZell Kravinsky paid $19.3 million\nto FPA Multifamily for a 63-unit Algonquin apartment complex and FPA Multifamily turned around and bought a\nbig Naperville apartment complex for $68 million\n.\n",

        "content": "Hines, Chris Kennedy of a famous American political family and their investment partners in a 60-story skyscraper in Chicago have defied the pandemic-induced downturn for commercial office space.\nThe owners of\nSalesforce Tower\non the bank of the Chicago River are nearing the finalization of a $610 million long-term debt deal, marking a milestone in the aftermath of the pandemic-stricken economy, CoStar News\nreported\n. Should the deal close later this month as expected, the property \u2014 developed by Hines and the Kennedy family as well as the AFL-CIO\u2019s real estate investment arm \u2014 will stand as a contrarian bet that worked out amid economic uncertainty.\nThe commercial mortgage-backed securities loan reflects the tower\u2019s long-term valuation of $888 million, as appraised by Cushman &amp; Wakefield. Its current valuation of $745 million is expected to rise further following the repayment of tenant-improvement costs and free rent allowances.\nThe refinancing package, with Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs serving as the lenders, will replace the property\u2019s $549 million construction debt and is projected to carry an interest rate of 6.525 percent until its maturity in March 2030.\nConceived during the early days of the pandemic, Salesforce Tower has upended market trends by maintaining high occupancy levels, with leases covering over 95 percent of its 1.2 million square feet. Key tenants include Salesforce, which rents more than 477,000 square feet, and Kirkland &amp; Ellis, which is on a 677,000-square-foot lease; those deals run into the 2040s.\n\nMeanwhile, much of the rest of the Chicago office market is depressed, with record-high vacancy rates of more than 25 percent and\nmassive foreclosure lawsuits\nagainst office landlords winding through Cook County court.\nFor the Salesforce Tower developers and Chicago\u2019s broader office market, scoring the loan is a testament to the investment thesis that the world\u2019s largest companies remain interested in ultra-premium workspace and aren\u2019t afraid to invest heavily in it as a method to attract and retain top talent. Kirkland has poured over $207 million beyond its tenant-improvement allowance to create its ideal workspaces, while Salesforce has put up an additional $78 million for its interior buildout, the Moody\u2019s report cited by the outlet shows.\nMoody\u2019s put out a robust outlook on the deal, buoyed by a net operating income projected to reach about $51.2 million by the second year of the loan.\nEastdil Secured arranged the financing package for Salesforce Tower.\n",

        "content": "The developer with ambitious plans for the Bronzeville Lakefront put pictures with its pitch for a Chicago Bears stadium, although the team\u2019s plans are far from certain.\nFarpoint Development released renderings for a $3.2 billion domed stadium on the 49-acre site of the former Michael Reese hospital on the South Side, aiming to present an alternative to the team\u2019s two other options, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The team is also considering a redevelopment of the Arlington Heights racetrack and a domed stadium near Soldier Field.\nThe Bronzeville pitch includes an entertainment district, hotels and a 20-acre park bridging over Lake Shore Drive, connecting the stadium to the lakefront, proximity to which has been one of the National Football League team\u2019s main requirements.\nThe developer argues the site offers the best of both worlds: an urban core location and room for ancillary developments \u2014 retail, dining and multifamily projects \u2014 that could generate additional revenue for the team.\nThe stadium would be privately financed by the Bears, but the developer is pitching $600 million in state infrastructure funds to prepare the site for development, including utilities, roads and environmental work.\nThat departs from\nthe Bears\u2019 other lakefront proposal\n, which sought a $900 million upfront public subsidy. By financing the stadium privately, developers see the plan as more palatable to political leaders wary of direct public subsidies.\n\nStill, hurdles remain. The Bears haven\u2019t publicly engaged with the proposal as of late, but\nrescinded a rejection in the fall\nafter Farpoint updated its plans to take out a conflict with Metra tracks it previously planned to build over.\nInsiders suggest the team is still focused on either advancing its lakefront vision or moving forward in Arlington Heights. The narrow footprint of the Michael Reese site has also raised concerns about feasibility.\nAnother complication is the adjacent Prairie Shores apartment complex, partially owned by Farpoint. The developer says the stadium could fit without impacting the complex, but demolishing units has been floated as a way to maximize the site \u2014 an option that would likely draw political pushback.\nThe city still owns the majority of the site and would need to contribute land, as well as cover about $40 million in debt tied to its acquisition. Public financing could also come from tax increment financing and leveraging the site\u2019s federal opportunity zone status.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

The lawsuit, which is seeking class-action status, was filed Thursday in federal court in Massachusetts.\nThe South Suburban Housing Center and Open Communities in Evanston received the same letter and faces similar funding losses posed to disrupt decades of work supporting low-income and minority communities.\nThe nonprofit lost its two grants, which totaled about $1.4 million over the next three years, funds it has received since 1995. The amount represented 92 percent of its fair housing budget and 37 percent of its total organizational budget.\n\nChicago\u2019s Continuum of Care network \u2014 responsible for coordinating housing services for the homeless \u2014 has over $112 million in HUD grants still pending contracts. At least 14 organizations have been operating without reimbursement since January.\nThe cuts come amid broader federal workforce reductions at HUD, including layoffs at the agency\u2019s Chicago office.\nHUD Secretary Scott Turner, who was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on Feb. 5, has defended the changes, saying the agency is \u201ctaking inventory\u201d to improve efficiency. HUD officials have promised some clarity in the coming weeks, with letters to awardees expected soon.\nThe cuts are targeting racial justice initiatives and could erode protections for vulnerable groups, particularly as\nhousing discrimination\ncomplaints rise and\naffordable housing options shrink\n, the National Fair Housing Alliance said.\nFor other organizations, like Ignite, which provides services for homeless youth as the parent organization for Continuum of Care, the clock is ticking.\nIgnite has dipped into reserves to continue operations while awaiting its yearly $320,000 contract reimbursement. Others are turning to donors or state-level funding to close the gaps.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "A venture involving Zell Kravinsky\u2019s Morning Sky Capital scooped up a 63-unit apartment complex on the bank of the Fox River in the northwest suburbs of Chicago from multifamily giant Greg Fowler\u2019s firm, which previously bought it out of distress.\nKravinsky\u2019s company partnered with several other investors to pay $19.3 million for the ReNew on Main property at 1 North Main Street in Algonquin, public records show. The price of $302,000 per unit included assuming an existing mortgage with a balance of more than $11 million that the San Francisco-based seller, FPA Multifamily, previously took out on the property, sparing the buyer from shopping for debt at today\u2019s elevated interest rates.\nFor FPA, one of Chicagoland\u2019s largest multifamily landlords, the deal extends a streak of activity in the area that has tended to follow the same pattern: the firm is\nselling off its smaller assets\nand buying up bigger ones with funds the transactions generate. The Algonquin deal closed right as\nFPA bought a 356-unit Naperville apartment complex\nfor $68 million, in another deal where it assumed the existing debt of the seller, Chicago-based Rockwell Partners.\n\u201cThere is not a lot of liquidity in the market right now, which is good for people who have a conviction in the market and are ready to make a bet,\u201d said Morning Sky\u2019s Lev Kravinsky. \u201cIn general most of what we\u2019re buying nowadays is either all cash or loan assumption. It\u2019s difficult but not impossible to find deals that pencil with fresh debt.\u201d\nFPA didn\u2019t return a request for comment on the Algonquin transaction.\nWhile the deal is relatively small for FPA, the seller posted a gain on the property after buying it out of distress in 2018 for $12.7 million ($201,600 per unit). The complex, which also includes six ground-floor retail units, has a checkered ownership history after running into delays during its development, and financial trouble after its 2011 completion.\n\nFPA bought it from a financial institution, Boston-based UC Funds, which acquired the property through foreclosure. The property was conceived as a 54-unit luxury condo project, awarded to Aspen Homebuilders back in 2006 by the village of Algonquin. Aspen went bankrupt two years later, and the firm\u2019s owner, Bruce Hawkins, pleaded guilty in 2013 to defrauding a bank of more than $1 million, the Northwest Herald previously\nreported\n.\nThe building remained unfinished for years, until developer John Bruegelmans took over the project in 2011 and gained approval to convert the project into rentals. Residents started moving in during 2015, but Buregelmans filed for bankruptcy in 2016 to restructure construction debt, the newspaper reported.\nThat\u2019s what prompted a UC Funds entity to take over the building and eventually sell it to FPA.\nMeanwhile, buyers in Chicago and its suburban multifamily markets are\nset to raise rents\nin the coming year as new supply craters amid a development dropoff.\nMorning Sky owns several other apartment complexes in the area, with three in the suburbs and one in the city, Lev Kravinsky said. His father, Morning Sky principal Zell Kravinsky, is well-known as a philanthropist and longtime real estate investor.\n",

        "content": "Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi is pushing the federal government to release property appraisal data to the country\u2019s largest assessors to help improve the accuracy of property tax assessments, which have received criticism locally for being systemically flawed.\nA resolution sponsored by Kaegi calls for the Federal Housing Finance Agency to hand data containing \u201cmillions of property appraisals\u201d over to 16 of the nation\u2019s largest assessment offices, according to a news release.\nThe assessor made the request just a day before the Senate on Thursday confirmed President Trump\u2019s nominee\nBill Pulte as head of the FHFA\n, which collects appraisal records from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Pulte\u2019s stance on Kaegi\u2019s idea is unclear; Pulte is the grandson of the late William Pulte, who started one of the nation\u2019s largest homebuilders, Pulte Homes, in Detroit in the 1950s.\nThe Federal Housing Finance Agency compiles Fannie and Freddie appraisals into a Uniform Appraisal Dataset that contains parcel-level property characteristics. Most of this data is inaccessible to government assessors, but Kaegi and 15 other assessment offices across the country are hoping to change that.\nThe Kaegi-backed proposal\u2019s supporters said it would aid in addressing a common problem encountered by Cook County homeowners: Less expensive homes tend to be overvalued for taxes relative to their actual sale price, while pricier homes tend to be undervalued for taxes in an issue known as \u201cregressivity.\u201d\n\nThis means that working class and low income families end up paying more than their fair share in property taxes or can\u2019t pay at all, putting a strain on the local municipality that relies on property tax revenue to fund public services. This has been\nparticularly true for small towns in the South suburbs of Chicago\nthat have a higher concentration of working class homeowners hit with overvaluations.\n\u201cIn recent years, we\u2019ve eliminated a large portion of the regressivity in Cook County\u2019s residential assessments,\u201d Kaegi said in the release. \u201cWith the release of this data, we would be able to clear one of the final hurdles to achieving thoroughly fair and accurate assessments.\u201d\nA 2022 University of Chicago\nstudy cited the main causes of regressivity as \u201climitations in the data and methods used in assessment,\u201d specifically a lack of data about property characteristics that might factor into calculating a property\u2019s assessed value. A study by Josh Myers Valuation Solutions also attributed\nthe undervaluation of commercial properties\n, in part, to \u201clack of data-sharing.\u201d\nThe resolution got a boost from the National Association of Counties\u2019 Board of Directors, which endorsed the measure in a March 1 annual legislative conference, according to the release. Kaegi\u2019s co-sponsor on the bill is Eddie Cook, the assessor of Maricopa County, Arizona, which includes the city of Phoenix.\n",

The price wasn\u2019t disclosed.\nBeacon acquired the nearly 800,000-square-foot tower in late 2019 for $230 million ($288 per square foot) and is selling at a time when Loop office buildings are trading at significant discounts. A $167.5 million mortgage ($209 per square foot) from U.S. Bank also weighs it down \u2014 a balance that now likely exceeds the property\u2019s market value amid rising vacancies and declining demand.\nTwo of the building\u2019s largest tenants, Neuberger Berman and Bain &amp; Company, are expected to exit by 2027 and 2028, respectively.\nThe looming vacancies add to the building\u2019s uncertainty despite its anchor tenant U.S. Bank\u2019s signing through 2030. The weighted average lease term across tenants is just over four years, according to marketing materials.\n\nThe sale offer comes after Beacon\u2019s\nloss on 303 East Wacker Drive\n, which sold in December for about $63 million, a steep drop from the $182 million Beacon paid in 2018. Another blow came with a foreclosure lawsuit at 330 North Wabash Avenue, where Beacon faces claims over a $372 million loan after its appraisal\ndropped 62 percent last month\nfrom issuance four years ago.\nBeacon recently invested $13.7 million in renovating 190 South LaSalle, upgrading the lobby, fitness center and conference spaces in hopes of attracting tenants.\nThe building, developed in 1987 and designed by Philip Johnson, is one of the few LaSalle Street properties to undergo significant recent updates. That list includes 135 South LaSalle Street, for which the city doled out $98 million in TIF subsidies to Riverside Investment &amp; Development, DL3 Realty and AmTrust RE to convert vacant office space into 386 residential units\nlast fall\n.\nSeveral nearby towers have fallen into foreclosure, like New York-based landlord Feil Organization\u2019s 10 South LaSalle Street.

The figure ranged from 61 percent to 77 percent between 2019 and 2022.\nSimilarly, the North Chicago Housing Authority reported a 50 percent lease-up rate last year, while the Lake County Housing Authority logged 62 percent. Some recipients are still searching for homes, meaning these rates could shift.\nThe struggle to find housing can be grueling for voucher holders, who may have to sleep in their cars or couch surf, shower at the gym and store personal items at work. Once they are approved for vouchers, the clock is ticking, and time can run out before they find housing.\n\nSome housing authorities are adopting strategies to address the problems. Housing authorities in Waukegan, North Chicago and Lake County last year agreed to allow voucher holders to lease units in any of their jurisdictions, aiming to expand options and increase lease-up rates.\nWaukegan and Lake County have also received HUD approval to offer monetary incentives to landlords.\nMeanwhile, landlords cite barriers like bureaucratic delays, inspections and a lack of standardization across housing authorities. Some housing providers have called for streamlining the process through faster unit approvals and more consistent administrative standards.\nNationally, about 60 percent of voucher holders are able to lease units, according to New York University\u2019s Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy.\nThe rates are lower in markets with older housing stock and among recipients of color \u2014 two conditions that especially apply in Chicago.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

They did not immediately reply to a request for comment via a representative.\nAI has been touted as the likely taker for a substantial portion of San Francisco\u2019s one-third-empty office space. There were\n86 AI leases signed last year\nin the city, according to Kilroy analysis, with AI expected to drive another 1 million to 1.5 million square feet in absorption this year. Tech office leasing was up 17 percent last year,\ndriven by AI\ndemand, according to CBRE.\nAI companies are \u201cabsolutely\u201d having an impact on the office market, Walker said, adding that with 5 million square feet of leased space, the city\u2019s 200 AI companies represent nearly 9% of the total occupied office space in the city.\n\u201cThese AI companies recognize the strategic value of being in San Francisco\u2014not just for access to talent and investors, but for building in-office cultures that will help shape the future of downtown,\u201d he said.\nIf more of these AI companies come to SoMa, it would be a much-needed boost to the neighborhood, which has been\nhit harder than other SF markets\nby tech\u2019s office retreat since the pandemic. At the end of 2024, SoMa was 40 percent vacant, compared to 36.5 percent citywide, according to CBRE data.\n",

        "content": "The dominoes of department stores and boutique shops falling around San Francisco\u2019s Union Square may include another luxury retail store: Saks Fifth Avenue.\nCanada-based Hudson Bay Company, which owns Saks, appears ready to cut the cord for its appointment-only store at 384 Post Street when its lease expires in 2027,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported\n.\nThe move comes after an affiliate of Hudson Bay, Saks Global Enterprises, picked up the Union Square flagship store from Neiman Marcus late last year at 150 Stockton Street during its acquisition of Neiman Marcus and its real estate properties for\n$2.7 billion\n.\nThe transfer of the six-story, 208,900-square-foot building at 150 Stockton assigned a new market value of $160 million, or $766 per square foot, according to public records and an unidentified source.\nThat left Saks, which for decades has leased a 136,000-square-foot building at 384 Post diagonally across the street from Neiman, vulnerable.\nSaks Fifth Avenue faces an expiring lease in January\u00a0 2027, Charlie McCabe, a locally based real estate investment broker, told the Chronicle. The department store\u2019s ongoing tenure in that building \u201cmay be tenuous,\u201d he said.\nSaks pays more than $6 million a year in rent to landlord Lincoln Property, based in Dallas. Last summer, Saks laid off workers as it converted the store to\n\u201cappointment only,\u201d\ncurtailing its retail clout in Union Square.\nKazuko Morgan, a veteran retail broker who specializes in leasing around Union Square, said that she was told Saks doesn\u2019t plan to renew its lease \u2014 and hasn\u2019t heard that Saks could move in with Neiman Marcus across the street.\n\n\u201cIf Saks does exit the market, it\u2019s not such a terrible thing today, since they have been appointment-only for months,\u201d Morgan told the newspaper. \u201cThey\u2019ve already diminished their presence.\u201d\nLincoln Property and Germany-based Cara Investment bought the building in 2021 for $156 million, or $115 per square foot. They now plan to redevelop it as \u201cmixed use,\u201d Morgan said.\nThe loss of Saks could be inscribed into a larger retail tombstone for greater Union Square, once the city\u2019s golden shopping district.\nNordstrom, which for decades anchored the mall at 865 Powell Street, packed up in 2023. Bloomgindale\u2019s, which occupied more than 300,000 square-feet at the nearly empty San Francisco Centre mall,\nwill close this month\n.\nMacy\u2019s, which for decades has occupied its three-building flagship store in Union Square plaza, plans to\nsell the property and close the doors\nof its only San Francisco store.\nOther retailers that have pulled up stakes include Saks Off Fifth, Nordstrom Rack, H&amp;M and Uniqlo, according to the Chronicle. Meanwhile, luxury retailers may be drifting over to historic Jackson Square.\nThis month, Ralph Lauren has returned to San Francisco with a\nnew store at 441 Jackson Street\n, following an\ninflux of luxury retailers\nlike Paul Smith, Isabel Marant and Zimmermann.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Architect-turned-builder Lara Dutto plans to build 15 homes next to a war memorial of thousands of white wooden crosses in Lafayette.\nDutto, principal of Orinda-based Laraarchitecture, bought the\nLafayette Hillside Memorial\nat 3600 Deer Hill Road two years ago to save the 3.1-acre parcel from development,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported\n.\nNow Dutto, a professor of architecture at Diablo Valley College, has pitched a plan to develop 15 homes on the northern two-thirds of the site.\nShe wants to split off the southern portion to preserve the memorial conceived in 2006 by contractor Jeff Heaton as a \u201cplace to recognize, honor, and commemorate individual national service contribution\u201d of those dying in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\nNonprofit Lafayette Hillside Memorial would continue to maintain the crosses.\n\u201cIts scale and rawness and simplicity somehow makes me stop, forces me to take a deep breath, and in that moment I am so grateful for my freedoms,\u201d she told the Chronicle.\nDutto, who has worked since 2010 to support the memorial and once sat on its board, grew concerned when the family that owned it put it up for sale, fearful that whoever bought it would remove the crosses. So she bought it in 2023 for an undisclosed price.\nPlans now call for preserving the memorial and half the property as open space, while building a subdivision of 15 single-family homes around a \u201cvillage green,\u201d with an outdoor cooking and dining area, according to the Chronicle.\nFive of the homes would have accessory dwelling units, or granny flats. The development would climb up the slope along Oak Hill Road, below a ridgeline of preserved open space.\n\nDutto has employed a state density bonus and Senate Bill 330 for streamlined approvals. On Monday, the Lafayette Planning Commission was slated to hold an informational hearing.\nThe application came as housing advocates\nsued the East Bay city\nfor creating \u201cmisleading and unrealistic housing sites\u201d to satisfy state-mandated housing goals.\nThe lawsuit by the Housing Action Coalition accused Lafayette of \u201cpretending\u201d to comply with the state housing element, a planning blueprint required of every city and county across the state every eight years.\nMayor Susan Candell took issue with the lawsuit, according to the Chronicle, saying the City Council has approved all housing projects that have come before it. She said the city will have no choice but to approve the Deer Hill Road project.\nLafayette, a wealthy city with $2 million homes, was once a battleground for the region\u2019s housing wars, with two lawsuits, a ballot referendum and more than 100 public hearings that delayed a 315-unit apartment building for almost a dozen years.\nWithin a 10-year span, 115 homes were built in the city of 25,000 residents, including 10 in 2010, 76 in 2018 and 29 in 2019. The city must rezone to build 2,114 homes, 943 of them affordable, by 2031.\nLast year, the\nstate Supreme Court declined\nto hear an appeal from a neighborhood group, allowing the development to move forward. The project has not broken ground.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

A previous 19-story hotel and fitness club project, approved in 2021, stalled.\n\u201cThis started out as a contrarian bet but as we dug in deeper and looked at the market, how it is evolving and maturing out of Covid, it doesn\u2019t seem so contrarian any more,\u201d Gino Canori, president of Related California, told the San Francisco Chronicle.\nRelated hopes to secure approvals to build the tower this fall, allowing the firm to break ground by late next year. If all goes well, it could be completed by 2030.\nMichelin-starred chef, Ralph Lauren come to Jackson Square\nRestaurateur Peter Hemsley of Michelin-starred Aphotic\njoined forces\nwith developer Brick &amp; Timber, which keeps its headquarters in the neighborhood, to buy a 15,600-square-foot store and building at 530 Jackson Street for $32.4 million, or over $2,000 a square foot.\n\nHemsley announced last year he would shut Aphotic, blaming the SoMa location. It\u2019s not clear whether the chef intends to revive the sustainable seafood restaurant or launch a new concept in the ground-floor space that was home to Kells Irish Restaurant and Pub for decades. Paul McAleese is the owner of Kells Irish Restaurant and Bar as well as the seller of 530 Jackson.\nJust down the street from 530 Jackson, Ralph Lauren opened its first new store in the city in years.\n\u201cThe opening of Polo Ralph Lauren in Jackson Square is a testament to the neighborhood\u2019s growing appeal as a premier destination for retail,\u201d Robbie Silver, CEO of the Downtown SF Partnership, said in a statement.\nSweetgreen, Blue Bottle sign long-term Mission Rock leases\nIn further retail news, Mission Rock developers Tishman Speyer and the San Francisco Giants announced\ntwo new long-term deals\nat their Mission Bay development. Blue Bottle Coffee and Sweetgreen have signed 10-year leases at Mission Rock and Arsicault bakery finally opened its doors in the development.\nOakland-founded Blue Bottle will occupy 2,069 square feet at the base of the building occupied by Visa at 300 Toni Stone Crossing. Salad-and-grain bowl shop Sweetgreen will take just under 2,400 square feet at the base of The Canyon, a residential tower at the intersection of Dr. Maya Angelou Lane and Toni Strone Crossing.\nAlex Sagues and Madeline Mandanis represented the landlords in the deal. Sagues called Mission Bay \u201cthe most vibrant neighborhood in San Francisco\u201d. He said retailers are drawn to the transit-friendly area because \u201cit is a true seven-day neighborhood,\u201d with office, life sciences, residential, and the UCSF hospital, as well as events at Chase Center and Oracle Park.\n",

        "content": "State insurance regulators have unveiled a new plan to stabilize the home insurance market by pushing insurers to expand coverage in fire-prone areas where companies have dropped hundreds of thousands of homeowners in recent years.\nThe plan updates a map of high-risk zip codes where insurers will be required to write more policies, aiming to create a more equitable insurance market despite growing wildfire threats, the\nSan Jose Mercury News reported\n.\nHowever, many high-risk Bay Area neighborhoods, including Oakland, the Berkeley Hills and Gilroy, aren\u2019t included in the updated map.\nState regulators say this is because those areas fall within zip codes where the overall insurance need is deemed lower. Despite this, new rules will still require insurers to offer coverage to homeowners in these areas who have been rejected by traditional providers due to fire risk.\n\u201cInsurance companies have ignored those homes, and we\u2019re trying to put the spotlight on them,\u201d Michael Soller, spokesperson for the California Department of Insurance, told the Mercury News.\nThe plan stems from a deal with the insurance industry, allowing companies to raise rates based on climate-related risks in exchange for expanding coverage in high-risk areas.\nCalifornians currently pay an average of $1,435 annually for homeowners insurance, below the national average. But prices vary widely. And insurers like State Farm and Allstate have stopped issuing new policies in the state, citing strict rate-setting rules and wildfire losses.\nThe new rules require insurers to cover a proportional share of high-risk policies. For example, if a company covers 100 of every 1,000 policies statewide, it must cover 85 of every 1,000 in high-risk areas.\n\nHowever, some consumer groups argue the reforms have loopholes that may allow insurers to delay meeting these targets or only slightly increase coverage.\nHomeowners in fire-prone areas, like Carolyn Grote of the Berkeley Hills, are preparing independently. Grote formed a \u201cFirewise community\u201d with neighbors to improve fire safety, hoping to retain her insurance.\n\u201cIf Firewise could help people retain their insurance, that might be the biggest motivator,\u201d she told the newspaper.\nConsumer groups are skeptical.\n\u201cInsurers can use secret models to raise rates right away with unenforceable promises to expand coverage,\u201d Carmen Balber of nonprofit Consumer Watchdog told the Mercury News.\nRegulators, however, insist they will monitor compliance closely and can revoke rate-setting privileges if insurers fail to meet coverage requirements.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "SAJ Development wants to swing a wrecking ball into three office buildings in Lafayette to erect a 90-unit apartment building in an upscale city long opposed to affordable housing.\nThe locally based developer filed revised plans to replace the offices with a seven-story, 171,400-square-foot complex at 1001 Oak Hill Road,\nthe San Francisco Business Times reported\n. The city will consider the project on March 17.\nThe application came as housing advocates\nsued the East Bay city\nfor creating \u201cmisleading and unrealistic housing sites\u201d to satisfy state-mandated housing goals. The lawsuit by the Housing Action Coalition accused Lafayette of \u201cpretending\u201d to comply with the state housing element, a planning blueprint required of every city and county across the state every eight years.\nLafayette\u2019s alleged shell game includes relying on faith-based institutions and longtime businesses with no plans to develop housing as potential building sites for homes, according to the complaint.\nThe lawsuit seeks a court to compel the city to adopt a revised plan with an update to its zoning laws. The city must rezone to build 2,114 homes, 943 of them affordable, by 2031. Within the decade through 2019, the city permitted 115 homes.\nSAJ could help remedy that by its mixed-use project calling for 79 market-rate apartments and 11 affordable apartments, including five for very-low-income households and six for moderate-income households.\nWhat appears to be a U-shaped complex, designed by Berkeley-based Trachtenberg Architects, would be draped in two shades of brown, with tiered roof decks, and floor-to-ceiling corner windows with exterior balconies, according to a rendering.\nThe developer would employ a nearly 23 percent state density bonus in exchange for the affordable housing, plus a state streamlining law for faster approvals. A cost and timeline for construction were not disclosed.\n\nSAJ applied using Senate Bill 330, which effectively freezes zoning that\u2019s in place at the time a project is submitted, limits the number of public hearings to five and suspends or eliminates restrictions on housing development.\nThe law aims to prevent cities from delaying projects unnecessarily over subjective standards, along with several other laws meant to stop cities from blocking affordable housing.\nThe developer had submitted an earlier version of the project in 2022 that called for tearing down just two of the three offices to build\n53 units\n. City officials approved that version in May, before SAJ revised its plans. Jeff Stone, owner of Diamond Construction, was listed as the property owner operating through SAJ Development, according to SFYimby.\nLafayette was once a battleground for the region\u2019s housing wars, with two lawsuits, a ballot referendum and more than 100 public hearings that delayed a 315-unit apartment building for almost a dozen years.\nLast year, the\nstate Supreme Court declined\nto hear an appeal from a neighborhood group, allowing the development to move forward. The project has not broken ground.\nMembership in SAJ Development, led by Stone, includes Diamond Swope Holdings, the Steven Kay Trust, the Griggs Community Property Trust and Outdo, based in Lafayette, according to state business records. Another firm, Valley Oak Capital, is based in Texas.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

In 1921, it tried to redevelop it into a mixed-use village, with homes and commercial properties, according to its website.\nA default notice filed this week gives the Zappettinis 90 days to pay off the default amount. If they fail, the lender will record a notice of sale, Steven Hoffman, a real estate attorney based in Sunnyvale who is not connected to the situation, told the Business Journal.\nThe Business Journal reported in February that the\nMountain View tech campus had been heading toward foreclosure\nor a loan modification after the owner defaulted on a $120 million mortgage debt.\nLoan servicer reports obtained in January showed Zappettini Investment Company failed to repay the mortgage debt by its June 2024 maturity date. The initial loan default was\nfirst reported by The Real Deal\nthat month.\nCiti Real Estate Funding issued the two loans \u2014 one for $65 million and a second for $55 million \u2014 and then pooled them into commercial mortgage-backed securities deals.\n\nAs of last summer, leases for 40 percent of the tech park\u2019s office, light-industrial and research and development buildings were set to expire within six months, a key factor in the default.\nThe Zappettini family was originally in the wholesale flower importing business and formerly used some of the Mountain View properties for its wholesale operations, according to its website.\nThe Zappettinis sold multiple parcels in Mountain View to Google in 2011, which the tech giant sold a few years later to the Irvine Company, according to public records. They sold another property to Google in 2016 for its now-abandoned\nGoogle Landings\nproject.\nThe family also owned almost 2 acres in the San Francisco Flower Mart from the 1950s until they sold it to Kilroy Realty in 2016 for $31 million in cash and $56 million in stock.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Fielder\u2019s motion to continue the vote passed unanimously, with a hearing set for March 18.\nThe Empty Homes Tax took effect at the beginning of last year, with collections planned for upcoming April.\n\nProponents estimated it would generate more than $20 million a year for housing and unlock about 5,000 units within two years, though critics have questioned the projections.\nThe tax has faced legal challenges since February 2023, when property owner groups filed a lawsuit alleging it was coercive and infringed on their rights.\nIn December 2023, Superior Court Judge Charles Haines\ndeclined to dismiss the lawsuit\narguing in a ruling that property owners don\u2019t need to wait until the tax is due to challenge it in court. In October, Haines\nstruck down the tax\n, saying that it violated the U.S. and California constitutions and was preempted by California law.\nThe court subsequently ordered the city to halt enforcement and collection, and the city treasurer stated that property owners would not be required to pay by the original April 30, 2025 deadline unless the court\u2019s decision is reversed on appeal.\nThe city attorney\u2019s office is now appealing the ruling and has expressed disappointment with the trial court\u2019s decision.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Aghamiri\u2019s Msasa Properties\nfiled plans in September 2023\nto build the seven-story complex near San Jose\u2019s Japantown.\nWith developers having built no market-rate projects larger than 20 units in the city last year, Aghamiri\u2019s project appears to be the first large-scale multifamily development since 2023, in which 336 units were built.\nPlans call for 118 apartments on a half-acre north of Basset Street between North First and North Second streets, with six set aside as affordable for very low-income households. Parking would be available for 74 cars.\nInitial plans by Aghamiri included 18 affordable units, or 15 percent, but he cut it to 5 percent to make the project pencil out, according to Erik Schoennauer, a local land use consultant who spoke on behalf of the developer.\n\nThe project, designed by Oakland-based Studio T-Square, features a charcoal and white complex with balconies, according to a rendering, bookended by a brown brick sections.\nThe site is located in an opportunity zone, which offers tax advantages to developers.\nAghamiri bought the office property in 2022 for $5.3 million, or $442 per square foot.\nThe 61-year-old offices have been vacant for 10 months, and have been damaged by vandals, Schoennauer said. They\u2019ve been 60 percent vacant for more than five years\nHe said Aghamiri hopes to break ground this summer, and complete the project in 20 to 24 months.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "A proposed legal settlement over the botched environmental cleanup of Hunters Point Shipyard would leave thousands of affected residents with just $606 per person.\nA federal judge denied the agreement between developers FivePoint Holdings and Lennar and lawyers behind the $1 billion lawsuit \u2014 calling it a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d for the builders and the \u201cworst settlement\u201d he\u2019s ever seen, the\nSan Francisco Chronicle reported.\nIn a scathing order, U.S. District Judge James Donato called the proposed payout to 6,500 residents of Hunters Point \u201cpaltry,\u201d and accused the plaintiff\u2019s lawyers of selling out their clients.\n\u201cNo question that the proposed terms are unfair to the class members,\u201d he said during a January hearing.\nResidents of Hunters Point filed a lawsuit in 2018 alleging they were the victims of fraud and had suffered health defects in connection with the former shipyard\u2019s ongoing toxic cleanup.\nIn the latest attempt by Irvine-based FivePoint and Miami-based Lennar to settle, the developers and Sausalito law firm Bonner &amp; Bonner had asked the court to approve a $5.4 million deal.\nBut with $1.4 million for attorney fees and $4 million in community payouts, it worked out to $606 per person. A settlement proposal in 2022 for 9,000 residents, also rejected by the judge, would have worked out to $400 per person.\nDonato accused the residents\u2019 attorneys, Charles and Cabral Bonner, of colluding against Tetra Tech EC, a third defendant in the lawsuit but left out of the settlement talks. The unit of Tetra Tech was hired two decades ago to\nclean hazardous radiation and toxic substances\nfrom the shipyard once owned by the U.S. Navy.\nThe developers and the Bonners had entered into a \u201ccommon interest agreement,\u201d which allows parties with shared legal interests to share information in order to collaborate on defense strategies. But the judge said the residents and developers are \u201cadverse parties\u201d who cut a deal to target Tetra Tech EC.\nSuch a settlement \u201cbecomes collusive when it is aimed to injure the interests\u201d of an absent defendant, Donato said.\n\nThe Bonners have denied wrongdoing, saying they acted in the best interest of their clients by collaborating with the developers. Lennar declined to comment to the Chronicle, while FivePoint didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nSam Singer, a spokesperson for Pasadena-based Tetra Tech EC said: \u201cThe judge\u2019s order speaks for itself.\u201d\nAfter signing the common interest agreement, the Bonners amended the residents\u2019 complaint for the sixth time. The changes \u201cdrastically narrowed plaintiff\u2019s claims against the home builder defendants, dropped the class allegations against them, and deleted the damages demand of $1 billion,\u201d Donato wrote in his order.\n\u201cThe evidence of collusion is striking,\u201d Donato wrote. During the hearing, he questioned why the developers should be allowed to exit a $1 billion lawsuit in exchange for \u201cpaying nickels.\u201d\nFivePoint, a spinoff of Lennar, has entitlements for thousands of homes and millions of square feet of commercial space at Hunter\u2019s Point.\nA trial date for the case is set for next year, but the Bonners said they are talking with the developers about another settlement deal, and\nreached out to Tetra Tech EC\nto \u201csee if they are interested in negotiating.\u201d\nTetra Tech EC has faced\nmultiple ongoing lawsuits\nrelated to the cleanup of the 500-acre shipyard site, including a lawsuit filed by the developers in 2020. This year, the U.S. Department of Justice agreed to settle a lawsuit brought against the contractor a decade ago, originally by whistleblowers, for\n$97 million\n, according to the Chronicle.\nThe Navy previously said in other court filings that the \u201cnegative fiscal impact\u201d of the fraud at the shipyard is between\n$370 million and $570 million\n.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "When Tony Prophet joined Salesforce as its chief equality officer in 2016, he wanted the \u201creal urban experience of living in San Francisco,\u201d which he didn\u2019t associate with the city\u2019s\ntraditional high-end neighborhoods\non the north side of town. Instead he went into\nSoMa\n, \u201ceyes wide open,\u201d buying a 7,000-square-foot top-floor condo at 9 Bernice Street for just over $7 million in November 2016.\n\u201cNo surprises,\u201d he said of his time living with his then-wife and their son at the semi-industrial location near Rainbow Grocery and the DNA Lounge. \u201cWe knew everything\u2014all the good and the challenges that we were in for\u2014and saw some real improvements along the way.\u201d\nNearly a decade later and with more than $1 million poured into creating a wind-shielded roof deck with astroturf and a fire pit, Prophet is hoping his condo will break West SOMA residential records, with an asking price of $8.8 million.\nA price of about $1,250 per square foot is not out of step for the neighborhood. But because there are not many condos or even single-family homes as big as 9 Bernice, there are seldom sales above $5 million. So while it\u2019s \u201cimpossible to replicate what\u2019s been done here,\u201d according to Compass agent Butch Haze, who is listing the skylit two-level loft with three bedrooms, 3.5 baths, a wine room, and a glass-enclosed gym, it\u2019s also nearly impossible to find comps.\n\u201cYou really have to compare it to buying a warehouse and what it would take to do the TIs,\u201d he said, adding that the turnkey aspect is \u201cbaked in\u201d to the asking price.\nThere are added perks as well. The condo includes the elaborate light fixtures and large-scale furniture, almost entirely from Restoration Hardware, including a 16-seat dining table that was craned in by the previous owner, luxury retailer Wilkes-Bashford co-owner Tyler Mitchell.\n\n\u201cNot everyone loves Restoration Hardware, but nobody hates it,\u201d said Prophet, who built on interior designer Ken Fulk\u2019s work for Mitchell.\nThe new price marks a big drop from the last time the condo was on the market in 2022, when it was listed at just under $11 million. The home didn\u2019t find a buyer at the time, but Prophet had already moved to Florida so his son could attend IMG, a sports academy about an hour south of Tampa. For the last two years, he has rented it to a foursome of entrepreneurs from the start up world. Haze said the new price had to speak to today\u2019s \u201cvalue-driven buyer.\u201d\n\u201cWe wanted to price it where the price per square foot is just too attractive,\u201d Haze said.\nThere are a lot of early stage businesses walking distance from the property, Prophet added, which borders the Mission, Potero Hill and the Design District. The \u201cperfect fit\u201d would be someone who is excited by the idea of walking to work and entertaining in the enormous space, he said.\nProphet said he hosted everything from fundraisers for London Breed and the Women\u2019s HIV Program at UCSF to media events for Salesforce during his time there. He left Salesforce in 2021, and now sits on the board at Dolby Labs and is an investor and board member for an AI-assisted sales platform called Aviso.\nThe likely buyer for this home probably also sits on a lot of boards, Haze said, and is in their 50s or 60s but still active in tech or finance. They probably already own more traditional homes outside the city, but are looking for something different. It may be somebody that has \u201cflirted with\u201d the north side of the city or Noe Valley, but can\u2019t pass up the outside-the-box offering.\n\u201cThey want to have fun in a really cool, almost superhero lair in San Francisco that wows all their friends,\u201d he said.\nThat\u2019s a very specific buyer profile, but Prophet said he can be patient until the right person comes along.\n\u201cIt\u2019s super special for someone who sees that opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the same situation when we bought it: a unique property and a high price point.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Two major San Francisco apartment building trades by longtime owners have closed in the first few months of the year, including the $35 million sale of the block-long Normandy Apartments, just behind the famed St. Mary\u2019s Cathedral.\nThe early spring sales are further signs of\nnew life in the market\nthat agents saw beginning in the latter half of last year.\nThe seller of the 1968-built 108-unit complex at 1135-1175 Ellis Street was a partnership called Normandy Apartments that goes back to at least the 1990s, according to city records. The buyer was affordable housing developer Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation, which bought the property with funding from the San Francisco Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing and Community Development and is planning a major renovation. The MOHCD confirmed the $35 million price.\nThe Jan. 31 acquisition will create \u201cpermanently affordable units in the City\u2019s Western Addition neighborhood for families, individuals, couples, older adults, and long-term residents within a variety of ethnic and racial backgrounds,\u201d according to a TNDC announcement. With the exception of one manager\u2019s unit, all apartments will be restricted to households not to exceed 120 percent of the city\u2019s area median income with an average of 80 percent of the city\u2019s AMI. In 2024, 80 percent of AMI would mean that a single person making up to $83,900 would be eligible, for example, while a household with three people could make up to $107,900, according to the MOHCD website.\nA November 2024 MOHCD memo about TNDC\u2019s request for just over $52 million in permanent financing for the purchase and rehabilitation of the nearly 70,000-square-foot property said the building is in \u201cgood condition\u201d and 90 percent occupied. The planned rehabilitation will focus on fire and life safety upgrades and accessibility and ADA upgrades and requirements.\nColliers agent Brad Lagomarsino represented the sellers and said that TNDC and MOHCD \u201cseized the rare opportunity to purchase 108 units in the heart of San Francisco\u201d. He added that the nearly 1.5-acre lot\u00a0 \u201coffers tremendous development potential that justifies the price paid for the asset.\u201d\n\nIn another early spring sale after a decades-long hold, a 36-unit Nob Hill apartment building traded for the first time since it was built in 1954, according to public records. The price was $14.5 million, or just over $400,000 per unit, according to the transfer tax on the sale. That\u2019s above the average of about $340,000 per unit in San Francisco in 2024, according to Colliers data.\nColliers listing agent Dustin Dolby said he could not comment on the Feb. 18 sale due to a non-disclosure agreement, but he posted on LinkedIn that, \u201cWith its proximity to Grace Cathedral, Huntington Park, and the Financial District, 1330 Jones exemplifies the enduring desirability of Nob Hill real estate.\u201d\nThe sellers were the descendants of the developer, Theo G. Meyer and Sons, which built the seven-story building, according to the deed and probate records. The buyer was Otrera Real Estate, LLC, a Delaware-created entity that lists its address as a P.O. Box at the Rincon Finance Center in downtown San Francisco, according to the deed. The buyers\u2019 agent is unknown.\nThe six-story building at 1330 Jones has 18 one-bedroom, one-bath units, six two-bedroom, one-bath units, and 12 two-bedroom, two-bath units, as well as 23 dedicated parking spots and onsite laundry.\nThe building was first listed as part of a\nthree-building portfolio\nthat was all developed by the Meyer family and came to market at an undisclosed price last summer. It is the smallest building of the three, and the only one to sell thus far. The other two buildings are a 62-unit, 13-story building at 1000 Green Street in Russian Hill and the 56-unit, 13-story Crest Royal at 1310 Jones, which is next door to the building that sold.\nAt least two other San Francisco apartment buildings asking over $10 million are also in contract but are still pending. Magnolia Place, which has 27 apartment units at 3322 Buchanan in the Marina, came to market at the end of September with an asking price of $18 million. The 2001-built non-rent-controlled building with two commercial units fronting Lombard Street has been pending as of Nov. 22, according to Redfin.\u00a0At 1745 Market, a property with 48 apartment units and eight commercial spaces, including local favorite piano bar Martuni\u2019s, went into contract on Jan. 27, according to Redfin. It is owned by\nMosser Properties\nand has been\non and off the market for the last few years\n, with a starting price of $25 million in 2022. It came back to market most recently last September, with an asking price of $14 million. That ask dropped to $13 million in November, just $1 million more than Mosser paid for it back in 2017.\n",

The two-phase project will replace former county probation offices.\nIt also may be first of its kind to use S-13 to streamline approvals and shorten development, according to the Business Times.\nThe S-13 zone allows 100 percent affordable housing projects to bypass environmental and discretionary review, while allowing an additional bonus height, if they meet certain objectives.\nWhile it can help developers get projects approved a year sooner than state streamlining laws like Senate Bill 35 and Assembly Bill 2011, it\u2019s three years faster than a traditional planning application.\nThe three buildings are part of a larger plan to remake Jack London Square with hundreds of affordable homes around a plaza containing a playground, public art and seating.\n\nThe developers plan to spend the next two years raising money to build the project, likely from Measure U Affordable Housing Infrastructure Bond funds, local funding and state financing in tax credits and bonds, according to the Business Times.\nA cost and timeline for the development were not disclosed.\nA later phase, also by Related and East Bay Asian Local Development, would add two affordable apartment buildings and a market-rate complex at 401 Broadway. A rendering suggests two seven- or eight-story buildings and a 20-story tower overlooking I-880.\nRelated California, founded in 1989, is a unit of New York-based Related Companies. The California subsidiary has developed 20,700 apartments, and owns and manages more than 13,000 affordable and workforce housing units across the Golden State, according to its website.\nEast Bay Asian Local Development, founded in 1975 by a group of Asian Pacific Islander college students and young professionals, owns and manages more than 35 residential and commercial developments, according to its website.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

That works out to $176,000 per unit.\nSunrise Realty Trust, an affiliate of TCG Real Estate, is providing $46.5 million of the loan; the rest was syndicated to an affiliate on the TCG Real Estate platform, the release said.\nThe Class A property, at 1207 North Zang Boulevard, is located across the street from Methodist Dallas Medical Center and was built on the site of El Fenix restaurant. It features a rooftop pool and a remote work lounge with private meeting rooms.\nSan Antonio-based developer Kairoi is known for its upscale apartments.

        "content": "The future of Dallas\u2019 iconic \u201cMushroom House\u201d is uncertain after car dealer Clay Cooley acquired the home along with two adjacent Highland Park properties, sparking speculation about potential teardowns.\nThe house at 4200 Armstrong Parkway, known for its curved design and green-blue copper roof, is one of three multimillion-dollar mansions Cooley and his wife, Lisa, own at Armstrong Parkway and Bordeaux Avenue, The Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. The other two are at 4208 Armstrong Parkway and 4209 Bordeaux Avenue.\nThe couple\u2019s plans for their 2.5 acres of prime properties are a mystery. They haven\u2019t commented, but it\u2019s led to questions about whether the unique home, and the historic residences next to it, will survive or be cleared to make way for new construction.\nThe Cooleys haven\u2019t filed any demolition or major renovation permits, though plumbing and mechanical permits were submitted for two of the properties. Preservationists are hopeful that at least the 1920s Tudor-style home on Bordeaux, designed by famed architect Hal Thomson, will be spared.\nThe group Preservation Park Cities recently toured two of the homes but wasn\u2019t allowed inside 4208 Armstrong Parkway due to structural concerns.\nClay Cooley attended a Preservation Park Cities meeting in February, where he expressed a desire to avoid community conflict. Preservationists suggested a design that would retain the Bordeaux home as a guesthouse while allowing for a new build on the Armstrong lots.\n\nThe couple bought the home at 4208 Armstrong Parkway first, in 2020, county records show. They then purchased 4209 Bordeaux Avenue and the Mushroom House in a five-month period, transferring them into their name by December 2024.\nThe Mushroom House, completed in 1997 by Dallas architect Tom Workman, has long divided opinion for its whimsical, storybook-like design. Its price history is unavailable, but its market value is estimated at over $7.5 million, according to Zillow.\nPreservationists admit that while the house is architecturally significant, it may be less defensible due to its modern construction and location on a highly visible lot.\nLocal ordinances also complicate the equation. Highland Park rules prohibit combining all three parcels into a single lot, which could influence Cooley\u2019s final decision.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

Although a groundbreaking ceremony was held last year, the convention center design hasn\u2019t been finalized; plans for the facility have shifted multiple times.\nConcerns about the train project compelled Dallas City Council to back an alternative route for the train last summer; officials said they\u2019d revisit the issue after reviewing the economic impact of various high-speed routes.\nHunt is also the developer behind NorthEnd, a $5 billion mixed-use development that will include a\n$500 million campus\nfor Goldman Sachs.\n\u2013Jess Hardin\n",

The asking price pencils out to $1,860 per square feet.\nA separate listing includes 4705 Island Cove, 4709 Island Cove and 4400 Island Avenue for $25.5 million, combining 4.85 acres and approximately 450 feet of Lake Austin frontage.\nEric Moreland of Moreland Properties has the listing; the identity of the seller, who owns all three properties, is hidden by a trust.\nForty-eight listings over $2 million were added to Austin\u2019s inventory last week, 12 more than it added\nthe week prior\n, according to the Eklund Gomes luxury report.\n\nContracts on luxury homes dipped, from 12 the week before to six last week, five single-family homes and one $2.24 million condo. Purchases typically slow when the annual 9-day SXSW festival and conference takes over the city, Eklund Gomes\u2019 Michael Reisor said.\nThe top contract was for a 5,800-square-foot home last listed for $5.3 million at 4900 Amarra Drive in Barton Creek. It has five bedrooms and a detached guesthouse. It asked $900 per square foot and was listed by Eric Moreland.\nThe other four single-family homes ranged in listed price from $2.5 to $3.25 million, with three in Tarrytown and one near Bee Cave, in the Bella Montagna neighborhood.\nThe condo deal went down for a penthouse asking about $900 per square foot at 901 West 9th Street, unit 704, at the Nokonah residences. The nearly 2,500-square-foot unit has 2 bedrooms, a balcony and an 800-bottle wine cellar.\nThe Nokonah was developed by Robert Barnstone and Perry Lorenz in 2001.

The 1.93-acre property has been owned by the Halperin family for the past 19 years.\nThe development would feature 310 residential units covering about 40 percent of the site, while the remainder will focus on open space, pedestrian-friendly amenities and two or three restaurants, some spanning multiple levels with roof terraces. GFF Design is attached to the project.\nTenants of the strip mall include Open Sesame Lebanese Grill, whose owners have been in discussions with Halperin about remaining in the neighborhood, though whether it stays on-site or relocates is still undecided.\n\nThe project\u2019s design takes a cue from the Old Parkland campus redevelopment by Crow Holdings at 3819 Maple Avenue, which GFF CEO Evan Beattie called \u201ctransformational\u201d for the neighborhood.\nThe redevelopment requires rezoning, which could take up to two years to finalize.\nThe project is set to add to the wave of redevelopment reshaping Oak Lawn, a neighborhood known for its nightlife and identity as the heart of Dallas\u2019 LGBTQ+ community.\nSeveral office and residential developments are underway nearby, like McCourt Partners and HN Capital Partners\u2019 40-acre mixed-use development at\n1650 Oak Lawn Avenue\nas well as\nThe Oak Lawn Design Plaza\n, covering nine acres at 1444 Oak Lawn Avenue from Charlotte, North Carolina\u2013based investor Asana Partners.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

But earlier this month, Dallas officials resolved that problem by securing the deed for the disputed portion of the property.\nThe company, however, has held firm, stating the\ndecision to close is \u201cfinal\u201d\nand that the situation is \u201cfar more complicated than what the public is being led to believe.\u201d Saks has also said its attempts to meet with city officials have been rejected.\n\nIt remains uncertain whether the city\u2019s proposed deal is enough to prompt reconsideration, or even a temporary extension of operations. Tolbert\u2019s letter asked for a response to \u201cthe collective group,\u201d and said Neiman Marcus would have time to \u201ccapture the opportunity we wish to discuss\u201d if the company keeps the store open for a few months longer.\nAlong with the store, Neiman Marcus also plans to vacate its 82,000-square-foot headquarters in NexPoint\u2019s 42-story Cityplace Tower at 2711 North Haskell Avenue.\nThe looming closure threatens to leave a major gap in the city\u2019s downtown retail landscape and in the historic character of Dallas. Neiman Marcus has operated its flagship store for more than a century, serving as an anchor for the district\u2019s identity and economic activity.\nThe consortium is holding out hope of avoiding the significant loss to the city\u2019s downtown core, while Saks is investing $100 million into its Neiman Marcus store at NorthPark Center.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

Twelve Republican lawmakers who replaced pro-gambling politicians in the last election are holding the line against casinos, the Texas Tribune\nreported\n. They are joined by three others who voted in favor of sports betting last session but have since rescinded their support.\nThey said this week they would oppose \u201cany attempt to expand gambling\u201d this session, which ends in May. After that, the Texas Legislature won\u2019t meet in regular session again until 2027.\nProposals to legalize casinos and sports betting have been introduced, but the GOP coalition aims to stop them in their tracks. Neither proposal has received a committee hearing, the first step to consideration by the full house.\nThat could be bad news for the city of Irving, where Sands is seeking zoning approval for a Mavericks stadium with a resort and entertainment center, including a casino. Sands is spending big on lobbying and advertising campaigns in favor of \u201cdestination resort\u201d casinos. If a casino is a no-go, Sands has said it is\nlikely to kill the entire proposal\n.\nMeanwhile in Southern Dallas, developer\nHoque Global\nmet its first deadline in its agreement with the city of Dallas for its University Hills megadevelopment.

The lease brings the building, at 845 Texas Avenue to 99 percent leased.\nAnother law firm, Hicks Johson, is spending $4.3 million to build out its lease at\nSkanska\u2019s\nNorton Rose Fullbright tower at 1550 Lamar Street, which is\ndowntown Houston\u2019s newest\noffice building.\nAnd a retail merchandiser is\nmoving its headquarters\nto 5801 Headquarters Drive in Plano, owned by\nMonarch Alternative Capital\nand\nTourmaline Capital Partners\nand built in 2021. The company will exit Granite Properties\u2019 Granite Park III, which was built in 2007.\nAnd in Austin, Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms is spending $3.7 million on an\noffice buildout in downtown Austin\n, although it\u2019s not clear for whom.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

Horton, holds 3,490 acres. As Houston\u2019s most active homebuilder in 2023, it led the region with 5,570 home starts and continues expanding in suburban communities.\nMeanwhile, Colony Ridge controls nearly 15,000 acres, primarily in Liberty County. The firm, known for developing infrastructure-ready lots, remains a major driver of suburban sprawl despite facing\nscrutiny over its business practices\n.\n\nPublic entities are also prominent landholders. The City of Houston manages 31,530 acres, including major public assets like George Bush Intercontinental Airport, parklands and municipal facilities. The Harris County Flood Control District controls 26,000 acres for its role in flood mitigation efforts.\nThe role of public entities in flood mitigation is particularly crucial, the Bayou City\u2019s low-lying topography and history of major flooding events making infrastructure and water management far more important to long-term development planning relative to most other Texas metros.\nHarris County itself holds 30,130 acres, spanning government buildings, recreational spaces and major event venues like NRG Park.\nHouston\u2019s sprawl is driven by a mix of public investment and private development, with much of the metro\u2019s expansion occurring along major growth corridors like Interstate 45, U.S. Highway 59 and the Grand Parkway.\nLiberty County, where Colony Ridge dominates, is one of the fastest-growing exurban areas, driven by demand for affordable housing. Its population increased 25.5 percent from mid-2020 to last summer, Census data shows.\nMeanwhile, Fort Bend and Montgomery counties continue to attract large-scale master-planned communities, fueled by population growth and proximity to Houston\u2019s employment centers.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

The development is near Fort Worth\u2019s Cultural District, just off Interstate 30.\nThe antique mall has been a fixture in the district for more than 30 years, drawing loyal patrons and housing the Secret Garden restaurant. News of the redevelopment sparked social media backlash, with some residents calling it a \u201cterrible decision\u201d that could displace locals and worsen traffic. No one spoke in opposition at the council\u2019s zoning hearing, despite online pushback.\nCouncil member Macy Hill noted that developers met with local stakeholders prior to the meeting and expressed optimism about the project\u2019s potential to modernize the area.\n\nMontgomery Street Antique Mall\u2019s owners have yet to announce whether the business will relocate or close.\nPhoenix is also working with the Texas Department of Transportation to address concerns about traffic flow and access at the nearby intersection of Montgomery Street and I-30.\nThe project is part of the redevelopment trend across Fort Worth.

Monarch Alternative Capital and Tourmaline Capital Partners purchased the property in 2021.\n\nIt includes features like a game lounge that includes a golf simulator.

Meanwhile, operators of older inventory are under pressure to compete with new deliveries.\nThat\u2019s just one segment of the Dallas-Fort Worth office market, which had 52.8 million square feet of unused office space in November. The Metroplex ranked third in the country for office vacancy, behind New York and Chicago.\n",

He joined Crescent in 2006 when it operated as Goff Capital Partners before its conversion to Crescent Real Estate in 2016.\nThe firm has also promoted several internal leaders. These include Christopher Goff \u2014 Chairman John Goff\u2019s son \u2014 to senior managing director, head of capital formation; Andrew Lombardi, who will remain CFO, to senior managing director; Noelle Garsek to managing director, general counsel; and Ben Molk to managing director, office. Joseph Pitchford, managing director of development, will join Crescent\u2019s senior management committee.\nThe leadership shift comes as Crescent expands its footprint across North Texas. The firm manages $4.4 billion in assets and oversees about $225 million in development.\n\nCrescent is raising $250 million for its fourth GP Invitation Fund as it strengthens its development pipeline. The firm\u2019s portfolio includes marquee assets like The Crescent in Uptown Dallas \u2014 a 1.3 million-square-foot property with office, retail and hotel components \u2014 and the Robert L. Crandall corporate campus for American Airlines in Fort Worth.\nIts development activity is also expanding. Crescent is advancing a\nsecond office tower in Fort Worth\n, constructing the 30-story, 215-unit\nCrescent Point Tower\nin Uptown Dallas and preparing to open a 31-story\nluxury apartment building\nat 2811 Maple in May, where rents start at $4,000 a month.\nIt recently started development on its 92-home\nhigh-end housing project in Horseshoe Bay\nnear Marble Falls, northwest of Austin. Groundwork and infrastructure at the 114-acre site is expected to be completed in March 2026.\nSuszynski said the company is deepening its focus on high-quality development, particularly in Uptown Dallas and Fort Worth, where Crescent is looking to cultivate environments that mirror the success of its flagship properties.\nThe leadership team has an average tenure of over 12 years, Suszynski said.\n",

        "content": "UPDATE: Irving\u2019s Zoning Commission narrowly approved two zoning requests that would pave the way for Las Vegas Sands to build a casino on land the company owns in Irving.\nLas Vegas Sands\u2019 vision for a destination resort in Irving is facing growing public resistance, with concerns over the proposed casino dominating recent discussions.\nMore than 30 Irving residents spoke against the proposal, criticizing the casino element and raising concerns about the city\u2019s planning process in a Planning and Zoning Commission meeting last week, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe commission is\nconsidering a proposal\nto rezone the 182-acre site owned by Sands to allow for high-density, mixed-use development. Sands acquired 259 acres near the former Texas Stadium in mid-2023.\nThe changes would pave the way for a destination resort featuring a potential casino \u2014 pending state legalization \u2014 as well as a 15,000-seat arena for the Dallas Mavericks, plus a hotel, retail and entertainment spaces.\nThe debate comes amid broader speculation about the future of the Dallas Mavericks, co-owned by Sands\u2019\nnewly promoted CEO Patrick Dumont\n. Sands bought Mark Cuban\u2019s majority stake in the Mavericks for $3.5 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nThe rezoning would also establish a baseline development framework, though Sands would need to submit detailed plans for approval later. The proposal is still moving through the early stages. The commission scheduled to revisit it on Monday before a possible city council vote next Thursday.\nResidents argued that discussions were being rushed and lacked transparency, with some claiming they first learned of the zoning amendments just 48 hours before the meeting. Others questioned why city leaders would consider approving zoning for a casino while gambling is illegal in Texas.\nSands has said that a casino is essential for the project\u2019s financial viability. Casino revenue is necessary to support other resort amenities like convention space and entertainment venues, the company said.\nThe company plans to have representatives at the upcoming meetings and maintained Sands is committed to \u201congoing engagement and collaboration,\u201d spokesman Ron Reese said.\nRemoving casino gaming from the zoning could force Sands to reconsider the development altogether, he said.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

The lease will begin in April 2026, but the terms weren\u2019t otherwise disclosed.\nThe deal leaves just 18,000 square feet available in the 47-story, 1.2 million-square-foot tower, which is co-owned by Houston-based Hines and Ivanhoe Cambridge. Savills\u2019 Mark O\u2019Donnell represented the tenant, and Michael Anderson of Cushman &amp; Wakefield represented the landlords.\nThe lease follows Hines\u2019\nlanding a rare $450 million refinancing\nearlier this month, marking the first time in two years a multi-tenant office tower outside New York City was financed through the CMBS single-asset, single-borrower market.\nSkadden will move from its 24,000-square-foot space at 1000 Louisiana Street, Wells Fargo Plaza.\nThat 71-story tower was built in 1983. Its owner, MetLife, plans to spend $138,000 to remodel its 900-square-foot\namenity space\nfor an arcade game room to lure tenants after adding a golf simulator last year. It is also adding a restaurant, bar and tenant lounge, according to the building\u2019s website.\nTexas Tower opened in 2021 and is among the city\u2019s most leased Class A office towers. Other tenants, with Hines\u2019 global headquarters, include law firms Vinson &amp; Elkins, Clifford Chance and DLA Piper as well as Cheniere Energy, Morgan Stanley and coworking space The Square.\n\nThe tower includes two restaurants managed by Berg Hospitality Group. The Sylvie, a French bistro, opened last year. Seafood restaurant Dune Road was set to open last year but hasn\u2019t yet delivered.\nIt also features amenities like underfloor air conditioning, private terraces and a 9,600-square-foot amenity center with a lounge and conference space.\nThe tower\u2019s leasing success highlights the \u201cflight-to-quality\u201d trend, Hines senior managing director John Mooz said.\nClass A inventory has tightened in the city as tenants opt to lease where amenities are enticing enough to lure and retain workers. Older buildings have suffered as a result. The office vacancy rate remains high; it was up to 25.7 percent in the fourth quarter, according to CoStar.\nHouston\u2019s office pipeline has 1.9 million square feet of space under development, about tied with Los Angeles as of January, according to data from CommercialEdge cited by\nCommercialCafe\n. Dallas has 2.8 million square feet underway, and Austin has 3.6 million, the second-most in the nation behind Boston.\nThe drop in office output from previous years across southern markets will likely have a positive effect on occupancy rates, especially as more employers initiate return-to-office mandates, the site said.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "The owner of a Nolita property once slated for development by\nBrandon Miller\u2019s\nReal Estate Equities Corporation is suing the developer and its principals for abandoning the ill-fated office project.\nAri Zagdanski\u2019s Kinsmen Property Group\nclaims Real Estate Equities, or REEC, owes more than $2.9 million in ground rent at 156-166 Bowery Street, according to a new lawsuit filed in state Supreme Court. Kinsmen is suing REEC, principal Mark Seigel and Brandon Miller\u2019s widow Candice, who\u2019s the\nadministrator of his estate\n.\nThe landlord claims that REEC owes more than $5.3 million in back rent, demolition costs, tax reimbursements and outstanding liens on the property.\nREEC took over the leasehold for the 15,000-square-foot assemblage in February 2021 in a deal valued at $50 million. It agreed to demolish the property within 18 months and complete construction on a six- or seven-story mixed-use office building by February 2026, the suit alleges.\nBut that never happened. Instead, REEC failed to pay the ground rent or made partial payments for several months in 2024, the suit alleges. REEC also bailed on more than $600,000 in real estate taxes, which Kinsmen paid to avoid interest and penalties, the suit alleges. The landlord slapped REEC with a default notice in August, the month after\nMiller died\n.\n\nKinsmen filed permits in October to tear down the vacant, graffiti-covered buildings on the property and spent $1.7 million on demolition and related costs, the suit alleges. The landlord later demanded to be reimbursed by Seigel and Candice Miller, as successor to Brandon, who it says \u201cjointly and severally\u201d guaranteed the construction costs.\nLawyers for Kinsmen and Miller did not immediately respond to comment. Seigel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBrandon Miller died by suicide on July 3, leaving behind a tangled web of\nunfinished real estate projects\nand delinquent payments. REEC has gone dark since Brandon\u2019s death and the company\u2019s website is now hidden behind a password, raising questions about the future of REEC and its projects.\nThe landlord terminated REEC\u2019s ground lease in January.\nMeanwhile,\ntwo other properties\nonce envisioned by Miller are turning a corner. Leasing has begun at an East Village office property developed by REEC and a vacant lot in Chelsea where Miller once envisioned another office building is up for sale.\n",

        "content": "Stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before: People in real estate gave Andrew Cuomo money.\nIt has been a while since I\u2019ve written a story about this, but there was a time when it was a regular thing.\nThe latest campaign filings (showing donations between Jan. 12 and March 13) show RXR CEO Scott Rechler, previously a\nconsistent\ndonor to Cuomo when he was governor, gave Fix the City,\na super PAC backing\nCuomo, $250,000. He also donated $2,100 directly to Cuomo\u2019s campaign this month.\nAn entity tied to Lightstone contributed $100,000 to the PAC. Joseph Paolino Jr., former mayor of Rhode Island turned developer, gave $25,000. A&amp;E Real Estate\u2019s Douglas Eisenberg donated $125,000 to the PAC. Anthony Scarmucci\u2019s Skybridge Capital threw the PAC $100,000. Scarmucci and his wife also each gave $2,100 to Cuomo\u2019s campaign.\nTwenty-one people who self-identified as working in real estate gave Cuomo\u2019s campaign the maximum $2,100, or a total of more than $44,000. That group included Cammeby\u2019s Avi Schron, KRE Group\u2019s Jonathan Kushner, Capstone Equities\u2019 Daniel Ghadamian, Ruben Companies\u2019 Andrew and Richard Ruben, Somerset\u2019s Keith Rubenstein, GFP\u2019s Jeff Gural and BFC Partners\u2019 Winthrop Wharton.\nSeveral employees of L+M Development Partners gave to Cuomo, including Ron Moelis ($400), as did employees of Two Trees Management (including founder David and principal Jed Walentas, with the latter having also donated to Whitney Tilson and Zellnor Myrie).\nDonors who indicated that they work in real estate gave more than $73,000 to Cuomo\u2019s campaign. But many real estate folks are sneaky and list their occupation as CEO or chief executive or self-employed, which is a small part of why sifting through campaign donations is a nightmare.\nAmong that group, in addition to Gural and Rechler, I spotted MAG Partners\u2019 MaryAnne Gilmartin, who donated $1,000 and Ashley Cotton (who\npreviously worked for Cuomo\n), who gave $250. Brown Harris Stevens CEO Bess Freedman donated $250, as did Douglaston Development\u2019s Jessica Sherman.\nReal estate donors in the other campaigns are more scattered. Mayor Eric Adams previously could count on donations from heavy hitters in the industry, but many have\nbacked off\ngiving to his campaign since his indictment. His latest filing shows he only brought in a little more than $36,000 between Jan. 12 and March 13, with only a couple donations from smaller real estate players.\nA PAC tied to the Real Estate Board of New York (Taxpayers for an Affordable New York) gave City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams $2,100.\n\u201cAdrienne Adams has advanced a pro-growth agenda as Speaker, most notably in her support for City of Yes,\u201d REBNY President Jim Whelan said in a statement. He noted that the passage of the broker fee bill, known as the FARe Act, was \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d but said she is an \u201cimportant voice to the Mayor\u2019s race.\u201d\nAdams is also remains an influential force in the city, given that even if she loses the primary, she will be the City Council Speaker through the end of the year.\n\nLaszlo Syrop, managing director of acquisitions at the Hudson Companies, donated $175 to Sen. Zellnor Myrie. Moelis also gave Myrie $400.\nA PAC tied to Airbnb has spent more than $400,000 on ads supporting City Council incumbents Kevin Riley, Oswald Feliz, Amanda Farias, Selvena Brooks-Powers and Mercedes Narcisse. The groups is also supporting Tyrell Hankerson\u2019s bid for Adrienne Adams\u2019 Council seat and Rafael Salamanca\u2019s campaign for Bronx Borough President. The incumbents are all sponsors on a bill that would ease stringent short-term rental rules for allow one- and two-family homes, allowing owners to rent out their property for fewer than 30 days, using sites like Airbnb.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat do you make of real estate companies\nrolling back\ntheir diversity, equity and inclusion policies? Do you have any experiences with these programs and policies? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nThere was a time when mortgages were great? Bill Pulte, the new director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency,\nposted \u201cMake Mortgages Great Again\u201d on social media platform X\non Saturday. On Monday, Pulte removed eight members from the Fannie Mae board and six members from the Freddie Mac board.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 The city agreed to pay cab drivers $140 million in back pay to settle a lawsuit filed in 2006,\nGothamist reports\n. A federal court found that the Taxi and Limousine Commission unfairly revoked licenses from thousands of drivers after they were arrested, even though they were never convicted.\n\u2014 The state will pay $8 million to settle a claim brought by Carl Dukes, who spent nearly two decades in prison for a murder he did not commit,\nthe Times Union reports\n. The settlement comes after a state appellate court ruled that Albany detectives had coerced a confession from Dukes, related to the murder of a University at Albany student in 1997. The court found that Dukes was innocent and should be further compensated for the time he spent incarcerated.\n\u2014 Unless a court says otherwise, the city\u2019s congestion pricing program will continue despite the Friday shutdown deadline set by the Federal Highway Administration,\nCBS New York reports\n. MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber said the \u201cdeadline will come and go and the congestion pricing program will continue to deliver much better traffic environment for New York and economic benefits as well.\u201d\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Tuesday was\n$60 million\nfor a 5,840-square-foot condominium at 150 Charles Street in the West Village. Peter Zaitzeff, Jared Freedman and Samantha Germano of\nSerhant had the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$27.5 million\nfor a 9,765-square-foot commercial building at 34 East 61st Street in Lenox Hill. Christian Advocates Serving Evangelism (CASE) sold the property to Kassin Sabbagh Realty.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$29.5 million\nfor a 4,019-square-foot condominium at 432 Park Avenue in Midtown. The Eklund Gomes Team at Douglas Elliman has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 226,342-square-foot, eight-story, 236-unit project at 694 East 142nd Street in North New York. Alen Moghaddam filed the permit on behalf of NYC\u2019s Building &amp; Land Development Services.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

Hu was\nindicted last month\nfor allegedly bribing the chief executive officer of a nonprofit.\nThe Fresh Meadows hotel has housed formerly incarcerated people since 2021 and served as the site for\nmultiple fundraisers\nto support Adams.\nProsecutors say\nHu paid Julio Medina, the head of a taxpayer-funded program for recently released incarcerated people, elaborate kickbacks including the purchase of a $1.3 million townhouse and financing on a luxury vehicle. In exchange, Hu allegedly received more than $20 million in city-funded contracts for two of her hotels, as well as her catering company.\nHu pleaded not guilty to all charges. She is negotiating a plea agreement, according to court filings, though her criminal attorney denies any negotiations.\nCity Comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander is pushing for the Adams administration to cancel a contract extension that would ultimately steer $20 million towards Hu, according to\nThe City\n. The three-year renewal would begin in July.\n\nA spokesperson for the mayor\u2019s office of criminal justice \u2014 the contract holder \u2014 said the administration is looking for an alternative site, but that it could be challenging; a spokesperson for HousingWorks, the nonprofit occupying the space, said no substantive coordination between the organization and city about relocating has happened.\nSecurity firm owner Christopher Dantzler was also charged in what prosecutors labeled an elaborate kickback scheme involving more than $120 million in public funds being steered toward Exodus. Medina ultimately funneled $51 million in public funds to companies belonging to Hu and Dantzler, according to prosecutors.\nHu was released on a $20 million bond with her passport seized, while Medina and Dantzler were released on $250,000 and $750,000 bonds, respectively. All three defendants pleaded not guilty.\nHu has been on the receiving end of positive regulatory decisions from local officials, including approval of construction projects that were either cited for worker safety or affordable housing violations.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The property is also only steps from Lincoln Center.\nThe property faced controversy when Glenwood\nnot only banned dogs\nweighing 15 pounds or more from the building but also required dogs to be carried by their owners into the elevator to avoid doggy paws scuffing up the lobby floors.\nElsewhere in Lincoln Square, the Gotham Organization and the Carlyle Group\nlanded a $216 million bridge loan\na year ago associated with their acquisition of the building at 200 West 67th Street. The loan, provided by MF1 Capital, was brought to market shortly after Gotham and Carlyle purchased The Aire from A&amp;R Kalimian Realty\nfor $265 million\n.\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Bally\u2019s is hedging a bet on its controversial diversity-focused fundraising plan for its $1.7 billion Chicago casino development on the former Tribune newspaper printing plant site in River West.\nBally\u2019s Chicago is now seeking to raise $195 million through a private share sale, as the Securities and Exchange Commission has halted an effort to raise $250 million through an initial public offering exclusively targeted at women and minority investors, the Chicago Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe shift in fundraising methods comes as the company, a subsidiary of Rhode Island-based Bally\u2019s Corp., is navigating significant regulatory challenges for its project, which is set to become the Windy City\u2019s first full-fledged permanent gambling emporium.\nLast summer, Bally\u2019s Chicago garnered attention with plans for a $250 million IPO exclusively targeting qualified female and minority investors. This initiative was prompted by a mandate from the city of Chicago, stipulating that 25 percent of the new casino must be owned by minorities and women. However, the SEC has yet to approve the IPO, citing the need for updated audited financials from Bally\u2019s Chicago.\n\nIn response to the regulatory delay, Bally\u2019s launched a private placement offering, which has already secured over $83 million from 270 accredited investors, the outlet reported, citing the firm\u2019s financial disclosures. This approach is running alongside the stalled public offering and includes individuals who meet the criteria specified by Chicago\u2019s ownership mandate, according to Bally\u2019s spokesperson Richard Land.\nLegal hurdles loom, however. The IPO has faced federal court challenges, with accusations of discrimination leveled by plaintiffs supported by groups like the American Alliance for Equal Rights and the Liberty Justice Center. These lawsuits argue that the IPO unfairly favors minority and female investors, potentially excluding others from participating in the investment opportunity.\nMeanwhile, Bally\u2019s continues to refund deposits to potential IPO investors as it strives to gain SEC clearance. The company remains optimistic about its casino project, which has recently received site plan approval and is slated to open in September 2026. The complex promises a 500-room hotel, entertainment venues, multiple dining options, and public spaces, and aims to redefine Chicago\u2019s hospitality and gaming scene.\n\u2014 Sam Lounsberry\n",

Investigators discovered one signature belonged to a co-owner who died in 2016.\n\nWeeks later, the defendants allegedly filed forged documents transferring a Kew Gardens Hills home from its mother-daughter owners to another one of Ray\u2019s companies. By May, they had sold this property to a third party for $600,000, according to the indictment, and approximately $442,000 was wired to an account linked to Ray.\nThe third party who purchased the property has since filed a civil suit against the legitimate owners, although proceedings have been stayed under legislation enacted in 2023 to\nprotect against deed fraud\n.\nIn May 2023, the group also allegedly targeted an 82-year-old woman\u2019s Jamaica Estates home using similar tactics.\nAll four defendants surrendered to authorities on Wednesday. They are scheduled to return to court on April 29. If convicted, Ray, Valeri and Avinger face up to 25 years in prison, while Guice faces up to 15 years.\n",

Meiner was upset that O Cinema\u2019s leadership went ahead with the screenings after initially acquiescing to his demand not to show the film, directed by Palestinian activist Basel Adra and Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham.\nLast week, Meiner condemned \u201cNo Other Land\u201d as \u201ca false one-sided propaganda attack on the Jewish people.\u201d\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s meeting, Meiner claimed his reaction was rooted in ensuring public safety for the city\u2019s Jewish constituents amid rising anti-Semitism across the globe because of Israel\u2019s ongoing destruction of Palestine since Hamas terrorists killed more than 1,400 Israelis and kidnapped 240 more on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\u201cThroughout history, there\u2019s been different excuses for hating Jews,\u201d Meiner said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s because Jews are too successful, sometimes because they\u2019re too poor. Now it\u2019s the state of Israel. It doesn\u2019t matter. Every generation it morphs into something else. It\u2019s just a convenient excuse. And that\u2019s what I was trying to highlight.\u201d\nStill, a majority of speakers during the meeting\u2019s public comments voiced opposition to Meiner\u2019s push to evict O Cinema, calling his actions government censorship.\n\u201cWe saw democracy in action,\u201d O Cinema co-founder Kareem Tabsch told\nThe Real Deal\nfollowing the meeting. \u201cThere was an outpouring of support for O Cinema, and I think Meiner did the right thing. I respect his viewpoint and decisions.\u2026It\u2019s not the government\u2019s role to dictate what art organizations should be showing or not showing.\u201d\nA majority of the city commission concurred with Tabsch\u2019s view. \u201cThe First Amendment is clear,\u201d commissioner Fernandez said during the meeting. \u201cThe government must never censor artistic expression even when it is controversial or deeply offensive.\u201d\nVice-Mayor Bhatt noted that O Cinema has shown more than 50 pro-Israel films by Jewish filmmakers, hosts the Miami Jewish Film Festival and screened a 12-hour documentary about the Holocaust. \u201cTo silence that voice does more damage than almost anything I can think of,\u201d Bhatt said. \u201cI will tell you that I\u2019m not censoring anybody.\u201d",

        "content": "Journey Capital scooped up a 404-unit multifamily complex in Plantation for $102 million.\nThe New York-based investment manager bought Rise at Plantation Walk at 333 North University Drive from Boca Raton-based Encore Capital Management, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The deal breaks down to $252,500 per unit.\nJourney borrowed $89.7 million from Houston-based Corebridge Financial.\nRise at Plantation Walk consists of a pair of seven-story buildings completed in 2021 and 2022 on a roughly 2.3-acre site, property records show. It offers studios and one- to three-bedroom apartments, with monthly rents ranging from $2,172 to $4,415, according to Apartments.com.\nThe complex is part of Encore Capital\u2019s mixed-use\nPlantation Walk\nproject on a 32-acre site that used to be Fashion Mall.\nEncore, led by\nArt Falcone\n, bought the then-vacant mall in a bankruptcy auction in 2015 for\n$37.7 million\n. In 2019, Plantation city officials\napproved\nthe redevelopment with up to 700 apartments, about 250,000 square feet of offices and 225,000 square feet of retail.\n\nEncore has sold completed portions of Plantation Walk over the years. In 2021, it sold the seven-story, 177,000-square-foot office building at 261 North University Drive to Vision Properties for\n$57.5 million\n.\nJourney Capital hasn\u2019t been a high-profile player in South Florida\u2019s market. The firm, founded in 2023, buys, develops and manages multifamily, industrial and mixed-use properties across the U.S., according to its website. It\u2019s led by CEO Peter Calatozzo.\nPreviously, Calatozzo was with Praedium Group, his LinkedIn shows.\nSouth Florida\u2019s\nmultifamily\ninvestment sales market has experienced an uptick during recent months after a slowdown over the past two years. Sales volume was $4.3 billion last year and $3.4 billion in 2023, down from $9.2 billion in 2022 and $15.4 billion in 2021, according to data from Avison Young. In 2021 and 2022, South Florida became a magnet for out-of-state residents, fueling\nunprecedented\ndemand from tenants and\nrecord\nrent hikes, but in the later years the market\nslowed\ndue to elevated interest rates and\nhefty new supply\n, which tempered tenant demand.\nLast month, FCP paid\n$90 million\nfor the 400-unit Arium Sunrise complex at 1501 Northwest 124th Terrace in Sunrise. That came on the heels of TA Realty buying the 300-unit Bell Pembroke Pines complex at 16700 Sheridan Street in Pembroke Pines for\n$118 million\n.",

        "content": "Douglas Elliman is celebrating its top-producing agents in New York City, who rose among the ranks of the firm as it waded through a turbulent 2024.\nThe brokerage on Wednesday announced the winners of its annual Ellie awards, recognizing brokers who earned the largest sales volumes and gross commission incomes, and closed the highest number of transactions last year.\nElliman\u2019s agents \u201cdidn\u2019t just have an outstanding 2024; they defined it,\u201d Richard Ferrari, the head of the company\u2019s brokerage, wrote in a statement. CEO Michael Liebowitz pointed to \u201ctheir expertise, entrepreneurial drive, and commitment to excellence\u201d\nAgents and teams with operations in the Big Apple racked up company-wide accolades this year, including the Eklund-Gomes Team, which once again snagged the Billion Dollar Club Award for exceeding $1 billion in sales. The cohort, led by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes, also nabbed the highest GCI among the firm\u2019s mega teams, followed by Noble Black &amp; Partners.\nIn Manhattan, Ann Cutbill Lenane was named the top agent by sales volume, transactions and GCI,\nadding a third honor\nto her spoils from the year prior. Lenane \u2014 who placed 26th in\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nlatest ranking\nof the city\u2019s top agents with $76 million in sell-side deals \u2014 was also the No. 4 agent by GCI for the entire company.\nFollowing Lenane in sales volume and GCI was Michelle Griffith, who led sales at the Reuben Brothers\u2019 Upper East Side hotel-condo conversion, alongside top broker Lauren Muss. The project, known as the Surrey, was a fixture atop\nweekly contract reports\nin the borough, scoring signed contracts for at least three units priced north of $20 million.\n\nThe Michael Lorber Team finished first in sales, transactions and commission income among Elliman\u2019s large teams in New York City. The group slid into the top spot after the 2024 winner, the Holly Parker Team,\njumped from Elliman\nto Compass earlier this year amid a\nwave of brokers\nexiting the firm over the last few months.\nLorber\u2019s team, which placed 11th in\nTRD\u2019s\nrankings with $103 million in sales, was also the third top-earning large team overall.\nAlso among the top teams highlighted in the awards was the Rubin Team, which was No. 1 in GCI and transactions among the firm\u2019s medium teams in Manhattan. The Lindsay Barton Barrett Team earned the most commission income, sales volume and transactions among the company\u2019s small teams.\nIn Brooklyn, the top-selling individual agent was Rebekah Carver, and the top-selling medium and small teams were the Scott Robles Team and The Bartolucci Team, respectively.\nElliman tapped its honorees following an end to the year rife with executive turnover. The firm\u2019s longtime CEO and chairman Howard Lorber abruptly retired in October under pressure from the board.\nThe head of the company\u2019s brokerage, Scott Durkin, was terminated just days after Lorber stepped down from his post. Chief operations officer Richard Lampen also exited the firm at the end of last year.\nElliman, Manhattan\u2019s third-largest brokerage by\nTRD\u2019s analysis\nof sales volume, closed 2024 with a\n$76 million loss\n, up from the $43 million lost the previous year. The brokerage has been in the red for more than two years, though it pushed its revenue above $1 billion last year.\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s real estate industry is pushing back against the anti-gentrification ordinance that took effect this month, with one group launching a letter-writing campaign against it.\nLandlords and brokers are frustrated with the right of first refusal granted to tenants in some Northwest Side neighborhoods, which allows tenants to band together to purchase their buildings ahead of any outside investor.\nThe Chicagoland Apartment Association and the Neighborhood Building Owner\u2019s Alliance said the right of first refusal will delay the sale of buildings, causing problems for owners who may need to sell quickly, and could have a cooling effect on investment in the area.\n\u201cThis ordinance punishes owners of affordable housing, devalues their property, and makes it harder to invest in neighborhood housing,\u201d said Mike Glasser, president of the Neighborhood Building Owner\u2019s Alliance, which launched a letter-writing campaign against the ordinance.\nGlasser\u2019s organization, an alliance of 11 landlord associations, put up a webpage with forms for contacting alderpeople, along with information about the ordinance.\nIt\u2019s also asking members to share personal stories of how the ordinance affected them if they are owners in the area. In addition to legislative tactics, the group is exploring ways to challenge the ordinance in court, according to comments made in an October conference call.\nThey are looking for examples of sellers being harmed by the requirement to give renters in larger buildings a 60-day notice of intent to sell and another 90 days to form a tenant association to decide if they want to buy the building. This timeline is shorter for buildings of four units or fewer, where the total timeline is 45 days.\nThe ordinance was crafted to address documented displacement and gentrification faced by residents in the communities covered by the ordinance, said Kelvin Gensollen Arellano, housing organizer with a community group called Palenque LSNA. The industry\u2019s arguments, on the other hand, are \u201chypothetical,\u201d he said.\nThe ordinance is a pilot program that will sunset at the end of 2029 unless renewed. The program applies to parts of Logan Square, Avondale, Hermosa, Humboldt Park and West Town as well as Pilsen. It is meant to stem exploding housing costs in areas that began gentrifying rapidly about 10 years ago, when developers started tearing down two- and three-flats and replacing them with luxury homes along the 606 trail. The area lost 6.1 percent of its two- to six-flat buildings between 2013 and 2018, according to the DePaul Institute for Housing Studies.\nIn response to the loss of smaller multifamily buildings, the ordinance also allows for the construction of two-flats by right in any areas within the ordinance\u2019s boundaries that are zoned for single-family. Finally, the measure increased demolition surcharges from $5,000 per unit or $15,000 per building to $20,000 per unit and $60,000 per building, whichever is higher.\n\u2018Unintended consequences\u2019 and \u2018trojan horse\u2019 arguments\nAndy Friedman, a multifamily broker with Kiser Group, said owners and developers will just find ways around portions of the ordinance designed to preserve existing affordable housing and protect against displacement, bringing \u201cunintended consequences\u201d to tenants and sellers.\nFor example, sellers will likely move to vacate buildings before selling as a way of skirting tenant rights, meaning less available housing in the area for that period of time, Friedman said.\nThe ordinance prohibits owners from displacing tenants after purchasing a building, requiring them to keep inherited tenants for 6 months or until the end of their lease, whichever is longer. That could pose a challenge for buyers looking to rehab a property and sellers may want to avoid the elongated timeline of granting tenants the right to first refusal. Vacating a property before bringing it to market may become a more attractive option, said Compass broker Mario Greco.\n\nThe increased demolition fees may hurt owners and sale prices in the area as buyers will take that cost off the top of any offers they make, Friedman said. Though he has not seen evidence of a drop in investment or average sale price yet, Friedman said the ordinance has \u201cdefinitely changed the attitude\u201d of developers toward the area.\nWith so much of the area\u2019s affordable housing already bought up by outside investors, Gensollen Arellano said most of the money from multifamily sales was not circulating or being reinvested in\u00a0 local communities anyway. Revenue from the surcharges will go to the Chicago Community Land Trust to support the \u201cconstruction, rehabilitation or preservation of affordable housing\u201d in the area, according to the ordinance. Developers who plan to reserve at least half of proposed units for families who earn up to 60 percent of the area\u2019s median income are exempt from the increased surcharges.\nThe Chicago City Council\namended the ordinance\nin response to concerns from the industry in December, adding the sunset date, delaying implementation of the right to first refusal until March 1 and requiring tenants to provide proof of financial backing to move forward in purchasing a building. The Chicagoland Apartment Association supported these amendments, but it would prefer for the council to overturn the measure altogether, said the organization\u2019s executive vice president Mike Mini. It\u2019s unlikely there is any political will to do so given strong support for the ordinance among aldermen, he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m certain that the evidence is going to show that this is not an effective ordinance, and perhaps then there\u2019ll be an opportunity to revisit this,\u201d Mini said. \u201cIf there\u2019s an opportunity to overturn it, we certainly would participate in that.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Palenque LSNA, which\nworked to get the ordinance passed last fall\n, has launched an education campaign of its own, canvassing Northwest Side neighborhoods to inform tenants about their rights.\n\u201cThis is the first step,\u201d Gensollen Arellano said. The second step has been talking with tenants about the kinds of \u201clegal, logistical and financial support\u201d they might need in order to execute their rights, so that Palenque and others can help bridge that gap, he said.\nBrokers who work in the area said they have yet to see an example of tenants organizing to match an offer from a third-party buyer to purchase their building, and Mini said he doubts the likelihood of it happening, particularly in larger buildings.\nThe timeline afforded to tenants to organize represents an unnecessary delay that will disadvantage small, live-in owners who may have more logistical and timing constraints around buying a property if they are taking out a mortgage, said NBOA member Joe Wilcox, a property manager and broker.\nThe ordinance states that 75 percent of occupied units should be in agreement in order for tenants to move forward with buying their building. That\u2019s more of a challenge in larger buildings, but Palenque LSNA is working to provide support to tenants on a case-by-case basis. Tenants can also opt to transfer their right of first refusal to a third-party organization that is committed to keeping the building affordable, Gensollen Arellano said.\nIndustry players\u2019 arguments that reforms will end up hurting renters or local, small-time landlords are often a \u201ctrojan horse\u201d for less community-minded concerns, he said.\n\u201cMost of the people who are purchasing these two-flats and three-flats are not families. Most of them are very big companies that are trying to resell them at a very big price and de-converting these units into luxury homes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a rational period of time to ask people to wait 30 days. It\u2019s not like the entire world will end during this period of time.\u201d\nBut Mini and others in the industry maintained that if the city really wanted to protect affordable housing in the area, they would remove restrictions on sellers, open up zoning and make it easier to increase the overall supply of housing.\n\u201cThe ordinances in the city of Chicago are such that it makes it very, very difficult to operate a rental property, and that puts upward pressure on rents. Costs are skyrocketing. Insurance is going up. Property taxes are high. Utility charges are high. It\u2019s difficult to get financing,\u201d Mini said. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of headwinds in the apartment industry right now, and until we change our policies to make it easier to build and maintain properties, we\u2019re going to continue to have this problem.\u201d\n",

It relies on Presidio profits and private donations,\nnot taxpayer money\n, according to a Trust report.\nThe White House didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment by the Standard.\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for President Trump to do what the state of California has failed to do,\u201d Charlene Nijmeh, chair of the tribe, said in a statement. \u201cNot only will returning the Presidio to Indigenous care be the right thing for our people and for the land, but it will also save the federal government \u2014 and taxpayers \u2014 money.\u201d\nThe tribe, working with the Lakota People\u2019s Law Project, has launched a\npetition\nseeking public support for the initiative.\n\nTribal officials said they submitted a right of first refusal to the federal government during the decommissioning of the military base in 1992, but faced opposition from prominent California politicians, including the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, both Democrats.\nIn the petition addressed to Trump and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe called the Presidio \u201ca beautiful national park on the tribe\u2019s traditional homelands in San Francisco.\u201d\nIt said the goal of the petition is to \u201crematriate\u201d the Presidio and \u201cestablish a new reservation\u201d there.\n\u201cRematriation,\u201d according to the Sogorea Te\u2019 Land Trust, is \u201cIndigenous woman-led work to restore sacred relationships between Indigenous people\u201d and \u201cancestral land.\u201d\nThe tribe said the \u201crightful return\u201d of the Presidio would be \u201can extraordinary act of reconciliation\u201d and that the Muwekma people maintain a \u201cdeep cultural and spiritual connection to the Presidio lands.\u201d\nThe Muwekma Ohlone Tribe claims on its\nwebsite\nthat it was once federally recognized as the Verona Band of Alameda County but was omitted from the Bureau of Indian Affairs\u2019 first official list of recognized tribes, drafted in 1978, according to the Standard.\nThe tribe has sought to reaffirm its federal status for more than 45 years. There are 614 members of the tribe, living mostly across the Bay Area, an unidentified spokesperson told the newspaper.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Construction is planned in six phases over 11 years, with work on the first phase beginning in June. A second phase is expected to launch in 2027. Qualico\u2019s business units include Sterling Homes and Pacesetter Homes, and it opened a McKinney office in 2018.\nThe 98-acre Erwin Farms, near North Country Lane and FM 1141, will include 123 lots, hiking and biking trails, and two multi-use sports courts. Prices are estimated to range between $750,000 and $1.2 million, with construction expected to span six years. The first residents could move in by mid-2028.\n\nThe developments underscore Rockwall County\u2019s rapid transformation. The county\u2019s population has increased 4 percent in the past year alone, surpassing 137,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Since 2020, it has grown an estimated 25 percent, making it one of Texas\u2019 fastest-growing counties, second only to neighboring Kaufman County.\nThe Dallas-Fort Worth home building market is experiencing significant growth, driven by strong demand and a robust development pipeline. The region is a leader in construction permits,\ntrailing only Houston\nnationally.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

        "content": "President Donald Trump said he wanted strings attached to billions of dollars in federal aid to\u00a0 Los Angeles County, where firestorms this year torched 16,000 homes and businesses.\nBut Republicans in Congress appear to have cooled on conditioning federal aid to California \u2014 which doesn\u2019t appear on the horizon months after the Jan. 7 fires in Altadena and the Pacific Palisades,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nLast month, Gov. Gavin Newsom requested\n$40 billion\nin disaster funding, but there\u2019s little movement on any aid.\n\u201cCongress must receive the formal disaster aid request from the administration,\u201d a spokesperson for House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, said in a statement to the Chronicle.\nThe White House declined to comment on when it might send Congress the request.\nTwo weeks after the fires, Trump\nthreatened to withhold federal aid\nfor the thousands of Los Angeles-area residents who lost their homes unless the state requires voter identification at the polls and opens the water spigot to Southern California.\nDisaster aid will likely get attention from Congress when lawmakers return from district work periods on March 24, Republicans Rep Ken Calvert from Palm Desert, and Rep. Doug LaMalfa from Chico, told the Chronicle.\nCalvert, the most senior California lawmaker and the only California Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, said he suspects there will need to be more than one vote on disaster aid, including one to provide additional funding to the\nFederal Emergency Management Agency\n.\n\n\u201cAt some point, we\u2019re going to have to put a little more money in FEMA, I think, because obviously the debris removal was extremely expensive,\u201d Calvert told the newspaper.\nMembers of Congress from California, including all nine Republicans, signed onto a\nMarch 7 letter\nurging congressional leadership to provide additional assistance to Los Angeles County.\n\u201cJust as the federal government has come to the aid of communities impacted by wildfires across the western United States, tornados in the Midwest, ice storms in Texas, or hurricanes in the Southeast, we should once again support the recovery of the impacted families, businesses, and communities in Los Angeles County,\u201d the lawmakers said.\nSeveral projections have estimated that insured losses from the January wildfires in L.A. County could reach $30 billion or more, making it the\ncostliest natural disaster in state history\n.\nSeveral California Republicans said they want to see a clearer accounting of existing liabilities to determine how much federal money is needed.\n\u201cFEMA is going through all the numbers and identifying what the costs are, and we\u2019re trying to determine the liability \u2014 who\u2019s liable,\u201d whether it\u2019s Southern California Edison, the insurance companies or other entities, Calvert told the Chronicle.\n\u201cRight now, California is hip-shooting a number. They don\u2019t have what amount is insured versus uninsured,\u201d and whether Southern California Edison will have responsibility for the Eaton Fire, added Republican Rep. Darrell Issa from Escondido. \u201cIf they have primary responsibility, that\u2019s a huge difference in the funding \u2014 literally billions of dollars. So we\u2019re prepared to offer a bill, but to put a number on it we do need these items done.\u201d\nIn January, several Republicans\nfloated the idea\nof making wildfire aid for California contingent on policy changes, an idea that drew a\nharsh rebuke\nfrom Anaheim Republican Rep. Young Kim.\n\u201cPlaying politics with people\u2019s livelihoods is unacceptable and a slap in the face to the Southern California wildfire victims and to our brave first responders,\u201d Kim said in a statement.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew",

It was built in 1901 but was renovated and partially reconstructed in 2010 after part of the building collapsed during a condo conversion.

There are also 18 indoor parking spaces on the property that Altitude will offer up with the condos when they go to market.\nAltitude plans to transform the units with finishes and floor plans designed to appeal to wealthy buyers looking to downsize with a Gold Coast home. The condos are set to hit the market in the middle of next year. Dohmen declined to specify price points for the units.\u00a0The building was previously a 50-room long-term-stay hotel called Dearborn Manor, a name that stuck around until at least the 1950s. Later, it was a 27-unit condo building.\n",

        "content": "A trio of Manhattan office buildings scored 10-figure CMBS deals in February, another sign of a post-pandemic recovery for trophy commercial properties.\nThe blockbuster refinancings come amid an overall surge in issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities. CMBS issuances totaled $18.3 billion nationwide last month, more than double January\u2019s total of $7.9 billion, according to KBRA. That\u2019s up 196 percent year-over-year, and the bond ratings association predicted \u201cno likely slowdown on the horizon.\u201d\nThe CMBS market is often considered a bellwether for the overall lending market and the broader commercial real estate market.\nIrvine Company\u2019s famed\nMetLife Building\nlanded the largest CMBS deal, a $1.5 billion loan issued by Bank of America and Wells Fargo.\nAnd Aby Rosen\u2019s RFR Holding got some good news for a change, scoring a $1.2 billion refinancing of the\nSeagram Building\n.\nIvanho\u00e9 Cambridge\u2019s trophy office tower,\n3 Bryant Park\n, grabbed another massive $1.1 billion CMBS loan.\n\u201cThe volumes have been fantastic,\u201d Trepp\u2019s Stephen Buschbom said of bond issuance on The TreppWire podcast. \u201cI\u2019m looking ahead at what\u2019s scheduled into April and we\u2019re just a stone\u2019s throw from hitting $35 billion.\u201d\nThe Real Deal\nbroke down February\u2019s five largest loans in Manhattan and the top five in the outer boroughs:\nNew life for MetLife | $1.5B | Midtown\nBank of America and Wells Fargo\noriginated a $1.5 billion CMBS loan for the Irvine Company\u2019s famed MetLife Building. The loan carries an interest rate of 6.25 percent over 10 years, a sizable jump from the 3.6 percent interest rate Donald Bren\u2019s firm previously faced. The debt-serving costs will double to approximately $100 million a year. The 58-story, 3 million-square-foot building is 94 percent occupied and generates $170 million in net operating income. Ownership, which included Tishman Speyer until it was bought out last year for an unknown price, has invested $180 million in the property dating back to the year before the pandemic.\nRosen refi | $1.2B | Midtown\nMorgan Stanley, Citi Real Estate Funding and JPMorgan Chase\noriginated a $1.2 billion CMBS loan to refinance RFR Holding\u2019s Seagram Building at 375 Park Avenue. The four-year, fixed-rate loan will carry a 6.25 percent interest rate, nearly double the 3.53 percent rate on the existing debt, according to Morningstar Credit. The refinancing package retires $1.15 billion in existing debt, utilizing $24.6 million from existing reserves to complete the payment. The loan structure will fund significant reserves, including a $26 million escrow for contractual free rent and $21.3 million for outstanding landlord obligations. Newmark recently appraised the 38-story, 860,000-square-foot property at more than $1.8 billion. The trophy office tower boasts a 96 percent occupancy rate.\nBryant Park boon | $1.1B | Midtown\nWells Fargo, Bank of America and Bank of Montreal\nprovided a $1.13 billion CMBS loan for Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge\u2019s trophy office tower, 3 Bryant Park. The loan for the 1.2-million-square-foot tower at 1095 Sixth Avenue \u2014 located between West 41st and 42nd streets \u2014 replaces a CMBS loan\nof the same amount.\nThe fresh financing is an encouraging sign for the Canadian investor, which has\nalmost $5 billion worth of loans\nset to mature in the next year. The real estate arm of Quebec\u2019s $300 billion pension fund tore through U.S. cities over the past decade, paying top dollar to buy top-tier properties.\n\nPark Avenue payday | $500M | Midtown\nCiti Group and JPMorgan\nprovided a $500 million loan to refinance Fisher Brothers\u2019\n299 Park Avenue\n. The fresh financing replaces a $325 million loan from a group of lenders. The landlord recently spent $20 million on a capital improvement project at the 42-story, 1.2 million-square-foot tower, which is 95 percent leased. Capital One and UBS combine to take up 30 percent of the rentable square footage in the building and are in place through 2031. Lease expirations are minimal for the next few years.\nWall Street windfall | $275M | Financial District\nApollo Global Management\nprovided a $275 million loan for\nRockpoint and Brooksville Company\u2019s\nresidential tower at 63-67 Wall Street. The two buildings are converted offices with more than 800 total units. The partners purchased the adjacent buildings from DTH Capital and Metro Loft Management in 2016 for $421.5 million, utilizing a\n$280 million loan\nfrom Wells Fargo. Since then, ownership has renovated the properties, upgrading common areas and amenity spaces.\nLogistics loot | $235M | Maspeth\nNew York Life Insurance Company\nprovided a $235 million loan for RXR Realty and LBA Logistics\u2019 vertical warehouse at\n55-15 Grand Avenue\nin Maspeth, Queens. The fresh financing replaces a $316 million loan from JPMorgan Chase.\u00a0 The partners\nspent $72 million in January 2018 on parcels\nfor the\nfive-story warehouse\nand\nAmazon agreed to lease the space\nfor its network of last-mile delivery warehouses.\nStorage swag\u00a0 | $143M | Long Island City\nBank of Montreal\nprovided a $143 million loan to Storage Deluxe for two industrial buildings on 21st and 22nd streets in Long Island City, Queens. The fresh financing replaces an $87 million CMBS loan. The properties at 41-45 21st Street and 41-54 22nd Street span a total of 277,601 square feet.\nRabsky refi | $140M | Fort Greene\nMadison Realty Capital\nprovided a $140 million loan for Rabsky Group\u2019s nearly-completed residential tower at\n240 Willoughby Street\n. The\nsecretive developer led by Simon Dushinsky\nis building a 30-story, 300-unit multifamily building near Fort Greene Park. It also plans to renovate an existing 21-story apartment project with 189 units. Rabsky secured a $72 million construction loan in 2022 from SCALE, the lending arm of Slate Property Group.\nFlatbush funds | $98M | Park Slope, Prospect Heights\nDerby Copeland Capital\nprovided a $98 million loan to Ed and Michael Ostad for their purchase of\na large portfolio of properties\nalong Flatbush Avenue. The Ostads bought the 26-building portfolio of mixed-use properties from Brooklyn\u2019s Pintchik family for $102.5 million.\nShelling out cash | $75M | Coney Island\nGoldman Sachs\nprovided a $74.8 million loan for Elie Fouerti\u2019s multifamily development at 2971 Shell Road in Coney Island. Fouerti Realty and Rybak Development wrapped up construction last year on the eight-story, 189-unit rental building, according to\nNew York YIMBY\n. The fresh financing replaced a $74.8 million construction loan from Popular Bank.",

Brokers in the Hamptons\njoined others\nin markets across the country tapped for accolades based on their sales volume, number of transactions and gross commission income in 2024.\nDouglas Elliman claimed the title of the top brokerage in the Hamptons in\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nlatest ranking\n. The brokerage closed nearly $1.5 billion in sales across more than 430 deals between June 2023 and June 2024.\n\u201cI am incredibly proud of this continued success,\u201d Tom Bourgard, head of Elliman\u2019s operations across Long Island, wrote in a statement.\nThomas Cavallo took home the prize for the most sales and commissions earned last year by an individual agent. Though the Sag Harbor-based broker didn\u2019t land the leading post in 2023, has\npreviously ranked\namong the firm\u2019s top producers in the region.\nSecond place went to Martha Gundersen, who was one of the three top finishers in the categories last year. Gundersen, alongside the No. 3 agent by GCI and sales volume Paul Brennan, was the listing agent for an East Hampton property that landed among the\ntop 10 most expensive\ndeals in the hamlet in 2024. The mansion at 253 Cove Hollow Road sold for $19.2 million.\n\nGundersen placed 17th among\nTRD\u2019s ranking\nof the top-producing agents and teams in the Hamptons between June 2023 and June 2024 with nearly $91 million in sales.\nKristy Naddell on the North Fork closed the highest number of transactions for the fourth consecutive year.\nThe Enzo Morabito Team scored the No. 1 spot by sales volume, transactions and GCI. The team also snagged fourth place in\nTRD\u2019s\nlatest ranking with roughly $150 million in sales across 46 deals.\nAlso notable among the teams honored in the Ellies was Noble Black &amp; Partners, who landed among the 10 groups with the largest sales volume last year. The cohort, which was the No. 2 megateam companywide, only officially\nexpanded to the Hamptons\nin May.\nOn the rest of Long Island, Maggie Keats was the top agent by GCI and sales volume, while Barbara Leogrande was the No. 1 in transactions. The Maria Babaev Team was the top-producing team by GCI and sales volume, with the Lina Lopes Team notching the highest number of transactions.\n",

        "content": "The New York mayoral race is very crowded, and newly released campaign filings show where real estate high-ups are placing their bets.\nAfter much speculation, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo\nlaunched\nhis campaign this month and quickly became the frontrunner. Despite the industry\u2019s complicated relationship with the politician, it was clear that many real estate professionals would back his campaign.\nDonations over the last two months\nbore that out\n.\nRXR Realty CEO Scott Rechler, a longtime supporter of Cuomo, gave Fix the City, a super PAC backing the former governor, $250,000. Rechler also donated $2,100 directly to Cuomo\u2019s campaign, the maximum amount permitted for an individual donor.\nLightstone executives gave the PAC $100,000, and A&amp;E\u2019s Douglas Eisenberg chipped in $125,000. Anthony Scarmucci\u2019s Skybridge Capital threw the PAC $100,000. Scarmucci and his wife also each gave $2,100 to Cuomo\u2019s campaign.\nOther industry donors to Cuomo\u2019s campaign include Cammeby\u2019s Avi Schron, KRE Group\u2019s Jonathan Kushner, Capstone Equities\u2019 Daniel Ghadamian, Ruben Companies\u2019 Andrew and Richard Ruben, Somerset\u2019s Keith Rubenstein, GFP\u2019s Jeff Gural and BFC Partners\u2019 Winthrop Wharton, each giving $2,100.\nNotably, some employees of New York-based title insurance companies also gave to Cuomo,\ndespite the state\u2019s attempts\nto reel in the industry\u2019s practice of wining and dining its clients during his time as governor.\nIn just two weeks, Cuomo raked in a total of $1.5 million, the most of any mayoral candidate (excluding public matching funds). Assembly member Zohran Mamdani raised the second-highest amount, taking in roughly $847,000 between Jan. 12 and March 13. Whitney Tilson received $310,000 during that time, and Comptroller Brad Lander raised nearly $228,000.\nAs for the others: Sen. Zellnor Myrie took in $136,000; Comptroller Scott Stringer, $188,000; Sen. Jessica Ramos, $70,000; and Republican Curtis Sliwa, $76,000 (which is also the total he has raised to date).\nCity Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, who recently jumped into the race and lost out on more than a month of fundraising during this filing period, managed to bring in $128,000 over a few days. Mayor Eric Adams took in a paltry $36,000 over the last two months, though he brushed off the totals raised by his rivals, telling reporters on Monday that \u201ceveryone is catching up to me,\u201d\nThe City reported\n.\nThe real estate industry, however, didn\u2019t just donate to Cuomo. Between Jan. 12 and March 13, real estate professionals, including veterans and lesser-known operators, contributed to Democratic mayoral candidates, with a few even throwing money to Sliwa.\nGeorgetown Companies\u2019 Adam Flatto, for example, gave $2,100 to former hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson in January. Flatto was joined by John Zeiler, founder and managing member of Hudson Housing Capital, who donated $1,000 to Tilson\u2019s campaign.\nTilson also drew $400 from GFP Real Estate co-CEO Brian Steinwurtzel and $250 from Cayre Group\u2019s Robert Cayre. Two Trees Managements\u2019 Jed Walentas, who also chairs the Real Estate Board of New York, gave $250 to Tilson, the same amount he donated to Cuomo\u2019s campaign. During the last filing period, Walentas contributed $400 to Sen. Zellnor Myrie.\n\nDespite being one of the top money-raising candidates, Assembly member Mamdani, a democratic socialist who has pledged to freeze rents for tenants living in stabilized apartments, didn\u2019t woo any large real estate donors. Instead, he received small donations, ranging from $5 to $100, from roughly a dozen residential and commercial brokers.\nCity Council Speaker Adrienne Adams officially launched her campaign a week after Cuomo, giving her the shortest time to raise funds. Even with the passage of the Fairness in Apartment Rental Expenses, or FARE Act, the Real Estate Board of New York showed Adams some support in her first fundraising haul.\nREBNY, through the PAC Taxpayers for an Affordable New York, gave Adams $2,100.\n\u201cAdrienne Adams has advanced a pro-growth agenda as Speaker, most notably in her support for City of Yes,\u201d REBNY President Jim Whelan said in a statement. He noted the passage of the broker fee bill, which requires landlords to pay the rental brokers they hire rather than forcing tenants to cover the cost, during her tenure was \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d but said she is an \u201cimportant voice to the Mayor\u2019s race.\u201d REBNY has\nfiled a lawsuit\nto repeal the law.\nSignature Urban Properties\u2019 Alan Miller gave Adams $400, as did Taconic Partners\u2019 Paul Pariser and Andy Zlotnick. GFP\u2019s Jeffrey Gural donated $250.\nEven if she doesn\u2019t win the primary in June, Adams will continue to serve as City Council Speaker through the end of the year, meaning that she has considerable sway over legislation and land use actions that come before her members.\nSen. Zellnor Myrie was the first of the mayoral candidates to roll out an extensive housing plan, which has earned him\nsome points with developers\n. Haussmann Development founder Josef Goodman gave Myrie $1,800. L+M Development Partners\u2019 Ron Moelis contributed $400, the same amount he donated to Cuomo\u2019s campaign.\nGilbert Winn of Boston-based Winn Companies gave Sen. Jessica Ramos $2,100 in January and then gave the same amount to Cuomo in March. Hudson Companies\u2019 Joe Riggs donated $150 to her campaign, the same amount he gave Comptroller Brad Lander in January.\nLander, meanwhile, received $2,100 from Millennium Partners Management\u2019s Philip Lovett. He also brought in donations from residential agents and nonprofit housing groups.\nBenjamin Companies\u2019 Kenneth Coyle contributed $2,100 to former Comptroller Scott Stringer, and Coldwell Banker kicked in $500.\nCory Zelnik of the commercial brokerage Zelnik &amp; Company gave Republican Curtis Sliwa $250. Marcus &amp; Millichap\u2019s Eric Anton donated $100.\nMayor Eric Adams, meanwhile, only took in a little more than $36,000 over the last two months, with a couple of donations from smaller real estate players. Once a favorite of the industry, some in real estate\nbacked off\ngiving to his campaign after he was\nindicted\nin September.\nThough many candidates have announced what they expect to receive in public matching funds based on this latest filing period, the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board will determine those amounts on April 15.\n",

        "content": "The city is gearing up for a rezoning that could bring 12,000 homes to Jamaica, Queens.\nWith nine months left of the first (and possibly last) term of the Adams administration, one neighborhood rezoning is on the cusp of being approved by the City Council, one just started public review and another is about to do the same on Thursday.\nCity Planning will certify the plan to rezone a swath of Jamaica to allow for the construction of more than 12,000 homes in the Queens neighborhood, of which 4,000 would be income-restricted through the city\u2019s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program. In fact, this would be the largest MIH area ever mapped, according to City Planning. The administration also projects that the rezoning could net 2 million square feet of commercial space.\nThe certification kickstarts the monthslong land use review process, known as the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure. The plan covers more than 300 blocks in and around Downtown Jamaica and will ultimately need buy-in from local Council members Nantasha Williams and James Gennaro, as well as City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, all of whose districts will be affected by the rezoning.\nHere\u2019s a quick recap of where the Adams administration\u2019s neighborhood rezonings stand:\n\u2014 The\nAtlantic Avenue rezoning\nis in the home stretch. On Wednesday, City Planning approved the plan, affecting a 21-block stretch in Central Brooklyn, which the city expects 4,600 new homes will be built. The plan now heads to the City Council.\n\u2014 In August, the City Council\napproved\nthe rezoning of 46 blocks in the Bronx, where a projected 7,000 homes are expected to be built over the next 10 years.\n\u2014\u00a0City Planning\nkicked off public review\nof the Midtown South rezoning in January, which would bring 9,700 units to the area.\n\u2014 The city released a draft for the planned Long Island City rezoning\nlast June\n, which could create 14,000 units.\nOf course the unit projections depend on developers having the appetite to build said units. Right now, the environment for ground-up development isn\u2019t, shall we say, great. Developers have bemoaned interest rates, high construction costs, the threat of tariffs and the wage requirements for projects looking to receive the property tax break 485x.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking abou\nt: What would it take for one of the mayoral candidates to overtake Andrew Cuomo as the presumptive frontrunner before the June primary? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nJamaica, Queens, is named after\u2026 beavers? The neighborhood is not named after the Caribbean island but is believed to instead derive from \u201cjameco,\u201d the Algonquin word for \u201cbeaver,\u201d\naccording to the New York Times\n.\n\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nA fourth person in New York has been diagnosed with measles, Gov. Kathy Hochul confirmed on Wednesday. About 81 percent of 2-year-olds in New York have received their first dose of the MMR vaccine, despite federal recommendations that children get the shot between 12 and 15 months old,\nGothamist reports\n. Three of the confirmed cases were in NYC, with one reported out of Suffolk County.\n\u2014\nIt is the end of an era. The MTA will stop selling MetroCards at the end of the year\n,\nthe New York Times reports\n.\n\u2014 Former First Deputy Mayor Maria-Torres Springer has a new gig,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. She is starting a fellowship at the Ford Foundation.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Wednesday was\n$6 million\nfor a 1,264-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at 685 Fifth Avenue in the Plaza District. McKenzie, Jade Mills and Alexander Boriskin of Douglas Elliman\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$68.5 million\nfor a 92,722-square-foot, 105-unit apartment building at 237 11th Street in Park Slope. Davidson Kempner sold the property to Living, N.Y.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$18.7 million\nfor a 3,851-square-foot condo at 33 East 74th Street in Lenox Hill. Kevin B. Brown and Craig George of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 60,702-square-foot, five-story school building at 1472 Boston Road in Crotona Park East. Matthew McChesney of KSS Architects filed the permit on behalf of Civic Builders.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "A Holmby Hills mansion tied to one of Los Angeles fashion\u2019s most prominent families is back on the market as it tries another price on for size.\nThe Azria Estate at 10250 West Sunset Boulevard, which has been\non and off the market\nfor the better part of a decade, once asked for as much as $88 million. It more recently reentered the Los Angeles real estate market with a $39 million asking price, after last being listed for $55 million in 2023.\nThe re-list comes after seller Lubov Azria, who owned the property with her late husband and BCBG founder Max Azria, placed the home on the auction block last May. Auctioneer Concierge Auctions estimated in the lead up to the sale the starting price could be as much as $38 million.\nLubov Azria did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday on the listing.\nA legal tussle arising after the auction\u2019s close has since stymied any movement on a sale of the property, which even\nJennifer Lopez\nhad been reportedly eyeing in the fall.\nRon Burkle\n, founder of private equity firm Yucaipa Companies, claimed in a Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit last June that his $30 million offer was the highest bid, but Azria \u201crefused to complete the sale except on additional terms.\u201d\nAaron Gordon, general counsel for Concierge Auctions, confirmed in a declaration filed in court Burkle had the winning bid but did not sign the sale agreement or pay the 12 percent escrow deposit within the two-business-day deadline. The tardiness caused Burkle to be in default.\n\nBurkle is now on the hook to pay a little over $36,000 for Azria\u2019s attorney fees and other lawsuit-related costs, a judge ordered in September. Three months later, Burkle filed to drop his lawsuit.\nWith the legal row out of the way, Azria will now try her hand once again at finding a buyer. She tapped The Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Branden Williams and Rayni Williams to market the property, which sits on a nearly 3-acre lot.\nThe agents did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday on the re-listing or the new price.\nThe Azria Estate counts a total of 60 rooms, including 14 bedrooms and 25 bathrooms.\nThe sizable property has been used to host Oscar parties, charity gatherings and other events.\nBuilt in 1939, the Paul Williams-designed Colonial consists of a main house and a separate 5,500-square-foot theater and game room. Outdoors is a tennis court, infinity pool, sauna, gardens, team room and greenhouse.\n",

        "content": "Four years after Los Angeles Council member Nithya Raman introduced a motion to clear out\nillegal, unregistered Airbnb and other short-term rental operations\n, the city may finally be cracking down.\nThe City Council unanimously voted Tuesday to explore how to increase enforcement of its home-sharing ordinance and residential hotel rules,\nCity News Service reported\n.\nThe council directed city departments to report on how much money and people they would need to take action.\nWhat\u2019s not clear is why it took four years for Los Angeles to consider addressing the problem.\nIn 2021, Raman, a Democrat, introduced a motion seeking to address problems with cracking down on illegal home sharing, which she said were \u201cdestabilizing\u201d neighborhoods. It was backed by fellow Democrats \u2014 Council member Bob Blumenfield and former Council members Mike Bonin, Paul Koretz and Kevin de Le\u00f3n.\nThe reason: illegal home-sharing had ushered in party houses, unauthorized events, and large yoga retreats, clothing boutiques and other commercial ventures, according to Raman. They\u00a0 also led to violent crime and homicides.\nIllegal home-sharing operations also buck up against legal brick-and-mortar businesses, allowing illegal advantages against tenants who rent commercial storefronts, from yoga studios to banquet halls.\nIllegal rentals \u201ctake your neighbors away and they remove affordable and protected rent-stabilized units from the long-term housing market, which is bad for L.A.,\u201d Raman stated in her motion.\nRaman said her constituents have been \u201cparticularly impacted.\u201d The Fourth District, which she represents, had the highest volume of both permitted and illegal home-sharing, putting a dent in its quality of life.\n\nSince the Home-Sharing Ordinance took effect in 2019\n, there have been problems with enforcement because of poor communication between departments and weak guardrails against bad landlords, Raman said.\nThe law regulates home-sharing through Airbnb, among other platforms.\n\u201cGood hosts go to extraordinary lengths to ensure they\u2019re in compliance with our laws,\u201d Raman said. \u201cWe should reward them and make sure that bad-faith hosts are treated with the appropriate enforcement actions.\u201d\nA property owner with a home of 2,500 to 5,000 square feet who has violated the ordinance would face a $3,000 penalty. Subsequent fines would be doubled.\nThe city may increase fines based on square footage of a rental in use during a violation.\nAmong the proposals to beef up enforcement is a public database for permit and citation information, making it easier to file complaints and submit evidence.\nThe Los Angeles Housing Department requested 18 new positions to help with investigations and issuing citations. As of October, about 300 administrative citations were referred to housing regulators, out of an estimated 7,500 home-sharing violators, according to a report.\nCity officials requested more staff to aid the City Attorney\u2019s Office with hearings and nuisance cases, which could lead to more revenue for enforcement.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

To move forward, approvals will be needed from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council.\n\nThe area has seen\nan influx of interest from developers and real estate investors\nahead of the presidential center\u2019s planned spring 2026 completion. It has also stoked fears of gentrification in the surrounding Woodlawn Neighborhood.\nNeighborhood leaders have proposed various anti-gentrification efforts in the area, including the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance. The ordinance established affordability requirements on all rental and for-sale housing developed on city-owned residential land and gave tenants the\nright of first refusal\nwhen a rental property is sold.\nThe right of first refusal is meant to prevent the area\u2019s naturally occurring affordable housing \u2014 particularly two- to four-flats \u2014 from being replaced with pricey residential developments. The provision requires landlords to notify tenants when they intend to sell and give them time to match the bid of a third-party buyer.\nChicago\u2019s hotel development pipeline has fallen to the lowest level in recent years as construction lending froze up, with fewer than 1,500 rooms under construction in the fourth quarter, CoStar\nreported\n.",

The city had 47.5 percent fewer office visits in February 2025, compared with the pre-Covid month of February 2019, while Chicago saw a 48.5 percent decline in the same time period.\nThe nationwide figure is off 36.3 percent, with top markets like New York and Miami only 17 percent and 20 percent behind their respective 2019 office visits. The figures are based on cell phone data from about 1,000 office buildings across the country, typically about 100 buildings per market, and do not include government properties for privacy and security reasons.\nChicago and San Francisco have been the bottom two markets for RTO while New York City and Miami have been at the top since the location analytics company began tracking office visit data in early 2021, according to R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai. The Windy City\u2019s freezing February and the commute-snarling construction on its roadways, along with tech employers pushing more days in office, may have finally lifted San Francisco out of last place, said Hottovy, who is based in Chicago.\n\u201cCongratulations San Francisco!\u201d Hottovy joked of the second-to-last victory. \u201cIt\u2019s been a horse race between these two markets for some time now.\u201d\nIn addition, while Placer.ai data shows that RTO appears to be stalling out in many cities, San Francisco is still improving. Nationwide, there was a 6.3 percent drop in office visits in February 2025 compared to February 2024, and only 3.5 percent of that drop can be attributed to last year\u2019s extra day for Leap Year. But San Francisco figures were only down 1 percent, the third-best in the nation after Miami and Boston, which were both at about half a percent below last year. Chicago office visits were down 8.2 percent in that same period.\n\u201cThere are green shoots everywhere in San Francisco, and these numbers are an early indication that we are moving in the right direction,\u201d Mayor Daniel Luire, who\nrecently set an April 28 deadline\nfor city workers to be in-office four days a week, told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cOur administration is leading by example, and many of our partners in the private sector are on the same page, bringing workers back to the office and kickstarting our downtown recovery.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco Chief Economist Ted Egan cautioned that Placer\u2019s office data \u201cshows a lot of volatility\u201d from month to month, and is just one indicator of RTO strength. But combined with other data points, like increased transit ridership and office demand, it adds up to \u201cgood news for the city\u2019s continuing economy recovery,\u201d he said.\nHottovy agreed that he\u2019d like to see a few more months of improved office visit data before he could call the RTO improvement a true trend, but that even this first month out of last place is \u201cencouraging.\u201d\nPopulation numbers have recently started to rise in the city, he said, and\ntech mandates on RTO\nwill continue to have a big impact as well.\n\u201cMaybe there\u2019s some hope,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe this is the first month of more pronounced recovery in terms of return to office, but it really is too soon to say.\u201d\nThere were 2.2 million square feet of office leased in San Francisco in the first quarter of 2025, according to early data from CBRE, slightly less than the fourth quarter of 2024 but 50 percent higher than the full first quarter of 2024. If San Francisco continues on this leasing trajectory, it will exceed the 8 million square feet leased in all of 2024, according to Colin Yasukochi, executive director of data for CBRE.\nThere were about 5 million square feet of office requirements in the first quarter, which is lower than previous quarters, but represents the highest level of company expansions since the pandemic at just over 20 percent of the total. Almost all of that growth demand is coming from the 30\nAI companies\nwhich are seeking a combined 1 million square feet of office space in the city, Yasukochi said.\nInvestors\ncertainly seem to be betting on San Francisco\u2019s recovery, according to Yardi data. San Francisco was the third-priciest market nationally, with office properties trading at $282 per square foot in the first two months of the year, compared with $177 per square foot nationally and $67 per square foot in Chicago.\n",
