        "content": "A Marriott-branded hotel on downtown Long Beach\u2019s Ocean Boulevard traded hands for about half its prior price tag.\nThe Westin, at 333 East Ocean Boulevard and near the water, sold for about $42 million, according to records dated late last month,\ncompared to\nits sale price of $85 million nine years ago. Rockpoint and Highgate sold the 469-room hotel in the heart of the city\u2019s downtown to Khanna Enterprises, which received a $39 million note for the deal.\nThat trade comes out to less than $100,000 per key for the high-rise hotel. Los Angeles\u2019\nhotel world\nis in a rut, but that\u2019s still a very low per-key price that may have more to do with an upcoming cost the seller was on the hook for: a property improvement plan. That is basically an action plan designed to bring an individual hotel into compliance with the latest brand standards. An informed industry source said the property improvement plan was around $25 million.\nAnd things were already costly. The sellers completed a $23 million renovation of the hotel with a curved, modern facade, surrounded by palm trees, where a fountain sits at its entrance, two years after purchasing it. In 2024, the Long Beach hotel\u2019s unionized workers went on strike and later negotiated a new contract and a wage increase.\nLast year, Los Angeles\u2019 priciest per-key\ndeal\nwas in Malibu (it was one of California\u2019s priciest per-key deals ever, too). Luxury fashion brand Chrome Hearts, owned by Richard and Laurie Stark, purchased the luxe oceanfront Surfrider for $37.5 million from Dauntless Capital Partners. That deal came out to almost $2 million a room, but its pricing was an exception. Still, a West Hollywood hotel\ndeal\nthat had a per-key price reflective of the current market commanded more than the Long Beach trade, at $333,000 per room.\nRepresentatives for Khanna Enterprises, Rockpoint and Highgate did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOrange County-based and family-owned Khanna Enterprises has made discounted buys before. In 2022, it\npurchased\na Westin in San Jose for about $45 million, or 30 percent less than what the property commanded in 2017. Major players Rockpoint and Highgate have previously partnered on deals via joint ventures.\n",

        "content": "A long-vacant State Street landmark in Chicago could soon be fostering more than nostalgia.\nThe eight-story former department store at 401 South State Street \u2014 a hulking 485,000-square-foot building steps from the Harold Washington Library \u2014 is being pitched as an urban farming and food innovation hub. CoStar\nreported\nthat local investor Marc Calabria, who bought the property out of distress for\n$4.2 million last year\n, is teaming up with vertical farming firm Farm Zero to transform the space into what they describe as a first-of-its-kind controlled-environment agriculture campus.\nThe plan would carve the\nhistoric structure\ninto layers of vertical farming racks, research labs and startup space, alongside a public-facing produce market, restaurants and a rooftop outfitted with greenhouses, solar panels and outdoor dining. Calabria said he also intends to convert a portion of the building into student or senior housing, running parallel to the agriculture project as financing comes together. Total redevelopment costs have not been disclosed.\nFarm Zero\nhas already been testing its model in the Loop, growing leafy greens and herbs inside office towers at 30 North LaSalle Street and preparing to expand at 125 South Wacker Drive. The outlet reported that the State Street building would mark a leap from proof of concept to ecosystem, merging food production with health research and entrepreneurship under one roof.\nThe venture is expected to involve the Institute for Food Safety and Health, a partnership between Illinois Institute of Technology and the Food and Drug Administration, as well as Netherlands-based urban\nagriculture experts\n. The goal is to turn underused commercial real estate into local food infrastructure, with an emphasis on \u201cfood as medicine\u201d initiatives that tie fresh produce to chronic disease prevention and treatment, according to the publication.\nThe proposal adds a twist to the office-to-anything trend reshaping downtowns nationwide. While many distressed buildings are being eyed for apartments or data centers, Calabria\u2019s concept hinges on agriculture as adaptive reuse.\nThe building itself carries architectural heft. Designed by William Le Baron Jenney and completed in 1891, it is both a national and Chicago landmark, having housed Siegel, Cooper &amp; Company and later Sears before becoming an academic facility. Its prior $68 million valuation evaporated after tenant Robert Morris University vacated in 2020. Calabria\u2019s fall 2025 purchase equated to $9 per square foot.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "San Antonio\u2019s homebuilding machine is still running \u2014 just at a lower hum.\nHomebuilders pulled nearly 3,885 residential permits in the city last year, the lowest annual total in five years and a steep 38 percent drop from the 6,271 permits filed in 2021, when rock-bottom interest rates and pandemic migration fueled a buying frenzy, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n. Higher borrowing costs, policy uncertainty and homeowners clinging to sub-3 percent mortgages have cooled demand and throttled new construction.\nBut while overall\nvolume\nis down, market share is consolidating.\nThe top four homebuilders accounted for more than half of all permits issued in San Antonio last year. Lennar alone pulled 1,246 permits \u2014 or almost 33 percent of the citywide total \u2014 cementing its lead in the\nAlamo City\n. The\nMiami-based builder\nhas topped the local rankings since 2023, when it nudged past D.R. Horton in new home starts, according to Zonda.\nD.R. Horton, long a heavyweight in Texas, slipped to third place by permits filed, with 196. Los Angeles-based KB Home claimed the No. 2 spot with 394 permits.\n\u201cSan Antonio is already highly concentrated,\u201d Zonda Advisory principal Bryan Glasshagel told the publication in January. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine Lennar or D.R. Horton grabbing much more share than they already have.\u201d\nEven in a slower cycle, San Antonio\u2019s fundamentals are keeping national builders engaged. Compared to other major metros, land remains relatively affordable and the permitting process comparatively streamlined, allowing builders to deliver lower-priced units more quickly.\nGeography tells the bigger story, as about 45 percent of last year\u2019s permits were issued on the city\u2019s South Side, particularly around Texas A&amp;M University \u2013 San Antonio, Von Ormy and Mitchell Lake. Once overlooked, the area has become a development darling thanks to cheaper land, public incentives and a wave of institutional investment.\nToyota has continued to expand its manufacturing space there, and British equipment maker JCB is relocating its North American headquarters to the area as well. Master-planned projects like\nSouthstar\u2019s\n600-acre VIDA community are rising alongside campus growth and infrastructure upgrades.\nThe West and Far West sides also captured more than 600 permits combined, buoyed by retail expansion and attainable lot prices.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Compass agent Kyle Blackmon just made a pretty penny off his company\u2019s stock.\nBut it wasn\u2019t for selling high or buying low. The veteran New York City luxury broker was awarded $5.5 million by a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) arbitration panel in a complaint he brought against UBS Financial Services over how it handled his Compass stock options and shares.\nIn January 2025, Blackmon brought a complaint to FINRA, which regulates the financial brokerage industry, accusing UBS of mishandling his unexercised stock options around Compass\u2019 initial public offering.\nCompass went public in 2021 with a share price around $20, but watched its stock fall to as low as $2 as interest rates spiked and the housing market cratered in the coming years. Its price has since rebounded as the brokerage\u2019s growth has continued to outpace the housing market and Compass has delivered cash-flow positive quarters in recent years.\nThe recommendations at issue involved \u201cvery complex\u201d trading strategies, a person familiar with Blackmon\u2019s claim told\nAdvisorHub\n. Blackmon claimed that UBS breached its fiduciary duty and violated an SEC rule governing how broker-dealers advise their clients, according to the arbitration award published by FINRA.\nThe hearings lasted over nine days starting on Jan. 26 and took place before a two-person panel in Boca Raton, Florida. Blackmon is registered in both New York and Florida.\nBlackmon did not respond to a request for comment. An attorney for UBS did not respond to a request for comment.\nBlackmon\nmade waves\nin the industry when he joined the fledgling Compass \u2014 then Urban Compass \u2014 in 2014. He had previously spent more than a decade at Brown Harris Stevens, where he made a name for himself when he sold former Citigroup chairman Sanford Weill\u2019s penthouse apartment at 15 Central Park West for\n$88 million\n, a record price in the city at the time.\nAt Compass, Blackmon, who has been described as a prototypical Southern gentleman, has continued to be a steady producer. He ranked 26th in\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s top agent rankings by deal volume in 2019.\nHis clients have included the former CEO of NBCUniversal, whose co-op Blackmon sold this week for\n$15 million\n, to Rupert Murdoch, whose Flatiron penthouse Blackmon sold for\n$24 million\nin 2024.\n",

Colloredo-Mansfeld, was founded in 1986 and has invested over $17 billion in logistics properties, according to its website.\nThis purchase brought its South Florida shopping spree to 1.3 million square feet of industrial space. The firm also bought the two-building McCoy Logistics Center in Orlando, according to a Cabot news release. It also bought an industrial building at 2850 Ranch House Road, south of Palm Beach International Airport, the release says.\nIn Cabot\u2019s other South Florida deals, it sold the 231,000-square-foot warehouse at 3425 Meridian Parkway in Weston for\n$56 million\nin September, marking the\neighth\n-largest industrial deal in South Florida last year.

The drop in vacancy is partly due to a construction slowdown.\nOverall asking rents reached $16 per square foot, triple net, higher than the $15.83 a foot in the third quarter and $15.90 in the fourth quarter of last year, according to Colliers.

        "content": "The extent to which landlords across Los Angeles took advantage of the wildfire tragedy last year is the subject of a report attempting to quantify the narrative.\nWhen the blazes displaced thousands of residents in and around Pacific Palisades and Altadena,\nlandlords hiked up rental prices\nacross Los Angeles County despite calls from officials to crack down on price going, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n, citing data from Rent Brigade.\nThe tenant advocacy group analyzed Zillow listings in the year after the fires and found 18,360 potential instances of rent hikes exceeding 10 percent, potentially violating the anti-gouging rules signed by\nGov. Gavin Newsom\non Jan. 7, 2025, the day the fires broke out.\nCity and state authorities have filed only 12 lawsuits so far, even though officials vowed widespread enforcement. The legislation is in effect until Feb. 27.\nA Beverly Grove condo\u2019s listing price was hiked from $5,000 to $8,000 per month in the week after the fire, in one example. A property in Venice listed for 60 percent above its previous price, while the advertised rent price for a home in Santa Monica increased more than 100 percent.\n\u201cI was shocked by how many clear, unavoidable cases of price gouging there were,\u201d Philip Meyer, a co-author of the Rent Brigade report, told the outlet. \u201cA lot of folks didn\u2019t seem to think there\u2019d be any accountability, so they were breaking the law in plain view.\u201d\nOf the \u201cillegal listings,\u201d 42 percent were in L.A. County\u2019s Third District, which includes Pacific Palisades, as well as surrounding communities where many fire victims tried to relocate such as\nMalibu\n, Santa Monica, Venice and Calabasas.\nThe report claims that as much as $49 million in excess rent may have been collected over the past year. The actual number is likely much lower because the $49 million figure assumes that all 18,360 listings ended up being rented at the advertised price. The number of \u201cillegal listings\u201d could also be slightly lower as Zillow listings don\u2019t provide information on actual leases signed.\nL.A. County raised the price-gouging penalty to $50,000 from $10,000 a year ago, and the L.A. City Council increased the maximum penalty to $30,000. In July, the L.A. County Board of Supervisors allowed the Department of Consumer and Business Affairs to bypass the district attorney and directly fine price gougers, making it easier to go after landlords breaking the law.\nThe California Department of Justice\u2019s Disaster Relief Task Force, sent 753 warning letters to hotels and landlords who were accused of price gouging. State Attorney General Rob Bonta\u2019s office has filed five price-gouging lawsuits against individual landlords. L.A. City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto\u2019s office\nhas filed seven price-gouging lawsuits\nagainst individual landlords as well as housing companies like Blueground and Airbnb. L.A. County District Attorney Nathan Hochman hasn\u2019t prosecuted a single price-gouging case, acknowledging the work of city and state legal officials.\nAll 12 cases are currently pending or awaiting trial.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Rent price changes in San Francisco and Los Angeles over the past year tell a tale of two very different cities.\nSan Francisco rents in January were up 13 percent from a year before, while the median rent in Los Angeles fell 1.8 percent during the same period, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n, citing new data from Apartment List. San Francisco saw the highest rate since late 2019, while Los Angeles had the lowest rate since 2021.\nSupply is believed to be one of the biggest contributors to the gap between the two cities.\n\u201cSan Francisco has had a declining multifamily construction pipeline since 2018, whereas L.A. remained elevated through 2022,\u201d Rob Warnock, lead economic researcher at Apartment List, told the Chronicle.\nLast year, 15,095 multifamily units were completed in the Los Angeles area, marking an 18 percent increase from the year before, per CoStar data cited by the Chronicle. In San Francisco,\nhousing completions declined sharply\nafter the pandemic, with 2024 seeing the lowest number of finished projects in a decade with 1,597. The years of \u201cstrong production\u201d in Los Angeles \u201care paying dividends today by providing more apartments to absorb demand longer,\u201d Warnock said.\nWith the market flush with new supply, the vacancy rate in Los Angeles rose to a four-year high in January of 6.1 percent. San Francisco\u2019s was down to 3.3 percent, below the 4 percent registered in 2019.\nThe influx of artificial intelligence companies to San Francisco and growth of current tenants like OpenAI and\nAnthropic\nare expected to drive up demand for residences in the city and across the Bay Area in the coming years.\nPrices are\nalready following suit\nin San Francisco as\nheightened demand meets diminished supply\n. In the 94158 zip code that includes OpenAI and Nvidia\u2019s homes in Mission Bay, rents have increased 36 percent over the past year, while the surrounding 94107 zip code including South of Market, Potrero Hill and Dogpatch are up 21 percent. \u201cDemand is skyrocketing thanks to the AI industry,\u201d Warnock said.\nLast year,\nCBRE predicted\nthat AI companies\u2019 expansion could bring up to 60,000 new jobs to San Francisco, but job numbers in both San Francisco and Los Angeles tell a different story. Los Angeles County lost a net 6,700 jobs between December 2024 and December 2025, while San Francisco and San Mateo County together lost a net 4,400 jobs during that time, including 4,500 job losses in the tech-heavy information sector.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Cook County is barreling toward a tax sale it may not legally be able to afford.\nUnless Springfield lawmakers act within days, the county\u2019s annual auction of delinquent property tax debts will move forward in March, potentially compounding what housing advocates and legal experts say is a mounting constitutional liability. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat the urgency stems from the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2023 decision in Tyler v. Hennepin County, which found that governments violate the Fifth Amendment when they seize and sell a property over\nunpaid taxes\nand keep the excess equity.\nIllinois has yet to overhaul its tax sale system to comply.\nThat leaves Cook County Treasurer\nMaria Pappas\nin a bind. Without legislative authorization to delay again, she may have to proceed with a sale that could include as many as 40,000 properties with unpaid 2023 taxes. Each certificate sold could add another potential claimant if courts ultimately require counties to return surplus equity to dispossessed owners.\n\u201cEvery tax certificate an Illinois county sells is going to add to the county\u2019s potential liability,\u201d Bob Palmer, policy director of Housing Action Illinois, told the outlet. Matt Kreis, general counsel for the Center for Community Progress, echoed that concern, warning additional March sales could deepen financial exposure down the line.\nThe sale was already pushed from its traditional August date to March 25, 2026, after lawmakers signaled a fix was imminent. That fix never came. By law, owners must be notified 30 days before the auction, meaning notices would need to go out by late February \u2014 or sooner, given the logistics of printing and mailing tens of thousands of certified letters and placing legal ads.\nFOIA documents obtained by the publication show the March sale would cost roughly $190,000 in upfront expenses for printing and publication alone. Meanwhile,\nfederal judges\nin two Illinois districts have\ndeclined to shield\ncounties from liability, though no court has yet determined how past victims of so-called equity theft should be compensated.\nOther Illinois counties are improvising. Rock Island and White counties required tax buyers to sign waivers acknowledging they \u2014 not the county \u2014 would bear responsibility for excess equity claims. Participation held steady and bidding ticked up slightly, suggesting investors may pivot toward interest earnings rather than windfalls from forfeited equity, according to the outlet.\nIn Springfield, Sen. Celina Villanueva introduced legislation that would require counties to return surplus proceeds after taxes are paid. But with the notification deadline days away, Cook County may be forced to proceed under a system the Supreme Court has already called unconstitutional, and hope the bill comes through before lawsuits do.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Washington, D.C.-based Carlyle assembled the properties over time as part of a broader push into outer-borough storage.\nEastdil Secured brokered the sale, which is the biggest trade in the sector since StorageMart\u2019s $3.2 billion purchase of 18 New York facilities from Edison Properties at the end of 2021, per REA.\nStorageMart will rebrand the newly acquired properties, located in Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan and Staten Island, under its Manhattan Mini Storage banner, according to a press release.\nThe facilities are relatively new, with an average age of four years, and in-place rents average $35.60 per square foot, per REA. Marketing materials suggested that improved management, stronger leasing and the burn-off of concessions could allow a new owner to triple net operating income within four years.\nEastdil declined to comment.

An investor named Jho Low began buying trophy real estate in Manhattan with the money, though he later surrendered approximately $700 million in assets to the Department of Justice without admitting guilt. \u201cIf Low was 1MDB\u2019s architect, Leissner was its engineer,\u201d one source told the Post.\nLeissner pleaded guilty in 2018 and reported to federal prison this month.

The site is currently home to Big 5 Sporting Goods and a car wash.\nThe location is one of two places at South Shore Center where Merlone Geier is looking to erect housing. Together, the two proposed developments could total 800 units. The project is still in its early stages and the company has yet to file an official development application with the city, Merlone Geier managing director Jamas Gwilliam told the Business Times.\nAs part of\nAlameda\n\u2019s state-mandated housing element, the city identified the Big 5 site and another parcel at the shopping center home to\nOfficeMax\nand Southshore Cafe as possible residential development sites to meet its goals. Merlone Geier is also eyeing the OfficeMax site for housing. Total units and building sizes for both locations are yet to be determined, though the firm is targeting roughly 400 units on each parcel, Gwilliam said. That would align with Alameda\u2019s desire to build approximately 800 units at South Shore Center as part of its housing element. If Merlone Geier does move forward with housing at the shopping center, the firm would be required to include some affordable units.\nIt\u2019s not the first time a developer has floated building housing at South Shore Center. In 2019, Atlanta-based Jamestown, which owned the mall before selling it to Merlone Geier in 2020 for an undisclosed price,\nproposed a 1,200-unit housing development\n.\nMerlone Geier is no stranger to building\nresidential developments at retail centers\n. The San Francisco-based firm is currently redeveloping the Northgate Mall in San Rafael into a mixed-use hub with more than 1,400 residences, making it the largest-ever housing development in Marin County.\nUnder its\nhousing element\n, Alameda must plan for 5,353 new homes by 2031.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

While\nPark Cities mansions\nare unlikely to slip off the state\u2019s ultra-luxury throne anytime soon,\nluxury estates\nand\nequestrian farms\ngenerate demand as well.

        "content": "Rental vouchers are one of the few things on which tenants and landlords agree. Mayor Zohran Mamdani, not so much. And it cost him some bad press.\n\u201cMamdani Reverses Campaign Promise to Expand Rental Assistance\u201d is the kind of\nNew York Times headline\nthat feels like a gut punch to a mayor.\nGothamist had the story\ntwo weeks ago, but its headline was tame (\u201cMamdani delays expansion of NYC housing aid program amid fiscal strain\u201d).\nThe ostensible reason for the decision is that Mamdani has to close a $7 billion budget gap, and can\u2019t add spending to a CityFHEPS program that has already ballooned from $176 million in fiscal 2019 to\n$1.2 billion\nlast year.\nBut one political consultant said there\u2019s probably more to it.\n\u201cThe enormous fiscal aspect is of course a factor in the new mayor\u2019s shift here, but I suspect there\u2019s a deeper underlying ideological reason,\u201d the source emailed me. \u201cThe mayor and\nCea Weaver\nand the like have a default setting of being suspicious and not supportive of any program that addresses affordable housing instability and homelessness through paying landlords.\u201d\nEdited version: \u201cThe mayor and Cea Weaver don\u2019t like paying landlords.\u201d\nIn any case, they can\u2019t pay landlords with money they don\u2019t have. Remember, they cannot raise income taxes. Only the state can. And that is not going to happen this year with Gov. Kathy Hochul facing a Republican challenger.\nBut tax revenue continues to grow even without an increase in rates. Will Mamdani eventually expand CityFHEPS to comply with the law passed by the last City Council? That\u2019s iffy at best.\nRather than fight the City Council\u2019s lawsuit demanding full funding for the expansion, Mamdani is trying to negotiate a settlement with the City Council and the Legal Aid Society.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the money involved, it\u2019s the mechanism and who gets paid,\u201d the source said. \u201cMy thinking is that City Hall has other plans for this crisis. Anything they do in this space is not going to include rent payments.\u201d\nThe Adams administration claimed the CityFHEPS expansion law could cost $17 billion over five years. The City Council insisted it would be less, but would be worth it regardless \u2014 in part because vouchers are cheaper than shelter beds.\nLost in this debate is an inconvenient truth: Rental vouchers don\u2019t create housing. They do the opposite: They increase competition for the available supply. That pushes rents up.\nHomelessness is not just about poverty or mental illness. Many cities have poverty rates like New York\u2019s, but little homelessness because housing is available and inexpensive. Here, the vacancy rate for voucher-eligible units is about 1 percent.\nA family in a shelter or crashing at a relative\u2019s house will take its voucher and go apartment-hunting. The city should ensure it\u2019s building enough homes to offset that increased demand.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nMichael Powell has been a New York City journalist for decades, but in the 1980s he was a tenant organizer in East Flatbush. That gave him a fascinating perspective to write about the struggles of renters and owners of rent-stabilized buildings \u2014 a perspective, he notes, that Mamdani lacks. Powell posted a\nfree link\nto his article. Send your thoughts on it to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Many readers emailed me to say NYCHA\u2019s\n$54,000-per-apartment\ncost to install heat pumps was too high. But one real estate source, whose co-op spent $70,000 per unit to add heat pumps, thought it was too low. NYCHA told me the $38.4 million project included electrical upgrades, window work, radiator removal and more to accommodate 2,137 heat pumps in 712 units, as well as new hot water systems. Alternatives to cure the development\u2019s heating problems would have cost as much or more, a spokesperson said.\nElsewhere\u2026\nThe mayor\u2019s new chief technology officer, computer scientist Lisa Gelobter, led the team that developed the animation technology used to create GIFs. She was also on the Hulu launch team.\nWith\nthose credentials\n, she ought to be able to bring technology to the antiquated, cumbersome HPD violations process.\nI have been gathering anecdotes and opinions on housing violations for a future column. From my discussions with landlords, the process is riddled with inefficiencies \u2014 and more than a little dishonesty.\nGelobter and her team could start by introducing technology to make it easier to clear violations after repairs are made.\nCoordinating city inspectors\u2019 follow-up visits with tenants is a full-time job for some property management employees. Even when they manage to get everyone on the same page, the inspector or the tenant sometimes misses the appointment, and it can be weeks or even months before the stars align again.\nOne landlord suggested that a superintendent could record and upload a video showing the completed repair, with the tenant validating that it was done. An HPD staffer could then clear the violation without ever leaving her desk.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$16.4 million\nfor a 4,962-square-foot, sponsor sale condominium unit at 211 West 84th Street on the Upper West Side. Alexa Lambert, Alison Black and Elizabeth Goss of Compass had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$5.9 million\nfor a bulk sale of sponsor-sale condominium units, storage spaces and parking spots by the Permanent Mission of Canada to the United Nations.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$9.7 million\nfor a 4,592-square-foot, 25-foot-wide townhouse at 37 Garden Place in Brooklyn Heights. Jennifer H. Cooke of Brown Harris Stevens has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permits filed were for a combined project at 680 and 690 East Fordham Road in Belmont. It would be 190 units and 116,822 square feet. Nikolai Katz filed the permit on behalf of Hen Vaknin of Bridge Asset Management.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Oak Brook is poised to trade cubicles for shopping carts.\nA developer submitted plans to raze seven aging office buildings along Butterfield Road in the\nvillage\nwest of Chicago and replace them with a 225,000-square-foot Amazon retail store and a 150,000-square-foot, two-story Ashley Furniture flagship. The Chicago Tribune\nreported\nthat the 22-acre site at 2805-2907 Butterfield Road sits along I-88 and marks the latest push to reinvent the village\u2019s struggling office corridor as a retail hub.\nVillage President Larry Herman told the outlet that the Amazon store would be about 40 percent larger than the nearby Costco and would function strictly as a retail operation \u2014 not a distribution warehouse. Amazon is also planning a similar large-format store in Orland Park as it experiments with brick-and-mortar concepts.\nAs part of the deal, the developer would fund a new traffic signal and dedicate land for future westbound I-88 access ramps at Meyers Road, aimed at easing congestion and unlocking further development.\nThe proposal heads next to the Planning and Zoning Commission for a public hearing before returning to the Village Board for final approval. If greenlit, demolition could begin later this year, with construction stretching through 2027.\nOak Brook\ndoes not levy a municipal property tax, meaning sales tax revenue is the village\u2019s primary funding source, and officials expect the\ntwo anchor stores\nto generate several million dollars annually while drawing additional retailers to the Butterfield corridor.\nHerman framed the project as a strategic response to long-term suburban office distress. Several of the seven buildings slated for demolition have been repossessed by lenders, and he said many properties along the\ncorridor\nare unlikely to rebound.\nThe move would also create retail continuity between Oakbrook Center and Yorktown Mall, reinforcing the village\u2019s position as a regional shopping and dining destination, according to the publication. Costco, which recently began a multimillion-dollar expansion, isn\u2019t expected to suffer from the new competition, Herman said, arguing the membership warehouse and Amazon operate on distinct merchandising models.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The developer who helped turn the Fort Worth Stockyards into a tourism juggernaut is setting his sights on a historic jail just off Georgetown\u2019s Square.\nFort Worth-based Delightful Development, co-founded last year by Craig Cavileer, won approval from the Williamson County Commissioners Court on Tuesday to acquire roughly 2 acres downtown that includes the former Williamson County Jail and adjacent land at 300 South Main Street in Georgetown. The Austin Business Journal\nreported\nthat the county did not disclose the sale price.\nThe hulking limestone structure, built in the late 1800s, has been on the market for at least six months.\nCavileer\ntold county officials he spotted the for-sale sign on a Sunday about four months ago and called that day to make an offer.\nWhile plans are still fluid, Cavileer signaled a hospitality heavy vision for the site, potentially blending hotel rooms, restaurant space and other mixed uses.\n\u201cHospitality is in our blood,\u201d he said during the meeting, adding that the historic jail\u2019s\ncharacter\n\u2014 not just the dirt beneath it \u2014 drove the deal.\nCavileer was previously the public face of the redevelopment of the 70-acre Fort Worth Stockyards, a project led by Los Angeles-based Majestic Realty Company that repositioned the district as a retail, dining and entertainment anchor. He departed that venture last year amid a\nlegal dispute\nand launched Delightful Development, which has since surfaced on other projects, including in Florida.\nThe\nGeorgetown\nacquisition would mark a significant adaptive reuse of historic property in one of Central Texas\u2019 fastest-growing cities according to the publication. Georgetown, about 30 miles north of Austin, recently surpassed 100,000 residents and has attracted a wave of corporate investment, including manufacturers and industry groups setting up operations in the region.\nCounty leaders framed the sale as both preservation and opportunity, the outlet reported. Commissioners expressed relief that the building would not be demolished and praised Cavileer\u2019s track record with historic properties.\nThe site\u2019s proximity to the Square \u2014 the cultural and commercial heart of\nGeorgetown\n\u2014 could deepen tourism traffic and extend visitor stays, especially as the city continues to market itself as a Hill Country destination with urban amenities.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "After years in limbo, a troubled state-owned building is changing hands and getting a makeover.\nGov. Kathy Hochul on Friday announced that a nonprofit partnership made up of the Fifth Avenue Committee, Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation and One Brooklyn Health will take over 1024 Fulton Street, a three-story building in Clinton Hill that has sat vacant since the \u201990s.\nThe state will demolish the building to make way for 125 rental units, which will be affordable to those earning between 30 percent and 80 percent of the area median income. The project will also include 27,000 square feet of community center space operated by Fort Greene Council, and a 1,000-square-foot health clinic.\nApex Building Group and Henge Development will handle general contracting and project management. Their financial involvement in the project will be limited to collecting a portion of the developer fee.\nThe $111 million project is expected to be almost entirely financed through low-income tax credits, tax-exempt bonds and public capital subsidy, according to a representative from the governor\u2019s office.\nThe state\u2019s Office of Children and Family Services bought the property in 1997, hoping to develop a community center, but \u201cstructural issues\u201d stood in the way.\nThe building, which was once a showroom for Brooklyn Union Gas, has since sat vacant. The Cuomo administration halted an auction for the site in 2014, after then-Assembly member Walter Mosley urged that the building be transferred to the nonprofit Northeast Brooklyn Housing Development Corp.,\nthe New York Daily News reported at the time\n. That plan fell apart, as did another to\nsell the site\nto a Philadelphia-based company.\nThe latest plan has the state footing the bill for demolishing the 33,000-square-foot structure, for which it previously allocated $3.7 million.\nEmpire State Development issued a request for proposals for the\nsite last year\n, seeking a development team that is at least 51 percent owned by a nonprofit. The development partnership is 100 percent not-for-profit, which gave the team a slight edge in the competition for the site, according to the scoring RFP rubric.\nThe project will next undergo environmental review and then the state\u2019s general project plan process. As part of her executive budget, Hochul proposed reforming the State Environmental Quality Review Act to exempt certain housing projects. Given the project\u2019s parameters, the Fulton Street project could qualify for that exemption if the proposal is ultimately approved.\n",

        "content": "Housing production in Los Angeles is poised to pick up even more as a new adaptive reuse law goes into effect this month.\nThe Citywide Adaptive Reuse Ordinance makes it easier for developers to convert vacant commercial buildings into residences by streamlining approvals and increasing the number of properties eligible for conversion, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\nLast month, the Los Angeles City Council voted in favor of the\nCitywide Adaptive Reuse Ordinance\n, which repeals Los Angeles\u2019 existing Adaptive Reuse Incentive Areas Specific Plan, which limited conversions to certain parts of the city including downtown, Chinatown, Hollywood and Koreatown. With the new law, all commercial buildings within Los Angeles city limits can be considered for adaptive reuse.\nThe new regulations also lower the age of the buildings that can be considered for adaptive reuse to structures that are at least 15 years old, down from only allowing conversion at buildings built before 1975. Under the new law, more projects will also be able to receive approval by right, meaning they will be automatically approved if they comply with existing zoning, building codes and land-use regulations.\nJamison Properties\n\u2019s president, Garrett Lee, is leading the way. The Koreatown-based firm is behind the three largest\noffice-to-residential\nprojects in the city to date.\n\u201cThis is monumental for the city,\u201d Lee told the Times of the new ordinance.\nThousands of underutilized commercial structures across the city could be unlocked for housing, Ken Bernstein, a principal city planner in the Los Angeles Department of City Planning, told the Times.\nBy streamlining conversion approvals for projects that meet city guidelines, developers won\u2019t have to estimate how long before they can start construction. \u201cWhen you take that risk off the table, it materially improves the feasibility of conversions,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt addresses both the housing shortage and the long-term office vacancy issue.\u201d\nThere is more than 50 million square feet of vacant office space in Los Angeles, according to the Times. The city\nranks second nationwide\nin adaptive reuse projects with 5,640 apartments in the works, following Manhattan, which has 11,000 such units. In Los Angeles, office-to-residential projects specifically make up a total of 2,843 apartments, or about 50 percent of the city\u2019s adaptive reuse housing pipeline.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Eran Polack\u2019s troubled\nHAP Investments\nlost control of three Harlem rental buildings and his firm appears to have shuttered entirely.\nThe commercial real estate lender\nLadder Capital\n, which was owed roughly $69 million, submitted $1 million credit bids for each of the buildings at 2211 Third Avenue, 329 Pleasant Avenue and 2338 Second Avenue at an auction last month. The trio of multifamily properties was part of HAP\u2019s once-ambitious push into Upper Manhattan. The foreclosure sale was first reported by\nPincusCo\n.\nThe foreclosure adds to the mounting troubles for HAP. Hundreds of Israeli investors lost a collective $70 million after Madison Realty Capital seized control in 2024 of the developer\u2019s failed HAP Seven condominium project at 4452 Broadway in Washington Heights. HAP founders Nir Amsel, Amir Hasid and Polack later informed investors that the property was officially transferred to Madison following Chapter 11 proceedings in state court, according to Ynetnews.\nNow HAP\u2019s website appears to be down and the phone number affiliated with the business has been disconnected. All of the New York properties listed on its website in November appear to have been sold or lost to foreclosure.\nA few years ago, HAP was marketing the three Harlem rentals \u2014 along with another property \u2014 for a combined $130 million. In 2019, listing broker James Nelson of Avison Young said most of the portfolio\u2019s 171 newly built apartments were free-market units. Two of the buildings include affordable housing, while the 30-unit property at 2338 Second Avenue was slated to receive a 421a tax abatement upon completion.\nThe debt dates back to a $64 million loan originated in December 2021 by Allegiant Capital Funding and later assigned to an entity tied to Ladder. The lender moved to foreclose in 2024, alleging the loan had gone into default with $60.9 million in unpaid principal, plus interest.\nIn its state Supreme Court complaint, the lender said Polack and an affiliated entity are listed as guarantors and could face recourse for certain losses.\nIn addition to HAP\u2019s website and phone being down, Polack now lists himself as CEO of HAP Construction on LinkedIn. He did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Attorneys for Ladder also did not respond.\n",

Construction is still in early stages and completion isn\u2019t expected until 2028.\nCharney is one of the most\nactive residential developers in Brooklyn\n, particularly in Gowanus, where the company and its frequent collaborators at Tavros Capital have nearly 2,000 units planned across four buildings.\nCharney Companies and Tavros\nsecured\n$145 million in financing for their 1,000-unit rental development in Gowanus, which is set to be the biggest building in the neighborhood.\nSilver Point Capital provided the acquisition and pre-development debt for the development at\n175 Third Avenue\nalongside The Brodsky Organization and Tikehau Capital.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The financing will support an eight-story, 113-unit project with ground-floor retail space and 23 parking spots.\n\u201cThe project combines strong fundamentals: a well-located site, seasoned local sponsors with market expertise, and a compelling condominium price point,\u201d Maxim Capital managing director Josh Greene said.\nNewmark\u2019s Max Ralby arranged the debt.\nTerra and its fellow investors acquired the 180,000-square-foot development site in 2024 for $27.6 million. Terra is expected to complete the development in approximately 13 months.\nThere\u2019s plenty of development activity in Long Island City, which has drawn special interest from New York City itself.\nIn July, Montperia Group and JLS Construction Group\nsecured a $115 million construction loan\nfrom Maxim Credit for a 216-unit condo tower with ground-floor retail at 24-02 Queens Plaza South in Long Island City. The property was previously owned by Carlyle Group, which acquired it in 2020 for $40 million, intending to build a commercial property, but later sold it to Montperia Group in 2023 for $49 million.\nIn November, the City Council\napproved\nthe final neighborhood rezoning under Eric Adams\u2019 administration, encompassing 54 blocks in Long Island City.\nThe plan is projected to allow for 14,700 new homes, including 4,300 affordable units and includes changes like deeper affordability requirements and building height limits in some areas; Council member Julie Won\u2019s support was contingent on a $1.9 billion commitment from City Hall for infrastructure and community benefits.\nAnd last year, the city\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development\nreleased\na request for proposals for a 70,000-square-foot parcel within the 30-acre Hunter\u2019s Point South site.

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s housing market has a new distinction, and it\u2019s not one brokers will love to tout.\nWhile homebuying became more affordable over the past year in most of the country\u2019s biggest metros, Chicago moved in the opposite direction. Buyers in the region needed 3.5 percent more income in December to afford a median-priced home than they did a year earlier, according to a\nreport\nissued Wednesday by Redfin. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat in eight of the nation\u2019s 10 largest metro areas, required income dropped during the same period.\nThe biggest affordability boost came in Dallas, where buyers needed 7.4 percent less income, year-over-year. Nationwide, the income required to buy the median-priced home fell 4 percent \u2014 a 7.5 percentage point swing compared to Chicago\u2019s decline.\nThe culprit is Chicago\u2019s\nrelative steadiness\n. Unlike pandemic boomtowns such as Phoenix, where prices skyrocketed and are now giving back gains, Chicago saw slower, steadier appreciation, according to the report.\n\u201cThe reason Chicago was getting more expensive in 2025 is that it didn\u2019t get too expensive during the pandemic,\u201d Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather told the outlet, contrasting the city with markets that overheated in 2021 and 2022.\nAt the peak of the boom in early 2022, Chicago home prices were up roughly 10 percent, year-over-year. Phoenix\u2019s were rising at about triple that pace. Now Phoenix buyers have seen affordability improve by 3.7 percent, nearly the inverse of\nChicago\u2019s slide\n.\nLocal agents say the squeeze feels persistent. Ryan Gable of StartingPoint Realty told the outlet that affordability \u201chas not gotten better in years.\u201d Uran Kabashi of Fulton Grace Realty pointed to the double bind of elevated mortgage rates and thin inventory, compounded by broader inflation eating into buyers\u2019 budgets.\nAmong the 50 metros Redfin tracked, only Detroit saw a slightly larger drop in affordability, with buyers needing 3.6 percent more income, year-over-year.\nEven so, Chicago remains\ncomparatively attainable\n. The median home price in Dallas tops $377,000, versus just under $349,000 in Chicago. And while buying\npower improved\nin coastal markets such as Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego, households there still need more than $230,000 in income to afford a median-priced home \u2014 more than double the $105,440 required in the Chicago area.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Blackhawk Plaza in Danville is facing escalating financial distress as its primary lender, Preferred Bank, has filed two loan default notices totaling $31 million, according to Contra Costa County records.\nThe defaults come on top of a separate $5 million loan from Nano Banc, placing the retail center under simultaneous foreclosure pressure from two creditors, the\nSan Jose Mercury News reported\n. The mounting delinquencies underscore a deteriorating capital structure for a property already struggling with declining tenancy and operational challenges.\nThe financing history reveals an increasingly leveraged position. Ramanujan Group, run by real estate financier Deba Shyam, acquired the plaza in 2020 for $28.3 million, immediately supported by a $28 million loan from Preferred Bank. The lender extended an additional $3 million in 2023, while Nano Banc provided $5 million in 2024. The combined $36 million\nin debt exceeds the acquisition price by 27 percent, indicating aggressive leverage relative to asset value and raising questions about underwriting assumptions, cash\u2011flow performance and the borrower\u2019s ability to service obligations.\nOperationally, the property has experienced weakening fundamentals. Key tenants, including Draeger\u2019s Market, have closed, and a planned Apple Cinemas lease never materialized after the prior theater operator exited in 2022. Reduced occupancy and declining foot traffic likely impaired net operating income, constraining the borrower\u2019s capacity to meet debt\u2011service requirements, according to the Mercury News.\nCompounding the financial strain, a coalition of commercial property owners \u2014 including the Blackhawk Automotive and Cultural Museum \u2014 has filed a lawsuit alleging severe deferred maintenance. The complaint cites \u201cever-widening cracks and potholes in parking lots, decrepit and non-functioning light stanchions, rusted and broken staircase railings, crumbling stairs, broken and inoperable irrigation pipes, unclean water, and dangerous erosion of soil.\u201d It also lists \u201copen and live wiring,\u201d conditions that could further depress asset value and complicate any refinancing or sale. Ramanujan Group has denied the allegations, but litigation adds another layer of risk for lenders and stakeholders.\nThe plaza\u2019s challenges are amplified by its geographic position, which experts note is disadvantaged by its distance from Interstate 680, limiting regional draw.\nHowever, Danville ranks as one of the\nwealthiest cities\nin the Bay Area, with an average home price north of $2 million. It has hosted a number of celebrity residents including David DeWalt, the\nformer CEO of McAfee\n, and Ken Behring,\nformer owner\nof the NFL\u2019s Seattle Seahawks. Blackhawk Plaza, once marketed as a premium open\u2011air center with Mediterranean architecture and landscaped water features, would seem a good fit, but the property now faces a convergence of loan defaults, operational decline, tenant attrition and legal disputes.\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

It will add roughly 70,000 new residents to the city of The Woodlands at full buildout, according to the website for The Woodlands-based developer, Howard Hughes Corporation.

Under that structure, a portion of property tax growth generated within the zone would be reinvested there rather than flow to the county\u2019s general fund.\nThe Texans\nwill participate in the development through an affiliate and plan to break ground later this year, targeting a 2029 opening.

The lender paid $731,000 to cover the taxes and later paid another $2.19 million in taxes.\nThe loan wasn\u2019t repaid when it matured in August, the lawsuit alleges. A forbearance agreement expired Jan. 1 without repayment, it alleges. The debt amounts to $321,000 per key.\nThe hotel \u201cis an oceanfront gem,\u201d a spokesperson for the owners told the outlet. Increased interest rates and the Sonder bankruptcy in November were cited as challenges, and it\u2019s likely the ownership hasn\u2019t been able to refinance. The owners are still trying to work it out with their lender, the spokesperson said.\nLebensohn and Freedman developed the 70,800-square-foot Hillsboro Beach Resort in 2021.\nTheir BH3 Management isn\u2019t part of the lawsuit. The firm\u2019s projects include an 844-unit, two tower multifamily development in\nFort Lauderdale\u2019s Flagler Village\nand a 250-unit Hallandale Beach\ncondo conversion\n, in partnership with Ari Pearl\u2019s PPG Development.\nSonder\u2019s meltdown allegedly caused\n\u201cchaos\u201d\nat its hotels in Manhattan and left Los Angeles\nshort-term rental owners in a bind\n.\nThe company filed for bankruptcy and\nfolded\nafter last-ditch moves that included a short-lived partnership with\nMarriott\n.\nNew Orleans was the market hardest-hit by Sonder\u2019s wipeout, with 32 affected properties, according to\nTRD Data\n.

        "content": "California Attorney General Rob Bonta has launched a civil rights investigation into Los Angeles County\u2019s emergency response to the\nEaton fire in Altadena\n, introducing significant regulatory and legal exposure for county agencies.\nThe probe centers on whether race, age or disability discrimination contributed to delayed evacuation alerts and\nlimited firefighting resources\nin west Altadena, a historically Black enclave that suffered disproportionate losses, the\nLos Angeles Times reported\n. Nearly all of the fire\u2019s 19 fatalities occurred in that neighborhood, and residents have argued that systemic failures in alerts and resource deployment directly contributed to the devastation.\nThe investigation follows extensive reporting by the Times that documents stark disparities between west and east Altadena. While eastern neighborhoods received evacuation orders within an hour of ignition, west Altadena residents waited up to nine hours for alerts \u2014 some areas nearly 12 hours \u2014 despite multiple 911 calls and visible fire activity.\nA Times analysis also found that most fire crews remained east of Lake Avenue even as the fire shifted west. These operational gaps raise questions about emergency\u2011management protocols, resource allocation and whether structural inequities influenced decision\u2011making during the disaster.\nBonta has previously charged real estate agents with price-gouging\nin the aftermath of disasters\n, but civil rights law represents a new avenue. From a governance perspective, L.A. County agencies, including the Fire Department, Sheriff\u2019s Department, and Office of Emergency Management, now face a multi\u2011layered review process: Bonta\u2019s civil rights probe, an independent state\u2011ordered investigation by the Fire Safety Research Institute and a separate audit by the California State Auditor.\nWhile county officials assert that responders acted appropriately under extreme conditions, the attorney general\u2019s office is uniquely positioned to evaluate potential \u201cdisparate\u2011impact liability\u201d \u2014 an assessment that does not require proof of intent.\nCleanup of the Eaton fire is\nessentially complete\n, but the rebuild\nhas lagged\n.\nPolitical groups, particularly Altadena for Accountability, view the investigation as a breakthrough in establishing precedent for civil rights oversight in disaster response. Advocates argue that climate\u2011related emergencies increasingly expose vulnerable populations to disproportionate harm, and that the Eaton fire illustrates the financial and institutional costs of inequitable preparedness.\nThe outcome of the probe could influence future emergency\u2011response standards statewide. Bonta noted that the goal is corrective.\n\u201cOur main focus is to make sure that whatever happened here won\u2019t ever happen again,\u201d he said.\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

Taylor-based E3 Agriculture plans to build up to seven homes using crop-based construction materials as part of a 14-home development along Main Street, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe project is a partnership with Liberty3D and will mark E3\u2019s first full-scale homebuilding. While the company has supplied materials to local efforts such as Community First Village, founder and CEO Lucas Evans said this is the first time it will take the reins on delivering an entire home.\n\u201cWe\u2019re wanting to take it on ourselves to do a production home that would be affordable, simple and efficient to build,\u201d Evans told the outlet.\nUp to 80 percent of each house\u2019s materials are expected to come from E3\u2019s hemp crops. Insulation, drywall and other components will be\nplant-based\n, with the exception of roofs, foundations and interior studs. Two homes are already underway and are slated for completion this fall, with\nprices capped\nat $320,000. E3 may develop as many as five additional lots, according to the publication.\nRockdale has a population 5,637 as of 2024 Census estimates, and sits between Austin and College Station. The former Alcoa site is being repositioned as a 33,000-acre, multi-company campus that already hosts\nbitcoin mining operations\ndue to its proximity to large transmission infrastructure. Liberty3D CEO Jason Jones said interest in the area has \u201cblown up\u201d over the past two years.\nAs Austin-area builders search for ways to rein in costs, Evans said hemp could become a viable alternative. Initial construction costs in Rockdale will likely mirror those of conventional builds, he said, but pairing sustainable materials with 3D printing technology could eventually \u201cdramatically bring down the cost of raw materials.\u201d\nThere are performance perks, too. Hemp-based materials are naturally fire-resistant and carbon-conscious, a selling point as insurers and municipalities scrutinize climate risk, according to Evans.\nE3 is already eyeing expansion, with multifamily hemp projects in the works in Austin and San Antonio.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Three of the suspects were arrested on Feb. 11.\nThe scheme centered on securing nearly $1 million from a mortgage loan.\nAfter the sale closed in January 2024, Cardona received a $60,000 wire transfer, which she quickly spent on big-money retail purchases and on a new car.\nThe fraud came to light when employees at third\u2011party entities handling loan disbursements flagged suspicious wire activity. One gold\u2011purchasing business became alarmed when a caller attempted to pick up gold using the homeowner\u2019s phone number, but with a different name. The title company also raised concerns, prompting further scrutiny.\nFederal investigators uncovered evidence while examining WhatsApp and Signal messages tied to a separate mortgage\u2011fraud case. A cooperating witness provided access to communications in which the defendants discussed property targets, access logistics and even the need to recruit impostors to pose as elderly buyers and sellers before a notary.\nTikriti, who has prior convictions for identity theft and grand theft, joked about using gray hair spray and a cane to age an accomplice.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have old 65 yr old guys at my disposal to play ball,\u201d a message from Tikriti stated, according to the Times. \u201cI\u2019m not a casting director.\u201d\nBurbank Police had already opened an investigation after the real homeowner reported that his property had been sold without his knowledge. The supposed buyer later told police they were unaware of the purchase and were suddenly responsible for a $975,000 mortgage.\nMortgage fraud is nothing new \u2014 alleged culprits range from New York Attorney General\nLetitia James\nto Texas Attorney General\nKen Paxton\n\u2014 but usually one of the parties is involved in the scam.

It\u2019s a move that would expand its Chicago presence and shift its local office from River North to the Loop. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat the firm currently occupies less than 40,000 square feet in the 321 North Clark Street building.\nIf finalized, the lease would mark the latest vote of confidence from the\nlegal sector\nin a downtown office market still grappling with elevated vacancy, the outlet reported.

Even as anchor tenants CNA Financial and Meta have sought to shed chunks of space on the sublease market, the property has attracted new tenants. Shamrock Trading recently subleased a floor from CNA, and Vermillion Development signed for nearly 16,000 square feet.\nA Loeb &amp; Loeb departure would add pressure at the building at 321 North Clark Street.

        "content": "Menlo Equities will abandon its previously approved plans for a 400,000\u2011square\u2011foot office and life sciences campus in Sunnyvale and will pivot to a large\u2011scale data center on the site.\nThe decision reflects the accelerating preference in Silicon Valley for artificial intelligence\u2011driven infrastructure, the\nSan Francisco Business Times reported\n. The revised plan cuts the original office footprint by roughly 200,000 square feet and replaces the multibuilding research and design concept with a single two\u2011story data center and an adjacent Pacific Gas and Electric Company substation to support the project\u2019s substantial power requirements.\nThe shift aligns with surging demand for\ndata\u2011center capacity\nas AI companies and cloud providers race to secure power\u2011dense facilities. Across the region, developers are shelving traditional office projects in favor of data centers capable of supporting AI workloads, which require significantly more electricity and cooling than conventional enterprise computing.\nMenlo Equities, run by Rick Holmstrom from its headquarters in Menlo Park, first entered the data\u2011center sector in 2025 through its Menlo Digital platform, partnering with NRG Energy to develop 350 megawatts of capacity across Northern Virginia, Silicon Valley and Dallas, with delivery expected between 2027 and 2028. The Sunnyvale project, located at 888\u2013894 Ross Drive in Peery Park, is now confirmed as one of those sites. The company has secured 49 megawatts of power \u2014 enough to supply more than 10,000 homes \u2014 positioning the property as a high\u2011capacity AI\u2011oriented facility.\nThe developer\nacquired\nthe 9\u2011acre site for $88.5 million in 2022 and initially proposed two, four\u2011story office buildings and a six\u2011level parking structure. The firm hired RMW Architects &amp; Interiors, RHAA Landscape Architects and Newmark\u2019s Joe Kelly and Mike Saign for the original concept. However, by early 2026, filings show the company had taken out a $20 million loan from Northern Trust and secured a redevelopment permit valued at $23.43 million, along with an entitlement extension through November 2026 \u2014 steps consistent with advancing a data\u2011center project.\nThe site\u2019s industrial zoning further supports the decision, as such zoning is typical for data\u2011center development. Menlo Equities already owns another\nSunnyvale data center\nat 444 Toyama Drive, purchased from Digital Realty in 2021.\nThe Sunnyvale project joins more than 30 new data\u2011center developments underway in California as Amazon.com, Microsoft, CloudHQ, Edgecore and others compete to build capacity.\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "Adam Neumann is fast becoming persona non-grata in El Portal, the small village in northeast Miami-Dade County where he wants to erase an old church to make way for his wife\u2019s private school.\nAt a town hall Thursday, a procession of village residents bashed Neumann, who was not in attendance, and two owner representatives for SOLFL School, who hosted the event.\nFour days earlier, crews began tearing down the Rader Memorial United Methodist Church at 205 Northeast 87th Street, which\nNeumann\npurchased 11 months ago for $13.7 million. The price was more than $8 million above the previous sale price in 2021. While the 1950s building is not a historic landmark, the church has stood as the village\u2019s signature property for nearly 75 years.\nEl Portal residents said they were blindsided by the demolition, fueling their suspicions that Neumann and SOLFL representatives are going to plow ahead with redeveloping the property without their input.\nThe name is an acronym for Student of Life, For Life, a holistic Jewish school founded by\nRebekah Neumann\nthat operates a Montessori-style, Torah-centered learning environment, according to SOLFL\u2019s website.\nNeumann did not respond to email requesting comment.\nRoughly 100 people attended the town hall, and several spoke with condemnation.\n\u201cWhen you tore down the church, you punched us in the face,\u201d said Denise White, a resident who spoke at the town hall. \u201cRight now, you\u2019re acting overlordy, not neighborly.\u201d\nIt was the first of two community meetings mandated by El Portal Village Council after its members delayed voting on zoning changes that would allow the school on the church property.\nSOLFL is a rebranding of\nWeGrow\n, a school started by the Neumanns as an off-shoot of\nWeWork\n, the co-working firm previously helmed by Adam Neumann. He stepped down as CEO in 2019 under pressure from WeWork\u2019s board of directors and investors after a botched attempt to take the company public.\nIn December and January, SOLFL representatives presented the vision for the new campus, which consists of two-story Tiki hut-style buildings and an eight-foot wall surrounding the property\u2019s perimeter. The structure would be built using 3-D printing technology. The proposed campus would teach a maximum of 350 students from kindergarten to 12th grade.\nDemolition of the church is in SOLFL\u2019s site plan and other documents submitted to the village, but school representatives did not disclose that a teardown permit was obtained in November and that the teardown would begin before the town hall, videos of the city council meetings show.\nSOLFL representative Jeffrey Davis said the demolition work could not be paused. \u201cIt has to be cleared,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is completely unsafe.\u201d\nResidents said keeping them in the dark about the demolition reinforced their lack of trust.\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t transparent at the last meeting,\u201d said Calixto Navarro Acosta. \u201cThere are ulterior motives and nefarious motives here. We are not dealing with a clean slate.\u201d\nSOLFL is seeking village council approval for a site plan, an amendment to El Portal\u2019s comprehensive master plan and a special exception for 2.1 acres that includes the church property and a neighboring single family house and vacant lot, which was part of the $13.7 million acquisition.\nNeumann purchased the church property from an affiliate of Miami-based Elm Springs, which paid\n$5.5 million\nfor the site five years ago, and had previously planned on converting the building into office, retail and restaurant spaces.\nOver the summer, SOLFL explored renovating the church into a school, but had to pivot to new construction because it is less expensive, Davis said.\nThe school is one of two projects Neumann is planning in El Portal.\nLast year, Neumann\u2019s Miami-based multifamily development firm Flow and Canada Global bought a 16-acre former mobile home park in El Portal for\n$71.5 million\nafter winning a courthouse auction for the site. The joint venture is planning a mixed-use project with 2,380-plus apartments, but plans have not been disclosed.",

        "content": "Highbridge Equity Partners has defaulted on another downtown Oakland office property, adding to a growing list of distressed assets in the foreclosure pipeline.\nJPMorgan Chase has filed a complaint in Alameda County Superior Court seeking to foreclose on 1540\u20131544 Broadway, a multitenant building in the East Bay city\u2019s core, after Highbridge failed to repay a $2.7 million loan tied to the property, the\nSan Francisco Business Times reported\n. The borrower stopped making payments in June 2025 and still owes $2.3 million as of February 2026, according to court filings.\nThe building sits adjacent to 1500 Broadway, one of three Highbridge-owned office towers \u2014 along with the Tribune Tower and the Financial Center Building \u2014 that entered foreclosure in 2025 and were placed in receivership. At the time, the receiver reported severe deterioration across the portfolio, including broken windows, asbestos, drug paraphernalia and other hazardous conditions.\nThe new foreclosure indicates that Highbridge\u2019s broader Oakland strategy, once built on acquiring and repositioning historic assets, has largely collapsed under debt pressure and deferred maintenance.\nHighbridge, run by CEO Douglas Abrams, purchased 1540\u20131544 Broadway for $6 million in 2018 and financed it with a loan from First Republic Bank, whose assets JPMorgan later acquired.\nThe lawsuit also names Thomas Beers, producer of the television show \u201cDeadliest Catch,\u201d and his wife Leslie Beers as guarantors. The Beers invested in the Tribune Tower and could be held liable for repayment, according to the Business Times.\nJPMorgan is seeking a court\u2011appointed receiver to stabilize operations and potentially prepare the Broadway property for sale.\nThe building has long served as an arts and cultural venue, most recently housing the Black Arts Movement Business District Community Development Corporation and the Lower Bottom Playaz theater company.\nHighbridge\u2019s troubles extend beyond Broadway. Between 2016 and 2018, the firm spent more than $117 million acquiring the Tribune Tower, Financial Center Building and 1500 Broadway, later refinancing the portfolio with a $111 million loan. That debt also went into default in 2025, prompting lender Rialto Capital Management to\ntake control\nthrough receivership. The firm additionally owns The Loom, a 5\u2011acre East Oakland redevelopment site with an uncertain future.\nThe context of Highbridge troubles is Oakland\u2019s weakened post\u2011pandemic office market, where vacancies have surged and\ndistressed assets\nare trading at steep discounts. Multiple buildings have already been\nseized by lenders\nor sold at fractions of prior valuations, signaling a deep market reset.\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "Ken Griffin isn\u2019t waiting around for 2030.\nThe Citadel founder\nopted\nthis week to accelerate his bet on 350 Park Avenue, electing to take a 60 percent stake in the joint venture developing the 2 million-square-foot tower rather than wait for his original deadline to either buy the site outright or assume control later. The move reshuffles the balance of power between Griffin and his partners, Vornado Realty Trust and Rudin Management, while speeding up one of Midtown\u2019s most closely watched office projects.\nUnder a 2022 agreement, Griffin had until June 2030 to either acquire a majority stake in the venture or purchase the site for $1.4 billion, which would have sidelined Vornado and Rudin from the development. Instead, he chose in December to lock in the 60 percent position now, according to comments from Vornado president Michael Franco during the REIT\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call.\nThe decision also amends the original ownership split. Vornado and Rudin have until July to secure between 23 percent and 40 percent of the joint venture, with Vornado\u2019s share ranging from 21 percent to 36 percent. Previously, Vornado was slated for 36 percent and Rudin 4 percent. Demolition is expected to begin in April following City Council approval of the rezoning and permit filings late last year.\nCitadel, the anchor tenant, previously committed to 850,000 square feet, but Vornado executives signaled that footprint could grow. CEO Steve Roth said the hedge fund is still finalizing its space needs, while Franco noted interest from tenants with leases expiring between 2031 and 2033 seeking as little as 50,000 square feet.\nThe accelerated timeline is a vote of confidence in a top-tier Park Avenue product at a moment when much of the office market remains bifurcated. Griffin is doubling down on trophy space as other landlords retrench, a high-stakes wager that demand for best-in-class offices will outpace broader market malaise.\nIt\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day weekend, which means it\u2019s time to turn down the lights, pour a glass of pinot noir and snuggle up to your loved one while reading the week\u2019s most important New York stories from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nWaldorf Astoria hits market after eight-year condo conversion\nDajia Insurance Group, a state-run Chinese firm, plans to sell the historic Waldorf Astoria property in Manhattan.\nA lengthy renovation reduced the hotel portion to 375 rooms and created 372 condominium units, which would be sold separately, though the overall property sale will include adjoining restaurants and retail sites.\nThe project, which launched in 2017, faced major disruptions, including the seizure of the original developer, Anbang Insurance Group, by the Chinese government.\nManocherian Brothers float resi conversion despite Midtown South carveout\nThe City Council\u2019s Midtown South rezoning carved out 37 Garment District properties, including a building at 257 West 39th Street, to preserve the area\u2019s \u201cunique cluster of businesses.\u201d\nDespite this exclusion, the owner of 257 West 39th Street is pursuing a site-specific zoning change to allow for a partial residential conversion of the commercial building.\nThe Garment District Alliance opposed the carveout, citing a nearly 30 percent vacancy rate in the excluded properties and arguing that the city is needlessly preventing housing and growth in an area well-served by transit.\nJonathan Miller and Douglas Elliman break up data partnership after 32 years\nAppraiser Jonathan Miller\u2019s 32-year relationship with Douglas Elliman has come to a close, with the final market report under the partnership published on Thursday.\nMiller, who heads Miller Samuel appraisal firm and is an adjunct professor at Columbia, is shifting his focus to a new neighborhood-level housing index venture called StreetMatrix.\nLaunched with economist Nick Huntington-Klein, the venture offers market performance data down to bedroom count and neighborhood, aiming to provide a more granular view than traditional city-wide housing indexes.\nTech took Manhattan office leases by storm in January\nJanuary was a good month for tech companies, going by the number of leases they signed within the five boroughs of New York City.

The seller was reality star Julia Haart, and the buyer was a trust. The 7,800-square-foot condo went on the market in November for $65 million.

        "content": "Humberto Lopes heard the opening bell, drew his fists and posted a profanity-laden TikTok urging landlords to stop paying their property taxes.\n\u201cLet\u2019s start not paying the property tax for this quarter coming up. We\u2019ll fucking bankrupt this city!\u201d he shouted in the video posted on\nTuesday\n. \u201cThe minute we don\u2019t pay your property tax, New York City will fucking crumble.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t foreclose on all of us,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhen you destroy us, we can destroy the fucking city,\u201d he concluded.\nIn the video, Lopes holds up a poster released by the Mamdani administration this week announcing dates for five \u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings, where tenants are invited to speak out about their experiences renting in the city. The image featured the text \u201cNew Yorkers vs. Bad Landlords,\u201d\nevoking\na boxing match.\nLandlord groups were not amused by the imagery.\n\u201cFraming his \u2018rental ripoff\u2019 hearings as a prize fight between tenants vs. landlords makes it disturbingly clear that this new mayor\u2019s housing policies are going to be driven by marquee-like politics, circus-like slogans, and us-versus-them divisiveness,\u201d Ann Korchak, board president of the Small Property Owners of New York, said in a statement.\n\u201cShow trials may make good theater, but they don\u2019t solve problems,\u201d Anthony Burgos, CEO\u00a0 of the New York Apartment Association, said in a statement.\nLopes echoed these sentiments, but with more f-bombs.\n\u201cWhat do you think you are going to accomplish that HPD didn\u2019t accomplish?\u201d he asked, clutching the poster, referring to the city\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development.\nHe also questioned why the administration isn\u2019t including NYCHA in the hearings. (Public Advocate Jumaane Williams called out the city\u2019s public housing authority last month as the city\u2019s true worst landlord, though it didn\u2019t make his official list.)\nWhen asked on Friday, Lopes said he is in earnest about urging owners to withhold property taxes, comparing it to when tenants stop paying rent to force landlords to make repairs. He said he\u2019s consulting with attorneys about following through with the threat.\nHow many others would follow him in such a protest is unclear. Korchak said that while small property owners are \u201cfrustrated with the anti-landlord vitriol,\u201d withholding property tax payments \u201cwould bring greater financial harm and distress\u201d to owners. She thinks a more constructive route is pushing the state to amend the 2019 rent laws.\nLopes heads H.L. Dynasty, which owns and operates 1.2 million square feet of real estate in New York and Florida, according to the company\u2019s website. Lopes recently launched a landlord group, dubbed Gotham Housing Alliance, inspired by his longtime love of Batman (in videos, Batman figurines can be seen on his desk, and in at least one video, a life-sized Caped Crusader statue appears in the background). Lopes noted in a call Friday that Batman\u2019s M.O. is to bring the \u201ccity back to normal.\u201d\nThe video features a bombastic style seen in his other videos on social media, where he speaks directly to the camera. Lopes has griped about other city policies in these videos, including the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act, or COPA.\n\u201cIf a poster about \u2018bad landlords\u2019 strikes a nerve, it\u2019s worth asking why. Our focus isn\u2019t on rhetoric \u2014 it\u2019s on results,\u201d a City Hall spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re eager to partner with anyone who\u2019s committed to providing safe, stable homes and helping us build a city that everyday New Yorkers can actually afford.\u201d\nTenant advocates say the \u201crental ripoff\u201d video proves the need for the hearings.\n\u201cHit dogs holler,\u201d Charlie Dulik, director of tenant organizing at Housing Conservation Coordinators, said. \u201cHis rage about tenants being offered a simple chance to speak about the conditions they endure shows exactly why these hearings are necessary.\u201d\nThe first hearing is slated for Feb. 26 in Downtown Brooklyn. As one of his first acts as mayor, Zohran Mamdani signed an executive order establishing the hearings to give tenants the opportunity to speak about \u201cabusive, deceptive, or unconscionable landlord practices.\u201d The executive order lists property managers and landlords as potential speakers as well.\nWithin 90 days of the final hearing, scheduled for April 7, city agencies must issue a joint report outlining common themes raised during the hearings and recommending policy and other changes to address them.\n",

        "content": "Related Urban\n, BH Group and Tezral Partners won initial approval to build an apartment complex with two 20-story towers on city-owned land in Riviera Beach.\nThe 418-unit project at\nMarina Village\nwas given the green light from the village\u2019s planning and zoning board Thursday, but its members recommended adding workforce housing to the mix.\nThe project, called Gallery at Marina Village, is slated for 2.45 acres surrounded by Broadway, East 12\nth\nStreet, Avenue C, and West 13\nth\nStreet. The proposal is headed to\nRiviera Beach\nCity Council for a final vote.\nThe Related Group\u2019s affordable housing arm, Miami-based Related Urban Development Group, is partnering with Aventura-based\nBH Group\nand West Palm Beach-based Tezral Partners on the project.\nIt will consist of 190 two-bedrooms, 152 one-bedrooms, 38 three-bedrooms, and 38 studios as well as 3,000 square feet of retail and 3,000 square feet of office. Amenities include an 1,800-square-foot fitness center, an 1,800-square-foot coworking space and a ground floor pool deck.\nA nine-level parking garage is planned with 652 spaces, about 25 percent fewer than the 863 spaces required under city code.\nThe development site is next to Residences at Marina Village,\nan eight-story, 149-unit\naffordable and workforce housing project that Related Urban and Tezral Partners have under construction. That project is close to topping off and will be finished in the fall, Related Urban president Albert Milo told the board.\nBoth developments are elements of Riviera Beach\u2019s Marina Village Master Plan, a 2013 concept designed to bring economic development to a 90-acre area by the waterfront owned by the city and its community redevelopment agency. It consists of a marina and an event space with an outdoor restaurant.\nThe complex that\u2019s under construction includes affordable and workforce housing, but the proposed development was designed as a market-rate project.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean a workforce person can\u2019t reside in the Gallery at Marina Village, but the market will dictate what the rents will be,\u201d Milo told the board.\nRents are expected to cost $2,500 to $4,000 a month, he said.\nFrank Fernandez, the board\u2019s vice chair, pressed for workforce units to be part of this project.\nMilo said he had no objections to that since workforce housing units only need to be affordable for households earning 120 percent of the area median income. In Palm Beach County, that is about $98,000 a year, an amount that is expected to grow to $108,000 in May, Milo told the board.\nRelated Urban is one of three development teams that submitted bids to build on 12 acres of Marina Village near the waterfront as part of the city\u2019s master plan.\nThe overall master plan includes 224 condo units, 120 hotel rooms, 10 three-story condos, waterfront retail and a parking garage with a soccer field and tennis and pickleball courts.\nRelated Urban\u2019s proposal will face off against Forest Development\u2019s offer to build a convention center of at least 320,000 square feet, along with 270 hotel rooms and 164 condo units, as well as Sonnenblick Development\u2019s plans to construct a mixed-use project that will include a\nMargaritaville Hotel\nand 270 residential units.",

        "content": "A power duo on Los Angeles\u2019 Eastside cleaned up this week with a couple of closings, despite more \u201csensitive\u201d conditions for the area\u2019s high end.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019\nJonathan Mogharrabi and Marci Kays\n, who count the actor Brad Pitt among their clients, double ended the sale of Fear of God designer\nJerry Lorenzo\n\u2019s Los Feliz home for $8.6 million, or $1,197 per square foot. The deal on the property at 2401 Nottingham Avenue officially closed on Wednesday.\nIt\u2019s the priciest deal to close in Los Feliz since June\u2019s $13.5 million trade of 4533 Cockerham Drive, which sold for $675 per square foot.\nMogharrabi and Kays, who co-listed the property with Plus Real Estate\u2019s Tyrone McKillen, represented the local family that purchased the home.\nLorenzo and his wife, Desiree Manuel, paid $8.5 million for the Nottingham Avenue residence, making the decision to list it after they purchased and moved their family to 9051 Briarcrest Lane in Beverly Hills Post Office for $19.5 million in 2023.\nAfter the closing of Lorenzo\u2019s home, Kays and Mogharrabi capped the work week with the closing of 2720 Glendower Avenue, also in Los Feliz, and also double ended by the high-end agents.\nThe 1920s, Spanish Colonial style home closed for nearly $7.4 million.\nProperty records indicate the seller was a shell company tied to registered agents with a Sacramento address.\nMarket dynamics\nMogharrabi called the Eastside\u2019s high-end market a \u201cmix.\u201d\n\u201cI think some of the properties are just being priced too high, but more than pricing it\u2019s just strategy on how to put these deals together now with the market being more sensitive on the Eastside,\u201d he said.\nProperties priced over $7 million in places such as Los Feliz and Silver Lake require careful strategy. That goes beyond simply factoring in\nMeasure United to House L.A.\n, which Mogharrabi said the market\u2019s generally accepted as part of buying and selling real estate in Los Angeles.\nThe\ntwo-tier tax\napplies a 4 percent levy on city of Los Angeles real estate deals starting at $5.3 million and kicks up to 5.5 percent on trades starting at $10.6 million.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about the market being slow, but there are plenty of buyers looking in this price point and we\u2019ve noticed a pickup for us personally with a lot of our inventory,\u201d he said.\nThat\u2019s a finer distinction that holds across the greater Los Angeles\u2019s high-end market. And, to that point, Mogharrabi said his and Kays\u2019 listing at 7141 Senalda Road in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Outpost Estates just went into escrow. The 1930s-built home counts six beds and seven baths and is asking just under $9 million, or $1,333 per square foot.\nOutpost Estates is the same historic community where Kays and Mogharrabi represented Pitt last August in the actor\u2019s\n$12 million purchase\nof a residence in the area known for its Spanish and Mediterranean designs. They followed up that deal the next month with their representation of Pitt in the off-market sale of his Los Feliz\nMid-Century Modern\nhome, known as\nThe Steel House\n. The property had been listed for $5.5 million, sources told\nThe Real Deal\nat the time of the closing.\n",

        "content": "The site of several demolished properties in Hollywood will become a 33-unit apartment complex from local developer Rom Investments.\nBased on an application submitted to the Los Angeles Department of City Planning, the apartments would rise at 1845 North Taft Avenue, at the corner of Franklin Avenue and north of the 101 freeway,\nUrbanize Los Angeles reported\n. The six-story building would include one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments above non-required parking for 48 vehicles.\nCategory Design Group is the architect on the project, and Alchemy Planning &amp; Land Use is working with the developer. A rendering shows a modern block-style structure in a podium configuration.\nRom Investments, run by Leeor Maciborski and his wife Orly Maciborski, has requested development incentives through the Citywide Housing Incentive Program to build a larger structure than otherwise allowed by zoning rules. The project would bring a mid-rise building to a neighborhood of shorter homes and structures. To qualify for the zoning exemption, Rom would rent four of the units as affordable housing for extremely-low-income tenants.\nROM Investments focuses on \u201ccurating,\u201d via acquisition or development, \u201cunique living spaces\u201d in Los Angeles, particularly the Hollywood market. The company has filed plans for an\n131-unit\napartment complex\nnear the Hollywood/Western Metro stop. It would include 74 studios, 49 one-bedroom apartments and eight two-bedrooms.\nLike the Taft Avenue project, the larger project at 5242 East Carlton Way in East Hollywood involved the demolition of older structures \u2014 in this case, two small multifamily buildings \u2014 and their replacement with a new 138,894-square-foot one.\nThe developer also has a Transit Oriented Communities project at 1807-1809 North Van Ness Avenue in Hollywood. The project replaces a 111-year-old house with five residential units, consisting of two duplexes and one single-family home.\nHollywood has emerged as a hotbed for apartment projects, with recent proposals from\nUncommon Developers\nin Chatsworth and\nKimco Realty\n.\n\u2014\nJoel Russell\n",

While the square footage is modest compared to the massive office leases that define the neighborhood, the deal signals a pivotal shift for the corridor.\nFulton Street Companies, led by Ross Babel and Alex Najem, has pushed to transform the fast-growing office hub and hot residential area into a\nhigh-end shopping destination\n. While brands like Lululemon and Anthropologie have planted flags, the arrival of Rick Owens \u2014 known for gothic minimalism and brutalist aesthetics \u2014 marks the first ultra-luxury brand to set up shop in Fulton Market.\n\u201cRick Owens embodies uncompromising creativity and cultural relevance,\u201d said Shanna Khan, CEO of Shanna Collective and the project\u2019s chief design officer. \u201cWelcoming a world-renowned, avant-garde designer such as Rick Owens creates a platform for bold expression in fashion and the arts.\u201d\nThe retail lease was brokered by Francis X. Scire, Jr., head of retail leasing for The Fulton, in collaboration with Khan. Fulton Street Companies tapped Scire in January to lead its leasing operations and bring in high-end clients. Najem said it was especially enjoyable to witness Owens\u2019 wife, designer Mich\u00e8le Lamy, walk the brand\u2019s new space with Khan and come up with ideas for its eventual presentation and opening.\nRick Owens was represented by Newmark\u2019s Andrew Turf, Jonathan Schley, Aubrie Pettersen and Aubrey Hinkson in collaboration with Chicago-based Canvas Real Estate\u2019s Anthony Campagni and Elan Rasansky.\nThe store will be located within The Fulton, a 535,000-square-foot development that involved the adaptive reuse of the historic Schwinn bicycle factory on Lake Street and the more than $230 million construction of an adjacent 12-story office building immediately to the north on 919 West Fulton Street.\nThe new construction project broke ground in 2023 \u2014 one of the few office developments to do so amid a high-interest rate environment \u2014 and recently completed work, with ongoing interior buildouts for high-end fitness tenant Equinix as well as a Gibson\u2019s restaurant.\nFulton Street Companies has been one of the most active developers in the neighborhood, betting that the area can sustain premium rents despite broader headwinds in the commercial sector. Its 919 West Fulton Street hosts Harrison Street Real Estate as its anchor office tenant, which recently moved its workforce into the building. Najem and Khan\u2019s firms purchased the Lake Street Lofts building next door, where Rick Owens is leasing, for $49 million in 2023.\n",

        "content": "Illinois lawmakers are gearing up to take another swing at one of the most closely watched insurance overhauls in years, reviving a bill that would give state regulators new authority to curb homeowners premium hikes.\nThe push comes after Bloomington, Illinois-based State Farm raised Illinois homeowners rates an average of\n27.2 percent last year\n, citing mounting weather-related losses. Capitol News Illinois\nreported\nthat Gov. JB Pritzker\nseized on the increase\nto call for tighter oversight, arguing insurers shouldn\u2019t be able to shift the cost of disasters in places like California and Florida onto Illinois property owners. In December,\nAllstate announced\nthat it plans an average 8.8 percent hike in Illinois homeowners insurance premiums starting Feb. 24, affecting over 209,000 policyholders, as previously reported in\nThe Real Deal\n.\nA measure granting the Illinois Department of Insurance authority to review and reject excessive rate increases cleared the Senate during the fall veto session, but fell four votes short in the House. Many assumed it was dead, but chief House sponsor Rep. Robyn Gabel refiled a motion to concur, according to the publication, teeing up a potential second vote as the General Assembly returns to Springfield for the 2026 session.\nIndustry groups say they\u2019re bracing for round two. Kevin Martin, executive director of the Illinois Insurance Association, told the outlet that insurers have heard the bill could be called as early as next week.\nAt the heart of the fight is\nIllinois\u2019 status\nas a \u201cuse-and-file\u201d state, allowing insurers to implement new rates immediately and submit them to regulators afterward. Supporters of the bill note Illinois is the only state that lacks a law explicitly barring \u201cexcessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory\u201d premiums and does not require prior approval of rate changes, according to the publication.\nThe proposal would keep the use-and-file framework, but empower regulators to review rates after they take effect and order refunds if they\u2019re found to violate state standards. It would also require 60 days\u2019 notice for hikes of 10 percent or more and mandate the use of Illinois-specific loss data to prevent so-called cost-shifting.\nInsurers argue the measure goes too far, particularly because it sets no time limit on how far back regulators could look when reviewing rates, according to the outlet. They also reject the allegation that out-of-state losses are baked into Illinois premiums.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Wall Street may be spooked by artificial intelligence. CBRE\u2019s chief isn\u2019t.\nShares of CBRE plunged nearly 9 percent Thursday to close at $136, capping a two-day, 20 percent slide \u2014 the company\u2019s steepest drop since 2020 \u2014 as investors fretted that rapid advances in AI could erode demand for office space and disrupt brokerage models. The stock slid again early Friday before rebounding more than 5 percent by midday, Bloomberg\nreported\n. Its shares closed on Friday at $142, up 4.4 percent from Thursday\u2019s close.\nThe selloff rippled across the sector. JLL fell 7.6 percent and\nNewmark dropped\nmore than 4 percent on Thursday, as what analysts dubbed the latest \u201cAI scare trade\u201d spread from brokerages to real estate investment trusts.\nOn an earnings call on Thursday, CBRE CEO Bob Sulentic struck a markedly different tone. The Dallas-based firm\u2019s work, he argued, is too complex to be automated away, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get our brokerage leads online somewhere,\u201d Sulentic said, pointing to the \u201cdeep knowledge\u201d brokers cultivate with occupiers and investors. Strategic advice on major transactions and oversight of global development projects, he suggested, are not easily replicated by code.\nIf anything, AI is proving additive. Sulentic said\nCBRE rolled out\ninternal AI tools to arm brokers with data more efficiently and at lower cost. And the technology is fueling one of the firm\u2019s fastest-growing businesses: data centers.\nCBRE reported record 2025 revenue of $40.6 billion, up 13 percent, year-over-year, with fourth-quarter revenue rising 12 percent to $11.6 billion. Net income for the year climbed nearly 20 percent to about $1.2 billion. Core earnings per share of $2.73 beat Wall Street estimates.\nData center and digital infrastructure work accounted for roughly 14 percent of CBRE\u2019s pre-tax earnings in 2025, Sulentic said. The firm expects revenue from its data center business to hit $2 billion in 2026, growing at a 20 percent annual clip.\nCBRE has been\nbulking up\naccordingly. In 2024, it bought\ntechnical services firm\nDirect Line Global, and in November closed a $1.2 billion acquisition of Pearce Services from New Mountain Capital, expanding its reach into cooling systems and electrical infrastructure critical to server farms.\nSulentic acknowledged the possibility of an AI-fueled bubble, but added it should be taken into context that five years ago the current amount of data center business was considered unimaginable, and five years from now it is impossible for him to say whether it will grow larger or fizzle.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening is that talent is being used to support the growth of AI,\u201d Sulentic said. \u201cSo we think there\u2019s going to be enduring growth there.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Anti-poverty advocates are using some tricky math to push back on the \u201cabundance\u201d movement as a solution to housing affordability.\nA new\nreport\nby the Center on Poverty and Inequality at Georgetown Law School says that in markets where developers built a lot of housing, rents for low-income units went up more than for other units. The researchers got their study featured in a\nNew York Times\narticle.\nBut the actual rent increases might have been smaller than the report made them seem, and in the context of rising expenses, they should surprise absolutely no one.\nNor are they an argument against adding robustly to housing supply. The researchers, to their credit, don\u2019t reject the abundance strategy. But they do suggest that abundance doesn\u2019t help low-income tenants.\nI agree that very poor people need more than ample supply, because their incomes aren\u2019t enough to sustain any kind of decent housing. That is, they need income support such as rental vouchers.\nBut they also need an ample supply of housing to accommodate people who out-earn them. Otherwise they will be competing with them \u2014 a losing proposition.\nMy first bone to pick with the report is its title: \u201cAbundance for Who?\u201d That\u2019s like fingernails on a chalkboard for me. Would it have killed them to say \u201cAbundance for Whom?\u201d\nThen I took a close look at the\nLinkedIn post\nby Lelaine Bigelow, the executive director of the center behind the study:\n\u201cFor years, the narrative has been simple: just build more housing and prices will come down. But our analysis of six high-growth metros shows it\u2019s not that straightforward.\n\u201cTake Phoenix. The city built aggressively. New units had a vacancy rate over 9%. Yet rents for extremely low-income households jumped 26.7% while rents for high-income households actually fell by 5.3%.\u201d\nThe alleged increase was over eight years, from 2015 to 2023. And the \u201chigh-income\u201d statistic Bigelow cited actually included moderate- and middle-income households. These groups make up the majority of renters.\nThat\u2019s the first reason the study\u2019s numbers are \u2014 to borrow Bigelow\u2019s phrase \u2014 \u201cnot that straightforward.\u201d\nThe bigger reason is that researchers adjusted for inflation not by using the general Consumer Price Index but by using CPI for local rents for the metropolitan area in question.\nStay with me here, people. Math concept ahead!\nRent inflation across the Phoenix market was very low, perhaps even negative, from 2015 to 2023, thanks to aggressive building for moderate- to upper-income families.\nBut that rent inflation makes even modest nominal increases in rents paid by extremely low-income households (earning $30,000 or less) look very large \u2014 in this case, 26.7 percent.\n\u201cIf you told Class C/D operators in Phoenix their rents were up 26.7 percent over that period, they would look at you like you were crazy,\u201d housing economist Jay Parsons\ncommented\nbelow Bigelow\u2019s post.\nLet\u2019s review:\nPhoenix built like crazy, resulting in a real (inflation-adjusted) drop in rents for most households. That\u2019s a clear win for housing affordability.\nBut because so many rents fell, if your household\u2019s rent went up, the relative increase is going to be a big percentage jump.\nAnd why did rents increase for the cheapest units?\nLisa Gomez, CEO of the big New York City real estate firm L &amp; M Development Partners,\nanswered that question\n:\n\u201cIt\u2019s as much about operating expenses as it is about supply,\u201d Gomez wrote on LinkedIn. \u201cEvery area has its own operating economics and you have to have corresponding income to cover them.\u201d\nOwners of the cheapest rental housing are far more sensitive to those increases than at the high end. Those landlords must either raise rents to cover their costs or shutter the unit (which would remove it from the data).\nUnfortunately, the study did not compare rent increases to the increases in operating costs, such as for utilities, insurance, property taxes and maintenance. But they were probably\nlower\n.\nThe bottom line is: in markets with housing abundance, most rents stayed down because of competition. Because operating costs rose, the lowest-income tenants saw rents increase relative to higher earners\u2019 rents. And without abundance to absorb demand for housing, their rents would have gone up a lot more.\n\u201cWe need to do A LOT more to help low-income families access safe, quality housing (more subsidized housing, vouchers, etc.),\u201d Parsons\nwrote\n, \u201cbut simply demanding we build less market rate wouldn\u2019t provide any material boost to these families because those projects aren\u2019t gonna pencil out at the rent levels needed.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The show might have seemed to be over in the Live Music Capital of the World, but there may be an encore.\nAustin drew crowds in the early 2020s as any concerns over the pandemic were more than offset by cheap mortgages, the\ntech industry\u2019s\ninterest in the Lone Star state and remote workers trading\ntight coastal homes for roomier styles\n.\nBy the end of 2025, the bandwagon was long gone. Apartments built for the next wave of festivalgoers met with sparse demand, leading to\nvacancy rates almost double the national average of 8.6 percent\nand\nthe greatest decline in average rent of any of the top 50 metros in the country\nin January. Redfin found this month that\nfour out of five homes in Austin sold below their original listing price last year\n, the biggest share of any major metro in the state and one of the biggest in the country. Even the high end felt the chill: the prestigious Tarrytown neighborhood saw its home values decline year-over-year at a greater rate than any other ZIP code in Austin in 2025, with\naverage sale prices dropping 11 percent\nfrom $1.7 million in 2024 to $1.5 million last year. One high-volume resi team,\nTrinity Texas Realty\n, resorted to hospitality to fill the gap of lower home sales.\nBut loyal Austin fans aren\u2019t leaving the show just yet.\nA closer look at the data reveals persistent demand for Austin apartments, centrally located homes and certain luxury neighborhoods. Austin absorbed 3,177 multifamily units in the fourth quarter of 2025, trailing only New York City, Dallas/Fort Worth, Phoenix and Atlanta nationwide, according to CoStar. Those units represent a hundredth of Austin\u2019s entire multifamily inventory, putting Austin in second place nationally for the strongest absorption as a percentage of supply, trailing Charlotte.\nMeanwhile, the multifamily pipeline has slowed dramatically. CoStar projects a 47 percent decline in unit deliveries this year.\nOn the single-family side, most of the depreciation in the area has taken place in\nexurbs\nlike Round Rock, Kyle and Georgetown, one of the fastest-growing cities in the country three years ago.\nSale prices in Austin city limits generally held flat\n.\nSimilarly, prices in certain luxury enclaves also changed little. The average home sale price wobbled by just one percent between 2024 and 2025 in Westlake, and it actually rose marginally in Downtown.\nOf course,\na vast portion of Austin luxury deals go unrecorded on the Multiple Listing Service\n, obscuring the full picture of top-tier resi trends. The city\u2019s always been a hotspot for hidden gigs, after all.\nCourtroom drama\nColony Ridge \u2014 the Houston-area master-planned community that\u2019s been taking lumps left and right, politically \u2014 received another blow this week.\nSettling a federal lawsuit begun in 2023, the developers of Colony Ridge\nagreed\nto invest $48 million in infrastructure improvements and $20 million in law enforcement support.\nThe Biden administration alleged in the original suit that Colony Ridge targeted Hispanic buyers with deceptive advertising and predatory mortgages. Republican leaders floated suspicions that Colony Ridge was facilitating cartel crime and \u201c\nallowing illegal aliens to run rampant on its streets\n,\u201d according to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.\nDowntown divestiture for Nate Paul?\nMeanwhile, Paxton associate\nNate Paul may soon give up two Downtown Austin properties\n.

        "content": "Parking lots can be the most vanilla of commercial real estate assets, but they can be spicy when they\u2019re at the center of a complaint about an alleged conspiracy.\nCriscione Meyer Entitlement, which owns six downtown Los Angeles surface parking lots that total about 69,000 square feet, has sued three parking entities \u2014 all of which appear to be sister companies connected to Richard Ulemann Sr. \u2014\u00a0 over a loan dispute involving said lots near L.A. Live off the 110 Freeway, and have entitlements for redevelopment as affordable residential.\nHere are the twists and turns:\nPlaintiff Criscione Meyer Entitlement (CME) purchased the six parcels from defendant 110 West Properties out of bankruptcy for $22 million five years ago. The purchase price was paid via a loan obtained by CME in the amount of $10 million and secured by a deed of trust. The remaining $12 million was paid via a promissory note payable to the seller, 110 West, and secured by a second deed of trust. Then, CME became a landlord to 110 West, and later to defendants Shamrock Parking and Classic Parking, which the complaint calls \u201cco-conspirators\u201d and \u201calter egos\u201d of Ulemann.\nSome time passed, some extensions on the debt was granted, and CME eventually negotiated a deal to pay off that $12 million loan for just $500,000, per the complaint. CME claims 110 West accepted the $500,000 payoff in writing but then sold its $12 million note on the property to Classic Parking. Classic Parking then refused to honor the $500,000 payoff agreement.\nCME alleges this was a breach of contract and part of a coordinated effort to block the refinancing of five parcels and a sale of one to an electric vehicle fast charging company for about $11 million. (CME accused the lessees and defendants of illegally occupying the space because their lease is up and they owe rent, too).\n\u201cEach of them, knowingly and willfully conspired and agreed to cause financial hardship to CME by inducing 110 West to breach its discounted payoff agreement with CME and instead assign the $12 million note to Classic Parking,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cDefendants, and each of them, furthered the conspiracy and lent aid and encouragement by directing 110 West to repudiate the discounted payoff agreement with CME and instead sell the $12 million note to Classic, thereby aiding and abetting the tortious interference with CME\u2019s contractual rights.\u201d\nThe complaint continues: \u201cThe conduct of defendants in conspiring was, and is, fraudulent, oppressive and malicious.\u201d\nCME wants the court to force defendants to accept $500,000 and release the $12 million deed of trust, keep them from foreclosing while the case is pending and evict them. It also is seeking $5 million in damages.\nThe attorney for the plaintiff and a representative for the three related parking entities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nWhat we know beyond the litigation is that CME has been trying to sell the parking lots for years. The real estate came on the\nmarket\nin Aug. 2023 with an ask of $23 million. A source familiar with the matter said the parcels will trade for less.\nOne of the parcels is in contract and the others are in negotiations, per Patrick Sharples, a broker with Keller Williams via G&amp;S Group, who holds the offering. They could all close later this year, but it\u2019s unclear whether litigation will influence an outcome.\nThe real estate can be redeveloped and, because they\u2019re near L.A. Live, there\u2019s potential for apartments or a hotel. But neither pencil out, according to Sharples. He said he has talked with developers because the parcels are eligible for ED1, an emergency order by Mayor Karen Bass that streamlines the approval process for developments that are 100 percent deed-restricted affordable housing. The numbers didn\u2019t make sense, he said. When it comes to a hotel, the lots aren\u2019t zoned for that, so nothing would be completed before the World Cup or Olympics.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the lots won\u2019t eventually be redeveloped, but they may stay just parking lots for a bit.\nHamlet-esque\nOceanwide Plaza creditors are having their \u201cto be or not to be\u201d moment. After a federal bankruptcy judge greenlit a settlement ending a lender-versus-lender war, creditors have a\nchoice\n: Make their own or joint credit bids and attempt to complete the stalled mega-development or sell it off in hopes of recouping their losses, a person with knowledge of the matter told\nThe Real Deal\n. That decision is imminent, the source said. LA Downtown Investment, funded via EB-5 investors, and Lendlease, the one-time general contractor, are the two major parties. We\u2019ll see if they persist or ditch.\nKilroy trims exposure\nKilroy Realty reported\nearnings\nearlier this week, and a lot of chatter was about a big buy and sale in San Diego, but let\u2019s take a look at Los Angeles. Chief Executive Angela Aman, on the fourth-quarter earnings call, said Los Angeles is where the real estate investment trust has completed most of its portfolio modification after selling 501 Santa Monica and Sunset Media Center in the heart of Hollywood, and buying Maple Plaza in Beverly Hills, which is still one of her best talking points to date. Going forward, however, expect more action as it rejiggers in L.A., where Kilroy still is facing a little more than 400,000 square feet in lease expiration this year.\n",

        "content": "There\u2019s a common belief these days that there\u2019s nowhere left to build in the city.\nBut Rockrose Development\u2019s $100 million purchase of a Brooklyn city block, which closed Friday, shows that\u2019s not entirely true \u2014 it just might not be easy.\nThe sale follows Rockrose dropping $65 million on a neighboring parcel in Cobble Hill that had been the site of many plans and zero apartments. Both sites were once the home of Long Island College Hospital, which Rockrose has now pieced back together.\nAn entity tied to LICH and SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University sold Rockrose the most recent site, which covers 363 Hicks Street, 365 Hicks Street, 97 Amity Street and 340 Henry Street. Newmark\u2019s Dan O\u2019Brien and Jimmy Kuhn brokered the sale.\nMadison Realty Capital owned the other site at 91-95 Pacific Street. The lender had bought it from Fortis Property Group after the developer\u2019s plans for the parcels failed to materialize and it faced foreclosure on its $48 million loan.\nFortis seemed to have bought first and planned second.\nIts initial rezoning vision was shot down by then-City Council member Brad Lander, who was looking for more affordable housing and community benefits than Fortis seemed equipped to provide. Meanwhile, the developer became locked up in a lawsuit with SUNY over what the college claims was Fortis\u2019 failure to close on a second part of the deal that would have served as a medical campus for New York University.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Rockrose may not need to pursue a rezoning and has now pieced together a prime stretch of real estate for a multi-family development. It also successfully navigated the New York State Attorney General\u2019s office, which had to approve the purchase, given the non-profit involved in the sale.\nWhile the deals don\u2019t quite amount to adaptive reuse, they show that there\u2019s still plenty of prime real estate for developers who know what to do with it.\nNow if only there was a new plan for that\nleaning tower in FiDi\n\u2026\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Home sales in January were disappointing and one economist blamed it on the weather.

The store is only open through Sunday and stocked with Kirkland-brand olive oil and milk that seemed to have been purchased by a nearby Aldi. One shopper told the outlet they spent 11 hours in line for $120 worth of free groceries.\n\u2014 A Long Island town issued a three-month ban on new pickleball courts, Newsday\nreported\n. Glen Cove\u2019s City Council voted unanimously to prevent residents from putting new courts on their property, mostly to quell complaints about noise. But the courts aren\u2019t gone forever. The local law was put in place so that the city can undertake a \u201cthorough examination of the impacts playing pickleball may pose to city residents.\u201d\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$57 million\nfor 70 Vestry Street, PHS.

        "content": "Chikoo Patel and Shai Wolkowicki have once again drawn the wrath of Old National Bank, as the investors face at least the second foreclosure from the lender as their own infighting rages on in multiple court battles.\nOld National Bank filed a foreclosure\nlawsuit this week targeting a mixed-use multifamily and retail property suited for ground-floor medical or dental office space at 316-324 Lake Street in Oak Park, according to public records.\nThe bank alleges that the duo, operating through Halsted South Partners, LLC, defaulted on a debt totaling approximately $2.32 million. According to the complaint, the borrowers failed to make monthly installments starting in November 2025, prompting the lender to accelerate the debt and seek a receiver to take over the property\u2019s management while the court case plays out.\nThe Oak Park filing is just the latest headache for\nPatel and Wolkowicki\n, whose partnership has dissolved into a thicket of litigation and allegations of financial misconduct. Old National is already pursuing a $16 million foreclosure against the pair for a larger multifamily property downstate in Springfield, a case that remains pending in court.\nThe broader collapse began with the implosion of Patel\u2019s firm, CKO Real Estate, which fashioned itself as an experienced property manager prepared to operate South and West Side multifamily buildings in challenging Chicago neighborhoods. It raised money from people who said they depended on CKO to handle repairs, rent collection and working with tenants in affordable housing programs funded by state and federal sources.\nBut multiple investors \u2014 including Wolkowicki and his wife Lauren Lampert, who have Chicago roots but now live in Boca Raton, Florida \u2014 have sued Patel, alleging he misappropriated or \u201cstole\u201d roughly millions of dollars from various businesses. Wolkwowicki and Lampert specifically claim Patel wasted over $10 million in investment capital by mismanaging properties and siphoning funds away from business operations into his own personal accounts.\nThe unraveling has also caught the attention of corporate creditors; American Express recently sued Patel for unpaid credit card debt of more than $63,000 as his firm\u2019s portfolio faced a wave of building code violations and habitability complaints from tenants.\nWolkowicki didn\u2019t return requests for comment and Patel and an attorney for Patel didn\u2019t return requests for comment. Patel\u2019s lawyer has previously said his client denies Wolkowicki\u2019s allegations.\nWhile the two were once frequent collaborators, Wolkowicki has another once-productive relationship that has soured into a legal civil war. Last year, Wolkowicki\nfiled a separate lawsuit pitting him against Mitch Goltz\n, the former partner in their old firm GW Properties, which has been selling off real estate throughout Chicagoland to wind down.\nGoltz, who now heads the firm GTZ Development, declined to comment on the dispute with Wolkowicki, which centers around how Goltz handled the distribution of proceeds from last year\u2019s\n$31 million sale of the Church Street Plaza\nproperty in Evanston. Goltz reiterated a separate\nforeclosure suit he and Wolkowicki are facing on a LaGrange property\nthat remains in the GW portfolio, filed by a venture of Chicago real estate firm Wolcott Group, and is still in the process of being resolved through new financing.\nWhile Wolkowicki deals with the fallout of his distressed multifamily holdings, Goltz is pivoting toward big redevelopment further west into the suburbs. GTZ is in talks to bring an\nAmazon large-store retail format and an Ashley Furniture store\nto an office campus in Oak Brook that his firm\nacquired at a deep discount out of distress\n. The seven office buildings on the property may be torn down to make way for the retailers.\nHowever, legal and financial pressures mark a downturn for Wolkowicki, who previously made headlines for reasons outside of real estate. In 2014, he was a victim in a boating accident on Lake Michigan that killed three of his friends, leaving him stranded on the water only to be discovered the next day. He was the sole survivor who was aboard the watercraft, whose fractional ownership company, insurers and repair company agreed in 2018 to a $27.9 million settlement with Wolkowicki and the estates of the other victims.\nThe next court date in the lawsuit Wolkowicki brought against Patel is scheduled for a March 9 hearing.\n",

        "content": "While the headlines in post-Super Bowl San Francisco were taken up by an extended teachers\u2019 strike that kept children out of school all week, Mayor Daniel Lurie \u2014 whose own frustrations with the strike fed the news cycle \u2014 quietly signed what could end up as one of the most impactful pieces of housing legislation in his tenure.\nOn Thursday, Lurie formally established a new public financing program he hopes will incentivize the conversion of the old office buildings of San Francisco\u2019s urban core into housing. The so-called Downtown Revitalization Financing District will direct increases in property tax revenue toward annual incentive payments for eligible conversion projects. The district\u2019s boundaries include the Financial District, Union Square, and parts of the Market Corridor and SOMA.\nSan Francisco rose as the poster child for the pandemic\u2019s decimation of America\u2019s traditional central business districts. Cities across the country concluded that a resilient downtown meant a transition from a strictly commercial center into a more mixed-use neighborhood. Thus, converting office towers into apartments was viewed as a key strategy. However, these projects proved expensive and logistically complex. Like some other cities, San Francisco has seen zero conversions, despite the hyped up potential.\nThe tax increment financing district set up by Lurie and the San Francisco Board of Supervisors could put more than $1.2 billion of redirected property tax increases into these projects over the next 30 years, according to city documents. The city estimates that about 50 buildings within the district could make for a good conversion, with the potential to add up to 7,000 new homes. One source inside the city\u2019s Office of Economic and Workforce Development\ntold the San Francisco Chronicle\nthat the typical project could receive about $100,000 per unit in incentives.\nYet, conversions are most feasible when the commercial real estate market has hit the floor, and investors can purchase old towers for steep discounts. Over the last year, the city\u2019s\ncommercial real estate market has bounced back profoundly\n. However, much of that activity has been confined to Class A and trophy buildings, which has left mid-to-low tier office towers,\nsuch as the one at 260 California Street,\nwith big question marks looming overhead.\nNew life for capped taxes\nSince it went into effect nearly three years ago,\nMeasure United to House L.A.\nhas drawn the attention of housing developers up and down California. Approved by voters in Los Angeles, ULA, which implements a 4-to-5.5 percent real estate transfer tax on home sales of greater than $5 million, has been criticized for stalling new housing construction in the city. Late last month, the\nLos Angeles City Council rejected proposed amendments to the legislation\n\u2014 which would have to be approved by voters \u2014 that would have carved out exemptions to the tax for multifamily properties.\nThwarted development in Los Angeles has seemed to fuel interest in a statewide limit on local real estate transfer taxes. A petition is now circling the state that asks whether they want to vote capping real estate transfer taxes throughout California. If it qualifies, which the president of the sponsoring Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association told CalMatters he is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about, Californians would vote on the tax cap in November. The League of California Cities estimates the measure, if approved, could trim tax revenue up to $3 billion per year, with the shortfall spread over municipalities big and small.\nYet, it may not be the only citizen-initiated tax limit on the ballot in November. Earlier this week, a petition began making its way through California that would exempt homeowners 60 and older from paying property taxes on their primary residence. According to the Secretary of State\u2019s office, the initiative could cost local governments and school districts up to $20 billion per year.\nCalifornia homeowners already enjoy the benefits of Prop 13. Passed in 1978 after a tax revolt, Prop 13 changed the landscape of homeownership in California, as it tightly limited how much a home\u2019s assessed value could increase. It is essentially rent control for owners. The legislation has resulted in fewer houses hitting the market, and has been cited as exacerbating the state\u2019s housing crisis.\n",

        "content": "Hilton &amp; Hyland\nlost its managing director, and you could call industry reaction to the latest in the brokerage\u2019s saga muted to say the least.\nSteve Katz, who joined the brokerage a\u00a0 little over a year ago, exited quietly shortly after New Year\u2019s Day, and was succeeded by Felix Pena.\nA lack of buzz about the latest twist at Hilton &amp; Hyland calls into question the brokerage\u2019s relevance in the market, and it comes off of what could be viewed as a particularly tough stretch for the business. That includes agent and executive departures, a lawsuit from what is now Hilton &amp; Hyland\u2019s former landlord over alleged unpaid rent, and a move to smaller offices on Maple Drive in Beverly Hills\u2019s Golden Triangle.\nInterestingly, the Maple Drive address is the same building where Hilton Hilton \u2014 the brokerage led by Hilton &amp; Hyland co-founder Rick Hilton \u2014 has set up shop. That business also seems to be at its own inflection point.\nThe Real Deal\nreported earlier this month The Agency poached\nJustin Alexander\nand two of his team members from Hilton Hilton. That\u2019s left the brokerage with an agent headcount of four, according to records pulled from the California Department of Real Estate on Friday.\nOn the primaries\nWant another example of a muted reaction from this past week? Look no further than L.A.\u2019s mayoral race, which saw Fourth District Councilmember\nNithya Raman\n\u2019s last-minute entry about a week ago.\nIf residential real estate cared about this latest development for the June primaries, the industry hid it well.\nRaman, a Democratic Socialists of America member, turned the heads of some within real estate late last month with her proposed\nMeasure United to House L.A.\ncarveouts, which mainly speak to commercial developers. That\u2019s a 15-year exemption from the tax for newly built multifamily, commercial and mixed-use projects. For existing commercial and residential properties, the proposed amendments do little outside a carveout in instances of a natural disaster. This could explain the largely silent reaction to the latest development at city hall.\nStill, when it comes to mayor of Los Angeles, the question is whether the industry\u2019s residential segment will offer a collective \u2014 or at least stronger \u2014 voice on the matter.\nWhat people are saying\nIn residential real estate, market dynamics are often oversimplified to either a buyer\u2019s or seller\u2019s market. What\u2019s playing out right now is more nuanced.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019 Jonathan Mogharrabi and Marci Kays are coming off a busy week in which they closed on\ntwo Los Feliz properties\n. That\u2019s no easy feat in an Eastside market Mogharrabi described as being more \u201csensitive\u201d in terms of deal flow. It\u2019s not that the market is slow, he said. It could be that the sell strategy of other listings may be missing the mark or buyer expectations.\nWhat he\u2019s saying holds weight considering he and Kays just double ended Wednesday\u2019s closing of Fear of God founder and designer Jerry Lorenzo\u2019s Los Feliz home at 2401 Nottingham Avenue for $8.6 million. Then, on Friday, the two represented the buyer and seller on 2720 Glendower Avenue for $7.4 million.\nWhat Mogharrabi is saying lines up with a point Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Nicole Plaxen noted last month when the listing at\n1200 Bel Air Road\nwas reduced to just under $100 million. That price cut wasn\u2019t the result of no buyer interest, she pointed out. Instead, it was about meeting \u201ctoday\u2019s buyer mindset.\u201d\nLA\u2019s condo market\nNext week sales are expected to resume on the former Pendry Residences, now called the\nSun Rose Residences\n.\nThere are a dozen units left at the 40-residence property sitting at 8420 Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood. They\u2019ll be priced from $4.3 million to $8 million and range from 3,010 square feet to 4,656 square feet of interior space.\nCondo building relaunches and resets are not an anomaly in a market often viewed as less mature than New York or Miami. Salespeople like to talk about the demand for security and services at a condo tower that are supposedly boosting local demand, but one can\u2019t turn away from all the about-faces on strategies to sell.\nLast June,\nTRD\nreported on the\nreintroduction\nof the Mandarin Oriental Residences in Beverly Hills and The Harland in West Hollywood. Each property has its own reason for the why behind the retooling. Part of it was a pricing mismatch. Sometimes it comes down to understanding the market and what amenities make sense.\nAll that to say, it will be interesting to see what\u2019s in store for when the Aman Residences \u2014 the ultra-luxe condos at Cain\u2019s\nOne Beverly Hills\nmixed-use project \u2014 are delivered to the market.\n",

        "content": "The multimillion-dollar fraud case at the Hammocks, Florida\u2019s second-largest homeowners\u2019 association, is in its fourth year. Yet, a trial date remains elusive.\nIn 2022, five people were\narrested\nover allegations that former board members hired bogus contractors and diverted payments, including to ex-board President Marglli Gallego and her husband, Jose Gonzalez, who allegedly led some of the fake vendors, court filings say. Three more people \u2013\u2013 two of them Gallego relatives \u2013\u2013 were later\ncharged\n. Two of the ex-board members originally arrested have since switched to guilty pleas and cooperated with investigators.\nThe remaining six defendants maintain their not guilty pleas. Gallego, painted as the ringleader by prosecutors, is the only one still in jail after being\ndenied bond\n.\nSince the initial charges, the West Kendall HOA went through\nreceivership\n, multiple civil suits and board elections. The criminal case? It periodically pops up for brief status hearings that shed no light on when trial will begin. Sometimes, hearings are postponed, including one for Feb. 6 moved to Tuesday.\n\u201cWe all want a conclusion,\u201d said Ana Danton, one of the roughly 18,000 Hammocks residents.\nAt issue:\nHOA\nfraud cases are massive, involving voluminous evidentiary files, and many witnesses and subpoenas, experts say. The problem is especially pronounced at the Hammocks due to its size and the fact that the HOA kept paper records. The court called it a \u201cmonster\u201d case.\nBy last spring, the state submitted its final evidence, so Judge Laura Cruz called on defense attorneys to schedule depositions and said that continually blaming the amount of paperwork would eventually become\n\u201cproblematic.\n\u201d Gallego\u2019s attorney,\nSabino Jauregui\n, countered the state had years to review files but the defense gets\nmonths.\nHe then filed a motion to disqualify or recuse Cruz, which was denied. (Judge Andrea Ricker Wolfson now presides, which a court spokesperson previously said was due to regular judge rotation.)\nJauregui and most defense attorneys didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Gonzalez\u2019s attorney declined to comment.\nGeorge Pallas, an attorney for\nIvan Dario Diez\n, accused of posing as a vendor, said the state controls the investigation\u2019s pace and built its case \u201cincrementally,\u201d hence Diez\u2019s 2024 arrest, showing \u201cthe probe is still active and evolving.\u201d\n\u201cMy client is entitled to a complete picture of the evidence, not piecemeal revelations that keep extending the proceedings,\u201d said Pallas, who has said Diez did legitimate work and was targeted by others who took plea deals.\nFor Hammocks residents, the protracted case has been years in the making. It took five years after investigators started poking into the HOA for the 2022 charges to be filed.\n\u201cWe want it to end, and it\u2019s been so long,\u201d Danton said.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill California\u2019s wealth tax send even more billionaires fleeing to South Florida? Last week, news\nspread\nthat Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, are under contract for an Indian Creek trophy manse, following in the footsteps of Jeff Bezos and his wife, Lauren Sanchez. Send me a note at\nlidia.dinkova@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential:\nA trust tied to David MacNeil, founder of WeatherTech, paid $68.3 million for the oceanfront mansion at 1940 South Ocean Boulevard in Manalapan. Frank and Dolores Mennella sold the property; Frank Mennella is a retired automotive warranty executive.\nCommercial\n: In Palm Beach County, Dalfen Industrial offloaded a warehouse complex at 1673 and 1715 Meathe Drive for $79.6 million. Boston-based Cabot bought the Turnpike Logistics Center, comprising a 124,500-square-foot building and another 193,000-square-foot building.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nA waterfront mansion under construction on the Sunset Islands hit the market for $85 million. The 16,000-square-foot home at\n1649 West 22nd Street\nin Miami Beach is being developed by real estate investor Fred Karlton. The Corcoran Group\u2019s Julian Johnston is the listing agent. The property includes more than 150 feet of water frontage and a 6,000-square-foot understory level with a climate-controlled garage and space for a gym and storage. A company led by Fred and Aaron Karlton paid $19 million for the nearly half-acre property in 2024.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\nA bill that would curb Florida local governments\u2019 power to enact climate change policies passed a House committee. HB 1217 would ban the adoption and implementation of \u201cnet-zero policies,\u201d according to\nFlorida Phoenix\n. Over a dozen local governments, including South Miami, have already committed to a 100 percent clean renewable energy power portfolio.\nElsewhere in Florida\nFloridians may get to cast ballots on property tax rollbacks in November, after all. Three out of the seven\nproposed constitutional amendments\nmoved forward this legislative session,\nAxios Tampa Bay reports\n. The measures, which still need House and Senate approval, would phase out taxes by increasing exemptions over a 10-year period, increase homestead exemptions by $200,000 for homeowners with \u201ccomprehensive\u201d property insurance, and transition county and municipal tax assessments to every three years, with maximum increases of 3 percent for primary homes and 15 percent on all other properties.\nAJ\u2019s Jewelry, a Palmetto Bay jewelry store owned by Anthony Machado \u2013\u2013 aka \u201cKing of Bling\u201d \u2013\u2013 and popular among athletes and celebrities, alleges retired boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. hasn\u2019t paid nearly $1.4 million from an August shopping spree for gold chains, luxury watches and a gold bracelet,\nMiami New Times reports\n. Mayweather\u2019s attorney didn\u2019t respond to the publication\u2019s request for comment.\nSouth Florida\u2019s ever-present battle with its reputation as a party hotspot continues. Miami-Dade County commissioners will vote next week whether to make it easier to ticket boaters playing loud music after 11 p.m.,\nMiami Herald reports\n.

        "content": "Ron Perelman is one step closer to shedding his worldly possessions.\nThe billionaire sold his Upper East Side townhouse at 36 East 63rd Street for $46.75 million, a source close to the deal told\nThe Real Deal\n. The townhouse had been asking $49.5 million.\nThe Modlin Group\u2019s Adam Modlin and Brown Harris Stevens\u2019 Sami Hassoumi had the listing. Leslie Garfield\u2019s Matt Lesser represented the buyer.\nPerelman listed the home for $60 million in 2021 during a period in which he sold off many of his assets in an attempt to live a \u201csimpler life.\u201d In 2022, he sold his Hamptons estate for\n$84 million\n.\nHis 40-foot-wide Neo Georgian Mansion proved harder to unload, and the listing rotated through a number of the top townhouse brokers in the city.\nPerelman initially tried to sell both the larger home and an attached smaller townhouse for\n$75 million in 2020\n, before listing his 16,000-square-foot house separately in\nApril 2021\n. Both listings were with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Serena Boardman.\nBHS\u2019 Paula Del Nunzio joined as a co-broker several months later. In 2023, John Burger and Sami Hassoumi of BHS\ntook over the listing\nat the same $60 million price tag.\nThe next year, Modlin replaced Burger. He and Hassoumi kept the home priced at $60 million until finally lowering the price to $55 million in October 2024, and then to its last asking price of $49.5 million in June 2025.\nThe property had served as Perelman\u2019s primary residence for years. Built in 1930, it once served as a private club for aviators, known as the Hangar Club. The home has 10 bedrooms and more than 10 bathrooms across its three floors. It has a private screening room, a home gym, a wine cellar and a landscaped roof.\nAt one point in the 1980s, Perelman was considered the richest man in America. His firm, MacAndrews &amp; Forbes, owned a number of high-profile brands, including Marvel Comics and later, Revlon. The firm suffered during the pandemic as Revlon\u2019s share price plummeted from $25 to $5. It was during this time that Perelman sold a number of his personal assets, including planes, yachts and part of his art collection.\nThe townhouse is the latest in what has been a string of marquee Upper East Side homes to sell after years on the market.\nLast year, the\nWoolworth Mansion\nat 4 East 80th Street sold for $38 million after asking as high as $90 million back in 2011. Less than one block away from Perelman\u2019s home, Oleg Cassini\u2019s former townhouse, which one asked $65 million, is awaiting court approval for a sale after receiving\nan offer of $35 million\nlast fall.",

The sellers were\nPhillipe and Josette Pommez\n, and the buyers were\nRobert and Sandra Bonfield.\nThe oceanfront unit spans about 4,200 square feet and has three bedrooms, four and a half bathrooms, a balcony and three parking spaces. The condo last sold in 2016, for $7.3 million; it went on the market in November, with an asking price of $12.9 million.\nEthan Assouline\nwith Douglas Elliman represented both sides of the deal.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe priciest commercial transaction recorded in the tri-county region was for an industrial property at\n5650 Anglers Avenue\nin Fort Lauderdale, which sold for $16 million. The property spans 72,500 square feet, pricing the sale at roughly $220 per square foot. It last sold in 2010, for $5.2 million. The seller in the latest deal was an entity managed by\nEdward T. Stephens\n, who also owned Stephens Distributing Company, a beverage distributor that occupied the space until last year. The buyer was an entity managed by\nDavid Weiss\nof Brooklyn.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nIn Boca Raton, an 8,500-square-foot mansion at\n681 Golden Harbour Drive\ntraded for $12.3 million. The seller was an LLC managed by\nAnthony Cicardo\n, founder of Boca Raton-based Cicardo Development, and the buyer was a trust.

While more homeowners are falling behind on payments, the rate of loans starting the\nforeclosure\nprocess held relatively steady compared to the quarter and year before, at about 0.2 percent.\nMississippi had the highest 90-day delinquency rate, of 2.66 percent, and the highest 30-day delinquency rate, of 3.98 percent. Both rates increased the most quarter over quarter in the country, by 26 basis points (90 days) and by 44 basis points (30 days).\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "High-profile Chicago real estate industry figures are pouring donations into the Cook County Board President\u2019s race, but are showing less of a united front than they are in the\nTax Assessor\u2019s race,\ncampaign finance data shows.\nChicago Alderman Brendan Reilly, who represents much of the Loop and River North, is challenging longtime incumbent Toni Preckwinkle in the Democratic primary for Cook County Board President, which is set for March 17.\nAs final donations roll in, industry leaders including Fifield Companies\u2019 Steve Fifield, Riverside Investment\u2019s John O\u2019Donnell, Hubbard Street Group\u2019s John McLinden, developer Scott Greenberg, Waterton CEO David Schwartz, Equity Commonwealth REIT CEO David Helfand and members of\nbillionaire Neil Bluhm\u2019s family\nare some of Reilly\u2019s most prominent real estate donors. Neil Bluhm, his son Andrew and daughter Meredith Bluhm each gave $17,000 to the Reilly campaign.\nOne of Reilly\u2019s most impactful real estate donors is former Cinespace owner-turned-real estate investor and lender\nAlexander Pissios\nwho gave the campaign $50,000. Other business community donors include trading and real estate investment firm DRW\u2019s founder\nDon Wilson\nand Lettuce Entertain You restaurant group founder Rich Melman.\nWhile Preckwinkle has courted fewer industry heavy-hitters than Reilly, she still secured some donations from prominent real estate names, including\nCapri Investment\u2019s Quintin Primo\nand Clayco\u2019s Michael Fassnacht. She has also enjoyed broad support from construction companies and trade unions like The Chicago Federation of Labor and the International Association of Operating Engineers.\nReilly has raised at least $609,000 since the start of 2026, when his campaign had over $1.2 million on hand, compared to Preckwinkle raising at least $480,000 raised since the start of the year, when she had more than $614,000 in campaign cash, according to state campaign finance reports.\nThe labor and business split is a departure from patterns seen in donations in the Cook County Tax Assessor\u2019s race. Both groups are coalescing around challenger Patrick Hynes instead of incumbent Fritz Kaegi, a recent analysis by\nThe Real Deal\nfound.\nBoth Kaegi and Preckwinkle are supported by progressive organization Citizens Action Illinois. But Preckwinkle hasn\u2019t faced as much public scrutiny as Kaegi, who has borne the brunt of the blame from real estate investors frustrated by\nwild fluctuations in Cook County tax bills\nsince the pandemic. Preckwinkle also secured a $150,000 donation from Governor J.B. Pritzker.\nFurther, she\ncommissioned a study of Chicago\u2019s property tax system\nmore broadly with a goal of making the process more predictable for investors and homeowners alike. Kaegi has said he supports the recommendations in the study, which includes improving communication and data sharing between the tax assessor and the Board of Review so that initial assessments and appealed assessments\ndon\u2019t vary as widely as they do now\n.\nMeanwhile, Reilly, a moderate Democrat on Chicago City Council, is running a critical campaign against Preckwinkle amid backlash against progressives more generally. As Chicago\u2019s progressive\nMayor Brandon Johnson struggles\nto maintain support, real estate figures have been strategizing ways to regain influence in local politics.\nReilly has tried to pin blame on Preckwinkle for recently blown deadlines during a technology update for Cook County\u2019s property tax data and billing systems that severely delayed tax bills. The systemic setbacks causing the late tax bills forced local school districts to incur steep interest costs on loans while they waited for their share of tax revenue.\nReilly even suggested he would cancel the county\u2019s long-running contract with Tyler Technologies \u2014 the firm tasked with the tech upgrade \u2014 if the delays persist.\nPreckwinkle has pushed back against this narrative, noting that the property tax system is a multi-agency effort involving other independently elected officials, like the assessor and treasurer, who handle valuations and billing. She maintains that the solution lies in collaborative problem-solving rather than finding fault or attacking colleagues in other departments.\nHer supporters point out she hasn\u2019t raised Cook County\u2019s portion of the property tax levy for her entire tenure, nearly 16 years.\nWhoever wins the March primary is expected to win the general election in November because Cook County is considered a safely Democratic county.",

        "content": "Billionaire John Goff\u2019s firm, Crescent Real Estate, is locking in fresh debt on one of Uptown Dallas\u2019 signature properties.\nThe Fort Worth-based investor secured a $596 million refinancing for The Crescent, a 1.3 million-square-foot mixed-use complex of three interconnected buildings at 100, 200, 300 and 500 Crescent Court. Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan Chase Bank originated the three-year, floating-rate CMBS loan, with JLL Capital Markets arranging it, Commercial Property Executive\nreported\n.\nCrescent\nbought the 10-acre property in 2021 from J.P. Morgan Asset Management for $700 million, or roughly $495 per square foot, according to Yardi Matrix. At the time, Goldman provided a $465 million acquisition loan. Los Angeles-based Gibson Dunn advised Goldman on the latest refinancing.\nLast year,\nCrescent paid\n$292 million for the 21-story\nTexas Capital Center\n, at 2000 McKinney Avenue, in what was the city\u2019s largest office deal in years and the second biggest deal in Dallas-Fort Worth in 2025.\nCompleted in 1983, The Crescent includes three LEED Gold-certified office towers totaling 1.2 million square feet, plus a 167,510-square-foot retail and atrium component, according to the publication. The 18-story and 19-story buildings feature 30,500-square-foot floorplates and a roster of blue-chip tenants, including Jefferies, BankUnited, BMO Harris Bank, Wells Fargo, PNC Bank, Raymond James, UBS, Regus and Dentons. The property was 90 percent leased at closing.\nBeyond office space, the complex functions as a mini mixed-use district. Amenities include a fitness center, art gallery, two salons and a 3,600-space parking garage, according to a news release. The site is also home to 11 restaurants, the Hotel Crescent Court and its adjoining spa.\nElsewhere in Uptown, Crescent closed on CBRE\u2019s 19-story headquarters at\n2100 McKinney Avenue\nin December, with $170.4 million in financing.\nThe refinancing for The Crescent comes as Dallas\u2019 office market shows tentative signs of stabilization. In December, average asking rents hit $32 per square foot, up 2.8 percent, year-over-year, though slightly below the national average of $33, according to Yardi Matrix. Vacancies fell from the same period a year earlier to 21.1 percent \u2014 still above the 18.4 percent national rate, but part of a broader trend that saw 17 of the top 25 U.S. office markets post year-over-year vacancy declines in 2025.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "There\u2019s not much left of Harwood District that still belongs to\nHarwood International\n; after March\u2019s foreclosure sale, there may be even less.\nGabriel Barbier-Mueller\u2019s beleaguered Uptown development firm risks losing a block of condo units at Bleu Ciel, at 3130 North Harwood Street. It marks the first foreclosure of the year for the firm which gave up ownership of seven office properties in 2025 in a spate of foreclosures and sales.\nThe company\u2019s latest predicament involves an alleged default on a loan from TexasBank, according to a foreclosure notice. Loan documents show TexasBank provided a $30 million loan in December 2024 backed by 26 units at Bleu Ciel. Since the loan was provided, at least six units were sold, causing Harwood to be relieved of parts of its debt burden.\nHowever, the fact that Harwood still owns any condos at the property appears to indicate that about 10 percent of the property\u2019s 158 units never originally sold \u2014 eight years after Bleu Ciel opened in 2018. The property\u2019s website says it\u2019s 85 percent sold and advertises 16 units, including four penthouses.\nThis is the first time Harwood\u2019s distress has bled from its office portfolio into another asset class.\nIt comes a week after San Francisco-based private equity fund TPG announced it would be\nHarwood\u2019s recapitalization partner\n. Harwood quietly sold off five office properties, totalling 1.2 million square feet, to TPG starting in the fall:\nHarwood No. 2, at 2728 North Harwood Street;\nHarwood No. 3, at 2727 North Harwood Street;\nHarwood No. 6 (also known as Saint Ann Court), at 2501 North Harwood Street;\nHarwood No. 7 (also known as Frost Tower), at 2950 North Harwood Street; and\nHarwood No. 10, at 2850 North Harwood Street.\nTPG has plans to renovate the properties. According to the announcement, Harwood retains a minority stake.\nThe firm also lost two properties to foreclosure in 2025.\nIt handed back the keys to\nHarwood No. 4\nin April and lost\nHarwood No. 1\nin November. San Francisco-based Spear Street Capital took back Harwood No. 4, at 2828 North Harwood Street, in a $73 million credit bid.\nFirst United Bank seized\nHarwood\u2019s first development, at 2651 North Harwood Street, with a $27 million credit bid. Bill Cawley\u2019s\nCawley Partners bought the property\non Dec. 30.\nThe\nforeclosures started with Harwood No. 6\n, which Harwood saved from a January 2025 auction with a last-minute recapitalization deal.\nAnother blow came for the company when Jones Day, which was supposed to anchor the upcoming Harwood No. 15,\npulled out of the project\nlate last year.\nThe firm\u2019s distress is glaringly out of sync with Uptown\u2019s otherwise robust office market. The submarket has been a reliable outlier in a region that continues to struggle with\nhigh vacancy rates\n.\nThe coveted submarket has become synonymous with\nY\u2019all Street\n, with banks like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America selecting Uptown for expensive built-to-suit projects. Uptown also boasts the highest rents of any submarket in Dallas-Fort Worth, with an overall average gross rent of $62.21 per square foot, according to a recent report from Partners Real Estate.\n",

Opened in 1976, the Fairfield plant has operated for nearly 50 years as a major brewing, packaging and distribution hub, occupying a prominent site visible from Interstate 80.\nThe shutdown follows a wave of industrial pullbacks across the region from other manufacturers including USS-Posco Industries in Pittsburg, Valero\u2019s refinery in Benicia and the Mare Island dry dock.\nAnheuser-Busch announced the Fairfield closure in December as part of a broader restructuring of its U.S. manufacturing footprint, which also includes shuttering a plant in Merrimack, New Hampshire, and selling its Newark, New Jersey, facility.\nCompany officials said production from the three sites has been shifted to other U.S. breweries following nearly $2 billion in nationwide manufacturing investments.\nCity Manager David Gassaway said officials are already exploring potential reuse options for the highly specialized site, though redevelopment could prove challenging.\n\u201cTo be clear, I don\u2019t think it will be an easy task given the large and highly specialized nature of the facility,\u201d Gassaway said. \u201cI hope I\u2019m wrong though.\u201d\nThe complex spans more than 1 million square feet across 10 parcels and includes solar and gas power infrastructure as well as two wind turbines. Nearby, California Forever is planning a large-scale development east of the brewery along Highway 12.\nState filings show 238 Fairfield employees received layoff notices, per the Business Times, though the company said workers were offered transfers to other facilities. Fairfield Mayor Catherine Moy warned the impacts extend further, estimating that more than 500 workers at auxiliary companies could also be displaced, with millions in lost tax revenue for the city and state.\n\u2014\nLauren Elkies Schram\n",

Her position as president is a new one for the company, which is run on a national scale by longtime Elliman executive,\nSusan de Fran\u00e7a\n.\nElliman CEO Michael Liebowitz billed Chagan\u2019s move as a \u201cbig victory\u201d for the firm, which has lost several of its top agents and leaders following the\nabrupt retirement\nof Elliman\u2019s longtime leader, Howard Lorber, in October 2024. Liebowitz took the helm shortly after with the promise of\nushering in a \u201cnew era\u201d\nfor the firm.\nLiebowitz said that establishing Chagan as a leader in the New York region joins his efforts to double down on the company\u2019s development sector, which he described as Elliman\u2019s \u201cmarquee crown jewel.\u201d He added that the firm plans to invest in its New York operations specifically.\n\u201cDevelopers are demanding, and we want to meet that demand,\u201d Liebowitz said. \u201cI\u2019m bullish on New York. New development in New York is going to be much stronger than people believe.\u201d\n",

        "content": "SL Green Realty is stacking up wins at one of its Sixth Avenue towers.\nPatent law firm Groombridge, Wu, Baughman &amp; Stone inked a 43,000-square-foot lease at\n1185 Sixth Avenue\n, the landlord announced. The 10-year deal spans the entire 37th floor and part of the 36th floor at the 42-story tower. The asking rent was not disclosed.\nJLL\u2019s Lisa Kiell and Andrew Coe represented the tenant in the deal, which was first reported by the New York Post. A Newmark team including Brian Waterman, Jonathan Fanuzzi and Brent Ozarowski represented the landlord.\nThe transaction is part of a recent flurry of activity at the 1.1 million-square-foot building, which is now 91 percent leased after roughly 110,000 square feet of new deals. The property has faced a wave of turnover over the past few years after\nseveral major tenants\nvacated nearly 700,000 square feet across 25 floors.\nRecent lease signings and pending deals leave just 24,000 square feet of that rollover space to backfill, CEO Marc Holliday said during the firm\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call.\nThe rebound comes as Sixth Avenue emerges as one of Manhattan\u2019s strongest submarkets, with rents rising thanks to constrained supply along Park Avenue.\nManhattan office leasing\nposted its strongest quarter at the end of last year since before the pandemic.\n\u201cSixth Avenue is the new Park Avenue,\u201d Holliday said. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing rents rise dramatically on the avenue, given the tightening of supply.\u201d\nLeasing activity jumped more than 25 percent quarter-over-quarter to 11.9 million square feet, the borough\u2019s most active quarter since late 2019.Demand surged, availability tightened and rents pushed higher across much of the city, according to Colliers data.\nLocated between West 46th and West 47th streets in the Plaza District, 1185 Sixth Avenue sits steps from Rockefeller Center and major transit hubs. SL Green overhauled the 1.1 million-square-foot 1971 building with a newly-renovated entryway, lobby, elevator cabs and corridor to compete with gleaming new developments.\nGroombridge, Wu, Baughman &amp; Stone did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",

        "content": "The family of former Texas state Sen. Don Huffines quietly acquired the late Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s infamous Zorro Ranch in New Mexico in 2023, four years after the disgraced financier\u2019s death in federal custody.\nA limited liability company tied to the Huffines family bought the property at public auction in 2023 for an undisclosed price. The purchase was first\nreported\nby the Santa Fe New Mexican, which cited public records obtained through information requests. According to the paper, proceeds from the sale benefited Epstein\u2019s victims, the Texas Tribune\nreported\n.\nAs previously reported in\nThe Real Deal\n, San Rafael Ranch LLC was\nregistered\nwith New Mexico\u2019s secretary of state office in July of 2023, though its tie to the Huffines family was not revealed at the time.\nThe property, in southern Santa Fe County, features a 26,700-square-foot\u00a0 mansion, private airstrip, hangar, helipad, ranch office, firehouse and heated garage as part of the expansive ranch.\nThe Huffines purchasing entity later challenged the ranch\u2019s tax valuation, arguing it should be reduced to $13.4 million in part because of the property\u2019s \u201cnotoriety,\u201d according to the New Mexican. The records obtained by the publication show the property was renamed in 2024 to San Rafael Ranch and its address is now 49 Rancho San Rafael Road, near Stanley, New Mexico.\nIn a statement Friday, Huffines\u2019 campaign spokesperson Allen Blakemore said the family had \u201cnever visited the property\u201d before it was listed, and purchased it four years after Epstein\u2019s death. In a follow-up statement Monday, Blakemore added that the family has not been contacted by authorities about searching the ranch, but would cooperate if asked.\nAlthough he was never charged in New Mexico, the state\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office had confirmed an investigation into\nEpstein\u2019s activities\nat the ranch. The renewed scrutiny comes after emails recently surfaced alleging that two girls may be buried at or near the property, prompting calls from New Mexico officials for federal and state authorities to open a probe.\nThe deal surfaced as Huffines campaigns for\nTexas comptroller\n, the state\u2019s chief financial officer overseeing taxes and investments. News of the ranch\u2019s ownership also comes as the U.S. Department of Justice released the latest tranche of documents tied to\nEpstein\nrevealing more of the billionaire\u2019s ties to the elected officials and other notable leaders.\nHuffines previously lost a 2022 primary challenge to Gov. Greg Abbott and now faces Acting Comptroller Kelly Hancock, Michael Berlanga and Railroad Commissioner Christi Craddick in the March 3 Republican primary. A poll released this week shows Huffines leading ahead of early voting.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Pakistan is back to square one with its attempt to sell the multi-billion-dollar\nRoosevelt Hotel\nproject site.\nThe government\u2019s privatization commission is once again trying to find a broker to help monetize the development site at 45 East 45th Street, just across from Grand Central Terminal \u2014 which could be redeveloped into a 1.8 million square foot office tower.\nThe commission put out a call for brokers and financial advisors who have \u201cproven experience of successful completion of similar transactions in [the] New York metropolitan area (more specifically in Manhattan\u2013NYC) or any other metropolitan city of [the] USA,\u201d according to a request for proposals.\nThe 1920s era, 1,205-room hotel is a prime office development site that\u2019s available at a time when\ndevelopers\nare\neager\nto build new commercial towers for tenants willing to pay a premium for the newest, best spaces. But the new RFP comes after a few failed attempts to come up with a deal for the site over the past year.\nThe Pakistani government in 2024 hired JLL to market the property either for an outright sale or a joint venture development partnership. JPMorgan kicked the tires and\nShahal Khan\u2019s Burkhan World Investments\npitched a plan to co-develop the site.\nBut no agreement materialized and in July JLL resigned. The company cited a conflict of interest from clients who were interested in bidding on the site. But considering that brokerages deal with that potential conflict every day, the explanation was seen as a gracious way for both sides to part ways.\nPakistani officials at that time said they were intent on fast-tracking the process of hiring a new advisor, and in late November, it was reported that a team of CBRE and Morgan Stanley was the frontrunner to win the assignment. The Pakistani government said there was increased interest in the site after New York City terminated its contract to use the hotel as a migrant shelter.\nBut in January the privatization commission announced that it had hit reset on the hiring process after five of the seven proposals under consideration were rejected for non-compliance. (It\u2019s not clear who the candidates were, but when JLL won the process in 2024, a consortium led by Savills came in second place.)\nAnd this time around, the government has ruled out selling the property outright.\nPakistani prime minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s adviser on privatisation, Muhammad Ali, said the government is intent on redeveloping the property as part of a JV, according to\nmedia reports\n.\nUnder the plan the government would contribute the land into the venture and a development partner would pony up about $1 billion in equity, with the JV taking on another $2 billion to $3 billion in debt. The Pakistani government intends to have an ownership stake of around 40 to 50 percent.\nMany in New York\u2019s development community, however, remain skeptical as Pakistan\u2019s bureaucratic government has waffled over what to do with the hotel since acquiring it in 2000.\nPakistan is privatizing the Roosevelt along with other government-owned assets as part of a $7 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.\n",

The nine-building campus totals roughly 433,000 square feet, putting the deal at $536 per square foot.\nThe deal closes the book on a yearslong effort to transform the aging property into a residential neighborhood, as the entitled site will be redeveloped into over 400 homes.\nA Lennar spokesperson\ndeclined to comment\non the sale to the Orange County Business Journal, but IRA Capital officials confirmed that Lennar will build homes on the site.\nBuilt in 1988, the campus once served as a high-end office complex, but demand never fully recovered after the pandemic.\nIrvine-based IRA bought it in 2023 for $102.4 million from EQ Office, a Chicago unit of New York-based Blackstone. At the time, Kasm told the\nBusiness Journal\n: \u201cThe value of this property is in the land.\u201d\nInitial plans called for an industrial redevelopment. City officials later urged IRA to pivot toward housing as Irvine faced mounting state housing mandates.\nThe city conditionally offered to buy the site for more than $300 million if housing failed to materialize \u2014 a backstop that helped ensure a residential outcome. Ultimately, IRA secured entitlements for 426 homes, including detached houses, townhomes and stacked flats, in what IRA said was an unusually fast approval process.\nIrvine Mayor Larry Agran called the project a step forward in the city\u2019s long-term vision for the business complex, which was rezoned to allow up to 15,000 homes.\nConstruction is expected to begin within months, with completion targeted in 18 to 24 months.\nThe joint venture\u2019s purchase ranks among the most expensive single-property deals in Orange County in recent times. Five Point Holdings sold 326 home sites in Great Park Neighborhoods during the third quarter of 2025,\nfor $257.7 million\n.

        "content": "The prospect of builder\u2019s remedy could return to San Francisco, and one prominent city official wants to get ahead of the possibility by dedicating more funding and land to residential development if necessary.\nSupervisor Chyanne Chen, one of 11 members of the Board of Supervisors, which functions as the legislative body for the city, recently called for an audit of where the city stands on its goals for affordable housing, the\nSan Francisco Business Times reported\n. Inherent in the request is a check-up on whether the city is in line to meet the state-imposed mandate of 47,000 new units of housing by 2031. Missing the mandate, known as the \u201chousing element,\u201d would\ntrigger builder\u2019s remedy\n, which allows developers to skip local zoning approvals provided they include a certain amount of affordable housing in their projects.\nChen said the city\u2019s funds for affordable housing are largely committed or exhausted and noted the cuts to the minimum requirements on how many affordable units must be included in new projects have reduced affordable housing production. A cut in fees has, meanwhile, put a dent in funding, she said.\nChen called for the city to gauge where it stands on meeting its goals under the housing element as the Family Zoning Plan initiated by Mayor Daniel Lurie starts to take effect. The plan would allow significantly more residential development in designated areas of the city, but faces legal challenges.\nPlanning Director Sarah Dennis-Phillips said city staff will report on Chen\u2019s request by the end of the month, with a hearing\u00a0 to review production and funding levels slated for March.\nA recent report by the city noted that the rise in interest rates in recent years and increases in construction costs have put a damper on the development of affordable housing. The city also faces a $1 billion budget deficit.\nChen said the plan San Francisco devised to meet its state mandate on housing included more than 200 policies billed as \u201cadvancing equity\u201d and boosting \u201cpublic investment in affordable units,\u201d but is failing to make full use of them.\n\u201cI am disappointed to see that implementation of these equity-oriented policy actions has been incomplete, opaque and often delayed,\u201d Chen told the Business Times.\n\u2014 Jerry Sullivan\n",

The Chicago Tribune\nreported\nthat they\u2019re now trying to offload their longtime perch atop One Magnificent Mile, listing their 46th-floor penthouse at 950 North Michigan Avenue for $5.5 million after a recent price cut.\nThe Bayers first listed the six-bedroom, roughly 9,000-square-foot duplex penthouse in September for just under $6 million before trimming the asking price in January. The unit carries monthly homeowners association dues of $12,081.\nDesigned by Wheeler Kearns Architects, the condo has seven-inch-wide European white oak floors, Grigio Piesantina limestone, a Crestron lighting system and a sculptural staircase framed by floor-to-ceiling windows, according to the outlet. The great room includes a custom burl wood wet bar and glass wine room, opening to a private terrace. The Valcucine kitchen is outfitted with Sub-Zero and Miele appliances.\nUpstairs, a second-level \u201cwellness and entertainment sanctuary\u201d features a sunroom with a marble-clad wet bar. The primary suite includes a sitting area and two custom walk-in closets. In total, the home has eight full bathrooms and three half baths.\nRyan Preuett and Tim Salm\nof Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty have the listing. The pair also represented the sellers of the Dickens Avenue mansion. It closed at $14.25 million, or about $950 per square foot. The previous owners \u2014 retired Chicago Trading Company executive Paul Kepes and his wife Monica \u2014 spent $20 million to buy the land and build the Lincoln Park property.\nSusan Miner of Premiere Relocation represented the Bayers in that purchase. At the time, the home\u2019s $15 million list price made it the second priciest listing in the city, following a Park Tower penthouse owned by billionaire\nKen Griffin\nlisted at $15.75 million.\nThe couple assembled their\nStreeterville duplex penthouse\nin stages between 2010 and 2014, a period when ultra-luxury condo development along North Michigan Avenue was still regaining its footing post-recession.

Miami\u2019s Urban Development Review Board is expected to vote on the plans Wednesday.\nThe firm is seeking approval for five- and six-story apartment buildings adjacent to the 176-room hotel, a site plan filed with the city of Miami shows.\nDesigned by Coral Gables-based Behar Font &amp; Partners, Regency Parc &amp; Residences would include 208 apartments and a 384-space parking garage. MG Developer paid\n$36 million\nin 2024 for the five-story hotel, which was completed in 1982.\nMG Developer secured a $23 million refinancing last month from New York\u2013based Interaudi Bank, a move that gives the firm funds for a hotel renovation and financial flexibility to start construction on the site\u2019s vacant portions, according to a news release.\nApartments would range from 465-square-foot studios to 890-square-foot two-bedroom units, the site plan shows. One of the planned buildings would also have 2,800 square feet of commercial space.\nTorrealba\u2019s firm, best known for its luxury residential projects in Coral Gables, is diversifying its portfolio with multifamily developments in\nHialeah\nnear public transit terminals and a planned 30-story condominium in\nNorth Bay Village\nwith its partner Miami Beach-based Prosper.\nThe company\u2019s Regency Parc &amp; Residences plan comes as\nSouth Florida\u2019s rental market\ncools from pandemic-era highs.

        "content": "The debt on an office building in West Los Angeles\u2019 Sawtelle Japantown neighborhood landed in special servicing after the borrower failed to pay it off at its January maturity date, according to Morningstar Credit.\nThe named loan sponsor is family-owned Jade Enterprises\u2019 Albert Taban. The commercial mortgage-backed securities debt totaled $36.5 million when originated a decade ago but has a current balance of about $33 million via three loan pieces. The borrower reached out to lenders to pay the debt, according to recent servicer commentary, but indicated there could be a potential issue as a new loan would fall significantly short.\nJade\u2019s latest Los Angeles time bomb at 1950 Sawtelle Boulevard is a three-story, 100,000-square-foot, red-brick building \u2014 and it has a vacancy problem. The property was only 43 percent occupied last summer. Its largest tenant, Butterfield Productions, reduced its space by 10 percent, to 32 percent of the gross leasable area, and another Kung Fu Factory left, leaving 14 percent of the space vacant, according to Morningstar. The borrower said it was in discussions with a tenant for a large portion of the vacant space, recent servicer commentary noted . The office building (that can be used for medical or some retail, per a recent JLL marketing brochure) was 94 percent occupied at underwriting, and it was part of a portfolio buy in 2016.\nJade\npurchased\na five-office building portfolio including the Sawtelle property that totaled 350,000 square feet, from Blackstone for a reported $159 million then. The other offices were all on the Westside, in Beverly Hills, Santa Monica and Culver City. The Sawtelle office building hasn\u2019t received a fresh appraisal since 2016, when it was worth $54 million, per Morningstar.\nDowntown Los Angeles-based Jade Enterprises has seen its fair share of post-pandemic office distress. In 2024, it put a mostly vacant office tower in downtown Los Angeles on the\nmarket\nafter purchasing it for $80 million and spending millions more on renovations. Last year, the investment and development company\nfaced\nforeclosure on an office building in Pasadena after a $40 million debt default and an appraisal that slashed the property value in half.\nJade Enterprises and Taban did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "A planned 1 million-square-foot ICE detention hub in southern Dallas County is off the table for now.\nMajestic Realty Company said Monday it will not sell or lease its Hutchins warehouse to the federal government, backing away from discussions that would have converted the property into one of the largest migrant detention centers in the country,\naccording\nto the Dallas Morning News.\n\u201cGod answered our prayers,\u201d Hutchins Mayor Mario Vasquez told the outlet after learning of the decision.\nU.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, who represents the congressional district that includes Hutchins, released a statement that her office had not received communication from the Department of Homeland Security or ICE regarding the detention center, but that her office has remained in close contact with city officials and other regional elected officials \u201cto ensure a unified and informed response.\u201d\nInternal ICE documents had identified the Majestic-owned PointSouth Logistics &amp; Commerce Centre Building 1, at 950\nI-45 North\n, as a candidate to house up to 9,500 migrants as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s renewed mass deportation push. The facility was one of four proposed new detention centers in Texas, alongside sites in El Paso and San Antonio that the Department of Homeland Security has already acquired, according to the publication.\nIn January,\nmultiple outlets reported\nthat DHS had purchased the Hutchins warehouse with plans to retrofit it for detention use. Majestic pushed back this week, saying it had been contacted about a potential sale but \u201chas not and will not\u201d enter into an agreement with DHS for use as a detention facility. The City of Industry, California-based firm confirmed it still owns the building.\nA Majestic Realty listing for the address shows a building of just over 1 million square feet, aligning with earlier descriptions. The Dallas Central Appraisal District values the property at $80.1 million.\nThe reversal highlights the political and reputational tightrope\nindustrial landlords\nface, as federal agencies look to repurpose big-box logistics space for nontraditional uses. A document from the project\u2019s builder shows the warehouse was originally designed for Amazon. Vasquez said he warned the company that turning the property into a detention center would \u201cdevastate\u201d Hutchins, a small city that has leaned on warehouse development for tax base growth.\nMajestic framed its decision as part of a broader economic strategy, saying it looks forward to finding a buyer or tenant that will \u201chelp drive economic growth.\u201d The firm is one of the largest privately held developers of master-planned business parks in the U.S., with more than 400 buildings totaling about 92 million square feet nationwide. In North Texas, it\u2019s perhaps best known for its role in redeveloping the\nFort Worth Stockyards\n.\nCommunity opposition also played a role. Local leaders warned that Hutchins lacks the water and sewer capacity to support what would effectively double its population overnight, as previously reported in\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe Rev. Eric Folkerth of Kessler Park United Methodist Church told the Dallas Morning News that local pressure and outrage likely influenced the outcome, questioning the need for a \u201cmega center\u201d amid reports that thousands without criminal records would be detained at the site.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "To plug a more than $5 billion budget gap, Mayor Zohran Mamdani sees two options: Either raise taxes on corporations and New York\u2019s wealthiest or increase property taxes by 9.5 percent while tapping into the city\u2019s reserves.\nGov. Kathy Hochul has rejected the former, which requires state action, and the latter, which Mamdani unveiled Tuesday as part of his administration\u2019s preliminary budget, swiftly drew criticism from landlord groups.\n\u201cThis proposal, coupled with Mamdani\u2019s pledge to freeze rents for four years, virtually guarantees the physical destruction of tens of thousands of units of housing,\u201d Kenny Burgos, CEO of the New York Apartment Association, said in a statement.\nJim Whelan, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, said \u201ctax hikes of any kind, including increases to an already egregiously regressive property tax system, to raise revenue or plug budget holes is a non-starter.\u201d\nAnn Korchak, board president of Small Property Owners of New York, said that owners of small rental properties \u201care sick and tired of being treated like ATM machines every time the city needs to balance the budget.\u201d\nWhen presenting his $127 billion preliminary budget, the mayor said that his administration will do everything in its power to avoid the second path, calling raising property taxes the \u201ctool of very last resort.\u201d\n\u201cThe second path is painful,\u201d Mamdani said on Tuesday. \u201cWe will continue to work with Albany to avoid it.\u201d\nHochul didn\u2019t include the mayor\u2019s proposal to increase taxes on corporations or those earning more than $1 million in her own executive budget, and hasn\u2019t shown any appetite for taking up either cause. On Tuesday, she told reporters that she also doesn\u2019t support raising property taxes.\nThe city\u2019s property tax rates ranged from 10.8 to 19.8 percent in fiscal year 2026. The administration estimates that a 9.5 percent increase across the city\u2019s four property classes will increase revenues by $3.7 billion in the next fiscal year.\nThe prospect of property tax hikes comes after Hochul and Mamdani announced on Monday that the state would allocate another $1.5 billion to the city over the next two years, $510 million of which is recurring funding stemming from costs that had shifted from the state to the city in previous years.\nBut that still left the city with an estimated $5.4 billion deficit for fiscal years 2026 and 2027.\nThe mayor\u2019s preliminary budget dips into the city\u2019s rainy day fund, taking $980 million in fiscal year 2026 and $229 million from the city\u2019s Retiree Health Benefit Trust in fiscal year 2027. Taking into account $1.2 billion in general reserves used to bring down the deficit, along with the $980 million in rainy day funds targeted by the mayor\u2019s budget, the city expects to log $6.3 billion in reserves for fiscal 2026, down from a reserve originally pegged at $8.5 billion. For 2027, again accounting for general reserves ($1.1 billion, leaving only $100 million for in-year funds) and a planned raid of the retiree trust, that number is expected to drop to $6.1 billion.\nUsing reserves is a one-time fix that leaves the city with a smaller cushion in the event of recession or other crises. The mayor indicated that the rainy day fund and retiree trust would be replenished by fiscal year 2028, though doing so could be complicated by future economic pressures.\n\u201cAssuming the city will replenish the funds in FY28, when the budget shows a $6.7 billion gap, is at best extremely tenuous and at worst a gamble,\u201d Andrew Rein, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, said in a statement.\nEven as he laid out the possibility of raising property taxes, Mamdani reiterated that his administration plans to send Albany a proposal to reform the city\u2019s property tax system in the next few weeks. Sherif Soliman, director of the mayor\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, said the proposed bill would build on the recommendations laid out in the 2021 report by the city\u2019s Advisory Commission on Property Tax Reform. He noted the commission\u2019s recommendation to eliminate assessed value growth caps and use sales-based market value to assess condos and co-ops.\nThe mayor also reiterated that the plan is not final.\nCity Council leadership believes there are additional areas of savings and revenue \u201cthat deserve careful scrutiny\u201d before increasing property taxes.\n\u201cAt a time when New Yorkers are already grappling with an affordability crisis, dipping into rainy day reserves and proposing significant property tax increases should not be on the table whatsoever,\u201d Speaker Julie Menin and Council member Linda Lee, chair of the Committee on Finance, said in a joint statement.\nComptroller Mark Levine also said the city needs to search for other sources of savings, indicating that the mayor\u2019s plan might not be enough to bridge the budget gap because it assumes \u201can aggressive revenue projection,\u201d and presumes that the city will not move forward with the\nplanned expansion\nof CityFHEPS rental assistance.\n\u201cDrawing down reserves during a period of economic growth would leave us vulnerable to economic turbulence next year,\u201d he said.\n",

The total followed\nanother banner week\n, during which 36 luxury Manhattan homes entered contract, including 13 properties asking $10 million or more.\nThe most expensive unit to land an inked deal was the 18th floor of the 26-unit development, which had an asking price of $39 million. The apartment spans 5,300 square feet and has five bedrooms and five bathrooms. It also features two balconies, 11-foot ceilings and views of Central Park.\nThe building\u2019s 16th floor, asking $36.5 million, snagged the No. 2 spot in the report. The unit\u2019s layout is similar to the 18th floor, though its two balconies total more than 170 square feet instead of 150 square feet.\nThe developers launched sales at the building last month with a team from Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, led by Cathy Franklin, and have already found buyers for 16 condos. Just a week into selling, the development\nnabbed the top spot\nin Olshan\u2019s weekly report when a buyer signed a contract to purchase Unit 11 North, which was asking just under $15 million.\nLegion and Nahla shelled out $95 million between 2019 and early 2024 to assemble six parcels for the development site. The duo scored\n$195 million\nin construction financing from Deutsche Bank JVP Management in August 2024.\nThe building\u2019s planned amenities include a fitness center with a squash court, cold plunge pool and sauna, as well as a bar, media room and billiards room. Construction is expected to be completed in the fall of 2027.\nThe 1122 Madison condos aren\u2019t Legion\u2019s first rodeo on the Upper East Side. The firm also developed 109 East 79th Street, which marked its founder and CEO Victor Sigoura\u2019s\nfirst major Manhattan project\nafter he left his executive post at Naftali Group in 2016. A penthouse at the development sold to investment banker Joseph Rallo and his wife, Ashley, for\n$25 million\nin 2023.\nDown in Miami Beach, Nahla, led by Genghis Hadi, paid $270 million to buy the\nRaleigh Rosewood Residences\nfrom its former development team led by Michael Shvo. Its other New York-based projects have included 221 West 77th Street and 152 Elizabeth Street.\n",

        "content": "A\nWestwood\nresidence listed for $16.2 million was last week\u2019s high watermark when it came to Los Angeles County\u2019s signed contracts.\nThat\u2019s according to Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team, which produces a\nweekly roundup\nof the county\u2019s top single-family homes and condominiums to go into contract based on their most recent asking price. The\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n, which is compiled by\nEklund Gomes\n\u2019 Marcy Roth, counts properties listed for $4 million or more in the Multiple Listing Service.\nThe asking price for the home at 10444 Charing Cross Road equates to $1,753 per square foot and was first listed in February 2025 for $18.5 million, or $2,002 per square foot. Since then, it\u2019s been taken off and put back on the market, reappearing with new pricing.\nThe six-bedroom, eight-bathroom home is over 9,200 square feet, with a theater, a gym, an elevator, two laundry rooms and a wine cellar.\nProperty records show the seller is a limited partnership that counts as a partner Michael Shore, an attorney in Beverly Hills. The LP purchased the property in 2022 for $6.5 million, or $703 per square foot.\nLaura Brau of Compass holds the listing.\nLast week also saw 1520 Carla Ridge in Beverly Hills go into contract to make for the seven-day period\u2019s next priciest pending deal based on listing price.\nLocated in Trousdale Estates, the roughly 7,300-square-foot home has five beds and six baths, with an asking price just under $15 million, or $2,053 per square foot. Built in 2020, the residence sits on nearly half an acre.\nThe property has been on the market since August 2024, first hanging up the for-sale sign with a nearly $23 million asking price. The home has since seen several price reductions and was also listed for rent last May for $85,000 per month.\nThe seller is Kentaro Abe, a trustee for the P&amp;G Trust, according to property records.\nNicholas Property Group\u2019s Dustin Nicholas is the listing agent.\nThe Westwood and Beverly Hills properties were two of 16 homes that went into contract last week, amounting to $122.2 million in asking volume.\nThat activity represented nine fewer signed contracts and about 39 percent less in asking volume compared to a year earlier, according to the Eklund Gomes report.\nOne point to consider when factoring in the year-ago comparisons is the Los Angeles residential market is now lapping the post-Palisades and Eaton fires time period, which saw a significant increase in both leasing and sales activity as impacted homeowners scrambled for temporary or new housing.\n",

        "content": "Another prominent executive with past ties to Jeffrey Epstein is stepping aside.\nThomas J. Pritzker, 75, resigned Monday as executive chairman of Hyatt Hotels Corporation, citing his association with the disgraced financier and Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell. The New York Times\nreported\nthat in a letter to the board, Pritzker said he was retiring effective immediately and would not seek reelection to Hyatt\u2019s board at the company\u2019s annual stockholders meeting in May.\n\u201cGood stewardship also means protecting\nHyatt\n, particularly in the context of my association with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell which I deeply regret,\u201d Pritzker wrote.\nHe acknowledged he \u201cexercised terrible judgment\u201d in maintaining contact with them and said there was \u201cno excuse for failing to distance myself sooner.\u201d\nRecently released files show Pritzker remained in regular contact with Epstein after the financier\u2019s 2008 plea deal on sex crimes charges. Emails detail meal plans and meetings, including at Epstein\u2019s Manhattan townhouse.\nIn a 2018 exchange, Epstein asked Pritzker to help his girlfriend, Karyna Shuliak, arrange travel to Southeast Asia. When Shuliak wrote that she was \u201cgoing to try to find a new girlfriend for Jeffrey,\u201d Pritzker responded with a smiley-face emoticon and \u201cMay the Force be with you.\u201d In another 2015 email, Epstein joked about arranging a lunch with the Dalai Lama and Woody Allen.\nThe two also discussed invitations to the\nPritzker Architecture Prize\nceremony in Beijing, the marquee award overseen by the family\u2019s philanthropic arm. Requests for comment from the Pritzker Organization by the publication were not returned Monday.\nThe Pritzker name carries weight well beyond hospitality, as Thomas Pritzker\u2019s cousins include\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker\nand Penny Pritzker, who now leads Harvard University\u2019s governing board.\nHyatt\u2019s board appointed President and\nCEO Mark S. Hoplamazian\nas chairman. Richard Tuttle, chair of the board\u2019s nominating and governance committee, thanked Pritzker for his leadership, calling his tenure instrumental to the company\u2019s long-term growth.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

A recent appraisal of the property by Integra Realty Resources, meanwhile, indicates that it has lost nearly 21 percent of its value since a prior estimation by Cushman &amp; Wakefield three years ago, and is now worth around $23 million.\nA Cupertino-based developer run by an individual identified as Xuhan You is now engaged in legal fights in two courts in an apparent bid to hang onto the property as its value sinks toward the level of its debt load. One of the suits is against CTBC Bank, which holds the loan on the apartment complex.\nCTBC Bank is seeking to take the property through foreclosure in weeks or months, with timing likely to be subject to rulings in the bankruptcy case and a separate legal action in Santa Clara County court.\nThe Neo isn\u2019t the only multifamily development in downtown San Jose in distress. A lender foreclosed on a 336-unit complex called The Fay last month over a\n$182.5 million construction loan\n.\nThat deal also pointed to a gap between debt levels and property values, with the lender claiming the Fay was worth $110 million. The Fay stood out on San Jose\u2019s skyline at 23 stories, and bought an upscale entry to the boundary between downtown and the city\u2019s SoFa district.\nU.K.-based developer Scape paid $16.5 million for the parcel for The Fay and took the $182.5 million construction loan for the project from an affiliate of Madison Capital Realty, which had foreclosed on it.\n",

        "content": "Texas thawed this month, but the ultra-luxury market remains cold.\nLast week, the first sale of the top 10 most expensive homes listed in Texas in January closed: a spec mansion at 4527 North Lindhurst Avenue in Dallas, asking $8.3 million at the time of sale, according to public records and the Houston Association of Realtors.\nIt was the least expensive of January\u2019s top 10 homes on HAR\u2019s monthly ranking, which covers the major metro areas of the state. A Highland Park home at\n3711 Lexington Avenue\nin Dallas led the ranking with an asking price of $29.9 million.\nSeller Bart Plaskoff, president of Summit Trucking and an\noccasional real estate developer\n, originally listed the Lindhurst Avenue home for $12 million in April 2024, according to Zillow. The low-slung contemporary mansion spans over 8,800 square feet on a 0.8-acre lot, with five bedrooms and eight bathrooms. Amenities include a sauna, pool and fire pit.\nCompass agents Julie Provenanzo and Meridith Hayes had the listing. Fellow Compass agent Stanley Williams represented the buyer, Kenneth Willey. The purchase was finalized on Feb. 12, according to public records.\nThe seller lowered the price gradually throughout 2025, delisting and relisting the home, before settling at an asking price of $8.3 million in January. The final sale price is not disclosed.\nThe most expensive listings of January include\na large share of relistings\n, many with significant discounts. The 20,500-square-foot Lexington Avenue home at the top of the list was asking\n$36.5 million last summer\n; today, it\u2019s asking $29.9 million. The second-most expensive listing of January, a Preston Hollow home owned by the founder of Cinemark, listed last September for\n$22 million\n; today, it\u2019s asking $18 million. Coming in third place, the home at 603 West Friar Tuck Lane in Houston hit the market with an asking price of $20 million in June. Today, it\u2019s asking $14 million.\nIn addition to his spec mansion enterprise, Plaskoff has undertaken community-scale development projects through his company, Jobar Development. Jobar floated a\n1,400-unit mixed-use development in Oak Cliff to city authorities in 2024\n, but the project\u2019s future is uncertain. The company sold the land to JMR Investments Group last February, public records show.\n",

        "content": "Christine Quinn\u2019s nonprofit released an\nanalysis\nshowing CityFHEPS rental voucher expansion would save $635 million, contrary to a\nfinding\nby the Citizens Budget Commission.\nBut consider the source: Quinn\u2019s mission is to help the homeless, so it\u2019s no surprise that her study concluded that giving them vouchers saves the city money.\nThe budget group\u2019s agenda is fiscal prudence. If vouchers saved money, the CBC would have every incentive to endorse issuing more of them.\nInstead it found that \u201cshort-term savings are fleeting and vouchers cost more than shelter over time.\u201d\n\u201cRental housing vouchers require substantial subsidy and have not reduced the demand for shelter,\u201d the commission wrote. \u201cThe city cannot voucher its way out of the housing affordability crisis.\u201d\nA CityFHEPS voucher costs $54.80 per day. Shelters cost $144 for an individual and $270 for a family. But voucher payments run for five years or more. The average shelter stay is 15 months.\nAlso, the state and federal governments contribute to shelter costs, while the city pays for CityFHEPS on its own.\nQuinn\u2019s nonprofit, WIN, doesn\u2019t want families to spend 15 months in shelters. That likely influenced its decision to use a methodology that showed vouchers save money.\nWIN claims that CBC didn\u2019t account for people returning to shelters, which WIN says vouchers would reduce. CBC says it did account for that.\nI didn\u2019t get into the weeds on their math, but shelter population counts suggest that CBC is right: As the city handed out lots more vouchers in the past two years, the\nshelter head count\ndid not go down. It went up \u2014 even with the migrant surge ending.\nOver that time, the number of single adults in shelters rose by 22 percent. The small number of adult couples in shelters remained flat.\nThe families-with-children shelter population has dropped by 10 percent since January 2024, but largely because migrants stopped arriving.

        "content": "Two South Beach condo association employees were arrested over a kickback scheme that partly hinged on 40-year\nrecertification\nwork for the aging building, according to prosecutors.\nEuclid East Condominium\u2019s property manager Francisco Obispo, 38, was charged with one count of organized scheme to defraud and 18 counts of receiving a kickback. A maintenance worker, Jose Luis Hernandez-Aguiar, 52, was charged with one count of organized scheme to defraud.\nThe six-story, 57-unit building at 1545 Euclid Avenue was built in 1967.\nA Miami-Dade State Attorney\u2019s investigator started poking around in June, after a former board member pointed out financial discrepancies, including payments from the association to JLH Repair, a company registered to Hernandez. A review of financial records, including bank records obtained through a subpoena of JLH, showed that the alleged scheme capitalized on Euclid East\u2019s impending 40-year recertification.\nFlorida and Miami-Dade County tightened its structural integrity and recertification requirements after the 2021 Surfside condo collapse, imposing recertifications at the 30-year mark and every 10 years thereafter. The rules are stricter for buildings near the coast.\nThe Euclid East association paid JLH $25,000 for permit processing for the recertification, though the city of Miami Beach had no record of JLH pulling permits, according to the arrest warrant. JLH also received $24,500 for pulling recertification electrical permits, but the city had no record of JLH applying for or securing the permits, the warrant says.\nAround the time JLH received payments from the association, it cut checks to Obispo and a company registered in his name, Skyline Management Solutions, bank records allegedly showed.\nThe investigator tracked 18 money transfers, including nearly $200,000 allegedly paid from the association to JLH, with $66,100 of that allegedly transferred to Obispo. Another firm, led by a man who identified himself as the licensed contractor retained by JLH to pull permits for Euclid East, received $61,800 from the association, with $29,400 then transferred to Obispo, according to the warrant.\nObispo told the investigator he received nothing of value from Hernandez.\nEuclid East employed Obispo and Hernandez through a condo management company. Hernandez, the maintenance worker, was later switched to a direct employee of the association around the time Obispo, the property manager, was assigned to Euclid East in 2024, the arrest warrant states.\n\u201c[We] scratched our head, going where did this come from,\u201d a board member told the investigator, according to the warrant. \u201cNobody talked to us about it. One minute he\u2019s the janitor, the next thing you know, he\u2019s running $500,000 in construction projects.\u201d\nHernandez\u2019s bond was set at $15,000, and Obispo\u2019s at $105,000. They could not be reached for comment.\nThe arrests mark the latest incident in a string of alleged\nfraudulent dealings\nby condo association staff members.\u00a0Residents living in communities governed by condo or homeowners associations across South Florida have accused board members of\nwrongdoing\n, from diverting funds to themselves to election fraud and bullying of those who spoke out. In some cases, homeowners also accused\nassociation managers\n, which are licensed companies or individuals hired to oversee day-to-day dealings, of\npartaking in schemes\n.\n",

It\u2019s new digs? Business-friendly Miami.\nThe publicly traded AI software firm, led by Alex Karp, said in a brief X post on Tuesday that it moved its headquarters from Denver to Miami, the Denver Post\nreported\n.\nThe firm, with a market value of $312.2 billion and about 4,000 employees, hasn\u2019t announced its office location.\nThe planned move aligns with Miami\u2019s yearslong effort to become a magnet for tech firms and gives a boost to the city\u2019s push to grow its AI sector.\nThe company has faced regulatory and political headwinds in Colorado.\nPalantir has faced protests in Denver partly due to its work using AI to aid Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportations.\nA Colorado law will take effect in June creating more stringent regulation for data mining and predictive tools, though it didn\u2019t target Palantir directly.\nIn its move to Miami, Palantir is following the footsteps of its co-founder and board chair Peter Thiel, whose San Francisco-based venture capital firm Founders Fund opened a Miami office in 2021, first in\nBrickell\nand then moved to\nWynwood\n. His Los Angeles-based Thiel Capital investment firm opened a Miami office last year.\nPalantir isn\u2019t the only one opting for a Miami headquarters.\nPrivate equity firm Trinity Investments moved its headquarters to Miami from Honolulu; Canadian waste management firm GFL Environmental moved to Miami Beach from Vaughan, Ontario; and Danish retailer Danish Flying Tiger Copenhagen announced it will open its Americas administrative base at Miami Beach\u2019s Lincoln Road.\nTrinity, founded in 1996 and led by Sean Hehir, kept a Honolulu office and also has outposts in\u00a0 Los Angeles and London, a company news release states. Its recent investments include the 240-key The Hoxton, Poblenou hotel in Barcelona, and the 450-room Fairmont Olympic Hotel in downtown Seattle.\nIt leased\n3,000 square feet\nat Comras Company\u2019s The Canopy Offices at 2982 Grand Avenue in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove neighborhood.\nIn South Florida, Trinity, in partnership with Credit Suisse Asset Management, owns the 1,000-key oceanfront Diplomat Beach Resort in Hollywood. They paid\n$835 million\nfor it in 2022.\nPublicly traded GFL Environmental leased at the\nEighteen Sunset\nbuilding at 1759 Purdy Avenue in the Sunset Harbour neighborhood, the\nSouth Florida Business Journal\nreported.\nDevelopers Deco Capital Group and RWN Real Estate Partners developed the five-story office building with retail and restaurant space.\nFlying Tiger, which offers home goods, toys and other items, will open at an Industrious co-working space at 350 Lincoln Road, the\nSouth Florida Business Journal\nreported. Jens Aarup Mikkelsen, CEO International at Flying Tiger Copenhagen, will move to South Florida to become a regional director.\n",

        "content": "A local developer is betting on small suites to sell a Hallandale Beach office project, as the vacancy rate rises in Broward County.\nFour West Developers, a partnership between\nAlejandro Chaberman\n, Asher and Arie Abadi and Jonathan Eisenband, is planning an eight-story, 360,000-square-foot condo and retail development at 400 West Hallandale Beach Boulevard that will cost $85 million to build, a news release states.\nThe project, called Square Hallandale, will have suites ranging from 250 square feet to 1,800 square feet, units will start at $199,000, or about $800 per square foot. Buyers will have the option to occupy, lease or resell their units.\nFour West plans to market the suites to small business owners and commercial investors priced out of office submarkets in\nAventura\nand Miami, the release states.\nFortune Development Sales, the brokerage arm of Edgardo Defortuna\u2019s Fortune International Group, is handling marketing and sales.\nFour West paid $8 million for the development site in 2024, records show. The developer plans to begin construction later this year.\nThe project\u2019s 18,000 square feet of amenities will include a terrace with pickleball and padel courts, a social lounge, and a fitness center with a cold plunge pool, sauna and studio. It will also have 18,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space.\nBroward\u2019s office vacancy rate hit the mid-teens at the end of last year, according to Newmark. Average asking rents pushed into the low $40s per square foot, cheaper than Miami-Dade but high enough that some smaller users are looking for alternatives to traditional leases, Newmark found. Brokers say tenants are gravitating either to high-quality, amenity-rich buildings or deeply discounted second-tier spaces.\nChaberman is an active developer in Hallandale Beach. His other firm, Kadima Developers, is planning\nSeven Park\n, a $70 million, eight-story mixed-use project with 121 condos and 4,500 square feet of ground-floor retail. Kadima purchased 12.2 vacant acres around the Big Easy Casino at 831 North Federal Highway for\n$31.1 million\nin December. The firm plans to develop a master-planned community with apartments,\u00a0 condos, retail, entertainment and warehouses.",

        "content": "Marquette Companies is moving ahead with a mixed-use multifamily project in the Chicago suburbs, as the market continues its hot streak.\nThe Chicago-based developer secured a $55 million construction loan from Associated Bank, according to a press release from the Green Bay, Wisconsin-based bank. The loan will fund Marquette\u2019s Union Villa Park development at 110 South Villa Avenue in Villa Park, Illinois, which will include 238 apartments consisting of studios, two and three-bedroom units, as well as 8,000 square feet of commercial space. MetLife is serving as an equity partner in the project which is expected to cost $90 million, a release from Marquette shows.\nThe village of Villa Park approved an incentive agreement with Marquette for the development in 2025 that includes a garage with 94 parking spaces open to the public, The Daily Herald reported.\nThe financing follows a trend of lenders feeling more confident in non-Cook County suburbs than in the city of Chicago. Early last year, suburban apartment building sales between $1 million and $50 million\njumped 65 percent, year-over-year\n, Interra Realty found. The brokerage, which specializes in midsize deals, found that 53 midsize apartment buildings sold between March 2024 and March 2025, compared to 32 sold between March 2023 and March 2024.\nSince last year, investing activity continues to hold strong. The market got off to a blazing start in January with projects with\nover 1,400 units trading in just one week.\nChicago is on track this year to see the smallest number of new apartments completed since 2012,\na recent analysis\nfrom Marcus &amp; Millichap found.\nPart of that is due to\na chaotic property tax environment\nin Cook County that has stymied investor activity. Tension over property tax adjustments in the wake of the pandemic have led to\na contentious race\nfor Cook County Tax Assessor, with donations from the real estate community flooding into Democratic Primary challenger Patrick Hynes\u2019 campaign.\nStill, activity is hardly at a standstill in Chicago.

        "content": "The \u201ctake your licks until 2026\u201d mantra has officially expired for the owners of the\nEmbassy Suites by Hilton hotel in Lombard\n, as they\u2019re still feeling the post-pandemic pain of depressed commercial real estate values.\nMonths after the 263-key hotel slipped into distress, a group of lenders steered by special servicer KeyBank are moving to strip operational control from its landlord, a joint venture of Corona del Mar, California-based Seaview Investors and San Diego-based Chelsea Hospitality Partners. The lenders asked a DuPage County judge to appoint Jeff Kolessar of GF Hotels &amp; Resorts as receiver to manage the property amid a $24 million foreclosure lawsuit, with a hearing set for March 3, public records show.\nThe move signals a cold reality for suburban hotel owners: Even as downtown Chicago hotels enjoyed a summer of 2019-level revenue, the suburbs remain a landscape of steep haircuts and aggressive foreclosures.\nThe lawsuit highlights a ballooning debt stack for the hotel. While the principal sits at $21.5 million, the bill has been padded by $1.6 million in default interest, $576,000 in deferred interest and various late fees.\nThe lender, a consortium of investors that bought the debt after it originated in 2019 as part of a commercial mortgage-backed securities deal, alleged the Seaview and Chelsea venture defaulted by failing to repay the loan upon its summertime maturity date last year. The landlords previously indicated they wouldn\u2019t try to refinance the property to save the deal, an acknowledgment of its value sliding too far since the loan origination before the pandemic.\nNow, the owners signed a pre-negotiation agreement with the lender and are \u201cengaged in discussions regarding possible exit strategies,\u201d according to KeyBank. \u201cThe special servicer continues to assess all options to maximize recoveries,\u201d it said last month in a report on the deal.\nThe lender is also seeking permission to fast-track $200,000 to $300,000 in tenant improvements without court oversight \u2014 a sign the group of banks that hold the note are already prepping the hotel for a post-foreclosure life.\nIf appointed, GF Hotels affiliate LOIL Associates would manage the property for $7,000 a month or 3 percent of gross revenue, whichever is higher, according to legal documents.\nStill, the Lombard Embassy Suites deal remains profitable on paper. The property has had no trouble bringing in enough revenue to cover its debt service costs, loan data shows, as it generated over $11.4 million for the 12-month period ending in March of last year, with expenses of just under $8 million and debt service costs of $2.4 million, leaving a roughly $1 million cushion.\nThe legal pressure extends beyond the real estate. The loan was guaranteed by trusts tied to hospitality industry veterans Robert Alter and Gary Stougaard, who have ties to Seaview. Their trusts were required to maintain a combined net worth of at least $35 million. So far, the borrowers haven\u2019t indicated they will fight the receivership.\nNeither Seaview nor an attorney for KeyBank returned requests for comment.\nThe Lombard case is the latest data point in a harrowing Chicagoland hospitality market. Suburban properties are especially desperate, as business travel and corporate visits to office campuses stay muted, while workspace vacancy hovers at a record high of over 30 percent in the suburbs.\nLast year, a\n318-key Crowne Plaza hotel in Northbrook sold out of foreclosure\nfor just $6.5 million, a 50 percent discount from its last purchase price in 2021, and the former\nTremont Hotel in Chicago\u2019s Gold Coast fetched just $13 million\nafter a stint as a shelter and a foreclosure dispute. Locally based investor Parag Patel has bought multiple properties at steep bargains in both the city and suburbs, including the Aloft Bolingbrook property he bought out of foreclosure, making him a potential candidate to buy the nearby Lombard Embassy Suites grappling with distress.\nYet, the pain is climbing into bigger hotel deals, too. Just blocks from the renowned Magnificent Mile,\nQuadrum Global\nis currently moving to foreclose on Oxford Capital\u2019s Godfrey Hotel in an $88 million debt dispute.",

        "content": "A planned 402-acre Islamic-centered community northeast of Dallas is drawing fresh federal and state scrutiny, threatening to complicate one of the region\u2019s most ambitious master-planned projects.\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said Friday its Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity launched an investigation into EPIC Real Properties and Community Capital Partners over potential violations of the Fair Housing Act, including alleged religious and national origin discrimination tied to\nThe Meadow\n, formerly branded as EPIC City, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. EPIC stands for the East Plano Islamic Center.\nHUD said it received a complaint from the Texas Workforce Commission detailing a \u201clarge-scale pattern of religious discriminatory conduct.\u201d Among the allegations: marketing materials promoting the project as an exclusively Muslim community and \u201cthe epicenter of Islam in America,\u201d financial terms requiring lot owners to subsidize a mosque and Islamic educational centers, as well as a two-tier lottery system for lot sales that favored certain buyers, according to the outlet.\nHUD Secretary Scott Turner said the agency would ensure a \u201cthorough investigation so that this community is open to all Texans.\u201d\nCommunity Capital Partners, a for-profit development arm formed by members of the East Plano Islamic Center, denied discrimination claims and said it remains committed to complying with\nstate\nand\nfederal\nhousing laws. The group argues many of the issues raised were addressed in a prior settlement with the Texas Workforce Commission.\nThe\ndevelopment envisions\nmore than 1,000 homes, a K-12 faith-based school, mosque, senior housing, apartments, retail and sports fields across land in Collin and Hunt counties, roughly 40 miles from downtown Dallas.\nAt the same time, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton\nfiled a separate lawsuit\nin Collin County, his agency announced Monday, targeting Double R Municipal Utility District No. 2A, accusing board members of improperly expanding the district\u2019s boundaries to support what he called the \u201cillegal\u201d EPIC project.\nMunicipal utility districts, authorized by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, are critical to financing infrastructure for large-scale residential developments. Developers front the costs, then recoup them through bond issuances repaid by property taxes within the district.\nPaxton alleges that in September, the Double R board was replaced at a rural meeting and quickly approved a petition to annex roughly 400 acres tied to The Meadow \u2014 despite questions about whether the new directors met statutory qualifications or even resided within the district. His office is seeking to block further district action and strip the project land from its boundaries.\nThe developer\u2019s attorney, Eric Hudson, called the suit the latest escalation in \u201clawfare\u201d by Paxton and Gov. Greg Abbott, arguing the district process has been handled by Texas law firm Winstead for 18 months and that technical issues will be resolved in court.\nThe project has already weathered a securities lawsuit from Paxton as well as a now-closed civil rights inquiry by the Justice Department.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Before the pandemic, generational wealth migration and the seemingly endless stream of headlines about Steve Ross transforming West Palm Beach, there was Jeff Greene.\nHe saw a diamond in the rough more than a decade ago.\n\u201cSitting in my private plane at the airport, it struck me that there were 300 to 400 other private jets there,\u201d he told\nThe Real Deal\nin a 2016 interview. \u201cHow can a city with this much wealth and education have so few amazing buildings, restaurants and hotels?\u201d\nThe billionaire real estate investor\nlaid out his plans\nfor reinventing the coastal city. By that point, he\u2019d amassed a 75-acre portfolio in West Palm Beach and was dreaming up apartments, condos, a hotel, an office tower, retail and a school.\nA decade later, West Palm is threatening Greene with\na $5 million fine if he doesn\u2019t finish\nhis premier mixed-use development soon. Earlier this month, the city commission certified an agreement with the developer that he will complete the two-tower, 30-story One West Palm by the end of 2027. Otherwise, he\u2019ll have to fork over the hefty late fee.\nGreene said he plans to complete One West Palm before the deadline.\nIt\u2019s a squeeze play for a city widely seen as a partner to the real estate industry and the titans who want to build in it. And it\u2019s in sharp contrast to\nRoss\n\u2019 gargantuan efforts, which have produced millions of square feet of office and apartment developments in the same amount of time.\nBut to Greene, his delays at One West Palm distract from his myriad of projects throughout West Palm and Palm Beach County.\n\u201cWe\u2019re building stuff all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone focuses on the one building that seems to be taking a very long time.\u201d\nRed light, Greene light\nGreene\u2019s vision for his West Palm Beach projects came together at a time of great personal change.\nIn 2009, Greene bought a 3.6-acre oceanfront Palm Beach estate for $24 million. Comparable properties today trade for more than $100 million, but that was long before the pandemic altered market dynamics on the island. He had married his wife Mei Sze Chan a few years earlier, and the couple had just welcomed their first child. In 2010, he launched an unsuccessful bid for U.S. Senate.\nBut his political ambitions were dogged by his past.\nHe is among the mythologized figures who had the prescience to bet against the housing market in the mid-aughts, a move that earned him an $800 million windfall when Wall Street came crashing down in 2008. A profile in\nForbes\nthat year titled \u201cThe Reluctant Billionaire\u201d elevated his reputation nationally, along with tales of his bachelor days in Beverly Hills. For years, most articles about Greene mentioned that his best man was Mike Tyson, that he partied with Paris Hilton and Lindsey Lohan, and that he hosted infamous Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss in his guest house for a year, describing her as a \u201cnice girl.\u201d\nIt didn\u2019t play well with voters, and he lost to his rival in the Democratic primary that year.\nBut Greene had other irons in the fire. He was quietly amassing a sprawling portfolio in Palm Beach County, banking property as South Florida crawled out of its post-financial crisis pit.\nHe bought an incomplete 548-unit apartment complex in West Palm Beach for $6.8 million in 2011 and finished construction of the complex in 2015. He bought the former Palm Beach Post Office for $3.7 million \u2013\u2013 which he sold later to the Breakers for\n$28 million\n. He bought the oceanfront Palm Beach resort now known as Tideline for $42 million.\nHe also snapped up hundreds of condos in newly completed buildings like\nthe Whitney\nat 410 Evernia Street, City Palms at 480 Hibiscus Street and the Strand at 255 Evernia Street. In 2015, he paid $24 million for a 3.3-acre parcel at 419 Lakeview Avenue, still a vacant lot with seasonal pumpkin and Christmas tree markets.\nGreene estimates his property holdings in the county are worth billions.\n\u201cI did buy an enormous amount of land,\u201d he said, adding he\u2019s been intentionally restrained in pacing his developments. \u201cIf I built it all at once, it would flood the market.\u201d\nThe sites that have made headlines recently are a 26-acre spread he acquired between 2012 and 2016 in West Palm\u2019s Currie Park Mixed Use District. It was during this time Greene paid $10 million for the 3.3-acre One West Palm development site at 550 North Quadrille Boulevard.\nDesigned by Arquitectonica, One West Palm is set to include 200,000 square feet of office space, 326 apartments, 201 hotel rooms and amenities like a fitness club, spa, movie theater, pools and indoor tennis courts.\nConstruction started in 2019, with the expectation it would be finished in 2022.\nBut Greene found himself bogged down in conflict from early days. He clashed with both the contractor and the city, and\nultimately fired Kast Construction\nfrom the project in 2024.\nWhile other developers have investors and lenders breathing down their necks when construction runs behind, the self-financing billionaire didn\u2019t \u201chave anyone to answer to,\u201d he said.\nWhile One West Palm faced delays, Greene was at work on another major two-tower development nearby. He announced plans for the Herzog &amp; de Meuron-designed project at 2175 and 2251 North Flagler Drive in 2023, touting the Swiss architecture firm as a major get for a maturing city. The 76-unit project is predicated on a 2021 upzoning of the Currie Park Mixed Use District.\nIt was the upzoning, which allowed Greene to build well beyond previously allowed height limits, that was targeted by the city this fall while he was attempting to get final approvals for the condos. A letter from Mayor Keith James stating the city would retract the height allowances prompted Greene to sue the city in October, alleging West Palm was improperly dragging out the approval process.\n\u201cIf this mayor wants me to just be a land banker and not build anything, I won\u2019t build anything,\u201d he said at the time.\nGreene cut a deal with the city, agreeing to the potential $5 million One West Palm penalty, while securing the height for his Herzog &amp; de Meuron condos. He also committed to a land swap and a $6 million payment to the city for the connection of Northwood Road and Currie Park.\nA decade in the making, Greene\u2019s vision for his West Palm portfolio hasn\u2019t totally materialized. He completed the 198-unit Brandon Estates apartment complex in 2024, and he\u2019s finished industrial projects farther inland. He also opened the Greene School in 2016, and it now runs from pre-K to 12th grade with\nan admissions waitlist\n.\nHe still needs to get the condos through final approval and One West Palm its certificate of occupancy. He\u2019s also working on Live Local projects in the city\u2019s downtown, a land donation to the proposed Vanderbilt University graduate campus, and plans for an 8.4-acre waterfront site on Flagler Drive. To him, timing is everything. And with\nso many other developers building\naround his sites, the timing seems better than ever.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of luck in real estate development. I\u2019m not stupid, I know you can be an idiot and make money in a great cycle, and you can be a genius and lose money in a bad cycle,\u201d he said. \u201cWe delayed [One West Palm] to get the perfect project, and just by luck, everything around it has blossomed.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A San Clemente-based housing developer has sued the trade group Orange County Realtors, accusing it of trying to block a $130 million senior housing project that already obtained city approvals.\nNick Buchanan, an infill developer based in San Clemente, plans to build a\n180-unit senior housing development\non a 4-acre shopping center he owns along La Paz Road in Laguna Hills. But Buchanan says the neighboring property owner \u2014 Orange County Realtors \u2014 has interfered with the project,\nforcing him to take legal action\n, according to the Orange County Business Journal.\nBuchanan\u2019s La Paz Village Investors filed a lawsuit Jan. 7 in Orange County Superior Court, alleging the trade group and its contractors conducted unauthorized construction on his property, including excavating asphalt, staging heavy equipment and blocking access to the shopping center, according to the complaint.\n\u201cThis was a project we tried very hard to work through collaboratively,\u201d Buchanan told the Business Journal. \u201cI just want to sit in a room with them and figure out how we move forward so we can build this important housing project.\u201d\nOrange County Realtors did not respond to the Business Journal\u2019s requests for comment.\nThe dispute centers on the redevelopment of La Paz Village, an aging retail center located just south of Interstate 5. Buchanan purchased the property in 2022 for $23.5 million and initially proposed townhomes before pivoting to senior housing. The five-story project would include independent living units, underground parking and amenities such as a gym, theater and rooftop deck, with 10 percent of units reserved for very low-income seniors.\nBuchanan used California\u2019s \u201cbuilder\u2019s remedy\u201d law to secure approvals after Laguna Hills was found out of compliance with state housing requirements. The Laguna Hills City Council approved the project in September, despite some opposition.\nAccording to Buchanan, Orange County Realtors owns the adjacent site and holds access easements across portions of the property. He said the group initially appeared open to the redevelopment but stopped communicating after construction activity escalated last fall.\n\u201cThey dug up our property without asking,\u201d Buchanan said. \u201cThat creates liability for us as a landlord.\u201d\nBuchanan said the lawsuit is aimed at clearing the way for construction to proceed.\n\u201cThis is exactly the kind of housing California says it wants,\u201d he said, with housing scarce across Southern California.\n\u2014\nLauren Elkies Schram\n",

        "content": "Mayor Zohran Mamdani named five new members to the city\u2019s Rent Guidelines Board, meaning the mayor\u2019s appointees make up a majority of the body as he calls for freezing rents for stabilized apartments.\nMamdani announced Wednesday that he tapped Chatnella Mitchell, program director at the New York Community Trust, as the new chair, replacing Doug Apple. Maksim Wynn, director of development and supportive housing at Bronx-based Procida Development Group, is joining as an owner representative. Wynn previously worked for the city\u2019s Department of Homeless Services and the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, where he focused on homelessness.\nThe mayor also named to the board Sina Sinai, senior research associate at the Jain Family Institute; Lauren Melodia, director of economic and fiscal policy at the Center for New York City Affairs at The New School; and Brandon Mancilla, a regional director of the United Auto Workers; as public members.\nDespite\nefforts\nby outgoing Mayor Eric Adams to leave the board with a majority of his own appointees, Mamdani entered office with the ability to appoint up to five of the nine board members in his first year, with the ability to replace the remaining four in his second.\nBut another spot was freed up when public member Alex Armlovich, who has been publicly\nskeptical\nof freezing rents, announced Tuesday that he was stepping down ahead of schedule. In a letter\nposted\non X, Armlovich said he was leaving to take a new position at Coefficient Giving, where he\u2019ll work on housing supply policy.\n\u201cIn a democracy, the mayor who wins an election has some right to appoint people who reflect his policy priorities, including on the RGB,\u201d he states in the letter, adding that he has confidence that the mayor\u2019s housing priorities are being guided by a team \u2014\u00a0he mentions Deputy Mayor of Housing and Planning\nLeila Bozorg\n\u2014 that is \u201cengaging with the full complexity of the problem.\u201d\nArmlovich urged board members to consider a proposal by Arpit Gupta, one of the owner representatives on the board. The proposal, dubbed a \u201cslumlord freeze\u201d by Armlovich, would only freeze rents for property owners whose buildings have the highest number of hazardous violations.\n\u201cIt directly ties a landlord\u2019s revenue to their performance as a housing provider, and it addresses the legitimate concern that blanket guidelines reward negligent and responsible ones alike,\u201d Armlovich writes.\nArmlovich\u2019s decision to step down before his term was up at the end of the year was first reported by The City.\nInstead of naming a sixth new member, Mamdani opted to reappoint Ad\u00e1n Soltren, a tenant representative, appointed by Adams whose term had expired.\nThe terms of the remaining members, Gupta and Christina Smyth, both owner representatives, and tenant representative Sagar Sharma, expire at the end of the year.\nAppointing a majority of the rent board\u2019s members doesn\u2019t guarantee that the body will ultimately freeze rents this year, let alone over the next four. The board is supposed to act independently of the mayor, though past administrations have influenced its decisions.\nIn a press release, the mayor didn\u2019t mention his pledge to freeze rents on stabilized apartments for the next four years. In a statement, he said that under Mitchell\u2019s leadership as chair, \u201cthe board will take a clear-eyed look at the complex housing landscape and the realities facing our city\u2019s two million rent-stabilized tenants.\u201d\nThe news of the appointments comes one day after the mayor unveiled his preliminary budget, which calls for a blanket\n9.5 percent property increase\nif the state doesn\u2019t hike corporate tax and income tax rates for New York\u2019s wealthiest.\n",

        "content": "Jeffrey Epstein surrounded himself with sultans, former heads of state, British royalty and tech visionaries to cultivate the image of a high-flying financier.\nBut in real estate, Epstein often leaned on a down-on-his-luck New York City developer with a trail of lawsuits and an array of business ventures that ranged from a deli to a houseware retailer to boutique luxury condos: David Mitchell.\nEpstein\u2019s previously undisclosed real estate investments with Mitchell show deeper insight into Epstein\u2019s business strategy. He invested in real estate not just for paper returns but to enhance his connections and stature, specifically turning to Mitchell to build out his ever-expanding Rolodex.\nOne source who knows Mitchell said that Epstein saw Mitchell \u2014 whose father was a famed NYC restaurateur \u2014 as someone who could open doors and make social connections for the outer borough-born Epstein in New York\u2019s upper-crust society. The relationship evolved as Mitchell\u2019s investments went south and he relied on Epstein for short-term loans and financial advice. Epstein provided at least $7 million in loans and investments in Mitchell\u2019s projects, according to a\nTRD\nestimate based on transactions specified in the documents.\nThe thousands of emails exchanged between Epstein, Mitchell and Epstein\u2019s assistants were released as part of 3.5 million pages of documents by the Department of Justice into the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. The emails suggest the relationship was mostly transactional, although they did occasionally exchange birthday and holiday messages. Epstein once asked Mitchell about an erectile dysfunction drug and Mitchell invited Epstein to a birthday party in Tel Aviv, telling him it should be \u201cquite demonic and fun.\u201d\nEpstein provided Mitchell funding for many of his projects, including a $1.5 million loan in 2017 to cover shortfalls at the Life Hotel, Mitchell\u2019s ambitious rebrand of the Herald Square Hotel. Epstein also invested in at least four of Mitchell\u2019s ventures, including a six-unit condo development on the Upper East Side, according to emails released by the Department of Justice.\nMitchell, despite his blue blood bona fides, often found himself needing cash infusions from Epstein, emails show. Epstein, whose liquid assets were in the hundreds of millions for most of their relationship, seemed happy to help, providing over $2 million in loans to Mitchell.\n\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it, life is long . No stress from me,\u201d Epstein said in response to Mitchell trying to negotiate a repayment plan for one of the loans he had received.\nEpstein did not appear to financially benefit from his relationship with Mitchell. But after the Department of Justice charged Epstein with sex trafficking dozens of underage girls in July 2019, Epstein\u2019s attorneys sought to put assets from two individuals up for a bond package: Epstein\u2019s brother and Mitchell, who was described by Epstein\u2019s attorneys as a \u201cfriend.\u201d\nBetween 2009 and 2019, Epstein also regularly sought connections from Mitchell. Epstein turned to the dealmaker to find a friend of Woody Allen\u2019s son a restaurant job. Epstein asked Mitchell for a rabbi who would do a conversion for \u201cshiksas,\u201d or non-jewish women. And he requested Mitchell\u2019s help with a Soho House membership.\nEpstein also offered Mitchell career advice, warning him he was in too many deals.\n\u201cTry to be disciplined about deals. breaking the addiction is not easy,\u201d said Epstein in an email to Mitchell in 2016. \u201cAs your friend i think too many\u2026 slow down, I need you around.\u201d\nMitchell did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\nTwo connectors\nMitchell hailed from the world Epstein always aspired to be a part of. Mitchell\u2019s father, Jan Mitchell, revived famed New York restaurants L\u00fcchow\u2019s and Longchamps. He bought an estate in Southampton modeled after the Villa Medici in Rome and amassed a collection of pre-Columbian gold, donating some to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\nJan\u2019s son dabbled in real estate, focusing on retailers and small high-end condos in Manhattan and Brooklyn Heights. Among his more notable ventures was Gracious Homes, an upscale housewares chain, which filed for bankruptcy in 2016.\nEpstein and Mitchell had a longstanding relationship. When Epstein\u2019s cushy 13-month jail sentence in Palm Beach County ended for charges of soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor for prostitution in July 2009, Mitchell called Epstein\u2019s office to offer \u201ccongratulations\u2026 or welcome back.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just so happy for you. Give me a call when you can,\u201d Mitchell said.\nMitchell acted as deal guy for Epstein. Over the course of their relationship, Mitchell brought a number of investment opportunities and business ideas to Epstein.\nMitchell\u2019s pitches were often for new and off-the-beaten-path deals, getting into loansharking, buying properties in Alberta, Canada, and a self-storage property in Tampa. But Mitchell rarely seemed to have the funds to close on these investments.\nAfter Epstein\u2019s prison sentence in Palm Beach ended in 2009, Epstein viewed Mitchell as a trusted confidante. Epstein asked Mitchell to arrange meetings with some of his most valued contacts. In 2010, Epstein requested that Mitchell go to Dubai with an Epstein associate to meet Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, the CEO of logistics giant DP World. A year later, Mitchell was asking Epstein, then a convicted sex offender, for \u201ccredibility help\u201d in the U.K., while he attempted to make a bid on the Silverstone racing track with Guggenheim Partners. Epstein hosted a meeting at his NYC townhouse with Peter Mandelson, a member of the U.K\u2019s House of Lords, and Mitchell. The deal fizzled out and Mitchell said he was looking for new partners and asked Epstein if he could pitch the deal to the \u201cSultan.\u201d\nBack in 2011, Epstein appeared to have nearly blind trust in Mitchell.\n\u201c[I\u2019m] closing today on your deal\u201e with no due diligence. I am merely relying on your representations . thanks and good luck,\u201d said Epstein in one email.\nEpstein also offered to help Mitchell out when was short on capital. In 2011, Mitchell asked for Epstein to show \u201cproof of funds\u201d to purchase 7 million British pounds. Mitchell said he just needed a \u201cflash.\u201d In 2012, Mitchell once again asked Epstein to provide a \u201cproof of funds\u201d letter for $21 million to satisfy an \u201cedgy\u201d seller in another deal.\nA partnership in the red\nEpstein invested millions with Mitchell, in addition to loaning him money directly, according to financial documents made public by the DOJ. Many of those investments did not reap returns.\nMitchell and Epstein were partners on multiple condo developments, including an Upper East Side condo conversion project of a Beaux-Arts mansion at 320 East 82nd Street that Mitchell had purchased for $16 million in 2015. They also co-invested in a four-unit condo project in Flatiron that attracted A-listers like Chelsea Clinton, Jeff Gordon and Jennifer Lopez after launching sales in 2013.\nBut the Upper East Side development hardly saw any buyers, let alone celebrities, come through the door after Mitchell\u2019s then-wife, Douglas Elliman agent Jamie Mitchell, launched sales in 2017. After pestering Mitchell for months about a project update, Epstein\u2019s accountant Richard Kahn was dismayed at the numbers Mitchell sent over in May 2018. \u201cThis summary sheet is useless and [Mitchell] is clearly lost,\u201d he wrote to Epstein. \u201cIt appears from sales scenario\u2026we get back $0 on our $3,480,000 investment.\u201d\nMitchell\u2019s other projects were quickly unraveling, as well.\nHe bought the Herald Square Hotel for $40 million in 2015 and sunk $30 million into renovations and rebranding as the boutique, 98-room Life Hotel, with ground-floor dining from restaurateur Steven Hanson, who also invested in the project.\nNearly immediately, the hotel appeared to be a losing proposition. Emails from October 2017 show Mitchell asking his partner Hanson for $2,600 to cover overdraft fees, and by 2018 he was looking to sell the property but couldn\u2019t find a bidder to make him and his investors whole, according to a lawsuit filed against Mitchell in state court.\nEpstein played the role of strategic advisor and, when necessary, bridge lender. He told Mitchell he wanted \u201cno tie to hotel.\u201d In 2017, Epstein\u2019s company, Financial Trust Real Estate, agreed to extend a $1.5 million loan to Mitchell for the Life Hotel. In 2023, Mitchell lost the hotel after the lender foreclosed on the underlying loan.\nAs Mitchell became more indebted to Epstein, Epstein provided Mitchell other ways to make some cash, like helping broker Epstein\u2019s purchase of his neighbor, Bill Cosby\u2019s townhome on East 71st Street. He also enlisted Mitchell to auction off a Hercules statue and another Roman statue with a projected value of $1.5 million.\nStill, Mitchell continued to ask Epstein for multiple short-term loans.\nIn October 2018, Epstein wired Mitchell $70,000. In January 2019, Mitchell asked Epstein for $100,000 wire. Epstein\u2019s accountant emailed Epstein, \u201che\u2019s desperate.\u201d\nEpstein\u2019s accountant was especially dubious of Mitchell\u2019s ability to repay his debts and the whereabouts of the statues.\n\u201cSeems like he is stumbling out of control all answers noncommittal..and info he gives us is never accurate,\u201d said Kahn.\nKahn emailed Mitchell, \u201cquite disturbing that your story keeps changing\u2026 you should be more careful as jeffrey trusts you yet you give me bad info every day.\u201d\nRecords of ledgers from Epstein\u2019s accounts show that Mitchell and his wife made payments in increments as small as $2,200 to Epstein over the course, totaling over $600,000, ending in April 2019.\nMitchell\u2019s money problems\nAfter Epstein\u2019s death in a federal detention center while awaiting charges of sex trafficking minors, Mitchell continued to face financial and legal challenges.\nA New York judge found he owed over $6 million to a broker he stiffed on a land deal in Las Vegas over a decade prior. Two different law firms sued him for unpaid legal fees, he was evicted from his Midtown East co-op for failing to pay 18 months of maintenance fees and his wife filed for divorce.\nIn 2020, a roughly $42,000 check bounced for his children\u2019s tuition at elite private school Columbia Grammar &amp; Preparatory. When the school administrator was informed over email, she responded: \u201cYou did not tell me\u2026but it does not surprise me at all.\u201d\nBy 2021, he listed just $1,200 in his Chase bank account, according to a court filing.\nJust last month, Mitchell was sued by an art gallery owner who collects Pre-Columbian art for an unpaid loan of $34,200.\nIn an email, the gallery owner offered Mitchell one last chance to pay up before commencing litigation.\n\u201cThis situation has been prolonged by repeated misrepresentations and delays,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Illinois\u2019 data center boom may be headed for a time-out.\nGov. JB Pritzker is expected on Wednesday to call for a two-year suspension of the state\u2019s tax incentives for new data centers, a sharp pivot for a governor who has long touted business recruitment. The proposal, first\nreported\nby NBC News, would take effect July 1 and halt eligibility for Illinois\u2019 data center tax credit program while the state studies the industry\u2019s impact.\nUnder the plan,\nPritzker\nwill direct state agencies to examine how existing facilities are affecting the power grid, consumer energy bills and the broader economy. The goal, according to his office, is to ensure data centers are financially sustainable, don\u2019t drive up utility costs and fairly allocate infrastructure resources. The Democratic-controlled\nGeneral Assembly\nwould need to sign off.\nThe move comes as hyperscale facilities tied to artificial intelligence demands proliferate nationwide, often with rich incentive packages attached. Illinois has been part of that push. But\nbacklash\nhas been building from Oregon to Texas to Virginia, where residents have raised concerns about electricity consumption, water usage and limited permanent job creation.\nPritzker\nsignaled earlier this month that he\u2019s wary of approving projects that could push residential rates higher.\n\u201cIf they do threaten to raise rates, we\u2019ve got to slow them down,\u201d he said, adding that lawmakers will take up the issue this spring.\nOther governors are recalibrating, too. Pennsylvania\u2019s Josh Shapiro recently outlined new criteria for developers seeking state resources, while Florida\u2019s Ron DeSantis has backed guardrails around growth. In Georgia, lawmakers passed a bill last year to curb incentives, though Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed it.\nA freeze in Illinois could complicate land purchases and speculative infrastructure wagers in exurban and industrial corridors that have been marketed as prime data center territory, the outlet reported. The sector has been one of the few bright spots for large-scale development sites amid sluggish office and uneven multifamily growth.\nPritzker\u2019s office stressed that Illinois still exports roughly 20 percent of the electricity it generates and remains open to business, but the message is clear that the AI gold rush won\u2019t grow unchecked for the next couple of years.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The 8,200-square-foot house sits on nearly an acre just outside of the gated Cocoplum neighborhood.\nJeter, via a Delaware LLC, paid $6.5 million for the home in 2018, which means the property just sold for more than double that amount. It was on the market with Alex Pirez\u2019s Mocca Realty, most recently asking $14.9 million. Compass agent Maurice Boschetti represented the buyer.\nJeter, a hall of famer and five-time World Series champion, set team records during his 20-year career with the Yankees with the most hits, doubles and games played. Jeter headed to Miami in 2017 when he became CEO and part owner of the Miami Marlins, a role he held until 2022.\nIn 2021, Jeter and his wife, Hannah, sold their waterfront estate in Tampa\nfor $22.5 million\n, then a record for the Tampa Bay region. The property, on the Davis Islands, had been rented to\nTom Brady and his then-wife\n, model and businesswoman Gisele B\u00fcndchen.\nThe Old Cutler Road home includes a pool, basketball court, summer kitchen and outdoor entertaining areas. The house also has a primary suite, a chef\u2019s kitchen, wine cellar, office and elevator. It was built in 2004.\nThe LLC linked to Jeter paid $16.6 million in 2021 for a double-lot nearby in Gables Estates, where he is building a waterfront mansion, records show.\nCoral Gables has seen a big increase in home prices at the very high end amid a flurry of ultra luxury sales. Last month, University of Miami booster John Ruiz listed his waterfront Gables Estates mansion\nfor $175 million\n, marking the second most expensive listing in Miami-Dade.\u00a0Last year, luxury homebuilder Alex Pirez sold his waterfront Gables Estates mansion\nfor $55 million\n, and in a separate sale, billionaire businessman Jorge Mas recently purchased a mansion in the same gated community\nfor $75 million\n, a source previously told\nTRD\n.\n",

        "content": "David Weinreb nabbed a tenant for\nhis West Chelsea penthouse\nfor a whopping $177,500 per month.\nThe former CEO of Howard Hughes and founder of real estate investment firm Weinreb Ventures inked a roughly year-long lease for his full-floor apartment at 551 West 21st Street,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nBespoke\u2019s Laura Klein arranged the off-market rental deal.\nThe monthly price is significantly higher than some of the units previously reported to be the city\u2019s priciest, including the\n$150,000 Bad Bunny reportedly agreed to pay\nin October 2023 to rent the penthouse at the Jardim in Chelsea and the\n$95,000 rate\nfetched in December by an apartment at Naftali Group\u2019s the Benson on the Upper East Side.\nThe eye-popping lease comes amid\na rush of demand and record-breaking prices\nhave popped up across downtown Manhattan.\nLast year, financier Harsh Padia and his wife, interior designer Purvi Padia, sold their apartment at 150 Charles for\n$60 million\n, setting a new ceiling for condo sales in the area. Zeckendorf and Atlas Capital also snagged a\n$129 million\nsigned contract for multiple units at their 80 Clarkson development in December.\nWeinreb purchased the then-unfinished condo from the building\u2019s developer, Scott Resnick, for\n$38 million\nin 2017. Four years later, he sought to offload the 6,500-square-foot condo for $50 million, though after nearly a year on the market without finding a buyer, Weinreb pulled the unit and finished construction. He\nlisted it again\nin April for $75 million, but removed it just three months later.\nKlein declined to comment on the identity of the tenant.\nThe five-bedroom, five-bathroom condo has more than 4,500 square feet of outdoor space, including a rooftop terrace featuring what the Streeteasy listing describes as the \u201clargest private outdoor pool\u201d in the city. It also has a kitchen designed by celebrity chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten.\nAmenities in the 44-unit building, designed by Norman Foster\u2019s firm, include 24-hour doormen, fitness center, yoga studio and residents\u2019 lounge.\nResnick\u2019s SR Capital filed plans for the building in 2013 and completed construction on the project roughly two years later. Other notable buyers in the building include Hong Kong billionaire Karen Lo, who shelled out more than\n$29 million\nfor two 15th-floor units in 2016.\nWeinreb, who stepped down from Howard Hughes in 2019 and launched his Texas-based firm the following year, also owns an estate in North Dallas, which he listed for $25 million in March. He built the 20,000-square-foot mansion on North 40 Place in the 2000s.\nWeinreb Ventures is also working on a\nmegadevelopment in Frisco\n, outside of Dallas, the first phase of which includes three buildings with commercial space and more than 1,000 apartments.\n",

Polashuk is joining Gideon Strategic Partners, where he\u2019ll be a vice president with a focus on real estate. The Los Angeles-based wealth management firm and registered investment adviser, led by CEO Robert Amoruso, is expanding to Miami.\nPolashuk\u2019s departure from Compass follows the $4 billion merger between Compass and Anywhere Real Estate, now under one umbrella company called Compass International Holdings, led by CEO Robert Reffkin. The brokerage Compass is now led by president Neda Navab.\nPolashuk said the merger did not play a role in his decision to leave the company. His experience will come into play as Gideon looks to invest more in real estate.\nPolashuk will keep his real estate license active with Compass.\nPolashuk joined Compass in 2017, when the brokerage had about 60 agents in South Florida. The southeastern region now includes roughly 5,000 agents. He worked closely with Beth Butler, Compass\u2019 former regional director of new development for the Southeast, who\nretired at the end of 2024\n.\nPolashuk called his time at Compass \u201cnothing short of incredible.\u201d\nNavab notified agents of Polashuk\u2019s planned departure in a company-wide email sent on Wednesday, calling him a \u201cstrong and steady leader\u201d and a trusted adviser. John Bilek, a regional vice president and head of sales management nationwide, will oversee Florida and Georgia. Managing Directors Adam Vellano and Steven Busch will remain in place, Navab said.\nCompass has recruited a handful of top talent over the past year, including Miltiadis Kastanis,\nwho helped the firm secure\nthe exclusive sales and marketing assignment for Nahla Capital\u2019s Rosewood-branded Raleigh Miami Beach development.\nFollowing the Compass-Anywhere merger, Anywhere\u2019s former CEO Ryan Schneider and CTO Rudy Wolfs left the company.

        "content": "Gov. JB Pritzker made policies to increase housing supply a key focus of his annual budget address on Wednesday, marking a win for the\nIllinois Realtors\ntrade association\u2019s yearslong push for the policies in Springfield.\nIllinois Realtors CEO Jeff Baker told\nThe Real Deal\nthe governor\u2019s backing is a turning point for the group\u2019s policy efforts.\n\u201cThis is a major step forward for the real estate industry in Illinois,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWe have seen supply and inventory put pressure on brokerages, on families, on city budgets. To have this get to this point is a major win.\u201d\nDuring his State of the State address on Wednesday, Pritzker endorsed legislation that would strip municipalities of the ability to ban certain types of multi-unit housing, allowing the construction of larger buildings in areas typically zoned for single-family homes. It also calls for allowing\naccessory dwelling units\nstatewide.\n\u201cThe problem is clear. Rent is too high, and homeownership is too far out of reach,\u201d Pritzker said in the address. \u201cThe cause is clear, too. We are not building enough homes fast enough.\u201d\nThe plan, called \u201cBuilding Up Illinois Developments\u201d and first reported by Capitol News Illinois, is aimed at addressing Illinois\u2019\npersistent housing shortage\n. The state ranked 48th out of the 50 states in 2024 for new housing construction per capita, according to an analysis from Construction Coverage. The proposal is similar to the bills that Illinois Realtors, the statewide group representing real estate agents, has supported in recent years.\nThe proposal would set a statewide standard that allows building multi-unit buildings on lots zoned for any residential use of 5,000 square feet or more. The allowed density will be on a sliding scale, with eight-unit buildings allowed on the largest lots without the need to seek zoning approval.\nThe plan would also allow accessory dwelling units to be built on any land zoned for residential use. Chicago officials passed an ordinance allowing accessory dwelling units in certain areas last year.\nMany lawmakers in the Democratic-majority legislature have seen the need for these policies, Baker said. But opposition from local governments that don\u2019t want to lose zoning authority have stunted their passage, he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of other issues that can grab attention, and for this one to be on (Pritzker\u2019s) short list \u2026 that\u2019s a huge win for the real estate industry,\u201d Baker said.\nIn addition to zoning reform, Pritzker\u2019s plan aims to address the soft costs of development. The plan calls for a uniform standard for impact fees \u2014 charges levied by local governments on new development to pay for public services, Baker said.\nCurrently, municipalities often divert those fees into their general funds rather than infrastructure specific to the new housing, Baker said. The new law would standardize the formula and penalize towns that don\u2019t use the money for its intended purpose.\nAlthough the realtors\u2019 lobbying group has made some headway in changing local policies, Baker said municipalities have largely resisted changing zoning and impact fee policies on their own.\n\u201cWe have shown state leaders that NIMBYism is ingrained at that local level to the point that if we\u2019re really going to make a difference here, it\u2019s going to require statewide change,\u201d Baker said.\nPritzker is proposing committing $250 million to fund the policy shifts. The funding includes $100 million for infrastructure grants to help prepare sites for denser housing, $100 million to assist developments with limited access to capital, and $50 million to boost the Illinois Housing Development Authority\u2019s low-income housing programs, Baker said.\nIllinois Realtors\nbuilt up its lobbying team\nearlier this year to prepare for the legislative session, bringing on former local government staffers to work with Cook County and Chicago officials. The group added Melia Carter, formerly leading government affairs for the Midwest for Verizon, as vice president of governmental affairs.\nThe governor will hold a roundtable with industry leaders Wednesday on the proposal, Baker said. The group will be working with local government officials and state lawmakers over the next few months as the legislation is being considered, he said.\n",

        "content": "San Francisco\u2019s recently approved Family Zoning plan is under fire from both sides of the housing debate, with dueling lawsuits challenging the city\u2019s newly adopted blueprint for growth.\nIn December, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors approved\nMayor Daniel Lurie\u2019s rezoning plan\nthat allows for more housing options in neighborhoods with greater access to growth-supporting economic opportunities and services like public transit, parks, retail and community facilities. One lawsuit alleges the city\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t go far enough to increase housing supply, while the other claims the ordinance threatens neighborhoods and needs further study before implementation, the San Francisco Examiner\nreported\n.\nThe opposition lawsuit, filed last month by a coalition of neighborhood and small business groups including Neighborhoods United SF and Small Business Forward, claims the city rushed a \u201chaphazard\u201d plan through and \u201capproved [it] with little meaningful analysis.\u201d\nThe complaint claims that the\nCalifornia Environmental Quality Act\nrequires additional consideration. According to the groups, the final plan is \u201cdramatically\u201d different from the city\u2019s 2023 housing element and includes provisions for denser and taller development in historic northern neighborhoods that were not studied as part of the earlier housing element. Opponents believe the Family Zoning plan will incentivize speculative redevelopment, strain infrastructure and displace rent-controlled tenants and small businesses.\n\u201cIt was the ultimate game of goalpost moving,\u201d Romalyn Schmaltz, a 20-year North Beach resident and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, told the Examiner of the development process behind Lurie\u2019s law. \u201cThe Family Zoning plan was inappropriately planned and was rushed through without sufficient input and was understudied.\u201d\nA second lawsuit, filed by pro-housing groups\nYIMBY Law\n, the California Housing Defense Fund and Californians for Homeownership, argues the rezoning doesn\u2019t go far enough to meet state housing production targets and unlawfully deviates from the housing element\u2019s commitments. The organizations cite city projections showing the plan could yield as few as 8,500 to 14,600 units by 2045,\nwell short of the 82,069 units\nthat San Francisco is required by the state to plan for by 2031.\n\u201cThe Family Zoning plan is not good enough,\u201d Sonja Trauss, executive director of YIMBY Law, told the Examiner. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t implement what was promised in the housing element. Maybe it\u2019s better than what we had before, but it\u2019s not going to produce the 82,000 units the city needs.\u201d\nSan Francisco Supervisors approved the upzoning plan to avoid missing a Jan. 31 state deadline, after which the city faced the\npotential implementation of builder\u2019s remedy\n, forcing officials to approve any proposed projects that meet basic standards, as well as the loss of more than $100 million per year in state funding. Lurie\u2019s office is standing by the approved plan.\n\u201cAs the cost of housing continues to rise, the Family Zoning Plan is going to help ensure that the next generation of San Franciscans can afford to raise their kids here,\u201d a Lurie spokesperson told the Examiner. \u201cBut our administration is not going to hand the keys to Sacramento. We\u2019re going to meet state requirements while protecting what\u2019s so special about our neighborhoods and our city.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The Dallas Morning News\nreported\nthat City Council members are slated to vote on the deal on Monday.\nUnder the proposal, AT&amp;T must invest at least $1.4 billion to build a minimum 2 million square feet of office, amenity and retail space on 54 acres at\n5400 Legacy Drive\n. The company would be required to employ 10,000 full-time workers at the campus and occupy it for at least 25 years. Partial occupancy is targeted for the second half of 2028.\nCEO John Stankey\nannounced in January that the Fortune 500 firm would relocate its global headquarters to Plano, marking a major reinvestment in the city\u2019s Legacy business district. The land is part of a 215-acre tract owned by Dallas-based NexPoint that includes the former Electronic Data Systems campus founded by H. Ross Perot Sr.\nHalf of the $20 million grant would offset redevelopment costs at the site. Even so, Plano\u2019s economic development fund would retain roughly $36.8 million for future projects, according to city documents. AT&amp;T must meet specified construction and employment benchmarks to receive the grants and rebates.\nPlano Mayor John Muns has framed the relocation as a generational win, building on the suburb\u2019s track record of luring corporate heavyweights such as Toyota Motor North America and JCPenney.\nThe flip side:\nDowntown Dallas\nstands to take a hit.\nAT&amp;T has been headquartered in Downtown Dallas\nsince 2008\nand leases the 37-story Whitacre Tower at 208 South Akard Street, owned by Pacific Elm Properties and Dundon Capital Partners, through the end of 2031. The company occupies roughly 3 million square feet in the city \u2014 more than any other private employer, according to CoStar \u2014 and invested $100 million in its Discovery District, which opened in 2021.\nDowntown Dallas has estimated a full relocation could slash downtown property values by as much as 30 percent, or about $2.7 billion.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The purported deal was touted as another victory for Florida in the Sunshine vs. Golden State battle for billionaires, and a sign that\nCalifornia\u2019s proposed 5 percent wealth tax\nwas driving out its richest residents.\nBut multiple market insiders confirmed to\nThe Real Deal\nthat the\nCancros are not selling their estate\n, a revelation that triggered a hunt for Zuckerberg and Chan\u2019s true target.\nWith the 7 Indian Creek Island Road compound identified, it remains unclear how seriously the couple is considering the purchase or whether it would involve a relocation to Florida. The estate would likely not be completed until mid-2027 at the earliest. A move at that time would not spare them from the multi-billion dollar tax bill they would get if California voters in November approve the wealth tax, which would apply to assets held as of Jan. 1, 2026.\n\u2013\u2013\nKate Hinsche",

        "content": "A River North parking lot that has cycled through condo and office dreams is finally getting a firm plan.\nA joint venture of Chicago-based firms Third Coast Real Estate and ZSD landed $44 million in construction financing for a nine-story, 149-unit apartment project at 300-324 West Huron Street, a site that has sat largely untouched for a decade, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. JLL arranged the capital stack, which includes a three-year, $38.1 million construction loan from CIBC and $6 million in preferred equity from N3 Capital Management.\nThe total development cost is pegged at $57 million.\nThe project is breaking ground as downtown Chicago\u2019s multifamily pipeline has thinned to a trickle. Just three major apartment developments totaling fewer than 600 units are slated for completion in 2026, according to Integra Realty Resources. The publication reported that with debt and equity markets still tight, that scarcity has helped push rents higher and given well-capitalized sponsors an opening.\nThird Coast founder\nReed Edwards\nsaid the venture is betting its March 2027 completion will align with continued strength in Chicago\u2019s rental fundamentals. Translation: fewer cranes today could mean pricing power tomorrow.\nThe development will rise on a full-block surface lot along Huron Street between Orleans and Franklin streets. ZSD, led by Zev Salomon,\nbought the land\nfor $9 million from North Wells Capital, which had\npreviously planned\na 260,000-square-foot office building before shelving the proposal amid pandemic-era office fallout. At one point,\nanother developer\nhad approvals for a 24-story condo tower, but that plan also fizzled.\nUnlike many recent city projects, the West Huron development is proceeding under existing zoning, according to the outlet. That means it sidesteps Chicago\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance, which mandates that developers seeking zoning changes set aside 20 percent of units as affordable or pay an in-lieu fee.\nPlans call for a mix of studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments, along with roughly 3,700 square feet of ground-floor retail and 21 parking spaces.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Gencom shelled out six figures for The Ritz-Carlton Central Park, adding another trophy to its Manhattan hotel portfolio.\nThe Miami-based investment firm acquired the 253-key luxury hotel at\n50 Central Park South\nfor about $320 million from Westbrook Partners, a source with knowledge of the deal said. Property records show a sale price of $270 million, but that figure does not typically include fixtures and non-real estate assets.\nBanco Inbursa provided a $235 million loan for the acquisition, according to property records. The Mexican lender assumed the debt from KeyBank, which had\noriginated the financing\n. Before the assumption, the loan balance had been paid down by $40 million, records show.\nA Newmark team led by Adam Spies, Mark Schoenholtz and Marcella Fasulo represented Westbrook in the deal.\nThe property sits at the corner of Central Park South and Sixth Avenue, directly across from the park. The hotel is the latest acquisition in Gencom\u2019s recent New York buying spree. In 2024, the firm acquired the\nThompson Central Park Hotel\n, followed by the\nInterContinental New York Times Square\nin December 2025.\nFounded in 1987 by Karim Alibhai, Gencom has nearly $8 billion in assets under management. The firm\u2019s broader holdings include properties affiliated with brands such as Four Seasons, St. Regis and Auberge, among others.\nThe Central Park South property features park-facing rooms and 47 suites, a Club Lounge with panoramic views and a La Prairie Spa. In a press release, Gencom said the acquisition reflects continued confidence in New York\u2019s luxury hotel sector.\nWestbrook\nfirst bought\na stake in the Ritz-Carlton Park from Millennium Partners for $105 million in 2012. The firm is also reportedly selling a 300-key Washington, D.C., Ritz-Carlton property to Trinity Partners, though the sale price of that transaction has yet to be disclosed.\nNewmark and Gencom declined to comment.

        "content": "Jeremy Morton caused a stir when he picked up two pieces of prime retail space in Sag Harbor about a year ago.\nThe developer has been a quiet player in the East End\u2019s restaurant and commercial scene in recent years. He purchased local hotspots\nRuschmeyer\u2019s\nand\nRick\u2019s Crabby Cowboy Caf\u00e9\nin 2020 and 2021, respectively, and bought \u2014 and\nlater sold\n\u2014 Morty\u2019s Oyster Stand in Montauk.\nIn 2024, he made headlines when he spent\n$8.4 million\non Southampton Village\u2019s largest commercial property on a prime corner, and sparked more attention later that year when he paid\n$30 million for two properties\nin downtown Sag Harbor. But\nwhile he pursues\nmulti-million-dollar redevelopment plans for the site, lenders have claimed Morton stopped repaying the debts.\nAtlanta-based U.S. Strategic Capital, a short-term lender to small businesses, filed a lawsuit this month to foreclose on two of Morton\u2019s East Hampton properties. The suit, filed in Suffolk County, claimed his development firm, Excelsior Development NY, defaulted on a $3.8 million loan from July.\nMorton personally guaranteed the loan, allowing USSC to pursue the developer\u2019s personal assets if a potential foreclosure sale doesn\u2019t cover his debts, which the suit places at more than $4 million.\nA foreclosure sale would also need to cover the senior loans on Morton\u2019s homes, according to the complaint. The developer took out a mortgage of over $5 million last March on the property at 38 Chatfields Ridge Road, which appears to be one of his personal residences. He also took out a mortgage with a principal amount of around $3.8 million in 2023 on the home at 126 Long Lane.\n\u201cI am addressing these matters in the ordinary course,\u201d Morton said in a statement. \u201cI take my obligations seriously and will continue to work constructively with all stakeholders as issues are evaluated and resolved.\u201d\nNonpayment accusations land on local developer\nOne day after USSC\u2019s lawsuit, Morton was hit with another complaint, claiming he defaulted on roughly $200,000 worth of small business loans that he personally guaranteed in 2021. The loans were tied to an entity with the same address as Provisions Natural Foods, a local grocery chain with locations in Sag Harbor and, formerly, Water Mill. The Water Mill store\nannounced\nin 2024 that it would not be reopening, and would instead debut a new branch at the Southampton commercial corner Morton bought in 2024.\nThe action followed a roughly $330,000 judgment secured by a building supplies company against Morton\u2019s development firm last month over unpaid materials purchased last summer. Morton personally guaranteed the debt and signed a confession of judgment, allowing the judgment to be entered against him.\nThe two lawsuits and confession of judgment claim that Morton stopped making payments \u2014 for the supplies and on his loans \u2014 in November.\nIt was around this time that Morton\u2019s development firm took out a cash advance from Simply Funding, a source of short-term capital that buys discounted receivables from companies. Simply Funding paid Morton $310,000 for $415,000 worth of receivables, requiring him to repay roughly $10,000 each month until hitting the $415,000 he owed, according to documents in a lawsuit filed last month by Simply Funding.\nBut Morton only made it two weeks before he stopped making payments, Simply Funding claimed. The developer also signed a confession judgment and personally guaranteed the amount owed, which is almost $400,000, according to a court judgment.\nAll told, Morton has personally guaranteed roughly $5 million in loans and other debts in the last year, according to these four filings.\nFor now, Morton is advancing on his plans to redevelop the downtown Sag Harbor retail properties at 2 Main Street and 22 Long Island Avenue. He secured a\n$40 million loan\nin February 2025 from Mavick Capital to fund the acquisition and redevelopment of the properties.\nBut beyond appearing at local meetings to curry favor and discuss his plans for the properties, the developer has avoided making public waves for his projects. He previously declined to confirm the acquisition to 27East.\n\u201cPeople are buying properties in the Hamptons every day,\u201d\nhe told the outlet\n. \u201cIs there some kind of obligation for the media to write about it?\u201d\n",

        "content": "The owner of Miami Beach\u2019s Sixty Sixty Resort thwarted a foreclosure auction at the last minute by filing for bankruptcy.\nCoconut Grove-based Bloom Hotels 6060 filed a chapter 11 petition in Miami federal court on Monday, a day before the 16-story waterfront building at 6060 Indian Creek Drive was set to be sold to satisfy a lender\u2019s $23.7 million judgment, the South Florida Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe owner listed \u200bassets and liabilities each in the $10 million to $50 million range, according to the petition signed by the entity\u2019s manager, Richard Valdes. Bloom Hotels 6060 owns all 87 condo-hotel units at the Sixty Sixty, which was completed in 1992 and converted to a condo-hotel in 2005.\nIn 2022, an affiliate of Bloom Hotels 6060 paid\n$23.5 million\nfor the then-82-key property, acquiring all of the units from a joint venture between\nIntegra Investments\nand Sagar Desai\u2019s\nActivate Hospitality\n.\nAt the time, the buyer included Miami-based Bloom Ventures, led by CEO David Harari, as the lead partner of Bloom Hotels 6060. The firm planned to operate Sixty Sixty as a full hotel, possibly under a Hilton brand, expand the room count and renovate the building. But Bloom Ventures sold its interest shortly after the 2020 purchase.\nIn June of last year,\nDe Paz Family Investment\nfiled a foreclosure lawsuit against Bloom Hotels 6060, the property\u2019s condo association and loan guarantors Valdes, Daniel Araf and Todd Linden. The trio manage Miami-based entities that own Bloom Hotels 6060, corporate records show. Linden and Valdes lead Miami-based Circle Capital Partners.\nDe Paz alleged Bloom Hotels 6060 defaulted on a $21 million loan taken out in 2023. In December, Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Beatrice Butchko Sanchez granted final judgment in favor of De Paz, including missed interest payments and fees. A week ago, the judge denied Bloom Hotels 6060\u2019s motion to cancel the Feb. 17 foreclosure sale, court records show.\nBloom Hotels 6060\u2019s largest unsecured creditors include Turkey-based GNCR Holdings, which is owed $2 million; Miami law firm Garcia-Menocal, Irias &amp; Pastori, which is owed $1.16 million; and Davie-based ACOE 1, which is owed $867,863, the bankruptcy petition states.\n\u2014 Francisco Alvarado",

It\u2019s the $7.5 million price tag in\nPlano\n.\nThe six-bedroom, nine-bathroom home at 6509 Sudbury Road in Plano sold at the end of January, according to public records. With a listing price of $7.5 million, it was\none of the most expensive December listings\nin the state, according to the Houston Association of Realtors, which tracks residential listings in the major metro areas of Texas.\nIt\u2019s also near the top of Plano\u2019s luxury market. At present, just one home in Plano is currently listed at a higher price: a $12.8 million, 14,100-square-foot mansion at 6413 Old Gate Road.\nThe asking price of the home on Sudbury amounts to about $580 per square foot. The final sale price was not disclosed.\nThe sellers are Rahim and Salima Dhanani, and the buyer is the Andrew J. McFaul Trust, public records show. Compass agent Jackie Dorbritz represented the sellers, but the buyer was unrepresented, according to Redfin.\nThe home spans about 13,000 square feet on a lot of 0.86 acres. Designed by\nSimmie Cooper\n\u2014 better known for work in Dallas\u2019 luxury enclaves, the Park Citie \u2014, the home melds elements of traditional European villas with contemporary glitz. Fluted columns frame the front entrance and line the halls, and a Swarovski chandelier hangs in the primary suite. Additionally, the house has a dance room with an illuminated dance floor and a disco ball.\nThe sellers had some difficulty selling the home. They listed the property for brief periods between 2020 and 2024, pricing it between $7.2 million and $6.9 million. It last hit the market in December, outranking three of the top 10 most expensive residential listings in Texas for that month.\nThe top sales in the state have historically clustered in the Park Cities in Dallas. However, last year a new Collin County residential price record was set when BuzzBalls founder Merrilee Kick bought the 6.75-acre estate at\n5805 Red Wolf Lane for $15.9 million\n. It was the only Plano home to rank in the top 10 luxury sales in the Metroplex in 2025.\n",

In a statement through a spokesperson, the firm cited slower than expected stabilization, a wave of\nnew downtown hotel supply\nand persistently high interest rates.\nOpening during the pandemic didn\u2019t help.\n\u201cThese factors \u2014 including opening during Covid and a broader softness in the San Antonio hotel market \u2014 created challenges that were not anticipated and challenging to overcome,\u201d the firm\u2019s spokesperson told the outlet, adding that the situation reflects market conditions rather than the property\u2019s long-term viability.\nThe foreclosure comes less than two years after Miami-based 3650 REIT provided a $38 million refinancing in 2022, followed by the $44 million refinancing from Sunrise and Southern in 2024. At the time, Sunrise and Southern CEO Brian Sedrish said the loan highlighted confidence in DC Partners as well as demand for upscale accommodations in Texas.\nNow that notion is being tested.\nThe 162-key hotel was among a new class of high-end\nhospitality projects\naimed at elevating San Antonio\u2019s\nRiver Walk offerings\n. But as new rooms have come online and borrowing costs have climbed, operators have faced margin pressure in a market that historically depends on convention and leisure demand, according to the publication.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Soon-ish, housing projects filed in certain community districts can skip City Council review.\nIn\nNovember\n, voters\napproved\nthe \u201chousing fast-track,\u201d a condensed version of the city\u2019s land use review process.\nThe fast-track will be available to some projects proposed in the 12 community districts with the lowest rates of affordable housing development. To be eligible, a housing project must be (at least) subject to the affordability requirements under the city\u2019s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program.\nSuch projects will avoid City Council review during the city\u2019s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, or Ulurp. The local community board and borough president will also review the project concurrently for 60 days, further cutting down the review timeline.\nBut first, the city has to identify the districts.\nThe city will look at new affordable housing development in each district every five years. The first tally will look at apartments initiated between July 1, 2021, and June 30, 2026.\nThe Department of City Planning recently released proposed rules for calculating development rates in each community district.\nThe proposed methodology relies on two metrics. The first: The number of new affordable housing units added to a community district over a five-year period. \u201cNew units\u201d are counted if a regulatory agreement or restrictive declaration has been signed and a permit has been issued by the Department of Buildings.\nRequiring both of those milestones \u201censures that new affordable units are sufficiently far along in the development process that they are reasonably certain to be delivered,\u201d the proposed rules state.\nThe second: The total number of housing units in a district at the start of each five-year cycle, based on the latest Census (plus or minus any units built or demolished in the intervening years, based on DOB records). To establish the development rate in each district, the number of new units will be divided by the total number of housing units in the district.\nCity Planning has to release the list of 12 districts by Oct. 1, and then every five years after that. Projects can apply for the fast track in these districts starting Jan. 1.\nA hearing on the proposed rules is slated for April 1.\nThe \u201cfast-track\u201d is one of three approved ballot measures aimed at easing housing approvals. One allows developers to appeal the City Council\u2019s rejection of a housing project, while another creates a shorter review process (dubbed Expedited Land Use Review Procedure, or Elurp) for modest projects.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Are you working on a project that may be affected by the housing ballot measures? Are you eyeing a development in a district that you suspect will make the fast-track list? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: An appellate court this week upheld the\ndismissal\nof a lawsuit brought by the Carnegie House co-op board, which sought to halt ground lease negotiations and the state\u2019s rent laws as they pertain to setting initial rents in the event that the co-op building is deconverted and turned into rent-stabilized apartments. Last year, Judge Arthur Engoron threw the lawsuit out, calling it \u201cpremature.\u201d\nThe appellate court agreed, noting that \u201cdeconversion and the ensuing harms\nenvisaged by plaintiffs may never come to pass.\u201d\nThe recent ruling is the latest win for landowners, Rubie Schron and David Werner. Late last year, another court\nfound\nin favor of the owners, signing off on increasing the ground rent from $4.36 million to $24 million.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 The Public Authorities Control Board on Wednesday advanced plans to build 105 income-restricted homeownership units at the former Lincoln Correctional Facility at 31-33 West 110th Street. The board signed off on $18.7 million in funding from the state Homes and Community Renewal\u2019s Affordable Homeownership Program. The project is being developed by Infinite Horizons, L+M Development Partners, Urbane Development Group and Lemor Development Group.\n\u2014 The Mamdani administration on Wednesday broke ground on 341 affordable housing units at a former NYPD parking lot in East Harlem. The project, dubbed Timbale Terrace, has been a long time in the making. The project was proposed in 2016 as part of the East Harlem Neighborhood Plan. A developer for the site was\nselected\nin 2021.\n\u2014 ICYMI, the mayor\nappointed\nfive new members to the Rent Guidelines Board. He also reappointed one of the tenant reps.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$24.2 million\nfor a 3,547-square-foot sponsor-sale condominium unit at 50 West 66th Street in Lincoln Square. Beth Benalloul and Hilary Landis of the Corcoran Group\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was $269.7 million for the\nhotel\nand\ncommercial\nportions of The Ritz-Carlton New York, Central Park, at 50 Central Park South. As\nTRD reported\ntoday, the full price of the acquisition was $320 million.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$33.7 million\nfor a 4,628-square-foot condo at 520 Park Avenue in Lenox Hill. Lisa Larson and Angela Wu with Sotheby\u2019s have the listing. The unit last sold for\n$28.25 million in 2022\n.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permits filed were for a proposed 13,331-square-foot, 16-unit project at 4572 Manhattan College Parkway in Kingsbridge. Lester Katz filed the permit on behalf of Nasser Ghorchian.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

After the community was developed, the lots went up for sale in the early \u201990s for a reported starting price of $2.5 million.\nSeveral A-listers have called Brentwood Country Estates home over the years.

        "content": "Ikea is growing its presence in Los Angeles with a new location in Culver City.\nThe Swedish furniture giant is planning to open its first city-center store in the Los Angeles area at 3225 Helms Avenue in Culver City\u2019s Helms Design District later this year,\nL.A. Business First\nand the\nDesert Sun\nreported.\nIt will be Ikea\u2019s 10th outpost in Southern California. The company runs full-sized Ikea locations in Burbank, Carson, Costa Mesa and Covina, as well as one small-format store in Arcadia and plan-and-order points with pickup in Santa Monica, Thousand Oaks and Ontario. Ikea\u2019s city-center stores comprise showroom-like outposts rather than the company\u2019s typical suburban warehouse sites, allowing urban customers to explore products in person and have them delivered to their homes.\nThe Culver City Ikea is planned to span approximately\u202f38,050\u202fsquare feet and feature a central planning area and the chain\u2019s signature food court. Ikea is planning to open 10 new stores across the country this year, including locations in Chicago; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and Fort Collins, Colorado.\nIkea first announced its Culver City plans in its\nfiscal year 2025 annual summary\n, per L.A. Business First. Last fiscal year, the company reported $5.3 billion in total sales, including $1.9 billion in e-commerce, despite \u201cchallenging external factors including increased inflation and waning consumer confidence.\u201d Ikea stores saw nearly 61 million guests, with more than 457 million online visitors.\nThe company in recent years has been sinking more money into expansion efforts across the country. In 2023, Ingka Group, the largest owner and operator of Ikea stores, announced a\nnearly $2.2 billion investment\nto open more than a dozen new outposts. Ikea has 12 franchisees overall.\nIngka Group is also\nacquiring a portfolio of malls\nfrom coast to coast with plans to anchor those retail centers with Ikea stores. The owner and operator hopes to position the new sites as go-to destinations for customers with eateries, children\u2019s play areas and new WeWork-style spaces as part of its\nHej! Workshop\ncoworking brand. In 2024, Ingka Group\u2019s Ingka Centres finished the transformation of a six-story property in San Francisco into the city\u2019s\nfirst Ikea store\n, outfitted with a 46,000-square-foot Hej! Workshop and a multilevel food hall called Saluhall.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The West Loop\u2019s most complicated game of financial chicken has finally hit the courthouse steps.\nLess than two weeks after\nThe Real Deal\nrevealed a foreclosure lawsuit was under serious consideration by the lenders for the 23-story office building at\n300 South Riverside Plaza\nin Chicago, the debt\u2019s special servicer, LNR Partners, officially pulled the trigger. LNR on Friday filed a $167 million complaint against the landlord, a joint venture of\nRubin Schron\u2019s Cammeby\u2019s International\nand David Lowenfeld\u2019s World Wide Group, according to public records.\nLNR, acting on behalf of bondholders in pools of securitized debt, has moved to seize the 1.1 million-square-foot office tower, ramping up a months-long standoff over multiple alleged defaults on a combined $342 million in debt tied to the property.\nThe lawsuit marks the messy climax of a bifurcated ownership structure gone wrong. On one side are the leasehold owners, David Werner and Joseph Mizrachi, who have been allegedly underwater on their own $175 million building loan since late 2022. On the other side are the fee owners \u2014 a venture of Rubin Schron\u2019s Cammeby\u2019s International and David Lowenfeld\u2019s World Wide Group \u2014 who hold the land with a lease requiring ground rent payments from Werner and Mizrachi.\nThe house of cards collapsed in October when Werner and Mizrachi allegedly stopped paying ground rent checks. Without the cash flow, the landowners allegedly couldn\u2019t service their own $167 million loan taken out in 2015 to fund their $220 million purchase of the ground from Werner and Mizrachi. LNR didn\u2019t wait long to lose patience; after issuing a notice of default in November and accelerating the debt in December, the servicer is now asking a judge for a receiver to take the property away from the Cammeby\u2019s and World Wide venture. LNR wants Scott Shefman of Farmington Hills, Michigan-based Friedman Real Estate appointed as receiver, legal filings show.\nFor Schron, the lawsuit marks a rare public slipup for his well-known New York-based firm, Cammeby\u2019s.\nFor Werner and Mizrachi \u2014 prolific buyers known for high-leverage plays \u2014 the 300 South Riverside foreclosure filing is a stinging rebuke of the\nground lease model once seeming like a clever way\nto slice the capital stack.\nAfter buying the property for $194 million in 2010, they tried previously to sell it in the mid-2010s, but failed to generate offers matching their pricing ambitions of about $335 million. They eventually settled on selling the land only in 2015 and continuing to hunt for the right buyer for the building. But one never materialized before the office market got rocked by the pandemic, vaporizing values for properties carrying heavy debt, like the landlords at the 300 South Riverside building.\nAn attorney for LNR declined to comment. Representatives of Cammeby\u2019s, World Wide, David Werner and Mizrachi\u2019s firm Third Millennium Group didn\u2019t return requests for comment. Shinhan Investment Corp., the South Korean lender whose $175 million loan to Werner and Mizrachi originated in 2017 before it fell into default several years ago, hasn\u2019t returned multiple requests for comment on how it intends to resolve the broken deal tied to the building portion at 300 South Riverside.\nDespite the fallout, Werner remains on an office distress buying spree in both Chicago and New York. Earlier this year, he and 601W Cos. nabbed the\nLoop\u2019s 175 West Jackson Boulevard building for $41 million\n\u2014 an 87 percent discount from its 2017 price \u2014 following another bargain buy of the building at 303 East Wacker.\nWerner\u2019s 2025 New York run featured discounted acquisitions of the properties at\nOne Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld Plaza for $270 million\nand 205 East 42nd Street for $165 million, plus a $700 million office-to-residential conversion loan for the building at 235 East 42nd Street.\nBack in Chicago,\nMizrachi and Hines are hunting an anchor tenant\nfor a proposed 600,000-square-foot tower at 590 West Madison.\nThe foreclosure lawsuit for the 300 South Riverside property is set for an initial hearing in August, online court records show, but additional motions filed in the lawsuit between now and then could prompt an earlier hearing.\n",

        "content": "The strength of the Chicago area\u2019s multifamily market now extends to the Wisconsin border, too.\nWestmont, Illinois-based Santefort Real Estate Group recently expanded into the market with its first two apartment complex purchases in the Badger State.\nSantefort bought The Fountain Ridge and Cobblestone Creek Apartments in Pleasant Prairie Wisconsin near the Illinois border for a combined $100 million, or about $234,000 per unit. The purchase of the two properties, which total 426 units, was backed by a $66 million loan arranged by Berkadia, according to people familiar with the deal.\nThe recent deals in southeast Wisconsin highlight a growing demand from multifamily investors for properties in the Chicago metro area and the\nMidwest in general.\nThe Midwest region began seeing momentum around 2022 when formerly hot markets like Austin, Nashville and Phoenix began to cool off. As interest rates began to tick up, Sun Belt cities\nstruggled with multifamily distress\nand an influx of development led to concerns of oversupply, weighing rents down.\nOn the other hand, effective rents in Chicago climbed 3.8 percent year-over-year to about $1,800, in the last quarter of 2025, according to MMG Real Estate Advisors. Nationally, average rent grew 0.6 percent to about $1,700 during the same time period, MMG found.\nIn southeast Wisconsin, investors benefit from proximity to both Chicago and Milwaukee, Santefort COO John Perkowski said, and it presents a \u201ctremendous long-term upside.\u201d\nThere\u2019s enthusiasm for the area across asset classes in the property market.\nOn the single-family side, neighboring Kenosha, Wisconsin ranked as the\nthird-hottest real estate market nationally\nlast fall, a Realtor.com analysis found. The city, about 60 miles north of Chicago, was joined by six other Wisconsin markets and two in Illinois in the top 20, when ranked by days on the market and activity on the website\u2019s listing page, a September report found.\nThe rankings reveal buyers are increasingly interested in low-cost markets outside major hubs like Chicago, where prices are rising and low inventory is squeezing availability.\nAnd renters are branching out too. Apartments in\nChicago\u2019s suburbs\nhave seen increased demand as\nrent in the city ticks up\namid dwindling multifamily supply. Lenders have been more eager to fund new developments and\nacquisitions\nin\nthe outer suburbs\nthan the city because of the\ncity\u2019s volatile political and property tax environment\n.\nThis year, Chicago is on track to see\nthe lowest number of new apartments completed since 2012\n, according to a recent report from Marcus &amp; Millichap. Less than 4,000 new units will be completed by the end of 2026, the brokerage found. But the Lake County-Kenosha submarket in the far northern suburbs of Chicago is slated to receive the most new units in 2026, the brokerage found.\nSantefort took note of that trend and\nbought a 181-unit apartment complex\nin Lombard, in the western suburbs where development remains more suppressed, for $46 million last year.\n",

        "content": "A long-stalled stretch of Chicago riverfront is back to development.\nChicago\u2019s City Council approved zoning for Foundry Park on Wednesday, a $3 billion, 6 million-square-foot mixed-use development pitched for 34 acres along the Chicago River between Lincoln Park and Bucktown. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat the sign-off clears a major hurdle for the joint venture of Chicago-based JDL Development and Boca Raton-based Kayne Anderson Real Estate, which aim to break ground on the first phase this fall.\nThe approval marks a dramatic reset for the northern portion of the failed Lincoln Yards megaproject, originally approved in 2019 under Chicago-based developer Sterling Bay. That 14 million-square-foot vision ultimately collapsed under the weight of infrastructure costs and frozen capital markets, with lender Bank OZK seizing most of the site last year.\nFoundry Park is\nnotably slimmer\n. Plans call for roughly 3,207 residential units \u2014 including 305 for-sale homes and 2,902 rentals \u2014 alongside up to 350,000 square feet of office space, 420,000 square feet of retail and 250,000 square feet of hospitality uses. About 641 rental units would be set aside as affordable housing.\nThe first phase alone is projected to cost $800 million and span 1.6 million square feet, anchored by a 39-story apartment and condo tower on a triangular parcel bounded by North Southport Avenue, West Cortland and North Kingsbury streets. JDL CEO\nJim Letchinger\ndubbed it the \u201cmonument\u201d of the development.\nBut while aldermen signed off on zoning, the harder part may lie ahead.\nThe City Council has yet to approve plans for new roads, utilities and other infrastructure needed to support the historically industrial site, long plagued by congestion, according to the publication.\nUnder the 2019 Lincoln Yards redevelopment agreement, Sterling Bay was to front major infrastructure costs and be reimbursed with up to $1.3 billion in\ntax-increment financing\nonce projects were completed, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.\nAn initial\n$490 million\nworth of public infrastructure consisting of 13 City Council-approved projects were outlined for TIF reimbursement at the time,\naccording\nto city documents. Those projects included bridge extensions and viaduct work, a pedestrian and bike trail extension and various street and Chicago River sea wall improvements.\nUntangling that agreement to fit Foundry Park\u2019s smaller space remains an open question.\nAld. Brian Hopkins, whose former ward included the site, voted against the rezoning, arguing that promised improvements \u2014 including a redesign of the Elston-Ashland-Armitage intersection and two new river bridges \u2014 remain unresolved.\n\u201cAll those things that were promised to the neighborhood \u2026 and as of now, we\u2019re walking away from it,\u201d he said at the meeting.\nAld. Scott Waguespack, whose 32nd Ward now includes the site, acknowledged \u201csignificant transportation challenges,\u201d but framed the vote as a signal that Chicago can still execute large-scale projects after years of stalled deals.\nPlans include new stretches of Dominick Street and Southport Avenue, 3,000 linear feet of riverwalk and roughly 10 acres of open space. A proposed bridge connection to the 606 trail would follow a future extension of the trail.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

In 2024, Partners Group defaulted on a $400 million loan backed by Concord Tech Center and three other California properties, including another East Bay business center, the Rosewood Commons in Pleasanton.\nThe Concord Tech Center transaction is the latest distressed office sale in the East Bay.\nLast month, a Deutsche Bank AG affiliate seized three office towers in downtown Oakland through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.\nStarwood Capital Group\nowned 2101 Webster Street, 1901 Harrison Street and 2100 Franklin Street prior to\na lender takeover\n. The unpaid debt for the three office buildings totals $442.1 million, the Mercury News\nreported\n. The original loan Deutsche Bank provided to Starwood totaled $364.5 million. Starwood purchased the office buildings in 2019 for a total of $494 million.\nAlso last month, three Oakland office properties were taken over by a receiver after another loan default. Lender Rialto Capital Management\nfiled a lawsuit\nin Alameda County Superior Court to foreclose on a portfolio that includes\nOakland\u2019s Tribune Tower\n, the Financial Center building at 405 14th Street and offices at 1500 Broadway, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The legal action came after Highbridge Equity Partners defaulted on a $111 million Rialto loan last year.

        "content": "Some rules are meant to be broken.\nConsider this message I received from an owner of rent-stabilized buildings:\n\u201cThere are countless units that have been in the same tenant\u2019s name or family for decades while their needs and family makeup have changed. For example, they have a 3 or 4 bedroom apartment for a family of 1 and perhaps 2. They will then rent the spare bedrooms for $175 to $250 per week, per room.\u201d\nThis is not the way rent stabilization is supposed to work. But is it a victimless crime? The landlord didn\u2019t think so.\n\u201cWhen the tenant has a rent-stabilized apartment for less than $1,000 [and is renting out rooms], everyone gets hurt and the leaseholder is enriched on the backs of the landlord and other people in the public who need housing for their families.\u201d\nI would say it\u2019s bad for families and good for individuals who just want to rent a room but cannot find one of the few remaining single-room occupancy buildings (a shortage that this\nCity Council bill\naims to\nchange\n).\nThe illegal renting of rooms is a consequence of a rent-stabilization system that incentivizes people to stay in large apartments long after their kids have grown up and moved out. The system practically forces them to stay because it makes vacancies scarce.\nEven if smaller, rent-stabilized units were readily available, they typically have higher rents because they turned over more often when vacancy allowed for rent increases (before the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019).\nGiven the city\u2019s housing shortage, it\u2019s better for spare bedrooms to be rented than to remain empty. But landlords should get a cut of the revenue, if for no other reason than that more tenants mean higher water bills and other operating costs.\nBringing this out into the open would also allow owners to screen room-renters, reducing the risk of nuisance tenants and squatters. Being on the lease would give subletters more rights as well.\nSome politicians might oppose this idea because they love the principle of the primary residency requirement. Reality check: It doesn\u2019t exist \u2014 because there is virtually no enforcement.\nBefore the HSTPA, enforcement was largely left to landlords; the 20 percent vacancy bonus and the chance to do a substantial individual apartment improvement gave them an incentive to evict rule-breakers.\nBut now that the law has eliminated the vacancy bonus and the opportunity to do a real IAI, owners have little incentive to police fraud as long as the tenant is paying the rent. There was no enforcement mechanism to fall back on, nor did the state bother to create one after the law changed.\nThe reader had more to say.\n\u201cThere are countless people who are not paying their rent, working off the books, getting one-shot deals (over and over again), meanwhile have the funds to go on months-long vacations to the Caribbean while wearing $250+ shoes and designer sunglasses,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThese practices are running rampant.\u201d\nNo one really knows how common they are. When I was a reporter in Sheepshead Bay in the 1990s, locals would complain to me about Russian women in fur coats and designer boots using food stamps at the supermarket. That was probably a small percentage of SNAP users, but it bothered people.\nAs I have\nwritten before\n, the perfect amount of fraud is not zero, because the enforcement regime needed to achieve zero fraud would handcuff a program for people who truly need it. But tolerating rampant fraud undercuts public support for a program. There has to be a balance.\n",

        "content": "Nicholas Mastroianni II cashed out of a portion of the waterfront Harbourside Place mixed-use complex in Jupiter for $57.6 million.\nVoloridge, a data science, investment management and health care tech firm that\u2019s headquartered at Harbourside Place, bought the properties at 110 and 115 Front Street, and 100 and 102 North Coastal Way, from an affiliate of Tequesta-based Summit Ventures, led by Mastroianni, according to records. Under an agreement between the seller and the buyer, Voloridge has the right of first offer to purchase a marina that may be built at 100 and 102 North Coastal Way.\nLed by Barry Miller, Voloridge plans to develop a new building on part of its holdings, hinting at company expansion plans, including 100 to 200 new tech and other jobs, according to the firm\u2019s news release on the purchase.\nVoloridge consists of a quantitative investment management division, and a data-driven health and wellness tech division, according to the release.\nThe 1-acre 110 Front Street lot consists of a 51,600-square-foot building with offices, retail, restaurants and a garage. The 0.7-acre 115 Front Street property has a 42,300-square-foot office and retail building, property records show. The 100 North Coastal Way property is a 0.7-acre vacant lot, and the 0.5-acre lot at 102 North Coastal Way lot has a small commercial building.\nHarbourside Place, which fronts the Intracoastal Waterway, was completed in 2014. Aside from offices, retail and restaurants, it also has a hotel. Part of the project was financed with about\n$99.5 million\nfrom 199 EB-5 investors, which led to now-settled litigation filed by some of the investors.\nIn a 2020 lawsuit, the investors claimed Mastroianni and others involved in the Harbourside Place development raised the EB-5 money for a construction loan that would be repaid but \u201chad no intention of keeping their promise to repay.\u201d They also claimed he purposefully was one investor short of the $100 million raise. Mastroianni and Harbourside Place denied the allegations, countersued the investors and the lawsuits later settled.\nMastroianni also leads U.S. Immigration Fund, an EB-5 regional center in Jupiter.\nThe\nEB-5 program\ngives foreign investors a path to green cards for them and their children in exchange for at least $800,000 in investment, which is higher than the previous EB-5 threshold of $500,000.\nVoloridge\u2019s planned expansion comes as Palm Beach County is becoming an epicenter for company relocations and growth, though much of it has focused on West Palm Beach due to billionaire Steve Ross\u2019 hefty investment and development activity in the city.\nRoss, through his West Palm-based Related Ross, has tapped his New York network to help lease up his new office towers. While most activity has been by financial service firms, Ross has pressed on lately with a vision for turning Palm Beach County into a tech hub.\nIn September, Fortune 500 cloud computing firm ServiceNow pre-leased\n211,900 square feet\nat Related Ross\u2019 10 CityPlace that\u2019s under construction in downtown West Palm.\n",

The unpaid debt and costs amounted to about $38 million, or more than $200,000 a room.\nKing did not respond to requests for comment; LCP declined to comment.\nThe Real Deal\npreviously\nreported\na UCC foreclosure auction was scheduled late last year, and the lender was seeking to foreclose on the equity interests in the slim, 10-story, 178-key hotel, a block south of Hollywood Boulevard and a block north of Sunset Boulevard.

The crowd included organizers engaged in gathering the 900,000 or so signatures of registered voters that will be needed to place the tax on the ballot on the November ballot.\nThe tax would apply to individuals with a net worth of $1 billion are deemed by the state to be residents of California as of Jan. 1,\n2026.\nIt would be due in 2027.\nSome of California\u2019s most famous and wealthy tech executives are pushing back, including Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who is reportedly leading an effort by a\u00a0 group called Building a Better California to head off the billionaire tax. Brin recently shelled out $42 million for a mansion on the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe\u2013which also has shoreline in California\u2013 and has offered about $50 million for a Miami Beach home,\nThe Real Deal reported\nin January.\nSanders waived off\u00a0 fears of an\nexodus of wealthy from California\nif the tax passes, calling reports of such concerns as a \u201cdisgusting\u201d advertising ploy by those looking to dodge paying their \u201cfair share.\u201d\nThe senator likened attempts by the wealthy to push back against the proposed tax as following the same playbook used by companies threatening to move overseas if their employees unionize.\n\u201cNow, whether they do it or not, I don\u2019t know. I think they lie a lot,\u201d he said.\nHe also drew a comparison to criticisms that have accompanied the rise of\u00a0 New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani, also a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, or DSA.\n\u201cAnd, by the way, when [Mayor Zohran] Mamdani was running in New York City, that\u2019s what the oligarch says, \u2018Oh, [if] Mamdani wins, we\u2019re all fleeing New York,\u201d Sanders told the crowd at the Wiltern. \u201cThey didn\u2019t and I doubt that they will flee the great state of California.\u201d\nSanders spent some time criticizing recent actions by the federal government\u2019s\u00a0 Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Minneapolis, but he didn\u2019t stray elsewhere during his roughly half hour on stage, avoiding any indication of where, if at all, he might throw his weight in the city\u2019s mayoral race.\nWhile Sanders endorsed 4th District City Councilmember member\nNithya Raman\nin an upset victory of an incumbent to win her seat\u00a0 2020, who is backed by the DSA.\u00a0 Sanders has yet to bestow his political blessing in L.A.\u2019s mayoral campaign, where Raman is bidding to unseat incumbent Mayor Karen Bass, with the June primary a first test..\nMore to come on what real estate thinks of California\u2019s proposed 2026 Billionaire Tax Act.\n",

        "content": "TruAmerica Multifamily is adding to its holdings on the Westside with two multifamily property acquisitions.\nCentury City-based TruAmerica purchased the\nLuxe Villas\nand Haven Apartments, comprising 157 units, for an undisclosed price, Multi-Housing News\nreported\n. WS Communities and Gortikov Capital sold the 60-unit Luxe Villas at 11640 Mayfield Avenue in\nBrentwood\n, while Cityview offloaded the 97-unit Haven Apartments at 11924 Washington Boulevard in\nCulver City\n.\nAt Luxe Villas,\nWS Communities\nand Gortikov Capital invested $4.1 million in renovations. The property consists largely of two-bedroom units as well as 18 co-living suites. Amenities there include a rooftop lounge, a central courtyard with seating and electric vehicle charging stations.\nCityview\ndeveloped Haven Apartments with the help of a $45 million construction loan from PNC Bank. The property, opened in 2019, includes 13,183 square feet of ground-floor retail space below studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments averaging 1,044 square feet.\nTruAmerica intends to maintain the existing buildings, Wes LaBar, the company\u2019s head of acquisitions, told Multi-Housing News. The company is one of the largest multifamily owners in the U.S., holding roughly 65,000 apartments across more than 35 markets in 16 states. TruAmerica is no stranger to Los Angeles, having owned and managed more than 6,700 units across 47 properties in L.A. The firm primarily focuses on value-add investments, according to Multi-Housing News.\nMultifamily investment in Los Angeles has\nbeen on a post-pandemic upswing\neven as Measure ULA and rising vacancy rates exert pressure on firms looking to buy. The amount of multifamily units sold in L.A. County increased in both 2024 and 2025 since hitting a post-pandemic low in 2023, according to a fourth-quarter\nreport\nfrom Kidder Mathews. Almost 30,000 units across L.A. County traded hands in 2025, up from fewer than 20,000 units in 2020.\nInvestors in Greater Los Angeles spent more than $3.4 billion on multifamily properties last year, per Yardi Matrix data cited by Multi-Housing News. It\u2019s a 26 percent increase compared to the $2.7 billion recorded in 2024, which itself was a 31 percent increase over 2023.\n\u201cAfter a period of new supply-driven softness, L.A. multifamily fundamentals have begun to stabilize,\u201d LaBar told Multi-Housing News, saying the firm \u201canticipate[s] this trend to continue\u201d in 2026 \u201cwith capital concentrating in \u2018A\u2019 locations within the strongest Los Angeles submarkets.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Location is key to securing\nfresh financing for Texas apartments\nin today\u2019s oversupplied market and tight lending environment.\nLuckily, the GenCap Group can count on the positioning of\nPark at Westover Hills\n, an apartment complex in a major San Antonio growth zone.\nWalker &amp; Dunlop Investment Partners\nprovided a $46.5 million floating-rate, interest-only bridge loan for the property, according to a release from Walker &amp; Dunlop. The firm\u2019s Stuart Wernick, Drew Garrison, Geoff Smith and Mike Dunsheath put together the refinancing.\nDallas-based GenCap built the 372-unit property on 16 acres at 4103 Rogers Road last year. The loan works out to $125,000 per unit. Park at Westover Hills features one-, two- and three-bedroom units with private yards. In terms of amenities, the property includes a golf simulator, coffee bar, pool and dog parks.\nWhen GenCap took on the project, the developer noted that the development site\u2019s terrain would create a challenge.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one big rock hill,\u201d GenCap\u2019s Mark Johnson said at the time. \u201cThere\u2019s about six inches of dirt and the rest of it is rock. There\u2019s a lot of dirt work required to get this project going.\u201d\nBut the firm persisted, largely due to the property\u2019s prime location in a major growth corridor.\nThe property is in San Antonio\u2019s Far West submarket, about 17 miles northwest of Downtown San Antonio. It\u2019s near SeaWorld and Alamo Ranch, the city\u2019s largest master-planning community and a hotspot for growth. Work on that community started around 2005 after the Cordi Marian Sisters sold about 160 acres to developers Walt Busby and Brad Galo.\nAlamo Ranch\u2019s population\njumped more than 50 percent between 2018 and 2025 from 53,000 residents to 82,000, according to data from Texas Demographics.\nThe area\u2019s rapid growth also shields projects like this from the region\u2019s\nsluggish multifamily market\n, which is plagued by oversupply.\nLike other Texas metros, San Antonio\u2019s new multifamily supply has put downward pressure on rents. Monthly rents were down 2.5 percent, year-over-year, in the third quarter of 2025, to $1,240, according to a report from Cushman &amp; Wakefield.\n",

        "content": "PMG is launching a Delano-branded supertall in downtown Miami, next door to its under-construction Waldorf Astoria Hotel &amp; Residences supertall.\nThe planned Delano Residences Miami marks the first branded condo project for the hotel, according to a news release. Slated for the 1.2-acre site at 400 Biscayne Boulevard, the project is set to rise 850 feet, or 90 stories with 421 units.\nPMG\u2019s Ryan Shear said the development will likely take about five years to complete. Supertalls, due to their height, are more complex construction projects and take longer to build than other kinds of developments. Shear acknowledged the longer timeline can leave developers open to more risk.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why development is true gambling,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not pouring concrete today.\u201d\nDespite others\u2019 concerns about possible oversaturation in the market, Shear said PMG sees this as a prime moment to launch its second supertall.\n\u201cThe metrics all make sense to us,\u201d he said.\nPMG Residential will lead the sales and marketing effort kicking off in March, with prices starting at $800,000, the release shows.\nThe supertall\u2019s design team includes Carlos Ott, Cube 3 and interiors firm Meyer Davis. Units will span from studios to three bedrooms, and amenities in the tower will include a fitness center, a pool and spa facilities through the hotel\u2019s The Source by Delano wellness program, the release states. The project will also have a Delano Members\u2019 Club and Delano Rose Bar.\nPMG bought the Biscayne Boulevard site for\n$53.6 million\nin 2017, three years after buying the adjacent Waldorf Astoria site for\n$80 million\n.\nThe original Delano at 1685 Collins Avenue is one of Miami Beach\u2019s iconic Art Deco hotels. First opened in 1947, it became a hub of nightlife and celebrity after a mid-1990s renovation by architect Philippe Starck. The hotel, owned by a partnership of Accor\u2019s Ennismore and Cain International\u2019s Eldridge Industries, closed during the pandemic in 2020, and is slated to reopen this year, according to published reports.\nEnnismore is looking to expand the Delano brand to New York and London,\nHotel Dive\nreported this fall.\nHospitality branding has played a key role in Miami\u2019s current condo boom and PMG\u2019s own portfolio in the region. It landed\na $668 million construction loan\nfor the Waldorf Astoria supertall in 2024, which is set to be complete in 2028.",

        "content": "Disgraced attorney and fixer Mark Nussbaum is turning against his former friend and deal partner as creditors seek to collect more than $400 million in missing escrow funds.\nSheldon Eisenberger, an attorney handling the wind-down and liquidation of Nussbaum\u2019s former law firms, has launched a lawsuit against nursing home entrepreneur and Nussbaum\u2019s former friend Tzali Chopp of Opal Healthcare.\nThe lawsuit filed in the Southern District of New York alleges Chopp failed to pay back a $3 million loan from Nussbaum. Eisenberger now alleges Chopp owes $6.3 million with interest.\nWhatsapp messages between Nussbaum and Chopp included in the lawsuit offer a rare window into\nNussbaum\u2019s business.\nNussbaum has admitted to running a Ponzi scheme with his associate\nMendel Steiner\n. Part of the scheme involved using Nussbaum\u2019s escrow funds to lend money to real estate dealmakers as short-term loans.\nThe messages illustrate Nussbaum\u2019s nonchalance when it came to extending loans or making investments. Some messages show that Nussbaum lent money first and asked questions later.\n[6/8/22, 12:21:44\u202fPM] Tzally Chopp: I needed originally 3.5 u gave me like 2.3 need another million and I\u2019m good\n[6/8/22, 12:22:44\u202fPM] \u00a0 Mark Nussbaaum: not sure i can do another MM, and i need to understand how money coming back, etc., can we speak at 2?\nOthers show that Chopp appears to request proof of funds for his company, Opal Healthcare, in an unrelated deal. (Nussbaum used a tactic called show capital where he would provide short term loans to make borrowers look capitalized).\n[8/11/22, 1:42:55\u202fPM] Tzally Chopp: Please send me letter saying opal Hcs has 15M\nfor operating ty if this works I make crazy money\n[8/11/22, 1:46:04\u202fPM] Nussbaum: and you will remember that i helped you so i can make some crazy money also, yes?\nNussbaum diverted about\n$336 million\nof his clients\u2019 escrow money through to late Brooklyn-based investor Mendel Steiner who allegedly moved money through his shell companies and his family, lawsuits allege.\nBut tens of millions went to\nother real estate dealmakers\n, including Boruch Drillman, Shaya Prager and Mark Meisner, usually as loans or preferred equity. Eisenberger is tasked with collecting on those outstanding debts in order to help pay the creditors back.\nCollecting from these debtors will be a challenge given Nussbaum\u2019s penchant for handshake deals and lack of formal record keeping.\nFor instance, Chopp\u2019s attorneys allege the $3 million in alleged loans which Eisenberger seeks to collect on are usurious and unenforceable. Chopp\u2019s attorneys, who declined to comment, allege the interest on the loans amounted to 35.7 percent of the alleged principal loan account, which is beyond the legal limit of 25 percent.\nEisenberger, who is known as the assignee in the process, \u201cis unable to challenge this basic math, so instead offers inadmissible testimony from the disgraced and now indicted attorney Mark Nussbaum,\u201d Chopp\u2019s attorneys claim in a legal filing.\nIn response Eisenberger\u2019s team denies the loans were usurious. Eisenberger alleges Chopp made a $120,000 payment on the loans, which specifically went to paying accrued interest.\nTo further support their argument, Eisenberger\u2019s legal team included a statement from Nussbaum.\nNussbaum said he met Chopp at his house in Suffern, New York in 2022 and reached an agreement to provide up to $3 million revolving line of credit to Chopp through four transactions at a 2 percent monthly rate.\nNussbaum claims he made the loans to Chopp through various accounts. This included $1 million from a Nussbaum Lowinger bank account to Opal Healthcare WI, a nursing home venture in Wisconsin controlled by Chopp. (Opal Holdings\u2019 Shaya Prager, known for his controversial ground lease structure, has ties to the venture as well, based on lawsuits and public records).\nThe WhatsApp messages between Nussbaum and Chopp clearly show the two setting up meetings at Nussbaum\u2019s house and other locations.\n[8/18/24, 12:18:17\u202fPM] Nussbaum: When can we speak. Happy to meet also. Need to get comfortable with September.\n[8/19/24, 11:08:15\u202fAM] Nussbaum: lmk pls\n[8/19/24, 11:08:53\u202fAM] Tzally Chopp: Meet Friday in Monsey on the way up to Catskills\n[8/19/24, 11:09:02\u202fAM] Nussbaum: DEAL! \ud83d\ude42\n[8/19/24, 11:09:08\u202fAM] Tzally Chopp: Ty\n[8/19/24, 11:09:16\u202fAM] Nussbaum: lmk when, appreciate, miss u anyway, been too long\nAND pls bring tefilin! \ud83d\ude42\n[8/23/24, 8:27:10\u202fAM] Nussbaum: Lmk when we meeting.

And now they asking me how the\nmeeting went\nNussbaum continued to reach out to Chopp about a \u201cdebt\u201d throughout 2024, carrying on their chummy rapport.\n[9/17/24, 3:56:33\u202fPM] Nussbaum: How we looking?\n[9/18/24, 6:32:19\u202fPM] Nussbaum: Lmk\n[9/19/24, 3:00:54\u202fPM] Nussbaum: talk to me bro\n[9/19/24, 3:03:20\u202fPM] Tzally Chopp: Looking good call u tomorrow\n[9/19/24, 3:03:33\u202fPM] Nussbaum: ty bHHHHH\n[9/23/24, 8:49:07\u202fAM] Nussbaum: When can we speak?\nJust a few months later, Nussbaum and Steiner\u2019s alleged Ponzi scheme started to unravel as Nussbaum faced a gaping deficit owed to his escrow clients. Nussbaum shut down his law firm Nussbaum Lowinger in January 2025 days after Steiner died by suicide in a Manhattan hotel room. In May, the Manhattan District Attorney indicted Nussbaum alleging he stole over $15 million from clients\u2019 escrow accounts. Nussbaum has pleaded not guilty. His next court date is scheduled for March 3.\nClick above to view the full lawsuit\n",

        "content": "Half a decade after retreating from Chicago\u2019s most famous shopping strip, Gap is plotting a return to the Magnificent Mile.\nThe San Francisco-based apparel chain is in advanced talks to lease 8,325 square feet at 700 North Michigan Avenue,\naccording\nto CoStar News. The deal isn\u2019t finalized and could still fall apart, but if completed it would mark a symbolic comeback for a retailer that once anchored the corridor with a three-level flagship at 555 North Michigan.\nGap\u2019s prospective new home is a former T-Mobile space at the base of a 49-story residential tower at 100 East Huron Street. The building\u2019s other retail tenants include Saks Fifth Avenue and Zara. New York-based\nAshkenazy Acquisitions\nand Aurora Capital Associates own the property.\nIn September, the joint venture had to pay $65 million to lender Aareal Capital Corporation in order to keep the retail spot known as the Chicago Place Mall, according to property records. As previously\nreported\nin\nThe Real Deal\n, Aareal in turn extended a new $33 million senior mortgage loan against the 300,000-square-foot property.\nThe move would add to a string of recent leases along the one-mile stretch of North Michigan Avenue, which has been clawing back from pandemic-era vacancies and unrest. Availability is projected to fall to 23.5 percent by the end of 2026, down from a peak of 33.9 percent early last year, according to a Kirsch Agency report cited by CoStar.\nGap would be the latest boomerang tenant. Spanish retailer Mango and Japanese fashion brand Uniqlo have also committed to large new spaces after previously exiting the avenue. Aritzia\nbackfilled\nGap\u2019s former flagship, while a Harry Potter-themed store, Alo Yoga, Intimissimi and Falconeri have all inked deals in recent leasing cycles.\nThe contrast with early 2021 is stark. Gap shuttered its store at 555 North Michigan in January of that year, part of the San Francisco-based parent company\u2019s nationwide plan to close 350 Gap and Banana Republic stores. The exit came as Michigan Avenue tourism stalled during the pandemic, and retailers grappled with waves of property damage and theft following the murder of George Floyd. Macy\u2019s also closed its\nWater Tower Place\nanchor around the same time.\nPlenty of hurdles remain for a full comeback in the shopping corridor, including stubborn vacancies at Water Tower Place and the Shops at North Bridge.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",
