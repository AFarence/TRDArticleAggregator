        "content": "The already chaotic New York City mayor\u2019s race may soon get even messier.\nMayor Eric Adams has reportedly been offered a senior role at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development by President Donald Trump\u2019s\nteam\n, per\nPolitico\n. According\nNew York Times\n, which first reported the news, the move is widely seen as an attempt to persuade Adams to drop his reelection bid \u2014 and to blunt the momentum of Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, who shocked the establishment by winning June\u2019s Democratic primary.\nAdams, who maintains a cordial political relationship with Trump, did not deny meeting with administration officials during a recent Florida trip. While his campaign later insisted he has \u201cnot met with Donald Trump\u201d and remains \u201cfully committed\u201d to running, the\nmayo\nr stopped short of ruling out a potential role in Washington when pressed by reporters.\nThe behind-the-scenes maneuvering highlights the extent to which Trump allies, centrist Democrats and business leaders are willing to go to block Mamdani. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent, has emerged as their preferred candidate, though polls show him trailing badly. Advisers believe Cuomo could beat Mamdani in a one-on-one matchup if Adams and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa exit the race.\nOn Tuesday, lawyer Jim Walden, a fifth candidate in the race, suspended his campaign and urged his rivals to endorse a single Mamdani alternative. Even if Adams and Sliwa also suspend their campaigns, their names would likely remain on the ballot due to New York election law.\n\nGetting there may be tricky. Sliwa has already dismissed the idea of joining the Trump administration, saying he has no interest in a federal job. And any perception that Cuomo is Trump\u2019s handpicked candidate could prove toxic in heavily Democratic New York.\nMamdani, meanwhile, wasted no time seizing on the reports, declaring on X that \u201cCuomo is Trump\u2019s choice for Mayor \u2026 New Yorkers are sick of corrupt politics and backroom deals.\u201d\nAdams\n\u2019 position has been further complicated by his legal troubles. Federal prosecutors dropped corruption charges against him earlier this year, fueling speculation that his relationship with Trump could shape his political future, but the legal heat is still on former members of his administration, as top aides Ingrid Lewis-Martin and Jesse Hamilton were charged for accepting\nbribes\n. Adams insists he\u2019s staying in the race for now, quipping that he has \u201cmore ribbons to cut\u201d before his term ends.\nBut with Trump eager to reshape the nation\u2019s biggest city and Cuomo desperate for an opening, the possibility of a federally brokered shake-up lingers over the fall campaign.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "August was a slow month for new development, save for one huge deal in the West Village.\nThe city recorded 201 contracts, down almost 22 percent from the prior year and 9 percent from July, according to a Marketproof\nreport\n.\nThat didn\u2019t slow down deal volume, which rose 13 percent from last month to $597 million, but\naided by the contract for a penthouse at\n140 Jane Street, which asked $87.5 million\n. The top three deals last month alone accounted for over 20 percent of the total volume in August.\nThe main culprit driving what appears to be the otherwise lackluster month is a major project that has yet to report a single contract.\nThe 112-unit development from Atlas Capital and Zeckendorf at 80 Clarkson Street has\nyet to report a contract\n, despite\nsources telling The Real Deal\nthat sales have been going well at the building.\n\u201c\nI have an asterisk next to all our numbers because the number one building in the city is not reporting,\u201d said Marketproof CEO Kael Goodman. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to get a little annoying.\u201d\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a big piece of the story,\u201d said Brown Harris Stevens Development Marketing\u2019s Jason Thomas on\n80 Clarkson\u2019s impact\non available market data. \u201cAll of a sudden, August doesn\u2019t look that slow.\u201d\nBut there are a number of other factors likely\nweighing down new development\u2019s performance\n, Thomas added, including a lack of new inventory, buyers\nexpecting mortgage rates to fall\non the heels of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates in September, and the\nuncertainty swirling in the upcoming mayoral race\n.\nIn August, only 27 new sponsor units launched, all across five projects in Brooklyn.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of new things coming out, especially Manhattan, and people may be waiting,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThey\u2019ve seen what\u2019s out there and they\u2019re not buyers for it.\u201d\nThe luxury sector was one of the few slices of the market that ticked up in August, notching 31 contracts compared to 23 last year.\n\nThe headline deal was for the penthouse at\nAurora Capital Associates and William Gottlieb Real Estate\u2019s 140 Jane Street\n, where all but one of its 15 units have gone under contract since a Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group team led by Tara King-Brown launched sales last summer.\nIn Manhattan, there were 86 contracts signed last month, down from 123 last year. The median sale price was $2.9 million and the median price per square foot was nearly $2,240.\nThe borough\u2019s top-selling building last month was The Greenwich at\n125 Greenwich Street\nin the Financial District, which began closing on its first residences at the end of June. In August, the building reported eight contracts signed from $1.3 million to $3.3 million.\nA Douglas Elliman Development Marketing led by Stacey Spielman is\nheading sales at the 272-unit tower\n. The building has reported 37 residences sold, with another 18 under contract, according to Marketproof.\nAll quiet in the outer boroughs\nIt was a similar story in Brooklyn, where the borough saw 88 contracts, down from 109 last August. The median sale price was $1.4 million and the median price per square foot was nearly $1,450.\nThe top-selling project last month was Kingsdel Real Estate\u2019s Calvert House in Prospect Lefferts Garden. The 49-unit development launched sales in June with a Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group team and the Henderson Mulready Team.\nLast month, the development reported six contracts between $460,000 and $960,000. The project also includes a second 10-unit boutique building called the Calvert Villas.\nQueens showed a small uptick, with 27 contracts signed in August compared to 25 last year. The median sale price was $1.1 million and the median PPSF was $1,510.\nCentury Development Group\u2019s Vesta development has\nled the borough in signed contracts\nevery month since launching sales in April. In August, the 115-unit project reported 11 contracts between $765,000 and $1.6 million.\nSerhant\u2019s Kayla Lee and Serhant New Development Marketing are leading sales.\n",

        "content": "There were 187 transactions, totaling $257 million, recorded in New York City on Sept. 3.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Residential:\nA Lenox Hill condominium ranked as the priciest residential transaction to hit record books in New York City. Jewelry designer\nToni Goutal\npicked up a three-bedroom, nearly 3,000-square-foot sponsor unit at The Surrey Residences at\n20 East 76th Street\nfor $15 million, or roughly $5,000 per square foot \u2014 the pad\u2019s asking price. Douglas Elliman\u2019s\nLauren Muss\nand\nMichelle Griffith\nhad the listing. British billionaires\nSimon and David Reuben\npurchased the property\n, a 100-key hotel, from the Kaufman Organization in 2020.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe city\u2019s top recorded commercial deal was for a six-story, mixed-use apartment building at\n271 East Houston Street\non the Lower East Side, sold by an affiliate of\nDennis Wong\u2019s Verbena Road Holdings.\nThe buyer was an LLC managed by\nLeor Sabetfard\u2019s The Sabet Group\n, which paid $7.3 million for the property. The complex, which has 17 apartments, last sold for roughly twice that amount in 2014 \u2014 $12.9 million.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Elliot Cooperstone\n, founder of private equity firm InTandem Capital Partners, and\nBarbara Cooperstone\npaid $11.6 million for a 5,500-square-foot pad at\n785 Fifth Avenue\nin Lenox Hill. The sellers were legal scholars\nNicholas Quinn Rosenkranz\n, who is also the son of billionaire investor Robert Rosenkranz, and\nMichelle Boardman\n. The five-bedroom co-op has been on and off the market since at least 2020, when it was listed for $19.9 million, according to\nStreetEasy\n. Corcoran\u2019s\nDeborah Grubman, Judi Feldman\nand\nDavid Adler\nhad the most recent listing.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nIn Boerum Hill, a brownstone at\n233 Bergen Street\nchanged hands for $5.85 million. The seller was an affiliate of Jersey City-based investor\nDixon Advisory\nand the buyer was\nFlorescimento NY LLC.\nThe four-story townhouse has five bedrooms, five and a half bathrooms, an elevator, four terraces and a backyard. Brown Harris Stevens\u2019\nAri Harkov, Kerrie Lynch\nand\nWarner Lewis\nhad the listing, which went live in June for just under $6 million.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nA trust linked to\nScott I. Murray\npurchased a two-bedroom condo at the renovated\nWaldorf Astoria\nResidences at\n301 Park Avenue\nin Midtown for about $5.4 million, about 3.2 percent off its original asking price of $5.6 million. The unit measures about 1,700 square feet, pricing the deal at more than $3,100 per square foot. Douglass Elliman\u2019s\nLoretta Shanahan, Kai Wong, Jade Chan, Noble Black\nand\nSabrina Saltiel\nhad the listing.\nDajia US\ntook over the conversion of the iconic property.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nAffiliates of\nParag Sawhney\u2019s Penn South Capital\noffloaded a four-family, three-story-tall apartment complex at\n138 Noble Street\nin Greenpoint for $5.6 million, about two years after buying the property for $3.2 million. The buyer in the latest transaction was\nTownhouse Rental II, LLC\n.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nIn Gravesend, the Sabatino Funeral Home traded for $4.1 million. The seller of the two-story property at\n323 Avenue U\nin Brooklyn was\nLinda Sabatino\n, and the buyer was an LLC linked to\nAlan Karul\n. The property has been in the Sabatino family for decades.\nBy the Numbers:\nREITs, off a summer high, are tested once again\nREITs aren\u2019t having the best start to September, after making quite a comeback last month.\nPublic real estate investment trusts were down more than 1.6 percent yesterday, the first trading day of the month, according to the FTSE Nareit All REITs index, which tracks nearly 200 U.S. public REITs of all stripes.\nThat\u2019s a turn from the end of August, when the index\u2019s total returns were up 3.3 percent for the month \u2014 the second-best performing month so far in 2025 and an improvement from the 1.1 percent drop recorded\nin July\n.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "Nevertheless, the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act persists.\nThe City Council has four months left with its current body, and progressive members are zeroing in on boosting nonprofit landlords as well as clawing back Local Law 97 relief.\nThe\nCOPA bill\n, which would give nonprofits and community land trusts the first crack at buying residential buildings with three or more units, was\nintroduced\nin 2020. It has had at least three hearings, including one\nthis year\nas part of a broader package of \u201csocial housing\u201d bills. The measure hasn\u2019t made it to a vote and just lost its prime sponsor, Council member Carlina Rivera, who left the Council to head the New York State Association for Affordable Housing.\nIn her new role, Rivera will be representing the interests of affordable housing developers (the organization\u2019s board and executive committee is largely made up of for-profit affordable housing developers and lenders). In fact, NYSAFAH publicly opposed COPA, objecting to the implication that \u201cnonprofit entities are, simply by nature of 501(c)3 status, inherently better stewards of affordable housing or better operators of residential buildings.\u201d\nBut the bill has a new champion. Council member Sandy Nurse has taken it up as part of one of five bills that make up the \u201cLivable Future Package.\u201d Alongside youth organizers, Council members Nurse, Shahana Hanif, Crystal Hudson, Carmen De La Rosa, Chi Oss\u00e9 and Keith Powers, as well as city Comptroller Brad Lander and Sen. Kristen Gonzalez, announced the package as a priority for the final months of the City Council\u2019s session.\nAnother real estate-related measure would cap the renewable energy credits property owners can use to offset their annual building emissions under Local Law 97. The measure, sponsored by Council member Carmen De La Rosa, would limit the offset to 10 percent of the emission volume above a building\u2019s cap. The idea of a cap was a\npoint of contention\nwhen the Department of Buildings approved rules for using such credits. Against the wishes of environmental groups, the agency opted not to cap credits but specified that they could only be used to deduct emissions generated by electricity, meaning that emissions from fossil fuels burned for heat and hot water in residential buildings are not eligible.\nThe other bills take aim at city agencies\u2019 collaboration with Federal Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement agencies and seek to ramp up protections for incarcerated transgender, gender non-conforming, non-binary and/or intersex people.\nEven if this bill package does not pass before the end of the year, the Council members are signaling their priorities for the future mayor and City Council speaker. The chances of these bills progressing are likely better if Zohran Mamdani becomes mayor and, say, one of the bills\u2019 sponsors \u2014\u00a0Hudson and De La Rosa are\nreportedly\ncampaigning for the job \u2014 becomes the next speaker.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: The plot thickens! The Trump administration\nreportedly\nfloated the possibility of hiring Mayor Eric Adams to help make the mayoral race a bit more competitive and decrease the chances of a Zohran Mamdani victory. Will Adams quit? Will Republican Curtis Sliwa stay in the race? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nQueens Council member Julie Won is not yet sold on the Long Island City rezoning. The City Planning Commission on Wednesday signed off on the plan, which is expected to pave the way for 14,700 new homes. In a statement, Won said she welcomed the vote but added that \u201cOneLIC cannot advance without meeting community-driven priorities.\u201d\nShe noted that the rezoning must include \u201cpermanently affordable, family-sized housing across public and private sites,\u201d public space beneath the Queensboro bridge, new schools, investments in sewer infrastructure and a \u201ccommunity-driven process\u201d for planning development of a Department of Education site.\n\n\u201cWithout these commitments, this rezoning will not have my support,\u201d she said.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Bronx Democrats are backing Zohran Mamdani\u2019s bid for mayor. Borough President Vanessa Gibson, the Bronx Democratic Party, Bronx Democratic Party Chair, state Sen. Jamaal Bailey City Council Member Oswald Feliz and others endorsed Mamdani this week,\nCity &amp; State reports\n.\n\u2014 ICYMI, attorney Jim Walden, who was running as an independent, dropped out of the mayoral race on Tuesday. \u201cThe math is the math,\u201d Walden\ntold the New York Times\non Tuesday. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t make sense for me to continue to push to surge, only to take votes away from another candidate or other candidates who are going to need it.\u201d\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$15 million\nfor a 2,980-square-foot, sponsored-sale condominium unit at 20 East 76th Street in Lenox Hill. Lauren Muss and Michelle Griffith with Douglas Elliman had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$5.6 million\nfor a 3,750-square-foot, four-family walkup at 138 Noble Street in Greenpoint.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $22.5 million for a 3,242-square-foot condo unit at 70 Vestry Street in Tribeca.\nCortnee B. Glasser with Sotheby\u2019s\nand\nJared Schwadron with Compass\nhave the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 171,907-square-foot, 187-unit residential project at 819 Grand Street in East Williamsburg. Curtis + Ginsberg Architects filed the permit on behalf of St. Nicks Alliance.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Savanna is pouncing on yet another discounted office deal, even as the company works through\nits own distress issues\n.\nNicholas Bienstock and Christopher Schlank\u2019s company is in contract to buy the leasehold on Westbrook Partners\u2019 444 Madison Avenue for $50 million,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nWestbrook, which bought the lease on the 1930s-era office building for $314 million in 2007, defaulted on its Wells Fargo $120 million loan. The bank put the loan up for sale late last year in an offering that would have given a buyer a direct path to taking over the property through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.\nBut in the end, Wells arranged a deal to sell the property outright and accept a discounted payoff through a short sale.\nRepresentatives for Savanna, Wells Fargo and Westbrook did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nA Newmark team led by Adam Spies and Adam Doneger negotiated the sale.\nThis is the third office property Savanna has snapped up in the past nine months \u2014 making it one of the more opportunistic buyers in New York despite its existing portfolio having its own share of problems.\n\nIn February, the company bought the leasehold on 430 West 15th Street in the Meatpacking District for\n$85 million\n\u2014 a sharp discount to the $159 million that Invesco had paid for the property in 2018.\nAnd last November, Savanna bought the newly constructed office building at 799 Broadway for\n$255 million\n, after owner Columbia Property Trust had defaulted on its $270 million mortgage.\nThe roughly 470,000-square-foot office building at 444 Madison Avenue is about half empty. The ground lease can be extended by 63 years to 2089,and Savanna will be able to try to renegotiate the terms with the owner of the land underneath, the Kandel family.\nSavanna is partnering with Summit Properties on the acquisition.\nAfter pandemic shutdowns cleared out office buildings, the asset class became a red line for many investors. But in the past year or so, opportunistic buyers have been coming back to the market \u2014 characterizing it as a once-in-a-cycle opportunity to scoop up distressed properties at attractive values last seen following the great recession.\nAs Savanna has eyed new buying deals, it\u2019s also working through its own distress.\nThe company earlier this summer missed a critical loan payment on its\n$463 million CMBS mortgage\nat 5 Bryant Park. And last month, it lost its new office development at 141 Willoughby Street in Downtown Brooklyn to foreclosure.\n",

        "content": "An apartment at Ian Schrager\u2019s 160 Leroy Street just rented for a peak price.\nAn associate of billionaire Michael Rubin leased Unit 8A-North for $40,000 a month, or $234 per square foot,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned. The price is a record for the building, beating its previous price of $32,000 a month, or $189 per square foot.\nThe three-bedroom apartment was last rented in March.\nThe pricey rental deal comes as elevated demand for homes in Downtown Manhattan has pushed sale prices to new heights. Earlier this year, a financier\u2019s penthouse at 150 Charles broke records when it sold for\n$60 million\n, double the last purchase price. Just six months later, Aurora Capital Associates\u2019 140 Jane Street snagged a signed contract for a penthouse asking\n$88 million\n.\nThe West Village \u201cis an area without a lot of inventory, but it\u2019s really desirable,\u201d said R New York\u2019s Matteo Rignanese, who represented the owner with Samantha Wes. He added that the rental price is \u201cgood news for 80 Clarkson,\u201d Zeckendorf Development and Atlas Capital\u2019s\nhotly anticipated\nnew development tower, which is rumored to be snapping up top-dollar deals off market.\nRignanese said he first rented the 2,000-square-foot unit for $28,000 a month in 2023, up from its previous price of $22,000.\n\nUnit 8A-N isn\u2019t the first apartment to snag $40,000 a month, as another 8th-floor unit locked down that price in 2021. However, the price per square foot worked out to $171.\nThe apartment last traded in July for $7 million, according to public records. Rignanese, who represented the seller in the deal, said the previous tenant backed out of the lease in the middle of negotiations, and to push the sale over the finish line, he promised to find the buyers a new renter.\nThe latest lease signing followed a bidding war for the unit in which Rubin, the CEO of Fanatics, was involved in securing the apartment for his associate, who Rignanese described as an executive at the sports platform. Rubin\nowns a penthouse\nat 160 Leroy, which he paid $44 million for in 2018, then the priciest sale recorded below 14th Street in Manhattan.\nThe apartment was rented unfurnished. It has three bathrooms and 11-foot, floor-to-ceiling windows.\nAmenities at the building, which Schrager developed with Ares Management, Weinberg Properties and William Gottlieb Real Estate, include 24-hour doormen, a port-cochere, pool and fitness center.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article said Unit 8A-North was leased under a two-year term. Upon clarification from the listing broker, it has been updated to reflect the deal for a one-yeat term.\n",

The auctions will be live and will offer teleconference options.\nOne estate is Camp Iroquois in Saranac Lake, considered one of the region\u2019s traditional \u201cGreat Camps.\u201d The nine-acre estate was built more than a century ago and includes a 4,000-square-foot home.\nThe waterfront estate has six sleeping cabins, a dining hall, a four-car garage, a tennis and pickleball court, a workshop and gardens.\nThe property last traded hands via auction in 2020 for $2.4 million. It\u2019s on the market for $4.3 million, but it\u2019s going up for auction on Sept. 23 without reserve, meaning there\u2019s no minimum winning bid.\nThe other property is in the hamlet of Bloomingdale \u2014 part of the town of St. Armand \u2014 and is on the market for the first time. The massive estate spans 295 acres across three parcels and has two lakes, a brook that runs through the property and extensive hiking trails.\nIn terms of structures, there are three residences \u2014 A 1,700-square-foot main home built in 1838, a 1,300-square-foot guest cabin added and a 700-square-foot log cottage built a few years ago \u2014 as well as a garage, a workshop, a woodshed and generator.\n\nThe property was previously listed for almost $5.3 million, but is set to be auctioned on Oct. 9 with a reserve of $2.3 million.\nPlatinum Luxury Auctions is organizing and hosting the auction process for both properties.\nBig Adirondack properties are commanding big bucks.

Departing brokers include Jamie Gagliano and Matthew Mackay, who joined Black\u2019s team in June from his own Elliman team, the Mackay Dixon Team. It\u2019s unclear whether others will be joining him.\n\nA number of firms had reached out in the past few months, according to Black, who said he took meetings for the sake of \u201cdue diligence and seeing what\u2019s out there, not from any position of, \u2018I\u2019m looking for something else.\u2019\u201d\nOne team member not jumping to Corcoran is Elliman agent Glenn Davis, who joined Black\u2019s team\nas a partner\nto bolster the cohort\u2019s foothold in new development sales. The move came six months after Black hired Gagliano, who previously led operations for the Holly Parker Team while Parker was still with Elliman.\nBlack\u2019s team also\nset up shop\nin the Hamptons in May 2024 and snagged a few eight-figure deals to mark its debut on the East End, including the $15.5 million sales of 8 John Street in Sag Harbor and 139 Seascape Lane in Sagaponack.\nAmong Black\u2019s latest deals in Manhattan is a penthouse at 111 Murray Street, a listing he shared with Elliman\u2019s De Niro team and which closed for\n$28 million\nin July. Shortly before leaving Corcoran the first time, Black sold singer\nDenise Rich\u2019s penthouse at 785 Fifth Avenue for $54 million\n.\nEarlier this summer,\ndeveloper Rotem Rosen and partners tapped Black\n, under Elliman\u2019s new development marketing arm, to head sales at their 145-unit building at 126 57th Street, known as Malabar Residences. Black will not be bringing the Billionaires\u2019 Row project over with him to Corcoran.\nBlack\u2019s move follows several of Elliman\u2019s top producers who have exited the firm on the heels of\na leadership shakeup last year\nand a string of quarterly losses. A number of agents have decamped for Corcoran, including veteran agent Kathy Murray and\nKirsten Jordan, who brought her eponymous team\nto the firm earlier this year. Other departures included veteran agent\nHolly Parker and her New York-based team\nand \u201cMillion Dollar Listing Los Angeles\u201d star\nTracy Tutor,\nwho both departed Elliman this year to join Compass.\n",

        "content": "Developer and Charney Companies founder\nSam Charney\nopened up about his real estate history in the first episode of\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s \u201cThe Industry Dish\u201d series.\nCharney shared his road to success while cooking a steak and pasta dinner inside the Gaggenau Test Kitchen in Manhattan. The developer grew up in The Big Apple and bore witness to the \u201cgrittiness and cultural scene\u201d of the city in the 1980s and \u201990s. \u201cThat kind of formed who I am and what I bring to development,\u201d he said.\nBecoming a developer wasn\u2019t exactly in his career plans as a student at Bates College. He was an art history major whose worldview was changed by a \u201cPicturesque Suburbia\u201d class examining the relationship between the popularization of the automobile and the growth of suburban life in the United States.\n\u201cI found it fascinating and really was interested in becoming an urban planner,\u201d he said. He went on to do a summer program for those interested in becoming urban planners or architects, but admittedly felt out of his league at first.\n\u201cEveryone around me was so much more talented than I was,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were building the Taj Mahal out of toothpicks and I could barely draw a stick figure. And I realized I was definitely in the wrong place.\u201d\nHe ended up returning to his home city and turned his sights to real estate development as he admired the developer\u2019s role in having \u201ccontrol\u201d over projects that architects don\u2019t enjoy. He likened the role to being a producer of a movie assembling the team of creatives and ensuring the production runs smoothly across all fronts.\nAfter getting his master\u2019s from New York University, Charney began working as a project executive for\nTwo Trees Management\n, where he spent nearly a decade overseeing the development of more than 1 million square feet of offices and housing.\nIn 2013, he founded his own firm, Charney Companies, and hasn\u2019t looked back. In the 12 years since then, the Long Island City-based firm has built more than 1,000 units in New York City. Another 3,000 units are in the works.\nCharney said his affinity for the outer boroughs arose in childhood and having \u201cnegative\u201d experiences visiting his grandparents in Brooklyn. In the early 2000s, as the borough was shaping up for a development rebirth that continues today, he lamented that tenants were forced to seek cheaper options as prices went up.\nAt the turn of the 2010s, Charney, while working at Two Trees, looked to Long Island City and its myriad industrial spaces ripe for residential conversion and new construction. Charney Companies\u2019 first project, the 11-story Jackson Condominium building in Long Island City, was developed in 2015.\n\nNext stop: Brooklyn. Charney was attracted to the borough by the rezoning of Gowanus and potential for residential development. The pandemic threw a wrench into the plans but he pushed forward upon realization that \u201cNew York\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d\nIt hasn\u2019t come without its challenges. New construction projects in Manhattan, for example, face height limits and sky exposure plane restrictions, such as the student housing project known as 99 Claremont next to The Riverside Church in Morningside Heights.\n\u201cWhen I saw that, I said, \u2018Okay, we need to buy this building,\u2019 because not only is it, cost-wise, below replacement cost, but I don\u2019t think you could actually replace it because of the shape of the building and the depth of the building,\u201d he said. His company pursued the asset despite not having a plan in place and armed with the knowledge that it \u201chad to own\u201d it and \u201cfigure it out.\u201d\nCharney\u2019s New York upbringing helped ingrain \u201ca tremendous amount of critical thinking\u201d in his everyday life where he prioritized having \u201creal-life experiences\u201d that taught him how to become an effective developer when first getting into construction.\nThe developer is now in the process of teaching his children how to critically think just as he did. \u201cI\u2019m very fortunate that my children love to read,\u201d he said.\nMuch like the steaks on the grill, Charney emphasized the importance of \u201chigh-quality\u201d ingredients. That includes high-end materials and finishes and a granular focus on every detail of the project in person to ensure delivering the best product possible.\nAs for those younger people who are interested in getting into real estate, he encouraged them to take any class that would help them get their feet wet in industry knowledge. \u201cYou\u2019ll instantly have a cohort of real estate friends to talk with and start to understand the industry,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI got lucky; I got thrown on construction sites in my early twenties. I had no idea what I was doing, but I was told, \u2018You are now the super, the project manager, everything.\u2019 And I worked 18-hour days to learn and understand how to build a building,\u201d he said. \u201cI learned from the subcontractors and I learned from the consultants, the architects and the engineers, et cetera, and I picked their brains and had conversations with them.\u201d Some of those relationships he still maintains today.\nThe interview was filmed at\nB/S/H Home Appliance Corporation\n\u2019s New York City Experience &amp; Design Center. Thanks to B/S/H for sharing their space and making this interview possible.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "New Jersey is partially refilling the affordable housing trust fund it gutted a few months ago, but developers say the fix falls far short of what\u2019s needed.\nThe $125 million Affordable Housing Trust Fund was stripped down to a mere $5 million in June during budget talks, sparking outrage from builders, housing advocates and local officials. Now, the Department of Community Affairs says it is putting $45 million back into the program, Gothamist\nreported\n.\nThe money is expected to support 10 to 20 projects; $10 million is carved out specifically for Habitat for Humanity, which provides homeownership opportunities.\nDevelopers can begin reapplying for funding at the end of the week, though there\u2019s a $3 million cap per project. Those who already had proposals in \u2014 some stalled midstream after the June cut \u2014 will have to restart the process. A Habitat project in Old Bridge, which was left with a $4 million funding gap, is among those still in limbo.\nHousing advocates welcomed the move but were quick to call it a Band-Aid. Liz DeCoursey, chief executive officer of Greater Middlesex &amp; Morris Habitat, called the restoration \u201cgreat news\u201d but warned her group still has dozens of projects sidelined.\n\nThe rollback hit months after lawmakers passed a law aimed at creating more than 80,000 affordable homes over the next decade. The cuts jeopardized that timeline and deepened frustration with Gov. Phil Murphy\u2019s administration, which argued the raid of the pot was necessary to fund other housing initiatives, including first-time buyer assistance.\nDevelopers and local leaders say uncertainty over the fund complicates planning and financing at a moment when the state faces one of the nation\u2019s most acute affordability crunches. A full restoration may not come until November, when a new administration takes office, but advocates say they\u2019ll keep pressing.\n\u201cCreating affordable housing remains one of the department\u2019s highest priorities,\u201d DCA Commissioner Jacquelyn Su\u00e1rez said in a statement.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The City Council is doing everything it can to hold onto its power over rezonings.\nCouncil leaders are calling on the Board of Elections to remove three of\nfive questions\nthat are expected to be posed to voters in November. The trio of ballot questions threatens to weaken the Council\u2019s authority over land use decisions by, among other things, shifting final approval of certain projects away from the body.\nIf passed, the questions would be a major blow to the Council\u2019s longstanding tradition of member deference. And it is no secret that City Council members are loath to relinquish their leverage over rezonings \u2014 or any leverage.\nBut with two months until the general election, the Council is escalating its fight against the proposals\napproved\nby the mayor\u2019s Charter Revision Commission. Leaders argue that the phrasing of three of the questions conceals the ramifications of the proposed changes from voters, quietly transferring power away from local Council members.\nAnd absent action by the board, the City Council appears ready to sue the Adams administration over the questions.\nIn a\nletter\nto the Board of Elections, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, Deputy Speaker Diana Ayala, Majority Leader Amanda Far\u00edas and Minority Leader Joann Ariola asked the board\u2019s commissioners to exclude the three questions from the November ballot. The letter describes the questions as a \u201ccynical political ploy to mislead voters\u201d and transfer power from their elected City Council members to mayoral appointees (in this case, the Board of Standards and Appeals and the City Planning Commission, which already have the ability to sign off on certain actions).\nDuring a Board of Elections meeting on Tuesday, President Frederic Umane questioned whether the board has the authority to reject the Charter Revision Commission\u2019s ballot questions, given that the board typically serves a ministerial role.\n\u201cIf we have the power, as far as I know, we haven\u2019t used it,\u201d he said, later asking, \u201cIsn\u2019t this better suited for the courts?\u201d\nJason Ota\u00f1o, general counsel for the City Council, said he believes the board has the ability to reject the questions, but acknowledged that the City Council wants to exhaust all avenues before taking the issue to court.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen lately, but we\u2019re not shy about suing our partners in government across the hall,\u201d he said, alluding to previous lawsuits\nfiled by the Council\nagainst the Adams administration.\nThree questions under the microscope\nOne of the questions the Council wants eliminated asks whether the city should replace the mayoral veto in the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, or Ulurp, with a three-member appeals board for certain projects. The proposed board, made up of the mayor, City Council speaker and applicable borough president, could reverse City Council decisions on land use applications on certain projects. The board could only act on projects that would result in affordable housing in one borough, not citywide land use actions.\n\nAnother asks voters if a shorter version of Ulurp should be created. Such a process, dubbed the Expedited Land Use Review Procedure, or Elurp, would be applied to \u201cmodest\u201d housing and infrastructure projects, and would either avoid review by the City Council or City Planning Commission, depending on the project type.\nThe third would allow the Board of Standards and Appeals to waive zoning requirements for publicly funded affordable housing projects. A separate fast-track process would be available for affordable housing projects proposed in the 12 community districts with the lowest rates of affordable housing construction over a five-year period. Such projects would go through a condensed version of Ulurp that skips City Council review, ending instead with a City Planning Commission vote.\nThe Council claims that, as written, these questions \u201cfail to inform voters that the ballot proposals will completely eliminate the City Council\u2019s existing authority on behalf of the public to approve or modify a wide range of land use proposals\u2014including many projects made up almost entirely of luxury housing.\u201d\nA source familiar with the thinking of the Charter Revision Commission\u2019s members called the City Council\u2019s argument \u201cborderline absurd.\u201d The source pointed out that\nstate law\nsets word count limits for ballot questions: 15 words for a title, 30 words for a summary of the proposal and another 30 to describe in \u201cplain language\u201d the outcomes of a yes or no vote.\nThe\nballot questions\nclearly describe how authority over certain land use actions would shift with a \u201cyes\u201d vote compared to a \u201cno\u201d vote, a spokesperson for the Charter Revision Commission said.\n\u201cWe are confident in the rigor and legal basis for the Commission\u2019s important work to address the city\u2019s housing crisis,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement.\nFight over leverage\nThe ballot questions have become a flashpoint in the troubled relationship between the mayor and City Council.\nThe proposals\ntake aim\nat the Council\u2019s tradition of voting according to the wishes of the local member, known as member deference. Speaker Adrienne Adams has criticized the ballot questions as an unfair attempt to pin the city\u2019s housing crisis on the City Council, citing that the body has approved more than 120,000 housing units since 2022. She has also pointed to the mayor\u2019s\nreversal\non housing planned for the Elizabeth Street Garden as evidence of the administration getting in the way of housing production.\nAt the same time, developers tend to\npull their zoning applications\nif the local Council member signals their disapproval. In the past decade, at least 45 applications that began public review were abandoned. It\u2019s unclear how many more developers refrained from filing in the first place, not willing to risk pouring time and money into a doomed project.\nOther cities, including Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, have versions of deferring to local elected officials on land use actions. Some of those programs are similarly being interrogated. For example, Chicago\u2019s \u201caldermanic prerogative\u201d came under federal scrutiny following allegations that the veto power fueled racial segregation by blocking affordable housing in predominantly white neighborhoods. This month, the Trump administration\ndropped\ntwo investigations into the practice.\n",

        "content": "Guy Gal\u2019s white-label firm Side has set up shop in New Jersey.\nThe company marked its foray into the Garden State with the launch of Priv\u00e9 Haus, a new brokerage founded by top-producing agents David \u201cDJ\u201d and Nicole \u201cNici\u201d Ten Hoeve, Side announced on Wednesday.\nThe husband-and-wife pair is flying solo after 17 years with Keller Williams, where their team rose to prominence. Their cohort, which services Monmouth, Middlesex, and Ocean counties, ranked among the top 10 large teams in New Jersey last year with $139 million in sales, according to RealTrends.\nThe couple\u2019s team, Ten Hoeve Advisory, will operate as a team within the brokerage. Joining them from Keller Williams are eight agents and four support staffers. Priv\u00e9 Haus will serve as the \u201canchor\u201d for Side\u2019s operations in the state, alongside other boutique firms in Montclair, Verona and Kinnelon.\nThe Ten Hoeves have been planning to start their own brokerage since first partnering 15 years ago, according to DJ. Though they operated under the Keller Williams flag, the two have largely controlled their own marketing and operated their team as a business within itself.\nOver the years, DJ said they were approached by other firms such as\nMauricio Umansky\u2019s The Agency\n, which first expanded to the East Coast in 2023, and\nRyan Serhant\u2019s eponymous firm\n, which set up shop in New Jersey in 2023, but ultimately, he and Nici wanted to try their hand at business ownership.\n\u201cWe had four options on the table,\u201d said DJ. Either they join one of the boutique brokerages offering to take them in, open their own shop from square one or partner with an entity like Side, which would provide all the back-end nuts and bolts. Side was a \u201clighter lift than having to start completely from scratch.\u201d\n\nDJ said he and Nici\u2019s goal is to bring the top agents in the region under the new banner, with a focus on recruiting brokers trading homes in the upper echelons of the market.\n\u201cA lot of top brokers stand out in the brokerage they\u2019re in,\u201d where most of the agents are \u201cmediocre,\u201d DJ said. \u201cIt gets lonely.\u201d\nSide\u2019s New Jersey outpost joins those in 16 other states, including California, Texas, Florida, D.C., New York and Massachusetts. The company is partnered with 19 brokerages across New York and New Jersey, including the\nfirm Magnetic\n, launched earlier this year by longtime Brown Harris Stevens agent Scott Harris.\nSide made a splash in New York City in 2022 when then-top brokers Oren and Tal Alexander left Douglas Elliman to launch their own brokerage, Official, alongside Nicole Oge, Richard Jordan and Andrew Wachtfogel.\nBut the firm collapsed about a year ago following reports of sexual assault allegations against the Alexanders, who initially stepped down from their roles before taking full control of the company. Side sued Official and Tal and Oren over an alleged unpaid loan given to them to start the company, though the parties\nsettled the lawsuit\nin April.\n",

It does not determine it.\nThat is why it\u2019s not the industry\u2019s fault that\nbowling alleys have been disappearing\nand self-storage businesses have been proliferating. It\u2019s because bowling has\nlost popularity\nand Americans are increasingly seeking space to store their stuff.\nOccupancy of self-storage units is nearly 94 percent nationwide, as well as in the New York metro area. About one in nine households use self-storage, but only about\none in 30\nAmericans bowl 12 or more times a year.\nWhich brings us to Deer Park, a hamlet on Long Island. Newsday\nreports\nthat nearly 2,000 residents are asking the Babylon planning board to reject a rezoning that would allow\nJoseph Giaquinto\n\u2019s LAG Associates to lease 849 Long Island Avenue, which has been a bowling alley since 1959, to Public Storage. LAG would bulldoze the bowling alley and build a two-story, 17,000-square-foot storage facility.\nThe residents say that Strike 10 Lanes is a \u201csymbol of community\u201d and is treasured by many, including students with special education needs. \u201cPlease do not take this bowling alley away from them,\u201d one parent told the planning board. \u201cThis is all they have.\u201d (Yelp shows\nbowling alleys\nin nearby West Babylon, Commack and Melville.)\nI would bet that if Giaquinto were asking to convert a longstanding self-storage facility into a 30-lane bowling alley, Deer Park residents would object to that as well, citing traffic congestion and their need for storage space. People don\u2019t like change. But I digress.\nAlthough the market has deemed self-storage more lucrative than bowling, the laws of economics will not necessarily determine the immediate future of the 58,000-square-foot lot at 849 Long Island Avenue. That\u2019s because Strike 10 Lanes is still open and is apparently a viable business at the rent it is paying, and without permission from Babylon the property owner cannot change the use to self-storage.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nAre property owners on Block 780, immediately south of Penn Station, lobbying the Trump administration to select a\nstation re-design plan\nthat does not require demolition of their buildings? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Daily Dirt readers provided two reasons that Colorado-based REIT UDR is only\nlooking for about $500 million\nfor a portfolio of five Manhattan buildings it purchased in 2012 for $635 million from Laurence Gluck\u2019s Stellar Management and the Chetrit Group.\nOne, as expected, is that cap rates are higher now, meaning buyers are demanding more net income from properties relative to the purchase price.\nThe second reason, which real estate investor John Morgan discovered by sifting through Department of Finance records, is that the Columbus Square buildings\u2019 tax breaks have expired or soon will.\nThe properties \u2014 801 Amsterdam Avenue and 775, 795, 805 and 808 Columbus Avenue \u2014 all had\n421a\nabatements for their residential portions and\nICIP\nfor their commercial space at the time of the\n2012 deal\n.\n\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 Rep. Jerry Nadler, whose district spans much of Manhattan, announced that he would not seek re-election, which may lead to a crowded race to succeed him,\nGothamist\nreported. Democratic Party insiders report that City Council member Erik Bottcher and state Assembly member Alex Bores are interested in running. Another potential candidate is Assembly member and former Nadler aide Micah Lasher. Democrat Liam Elkind had planned to run against Nadler.\n\u2014 An anti-Andrew Cuomo campaign has evolved into a super PAC. DREAM, which stood for \u201cDon\u2019t Rank Evil Andrew for Mayor,\u201d is relaunching with a new message: \u201cDon\u2019t Re-elect Eric or Andrew for Mayor.\u201d The independent expenditure group aims to counter the millions flowing into PACs backing Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams and to bolster Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani\u2019s bid, according to\nThe City\n.\n\u2014 Adams is facing more City Council pushback over three ballot proposals that would shift final authority on land-use approvals away from the Council, eroding if not ending \u201cmember deference,\u201d\nCommercial Observer\nreported. In a letter to the Board of Elections, Council leaders argued the proposals contain misleading language and, if passed, would strip communities of their only elected voice in such decisions.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$17.2 million\nfor a 5,468-square-foot townhouse at 400 West 12th Street, Unit TH3, aka Superior Ink, in the West Village. Dante Iraola and Trove with Compass had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$105 million\nfor a 342,596-square-foot, 18-story office building at 440 Ninth Avenue in Manhattan.\nThe Real Deal\nreported on the sale by Taconic Partners and Nuveen Real Estate to David Werner.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$23 million\nfor a 3,478-square-foot condominium unit at 15 Central Park West on the Upper West Side. The Mercedes Berk Team at Engel &amp; Volkers has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 11,327-square-foot, six-unit residential project at 1569 56th Street in Borough Park. Eli Schneider filed the permit on behalf of developer Juda Klein.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

It\u2019s part of a partnership with KITH Ivy, a private members\u2019 padel club launched by the streetwear brand KITH.\nBut there\u2019s a catch.\nThe counter is not a full grocery store and, more importantly, will only be physically accessible to KITH Ivy members, Erewhon told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe club plans to charge a $36,000 initiation fee and $7,000 per year in annual dues, according to reporter Emily Sundberg, who runs the Substack Feed Me.\n\nHowever, for those of more modest means, dreams of strolling the village with a Hailey Bieber Strawberry Glaze Skin smoothie need not be totally dashed. Non-club members can purchase smoothies and juices in \u201climited quantities\u201d through Postmates and Uber Eats, the grocer said.\nErewhon, which got its start as a macrobiotic store in Boston, has been teasing a New York location for years.\nIts host setting has already been beset with controversy.\nIn March, at least 30 West Village residents rallied against the property\u2019s bid for a liquor license, saying it will drive up noise and traffic. Initial applications included a rooftop bar with an occasional DJ, which then shifted to a rooftop restaurant extension with no music and no liquor license, as of March.\nThe Erewhon counter will be opposite the sauna, steam room and cold plunge, according to plans published to Instagram by KITH founder and CEO Ronnie Fieg. Fieg joins the Cayre family of Midtown Equities, as well as the longtime restaurateurs behind the East Village\u2019s Cafe Mogador in the project.\nMaterials posted by Fieg advertise that the club \u201cis a place where hard work and play coexist harmoniously and where members are invited to embrace the full spectrum of the human experience.\u201d",

        "content": "Charles Cohen is shedding more Midtown Manhattan real estate as lenders tighten the screws on the troubled landlord.\nDays after agreeing to\nsell 623 Fifth Avenue\n, the owner struck a deal to unload 3 East 54th St. for $188 million, according to a statement filed in court last week by David Fogel, executive vice president at Cohen Brothers Realty.\nThe buyer of the 19-story, 300,000-square-foot tower wasn\u2019t named, but the funds were said to be arriving by international wire, according to the filing reported by\nCrain\u2019s\n.\nThe deal breaks down to $627 per square foot. The property carried an $85 million mortgage and was valued internally at a net $109 million. Cohen only owned a 63 percent stake in the building.\nThe agreement marks another step in Cohen\u2019s scramble to raise cash after a New York judge ordered him to\nrepay $187 million\npersonally guaranteed to Fortress.\nThe sale would cover only part of Cohen\u2019s obligations. The developer \u2014 who still controls 12\nmillion square feet of mostly Midtown office stock \u2014 was valued at $2 billion at the end of last year, nearly $1 billion less than the prior year. His financial disclosures pegged his liquid assets at $200 million, including $130 million in cash.\nThe transaction mirrors the haircut Cohen took on 623 Fifth. That Class A tower, once internally valued at $712 million, sold last week for $218 million, generating about $70 million in proceeds after debt payoff. Cohen\u2019s attorneys told the court the two sales combined could yield $100 million toward repaying Fortress \u2014 barely half of what he owes.\n\nFortress\nfiled a response\nto the pair of sales, saying the deals alluded to a larger issue with his asset stock.\n\u201cWhile the announced sale of two properties is promising in terms of creating liquidity with which to pay down Fortress\u2019 Judgment, it also confirms a troubling fact: that Mr. Cohen has wildly overstated the value of his real estate portfolio,\u201d the lender said in an Aug. 29 filing.\nThe 54th Street property may not remain an office tower much longer. Cohen\u2019s lawyers described it as a development site, suggesting a buyer could raze it for a hotel or residential project.\nCBRE is also shopping Cohen\u2019s 1 million-square-foot 622 Third Avenue, which carries a $400 million mortgage, with five prospective buyers reportedly circling.\nFor Fortress, the fire sales mark progress in a year-long fight to recoup more than $500 million it says Cohen defaulted on. The private equity giant has accused him of shifting assets \u2014 including his Connecticut home and 220-foot yacht \u2014 into his wife\u2019s name, allegations Cohen denies.\nWhether Cohen can unload enough of his portfolio to satisfy Fortress remains to be seen.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "pub_date_dt": "2025-09-02T20:24:00",
        "content": "The megaproject known as Innovation QNS will not happen, but the controversial rezoning that allowed it seems likely to yield a number of smaller developments. One, at least.\nThe team of developers that planned the five-site, 3,200-unit Innovation QNS has broken up since the\nNovember 2022 rezoning\nwas approved by the City Council.\nSilverstein Properties is out, and a second member of the development trio, BedRock Real Estate Partners, is moving ahead on one of the two Astoria sites it controls with a subsidiary of L+M Development Partners. The two firms\nformed a joint venture\nlast summer.\nBedRock, led by Chuck Berman and Tracey Appelbaum, and Ron Moelis\u2019 L+M, run by CEO Lisa Gomez, filed plans Friday for a 560-unit, 498,000-square-foot, mixed-use building at 35-18 Steinway Street, with Beyer Blinder Belle as the architect. The site,\nacquired for $47.7 million\n, currently has a 33,000-square-foot building leased to P.C. Richard, plus parking. The developers intend to include space in their project for P.C. Richard.\nBedRock and L+M entity LMXD, led by David Dishy, aim to match the affordable housing framework \u2014 45 percent of units affordable, including 15 percent for households earning 30 percent of the area median income, on average \u2014 of the rezoning agreement reached by the original development team, which included Kaufman Astoria Studios. Such deep affordability would require subsidies, which were expected with the original project approval.\nAt a minimum, multifamily projects that take advantage of the rezoning must set aside 25 percent of units for households earning, on average, 60 percent of the area median income, under the Mandatory Inclusionary Zoning law.\nA spokesperson for the joint BedRock/LMXD venture said it is \u201clooking forward to working with the city to deliver additional affordable housing that reflects the goal of the original project\u2019s Ulurp approval.\u201d\n\nAt 560 units, the Steinway Street project is among the largest planned under the state\u2019s 485x tax abatement. It would be obliged to pay construction and building service workers an average of $40 an hour, according to the terms of the abatement.\nScoring financing could be a challenge for BedRock and LMXD. Most 485x projects filed have been 99 units or fewer to avoid the wage floor, and few, if any of them, have scored construction loans.\nThe original Innovation QNS team dissolved as the agendas of its members changed. Silverstein and its CEO, Marty Burger,\nwent their separate ways\nin October 2023 in part because founder Larry Silverstein and his daughter, Lisa Silverstein, who took the reins at the firm, did not want to start large, new projects beyond 2 World Trade Center, 5 World Trade Center and its Manhattan casino bid.\nA Silverstein spokesperson said the firm decided not to pursue Innovation QNS for multiple reasons, including uncertainty about multifamily development tax policy after the state let 421a expire in June 2022.\nA year before the rezoning, Hackman Capital Partners and Square Mile Capital Management acquired Kaufman Astoria\u2019s century-old, landmarked property at 34-12 36th Street. Silverstein was a rival bidder. The reported\n$600 million deal\nwas a studio space play, unlike Innovation QNS, which was largely a multifamily project.\nThe demise of the $2 billion Innovation QNS raises the question of how the project-wide commitments made in the original development team\u2019s deal with the City Council will be applied to individual projects on the five development sites.\n",

        "content": "Halfway through a decade that is redefining West Palm Beach\u2019s skyline, developers have more than a dozen condo projects in the pipeline totaling more than 2,000 units, according to an analysis by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nConstruction loans for four projects total nearly $1.4 billion, and developments that launched sales early on are completing construction. Two Roads Development and Alpha Blue Ventures began closings for their\nFort\u00e9 on Flagler\ntower at 1309 South Flagler Drive earlier this summer, which topped $289 million in presales.\nIn recent years, planned condos, once concentrated to the city\u2019s core, have stretched farther north. At least nine projects are now slated for the neighborhoods north of Flagler Memorial Bridge.\n\u201cThey are testing the North Flagler market,\u201d said Gary Pohrer, an agent with Serhant. He is a fan of the neighborhood, and pointed to the\nNora District\nas an attraction, but called the area \u201cunproven.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a rapid growth spurt for a once sleepy city that has captured the imagination of billionaire developers dreaming of Wall Street South. Titans like Steve Ross, Jeff Greene, David Martin and Jorge P\u00e9rez are leading the charge, devout believers with billions of dollars invested in the West Palm Beach of tomorrow. But are buyers believers?\nMarket insiders say yes \u2013\u2013 but units aren\u2019t flying off the shelves.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the Miami pace that you sell half a building in one year, it\u2019s a more patient market,\u201d said Kenneth Baboun, the founder of BGI Companies and developer of Alba Palm Beach. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the investor market that Miami has, we have an end user market.\u201d\nDevelopers are betting big on the future of West Palm Beach. The stakes are high, and projects\u2019 sales performance and construction timeline can cut through the marketing fluff to paint a more accurate picture about the developments\u2019 progress.\nFollowing the money\nOf the dozen-plus condos currently in development, only seven have launched sales, and only three confirmed their presales for this story.\nBaboun\u2019s Alba is more than 60 percent presold, he confirmed. He and his partners landed\na $95 million construction loan\nfrom Kriss Capital in 2023, and are set to finish construction in the spring of 2026.\nMr. C Residences West Palm Beach, the Terra and Sympatico Real Estate\u2019s Cipriani-branded project, is 70 percent presold, a spokesperson confirmed. The developers scored\na $285 million construction loan\nfrom Tyko Capital last month.\nRelated Group and BH Group\u2019s planned Ritz-Carlton Residences, West Palm Beach is nearing 50 percent in presales and is expected to start construction in the first quarter of 2026, a spokesperson confirmed.\n\u201cWe were not expecting sales in July and August,\u201d yet the sales office stayed busy, said Chris Leavitt, a member of the Ritz-Carlton\u2019s Douglas Elliman marketing team.\nWhile Related Ross declined to comment on sales figures for its planned South Flagler House, sources say it is near 50 percent presold.\nNew York firm Savanna\u2019s Olara is also around 50 percent presold, sources say. That\u2019s underwhelming to some brokers. \u201cYou would expect to have better sales or sales further down the road at this point in Olara,\u201d said Erin Sykes with Sykes Properties.\nOther sales efforts have stalled, victims of \u201cfalse starts,\u201d said Baboun, who pointed to Related Ross\u2019 Shorecrest. Sales launched last year, and the project has since been redesigned twice.\n\u201cEarly on there was some conversation, and they did host a big broker focused event at Harry\u2019s [Bar &amp; Restaurant],\u201d Sykes said. \u201cOnce you make a lot of changes\u2026 the changes became the topic of conversation, and not the project.\u201d\nThe market\u2019s velocity isn\u2019t inspiring to Greene. He is waiting to launch sales on his Herzog &amp; de Mueron-designed towers, which he says will compete at the high end of the market with the Bristol and South Flagler House.\n\u201cIf Olara was at 75 percent, and South Flagler was 80 percent sold, of course we would just do whatever it takes [to launch],\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not in any hurry. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough buyers right now.\u201d\nGreene blames high interest rates, but he also says pre-development sales are a new concept to the area\u2019s buyers. \u201cWest Palm Beach has never been a pre-buy market,\u201d Greene said. \u201cWest Palm has never been that robust of a market. People don\u2019t really get the idea of buying a condo until they see it being built.\u201d\nIt also doesn\u2019t help that buyers are seeking immediate gratification in their purchases, making a yearslong wait for construction an unappealing proposition.\n\u201cThey want new, and they want now,\u201d Baboun said.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the condo developments planned in West Palm Beach:\nSouth Flagler House | 1355 South Flagler Drive | Related Ross\nRelated Ross\u2019 planned South Flagler House landed a $600 million construction loan in June, marking the Sunshine State\u2019s single largest condo loan this year.\nRoss launched sales for South Flagler House with Suzanne Frisbie of the Corcoran Group in 2023, after buying the project from Hines and Frisbie Group for $194.6 million. Sources say it is near 50 percent presold, something the developer declined to comment on.\n\nThe 28-story, 108-unit development designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects will have two towers. Prices start at $7.9 million and go up to $73 million for the penthouse. The median price is $15 million, Frisbie said, adding that she\u2019s targeting buyers looking for single-family homes in Palm Beach at that price. Closings are expected to begin late next year, with construction well underway.\nFrisbie said seeing the project go vertical is \u201clike watching sculpture.\u201d\nShorecrest | 1901 North Flagler Drive | Related Ross\nShorecrest is Related Ross\u2019 second planned condo tower in West Palm Beach. Since launching sales last year, the waterfront tower has undergone two redesigns. Previous plans included 21,500 square feet for a house of worship for Temple Israel, which owned the site, until the synagogue membership approved\na $30 million sale\nof the site to Related Ross in December.\nThe latest plans are for a 28-story, 100-unit building with prices ranging from $2.7 million to $7 million, a spokesperson confirmed. Roger Ferris + Partners is the architect, Rottet Studio is handling interiors, and DS Boca is the landscape architect for the project. Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group is leading sales. Construction is set to start next year and completion is slated for 2027, a spokesperson confirmed.\nRitz-Carlton Residences, West Palm Beach | 1717 North Flagler Drive | Related Group, BH Group\nRitz-Carlton Residences, West Palm Beach is one in a stacked pipeline of projects from partners Related Group and BH Group. The P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related and Isaac and Liat Toledano\u2019s BH launched sales in March of last year and secured approval for this project in October. The 28-story, 137-unit waterfront tower is nearing 50 percent presold. The design team includes Arquitectonica and interiors firm Rockwell Group. Prices start at $2.5 million, with Douglas Elliman leading sales. Construction is set to begin early next year, and is slated to be completed in 2028.\nApogee | 4906 North Flagler Drive | Related Group, BH Group\nRelated Group and BH\u2019s second West Palm Beach condo tower is the planned 21-story, 39-unit Apogee. The project has been in the works since Related Group bought the site for $16 million in 2022, but only received city approval this year. The project is designed by Arquitectonica. Sales have yet to launch, and a spokesperson declined to comment on the project.\nAlba Palm Beach | 4714 North Flagler Drive | BGI Capital, Blue Road\nBGI Capital and Blue Road secured $95 million in construction financing for their planned Alba Palm Beach condos in 2023. The 22-story, 55-unit waterfront tower is now nearing completion, with construction set to wrap in early 2026. The design team includes architecture firm Spina O\u2019Rourke + Partners and landscape firm Schmidt Nichols. The developers launched sales in 2022 with Douglas Elliman, and tapped One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty to take over in 2024. The project is now more than 60 percent presold, and prices for remaining units range from $2.5 million to $7 million.\nOlara | 1919 North Flagler Drive | Savanna\nNew York City-based developer Savanna, led by Chris Schlank and Nicholas Bienstock, scored a $380 million construction loan for Olara in March. The 26-story, two-tower complex is slated to include 275 condos and 170 apartments. The design team includes Arquitectonica and interiors firm Gabellini Sheppard Associates. Douglas Elliman is leading sales, and prices range from $2 million to $10 million, the developer confirmed. Construction started last year and is expected to be completed in 2028.\nThe Berkeley | 601 and 621 Clearwater Park Road | Al Adelson, Sympatico Real Estate\nDeveloper Al Adelson and the Morrison family\u2019s Sympatico Real Estate simultaneously broke ground and launched sales on their planned condo tower, the Berkeley, in December. The 25-story, 193-unit project was designed by Arquitectonica, and condo prices range from $2 million to $10 million. Construction is set to be completed in 2027.\nMr. C Hotel &amp; Residences West Palm Beach | 320 Lakeview Avenue | Terra, Sympatico Real Estate\nThe Morrisons\u2019 Sympatico and David Martin\u2019s Terra secured a $285 million construction loan last month for their planned Mr. C Hotel &amp; Residences West Palm Beach. It will be 27 stories tall and include 146 condos and 110 hotel rooms. The design team includes Arquitectonica and interiors firm Meyer Davis. The partners launched sales in 2023, and 70 percent of the project is now presold. Prices for the remaining units start at $1.5 million, and Douglas Elliman is leading sales. Construction is slated to be completed in 2027, a spokesperson confirmed.\n2175 and 2251 North Flagler Drive | Jeff Greene\nBillionaire developer Jeff Greene\u2019s two-tower project planned for 2175 and 2251 North Flagler Drive is not likely to hit the market soon. He bought the 4.5-acre site as part of a mid-2010s buying spree, and first floated the plans in 2022. Greene tapped Pritzker Prize-winning firm Herzog &amp; de Meuron to design the 30-story, 76-unit towers, and says he\u2019s still working on the drawings. He\u2019s holding off on a sales launch until the market absorbs units already under construction.\n\u201cWe\u2019re letting everyone else go first,\u201d he said.\nFlagler House | 3705 South Flagler Drive | Perko Development, Kolter Urban\nPhil Perko\u2019s Perko Development and Kolter Urban won city approval for their planned Flagler House condos in May. One month later, they dropped $37.6 million on a buyout of the existing building of the same name on the site. The waterfront 18-story, 39-unit project will be directly across from President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club. Coral Gables-based SB Architects is the architect. Sales are set to launch early next year, Perko confirmed.\n5400 North Flagler | 5400 North Flagler Drive | Great Gulf\nGreat Gulf, the Toronto-based developer that completed the 25-story, 83-unit\nLa Clara\ntower in 2023, is planning another condominium in the city, this time on the north end of Flagler Drive. It bought the site for $28.5 million last year, and won a zoning change for the project last month. Great Gulf tapped Safdie Architects, interiors firm Studio Munge and landscape firm Enea to design the 31-story, 97-unit waterfront tower. Sales have not begun.\nRybovich Marina | 4000 and 4300 North Flagler Drive | Integra Investments, Huizenga Holdings\nHuizenga Holdings and Integra Investments are planning a $2 billion redevelopment of the waterfront around Rybovich Marina at 4200 North Flagler Drive. As part of the project, the partners proposed four condo towers totaling 660 units, with heights as high as 35 stories, the\nPalm Beach Post\nreported in February. They tapped architecture firm Kohn Pedersen Fox, known for its role in Related Companies\u2019 Hudson Yards megaproject, to design the district. The condos are still in planning stages, and sales are expected to launch in late 2026, a spokesperson confirmed.\n1105 North Dixie Highway | NDT Development, Place Projects, Wheelock Street Capital\nNDT Development, Place Projects and Wheelock Street Capital are the partners developing the Nora District, a mixed-use retail development in West Palm Beach. The first phase of the project is slated to open this fall, but the developers have more to build. They teamed up with Zach Young for an 11-story, 122-unit condominium within the Nora District. Robert Swedroe Architects is designing the building, and construction is set to begin next year and wrap in 2028. Sales have not yet launched, and a representative declined to comment on pricing.",

        "content": "Developer Dan Kodsi may be one step closer to resolving a foreclosure lawsuit brought by his lender for the Legacy Hotel &amp; Residences project at Miami Worldcenter.\nAn order entered by Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Spencer Eig gives Kodsi\u2019s Legacy MWC Trustee just over two months to pay its lender, New York-based Monarch Alternative Capital, more than $35 million, court filings show. That would satisfy the mortgage backing the downtown Miami property.\nThe judge\u2019s order grants the developer\u2019s motion for an emergency injunction, which is required for a potential refinancing of the loan. Kodsi, CEO of Royal Palm Companies, said in a July 31 hearing that he is working on a $390 million refinancing.\nThe\nlegal drama\nunfolded in court this summer after Monarch took over the loan from Larry Silverstein\u2019s Silverstein Capital Partners on June 6. About a month later, the Monarch affiliate sued to foreclose, alleging that the developer owed $31.9 million in unpaid debt backing the partially built 50-story mixed-use condo and hotel tower at 942 Northeast First Avenue in downtown Miami.\nConstruction of Legacy\nstalled\nlast year. The building is expected to have 310 short-term rental-friendly condos, a 219-key hotel and a Blue Zones medical and wellness center. Kodsi launched condo sales in 2019, and the condo portion sold out during the pandemic for an estimated $160 million.\nJudge Eig, in his order entered Aug. 22, stated that the developer and lender agreed to have the developer post a $32 million surety bond within a month. Within 75 days, the developer has to pay about $35.1 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and late fees. That deadline is about Nov. 5.\nIf both of those deadlines are met, Monarch \u201cshall satisfy the subject mortgage\u201d under Florida laws governing mortgages.\nKodsi declined to comment, as did attorneys for the developer and lender. The judge\u2019s order bans the developer, lender, their employees, agents, representatives or attorneys from making any public statements about the case.\n\nThe developer hired Kevin O\u2019Grady, chairman of Concord Summit Capital, to find financing for the project, according to a transcript of a July 31 hearing. O\u2019Grady said during the hearing that his firm has identified potential lenders. The new financing could be a combination of $235 million in C-PACE financing and $160 million from Sculptor Real Estate, likely referring to Sculptor Capital Management, the filing states.\nMonarch sought $67.5 million from the developer, which includes fees, interest and a $32.3 million return differential, the developer\u2019s counterclaim alleges. The return differential, or the minimum return calculated by the lender, is \u201cpremised on the lender funding the full $290 million note\u201d and is due in June of next year, the developer alleges in its counterclaim to the foreclosure suit, filed this summer.\nKodsi\n\u2019s Royal has worked with Monarch before. The lender is a partner in Royal Palm\u2019s Coco Beach development and a project in Puerto Rico.\nThe developer alleges that Monarch \u201ccommitted serious misconduct, including an alleged fraudulent misrepresentation, bank fraud and civil conspiracy \u2014 all in an effort to \u2018wipe out the equity\u2019 of Royal Palm\u2019s Coco Beach affiliate,\u201d Royal Palm\u2019s counterclaim alleges. But Monarch was allegedly forced to back down, which is when it shifted its attention to the Miami Worldcenter project, Royal Palm alleges.\nSilverstein Capital Partners provided the developer with\n$340 million in construction financing\nfor Legacy in late 2021, but Silverstein only funded a portion of the loan. Kodsi said during the July 31 hearing that only $30 million was funded.\nIf Kodsi can refinance the loan, he will likely next work on restarting construction. He previously said that Royal Palm affiliates have more than $140 million in equity in the Legacy Miami Worldcenter project, and condo buyers have provided about $50 million in deposits.\nThe partially constructed building is part of the 27-acre, $6 billion mixed-use\nMiami Worldcenter\ndevelopment. Miami Worldcenter Associates, a joint venture led by CIM Group, Art Falcone and Nitin Motwani, is the master developer of the master-planned project and has sold sites to other developers. Kodsi\u2019s Royal Palm also developed Paramount Miami Worldcenter, a condo tower, which was completed in 2019.\n",

        "content": "Richman Group nabbed $62.3 million in financing to begin construction of a Lake Worth Beach workforce housing project.\nMerchants Bank of Indiana provided the bulk of the construction funds with a $47 million loan, records show. Greenwich, Connecticut-based\nRichman Group\n, led by Chairman Richard Paul Richman, also obtained a $13 million loan via Palm Beach County\u2019s low-interest workforce housing bond program, as well as a $2.35 million tax-exempt mortgage from Merchants Capital Corp.\nThe financing is for Residents at Lake Worth, a planned five-story development with 195 workforce housing apartments and 279 parking spaces. In 2021, Richman paid $5 million for the 7.4-acre site at 2431 Second Avenue North in\nLake Worth Beach\n, records show.\nDesigned by Coral Gables-based Behar Font Partners, Residences at Lake Worth will feature a mix of one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments, according to Richman\u2019s website. General contractor Straticon recently broke ground on the project, according to a notice of commencement.\n\nSince its founding in 1986, Richman has developed $28-plus billion in multifamily projects with more than 166,000 units across the U.S., the firm\u2019s website states.\nLast year, Richman completed a 266-unit apartment complex with eight-story and four-story buildings in Miami-Dade County\u2019s unincorporated Naranja neighborhood. The firm built the project with a\n$44.5 million\nconstruction loan.\nAlso last year, Richman and Catalfumo Companies won approval to build an additional 620 multifamily units in two 13-story mid-rise buildings at\nGarden Station\n, a project in Palm Beach Gardens. The joint venture is currently developing an eight-story building with 396 apartments on the project site at 11025 RCA Center Drive.\nIn Boca Raton, Richman owns a 354-unit apartment complex on part of the Boca Dunes Golf &amp; Country Club. The developer completed the project in 2021 after obtaining a\n$57.4 million\nconstruction loan the previous year.",

        "content": "A home health care aide was arrested on charges she exploited her elderly patient, including getting him to sign over his $1.1 million home in Plantation.\nLillian Emeline Morris allegedly took advantage of a man in his 80s in her care, who was diagnosed with cognitive disorders and suffers from depression. Morris, 78, used her \u201cposition of trust and undue influence\u201d to take over his finances, according to a Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office investigator\u2019s July report.\n\u201cShe used his savings to buy things for her own benefit and travel abroad, causing him to lose almost his entire net worth,\u201d the investigator wrote. \u201cShe also convinced [her patient] to sign a quit claim deed, giving her ownership of his residential property.\u201d\nThe Broward County State Attorney\u2019s Office charged Morris with two felony counts of exploitation of elderly person/disabled adult for $50,000 or more. She was extradited from DeKalb County, Georgia, and is held at Paul Rein Detention Facility in Broward County.\nMorris couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. A defense attorney for Morris isn\u2019t listed in public records.\nAfter Morris was assigned as a home health care aide to the elderly man in the summer of 2022, she \u201cgained his trust\u201d and the man \u201cwas isolated from his family and completely dependent on her for his physical, emotional and financial well-being,\u201d the Broward sheriff\u2019s investigator wrote in his report.\nIn May of last year, a quit claim deed was executed transferring the man\u2019s 3,400-square-foot,\u00a0 four-bedroom home in the Westport housing subdivision in Plantation for a nominal $10 to Morris, according to records. The house, completed in 1995, last traded for $465,000 in 2010, and is now valued at over $1.1 million, according to property records and the investigator\u2019s report.\n\nMorris also diverted nearly $238,000 of her patient\u2019s savings, including for trips to Africa, Europe and Mexico, and put $80,000 from his bank account into certificates of deposit in her own name, a joint news release from the Broward sheriff\u2019s office and property appraiser says.\nAt one point, the man\u2019s family contacted the home health care agency that employed Morris, raising concerns that she was staying overnight at his home and was there during times she wasn\u2019t scheduled to work, according to the release. After the agency and Morris parted ways, she moved into her patient\u2019s home and eventually also rented out one of his bedrooms to a tenant, collecting the rent proceeds, according to the release and the investigator\u2019s report.\nThe alleged scheme started to unravel when a neighbor who is an attorney sued Morris under the Florida Adult Protective Services Act in November. The neighbor also filed a lis pendens to revoke the quit claim deed and eject Morris and her tenant from the\nPlantation\nhome, records show.\nThe Broward County Property Appraiser, which started investigating following a complaint made to the Florida Department of Children and Families, also filed a notice of insufficiency of the quit claim deed in February, citing issues with the notarization.\nRecords show that in April, Morris was fighting to keep full ownership of the home, filing a notice of interest in the property and arguing it should serve as a lien on the house.\nIn South Florida, charges against caregivers attempting to\ndefraud\ntheir elderly and disabled patients of their properties pop up sporadically.\nIn 2023, the Miami-Dade State Attorney\u2019s Office\ncharged\na caregiver with a scheme to defraud an elderly woman of her two multifamily investment properties in Miami\u2019s\nAllapattah\nand Silver Bluff neighborhoods. The caregiver used doctored quit claim deeds, and then took out an $80,000 mortgage on the Allapattah building, diverting nearly $76,000 of the funds to herself, according to an affidavit in support of the state attorney\u2019s warrant.\n",

        "content": "Receiver Alan Fine is taking over the distressed 1212 Aventura mixed-use project after more than a dozen office condo owners were forced to vacate the property this summer.\nIn an order signed on Tuesday, Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Thomas Rebull appointed Fine to oversee and manage Medical District Developments, the entity developing the nearly completed project at 21290 Biscayne Boulevard.\n1212 Aventura\nconsists of an assisted senior living facility with 163 apartments, 39 office condos spanning 25,796 square feet and 29,684 square feet of retail.\nRebull is presiding over a foreclosure case against Medical District Developments filed in March by a lender, an affiliate of Las Vegas-based Dornin Investment Group. Medical District Developments, which is currently managed by David Avan in Miami, allegedly defaulted on a\n$49.6 million\nmortgage, the foreclosure complaint states.\nBetween November and January, Medical District Developments sold 25 office condos for a combined $9.4 million, records show. Unit prices ranged from $164,100 to $1.1 million. After taking possession of the units, the buyers were forced by the city of Aventura to leave 1212 Aventura in May, court records show. Medical District Developments allegedly allowed the master building permit and the temporary certificate of occupancy to expire.\nMiguel Chamorro, an attorney for Medical District Developments, declined to comment.\n\u201cWe felt the court\u2019s appointment of a receiver was necessary to protect and stabilize 1212 Aventura,\u201d said Victor Sanabria, the lawyer for the Dornin Investment Group affiliate. \u201cWe believe it will safeguard the property\u2019s value and put the project back on track.\u201d\nThe foreclosure complaint also named project manager, Aventura-based\nRieber Developments\n, and 13 contractors, including Coconut Grove-based Arquitectonica, which designed 1212 Aventura, that have pending liens against the property totaling nearly $1 million in allegedly unpaid work. Rieber Developments CEO Bernardo Rieber previously told\nThe Real Deal\nthat his firm and multiple other companies are owed money.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased the court entered the order,\u201d said Glen Waldman, the attorney for Rieber Developments. \u201cThings will now get attended to properly, which will benefit all parties.\u201d\nA retired Miami-Dade judge,\nFine\nhas handled receiverships in some high-profile cases involving commercial properties and development sites in foreclosure. In 2023, Fine was briefly retained by investors of defunct Coral Gables-based Location Ventures to liquidate the firm\u2019s real estate assets. The arrangement ended in early 2024 when the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Location Ventures and its founder\nRishi Kapoor\nfor allegedly defrauding investors out of $93 million. A federal judge appointed a different receiver.\nRecently, Fine was appointed as court receiver over an entity that owns a distressed development site on the Miami River currently listed for\n$18 million\n.\nAccording to Judge Rebull\u2019s order, Medical District Developments has not renewed the master building permit and temporary certificate of occupancy. As a result, no one can lawfully occupy 1212 Aventura, and the developer can\u2019t finish the project, which is 90 percent complete.\nThe assisted senior living facility, projected to generate more than $7 million in annual revenue, is not operational, and buyers of the remaining office condos are unable to close on their units, the order states.\nMeghhaa Kumaarr, a lawyer representing 17 office condo owners, said the judge\u2019s ruling is favorable to her clients.\n\u201cThis means the receiver will now be able to move forward with getting the master permit and the temporary certificate of occupancy reinstated so that they can go back into their units,\u201d Kumaarr said. \u201cOur clients have not been able to conduct their business, but they are still paying mortgages on their units. It\u2019s been very disruptive.\u201d",

        "content": "PPG Development and its partners scored $235 million to build a 728-unit multifamily project in North Miami Beach.\nThe financing package consists of a loan and a preferred equity investment. The deal comes as construction lending continues to\nflow\nin South Florida, despite elevated interest rates, skyrocketing insurance, tariffs and other headwinds.\nPPG, led by Ari Pearl, as well as Isaac Khabie of Ark Ventures and Matt Press of EquiShares, plan to start development of the Palm Aire complex with five buildings on the former Nova Southeastern University campus by month end, according to Pearl and a PPG news release. The 8-acre site is at 1750 and 1775 Northeast 167th Street.\nBDT &amp; MSD Partners provided a $205 million construction loan, the release says. Skylight Real Estate Partners and Meadow Partners, both based in New York, provided a $30 million preferred equity investment.\nAaron Kurlansky of Sheridan Capital represented the borrowers and BDT &amp; MSD. Aaron Jungreis and Alex Fuchs of Rosewood Realty Group represented the borrowers, Skylight and Meadow.\nPalm Aire will consist of two three-story buildings, two six-story buildings, an eight-story building and a pair of garages, according to Miriam Ungar of PPG. All units will be at market-rate rents.\nThe project\u2019s completion will be staggered to allow for newly finished apartments to lease-up before delivering additional units, she said. Palm Aire will include a bodega in one of the buildings.\n\nHallandale Beach-based PPG, Khabie and Press bought the development site from Dezer Development for\n$31.1 million\nin 2022. Khabie\u2019s Ark Ventures and Press\u2019 EquiShares are both based in Miami. Dezer bought the property for\n$20 million\nfrom Nova Southeastern in 2018.\nNova Southeastern still occupied a portion of the site when PPG and its partners bought it. The school\u2019s lease ran out in the summer of 2023.\nIn 2023, the developers scored approval from the city for Palm Aire, according to North Miami Beach records.\nA few projects are in the pipeline in\nNorth Miami Beach\n. Trinsic Residential Group and Macken Companies are developing the eight-story, 373-unit\nAura\nwith 17,000 square feet of ground-floor commercial space and 9,000 square feet of exterior retail space at 16955-17071 West Dixie Highway.\nAcross South Florida, developers and landlords largely have turned to\nprivate lenders\nover the past three years. Banks, which have been heavily regulated since the Great Recession, can\u2019t waver from minimum capital requirements and overextend. Amid higher interest rates, banks have had to extend maturities for some borrowers struggling to meet debt obligations, or provide other forbearance. This limits their ability to provide new capital. Alternative lenders aren\u2019t as constrained and have stepped in to fill the void, offering higher loan-to-cost ratios and more flexibility to borrowers.\nMSD &amp; BDT Partners, which was formed in 2023 from the merger of merchant bank BDT &amp; Company and MSD Partners, is among those alternative lenders. Last month, it refinanced Steve Ross\u2019\n$242.5 million\nconstruction loan for the One Flagler office tower in West Palm Beach and increased the debt by $97.5 million.\nIn June, Grover Corlew scored\n$92 million\nfrom Affinius Capital to develop a seven-story, 312-unit apartment building at 6261 Northwest Sixth Way in Fort Lauderdale\u2019s Cypress Creek area. In March, Stamford, Connecticut-based Post Road Group provided a\n$206 million\nconstruction loan for Baron Property Group\u2019s eight-story, 661-unit Metro Parc North apartment building at 901 East 26th Street in Hialeah.\n",

        "content": "Developer Michael Stern bought the development site for a planned waterfront condo tower in Miami Beach for roughly $120 million,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nStern, who is working with developer David Martin on the project, completed the\nbulk purchase\nof Bay Garden Manor at 1250 West Avenue, according to sources. Martin took an interest in the deal in late July. Stern\u2019s other partners include\nGianluca Vacchi\u2019s\nGV Development and RG Development.\nThe price includes the bulk condo purchase and the Bikini Hostel property at 1247 West Avenue, sources told\nTRD\n. Northwind Group financed the deal for an undisclosed amount.\nBay Garden Manor, a 15-story, 238-unit building, was constructed in 1964. The developer\u2019s 1250 West Ave LLC had purchased at least two dozen condos at the building prior to the latest and final batch of closings. The Stern-led partnership will eventually terminate the condo association, which is a required legal step before the developer can tear down the building.\nResidents can remain in the building for about six months, according to sources.\nJorge Betancourt, president of Bay Garden Manor\u2019s condo association, said the building began receiving offers from developers in 2021 and 2022, after the deadly Surfside condo collapse.\nCondo buyouts are notoriously difficult because developers are sometimes working with more than 100 individual owners, some of whom live in these buildings. Selling their units was \u201cunsolicited for a lot of people,\u201d Betancourt said.\n\nBetancourt noted that the cost to maintain, repair and insure the building was prohibitive for many owners. Insurance for the building increased to $800,000 in a five-year period, up from about $240,000, he said.\nDan Marinberg, an attorney and broker, brokered the Bay Garden Manor deal. Marinberg, who sold five units himself to the developers, said he\u2019s working with six other condo buildings in South Florida that are considering selling in bulk to developers.\n\u201cCondo buyouts like this deal are exceedingly rare because of what a successful deal requires \u2014 critical legal analysis, proper location, proper zoning, the right buyer and willing sellers,\u201d Marinberg said in a statement.\nJDS and its partners secured a\ncontentious approval this summer\nfrom the Miami Beach City Commission that will allow for a taller and slimmer tower on the bayfront West Avenue site, which is next to Monad Terrace. JDS and partners developed Monad Terrace, a luxury condo project that was designed by French architect Jean Nouvel.\nThe new building at 1250 West Avenue can be up to 330 feet tall, more than double the height allowed as of right. But a reduction in density brings the maximum number of condos to 125 units from 286 allowed by right.\nThe JDS-led venture will redevelop Bikini Hostel across the street as part of a public benefits package it\u2019s providing to the city. Stern has declined to disclose the purchase price for Bikini Hostel, but sources said it was about $20 million.\nThe Miami Beach commission granted final approvals to the development agreement and zoning amendments at a special meeting in late June. At the same meeting, Martin also secured an upzoning for the\nDeauville Beach Resort\nproperty at 6701 Collins Avenue. Martin is a 25 percent owner of that property; the controversial Meruelo family holds the majority interest.\n",

It\u2019s been two years since New York-based SB Development and New York-based Hazelton\nlaunched sales\nfor the 40-story, 134-unit tower planned at 456, 480 and 496 Northeast 29th Street in Miami.\nCove Miami\u2019s units will have one to four bedrooms, according to the project\u2019s website. Amenities will include a pool, fitness center, spa facilities, theater, library,\nprivate dining room\n, pet spa and a co-working space, the release shows. The design team includes Kobi Karp Architecture &amp; Interior Design and Buenos Aires-based Dieguez Fridman.\nPrices for Cove Miami\u2019s units range from $900,000 to $4 million, and the project is between 30 percent and 40 percent presold, SB Development co-founder Joseph Stern confirmed. The developers tapped Peggy Olin\u2019s OneWorld Properties to lead sales.\n\nConstruction is slated to be completed in 2028, Stern said. The buyer demographic is primarily foreign investors and local end users, he added.\nHigher interest rates meant a more challenging environment for landing a construction loan.\n\u201cIt certainly wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d Stern said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a way.\u201d\nCove Miami\u2019s site is adjacent to Terra and One Thousand Group\u2019s planned\nVilla Miami\n, a Major Food Group-branded tower with 56 stories and 70 units.\nCove Miami and Villa Miami are just two of the many\nprojects in the pipeline\nin Miami\u2019s\nEdgewater\nneighborhood.

        "content": "Waterton Residential sold a 427-unit apartment complex in West Miami for $111 million, marking a 4.7 percent discount from its purchase price nearly a decade ago.\nChevy Chase, Maryland-based FCP, or Federal Capital Partners, bought District West Gables, consisting of a pair of seven-story buildings at 2001 and 2101 Ludlam Road/Southwest 67th Avenue, from Chicago-based Waterton, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The deal breaks down to $259,953 per unit.\nWaterton, led by CEO David Schwartz, had paid $116.4 million for the complex in two deals in 2016 and 2017, records show. The firm bought the 206-unit building at 2101 Ludlam Road for\n$57.4 million\nin 2016, about a year after South Miami-based multifamily developer Estate Companies completed construction, according to records. In 2017, Estate completed the building at 2001 Ludlam Road, selling it that year to Waterton for $59 million.\nEstate, led by Robert Suris and Jeff Ardizon, developed the complex under its Soleste multifamily brand.\nOn a 4.1-acre site, District West Gables consists of studios and one-bedroom to three-bedroom apartments, property records and\nApartments.com\nshow. Asking rents aren\u2019t listed.\nFCP\u2019s District West Gables purchase marks its third South Florida multifamily investment in less than a year. In December, the firm paid\n$67.5 million\nfor the 250-unit Solena Miramar complex at 3155 Southwest 147th Terrace in Miramar. FCP also bought the 400-unit Arium Sunrise complex at 1501 Northwest 124th Terrace in Sunrise for\n$90 million\nin February.\nFCP\n, led by CEO Garland Faist, has invested and financed more than $14.6 billion in residential and commercial properties nationwide since it was founded in 1999, according to its website. It\u2019s currently managing six funds with a total of $4.2 billion in assets.\n\nAt District West Gables, FCP plans renovations to common areas, amenities and apartments, according to the firm\u2019s news release announcing the purchase. FCP hired Greystar to manage the property. Records show FCP didn\u2019t record a mortgage, likely signifying its District West Gables purchase was all cash.\nThe discounted sale comes amid a calmer South Florida\nmultifamily market\ncompared with the bonanza during the pandemic. Over the past two years, elevated interest rates, a supply overhang due to a development frenzy and other headwinds have slowed investment sales and prompted a flatlining \u2013\u2013 and even\ndeclining\n\u2013\u2013 in rents.\nDevelopers completed a record\n18,600 apartments\nlast year, outpacing 15,000 net leases signed, according to CoStar data.\nSales have shown an uptick in recent months. Investors buying apartments largely are finding\nworkarounds\nto bank financing by purchasing with all cash, using Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae loans or assuming sellers\u2019 loans.\nSpanish billionaire Amancio Ortega, known for purchasing with all cash, paid\n$165 million\nfor the 44-story, 259-unit Veneto Las Olas apartment tower at 201 South Federal Highway in Fort Lauderdale in June.\nLast month, Related Fund Management borrowed a $59.1 million Freddie Mac loan for its\n$116.9 million\npurchase of the 292-unit Aura Delray Beach complex at 2095 West Atlantic Avenue in Delray Beach.\nAlso last month, The Milestone Group paid\n$46.4 million\nfor the 206-unit Casa Brera at Toscana Isles at 4725 Via Bari in unincorporated Palm Beach County, near Boynton Beach. The buyer assumed the seller\u2019s $27.4 million Fannie Mae loan on the property and borrowed an additional $7.7 million Fannie Mae loan.\n",

        "content": "When Alirio Torrealba got started in the real estate business in South Florida, he had neither experience in development nor proficiency in English. He somehow still led the wave of new townhome and condo development in Coral Gables, before expanding into multifamily.\nJust a decade after its founding, his Coral Gables-based\nMG Developer\nis sitting on a project pipeline of more than $500 million, which stretches into Hialeah, Miami, Doral and North Bay Village.\nTorrealba has veered into a faster lane at the same time that South Florida\u2019s real estate industry is experiencing headwinds. The\nmultifamily\nand\ncondo\nmarkets are cooling after several years of frenzied activity. Competition, especially in places like\nNorth Bay Village\n, is intense, and rising interest rates and construction costs have derailed several planned developments in greater Miami.\nTorrealba, who can now speak English but is still more comfortable in his native tongue, knows he\u2019ll face hurdles, and he\u2019s figuring out how to pace his projects to reflect the possible downturn.\n\u201cThere will come a point when we will slow down our growth, and stabilize what we have so that every project can cross the finish line,\u201d Torrealba said during a recent interview at MG Developer\u2019s headquarters.\nI\nnside MG\u2019s portfolio\nWhen Matthew Baron was getting to know Alirio Torrealba in 2019, their meetings were like summits between world leaders who don\u2019t speak the same language. But the two developers saw eye-to-eye about a multifamily project in South Florida they were partnering on, the first for both.\nTorrealba, a Venezuelan-born builder who leads MG Developer, would deliver monologues in Spanish that his eldest son Diego or one of his attorneys would translate, Baron recalls.\n\u201cAnd I\u2019d be like, \u2018I was thinking the exact same thing,\u2019\u201d Baron said. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t have an issue communicating. We both brought things to the table that the other one didn\u2019t have.\u201d\nEarlier this year, Baron\u2019s New York-based firm, Baron Property Group and MG Developer opened Metro Parc, a 10-story apartment building with 559 units in Hialeah, one of the largest new multifamily developments in the second-largest city in Miami-Dade County.\n\u201cWe finished a month ahead of schedule,\u201d Baron said. \u201cWe had about $1 million in contingency money left over.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you are doing predevelopment, you start seeing the magnitude of the pipeline.\u201d\nAlirio Torrealba\nCo-developing\nMetro Parc\nallowed Torrealba, who spent most of his young adulthood running car dealerships, to step outside his comfort zone in Coral Gables, where MG Developer spent its early years of existence building townhome and boutique condo projects.\n\u201cNow MG Developer has large-scale rental development experience under [its] belt,\u201d Baron said. \u201cI think that\u2019s fantastic for [Torrealba and his team\u2019s] track record and their confidence.\u201d\nIn the wake of Metro Parc, MG Developer is pressing the throttle, launching a pipeline of six major projects, equal to the number completed in the company\u2019s first decade.\nTorrealba is planning 225 condo units and 1,157 apartments in separate developments across five cities, including a 340-foot waterfront mixed-use tower planned for North Bay Village \u2014 where heavyweights like Bruce Eichner, Shoma Group and the Ansin family\u2019s Sunbeam Properties are planning luxury condominiums.\n\u201cWhen you are doing predevelopment, you start seeing the magnitude of the pipeline,\u201d he said.\nF\nrom car dealer to developer\nIn 1990, when he was 20, Torrealba launched a used car dealership in his home city of Caracas that he steadily expanded into 14 showrooms, signing deals with major car brands like Kia and Fiat. By the late 2000s, Torrealba left Venezuela due to the political instability brought on by the socialist dictatorships of Hugo Chavez and Nicholas Maduro. He resettled in Puerto Rico where he established the island\u2019s first Kia dealership.\n\nIn 2013, he shuttled between Puerto Rico and Coral Gables where he joined a small circle of friends buying and selling single-family homes in the city. Two years later, he was offered a development site in Coral Gables, and he became a fulltime builder. \u201cI decided to leave car sales and dedicate myself 100 percent to real estate development,\u201d Torrealba told The Real Deal. \u201cI recruited people who could help me move forward and build the company.\u201d\nBut breaking into Miami\u2019s real estate game was tough.\n\u201cBanks didn\u2019t really have any appetite to finance a group with no track record,\u201d Torrealba admitted. \u201cThrough banking relationships that local lawyers and consultants working with us had, we were able to obtain credit. We experienced some bumps.\u201d\nTorrealba\u2019s firm started small with 444 Valencia Avenue, a seven-townhome project, and Biltmore Parc, a 32-unit condominium, that were both completed in 2017. The same year, MG Developer sold all the Valencia Avenue units for between $1.5 million and $2.2 million, records show. At the seven-story Biltmore Parc, prices ranged from $1.2 million to $2 million.\nBanks didn\u2019t really have any appetite to finance a group with no track record. We experienced some bumps.\nTo attract buyers, MG Developer tried some novel approaches. Torrealba would offer free one-year memberships to the private club at Coral Gables\u2019 historic Biltmore Hotel, or allow buyers to move in with only\n10 percent deposits\nand a year\u2019s time to close on purchases.\nBetween 2018 and 2021, MG Developer completed two more townhome projects. This year, the firm finished The Village of Coral Gables, a 2.6-acre community with 48 duplexes, townhomes, lofts and condos.\nDuring MG Developer\u2019s initial wave in Coral Gables, before the pandemic led to skyrocketing prices for South Florida residential properties, single-family homes were going for $500,000 in the city, Torrealba says. \u201cWe started price points that didn\u2019t exist,\u201d Torrealba said. \u201cWe used our own completed projects as comparables for the new ones.\u201d\nR\nacing into\no\nther submarkets\nTorrealba\u2019s move into multifamily came with Metro Parc in Hialeah. MG Developer\u2019s partner Baron Property Group was seeking a foothold in Miami-Dade County but lacked the local connections to identify viable development sites and untapped submarkets, and to navigate local governmental bureaucracies.\n\u201cMG Developer didn\u2019t have a track record developing large-scale buildings,\u201d Baron told\nTRD\n. \u201cBut we toured a bunch of their projects\u2014they were building very high-quality buildings, just not at scale.\u201d\nThe match worked: Baron brought large-development and financial heft, Torrealba supplied local knowledge and attention to high-quality construction. Metro Parc exceeded early expectations.\nBut one successful deal in an emerging market doesn\u2019t necessarily signal smooth sailing ahead.\nRecently, the joint venture parted ways on co-developing two more multifamily projects. In December, Baron Property Group bought MG Developer\u2019s 50 percent interest in Merrick Parc, a planned two-tower complex with 806 apartments in Coral Gables, and Metro Parc North, a planned 10-story building with 620 units in Hialeah, adjacent to the joint venture\u2019s recently completed project.\nThe split was due to MG Developer making a \u201cstrategic shift\u201d in its pipeline, Torrealba explained.\nBut Torrealba and Baron remain on good terms.\n\u201cI think they\u2019ll face many of the same challenges anybody else would face,\u201d Baron said. \u201cBut having gotten to know Alirio\u2019s mindset, they are going to execute at a high level.\u201d\nMG Developer started with a staff of eight people and now has two dozen employees, including Torrealba\u2019s adult sons who joined the firm, setting up a line of succession. And MG Developer is having an easier time landing financing for its upcoming projects. For instance, Scale Lending recently provided a\n$105 million\nconstruction loan for MG Developer\u2019s Metro Parc South, a planned 10-story building with 347 apartments that is also near the first Metro Parc project.\nTorrealba acknowledges that South Florida\u2019s development landscape is unpredictable, and market shifts will determine success or setbacks.\n\u201cThe market is constantly changing and evolving,\u201d Torrealba said. \u201cIt can be going great and then all of sudden things will stop. But there is still a lot of appetite for investing in Miami. That keeps us motivated.\u201d",

        "content": "Two hours cruising Sag Harbor Bay on a sunny August afternoon has an intoxicating effect. Thinking gets bigger, dreamier.\n\u201cI would like for Margit to be the No. 1 agent in the world,\u201d Blair Brandt said.\nFor most, this would be magical thinking, but Blair is plain about his ambitions for his wife, Margit Brandt. From her perch on the deck, she nods in agreement with Blair, calculating how many $20 million homes she would need to sell in a year to take the crown.\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d they both conclude.\nIn the span of a decade, Margit, 37, has ascended from fledgling agent to one of the top brokers in America\u2019s biggest trophy market: Palm Beach.\nSince joining her current brokerage, Premier Estate Properties, in 2022, she has closed more than $1 billion in sales, including $350 million so far this year, and is preparing to open her own Serena &amp; Lilly-designed office on Palm Beach\u2019s Bankers Row. She placed fifth in The Real Deal\u2019s 2024 Palm Beach County broker ranking with $319.3 million in on-market sales. She represented Australian billionaire Michael Dorrell in his $150 million purchase of Tarpon Island, a private island in Palm Beach and Florida\u2019s most expensive home sale in 2024.\nAfter the private island, she brought the buyer to the $42.5 million mansion at 101 Jungle Road and landed the listing for a trophy estate at 1140 South Ocean Boulevard in Manalapan. She represented WeatherTech founder David MacNeil when he bought it for $55.5 million in May. She declined to comment on her clients for this story.\n\u201cShe really is a shark under cover,\u201d Miss Florida USA Lou Schieffelin, Margit\u2019s showing assistant, said.\nMargit and Blair are part of a fresh generation of Palm Beachers bringing down the average age of an island long joked of as \u201cGod\u2019s waiting room,\u201d and raising their young families there. They are also fixtures in the Winter White House scene. President Donald Trump is a client; the Brandts are GOP boosters and Mar-a-Lago members. She had the rental listing for 1125 South Ocean Boulevard in 2023, when the president\nwas asking $195,000 per month\nfor the oceanfront mansion. She doesn\u2019t comment on her relationship with the president aside to confirm that yes, she is the dealmaker-in-chief\u2019s dealmaker.\nTheir dynamic is that of starlet and manager \u2014 she performs, he sets the stage.\nA native New Yorker who married into Palm Beach, she has a keen understanding that her lifestyle is the aspiration she sells to other recent arrivals. In a new era for Palm Beach, with new money, new people and new energy, Margit, immersed in this zeitgeist, has disrupted the old guard in a place where the same circle of agents have held the keys to the kingdom for decades.\n\u201cShe just knows all the right people,\u201d Daniel Heider, a top agent with TTR Sotheby\u2019s International Realty and Margit\u2019s referral partner in Washington, D.C., said. Should a client need an 8 p.m. reservation at Le Bilboquet in the height of season \u2014 she knows whom to call. \u201cThere\u2019s a regular line, a VIP line and V-V-VIP line, which Margit has.\u201d\nThat doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s been readily welcomed into the inner circle. It\u2019s a market where agents have generational roots.\n\u201cHer mother wasn\u2019t a real estate agent in Palm Beach for generations,\u201d Heider said. \u201cThere are agents down there who are into the art world and relatives of Lilly Pulitzer.\u201d\nIt\u2019s always been catty and competitive among Palm Beach agents, and Margit openly jokes about her \u201chaters.\u201d But none would register their disdain on the record.\n\u201cHow much did they have to pay for that?\u201d was the common snark in response to requests for comment for this profile.\nT\nhe duo\nIt is difficult to picture any nasty business as I decamp from a crowded Thursday morning jitney onto Sag Harbor\u2019s Main Street. At the village docks I find Rivalry, a Daychaser 48 with darkly stained woodwork and navy upholstered seating.\nMargit and Blair are in their element, sipping sparkling waters and pointing out friends\u2019 boats docked at the Sag Harbor Yacht Club. She is tall, slim, deeply tanned, with highlighted hair and, per usual, wearing a sundress. Blair wears an Amber Waves trucker hat \u2014 Hamptons in-crowd merch.\nHe is both her husband and her chief brand officer. They can appear of the same mind at times, practically finishing each other\u2019s sentences. As a couple, they are uncommonly in sync.\nThe sun shining overheard, Rivalry cuts west through the glittering water as the pair rattles off the owners of the waterfront estates as they pass by: \u201cHe founded Blade.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s Jimmy Buffett\u2019s place.\u201d \u201cThey host great parties.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s Jeff Greene\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s 55 acres.\u201d\nThis is how their day would go in Palm Beach in season, the Brandts cruising with clients to listings, reciting from memory the owners, architects and price per square foot of every home along the Intracoastal Waterway. Their lives follow the migratory pattern of America\u2019s East Coast affluent: They live in Palm Beach full-time but fly north for July and August, when it is too hot for people to buy houses in Palm Beach.\nThey rent in  East Hampton and hatch a strategy for the upcoming busy period. Blair takes charge of marketing efforts and backend organization; Margit is the dealmaker.\n\u201cShe\u2019s the product,\u201d he said. \u201cShe deals with the clients, she does the house tours, she does the real estate transactions.\u201d\nTheir dynamic is that of starlet and manager \u2014 she performs, he sets the stage \u2014 or TV news anchor and trusted producer.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re watching Sean Hannity,\u201d Blair said. \u201cHe\u2019s the one that\u2019s there, but there\u2019s 20 people behind the camera.\u201d\nM\nade in New York\nA fresh-faced, non-blonded Margit smiles into the camera.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with high-end clients, you have to do whatever it takes to sell,\u201d she says.\nIt is the opening line of her intro on \u201cNext Step Realty: NYC,\u201d a 2015 ABC Family reality show fated to a one-season run.\nMargit, who is from New York, was barely two years into her real estate career at the time.\n\u201cI went to New York City public school and somehow made it to Palm Beach,\u201d she said, her tone conveying pleasantly surprised disbelief.\n\nShe was born on the Upper East Side. Her father had grown up in Throggs Neck in the Bronx, earned an MBA at Wharton and went into accounting with Arthur Young and Company, a precursor to Ernst &amp; Young, according to his obituary. They lived on East 79th and York, and she went to grade school at P.S. 158, spending time in Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum.\nLater, the family moved to Westchester, and Margit had a suburban adolescence of afterschool sports and lifeguarding gigs. Unlike her Palm Beach-raised children, she did not play racquet sports or golf, nor did she use seasons as verbs.\n\u201cHow much did they have to pay for that?\u201d\nthe snark TRD got in response to requests for comment about the Brandts\nHer grandmother was a real estate agent in Westchester, but she had no early inclination toward real estate. She was always finding ways to make money, though. At 9 years old, she convinced a neighbor she was a qualified dog sitter.\n\u201cI somehow made $3,000 that summer watching this French lady\u2019s dogs,\u201d she recalled, laughing. It was her first big payday.\nAfter graduating from UNC Wilmington in 2010, she headed to San Diego, thinking a career in public relations would be fun and glamorous. But the celebrities and earning potential underwhelmed her, and she returned home to New York City.\nShe thought she\u2019d give real estate a try. She got licensed, landing her first gig as an assistant with the Corcoran Group, before a friend recommended she interview with Next Step Realty. There she met Blair, who co-founded the firm.\nBlair is a Palm Beach kid. He grew up on the island, and went to Palm Beach Day School before being shipped off to Deerfield Academy. His great-grandfather founded a New York City movie theater dynasty. The Brandt brothers, Bernard, Louis, William and Harry, founded a namesake chain in 1930 and grew it to 150 locations. Among those was a prime stretch of movie theaters on West 42nd Street in Times Square: the Selwyn, Apollo, Times Square, Lyric, Victory, Empire and Liberty. They suffered in the blight of the 1970s and 1980s, and in 1989 the Durst Organization bought them for $3 million, the\nNew York Daily News\nreported at the time.\n(\u201cNever sell,\u201d Margit says on the boat as we glide past Shelter Island. She currently has the $24 million listing for\nDouglas Durst\u2019s Palm Beach estate\n.)\nAs Blair puts it, his family made money but no one figured out how to \u201cmake it stick.\u201d He knew he had to make his own way when he graduated from the University of Richmond in 2010. He had interned for Christian Angle, who has long been one of Palm Beach\u2019s top agents, and after seeing college friends struggle to find apartments in New York, he got the idea for Next Step.\nIt focuses on tenant representation for affluent college graduates and early-career professionals \u2014 20-somethings with their parents\u2019 money. He interviewed Margit in February of 2014.\n\u201cI think our interview lasted like three hours,\u201d said Blair.\nMargit hopped to Next Step and the pair started dating, a fact that was featured prominently in the 10 episodes of the show. She quickly emerged as the firm\u2019s top agent and started working on corporate relocations in addition to helping her post-grad clients.\n\u201cI look back and it was almost the best practice I could have had,\u201d Margit said. She was too young to be taken seriously by the clientele she serves today, but she could cut her teeth finding their children apartments. She refers to her time at Next Step as a \u201cbootcamp\u201d in learning how to work for the ultra wealthy.\n\u201cOften the real clients were the parents. The kids were there, but they weren\u2019t writing all the checks themselves or choosing the place themselves,\u201d Blair said. \u201cShe\u2019d have guarantors who were making $25 million a year.\u201d\nMargit and Blair got married. Things were going well in New York, but Margit wasn\u2019t interested in raising a family on the Upper East Side.\n\u201cShe was kind of at a fork in the road with her real estate business,\u201d Blair said. \u201cI basically just pulled the trigger, shepherded us down here and said, \u2018We\u2019re going to live here and you\u2019re going to launch your real estate business here.\u2019\u201d\nMargit, for her part, said, \u201cI was an easy sell.\u201d\nR\nising with the tides\nWhen they arrived, she was 28 and a new mom. She got to work studying the territory.\n\u201cI would ride my bike up and down each street, memorizing the names,\u201d Margit said, remembering the sweltering heat.\nShe got her Florida license in 2019 and hung it with Brown Harris Stevens, but business was slow.\n\u201cI heard a lot of no\u2019s,\u201d she said. She had her real estate chops but wasn\u2019t a tested Palm Beach agent. Still, she made progress as a buyer\u2019s rep. When the pandemic triggered a massive wealth migration to the island, she found her deal flow.\nIn April of 2021, she represented buyers Joseph Taylor and Hilary Budny in their purchase of the Todd Glaser-developed spec home at 259 Pendleton Avenue for $17.5 million. Three months later, she represented them again when they sold it for $18.4 million. That same year, she represented Boston multifamily developer Bruce Percelay in his $4.5 million purchase of the lot at 261 Nightingale Trail. In 2022, she had the listing when he sold the completed spec home\nfor $16 million\n.\nShattering price records became the norm. Savvy buyers doubled their money in six-month flips. Deals begot more, bigger deals. It was a good time to be selling South Florida.\n\u201cBoth her and my ascension are certainly also tied to our marketplaces seeing pricepoints like they\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Dina Goldentayer, Douglas Elliman\u2019s No. 1 individual agent and a savant of Miami Beach home sales, said. She\u2019s also a friend of Margit\u2019s.\n\u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t hurt that she got a $150 million sale under her belt,\u201d Goldentayer added, referring to the Dorrell deal on Tarpon Island. \u201cIt\u2019s only going one way after that, and it\u2019s up. Big sales lead to more big sales.\u201d\nBringing the buyer for Tarpon did open new doors.\nIn Palm Beach, where people follow local real estate the way small towns in Texas follow high school football, locals started looking at her as a star prospect. Tony Beyer, a client and head of investment firm Poinciana Capital Partners, tapped her to list his house after tracking her career for years.\n\u201cI admire people\u2019s success, and she did it on her own. She wasn\u2019t carving off members from this club or that club,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was hard work.\u201d\nAs Rivalry cruises past the megayachts of friends and acquaintances, Margit is enjoying the fruits of her labor.\nBut the captain is steering us back toward land, where grandiose dreams concocted at sea hit pavement. Summer is waning, and Palm Beach\u2019s busy season is approaching. There is much talk that the election of Zohran Mamdani to the New York City mayorship will spur another wave of wealth migration to the island, and Margit has already gotten calls from nervous Manhattanites. She expects a busy season ahead.\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to get back,\u201d she said.",

        "content": "The line to register at the Real Estate Expo Argentina, a two-day conference at the Hilton in Buenos Aires, stretches around the property, probably 300 feet, the biggest turnout Fortune International Group CEO Edgardo Defortuna has ever seen there.\nDefortuna, a native Argentinian, was among the crowd at the expo, along with a brigade of South Florida real estate brokers and developers armed with branded tote bags and glossy brochures of the sleek condo towers they are selling. Usually there are 15,000 attendees; Defortuna said this year had double the turnout.\n\u201cArgentina is doing well, politically and economically. People are very interested in taking money out because they have lived through these good periods before and they know they need to diversify,\u201d Defortuna said.\nBut the event is just one stop on Fortune\u2019s 12-month travel schedule. Brokers, developers and members of trade groups like the Miami Association of Realtors, attend these expos to connect with agents and their international clients who are attracted to the promise of sun, safety and assets backed by the dollar. Similar scenes play out from Mexico City to Bogot\u00e1 and London to Turkey. Funding for the trips typically comes from a project\u2019s sales and marketing budget.\nWith higher interest rates, a tighter pool of American buyers and slowing sales, developers are returning to Miami\u2019s development playbook from the early 2000s and 2010s, when\nforeign capital\n, especially from Latin America, propped up waves of construction.\n\u201cFor a very long time in Miami, the Latin American buyer represented probably 70 to 80 percent of the buyers, but that shifted years ago,\u201d Sharon Novotny, a senior vice president of development marketing at Douglas Elliman, said. Blame the Yankees: \u201cBecause of the influx of that Northeastern buyer, and domestic in general, those numbers changed.\u201d\nMeanwhile, buyers from Mexico and Latin America fell off as the dollar\u2019s value grew, in part because their purchasing power declined.\nBut they didn\u2019t disappear entirely, and brokers have been working on rebuilding their ties to existing foreign buyer pools while also tapping into new ones, in Europe and beyond. Brokers hope they can fill the pipeline for preconstruction projects in particular.\nThe\ncondo market in South Florida is divided\ninto a few segments: older inventory, existing condos under 30 years old, and preconstruction. The older condos are struggling the most, in part because of increased regulations, a reaction to the deadly Surfside condo collapse in 2021.\nBut preconstruction has slowed too, according to Craig Studnicky, CEO of Aventura-based brokerage firm ISG World, especially in the last year. He blames this on the American buyer not wanting to wait for the four, five or six years it takes to complete a tower.\n\u201cOnly about half of the projects [in the pipeline] have broken ground,\u201d he said. \u201cLatin Americans like to send money every month. They\u2019ll send you $20,000 a month for the next four years. When Americans look at the delivery dates, they back off.\u201d\nAlso, there are just too many\ncondo-hotels in Miami\n, which had been a favorite for Latin American buyers until the market got oversaturated.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just too much inventory of short-term rental [friendly] condos,\u201d Studnicky said. \u201cAlmost 14,000 of them are in development since Covid.\u201d\nM\narketing the mission\nA June 5 New York Times article really galled Alicia Cervera Lamadrid, managing partner of her family\u2019s brokerage firm, Cervera Real Estate.\nIts headline: \u201cForeign Buyers Are Fleeing the South Florida Condo Market.\u201d\n\u201cI looked at it and I thought this is the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve read in a long time,\u201d Cervera, who\u2019d like to flip the narrative that international investors have left the Miami market, said. She rattles off a list of countries from which buyers are flocking to Miami: Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Colombia, Argentina, Mexico, Turkey, Spain, Brazil, Ecuador, Chile.\nThe Times\u2019 story referred to a Miami Association of Realtors\u2019 report that found home sales to foreign buyers fell to 10 percent of all transactions in the tri-county region between August 2023 and July 2024, the lowest share since 2015. That report was a survey of nearly 2,400 real estate agents in Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Martin counties.\nBut new developments, where the\ninternational investor\nhad a bigger presence, likely weren\u2019t included.\n\u201cLatin Americans like to send money every month. They\u2019ll send you $20,000 a month for the next four years. When Americans look at the delivery dates, they back off.\u201d\nCraig Studnicky, ISG World\nAt Okan Tower, a Hilton-branded hotel-condo tower under construction in downtown Miami, Turkish developer Okan Group has locked in contracts to buyers across Latin America, in Mexico, Spain and Turkey. Of the international sales, nearly a quarter are to Mexican buyers, a spokesperson said. The second-biggest foreign buyer pool hails from Colombia. Fortune is leading sales.\nDefortuna said that he\u2019s seeing projects attract buyers from the usual suspects: Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Colombia. That\u2019s especially helpful in the summer months, which are slow for American buyers.\n\u201cCertainly, the urgency from the U.S. market to move to South Florida has slowed down,\u201d Defortuna said.\n\nThis summer, Cervera\u2019s sales team locked in 77 signed contracts at Ricardo Dunin\u2019s two condo-hotel projects in Brickell, Domus Brickell Park and Domus Brickell Center. The average price of the units sold is $584,000. Nearly two thirds of these buyers is international, and most are Latin American, Dunin said.\nCervera and other brokerage heads joined forces with the Miami Association of Realtors to put out a new report, one tracking new development presales. Cervera, ISG, PMG, Serhant and One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty contributed sales information from their projects \u2014 a total of 9,115 condos \u2014 and found that about half of the roughly 5,500 presold units in their new construction pipeline are being purchased by foreign buyers.\nThis report relies on information provided by the developers and their sales team because preconstruction sales aren\u2019t public record, so its results should be taken with a grain of salt.\nStill, most brokers tell a similar story of heightened interest from international crowds, including Daniel de la Vega, CEO of One Sotheby\u2019s, who points to Colombian buyers pulling big numbers.\nIn addition to Mexico and Latin America, One Sotheby\u2019s is targeting London, Italy and Turkey, he said. During Wimbledon, the brokerage promoted projects that included Ponce Park Residences, Surf Row Residences, the Standard Residences, Brickell, and the Dolce &amp; Gabbana-branded 888 Brickell.\nSales overall are slower but steady, de la Vega said. He travels around the world and said he finds events targeting buyers more effective than those held for brokers.\n\u201cThe high-end market is still performing very, very well,\u201d de la Vega said.\nA\ncross the Atlantic\nWhile the typical South American buyer concentrates on the lower-price-point developments in urban cores, the European, Middle Eastern and British buyers go for higher-end condos, said Compass agent Miltiadis Kastanis.\nThis is good for developers, as there\u2019s been a shift toward smaller projects that have pricier units and the potential for more upside. For them, it makes sense to spend money to send teams to sell in London, especially now that the British pound buys you double the space in Miami as at home, according to Michael Patrizio, a managing director at Mast Capital.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of the wealth in the U.K. is looking in two directions: Florida or Dubai,\u201d Patrizio said. Of Mast\u2019s contracts at the Perigon Residences, a luxury condo building it\u2019s developing with Starwood Capital Group, more than a third of the international deals are to U.K. buyers. And 15 percent of the contracts signed at Mast\u2019s Cipriani Residences in Brickell are to European buyers, Patrizio said.\nDamac Properties, the Dubai developer that plans the ultra-luxury Delmore Residences on the site of the deadly Surfside condo collapse, and Douglas Elliman, its brokerage, have held events abroad in London and Spain to target ultra-high-net-worth buyers. That strategy is particularly important for the Delmore, where local and Latin American buyers may still associate the site with tragedy.\nNovotny said Elliman is planning a private launch event in Germany later this year to unveil The Cloud One Hotel &amp; Residences Wynwood, a condo project led by German developers Sebastian L\u00fcdke of ALP.X Group, Motel One and Ralf B\u00fcschl of the B\u00fcschl Group.\n\u201cWe have not even launched our penthouse collection and we already have a couple of Germans interested,\u201d Novotny said. \u201cThe big driver is there\u2019s this shift in seeing New York as the gateway [to the U.S.]. They\u2019re starting to see Miami as the gateway.\u201d\nH\nesitations\nStill, buyers won\u2019t sign contracts on the spot. The bigger the price point, the longer a deal takes to materialize.\nAnd some European and Latin American buyers are taking a beat before pulling the trigger on a purchase because of President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies. Julian Johnston, a top agent with the Corcoran Group, pointed to Canadians\u2019 exit from the market as a potential deal killer. (Earlier this year, Related Group CEO Jon Paul P\u00e9rez said Trump\u2019s tariffs on Canada killed prospective sales at a project in Pompano Beach to about 10 Canadian buyers.)\nThe perception of what\u2019s happening in the U.S, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s raids in June and Trump\u2019s tariffs, has also reached European clients.\nJohnston has a French client who wants to relocate because he feels Paris is too dangerous. But, \u201che wants to see what happens with Trump. He doesn\u2019t like the uncertainty,\u201d Johnston said.\nThe president is \u201cin a massive brawl with Brazil\u201d and the middle class, \u201cthe people who spend money here in the winter time, they care,\u201d Johnston added.\nWhile his wealthy clients are less concerned with having issues securing visas, their house staff could have a harder time. The ICE raids \u201ccaused a lot of hesitancy,\u201d Studnicky said, though it hasn\u2019t so far stopped international buyers from signing contracts.\nDefortuna said the foreign buyers his firm works with are already familiar with the visa process.\nMost brokers said Trump\u2019s policies have had little effect on international buyers, as people in these countries are used to political instability. They just want a safe place to park their cash.\n\u201cIt\u2019s culturally comfortable with Latin Americans to have these conversations,\u201d said Mast\u2019s Patrizio.",

        "content": "The 2028 Olympics might be three years away, but wealthy tourists and other Olympic-affiliated visitors have already made arrangements for their stay in Los Angeles.\nLuxury vacation rental companies LuxJB and Nightfall Group have been fielding questions \u2014 and reservations \u2014 for mansions in L.A.\u2019s ritziest neighborhoods for the international sporting event, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\nLuxJB, for example, is already getting \u201cfive to 10 inquiries per week,\u201d founder Hank Stark told the Times. \u201cThere are only so many homes of this size in L.A., and people want to secure their spot as early as possible,\u201d he said.\nThe Beverly Hills-based firm owns 14 mansions across Los Angeles, including homes in Beverly Hills, the Hollywood Hills and West Hollywood. Three have already been locked down for the Olympics, though the rentals aren\u2019t just for the two weeks of July 2028 when the Games will be taking place, according to the Times.\nInstead, interested parties have claimed their spot for most of the year. One client, for example, has rented out a 39,000-square-foot mansion with nine bedrooms, four kitchens, a gym, a spa, a movie theater, a pickleball court, a basketball court and a team of three maids from January to August 2028. The price tag: $300,000 per month, or a $2.4 million total stay.\nUtilities are covered as part of the cost, which could provide some reprieve, as they\u2019re usually about $25,000 per month including heating the pool. LuxJB\u2019s listings start at $1,900 per night for smaller five-bedroom villas and reach up to $150,000 per month for larger mansions.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re an Olympic federation from a specific country, you\u2019ll be here all year training athletes before the Games begin,\u201d Stark said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a major sports brand, you\u2019ll want a presence in L.A. before and after July.\u201d\n\nLuxJB is currently in talks with two Olympic committees looking for a large enough space to hold news conferences and host media outlets, as well as U.S. firms looking to book places to stay for executives.\nNightfall Group, which rents out homes on behalf of owners, has similarly been fielding interest from high-end clients, founder Mokhtar Jabli told the Times. So far, it\u2019s already booked one client for a 10,000-square-foot home in the Hollywood Hills complete with six bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, a movie theater and an infinity pool.\nThe guest is coughing up $160,000 for the month of July 2028.\n\u201cThat house rents for around $110,000 during a typical year, but they paid a premium to book it so far in advance,\u201d Jabli said. Most Nightfall homes start around $50,000 per month, but the company also offers customers concierge services, with some clients paying $500,000 per month for add-ons like private jets, yacht rentals, security guards, drivers, chefs and housekeepers.\nPrices are expected to climb as July 2028 gets closer, though by how much remains to be seen.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

LVMH has also submitted plans to build a large new Louis Vuitton store and adjacent campus designed by architect Frank Gehry.\nThe Paris-based giant is growing its presence on Rodeo Drive, spending more than $900 million on 12 leased or own stores on the ritzy shopping corridor. Among those moves is a forthcoming three-story Bvlgari store opening next month.\nLVMH bought the 80-room Luxe Rodeo Drive Hotel \u2014 the only hotel on the high-end street \u2014 in 2021 for $200 million. Plans filed with the city of Beverly Hills call for a three-story building on Rodeo Drive spanning 30,466 square feet including a rooftop indoor-outdoor space. The French company is in the process of renovating all of its Tiffany stores.\n\nA block away from the future Tiffany site, LVMH is pivoting from its previous plans to build a Cheval Blanc hotel, which\nvoters rejected in 2023\n. Instead, it\u2019s opting for a new Louis Vuitton outpost at 456-458 North Rodeo Drive, which would be the company\u2019s largest project yet in Beverly Hills. A Louis Vuitton store is a few doors down at 420 North Rodeo Drive. LVMH spent $465 million for the new site and $122 million for the current Louis Vuitton location.\nThe\nplans for Louis Vuitton\ncall for about 100,000 square feet across two buildings connected by pedestrian bridges and an underground tunnel, according to an application filed with the Beverly Hills Planning Commission. LVMH initially shared its plans for the development earlier this year, per Bloomberg. It would include luxury retail, a cafe, a restaurant, an open-air terrace, exhibition space and a garden rooftop.\nIf approved by the city, construction on the Louis Vuitton campus could start next year and finish by 2029.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The Hollywood Studio District could be getting a new housing development comprising 100 percent affordable housing.\nHVN Development filed an application with the Los Angeles Department of City Planning for 67 units of affordable housing at 5655 West Lexington Avenue, according to the application filed with the city.\nThe Irvine-based firm, which specializes in apartment and housing projects, applied for a five-story residential development on a 15,000-square-foot site owned by Calabasas-based Veloce Enterprise.\nPlans call for demolition of the two 3,244-square-foot, single-family homes and a garage that occupy the site near the corner of Lexington Avenue and Wilton Place.\nThe developer wants approval to increase the floor area ratio and height of the project, and reduce the open space by 82 percent to 1,541 square feet via a density bonus program, the Affordable Housing Incentive Program. The program is part of Los Angeles\u2019 Citywide Housing Incentive Program, adopted in February to encourage the production of affordable housing citywide.\nOf the 67 apartments, units would be available to extremely low-income to moderate-income households, records indicate. In\nL.A. County\n, those incomes range from $31,850 to $89,550 for one person.\n\nVeloce bought the site \u2014 two neighboring lots at 5655 and 5657 West Lexington \u2014 in January 2018 for $956,000, property records indicate.\nVeloce is led by Tomer Simonov, co-founder and CEO of MyLighthouse.co, a commercial real estate automation platform. He didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nAlso tapping government incentives in Hollywood is an affiliate of Los Angeles-based Avenue Homes. The firm filed an application with City Planning in June for 49 one- and two-bedroom apartments at\n6144 North Hazelhurst Avenue\n. The narrow slip of land is located one block west of Lankershim Boulevard.\nIn North Hollywood, HVN Development filed plans in March for a five-story building at 5151 Denny Avenue with 80 two-bedroom apartments. The development would open to moderate-, low- and very low-income households in exchange for density bonus incentives.\n",

The property is listed for nearly $14 million, or $2,332 per square foot.\nThat contract follows last week\u2019s priciest 2025 residential sale in the Palisades, with the trade of the\nhistoric Parry Residence\nfor $22.1 million or $2,635 per square foot. The Monterey Revival-style estate at 14924 Camarosa Drive was commissioned for Agnes S. Parry in 1929 and was featured in Architectural Digest a year after it was built.\nA local buyer purchased the Parry Residence in conjunction with the property behind it, at 14929 La Cumbre Drive for $5.3 million, or $1,813 per square foot.\nThe Corsica Drive mansion now in contract is located in the Palisades\u2019 Riviera neighborhood and was built in 2023.\n\nIt sits on about a third of an acre and has five beds and six baths across 6,000 square feet. The home\u2019s interiors include custom wallpapers, a steam shower and heated floors in the primary suite, outdoor entertaining areas and smart home security and lighting controls.\nThe residence was listed in late May for $14.5 million and saw a price reduction to its current ask about a month later.\nThe property last sold in 2017 for $5.4 million to husband-and-wife Tyler Mitchell and Brooke Mitchell, according to the deed.\nBerkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties\u2019 Christopher Feil and Justin Feil hold the listing.\nLast week\u2019s second-largest home to go into contract based on listing price was 533 15th Street in Manhattan Beach. The home is asking just under $10 million, or $1,886 per square foot.\nThe home entered the market with a nearly $13 million price tag in mid-February. It was reduced to its current ask on Aug. 12.\nA family trust tied to Timothy P. Meyer and Sandra Meyer is the seller, according to property records.\nJennifer Caskey of Compass\u2019 Jen Caskey Group holds the listing.\nThe six-bed, seven-bath home stretches across 5,300 square feet. Standouts of the property include ocean views, a hand-carved spiral staircase, pool, barbeque area and elevator stopping at all three levels of the home.\n",

        "content": "Nina Zokhrabyan is the operational backbone of Aaron Kirman\u2019s brokerage, Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California.\nShe\u2019s gone through several cycles and is no-nonsense about the limbo in which Los Angeles\u2019 residential high-end real estate market finds itself.\n\u201cEvery time you see a market shift there\u2019s what I call a pause period and the pause period is when the buyer and the seller are not seeing eye to eye on what the value of the property is,\u201d Zokhrabyan said. Kirman\u2019s firm moved up two spots on this year\u2019s ranking of the top brokerages in Los Angeles County by dollar sales volume, with the group clocking nearly $2 billion in volume across 504 deals to sit at No. 8.\nThe Real Deal reviewed buy- and sell-side transactions in the Multiple Listing Service between July 1, 2024, and July 1, 2025, to compile this year\u2019s list. What\u2019s reflected does not include off-market transactions or deals less than $1 million.\nAltogether, the group of 20 brokerages \u2014 a mix of boutiques and multi-office behemoths \u2014 raked in about $51 billion in closings during the July-to-July period.\n\u201cBuyers are cautious, sellers are stubborn and everyone is waiting for someone else to blink first,\u201d Kirman said.\nWhile one could technically say buyers hold the power, \u201cboth sides are paralyzed,\u201d he added, blaming the activity impasse on a mix of high interest rates, economic uncertainty and political gridlock nationally and locally.\nIn a nutshell, the market is challenged with buyers in the catbird seat. Even high-profile names are sometimes not enough to move the needle.\nThe spread between asking and closing prices is also widening. Spelling Manor sold for $110 million, after originally asking $165 million in 2022; Gene Simmons\u2019 former Beverly Hills pad got $28 million in July for a property originally listed at $48 million; and Jim Carrey\u2019s Brentwood estate sold for $17 million in August, a stretch from the $29 million asked when it hit the market in 2023.\nJust smile, it\u2019s fine\nAt the very high end, some brokers are positive.\n\u201cThe Los Angeles luxury market is showing surprising strength right now, especially at the $5-million-plus level, where we\u2019re seeing nearly double the number of transactions compared to a year ago,\u201d Douglas Elliman western region COO Bill Begert said.\nThe brokerage, which held onto No. 5 this year with nearly $2.7 billion in volume over 730 deals, has seen that run-up on account of post-fire dealmaking, in addition to the return of people who left the state during the pandemic.\nParker Beatty, Compass regional vice president of Southern California and Hawaii, finds more nuance.\n\u201cThe ultra-luxury market above $20 million is incredibly active right now, as with the lower end up to $4 million,\u201d Beatty said. \u201cBig-ticket deals are still closing, and buyers sense real value at the very top.\u201d\nHe pointed to Compass\u2019 Chris Cortazzo, who closed the $80 million sale of a Malibu home off market at the end of July, and Ginger Glass of Compass closing 71 Beverly Park for $63.1 million.\n\u201cThat kind of momentum shows that $20-million-plus deals remain resilient and insulated from broader market pressures,\u201d Beatty said. \u201cThe $5-million-to-$10-million segment is more challenging. One factor is [Measure ULA] \u2014 once you cross the $5-million threshold, that added cost really impacts buyers.\u201d\nThe tiered assessment, dubbed the \u201cmansion tax,\u201d tacks a 4 percent levy onto city of Los Angeles deals starting at $5.3 million and a 5.5 percent tax on those of $10.6 million or more.\nTo Beatty\u2019s point, Compass easily maintained its No. 1 spot on this year\u2019s list with almost 6,000 deals and nearly $15 billion in volume. That\u2019s about three times as many transactions and dollars as Coldwell Banker Realty in the No. 2 position.\nColdwell Banker Realty, with nearly 2,300 deals and $5.4 billion in volume, is seeing similar trends play out.\n\n\u201cIn general\u2026 the wealthy people are getting wealthier in the equity markets and really need a place to place their money, and also in the really high-end markets it\u2019s not necessarily about price,\u201d Kara Karns-Domic, regional vice president at Coldwell Banker Realty, said.\nThat\u2019s helped not only single-family sales but luxury condominium deals, which Karns-Domic saw jumping this calendar year.\n\u201cPeople are willing to pay $5,000 a month in their HOA fees because it\u2019s a new building. It\u2019s full-service. It\u2019s multi-use,\u201d she said.\nNo one knows that better than Compass\u2019 Sally Forster Jones, who saw her business boosted in the past 12 months by the ramp-up in high-rise living. That included closings at luxury properties such as the Rosewood Residences Beverly Hills and Beverly West, which she did in conjunction with Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s Tomer Fridman and Amir Ensani.\n\u201cThe importance of what is happening in the luxury market and in luxury condos has been very helpful for my increased sales this past year,\u201d Forster Jones said.\nThe interest is from both domestic and overseas, she added. In particular, buyers from Asia have helped offset a slowdown from Europe and the Middle East for Forster Jones.\nReality check\nBut though some see a silver lining, many agents can\u2019t escape the market\u2019s mixed messages.\n\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t know where to start,\u201d said The Agency\u2019s Santiago Arana. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this here for 21 years. It\u2019s certainly a very unique situation. I was talking to a couple of agents at one of my open houses and we were trying to figure out what\u2019s going on and nobody knows.\u201d\nThe Agency rounded out the unchanged top three brokerages in this year\u2019s ranking, with $3.6 billion in volume across 1,147 deals.\nBut for Arana, it doesn\u2019t feel like a normal down cycle. He notes a lack of predictability \u2014 thanks to Measure ULA and the fallout from January\u2019s Palisades and Eaton fires. To make things more confusing, Arana said his phone rings constantly \u2014 telling\nTRD\nthis fact just as he was about to head out for another showing.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s strange is you see these gigantic sales that pop up here and there and that\u2019s just the ultra-rich who are not really affected,\u201d he said. \u201cYou buy a $110 million house in Bel Air like [Aussie billionaire] James Packer, and you buy a house in Malibu for $80 million and it confuses people. But those big sales are happening because they\u2019re unique properties and 0.2 percent of the people in the world are going to buy regardless of what\u2019s happening.\u201d\nIf 0.2 percent of the population is unaffected and dropping cash, they\u2019re doing a lot of their business with Carolwood Estates. The Beverly Hills boutique, the youngest on the ranking, made its debut last year at No. 8 and now sits at No. 4 with $3.3 billion in sales across 478 deals. The county\u2019s two priciest closings this year \u2014 tied at $110 million \u2014 also involved Carolwood.\nThat includes the May sale of 630 Nimes Road in Bel Air, in which Carolwood\u2019s Drew Fenton and Westside Estate Agency\u2019s Kurt Rappaport represented Packer. Meanwhile, Carolwood\u2019s Stephen Resnick, Jonathan Nash, David Parnes and James Harris represented the seller.\nNimes was followed just a few months later with the closing of Spelling Manor, in which Fenton represented the seller. Carolwood\u2019s Linda May represented Google CEO Eric Schmidt and his wife Wendy in their purchase.\nParnes and Harris in joint comments emailed to\nTRD\nsaid they\u2019re not seeing the lengthy deal times as some of their peers or the significant differences between ask and closing prices, pointing to a robust pipeline of off-market transactions.\n\u201cHigh-net-worth individuals are starting to reemerge after a period of uncertainty \u2014 think tech founders, entertainment elite, global investors and international buyers, especially from Canada and China \u2014 seem to be dominating more of the market,\u201d said the two, who helm Carolwood\u2019s Bond Street Partners.\nIn fact, to Parnes and Harris\u2019 point, Branden Williams and Rayni Williams, cofounders of No. 11-ranked Beverly Hills Estates, just listed a $110 million Santa Monica residence. That will test buyers\u2019 appetite for another nine-figure deal, after their firm generated $1.5 billion in volume across 305 deals in the July-to-July period.\nBranden, ever the optimist and slick sales agent, said signs point to a bounceback and hinted at what he sees as larger shifts locally.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s definitely on the rise and it\u2019s coming back,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only reason people have been leaving is because of over-taxation, bad policies and too much regulation. But I think it\u2019s slowly turning.\u201d\nAccess data and contact information from this ranking\nhere\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.",

        "content": "When Gov. Gavin Newsom signed two budget trailer bills that scaled back an environmental law that\u2019s been a frequent scapegoat for the state\u2019s housing woes, it seemed like an offering of sorts to the real estate world. Was this recognition that California understood how badly regulations were getting in the way of investment and development? That the state would become a friendlier place to build? \u201cFrom your lips to God\u2019s ears,\u201d Cityview Chief Executive Sean Burton said.\nBut reforms to the landmark California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) are only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to mending the relationship between the public sector and real estate industry, especially after the City of Los Angeles generated even more friction with Measure ULA, which boosted property-transfer taxes on high-end deals. This worsened the strife with players in the city, who\u2019ve pushed back against it since day one. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who once said she was considering a pause on the tax, appears to have backtracked.\nSo it makes sense that the industry is squinting for any hint of a changing tide.\nThere have been other attempts to make things better, but so far nothing has come as close as the pitch to fix CEQA \u2014 which insiders weren\u2019t even expecting, since it failed to pass through the legislature before being tacked on to the governor\u2019s budget bill at the last minute, Sheri Bonstelle, a real estate attorney, said.\nThe Real Deal asked a selection of real estate professionals about the state and local governments\u2019 latest real estate-related efforts \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to score how well they might patch up the conflicts between builders and lawmakers.\nCalifornia Environmental Quality Act\nBackstory\n: Then-Governor Ronald Reagan enacted the California Environmental Quality Act in the 1970s to assess impacts development may have on the environment.\nWhat happened next\n:\nRather than save the trees, the rule has been blamed for blocking development and sowing the seeds of a housing crisis.\nFor example, a mixed-use development in Studio City that was once home to a historic hotel called the Sportsman\u2019s Lodge had the potential to be redeveloped into more than 500 apartments, some affordable, plus thousands of square feet for restaurants and other retail use years ago. But opponents, including the Studio City Residents Association and Erewhon, a luxe grocery store chain, filed appeals. Erewhon later sued the developer, Midwood Investment Development, and then the city on environmental grounds.\nThe court found in favor of the developer, but had the exemptions existed then, it wouldn\u2019t have been a multi-year process that cost millions of dollars, Los Angeles land-use attorney Dave Rand said, and there wouldn\u2019t have been a need for the thousands of pages of environmental analysis and myriads of technical reports, he added. \u201cIt was your kind of classic CEQA process that swallowed the project,\u201d he said.\nDevelopers got the drift. If anyone could turn to CEQA to stop development, their projects would end up held hostage. This is the kind of risk developers avoid, and many left the state rather than deal with delays that could kill their projects.\nThe update\n:\nWith reform, Burton\u2019s company is taking another look at the state. It hopes to avoid a recent scenario in which the entitlement process for about 500 apartments in Westchester \u2014 already greenlit by the Los Angeles City Planning Commission \u2014 took four years, including an environmental review, dozens of community meetings and more. That timeline could be cut in half, Burton guessed.\n\u201cThe governor called this the most important housing bills passed in a generation, and politicians often overstate matters, but the governor was not exaggerating at all,\u201d property law professor Christopher Elmendorf said.\nIt\u2019s clear that the reforms mostly remove what was once a substantial barrier to multifamily development, saving developers time and money. But there\u2019s no way to tell how much housing could come post-reforms. Still, the California Environmental Quality Act isn\u2019t solely to blame. There are other policies that kill development throughout California and its most populous city, Los Angeles. But there are some that boost development and others that don\u2019t do much either way.\nGrade:\nB\nMeasure ULA\nBackstory\n:\nMeasure ULA is a real estate transfer tax that allocates revenue to affordable housing in the City of Los Angeles, which voters passed in a ballot measure in November 2022. The so-called mansion tax actually applies to all properties \u2014 not just residences \u2014 worth more than $5 million.\nWhat happened next\n:\nA University of California, Los Angeles, paper found that commercial transactions have declined between 30 and 50 percent since the measure was enacted. Bonstelle said that her clients tell her it\u2019s killed their ability to buy and sell high-priced real estate. It\u2019s also slowed development, since developers know they\u2019ll have a tax to pay when they sell, knocking down the value of multifamily properties.\nResidential brokers have said that their clients are looking to places without the tax such as Malibu and Beverly Hills, or dishing out the cash. About 60 percent of deals that meet the threshold for the transfer tax are for single-family homes, according to an analysis published by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nRand, who called it the \u201chousing death tax,\u201d said he\u2019s never seen a single piece of policy be so destructive to the development of multifamily properties. \u201cIt\u2019s just been an absolute train wreck when it comes to the production of multifamily housing in L.A.,\u201d he said.\nDevelopers have looked outside the city for other options. Cityview is developing an eight-story apartment building in Gardena, near the SpaceX headquarters. Burton explained that the company couldn\u2019t have done that deal in the city of Los Angeles because of the mansion tax would hurt returns to investors. The measure basically \u201credlined\u201d Los Angeles, Burton said.\nThe update\n:\nIn the aftermath of the wildfires earlier this year, Bass said that she was looking into a potential pause on Measure ULA, but she hasn\u2019t taken any action since. Appeals have been filed and dismissed, but that hasn\u2019t stopped such billionaire developers as Rick Caruso from calling for a moratorium on Measure ULA.\nGrade:\nF\nSenate Bill 9\nBackstory\n:\nSenate Bill 9, which went into effect in January 2022, allows up to four homes to be built on an existing parcel of land if an owner splits a lot in half and develops a duplex on each part.\nWhat happened next\n:\nHailed as a single-family-zoning killer, the bill sounded great in theory to developers. In practice, SB 9 has been a \u201cnothingburger,\u201d per Elmendorf, and a \u201cbig, fat snoozer,\u201d according to Rand.\nThat\u2019s because there\u2019s an owner-occupancy requirement attached to the law that calls for applicants to sign affidavits saying that they intend to live in one of the units for three years after approval. \u201cThis takes developers out of the market for SB 9 projects,\u201d Elmendorf said, leaving it to homeowners.\nBut a typical homeowner, who has no development experience and less access to capital, probably won\u2019t want to go through the process of either dividing his or her lot to construct another home, or potentially tearing down one home and building up to four in place of it, if the homeowner took that route. It would also mean hiring and managing architects and contractors and living amid construction for a couple of years. For most, it\u2019s easier to build an accessory dwelling unit in a backyard, which was already allowed. The real value of the lot split law would be if a developer could come in and work with a willing homeowner, Bonstelle explained.\nThe update:\nFrom nothingburger to actually nothing. After Pacific Palisades residents raised concerns about increased density in their neighborhoods and how that could make evacuation more dangerous in the event of another fire, Newsom and Bass issued executive orders so that SB 9 is now restricted in the Palisades and other fire-ravaged areas.\nGrade:\nC\nBuilder\u2019s Remedy\nBackstory\n:\nBuilder\u2019s Remedy has been around for decades. It\u2019s a legal mechanism that takes away local control and hands it to developers as a consequence if a municipality hasn\u2019t built enough housing per state specifications. Developers took heed of it in the last half-decade as a way to build in certain areas, but some of their plans have wound up in legal fights.\nWhat happened next\n:\nIn Beverly Hills, a council member once said the city would pay whatever fine the state came up with to avoid a rezoning that would include affordable housing, Bonstelle remembers. But the city never got fined; instead, developers came in with proposals that bypassed local zoning. The threat of Builder\u2019s Remedy had become a reality, although Beverly Hills hasn\u2019t thrown in the towel in the fight.\nThen, in 2022, developer Leo Pustilnikov submitted a preliminary application for the Linden Project, a 19-story mixed-use building with 165 apartments, some affordable. The city denied it; the state sent a notice of violation letter to Beverly Hills; Pustilnikov sued.\nThe update\n:\nIn August, a judge found in favor of Pustilnikov, a vote of confidence in the Builder\u2019s Remedy process.\nBeverly Hills \u201cthrew everything at us under the sun, stonewalled every step of the way, fought these projects bitterly with every possible, imaginative delay tactic that you could ever think up,\u201d said Rand, who represents various Builder\u2019s Remedy applicants. \u201cBut that playbook fell apart.\u201d\nThe victory was helped in part by changes to state law, which strengthened Builder\u2019s Remedy in the meantime. (That includes CEQA reform, since its infill exemption applies to some Builder\u2019s Remedy projects.)\nUntil recently, there were all kinds of plausible arguments a city could make to delay or reject a Builder\u2019s Remedy project, Elmendorf said, but now \u201cthere is almost nothing left for cities that want to deny Builder\u2019s Remedy projects.\u201d\nGrade:\nB",

        "content": "Steven Ciaccio faced a slew of financial pitfalls over Lincoln Park properties after health issues led to recent loan defaults.\nThe commercial developer behind Chicago-based\nDomus Real Estate Group\n\u2014 which has a 30-story Fulton Market apartment complex requiring a\ncontroversial zoning change\nin the works \u2014 faced foreclosure lawsuits over two Lincoln Park properties owned by his LLCs.\nAn LLC tied to Ciaccio handed two condo units in the three-unit building at 1629 North Burling Street to its lender in July after being threatened with foreclosure. A separate residential building at 2026 North Clifton Avenue, owned by an LLC tied to Ciaccio, was also hit with a foreclosure lawsuit in July.\nCiaccio also faced a lawsuit last year for defaulting on a $250,000 loan that has since been settled. More recently, the Ridgemoor Country Club in Harwood Heights went after Ciaccio in a July lawsuit seeking more than $30,000 in alleged unpaid dues, a case that is still ongoing.\nThe three-unit condo building on North Burling is in a hot pocket of Lincoln Park where luxury condos usually have no trouble trading and foreclosures are rare. Plus, multiple contractors had filed mechanic\u2019s liens alleging nonpayment for their work on properties Ciaccio owned before surrendering them to his lenders.\nCiaccio\u2019s attorney Troy Sphar said the distress was tied to health issues and Ciaccio is in the process of resolving the disputes.\n\u201cIn recent times, Steve Ciaccio has suffered from significant health issues,\u201d Sphar said. \u201cSince then, he has focused on his health and has thankfully now recovered.\u201d Ciaccio is resolving the issues, with some already settled and others set to be settled soon, Sphar said.\nThe distress came as Ciaccio\u2019s commercial property investment company, Domus, is planning a $149 million, 347-unit Fulton Market apartment complex at 215 North Racine Street. Ciaccio runs the firm along with his brother, Phillip Ciaccio. The buildings at dispute were under separate LLCs and not part of Domus\u2019s portfolio.\nNew Jersey-based hard money lender Asset Based Lending brought a foreclosure lawsuit against Steven and Phillip Ciaccio and the LLC that owned the property, 1629 Burling LLC, in January. The lender alleged the LLC had missed monthly payments on a nearly $3 million loan in October and November of 2024.\n\nThe Ciaccios \u2014 both managers of 1629 Burling LLC \u2014 were guarantors on the Burling Street property\u2019s debt, and the lender sought $2.4 million from them for the loan and attorneys\u2019 fees. But the lender later asked for the Ciaccios to be removed as defendants, which the judge granted.\nIn June, the Ciaccios\u2019 LLC gave up two of the three units to the lender to avoid the foreclosure, records show. They had previously sold one unit to an individual in July 2024 for $799,000.\nThe Ciaccios, through the LLC, bought the building on the lot in 2016 for $1.6 million, property records show. They took out a $5.6 million construction mortgage in 2022 and built a three-unit condo building on the lot in 2023, though it\u2019s unclear if they used the entire amount of credit on the project.\nIn February 2024, the loan was refinanced with a $2.9 million loan from Asset Based Lending. Units 1 and 3 were both listed for sale at $1.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively, in February 2024, but are now off market, according to online listing portals.\nAt 2026 North Clifton, lender First Eagle Bank brought a foreclosure lawsuit in July against Steven Ciaccio and Casa Clifton LLC, the entity he used to purchase the property.\nCiaccio purchased the lot through the LLC in 2018 for $1.2 million. He took out a $2 million construction loan that November, according to the lawsuit. It alleges Ciaccio missed payments beginning in April 2025 on the loan and failed to make property tax payments.\nIn a separate lawsuit last year, Belmont Bank and Trust sued the Ciaccios and an LLC tied to a property on Fulton Market Street, nearby the Racine Street development site. The suit was brought against MCXIV Partners LLC for defaulting on a $250,000 loan after missing payments in March through July of 2024. In May, the Ciaccios agreed to pay the remaining balance and the bank dismissed the lawsuit.\nAt 215 North Racine, Domus was originally planning to build a 75,000-square-foot boutique office building, but pivoted from that plan earlier this year in favor of multifamily. The firm is seeking a zoning change to allow the property\u2019s floor-area-ratio to increase to 24 times the size of the lot to allow up to 312,000 square feet of building space, which would approximately quadruple the amount of buildable area allowed under the current zoning.\n",

        "content": "Mitch Goltz was on the verge of becoming a major multifamily builder in Chicago when he walked away.\nThe developer was part of a team that erected a 21-story, 248-unit building in the city\u2019s Streeterville neighborhood, which was just refinanced for $106 million, replacing its $102 million construction loan, a signal of lenders\u2019 faith in Midwest apartments.\nAnd Goltz had more big multifamily development sites lined up.\nBut it turns out that wasn\u2019t what he wanted \u2014 not the lawsuits from neighbors over planned developments nor the clashes with the city even when the neighbors played nice.\n\u201cThe younger version of us would say let\u2019s see if we can convince the city to say yes,\u201d Jeremy Forman, Goltz\u2019s longtime business partner, said.\nBut the real-time Goltz is taking a different tack, focusing more on retail, some of it in flyover country and much of it leased to national chains. He started a new firm, GTZ Properties, in late 2024 with Forman and a handful of others from their previous firm, GW Properties. They\u2019re being more selective by ensuring buy-in from government, meaning that they move on quickly these days when officials aren\u2019t sure plans are a match at first sight.\nThe transition hasn\u2019t been easy, and its details hint at why operators don\u2019t always pivot to new asset classes or regions. For Goltz, the new business means backing off housing plans after years of trying to push forward at some development sites and winding down his old firm with the final few sales of a portfolio of Chicagoland retail properties that have fetched well above $100 million total in the past couple years.\nStill, Goltz is thankful he didn\u2019t wade deeper into a multifamily market that looks to be dragging down his former partner Shai Wolkowicki at a moment when development starts are down across the Midwest and rents in existing apartment buildings are surging as a result.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking to tie up our resources and build 300 apartments, not because we can\u2019t or because we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea, but that\u2019s not what we specialize in,\u201d Goltz said. \u201cWe have projects going across the country that are down the fairway for the things we do.\u201d\nR\netail roots\nGoltz was raised to recognize successful storefronts.\nHis grandparents were retailers and ran a dime store on Armitage Avenue for 36 years. His father, Jay Goltz, was instrumental in shaping a stretch of Chicago\u2019s Clybourn Avenue into a campus of design-oriented businesses starting in the late 1970s. The area morphed from a \u201cwasteland of deteriorating and vacant industrial buildings,\u201d per a Chicago Tribune report from 2000, into destination shopping for home goods. Jay Goltz\u2019s stores include Jayson Home, Artists Frame Service, Chicago Art Source and Bella Moulding.\n\u201cMore than ever, you kind of have to stick in your lane and go with what you know,\u201d Goltz said in GTZ\u2019s Highland Park office, across the street from an Artists Frame Service shop. \u201cRetail is in my blood.\u201d\n\u201cMore than ever, you kind of have to stick in your lane.\u201d\nMitch Goltz on his renewed retail focus\nHe has operated in commercial real estate markets for 20 years. After hauling off from Chicagoland to graduate from the University of Wisconsin in 2004, he started out as a broker for retail, industrial and development sites. In 2014, he founded GW Properties, with Wolkowicki as his partner and co-founder. They formed a reputation by building and leasing for national retail tenants with specific expansion targets \u2014 Chick-fil-A, Chipotle or specialty grocers.\nOn the way, Goltz locked up sites ripe for investment across Chicagoland. Some were textbook wins, including a profitable $41 million sale in 2023 of western suburban retail to Met Life Investment Management, and the redevelopment of the former Maywood Park horse racing track.\nG\nuts and Goltz\n\nBut some of Goltz\u2019s projects turned into bruising fights.\nHe sparred with Glenview officials and neighbors over a controversial plan, lost money this year unloading a Logan Square property slated for 62 apartments, and pushed a Portage Park proposal for more than 340 apartments that stalled after residents urged more housing instead of his original retail-heavy plan. In Evanston, a 25-story apartment project that would rise on top of a retail building he owns may move forward under a different developer as he looks to sell the property.\nThe strategy was often to buy up the dirt, secure entitlements and then hand the project off to experts in housing or, in the case of Maywood Park, even industrial specialists to split up large sites in need of makeovers. In Skokie, that meant ushering a $90 million office-to-resi conversion through approvals before passing it to DIR Development and Drake Group.\n\u201cWe might only want 10 percent of a big acreage so we can do the retail on the street frontage, but we\u2019ll bring in the right puzzle pieces to get new uses on the back of these sites,\u201d Goltz said.\nRecently, though, it became time for a change. Goltz and Wolkowicki started selling off GW\u2019s holdings, and Goltz distanced himself from multifamily ambitions. Wolkowicki chased those dreams instead, a move that\u2019s landed him and partner Chikoo Patel in multiple court fights.\nGoltz wouldn\u2019t comment on Wolkowicki\u2019s conundrums, and Wolkowicki didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\nGoltz isn\u2019t leaving the fight behind entirely. He\u2019s ready to tussle when necessary.\nIn May, he overcame a courtroom clash that threatened his relationship with key CBRE brokers. \u201cThink we are an ATM?\u201d Goltz texted the brokers, Jon Springer and Kevin McLennan, after one of them pestered him about getting paid, records show.\nWhile Goltz was with GW in 2023, he sued CBRE after the dealmakers filed a $6 million broker\u2019s lien on suburban Chicago properties that Goltz\u2019s team had planned to develop into medical office buildings before the leases fell apart. By Goltz\u2019s account, DuPage Medical Group, the tenant represented by the brokers, was at fault for backing out of a plan, while CBRE insisted it did its part and deserved to be paid a commission. Springer responded: \u201cI think you are a developer and we brought a great equity partner and we need to get the money in.\u201d\nThe case was settled privately, and Goltz claims he made no concessions.\n\u201cBrokerage is obviously the lifeblood of our business,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBut more than ever, it\u2019s very hard to pinpoint values. Going from recognizing you have a property to recognizing you have a deal is a very big jump.\u201d\nS\ntill swinging\nHowever, Goltz has refined his knack for locking up development opportunities.\nHe\u2019s still mulling over what to do with a four-building, 327,000-square-foot office complex in the western suburb of Oak Brook he just picked up in August for $9 million following the bankrupt previous owner Adventus Realty Trust\u2019s $24 million loan default. There\u2019s a chance that some of it will remain office \u2014 Goltz said there\u2019s pent-up demand for Oak Brook workspace and the problem with the property was that the previous ownership wouldn\u2019t fund the costs of new leasing.\n\u201cThat is an exception for us,\u201d Goltz said. \u201cYou can\u2019t spend a living just chasing deals like Oak Brook. You have to have things in the middle.\u201d\nGTZ is looking beyond Oak Brook and developing real estate in 12 states right now. Although it specializes in repositioning properties into new uses, when it comes to retail, that philosophy now has to span conversions of big distressed buildings in dense major metros and farmland near single-family subdivisions in small and midsize towns.\nGoltz doesn\u2019t mind that some of his most lucrative deals are in markets many big-time property moguls consider flyover country. He oozes enthusiasm for the new acquisitions.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been floored by some of these secondary markets in Ohio,\u201d he said. \u201cHave you heard of Lima, Ohio?\u201d",

        "content": "Matthew Brewer made headlines last week for asking the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to review possible conflicts of interest of the next potential head of the Chicago Housing Authority.\nNot only did Brewer hold up Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s nominee for the position, longtime 27th Ward\nAlderman Walter Burnett Jr.\n, but Brewer himself was tapped as the agency\u2019s interim head on Tuesday, with the title of operating chairman.\nThe last minute delay was a blow to Burnett Jr., who stepped down from his seat at City Hall after Johnson announced he would appoint him CEO of the CHA, pending approval from its board. In July, the Chicago Tribune reported that the CHA\u2019s resident advisory board was against Burnett\u2019s appointment.\nSo who is Brewer, the CHA\u2019s leader until further notice?\nThe Chicago native is a graduate of Mount Carmel High School, a private all-boys Catholic school in Woodland, and of Stanford University, Harvard Business School\u2019s MBA program and Yale Law School. He is the founder of Future Leaders of Chicago, a group that encourages civic engagement among high school students in Chicago.\nBrewer has been a commissioner on the CHA\u2019s board since 2013 and was named vice chairman in November 2021. He has served as interim chairman since October 2024 but in his new role as \u201coperating chairman,\u201d he has taken over the agency\u2019s top executive spot for now.\nBurnett\u2019s appointment to CEO isn\u2019t entirely off the table, however. A statement from the CHA issued Tuesday stated Brewer will serve in the role \u201cuntil a Chief Executive Officer is approved by the board.\u201d\nOutside of his role at the CHA, Brewer has represented several major corporations with the law firm, Barlit Beck. He represented Monsanto, now Bayer, in a lawsuit filed by the city of St. Louis that accused the company\u2019s herbicide of causing cancer. He also defended Walgreens in a series of lawsuits filed by hundreds of government agencies over the distribution of opioids. His areas of legal expertise include intellectual property, antitrust, false advertising and product liability, among others.\nBrewer has made several lists of notable Chicago executives including Crain\u2019s 2020 Notable Minority Executives in Accounting, Consulting &amp; Law, and Crain\u2019s 2017 list of Most Influential Minority Lawyers.\nThe commercial litigation attorney is also a business owner himself. He runs the city\u2019s first Black-owned, family-run marijuana dispensary along with his brother, Chuck, and mother Dianne. The trio opened Grasshopper Club in Logan Square in 2023 with Matthew Brewer overseeing the businesses, while Chuck runs the daily operations and Dianne handles the accounting. It has since expanded to a second location in the South Loop.\n\nBrewer\u2019s brother was once arrested for cannabis possession and later the family applied for a social equity license from the state to open the dispensary. The program was created to address the harms of the national War on Drugs campaign that led to high incarceration rates among Black Illinoisians for drug offenses that are no longer considered crimes.\n\u201cIt was this opportunity for wealth creation, generational for my mother and my brother,\u201d Brewer told Block Club Chicago when the dispensary opened in 2023.\nWhether Brewer will remain in CHA\u2019s top spot is unclear. At a meeting Sept. 2 the CHA delayed voting on Burnett\u2019s appointment to the agency\u2019s top position, which Brewer said was done at HUD\u2019s request.\nHUD is the main funder of the $1.3 billion agency, however, it generally operates independently from any other government agency and is managed by its own board of directors. The Mayor\u2019s Office last week questioned whether\nHUD\nhad the authority to weigh in on the appointment process, the Tribune reported.\nBrewer\u2019s letter to HUD sent the prior week highlighted Burnett\u2019s 30-year tenure as an alderman and his \u201cownership interest in\u201d three properties rented by CHA housing voucher holders as potential conflicts of interest, the Tribune reported.\nThe letter from Brewer asked for clarification if the CHA would need to request special waivers from HUD to excuse the conflicts. It also noted that Burnett was in the process of transferring the vouchers from the CHA\u2019s purview to the Cook County Housing Authority\u2019s purview which would eliminate the conflict.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unusual and unfortunate situation that we find ourselves in during this time of transition,\u201d Brewer said at the Sept. 2 meeting. \u201cWe are working with the city still and hope to \u2026 have a CEO announcement in the next couple of weeks.\u201d\nCHA has not had a permanent leader since November, after\nTracey Scott resigned\nfrom the CEO position after being appointed by former mayor Lori Lightfoot. Angela Hurlock was initially named its interim CEO.\n\n",

        "content": "Site Centers is unloading a big Lakeview retail property.\nThe publicly traded real estate investment trust picked up Mid-America Real Estate brokers to lure a buyer for the five-story building at 3030 North Broadway in the North Side neighborhood, CoStar\nreported\n.\nThe 132,000-square-foot asset is anchored by a Mariano\u2019s grocery store. The listing follows the Beachwood, Ohio-based\nREIT\n\u2019s acquisition of the property in 2017 for $81 million. That purchase price broke down to $614 per square foot.\nSite Centers has been selling off properties that fall outside the strip mall category, after completing a spin-off last year focused on such assets dubbed\nCurbline Properties\n. In the past two years, Site Centers\u2019 selloff totals at least $260 million in sales, including properties in Colorado Springs, Orlando and Brentwood, Missouri.\n\nThe seller did not disclose a sales price to the outlet, making it unclear as to what price tag the firm is expecting for the building.\nBut it won\u2019t be Site Centers\u2019 first sale of Chicagoland property in recent memory amid the firm\u2019s pivot:\nlast year it sold\nthe Woodfield Village Green shopping center in Schaumburg for $93.2 million, or $221 per square foot, to a limited liability company linked to Seallte-based Bridge33 Capital. That deal marked the highest-priced retail property sale since the flagship Neiman Marcus store on Chicago\u2019s Magnificent Mile changed hands for $94 million two years ago.\nNot only is the Lakeview building 100 percent leased, but the terms are long for each tenant \u2014 a weighted average of 13.5 years \u2014\u00a0 ensuring good revenue streams, according to Mid-America. Other than the Kroger-owned Mariano\u2019s grocery anchor, the building includes a Starbucks, Club Studio, Fresh Dental and PNC Bank. A 271-space parking garage is also on the property and included in the purchase. The building was developed in 2016 on a lot that sat empty for a decade after another grocery store burned down at the location in 2005.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The maker of Chicago\u2019s most divisive, bitter spirit is asking just under $6 million to offload his 8,460-square-foot home in New Buffalo.\nTremaine Atkinson, head of CH Distillery \u2014 the maker of the Swedish-style, bitter schnapps Jeppson\u2019s Mal\u00f6rt \u2014 listed the home at 11712 Prospect Drive Aug. 29, with Jan Smith of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate. The six-bedroom home sits on 1.2 acres adjacent to a 144-acre marsh preserve, Crain\u2019s Chicago Business\nreported\n.\nConstruction began in 2011 and was completed in 2014 with a mix of contemporary stylings, such as flat green roofs covered with living plants and round-topped roofs. The home offers five full bathrooms and three half-baths; a boat house and floating dock with access to the Galien River; a terrace with outdoor kitchen and fire feature; three additional decks anchored by two masonry fireplaces and a firepit; and a Gunite infinity pool with waterfall and spa.\nThe New Buffalo house, which is 71 miles from the Chicago Loop, incorporates steel joists, frameless interior doors and other industrial motifs in contrast to the marshy settings. Securing a selling price near the asking price would likely be a record for off-lake\nproperties\nin the area.\nAtkinson launched CH Distillery in Pilsen more than a dozen years ago after spending most of his career in financial services, first as a vodka distiller then in 2018 he bought the Carl Jeppson Company, maker of Mal\u00f6rt, moving production of the Chicago hooch back from Florida. CH Distillery also produces gin, bourbon and other spirits. CH Distillery opened a high-end sushi bar and restaurant, now called Joto, during Covid.\n\nAtkinson sold a Lincoln Park home in 2019 that was also built in a contemporary style with brick and steel features. That home\nsold\nfor $4.3 million. In 2023 he bought an estate in the Village of\nGolf\nfor $7.2 million.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Apartment hunters in downtown Chicago are paying more than ever \u2014 and finding fewer options.\nRents in top-tier downtown buildings climbed 6.4 percent year-over-year in the second quarter, with Class A units averaging $3.99 per square foot, or nearly $2,800 total for a typical one-bedroom, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The rise comes as rising construction costs, stubbornly high interest rates and skittish investors keep new projects sidelined, leaving renters stuck in an increasingly tight market, according to data from appraisal and consulting firm Integra Realty Resources.\nDevelopers aren\u2019t rushing to fill the gap. Just one major project \u2014 CMK\u2019s 149-unit building at 1717 South Michigan Avenue \u2014 was delivered this year. Only two more buildings totaling 440 units are slated for completion by 2026: a 132-unit\nproject\non the Near North Side by developer CityPad and a 308-unit tower in Fulton Market from a partnership of CRG and Shapack Partners.\nA meaningful boost in supply isn\u2019t expected until 2027, when Integra projects more than 2,300 units will finally come online.\nVista Properties broke ground\non a 31-story, 494-unit project in Fulton Market in recent weeks after landing a $173 million construction financing package. In the meantime, downtown vacancy, already at 3.9 percent, is on track to hit its lowest point in over a decade.\nThe imbalance is keeping renters\nboxed\nin. Elevated borrowing costs mean many would-be buyers are staying put, further juicing demand.\n\n\u201c\u201cWe\u2019re expecting to see continued rent growth because there\u2019s just not many options in the market,\u201d Integra\u2019s Ron DeVries told the outlet, though he also said\ntightening occupancy and rising yields\nwill eventually draw investors back.\nAbsorption numbers underline how much demand is outpacing supply. Nearly 1,000 units were absorbed in the second quarter alone, with more than 2,000 so far this year \u2014 a strong tally given the lack of deliveries. Renters are also seeing far slimmer pickings. DeVries noted that in the West Loop, a renter could once shop eight buildings for a one-bedroom; next year, they might find only three with vacancies.\nThe squeeze leaves landlords firmly in the driver\u2019s seat. With little relief in the pipeline, Integra projects steady rent growth through at least 2027. For tenants, that means higher monthly bills and tougher competition. For investors and developers, it signals a market poised for stronger revenues, but\nfinancing\ngaps have to first be filled.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

GID joined the ranks of firms offering up what amount to thousands of apartment units for sale downtown, providing a way for new investors to buy into a market that\u2019s recording increasing rents due largely to a slowdown in multifamily construction.\nIt\u2019s unclear how much GID will take for the sale of Flair Tower. The firm purchased it at the height of a booming Chicago market in 2011 for $85 million, but other recent sales of apartment towers in and around downtown have come with steep dropoffs from their previous values.\nThe 398-unit North Water Apartments, at 340 East North Water Street in Streeterville, hit the market in April. Miami-based Crescent Heights purchased the multifamily component of the building in June 2023 for $173 million ($435,000 per unit), a bargain compared to its $240 million trade in 2016. It\u2019s unclear what the North Water property will sell for today, as it has competition nearby with another large listing.\n\nThe State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio also\nlisted a Streeterville apartment building\nlast month to join the pack of downtown multifamily assets on the market.\nIn River North, adjacent to Streeterville, Flair Tower is 97 percent leased among its apartment offerings and the tower\u2019s retail base is fully leased. There are 184 parking spaces as well as a pool, clubroom, updated lobby and other amenities. A $60 million loan from Berkeley Point Capital was taken out on the tower in December 2016, five years after GID\u2019s acquisition, according to Cook County property records.\nThe tower was built in 2010 and current asking rents start at $3,424 per unit, or $3.61 per square foot.\nGID currently has more than $31.1 billion in real estate\nassets\nunder its management, including more than 56,000 apartment\nunits\nand 27 million square feet of commercial space.

        "content": "Menashe Properties is coming back to Chicago for another piece of its office market.\nNearly two years after breaking in with a steeply-discounted Loop tower purchase, the Portland, Oregon-based firm is teeing up a Wacker Drive deal.\nMenashe has a deal in the works to acquire 125 South Wacker Drive, a 31-story office building owned by La Caisse, formerly known as Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge, the real estate arm of Quebec\u2019s largest pension fund, CoStar\nreported\n. The sale price hasn\u2019t been disclosed but is expected to come in far below the $145 million La Caisse paid to buy it in 2017.\nThe deal is still preliminary and could fall apart, but if completed, it would mark Menashe\u2019s second Chicago office tower purchase after its $45 million acquisition of 230 West Monroe Street in 2022. That snapped a long\ndrought\nin Chicago office sales and underscored how far pricing had fallen as high interest rates and uncertainty around office demand kept most investors sidelined.\nLa Caisse hired JLL in April to market the 577,000-square-foot Wacker Drive property, which was just 63 percent leased at the time, with a weighted average lease term of 4.3 years. The building\u2019s rent roll is dominated by smaller occupiers averaging just over 8,000 square feet each, atypical of nearby\nWacker Drive\ntowers with anchor tenants.\nThat profile fits Menashe\u2019s playbook: the firm has said it struck nearly 50 leases totaling 150,000 square feet at\n230 West Monroe\nin less than two years by targeting smaller tenants overlooked in some big office tower strategies.\n\nThe Canadian seller, meanwhile, has been under pressure to trim office exposure. Earlier this year, La Caisse blamed its bets on New York and Chicago\noffice towers\nfor dragging down real estate performance. In June, Bloomberg reported it had defaulted on the mortgage tied to 85 Broad Street in Manhattan. In Chicago, the fund also owns 10 and 120 South Riverside Plaza, where a $75 million renovation campaign has buoyed leasing.\nThe pending deal reinforces a contrarian bet on Chicago\u2019s battered office sector. CEO Jordan Menashe declined to discuss the Wacker Drive building specifically but said he was bullish on the market. \u201cI love Chicago, I love the West Loop, and I\u2019m excited to come back for more,\u201d he told the outlet.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The offices span about 209,000 square feet, while the grocery store and shopping center comprise the remaining 49,000 square feet.\nThe 1100 Park Place building purportedly sold for $85.7 million, or about $583 per square foot, and 1200 Park Place went for $40 million, or approximately $655 per square foot, according to CoStar. The retail center at 1010-1016 Park Place sold for around $48.3 million, or about $991 per square foot.\nThe seller was J.P.

The final sale price was not disclosed.\nThe 149 New Montgomery building spans 80,000 square feet across six stories. It was originally built in 1907 at four stories with the fifth and sixth floors added in the 1930s. The structure is home to tech companies like Scality and SuperAnnotate with ground-floor retail at the street level, including restaurant Caf\u00e9 Madeleine.\nSan Francisco\u2019s South Financial District is predicted to be \u201cin high demand from tech,\n[artificial intelligence]\nand professional services firms\u201d due to its proximity to Market Street, Salesforce Transit Center and the Moscone Center, Ben Kochalski, president and CIO at TMG Partners, said in a statement. TMG is planning renovations that would \u201cenhance the creative office elements of this brick and timber building while preserving its architectural charm.\u201d\n\nThe New Montgomery corridor has seen some buildings trade hands in recent years, whether through foreclosure sales or outright acquisitions.\nIn October, Ridge Capital Investors acquired a 20-story office tower at\n33 New Montgomery Street\nfor about $75 million, or half of what it sold for a decade prior. In November 2023, lender CrossHarbor Capital Partners nabbed the 100,200-square-foot building at\n55 New Montgomery Street\nin a foreclosure sale for $15 million after Swift Real Estate Partners defaulted on a $71.4 million loan.\nOffice sales in San Francisco have seen better days. In the past two years,\ntwo-thirds of office properties\nin the city have sold for less than their previous sale prices, according to Yardi Research. San Francisco was second in the country only to Houston. An average of 42 percent of offices sell for less than their previous prices nationally.\nAs of the second quarter, San Francisco holds the crown for the highest office vacancy rate in the country at about 35 percent, per Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s second-quarter\nreport\n.\n",

A court-appointed receiver tapped Newbond Holdings and Conversant Capital to buy the lodging properties in Union Square.\nThe price of the transaction was redacted in court filings, though it\u2019s estimated to be one of the biggest sales in the city this year. The buyers were required to put down two deposits of $10 million each earlier this summer, according to the Chronicle.\nA bondholder report in July placed their current combined appraised value between $450 million to $500 million. The two hotels had a combined appraised value of nearly $1.6 billion in 2016.\nThe bondholder report said the purchase was contingent on a buyer modifying, extending and assuming the distressed $725 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan, the San Francisco Standard\nreported\n. The buyers are also required to provide funding to help with the hotels\u2019 cash flow challenges and to pay for their renovations.\n\nThe sale marks the conclusion of a years-long saga at the two Union Square hotels.\nIn 2023, former owner Park Hotels &amp; Resorts, an affiliate of Hilton Worldwide Holdings, defaulted on its $725 million loan on the properties. They were turned over to receiver Michelle Russo of Hotel Asset Value Enhancement, who looked for a buyer for nearly two years on behalf of Wilmington Trust, a trustee for special servicer Wells Fargo.\nForeclosure appeared imminent\nand sales deadlines were extended numerous times before investors stepped in.\nHilton Union Square is the city\u2019s largest hotel with 1,921 rooms. The Parc 55, also a Hilton property, is among the top five with 1,024 keys.\nThough the two major San Francisco hotels have found buyers, they\u2019re far from the only hotels in the Bay Area on the market amid distress. Several lodging properties in Oakland, Berkeley and San Jose, among other East and South Bay enclaves, have\nfallen into foreclosure\nover the past two years.\nThe outlook for tourism could be bright, however. Visitors to San Francisco are expected to grow to 23.5 million this year and spend nearly $9.4 billion, up from 23.3 million visitors and almost $9.3 billion last year, according to the Chronicle.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "A California appeals court ruled the city of Fairfield broke a decades-old law and illegally charged property taxes on residents.\nThe court ruled that the Solano County city has been illegally taxing property owners for the costs of improved lighting and landscaping without seeking voter approval through a referendum, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n.\nThe basis of the case dates back nearly four decades. Since 1988, the city of Fairfield has charged property owners in the Rolling Hills Maintenance District annual fees for lighting and maintenance. That includes landscaping on roadway median strips and between curbs and sidewalks. As of the 2022-2023 year, the assessment was $300 per lot, according to the Chronicle.\nA lawsuit from a landowner in the city argued that the local government was violating Proposition 218, a 1996 California ballot measure approved by 56 percent of voters that built on the voter-approval requirements of Proposition 13, a 1978 initiative mandating public votes on any local property tax increases.\nThe state Supreme Court ruled in 1992 that assessments to pay for property-related improvements were not property taxes covered by Prop 13. This banned increases in local property assessments and fees unless they paid only for the costs of improvements the city was meant to fund and were approved by votes of a majority of affected property owners.\n\nSolano County Superior Court Judge Tim Kam initially rejected the lawsuit, saying the city had increased assessments only within limits it had declared before Prop 218.\nIn last week\u2019s ruling, the First District Court of Appeal in San Francisco said that the assessment had been $196.23 for residential lots in January 1997, when the ballot measure took effect, while it was $300 per lot in the most recent assessment.\nThat means the city of Fairfield\u2019s imposition of the higher assessment was \u201cgreater than the rate on Proposition 218\u2019s effective date.\u201d In a 3-0 ruling, Justice Mark Simons explained the assessment shouldn\u2019t have been imposed without approval by a majority of the affected property owners.\nIf the ruling stands, affected property owners would be entitled to refunds of excess payments. The City of Fairfield might also be required to reduce its assessments until a special election is held. The unidentified owner who filed the lawsuit is seeking four years of refunds, though the exact figure remains unclear.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Shattuck Avenue in the North Shattuck neighborhood, College Avenue and Solano Avenue are under review for possibly taller buildings.\nBerkeley\u2019s upzoning push is part of the city\u2019s endeavor to increase \u201cmiddle housing\u201d such as duplexes, fourplexes and courtyard apartments in high-resource neighborhoods. The city is prioritizing these transit corridors in hopes of \u201caffirmatively furthering fair housing,\u201d said Jordan Klein, director of the city\u2019s Department of Planning and Development, per the Business Times.\nSolano and College Avenues are currently zoned at maximum heights of two stories, while buildings in North Shattuck are capped at three stories, making them some of the shortest-zoned areas of the city. The city is considering two upzoning proposals at the moment, though they could change pending feedback from the Berkeley City Council, Planning Commission and members of the local community.\nThe first option calls for two-story increases at Solano Avenue and North Shattuck and a one-story increase at College Avenue. The second option would seek three-story increases at Solano and North Shattuck and a two-story increase at College Avenue.\n\nUnder state density bonus laws, new buildings on sites zoned with three-story maximums could actually reach between six to eight stories. Almost all of the mid-rise projects moving forward in Berkeley take advantage of the state density bonus program, Klein said, per the Business Times.\nIn total, city staff estimate that option one could create between 1,100 and 1,600 new housing units, while option two could create 1,300 to 1,780 units across all three areas.\nThis would align with the city\u2019s state-mandated\nHousing Element\n, according to Klein. The East Bay city is on the hook to build 8,934 new residential units by 2031.\nIn June, the Berkeley City Council approved what will be the\ncity\u2019s tallest building\n: a 28-story residential tower at 1950-1998 Shattuck Avenue. That same month, the council voted unanimously to\noverturn a single-family zoning policy\ndating back to 1916, allowing three-story buildings with up to eight units to be built on a typical 5,000-square-foot lot.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A stretch of Bay Area shoreline near the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge is set for rebirth after a $40 million purchase.\nAlameda and Contra Costa County\u2019s East Bay Regional Park District bought 83 acres at Point Molate, a spit of land on the San Pablo Peninsula, for $40 million, the Mercury News\nreported\n. The Guidiville Rancheria tribe of California sold the property.\nThe sale to East Bay Parks marks the conclusion of more than two decades of questions around the future of the site.\nThe bayside site was once the location of a Navy fueling site and faced development as a casino; the\nconstruction of 1,450 luxury housing units\nwas also proposed but faced pushback from conservationists.\nThe Park District plans to turn the land into its newest regional park as part of its \u201cdual mission of preserving a rich heritage of natural and cultural resources in the East Bay, but then also providing equitable access to these open spaces,\u201d East Bay Regional Park District general manager Sabrina Landreth told the Mercury News.\nThe 83-acre parcel bought by East Bay Parks is one of the last undeveloped and unprotected headlands in the Bay Area, boasting views of the Golden Gate Bridge, Mount Tamalpais and the East Brother Light Station. Animals like osprey, coyotes and leopard sharks call the land and water nearby home, according to the Mercury News.\n\nCongress first floated a reuse plan for the site in 1997 after it was decommissioned from its use as a Navy site. The Navy transferred control of the property to the city of Richmond to determine a path forward.\nThe Guidiville Rancheria of California proposed a $1.2 billion casino in 2004. Six years later, the casino proposal went to Richmond voters in a citywide advisory referendum and failed at the ballot box; the city council subsequently rejected the idea.\nThat prompted the tribe and developer to sue the city for $750 million in damages, but a federal court upheld the council\u2019s decision in 2018. Part of that settlement required the city to sell the land to the Guidiville Rancheria for $400 if it couldn\u2019t sell the property within four years.\nIn 2020, Winehaven Legacy looked to build 1,450 homes on a 270-acre portion of Point Molate. The Richmond City Council approved the plan that year, but public opposition\nput the kibosh\non the proposal in 2022.\nThe city of Richmond transferred Point Molate to the Guidiville Rancheria for $400 in May 2022 with the stipulation to decide within five years how to utilize the land.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A Greystar affiliate sold a San Jose affordable apartment complex in one of the South Bay\u2019s biggest multifamily transactions so far this year.\nPark Kiely, a 948-unit property at 355 Kiely Boulevard, sold to real estate firm Standard Communities, nonprofit Housing on Merit and investment company Vistria Real Estate for $370 million, the San Jose Mercury News\nreported\n. The group bought the property as Standard Vistria Park Kiely Owner LP,\naccording\nto the Silicon Valley Business Journal.\nThe deal looks to be the largest apartment complex purchase in Santa Clara County so far in 2025, according to the Mercury News. The previous record in the county was set in April when Rockpoint Group bought The Villages at Cupertino for $207.2 million.\nThe buying group obtained a purchase loan of $203.5 million from JLL Real Estate Capital to acquire the property. JLL transferred the loan to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, better known as Freddie Mac.\nThe Park Kiely campus was built in 1972 and consists largely of three-story buildings. All units on the property are affordable and set aside for those whose annual incomes don\u2019t exceed 80 percent of the\narea median income\nfor Santa Clara County. For one person, that would mean a maximum of $109,320, or $156,160 for a family of four.\n\nStandard Vistria Park Kiely Owner also secured a property tax welfare exemption, enabling the new owners to avoid paying some or all of the property taxes that would normally be levied on real estate in California. The money saved from the property tax exemption will go toward \u201csubstantial rehabilitation\u201d of the Park Kiely complex, according to the Mercury News. The goal is to keep Park Kiely affordable for decades to come.\nIt\u2019s not the only affordable apartment complex in San Jose to trade hands this summer.\nIn June, Post Glen Group and Affordable Housing Access bought the\nOrchard Glen\napartments in south San Jose for $61.1 million. That 1978-built property, located at 3975 Seven Trees Boulevard, Orchard Glen, consists of 288 mixed-income units across nearly a dozen two-story buildings.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "There\u2019s a provenance of politics and pugilism attached to a Pacific Heights home that has hit the market for just under $3.8 million, or $1,320 per square foot.\nThe home belongs to Jan Zivic, daughter of former welterweight boxing champion Fritzie Zivic, who bought it from San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie in 2019, in the months before the\u00a0onset of the pandemic. Zivic is now looking to get about even on a sale of the 2,875-square-foot, three-level house at 80 Wilmot Street, a quiet one-way alley just off Fillmore Street.\n\u201cIt was very difficult to decide to sell the house and leave the neighborhood and the people who\u00a0 care about each other,\u201d Zivic said via the Skall+Glassman team at Golden Gate Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, which is marketing the house. But, she noted, \u201cI wanted to live closer to my daughter.\u201d\nZivic, a former city library commissioner and executive recruiter, bought it from Lurie for around $3.7 million or roughly $1,270 per square foot, according to PropertyShark. Lurie\u2019s half brother, Alexander Fromm Lurie, executive vice president of growth at City Real Estate\nsince January\n, represented Lurie in the sale. Lurie nabbed the property in 2005 for $2.3 million, or $800 a foot, property records indicate.\nThe modernist home with a loft-like layout features three bedrooms and two-and-a-half bathrooms. It was designed by architect and interior designer Richard Brayton, co-founder of Brayton Hughes Design Studios, as his personal residence in 1994.\n\u201cIt is a fabulously designed home in the best neighborhood in the city, in walking distance of Japantown, and some of the best restaurants and retail shops in all of SF,\u201d Zivic said.\n\nDetails include a sculptural metal staircase that ascends from the entry, connecting all three floors beneath a skylight. It was \u201coriginally intended for a spiral staircase that was never installed,\u201d according to the Skall+Glassman team at Golden Gate Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, which is marketing the house.\n\u201cThis was the street transposed into the house,\u201d Brayton said in a 1996\nSFGate\narticle. \u201cEssentially, it\u2019s a European-style covered alley crowned with its own skylight. It\u2019s narrow and has its own circulation. Naturally, it made sense to have a stair that let in light.\u201d\nSubsequent updates by Van Acker Construction Associates include a private garden patio with fireplace.\nIn Pacific Heights earlier in the month, a sprawling mansion\nfeatured at this year\u2019s San Francisco Decorator Showcase\nfound a buyer\nat $16.2 million\nor roughly $1,800 per square foot, the San Francisco Standard reported. The manse, at 2935 Pacific Avenue, spans more than 9,000 square feet and features eight bedrooms, seven-and-a-half bathrooms, a Moroccan-themed dining room and a roof deck with a bar.\nIn July, the Pacific Heights home once owned by the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein\nsold\n.\nThe three-story, 9,500-square-foot Italianate mansion at 2460 Lyon Street sold for $19 million, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. The all-cash deal with an undisclosed buyer came out to about $2,000 per square foot.\n",

Most of the properties are apartment complexes with loans from 2022 and 2023.\nThis month will see more than $710 million in loans at the auction block, up from\n$670 million in August\nand\n$400 million in July\n.\nHarris County, home to Houston, was once again the hardest hit, with 10 properties totaling nearly $350 million in debt facing foreclosure.\nHere are the biggest loans up for auction this month. It\u2019s possible that some of these borrowers and lenders will reach agreements to avoid auction.\nHouston\nThe largest CRE loan hitting the auction block in Houston this month is a $52.5 million mortgage tied to the 592-unit Estates at Avenstar. The apartment complex, at 10950 Briar Forest Drive, was built in 1974 and is owned by Lurin. The lender is Nexbank.\nSan Antonio\nAustin-based Casoro Group was facing foreclosure on the Aviator at Brooks, a 280-unit apartment complex at 8010 Aeromedical Road in San Antonio, but the sale was canceled. Acres Capital provided the $33.9 million mortgage. The debt on the property, built in 2016, works out to $121,000 per unit.\nDallas\n\nIn a blow for both Jonas Woods and downtown Dallas, Pacific Elm Properties is\nfacing foreclosure on One Dallas Center\n. The firm owns the bottom half of the 30-story tower that Todd Interests converted to mixed-use in 2014. It appears to have defaulted on a $34.5 million securitized mortgage tied to the building.\nFort Worth\nThe owners of Apex Apartments \u2014 a joint venture between California-based fund CalTier, Arizona-based Bakerson and Las Vegas-based investment firm Camino Verde Group \u2014 could lose the Tarrant County property to foreclosure at this month\u2019s auction. The notice claims the firm defaulted on a $12.8 million mortgage from CoreVest American Finance Lender for Apex Apartments, at 5320 East Rosedale Street. The 152-unit apartment complex was built in 1968, and the debt amounts to $84,00 per unit.\nRepeat offenders\nOf the 10 foreclosures in Houston\u2019s Harris County, seven properties are regulars. They\u2019ve received multiple foreclosure notices but haven\u2019t been sold yet. The list includes some holdovers from\nFercan Kalkan\u2019s multifamily portfolio\n, which hit the auction block last month.\nMar Del Sol, a 248-unit complex at 9303 Woodfair Drive ($10 million);\nSutter Ranch Apartments, at 10445 Greens Crossing Boulevard ($18.2 million);\nThe Pointe Apartments, a 517-unit complex at 4101 Shaver Street ($27.6 million);\nVilla Nueva Apartments, a 542-unit complex at 5300 West Gulf Bank Drive ($28.6 million);\nVeranda Village, a 330-unit complex at 3635 Shaver Street ($31.6 million);\nFalls of Las Villas, a 466-unit complex at 407 Richey Street, and Falls of Alta Vista, a 514-unit complex at 621 Richey Street ($33.5 million); and\nThe Selena Apartments, a 446-unit complex at 250 Uvalde Road ($37.9 million).\nTwo properties in Bexar County are headed to the block a second time:\nThe Joseph at Huebner, a 192-unit complex at 11660 Huebner Road ($31.2 million); and\nPoet\u2019s Walk, an assisted living facility at 5438 Presidio Parkway ($48 million).\nTravis County will see one repeat customer at the auction block this month:\nA retail strip at 13376 North U.S. Highway 183 ($16 million).\nThis story was updated to reflect that the sale of Aviator at Brooks was canceled prior to the auction.\n",

        "content": "A probe by federal regulators prompted Austin-based real estate developer American Ventures to ask the San Marcos City Council to postpone a final vote on a proposed $500 million, 101-acre mixed-use project this week.\nRequest followed an August disclosure that the firm is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investigators have been questioning current and former American Ventures employees, as well as investors, about the firm\u2019s business practices, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n. The firm was asking for taxpayer-funded incentives for the project by establishing a public improvement district on land the company purchased near the intersection of East McCarty Lane and Rattler Road in San Marcos.\nThe\nbuildout\nwould take place across three phases, wrapping up in 2031. Documents estimate the project could eventually generate $66.1 million in sales and property taxes for Hays County and $145 million in property, sales and hotel taxes for the city. The firm also has a 60-acre mixed-use\nretail project\ndeal with the city of Elgin, east of Austin.\nWhile no charges have been filed against the firm or Parsi, several sources told the outlet that interviews have been ongoing since October of last year, with queries about the firm\u2019s finances, business practices and questions about the firm\u2019s CEO, Shravan Parsi.\nHow and what investor funds were used for, specifically whether Parsi used investor money for personal expenses, as well as what fees investors were charged and if that lined up with what they were told they would be charged, are some of the questions sources confirmed were on the federal investigators\u2019 mind, sources said. Other questions arose about whether political donations were made with investor funds and other questions.\n\nBusinesses have some leeway with how and what they use funding for from investors, so long as those practices are clearly stipulated to them, said Christopher Yust, an associate professor of accounting at Texas A&amp;M University.\nAccording to SEC documents, $36 million was raised by Parsi and American Ventures from 236 investors since July 2023. Those funds were used to purchase\ndevelopable land\n, including the sites in fast-growing Elgin and San Marcos, along with a redevelopment project in the Dallas area and for land along South Congress Avenue in Austin. The inquiry specifically questioned whether \u201cdouble closings\u201d were used to purchase the land \u2014 where one entity purchases land and transfers it to another, prompting title and other associated fees \u2014 and whether investors were privy to the transactions.\nAmerican Ventures\u2019 previous developments include\nThe Draper\n, at 217 Garland Avenue in the Dallas suburb Garland. That 155-unit project was funded with a 2.96 percent interest rate HUD loan with a term of 40 years, according to the firm\u2019s website.\nWhether the\nSan Marcos\nproject is merely delayed or eventually scrapped remains to be seen, but that would leave undone a plan for nearly 1,200 multifamily units, 44 townhomes, 120 build-to-rent homes, a 130-key hotel, almost 145,000 square feet of office and retail space, and an option for the city to purchase half-a-dozen acres for a future baseball stadium in the balance.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Dallas is doing damage-control as AT&amp;T weighs a possible move of its global headquarters out of downtown.\nCity Manager Kimberly Tolbert told the Dallas Economic Development board this week that officials are \u201cactively working to ensure that the future of AT&amp;T is in the city of Dallas,\u201d the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The telecom giant has reportedly toured sites in Plano, Richardson and Irving, including the Park at Legacy, a 107-acre mixed-use corporate campus, located at 6501 Legacy Drive, the current home to JCPenney\u2019s\nheadquarters\n.\nAT&amp;T has made no public comment, but sources cited safety concerns and the push to shorten employee commutes after mandating a five-day office week.\nThe stakes are high: AT&amp;T is the second-largest public company in North Texas, with $122 billion in revenue and nearly 142,000 employees. It has anchored at the 37-story Whitacre Tower at 208 S. Ackard Street since 2008, and has a lease there until 2030. But if the company pulls up stakes the fallout could be seismic: a February report from Boston Consulting Group estimated that losing AT&amp;T could cut downtown property values by 30 percent, wiping out $62 million in annual property tax revenue.\n\nTolbert and Linda McMahon, CEO of the Dallas EDC, said they\u2019ve met with AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey and other executives in recent weeks as part of a broader retention strategy. EDC board chair Gilbert Gerst said at the Sept. 2 meeting AT&amp;T should be swayed to stay put in Dallas \u201cat all costs.\u201d While Gerst voiced a preference for keeping the HQ downtown, he stressed that city leaders would settle for anywhere inside Dallas\u2019 borders.\nAT&amp;T\u2019s hunt underscores that downtown Dallas has long struggled with public safety and commuter convenience. A headquarters shift north would follow a well-trodden path of corporate giants decamping for the\nsuburbs\n, echoing Toyota\u2019s move to\nPlano\nin 2017. But for Dallas officials, keeping AT&amp;T inside city lines is now as much about civic identity as tax base. McMahon said the company is \u201cpart of Dallas; they are integral to the city\u2019s very identity.\u201d\nWhether that identity remains tethered to downtown real estate \u2014 or migrates up the Tollway \u2014 will hinge on how far the city is willing to go to appease the telecom giant.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

He relocated to Houston in the 1990s and co-founded Land Tejas with partner Courtney Grover in 1997. In 28 years, Land Tejas has developed 15,000 acres of land and more than 20 communities in Houston.\nThe company is credited with introducing gates with guards to communities with entry-level homes.

        "content": "Trinsic Residential Group has teed up an apartment complex in the Dallas suburb of Mesquite, signaling a renewed interest in multifamily development after years of falling rents.\nThe Dallas-based developer estimates the 300-unit apartment complex, named Aura Fairways, will cost $28 million, according to a state filing. The filings are subject to change. The developer aims to start construction in November and complete the project at the end of 2027.\nThe 296,000-square-foot Aura Fairways, at 5201 Northwest Drive, is about five miles from Lake Ray Hubbard, a popular recreation destination. Mesquite is 15 miles northeast of downtown Dallas and has a population of almost 150,000.\nRising interest rates have ballooned development costs for multifamily developers, while a historic number of deliveries has put downward pressure on rents and occupancy. As a result, developers have pulled back on apartment-building.\n\nIn May, Dallas-Fort Worth reported a 1.5 percent decrease in rents, year-over-year, according to Yardi Matrix. The Metroplex\u2019s occupancy rate of 92.6 percent put it at third-lowest among the country\u2019s 30 largest cities.\nExperts are hopeful that the development slowdown will begin to push rents up by the end of 2025 or in 2026. The timing would be optimal for projects like Aura Fairways, allowing Trinisic to catch an upswing on rents around the project\u2019s opening.\nTrinsic was founded in 2011 by CEO Brian Tusa and COO Joe Barrett. The firm operates in Arizona, North Carolina, Colorado, Florida, Virginia and Texas.\nIn addition to Aura Fairways, it has five other DFW projects in the pipeline: Aura McKinney II, a 311-unit building at 7051 Stacy Road in McKinney; Aura Crown Heights and Aura Crown Center III, two 300-unit complexes at 2100 E. State Highway 121 in Lewisville; Aura Southgate II, a 303-unit project in Grand Prairie; and Aura Northline, a 32, a 305-unit complex at 521 J Place in Plano.\n",

        "content": "North Texas suburbs are testing the limits of a new state law aimed at making multifamily development easier.\nSenate Bill 840, signed by Gov. Greg Abbott in June, went into effect Sept. 1. The law overrides local zoning rules and allows developers to build apartments in more commercial districts, as part of an effort to spur more development and cool soaring housing costs.\nThe law applies to cities with populations over 150,000, a list that includes eight DFW cities: Arlington, Plano, Irving, Garland, Frisco, McKinney, Grand Prairie and Denton.\n\u201cMany local governments make it too slow and too expensive to build more housing,\u201d Abbott said at the signing.\nIrving, Arlington, Plano and Frisco have responded with measures that do just that. They\u2019ve tacked height mandates, stricter design standards and hefty amenity requirements to multifamily development, which critics say make many projects financially unworkable, the Texas Tribune\nreported\n.\nIn Irving, a basic three-story walkup is no longer legal. Developers must now build eight-story complexes with a pool, gym, coworking space and dog park, plus at least one extra perk like a yoga studio or bike-repair station.\nArlington\nis requiring six stories for some projects and mandating EV chargers in 15 percent of parking spaces. Plano added height minimums in commercial zones and new rules for energy efficiency. Frisco took the most creative approach, tweaking its zoning to pair apartments with heavy industrial use \u2014 a technicality that effectively blocks projects.\nLocal leaders argue the restrictions are about quality control and infrastructure strain, not obstruction.\n\nPlano Mayor John Muns told the outlet that, while he\u2019s always supported more housing in the city, taking away local authority prevents local communities from guiding projects in the way they see fit. In Plano, denser single-family housing types such as townhomes are now legal in some of the zoning locations that state law now encourages mixed-use and apartment developments.\nBut housing advocates say the rules gut the intent of the state law and risk worsening the shortage of an estimated 320,000 homes across Texas. Nicole Nosek, who chairs Texans for Reasonable Solutions, said her group is weighing lawsuits to force compliance.\nDevelopers, meanwhile, are sitting tight, waiting to see how the legal and political fight plays out before committing to\nnew projects\n. Multifamily construction could accelerate in Austin and Dallas, where officials appear more welcoming of the law, but in some cases, city leaders still want to have some say.\nIn August, Dallas City Council approved a contentious\nrezoning plan\nfor 35 acres in West Oak Cliff, a largely Hispanic neighborhood west of downtown, which calls for a ban on fast food drive-thrus and caps on building heights at 45 feet, enacting the ordinance just before the new state law took effect.\nBut in the suburbs that have long thrived on single-family sprawl, the standoff highlights how deeply entrenched the anti-apartment mindset remains \u2014 even as housing costs keep climbing.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

It was listed on May 8 for $3.25 million, removed from the MLS on Aug. 14, and relisted the next day asking $150,000 more.\nThe home went under contract after 117 cumulative days on the market. Benjamin Goudy of Texas Crossway Realty has the listing. Because the deal remains in the option period, the name of the buyer isn\u2019t available in public records yet.\nThe home is in the Zilker neighborhood, a centrally located area just south of the Colorado River and Zilker Park. It was built by the seller, Rivendale Homes, which bought the property last fall. It took out a construction loan on the property in February.\nA prior home on the property was appraised at almost $2.2 million in 2022, with the land alone accounting for $975,000. The land value dropped to $787,500 in 2025, according to appraisal records.\n\nRivendale bought the property from Douglas Hector, who owned it for 28 years. Before Hector, it was owned by Austin activist Shudde Fath, the first woman to win a sex discrimination case in Texas.\nGoudy didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, but Eklund Gomes agent Jeff Burke acknowledged that\nAustin luxury sector is a buyer\u2019s market\n\u2014 and added that the city \u201cis definitely slanting toward a buyer\u2019s market for all property types.\u201d\nThe shift is also smoking out some off-market listings, resulting in more listings on the MLS, Burke said.\n\u201cThat translates into people wanting maximum exposure for their listings, regardless of what they are,\u201d Burke said. \u201cA large portion of [luxury] single-family residences are bought and sold off market, but we\u2019re just getting more in the MLS than I think I\u2019ve seen in a while.\u201d\nAmong single-family properties listed for more than $2 million in Austin, homes that sold last week had a higher average number of days on the market, according to Unlock MLS data provided by Eklund Gomes.\n",

The 420,000-square-foot building was constructed in 1983.\nThe $93 million office-to-residential conversion project dubbed The Watt comes as industry experts and politicians struggle to find an answer to the surplus of aging office space that\u2019s plaguing office markets around the country.\nThe issue is\nacute in Houston\n, where there are 318 entirely empty office buildings and 625 that are less than 50 percent occupied, according to CoStar data. The vacancy rate for buildings completed before 2009 was 27.5 percent, according to the Greater Houston Partnership.\nEven so, the complex architectural engineering and costs associated with converting old office towers has prevented many landlords from taking on similar projects.\n\nThe Watt made financial sense, as the original building was\nacquired for $21 million\n($50 per square foot) in 2022 via online auction, which is far below replacement cost. The developer also saved money since the building already had a large parking garage and new mechanical equipment in the basement. Conversions cost about $300,000 per unit, DeBartolo\u2019s Scott Waddington said. It costs more than $500,000 a unit to build a ground-up multifamily development.\nThe Watt will feature a rooftop pool, coworking spaces, a yoga and fitness center, a bike storage room and a club lounge with a golf simulator, as well as pet-friendly amenities such as a pet washing station. Rents start at $1,968 for studios and go up to $4,375 for three-bedroom apartments.\nThe project will provide needed housing to the Energy Corridor, which has become a popular place for companies to plant their offices. About 71,000 people work in the area, but there\u2019s only 17,550 housing units, Zak Miller, manager of the Energy Corridor District, told the outlet.\nThis is the team\u2019s third conversion project. DeBartolo and Quinlan debuted Elev8 at 1801 Smith Street in 2024; it\u2019s currently 90 percent leased.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The company is building a second Fort Worth store at Sendera Ranch Boulevard and Rancho Canyon Way with a 2026 opening date. These two stores will serve Haslet and southeast Wise County.\nThe company also started construction in April on a store in Little Elm at U.S. Highway 380 and FM 2931. It\u2019s slated to start building a store in Anna at Rosamond Parkway and U.S. Highway 75 this fall.\nIn total, the four stores will span more than 120,000 square feet and the grocer estimates each will cost about $40 million. Kroger\u2019s John Votava told the outlet that the new stores will create 1,200 jobs.\nKroger is the second-largest grocery chain in the Metroplex behind Walmart. The region\u2019s rapid population growth has set off a competition for market share.\n\nSan Antonio-based H-E-B entered the Metroplex in 2022 with a Frisco location and now operates 14 stores throughout the region, with seven more in the works. In addition, the company operates six Central Market stores and two Joe V\u2019s Smart Shops with one on the way.\nBeyond stores officially on deck, H-E-B continues to make land plays in the area\u2019s growth corridors, like Pilot Point, where it recently\nbought 95 acres\n, and Sherman, where it\npurchased 20 acres\n.\nMeanwhile, Kroger is recovering from the meltdown of a potential merger with Alberson\u2019s. The $25 billion deal was blocked by a federal judge in December. As a result, Kroger has contracted, closing 60 stores across the country including one in\nMcKinney\nat 1707 West University Drive.\nKroger entered the Metroplex in 1958 and has about 100 stores in Dallas-Fort Worth.

Hunt founded Hunt Oil Company after purchasing 5,580 acres of the 140,000-acre East Texas Oil Field, and his life story inspired the character J. R. Ewing on the show Dallas .\nThe Hunt family fortune is widespread, with\u00a0 Rosewood Hotels &amp; Resorts, founded by Hunt\u2019s daughter Caroline, among the higher-profile assets.\nH.L.\u2019s son Lamar Hunt, was instrumental in founding the American Football League, with ownership of a football team in Dallas that soon became the Kansas City Chiefs. And the AFL soon merged with the NFL, becoming half of the Super Bowl.\nToday, the family is worth an estimated $25 billion.\nHill Washburne married Ray, a Southern Methodist University grad whose family hails from Chicago and includes Ray\u2019s great-grandfather\nHempstead Washburne\n, mayor of Chicago in the 1890s.\nWashburne is best known for two things: buying the high-end outdoor mall Highland Park Village (along with his wife, her sister Elisa Hill Summers and Elisa\u2019s husband Stephen) and co-founding Tex-Mex chain Mi Cocina.\nThe group purchased Highland Park Village in 2009 for $170 million and transformed it into a shopping destination for the who\u2019s who of Dallas.\n\nToday, it\u2019s home to private, members-only club Park House, Dallas\u2019 version of Soho House.\nHe\u2019s also a player in the multibillion dollar transformation of the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center, a project that aims to revitalize the city\u2019s downtrodden urban core.\nWashburne purchased the nearby former Dallas Morning News building in 2019 for $28 million with plans to convert it to a mixed-use district, but threatened to sell it to a data center provider in order to\nflip the site to the city for over $50 million\n.\nHe\u2019ll still be involved though he sold the property, as he also purchased the\nnearby Greyhound bus terminal\nin 2024. The station will close this fall, unlocking the redevelopment potential of the site.\nA few miles north, Washburne is part of a supergroup cashing in on the luxury development of Dallas\u2019 Knox-Henderson neighborhood. He\u2019s partnering with Trammell Crow Company to\ndevelop Knox &amp; McKinney\n, a 300,000, 12-story office building at 4544 McKinney Avenue.\nOutside of real estate, Washburne is a Republican operative and fundraiser, serving in the first Trump administration as president of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. He helped create the agency\u2019s replacement, the International Development Finance Corporation, in 2018 and headed that organization until 2019.\nHe also has displayed political dexterity, going from finance chairman for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie\u2019s campaign to vice chairman of the Trump Victory Committee in 2016.\nPolitico\nreported\nthat he met with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick \u2014 the former chairman of Newmark and Cantor Fitzgerald \u2014 during the most recent presidential transition to advise on Trump\u2019s cabinet pick for head of the Energy Department.\n",

        "content": "Dell Technologies is putting more money into its Texas headquarters, even as it trims its global headcount.\nThe tech giant is planning a $25 million expansion over the next five years at its campus in Round Rock, Austin\u2019s largest suburb. Round Rock City Council unanimously approved Dell\u2019s nomination as a qualified enterprise project under the Texas Enterprise Zone Program, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe designation makes the company eligible for state sales tax refunds worth up to $1.25 million if it follows through on its capital commitments and job retention goals. Round Rock officials said Dell\u2019s project will include real estate and equipment investments across the 1 Dell Way campus, including new construction and renovations. In 2024, the nearly 900,000-square-foot office property was appraised at $81.1 million for tax purposes.\nThe company\u2019s application said 500 jobs are tied to the incentive program, but they\u2019ll mostly be from retention rather than new hires. Dell committed to filling at least 35 percent of new or replacement roles with economically disadvantaged workers, veterans or residents of enterprise zones. While Dell hasn\u2019t updated its\nRound Rock\nheadcount recently, it previously employed about 13,000 in the area before companywide layoffs in 2023 and 2024.\n\nThe move comes at a paradoxical moment for Dell. On Aug. 28, the company reported record quarterly revenue of $29.8 billion, up 19 percent year-over-year thanks to demand for AI-related products, and raised its full-year revenue outlook to $107 billion. But investors weren\u2019t impressed: Dell shares dropped more than 10 percent the day after the earnings release. Meanwhile, Dell has cut its global workforce by 10 percent each of the past two years, shedding about 25,000 jobs since early 2023.\nThe move to reinvest in the region comes as other companies weigh their future presence in Austin.\nIn Downtown Austin, Meta began the process of\nsubleasing\nsome of its space at Sixth and Guadalupe, securing a subtenant for the 32nd floor. Meta pre-leased the 33 floors at 400 West 6th Street Meta but never moved in. Indeed also\nlooked to shed five floors\n\u2014184,000 square feet of Class A space \u2014 at the Domain.\nThe expansion reaffirms Round Rock\u2019s reliance on Dell as its largest employer. Chamber officials said the company has been nominated for enterprise zone status five times before, and recent filings with state regulators point to multiple construction and renovation projects already underway at the campus.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "As Leon Melohn plots a development for Gravesend, he\u2019s ready to bury his condo unit on the Upper West Side.\nThe developer listed his unit at 535 West End Avenue for $15.9 million, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The asking price of the 8,500-square-foot full-floor condo breaks down to $1,870 per square foot.\nMelohn and his wife aren\u2019t asking for a premium on what they paid for the unit in 2019, when they plunked down $15.7 million for the condo.\nThe unit includes seven bedrooms and seven-and-a-half bathrooms. There\u2019s a combined living and dining room, a kitchen with custom finishes and a home office that was once a library. Perhaps most valuable is the deeded parking space in the building\u2019s garage.\nCorcoran Group\u2019s Santiago Steele has the\nlisting\n. Steele did not comment to the publication, nor did anyone linked to Melohn.\n\nThe listing comes as Melohn turns his focus towards a neighborhood-shaping project in another borough that\u2019s in the early stages.\nEarlier this summer, an entity that appeared to be tied to Melohn Properties filed an application with the Department of City Planning to rezone the land at 4302 Westshore Avenue in Gravesend, Brooklyn, which is being used as car storage.\nThe\nproposed project\nwould span 1.5 million square feet and include 1,457 residential units \u2014 roughly 430 of which would be affordable \u2014 as well as 24 townhomes. The two high-rise buildings would also include 10,000 square feet of retail space, 80,000 square feet of community facility space, 143,000 square feet of open space and nearly 1,000 parking spaces.\nBack in Manhattan, the Melohn Group and Safehold\nlanded $167 million\nin debt to refinance the leased fee interest in the ground lease of the 36-story property at 32 Old Slip in the Financial District.

        "content": "When receiver TrigGild took over Chicago\u2019s Edison Apartments on 5200 North Sheridan Road through a court-ordered sale in early 2023, things should have been looking up for the troubled Edgewater apartment building. But the situation got much worse before it got better.\nThe property had previously been owned by a venture of Spirit Investment and The Bascom Group before the owners defaulted on their $43 million mortgage in 2022 and got hit with a foreclosure lawsuit.\nThen a year after TriGild took over, a fire broke out at The Edison and tenants complained that a faulty alarm system had put their lives at risk. In the aftermath of the fire, two residents were hospitalized and a tenant\u2019s cat died.\nShortly after the fire, Boston-based Berkshire Residential Investments bought the property in a foreclosure auction and took out a $26.5 million loan against the property. Spirit and Bascom\u2019s former lender,\nMF1\n, seemed to decide the bet was worth making again and issued the new loan to Berkshire \u2014 amounting to essentially a $13.5 million writedown in principal on the property for the lender.\nIn a Midwest multifamily market that has been making headlines for strong rent growth, a rising tide isn\u2019t necessarily raising all boats.\nSome owners of properties that fell into\ndistress as interest rates rose\nover the past few years have scored lucky breaks via\ndown-to-the-wire refinancing deals\n. But other properties, like The Edison, faced a rocky road to recovery and some still haven\u2019t found new owners.\nBuyers who jump in to save the day can score a discount in this sought-after market, but not all deals are equal, said Daniel Levy, president of Chicago\u2019s chapter of the Turnaround Management Association, a network of professionals who deal with distressed assets.\n\u201cWhat seems like it could be a bargain basement price, really may not be. It\u2019s just a question of someone making different assumptions about how long it\u2019s going to be to get that building stabilized,\u201d he said.\nThe property owners mentioned in this article did not respond to requests for comment and one couldn\u2019t be reached. A representative of Ares Management declined to comment.\nForeclosure fallout\nAt least three distressed multifamily properties in Chicago tracked by\nThe Real Deal\nover the past three years have yet to find new owners. All of them are either still in the hands of a lender or receiver or are awaiting a foreclosure auction.\nSome lenders seem to be keeping the assets for now either because they can\u2019t find a buyer or because they see an advantage to holding onto the property for the time being.\nAt 1411 South Michigan Avenue, an affiliate of Ares Management called AREEIF Lender LLC filed\nan $80 million foreclosure complaint\nagainst Russland Capital, a Chicago-based development firm led by Felix Friedman. Ares\nseized the property\nin May 2024 and sold off the ground level medical office space to IRA Capital for $22 million but held onto the apartments above.\nHad the developer, Russland, kept the property, it likely would have sold off the ground-floor space itself, to recoup some carrying costs while looking to sell the multifamily portion, Levy said.\n\u201c[The lender] moved quickly to do that because they knew they could,\u201d Levy said of the ground-floor sale to IRA.\nWhen foreclosed properties do trade hands, some new buyers end up with bargains at an increasingly\ncompetitive time for the market\nacross the spectrum of asset size. Far from the shadows cast by downtown apartment towers, there has been plenty of financial pain that\u2019s luring new buyers to smaller buildings on the South and West sides.\nChicago-based Optimus Realty bought 2900 East 79th Street in South Shore after lenders foreclosed on the property in late 2024, public records show. Optimus bought the property for a steep discount at $400,000. It last sold for $2 million in 2021. The building, however, may have previously traded at an inflated value amid\na fix-and-flip scheme gone wrong\n.\nEscape artists\nSeveral properties at risk of foreclosure have scored much needed refinancing or were sold in the nick of time.\n\nAt 500 Station Boulevard in Aurora, Houston-based investor Amit Goel was struggling to turn a profit on a high-interest, $130 million loan from MF1. Ahead of its May 2024 maturity, the property was only generating enough income to cover 58 percent of its debt service costs, according to loan servicer reports.\nBut Goel pulled in a $130 million refinancing from Bridge Investment Group in July. The deal came on the heels of\na recent series of Chicago multifamily refinancing deals\nboth on and off the CMBS market.\nAfter facing thin margins, Noah Properties, the Chicago-based development team founded by the husband-and-wife duo Bart Przyjemski and Anita Lisek, recently\nsold The Avondale\n. An out-of-state buyer purchased the 52-unit townhome property at 4200 West Belmont Avenue for $34 million.\nThe buyer, who has not been identified in public records yet, plans to convert the property into condos, according to Kiser Group, which brokered the sale on behalf of both sides of the deal.\n\u201cThey were originally intended to be for-sale condos, and the market wasn\u2019t there for them in 2022, when it was still the tail-end of the pandemic, and Noah filled it up with renters,\u201d Kiser\u2019s Andy Friedman, who represented the buyer in the Avondale deal, said at the time of the sale.\nPrior to the sale, loan data showed The Avondale generated nearly $2.3 million in revenue last year and was 94 percent leased, but with over $800,000 in operating expenses and $2.4 million in debt service costs on a Ready Capital collateralized loan obligation deal, it wasn\u2019t turning a profit.\nWhile The Avondale features larger units than standard Chicago apartment buildings, making it more amenable to condos, conversions are unlikely to be the right route out of distress for most other properties \u2014 though\nCrescent Heights is giving it a go at 850 North Lake Shore Drive\nafter buying it for a massive discount.\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the strategy that jumps to the top of my mind,\u201d Levy said of turning rentals to condos. \u201cInterest rates are so high, they\u2019re putting a dampener on the residential housing market.\u201d\nToeing the line\nWhen interest rate hikes began in 2022, some otherwise\nstrong assets became a headache\nfor owners.\nTake Torchlight Investor\u2019s City View at The Highlands apartment complex in suburban Lombard, for example. The property ran into trouble last year when debt service costs on the $73.5 million CMBS loan backed by the property began to outpace revenue generated by the apartments. The debt service costs increased because the loan\u2019s floating rate had surged from 4.8 percent to 7.9 percent, according to CMBS loan tracking platform Morningstar Credit.\nEven though Chicago\u2019s hot suburban multifamily market helped drive the complex to achieve 94 percent occupancy, it still was not generating enough income to cover debt costs. Now, a year later, the building\u2019s debt service coverage ratio, or DSCR, has improved from 0.88 to 1.02. In other words, it\u2019s bringing in just enough revenue to exceed expenses. With a loan maturity date of January 2032, the apartments are running on thin margins but in the clear for now.\nThe market\u2019s strong fundamentals have helped push up rents and maintain demand. Over the past year, three other multifamily properties tracked by\nThe Real Deal\nhave pushed their DSCR above their breakeven points, and started to eke out a profit.\nMeanwhile, three multifamily properties tracked over the same time period haven\u2019t improved their DSCRs enough to turn a profit.\nAt 2625 North Clark Street, Strategic Properties of North America, also known as SPNA, has had its ratio stuck below breakeven since 2023. There is still time for a turnaround because its floating rate, $36.7 million loan doesn\u2019t mature until January 2032, Morningstar Credit shows.\nBut the firm, which specializes in condo deconversions, has been struggling in recent years. Over the past two years, two condo boards working with SPNA have\ncanceled buyout deals\ntotaling $185 million due to slow financing progress.\nProperties to watch\nSome more distressed properties to watch are\ntwo student housing complexes\nnear Roosevelt University and The University of Illinois at Chicago.\nLandlord Versity, led by Brian Nelson, has been delinquent on payments for The Buckingham and the Tailor Lofts in Chicago since July, loan servicer data shows.\nNelson said last month he is working with the lenders to resume the payments and that a separate legal dispute between himself and other Versity executives had caused the delay.\nVersity could forge another comeback because the loans for the Buckingham and the Tailor Lofts don\u2019t mature until 2028 and 2029, respectively. But If the payments don\u2019t get back on track, lenders could come knocking.",

An LLC managed by Azrad\u2019s partner\nEddie Yair purchased the land\nin February of that year for $10.1 million.\n\nThere were several other projects in the neighborhood being developed around the same time and Sheepshead Bay\nremains of interest\nto real estate investors.\nThis year, a group led by ABS Partners\u2019 Randy Modell and Steven Hornstock\nsecured final approvals\nto construct a nine-story building with 380 units and more than 43,600 square feet of commercial space at 2185 Coyle Street.\nIn late 2023, Marvin Azrak\u2019s Maguire Capital bought 49 unsold condominium units at Chaim Miller\u2019s former condo project at 3144 Emmons Avenue.\nAnd last year, Slate paid $24.3 million to buy a development site at 2114-2134 Coyle Street from Marty Waisbrod, where it was planning to develop a 125,000-square-foot, seven-story building.\nBrooklyn\u2019s current rental market is not far removed from its median all-time high of $3,950, set in July 2023. It\u2019s held relatively steady since then, recording a median of $3,850 this July, according to data from Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "On Thursday morning, Giorgio Armani announced the death of its namesake at 91 years old. His legacy in the world of fashion is virtually unrivaled as he built an empire that changed the industry, both in Italy and across the world.\nLess acknowledged is Armani\u2019s legacy in the world of real estate, which includes an assembly of lavish homes, a sprawling retail footprint and a dalliance in branded residences.\nOn the personal property front, Armani assembled a legion of luxury properties in far-flung corners of the world. He had an apartment in his hometown of Milan, but could escape to the island of Pantelleria at a moment\u2019s notice. He owned seven homes on the island, according to\nRealtor.com\n, including Cala Gadir, which he purchased in 1979.\nIf Armani needed to go farther to escape, he could always go to Saint Tropez. Vogue Australia\nstopped by\nhis home there in 2015, nearly 20 years after Armani purchased and began redesigning the property.\nArmani also owned a pair of villas on the cliffside of Antigua, an island in the Caribbean. He purchased the villas known as Villa Flower and Villa Serena in 2006, making sure each was outfitted with a swimming pool, gym, spa, terrace and interior decor curated by Armani Casa.\n\nArmani lived stateside, too. In 2019, Armani purchased a Central Park West condo from outgoing T-Mobile chief executive officer John Legere for $19.5 million, the Wall Street Journal reported. The one-time home of William Randolph Hearst was on the same floor as an apartment Armani already owned.\nOf course, one of the more visible real estate signposts of Armani\u2019s legacy are the many storefronts his brands occupy. As of March, there were nearly 200 Armani stores in the United States, according to\nScrapeHero\n, including 37 in California and 15 in New York City.\nThen, there\u2019s the commercial real estate aspect.\nThe Giorgio Armani Residences at 760 Madison Avenue in Manhattan remains\na top performer\nin the market. The building scored the city\u2019s top weekly luxury contract four times over the last year. Sales launched in the summer of 2023 and quickly hit sellout status. Sale prices for the 10 units averaged just under $5,000 per square foot. Amenities at the building include a fitness center, landscaped terrace and residents\u2019 lounge.\nThis fall, a development team, led by Vertical Developments, WellDuo, GCF Development and SP Developments was in the process of\nlaunching sales\nat the Armani/Casa Residences Pompano Beach, the second South Florida condo project for the luxury Italian brand.\nThe Armani brand was looking at residences beyond the United States\u2019 borders, too. Last month, the luxury house released plans for branded residences in Ras Al Khaimah in the United Arab Emirates, Hypebeast\nreported\n.",

        "content": "A nearly 100-year-old Winneka mansion sold for a record $31.3 million, the highest Chicagoland home resale price ever.\nThe 13,894-square-foot home sits on 2.3 acres of Lake Michigan shoreline and was originally built in a French Renaissance Revival-style.\nIt\u2019s now known as Windsor House because the mansion was originally owned by Popular Mechanics magazine publisher Henry H. Windsor Jr. and Louise Hunter Windsor. It was built in 1928 and designed by architect Ernest Mayo.\nThe seller on the recent deal was retired investment banker\nMuneer Satter\n, formerly of Goldman Sachs, and his wife Kristen Hertel. They first purchased the property in 2002 for $9.5 million, and added an adjacent property in 2013 for $4.1 million, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. The asking price was over $2,500 per square foot. The actual sale price was around $2,253 per square foot.\nThey spent far more on improvements and renovation during their tenure with the property. Satter and Hertel spent between $65 million and $72 million to create the estate, located at 419 Sheridan Road, which now includes 223 feet of private beachfront, a boathouse and an infinity pool. They first listed the property in August 2024.\nJena Radnay\nof @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate was the listing agent.\nSatter and Hertel first listed the 22-room property for $35 million in an agent\u2019s-only network. The buyer was a land trust and public records do not reveal any benefactor.\n\nBond trader Keith Rudman, who sold the estate to the couple in 2002, purchased it in 1993 for $2.8 million.\nThis sale surpasses previous high-priced real estate transactions in the Chicago area, which typically involved the assembly of multiple properties rather than a single residential resale of this magnitude. For example, businessman Justin Ishbia spent $33.7 million to acquire three lakefront homes in Winnetka for a new mansion now under construction, and Citadel hedge fund founder\nKen Griffin\nspent $58.8 million in separate transactions for unfinished units on the top four floors of 9 West Walton Street, a Chicago condo building. Filmmaker\nGeorge Lucas\nand Mellody Hobson also combined penthouses in a Chicago tower for an estimated total cost of $33.5 million.\nBut no single residential property has resold in Chicagoland for more than $22 million.\nAnother historic lakefront mansion in Kenilworth, also listed by Radnay for that North Shore suburb\u2019s record price of $15 million, is currently under contract for an undisclosed price.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Austin\u2019s Endeavor Real Estate Group just planted a flag in Dallas, scooping up a Preston Hollow property in an off-market deal that gives the firm its first mixed-use property in the city.\nThe firm purchased Preston Sherry Plaza, a 165,000-square-foot complex at 8201 Preston Road, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. Terms of the deal weren\u2019t disclosed, but the complex was last valued at $63 million, according to the Dallas Central Appraisal District. Seattle-based Unico Properties was the previous owner.\nThe seven-story building at 8201 Preston Road includes two floors of retail and five floors of office space, with tenants ranging from Hilltop Securities and Frost Bank to plastic surgeons and dermatologists. Sevy\u2019s Grill, a longtime Preston Hollow power-lunch haunt, anchors the ground floor. The property, built in 1986 and renovated this year, is 93 percent leased. JLL handled financing and will lead leasing, while Dallas-based Four River Capital is a partner on the deal.\nEndeavor\n, which controls $5.6 billion in assets, is best known for\nreshaping\nAustin with projects like\nThe Domain\nand Southpark Meadows. It recently tapped Dallas veteran Andrew Levy from JLL to run capital markets and brought in Zach Johnston to grow multifamily in North Texas. The firm is already building a 780-unit student housing project at Texas Christian University called Morado on Berry with Robert A.M. Stern Architects.\n\nThe Preston Hollow buy underscores Endeavor\u2019s Sun Belt strategy as it looks for \u201cthoughtful upgrades\u201d to boost tenant experience in one of Dallas\u2019 priciest office and retail pockets. The property\u2019s location near Southern Methodist University, Love Field Airport and the high-end Preston Center cluster adds cachet, even as Dallas\u2019 broader office market remains under pressure.\nPreston Hollow\u2019s blend of wealth, schools and\nretail\nkeeps landlords optimistic, and CoStar data shows rents in the submarket ranging from $50 to $61 per square foot for upscale retail \u2014 among the highest in Dallas. The area is also not far from Preston Center\u2019s nearby office towers.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The corporate headquarters of camera company GoPro is turning into housing.\nHarvest Properties and Stockbridge Capital Group acquired the Clearview Business Park in San Mateo in an off-market transaction for $102 million, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. The 22-acre office campus at 3000-3155 Clearview Way spans 379,615 square feet and consists of six buildings and surface and structured parking.\nOakland-based Harvest Properties and San Francisco-based Stockbridge plan to re-entitle the Clearview Business Park as a 225-unit for-sale residential community of townhomes and single family homes. A 15 percent portion of the homes will be set aside for low-income households. In San Mateo County, low-income is\ndefined\nas making a maximum of 80 percent of area median income, or $108,300 annually.\nThe corporate campus, built in 1973, is partially leased to GoPro. The company will occupy the space until its lease expires next year, though it\u2019s unclear where it will relocate its operations. Prior to GoPro moving in in 2011, the campus served as the headquarters for Visa International.\nAs large multifamily projects across the Bay Area are paused amid rising construction costs and high interest rates, the low-density townhomes and single-family homes will help fill a gap in San Mateo housing. The effort \u201cresponds directly to two regional realities \u2014 the ongoing housing shortage and the structural challenges facing the office market,\u201d Preston O\u2019Connell, partner at Harvest Properties, said in a\nstatement\n.\n\n\u201cProjects like this are rare, but they\u2019re essential to expanding the for-sale housing supply and creating opportunities for current and future San Mateans,\u201d Tyler Issadore, senior director at Harvest Properties, said.\nThe office market across the Peninsula has seen seven consecutive quarters of negative net absorption, according to Colliers data cited by the Chronicle. In San Mateo, the office vacancy rate sits at 24.1 percent, per Kidder &amp; Matthews\u2019 second-quarter\nreport\n. That\u2019s above the national rate of 20.8 percent, per\nCushman &amp; Wakefield\n, but below San Francisco\u2019s soaring office vacancy\nrate\nof 34.8 percent.\nThe Clearview Business Park redevelopment plan marks the second office campus Harvest Properties is converting into housing. The company is working on the 26-acre, 290-home Peninsula Heights project in San Mateo.\nThe city of San Mateo is required to build 7,015 new units of housing by 2031 as part of its\nHousing Element\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Developer Harvey Hernandez switched lanes for his latest project, a planned luxury car condo building with an indoor padel club, concierge and events.\nHernandez\u2019s\nNewgard Development Group paid $8.2 million for the block at 7400 to 7410 Northeast Miami Court, 40 Northeast 75th Street and 19 Northeast 74th Street in Miami, according to the developer and broker involved in the deal. The properties total 1.2 acres.\nNewgard plans to build Revault Miami, a mixed-use luxury car condo building with climate-controlled private garages; a padel club on the second floor with four courts, lounges, a cafe and sauna and steam rooms; a members\u2019 lounge and event spaces, Hernandez said.\nHernandez plans to build more Revault locations in Florida and other parts of the Sun Belt region.\nThe 16-unit car condo building in Little River will have units averaging 2,000 square feet with 22-foot ceilings that will fit stackers to accommodate more cars. Up to nine cars will fit in the average unit, Hernandez said. Condo sales will launch in the next few weeks. He declined to disclose pricing.\n\u201cI did it out of necessity,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cI started collecting cars and I couldn\u2019t find a community for it, a purposefully designed space for collectors in the urban core. We don\u2019t need a 10,000-square-foot warehouse, we just need a cool studio.\u201d\nHernandez said his collection includes some Porsches, older BMWs and Mercedes-Benz cars.\n\nConstruction could begin next year and take about a year to complete, he said.\nOnly a few other\nluxury car condo buildings\nexist in South Florida, including Gables Auto Vault in Miami, near Coral Gables.\nVirgilio Fernandez and Alain Crego of Collins represented the seller, Robinson Julien, in the larger piece of the Little River assemblage, according to a release. Newgard represented itself. The site has flexible zoning and could qualify for Live Local Act incentives. It\u2019s also in an Opportunity Zone.\nA handful of large-scale, mixed-use developments could transform Miami\u2019s Little River and the nearby Little Haiti neighborhood, including dozens of new mid-rise and high-rise buildings that could add more than 10,000 apartments and more than 1 million square feet of commercial space.\nThe neighborhoods benefit from their location, just east of I-95, close to Miami Beach, Morningside, Bay Point, Miami Shores and other areas.\nHernandez, a condo developer, is co-developing Lofty Brickell and the adjacent\nStandard Residences, Brickell\nwith Two Roads Development. This summer, Newgard was\nhit with a foreclosure lawsuit\nfrom Kushner Companies over the loan backing a mixed-use condo tower site in Fort Lauderdale.\n",

        "content": "Brookfield\u2019s distressed EY Plaza is back on the market for $275 million, more than double what Carolwood was set to pay for the 41-story office tower before a\ndeal\nfell apart.\nThe Real Deal\npreviously\nreported\nthe sale collapsed.\nIt appears Colliers replaced Eastdil Secured in marketing the property, according to an offering memorandum. The $275 million is for the non-performing loan connected to the property that was placed in receivership two years ago after a massive debt default. Colliers has been managing the property.\nThe deal, a receiver\u2019s sale, would cover lenders on the $275 million commercial mortgage-backed securities\ndebt\nconnected to the 41-story office tower at 725 South Figueroa Street, but not the $30 million mezzanine loan that encompasses the rest of the debt.\nStill, it\u2019s more than what the offices are worth. The 900,000-square-foot office property is valued at $150 million, after an appraisal last year, compared to $446 million four years earlier when the debt was issued, per Morningstar data.\n\n\u201cThis sale offers investors the opportunity to acquire this non-performing loan at a massive discount to note balance, historic trades in DTLA going back decades, and estimated replacement cost of over $750 per square foot,\u201d the memo reads. It notes the offices are 61 percent leased to 27 tenants.\nThat includes the office tower\u2019s anchor tenant for which it is named after, Ernst &amp; Young, who has occupied the property since 1999. The company\u2019s lease spans 128,000 square feet, about 14 percent of the total space, per Morningstar.\nWhen\nTRD\nlearned Adam Rubin and Andrew Shanfeld\u2019s Carolwood fell out of contract and the office tower would make a return to market, servicer commentary indicated that it was \u201cunable to negotiate acceptable documentation with the selected buyer.\u201d A month earlier, the special servicer said a buyer was selected, approvals were obtained and documentation had commenced.\n",

        "content": "Brokerage veteran Mark McLaughlin has transitioned to a part-time mergers and acquisitions adviser role at Compass, after his two-year contract as\nchief real estate strategist\nat the brokerage ended.\nMcLaughlin, who served as Compass California president between September 2018 and December 2020, returned to the firm in July 2023 in a new role focused mostly on coaching and, as McLaughlin described, to \u201cstreamline operations.\u201d During that two-year term, which he said ended in late June, McLaughlin also served as interim president of brokerage operations between July and October of last year.\n\u201cI said, \u2018Hey, I really want to go and enjoy my life and retire,\u2019\u201d McLaughlin told\nThe Real Deal\n, saying a deal was worked out to stay on in an advisory role. \u201cI know a lot of CEOs around the country. I can generally pick up the phone with any one of them and have a conversation and so that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. How long will I do it? I\u2019d say at least a year.\u201d\nA Compass spokesperson confirmed in a statement McLaughlin will \u201ccontinue to focus on strategic growth initiatives, working in areas where he has already been contributing his expertise.\u201d\nThe executive\u2019s experience came in handy over the past two years amid an environment of high interest rates and a cooling off of the pandemic-induced run-up in dealmaking.\n\u201cWe had to transform the business and I think instinctively everybody knew what had to be done, but my experience running the fifth-largest firm in the country up until 2018 just brought a level of confidence,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cI really came back as a coach, and I think it served the organization very well.\u201d\n\nMcLaughlin was CEO of San Francisco-based\nPacific Union International\nstarting in 2009 when the brokerage was generating $2 billion in volume and had a loss of $3.7 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. When Compass bought Pacific Union in 2018, the business had scaled through a dozen acquisitions with annual volume jumping to $14 billion and $14 million in EBITDA, an accomplishment the executive touts on the website for his venture fund\nMcLaughlin Ventures\n.\nThe executive said the highlight of his recently ended run at Compass was the move to reduce expenditures, while still serving agents. More specifically, there was increased local decision making, with office managers across the U.S. creating their own profit-and-loss statements from which adjustments could be made.\n\u201cIt was leading with the facts, empowering the field and making sure that we didn\u2019t compromise our agent services to be able to make money in one of the worst markets that we\u2019ve seen,\u201d McLaughlin said.\nEven with the industry in a rugged stretch, McLaughlin still expects a comparable, if not more robust, M&amp;A pipeline as what\u2019s been had in the past two years. Consolidation, he said, will continue across brokerages and associated services, such as mortgage and title firms.\nOn that point, Compass announced Thursday it acquired Colorado Home Realty, a brokerage in Littleton, Colorado, with $617.2 million in 2024 sales volume. The business was launched in 2005 and is helmed by co-founder and CEO Matt Hudson.\n",

The property at 1028 South De Anza Boulevard was built in 1974 and consists of 164 units. The deal with the undisclosed seller works out to $317,000 per unit.\nSack Capital Partners\u2019 portfolio includes approximately 3,000 apartments and condominiums in 15 cities across the Western United States. Las Palmas Housing is a real estate-focused nonprofit dedicated to \u201cacquiring, developing, rehabilitating and supporting affordable housing\u201d with an emphasis on senior and family residents, according to its website.\nSan Jose has seen several multifamily housing transactions this summer, the most recent being earlier this week.\nReal estate firm Standard Communities, nonprofit Housing on Merit and investment company Vistria Real Estate teamed up to buy the\nPark Kiely Apartments\nfrom a Graystar affiliate for $370 million. That marks the priciest amount paid for a residential property in Santa Clara County so far this year with the 948-unit complex at 355 Kiely Avenue going for $390,300 per unit.\n\nIn June, Los Angeles-based real estate firm Post Glen Group and Newport Beach-based nonprofit Affordable Housing Access bought the\nOrchard Glen\napartments in south San Jose for $61.1 million. The property at 3975 Seven Trees Boulevard was built in 1978 and encompasses 288 units across nearly a dozen two-story buildings.\nThese properties have various income restrictions in place for renters. In San Jose, low-income residents make 80 percent or less of the\narea median income\n, or $111,700 for one person or $159,550 for a household of four.\nLuxury apartment properties in San Jose have also sold in recent months.\nIn May, an affiliate of Houston-based Hines bought a 108-unit apartment complex in the Santana Row commercial and residential district for $73.9 million. The\nLevare\nproperty at 3003 Olin Road spans two four-story buildings. Last month, Federal Realty Investment Trust began preparing to sell the 212-unit\nMisora\ncomplex in Santana Row.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

Prime bought the portfolio for a combined $187 million in 2017.\nDrew Anderman of CBRE Capital Markets\u2019 Debt &amp; Structured Finance arranged the financing, along with Eddie Haber, AJ Bruno and Jared Fried.\nHeadquartered in Saratoga Springs, Prime Group is the country\u2019s largest investor in self-storage, channeling $264 million into the sector last year, according to a\nStorageCafe report\n. In June 2024, Prime announced that it had acquired 30 storage properties comprising about 1.7 million rentable square feet across 10 states. In December, it purchased a heavily discounted West Chelsea office building for $50 million, for which it plans a combination of self-storage and traditional office space.\n\nA representative for Prime Group could not be immediately reached for comment.\nThe loan covers three Prime Storage facilities with just over 7,200 units between them: a 104,200-square-foot property at 1084 Rockaway Avenue in Brooklyn, a 96,400-square-foot property at 1260 Zerega Avenue in the Bronx, and a 158,300-square-foot property at 31-07 20th Avenue in Queens.\nSelf-storage has fielded mounting investor interest in recent years, according to Anderman, who arranged the deal. \u201cMore lenders are lending on it versus seven or eight years ago when self-storage wasn\u2019t as well known as multifamily, hospitality, retail and so forth,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s an asset class that typically does well in cities with large renter populations (\n69 percent\nof New Yorkers rent) and a tight vacancy rate (\n0.7 percent\nin New York City). Plus, self-storage tends to have low turnover.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a long occupancy that usually exists for people storing things,\u201d said Anderman. \u201cIt\u2019s out of sight, out of mind.\u201d",

The couple sold the home at 1214 North Ocean Boulevard earlier this week, Zillow shows. The deal has yet to hit public records and the buyer is unknown.\nJames Kenny with K2 Realty, who specializes in the gated North Palm Beach golf community Lost Tree Village, brought the buyer. Christian Angle with Christian Angle Real Estate had the listing. He did not respond to requests for comment.\nSculley was CEO of Apple from 1983 to 1993, during which time he grew sales from $800 million to $8 billion, according to the\nNew York Times\n. Prior to that, he presided over PepsiCo, and is credited with creating the Pepsi Challenge. Following his run at Apple, Sculley briefly led Spectrum Information Technologies and was a founding investor in MetroPCS. Jeff Daniels portrayed him in the 2015 film \u201cSteve Jobs.\u201d\n\nThe Sculleys married in 2013. In 2018, they bought the oceanfront house at 1214 North Ocean Boulevard for\n$14.9 million\n. The 6,500-square-foot home was built in 2015 and has five bedrooms, six bathrooms and one half-bathroom. In 2023, the Sculleys bought the adjacent house at 110 Mockingbird Trail in an off-market deal for\n$11.4 million\n, expanding their property to a full acre. In total, they spent $26.3 million on the property.\nThe couple demolished the Mockingbird Trail home and last year\nproposed\na 2,725-square-foot addition for the North Ocean Boulevard house and a new 1,800-square-foot guest house on the property, but have not built them. The estate also has a private beachfront cabana, according to the listing.\nThey listed the home for $54.9 million in January, Zillow shows. In March, they slashed the asking price to $49.5 million. The sale price equates to a 33 percent drop from the first asking price.\nSummer is typically a slow time for home sales in\nPalm Beach\n, but deals still close. In July, Hellman Jordan founder Jerry Jordan and his wife, Darlene Jordan, sold their lakefront estate for\n$86.5 million\n, making it the island\u2019s most expensive home sale so far this year. Beauty billionaire William Lauder sold 2.3 acres of oceanfront land for more than $160 million in February, but the compound is vacant. It\u2019s part of a\n$350 million assemblage\nthat sources say is linked to Excel creator Charles Simonyi.\nAmong other summer deals, private equity executives J. Richard Knop and Leslee Belluchie sold their home at 110 Wells Road in June for\n$17.9 million\n, down from their $28.5 million listing price. That same month, home improvement star Bob Vila sold his waterfront Palm Beach home for\n$33 million\n, down from his $52.9 million asking price.",

In July, Harvest Properties announced it was\npausing a proposed expansion\nof a research and development campus in Emeryville as the life science market remains in limbo in the face of slashed funding.\nDespite that, Amgen is moving forward with its growth plans. In June, the company announced a $900 million expansion of its manufacturing facility outside Columbus, Ohio, Bisnow\nreported\n. Last December, the firm\nannounced\nit was building a $1 billion manufacturing plant in Holly Springs, North Carolina.\n\nAcross the country in key life science markets like Boston and the Bay Area, lab space has become increasingly vacant as uncertainty over funding mounts. Los Angeles represents an outlier in the nationwide slump, however.\nLab leasing in L.A.\nfell to 60 deals in the first quarter of the year compared to 120 deals closing in the fourth quarter of last year. Total lab vacancy in L.A. hovers around 2 percent, making it the only single-digit lab vacancy figure across the U.S.\nConstruction on Amgen\u2019s Building 50 is slated to begin this quarter and wrap up in 2029. Once complete, the center will employ advanced automation and digital capabilities to help with the research and development of pharmaceuticals, according to Business First.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "The owners of Citadel Center are shopping the 37-story Loop office tower, a move that will test just how much appetite is left for downtown Chicago\u2019s high-end offices after property values have dropped dramatically in the sector.\nThe building is currently owned through a joint venture of New York-based TPG Angelo Gordon and Houston-based Hines. The duo hired Eastdil Secured to market the 1.5 million-square-foot building at 131 South Dearborn Street, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThere\u2019s no asking price, but any trade is expected to come in far south of the $448 million mortgage the owners placed on the property in 2020. With office values down and debt costs up, comparable property sales suggest the tower\u2019s market value could be a fraction of that figure.\nThe building is only 56 percent occupied, well below the downtown Chicago average of 73 percent, leaving a future buyer with a massive lease-up challenge at a time when remote work keeps sapping demand. The property\u2019s recent wins may soften the blow: Bain signed a 173,000-square-foot lease there earlier this year, and JPMorgan Chase expanded on a\nshort-term\ndeal into 126,000 square feet at Citadel Center while renovating its own nearby office tower at 10 South Dearborn.\nThe deals helped fill some of the gap left after the building\u2019s anchor tenant, the hedge fund Citadel Securities, moved its headquarters to Miami in 2022, later striking a lease buyout to help make room for Bain.\nEastdil is pitching the tower\u2019s updated amenities \u2014 a $10 million lobby and elevator renovation in 2018 \u2014 and the chance to lock in income from \u201cpremium\u201d tenants with more than $160 million left on their leases. The weighted average lease term sits at 6.4 years, giving some breathing room as a new owner hunts for tenants. The tower also offers 300,000 square feet of contiguous space in the high-rise portion and naming rights for a prospective big fish.\n\nThe property has a checkered history. The current owners swooped in with $50 million of fresh equity in 2016 to rescue it from default, then tried to flip it in 2019 for $750 million. The pandemic and its aftermath killed that plan, forcing a refinancing with BayernLB and a mezzanine loan from Brookfield Asset Management.\nComparisons of recent sales in the Loop aren\u2019t exactly\nequal\n, but could indicate just how steep a discount the tower could go for. Late last year, 70 West Madison Street went for about $60 per square foot, a 77 percent discount from its 2014 price, to buyers Namdar and Mason Asset Management.\nThe 57-story building also had leasing issues, falling from 90 percent leased during the 2014 purchase down to 68 percent occupied when it sold last year.\nElsewhere in the Loop, a\nNamdar-led group last year paid a little less than $20 million\n, or about $40 per square foot, to obtain the debt position for the office tower at One North LaSalle Street, a discount of nearly 73 percent from the property\u2019s remaining loan balance of $74 million. The deal allows Namdar to seize the property.\nIf recent trades are any guide, the outcome won\u2019t be pretty. The outlet\u2019s review of 19 downtown office sales since 2023 found buildings collectively lost about $2 billion in value compared to pre-COVID pricing.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "There\u2019s tough tenants. And then there\u2019s Alex Shchegol and his now-defunct ASA College.\nASA College inked a big lease at JEMB\u2019s Herald Center at 1293 Broadway in 2013 to expand its footprint to nearly 160,000 square feet at the 10-story building.\nBut after the ASA College missed rent payments in 2020, an entity tied to Joseph Jerome\u2019s JEMB Realty sued the school and owner Shchegol. By then, Shchegol and his for-profit school became embroiled in multiple controversies, making him the poster child for everything wrong with for-profit colleges.\nAt least ten women had accused Shchegol of misconduct. ASA also faced scrutiny over deceptive marketing campaigns and was set to lose its accreditation.\nMeanwhile, Shchegol made life difficult for the college\u2019s old landlord. After a New York state court awarded two judgments over $18 million against Shchegol and ASA College in 2022, Shchegol embarked on a series of unusual legal moves. JEMB\u2019s lawyers said his legal strategy, which included transferring money to Shchegol\u2019s wife, amounted to judgment evasion.\nThe litigation, spanning multiple lawsuits over the course of three years, has now been settled, allowing JEMB a chance to collect the money it is owed.\n\u201cWe are proud to have secured this remarkable outcome for our client after diligently pursuing defendants through their complex legal maneuvering,\u201d said Terrence and Darren Oved of Oved &amp; Oved. \u201cThis settlement reflects our firm\u2019s unwavering commitment to achieving outstanding results and safeguarding our clients\u2019 interests.\u201d\nShchegol did not return a request to comment.\n\nDuring the litigation, JEMB claimed Shchegol used his wife, Alla Schegol, to make fraudulent transfers, ultimately allowing Shchegol to become judgment-proof.\nIn one case, Shchegol allegedly transferred four parcels of property in Staten Island to Alla for no value just before the court entered a default judgment against him, according to JEMB\u2019s legal filings. Shchegol also sold a property in Florida for $5.5 million and directed those proceeds to his wife.\nFurther adding to the complexities, after almost 20 years of separation, Alla filed for divorce in New York in March 2023.\n\u201cIt appears that the true purpose of formalizing the divorce is to facilitate the couple\u2019s scheme by creating the veneer of separation between the two,\u201d JEMB\u2019s lawyers wrote in a filing.\nThis year, ASA College filed its own lawsuit against JEMB, along with its principal Joseph Jerome, alleging Jerome interfered with ASA\u2019s business by telling ASA\u2019s former accreditor that ASA was no longer paying rent. ASA claimed this led to the loss of its accreditation and total losses in excess of $100 million.\nJEMB and Jerome\u2019s lawyer responded in a legal filing by pointing to numerous headlines about ASA\u2019s ongoing troubles.\n\u201cUnable to dig itself out of the mess it created for itself, ASA\u2019s Complaint baselessly attempts to foist the consequences of its actions on to defendants,\u201d JEMB\u2019s lawyers stated.\nNow the litigation has all been settled. ASA\u2019s space at Herald Center has been replaced by\nYeshiva University\n. Earlier this year, JEMB scored a $300 million\nrefinancing\nfor the property.\n",

Goodman and Hollis agreed to use the building for housing and take $150,000 per month in rent.\nBut in May 2024 Knighthead Funding filed a foreclosure lawsuit over a loan issued to the business partners for the property, which is just west of the sought-after commercial real estate in the Fulton Market District neighborhood.

The second suit claims the action was a breach of contract and that the landlords had missed loan payments since September 2023.\nCourt records do not indicate whether the pair of lawsuits were settled or otherwise resolved, and it isn\u2019t clear if Knighthead formally took possession of the property from Goodman and Hollis.

        "content": "One of Douglas Elliman\u2019s top teams is headed for the \u2018burbs.\nThe Michael Lorber Team, founded in New York seven years ago by Michael Lorber and Alexander Boriskin, is expanding to Westchester and Connecticut. The two locales will join the team\u2019s existing operations in the city, the Hamptons and Palm Beach.\nThe 25-person cohort\u2019s tri-state spread comes as Lorber and Boriskin inked a new five-year deal with Elliman, following the departures of a number of prominent agents at the firm. Earlier this week, Noble Black announced that he and members of his top-producing team had\nleft Elliman\nfor Corcoran.\n\u201cOther companies were reaching out to us and wanted to see if we\u2019d be interested in coming to them, but we decided we wanted to stay at Elliman,\u201d Boriskin said, citing the firm\u2019s marketing teams and \u201cstreamlined\u201d referral process between markets. \u201cWe are everywhere our clients want to be.\u201d\nThe Michael Lorber Team is the brokerage\u2019s No. 3 large team in the country. Last year, the cohort logged the largest deal volume and commission income among Elliman teams of its size in New York City. It placed 23rd in\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nlatest ranking\nof the top resale agents across Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens with $76 million in sales.\nThe team\u2019s namesake leader is the son of Elliman\u2019s longtime chairman Howard Lorber, who abruptly\ndeparted the company in October\nafter\nmore than 20 years\n.\n\nThe team\u2019s expansion comes more than a year after it\nset up shop\nin Palm Beach, with one of its leading agents in the Hamptons, Adam Hofer, at the helm. Lorber and Boriskin also named Hofer a partner, alongside New York City-based agents Jared Halpern and Pierre Cadourcy.\nLorber and Boriskin tapped Scott Elwell, based in the company\u2019s office in Greenwich, Connecticut, as a leader of its dealings in the regions. Elwell was previously Elliman\u2019s regional vice president of sales in New England and Westchester, and his recent sales include a $4.5 million home in Riverside, Connecticut and a $3.9 million condo in Greenwich.\nLorber said the expansion isn\u2019t tied to the mayoral election in New York \u2014 he\u2019d been thinking about it long before Zohran Mamdani won the Democratic primary \u2014 but now the team is ready to handle an expected flow of business outside the five boroughs.\nInstead, he attributed the decision to his own search for a home outside the city limits, and though he instead\nopted to purchase\na co-op on the Upper East Side, his brief foray into those markets got Connecticut on his mind. That, plus the agent to whom he used to refer most of his suburban-seeking clients departed Elliman, leaving a gap he figured his team could fill.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to follow the business: Hamptons in the summer, Palm Beach in the winter, Connecticut in the shoulder seasons and New York City in between,\u201d Lorber said. \u201cLive where you work and work where you live.\u201d\nThe team doesn\u2019t have any listings in Westchester or Connecticut to back its launch just yet, but among its notable listings elsewhere are the $25 million Sagaponack estate owned by \u201cReal Housewives of Beverly Hills\u201d star Marisa Zanuck and her investor husband Michael Green and a\n$25 million\ngilded mansion in Bay Ridge.\n",

        "content": "Brandon Miller\u2019s East Village office project has landed a retail tenant.\nSephora inked a lease for the 7,800-square-foot retail space at 1 St. Mark\u2019s Place,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned. The LVMH-owned cosmetics retailer will occupy the ground floor of the nine-story boutique office project built by the late developer\u2019s company, Real Estate Equities Corporation, or REEC.\nThe asking rent and length of the lease were not known. Sephora and REEC principal Mark Seigel did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Retail By MONA Team that represented Sephora in the deal declined to comment.\n\nIt\u2019s a promising step forward for a project that\u2019s\nweathered its fair share of challenges\n, even before Miller\u2019s tragic death a little over a year ago. REEC bought the leasehold on the property for $29 million from Edward Gabay and filed plans in 2018 to build a 53,000-square-foot office building entirely on spec. Before foundations were even dug, Madison Capital Realty tried\nforeclosing\non the property in 2021.\nParkview Financial rescued the project with a $70 million refinance the following year. At one point, REEC fell behind on loan payments at the project, Parkview Financial CEO Paul Rahimian said in summer 2024. It was unclear whether REEC is not up to date on payments, or how leasing is faring for the office portion of the project. Rahimian said last month that construction was complete at the curved brick and glass building on the corner of Third Avenue.\nREEC\u2019s pivot from residential and mixed-use building\nto an almost exclusive focus on office came at a bad time, just before the onset of the pandemic. But the\noffice market has since made a comeback\n, with new\ninventory drying up and companies expanding\n.\n",

        "pub_date_dt": "2025-09-05T11:30:00",
        "content": "The\ndemise\nof Innovation QNS, a planned $2 billion development\nallowed\nby a City Council rezoning in November 2022, drew a nasty response from the local Council member.\nAstoria\u2019s Julie Won released a statement that was one part anger, one part threat and one part \u201cI told you so.\u201d None of the parts made sense, although they might seem logical to someone who does not understand how development works.\nWon said the project had \u201cno political support.\u201d But\nWon herself voted for it\n, and the rezoning passed\n46-1\n. Mayor Eric Adams and Queens Borough President Donovan Richards backed it as well.\nWon also said, \u201cThe remaining partners who are moving forward with a portion of Innovation Queens and those who will purchase other parcels of the land to benefit from this ill-fated rezoning are still expected to fulfill the same community benefit obligations.\u201d\nIll-fated? The rezoning was approved. I call that success.\nPerhaps Won was referring to the fate of the rezoned area, which allows for about 3,200 new homes.\nNothing has been built yet, but if multifamily projects on these sites pencil out, they will happen. If not, two reasons would be the city\u2019s\naffordability requirements\nand the state\u2019s\nproperty tax regime\n.\nThe government also controls other levers that determine the viability of housing development. Take the\nscaffold law\n, which only exists in New York and makes insurance for projects more expensive. (Business groups on Thursday launched a new effort to repeal the law \u2014 see \u201cElsewhere,\u201d below \u2014 but many previous attempts have failed.)\nOther factors that can doom projects, such as high borrowing costs, are beyond New York\u2019s control. But they are certainly not the fault of developers.\nWon concluded her statement with this: \u201cThe Astoria community is ready to keep landlords accountable and those who don\u2019t respect community agreements will be met with severe backlash.\u201d\nWhatever benefits Won wanted, she should have included in the language of the rezoning. But the enforceability of some elements of community benefits agreements has long been an unresolved debate among land-use lawyers. As for the additional low-income housing she demanded, that was always going to require public subsidies.\nThe Council member, like too many people, seems to treat rezonings as a benefit bestowed on real estate that obliges the industry to give something back. That\u2019s the wrong way to think about them.\nZoning reflects what the government wants to be built. The city wanted more housing in Astoria, and rezoned to allow it. If it doesn\u2019t get built, the city and state can take steps to make it financially viable.\nIf the rezoning for Innovation QNS were a pot of gold for developers, Silverstein Properties would not have pulled out. The firm\u2019s decision suggests that building apartments on the government\u2019s terms carried too much risk for the firm. (Megaprojects also require a lot of work, and Silverstein has other fish to fry.)\nIf the Astoria parcels are built out, the risk will be borne by developers, investors and lenders. Not by Julie Won.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nAt least one landlord besides the one we\nwrote about\nlast week applied this year for the state\u2019s hardship program for owners of rent-stabilized housing. The application involved \u201chours and hours of work,\u201d the landlord said by email, but several months have since passed and he has yet to hear back from the Division of Homes and Community Renewal. The landlord added that he is \u201cnot holding my breath.\u201d If you\u2019d like to share any experiences you\u2019ve had with DHCR, email me at\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\n\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Silverstein Properties\u2019 abandonment of Astoria megaproject Innovation QNS was evident as far back as July 2023, when it quietly terminated its 2019 contract to buy 42-11 Northern Boulevard from Premier Equities, the firm co-founded by Uzi Ben Abraham and Yaron Jacobi. Abraham Jacobi signed the termination agreement on behalf of Premier.\nThe parcel, which is in an Opportunity Zone and was just put\nback on the market\n, was given a floor-area ratio of 9 by the 2022 rezoning for Innovation QNS, allowing for a 219,000-square-foot multifamily or mixed-use building. The site has a one-story retail building formerly leased to Harley-Davidson, which\nclosed its dealership\nand service center there 11 months ago.\nPremier took out a $27 million mortgage on the property in late 2021 from Signature Bank, which later folded. The FDIC took over the loan and sold it to Blackstone, property records indicate.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 A coalition of business and civic groups is backing a bill from Rep. Nick Langworthy that would strip federal funding from any project that\u2019s held to New York\u2019s 140-year-old scaffold law, according to the\nTimes Union\n. The congressional bill aims to pressure the state legislature to scrap the law, which has survived numerous repeal efforts thanks to support from construction unions and trial lawyers.\n\u2014 Manhattan Council member Christopher Marte has launched a bid to become the next Council speaker,\nPIX11\nreported. Marte unveiled a website outlining ideas for reforming the Council, including more transparency for the chamber. Other contenders include Amanda Far\u00edas of the Bronx, Crystal Hudson of Brooklyn and Julie Menin of Manhattan.\n\u2014 A new analysis warns the soon-to-be-chosen downstate casinos may cause a sharp decrease in business for other New York gambling venues,\nGothamist\nreported. The report, by New Hampshire-based Capacity Consulting for Sullivan County, estimated that Resorts World Catskills would lose 26 percent of its gaming revenue from one new casino in the New York City area and up to 76 percent when three are operating.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$12 million\nfor a 2,436-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at The Surrey, 20 East 76th Street in Lenox Hill. Lauren Muss and Michelle Griffith of Douglas Elliman had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$9.4 million\nfor a 32,010-square-foot, 24-unit apartment building at 3450 Broadway in Hamilton Heights.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$28.9 million\nfor a 6,600-square-foot condominium unit at 345 West 13th Street in Greenwich Village. Kelly Killoren Bensimon of Douglas Elliman has the listing. The property last sold for\n$2.7 million\nin 2005.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "Dallas-based Palladium USA closed a total of $36 million in loans from several government agencies for an affordable multifamily development in Mesquite.\nPalladium Mesquite will include 111 units over two five-story buildings. A total of 95 units will be income-restricted \u2014 affordable or low-income households \u2014 with the other 16 reserved for renters making 140 percent of the area median income. The 4.7-acre development is located at 940 Military Parkway. A leasing center and first units are slated for delivery in the fall of 2026.\nThe company expects demand for affordable housing to increase as company headquarters migrate to North Texas.\nAfter securing a $4 million Multifamily Development Loan from the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs, Palladium received a $14 million HUD loan and $18 million in TDHCA tax credit financing, according to Executive Director Kim Parker.\nThe closing comes as the market grows more optimistic for lower interest rates.\n\n\u201cInterest rate conditions could be better, however, we were able to close our financial gap by receiving some other types of incentives,\u201d\u00a0 Parker said. \u201cWe were very fortunate to receive a $4 million dollar loan from the TDHCA, and that helped close our financial gap. Once we secured that funding, we felt comfortable moving forward to close.\u201d\nPalladium Mesquite is the company\u2019s second development in Mesquite, a suburb east of Dallas.\nLast year, the company began work on Palladium Carver Living at 2200 Bruton Road\n, an affordable housing development that received $1.5 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds, among other government support.\nPalladium has developed multifamily projects in 19 Texas cities, mostly in the Metroplex.\nParker expects Palladium to close financing for three more projects before the year\u2019s end: Cockrell Hill Senior Living in Mesquite, 2910 Motley Senior Living in Mesquite and McKinney Ranch Senior Living. Further down the pipeline, financing for Palladium Denton West is expected to close in early 2026.\n",

        "content": "Federal Housing Financing Agency boss Bill Pulte dodged a reporter\u2019s question about whether his agency is investigating Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in the wake of reports of mortgage fraud that echo the Trump administration\u2019s recent accusations against a governor of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank.\nCNBC\u2019s Andrew Ross Sorkin asked\nPulte\non Squawk Box about mortgage fraud claims made against Paxton, specifically reports by the AP in July that the U.S. Senate hopeful\nclaimed three homes as his primary residence\n. In doing so, he\u2019s violated the mortgage agreements and locked lower interest rates on the loans.\nPulte refused to comment.\n\u201cAs I said, unless it\u2019s something that\u2019s either been made public by lawyers like Norm Eisen or in criminal referrals, I\u2019m not going to comment on any specific situation,\u201d Pulte said. \u201cIf things are made public or if we decide to make them public, then I will talk about it.\u201d\nPulte appeared on the show to discuss the agency\u2019s investigation into the Trump administration\u2019s moves to dump Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. Pulte publicly accused Cook of mortgage fraud, claiming she designated two properties as her primary residence. The accusations provided the basis for Cook\u2019s ouster by Trump, who\u2019s also been exerting his populist political style and appeal in attempts to convince Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates.\nCNBC\u2019s Sorkin asked Pulte why he\u2019d comment on Cook but not Paxton.\n\nPulte called the comparison \u201cfalse\u201d and accused Cook\u2019s lawyers Norm Eisen and Abbe Lowell of politicizing the agency\u2019s work.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re Republican or Democrat,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will look at everything, and we are looking at Republicans, Democrats, you name it, if you commit mortgage fraud in this country. With the resources that we have, we\u2019re trying to do as good of a job as we can.\u201d\nThe allegations come as Paxton wages a primary challenge against U.S. Senator John Cornyn, who\u2019s been the state\u2019s senior senator since 2002.\nIn the first three months of the race,\nCornyn outraised Paxton\nby $1 million, the Texas Tribune reported. But,\nreal estate is split\n, with heavy hitters like Centurion American\u2019s Mehrdad Moayedi giving to Paxton, while Ross Perot Jr. sticks with Cornyn.\nThe mortgage fraud accusations aren\u2019t the first controversy Paxton has faced during the campaign.\nPaxton\u2019s wife, state Sen. Angela Paxton,\nfiled for divorce in July\n\u201con biblical grounds,\u201d citing her husband\u2019s adultery, which\ncame to light\nin 2023, when he was impeached by the Texas House and\nacquitted\nby the Senate.\n",

        "content": "With just two months until the general election, the real estate industry\u2019s favorite candidate in the mayoral race is in flux.\nBased on campaign and super PAC donations, the industry\u2019s loyalties have shifted from former Gov. Andrew Cuomo before the primary to Mayor Eric Adams in the immediate aftermath to a mix of the two in the latest campaign finance filings. Now, if the race narrows, industry bigwigs will likely consolidate their support behind whoever remains to face off against Assembly member Zohran Mamdani.\nThat person may be Cuomo, following reports that the Trump administration has offered Adams and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa roles in the federal government.\nAdams met with developer Steve Witkoff, a special envoy for the Trump administration, in Florida this week as part of talks about his potential future if he drops out of the race, The New York Times reported. The meeting was perhaps telling: Though a Democratic socialist as mayor would likely serve as a politically valuable target for Trump, New York real estate professionals \u2014 some old friends of the president, as noted by the Times \u2014 fear what a Mamdani administration\u2019s policies will mean for their businesses.\nThe administration has reportedly dangled a role with the Department of Housing and Urban Development for Adams, according to Politico New York. The position offered is not clear (a source told Politico \u201cdirector of cities,\u201d which doesn\u2019t appear to be a title). There is, however, a precedent for city officials serving as the agency\u2019s regional director for New York and New Jersey. Former Mayor Bill de Blasio occupied the role under President Bill Clinton; Deputy Mayor Adolfo Carri\u00f3n, for President Barack Obama administration; and former Council member Alicka Ampry-Samuel served under the Biden administration.\nOf course, such a move would be a downgrade from overseeing a city of more than 8 million people. The Times reported that the administration was instead considering an ambassadorship for Adams.\nBoth Adams and Sliwa have denied plans to drop out of the race. During a press conference on Thursday, Adams told reporters, \u201cI\u2019ve never asked for a job with HUD, I\u2019ve never been promised a job with HUD, I have not communicated with the president,\u201d\naccording to the City\n.\nDeveloper Jeff Gural, who has donated to Cuomo and Adams and the respective super PACs backing their campaigns, said on Thursday that he\u2019s hopeful that the general election will boil down to a competition between Mamdani and Cuomo.\n\n\u201cI think everybody agrees that if nobody drops out, Mamdani is going to win easily,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI always thought Andrew would do a good job,\u201d he added. \u201cWe were just blindsided that he would lose to Mamdani decisively.\u201d\nAfter Cuomo\u2019s loss in the primary, Gural was among the real estate professionals who turned their attention back to Adams\u2019 campaign. But the mayor lagged in the polls and corruption cases against his inner circle continued to pile up, even as he\nescaped\nfederal charges himself.\nIndependent Jim Walden dropped out of the race this week, which helped \u201cmarginally,\u201d said Kenny Burgos, head of the New York Apartment Association, but anything other than a one-on-one competition between Mamdani and another candidate will be an uphill battle. He said he met with Mamdani after the primary.\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m not hopeful for the freeze conversation to go away, if I\u2019m hopeful for anything, it\u2019s a renewed conversation of the city\u2019s broken property tax system,\u201d Burgos said.\nA developer who recently attended a meeting with Mamdani noted that the real estate industry doesn\u2019t have a singular view of the mayoral race. While rent-stabilized owners fear Mamdani\u2019s pledge to freeze rents for four years, affordable housing developers are encouraged by his promise to beef up the city\u2019s housing agency and increase capital available for housing construction.\nThe developer went on to say that, given that Mamdani is the Democratic nominee and likely best positioned to win in November, affordable housing professionals want to be part of conversations about who should lead the city\u2019s housing-related agencies and the administration\u2019s priorities.\n\u201cHe\u2019s an open-minded guy,\u201d the person said. \u201cI think he\u2019s still learning a lot about this. It seems that he wants to learn.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Schickedanz Building Group won the right to build 25 two-story homes in Wellington on vacant land that was previously set aside for equestrian uses.\nThe Wellington Village Council on Wednesday unanimously approved the rezoning of 10 acres of land by 50th Street South and 120th Avenue South. The developer\u2019s attorney, Brian Seymour, told the council if they voted against the zoning plan, his client would have the right to pursue 201 apartments in buildings up to three stories tall under the state\u2019s\nLive Local Act\n, so long as they included affordable housing. The builder could also construct a 75,000-square-foot commercial development or an equestrian operation with stables, a riding ring and manure processing facilities on land adjacent to single-family homes, he added.\nThe mayor and some council members expressed concerns over the latter development possibilities. Councilwoman Maria S. Antu\u00f1a said the proposed single-family neighborhood is \u201cthe best outcome,\u201d adding that it was better than developing the property as commercial. \u201cWe all know what Live Local does and what it will do,\u201d she said.\nSo the new zoning will enable West Palm Beach-based Schickedanz to build a single-family home community called Islepointe, with each home priced at an average of more than $3 million, Seymour said. An affiliate of Schickedanz paid $4.5 million in 2021\u00a0 for the property, referred to as the Pod O parcel by village officials, according to property records.\nThe rezoning is essentially an amendment of the 1,560-acre Orange Point Master Plan crafted in the 1980s and 1990s that gave rise to more than 750 homes at nearby Isles at Wellington and dozens of houses in neighboring Windsor Bay Estates.\n\nAfter initially opposing the zoning change, homeowners associations for Isles at Wellington and Windsor Bay supported the project after the developer gave unspecified cash settlements to both associations and promised to enhance a 50-foot-tall berm between the future Islepointe and existing neighborhoods. The developer also agreed to not allow the homes to be rented out and to contribute $280,000 toward a new pathway outside Islepointe\u2019s future entrance.\nSupport was not unanimous, though. A handful of homeowners in Windsor Bay still opposed the project. One, Brian Solomon, told council members the two-story homes would be too tall, and his view from his master-bedroom would be unobstructed if the height were limited to just one story.\u00a0 But Seymour said his client already agreed to scale back his project from an original 72 homes and would not consent to one-story homes.\nEstablished in the 1970s as a community of polo fields, showjumping tracks and other equestrian activities,\nWellington\nhas garnered increased attention from developers and real estate investors.\nRelated Ross Chairman Steve Ross intends to acquire the village\u2019s 70-acre K-Park site for $47 million to build a mixed-use development that will include 500 residential units, 180 hotel rooms and\nWingrove Academy, a preK-12 private school for 1,700 students that will open in 2028\n.\nIn August, the village council\nOKed zoning changes for developer Mark Bellissimo\u2019s Marketplace at Wellington project\nthat will include an 80-room hotel, an 89-unit condominium and 117,000 square feet of commercial space.\nThat same month, the heirs of\nAnheuser-Bush paid $24.5 million for the 42.1-acre Palm Beach Equine Sports Complex,\nan equestrian facility built in 1979 with six riding arenas, 336 stalls, a 17-acre pond, a private lounge and apartments for staff.",

The buyer was not immediately known.

On a price-per-square-foot basis, single-family homes traded for $1,311 in the second quarter, slipping 10.5 percent from a year ago.\n",

SomeraRoad brought Brick Row into the deal earlier this year to manage leasing.\nSomeraRoad has increased its footprint in Austin in recent years. The firm, which also has a headquarters in Nashville, purchased St. Elmo Public Market in 2023. At the time, the property at 4329 South Congress Avenue was an unfinished adaptive-reuse retail project.

KTR Real Estate Partners conducted the appraisal, according to filings.\nAlbert Togut, the bankruptcy trustee for the building owner, told\nThe Real Deal\nhe plans to sell the schoolhouse and has engaged commercial real estate broker\nBob Knakal of BKREA\nto do so.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful building [that] I hope can be bought by another school,\u201d Togut said via email. \u201cOf course, I will entertain offers from whomever.\u201d\nManhattan Country School has spent the last year fighting collapse. But when it bought the schoolhouse in 2015, it was hoping for an expansion.\nThe school, most recently home to 250 students from kindergarten to eighth grade, saw applications rise in the mid-2010s,\nThe New York Times\nreported. But its building at that time, on East 96th Street, was only about 14,000 square feet. A bigger building could house more amenities, attracting more families and growing tuition revenue.\nManhattan Country School purchased the Upper West Side building from The New School, which housed its music college at the site. Knakal\u2019s team also\nbrokered\nthat deal.\nThe six-story elevator building was built in 1928, according to appraisal documents.\nTo pay for the acquisition and renovations, Manhattan Country School drained its endowment and borrowed about $20 million through tax-exempt bonds, according to reporting from\nBloomberg\n.\n\nBut expansion plans were stymied by the pandemic.\nThe school had prided itself on educating low-income students along with their wealthier peers, charging each what they could afford to pay. The curriculum emphasized equity and sustainability. Students had access to a 180-acre farm in Roxbury, New York, that cost about $1 million per year to operate, according to bankruptcy filings.\nBut some wealthier students moved away or chose other schools as the school remained remote through 2021, the Times reported. Administrators were unable to raise tuition in response.\nQueens-based Flushing Bank held the debt. Last October, it filed for foreclosure on the building.\nThe school was keeping the lights on with loans from members of its board, along with student deposits from the upcoming school year.\nThe school filed for bankruptcy in May. The entity that co-owns the building followed in filing this week. Initial bankruptcy documents list about $3.8 million in debt owed directly to Flushing Bank, with about $25 million owed to the bank through a trustee.\nThe school attempted to stave off immediate collapse with another loan in May, this one $8 million provided by a foundation called Casa Laxmi at a 12 percent annual interest rate.\nBut the lender required repayment before other creditors. The bank objected, noting that the Casa Laxmi\u2019s CEO had taken control of the school\u2019s board. A bankruptcy judge rejected the loan proposal.\nAn attorney representing Manhattan Country School in bankruptcy proceedings did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "An aging mall in Capitola is getting closer to redevelopment into a large new housing project.\nThe Capitola City Council is considering zoning options that would make way for up to 1,700 new homes on the 46-acre Capitola Mall site, the Silicon Valley Business Journal\nreported\n.\nMall owner and developer Merlone Geier Partners has been in talks with city leaders for more than a decade, according to the Business Journal.\nA 2019 proposal from Merlone Geier called for 637 residential units and about 339,000 square feet of commercial space for retail, restaurants and entertainment. That plan included mixed-use buildings with ground-floor retail and upper-floor apartments wrapped around parking garages. The application ultimately didn\u2019t advance but provided a blueprint for Merlone Geier\u2019s future plans.\nLate last month, City Council members considered three zoning proposals for the Capitola Mall site.\nThe first would be a traditional update process, which would require extensive community outreach and delay approvals until next year. The second, which Merlone Geier supports, would streamline approvals and reduce community input to get shovels in the ground fast. The third option would be a form-based code development that emphasizes walkability, cohesive design and integration with surrounding neighborhoods, though that would require more time and coordination in order to come to fruition.\n\n\u201cPeople are interested in seeing a design,\u201d Council Member Melinda Orbach said in the City Council\nmeeting\n. \u201cWe have to move things along so that Merlone Geier can come to us with a design, with a proposal, with a project, so then we can talk about it, and our residents can chime in on what works and what doesn\u2019t for them.\u201d\nThe council voted to form a subcommittee to work with Merlone Geier and reconvene within two weeks with more information around a future development.\n\u201cThis is going to be one of the biggest things we do in Captiola,\u201d Mayor Joe Clarke said during the meeting. \u201cSo taking two weeks, it\u2019s not a long time. I\u2019d like to see our subcommittee reach out to Merlone Geier and the other stakeholders, and let them know that we\u2019re committed to seeing the project through.\u201d\nThe Capitola Mall was built in 1977 and expanded in 1989. It currently houses 68 retail tenants and is anchored by a Target, Macy\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s.\nThe city of Capitola must plan for 1,336 new housing units by 2031 as part of its\nHousing Element\n. More than half of those must be set aside for\nlow-income and very-low-income\nhouseholds, or those making between $63,400 and $101,750 annually.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "On the surface, 789 MacDonough Street is a glowing example of tenants becoming owners of their neglected building.\nThe 41-unit, Bedford-Stuyvesant apartment house, built in 1930, began falling apart in the 1970s as the landlord essentially abandoned what was once a \u201cbeautiful, gorgeous building,\u201d as longtime resident Lisa Lanier\ndescribed it\n.\nThe building was aging, its regulated rents were about $200 a month, and Bed-Stuy had become something of a war zone. \u201cDo-or-die Bed-Stuy,\u201d locals called it.\n\u201cIt was like living at the OK Corral. At any given moment, shots would ring out from the corners, and people would scream and scatter,\u201d Lanier recalled in an article about Habitat for Humanity\u2019s recent repainting of the building.\nThe city foreclosed on the six-story building in 1982 for unpaid taxes and\nsold it to the tenants\nin 1989 for $10,250 \u2014 exactly $250 per unit, about the same as their monthly rent.\n\u201cHad it not been for this program, I would not have been able to purchase my own home,\u201d one of the original buyers, Emma Oliver, told Habitat magazine in a\n2008 story\nabout HDFC low-income co-ops. \u201cAnd this is a home, a place where most everyone knows everyone else. Most of my neighbors have lived here 30, 40 years. The HDFC gave us a chance to live in an affordable place that\u2019s comfortable.\u201d\nBut co-op ownership, which is often touted as a solution for neglected rentals, has not been easy for the shareholders of 789 MacDonough.\n\u201cThose were a rocky first couple of years, from \u201989 to \u201991, as we navigated the learning curve to successfully manage a 41-unit building,\u201d another resident, Corinne Douglas, said in the article. \u201cIt was a struggle to keep this building operating and in the black, and now, 30 years later, we still own it.\u201d\nIts financial struggles continue, however, in part because of Oliver, the board president from 1998 to 2016. Her reign ended when she was caught embezzling and convicted of grand larceny. In 2018, she was ordered to pay restitution of $122,680, but never did. The next year, she stopped paying maintenance fees for her unit, 1C, and has run up tens of thousands of dollars in arrears.\nWhen the co-op board asks other shareholders to catch up on their maintenance, they inevitably mention that Oliver hasn\u2019t paid, said John Thomas, who became board president last year.\n\u201cThe woman just continued to not only be here, but not pay a single cent after the theft, and just go about her business like it was nothing,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cWe wound up being almost in default. It drained most of the accounts.\u201d\nBiting the hand that fed her\nOliver, now 91 years old, extolled the virtues of her affordable building in Habitat\u2019s\n2008 story\n.\n\u201cWe have income limits we have to abide by,\u201d said Oliver, who was described as a retired nurse on disability. \u201cWe also set a limit on what shareholders can sell for\u201d \u2014 $3,000 per room to an inside buyer, $6,000 to outsiders.\nPrices are higher now, but still cheap: Unit 4G, a one-bedroom, was\nlisted last year\nfor $185,000, with maintenance of $580 per month.\nAs president, Oliver controlled the board\u2019s finances with no oversight, Thomas said, and her looting reached six figures before it was discovered. In the Habitat story, real estate lawyer Larry McGaughey had warned that the city has no enforcement mechanism for HDFCs. \u201cEach individual co-op is on its own,\u201d he said.\nBut the city did have leverage to keep 789 MacDonough affordable for future buyers. The board in 2003 signed a 30-year regulatory agreement with the city that limits shareholders\u2019 profit potential in exchange for suspension of its pre-2001 tax arrears. Among the restrictions: buyers cannot earn more than 120 percent of the area median income.\n\nThe co-op, which needed the deal to get a loan for repairs and operating expenses, also consented to financial transparency measures, such as getting city approval for every withdrawal from its reserve fund. But the embezzlement scandal happened despite the agreement, which, ironically, was signed by Emma Oliver. Now the board is fighting the city as it tries to get her out.\nCiting Oliver\u2019s unpaid maintenance, the board foreclosed on her shares and went to housing court to evict her. The case dragged on until September 2024, when it was awarded possession of Unit 1C and a judgment of $46,169 plus interest.\nThat same day, a city marshal applied for a warrant of eviction. Nearly five months passed before it was granted.\nThe process had taken years, but the co-op was about to put the embarrassing, painful episode behind it. Then, at the 11th hour, an unlikely party intervened: the city of New York.\nRather than helping 789 MacDonough Street through its crisis, as it did in the 1980s, the city went all-out to keep Oliver in the apartment she no longer owns.\nThe board is now suing the city and Oliver, alleging that shareholders of 789 MacDonough \u201care being forced to house their abuser, Ms. Oliver, at their own costs.\u201d\n\u201c[We] are not a homeless shelter,\u201d the board argued in its complaint. \u201cThe government cannot force a private cooperative \u2014 itself composed of elderly, low-income shareholders \u2014 to solve a housing problem by forfeiting its own property rights.\u201d\nFor much of this year, the Adams administration has done exactly that.\nAn elusive eviction\nThe Department of Social Services, which has been trying to find housing for Oliver, persuaded a judge this spring to appoint a guardian and issue a temporary restraining order prohibiting her eviction. A housing court judge twice postponed her removal, but on May 15 declined to do so again. The marshal scheduled her eviction for the next day.\nWhat happened next, according to the lawsuit, was extraordinary: The Department of Investigation ordered the marshal to stand down. Without court approval, the agency granted a stay of eviction to Adult Protective Services, a DSS program that landlord attorneys say is increasingly being used to stall evictions.\nOliver\u2019s ouster was rescheduled for May 21, then for May 29 and again for June 3 as the Department of Investigation kept extending the eviction \u2014 a power typically reserved for judges. DSS, meanwhile, went back to court, seeking another restraining order, which Supreme Court Justice Maria Aragona granted. Outraged, the co-op board named the judge in its lawsuit.\nThe city\u2019s Law Department and DSS did not respond to requests for comment. Text messages and a call to a number listed for Oliver were not returned.\nThe city has argued that Oliver should not have to post a bond in the case because she cannot afford it, despite her withholding maintenance fees and receiving a monthly pension and Social Security payments totaling $3,989, according to the lawsuit.\nAs for the $122,000 that Oliver pilfered, Thomas, the board president, believes she distributed much of it to relatives. Interest on her restitution to the building\u2019s insurance provider \u2014 which covered $100,000 of the co-op\u2019s loss \u2014 and to the co-op is accruing at 9 percent and has swelled her arrears to nearly $200,000.\nThe board did receive 12 months\u2019 worth of Oliver\u2019s arrears from the state\u2019s pandemic-era Emergency Rental Assistance Program before ERAP ran out of money and\nshut down\n. But the remaining arrears, restitution and interest owed to the board add up to about $90,000.\n\u201cThis is an unfair situation to us, and it\u2019s costing us a lot of money,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe can\u2019t sell the apartment, we can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n",

The Boca Raton City Council will next vote on the expansion, which the planning and zoning board greenlit at its meeting on Thursday.\nIn exchange for the extra units, the developers offered to reserve four apartments for affordable housing and include a 2,086-square-foot fitness facility. The city\u2019s commercial industrial multifamily development (CIMD) ordinance allows developers to ask for additional residential units to be built in light-industrial areas such as the Amtec Center in exchange for attainable housing and new retail.\nAmtec Center\u2019s owners also want conditional use approval for a 2,000-square-foot school for 100 students within an existing office building on site. The request would allow Xceed Preparatory Academy, which operates a hybrid tutoring facility in an Amtec Center office building, to accept school vouchers, said the project\u2019s attorney, Ele Zachariades.\nJon Ounjian, owner of an office building just north of the Amtec Center, opposed the additional units. Ounjian pointed out that the apartments will be built on a 4-acre portion of the office park. Ounjian said Bocora\u2019s vehicular traffic will adversely affect his property unless a turn lane is added.\nBoard members and planning staff were concerned that the project\u2019s planned fitness center was an amenity for Bocora residents that is being used to \u201ccheck a box\u201d for the CMID retail requirement. Board member Timothy Dornblaser said this is part of a larger pattern where developers prefer to build more residential without retail or restaurant space.\n\n\u201cAll these apartments that are going up [have] no retail, so every time someone wants a cup of coffee or breakfast or something, they are leaving the site,\u201d Dornblaser said.\nDevelopment services director Brandon Schaad said the fitness center will be required to be open to the public and staffed at least 60 hours a week. An independent business separate from the developers will operate the gym, as required by CIMD, otherwise the developers may be fined or sued by the city.\nZachariades said there will not be any need for staff since members will have a key pass to get in. \u201cIt\u2019s a small boutique gym. Most of them don\u2019t have staff at all,\u201d she said.\nSchaad said that will be determined by the time the zoning item reaches the city council. \u201cUnstaffed commercial gyms are a real thing in the world, but I\u2019m not familiar with them,\u201d he said.\nBeztak, led by Sam Beznos, and Wexford, led by Joseph Jacobs and Philip Braunstein,\nannounced plans for Bocora\nin late 2021, soon after an affiliate of Beztak acquired the northwestern portion of the Amtec Center for $12.7 million. Jupiter-based Catexor, led by Stig and Britt Wennerstrom, sold the 4-acre site. Catexor still owns the remaining 17.3 acres at the Amtec Center, including its mid-1980s office buildings.\nBoca Raton has become a hot spot for development and land investment.\nIn July,\nthe Related Group paid $50 million for a 10-acre piece of the Office Depot Campus\nwhere Related, PEBB Enterprises and BH Group are redeveloping part of the office complex into a mixed-use community with 500 apartments, 43,000 square feet of retail and a 36,400-square-foot fitness center. That same month,\nGroup P6 and Mill Creek Residential won approval to build a 306-unit apartment building\nin the downtown area from Boca Raton\u2019s Community Redevelopment Agency. In August, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints\npaid $152.5 million for the 384-unit\nDel Ola apartment complex, and that month the Boca Raton planning board\nbacked James and Marta Batmasians\u2019 plans to build a 12-story, 242-room hotel near Mizner Park\n.\nSome residents are opposing new projects. Late last month, residents collected thousands of signatures\ndemanding a referendum on a proposed 1.5-million square foot project by Terra Group and Frisbie Group\non 31 acres of public land.\n",

        "content": "A 23-story office tower on Wacker Drive in Chicago\u2019s Loop hit the market in hopes of finding an investor keen to buy at a discount through a distressed loan sale.\nBoise-based lender A10 Capital is seeking a buyer for the $27.5 million loan tied to 205 West Wacker Drive, the outstanding principal on a $35 million mortgage the property\u2019s owner, Alvarez &amp; Marsal Property Investments, took out on the building in 2015, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nA10 Capital hired JLL brokers Tom Hall, Jaime Fink and Kyle Kaminski to market the loan, providing a path for investors to acquire the building through a \u201cconsensual deed-in-lieu,\u201d in which Alvarez would surrender the property provided the loan is sold. The landlord has been in default on the mortgage since June 2024, according to JLL.\nThe 271,000-square-foot office tower was originally built in 1928 and last sold for just under $23 million in 2013, or less than $84 per square foot. At the time it was sold to Chicago-based investor Ameritus through an ownership venture, according to Cook County records. Alvarez became the manager of that venture in 2015 and refinanced the property through A10.\nAssuming a buyer for the loan note emerges and finds a way to seize the keys from Alvarez, the Wacker Drive building will mark the landlord\u2019s third Chicago property lost amid financial distress in the post-pandemic office rout.\n\nAlvarez faced a\n$22 million foreclosure lawsuit initiated last year\nby a group of bondholders in the mortgage debt for 205 West Randolph Street. The lender is set to become the owner of that 23-story, 199,000-square-foot building in coming weeks when a court finalizes a foreclosure sale that occurred this summer, according to public loan data.\nAnd earlier this year,\nAlvarez\nsold off 303 West Erie Street in River North to a joint venture of Cubed Real Estate and developer R2 for $7.5 million, half of what Alvarez paid to buy it in 2017.\nThe Wacker Drive property was last renovated in 2014 and has struggled like many\ndowntown\noffice buildings through the rise of remote work since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The building is currently 43 percent leased, according to JLL.\nIt would be a prime candidate for other uses, as existing zoning on the property would allow for multifamily or hotel conversions, according to JLL. If a developer takes on such a transformation, the property would join the slew of office-to-residential projects currently underway or proposed in the Loop and surrounding areas, some of which have snagged taxpayer subsidies.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The plan aims to breathe life into the neighborhood after restaurants closed and tourism declined during the pandemic.\nThe Fisherman\u2019s Wharf Forward project would use public investment amid growing business momentum to speed up the area\u2019s recovery. The comeback is already in motion, as visitor spending and hotel bookings are notably higher than a year ago, convention reservations are up 65 percent, and the city\u2019s Ferry Building is seeing record crowds, according to a\nstatement\nfrom Mayor Daniel Lurie\u2019s office.\nAs the\nartificial intelligence sector grows its foothold in the city\nand attracts new workers from around the world, city officials are hopeful that the Fisherman\u2019s Wharf Forward plan, in tandem with organic growth, will revitalize the neighborhood.\nPart of the plan includes turning the former site of Alioto\u2019s Restaurant on Taylor Street into a public plaza facing the lagoon that abuts Jefferson Street. The space will include picnic tables, benches facing the Bay, new-and-improved lighting and landscaping and a pop-up space for retail or beverage services.\n\nAlioto\u2019s shuttered in 2022 and the Port of San Francisco attempted to re-lease the space, with more than 20 potential tenants expressing interest. The restaurant\u2019s three-story layout and the costs of repairs and necessary code upgrades put the kibosh on leasing in any capacity, including partial or temporary uses.\nInstead, Port officials settled on creating public space to attract people to the site and boost nearby businesses.\nThe Fisherman\u2019s Wharf Forward endeavor adds to other recent efforts to revive activity in the tourist hotspot, including new leases on Jefferson Street, various pop-up activations and improvements to fishing operations at Pier 45, according to the mayor\u2019s office. The project purportedly will also support safer streets and more active public spaces.\nStructural improvements are also coming to the wharf as part of the Forward plan. This includes strengthening or replacing the seawall, flood-proofing buildings, modernizing dock space for fishing boats and upgrading public spaces. The goal with these moves is to protect the waterfront from sea level rise and earthquakes while maintaining its character for residents, fishers and tourists.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

Chalfant ruled in favor of Los Angeles officials and rejected a request from Brinah Milstein and TV producer Roy Bank to demolish Monroe\u2019s Brentwood residence, the New York Post\nreported\n. The move aligns with a City Council vote last year that protected the Spanish-style house from demolition.\nIt all started in September 2023 when Milstein and Bank\nfiled demolition plans\nfor the home at 12305 Fifth Helena Drive. The couple bought the home in July of that year for nearly $8.4 million and was able to receive a demolition permit with plans to destroy the historic home to expand its own current residence next door, Deadline\nreported\n.\nCommunity pushback was swift. Court papers from the City Attorney\u2019s Office cited by Deadline said the public overwhelmed city officials with calls and emails to \u201cexpress their dismay\u201d with the demolition plan.\nCity Council member Traci Park threw a wrench into the mix by moving to designate the home as a historic cultural landmark. The City Council\nvoted in favor of the designation\nlast June.

Not in the least.\u201d The lawsuit claimed \u201cthere is not a single piece of the house that includes any physical evidence that Ms. Monroe ever spent a day at the house \u2014 not a piece of furniture, not a paint chip, not a carpet, nothing.\u201d\nMonroe bought the 2,900-square-foot, four-bedroom house in February 1962 for $77,500, or the equivalent of nearly $832,000 today. The\nSome Like It Hot\nstar lived on the property for only six months before dying at the home that August at the age of 36.

BB Americas Bank is the lender.\nJim Fried of Sandstone Realty Advisors represented Estate in the financing.\nSoleste on the Trail will consist of one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments, ranging from 700 square feet to 1,000 square feet.\nEstate, led by Robert Suris and Jeffrey Ardizon, bought the 15.8-acre development site for $8 million in 2021, records show.\nThe firm\u2019s South Florida pipeline includes around 5,000 units and 153,000 square feet of commercial space, according to the release.\n\nIn North Miami Beach, Estate is developing the 28-story, 363-unit\nSoleste on the Bay\ntower at 16375 Biscayne Boulevard. The tower is immediately south of Estate\u2019s 23-story, 367-unit\nSoleste NoMi Beach\napartment tower, which the firm completed last year.\nEstate also is developing the eight-story, 347-unit Soleste Reserve 1 apartment building with some workforce units at 5079 Southwest 48th Street in Davie, after landing a\n$78 million\nconstruction loan for the project in December. Adjacent to the building, Estate also plans the eight-story\nSoleste Reserve 2\nwith more than 300 units at 5081 Southwest 48th Street.\nLast year, Estate also scored a\n$72.5 million\nconstruction loan for the 321-unit Soleste Palm Station apartment complex with a pair of eight-story buildings 520 North Rosemary Avenue in downtown West Palm Beach.\nSouth Florida\u2019s multifamily market has slowed compared to the boom during the first three years after the pandemic\u2019s onset. More recently, developers completed a\nrecord number of units\n, which led to slower lease-ups, more concessions and a flatlining \u2013\u2013 and even a decline \u2013\u2013 in rents.\nYet, developers have continued to start apartment projects and score\nconstruction loans\n, saying that the supply overhang will be absorbed and demand will come back by the time they finish their new buildings.\nTrammell Crow Residential landed\n$66.4 million\nlast month to develop a 338-unit Alexan-branded apartment complex with five five-story buildings at 785-795 South State Road 7 and an adjacent empty lot in Margate.\nIn West Palm Beach, Immocorp Ventures is developing a 382-unit apartment complex with three buildings at 2484 Pinewood Avenue in the Northwood District, after scoring a\n$117 million\nconstruction loan in June.\n",

Investors have accused the developer of taking their money, saying the life savings they invested with him are seemingly gone.\nIn May, federal authorities arrested Mattson and accused him of participating in \u201ca classic Ponzi scheme\u201d to steal tens of millions of dollars from hundreds of retirees and others who trusted him to invest their life savings, according to the Chronicle. Mattson pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges that month, including wire fraud and money laundering. He continues to maintain his innocence.\nAt their peak, Mattson and LeFever had amassed a portfolio of properties across Sonoma County worth more than $146 million, which included historic homes and businesses in California\u2019s wine country. They also held properties in the Sacramento area and Southern California with an estimated value of about $413 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Plans to redevelop Miami Marine Stadium were derailed by an indictment brought against the former CEO of the company tapped to oversee the restoration.\nThe City of Miami was set to vote Friday, Sept. 5 to send a referendum on the proposal to the November election, the\nMiami Herald\nreported. The city had chosen the firm Global Spectrum, doing business as Oak View Group (OVG)\u00a0 to take the reins as the operator of the historic venue.\nIn July, the Department of Justice indicted OVG\u2019s co-founder and CEO Timothy Leiweke, alleging he had conspired to rig the bidding process for \u201cthe development, management and use of a multi-purpose arena,\u201d planned for a public university campus in Austin, Texas, according to a\npress release\n. He stepped down as CEO of the firm and pleaded not guilty to the charges. OVG reached a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ and agreed to pay $15 million in penalties in July,\nBillboard\nreported.\nThat month a spokesperson for Leiweke offered this statement to\nVariety\n:\n\u201cMr. Leiweke has done nothing wrong and will vigorously defend himself and his well-deserved reputation for fairness and integrity,\u201d the spokesperson told the outlet. \u201cThe Antitrust Division\u2019s allegations are wrong on the law and the facts, and the case should never have been brought. The law is clear: vertical, complementary business partnerships, like the one contemplated between OVG and Legends, are legal. These allegations blatantly ignore established legal precedent and seek to criminalize common teaming efforts that are proven to enhance competition and benefit the public. The Moody Center is a perfect example, as it has resulted in substantial and sustained benefits to the University of Texas and the City of Austin.\u201d\nCity Manager Art Noriega told the Herald he did not learn of the indictment until Sept. 4, the night before the scheduled vote, when the outlet emailed him a request for comment. An internal memo reviewed by the outlet showed the city met with OVG four times between the indictment and the scheduled vote.\n\nThe memo read: \u201cDue diligence was conducted, including verifying corporate status,\u201d the outlet reported. \u201cThere were no adverse findings related to [the company\u2019s] responsibility.\u201d\nNoriega told the outlet the city needed to do more due diligence regarding the\nMarine Stadium\noperator selection.\n\u201cIt was other stuff beyond the indictment that was a little more concerning,\u201d Noriega told the outlet. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m not comfortable with the set of circumstances with the vendor and the continued role of the former CEO.\u201d\nWhile the OVG indictment has disrupted the plans, Noriega said the project is not dead in the water.\n\u201cWe are 100 percent committed to still moving forward with the stadium renovation, and hopefully we\u2019ll have an operational partner, whether it\u2019s this particular group or another group,\u201d he told the outlet.\n\u2013\u2013\nKate Hinsche",

        "content": "A beloved Malibu institution has been blocked from rebuilding after January\u2019s deadly Palisades fire.\nThe Reel Inn, an iconic seafood shack on Pacific Coast Highway that stood for nearly four decades, is forbidden from renewing its lease with the California Department of Parks and Recreation, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n.\nThe parks department acquired the parcel of then-private land where the restaurant was located in the early 2000s as part of an expansion of Topanga State Park,\naccording\nto Time Out Los Angeles. Reel Inn owners Teddy Seraphine-Leonard and Andy Leonard had been leasing the land from the state ever since.\nThat lease expired a month after the fires. Last month, the parks department notified them that their lease would not be renewed.\nThe owners don\u2019t want to give up, though it would be a difficult path to reopening in a smaller capacity. The Reel Inn could compete for a two- to three-year lease on the site to operate a food truck, but rebuilding any sort of permanent structure is off-limits,\nper\nthe Santa Monica Mirror.\n\u201cWould we like to revive it? Yes, we would,\u201d Seraphine-Leonard told WSJ. \u201cIt would be a Herculean task to bring it back.\u201d\n\nBecause the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has set up a staging ground on the site as part of its effort to restore the neighborhood\u2019s power grid, the Parks Department is requiring a competitive bidding process for any businesses interested in signing a short-term lease on the land.\nThough most of The Reel Inn\u2019s 18 former kitchen workers have found new jobs, the Leonards were able to assist them financially via a GoFundMe campaign that has raised more than $200,000 for the staff.\nThe couple has been offered to join other restaurants or open a new Reel Inn location in Marina del Rey. But they aren\u2019t interested and have turned down the offers. For now they\u2019re focusing on other business ventures \u2014 namely, working with two of the restaurant\u2019s former chefs on a cookbook and bottling the Reel Inn\u2019s chipotle sauce.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not the same,\u201d Seraphine-Leonard said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if this will be retirement.\u201d\nIt remains to be seen what sprouts up on the site in both the short and long term. The city of Malibu\nissued its first rebuild permit\nlast month.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The sign, which was dated Sept. 1, says the owners can get a new key when the debt is settled.\nBefore terminating the lease and locking the doors, the landlord notified the restaurant of its lease violations Aug. 21.\nMidtown Scouts Square Property also filed a lawsuit against Harden and the hospitality group, claiming at least $1 million in damages. In the lawsuit, the landlord claims the lease ended in July and both parties agreed to extend it through October. It alleges the owners still failed to make monthly payments after the extension.\nThe 15,000-square-foot steakhouse and hookah lounge opened at 1911 Bagby Street in 2021.

        "content": "The head of agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland is looking to cash out of one of Chicago\u2019s priciest condo towers.\nJuan Luciano, ADM\u2019s president, CEO and chairman, and his wife Caroline just put their 48th-floor unit at\nOne Bennett Park\non the market for $6.9 million, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The couple bought the four-bedroom, 4,800-square-foot spread in 2022 for a little more than $5.7 million \u2014 or about $1,188 per square foot \u2014 setting their ask about 20 percent higher than what they paid three years ago.\nSuch appreciation would be a\nfar cry from the broader market\n. Condo values in Streeterville have been mostly flat over the same stretch \u2014 up about 2 percent, according to Redfin, while Zillow data shows a 5 percent dip. Downtown condo sellers have been facing an uphill battle since the pandemic, as demand trails supply and many units sit on the market longer.\nFor high-end sellers like the Lucianos, the bet is that luxury buyers remain insulated from broader market weakness. But their pricing also tests just how much appetite remains for trophy condos in a downtown market still trying to regain its footing.\nStill, Luciano\u2019s listing leans on finishes fit for a CEO. The condo features 11-foot Venetian plaster ceilings, herringbone wood floors, horsehair wall coverings, cashmere blackout drapes in the primary bedroom and a bronze fireplace mantel. Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Brant Booker has the listing.\nLast year a Streeterville\npenthouse\nlisted for $4 million at 415 East North Water Street, and a whole lot less by the foot, asking $430 per square foot. The latest listing for that unit came down from a nearly $13 million ask when the sellers first put it on the market in 2015.\n\nLuciano, who joined ADM in 2011 and took the reins as CEO in 2015, bought the Bennett Park unit about a year before he and his wife picked up another in the same tower 15 stories below, paying $1.85 million. That second unit hit the rental market last year at $10,500 a month, but isn\u2019t listed for sale.\nADM, one of the world\u2019s largest food processors, moved its global headquarters to Chicago in 2014. Luciano has overseen the company\u2019s expansion and transition from its downstate Decatur base.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Bobby Cayre and Ben Ashkenazy are locked in on the\nMagnificent Mile\nafter paying down a big chunk of debt to their lender.\nA joint venture of the New York-based real estate titans is keeping one of Chicago\u2019s most recognizable retail spots at\n700 North Michigan Avenue\n, known as the Chicago Place Mall. To do so, the venture had to cough up $65 million to lender Aareal Capital Corporation, property records show.\nAs part of the loan paydown, Aareal extended a new $33 million senior mortgage loan against the 300,000-square-foot property, which currently houses Saks Fifth Avenue and Zara in its two ground-floor corner spaces. There is a vacancy in the spot between those stores, and T-Mobile vacated 11,000 square feet in 2023. Ashkenazy has previously toyed with the idea of turning the upper floors of vacant former shopping space into offices.\nAareal in 2021 extended the loan term for the borrowers after they paid down $6.7 million of principal on a $105 million loan originally issued in 2016. After Aareal agreed to allow the borrowers more time to pay off the $33 million in new debt, an entity linked to Cayre\u2019s firm Aurora Capital Associates at 1407 Broadway in New York provided a $65 million junior loan to the property with a maturity date of 2040.\nHow the landlords sourced the junior loan is unclear.\nBut together, the sum could amount to payoff for most of the Aareal debt, signalling Cayre\u2019s and Ashkenazy\u2019s confidence in the Magnificent Mile, despite its struggles in recent years.\n\nAareal and Cayre\u2019s firm declined to comment, while Ashkenazy Acquisition didn\u2019t return requests for comment. It\u2019s unclear whether the owners altered the portion of the property each of them owns as part of the transaction.\nHowever, the new financing staves off near-term distress at a time when Mag Mile landlords are struggling with vacancies, falling rents and shaky lender confidence.\nOther major properties, including\nWater Tower Place\n, have faced foreclosure threats or forced sales after tenants walked. By locking in new debt, the pair avoid the fate of some peers who\u2019ve handed back keys.\nCayre has been involved with the property since 2004, when it was purchased for $39 million, and Ashkenazy and New York investor Alex Adjmi were also investors. It\u2019s unclear from property records whether Adjmi is still a part of the ownership.\nStill, the fundamentals remain murky. Leasing momentum is slow, and while the city has floated ideas to revive the avenue \u2014 from entertainment-driven tenants to more residential conversions \u2014 the road back to pre-pandemic vitality may be long, and even if Cayre and Ashkenazy\u2019s fresh capital buys time, there\u2019s a question of whether it will be enough.\n",

        "content": "In the eleventh hour, the fate of three ballot proposals that take aim at the city\u2019s land use review process is in jeopardy.\nOn Tuesday, the city\u2019s Board of Elections will consider\nfive questions\napproved by the Charter Revision Commission. Typically, this part of the process would be a mere formality, a stamp before the questions are posed to voters in November.\nBut City Council leaders\nchallenged\nthree of the questions, alleging that they threaten to mislead voters. The questions ask whether various changes should be made to the city\u2019s land use review process, largely related to speeding up approvals for housing projects and restricting the informal veto power local City Council members wield over rezonings.\nBut whether the Board of Elections has the power to make such drastic changes to the upcoming ballot depends on who you ask.\nExecutive Director Michael Ryan told\nThe Real Deal\nthat the Board of Elections\u2019 legal team was reviewing whether the board has the authority to reject these questions. The board will discuss the issue on Tuesday, just two days before the deadline to finalize the ballot.\nDuring a meeting on Tuesday, President Frederic Umane\ncast doubt\non the board\u2019s ability to halt the proposals, noting the board\u2019s \u201cministerial role.\u201d\nWhat falls under \u201cministerial\u201d is apparently up for debate.\nThe City Council pointed to a 1994 decision by an appellate court that upheld an Erie County Board of Elections\u2019 rejection of a ballot question. In a response letter, Charter Revision Commission Executive Director Alec Schierenbeck cited the same case, but specified that the rejection was upheld because the proper protocol for certifying ballot questions hadn\u2019t been followed. It is within the \u201cstrictly ministerial\u201d purview of the board to reject a question in that scenario, but the wording of a ballot question should be left to the courts, the letter states.\nWhen asked about the issue, Jerry Goldfelder, an election law attorney with Cozen O\u2019Connor, also cited the appellate court decision and the fact that it \u201crecognized a board\u2019s authority to approve or reject a ballot proposal.\u201d\n\u201cIt remains to be seen what the board, or ultimately a court, would do here,\u201d he told\nTRD\nin an email.\n\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s meeting, Commissioner Frank Seddio argued that a ballot proposal could be challenged if unclear or misleading.\n\u201cAt best, in my reading, it is ambiguous, at worst it\u2019s misleading,\u201d he said, emphasizing the far-reaching implications of the ballot proposals. Seddio, a former Kings County Democrats boss, was appointed to the board in December by the City Council\u2019s Democratic caucus. A number of progressive Council members opposed the choice, the City\nreported\nat the time.\nSchierenbeck\u2019s letter counters that the ballot questions strictly follow state election law, adhering to its word count limits and clearly spelling out how a \u201cyes\u201d versus a \u201cno\u201d vote would shift authority over certain land use decisions.\nAs of Friday afternoon, board officials would only say that the issue was still under consideration and would be addressed during Tuesday\u2019s meeting. Whether the board rejects or approves the questions, the body\u2019s actions next week are likely to result in legal action. The City Council has already indicated that it is prepared to sue to block the proposals from being placed on the ballot. The Charter Revision Commission emphasized in its letter that the courts should decide, not the Board of Elections.\nOne of the questions the Council wants eliminated asks whether the city should replace the mayoral veto in the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, or Ulurp, with a three-member appeals board for certain projects. The board could only reverse Council decisions on projects that would result in affordable housing in one borough, not citywide land use actions.\nAnother asks voters if modest housing projects should go through a quicker review process that bypasses City Council approval. The third proposal would fast-track housing (avoiding a Council vote) in districts that have approved the lowest rates of affordable housing.\nThe City Council\u2019s attempts to eliminate these questions \u2014 and the uncertainty over how the board will act \u2014 have drawn the ire of real estate and housing groups.\n\u201cWe are at a crossroads,\u201d New York Apartment Association\u2019s Kenny Burgos said in a statement. \u201cDo we let the supporters and opponents of these proposals make their case to the voters and let voters decide, or do we revert to back room deals and cronyism that leave voters powerless in the decisions about their future?\u201d\nPro-housing group Open New York blamed Republicans on the Board of Elections for trying to \u201cshortcut the democratic process.\u201d\n\u201cThere seems to be no limit to the corruption, prejudice, and small-mindedness that will drive political pawns who are not policymakers to undemocratically halt progress in its tracks,\u201d Annemarie Gray, the group\u2019s executive director, said in a statement. \u201cThe BOE should stay in its own lane and let New Yorkers drive the bus towards their own future by allowing them to vote on these measures, which we are confident will pass overwhelmingly.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Two builder\u2019s remedy projects in Beverly Hills that drew criticism from residents are getting even bigger.\nThe developments at 125-129 South Linden Drive and 8844 Burton Way are adding several stories to their project plans, the\nBeverly Press\nreported\n.\nLeo Pustilnikov, the developer who\nsuccessfully sued the city of Beverly Hills\nfor\nunlawfully blocking\nthe Linden project from advancing, has updated plans for that development to nearly double the size.\nWith the new Linden proposal, the tower grows from 19 to 36 stories and from approximately 200 feet to 400 feet. It now includes an additional 185 units with 28 set aside for affordable housing for a total of 350 units, 61 reserved for low-income residents. An 80-room luxury hotel is also slated for the property.\n\u201cThis project represents a bold vision for the future of Beverly Hills,\u201d Pustilnikov said in a statement of the Linden development. However, Michael Forbes, Beverly HIlls\u2019 director of community development, said the city has not yet received an application for the revised application.\nThe size of the Linden Drive tower, even at its original height, drew the ire of the Southwest Beverly Hills Homeowners Association. Association president Ken Goldman was disappointed with Pustilnikov\u2019s new plans.\n\u201cIn my opinion, the greedy developer just got greedier,\u201d Goldman told the Beverly Press. \u201cIf he really wants to help the housing situation, then 100 percent of his project should be available for affordable housing.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile,\nCrescent Heights\u2019 planned builder\u2019s remedy project\nat 8844 Burton Way, currently an empty lot, increased from 20 to 26 stories, according to revised plans submitted to the city.\nThe Burton Way tower would rise approximately 309 feet, up from the previous height of 223 feet, and increase from 480,686 square feet to 492,029 square feet. It would also include 318 parking spaces instead of the previously proposed 277, though it will keep the same number of housing units at 200.\nThe updated project still includes affordable housing units, though the number was slashed from 40 lower-income units to 14 extremely-low-income units and eight moderate-income units. The move was made after changes to California housing laws reduced the number of affordable housing units required to qualify for builder\u2019s remedy status.\nExtremely-low-income in Los Angeles County is\nconsidered\nto be a maximum annual wage of $31,850 for one person, while moderate-income is a maximum of $89,550.\n\u201cAs residents, we are not opposed to thoughtful, balanced development. We care deeply about responsible growth that honors the unique character of Beverly Hills,\u201d local resident Ren\u00e9e Strauss told the Press. \u201cBut when city leadership fails to communicate after specifically committing to do better, it erodes trust and creates unnecessary division. We are simply asking that the city uphold its promise, protect our voice and ensure transparency in matters that affect us all.\u201d\nUnder its\nHousing Element\n, the city of Beverly Hills must plan to build 3,104 new housing units by 2029.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "After six years of trying to find a buyer, the sprawling Green Gables estate in Woodside has finally sold \u2014 setting a record for the Bay Area in the process.\nA sale of lots tied to the estate closed on Wednesday for approximately $85 million, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. It\u2019s a sharp drop from the 2019 list price of $117 million and\n2021 price of $135 million\n, though it still marks the priciest sale in the Bay Area so far this year.\nThe storied Woodside compound has long been tied to the Fleishhacker family, built in the early 20th century by Anglo California Bank and Great Western Power Company founder Mortimer Fleishhacker. A group of Fleishhacker\u2019s family members opted to sell to prevent infighting over the estate. The off-market purchase was made by New York-based Pantheum LLC,\nincorporated\nin August 2023, according to the Business Times.\nIt might have traded hands for 30 percent less than its\nrecent $125 million asking price\nbut still far outdoes last year\u2019s most expensive home sale in the Bay Area. That deal involved the $71 million sale of 2840 Broadway in San Francisco\u2019s ritzy Pacific Heights neighborhood by Laurene Powell Jobs, widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.\nStill, the Green Gables sale doesn\u2019t come close to teaching the Bay Area\u2019s most expensive home sale in history. That title belongs to a 2012 off-market deal where SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son bought a 9-acre estate in Woodside at 360 Mountain Home Road for $117.5 million, per the Business Times.\n\nThe first home on Green Gables built for the Fleishhackers was a nearly 10,000-square-foot home calling to mind English thatch-roofed cottages. Over the subsequent decades, six other homes were built on the property. All seven residences are private and separated from each other.\nThe property features a Roman pool, a stone teahouse, three swimming pools, a fruit and vegetable garden, a tennis court and an artist\u2019s studio used by family matriarch Bella Gerstle Fleishhacker.\nIrrigation for 90 percent of the estate\u2019s gardens is fed via a 50,000-square-foot, 20-foot-deep reservoir. The property also has the rights to the nearby Kings Mountain watershed, including an easement and deed to use up to 30 million gallons of water per year.\nOver the years, the estate has welcomed diplomats, politicians and business leaders, including hosting the 20th anniversary celebration for the United Nations in 1965. It was also where former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes stayed during her infamous Bay Area trial in 2021.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "School\u2019s back in session. Real estate is, too.\nJEMB Realty recently\nended a legal nightmare\nwith ASA College at a building in Herald Center. The saga began in 2020 when ASA missed rent payments, leading JEMB to sue the school and its owner, Alex Shchegol.\nBut the lawsuit was one of many controversies dogging Shchegol and the for-profit college industry. Shchegol made life hard for the college\u2019s old landlord, embarking on a series of unusual legal maneuvers, leading to accusations from JEMB\u2019s lawyers that said his legal strategy amounted to judgment evasion.\nWith the litigation all settled, JEMB may finally collect from ASA; a New York state court awarded two judgments over $18 million against Shchegol and ASA in 2022.\nASA\u2019s space at 1293 Broadway has since been taken by Yeshiva University.\nThat legal saga wasn\u2019t the education system\u2019s only grip on real estate this week.\nThe Upper West Side property that held the shuttered Manhattan Country School, a progressive private institution, is\nup for sale\n. Manhattan Country School purchased the building from The New School, which housed its music college at the site.\nThe building at 150 West 85th Street was appraised at $39 million in 2021, but it\u2019s unclear what Bob Knakal will be able to arrange in an acquisition.\nThe school\u2019s expansion plans, funded by draining its endowment and borrowing $20 million, were hindered by the pandemic and may have ultimately led to its collapse and bankruptcy.\n\nQueens-based Flushing Bank held the debt. Last October, it filed for foreclosure on the building. A bankruptcy filing for the school came months later.\nGlow up\nElsewhere, Sephora\nleased a 7,800-square-foot retail space\nat 1 St. Mark\u2019s Place, a boutique office project in the East Village developed by the late Brandon Miller\u2019s company, Real Estate Equities Corporation.\nThe project has seen its fair share of challenges, including a foreclosure attempt in 2021 before construction began and REEC falling behind on loan payments in the middle of last year.\nDespite past difficulties and a shift in REEC\u2019s focus to office development before the pandemic, the completion of the building and this lease indicate a positive step forward for the project.\nLagging\nNew development contracts in NYC\nfell 9 percent in August\n, but dollar volume jumped by 13 percent to $597 million, largely on the back of an $87.5 million penthouse deal at 140 Jane Street.\nA major factor contributing to the seemingly slow month was 80 Clarkson Street, a 112-unit development, which has yet to report any contracts despite reported strong sales activity.\nOther factors weighing on the market include a lack of new inventory, buyers anticipating lower mortgage rates and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming mayoral race.\n",

We\u2019re moving to Miami.\u201d\nThe social media ad\nechoes warnings\nfrom other luxury agents who have been warning of an exodus of the city\u2019s wealthy residents since Mamdani prevailed in the Democratic primary earlier this summer.\n\u201cMy number one job will be moving people from New York to Florida. Again,\u201d Serhant told the New York Post shortly after the vote. \u201cBased on the results, clients are going to hold off on making any kind of investment in New York City.\u201d\nWhether a Mamdani triumph will send New Yorkers who aren\u2019t already spending six months and a day down South packing is still up for debate, but it\u2019s clear that real estate is jittery over the prospect.\nThe industry\u2019s support has\nvacillated between\nformer Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams, with its power players throwing their weight behind both candidates, according to the latest round of campaign donations.\nBut as rumor has it, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has been mulling over potential positions for Adams and the Republican mayoral candidate, Curtis Sliwa, in an attempt to consolidate opposition to Mamdani and give the challenger, likely Cuomo, a stronger shot at beating him in the general election.\nThe latest reports, which circulated on Friday, indicated the president\u2019s advisers, including developer Steve Witkoff, were in talks to offer Adams an ambassadorship in Saudi Arabia.\nAdams has denied that he\u2019d had any discussions with the administration, though he appeared to soften his position in a statement released on Friday and published in the New York Times.\nIn the statement, Adams said that \u201cno formal offers have been made\u201d and that he is \u201cstill running for re-election.\u201d\n\nBut if the rumors prove true, Goldentayer may have to rethink the billboard.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: The number of millionaire renters in the United States nearly tripled between 2019 and 2023, outpacing the increase in the number of millionaire homeowners, according to data from\nRentCafe\n.\nNew York City led the charge with roughly 5,600 millionaire households leasing homes in the city \u2014 but where are they renting?

Elana Leopold, a political strategist, will serve as a senior adviser for the Democratic nominee\u2019s campaign, while Louise Yeung, who worked previously under de Blasio\u2019s Department of Transportation and as chief climate officer for comptroller Brad Lander, will serve as policy director.\n\u2014 Here\u2019s a new form of protest: A town Council candidate in Cranford, New Jersey, started break dancing at a town hall meeting to push back against property tax increases, according to\nABC6 Action News\n. The candidate, Will Thilly, took a brief pause to raise questions about the tax changes, only to resume his moves, including an attempt at a backspin.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$4.1 million\nfor 140 East 63rd Street, 13/14D.

        "content": "Compass is selling five North Shore offices to RE/MAX Premier, giving the RE/MAX brokerage\u00a0 a foothold in suburban Chicago\u2019s luxury market.\nRE/MAX Premier is acquiring Compass offices in Glencoe, Glenview, Highland Park, Lake Forest and\nWinnetka\n, the brokerage announced this week. The lakeshore towns sport multimillion dollar mansions and boast some of the highest prices around Chicago. Winnetka, for example, was the site of the\nmost expensive home sale\nin Chicagoland\u2019s history this week, when an offer of more than $31 million closed for 419 Sheridan Road.\nThe sale of the Compass offices comes less than a year after\nCompass acquired @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate\n, making the combined business by far the largest brokerage in the Chicago area. @properties has offices in each city where RE/MAX Premier is rebranding Compass offices.\nFounded in 2011 by CEO Janice Corley, RE/MAX Premier currently has five offices between Chicago and Houston, Texas. The new acquisition will double its office space and give it exposure to the high-end real estate that makes up the North Shore.\nAs the buildings change hands, it remains to be seen what will become of the more than 200 agents that work at the five Compass offices. As independent contractors, agents generally have freedom to move brokerages within their contracts\u2019 terms.\nTamara Edwards, Corley\u2019s spokesperson, said the agents at the offices aren\u2019t required to move to RE/MAX Premier as part of the deal and it hasn\u2019t been determined how many will join the brokerage once it sets up shop in the offices. Several Compass agents at the offices reached by phone declined to comment on the deal.\n\u201cThey can stay at the brand that they would like, and if they\u2019d like to come over to RE/MAX, that\u2019s obviously an option,\u201d Edwards said.\nEdwards said Corley wants to hire 500 agents to staff the brokerage\u2019s new North Shore operations going forward.\n\nRE/MAX and Compass did not share the financial details of the deal.\nFor Compass, the decision to shed the offices was part of an effort to cut down on its brick-and-mortar presence in the North Shore after its purchase of @properties, a Compass source told\nThe Real Deal.\nThe person said Compass will continue to serve North Shore clients through its nearby offices.\nCorley pitched the purchase as bringing control of the offices from a national firm to local ownership. RE/MAX operates under a franchise model, in which brokerages like RE/MAX Premier are owned and operated independently.\nThe RE/MAX business model gives agents more autonomy and is an alternative to \u201cmany real estate companies today that are owned by venture capital or hedge funds with no local presence,\u201d Corley said.\nHer push into the North Shore comes as Chicago-area residential brokerages increasingly consolidate to scale up their reach, with an eye on maximizing their luxury clientele. Following the Compass purchase of @properties, Baird &amp; Warner responded by acquiring Dream Town Real Estate in Chicago.\nThe former Compass offices will be part of The RE/MAX Collection, RE/MAX\u2019s luxury division. They will begin transitioning to the RE/MAX brand over the next month.\nCompass has made an aggressive push to increase its market share in Chicago, and nationally, in the last few years through acquisitions of major brokerages and teams. When it purchased @properties last year, co-CEOs Thad Wong and Mike Golden said the two brokerages would continue to operate as separate business units with separate branding.\nCompass\nreported all-time records\nacross 10 metrics in its second-quarter earnings call this year, including net income, revenue and market share. It brought in more than $2 billion in revenue and grew its national market share to 6.09 percent.\n",

        "content": "One of Chicago\u2019s fastest-growing law firms is cutting back on square footage even as it levels up its address, falling into the trend of office tenants downsizing their leases while moving into newer buildings.\nKilpatrick Townsend &amp; Stockton inked a deal for just over 29,000 square feet on the 45th floor of BMO Tower at 320 South Canal Street, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The Atlanta-based firm will move in October 2026, consolidating two separate Chicago offices totaling more than 70,000 square feet into the new space.\nThat downsizing means more pain for downtown landlords already battling record vacancies. Kilpatrick is set to exit about 34,000 square feet at 175 West Jackson Boulevard, a property heading toward foreclosure, and another 37,000 square feet at 500 West Madison Street, an asset owned by KBS Realty Advisors that\u2019s nearly 90 percent leased.\nThe consolidation is a win for the BMO-anchored tower, a 52-story, 1.5 million-square-foot development by Riverside Investment &amp; Development and Convexity Properties completed mid-pandemic. The building was 78 percent leased before the deal, with law firms proving to be a reliable tenant base, the outlet reported. Faegre Drinker, Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom, and Chapman &amp; Cutler already call the tower home.\nOther firms, such as\nAntares\nCapital and\nMolson Coors\n, relocated to the BMO tower in recent years.\n\nKilpatrick has been on a Chicago growth tear, acquiring L&amp;G Law Group in 2023 and HMB Legal Counsel last year, adding more than 55 attorneys. It now has close to 100 lawyers and staff in the city.\nIts departure from 175 West Jackson is especially\nbruising\nfor its landlord and lender. The 1.4 million-square-foot building, owned by Brookfield Asset Management, has been mired in foreclosure since 2022 after the landlord defaulted on a $280 million loan. The property was appraised at just $84 million last fall, down from $210 million in 2022, and was less than half leased as of May. Another major tenant, Wolverine Trading, is also leaving.\nCushman &amp; Wakefield brokers Steve Schneider, Chris Wood and Presley Norby represented Kilpatrick during lease negotiations.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

It planned to convert it into a 243-key Marriott Autograph Collection hotel called El Portal. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February in the face of mounting liens and a loan default.\nContractors and suppliers have\nfiled about $8 million in liens\non the property, prompting the lender Austin-based WM Capital Partners, which provided a $14.4 million loan, to ask the judge to take the property out of the owner\u2019s hands. The deal allows Blueprint principals to retain an indirect ownership stake and settles the claims regarding the property. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez wrote that all parties involved reached agreement in good faith in a Sept. 3 filing.\nAshford is taking on the project as it faces its own financial obstacles.\n\nA $590 million loan backed by 18 Ashford-owned hotels was\ntransferred to special servicing\nafter Ashford defaulted on its balloon payment and failed to refinance, Morningstar Credit reported.\nMeanwhile, Braemar, which Bennett founded and chairs, put itself up for sale at the end of August in a bid to save shareholder value.

This month, more than\n$700 million\nin CRE loans in Texas\u2019 largest counties were flagged for foreclosure. That\u2019s up from about $400 million in July.\nMost of the properties in question are older apartment complexes with loans from 2022. The prevailing narrative is that upstart multifamily operators amassed portfolios with floating-rate loans when debt was cheap. They planned to renovate these aging properties, jack up rents and sell the apartments at a premium. But, interest rates \u2014 and their debt service \u2014 ballooned before many of them could execute.\nMonth after month, Harris County, home to Houston, is hardest hit. At the September sale, 10 properties totaling nearly $350 million in debt faced foreclosure. The number includes a few holdovers from last month when multifamily operator Fercan Kalkan had\n3,000 units targeted for default\n.\n\nThe latest Beige Book from the Dallas Federal Reserve faintly echoes these woes with a \u201ccautious\u201d outlook for commercial real estate in the area, noting \u201cscattered reports of distressed property sales.\u201d Construction and investment sales are sluggish, it reported.\nHere\u2019s more Texas real estate news from this week:\nOn CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box, Federal Housing Financing Agency boss\nBill Pulte refused to comment\non mortgage fraud accusations involving Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. In the same segment, he discussed similar accusations involving Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The accusations provided the basis for Cook\u2019s ouster by Trump, who\u2019s also been exerting his populist political style and appeal in attempts to convince Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates.\nHouston-based master-planned community developer Land Tejas announced\nco-founder and CEO Al Brende died\nat the age of 80. Since Brende helped found the company in 1997, it\u2019s developed 15,000 acres of land and more than 20 communities in Houston, including Sunterra, which is consistently ranked among the top-selling master-planned communities nationwide. In 2024, it came in fourth.\nThe\ntop single-family sale\nin what\u2019s become a buyers market in Austin was a 3,400-square-foot new build in Zilker. The five-bed, four-bath at 1001 Bluebonnet Land was asking $3.4 million. It was listed on May 8 for $3.25 million, removed from the MLS on Aug. 14, and relisted the next day asking $150,000 more.

        "content": "Former Pacific Union and Compass California boss\nMark McLaughlin\nhas retired, kind of.\n\u201cI turned 66 [on Tuesday] and I think it\u2019s my turn to enjoy my life with Monique, my wife,\u201d McLaughlin said as he described his new part-time advisory role with Compass earlier this week.\nAfter his two-year contract as chief real estate strategist ended this summer, McLaughlin\u2019s now settled into semi-retirement, if you can call it that.\nAside from his role at Compass, he\u2019s an advisor in Homeowner.ai and mortgage lender Realfinity through past investments made via his venture fund, McLaughlin Ventures. Taking on additional clients in the brokerage business is not likely, he said, pointing to a conflict of interest given his insights into Compass.\nThe executive was Compass California president between September 2018 and December 2020. Before that, McLaughlin grew Pacific Union International through a dozen acquisitions when he stepped into the CEO role in 2009. When Compass bought Pacific Union, McLaughlin had grown the brokerage to $14 billion in annual sales volume.\nAnatomy of a brokerage deal\nAll that said, McLaughlin\u2019s not stepping away from the M&amp;A world entirely. In fact, before he hung up the phone with\nThe Real Deal\n, he offered his final comment: \u201cMake my phone ring.\u201d\nThat was after plenty of shop talk around the current state of play for brokerage M&amp;A.\nMcLaughlin expects continued industry consolidation, acknowledging that, while this may not look like a good time to sell, earnouts and other clauses baked into a contract could make a trade more palatable to sellers.\nWhile brokerages generally trade at a multiple of 3 to 5.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, McLaughlin said conversations around EBITDA are more nuanced now. That\u2019s in part due to non-recurring expenses, such as legal fees or last year\u2019s National Association of Realtors-related commission settlement that can distort EBITDA, a metric that offers a clear line of sight into a business\u2019s cash flow, ability to pay down debt or valuation.\n\u201cThe thing you have to keep in context is four years ago, five years ago, the negotiation between buyer and seller was, \u2018What\u2019s my multiple of EBITDA going to be?\u2019 Now, it\u2019s \u2018How many adjustments can I make to my EBITDA so we can work out a deal,\u2019\u201d McLaughlin said.\nAdditionally, whether or not a brokerage is more desirable to prospective buyers because of diversified revenue streams from services such as title or escrow, depends on the market it operates in. If a market is already saturated with those ancillary services, a plain vanilla brokerage deal could work, he offered.\nCompass makes another Colorado buy\nOne name that\u2019s making things work on the M&amp;A front: Compass.\n\nThe brokerage said Thursday it snapped up Littleton, Colo.-based Colorado Home Realty, which counted $617.2 million in 2024 sales volume under co-founder and CEO Matt Hudson.\nThe brokerage joins Compass\u2019 existing footprint in the state with nearly 20 offices in Aspen, Boulder, Denver and Vail among other locations.\nColorado Home Realty\u2019s acquisition follows Compass\u2019 purchase in early July of PorchLight Real Estate Group, also based in Colorado. PorchLight had sales volume last year of $922.3 million.\nLater in July, Compass bought Cottingham Chalk in North Carolina, with $589 million in 2024 volume.\nLA\u2019s largest brokerages\nSpeaking of sales volume,\nTRD\u2019s ranking\nof Los Angeles\u2019 largest brokerages was published in our September issue and elicited strong reactions as they always do.\nOn the actual substance of the rankings, the top three firms remained unchanged with Compass leading the pack by a wide margin with $14.5 billion in sales across 5,966 on-market deals for the July 1, 2024 to July 1, 2025 reporting period. Coldwell Banker Realty came in at No. 2 with $5.4 billion in volume and 2,289 deals. Meanwhile, The Agency closed on $3.6 billion across 1,147 deals to round out the top three.\nInterestingly, Carolwood Estates shot up four spaces on the list to No. 4 with 478 on-market deals, tallying to $3.3 billion in volume. It\u2019s an impressive feat for a brokerage that launched in November 2022.\nUp next is the agents and teams ranking for Los Angeles in our October issue.\nPalisades resi bests itself, again\nIf anyone\u2019s keeping tabs on Carolwood, it only took a week for the firm\u2019s name to resurface in another\nTRD\nheadline.\nThe brokerage was involved with the $25.8 million sale of\n1124 Napoli Drive\n, which was dropped in the MLS for comp purposes but traded off market. Napoli Drive now sits as the Palisades\u2019 most expensive residential purchase this year.\nCarolwood\u2019s Zac Mostame and the Beverly Hills Estates Lea Porter together represented both the buyer and seller in that trade.\nNapoli Drive beat the Los Angeles community\u2019s previous record sale in the $22.1 million purchase of the Parry Residence at\n14924 Camarosa Drive\n. That property held the title of priciest Palisades deal for about a week.\n",

        "content": "More wealthy would-be buyers are doing the math, and deciding their deals for a piece of New York City real estate aren\u2019t adding up.\nMore of the city\u2019s wealthiest residents are opting to rent, according to data from UrbanDigs released earlier this summer. Between January and April, 300 ultra-luxury rentals \u2014 defined as homes asking more than $20,000 a month \u2014 were rented, a 30 percent uptick compared to the same period last year.\nUrbanDigs\u2019 findings are proof of a trend that\u2019s been building since at least 2019, according to a\nreport from RentCafe\n. The report found the number of millionaire renters tripled across the country between 2019 and 2023, with the highest number of millionaire renters living in New York City. With more than 5,600 millionaire renter households, the city far surpassed the runner-up, San Francisco, with just 1,400.\nAn increase in wealthy renters is likely a good sign for developers like Orin Wilf, whose firm,\u00a0 Skyline Developers, is launching a luxury rental project at 18 West 55th Street, where asking rents will top out around $35,000 a month.\nWilf said the team envisioned building luxury condos during the initial planning phase almost eight years ago, but during the pandemic, they shifted to luxury rentals instead.\n\u201cThe real explanation is simple,\u201d Wilf said. \u201cRents have increased. Instead of selling, let\u2019s rent them and rent them for pretty good numbers, but still under the cost of buying something across the street on Billionaires\u2019 Row.\u201d\nAnd, according to his estimation, the project\u2019s units couldn\u2019t be hitting the market at a better time \u2014 wealthy buyers are hesitant to pull the trigger with the upcoming mayoral election still in flux and with mortgage rates still persistently high.\n\u201cThe rental market is the hottest it has ever been in the history of New York City,\u201d Wilf said. \u201cThere has never been a market like this one.\u201d\nThe Agency\u2019s Mike Fabbri said the \u201cuptick\u201d in demand included tenants who were displaced by the fires in Los Angeles and are now searching for short-term options, between three to six months, to test out a potential move to the city. He\u2019s also secured rentals for those renovating homes they purchased and need a place to stay while the work continues, as well as parents renting spots near their children who are working or attending school in the city.\nDowntown Manhattan has dominated the borough\u2019s luxury activity this year, with new developments drawing some away from the pricey uptown enclaves they have historically picked. But the neighborhoods south of 14th Street have been cleaning up with high-priced rental deals.\nAn executive with Michael Rubin\u2019s sports platform, Fanatics, agreed this week to pay\n$40,000 a month\nfor a condo at 160 Leroy. The deal, which works out to $234 per square foot, is a peak price for the property, which previously set the record for the building when it rented for $32,000 earlier this year.\n\nIn July, a top-floor unit at 130 William Street\nset a rental record for the Financial District\nafter an off-market deal for $75,000 per month. Corcoran\u2019s Steve Gold initially listed the unit for $20 million in 2020, and told Mansion Global the sale offer stands even after inking the one-year lease.\nNot so fast\u2026\nColdwell Banker Warburg is upping its star power.\nThe host of MTV\u2019s \u201cCatfish,\u201d N\u0113v Schulman, is now an agent at the New York City-based brokerage, the firm announced this week. Schulman, who was also the runner-up on \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d in 2020, is joining the company where his father, Robert Schulman, has been a broker for more than 30 years.\n\u201cHosting Catfish taught me how to listen deeply, build trust quickly, and help people\nnavigate some of the most emotional decisions of their lives,\u201d Schulman said. \u201cReal estate in New York is no different.\u201d\nNews of Schulman\u2019s debut at the firm comes after one of the stars of Netflix\u2019s\n\u201cSelling the City,\u201d\nAbigail Godfrey, jumped to the brokerage from Douglas Elliman, where she was a member of Eleonora Srugo\u2019s Eleonora &amp; Co. team. The series, which has only had one season, followed Srugo and her then-cohort of five agents, though none of the show\u2019s cast members appear to be still working with her, according to her team\u2019s website.\nColdwell Banker Warburg, led by Kevelyn Guzman, has been on a hiring streak in recent months, including bringing on more than two dozen agents from Elegran Real Estate, a boutique firm that recently broke from its partnership with Forbes Global Properties. One of its managers, Jared Antin, left the firm earlier this summer to join Brown Harris Stevens as an executive director.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe most expensive deal recorded in the city register this week was for a penthouse at Legion Investment Group\u2019s 109 East 79th Street, which sold for $33 million, or $5,000 per square foot. The deal for the Upper East Side condo, which\nlast asked $35 million\n, was up from its 2022 purchase price, when a company registered in Montevideo, Uruguay, bought the apartment for $28 million.\nPenthouse 16 spans 6,500 square feet and has five bedrooms and five bathrooms. It also features two terraces. The Modlin Group\u2019s Adam Modlin represented the buyer, an entity known as Pixidust LLC, and the seller.\n",

        "content": "A couple of recent trades in San Jose put the South Bay city\u2019s multifamily market in rarefied air \u2014 at least on a relative basis.\nConsider that both deals involved complexes of affordable units, one marked a new high-water mark for the year on overall price in the broader Santa Clara County market, and each of them topped $300,000 per unit.\nIndeed, the range from $317,000 for a property just north of the 280 Freeway and $390,000 for just south of the thoroughfare in West San Jose nearly touches the $400,000 or so per unit average of multifamily in neighboring San Francisco lately, and is well ahead of farther-flung\u00a0 major metros such as Chicago, where the average is closer to $200,000 per unit.\nReal estate firm Standard Communities, nonprofit Housing on Merit, and investment company Vistria Real Estate\nbought the Park Kiely apartments\nin the larger of the two deals, acquiring 355 Kiely Boulevard for $370 million. The $390,300-per-unit transaction was made possible by a purchase loan of $203.5 million from JLL Real Estate Capital, which then transferred it to Freddie Mac.\nThe transaction is the priciest in Santa Clara County so far this year,\naccording\nto the Mercury News. The previous high-water mark in the county was set in April with the sale of The Villages at Cupertino apartments to Rockpoint Group for $207.2 million.\nElsewhere in the South Bay city, San Francisco-based Sack Capital Partners and Encinitas-based Las Palmas Housing\nbought the Fountain Park apartments\nfor $52 million. The property at 1028 South De Anza Boulevard consists of 164 units, working out to $317,000 per unit.\nSan Jose has seen other multifamily properties change hands in recent months, some dipping into the Chicago range.\nLos Angeles-based real estate firm Post Glen Group and Newport Beach-based nonprofit Affordable Housing Access bought the\nOrchard Glen\napartments in south San Jose in June. Post Glen Group Affordable Housing Access bought the 288-unit property at 3975 Seven Trees Boulevard for $61.1 million, about $212,000 per unit.\nThen there are the upper-tier deals, which also seem to be coming along in San Jose.\nBack in May a Hines affiliate bought the 108-unit\nLevare\nluxury apartment complex at 3003 Olin Road in the Santana Row commercial and residential district for $73.9 million, nearing $700,000 per unit.\nThat seems to have sparked some interest\u2013last month, Santana Row owner Federal Realty Investment Trust started preparations to sell the 212-unit\nMisora\ncomplex in the development\n.\nAt long last, buyers save distressed SF hotels\nA two-year saga involving two of San Francisco\u2019s biggest hotels has come to an end.\nNew York-based Newbond Holdings and Conversant Capital are in contract to buy the beleaguered\nParc 55 and Hilton Union Square\nhotels. Hilton Union Square is the city\u2019s largest hotel with 1,921 rooms, while The Parc 55, also a Hilton property, is among the top five with 1,024 keys.\n\nThe sale price wasn\u2019t disclosed, but a July bondholder report placed the hotels\u2019 combined appraised value between $450 million and $500 million, down from their 2016 appraised value of nearly $1.6 billion. The buyers were required to put down two deposits of $10 million each.\nThe buildings fell into default in 2023 when former owner Park Hotels &amp; Resorts defaulted on its $725 million loan on the properties. A court-appointed receiver spent the next two years looking for a buyer. Sales deadlines were repeatedly pushed as\nforeclosure loomed\n.\nThe Bay Area lodging market remains strained, as several hotels in the East and South Bay enclaves have\nfallen into foreclosure\nor shuttered entirely over the past two years.\nFairfield found to be illegally taxing property owners\nThe city of Fairfield is in hot water after a court found it to be\nillegally taxing property owners\n.\nThe First District Court of Appeal in San Francisco ruled the Solano County city collected assessments for lighting, landscaping and roadway maintenance in the Rolling Hills Maintenance District in violation of a 1996 voter-approved ballot measure known as Proposition 218.\nThat law mandated public votes on any property tax increases. The assessment jumped from $196.33 in 1997 to $300 in the 2022-2023 year. These payments aren\u2019t categorized as property taxes, but the court ruled the city illegally treated and levied them as such.\nIf the ruling stands, affected property owners would be entitled to refunds of excess payments. The City of Fairfield might also be required to reduce its assessments until a special election is held.\nShorenstein counts video game companies among new neighbors\nShorenstein Investment Advisers has\nadded another mixed-use property\nin the Bay Area to its portfolio.\nThe San Francisco-based outfit acquired the three-building Park Place at Bay Meadows mixed-use development in San Mateo for $175 million. The 258,000-square-foot campus, sold by J.P. Morgan, consists of two office buildings and a retail center.\nThe 1100 Park Place office building purportedly sold for $85.7 million, or about $583 per square foot, and 1200 Park Place offices went for $40 million, or approximately $655 per square foot. The retail portion at 1010-1016 Park Place, consisting of a grocery store and shopping center, sold for approximately $48.3 million, or about $991 per square foot.\nElsewhere at Bay Meadows, video game company Roblox expanded its headquarters by 68,334 square feet for a total of 750,000 square feet of offices.\nZynga\n, another video game developer, has its headquarters in most of the 62,000-square-foot 1200 Park Place building, while Essex Property Trust is the main tenant at 1100 Park Place.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A new high water mark was set for residential real estate in the Chicago area this week.\nA lakefront Winnetka mansion known as\nWindsor House was sold for nearly $31.3 million\nby a former Goldman Sachs executive to a buyer whose identity hasn\u2019t yet been publicly unveiled, smashing the previous priciest single-family home sale ever in Chicagoland.\nThe former record holder was the\n$15.3 million sale of a Lincoln Park mansion\nto commercial real estate developer\nDavid Cocagne and his wife Manassi\n. Its old owners,\ninsurance magnates Richard and Michaela Parrillo\n, once listed that property for $50 million.\nWhile the Winnetka home at 419 Sheridan Road went below its\n$35 million asking price\n\u2014 and well below the more than $60 million the sellers were said to spend on improvements and land assembly over their decades of ownership \u2014 the drop to its sale price wasn\u2019t nearly as extreme. The transaction shows the North Shore\u2019s high-end retains its reputation among the\nMidwest\u2019s wealthy elite\n.\nValues\nremain suppressed\n, however, in downtown Chicago\u2019s commercial property scene. The 1.5 million-square-foot\nCitadel Center office tower in the Loop at 131 South Dearborn Street\nis officially for sale. Once a corporate crown jewel, the building now enters a market without holding its namesake tenant\u2019s headquarters, which was moved to Miami. Plus,\noffice values have cratered\n, financing is scarce and investors are wary. Its listing underscores just how brutal the reset has been for Chicago\u2019s central business district, where even stabilized assets face an uphill climb.\n\nMultifamily owners have been\nnavigating turbulence of their own\n. A handful of distressed properties across the city have taken circuitous routes back to health through loan workouts, receiverships or firesales. Some have managed to stabilize with fresh capital, while others have changed hands at steep discounts \u2014 evidence of a sector recovering, but unevenly.\nAt the Chicago Housing Authority,\nMayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s appointment of longtime 27th Ward Alderman Walter Burnett Jr\n. hit a speedbump. Corporate attorney and CHA board member\nMatthew Brewer\nbecame the agency\u2019s interim chief, raising eyebrows after Brewer requested the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to review Burnett\u2019s possible conflicts of interest as the CHA\u2019s next potential head. Brewer now oversees, at least in the short-term, an agency under pressure to deliver on long-delayed affordable housing expansion promises\nOn the development front, builder\nSteven Ciaccio of Domus Group\nis in the hot seat. Facing foreclosure threats, unpaid bills and mounting lawsuits even as his firm has a 30-story Fulton Market apartment tower proposal in the works, Ciaccio is emblematic of a class of mid-tier developers squeezed hard by today\u2019s financing climate.\nPulling back isn\u2019t an option for many developers, though.\nMitch Goltz is pivoting\nwith his new firm GTZ Properties, by stepping away from risky plans for multifamily towers and doubling down on retail. It\u2019s a back-to-basics bet on steady cash flow as other asset classes wobble \u2014\u00a0while still leaving room for some bets on distressed commercial property in need of a makeover, like the\nOak Brook office complex Goltz just picked up at a big discount\nfrom its last trade.",
